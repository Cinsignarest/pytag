   abstract = {PURPOSE: Pouchitis is the most frequent long-term complication of restorative proctocolectomy; its long-term consequences are inadequately described. This prospective study evaluates the effect of pouchitis on the functional results, general health perception, and patient satisfaction. METHODS: A total of 100 consecutive patients who underwent stapled restorative proctocolectomy for ulcerative colitis were divided into three groups: no pouchitis, acute pouch-itis and chronic pouchitis. Functional results, general health perception, and satisfaction of each group at the latest review were compared only when patients were not symptomatic of active pouchitis. RESULTS: Pouchitis occurred in 33 patients (17 acute and 16 chronic). There were no significant differences in the long-term functional results between the no pouchitis and acute pouchitis groups. Patients who experienced chronic pouchitis had a significant increase in bowel movements, looseness of stools, urgency, nocturnal seepage, perianal excoriation, and dietary restrictions (P < 0.05). They also had a worse perception of their general health (P < 0.05). Previous chronic pouchitis had no effect on continence, daytime soilage, or gas-feces discrimination. Most patients were satisfied, despite pouchitis, and would recommend the operation to someone else with ulcerative colitis. CONCLUSIONS: Acute pouchitis is easily treated and results in minimal functional consequences. Even in the absence of clinically active pouchitis, patients who had suffered from chronic pouchitis had poorer functional results and general health perception. This may overshadow the benefits of restorative proctocolectomy. This finding suggests that acute and chronic pouchitis are distinct disease entities and chronic pouchitis may represent a persistent condition that displays episodic symptomatic exacerbation.},

   abstract = {OBJECTIVE: Selenoprotein-P is a selenium-rich serum protein that carries more than 50% of serum selenium. We evaluated changes in serum selenoprotein-P levels in patients with inflammatory bowel disease. METHODS: Serum selenoprotein-P levels were measured by enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay. Twenty healthy individuals (controls), 34 patients with ulcerative colitis, and 37 patients with Crohn's disease (CD) were studied. RESULTS: A highly significant correlation was found between the serum selenium and selenoprotein-P levels. There was no significant difference in serum selenoprotein-P levels between healthy controls (average 3.4+/-0.8 microg/mL, n=20) and patients with ulcerative colitis (3.0+/-1.0 microg/mL, n=34). Serum selenoprotein-P levels were significantly lower in patients with CD (average 1.8+/-0.5 microg/mL, n=37). Serum selenoprotein-P levels were significantly lower in the elemental diet group of patients who had CD (average 1.4+/-0.4 microg/mL, n=17) than in the non-elemental diet group of patients who had CD (average 2.1+/-0.3 microg/mL, n=20). CONCLUSION: We found that the serum selenoprotein-P level is decreased in patients with CD. It may be a useful marker to monitor the systemic selenium status in various disorders.},

In the present study, we investigated the effects of the free radical scavengers edaravone and tempol in the development of experimental dextran sulfate sodium (DSS)-induced colitis in mice. Male BALB/cA mice were fed 4% (w/w of diet) DSS in standard powder chow for 8 days. Edaravone, tempol, or vehicle saline were then injected subcutaneously twice per day. After the experimental period, the colonic length, histological damage score, and mucosal myeloperoxidase (MPO) and serum interleukin-6 (IL-6) levels were measured. Edaravone (15 mg/kg/day) and tempol (5-15 mg/kg/day) suppressed the colonic shortening and the damage score. In particular, tempol at 15 mg/kg/day significantly attenuated the colonic shortening and damage score. Edaravone and tempol suppressed the serum IL-6 levels, and significantly suppressed the increased colonic MPO levels. These results strongly support the involvement of ROS in the pathogenesis of DSS-induced colitis. A clinical effect for edaravone and tempol in IBD patients is strongly expected.},

Postoperative complications occurred in 3 (30%) patients: 2 cases of wound infection and 1 case of a foreign body retrieved during pouch endoscopy. There was a 30% reoperation rate due to unsuspected duodenal perforation, a persistent postoperative pain, and 1 case of intestinal obstruction after ileostomy closure. There were no deaths. Median time to resumption of diet was 24 hours. Median hospital stay was 7 days. All ileostomies were closed 6 to 8 weeks after LAIPA.

Probiotic administration may recover the commensal microflora and normalise the host-microbial interaction. In this experiment, we cocultured colonic biopsies from active ulcerative colitis patients with bifidobacterium to investigate the modulation effect of probiotics on inflamed colonic tissues and its possible mechanism. Colonic biopsies from active ulcerative colitis were cocultured for 24 h with Bifidobacterium longum. Tumour necrosis factor (TNF)-alpha and interleukin (IL)-8 in supernatants were measured using enzyme-linked immunosorbent assays, the biopsies were fixed using paraffin and the expression of NF-kappaB P65 of tissues was studied using immunohistochemical staining. The concentrations of TNF-alpha and IL-8 in supernatants of tissues cocultured with probiotics were lower than those cultured alone. The number of lamina propria mononuclear cells (LPMC) with nuclear factor-kappa B (NF-kappaB) P65 positive in cocultured tissues was also decreased. When cocultured with inflamed tissues of active ulcerative colitis, probiotics could inhibit NF-kappaB activation in LPMC and down-regulate inflammatory cytokine secretion from inflamed tissues of active ulcerative colitis.},

Reports in Western literature have outlined the use of LACR for diverticulosis, ulcerative colitis, and Crohn's disease. We evaluated the use of LACR in patients with ileo-cecal tuberculosis (IC-TB) and describe our technique and results. METHODS: Twenty-six patients (20 F) between 16 and 45 years of age underwent a LACR for IC-TB over a 4-year period. Three access ports were used in 22 patients, four patients needed four ports. The cecum, ascending colon, proximal transverse colon, and terminal ileum were mobilized completely. The right colic vessels were divided intracorporeally. The specimen was delivered using a 5- to 6-cm incision. The ileo-colic pedicle and bowel were divided outside and an ileocolic anastomosis performed. After placing the bowel within the abdomen the pneumoperitoneum was recreated, saline irrigation done, and hemostasis achieved. RESULTS: No patient needed a formal laparotomy. Peristalsis returned within 48 h in 19 patients and after 72 h in the remaining seven. Oral liquids were started on all patients by the 3rd postoperative day (POD) and a soft diet by the 5th POD. Twenty patients had a bowel movement by the 4th POD and the rest by the 5th POD. Eighteen patients were discharged by the 5th day and the remaining by the 7th day. Three patients developed wound sepsis. Twenty-one patients could resume normal activity within 2 weeks, the rest within a month. CONCLUSION: Laparoscopic-assisted colon resection seems to be an ideal operation for patients with ileo-cecal tuberculosis. It has minimal morbidity and allows a quick return to normal activity.},

OBJECTIVE: To examine environmental risk factors prior to the development of inflammatory bowel disease in a paediatric population based case control study. METHODS: A total of 222 incident cases of Crohn's disease and 60 incident cases of ulcerative colitis occurring before 17 years of age between January 1988 and December 1997 were matched with one control subject by sex, age, and geographical location. We recorded 140 study variables in a questionnaire that covered familial history of inflammatory bowel disease, events during the perinatal period, infant and child diet, vaccinations and childhood diseases, household amenities, and the family's socioeconomic status. RESULTS: In a multivariate model, familial history of inflammatory bowel disease (odds ratio (OR) 4.3 (95% confidence interval 2.3-8)), breast feeding (OR 2.1 (1.3-3.4)), bacille Calmette-Guerin vaccination (OR 3.6 (1.1-11.9)), and history of eczema (OR 2.1 (1-4.5)) were significant risk factors for Crohn's disease whereas regular drinking of tap water was a protective factor (OR 0.56 (0.3-1)). Familial history of inflammatory bowel disease (OR 12.5 (2.2-71.4)), disease during pregnancy (OR 8.9 (1.5-52)), and bedroom sharing (OR 7.1 (1.9-27.4)) were risk factors for ulcerative colitis whereas appendicectomy was a protective factor (OR 0.06 (0.01-0.36)). CONCLUSIONS: While family history and appendicectomy are known risk factors, changes in risk based on domestic promiscuity, certain vaccinations, and dietary factors may provide new aetiological clues.},

METHOD: Using ESI triple quadrupole tandem mass spectrometry, the carnitine ester profile was measured in 44 patients with UC and 44 age- and sex-matched healthy controls. RESULTS: There was no significant difference in the fasting free carnitine level between the patients with UC and the healthy controls.

By contrast, the level of octanoyl-(0.147 +/- 0.009 vs 0.114 +/- 0.008), decanoyl- (0.180 +/- 0.012 vs 0.137 +/- 0.008), myristoyl- (0.048 +/- 0.003 vs 0.039 +/- 0.003), palmitoyl- (0.128 +/- 0.006 vs 0.109 +/- 0.004), palmitoleyl- (0.042 +/- 0.003 vs 0.031 +/- 0.002) and oleylcarnitine (0.183 +/- 0.007 vs 0.163 +/- 0.007; P < 0.05 in all comparisons) were increased in the patients with UC. CONCLUSION: Our data suggest selective involvement of the carnitine esters in UC patients, probably due to their altered metabolism.},

METHODS: Cases with CD (n = 364) and UC (n = 217), ages 18-50 yr were drawn from the population-based University of Manitoba IBD Research Registry. Potential control subjects were drawn from the population-based Manitoba Health Registry by age, gender, and geographic residence matching to the cases (n = 433). Subjects were administered a multiitem questionnaire. RESULTS: By univariate analysis, some of the variables predictive of CD included lower likelihood of living on a farm, of having drunk unpasteurized milk or having eaten pork, and UC patients were less likely to have drunk unpasteurized milk and to have eaten pork. On multivariate analysis, variables significantly associated with CD were being Jewish (OR = 4.32, 95% CI 1.10-16.9), having a first degree relative with IBD (OR = 3.07, 95% CI 1.73-5.46), ever having smoked (OR = 1.54, 95% CI, 1.06-2.25), living longer with a smoker (OR = 1.03, 95% CI, 1.01-1.04). Being a first generation Canadian (OR = 0.33, 95% CI, 0.17-0.62), having pet cats before age 5 (OR = 0.66, 95% CI, 0.46-0.96) and having larger families (OR = 0.87, 95% CI, 0.79-0.96) were protective against CD. For UC being Jewish (OR = 7.46, 95% CI, 2.33-23.89), having a relative with IBD (OR = 2.23, 95% CI, 1.27-3.9), and ever smoking (OR = 1.62, 95% CI, 1.14-2.32) were predictive. CONCLUSION: This study reinforced the increased risk associated with family history, being Jewish, and smoking history, however, a number of significant associations with CD and UC on univariate and multivariate analysis may support the "hygiene hypothesis" and warrant further exploration in prospective studies.},

   abstract = {INTRODUCTION/AIM: Patients with celiac disease (CD) can develop a gluten related autoimmune disorder that affects not only the small intestine but other tissues as well. An increased prevalence of autoimmune diseases has been reported, particularly autoimmune thyroiditis. The aim of this study was to characterize thyroid disorders in patients with CD. PATIENTS/METHODS: Fifty-two patients with CD (43 female, 9 male; mean age, 41.1 years) were studied. Nine were on a gluten-free diet (GFD). They were divided into four groups: Group 1, without thyroid involvement (n=30); Groups 2A-C, with thyroid involvement (n=22); Group 2A, subclinical hypothyroidism (n=11); Group 2B, clinical hypothyroidism (n=10); and Group 2C, other thyroid disorders (n=1). CD was confirmed by serologic and histologic criteria. Thyroid involvement was detected by measurement of thyroid stimulating hormone (TSH) and anti-thyroperoxidase antibodies (anti-TPO). RESULTS: Increased levels of TSH and/or anti-TPO levels were detected in Groups 2A (21.1%) and 2B (19.2%). The patients of Group 2B presented clinical symptoms of hypothyroidism before the diagnosis of CD, and 5 of these patients were receiving levothyroxine. One woman (Group 2C; 1.92%) had a medullary carcinoma. There was statistical significance between the age when thyroid disease was diagnosed (current age) and the age of CD diagnosis between Groups 1 and 2B. Patients with thyroid involvement presented associated diseases such as diabetes mellitus (2), Down's syndrome (2), ulcerative colitis (1), and dermatitis herpetiformis (2). CONCLUSIONS: Our findings demonstrated an increased prevalence of thyroid disorders (hypothyroidism, 19.2%; and subclinical hypothyroidism, 21.2%), and other associated diseases in celiac patients, even on a GFD, increasing with the age of the patients. Screening for associated diseases is recommended for patients with CD, independent of age at diagnosis or treatment duration.},

   abstract = {Alkaline sphingomyelinase (alk-SMase) is present in the intestinal tract and additionally human bile. It hydrolyses sphingomyelin in both intestinal lumen and the mucosal membrane in a specific bile salt dependent manner. The enzyme was discovered 36 years ago but got real attention only in the last decade, when sphingomyelin metabolism was realized to be a source of multiple lipid messengers, and when dietary sphingomyelin was found to inhibit colonic tumorigenesis in animals. The enzyme shares no structural similarity with other SMases and belongs to the nucleotide pyrophosphatase/phosphodiesterase family. The enzyme is of specific properties, such as bile salt dependency, trypsin resistance, high stability, and tissue specific expression. In the colon, the enzyme may play antiproliferative and antiinflammatory roles through generating ceramide, reducing the formation of lysophosphatidic acid, and inactivating platelet-activating factor. The enzyme is down regulated in human long-standing ulcerative colitis and colonic adenocarcinoma, and mutation of the enzyme has been found in colon cancer cells. In the small intestine, alk-SMase is the key enzyme for sphingomyelin digestion. The hydrolysis of sphingomyelin may affect the cholesterol uptake and have impact on sphingomyelin levels in plasma lipoproteins. The review summarizes the new information of alk-SMase from biochemical, cell and molecular biological studies in the last decade and evaluates its potential implications in development of colon cancer, inflammatory bowel diseases, and atherosclerosis.},

   abstract = {BACKGROUND: The aim of this study was to investigate the effects of mind-body therapy on neuroendocrine and cellular immune measures, health-related quality of life and disease activity in patients with ulcerative colitis (UC) in remission. METHODS: Thirty UC patients in remission or with low disease activity were randomly assigned to an intervention group (n = 15) or a usual-care waiting control group (n = 15). Intervention consisted of a structured 60-hour training program over 10 weeks which included stress management training, moderate exercise, Mediterranean diet, behavioral techniques and self-care strategies. Quality of life, perceived stress and disease activity were assessed with standardized questionnaires (IBDQ, SF-36, PSS, CAI). In addition, the distribution of circulating lymphocytes and lymphocyte subsets as well as the beta-adrenergic modulation of TNF-alpha production in vitro were analyzed. Urine catecholamines and plasma cortisol, prolactin and growth hormone were measured pre- and postinterventionally, and were compared with a healthy control group (n = 10). RESULTS: In response to therapy, patients in the intervention group showed significantly greater improvement in the SF-36 scale Mental Health and the Psychological Health Sum score compared with changes observed in the usual-care waiting control group. Patients in the intervention group showed significantly greater improvement on the IBDQ scale Bowel Symptoms compared with the control group. However, no significant group differences in circulating lymphocyte subsets or endocrine parameters were observed in response to therapy. In addition, no significant effects of intervention on either the basal levels of TNF-alpha or the suppressive action of the beta-adrenergic agonist isoproterenol on TNF-alpha production were observed. CONCLUSION: Mind-body therapy may improve quality of life in patients with UC in remission, while no effects of therapy on clinical or physiological parameters were found, which may at least in part be related to selective patient recruitment.},

   abstract = {BACKGROUND: Oral ferrous iron therapy may reinforce intestinal inflammation. One possible mechanism is by catalyzing the production of reactive oxygen species. We studied the effects of low-dose oral ferrous fumarate on intestinal inflammation and plasma redox status in dextran sulfate sodium (DSS)-induced colitis in rats. METHODS: Forty male Wistar rats were divided into 5 groups: no intervention, sham gavage (distilled water), ferrous fumarate, DSS, and ferrous fumarate + DSS. Ferrous fumarate was dissolved in distilled water (0.60 mg Fe/kg per day) and administered by gavage on days 1 to 14. All rats were fed a standard diet. Colitis was induced by 5% DSS in drinking water on days 8 to 14. Rats were killed on day 16. Histologic colitis scores, fecal granulocyte marker protein, plasma malondialdehyde, plasma antioxidant vitamins, and plasma aminothiols were measured. RESULTS: DSS significantly increased histologic colitis scores (P < 0.001) and fecal granulocyte marker protein (P < 0.01). Ferrous fumarate further increased histologic colitis scores (P < 0.01) in DSS-induced colitis. DSS + ferrous fumarate decreased plasma vitamin A compared with controls (P < 0.01). Otherwise, no changes were seen in plasma malondialdehyde, plasma antioxidant vitamins, or plasma aminothiols. CONCLUSION: Low-dose oral ferrous iron enhanced intestinal inflammation in DSS-induced colitis in rats.},

   abstract = {The prokaryotic and eukaryotic cells of the colon exist in a highly complex, but harmonious relationship. Disturbances in this remarkable symbiosis can result in the development of inflammatory bowel diseases (IBD). Although the etiology of IBD is not entirely understood, it is known that the chronic inflammation of Crohn's disease, ulcerative colitis and chronic pouchitis are a result of an overly aggressive immune response to the commensal intestinal flora in genetically susceptible hosts. Recent studies have enhanced our ability to understand the interaction between the host and its intestinal microflora and the role the microflora plays in maintaining intestinal homeostasis. As we begin to understand the benefits conferred to the intestine by the microflora, the notion of modifying the composition of the bacterial load to improve human health has arisen. A significant body of research now exists investigating the role of probiotics and prebiotics in ameliorating chronic intestinal inflammation. This article will begin with an overview of the role of the commensal microflora in maintaining mucosal immune homeostasis, and how a dysregulated immune response to the intestinal microflora results in IBD. This will be followed by a summary of the use of probiotics and prebiotics in experimental and human IBD.},

We therefore determined the effect of dietary amino acid supplementation on the microbiota, mucin status, and mucosal damage in dextran sulfate sodium (DSS)-treated rats. From 8 d before to 28 d after colitis induction, male Sprague-Dawley rats (10 mo old, n = 8/group) were fed a control diet supplemented or not with 2 different doses of an amino acid cocktail containing L-threonine, L-serine, L-proline, and L-cysteine. All diets were isonitrogenous (adjusted with L-alanine). The higher dose of amino acids increased the number of Muc2-containing goblet cells in the surface epithelium of the ulcerated area, stimulated mucin production in the colon, and restored the mucin amino acid composition and mucosal content to healthy, control values. The colonic mucin synthesis rate was specifically stimulated by 95%, whereas the protein turnover was unchanged. All bacterial populations, markedly altered by the DSS treatment, were promoted. In conclusion, in inflammatory situations, an increase in threonine, serine, proline, and cysteine dietary supply can promote mucin synthesis, reequilibrate the gut microbiota, and thus favor colonic protection and mucosal healing.},

   abstract = {The pathogenesis of inflammatory bowel disease (IBD) is complex, involving environmental, genetic, microbial, and immune factors. Therefore, treatment should target components that either predispose to or mediate the chronic inflammatory response of IBD. At the moment it is assumed that all components are necessary to have the typical manifestations of IBD but, in reality, it is unclear to what extent each factor contributes to the disease process, and whether some are more important than others. In addition, some factors are not practical targets; for example, environmental factors are poorly defined, too numerous, and require changes that cannot be implemented by the physician or the patient alone. The same is true for genetic factors that are still not amenable to therapeutic manipulations for technical and ethical reasons. This leaves microbial and immune factors as the two categories that can be selected for therapeutic intervention and where all current treatments are focused. The commensal gut flora can be qualitatively or quantitatively modified with antibiotics, probiotics, or diet, and a better characterization of enteric bacteria strains should help greatly in developing more effective therapies. Most current drugs are focused on inhibiting pro-inflammatory molecules produced by immune cells, including biological agents that block specific cytokines such as tumor necrosis factor-alpha. It is anticipated that combination therapies targeting multiple pathogenic components will prove more effective than those blocking single components of IBD pathogenesis.},

   abstract = {INTRODUCTION: Inflammatory bowel disease (Crohn's disease and ulcerative colitis) and irritable bowel syndrome are chronic, debilitating gastrointestinal (GI) disorders. There are no known causes of inflammatory bowel disease and/or irritable bowel syndrome. Both of these GI conditions significantly impair quality of life and the ability to complete activities of daily living. Unfortunately, there has been little education and research surrounding the evaluation of effective coping strategies with respect to GI disorders, particularly from the perspective of those diagnosed. As such, exploring the strategies of individuals with GI disorders would provide information concerning coping strategies from the perspective of those afflicted. PURPOSE: The overall objective of this research was to explore the lived experience of women who had been diagnosed with inflammatory bowel disease and/or irritable bowel syndrome. This article specifically explores the relationship between food and irritable bowel syndrome and/or inflammatory bowel disease. METHODS: Eight females, diagnosed with inflammatory bowel disease and/or irritable bowel syndrome, were recruited via on-campus posters from a university in southern Ontario, Canada. Qualitative information was collected in the form of background questionnaires, e-mail interviews, and face-to-face interviews, which were subsequently analyzed for trends. RESULTS: Every woman reported that one of the most significant means by which to cope with their condition centered around food consumption or controlling their food consumption. Subjects identified the importance of determining their "trigger foods," selecting healthy food choices, the impact of stress, and problems associated with food and travel. CONCLUSIONS: This research, predicated on the narratives of women diagnosed with GI disorders, substantiates the profound effect that food has on conditions of the GI tract. All of the women identified their relationship with food as a dynamic learning process, one that they thought would be a lifelong struggle. The implications for community health nurses in assisting individuals with GI disorders are discussed.},

   abstract = {The chronic idiopathic inflammatory bowel diseases (IBDs), namely Crohn's disease and ulcerative colitis, appear to be derived from an inappropriate reaction towards a luminal agent, most probably driven by the intestinal microflora, which upregulates the synthesis and release of different pro-inflammatory mediators, thus contributing to tissue damage that characterizes these intestinal conditions. Several studies have reported that IBD is associated with impairment in short-chain fatty acid (SCFA) production, mainly acetate, propionate, and butyrate. They are produced in the large bowel by anaerobic bacterial fermentation of undigested dietary carbohydrates and fiber polysaccharides, with butyrate being considered as the major fuel source for colonocytes. These SCFAs have been proposed to play a key role in the maintenance of colonic homeostasis. Therefore, it is reasonable to consider therapeutic approaches that increase colonic SCFA production, as it can be achieved by administration of dietary fiber to IBD patients. Unfortunately, there is quite limited documentation of efficacy of dietary fiber in properly designed trials. This review discusses the rationale, available evidence for the use of dietary fiber and its mechanisms of action in the treatment and prevention of IBDs.},

   abstract = {Undigested carbohydrates reaching the colon can act as competitors for epithelial bacterial receptors, making it difficult for noncommensal bacteria to adhere to them. On the contrary, fermentation of these carbohydrates by anaerobic flora produces - among other substrates - butyrate that is involved in numerous important metabolic processes. These include the provision of energy to the colonocytes, the enhancement of sodium and water absorption and the synthesis of mucus and cell membranes. In addition, butyrate inhibits the nuclear translocation of the transcription factor NFkappaB, which exerts a potent anti-inflammatory activity. Clinical experience with probiotics in inflammatory bowel disease (IBD) is controversial. Whereas some probiotic preparations appear to be useful in ulcerative colitis (UC) and pouchitis, most attempts to use probiotics for treating or preventing recurrence in Crohn's disease have failed. It should be pointed out that - unlike in the small bowel - the colon and ileal pouches are well-established microbiological ecosystems with increasing amounts of a wide variety of bacterial strains. These bacterial strains have a high degree of metabolic interaction with luminal nutrients and a greater probability of developing dysbiosis. With this in mind, the rationale for using pre- and probiotics appears to be stronger for colonic IBD (UC or Crohn's colitis) and pouchitis than for IBD mostly involving the small bowel.},

METHODS: One hundred and five consecutive coeliac disease patients and 141 controls (22 ulcerative colitis, 24 Crohn's disease, 30 primary sclerosing cholangitis, 15 postenteritis syndrome, 50 blood donors) were tested for anti-S. cerevisiae by enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay and for perinuclear anti-neutrophil cytoplasmic autoantibodies by indirect immunofluorescence. RESULTS: In coeliac disease anti-S. cerevisiae (immunoglobulin G and/or immunoglobulin A) were slightly less frequent (59%) than in Crohn's disease (75%, P = 0.16) and significantly more frequent than in ulcerative colitis (27%), primary sclerosing cholangitis (30%), postenteritis syndrome (26%) and blood donors (4%) (P = 0.009, P = 0.0002, P = 0.025, P < 0.0001). No correlation was found between anti-S. cerevisiae and degree of mucosal damage. Perinuclear anti-neutrophil cytoplasmic autoantibodies were detected only in one coeliac. After gluten free diet the disappearance of anti-S. cerevisiae-immunoglobulin A (93%) was more frequent than that of immunoglobulin G (17%, P = 0.0001); perinuclear anti-neutrophil cytoplasmic autoantibodies disappeared in the only coeliac positive at diagnosis. CONCLUSION: More than half of untreated coeliacs are anti-S. cerevisiae-positive irrespective of the severity of mucosal damage. Differently from immunoglobulin A, anti-S. cerevisiae-immunoglobulin G persisted in more than 80% after gluten free diet. The high prevalence of anti-S. cerevisiae in coeliac disease suggests that they may be the effect of a non-specific immune response in course of chronic small bowel disease.},

   abstract = {A large and diverse variety of bacteria have evolved and adapted to live in the human intestinal habitat in a symbiotic arrangement that influences both physiology and pathology in the host. Symbiosis between host and flora can be optimised by prebiotics. Inulin-type fructans have been shown to improve the metabolic functions of the commensal flora. Clinical and experimental data suggest that they also improve the gut mucosal barrier. Furthermore, modulation of the trophic functions of the flora by these prebiotics could help in the prevention of inflammatory bowel diseases. The anti-inflammatory effects of inulin or oligofructose have been assessed in the rat model of distal colitis induced by dextran sodium sulphate, which histologically resembles human ulcerative colitis, and in the trinitrobenzene sulphonic acid model that resembles human Crohn's disease. Both inulin and oligofructose stimulate colonic production of SCFA and favour the growth of indigenous lactobacilli and/or bifidobacteria. These effects are associated with reduced mucosal inflammation and decreased mucosal lesion scores. Inulin has also been tested in a placebo-controlled clinical trial in patients with relapsing pouchitis. Treatment reduced endoscopic and histological parameters of inflammation of the pouch mucosa. Inulin and oligofructose may offer an opportunity to prevent chronic inflammatory intestinal disorders, and this potential should be tested in further clinical studies.},

   abstract = {BACKGROUND: Genetics and environmental factors are implicated in the etiology of inflammatory bowel disease (IBD). We studied environmental factors in a population-based Swedish-Danish twin cohort using the co-twin control method. SUBJECTS AND METHODS: A questionnaire was sent to 317 twin pairs regarding markers of exposures in the following areas: infections/colonization and diet as well as smoking, appendectomy, and oral contraceptives. Odds ratios (OR) were calculated by conditional logistic regression. When confounding appeared plausible, multivariate conditional logistic regression was added. The questions were also divided into topic groups, and adjustment was made for multiple testing within each of the groups. RESULTS: The response rate to the questionnaire was 83%. In consideration of the study design, only discordant pairs were included (Crohn's disease [CD], n = 102; ulcerative colitis [UC], n = 125). Recurrent gastrointestinal infections were associated with both UC (OR, 8.0; 95% confidence interval [CI], 1.0-64) and CD (OR, 5.5; 95% CI, 1.2-25). Hospitalization for gastrointestinal infections was associated with CD (OR, 12; 95% CI, 1.6-92). Smoking was inversely associated with UC (OR, 0.4; 95% CI, 0.2-0.9) and associated with CD (OR, 2.9; 95% CI, 1.2-7.1). CONCLUSIONS: The observed associations indicate that markers of possible infectious events may influence the risk of IBD. Some of these effects might be mediated by long-term changes in gut flora or alterations in reactivity to the flora. The influence of smoking in IBD was confirmed.},

   abstract = {INTRODUCTION: The ileal pouch-anal anastomosis (IPAA) has become a standard procedure for patients with ulcerative colitis requiring surgical intervention. The technique has greatly improved and, since 1990, all patients at Huddinge University Hospital have been operated on with the double stapled technique. Pelvic sepsis is one of the most serious complications postoperatively, and, according to previous reports, leads to impaired function of the pouch and, in some cases, extirpation of the pouch. AIM: The purpose of this study was to find out if pelvic sepsis postoperatively after IPAA leads to impaired functional outcome at long-term follow-up. PATIENTS AND METHODS: One hundred consecutive patients with ulcerative colitis operated on between 1990 and 1997 with double stapled J-shaped pouches were followed prospectively with a standardised questionnaire, clinical follow-up and endoscopy of the pouch. The function of the pouch has been evaluated at a minimum of 2 years after surgery to compare the functional outcome between patients with and without pelvic sepsis postoperatively. RESULTS: Twelve patients developed pelvic sepsis postoperatively. No significant differences were found in pouch evacuation frequency, incontinence, deferral time, usage of protecting pads, skin irritation, evacuation problems, diet, usage of medication or social handicap. There was one failure in the control group. CONCLUSION: In this study, no evidence was found that suggested pelvic sepsis postoperatively impairs functional outcome after IPAA at long-term follow-up.},

   abstract = {A rapid increase in the incidence of Crohn's disease and ulcerative colitis in developed countries, the occurrence of Crohn's disease in spouses, and a lack of complete concordance in monozygotic twins are strong arguments for the role of environmental factors in inflammatory bowel disease (IBD). Research in the field of environmental factors in IBD is based upon epidemiological (geographical and case-control), clinical and experimental studies. The role of two environmental factors has clearly been established in IBD. Smoking is a risk factor for Crohn's disease and a protective factor for ulcerative colitis; appendectomy is a protective factor for ulcerative colitis. Many other environmental factors for IBD have been investigated, including infectious agents, diet, drugs, stress and social status. They are detailed in the present review. Among them, atypical Mycobacteria, oral contraceptives and antibiotics could play a role in Crohn's disease. To date, three hypotheses associate environmental factors with the pathophysiology of IBD (loss of tolerance of intestinal immune system towards commensal bacterial flora): the hygiene, infection and cold chain hypotheses. Much work remains to be done to identify risk factors for IBD. Research identifying environmental factors that might cause a predisposition to IBD is useful. It may lead to disease prevention in subjects who are genetically predisposed and disease improvement in patients.},

   abstract = {While tremendous advances have improved the understanding of inflammatory bowel disease, with regard to environmental risk factors as well as the biochemical nature of the inflammatory process, a determination of primary etiology remains elusive. Numerous theories have been proposed in the past century concerning the cause of Crohn's disease and ulcerative colitis with implications for specific therapies. On further study, most of these ideas and therapies have failed to be accurate in theory or therapeutic approach. Others remain untested or are the focus of current investigation and controversy. This paper reviews the dominant theories of primary etiology. These hypotheses include infectious causes such as Mycobacteria paratuberculosis and measles. Allergic and nutritionally related causes have been the focus of considerable research. Microparticles, which is part of the concept behind toothpaste as a cause, have been suggested more broadly to be the principal factor initiating Crohn's disease. Several of these concepts rely on the idea that there is an increased intestinal permeability that is the central defect leading to Crohn's disease. Rather than being an excessive T cell driven process, Crohn's has been suggested to be an innate immune deficiency, leading to the use of colony stimulating factors to augment the intestinal barrier function and innate immunity. A variety of changes in the gut flora, ranging from a basic dysbiosis to the absence of helminths, have been proposed as the root cause of inflammatory bowel disease.},

   abstract = {Because of the wide variations in the clinical presentation of celiac disease and because treatment exists that is effective in most cases, screening of the general population for celiac disease has been considered. There is still no evidence that patients who have symptom-free celiac disease are at increased risk of small intestinal lymphoma or other complications. Prevention of osteoporosis seems to be the strongest indicator for widespread screening today [22]. The major cause of failure to respond to a gluten-free diet is continuing ingestion of gluten, but other underlying diseases must be considered. Many different drugs (eg, anti-tumor necrosis factor [TNF]-alpha) have been used in patients who have RCD [23]. Steroid treatment has been reported to be effective even in patients who have underlying early EATL. Histologic recovery in patients who have celiac disease usually takes several months but can take up to 1 year, even if the patient remains on a strict gluten-free diet. Some patients report celiac-related symptoms for months after a single gluten intake. The definitions for RCD in literature vary. The authors consider the definition give by Daum and colleagues [24] suitable. They defined true RCD as villous atrophy with crypt hyperplasia and increased IELs persisting for more than 12 months in spite of a strict gluten-free diet. If a patient is not responding well to a gluten-free diet, three considerations are necessary: (1) the initial diagnosis of celiac disease must be reassessed;(2) the patient should be sent to a dietician to check for errors in diet or compliance problems, because problems with the gluten-free diet are the most important cause for persisting symptoms; (3) other reasons for persisting symptoms (eg, pancreatic insufficiency, irritable bowel syndrome, bacterial overgrowth, lymphocytic colitis, collagenous colitis, ulcerative jejunitis, protein-losing enteropathy,T-cell lymphoma, fructose intolerance, cavitating lymphadenopathy, and tropical sprue) should be considered. Other causes for villous atrophy are Crohn's disease, collagenous sprue, and autoimmune enteropathy. Abdulkarim and colleagues [25] examined 55 patients who had a diagnosis of nonresponsive celiac disease. He found that 6 did not have celiac disease, and25 still had some gluten ingestion.Tursi and colleagues [26] reported 15 patients who had celiac disease with persisting symptoms. Because histology improved in all patients after several months, RCD was excluded. Of the 15 patients, 10 had small intestinal bacterial overgrowth, 2 showed lactose malabsorption causing the described symptoms, 1 had mistakenly taken an antibiotic containing gluten, and 1 patient each had Giardia lamblia and Ascaris lumbricoides. Thus, other entities must be considered in patients who have celiac disease and ongoing symptoms. In a follow-up clinical trial, 158 patients who had celiac disease underwent follow-up small intestine biopsies within 2 years after starting a gluten-free diet. Eleven patients (7.0%) with persisting (partial) villous atrophy were considered to have RCD; 5 of them developed EATL [27].RCD type I is characterized by normal expression of T-cell antigens and polyclonal TCR gene rearrangement.RCD type II is characterized by an abnormal IEL phenotype with the expression of intracytoplasmic CD3e, surface CD103, and the lack of classic surface T-cell markers such as CD8, CD4, and TCR-alpha/beta. This clonal IEL population can be considered crypt IEL [24]. RCD II has a poor prognosis, which is a problem for therapy. Clonal TCR gene rearrangements and loss of T-cell antigens such as CD8 and TCR-beta in IELs may indicate the development of an EATL in patients who have RCD. The markers for an overt EATL are a positive stool blood test, increased lactate dehydrogenase, or beta2-microglobulin [24]. If an overt lymphoma is suspected, upper and lower endoscopy, an ear, nose, and throat work-up, CT scan, capsule endoscopy, and possibly double-balloon enteroscopy should be performed. Most reports of the difficulties in treating patients who have true RCE are casereports. Turner and colleagues [28] reported on an induction of remission by useof the anti-TNF-alpha antibody infliximab and maintenance with prednisoloneand azathioprine. Olaussen and colleagues [29] and Mandal and colleagues [30]tried a nonimmunogenic elemental diet. Gillet and colleagues [31] reported successful treatment of a patient who hadRCD using anti-TNF-alpha antibodies (infliximab) for induction and azathioprinefor maintenance. Maurino and colleagues [32] studied seven consecutive patients diagnosed ashaving refractory sprue and no response to oral or parenteral steroids. Aftertreatment with azathioprine (2 mg/kg/d) and oral prednisone (1 mg/kg/d), fivepatients had a complete clinical remission. Two patients who did not respond totreatment at any time died. Goerres and colleagues [33] described 18 patients who had RCD, 10 of whomhad type I RCD, and 8 of whom had type II RCD. Treatment consisted ofazathioprine combined with prednisone for 1 year. Consistent with reports byother investigators, the response rates in the two groups differed. Eight of the10 patients who had type I RCD had a histologic response. Seven of the eightpatients who had type II RCD died, and six of the eight developed a lymphoma. At present there is no effective treatment for type II RCD.Fig. 3 presents a proposed algorithm for monitoring patients who have ce-liac disease.},

   abstract = {OBJECTIVES: Previous studies have suggested that inflammatory bowel disease (IBD) patients rank high among users of complementary and alternative medicine (CAM). To further elucidate this phenomenon, we sent questionnaires to a large sample of IBD patients in Germany to determine the patterns and predictors of their CAM use. METHODS: Pretested 73-item questionnaires were mailed to a randomly selected representative sample of 1000 IBD patients from the approximately 16,000 members and associates of the German Crohn's and Colitis Association. Predictors of CAM use were evaluated by logistic regression models. RESULTS: Completed questionnaires were returned by 684 patients (female patients, 61.4%; Crohn's disease patients, 58.3%; ulcerative colitis patients, 38.2%). Of the 671 adult respondents, 344 (51.3%) had experience with CAM, and significantly more of the ulcerative colitis patients (59.8%) than the Crohn's disease patients (48.3%) had experience with CAM. There was no difference by gender. Homeopathy (52.9%) and herbal medicine (43.6%) were the most commonly used types of CAM. The most frequent personal reasons for CAM use were the search for an "optimum treatment" (78.9%) and the wish to stop taking steroids (63.8%). Using logistic regression, we found that total cortisone intake (P = 0.0077), but not duration of disease, was a strong predictor of CAM use. Other predictors were experience with psychosomatic and psychotherapeutic support (P = 0.0029), relaxation techniques (P = 0.0284), an academic education (P = 0.0173), a diet utilizing whole grains (P = 0.0123), and a normal body weight (P = 0.0215). Although 80% of patients indicated that they were interested in using CAM in the future, only 24.7% felt sufficiently informed about it. CONCLUSIONS: More than 50% of a large group of German IBD patients had used CAM. Prolonged or intensive steroid treatment, an academic education, active ways of coping, and a health-conscious life-style are associated with CAM use. Given the potential side effects and interactions, the treating physician should focus on thorough information about the benefits and limitations of conventional and complementary treatment options, especially for IBD patients who have received prolonged or intensive steroid treatment.},

   abstract = {OBJECTIVE: To compare safety and short-term outcomes of 100 laparoscopic ileal pouch-anal anastomosis (IPAA) versus 200 conventional open IPAA patients. SUMMARY BACKGROUND DATA: Outcomes of laparoscopic IPAA (LAP-IPAA) have been incompletely characterized. Previous reports are characterized by small numbers of patients and rarely include case-matched or randomized trial methodology. This report describes 100 LAP-IPAA patients case matched to 200 open IPAA patients. METHODS: Between 1998 and 2004, 100 consecutive LAP-IPAA patients (75 laparoscopic assisted, 25 hand assisted) were identified and case matched to 200 open IPAA control patients by age, operation, gender, date of operation, and body mass index. Operative and postoperative outcomes at 90 days were compared. RESULTS: A total of 300 patients (180 female) with a median age of 32 years (range, 17-66 years), and a median body mass index of 23 kg/m (range, 16-34 kg/m) underwent IPAA (100 LAP-IPAA, 200 open IPAA). Diagnosis (chronic ulcerative colitis 97%, familial adenomatous polyposis 3%) and previous operative history were equivalent between groups. One intraoperative complication occurred in each group. Overall, the laparoscopic conversion rate was 6%. Median operative time was longer for the LAP-IPAA group (333 minutes versus 230 minutes, P < 0.0001). LAP-IPAA patients had shorter median time to regular diet (3 versus 5 days), time to ileostomy output (2 versus 3 days), length of stay (4 versus 7 days), and decreased IV narcotic use (all P < 0.05. Postoperative morbidity was equivalent (LAP-IPAA = 33%, open IPAA = 37%), mortality was nil, and readmission rates were equal (LAP-IPAA = 21%, open IPAA = 22%). Reoperation was required in 3% of LAP-IPAA and 6.5% of open IPAA patients (P < 0.2) during the first 3 months. CONCLUSION: LAP-IPAA is equivalent to open IPAA in terms of safety and feasibility. In addition, LAP-IPAA provides significant improvements in short-term recovery outcomes.},

   abstract = {Crohn's disease (CD) is associated with a number of secondary conditions including osteoporosis, which increases the risk of bone fracture. The cause of metabolic bone disease in this population is believed to be multifactorial and may include the disease itself and associated inflammation, high-dose corticosteroid use, weight loss and malabsorption, a lack of exercise and physical activity, and an underlying genetic predisposition to bone loss. Reduced bone mineral density has been reported in between 5% to 80% of CD sufferers, although it is generally believed that approximately 40% of patients suffer from osteopenia and 15% from osteoporosis. Recent studies suggest a small but significantly increased risk of fracture compared with healthy controls and, perhaps, sufferers of other gastrointestinal disorders such as ulcerative colitis. The role of physical activity and exercise in the prevention and treatment of CD-related bone loss has received little attention, despite the benefits of specific exercises being well documented in healthy populations. This article reviews the prevalence of and risk factors for low bone mass in CD patients and examines various treatments for osteoporosis in these patients, with a particular focus on physical activity.},

   abstract = {Chronic inflammation is a well recognized risk factor for cancer and patients with long-standing ulcerative colitis (UC) are at an increased risk for colorectal carcinoma development. In order to prevent UC associated carcinogenesis, we tested the effects of inositol compounds (including inositol and hexaphosphate inositol) on UC-associated carcinogenesis in our novel mouse model. Female C57BL/6 mice were subjected to long-term, cyclic dextran sulfate sodium (DSS) treatment and fed a 2-fold iron-enriched diet. The inositol compounds were administered via the drinking fluid. In the DSS-plus-2-fold iron positive control group, colorectal adenocarcinoma incidence was 70.6% (24/34 mice) after 15 cycles of DSS treatment (1 DSS cycle=7 day DSS treatment period followed by a 10 day recovery period). Tumor multiplicity was 1.26+/-1.05 and tumor volume was 21.4+/-5.2 mm3. Adding 1% inositol, tumor incidence was statistically significantly reduced (42%, 9 of 21 mice with tumors), as was tumor multiplicity (0.5+/-0.7) and tumor volume (4.2+/-1.9 mm3). Administration of hexaphosphate inositol noticeably reduced tumor incidence (50%, 12 mice with tumors out of 24 total), tumor multiplicity (0.8+/-0.9) and tumor volume (12.3+/-4.1 mm3); however, the results were not statistically significant (P>0.05). Further mechanistic studies showed that the inhibition of UC-associated carcinogenesis by inositol compounds might relate to their function on the modulation of macrophage mediated inflammation, nitro-oxidative stress and cell proliferation in UC-associated carcinogenesis. This study indicates that inositol compounds may have the potential to serve as preventive agents for chronic inflammation-carcinogenesis.},

   abstract = {BACKGROUND: Patients with inflammatory bowel disease have a 10- to 100-fold increased risk of nephrolithiasis, with enteric hyperoxaluria being the major risk factor for these and other patients with fat malabsorptive states. Endogenous components of the intestinal microflora can potentially limit dietary oxalate absorption. METHODS: Ten patients were studied with chronic fat malabsorption, calcium oxalate stones, and hyperoxaluria thought to be caused by jejunoileal bypass (1) and Roux-en-Y gastric bypass surgery for obesity (4), dumping syndrome secondary to gastrectomy (2), celiac sprue (1), chronic pancreatitis (1), and ulcerative colitis in remission (1). For 3 months, patients received increasing doses of a lactic acid bacteria mixture (Oxadrop), VSL Pharmaceuticals), followed by a washout month. Twenty-four-hour urine collections were performed at baseline and after each month. RESULTS: Mean urinary oxalate excretion fell by 19% after 1 month (1 dose per day, P < 0.05), and oxalate excretion remained reduced by 24% during the second month (2 doses per day, P < 0.05). During the third month on 3 doses per day oxalate excretion increased slightly, so that the mean was close to the baseline established off treatment. Urinary oxalate again fell 20% from baseline during the washout period. Calcium oxalate supersaturation was reduced while on Oxadrop, largely due to the decrease in oxalate excretion, although mean changes did not reach statistical significance. CONCLUSION: Manipulation of gastrointestinal (GI) flora can influence urinary oxalate excretion to reduce urinary supersaturation levels. These changes could have a salutary effect on stone formation rates. Further studies will be needed to establish the optimal dosing regimen.},

Several factors probably contribute to the development of this condition. Recently discovered technologies have clarified the role of bacterial species, which may account for intestinal dysbiosis, as a factor triggering ulcerative colitis. Genetic susceptibility together with abnormal innate immunoreactivity probably comprise the essential prerequisites for the initiation and perpetuation of ulcerative colitis. Although the genetic background has been more clearly recognised in patients with Crohn's disease than in those with ulcerative colitis, some candidate loci associated with ulcerative colitis have also been intensively studied. Additionally, environmental factors may interfere with inherent predispositions to ulcerative colitis, and either suppress or reinforce them. Whatever the origin, the search for the aetiology of ulcerative colitis must have the same goal: the improvement of treatment and the quality of life in patients with ulcerative colitis.},

   abstract = {Ulcerative colitis (UC) is an acute and chronic inflammatory bowel disease of unknown aetiology, although bacterial species belonging to the normal colonic microbiota are known to be involved in its initiation and maintenance. Several organisms have been linked to the disease; however, mucosa-associated bacteria are more likely to be involved than their luminal counterparts, due to their close proximity to the host epithelium. Comparative bacteriological analyses were done on rectal biopsies to investigate differences in mucosal bacteria in patients with UC and healthy controls. Complex bacterial communities were found in both groups, with significant reductions in bifidobacterial numbers in UC, which suggested that they might have a protective role in the disease. Accordingly, a therapy for treating UC was designed, with the aim of modifying the mucosal microbiota to increase bifidobacterial colonisation and reduce inflammation. Ranges of mucosal and faecal bifidobacteria were tested for their substrate preferences and their abilities to survive under a variety of environmental conditions. A synbiotic comprising a probiotic (Bifidobacterium longum) isolated from healthy rectal mucosa combined with a prebiotic (oligofructose-enriched inulin - Synergy 1) was developed. The treatment was used in a randomised controlled trial involving eighteen patients with active UC, for a period of 1 month. Rectal biopsies were collected at the beginning and end of the study. Bacteriological analysis and transcription levels of epithelium-related immune markers were assessed. Results demonstrated that short-term synbiotic treatment resulted in increased bifidobacterial colonisation of the rectal mucosa and induced significant reductions in the expression of molecules that control inflammation in active UC.},

   abstract = {BACKGROUND: Prebiotics are short-chain carbohydrates that alter the composition, or metabolism, of the gut microbiota in a beneficial manner. It is therefore expected that prebiotics will improve health in a way similar to probiotics, whilst at the same time being cheaper, and carrying less risk and being easier to incorporate into the diet than probiotics. AIM: To review published evidence for prebiotic effects on gut function and human health. METHODS: We searched the Science Citation Index with the terms prebiotic, microbiota, gut bacteria, large intestine, mucosa, bowel habit, constipation, diarrhoea, inflammatory bowel disease, Crohn's disease, ulcerative colitis, pouchitis, calcium and cancer, focussing principally on studies in humans and reports in the English language. Search of the Cochrane Library did not identify any clinical study or meta-analysis on this topic. RESULTS: Three prebiotics, oligofructose, galacto-oligosaccharides and lactulose, clearly alter the balance of the large bowel microbiota by increasing bifidobacteria and Lactobacillus numbers. These carbohydrates are fermented and give rise to short-chain fatty acid and intestinal gas; however, effects on bowel habit are relatively small. Randomized-controlled trials of their effect in a clinical context are few, although animal studies show anti-inflammatory effects in inflammatory bowel disease, while calcium absorption is increased. CONCLUSIONS: It is still early days for prebiotics, but they offer the potential to modify the gut microbial balance in such a way as to bring direct health benefits cheaply and safely.},

   abstract = {BACKGROUND: The relapsing nature and varying geographical prevalence of ulcerative colitis (UC) implicates environmental factors such as diet in its aetiology. METHODS: In order to determine which foods might be related to disease activity in UC a new method of dietary analysis was developed and applied. Eighty-one UC patients were recruited at all stages of the disease process. Following completion of a 7 d diet diary, clinical assessment including a sigmoidoscopic examination (scale 0 (normal mucosa) to 6 (very active disease)) was conducted. Food weights for each person were adjusted (divided) by the person's calorific intake for the week. Each food consumed was given a food sigmoidoscopy score (FSS) calculated by summing the products of the (adjusted) weight of food consumed and sigmoidoscopy score for each patient and occurrence of food and dividing by the total (adjusted) weight of the food consumed by all 81 patients. Thus, foods eaten in large quantities by patients with very active disease have high FSSs and vice versa. Foods consumed by <10 people or weighing <1 kg for the whole group were excluded, leaving 75 foods. RESULTS: High FSS foods were characterized by high levels of the anti-thiamin additive sulfite (Mann-Whitney, p < 0.001), i.e. bitter, white wine, burgers, soft drinks from concentrates, sausages, lager and red wine. Caffeine also has anti-thiamin properties and decaffeinated coffee was associated with a better clinical state than the caffeine containing version. Beneficial foods (average intake per week) included pork (210 g), breakfast cereals (200 g), lettuce (110 g), apples and pears (390 g), milk (1250 ml), melon (350 g), bananas (350 g), bacon (120 g), beef and beef products (500 g), tomatoes (240 g), soup (700 g), citrus fruits (300 g), fish (290 g), yogurt (410 g), cheese (110 g), potatoes (710 g) and legumes (120 g). CONCLUSIONS: The dietary analysis method described provides a new tool for establishing relationships between diet and disease and indicates a potentially therapeutic diet for UC.},

However, laparoscopy in inflammatory bowel disease has unique challenges that must be overcome. For the patient with uncomplicated terminal ileal Crohn's disease, there are definite reproducible advantages to a minimally invasive approach. As surgeons gain experience, more complex cases may be attempted laparoscopically with a low threshold to alternate the approach if difficulties are encountered. We will continue to "push the envelope" in patients with complex Crohn's disease to allow more to be done in complex cases. For the patient with Crohn's colitis and ulcerative colitis, the role of a minimally invasive approach is less well defined. In experienced hands, a laparoscopic total colectomy can be performed safely and offers the patient all the advantages seen with laparoscopic segmental resection. Outcomes are likely to improve with better training, techniques, and equipment. As the field of minimally invasive surgery continues to expand, what is being "pushed" today will be routine in the future.},

   abstract = {IL-6/STAT-3 signals play key roles in inflammatory bowel disease (IBD). It is known that Lactobacillus casei strain Shirota (LcS) improves inflammatory disorders. This study aimed to elucidate the effect of LcS on murine chronic IBD and to clarify the mechanism. We focused the inhibitory effect of LcS on the production of IL-6 in lipopolysaccharide (LPS)-stimulated large intestinal lamina propria mononuclear cells (LI-LPMC) isolated from mice with chronic colitis and in RAW264.7 cells in vitro. We also determined in vivo the effect of LcS on murine chronic IBD models induced with dextran sodium sulphate and SAMP1/Yit mice. Finally, we examined the cellular determinants of LcS for the down-regulation of IL-6 secretion by LI-LPMC, RAW264.7 cells and peripheral blood mononuclear cells (PBMC) derived from patients with ulcerative colitis (UC). LcS, but not other strains of Lactobacillus, inhibited the production of IL-6 in LPS-stimulated LI-LPMC and RAW264.7 cells, down-regulating the nuclear translocation of NF-kappaB. The LcS-diet-improved murine chronic colitis is associated with the reduction of IL-6 synthesis by LI-LPMC. LcS also improved chronic ileitis in SAMP1/Yit mice. The release of IL-6 in vitro in LPS-stimulated LI-LPMC, RAW 264.7 cells and UC-PBMC was inhibited by a polysaccharide-peptidoglycan complex (PSPG) derived from LcS. This probiotic-induced improvement in murine chronic inflammatory bowel disease is associated with the down-regulation of pro-inflammatory cytokines such as IL-6 and IFN-gamma production in LPMC. Therefore, LcS may be a useful probiotic for the treatment of human inflammatory bowel disease.},

   abstract = {PURPOSE OF REVIEW: This review reports on the recent progress understanding mechanisms of action and clinical applications of probiotics. RECENT FINDINGS: New insights on regulating mechanisms of intestinal commensal bacteria to prevent and treat different gastrointestinal diseases have been reported. Some probiotics, though not all, exert beneficial effects by modulating the mucosal barrier function and immune activity. It seems that a combination of different probiotics is more effective than a single strain. It was demonstrated that not only viable bacteria administered to the intestinal tract but also isolated probiotic DNA is active, even if injected subcutaneously. There is reasonable evidence to recommend probiotics in infectious diarrhoea for prevention and treatment (mainly in children) and to prevent antibiotic-induced gastrointestinal side effects. Furthermore, probiotics are effective in maintaining remission in ulcerative colitis and preventing and treating pouchitis. Promising positive effects were published in major surgery patients (gastric resection, pancreatic resection, liver transplantation) and in severe necrotising acute pancreatitis. SUMMARY: Increasing knowledge on probiotics is exciting, but in the near future it must be defined which probiotics (single strains or a combination) are most effective in specific diseases. Well-designed, randomized clinical trials are still required to further define the role of probiotics as preventive and therapeutic agents.},

   abstract = {AIM: To investigate the influence of fish oil enriched enteral diet on intestinal tissues taken from Crohn's disease (CD), ulcerative colitis (UC) and non-inflamed non-IBD control patients in vitro. METHODS: Colonoscopic biopsies from patients with active CD (n = 4), active UC (n = 7), and non-inflamed non-IBD control patients (n = 4) were incubated (three dilutions of 1:20, 1:10, and 1:5) with Waymouth's culture medium and enteral elemental diet (EO28, SHS, Liverpool, UK) modified in the fatty acid composition with fish oil (EF) in an organ culture system for 24 h. In each experimental set-up, incubation with Waymouth's medium alone as control was included. Tissue viability was assessed by adding bromodeoxyuridine (BrdU) to the culture fluid and immunohistochemically staining for BrdU uptake. Cytokine ratio of IL-1ra/IL-1beta (low ratio indicative of inflammation) and production of those cytokines as a percentage of medium control were assayed in the culture supernatant. RESULTS: Incubation of CD-affected tissue with EF (1:20, 1:10, and 1:5) modestly and non-significantly increased IL-1ra/IL-1beta ratio as compared with medium control (CD 39.1+/-16.1; 26.5+/-7.8, 47.1+/-16.8 vs control 13.0+/-2.2), but incubation of UC-affected tissues increased IL-1ra/IL-1beta ratio significantly in all three dilutions (UC 69.1+/-32.2, P<0.05; 76.1+/-36.4, P = 0.05; 84.5+/-37.3, P<0.02; vs control 10.2+/-3.7). Incubation of non-inflamed non-IBD control tissue did not increase the IL-1ra/IL-1beta ratio in any dilution compared to medium control (69.3+/-47.0, 54.1+/-30.6, 79.4+/-34.0 vs control 76.1+/-37.3). Average percentage production of IL-1beta indexed against medium control was significantly less in UC after EF incubation as compared with CD (UC 24.0+/-4.8 vs CD 51.8+/-8.1; P<0.05). Average percentage production of IL-1ra was markedly higher in UC (135.9+/-3.4) than that in control patients (36.5+/-4.3) (P<0.0001). CONCLUSION: IBD tissues, after incubation with elemental diet modified in its fatty acid composition with fish oil, show an increase in IL-1ra/IL-1beta cytokine ratio. This effect of omega-3 fatty acid modulation is significantly more marked in UC compared with CD and is accompanied by both a reduction of IL-1beta and increase of IL-1ra. The positive direct anti-inflammatory effect of elemental diet with fish oil in tissue affected with UC suggests dietary treatment of UC may be possible.},

   abstract = {BACKGROUND: The irritable bowel syndrome (IBS) is a functional bowel disorder characterized by symptoms of abdominal pain that is associated with disturbed defecation. Crohn's disease (CD) and Ulcerative colitis (UC) are collectively referred to as inflammatory bowel diseases (IBD). IBD appears to result from dysregulated immune response with contributions from genetic predisposition and environmental factors. Among environmental factors the enteric microflora and the components of food (eg. antigens) may play important role in the pathogenesis of IBD. The aim of the authors' study was to detect IgE type antibodies against the most frequent food allergens in patients with IBD and IBS. METHODS: Antibodies against food allergens (IgE type) with ELISA method in patients with CD, UC and IBS were quantitatively measured. The figures were compared to the result of a healthy control group contains the same number of participants, and the frequency of food allergy in these patient groups were determined. RESULTS: On the basis of the study the presence of increased IgE type immune response against any food allergens was 34.5% (p = 0.01) in the group of IBS. In patients with CD or UC the immune response against food allergens was also more frequent than in the control group. The order of frequency of food allergens in IBS was the following: milk protein, soybean, tomato, peanut, egg white. CONCLUSION: As the occurrence of food allergens was significantly higher in IBS group than in the control group, the role of food allergy in the symptoms of IBS can be come up. The frequency of food allergy in patients with diagnosis of IBS, and the similarity of symptoms of this two diseases give an obvious opportunity for the patients with IBS to use a diet avoiding the most frequent food allergens, or take e.g. Na-cromoglycate which is useful therapy in food allergy.},

OBJECTIVE: The objective was to ascertain endogenous amino acid losses from the small bowel in human subjects consuming a protein-free diet or a diet with enzyme-hydrolyzed casein (EHC; MW <5000) as the sole source of nitrogen. DESIGN: The subjects were 8 men and women with terminal ileum ileostomies after ulcerative colitis who consumed the protein-free and EHC-based diets in a crossover design. Each subject received each test diet in single meals followed by 2 consecutive 9-h total collections of digesta. Digesta samples for the EHC treatment were centrifuged and ultrafiltered (10 000 MW cutoff), with the precipitate-plus-retentate fraction (>10 000 MW) providing a measurement of endogenous ileal amino acids. RESULTS: The mean endogenous flows for most of the amino acids and nitrogen were significantly (P < 0.05) higher when determined with the EHC-based diet than with the protein-free diet. Mean (n = 8) endogenous ileal nitrogen flows were 2061 and 4233 mug/g dry matter intake for the protein-free and EHC-based diets, respectively. CONCLUSION: The traditional protein-free method underestimates endogenous ileal amino acid loss in adults.},

The validated acute procedure was then applied using human ileostomates to determine apparent and true ileal amino acid digestibilities of 4 dietary protein sources. The acute method involved feeding ileostomized pigs a single meal containing the test protein as part of a purified diet, with no previous dietary adaptation, followed by an 8-h collection of digesta. Apparent ileal N digestibility did not differ between the acute and conventional (14-d study) procedures. Eight adult human ileostomates each received a single meal of protein-free biscuits and a drink containing sodium caseinate, whey protein concentrate, soy protein isolate, or soy protein concentrate; this meal was followed by a 9-h total digesta collection period. Acid insoluble ash was used as an indigestible marker. True ileal amino acid digestibilities (means +/- SE) ranged from 90.5 +/- 2.74% for cysteine in soy protein concentrate to 105.3 +/- 5.66% for cysteine in sodium caseinate and were markedly higher than their apparent counterparts. True ileal digestibilities for total nitrogen were 101.9 +/- 0.70, 98.3 +/- 0.80, 99.5 +/- 0.80, and 98.5 +/- 1.20% for sodium caseinate, whey protein concentrate, soy protein isolate, and soy protein concentrate, respectively. The 4 protein sources were virtually completely digested in humans by the end of the small intestine.},

   abstract = {BACKGROUND: Studies in animal models of inflammatory bowel disease (IBD) suggest that supplementation of total parenteral nutrition with glutamine (gln), a conditionally essential amino acid in catabolic conditions, increases gln plasma concentrations, reduces intestinal damage, improves nitrogen balance and may improve the course of the disease. However, human data supporting this assumption are missing. METHODS: A total of 24 consecutive patients with an acute exacerbation of IBD (19 Crohn's disease; five ulcerative colitis) and scheduled for total parenteral nutrition (TPN) (>7 days) were randomised. Parallel to a standardised anti-inflammatory therapy, the patients received either a TPN with 1.5 g/kg body weight of a standard amino acid or an isonitrogenic, isocaloric TPN with 1.2 g/kg body weight of a standard amino acid and 0.3 g/kg L-alanine-L-glutamine. Primary end points were gln plasma concentrations and intestinal permeability assessed by urinary lactulose and D-xylose ratio. RESULTS: Gln plasma levels did not differ significantly in either group throughout the study. Intestinal permeability did not change within 7 days either with or without gln supplementation (Delta-lactulose/xylose ratio: 0.01+/-0.05 (gln+) vs 0.02+/-0.1 (gln-)). The observed changes in inflammatory and nutritional parameters, and also disease activity, length of TPN and hospital stay, were independent of glutamine substitution. Five (41%) patients in the gln+ group and three (25%) patients in the gln- group needed surgical intervention. CONCLUSION: Although limited by the sample size, these results do not support the hypothesis that glutamine substitution has an obvious biochemical or clinical benefit in patients with active IBD scheduled for total parenteral nutrition.},

This role includes the prevention and correction of malnutrition, the prevention of osteoporosis and in children the promotion of optimal growth and development. In active Crohn's disease nutritional therapy (in the form of enteral feeding) is an effective primary therapy for many patients. Corticosteroids, however, are more effective than enteral diet therapy in adults. Enteral diets should be considered as primary therapy in pediatric Crohn's disease, especially in children with poor nutritional status or growth impairment. Enteral nutrition does not have a proven primary therapeutic role in ulcerative colitis. There are many theories that suggest that diet may be implicated in the aetiology of inflammatory bowel disease, however, there are, as yet, no dietary approaches proven to reduce the risk of developing IBD.},

   abstract = {BACKGROUND: Nitric oxide is a free radical produced in host tissues by constitutive and inducible forms of the enzyme nitric oxide synthase. Nitric oxide plays physiological roles, but it is also involved in the pathophysiology of several inflammatory conditions, including arthritis, ulcerative colitis, and circulatory shock. Local increases in inducible nitric oxide synthase (iNOS) and reactive nitrogen products have also been demonstrated in humans and animals with periodontal disease. This masked, randomized, placebo-controlled preclinical investigation examined the effect of two mercaptoalkylguanidines, mercaptoethylguanidine (MEG) and guanidinoethyldisulfide (GED), which are iNOS inhibitors and reactive nitrogen scavenging compounds, on the development of experimental gingivitis in beagle dogs. METHODS: Fifteen female, 1-year-old beagles first completed a 2-week dose-escalation experiment during which a maximum tolerated dose was determined for MEG and GED gels. Thereafter, all animals were brought to optimal gingival health by mechanical scaling, followed by rigorous daily toothbrushing over a 4-week washout period. Experimental gingivitis was then induced, with cessation of plaque control and institution of a soft diet over 8 weeks. Beagles randomly received 0.3% MEG, 0.3% GED, or placebo (vehicle) gels, topically applied twice daily to premolar teeth. Gingival inflammation, bleeding tendency, and supragingival plaque were clinically measured at baseline and at 2, 3, 4, 6, and 8 weeks. Comparisons among groups and between group pairs (active versus placebo) were made using Kruskal-Wallis tests. RESULTS: From baseline to day 7, all groups expressed similar indices. Thereafter, significant and time-dependent increases in the plaque index (PI), gingival index (GI), and percentage of bleeding on probing (%BOP) were observed in placebo-treated beagles. Mean GI scores for beagles treated with GED or MEG gels remained at or below baseline levels for the entire treatment period. At weeks 2, 3, 4, and 8, GI scores were significantly lower for MEG and GED groups compared to the placebo group (P<0.05). In addition, MEG and GED gels significantly reduced gingival bleeding responses by 8 weeks (P<0.05). Although placebo-treated beagles demonstrated %BOP scores of 43% at week 8, GED- and MEG-treated beagles exhibited %BOP scores of 21% and 26%, respectively. Since no statistical difference among PI scores was noted for any of the time points, neither mercaptoalkylguanidine appeared to affect supragingival plaque levels. CONCLUSION: The data from this preclinical study indicate that mercaptoalkylguanidines, topically administered, may significantly reduce experimental gingivitis in the beagle dog.},

   abstract = {The mechanisms that regulate ionic balance, fluid absorption and secretion in the gastrointestinal tract are complex. Disturbance of this homeostatic state by bile acids, bacterial enterotoxins and neoplasm-derived secretagogues, for example, can lead to diarrhea. Determining the causes of chronic diarrhea in individual patients may, therefore, represent a diagnostic challenge. The gastrointestinal tract has finely tuned mechanisms to maintain ionic balance, fluid absorption and secretion. To achieve this homeostasis, various ionic transport proteins/complexes are targeted to the apical, basal or basolateral membranes of epithelial cells. Na, K and Cl ion transport proteins are regulated by endogenous activators (e.g. cAMP, PGE2, Ca), dietary-related factors (e.g. bile acids) and through post-translational modifications (e.g. phosphorylation). In certain pathophysiologic states, this homeostatic ionic/fluid exchange becomes dysfunctional as a result of failure of compensatory pro-absorptive/anti-secretory mechanisms. The excessive secretion of Na and Cl ions followed by the release of a large amount of H2O into the colonic lumen results in diarrhea, which may be acute or chronic, and can be life-threatening if not ameliorated. Diverse infectious organisms (e.g. bacteria, protozoa, viruses) utilize different mechanisms to cause intestinal disease and diarrhea. These pathophysiologic mechanisms include alterations in ion transport, disruption of tight junctions and elicitation of inflammatory responses. Studies of patients infected with certain pathogens, those with ulcerative colitis and those harboring extra-colonic or colonic neoplasms have elucidated some of these pathophysiologic mechanisms of diarrhea. Determining the etiology of chronic diarrhea in specific cases may be a diagnostic challenge for both gastroenterologists and primary care physicians.},

   abstract = {Salicylate intolerance is defined as a nonspecific antigen-induced pseudo-allergic hypersensitivity reaction which can occur upon contact of an organism with salicylic acid, its derivatives or other related organic or inorganic acids of similar chemical structure. Since the effects of nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drugs (NSAID) intolerance are by no means always severe or life-endangering but may just as well present as oligosymptomatic or local disorders (e.g. abdominal pain, diarrhea, we decided to evaluate the characteristics of patients with salicylate intolerance on the basis of gastroenterological case material of Medical Department I of Erlangen University. On the basis of the findings from the Erlangen interdisciplinary data register of chronic inflammatory gastrointestinal disease, the signs and symptoms of NSAID intolerance were found to constitute a diagnosis of great practical import to clinical medicine (allergology, dermatology, immunology, other disorders etc.) including gastroenterology. For approx. 2-7% of all patients with inflammatory bowel syndrome and food allergies this poses a new diagnostic and therapeutic challenge which may concern physicians from any of the disciplines involved. When presented with patients with chronic active disease who are suffering from these symptoms one should, therefore, in future give greater thought to the possibility of salicylate intolerance, all the more as there are meaningful dietetic, diagnostic and therapeutic options available for these persons.},

   abstract = {Corticosteroids and 5-aminosalicylic acid are the primary standard therapy for inflammatory bowel disease. Recent immunologic data implicate an involvement of mast cell activation followed by increased histamine secretion and elevated tissue concentrations of histamine in the pathogenesis of ulcerative colitis. In the present case, the clinical course of a 35-year-old man with steroid-dependent chronic active ulcerative colitis, who did not respond to high-dose steroids, antibiotics, or azathioprine during 3 years, is reported. Clinical disease activity and established serological markers were recorded during 6 weeks of unsuccessful therapy and during the next 6 weeks, as a new nonsedative antihistaminergic drug, a mast cell stabilizer, and an hypoallergenic diet were implemented in addition to conventional therapy. Induction of remission was achieved within 2 weeks after treatment with fexofenadine, disodium cromoglycate, and an amino acid-based formula. Clinical disease activity, stool frequency, leukocytes, c-reactive protein, and orosomucoid levels in serum decreased rapidly. Daily steroid administration could be gradually reduced along with 6 weeks of this treatment. This report suggests that histamine and mast cell activity may be important pathophysiological factors responsible for persistent clinical and mucosal inflammatory activity in ulcerative colitis despite the use of steroids. In ulcerative colitis, patients unresponsive to conventional treatment, therapeutic considerations should also include an antiallergic approach when further signs of atopy or intestinal hypersensitivity are present.},

   abstract = {UC (ulcerative colitis) patients have an increased risk of developing colorectal cancer compared with the normal population. The cause underlying this higher risk is not fully defined but includes nutritional and environmental factors concomitant with genetic alterations. We aimed to evaluate genetic stability in the colonic tissue of UC patients in clinical remission compared with the healthy population, and to establish a possible correlation between nutritional habits and these molecular assessments. UC patients (n 42) and healthy controls (n 37) participated in the study. All participants were histopathologically and medically diagnosed. Participants completed five separate 7 d dietary records, food-frequency questionnaires and validated 24 h recalls for nutritional assessment. The extent of chromosome 17 loss and the calculated chromosome index was determined in colon tissue biopsies by fluorescence in situ hybridisation. Correlations between the molecular and nutritional assessments were performed using Pearson's correlation coefficients. Significant differences in the nutritional intake of total fat (65 (SD 15) v. 89 (SD 25) g), cholesterol (330 (SD 168) v. 464 (SD 177) mg), dietary fibre (32 (SD 4.7) v. 9 (SD 4) g), vitamin A (1009 (SD 209) v. 506 (SD 204) microg), vitamin C (308 (SD 108) v. 72 (SD 53) mg) and folic acid (412 (SD 89 microg) v. 187 (SD 107)) were recorded for UC patients compared with controls. Significant correlations were found for the consumption of different food groups and the chromosome index for chromosome 17. The results of our study suggest that the nutritional habits adopted by UC patients during clinical remission may affect key cellular components of the colonic tissue, inducing a high degree of aneuploidy and genetic instability, and probably affecting the development of colon cancer.},

   abstract = {To evaluate the role of dietary factors in the etiology of inflammatory bowel disease (IBD), we conducted a multicenter hospital-based case-control study in a Japanese population. Cases were IBD patients aged 15 to 34 years [ulcerative colitis (UC) 111 patients; Crohn's disease (CD) 128 patients] within 3 years after diagnosis in 13 hospitals. One control subject was recruited for each case who was matched for sex, age, and hospital. A semiquantitative food frequency questionnaire was used to estimate preillness intakes of food groups and nutrients. All the available control subjects (n = 219) were pooled, and unconditional logistic models were applied to calculate odds ratios (ORs). In the food groups, a higher consumption of sweets was positively associated with UC risk [OR for the highest versus lowest quartile, 2.86; 95% confidence interval (CI), 1.24 to 6.57], whereas the consumption of sugars and sweeteners (OR, 2.12; 95% CI, 1.08 to 4.17), sweets (OR, 2.83; 95% CI, 1.38 to 5.83), fats and oils (OR, 2.64; 95% CI, 1.29 to 5.39), and fish and shellfish (OR, 2.41; 95% CI, 1.18-4.89) were positively associated with CD risk. In respect to nutrients, the intake of vitamin C (OR, 0.45; 95% CI, 0.21 to 0.99) was negatively related to UC risk, while the intake of total fat (OR, 2.86; 95% CI, 1.39 to 5.90), monounsaturated fatty acids (OR, 2.49; 95% CI, 1.23 to 5.03) and polyunsaturated fatty acids (OR, 2.31; 95% CI, 1.12 to 4.79), vitamin E (OR, 3.23; 95% CI, 1.45 to 7.17), and n-3 (OR, 3.24; 95% CI, 1.52 to 6.88) and n-6 fatty acids (OR, 2.57; 95% CI, 1.24 to 5.32) was positively associated with CD risk. Although this study suffers from the shortcoming of recall bias, which is inherent in most retrospective studies (prospective studies are warranted to confirm the associations between diet and IBD risk), the present findings suggest the importance of dietary factors for IBD prevention.},

   abstract = {BACKGROUND & AIMS: N-3 fatty acids from fish oil, antioxidants, and short-chain fatty acids (SCFAs) produced during the fermentation of soluble fiber may attenuate inflammation associated with ulcerative colitis (UC). We assessed the efficacy of a nutritionally balanced oral supplement enriched with fish oil, fructooligosaccharides, gum arabic, vitamin E, vitamin C, and selenium on disease activity and medication use in adults with mild to moderate UC. METHODS: A total of 121 patients with UC and a disease activity index (DAI) from 3-9 on a 12-point scale were block randomized for extent of disease and smoking status. In addition to their usual diet, patients consumed 18 oz of the oral supplement or a carbohydrate-based placebo formula each day for 6 months. Clinical and histologic responses were assessed at 3 and 6 months or at the final visit. A change in average prednisone use between groups was tested by using a linear mixed-effects model. RESULTS: Eighty-six patients completed the study. Baseline characteristics were not different between groups except for a higher total DAI score in the oral supplement group (7.3 +/- 1.3; n = 36) compared with the placebo group (6.2 +/- 2.0; n = 50) ( P < .05). Both groups showed significant and similar degree of improvement at 6 months in DAI (-2.5 for oral supplement and -2.8 for placebo) and histologic index (-1.9 for oral supplement vs. -2.0 for placebo). Both intent-to-treat and completed patients given oral supplement had a significantly greater rate of decrease in the dose of prednisone required to control clinical symptoms over 6 months as compared with the placebo group ( P < .001). CONCLUSIONS: The improvement in clinical response combined with a decreased requirement for corticosteroids suggest that this enriched oral supplement can be a useful adjuvant therapy in patients with UC.},

   abstract = {Anemia associated with long-standing chronic inflammation and iron deficiency, and the increased risk for the development of dysplasia and carcinoma, are two of the most common complications in patients with ulcerative colitis (UC). Because of iron and nutrition deficiency, UC patients are encouraged to consume a high-protein and high-iron diet. The crucial clinical question is the effect of a high-iron diet on inflammation activity and inflammation-driven carcinogenesis. Is a high-iron diet a foe or a feat in UC and UC-associated carcinogenesis? This review updates the progress and information on (1) iron nutrition and iron-deficiency anemia in patients with UC, (2) experimental evidence of the exacerbating effect of a high-iron diet on UC and its associated carcinogenesis and the difference between a high-iron diet and parental iron supplementation, (3) the clinical efficacy of, and concerns about, oral and intravenous iron supplements in patients with inflammatory bowel disease and iron deficiency anemia, and (4) the clinical implications of long-term iron supplements and management of UC. These experimental findings from animal models provide evidence to warrant further consideration and clinical studies of iron nutrition, inflammation activity, and cancer development.},

   abstract = {Ulcerative colitis (UC) patients frequently require iron supplementation to remedy anemia. The impact of systemic iron supplementation (intraperitoneal injection) on UC-associated carcinogenesis was assessed in mice subjected to cyclic dextran sulfate sodium (DSS) treatment and compared with dietary iron enrichment. Systemic iron supplementation, but not a twofold iron diet, remedied iron deficiency as indicated by the histochemical detection of splenic iron stores. A twofold iron diet, but not systemic iron, increased iron accumulation in colonic luminal contents, at the colonic mucosal surface, and in superficial epithelial cells. Colitis-associated colorectal tumor incidence after 15 DSS cycles was not affected by systemic iron (2/28; 7.1%) compared to nonsupplemented controls (4/28; 14.1%) but was significantly increased by the twofold iron diet (24/33; 72.7%) (P < 0.001). Mechanistic study revealed that systemic iron had no effect on DSS-induced inflammation, or colonic iNOS and COX-2 protein levels, compared to controls. Systemic iron supplementation for 16 weeks replenished splenic iron in a spontaneous colitis model (interleukin-2-deficient mice) and significantly reduced colonic inflammation compared to interleukin-2 (-/-) controls without increasing hyperplastic lesions. These results suggest that iron supplemented systemically could be used to remedy anemia in UC patients without exacerbating inflammation or enhancing colon cancer risk. These findings need to be verified in clinical studies.},

There are similarities between the epidemiology of inflammatory bowel disease and that of respiratory conditions for which an adverse influence of salicylate has been identified. Natural salicylates exist within our diet. AIMS: To determine whether a lower intake of dietary salicylates is associated with less active inflammatory bowel disease and fewer concurrent respiratory symptoms. PATIENTS AND METHODS: Respiratory status, inflammatory bowel disease activity, quality of life, and dietary habits were established in 73 patients with Crohn's disease and 69 with ulcerative colitis, using a self-administered questionnaire and peak expiratory flow rate readings. Harvey-Bradshaw and Simple Birmingham/Royal Free Colitis indices, an internally validated respiratory score, and estimated weekly dietary salicylate intake, were calculated for each patient. RESULTS: There was at least one respiratory symptom in 63.4% of patients. The commonest underlying respiratory diagnosis was asthma. Respiratory impairment was similar in ulcerative colitis and Crohn's disease; 56.3% of Crohn's disease patients with an active respiratory diagnosis had other extra-intestinal manifestations. The dietary salicylate intake was independent of respiratory status, but inversely correlated with ulcerative colitis activity (dietary salicylate intake 37.0mg versus 21.4mg for low and higher Simple Birmingham/Royal Free Colitis index, respectively; p<0.02). A similar association was not seen in Crohn's disease. CONCLUSIONS: Respiratory impairment is common in inflammatory bowel disease. Higher intake of dietary salicylates is associated with less active colitis and possibly causally so.},

   abstract = {A physician's approach to patients with ulcerative colitis (UC) who are refractory to standard first-line therapies must be thoughtful and systematic and include the individual's physical and emotional state as the physician examines the various dietary, medical, and surgical options currently available. It is of foremost importance to confirm that the refractory patient's symptoms are not simply due to dietary indiscretion, concomitant bowel infection (especially with Clostridium difficile), an incorrect diagnosis (eg, colitis due to infection, NSAIDs, ischemia, diverticulitis, or Crohn's disease), or even a concomitant diagnosis (eg, celiac sprue, pancreatic insufficiency, functional bowel disorder, laxative or sorbitol intake). The ability to quickly assess the status of the colonic mucosa with flexible sigmoidoscopy aids in the ability to distinguish patients with refractory inflammation from those with other diagnoses. The initiation and optimization of the long-term purine analogues azathioprine (AZA) or 6-mercaptopurine (6-MP) remain the backbone of medical therapy for patients with refractory UC. For those unresponsive to corticosteroids, quicker induction of remission may necessitate infliximab, cyclosporine, or tacrolimus. Successful induction and maintenance with AZA, 6-MP, and/or infliximab should be followed by long-term therapy with these agents. Cessation of therapy often leads to relapse. Novel therapies under investigation hold the promise of offering more options for both the induction and maintenance of remission in refractory UC patients. Discussions of surgical intervention should not be put off as a last resort but rather included in the overall treatment plan offered to the patient.},

Patients from the Dutch Crohn's and Ulcerative Colitis Association were mailed a survey on food intolerance; 105 (31% men) of 137 patients took part. They all reported intolerance to one or more foods. Common symptoms (scored from 0=absent to 10=severe), included diarrhea (mean score=5.8), fatigue (mean score=5.5), and thirst (mean score=4.6). Spicy foods, cabbage, and citrus fruits (or juice) were most likely to decrease stool consistency, increase stool frequency, or cause perianal irritation. Onions, cabbage, or leeks were reported by 28% of the patients to cause flatulence. The urge to defecate was stronger after a cooked meal (45% within (1/2) hour) than after sandwiches (15% within (1/2) hour). Foods reported to increase stool consistency were potato products, bread, and bananas. This study demonstrates that food intolerance is a common, albeit mild, problem after ileal pouch-anal anastomosis. Food and nutrition professionals should encourage patients to base their food choices on individual tolerance as long as no (patho-) physiological-based evidence to the contrary is available.},

CLINICAL CASE: A 25 years old female patient treated with high-dose corticosteroids for 7 months for ulcerative colitis presents with both knees pain and limited hip and knee motility. In a plain X-ray and in nuclear magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) avascular necrosis was observed at these joints. Bone densitometry showed osteopenia at the femoral head and lumbar osteoporosis. DISCUSSION: We present a striking case for its large involvement of the joints (both knees and hips) with simultaneous osteoporosis and osteopenia in a young patient treated with corticosteroids for ulcerative colitis. It is necessary to recommend the judicious use of glucocorticoids, prescribing the minimal necessary dose and for the least amount of time necessary to control the underlying disease.},

   abstract = {Apart from a healthy diet and adequate exercise, early detection measures are applied in the prevention of colorectal. The hemoccult test continues to serve as a screening method. It it proves to be positive, a colonoscopic study should always be performed. Using this approach, 20-30% of polyps in the bowel and early cancer stages can be detected and removed as a prophylactic measure. The hereditary nonpolyposis colorectal cancer syndrome (HNPCC) and familial adenomatous polyposis (FAP) yare the most important risk factors for the development of colorectal carcinoma. However, patients with Crohn's disease or ulcerative colitis also have a greatly increased risk and require more intensive bowel cancer prophylaxis.},

   abstract = {INTRODUCTION: Ulcerative colitis (UC) and Lesniowski-Crohn's disease together constitute a type of intestinal pathology known as Inflammatory Bowel Disease. The etiology of UC still remains unknown, however some epidemiological data suggest the role of bacteria and viruses and also some habitual as well as environmental factors like smoking, diet, drugs, geographical and social status, as well as stress. The genetic predisposition is also suggested. UC affects young people in 2nd - 4th decades of life. Exacerbations of the disease may result in the necessity of surgical treatment, typically in the form of total proctocolectomy accompanied by the subsequent formation of ileo-pouch-anal anastomosis. The aim of our study was to analyze morphological pictures of resected specimens. MATERIAL AND METHODS: We analyzed 67 cases (40 women and 27 men) of UC with the special interest being focused at macro- as well as microscopic features of the intestines resected. We reviewed macroscopic characteristics of intestines (i.e. the length of resected fragments, localization, shape and diameter of the ulcers, polyps, number of resected lymph nodes), as well as microscopic descriptions concerning, among others the character and localization of inflammatory infiltrate, the architecture of glands, the presence of crypt abscesses and Paneth's metaplasia. Special attention was paid to the morphology of intestinal wall vasculature. RESULTS: In 42% of the cases macroscopically the inflammation covered the whole length of the resected colon. In 58% macroscopically detected inflammatory changes were segmental in distribution. In four cases the disease had clinically the fulminant course and the inflammation was transmural. There were 3 cases, in which histological assessment revealed the presence of malignancy (2 cases of mucus producing adenocarcinoma and one case of carcinoma in situ situated in the anal canal). Generally, microscopic findings were typical for the active phase of UC. We found intensive vascularization and hyperemia of the intestinal wall to be the common features accompanying the inflammation. CONCLUSIONS: Young people in the 3rd and 4th decades of life constitute the group being relatively commonly affected by the UC, and undergo the surgical proctocolectomy. Some of the cases present with the fulminant course of the disease. A rich vascular network is a common finding in the inflamed intestinal wall. We hypothesize, that intensive vascularization may play a significant role in the pathogenesis of UC.},

   abstract = {OBJECTIVE: To evaluate nutritional status and dietary habits of Lithuanian patients with ulcerative colitis and Crohn's disease and to compare with those of healthy controls. MATERIALS AND METHODS: A case-control study was conducted in the Department of Gastroenterology, Kaunas University of Medicine Hospital. A total of 101 patients with ulcerative colitis, 44 with Crohn's disease, and 178 healthy controls were examined with the help of standard self-report questionnaire about daily dietary habits. Healthy controls were evaluated in primary care centers during preventive examinations. Body mass index was calculated for all patients in a standard way. RESULTS: There was no statistically significant difference between patients and controls concerning consumption of coffee, tea, chewing gum, type of fat for meal preparation, white bread, cooked potatoes and sausages, non-carbonated water. Patients with inflammatory bowel diseases statistically significantly less frequently consumed fresh milk, cheese, fish, fried potatoes, and soda drinks. Patients with Crohn's disease statistically significantly less frequently consumed fresh fruits and patients with ulcerative colitis--fresh vegetables as compared to controls. Body mass index of patients with inflammatory bowel diseases was significantly lower compared to controls, and patients with Crohn's disease had significantly lower body mass index than ulcerative colitis patients. CONCLUSIONS: Patients with inflammatory bowel diseases have lower body mass index than healthy controls. Patients consume fresh milk, cheese, canned and fresh vegetables and fruits less frequently; therefore, primary care physicians and patients should be provided with teaching and more information about nutrition issues.},
