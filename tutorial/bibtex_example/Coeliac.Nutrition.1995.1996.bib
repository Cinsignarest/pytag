   abstract = {In recent years there has been a remarkable progress in infant nutrition, thanks to important development in the fields of nutrition, and food preparation and storage. The Istituto Superiore di Sanita (Italian National Institute of Health) has carried out the analytical control of the composition of infant foods present on the Italian market, and verified the nutritional quality and the presence, if any, of undesirable substances. Since 1980 the research has often required the development of specific and accurate analytical methods for these products. Adapted and follow-up formulas, cereal-based weaning products and those meant for subjects in special physiological conditions (premature, coeliac, allergic) have been analyzed, monitoring their qualitative transformation during the years. The main essential nutrients-proteins, lipids and minerals-have been assayed to evaluate whether the nutritional requirements of infants during the first year of life were satisfied. The protein and lipid composition of infant formulas was compared with that of human milk, and the influence of such feedings on plasma amino acid levels and erythrocyte fatty acids was assessed.},

   abstract = {To investigate the prevalence and clinical and genetic patterns of celiac disease (CD) among siblings of CD patients, 103 siblings and one twin of 80 celiac children were evaluated by means of their clinical history, physical examination, blood indices of nutritional status, and antigliadin antibodies (AGA). Antiendomysium antibody (AEA) levels were determined in 70 patients and 85 subjects were human leucocyte antigen (HLA) typed. On the basis of clinical or laboratory data or both, 21 siblings (20.2%) were submitted to intestinal biopsy, whereas intestinal biopsy in six siblings with positive serologic screening (AGA IgA or AEA or both) was not performed because of parental refusal. In a high percentage of cases (18%), all on a gluten-containing diet, the intestinal mucosa was atrophic, and CD was subsequently diagnosed. Because we could not submit all the siblings to intestinal biopsy, this figure could underestimate the real prevalence of the disease in our series; consequently, it was not possible to calculate accurately the sensitivity and specificity of AGA and AEA. Nevertheless, AEA (positive in all the nine siblings with mucosal atrophy), followed by AGA IgA, proved to be the best screening for CD. Eighteen of 19 CD siblings showed HLA-predisposing antigens. Among the 19 CD siblings, one showed a typical form with gastrointestinal symptoms, two had short stature, one suffered from recurrent vomiting, and in 15, the disease was clinically silent. On the contrary, among siblings who were first diagnosed (index cases), the majority (73.7%) had a typical form of CD, and no clinically silent cases were observed. We did not find any difference between index cases and CD siblings in food habits and distribution of HLA antigens. In 15 of 18 cases, the sibling diagnosed subsequently was the older one. Finally, the typical form of CD was significantly more frequent among the younger brother than the older. In conclusion, the high prevalence of the silent form of CD in our cases indicates that siblings of CD subjects should always be screened for CD. The combination of AGA IgA and AEA represent a good screening method to use in selecting children for the intestinal biopsy.},

Twelve patients with positive IgA antigliadin antibodies on two or more consecutive measurements underwent a small intestinal biopsy; four of them had a subtotal villous atrophy, and celiac disease was diagnosed; in another patient, a partial villous atrophy was observed. Children suffering from both diabetes and celiac disease showed an onset of diabetes at a younger age than did nonceliac patients.

Twenty patients (8 males, 12 females), mean age 14.2 months (group A) received an enzyme substitution preparation. The control group (group B) included 20 patients (9 males, 11 females), mean age 14.5 months, treated with placebo. Before starting treatment, we performed a stratification for age, weight-for-age at diagnosis, and degree of pancreatic insufficiency. The therapies were then administered randomly in double-blind fashion. On diagnosis and 30 and 60 days after commencement of a gluten-free diet with identical calorie intake in both groups, a series of anthropometric variables were determined. After 30 days weight increase in group A patients was significantly higher (in grams) than in group B: 1131 +/- 461 vs 732 +/- 399 (P < 0.006). Weight-for-age increase also was greater in group A than in group B: 9.2 +/- 5.1% vs 5.0 +/- 4.0% (P < 0.002). The increase in height Z score, weight-for-height, arm circumference, and subscapular and tricipital fold measurements were greater in group A patients than those in group B, but the difference was not significant. After 60 days of therapy none of the parameters considered were significantly different in the two groups. We concluded that pancreatic enzyme therapy is certainly useful in the first 30 days after diagnosis of celiac disease.},

A procedure was developed to sterilize the Watson biopsy capsule with HCl in the upper portion of the duodenum. Bacteria were counted in the mucosal homogenate of the first (diagnostic) duodenojejunal biopsy in 80 untreated celiac children, and in 46 children with irritable bowel syndrome (IBS) in a four-cell, controlled, randomized investigation. Persistence of bacteria on the mucosa for 20 h after the last meal was investigated in 62 subjects, and for 26 h after the last meal in 64 subjects. Bacteria, mainly streptococci and staphylococci, persisted at a concentration of 10(6) per gram of mucosa 20 h after the last meal. The number of bacteria per gram of mucosa was 24 times higher in all 62 children of the 20-h fast groups than in all 64 children of the 26-h fast groups (p < 0.001). The bacteria count in celiac children was 39 times higher in the 20-h fast group than in the 26-h one. This difference was significantly higher than the 11 times difference that was found on the normal mucosa between the 20- and 26-h fast IBS groups (p < 0.001), which was still significant. The number of bacteria on duodenojejunal mucosa depends on nutrient absorption and persists longer than the intermeal interval in these subjects.},

   abstract = {Coeliac disease is a chronic disease characterized by small bowel villous atrophy which impairs nutrient absorption and improves on withdrawal of wheat gliadins and barley, rye and oat prolamins from the diet. Knowledge of the adult form of coeliac disease has greatly improved in recent years. Although this knowledge is not yet sufficiently widespread among referring clinicians, it has, over the past few years, allowed an increasing number of patients to be diagnosed with subclinical forms characterized by minor, transient or apparently unrelated symptoms. As a consequence, our views on the clinical and epidemiological aspects of this condition, the prevalence of which in the general population is believed to be close to 1 in 300, have changed and are still changing. Since it has been demonstrated that a strict gluten-free diet is protective against the complications of adult coeliac disease, it is important that even subclinical and silent forms are diagnosed and treated as early as possible. Non-invasive screening tests, such as anti-gliadin and anti-endomysium antibody estimation, should therefore be used systematically in groups considered to be at risk of coeliac disease. These include first-degree relatives of coeliac patients and patients with insulin-dependent diabetes mellitus, iron-deficiency anaemia, epilepsy with cerebral calcification, recurrent aphthous stomatitis and dental enamel hypoplasia. Other conditions will probably be identified in the near future.},

We therefore conducted a study on children with active celiac disease to detect possible GI motor abnormalities in this disease. Fourteen children (age range, 1-13 years) were studied; they underwent fasting and fed manometric recordings in the gastroduodenojejunal area. Four patients were restudied after a 6-month gluten-free diet. Data were compared with those obtained in eight control children. As compared with controls, celiac disease patients showed a shorter duration of activity fronts (p < 0.01) and a significant (p < 0.01) reduction of the postprandial antral motility index; furthermore, > 90% of the patients displayed marked fasting and/or fed motor abnormalities, suggesting a neuropathic disorder. Interestingly, gut dysmotilities disappeared in the four subjects reassessed after the gluten-free diet. It is concluded that celiac disease frequently affects the motor behavior of the gut and that its effects may be reversed by appropriate diet.},

Subjects presenting with both CD and DH generally show an HLA pattern in which A1, B8, DR2, DR7, DQw2 are the most frequent antigens one can find. We report about 2 brothers presenting with DH, clinically asymptomatic, without antigliadin serum antibodies (AGA), but positive to the research of antiendomysial (EMA) ones. The biopsy performed by digestive endoscopy showed a complete atrophy of duodenal villi and the diagnosis of CD was confirmed according to the European Society for Pediatric Gastroenterology and Nutrition (ESPGAN) criteria. The diet without gluten caused the DH to recovery and the duodenal villi microscopic aspect to normalize as well. Both the brothers had the same HLA pattern: A1, B8, DR3-DR2, DQw2. Our clinical study suggests that it is very important, especially for the general practitioner, to recognize a DH and in every child presenting with a dermatitis like that it will be mandatory to perform a laboratory research of both AGA and EMA.},

   abstract = {The effect of pancreatic transplantation on noninsulin -dependent diabetes mellitus (NIDDM) had not been evaluated in animal models. We assessed its impact by the insulin-glucose clamp study in experimental diabetic rats. NIDDM was induced in Lewis female rats by streptozocin at the age of 5 days (n5-STZ). To determine its effect on insulin sensitivity, we measured the glucose turnover rate and performed euglycemic hyperinsulinemic clamp studies, evaluating hepatic glucose production (HGP) and glucose uptake. This assessment was conducted on 5 groups of 6 female Lewis rats: 2 groups n5-STZ tested at the age of 10 and 14 weeks, respectively; 2 normal age-matched groups; and a fifth group (n5-STZ) transplanted at 10 weeks of age and tested at 14 weeks. Heterotopic pancreaticoduodenal transplantation was performed, using an end-to-side anastomosis between the donor celiac artery and portal vein to the recipient infrarenal aorta and vena cava, respectively. Pancreatic drainage was achieved by an end-to-side duodenojejunostomy. At 10 weeks of age, diabetic n5-STZ rats showed decreased body weight, hyperglycemia, moderate insulinopenia, a significantly higher basal HGP as compared with normal controls (28.5 +/- 10 vs. 10.7 +/- 4 mg/kg/minute, P<0.05), and ineffective suppression of the HGP by the insulin infusion. Glycemia, body weight, and basal HGP were normalized in the transplanted group and were statistically similar to age-matched normal controls. HGP was totally suppressed by the insulin infusion. However, the blood insulin level remained significantly higher than in the normal groups (P<0.05). We conclude that n5-STZ is a reliable model of NIDDM and that pancreatic transplantation, without immunosuppressive drugs in this isogenic line, corrects all tested parameters of glucose homeostasis and improves insulin sensitivity.},

   abstract = {The association between Down's syndrome (DS) and celiac disease (CD) has been confirmed by several authors. The sensitivity and specificity of antigliadin antibodies (AGAs), the clinical features of subjects with DS and CD (DS-CD+), the incidence of CD, and the results of serological and molecular class I and II HLA typing were determined in a sample of 57 Sicilian subjects with DS. Six (10.5%) and 17 subjects (29.8%) showed high levels of IgA AGAs and IgG AGAs, respectively. AGAs sensitivity and specificity were lower than in the population without DS. Ten people with DS were submitted to jejunal biopsy, and seven (12.2%) showed CD according to ESPGAN criteria. All seven patients were put on gluten-free diet, followed by rapid disappearance of symptoms. Class I and II HLA serological and molecular typing was carried out in seven DS-CD + subjects, 22 people with DS without CD (DS-CD-), five subjects with CD without DS, and 20 controls. Between DS-CD + and DS-CD- subjects, no statistically significant difference regarding serum HLA class I antigens was found. DQA1*0101 allele appears significantly in DS-CD + patients and deserves to be searched for in a larger sample to assess its meaning in the DS-CD association.},

   abstract = {Celiac disease is a common cause of malabsorption in western countries, with significant geographic variation in incidence. Recent epidemiological studies using serology tests, however, suggest that the disease is more common than previously realized and homogeneously distributed in Europe. These studies have also demonstrated that the clinical presentation of the disease may greatly vary even between neighboring countries. Celiac disease remains a rare diagnosis in the United States. Whether the disease is underdiagnosed or is truly rare remains to be established. We have conducted preliminary studies, both on pediatric patients and adult blood donors, that seem to suggest that the prevalence of positive screening tests for celiac disease in the USA is equivalent to that reported in similar screening studies conducted in Europe. These data also suggest that the dimensions of the American celiac disease iceberg seem to be similar to those of the European one. The visible tip of the American iceberg, however, appears to be much smaller, since most of it still remains submerged. The reasons for these divergences remain unknown and may only be partially related to the limited attention to the disease by the American scientific community. Large, multicenter serological screening studies are needed to define the true prevalence of celiac disease in the United States.},

The children had watery diarrhea of neonatal onset requiring total parenteral nutrition. Two had siblings who had died of diarrhea in the first year of life; two others are sisters. Repeated duodenal or jejunal biopsies revealed villous atrophy with normal or hyperplastic and regenerative cryptae, normal cellularity of the lamina mesenterii propria, and no signs of T-cell activation. The main histologic features are epithelial dysplasia with focal crowding and disorganization of the surface enterocytes, pseudocystic formation of the glands, and abnormal regenerative cryptae. The basement membrane components were studied with polyclonal antibodies on frozen specimens, and were compared with biopsy specimens from patients with celiac disease or autoimmune enteropathy. Relative to the control subjects, there was faint and irregular deposition of laminin at the epithelium-lamina mesenterii propria interface, whereas deposits of heparan sulfate proteoglycan were large and lamellar. The primary or secondary nature of these modifications of the basement membrane remains to be determined, but the modifications might be related to epithelial abnormalities and to the severity of this neonatal diarrhea, which resisted all treatment and necessitated permanent total parenteral nutrition.},

   abstract = {Severe and protracted diarrhea (SPD) is the most severe form of diarrhea in infancy and has also been defined as intractable diarrhea. Its etiology is poorly defined. We have retrospectively evaluated the etiology, the outcome, and the risk factors of 38 children, admitted with protracted diarrhea and need for total parenteral nutrition (TPN) from 1977 to 1993. Children with anatomic abnormalities and/or primary immunodeficiency were excluded. There was an inverse relationship between the number of patients and the age of diarrheal onset (mean age, 2.9 +/- 3.5 months). Etiology of SPD was an enteric infection in 18 cases (eight Salmonella, three Staphylococcus, five rotavirus, one adenovirus, one Cryptosporidium), multiple alimentary intolerance (eight cases), familial microvillous atrophy (two), autoimmune enteropathy (two), celiac disease, lymphangectasia, eosinophilic enteropathy, intestinal pseudoobstruction, and intestinal neurodysplasia (1 case each). Etiology was not detected in three cases. Overall, 12 children died, five are presently being treated, and 21 had full remission. Comparative evaluation of risk factors between children with SPD and a control population of children with diarrhea but without the need for TPN showed that low birth weight, no breast feeding, history of fatal diarrhea in a relative, and early onset of diarrhea had a significantly higher incidence in the former. Social background was similar in the two populations. We conclude that a specific etiology can be identified in the majority of cases of SPD. The etiologic spectrum of SPD is broad, but an enteric infection is the most common cause of SPD. The severity of this condition is related, at least in part, to established risk factors.},

Preoperative arteriography and intraoperative findings at laparotomy showed a thrombosis of coeliac trunc, superior and inferior mesenteric arteries, originating possibly from a non atheromatous ostial stenosis of these vessels. The blood supply to stomach, duodenum, liver and spleen was maintained through collaterals from diaphragm. Postoperatively a dehiscence of duodenostomy suture occurred with a spontaneous favourable outcome. The closure of external duodenostomy orifice required an endoscopic aspirational gastrostomy. The patient was discharged with the perspective of intestinal transplantation, her nutrition being provided through an ambulatory parenteral nutritional support unit. A symptomatology of chronic mesenteric ischaemia should lead to an angiography of digestive arteries not only with a diagnostic but also a possible therapeutic goal using angioplasty techniques.},

   abstract = {HISTORY AND FINDINGS: A 45-year-old man with type I diabetes mellitus was admitted to hospital because of colicky abdominal pain and 5-6 watery stools daily. Upper gastrointestinal endoscopy showed nearly total atrophy of the villi in the duodenum and jejunum suggesting coeliac disease. However, gluten-free diet for 2 weeks brought no improvement. Another examination of the biopsy 6 weeks after the first endoscopy revealed extensive collagen deposition in the lamina propria of the small intestine, giving the diagnosis of collagenous sprue. TREATMENT AND COURSE: Parenteral nutrition, lactulose, cisapride, cholestyramine, doxycycline, paromomycin, vancomycin and octreotide failed to affect the loss of fluid from the gut which 12 weeks after admission had increased to 221 daily. However, it was stopped after prednisolone was administered (100mg daily). 7 months after starting the steroid treatment the collagen layer had disappeared and the villous atrophy had partially regressed. Over the next 6 months the prednisolone dosage was decreased to 10 mg daily. Shortly thereafter a perimembranous glomerulonephritis occurred, with proteinuria (up to 60 g/d) and oedema. It regressed to 6 g/d when the steroid dose was increased and cyclosporin, 0.5 g/d, had been added. On maintenance dosage of cyclosporin the histological and clinical remission of the collagenous sprue has now lasted for over 2 years. CONCLUSIONS: This case suggests that steroid administration is an effective treatment of collagenous sprue. The presence of diabetes and other immune-related diseases in this case also suggests that an immunological mechanism may play a causative role in collagenous sprue.},

For all eligible subjects, a detailed questionnaire concerning characteristics of abdominal pain and defecatory pattern was completed at presentation. In addition, a battery of screening tests was performed and additional evaluation was done at the discretion of their physician. In all, 227 subjects fulfilled the entrance criteria, but 56 were subsequently excluded because of diagnoses of inflammatory bowel disease (nine cases), lactose malabsorption (46 cases), or celiac disease (one case). Of the remaining 171 patients, 117 had IBS symptoms. In the IBS subjects, lower abdominal discomfort (p < 0.001), cramping pain (p < 0.0009), and increased flatus (p < 0.0003) were more common, whereas dyspeptic symptoms such as epigastric discomfort (p < 0.003), pain radiating to the chest (p < 0.009), and regurgitation (p < 0.02) were more common in the non-IBS subjects. Our study not only confirms the clinical heterogeneity of children with recurrent abdominal pain but also concomitantly demonstrates that most children with this disorder have symptoms that fulfill the standardized criteria for IBS in adults. The identification of subgroups of children with recurrent abdominal pain can provide a framework for the diagnosis of functional bowel disease as well as establish the need for invasive and expensive tests.},

In control rats, hepatic vagotomy destroyed circadian rhythms of plasma glucose and insulin probably due to removal of afferent function.

METHODS: In a randomized trial, we compared the effects of gluten-free diets without oats and with oats (with a goal of 50 to 70 g per day from three sources: two types of wheat-starch flour mixed with an equal amount of oats, muesli containing 60 percent oats, and rolled-oat breakfast cereal). Fifty-two adults with celiac disease in remission were followed for 6 months and 40 with newly diagnosed disease for 12 months. Endoscopy with duodenal biopsy was performed at the beginning and end of the study. RESULTS: The mean (+/- SD) oat intake in the oat group was 49.9 +/- 14.7 g per day at 6 months for patients in remission and 46.6 +/- 13.3 g per day at 12 months for patients with newly diagnosed disease. The oat and control groups did not differ significantly in nutritional status, symptoms, or laboratory measures. Patients in remission, regardless of diet, did not have worsening architecture of the duodenal villi or increased mononuclear-cell infiltration. All the patients with new diagnoses were in remission at one year, except for one in the control group. Six patients in the oat groups and five in the control group withdrew from the study. CONCLUSIONS: Moderate amounts of oats can be included in a gluten-free diet for most adult patients with celiac disease without adverse effects.},

Absorptive capacity and intestinal permeability were assessed using 3-O-methyl-D-glucose, D-xylose, L-rhamnose, and lactulose in 88 HIV infected patients and the findings were correlated with the degree of immunosuppression (CD4 counts), diarrhoea, wasting, intestinal pathogen status, and histomorphometric analysis of jejunal biopsy samples. Malabsorption of 3-O-methyl-D-glucose and D-xylose was prevalent in all groups of patients with AIDS but not in asymptomatic, well patients with HIV. Malabsorption correlated significantly (r = 0.34-0.56, p < 0.005) with the degree of immune suppression and with body mass index. Increased intestinal permeability was found in all subgroups of patients. The changes in absorption-permeability were of comparable severity to those found in patients with untreated coeliac disease. Jejunal histology, however, showed only mild changes in the villus height/crypt depth ratio as compared with subtotal villus atrophy in coeliac disease. Malabsorption and increased intestinal permeability are common in AIDS patients. Malabsorption, which has nutritional implications, relates more to immune suppression than jejunal morphological changes.},

METHODS: Forty untreated and 52 coeliac patients in remission were admitted to the study. The control group included 77 persons. Four-day food records, anthropometric measurements, and blood biochemistry were examined to obtain nutrient intake and nutritional status. RESULTS: Concentrations of serum ferritin, vitamin B12, and erythrocyte folate were lower in patients with untreated coeliac disease than in those in remission. Altogether, 15-38% of the untreated patients but only 0-20% of the patients in remission had levels of haemoglobin, serum ferritin, iron, vitamin B12, or erythrocyte folate below the reference values. No difference in anthropometric measurements was found between the two groups of coeliac patients. CONCLUSIONS: Except for some subclinical abnormal values in biochemical analyses in 20-38% of coeliac patients, nutritional status was quite normal in both groups of coeliac patients.},

   abstract = {Multiple infectious causes of diarrhea are known in patients with HIV/AIDS. Maldigestion and malabsorption have been reported in patients with HIV/AIDS and may be independent of infectious etiologies. Among ambulatory patients with HIV/AIDS, we examined the prevalence of fat malabsorption (steatorrhea). Sixty-one patients with unexplained diarrhea (defined as > 2 stools/d) and/or weight loss despite adequate caloric intake (and without clinical evidence of chronic pancreatitis) were evaluated in our outpatient Gastroenterology-Nutrition Clinic between March 1, 1993, and July 1994. Patients were instructed by a dietitian to follow a > or = 100 g/d fat diet for 24 h before submitting a stool sample for qualitative (or quantitative) fecal fat determination. Forty-five patients, 32 with ongoing diarrhea and 13 without diarrhea, submitted stool samples. Twenty-two of 45 patients (49%) had qualitative or quantitative steatorrhea, 16/32 with diarrhea (50%) and 6/13 patients without diarrhea (46%). Thirty of 32 patients with diarrhea had had extensive microbiologic and/or endoscopic evaluations. Only 9 patients had a detectable intestinal pathogen, 5 patients had cytomegalovirus (4 treated), 4 patients had cryptosporidia (3 treated), and 1 patient had microsporidia. Steatorrhea, as determined by abnormal qualitative fecal fat, is detectable in nearly 50% of patients with HIV/AIDS. Fat malabsorption appears to be a primary defect in these patients independent of detectable pathogens. Assessment of fat malabsorption should be considered in patients with unexplained weight loss or diarrhea before extensive evaluation for opportunistic infections.},

We studied the permeability to human alpha-lactalbumin, beta-lactoglobulin, mannitol, and lactulose on 46 occasions in 33 celiac disease patients in various phases of the disease; in addition, mannitol and lactulose permeability was studied in 18 healthy controls. Lactalbumin absorption was detected in 19 of 42 patients tested, more often in celiac disease patients with villous atrophy than in those with normal jejunal biopsy (p = 0.01). Higher absorption of lactalbumin was found in patients with subtotal villous atrophy than in those with normal biopsy (p = 0.02). beta-lactoglobulin was found in four of 42 patients tested. Less mannitol was absorbed by patients with either subtotal or partial villous atrophy than by those with normal histology (p = 0.001 and 0.006, respectively). Lactulose recovery was higher in newly diagnosed patients and patients with subtotal villous atrophy than in controls (p = 0.007 and 0.03, respectively). The lactulose/mannitol ratio was higher in newly diagnosed patients and patients with villous atrophy than in controls (p = 0.002 and 0.002, respectively). The correlation between permeability to lactalbumin and mannitol and lactulose was poor. We conclude that permeability to proteins and sugar molecules is abnormal in celiac disease patients with mucosal damage and that they probably reflect different mechanisms of penetration.},

The diagnosed was made before 30 months of age in 50% of cases. Average treatment duration was 69.8 +/- 36 months. The randomly selected control group was composed of 48 school age children, of the same age and sex of patients. Total bone mass (TBM) and bone mineral density (BMD) were expressed as Z scores on the basis of normal values established by the authors in Chilean children. Celiac patients had lower TBM and BMD of whole body, than controls (-1.11 +/- 0.94 vs 0.00 +/- 0.85 and -0.59 +/- 0.76 vs 0.06 +/- 0.84, respectively) and at the spine (-0.79 +/- 1.04 vs 0.003 +/- 0.92 and -1.49 +/- 0.99 vs 0.06 +/- 0.87 respectively). A lower TBM was founded at the hip (-0.62 +/- 1.28 vs -0.08 +/- 0.82) without differences in BMD. Celiac patients had a lower bone mass than controls despite early diagnosis and good compliance with the gluten-free diet. These differences could not be atributed entirely to the lower height of celiac patients. These results suggest that celiac patients constitute a risk group for development of osteoporosis later in life. This fact should be taken into consideration in the treatment of this condition.},

The 70Zn enrichment of serum was found closely to obey two-compartment kinetics and the derived two-compartment decay equation was used to calculate the size and turnover of the two initial rapidly exchanging pools of body Zn. In normal Irish setters isotopic Zn initially equilibrates with a pool (a) of size 1.27 (SD 0.46) mumol/kg and then with a second pool (b) of size 6.83 (SD 1.72) mumol/kg. The fractional turnover of pool (b) was approximately one eighth that of pool (a). Enteropathic dogs showed no reduction in the size of either rapidly exchangeable Zn pool, reduction in serum Zn concentration or abnormality in Zn balance and hence these results do not support the possibility of an underlying Zn deficiency in this disorder.},

The aims of this study were: 1) To evaluate the nutritional status of asymptomatic patients with newly diagnosed celiac disease, and 2) to compare these findings with those of untreated/symptomatic and treated patients. MATERIAL: We examined 41 patients with celiac disease divided into three groups: a) 8 asymptomatic (diagnosed in a study of first-degree relatives of probands), b) 20 untreated/symptomatic patients, and c) 13 treated patients. Nutrition of patients from groups A and B was assessed at the time of diagnosis. METHODS: Nutritional status was evaluated by: 1) body composition (fat and lean mass) by dual energy x-ray absorptiometry (DEXA), and 2) anthropometric measurements. RESULTS: Compared with sex and age matched controls (n = 153), asymptomatic patients presented a moderate but significant reduction of the fat compartment (-29%; p < 0.001), but not of the lean-tissue mass (p = NS). Untreated/symptomatic patients showed a more severe depletion of fat (-46%; p < 0.001) and lean mass (-9.0%; p < 0.05) compared with healthy controls. Although fat mass of treated patients was significantly reduced with respect to controls (-24%; p < 0.003), lean mass was not affected. The anthropometric measurements of fat showed a significant correlation with the evaluation by DEXA (multiple regression analysis r = 0.918). CONCLUSION: Asymptomatic patients in our study with an unequivocal diagnosis of celiac disease established by mucosal biopsy exhibited a modified body composition.},

The aim of this study was to use the scanning electron microscope (SEM) to examine the surface of the jejunal mucosa of children with chronic nonspecific diarrhea (CNSD) (n = 9) and to compare the findings with specimens obtained from children with (n = 21) and without (n = 11) other gastrointestinal diseases. Light microscopy of the specimens from children with CNSD was normal. However, SEM showed the presence of bacterial colonization with predominantly coccoid organisms in 100% of cases. This colonization was associated with loss of glycocalyx and clumping of the microvilli. The children with celiac disease (n = 9) all showed characteristic appearances with light microscopy, but only one had bacterial colonization on SEM. The surface features of specimens from children with other gastrointestinal disorders (food intolerance, postenteritis syndrome, protracted diarrhea of infancy, and immune deficiency states) were very similar to those from the CNSD group. Bacteria were visible on 89% of specimens, and in half of these cases the organisms were bacilli. SEM of specimens from children with no gastrointestinal disease (ages 11-107 months) suggested an increased density of villi/unit area with advancing age. Bacteria were present in only two cases and did not include bacilli. The findings suggest that bacterial colonization of the surface of the small intestine is common in children with several gastrointestinal diseases and may play a part in their pathogenesis. Routine SEM examination of jejunal biopsies provides information not available from standard light microscopy, which may be relevant to the treatment of children with chronic diarrhea.},

   abstract = {Important inroads are being made into understanding the pathophysiology of diarrhea. Clear understanding of key mechanisms should suggest new approaches to combat disease. Exciting developments are occurring in terms of super-ORS solutions, particularly with the promise of short chained glucose polymers and glutamine. Perhaps the most important development is the prospect of a good rotavirus vaccine being available before the end of the decade. Chronic diarrhea seems to be on the increase globally, probably because of the success of ORS. The mechanisms that lead to mucosal injury are elusive, and therapy still largely supportive and empiric. Celiac disease continues to be a puzzle, because of the uncomfortable feeling that a majority of cases may be missed because of atypical presentations. The successful use of long term parenteral nutrition has allowed survival and better characterization of cases that otherwise would have perished as 'lethal protracted diarrhea'. Microvillus inclusion disease may be the commonest congenital secretory diarrhea. The role of the recently reported high prevalence of glucoamlase deficiency may be important. Lastly, attention to micronutrients, particularly low vitamin A and probably zinc may prove to be important in prevention and amelioration of diarrhea and growth failure.},

   abstract = {Nutrition and intestinal function are intimately interrelated. The chief purpose of the gut is to digest and absorb nutrients in order to maintain life. Consequently, chronic gastrointestinal (GI) disease commonly results in malnutrition and increased morbidity and mortality. For example, studies have shown that 50-70% of adult patients with Crohn's disease were weight-depleted and 75% of adolescents growth-retarded. On the other hand, chronic malnutrition impairs digestive and absorptive function because food and nutrients are not only the major trophic factors to the gut but also provide the building blocks for digestive enzymes and absorptive cells. For example, recent studies of ours have shown that a weight loss of greater than 30% accompanying a variety of diseases was associated with a reduction in pancreatic enzyme secretion of over 80%, villus atrophy and impaired carbohydrate and fat absorption. Finally, specific nutrients can induce disease, for example, gluten-sensitive enteropathy, whilst dietary factors such as fibre, resistant starch, short-chain fatty acids, glutamine and fish-oils may prevent gastrointestinal diseases such as diverticulitis, diversion colitis, ulcerative colitis, colonic adenomatosis and colonic carcinoma. The role of dietary antigens in the aetiology of Crohn's disease is controversial, but controlled studies have suggested that elemental diets may be as effective as corticosteroids in inducing a remission in patients with acute Crohn's disease. In conclusion, nutrition has both a supportive and therapeutic role in the management of chronic gastrointestinal diseases. With the development of modern techniques of nutritional support, the morbidity and mortality associated with chronic GI disease can be reduced. On the other hand, dietary manipulation may be used to treat to prevent specific GI disorders such as coeliac disease, functional bowel disease, Crohn's disease and colonic neoplasia. The future development of nutria-pharmaceuticals is particularly attractive in view of their low cost and wide safety margins.},

   abstract = {A substantial minority of patients with coeliac disease (estimated at anything between 7 and 30%) fail to respond to treatment with a gluten-free diet. Non-responsiveness may be primary, that is when the patient fails to respond to treatment following initial diagnosis, or secondary, when a patient who has previously had a documented response to gluten exclusion becomes non-responsive to therapy. The commonest cause of non-responsiveness is continued gluten ingestion, either voluntary or inadvertent. Other causes to be considered include intolerances to dietary constituents other than gluten (e.g. milk, soya), pancreatic insufficiency, enteropathy-associated T-cell lymphoma and ulcerative jejunitis. There is some evidence that ulcerative jejunitis is, in fact, a manifestation of lymphoma. The most important steps in the management of the non-responsive coeliac patient are (a) to determine whether the patient is indeed coeliac, (b) to exclude lymphoma and (c) to establish the cause of the non-responsiveness. In those coeliac patients with no demonstrable cause for non-responsiveness, a variety of therapeutic stratagems (mostly based on small, uncontrolled studies) have been described; these include elimination diets, dietary supplementation with zinc and copper, and pharmacological therapy in the form of steroids, azathioprine and cyclosporin. In a minority of non-responsive patients, the clinical course is characterized by a rapid decline, and total parenteral nutrition is required. None of the therapies described above has been subjected to rigorous controlled studies. The precise mechanisms of non-responsiveness in coeliac patients need to be unravelled before rational therapeutic approaches can be established.},

Prospective assessments of gastrointestinal function, nutritional status, and wellbeing were therefore carried out in 47 consecutive patients (28 males, 19 females; mean age 8.4 years) undergoing bone marrow transplant. 31 diarrhoeal episodes (median duration 9.5 days) occurred in 27 patients at a median of 10 days after transplantation. Ninety one per cent of episodes were associated with protein losing enteropathy. Protein losing enteropathy was more severe in graft-versus-host disease (GVHD) comparing with other causes. It led to a substantial fall in serum albumin and there was a negative correlation between faecal alpha 1-antitrypsin concentrations and serum albumin. Transient pancreatic insufficiency developed in 18 patients, and pancreatitis in one. Intestinal permeability was normal in 12 patients who had no diarrhoea during the conditioning treatments. Diarrhoeal patients had a significantly greater decrease in nutritional status and wellbeing than patients without diarrhoea. Gastrointestinal injury following bone marrow transplantation is thus complex. Severe protein losing enteropathy in this context suggests the presence of GVHD.},

Presently available techniques are not ideal in clinical practice for serial analysis as they are time-consuming and require unpleasant and prolonged handling of the stools. The present study aimed to evaluate the accuracy and precision of near infrared reflectance analysis (NIRA) in routine measurement of fat, nitrogen and water faecal contents compared with Van de Kamer (VDK), Kjeldahl (KJ) and gravimetric-by-lyophilization (LY) methods, respectively. Fat, nitrogen and water (n = 34), were measured in the 1-day faecal collections of 15 healthy subjects and 19 patients (10, coeliac disease; 6, chronic pancreatitis; 3, small-bowel Crohn's disease). A highly significant linear correlation was found between VDK, KJ, LY methods and NIRA analysis. Very low values of intra-assay coefficient of variation indicated a remarkable analytical precision of NIRA. A recovery test at different concentrations in the useful range was performed for all three nutrients, to assess the accuracy of NIRA. Quantitative recoveries were between 95 and 105%. Data from the present study show that NIRA analysis is reproducible, accurate and rapid (less than 1 min). These characteristics make NIRA serial analysis useful in clinical practice to monitor progress and response to therapy in patients with malabsorption/maldigestion syndromes.},

Nine patients, aged 12-30 years, presented anorexia nervosa and had a mean weight loss of -19% of their initial weight at the time of the study. Ten patients with celiac disease, aged 3-14 years, had a mean height at -4.2 SD, and normal body weight for height. Fourteen severely obese children, aged 3-10 years, had a mean body mass index (BMI) of 25.7 +/- 0.9. GH-binding protein was low in patients with anorexia nervosa (16.8 +/- 1.9% of radioactivity) and in patients with celiac disease (16.1 +/- 2.2%) whereas it was very high in obese children (57.2 +/- 3.3%). A strong correlation was found between GH-binding protein and BMI. GH-binding protein was also correlated with insulin-like growth factor-1 plasma levels. Nutrition is an important regulator of the GH receptor/binding protein. The growth failure presented by undernourished children is associated with partial GH resistance and low GH receptor level. On the contrary, children with obesity and normal growth have a high GH receptor level.},

   abstract = {A systematic study of celiac disease in a defined population of Arab children has not been previously reported. We therefore performed a prospective study to determine the incidence and clinical presentation of celiac disease in Jordanian children. A total of 34 (12 boys and 22 girls) cases were diagnosed over a period of 36 months. Nine cases were clustered in three families. The incidence was calculated to be 1:2,800 live births. The mean age at presentation was 4.6 years (range 0.3-13), but it was 8.4 years at the time of diagnosis. Diarrhea was the main initial symptom in 15 (44%) patients. Other signs and symptoms included recurrent abdominal pain in five patients (14%), short stature in four (12%), abdominal distension in three (9%), constipation in three (9%), pallor and recurrent mouth ulcers in two patients each. At the time of diagnosis, 24 (71%) had hypochromic microcytic anemia, and nine (26%) had rickets. The relatively high incidence of celiac disease may be related to the large wheat consumption in this population (135 kg/head/year), and the late onset could be related to the widespread prevalence of prolonged breast-feeding in Jordan (12 months) and late introduction of cereals (6.2 months) in children with late presentation. The delay in diagnosis might be due to the presence of other diseases clinically resembling celiac disease in our community.},

Hence, anthropometric, biochemical, and bone densitometric assessment was performed in 23 celiac children, 8 boys and 15 girls, aged 1 to 12 years (mean 4.7), at diagnosis and 1 year after GFD.

After 1 year on GFD, no significant difference was found between patients and controls in all the parameters studied except in height and arm muscle area, which, however, were very near to the normal expected. Serum hemoglobin, iron, and zinc values were below the normal range in more than one half of patients at diagnosis and within the normal range in almost all of them after 1 year of GFD. Serum hemoglobin, iron, zinc, triglycerides, proteins, albumin, and calcium values significantly rose during the year of GFD. A year of GFD in celiac children allows a virtually complete return in body mass composition.},

   abstract = {That celiac disease is a lifelong disorder was suggested by clinical case records and was considered to have been demonstrated through the widespread use of intestinal biopsies by the end of the 1950s. It was clear that the mucosal lesions observed in children and adults were identical and responded similarly to gluten withdrawal. In fact, in 1970 the European Society for Paediatric Gastroenterology and Nutrition instituted the practice of a challenge after diagnosis. A relapse of clinical symptoms and of the intestinal lesions after gluten was reintroduced into the diet demonstrated the "permanent" nature of sensitivity to gluten in children with celiac disease. Twenty-five years later, the permanence of the sensitivity of the intestinal mucosa to gluten is again a matter of debate. Several lines of evidence, gathered during recent years, show that celiac disease is not always a lifelong condition. First, the long-term follow-up of children with proven celiac disease shows that 10% to 20% of them become "tolerant" (defined on clinical, biological and histologic grounds) to gluten during adolescence. Second, it has also been shown, in individual cases, that the mucosal lesions typical of the disease may appear during adulthood. Our increasing knowledge of the long-term evolution of the disease suggests that celiac disease develops and, in some cases, fades in a predisposed group of people with intestinal sensitivity to gluten, which is probably a common condition. The factors leading to the appearance or disappearance of the disease, however, are still unknown.},

We have identified populations of fibers that respond with increased neurophysiological discharge rates to gastric loads, duodenal loads, and close celiac arterial administration of a brain-gut peptide, cholecystokinin. Load-sensitive fibers with gastric and duodenal mechanoreceptive fields are able to integrate information arising from mechanical and peptidergic stimulation, where cholecystokinin octapeptide (CCK) administration potentiates subsequent responses to distending loads, and synergizes with distending loads to produce greater excitation than either load stimulus alone or peptide stimulation alone. In addition, we have identified situations where the duodenal presence of nutrients modifies the vagal afferent activity of gastric load-sensitive fibers. Thus, our approach can mimic the temporal and spatial distribution of meal-related stimuli in the gut, and reveals the potential for nutrients in one gastrointestinal compartment to affect neutral signals arising from another gut compartment.},

We investigated the metabolism of LTB4 and LTC4 by small intestine mucosa in patients with celiac disease by incubating biopsies of small intestine mucosa from patients and healthy subjects in media containing LTB4 and LTC4 and measuring the changes in LTB4 and cysteinyl LT concentrations in the incubation media. There was no significant degradation of LTB4 during a 60-min incubation of the small intestine mucosa from either children with celiac disease or controls. LTC4 was metabolized to LTD4 and LTE4 in a time-dependent manner by the small intestine mucosa of both patients and controls. However, the decreases in LTC4 and the increases in LTD4 and LTE4 by the intestinal mucosa from patients with celiac disease occurred more slowly than the changes observed in control experiments. Reduced catabolism of LTC4 in the small intestine mucosa due to villous atrophy may contribute to increased levels of LTC4 and may play an important role in the pathophysiology of celiac disease.},

   abstract = {To establish methodological standards for serological investigation and screening of coeliac disease, a joint venture has been launched by the European Medical Research Council and the European Society for Paediatric Gastroenterology and Nutrition. Before general screening can be recommended, robust methods and technical standards ought to be introduced. Joint test protocols were defined: an enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay for IgG and IgA gliadin antibodies and an immunofluorescent test for IgA endomysium antibodies. Protocols have now been tested prospectively by one laboratory. Eighty-eight Tuebingen patients were studied (47 coeliac disease on normal diet, 22 coeliac disease on a gluten-free, and 19 disease controls). Single tests did not produce acceptable levels, but combinations of IgA gliadin antibodies and IgA endomysium antibodies showed 98% sensitivity, 100% specificity and 98% predictive efficiency. Only standardized and refereed methods established by ring testing can serve as a reliable basis for serological coeliac screening.},

   abstract = {Normal intestinal absorption of nutrients requires efficient luminal mixing to deliver solute to the brush border. Lacking such mixing, the buildup of thick unstirred layers over the mucosa markedly retards absorption of rapidly transported compounds. Using a technique based on the kinetics of maltose hydrolysis, we measured the unstirred layer thickness of the jejunum of normal subjects and patients with celiac disease, as well as that of the normal rat. The jejunum of humans and rats was perfused with varying maltose concentrations, and the apparent Michaelis constant (Km) and maximal velocity (Vmax) of maltose hydrolysis were determined from double-reciprocal plots. The true Km of intestinal maltase was determined on mucosal biopsies. Unstirred layer thickness was calculated from the in vivo Vmax and apparent Km and the in vitro Km of maltase. The average unstirred layer thickness of 11 celiac patients (170 micron) was seven times greater than that of 3 controls (25 micron). The unstirred layer of each celiac exceeded that of the controls. A variety of factors could account for the less efficient luminal stirring observed in celiacs. Although speculative, villous contractility could be an important stirring mechanism that would be absent in celiacs with villous atrophy. This speculation was supported by the finding of a relatively thick unstirred layer (mean: 106 micron) in rats, an animal that lacks villous contractility. Because any increase in unstirred layer slows transport of rapidly absorbed compounds, poor stirring appears to represent a previously unrecognized defect that could contribute to malabsorption in celiac disease and, perhaps, in other intestinal disorders.},

We recently modified the test procedure by fecal acidification with the hope of improving fat extraction and consequently the sensitivity of the test. The aim of the present study was to ascertain whether or not fecal acidification led to improved fat extraction by comparing the fat content of both fatty and solid layers obtained by centrifugation of 12 acidified (acid steatocrit) and unacidified (classical steatocrit) steatorrheal stool samples. The fat content of fatty and solid layers was evaluated using the semiquantitative (+ = 1, +2 = 2, +3 = 3) scoring system described by Drummey for the interpretation of the Sudan microscopic method for fecal fat. The fatty layers sum of scores for the 12 samples examined was 31 and 16 for the acid and classical steatocrit, respectively. The solid layers sum of scores for the 12 samples was 13 and 24 for the acid and classical steatocrit, respectively. Fat extraction from stool samples was significantly improved after fecal sample acidification (p < 0.005). Acid steatocrit results agreed better with chemically measured fecal fat than classical steatocrit results. We conclude that fecal acidification, by improving fat extraction, increases the reliability of the steatocrit method for the detection of steatorrhea.},

The enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay was used for antigliadin antibody determinations and R1-type antireticulin antibodies were detected using an indirect immunofluorescence method. Coeliac disease was diagnosed according to recent criteria recommended by the European Society for Paediatric Gastroenterology and Nutrition. Antigliadin antibody testing was positive in 44 (3.1%) of 1434 children studied, and in 33 of whom coeliac disease was confirmed. In all the coeliac patients R1-type antireticulin antibody test was positive. However, 52 (3.5%) of 1461 adults studied who did not have coeliac disease had positive antigliadin antibody test but negative antireticulin antibody test. Thus, in Estonia, the antigliadin antibody test can be used in screening for coeliac disease in children but not in adults.},

Their use in general practice has been hampered by a lack of data on reference values and repeatability of the test and the laboratory assay. In this study, we determined the reference values of the sugar-absorption test, using lactulose and mannitol as probe molecules, for children and adults. The repeatability of the test is good; linear relationship: slope, 0.825 [95% confidence interval (CI), 0.571, 1.152); intercept, 0.005 (95% CI, -0.004, 0.010). The repeatability of the laboratory assay for the sugar-absorption test is excellent; linear relationship: slope, 1.014 (95% CI, 0.870, 1.094); intercept, 0.002 (95% CI, -0.005, 0.010). The validation of the sugar-absorption test makes the test useful as a simple, noninvasive, reliable intestinal permeability test for sugars, which can be of use for clinical practice. Taking possible interfering factors into account, the sugar-absorption test can be used as a diagnostic test for enteropathy of different etiologies and evaluation of therapeutic interventions in both children and adults. Studies with the sugar-absorption test may clarify the role of intestinal permeability in the pathophysiology of a variety of gastrointestinal diseases.},

   abstract = {To determine whether galanin is a pancreatic sympathetic neurotransmitter regulating insulin secretion in the baboon, as it is in the dog, we evaluated galanin for inhibitory effects on insulin secretion in conscious baboons, determined if baboon pancreatic islets are innervated by galaninergic fibers using immunohistochemistry, and measured galanin content in the major sympathetic ganglion supplying the pancreas. Surprisingly, infusion of galanin (1 microgram/kg per min) had no effect on arginine-stimulated secretion of either insulin (71 +/- 14 vs. 88 +/- 17 microU/ml; P = NS) or glucagon (104 +/- 12 vs. 94 +/- 9 pg/ml; P = NS). By contrast, growth hormone secretion was markedly increased during galanin infusion. In the baboon celiac ganglion, no galanin immunoreactivity was detectable in sympathetic neuronal cell bodies by immunostaining and their content of galanin-like immunoreactivity, determined by radioimmunoassay, was only 3% of that in dog celiac ganglion (5.2 +/- 0.8 vs. 158 +/- 13 pmol/g; P < 0.001). By contrast, galanin immunoreactivity was observed in many nerve fibers in the baboon exocrine pancreas and occasionally in baboon pancreatic islets. Moreover, galanin content of the baboon pancreas was similar to that of dog (8.7 +/- 1.5 vs. 5.5 +/- 1.2 pmol/g; P = NS). The finding of galanin immunoreactivity in many neuronal cell bodies in baboon intrapancreatic ganglia suggests a parasympathetic source for these galaninergic fibers in the baboon. Together these data demonstrate that galanin is likely to be a parasympathetic neurotransmitter in the baboon pancreas, without major effects on insulin or glucagon secretion.},

To specify the neural pathways and receptor locations of this feedback, we examined the effects of intraduodenal infusions of 10 nutrients plus saline on short-term food intake of rats with selective deafferentations of vagal celiac branches. Three response profiles were observed: 1) isotonic saline, 5.6% glycerol, and 3% fructose did not inhibit intake of controls or selectively deafferented animals; 2) 3% glucose, 3% maltose, 3% L-phenylalanine, 12% Isocal, and 1.4% oleic acid suppressed intake of controls, but this inhibition was eliminated by vagal celiac deafferentation; and 3) 3% casein hydrolysate and 24% Isocal suppressed intake of controls and rats with selective vagotomies, although the latter exhibited significantly less suppression. In addition, elimination of celiac afferents chronically reduced meal size (i.e., first 30-min intake) without reducing daily food intake or body weight. Furthermore, D-phenylalanine infusions produced a delayed suppression of food intake in controls (possibly from intraluminal irritation); however, this reduction was eliminated with celiac deafferentation. Overall, this experiment indicates that vagal celiac afferents are critical for preabsorptive detection of some energy-yielding molecules or properties of nutrient solutions (as well as, perhaps, intraluminal inflammation), but not others, which are still detected, although only partially.},

Measures of first meal size, daily intake, and body weight before and after both surgeries indicated that animals with unilateral vagal deafferentiations recovered as fast and completely as sham-operated controls. Intraduodenal oleate (1.2 kcal) infusions reduced the size of the first meal in surgical controls (by 64%; P < 0.01) but not in the deafferented rats. A dual wheat germ agglutinin-horseradish peroxidase/Fluorogold protocol provides verification of sensory and motor lesions. The selective vagal deafferentation provided by the new surgery offers a useful model for determining gastrointestinal sites of nutrient detection and separating pre- and postabsorptive consequences of a meal.},

METHODS: Organ culture incubations were done using the pure gliadin peptide B3144 (amino acid sequences 3-56 of alpha-type gliadins) and a control peptide from casein (amino acid sequences 152-193 of alpha s1-casein). The importance of using negative controls was stressed by non-specific tissue damage. By reversed-phase high-performance liquid chromatography of organ culture supernatants, 27 specimens were further investigated. RESULTS: There was good retrieval of peptide calibration peaks after culture. Qualitative and quantitative evaluation of chromatography runs showed degradation of at least 29% of B3144 and 37% of Cas-P. Normal mucosa (controls and coeliac patients on a gluten-free diet) was able to hydrolyse peptide fractions completely, whereas incubation with damaged mucosa (coeliac disease, cow's milk allergy) left initial peptides. CONCLUSION: It is concluded, using a pure single gliadin peptide, that deficient peptide hydrolysis in coeliac disease was a secondary event.},

   abstract = {Among 771 children (381 Swedish and 390 Danish) investigated between 1972 and 1989 because of suspected celiac disease (CD), 179 proved to have the disease. Surprisingly only 24 CD patients were found among the Danish children, compared with 155 in the Swedish group, despite the close ethnic, geographical, and cultural background of the two populations. The Swedish CD children were diagnosed at an earlier age than the Danish children (mean, 1.5 vs. 5.5 years). The symptoms of the Swedish patients were dominated by failure to thrive (93 vs. 71%), whereas a higher proportion of the Danish CD patients suffered from stomach pain (21 vs. 5%). Breast-feeding habits were comparable. The estimated content of gliadin in the officially recommended diets of the two countries in 1987 differed substantially, the Swedish diet containing more than 40 times more gliadin than the Danish (4,400 vs. 100 mg) at the age of 8 months, and 4 times more (3,600 vs. 900 mg) at the age of 12 months. The Danish infant diet differed significantly from the Swedish in containing a larger amount of the lower gluten-containing rye flour. The earlier introduction of food items with a high gluten content in the Swedish compared with the Danish diet seems to be an obvious explanation for the great difference in incidence and symptomatology of CD between the two populations.},
