   abstract = {The role of gamma-interferon in the pathogenesis of enteropathies with an immunological basis such as coeliac disease, is unclear. Gamma-interferon immunoreactive lymphocytes were quantified in jejunal biopsies from patients with coeliac disease and from normal controls. In coeliac disease, there was an apparent decrease in the percentage of both intraepithelial (3.5% v 13.5%) and lamina propria (10.3% v 47.2%) lymphocytes expressing gamma-interferon compared with controls. In patients successfully treated with a gluten free diet, the percentage of gamma-interferon immunoreactive intra-epithelial lymphocytes was 10.3%. Intraepithelial lymphocytes were immunonegative for class II major histocompatibility complex, while epithelial cells showed increased expression of this product in coeliac disease. The results show that a relatively large proportion of lymphocytes in normal small bowel express gamma-interferon. They also indicate that in coeliac disease the major increase in the numbers of mucosal lymphocytes is the result of infiltration by lymphocytes not expressing gamma-interferon.},

   abstract = {Essentially all patients with dermatitis herpetiformis (DH) and dermal granular IgA deposits have a gluten-sensitive enteropathy as seen in coeliac disease. A gluten-free diet would normally restore mucosal morphology within months. The dapsone medication required to suppress the skin lesions could be gradually reduced and/or finally discontinued in most patients if they constantly adhere to the diet. The immunological reactions may also be reduced. The gluten-free diet could thus be successful both concerning manifestations from the skin and the gut. Although well known in dermatological literature, diet therapy in DH has attracted little interest in journals of nutrition. A survey of this causal diet therapy for the disease therefore seems appropriate.},

We found that the disease does not compromise educational achievement and working capacity of patients. A majority of our coeliacs are students (from primary school to university) and rather successful ones since 55% of them passed their previous year examinations. Some are already employed and work as clerks, artisans, masons or skilled workers. 89.6% of our patients reported to be on a strict gluten-free diet, 9% introduce small amounts of gluten and 1.4% are on a normal diet by their own decision. Coeliac patients originating from Northern Italy have more of their gluten-free foods home made and use more gliadin free cereals (rice, maize), whereas coeliacs originating from the Southern regions consume more ready made gluten-free foods. We have assessed the amount of gluten-free products consumed monthly by our patients and their food preferences. Females eat less than males and prefer bread and flour based dishes, whereas males east more pasta and biscuits.},

Monoclonal antibodies and a sensitive indirect peroxidase method were used. In the lamina propria and epithelium of a normal jejunum and rectum, as well as in the rectal and colonic mucosae of patients with ulcerative colitis only low numbers of gamma/delta positive cells were seen. In the lamina propria, in the surface epithelium, as well as, in the epithelium of the Lieberkuhn crypts the number of gamma/delta positive cells were significantly higher than in the controls before treatment, during gluten free diet and after the gluten challenge. In the epithelium the absolute numbers of these cells remained constant during gluten elimination and provocation. The constantly elevated population of gamma/delta positive T-cells in coeliac disease might show their primary pathogenetic role in this disorder. The detection of elevated number of intraepithelial gamma/delta T-cells may have significance in the diagnosis of coeliac disease.},

The structure of the mucosa was not changed in the allergic patients, the content of the granulated and ungranulated labrocytes was increased, their number being decreased in the elimination diet. The number of plasma cells was diminished, and in only few of them IgA was found in children with severe alimentary malabsorption. A selective deficiency of IgA was diagnosed which determines the therapy of such children.

   abstract = {Celiac disease (CD) is caused by ingestion of gluten-containing foods by gluten-sensitive individuals. The gluten causes malabsorption by damaging their intestinal mucosa. Adherence to a gluten-free diet is not simple, because the composition of foods stocked on store shelves is often not known, Patients with CD, particularly when adolescent, often refuse to comply with the diet; and parents are occasionally unable, or unwilling, to prepare gluten-free food. Furthermore, school teachers are usually ignorant of the specific dietary requirements of these patients. We examined physical, scholastic, and social aspects of CD patients in comparison with their siblings in the same age groups (10-18 years) to determine whether CD and the need to keep a diet influence these parameters. 25 CD patients and 14 of their siblings were interviewed at home where they filled a questionnaire. The mean adherence to a gluten-free diet was 96.6%; the heights of the patients were comparable to those of their siblings. We did not find significant differences in scholastic achievement and social adjustment between patients and siblings. It appears that children and adolescents with CD can live with their disease and keep a gluten-free diet while performing satisfactorily in school. However, some complained of difficulties, such as feeling uneasy at social gatherings, wanting to discuss their disability with friends, and feeling unhappy. Some were angry at society for pitying them and considering them as having a disease, while the patients considered themselves as having a food sensitivity.},

   abstract = {A diet excluding wheat, oats, rye and barley is the cornerstone of the treatment of coeliac patients. Such a gluten-free diet (GFD) is recommended irrespective of the presence of symptoms. Maintenance of a strict GFD is not a simple matter, as small amounts of gluten capable of causing relapse have been identified in several previously unsuspected sources, thanks to the recent availability of sensitive detection assays. To date there is no definition as to what amount of gluten in the diet might be tolerable. Compliance to the GFD is a problem, particularly in certain groups of patients (e.g. adolescents). Small amounts of gluten in the diet often do not cause clinical symptoms, nor increased serum levels of antigliadin antibody, nor gross changes of the jejunal histology; nevertheless, they seem to be able to activate mucosal cell-mediated immunity. This finding represents a warning in view of the recently reported protective effect of GFD against malignancies. In conclusion, all present evidences give strong support for advising all patients to adhere to a strict GFD for life.},

In the untreated group, 95% of patients had enteric protein loss with values higher than the upper limit of normality (mean +/- 2 SD). In the treated group of patients, only 22% had abnormal levels of alpha 1-antitrypsin clearance. Sixteen patients who had elevated clearance before treatment had decreased clearance after an average of 7.4 months on a gluten-free diet. There was a significant relation (p less than 0.05) between the alpha 1-antitrypsin clearance and the degree of alteration of the jejunal histological structure. We conclude that enteric protein loss is a very frequent finding in celiac patients and the measurement of alpha 1-antitrypsin clearance may be a reliable method to evaluate the activity of the disease and useful in following the efficacy of treatment.},

In addition, we evaluated the possibility of reducing the time of gluten challenge. Twelve patients had a presumptive diagnosis of celiac disease based on clinical and histological grounds. They were studied when the jejunal histology was normal after gluten-free diet and an alpha 1-ATCL was normal. The gluten was introduced by returning to a normal diet. The challenge lasted 4 wk. We measured alpha 1-ATCL at the end of the 1st and 4th wk, and a new jejunal biopsy was obtained at the end of the 4th wk. By wk 1, alpha 1-ATCL was abnormal in 11 patients but normal in one. By wk 4, alpha 1-ATCL was abnormal in 10 patients and still normal in one. The post-challenge biopsies showed atrophy in 11 and was normal only in the patient with normal alpha 1-ATCL at wk 1 and 4. One patient with abnormal alpha 1-ATCL had to stop the challenge at the first week. The patient with normal clearance at wk 1 and 4 and normal biopsy at wk 4 had abnormal results at 6 months. These data support our hypothesis that alpha 1-ATCL can be used as evidence of gluten toxicity after gluten challenge, and that this test can be abnormal as early as 1 wk after gluten is reintroduced.},

Erythrocyte glutathione (GSH) content of celiac children was elevated and the glutathione disulfide (GSSG) level was significantly decreased as compared to normal controls. Erythrocyte GSSG/GSH ratio in acute CD differed also from the one in iron deficiency. In vitro oxidative load of acetylphenylhydrazine proved the impaired glutathione stability of the erythrocytes in acute CD and cow's milk allergy. A parallel rise of methemoglobin and hemichrome level of blood cells was seen. Further on, the selenium content of the red blood cells of CD patients decreased. All alterations of the erythrocyte tended to normalize during the dietetic period. These data suggest a reduced protective capacity of erythrocytes in CD and in cow's milk allergy in childhood against oxidizing stresses.},

Compared with age matched healthy subjects, treated coeliac patients had lower body mass index (-5%, p less than 0.05) and lower directly measured total body fat mass (-30%, p less than 0.001). They also had decreased bone mineral content (-9 to -13%, p less than 0.01) in the spine and in the forearms. The serum concentrations of albumin, D vitamin binding protein, and iron were reduced (-6 to -22%, p less than 0.01), but otherwise blood and urine analyses were normal. We conclude that this group of treated adult coeliac patients had a reduced fat mass and bone mineral content compared with the general population.},

   abstract = {The growth spurt of adolescence, during which body weight nearly doubles and height increases by 16%, demands an increased delivery of nutrients by the gastrointestinal tract. Chronic disorders of digestion and absorption at this age, therefore have a potentially profound effect upon growth, skeletal maturation and sexual development. Moreover, the emotional climate of adolescence, which requires affiliation with peer groups, and a distancing from authority figures such as doctors and parents, is often associated with a deterioration in drug and dietary compliance and with erratic clinic attendance. Nutritional problems in adolescent patients with Crohn's disease, cystic fibrosis and coeliac disease are the most common. About one third of adolescents with Crohn's disease experience growth failure and delayed sexual development, probably as a consequence of long-term undernutrition. There is a strong argument for the care of these patients being in the hands of paediatric gastroenterologists. Enteral nutrition, often administered overnight, is successful in inducing catch-up growth, and reducing steroid dosage, although resection of diseased gut is often followed by good growth, and surgery should not be overlooked. Cystic fibrosis in adolescence is commonly complicated by protein-energy malnutrition. Pathogenesis includes anorexia, maldigestion and an increase in resting energy expenditure. Malnutrition has been treated by a number of enteral regimens. In general, there is no place for repeated, short-term interventions of less than 6 months. Long-term studies have all shown good nutritional repletion and growth, but results with respect to improved respiratory function are conflicting. More prospective control trials are needed before the precise indications for enteral nutrition in cystic fibrosis can be accurately defined. Once started it is difficult to stop, although preoperative treatment of patients awaiting heart-lung transplantation seems entirely appropriate. The major problem in the management of coeliac disease in adolescence is dietary compliance. Even those patients who claim to have good dietary compliance often have jejunal biopsy evidence of gluten ingestion and tend to be underweight. This is particularly worrying, as after 5 years adherence to a gluten free diet, the increased risk of gastrointestinal malignancy appears to return to normal.},

   abstract = {In the last years the evaluation of IgG against beta-lactoglobulin (beta LG-IgG) has been proposed as reliable test to diagnose Cow's Milk Protein Intolerance (CMPI). This test, associated with other diagnostic tools (such as eosinophilia, hemoccult, RAST, challenge, etc.) showed a good sensibility, but less specificity. In fact antibodies against beta-lactoglobulin were found in other gastrointestinal diseases (coeliac disease, inflammatory bowel diseases, cystic fibrosis, etc.). To determine the specificity of the test some Authors attributed great importance to the laboratory method (IFL, ELISA). They retained IFL more specific. In order to verify the behaviour of the two methods and their concordance we carried out a double bind determination of IgG against beta-lactoglobulin (beta LG-IgG) on serum samples from children affected by CMPI. For this study we chose 16 children, aged from 3 months and 6 years, suffering from CMPI of which 11 with gastrointestinal complaints and 5 from extraintestinal ones. All children were diagnosed on the basis of the following criteria: clinical picture, blood eosinophilia, positivity of hemoccult, amelioration after the withdrawal of cow's milk proteins from the diet, positivity of challenge test. All children at the time of the assessment assuming a diet containing cow's milk proteins. beta LG-IgG were measured using simultaneously immunofluorescent and micro-ELISA methods. The obtained data showed that 12 children (75%) had IgG versus beta-lactoglobulin in the serum. This result was obtained both with IFL and ELISA methods, showing a 100% of concordance.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS)},

   abstract = {Cow's Milk Protein Intolerance (CMPI) is the most common food intolerance in childhood. The I, III and IV type of the immunological mechanisms are involved in the pathogenesis. Nowadays there are no diagnostic tests with good reliability excluding the IgE-mediated clinical pictures. Recently the evaluation of antibodies (IgA and IgG classes) versus milk proteins has been proposed as reliable test. In order to establish the pattern of antibody response against milk proteins we studied 37 children (17 males and 20 females), aged from 3 months to 6 years, divided as follows: 23 with CMPI of which 16 suffering from gastrointestinal complaints (GI) and 7 from cutaneous ones (CT); 5 children with coeliac disease; 9 normal healthy children without any clinical manifestation. All children at the time of the assessment assuming a diet containing cow's milk proteins. IgA, IgG and IgM antibody classes against cow's milk proteins such as alpha-lactoalbumin (alpha LA), beta-lactoglobulin (beta LG), casein (CAS) and pooled proteins (PPL) were measured using an ELISA method. The results obtained in the various groups were as follows: CMPI-GI group: the percentage of positivity for alpha LA-IgA was 43.8% and alpha LA-IgG 68.7%, for beta LG-IgA was 50% and beta LG-IgG 75%, for CAS-IgA was 43.8% and CAS-IgG 68.7%, for PPL-IgA was 37.5% and PPL-IgG 62.5%. CMPI-CT group: the percentage of positivity for alpha LA-IgA was 42.8% and alpha LA-IgG 57.1%, for beta LG-IgA was 71.4% and beta LG-IgG 42.8%, for CAS-IgA and CAS-IgG was 85.7%, for PPL-IgA was 71.4% and PPL-IgG 57.1%.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS)},

Large doses of non-EC enzymes are associated with increased serum urate (SU) and urinary uric acid (UUA) but data are unavailable for EC enzymes. This study compared the effectiveness and safety of a relatively large dose (patient's usual dose) versus a small dose (1/4 usual dose) of EC enzymes in nine nourished children with CF, regarding decreasing fecal fat and stool nitrogen losses and maintaining normal SU and UUA concentrations. A crossover study design randomly assigned large or small doses to two consecutive 7 day treatment periods within each child. Large doses of EC enzymes reduced steatorrhea and increased SU and UUA. SU was normal with both treatments and UUA was normal, i.e., 17 of 18 values were between the 10th and 95th percentiles for healthy children eating a normal diet. When fat excretion was greater than 10% with small doses of EC enzymes, large doses resulted in reduced fat excretion and normal UUA. These data suggest that large doses of EC enzymes reduce steatorrhea and are safe in patients who have malabsorbtion with small doses.},

This study compared the effectiveness of enteric coated (EC) pancreatic enzymes given before meals with those given during meals (15 minutes after beginning of meal) in reducing steatorrhea in well-nourished children with cystic fibrosis. Eight children (6 years 11 months old to 14 years 7 months old) were studied in the General Clinical Research Center at Indiana University Hospital, Indianapolis. A crossover study design randomly assigned enzymes before or during meals during two consecutive 7-day treatment periods for each child. No difference in fat excretion was documented for the total group when the children who took enzymes before meals were compared with those who took enzymes during meals. However, a stepwise multiple regression analysis of the difference (before minus during) in fat excretion on sex, age, enzyme number, and treatment order documented a positive correlation of age with fat excretion (r = .83). Mean fat excretion in younger children (less than 10 years old) decreased significantly when enzymes were given before meals (7.14 +/- 1.95%) rather than during meals (9.92 +/- 1.61%) (P = .004). The difference in fat excretion (mean = 2.78 +/- 0.55%, range = 1.4% to 4%) translates into a half to one full year's growth potential. Younger children with cystic fibrosis may benefit clinically from taking EC enzymes before meals.},

The exact pathogenesis of CD is still obscure, but it is considered to be immunologically mediated. We have previously shown elevated prostaglandin E2 (PGE2) and thromboxane B2 (TxB2) content in small intestinal mucosa obtained from active celiac children. In the present study, we found significantly elevated PGE2, leukotriene B4 (LTB4), and leukotrienes C4, D4, and E4 (LTC4D4E4) content in small bowel mucosa from children suffering from CD on a gluten-containing diet in comparison to control subjects. PGE2 was 25,278 +/- 7,761 vs. 4,478 +/- 426 pg/mg of protein (mean +/- SEM), respectively. LTB4 was 8,807 +/- 3,706 vs. 403 +/- 63 pg/mg of protein (mean +/- SEM), respectively. LTC4D4E4 was 15,369 +/- 4,085 vs. 2,998 +/- 279 pg/mg of protein (mean +/- SEM), respectively. We conclude that the elevated content of arachidonic acid metabolic products via cyclooxygenase and lipoxygenase pathways may contribute to the diarrhea and may be involved in the pathogenesis of mucosal injury.},

EMA were present in 4/211 (2%) of comparison subjects (normal mucosa), IgA AGA in 12/211 (6%), and IgG AGA in 74/211 (35%). The specificity of AGA cannot be calculated from these figures as they are biased. The combined determination of AGA and EMA, taking advantage of the high sensitivity of AGA and the high specificity of EMA, gives an excellent prediction of the condition of the mucosa: 247/248 patients (99.6%) with positive EMA and positive IgG AGA and IgA AGA had a flat mucosa, whereas 136/137 patients (99.3%) with neither AGA nor EMA had a normal mucosa. During a gluten free diet EMA and AGA disappear. Their presence or absence is therefore an indicator of dietary compliance. After reintroduction of gluten into the diet 110/134 (82%) of the patients who had a flat mucosa at diagnosis relapsed, but 24/134 still had a normal mucosa after 2-15 years of challenge. All these patients without a morphological relapse were less than 2 years old at diagnosis so we conclude that patients who are young at diagnosis should be challenged. AGA often reappear earlier than EMA. After one month of challenge 93% of patients are AGA and 69% EMA positive. After more than three years of gluten intake the percentage of AGA positive patients decreased to about 50% whereas the percentage of EMA positive sera was then highest (93%). Therefore EMA are more sensitive for the detection of 'silent' relapse after prolonged periods of gluten intake.},

   abstract = {We studied three groups of patients with coeliac disease: group 1 = 95 adult patients with gastro-intestinal symptoms diagnosed after reaching adult height, 41 of whom had had symptoms during childhood; group 2 = 23 adult patients with classic coeliac disease treated before or during puberty; group 3 = 11 coeliac children with short stature and no gastro-intestinal symptoms diagnosed and treated before or during puberty. We evaluated the adult height in groups 1 and 2 and the growth during the first years of diet in group 3. Our study leads us to the following conclusions. Dieting leads to a modest increase (on average not more than 3 cm) of the final height of coeliac patients. Subjects with gastro-intestinal symptoms who have been treated before adulthood reach a mean height similar to the normal population and have a slightly better adult height than non-treated subjects. This difference seems to exist only in men and this might be related to puberty evolving more rapidly in women receiving treatment. Subjects without symptoms during childhood reach a normal final height even without treatment. In our patients, early treatment seemed to have no great effect on adult height.},

   abstract = {Acute fasting has been shown to impair gonadotropin secretion in an estrogen-dependent manner in rats. The present study examined whether the vagus nerves have some role in the suppression of pulsatile LH release after 48-h fasting in ovariectomized estradiol-treated rats by performing complete subdiaphragmatic cutting of the nerves or selective sectioning of its branches (gastric, hepatic, or celiac) after the first hour of a 3-h blood sampling period. Vagotomy, alone, did not cause any changes in LH release in the unfasted animals. However, complete and gastric vagotomies restored pulsatile LH release that was suppressed before the nerves were cut in fasted animals. Neither hepatic nor celiac vagotomy restored pulsatile LH release, which remained suppressed throughout the sampling period in fasted animals. These results suggest that some mechanism involving the afferent vagal nerves, particularly the gastric vagus, has a major role in the suppression of pulsatile LH release during acute fasting in ovariectomized estradiol-primed rats.},

It often has atypical symptoms, so a sensitive and specific test is needed that can both simplify the ESPGAM criteria and monitor compliance of patients to their gluten free diet. The AEmA (anti endomysium antibody), found by Chorzelsky in 1984, appears to be a very sensitive and specific screening test in the diagnosis of coeliac disease (CD). Sera from 150 children, mean age 4 years (range 6 months to 20 years) were tested for endomysium antibodies (IgA class) and anti gliadin antibodies (IgG class). From our preliminary study IgA-AEmA seem to be more specific for CD than IgG class anti-gliaadin antibodies.},

   abstract = {This study was designed to determine the extent of pancreatic insufficiency in untreated coeliac disease and whether pancreatic secretion is impaired after a prolonged gluten free period. Three groups of patients were studied: group A comprised 44 patients, mean (SD) age 4.0 (3.1) years, with coeliac disease and total or subtotal atrophy of the intestinal mucosa; group B comprised 67 patients, mean age 4.4 (3.0) years, with coeliac disease but with normal morphology of the intestinal villi (after 12.9 months of a gluten free diet); group C comprised 49 control subjects, mean age 3.2 (3.0) years, with normal jejunal histology. In all subjects exocrine pancreatic function was determined by the secretin-caerulein test; bicarbonate concentration and lipase, phospholipase, and chymotrypsin activity were measured after an intravenous injection of secretin 1 clinical unit (CU) + caerulein 75 ng/kg body weight. Faecal chymotrypsin concentration was also assayed. No significant difference was found between values of the duodenal output of pancreatic enzymes and bicarbonate obtained in the three groups; however, 10 of 44 untreated coeliac patients showed tryptic or lipolytic activity, or both, below the normal limit for our laboratory. The mean value of the faecal chymotrypsin concentration was significantly lower in untreated than in treated coeliac patients (p less than 0.0001) or in control subjects (p less than 0.0001). It is concluded that untreated coeliac patients may have pancreatic deficiency independent of a decrease in enterohormone release. No primary or secondary pancreatic insufficiency was found in coeliac patients where the intestinal mucosa had returned to normal.},

Then they related these data to the age of onset of symptoms. Children breast-fed for 3 months or more showed a marked delay in the onset of the disease and a longer latency time from gluten introduction when compared with bottle-fed children; on the contrary early gluten introduction was not positively correlated to risk of celiac disease. This observations induce to think that breast-feeding may be a protective factor towards coeliac disease, while the precocious gluten introduction is not an important factor of risk correlated to this disease.},

   abstract = {The authors have studied the proceeding of anti endomysium antibodies (AEA-IgA) in a group of coeliac patients, in order to investigate new tests, not intrusive and easy repeatable, to employ in diagnosis and in follow up of coeliac disease. The research was carried out by an indirect immunofluorescent test on 65 sera of patients with age range 1-11 years; of those patients 14 show the coeliac disease at beginning, 16 were on Gluten Free Diet (GFD) from 3-5 months, 28 were on GFD from 1 year and 7 were on challenge with gluten from 2-4 months. We investigated AEA-IgA in sera of 71 gastroenterological and not-gastroenterological patients of analogous age to coeliacs how control subjects. All coeliac patients (14) with disease at beginning were positive for AEA-IgA. For the patients on GFD we observed an evident correlation between the term of diet and presence of AEA-IgA: 12 of 16 patients on GFD from 3-5 months were positive, but after 1 year of GFD all patients were negative; after 2-4 months from reintroduction of gluten in diet with the challenge we observed that all examined patients were positive for AEA-IgA. In 21 coeliac patients on free diet (14 with the disease at beginning and 7 after challenge) any reduction of percentage positivity was noted with the growth. The investigation of AEA-IgA in all examined control subjects was always negative. Our data suggest that the AEA-IgA investigation, for highly sensitivity and specificity, for easy repeatability and absence of intrusivity, is a diagnostic test that can be usefully combined to others (intestinal biopsy, dosage of anti gliadin antibodies) in diagnosis and in follow up of coeliac disease.},

   abstract = {Carnitine is a very important co-factor for the metabolism of fatty acids, because it is the necessary carrier for the passage of acyl groups inside the mitochondria, where beta-oxidation takes place. In the human body the total pool of carnitine is made by two fractions, one being endogenous and the second exogenous. The absorption of exogenous carnitine takes place mainly at duodenal-jejunal level by an active transport mechanism based on amino acid carrier. Plasma L-carnitine concentrations have been measured in 66 coeliac patients (mean age: 7 years and 4 months). Thirty three of them were on a free diet and the other 33 were on a gluten-free diet for at last six month. In 10 patients we studied plasma L-carnitine levels both on a free diet and on a gluten-free diet. As controls we examined 33 healthy children comparable for age. Plasma L-carnitine concentrations have been measured by a spectrophotometrical method according to Marquis and Fritz's technique and subsequently modified by Pearson and Seccombe. In the 66 coeliac patients the mean values of serum L-carnitine were significantly lower than those in the controls (p < 0.001). The levels were significantly lower in patients a free diet with respect to those on gluten-free diet (p < 0.01). The 10 subjects who were examined both on free diet and on gluten-free diet showed an increase of plasma concentrations in the latter condition.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS)},

He received central parenteral nutrition beginning at three months of age after a poor response to a semielemental diet and peripheral parenteral nutrition. He was totally dependent on central parenteral nutrition thereafter. Although diarrhea disappeared with strict bowel rest, intolerance to minimal enteral feedings persisted throughout his 2 years 4 months of life. Investigations including stool examinations and repeated cultures, immune function studies, radiologic studies of the small bowel and screening for galactosemia and cystic fibrosis could not demonstrate a specific cause for the diarrhea. Repeated small intestinal biopsies at 1 month, 4 months and 1 year 5 months of age showed persistent villous atrophy with crypt hypoplasia and a low crypt mitotic index. Electron microscopic examination revealed normal-appearing microvilli. This child may have had a congenital enteropathy due to an inborn crypt regeneration defect causing lifelong intolerance to enteral feedings.},

Total and HDL cholesterol levels were significantly lower and triglycerides higher in celiac untreated children than in IBS control children in both age groups. HDL cholesterol significantly increased in both age groups after some months of gluten-free diet. Total and LDL cholesterol significantly increased and triglycerides decreased in the younger group of subjects after the period of gluten-free diet.

There was a significant increase in fasting peak systolic velocity in the superior mesenteric artery between days 1 and 2 with a further upward trend until day 5; no such changes were seen in the coeliac axis. Fasting velocities were 20% lower in breast-fed babies than bottle-fed babies. Following feeds, there was a significant increase in velocity in the superior mesenteric artery that was 35% greater in the bottle-fed than breast-fed babies. Changes in the coeliac axis were qualitatively similar but substantially smaller. The peak velocity in both vessels occurred 50 min after a feed. We conclude that Doppler ultrasound can be readily used to measure gut blood flow velocities in the human newborn. It provides a noninvasive technique for investigating adaptive postnatal changes in the splanchnic circulation, and, in particular, the response to feeds.},

   abstract = {To investigate the role of dietary components in immunoglobulin A mesangial nephropathy (IgAGN), this study focused on gliadin, based on the reported association between coeliac disease and IgAGN as well as the pilot observation that a gluten-free diet was able to reduce the levels of circulating IgA immune complexes (IgAIC). IgA mesangial deposits in mice were induced by oral immunization with gliadin and in rats by inducing alcoholic liver cirrhosis, which increased the levels of IgA against dietary antigens (Ag). Gliadin was able to bind to cultured mesangial cells by a lectinic bond, which was reversed by competitive sugars. Binding increased mesangial cell tumor necrosis factor synthesis and decreased prostaglandin E2 production. Several gluten lectinic fractions modulate leukocyte oxidative metabolism, cytotoxicity, and chemotaxis. In IgAGN patients, serum IgA to dietary Ag were sporadically positive and IgAIC containing IgA to dietary components were significantly increased. The affinity of serum IgA to various lectins was increased in some patients. Conversely, no substantial deposition in renal tissue of dietary Ags was observed by immunofluorescence. A gluten-free diet, given to IgAGN patients with high levels of circulating IgAIC and positive antigliadin IgA, was followed by a decrease in the mean levels of both IgAIC and IgA to various dietary Ag, parallel to a reduction in proteinuria. These data suggest that dietary components, such as Ag or lectins, may play a role in IgAGN by promoting IgAIC formation and perhaps favoring mesangial localization via lectinic interactions.},

She followed a coeliac diet and at the age of twelve she manifested a rheumatoid arthritis of the left knee without pain, confirmed by laboratory data (RA test, ANA test). In this period, the patient underwent another gastrointestinal biopsy after suspension of the diet; the structural alterations of the gastrointestinal tract being always present, she continued the diet associated with non steroidal antiphlogistic drug therapy for rheumatoid arthritis. The Authors remark the association of diseases, making a comparison with literature data and confirming the current hypotheses. It is interesting to observe that when the patient presented articular symptoms, there was the reappearance of the gastrointestinal symptomatology. Very interesting is the presence of psoriasis: in fact there is the problem whether this case is a psoriatic arthritis with coeliac disease or a juvenile rheumatoid arthritis with coeliac disease and psoriasis. At last, the Authors report the good results obtained by coeliac diet and non steroidal antiphlogistic drugs; a complete remission of articular symptoms and a good puberal and intellectual growth have been observed.},

Of these patients, 71% presented severe intestinal lesions, indistinguishable from those found in coeliac disease (CD). However, there were little other clinical manifestations of this finding since only three children in this group had weight and height < or = P3. Of the remaining children, 18% had moderate intestinal atrophy and 10% had normal mucosa or mucosa with negligible changes. When changed to a gluten free diet, the intestinal lesions subsided, dermic lesions disappeared in 17 patients, improved in 8 others and remained the same in the other three patients that were still on variable diets. A study of human leukocyte antigens (HLA) class II showed a total association with Dqw2 and 85% association to DR3, which was identical to the coeliac disease control group. These findings lead one to conclude that HD and CD are different clinical expressions of the same sensitivity to gluten which is associated to an immunological disorder with a common genetic base linked to certain HLA molecules.},

Intestinal morphology was quantified in six coeliac subjects on a normal diet, six coeliac subjects on a GFD, and 21 normal subjects. T-cell activity was measured in the eight coeliac subjects by soluble interleukin-2 receptor (sIL-2R) concentration (normal less than 477 U/mL). Intestinal permeability was increased 10-fold with a geometric mean value of 0.72 on a normal diet, and decreased to 0.17 at 4 weeks (P = 0.04), to 0.07 at 8 weeks (P = 0.010), and to 0.20 at 12 weeks (P = 0.015) of a GFD. Two of the eight subjects showed a poor response to gluten withdrawal. Quantitative intestinal morphology showed no significant improvement after 3 to 6 months of a GFD. Mean +/- s.d. sIL-2R concentrations in the eight subjects were increased 5-fold higher than control values at 1400 +/- 530 U/mL on a normal diet and decreased to 750 +/- 200 U/mL after 12 weeks of a GFD (P = 0.004). We conclude that intestinal permeability improves rapidly in the majority of coeliac subjects after commencing a GFD, although some abnormal permeability and increased T-cell activity persists. This may be due to varying degrees of gluten ingestion resulting in continued immune activation.},

   abstract = {The aim of this work was to establish the diagnostic and follow up value of IgA-class antiendomysium (IgA-EmA) and IgA-class antigliadin (IgA-AGA) antibodies in celiac disease. Correlation with the intestinal histology at the different stages of the disease was evaluated, as well as its therapeutic monitoring ability. Fifty six children, twenty seven girls and twenty nine boys, aged six months to twelve years old, were studied. Thirty nine celiac children were all different diagnostic stages of the disease. Seventeen children with malabsorption symptoms and with normal intestinal histology were used as controls. Sixty blood samples were obtained simultaneously with the small intestinal biopsy. IgA-AGA (ELISA method) and IgA-EmA (immunofluorescent test performed over lower third Rhesus monkey esophagus) were determined in every blood sample. In 34 serum samples from patients with total or subtotal villous atrophy, two were negative for IgA-AGA and only one was negative for IgA-EmA. In 26 samples from patients with normal intestinal histology, two were positive for IgA-AGA and four were positive for IgA-EmA. The results for IgA-EmA had sensitivity 97%, specificity 84.6%, positive predictive value 89.2% and negative predictive value 95%. In the case of IgA-AGA were: sensitivity 94.1% specificity 92.3%, positive predictive value 94.1%, negative predictive value 92.3%. IgA-AGA and IgA-EmA showed a high correlation with intestinal histology and are in combination powerful tools for the diagnosis and follow up of celiac patients. Besides, they provide a useful aid in the indication of a jejunal biopsy and in close monitoring of the dietary treatment compliance.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS)},

   abstract = {The Authors report a case of coeliac disease which first appeared in a boy of 4, suffering from a seizure disorder. The bulky mass of fatty faeces led towards gastroenteric investigations (xylose-test, jejunum biopsy). The atrophy of the villi was clearly shown by the biopsy and a coeliac disease was easily diagnosed. The boy was prescribed a coeliac diet and no fits of generalized convulsions occurred during three years follow-up. Yet, while he was given a challenge free-diet, they started to occur. A computerized axial tomography (TAC) carried out when he was eight and another when fifteen, evidenced bilateral, intracranial calcifications, cortical-subcortical, in the blood vessels, symmetrically located in the occipital region. The anticonvulsive therapy, started when he was 4, has never been interrupted. Now A.M. is 21 and still following an anticonvulsive polytherapy. Many tests were performed. The result of folic acid dosage carried out when he was 16, and badly follow a coeliac diet, was less than 2 ng/ml. A modification in the neurological symptomatology was noted during his puberal phase: fits of convulsions changed into daily crises of mind-failures. This feature is still present in his adult age. The case is reported for its clinical characteristics of neurological symptomatology associated with coeliac disease. The iconographical documentation evidences endocranial calcifications frequently connected with coeliac disease.},

   abstract = {The coeliac disease (CD) or gluten-sensitive enteropathy (GSE) is a permanent intolerance to wheat gliadin and to correlated proteins inducing malabsorption and typical damages of the jejunal mucosa (total or subtotal villous atrophy = SVA) in genetically-predisposed individuals ("DQW2"). A large amount of research has been devoted to CD pathogenesis: the most recent studies, thanks to sophisticated and experimental methods, support the pathogenetic immunological theory and the one of direct cytotoxicity. The correct diagnostic procedure for CD, established in 1970 by the European Society for Pediatric Gastroenterology and Nutrition (ESPGAN), suggested three small bowel mucosal biopsies. In the last years, because of the difficulties of such a practice, the necessity of non-invasive diagnostic approaches has developed; such approaches have been verified in absorption tests (one-hour blood xylose, intestinal permeability methods) and in immunogenetic tests (antibodies antigliadin, anti-reticulin, anti-endomysium, anti 90 KD glycoprotein, anti-human jejunum, HLA I/II antigens). The specific MHC antigens establish CD's incidence in several population and in particular situations, as in first-degree relatives and in diseases associated with CD (dermatitis herpetiformis (DH), insulin dependent diabetes mellitus (IDDM) and other auto-immune syndromes). The specific serum antibodies singly used as first level screening if estimated in combination with absorption tests, reach the highest levels of specificity and sensibility in CD diagnosis. It's anyway fundamental the comparison with at least a typical CD histological feature, caused by a challenge with a sufficient gluten to be carried in dubious cases and in non high auxological risk age (ESPGAN 1989). Adolescence is a period of frequent non compliance with a gluten-free diet and of particular psychological and physical problems: the apparent "gluten insensitivity", typical of teen-agers and adults, recalls the definitions of silent CD and latent CD (iceberg like). In the first case the jejunal mucosa is abnormal and the symptomatology isn't evident. In latent CD, genetically restricted, the mucosa is normal but there are minimal markers of inappropriate immunity to gliadin (at intestinal humoral immunity level) and a possible worsening of histological lesions to the third stage under environmental stimuli. This represents a two-stage model CD. That's why CD is still under-evaluated despite recent statistics reporting an increasing incidence (late and atypical forms). Prevalence rates between 1:300 and 1:4,000 and more are quoted in literature. The necessity of a strict gluten-free diet is confirmed by the evident frequency of lymphoma and by the increased risk of malignancy in untreated CD.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 400 WORDS)},

Anti-insulin (IAAb), immunoglobulin (alpha IgAb), islet cell (ICA) and glucagon autoantibodies were examined in 15 children with coeliac disease at diagnosis (group 1), in 15 children with coeliac disease following a gluten-free diet (group 2) and in 30 control patients (groups 3 and 4). IAAb were present in 27% of group 1 and in 20% of group 2 patients and alpha IgAb were significantly increased in group 1 and 2 patients; two patients in group 2 were positive for ICA; none of the coeliac disease patients were positive for anti-glucagon antibodies. The levels of anti-gliadin antibodies in group 1 were positively correlated with those of alpha IgAb. Coeliac disease-related HLA antigens were not correlated with antibody presence. The presence of diabetes-related humoral immune factors in coeliac disease raises the question as to whether or not they are predictive of subclinical pancreatic damage or whether they are simply indicators of a more general autoimmune diathesis.},

There is no correlation between placental and total blood ferritin values. Because of the strong association between coeliac disease and lymphoma, 19 children with active and 25 with inactive coeliac disease were screened for the presence of placental ferritin. Thirty two children with other intestinal disorders served as controls. Placental ferritin was identified by using a monoclonal antibody in an ELISA procedure. The mean (SEM) placental ferritin value in the control serum was 12.6 (2.4) while the values in serum of patients with active and inactive coeliac disease were 117 (22.8) and 43.8 (10.2) U/ml respectively. Patients with active coeliac disease differed significantly from both control subjects (p = 0.0004) and those with inactive disease (p = 0.03). Peripheral blood lymphocytes contained no placental ferritin. It was present, however, in lamina propria lymphocytes of intestinal biopsy specimens from active coeliacs. Placental ferritin was also found in some of the better differentiated malignant cells in two patients with adult onset enteropathy associated lymphoma. Placental ferritin is known to have an immunosuppressive effect, and this may be one of the necessary steps in the development of malignancy associated with coeliac disease. Gluten free diet, by reversing this state, may have a role in the prevention of lymphoma.},

This permeability of the intestinal mucosa, which depends mostly on the size of the molecule and the state of the mucosa, can be studied with the assistance of protein macromolecules in an allergy-immunological investigation, or with inert markers, so permitting evaluation of the state of integrity of the small intestine. The markers used are polyethylene glycols (PEG) of various molecular weights, Cr EDTA, the monosaccharide sugars mannitol or rhamnose and the disaccharide sugars lactulose or cellobiose. Study of the intestinal permeability to inert markers allows detection of coeliac or Crohn's disease. It can be repeated, especially at the time of food provocation tests needed in the diagnosis of food intolerances in pediatrics in the enteropathology to cows milk proteins, atopic dermatitis and irritable colon in children.},

Of the patients younger than 2 years old, 67.4% were underweight (body weight: less than - 2SD) and 33.9% were short (height: less than - 2SD). In children older than 2 years, underweight was present in 36.0% of patients; the prevalence of short stature was 50.0%. Therefore, diagnostic procedures related to CCD appear justified in all children with short stature of unknown etiology. However, because 50% of patients were neither short nor underweight, normal height and weight should not preclude workup of a patient with symptoms suggestive of CCD. Of the laboratory tests evaluated, antigliadin antibodies were the most sensitive for CCD. Insulin-like growth factor (IGF-I) serum levels were prospectively studied in 62 patients (32 CCD patients, 30 controls) referred for jejunal biopsy. IGF-I levels were significantly lower in female CCD patients than in control patients. There was a significant negative association between the duration of gluten exposure and IGF-I levels. Results indicate that significant reduction in IGF-I levels in CCD patients occurs only after prolonged gluten exposure but before growth failure. Reevaluation of IGF-I levels on a glutenfree diet showed rapid reversal of reduced IGF-I values.},

In untreated celiac disease presenting with subtotal villous atrophy, peak concentrations of primary BAs were significantly delayed and serum levels were significantly higher than in controls. Small but significant abnormalities persisted after a period of gluten-free diet despite a normalization of mucosal morphology. Slightly pathological standard liver function tests in five patients were related to increased fasting levels but not to the postprandial pattern of BAs, indicating that the observed abnormalities postprandially were not related to liver disease. Further studies simultaneously focusing on deconjugation mechanisms, absorption, and pool sizes of BAs are required to explain the postprandial BA pattern under the course of celiac disease.},

Results were variable with the antireticulin and antigliadin antibodies. Sensitivity and correlation with subtotal villous atrophy in the untreated patients was 100%.

   abstract = {Intrinsic factor is produced by the gastric parietal cell. Its secretion is stimulated via all pathways known to stimulate gastric acid secretion: histamine, gastrin, and acetylcholine. There is, however, a different mode of secretion for both substances: atropine, vagotomy, and H2 receptor antagonists inhibit both intrinsic factor and acid secretion, but secretin and the hydrogen-potassium ATPase antagonist omeprazole have no effect on intrinsic factor while substantially reducing acid secretion. Cobalamin in food is bound to animal protein. Cobalamin deficiency due to inadequate dietary intake is rarely seen in extreme vegetarians (vegans). In the stomach cobalamin is liberated from its protein binding by peptic digestion and bound to R-proteins. Hypochlorhydria or achlorhydria, whether medically induced or not, may impair cobalamin uptake. The cobalamin-R-protein complex is split by pancreatic enzymes in the duodenum, where cobalamin is bound to intrinsic factor. Pancreatic insufficiency may lead to cobalamin deficiency. Lack of intrinsic factor is the commonest cause of cobalamin deficiency; very rarely, aberrant forms of intrinsic factor are produced, but the clinical syndrome is similar. Gram-negative anaerobe bacteria bind the cobalamin-intrinsic factor complex, and bacterial overgrowth of the small intestine diminishes cobalamin resorption. Parasitic infections with fish tape-worm and Giardia lamblia are also associated with cobalamin malabsorption. The cobalamin-intrinsic factor complex binds to the ileal receptors in the terminal ileum. Cobalamin absorption may be impaired after resection or by diseases affecting more than 50 cm of the terminal ileum, such as Crohn's disease, coeliac disease, tuberculosis, lymphoma or radiation. There is clearly a wide diversity in the aetiology of cobalamin deficiency, which requires a versatile diagnostic approach.},

The authors present a study of 20 cases of celiac disease in the State of Rio Grande do Norte where there had not been any cases diagnosed before 1978. Ethnic aspects in the State seem to have influenced the occurrence of the disease since the European miscigenation has been more frequent than that of negroes and local indians. The cases are analysed in this paper and correlated with the literature.},

Our aim was to establish whether or not the patients also suffered from celiac disease. Celiac diseases was found in 6 patients. This result and the individual cases reported in the literature suggest that this triad of diseases (celiac disease, posterior cerebral calcifications and epilepsy) are casually related. The same HLA phenotype was found in all 10 patients, i.e., including the cases without celiac disease, suggesting an underlying disorder of the immune system. Our results emphasize that particular attention should be paid to a search for celiac disease in all patients with epilepsy and posterior cerebral calcifications.},

   abstract = {There have been anecdotal reports of an association between coeliac disease and epilepsy with cerebral calcifications that resemble those of the Sturge-Weber syndrome. A series of patients who had epilepsy with calcifications, in whom coeliac disease (CD) was incidentally observed, prompted us to study this association. 43 patients (15 male, age range 4.6-30.7 years) were selected from two series. 31 patients with cerebral calcifications of unexplained origin and epilepsy (series A) underwent intestinal biopsy. 12 patients with CD and epilepsy (series B) underwent computed tomography. Antibodies to gluten, folic acid serum concentrations, were measured, and HLA typing was done in most patients. 24 of the series A patients were identified as having CD on the basis of a flat intestinal mucosa (15/22 with a high concentration of serum antigluten), and 5 series B patients showed cerebral calcifications, giving a total of 29 cases with the combination of CD, epilepsy, and cerebral calcifications (CEC). In 27 of these CEC patients, calcifications were located in the parieto-occipital regions. Only 2 of the series A patients had gastrointestinal symptoms at the time of intestinal biopsy; most patients had recurrent diarrhoea, anaemia, and other symptoms suggestive of CD in the first 3 years of life. The epilepsy in CEC patients was poorly responsive to antiepileptic drugs. Gluten-free diet beneficially affected the course of epilepsy only when started soon after epilepsy onset. Cases of "atypical Sturge-Weber syndrome" (characterised by serpiginous cerebral calcifications and epilepsy without facial port-wine naevus) should be reviewed, and CD should be ruled out in all cases of epilepsy and cerebral calcifications of unexplained origin.},

By combining the results of anti-gliadin IgA and IgG determinations the overall sensitivity of the assay was found to be 100% and the specificity 96% for children and 99% for adults. Significantly elevated antigliadin IgA and IgG antibodies were detected in all 20 children and all 25 adults with untreated CD. False positive results were found in 1/79 histologically normal control and 5/86 disease control children, while for adults false positive rates were 0/74 and 1/34 for the healthy and disease control groups, respectively. Anti-gliadin IgA and IgG was measured in serum samples from 52 coeliac patients (11 children and 41 adults) treated with a gluten-free diet (GFD). Each of the children and 28 of the adults who followed a strict GFD had significantly lower IgA and IgG levels than untreated CD patients. The serum anti-gliadin IgA and IgG levels of the 13 adults not complying with a GFD were similar to those found for untreated CD patients. This assay is recommended as a screening test for CD as well as a tool for follow-up of treated patients.},

The study group comprised 27 patients with coeliac disease (mean age 12.3 years) and 19 healthy controls matched by sex and age. Intestinal permeability was studied by measuring the urinary excretion of two sugars, lactulose and L-rhamnose, before and six hours after the ingestion of five palatable biscuits made with 50 g of gluten powder. The patients with coeliac disease had been on a gluten free diet during the previous two years. After the gluten load lactulose and L-rhamnose urinary excretion changed significantly in patients, and a significant increase in the lactulose: L-rhamnose ratio was also observed. No significant changes were observed in the controls. In view of the modification of the three biopsies diagnostic protocol made by the European Society for Paediatric Gastroenterology and Nutrition, permeability tests associated with single gluten challenges may be an added contribution to the accuracy of the diagnosis in childhood.},

   abstract = {The ethinyloestradiol (EO2) component of oral contraceptive steroids is extensively conjugated with sulphate by the gut wall. The ability of gastrointestinal mucosa to conjugate EO2 has been examined in vitro in samples of mucosa taken from normal women as well as from women with coeliac disease. The percentage conjugation per mg dry weight for normal tissue (n = 11) was 17.1 +/- 6.4 (mean +/- s.d.) while in untreated coeliac tissue (n = 6) the figure was 6.3 +/- 3.6% (P less than 0.01). In tissue from patients with treated coeliac disease (n = 5) the figure was 12.1 +/- 3.2%. Thus the ability of intestinal mucosa to conjugate ethinyloestradiol was significantly reduced in patients with coeliac disease, and restored towards normal following treatment. However, in patients with coeliac disease the pharmacokinetics of ethinyloestradiol were not significantly different from normal controls.
PIP: Physicians took several small intestinal mucosal samples from female patients with or with out celiac disease at the Royal Liverpool and Broadgreen Hospital in Liverpool, England, to determine in vitro the mucosa's ability to metabolize ethinyl estradiol and levonorgestrel. They compared this in vitro ability with the pharmacokinetics of the 2 steroids in 5 women with celiac disease. The percentage conjugation of ethinyl celiac mucosa (17.1% mg dry weight vs. 6.3% mg dry weight; p .01); it was also greater than it was for celiac mucosa from patients treated with a gluten-free diet (12.1% mg dry weight; p .05). The percentage of conjugate as sulphate was 85% for untreated celiac mucosa. Among the 5 celiac disease patients, no significant differences in any of the pharmacokinetic parameters for levonorgestrel or ethinyl estradiol existed between pre- and post-gluten free diet treatment. These parameters included area under the curve, volume of distribution, and bioavailability. The physicians were able to compare the in vitro ability of intestinal mucosa to metabolize ethinyl estradiol with 1st in vivo pharmacokinetics in 2 patients. In both cases, the in vitro mucosal conjugation rose while the in vivo bioavailability fell (4.4% to 12.1% and 75.4% to 43.2% for patient 1, and 3.6% to 9.1% and 86.7% to 55.2% for patient 2). These findings suggest that celiac disease weakens the ability of intestinal mucosa to conjugate ethinyl estradiol, but a gluten-free diet can adequately improve this ability.

Aiming to assess the reliability of this method and its usefulness in the diagnosis of intestinal enteropathies, we measured the steatocrit in 747 healthy children and 442 children with diarrhea grouped according to diagnosis. The steatocrit was found to correlate strictly (r = 0.93) with the chemical measurement of fecal fat. Reference values and ranges were established. The maximal steatocrit was observed in neonates; afterwards, it progressively decreased to an undetectable level in children older than 2 years of age. A steatocrit abnormally high for age was found in 20% of patients with acute diarrhea and in 53% of those with chronic diarrhea. All celiac patients with a gluten-containing diet showed a marked increase of steatocrit. We conclude that the steatocrit is a reliable and easy-to-perform test, which quickly provides valuable information in the diagnostic workup of the child with diarrhea.},

The natural killer and large granular lymphocytes cells were characterised by either immunohistochemical or phase contrast microscopical procedures on the initial biopsies from 15 children with coeliac disease. They were compared with seven individuals with partial villus atrophy and eight with normal villous morphology. Although the histological findings were similar in the initial biopsies of all patients with coeliac disease, the patients with permanent coeliac disease had a significantly lower number (0.41(0.61)cells/mm2) of large granular lymphocytes and natural killer cells compared with those patients with abortive coeliac disease (11.93 (6.23) cells/mm2). Those in the permanent group developed a significantly more pronounced flat mucosa after gluten challenge or provocation compared with the abortive group and had to remain on a strict gluten free diet in contrast with those in the abortive group. Thus, the occurrence of intraepithelial large granular lymphocytes and natural killer cells characterises two distinctly different coeliac diseases. Based on our results neither the histological evaluation of the biopsy nor the utilisation of the revised European Society for Paediatric Gastroenterology and Nutrition (ESPGAN) Criteria are adequate in diagnosing the two types of coeliac disease.},

At four months, permeability in the normal diet group was greater than in controls, although comparable with that in the gluten free diet group. Permeability in the normal diet group increased further in conjunction with the development of partial villus atrophy and reduced alkaline phosphatase activity, and by 12 months permeability was significantly greater than in their gluten free diet litter mates and the control dogs.

Affected setters, reared on a normal wheat containing diet, exhibited partial villus atrophy, intraepithelial lymphocyte infiltration, reduced brush border alkaline phosphatase activity, and increased intestinal permeability. Gluten sensitivity was shown by introduction of a gluten free diet, which resulted in resolution of morphological and biochemical abnormalities and decreased intestinal permeability, and subsequent gluten challenge, which resulted in relapse. In contrast, littermates reared exclusively on a cereal free diet showed minimal changes when challenged with gluten, apart from intraepithelial lymphocyte infiltration.

Anti-gliadin antibody concentrations were lower in affected dogs than controls, and correlated with immune complex formation as assessed by C1q binding. The study suggested a modified immune response in dogs with increased intestinal permeability, although there was no major systemic antibody response to dietary antigens.},

   abstract = {Dietary folate, a vitamin required for DNA synthesis and cell regeneration, occurs as pteroylpolyglutamates that are hydrolyzed to pteroylglutamate during the process of intestinal absorption. Studies from our laboratory over the past 15 years have shown that jejunal brush-border folate hydrolase is essential and rate-limiting in folate absorption. Brush-border folate hydrolase activity and pteroylpolyglutamate hydrolysis are inhibited in disease and conditions associated with folate deficiency, including celiac and tropical sprue, the use of sulfasalazine to treat inflammatory bowel disease, and chronic alcoholism. Brush-border folate hydrolase is an exopeptidase located on the jejunal brush-border surface that liberates hydrolytic products of pteroylpolyglutamates in a progressive fashion, with a final release of pteroylglutamate. Subsequent steps in folate absorption include uptake by a brush-border folate-binding-protein receptor and transport across the brush-border membrane into the enterocyte. These steps are probably followed by an intracellular synthesis of pteroylglutamates for folate-dependent reactions and intracellular hydrolysis to pteroylglutamate for transport across the basolateral membrane to the portal circulation. In pigs, the active form of jejunal brush-border folate hydrolase has a molecular weight of 240 kd and is probably a homodimer of the 120-kd protein found after immunoprecipitation with specific antibody. Regulating the synthesis and expression of brush-border folate hydrolase may be critical to the availability of dietary folate.},

Intake of dietary gluten may hence induce local complement activation and mucosal damage. Jejunal tissue sections from adult patients with celiac disease were examined by immunofluorescence with monoclonal antibodies to activation neoepitopes in C3b and the terminal complement complex (TCC). Subepithelial deposition of TCC was observed in 93% of 28 untreated and in 57% of 23 partly treated study subjects. The immunofluorescence staining intensity was well correlated with the serum level of gluten-specific IgG and IgM (but not IgA), the number of mucosal IgG-producing cells, and the degree of villous atrophy. Similar immune deposits were not observed in 5 successfully treated patients with celiac disease, 5 patients with dermatitis herpetiformis without jejunal villous atrophy, and 90% of 21 control patients with histologically normal jejunal mucosa. Gluten challenge increased the amount of subepithelial TCC and produced additional C3b deposition, suggesting recent complement activation. Ingested gluten might thus, via Ig-mediated subepithelial complement activation, damage the surface epithelium in celiac disease and induce compensatory crypt hyperplasia.},

   abstract = {OBJECTIVES: An explanation for an incomplete catch-up growth in children with coeliac disease has not yet been found. The marker of growth procollagen-III-propeptide could possible provide a better understanding of the actual regulation of growth in the situation. METHODS: The investigation was made in children with established coeliac disease (n = 30). A commercial radioimmunoassay was used for the measurement of PC-III-P. RESULTS: A close relationship (r = 0.75; P < 0.0001) was found between height velocity and PC-III-P in serum of coeliac children. There was also a good correlation (r = 0.54; P < 0.001; n = 72) with serum levels of alcaline phosphatase. Only weak correlations were found to insulin-like growth factor I (r = 0.33; P < 0.05; n = 62), to urinary calcium (r = 0.27; P < 0.05; n = 62), and to the maturation of bones (r = 0.25; P < 0.05; n = 54). In accordance with the good correlation between height velocity and PC-III-P normal results were found in normal growing children with coeliac disease. Reduced serum levels of PC-III-P were found in coeliac children who failed to show a complete catch-up growth while on a gluten-free diet. CONCLUSIONS: Gluen challenge, as required for the confirmation of the diagnosis, led to a significant further decrease of the values of PC-III-P. Parallel investigations for IgA endomysium antibodies in serum suggest that besides dietary errors additional factors may impede growth, or in other words that disorders of growth regulation persist in some patients with coeliac disease even under treatment. This assumption will have to be tested by further investigations.},

   abstract = {Coeliac disease in children is frequently associated with a slow growth rate. This observation may be linked to the malabsorption that occurs in these patients; however, the underlying mechanism remains unknown. To better understand this phenomenon, we have studied the growth patterns of 153 patients with coeliac disease for 2-9 years. Gastro-intestinal biopsies were performed before and after gluten exclusion. In a second group of 79 children, somatostatin levels and binding properties in the plasma and jejunal mucosa were measured. In a third group of 40 patients we measured insulin-like growth factor I (IGF-I) and IGF-binding protein 3 (IGF-BP3) levels. We found that in children diagnosed before 2 years of age weight was the most affected growth parameter. In children diagnosed after this age, height was more affected. Suppression of gluten intake induced an acceleration of growth velocity. Although plasma levels of somatostatin were not significantly altered, somatostatin concentrations in the jejunal mucosa of patients in the active phase of the disease were significantly elevated (p < 0.05). Children with coeliac disease exhibited significantly lower levels of IGF-BP3 when compared to patients with normal stature and growth velocities. In contrast, these patients showed an increase in IGF-BP3 levels after gluten exclusion from the diet.},

We have therefore investigated the brain availability of the monoamine precursors tryptophan and tyrosine in 15 untreated children with coeliac disease and 12 treated children with coeliac disease as well as in 12 control children. Significantly decreased plasma concentrations of tryptophan were found in untreated children (mean (SD) 13 (4) mumols/l, p less than 0.001) compared with treated children (31 (13) mumols/l), and in both groups of coeliac children when compared with control children (81 (22) mumols/l). A significantly lower ratio of plasma tryptophan to large neutral amino acids (tyrosine, valine, isoleucine, leucine, and phenylalanine) was also observed, which could indicate impaired brain availability of tryptophan in coeliac children and was more pronounced in untreated children. The impaired availability of tryptophan could produce decreased central serotonin synthesis and in turn behaviour disorders in children with coeliac disease.},

   abstract = {The fractional absorption of vitamin B12 (FAB12) was measured by a double-isotope technique specially adapted for children. In six celiac children on a strict gluten-free diet and with a normal small intestinal biopsy, the FAB12 performed in the fasting patient averaged 30% (23-40%). After gluten challenge for a mean of 2 months (range 1-4), when mucosal damage was demonstrated by biopsy, the average fasting FAB12 in these patients decreased to 10% (0-17%) (p less than 0.05). However, when the FAB12 test was repeated by means of stimulation by a B12-free meal 1-3 weeks later, while the patients were still on a diet containing gluten, a significant increase was observed (mean 21%, range 14-27%) (p less than 0.05). In four of the six patients the B12 absorption was further evaluated by repeating the FAB12 test by means of intravenous cholecystokinin (CCK) stimulation (n = 3) or by administration of exocrine pancreas enzyme supplementation (EPES) (n = 2) or cobinamide (n = 1). These tests all showed FAB12 values within the range of the meal-stimulated FAB12. Moreover, in eight gluten-free celiac children with normal biopsies, no difference was found between fasting and meal-stimulated FAB12 values. Therefore, it is likely that the early-onset B12 malabsorption observed in the gluten-challenged celiac child with upper-small-intestinal mucosal damage is in part due to an insufficient stimulation of the exocrine pancreas when using the standard fasting B12 absorption test.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS)},

Among diseases, absorption disorders are the most frequent causes of iron deficiency. Tardyferon has been used for controlling iron deficiency in 21 children younger than two years of age not suffering from malabsorption and in 38 children suffering from coeliac disease. At the onset of the disease 71% of coeliac disease patients suffered from iron deficiency. The normalization of iron metabolism of these patients could be achieved with oral treatment of 5-6 mg Fe++/kg/day of 3-6 months. Iron deficiency of patients with initially normal ferritin level developed as a result of the intensive weight gain occurring in response to the gliadin-free diet. After the patients had been put on a gliadin containing diet again, hyposiderosis also occurred more frequently. Tardyferon therapy was well tolerated by the patients, in the infants taking bebe-Tardyferon difficulties of dosage or notable side-effects were not observed.},

   abstract = {Levels of serum IgA, IgG, and IgG subclass antibodies to a variety of dietary antigens were determined by enzyme linked immunosorbent assays in 14 adults with untreated coeliac disease and in 10 disease controls selected because of raised total IgG activities. The untreated coeliacs showed somewhat higher total IgG activity (p approximately 0.05) and significantly raised IgA and IgG1 + IgG3 activities to gliadin but reduced IgG4 activity (p less than 0.02) compared with the controls. High IgA and IgG1 + IgG3 activities were positively correlated (r = 0.67, p less than 0.01), and so were IgG and IgG4 activities (r = 0.64, p less than 0.02). Conversely, a high IgG2 response to gliadin appeared related to a low IgA response (r = 0.55, p less than 0.05). The IgG2 response was most prominent to oat flour antigens, followed by IgG1; and the main response to soy antigens resided in IgG1, followed by IgG2 in both disease groups. There was no difference in antibody activities to oat and soy between the two groups, and raised activity to bovine serum albumin was seldom encountered. The IgA activity to alpha-lactalbumin and ovalbumin tended to be increased in the coeliacs compared with the controls. The IgG4 subclass dominated the IgG response to beta-lactoglobulin and ovalbumin and was often raised to alpha-lactalbumin, especially in the disease controls. The IgG subclass pattern to casein parallelled that to gliadin with dominance of the IgG1- and IgG3-subclass activities, especially in the coeliacs. The phlogistic potential of a response in these two subclasses might be relevant to the pathogenesis of coeliac disease and could contribute to a raised IgA gliadin response by increasing mucosal permeability. IgA activity seemed to be highest against antigens usually involved in IgE mediated food allergy.},

Thirty-seven children (mean age 2.6 +/- 2.1 years) with total atrophy of the intestinal villi and 79 controls (mean age 3.5 +/- 2.8 years) were studied. All subjects underwent a small-bowel biopsy, a D-xylose absorption test, a rapid triglyceride absorption test, and a steatocrit determination first on an uncontrolled diet and then again after a standard fatty meal. The steatocrit test after a fatty meal did not detect any false-positive or false-negative results, while the D-xylose test showed two false-negative and four false-positive results, and the rapid triglyceride absorption test found two false-negative and 23 false-positive results. We conclude that the determination of steatocrit after a standard fatty meal is a useful, simple, and noninvasive test to identify patients with total intestinal villous atrophy.},

The measurements were made after the diagnosis was established, 6-8 months and 1-1.5 years after administration of the agliadin diet. In celiac disease children, there was an increase of the content of DNA and RNA in enterocyte nuclei of the intestinal villi and cryptae and lack of gradient in the distribution of the amount of nucleic acids along the length of the villi, which characterized the hyper-regeneration type of small intestinal mucosa atrophy. The recovery of the crypta/villus gradient accompanied by the normalization of the content of nucleic acids, comparable with the analogous indicators of the unchanged mucosa of the small intestine, allows regarding the measurements of the content of DNA and RNA in the nuclei as an index of reparative capacity of enterocytes in children afflicted with celiac disease.},

   abstract = {Reports from other laboratories have shown that atrial natriuretic peptide (ANP) stores in sympathetic ganglia are increased during dietary NaCl supplementation in normotensive rats. We have previously demonstrated that dietary NaCl supplementation in NaCl sensitive spontaneously hypertensive rats (SHR-S) exacerbates hypertension and enhances peripheral sympathetic nervous system activity, while NaCl resistant Wistar-Kyoto (WKY) rats show neither response. Since endogenous ANP may inhibit ganglion transmission, an inability of SHR-S to increase ganglion ANP appropriately in response to high NaCl feeding could contribute to the NaCl induced increase in sympathetic nervous system activity and blood pressure in this model, while an increase in ganglion ANP in NaCl supplemented WKY would tend to prevent sympathetic activity and blood pressure from rising. The current study tested the hypothesis that ganglion ANP levels increase in WKY but not in SHR-S during dietary NaCl supplementation. Male SHR-S and WKY rats were placed on 1% or 8% NaCl diets at 7 weeks of age. The rats were decapitated without prior anesthesia 3 weeks later, and the superior cervical and celiac ganglia were removed for the measurement of ANP by radioimmunoassay. Dietary NaCl supplementation produced significant increases in blood pressure in SHR-S, but not in WKY rats; the high NaCl diet was associated with significant increases in the ANP content of superior cervical and celiac ganglia in WKY rats, but not in SHR-S.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS)},

   abstract = {In summary, research in immunogenetics, protein chemistry, and molecular biology is leading to a greater understanding of the contribution of genetic, environmental, and immunologic factors to the etiopathogenesis of celiac disease. Taken together, the findings discussed in this article suggest that understanding of the contribution of a major genetic factor to celiac disease susceptibility is closer at hand. Thus, the pathogenesis of celiac disease appears to involve an interaction between the gene products of the HLA class II D region on chromosome 6 and the gliadin proteins, possibly because of their homology with an intestinal viral protein. A logical extension of these findings would predict that T cells, particularly CD4 T cells, play a key role in the pathogenesis of celiac disease by virtue of their recognition of a gliadin or viral peptide in conjunction with the HLA class II D-region gene products. Nonetheless, the precise mechanisms by which the HLA class II genes and their products contribute to celiac disease is not known. Further, the precise peptide sequence in gliadin that interacts with the relevant HLA class II D-region molecule is not known. Finally, the role of CD4 T cells in the pathogenesis of celiac disease, either directly or indirectly by their ability to regulate other T-cell subsets and antibody-producing B cells, remains to be defined. The lessons learned and to be learned from celiac disease will substantially increase our understanding of the mechanisms that are important in this disease as well as in other intestinal and HLA-associated autoimmune diseases.},

Gynaecological examination was normal. Radiography of the small intestine revealed coarse rugal pattern of the duodenum. Endoscopically obtained duodenal biopsy demonstrated villous atrophy. Elevated anti-gliadin antibody titres (IgG 49.9 U, IgA 52.3 U), as well as the response to a gluten-free diet confirmed the diagnosis of monosymptomatic coeliac disease. Although anaemia is one of the characteristic features of coeliac disease, it is rare as the only sign. The risk of delayed diagnosis is especially high in women before menopause.},

Serum T3 and T4 levels for each group were compared with those in children with normal gut mucous membrane. Blood serum T3 and T4 were assayed with OPIDI kit (manufactured in Swierk). Serum T4 levels were significantly lower in children with mucous membrane atrophy in comparison with dystrophic children and normal gut mucous membrane. Both serum T3 and T4 were significantly lowered in the youngest children upto 12 months of life with mucous membranes atrophy. Serum T3 and T4 concentrations were below the normal values in 4 youngest children. Blood serum T3 and T4 levels did not depend on the morphology of the intestinal villi in children treated with gluten-free diet (some children did not observe the diet and had atrophic lesions to the mucous membrane of the small intestine). Blood serum T3 level was relatively increased in children of group II with mucous membrane regeneration; in comparison with the value determined in the period of active disease.},

However, celiac disease is primarily a small intestinal mucosal disorder, and so we have examined the possibility that secreted, mucosal IgA anti-gliadin antibody might provide a more relevant measure of gluten sensitivity than that obtained from serum tests. Serum IgA anti-gliadin antibody and serum, salivary, and small intestinal aspirate IgA anti-gliadin antibody were measured by enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay. Serum IgA and IgG anti-gliadin antibody were markedly increased in untreated celiacs (N = 31) as compared to normals (N = 20) or disease controls (N = 39) (P less than 0.0001). Levels were lower in treated (N = 30) than untreated celiacs (P less than 0.001). In intestinal aspirates both untreated and treated patients had similar levels of IgA anti-gliadin antibody (P = 0.48), but both were significantly higher than in controls (P less than 0.01). Salivary IgA anti-gliadin antibody, by contrast, was not increased in celiac patients as compared to controls. Serum IgA anti-gliadin antibody was the most sensitive (84%) and specific (95%) test for detecting untreated celiac disease. It was also the most useful in patient follow-up where it provides an early objective indicator of adherence to a gluten-free diet. Mucosal IgA responses to gliadin in celiac disease appear to be compartmentalized, with different portions of the gastrointestinal tract functioning as separate immunological organs. Our results also demonstrate that serum and secretory IgA production are under independent control.},

Hydraulic occluders were placed on the abdominal aorta (just below the celiac artery) and the thoracic vena cava to vary mesenteric and hindquarters arterial pressure (MAP), which was monitored via a catheter positioned in the distal abdominal aorta. Heart rate (HR) and lumbar sympathetic nerve activity (LSNA) were monitored as indexes of sympathetic nervous system activity. Pressure-velocity curves were obtained by aortic and caval occlusions on two consecutive days; first after a 24-h fast and after approximately 24 h of ad libitum refeeding. In the fed state, mesenteric velocity was significantly increased and MAP was decreased slightly; the slight decrease in MAP was counteracted by significant increases in HR and LSNA, whereas hindquarters perfusion was unchanged. The mesenteric and hindquarters pressure-velocity curves were all highly linear (r greater than or equal to 0.9) and showed no evidence of autoregulation in the fasted or fed state when pressure was changed by either the aortic or the caval occlusions. We conclude that autoregulation plays a minor role in the short-term regulation of mesenteric blood flow in the conscious rabbit.},

Three of these children had elevated IgG antibody levels (greater than 0.25 units). Elevated IgG antibody levels with normal IgA levels were demonstrated in 11 short children who had normal duodenal biopsy results.

Fifty two patients (64.1%) were on a strict gluten free diet; 18 (22.3%) admitted an occasional gluten intake; 11 (13.6%) were on a normal diet. Symptoms were more frequent in non-compliers that in compliers. There was no appreciable difference between the groups in regard to height and body-mass index, but patients on a normal diet were lighter than the others. Small bowel biopsy was performed on 18 patients with various histological findings. Antigliadin antibodies and antiendomysium antibodies were good indications of a patient's gluten free diet compliance and mucosal damage.},

The results showed a significant increase of the L/M ratios under normal diet, with respect to a control population. This increase was related to an increased L urinary excretion and to a decrease in M excretion. During gluten-free diet a normalization of the L/M ratios was observed. Reintroducing gluten altered the L/M ratios by increasing the L intestinal permeability and decreasing the M intestinal permeability.

   abstract = {Intestinal inflammation seems invariably to be associated with increased epithelial proliferation. In the small bowel the pathological consequences of this area an increase in the crypt proliferative compartment and a decrease in the absorptive villus compartment, which can lead to malabsorption. In the colon, it is more difficult to examine changes in cell proliferation, but using Ki67, epithelial proliferation has been shown to be increased in ulcerative colitis and parasitic infection. The teleological advantage of increasing epithelial proliferation during intestinal inflammation is presumably in an effort to get rid of parasitized or infected epithelial cells, or to rapidly replace cells which have been lost. Rejection of helminth parasites from rodent small bowel is associated with partial villous atrophy and crypt hypertrophy, which is probably part of the host response making the mucosa inhospitable to the parasites. The short-term nutritional disadvantage of malabsorption is outweighed by the long-term advantage of being parasite-free. However, when the intestinal inflammation is elicited by a dietary constituent, the consequences are only pathological. At the moment there is no information as to the mechanisms by which inflammatory cells alter mucosal morphology and epithelial renewal. The restructuring of mucosal morphology in the flat-mucosa involves considerable adaptation of the connective tissue elements of the lamina propria. Whether this occurs in response to changes in epithelial renewal is not known. Finally, it is clear that activated T cells in the lamina propria can produce a flat-mucosa. In diseases such as Trichuris dysentery and ulcerative colitis there is no or very little T cell activation, even though epithelial proliferation is increased. Increased epithelial proliferation therefore may occur in response to different inflammatory stimuli.},

   abstract = {The celiac disease syndrome is characterized by structural and ultrastructural alterations of the small intestine mucosa. According to criteria by European Society of Paediatric Gastroenterology and Nutrition, the conclusive diagnosis of celiac disease in children depends on the demonstration of histological relapse of the mucosa after reintroduction of gluten in the diet, as this syndrome is a permanent condition of gluten intolerance. Under these diseased conditions, the structure of the intestinal villi has been studied by light microscopy; morphological alterations were revealed only when the gluten challenge induced a clinical relapse. Scanning electron microscopy analyses of the intestinal mucosa in celiac diseased patients showed a strikingly uniform destruction of the villi with changes in their dimensions and arrangement. At high magnification the enterocytes were irregular in size and shape with a decrease and disruption of the glycocalyx. Reductions in length and density of microvilli were also clearly identified. Although these scanning electron microscopy findings could not demonstrate a relationship between the degrees of mucosal atrophy and the duration of the gluten challenge, they nevertheless revealed early stages of fine villous alterations that cannot be detected by the presently employed low resolution light microscopic techniques.},

The clinical presentation and spectrum of abnormal laboratory findings in these 8 cases are described in detail. It is concluded that laboratory parameters indicating malabsorption, especially hematologic changes, are helpful for the detection of the oligo- and asymptomatic form of non-tropical sprue, and that, in cases with undetermined anemia, this form of sprue must be considered in etiologic differential diagnosis. Finally, it seems advisable to perform a biopsy as a routine procedure during endoscopy in cases with unclear anemia.},

Gallbladder emptying, measured by cholescintigraphy, and plasma CCK levels, measured by radioimmunoassay, were studied during infusion of graded doses of the CCK analog cerulein in six coeliac patients with subtotal villous atrophy, six coeliac patients on a gluten-free diet with normal villous architecture, and nine control subjects. Both in the patients and in the controls infusion of stepwise increasing doses of cerulein, in the range of 1-16 ng.kg-1.h-1, induced dose-related changes in plasma CCK-like immunoreactivity (CCK-LI) (r = 0.99; p less than 0.001) and gallbladder emptying (r greater than 0.97; p less than 0.01-p less than 0.001). Plasma CCK-LI and gallbladder responses were not significantly different among untreated coeliac patients, treated coeliac patients, and controls. Gallbladder sensitivity to cerulein in untreated and treated coeliac patients was not significantly different from that in controls. It is concluded that the abnormally decreased gallbladder contraction in coeliac patients is the result of a reduced endogenous CCK secretion and not of a lack of end-organ responsiveness to CCK.},

Clinical symptoms occurred more frequently in patients on a gluten containing diet, but not in patients on a semi-strict diet. Occasional intake of small amounts (0.06-2 g/day) of gluten did not produce increased concentrations of antigliadin antibodies but resulted in an appreciably increased crypt epithelial volume and expanded crypt intraepithelial lymphocyte population.},

However other genetic factors are probably relevant, since about 10% of the patients with DH and CD lack the DQA1*0501/B1*0201 heterodimer while the majority of individuals presenting this genotype and also being exposed to gluten diets did not suffer from these diseases. To evaluate the role of other genes, 36 Northern Italian children with DH were analysed for DNA polymorphisms at HLA-DP and immunoglobulin (Ig) heavy chain loci. DPA1*0201 and DPB1*1301 frequencies were higher in patients than in controls (Pc = 0.0357 and Pc = 0.0273). With respect to immunoglobulin heavy chain restriction fragment length polymorphisms (RFLP), the 4.6 kb SacI RFLP at the switch alpha 2 gene was more frequent in patients (0.13) than in controls (0.019; Pc = 0.036). Moreover, rare alleles or duplications in the switch regions occurred more frequently in the patients than in the controls. These results support the hypothesis of a multifactorial inheritance of DH, the HLA and Ig constant heavy chain genes being some of the loci contributing to the susceptibility. In accordance with previous CD studies, these data also confirm that DP subregion is probably involved in the pathogenesis of DH.},

Investigations suggested malabsorption, and small intestinal biopsies demonstrated a flattened mucosa with subepithelial collagen deposition. Colonic biopsies also showed a thickened subepithelial collagen band as well as a striking lamina propria inflammatory cell infiltrate. Symptomatic remission was induced with a gluten/lactose-free diet, oral prednisone, and sulfasalazine and has been maintained with gluten restriction alone. Repeat biopsies after 2 months demonstrated restoration of normal small intestinal and colonic collagen bands; only a chronic inflammatory cell infiltrate (consistent with microscopic/lymphocytic colitis) persisted in colonic biopsies. We propose that, in this instance, collagenous enterocolitis represented a diffuse manifestation of gluten sensitivity.},

Gastrointestinal symptoms were commonest in young adults (20-39 years) and less frequent in children (0-19 years). Anaemia, low serum levels of folic acid, albumin and calcium, and raised serum alkaline phosphatase may be of help in raising the index of diagnostic suspicion, but in over half of our patients with clinically and histologically active disease these values were within normal limits. In patients adhering to a gluten free diet remission of symptoms correlated well with histological response; the continuation of symptoms indicated a higher incidence of histological abnormality. No patient not complying to the diet had normal histology on repeat biopsy. Five patients died over the ten year period, one from a small bowel lymphoma.},

The I biopsy has not been performed in 96 children, the II biopsy--in 136 children, gluten-free diet has not been observed in 105 children after the I biopsy. Other causes of diagnostic failures included: prolongation of the consecutive stages and improper histological evaluation, change of biopsies order, erroneous clinical evaluation. Diagnosis according to ESPGAN recommendations is practically very difficult and time consuming. Immunological markers of coeliac disease (IgA EmA, ARA) should lead to simplification and adjustment of those recommendations in Poland.},

Oral corticosteroids have been used for patients who seem to be resistant to gluten withdrawal but preparations with low systemic bioavailability might be preferable. We have given a new glucocorticoid (fluticasone propionate) to 12 adults with untreated coeliac disease for six weeks while they were on a normal diet. One patient defaulted and one suffered a relapse in a pre-existing neoplasm. Excluding these, there was an improvement of symptoms, a mean weight gain of 2 kg, and a rise in albumin of 5.4 g/l. There was a significant improvement in the lactulose/mannitol excretion ratio (p less than 0.05) and in all histological variables examined in paired biopsy specimens (surface and crypt intraepithelial lymphocyte/enterocyte and goblet cell/enterocyte ratios and enterocyte height, p less than 0.01 or better). In six paired specimens sucrase and alkaline phosphatase activity increased in all (p less than 0.05) and lactase in five of six. No appreciable side effects were observed, but two patients had suppressed cortisol values and synacthen responses at six weeks. A further three, with normal pretrial results, had a blunted tetracosactrin response at six weeks. Fluticasone propionate seems worthy of further assessment in the treatment of coeliac disease as an adjunct to gluten withdrawal.},

The sensitivity of the test was 95.5% and the specificity was 87.0% on initial diagnosis. On a gluten-free diet reduced antibody levels were seen in all patients. During gluten challenge 11 of 13 children showed an increase in anti-gliadin-IgA concentration. Of the remaining 2 without antibody elevation IgA deficiency became manifest in one patient, the other had a nearly normal mucosa on small intestine biopsy. Provided that IgA deficiency is ruled out and the gluten intake is sufficient the test seems to be useful for screening and might replace biopsy after gluten challenge in cases of increasing antibody levels.},

We studied the absorption of wheat starch and the effect of pancreatic enzyme substitution in seven patients with chronic pancreatitis and steathorrea. The malabsorption was determined from hydrogen breath tests with lactulose standards as reference. Without enzyme substitution, wheat starch (50 g) was absorbed to a lesser extent than in healthy controls (p less than 0.05). The mouth-to-cecum transit time was prolonged and correlated positively to the fat excretion before substitution with pancreatic enzymes (sigma = 1). The enzyme substitution increased the absorption of wheat starch to values seen in healthy controls (p less than 0.05) and reduced the mouth-to-cecum transit time by 19.8%.},

During the first 2 d mild symptoms of intolerance developed in 63% of patients on whole milk, 37% on acidified milk, and 54% on LFD whereas severe intolerance, necessitating withdrawal, was encountered in 22% receiving whole milk and none receiving LFD. Stool weights and fat excretion on day 3 were greater (P less than 0.02) in the remaining milk-fed patients whereas nitrogen balance remained strongly positive in all three groups. Eighty-seven percent of patients were methane producers, and high excretion rates were associated with better milk tolerance.

The aims were to define features of the secretory immune response (IgA and IgM concentrations and antibody values to gliadin and other food proteins measured by enzyme linked immunosorbent assay (ELISA)) in active disease and remission, and to establish whether secretions obtained by relatively non-invasive techniques (saliva and gut lavage fluid) can be used for indirect measurements of events in the jejunum. Serum, saliva, and jejunal aspirate from 26 adults with untreated coeliac disease, 22 treated patients, and 28 immunologically normal control subjects were studied, together with intestinal secretions obtained by gut lavage from 15 untreated and 19 treated patients with coeliac disease and 25 control subjects. Jejunal aspirate IgA and IgM and gut lavage fluid IgM concentrations were significantly raised in patients with untreated coeliac disease; the lavage fluid IgM concentration remained higher in patients with treated coeliac disease than in controls. Serum and salivary immunoglobulin concentrations were similar in the three groups. Patients with untreated coeliac disease had higher values of antibodies to gliadin compared with treated patients and control subjects in all body fluids tested; these were predominantly of IgA and IgG classes in serum, and of IgA and IgM classes in jejunal aspirate and gut lavage fluid. Values of salivary IgA antibodies to gliadin were significantly higher in untreated coeliacs, though antibody values were generally low, with a large overlap between coeliac disease patients and control subjects. In treated patients, with proved histological recovery on gluten free diet, serum IgA antigliadin antibody values fell to control values, though serum IgG antigliadin antibody values remained moderately raised. In contrast, there was persistence of secretory antigliadin antibodies in treated patients (particularly IgM antibody) in both jejunal aspirate and gut lavage fluid. Antibody responses to betalactoglobulin and ovalbumin were similar to those for gliadin, including persistence of high intestinal antibody values in patients with treated coeliac disease. There was a positive correlation between antibody values in jejunal aspirate and gut lavage fluid, but not between saliva and jejunal aspirate; thus salivary antibodies do not reflect intestinal humoral immunity.},

In all the patients, the diagnosis was supported by the presence of hyper-regenerative atrophy of the small intestinal mucosa (total in 70% and subtotal in 30%). Metabolic disorders and cellular immunity were investigated. At the onset of the observations 70.7% of the patients demonstrated malabsorption, stage III gravity, and 29.3% stage II. It has been proved that permanent and strict adherence to the agluten diet and administration of corticosteroids in the most severe cases in combination with pathogenetic therapy of diarrhea and metabolic disorders permit attaining a steady clinical remission, improvement of normalization of the biochemical and immunological characteristics, a tendency toward normalization of the small intestinal mucosa, and even the recovery of its normal structure in part of the cases.},

The serum levels of IL-2, sIL-2R, and AGA were significantly increased in celiac patients. The increase of IL-2 and sIL-2R levels suggests indirectly T-cell activation in these patients. Receiver operating characteristic (ROC) curves were performed to compare the diagnostic performances of the three parameters. Such an analysis revealed that only AGA was useful to discriminate between patients with a gluten-free diet (second biopsy negative) and patients receiving a gluten-containing diet (third biopsy positive).},

Greater migration inhibition factor activity was seen in coeliacs on a gluten-free-diet having low serum antibody titres, and using purified T-cells instead of total peripheral blood mononucleocytes. Gliadin was the most active fraction in both assays. Raised antibodies to low-molecular weight and high-molecular weight glutenin polypeptides was observed, though these proteins had little migration inhibition factor activity. No cellular or humoral response was seen to albumins or globulins. Proteins associated with the granules of well-washed wheat starch are distinct from gluten proteins and had little T-cell activity, correlating with clinical observations that properly prepared wheat starch is devoid of coeliac toxicity. The greater specificity of the humoral response for individual wheat protein fractions in this study, compared with the earlier reports, likely results from cross-contamination in the earlier work of each fraction with gliadin.},

Three of the reported cases occurred in children. Apart from a marked predominance of males, the combination has no specific features. Firm evidence of a causal relationship between the two diseases is lacking but treatment with a gluten-free diet alone apparently had beneficial effects on the lung disease in two patients. Three pathogenic hypotheses are discussed herein: deposition of circulating immune complexes involving food allergens on the basement membrane of alveolar capillaries; reaction between antireticulin antibodies and an alveolar basement membrane antigen; or effect of adenovirus 12, a potential causative factor for celiac disease. Patients with idiopathic pulmonary hemosiderosis should routinely have tests for gluten intolerance, for instance a lactulose-mannitol intestinal permeability test. Lastly, other concomitant food allergies are reported.},

Absorption of triacylglycerol and wax ester (96 +/- 4.2 and 94 +/- 2.1%, respectively) in normal chicks was indistinguishable. Absorption of neutral lipids decreased with increasing quantities of resin, and with the highest dosage (14% wt/wt) less than 30% of dietary lipids were assimilated. The concentration of bile salts (greater than 500 mM) in the gallbladder of Leach's storm petrel is among the highest recorded. The bile salts are predominantly taurine conjugates of chenodeoxycholate and cholate. Biliary cholesterol levels are within the range observed in humans although biliary phospholipid levels are lower and triglyceride levels are higher. Extensive retrograde movement of duodenal contents and biliary secretions to the gizzard and proventriculus were found. Although similarities in fat and bile salt assimilation exist between seabirds and mammals, there do exist differences that make non-polar lipid assimilation (i.e., wax esters) more efficient in seabirds.},

The geometric mean titre of IgG AGA in patients at initial diagnosis was more than 100-fold that of controls (p less than 0.0001). Even patients on gluten-free diet had significantly higher IgG AGA titres than the controls (p = 0.0001), the difference being more than 5-fold. All the 42 patients with active disease (30 at initial diagnosis and 12 after gluten challenge) had their IgG AGA titre above 1,000, as compared with 2 (5.7%) of the 35 controls (p less than 0.0001). Both IgG and IgA AGA were quite sensitive and specific in identifying children with coeliac disease; the sensitivities for IgG and IgA AGA were 100% and 95.2%, the specificities 94.3% and 97.2%, respectively. We conclude that determination of IgG and IgA AGA with RIA is suitable for monitoring dietary compliance in children with coeliac disease, and the method is sensitive and specific for screening for coeliac disease in children.},

The diagnosis of coeliac disease was considered verified if the patient showed an unequivocal improvement of his clinical conditions and laboratory findings within three months on a gluten-free diet. In total, 42 patients were registered, among them were 29 with mucosal alterations typical for coeliac disease and 13 whose biopsies showed partial villus atrophy. The diagnosis of coeliac disease could be verified in 28 patients, among them one woman with intestinal lymphoma after longstanding untreated coeliac disease. A second patient with complete villus atrophy had intestinal lymphoma but without preceeding coeliac disease. Our findings show that the incidence of coeliac disease in Berlin is 1 out of 2113 newborn children. This figure is similar to the data reported from France, yet being clearly lower than those from Western Ireland, Switzerland and Sweden. Women are affected twice as often as men. 20 out of 28 patients were children under five years of age. The most common symptoms were meteorism/flatulence, recurrent diarrhea, loss of body weight, or inappropriate growth. 70% of the patients suffered from anaemia, the D-Xylose-test was pathological in 92% of the patients.},

In this study the presence of these antibodies was evaluated in a population of adult coeliac patients. 92.86% sensitivity and 100% specificity were obtained together with 98.68% diagnostic accuracy. The antibody titer tends to diminish progressively and become negative in patients who adhere strictly to their diet. Anti-endomysial antibodies may therefore be used at both the screening stage as well as during follow-up and they allow an objective assessment of diet compliance to be made.},

In the lamina propria of the jejunum the median density of gamma/delta+ cells was significantly (p less than 0.001) greater in untreated patients with dermatitis herpetiformis than in control subjects (114 v 36 cells/mm2) and similar to that found in the patients with coeliac disease (115 cells/mm2). The difference in gamma/delta+ cell density between patients with dermatitis herpetiformis and control subjects was much greater in the surface epithelium of the jejunum: the median density for 14 untreated patients with dermatitis herpetiformis was 39 cells/mm, for seven patients with dermatitis herpetiformis on a gluten free diet 34 cells/mm, and for control subjects 2 cells/mm; the coeliac patients had the same density as the patients with dermatitis herpetiformis (45 cells/mm). The higher density of cells bearing the alpha/delta T cell receptor in the epithelium (median 77 cells/mm) of untreated patients with dermatitis herpetiformis was associated with a gluten containing diet; in specimens taken from patients with dermatitis herpetiformis on a gluten free diet the median density was similar to that in the control subjects (44 v 39 cells/mm). The increase in the number of lymphocytes bearing the T cell receptor gamma/delta, particularly in the epithelium of the jejunum, seems to be a constant marker for these closely related diseases, whereas the density of alpha/delta+ T cells is dependent on the diet.},

   abstract = {Previous studies have suggested that greater arterial concentrations of undegraded low density lipoprotein (LDL) and/or greater arterial rates of LDL degradation may play role(s) in determining regional differences in arterial susceptibility to atherosclerosis in rabbits (Schwenke and Carew, Arteriosclerosis 1989;9:895-918). The White Carneau (WC) pigeon is also useful for investigating potential mechanism(s) that might account for regional variation in arterial susceptibility to atherosclerosis because atherosclerosis develops predictably in the aorta at the level of the celiac bifurcation (atherosclerosis-susceptible celiac site). In this study we sought to determine whether the 125I-tyramine cellobiose (125I-TC) content 1 day after injecting 125I-TC-LDL ("125I-TC-LDL accumulation") would be greater in the celiac site in arteries of WC pigeons and whether 125I-TC-LDL accumulation would be exaggerated by cholesterol feeding. Because 125I-TC remains trapped in cells after cellular degradation, arterial sites that either degrade LDL at higher rates or contain higher concentrations of undegraded LDL or both will demonstrate greater 125I-TC-LDL accumulation. Young WC pigeons were studied while consuming a cholesterol-free diet and after consuming a cholesterol-containing diet for 1, 2, 4, and 8 weeks. In pigeons fed a cholesterol-free diet, 125I-TC-LDL accumulation in the celiac site was equivalent to 0.24 +/- 0.02 micrograms LDL cholesterol/cm2 aortic surface/day compared with only 0.14 +/- 0.02 micrograms LDL cholesterol/cm2/day for the adjacent aorta, which is resistant to atherosclerosis (atherosclerosis-resistant site) (p less than 0.025). In atherosclerotic lesions excised from the celiac site, 125I-TC-LDL accumulation was equivalent to 21 +/- 10 micrograms LDL cholesterol/cm2 aortic surface/day compared with 0.66 +/- 0.17 micrograms LDL cholesterol/cm2/day for the adjacent atherosclerosis-resistant site (p less than 0.001). During cholesterol feeding, 125I-TC-LDL cholesterol accumulation in the celiac site as a whole increased 30-fold compared with a fivefold increase in plasma LDL cholesterol. In comparison, 125I-TC-LDL cholesterol accumulation in the adjacent atherosclerosis-resistant arterial site increased at the same rate as the plasma LDL cholesterol, while 125I-TC-LDL cholesterol accumulation in two other relatively atherosclerosis-resistant arterial sites that we studied increased relatively little during cholesterol feeding. The results of this study suggest that differences in arterial 125I-TC-LDL accumulation, both those present in normal animals and those induced by cholesterol feeding, may contribute to the characteristic regional variation in arterial susceptibility to atherosclerosis in WC pigeons.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 400 WORDS)},

Most recent studies on gluten toxicity have used in vitro analyses of cellular immune activation by gluten fractions and peptides. Our work indicates that gliadin is the most active of the different protein families found within the wheat grain and that a specific peptide sequence located in the amino terminus domain of alpha-gliadin and containing the sequence proline-serine-glutamine-glutamine was most active. Improvement in the dietary management of coeliac disease is possible by use of test kits for the detection of gluten in foods. Both laboratory kits and home test kits (suitable for use by individual coeliacs) are available and reliably detect gluten from wheat, rye and barley even after cooking or baking.},

   abstract = {To improve compliance with a gluten-free diet in coeliac disease a simple prototype test kit was developed to detect gluten in foods for use at home. The test is based on monoclonal antibodies to heat-stable gluten proteins which crossreact appropriately with barley and rye proteins. It is suitable for use with a wide range of raw or cooked foods. The food is extracted with dilute hydrochloric acid and 1 drop of the extract transferred to an antibody-coated tube; enzyme-labelled gluten detection antibody is added and after 3 min the tube is washed and colour developer is added. The reaction is stopped after 2 min, stabilising the blue colour. The home kit was compared with a quantitative laboratory kit, and the qualitative agreement was very good. The kit could distinguish foods with trace gluten contents (acceptable for a "gluten-free" diet) from those with a slightly higher but unacceptable gluten content. In a trial of the prototype kit by 47 coeliac disease patients of diverse ages and educational backgrounds, 93% of tests correctly identified foods as acceptable or unacceptable.},

Furthermore, three female patients diagnosed with small bowel non-Hodgkin's lymphoma (NHL) complicating CD were studied. Silver (Ag)-staining technique was used to visualize positive NORs. In each individual, 20 metaphases were analyzed to determine the number of NORs per cell. The average of Ag-NOR+ per cell, expressed as mean +/- SD, was found to be higher in the CD group (6.62 +/- 0.65) compared with controls (5.70 +/- 0.81) (p less than 0.001). This increase was evident in both groups of chromosomes analyzed (D and G). No differences were found among the three groups, but all of them were found to be statistically different compared to controls (p less than 0.001). The NHL complicating CD patients showed a statistically increased frequency of Ag-NORs (7.20 +/- 0.39) with respect to CD patients (p less than 0.02) and controls (p less than 0.001). These findings show an increase of the transcriptional activity of rDNA in CD that could be related to the high incidence of malignancy in this pathology. Longitudinal studies of CD patients should be performed to confirm this evidence.},

   abstract = {The effects of specific circulating IgG antibody on the uptake of dietary antigen and in the generation of intestinal enteropathy have been investigated in Balb/c mice bred on a gluten-free diet. A monoclonal IgG1 antibody (GD3) was prepared against gliadin. After adoptive transfer into mice, this antibody was capable of mediating a type III hypersensitivity response in vivo to footpad challenge with gliadin. The titres of circulating GD3, as estimated in vitro by ELISA, correlated well with the degree of inflammation at sites of type III responses in vivo. Following footpad challenge with gliadin, titres of circulating GD3 antibody were reduced. GD3 antibody was tested for its ability to mediate inflammatory responses in vivo in the intestinal mucosa of mice fed with gliadin. Circulating GD3 antibody was removed selectively and specifically by dietary gliadin, compared to feeding with bovine serum albumin or maintenance on a gliadin-free diet only. However, we were unable to demonstrate any pathological changes in the intestine as a result of possible local antigen-antibody complex formation or deposition. Using radio-iodinated gliadin as a trace marker, no significant retention of gliadin in the intestinal mucosa was found in mice pre-injected with GD3 antibody. These data suggest that circulating IgG antibody has little effect on dietary antigen uptake in the gut, and alone is insufficient to mediate an enteropathy.},

Here we report the results of the determinations of gliadin IgA antibodies in 70 patients suspected of having coeliac disease (CD), who underwent a small bowel biopsy for the first time. In 15 untreated patients with proven CD gliadin IgA antibodies ranged from 105 to 765 AU (median = 232 AU), in contrast to the findings in 55 patients with other gastrointestinal diseases (range from 0 to 175 AU, median = 9 AU; p less than 0.0001). The calculated sensitivity was 100% and the specificity reached 62% using 25 AU as a cut off. The recommendation of a higher cut off (50 AU) to achieve a higher specificity (82%) with equal sensitivity is discussed using the ROC curves and the Youden Index. Gliadin IgG antibodies were simultaneously determined in 29 out of the 70 patients. Taking 25 AU as a cut off the sensitivity was also 100% but the specificity was lower (29%) in comparison with gliadin IgA antibody testing. The determination of gliadin IgA antibodies by a standardized EIA is a highly sensitive diagnostic tool for screening candidates for small bowel biopsy suspected of having CD. The number of jejunal biopsies can be greatly reduced by using this test. It can also be used for monitoring patients under gluten-free diet or gluten challenge.},

The most common diagnosis was the postenteritis syndrome where the presence of an enteropathy indicated those requiring treatment with a cows' milk free diet. Other conditions where a biopsy facilitated diagnosis or treatment included giardiasis, enteropathogenic Escheriichia coli, crytosporidiosis, autoimmune enteropathy, and microvillous atrophy. Coeliac disease was considered in 55% of children and established in 8%, clearly identifying those requiring a gluten free diet. This also emphasises the important role of the biopsy procedure in the exclusion of specific diseases.

   abstract = {The aim of our experiments was to produce a local T cell mediated immune response to gliadin in the mouse small intestine as a possible animal model of gluten sensitive enteropathy, coeliac disease. BALB/c and BDF1 mice were immunised systemically with gliadin in complete Freund's adjuvant. The jejunal mucosa was challenged by feeding a gluten containing diet, and villus and crypt lengths, crypt cell production rate, and intraepithelial lymphocyte counts were determined to assess mucosal cell mediated immunity. In some animals permeability and local immunity were modulated by concurrent intestinal anaphylaxis or a graft versus host reaction. There were no changes in the jejunal mucosa of BALB/c mice fed a gluten containing diet after having been parenterally immunized. When, however, mice were parenterally immunised with gliadin, fed a gluten containing diet, rendered hypersensitive to helminth antigen by infection with the nematode parasite Nippostrongylus brasiliensis, and challenged intravenously to produce intestinal anaphylaxis crypt cell production rate was significantly higher than in ovalbumin immunized controls at 12 days after parasite challenge. Finally, graft versus host reaction was induced in BDF1 mice that had been parenterally immunised with gliadin and were on a gluten containing diet. Two weeks later these mice had significantly longer crypts and a higher crypt cell production rate and intraepithelial lymphocyte count than control, unimmunized mice with graft versus host reaction. We conclude that active immunization with gliadin does not in itself produce intestinal cell mediated immunity to gliadin contained in the diet, or enteropathy. Additional factors, such as those occurring during intestinal anaphylaxis (increase intestinal permeability), or during graft versus host reaction (enhanced antigen presentation), seem to be necessary for the full expression of a jejunal mucosal reaction.},

Eighty-three children (67 on gluten-containing diet and 16 on gluten-free diet) were investigated. The D-xylose and the serum antigliadin antibody test predicted accurately 70% and 78% of the small-bowel biopsy results, respectively, whereas the cellobiose-mannitol permeability test predicted 93%. These data confirm the superiority of the permeability test over the D-xylose test, although the former cannot be advocated as a substitute for jejunal biopsy. Our results suggest a complementary use of the permeability test and the antigliadin antibody measurement as screening tests for coeliac disease before applying more invasive procedures.},

Esophageal cancer is a relatively uncommon neoplasm in Western countries with a very poor prognosis. In industrialized countries alcohol and tobacco are the major risk factors. Nutritional factors play also an important role in the aetiology of esophageal cancer, particularly a diet rich in cereal but poor in fresh fruit and vegetables, accounts for some of the geographic differences. Several predisposing disorders for esophageal cancer are known and include Barrett's esophagus, achalasia, chronic strictures due to corrosive substances, tylosis, coeliac disease, and the Plummer-Vinson syndrome. The clinical manifestations are also discussed.},

There was no difference in Cu, Fe, Ca, Cl values between the examined groups. The Zn contents of the hair are significantly low in the group with acute celiac disease after a short-term diet and also in the group with cystic fibrosis, the data approach the normal range only after a year's diet. The significant rise of hair potassium contents is well indicated in patients with acute celiac disease and this rise may be due to the destruction of cell cuticles.

IgA EmA were positive in 19 (86%) of the 22 DH patients with subtotal villous atrophy, in comparison with the positivity of only one (11%) of the nine DH patients with less severe intestinal involvement (partial villous atrophy or mild abnormalities). The specificity of this test for gluten-sensitive enteropathy was 100%, these antibodies being consistently negative in biopsied disease controls showing a normal jejunal mucosa. Moreover, IgA EmA proved to be useful in monitoring the response to gluten withdrawal in DH patients, as these antibodies always disappeared in all the DH cases studied after 1 year of gluten-free diet together with the regrowth of jejunal villi. The strict relationship between IgA EmA and subtotal villous atrophy is more helpful still since the enteropathy present in DH is usually symptomless and therefore difficult to suspect.},

All the disease control patients as well as the blood donors tested were always negative for the three IgA antibodies. Our results state that the search for both IgA EmA and AGA gives the best results in the screening of celiac disease, since the positivity for at least one of these two antibodies allows identification with a 100% specificity of the 90% of untreated celiac patients.},

They prospectively underwent jejunal biopsy to determine whether or not they had coeliac disease. Their age range was 21-79 years (mean 42 years). Enteropathy was present in 13 (72 per cent) and was always associated with circulating IgA antigliadin antibody. Enteropathy was not present in the five cases who had only IgG antibody. Clinical improvement occurred in eight of 11 patients who complied with a gluten-free diet and was paralleled by an improvement in the mucosal histology in seven of eight who were re-biopsied. The most remarkable cases were two patients who presented with severe debility and no apparent haematological or biochemical abnormalities, and who subsequently made a dramatic recovery on a gluten-free diet. It is concluded that antireticulin antibody detected by routine autoantibody screening and confirmed to have IgA antigliadin antibody specificity is a useful indicator of an otherwise undiagnosed enteropathy. This serves to emphasize that the condition can sometimes be associated with atypical features and significant morbidity.},

All children were suspected of celiac disease. They had been on dietary treatment for at least 10 months before they were challenged with gluten. Based on jejunal biopsy findings, 10 of the 17 children had to be considered positive. The sensitivity of the measurement of AGA at 6 weeks after gluten challenge was found to be 90% for IgG, 100% for IgA, and 100% for IgG/IgA combined. The specificity for IgG, IgA, and the IgG/IgA combination was 100, 71, and 100%, respectively. Twelve weeks after gluten challenge, the sensitivity as well as the specificity of AGA determination for IgG, IgA, and IgG/IgA were 100%. It is concluded that testing both IgG AGA and IgA AGA in children suspected of celiac disease is valuable in monitoring the course of the diagnostic provocation protocol and that jejunal biopsies can be abolished.

This incidence rate by birth is the lowest described in an epidemiological study in contrast with rates of 0.33 to 8 per 1000 live births found in other western countries. This difference may be explained by the different diagnostic criteria used for coeliac disease.

METHODS: We looked for IgA anti-endomysial antibodies (IgA-EmA) in 103 sera of 90 children (age: 2 months-13.9 years) using an indirect immunofluorescence method on monkey oesophagus sections. In 44 patients, the diagnosis of coeliac disease was confirmed fulfilling new criteria of the European Society of Pediatric Gastroenterology and Nutrition. RESULTS: All 24 coeliac disease patients with an initial flat mucosa had IgA-EmA (sensitivity 100%). In 36% of coeliac disease patients adhering to a gluten-free diet we found IgA-EmA. None of 46 patients in whom coeliac disease had been excluded by jejunal biopsy had IgA-EmA (specificity 100%). The sera of 102 blood-donors were used as controls and showed a test specificity of 99%. In coeliac disease patients, the titer of IgA-EmA declined during gluten-free diet by 0.66 steps/month on average, and rose 1.76 steps/month during gluten challenge. CONCLUSIONS: These results confirm the diagnostic significance of IgA-EmA for patients with suspected coeliac disease and their value for monitoring treatment even in young children (below 2 years).},

Mean acid-resistant lipase activity was 330 nmol/ml/min free fatty acid released on placebo, compared with 896 nmol/ml/min on fungal lipase (p = 0.006 for area under the curve). We compared this lipase's clinical efficacy with that of two conventional pancreatin microsphere formulations in an open randomised crossover fat-balance study in 10 similar patients. Each preparation was given for 2 weeks, and a fat-balance study, using a faecal recovery marker, was performed on the final 3 days; a period without treatment was also included. The fungal lipase had no effect on faecal wet weight or on the coefficient of fat absorption (59.0% vs. 52.3%; NS) in comparison with placebo. The established enteric-coated microsphere preparation (Creon) produced a significant reduction in faecal wet weight and improvement in coefficient of fat absorption (81.4% vs. 52.3%; p less than 0.01) in comparison with placebo. The newer microsphere preparation (Pancrex M) was also effective, but perhaps less so than Creon; there were no significant differences between the two preparations.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS)},
