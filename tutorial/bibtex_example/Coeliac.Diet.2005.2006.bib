Video capsule endoscopy (VCE) findings of the small bowell were compared with DQ-typing. METHODS: Twenty-two patients with chronic abdominal pain (with or without diarrhea) and at least one positive result of any of the coeliac serological markers (AGA, TTG, EMA) and normal duodenal biopsy were enrolled and underwent VCE. Twelve healthy volunteers with VCE served as control group. Coeliac related HLA DQ2 or DQ8 markers were determined. RESULTS: 12/ 22 (55%) patients had small bowel abnormalities with VCE. No mucosal abnormalities were recognized in the control group (p = 0.002). Inflammatory changes were classified as moderate or pronounced. Eight patients (36%) had moderate changes and four patients (18%) demonstrated pronounced changes. Only 6 of the 21 IBS patients were positive for DQ2 and/or DQ8. CONCLUSIONS: The patients in this study fulfilled the diagnostic Rome criteria for Irritable Bowel Syndrome. We suggest that patients with positive coeliac serology and normal duodenal biopsies should undergo HLA typing. In patients positive for DQ2 and/or DQ8, a VCE should be performed. Patients with mucosal abnormalities compatible with CD should be considered as a group distinct from IBS patients and could be tested with gluten challenge or treated with a gluten free diet.},

   abstract = {Tissue transglutaminase (tTG) autoantibodies decline after gluten-free diet in patients with coeliac disease. We tested the hypothesis that gluten-free diet-induced change in tTG autoantibody levels affects subsets of peripheral blood lymphocytes. Peripheral blood was obtained from 20 children with biopsy-proven active coeliac disease. Gluten-free diet was initiated and the children examined again after three and six months. tTG autoantibodies were measured in radioligand binding assays and lymphocyte subsets by flow cytometry. IgA-tTG levels at diagnosis, 2204 U/ml (median, range 113-24990), were reduced over six months to 76 U/ml (median, range 1-1261) (P < 0.001). At six months, 12/20 (60%) children had reduced their IgA-tTG levels to < 100 U/ml and these children showed a decrease in B cells (mean change -3.8%, P = 0.014), CD4+ T cells (mean -4.32%, P = 0.011) and CD4+ T cells expressing CD25high (mean change -0.62%, P = 0.036). In contrast, the CD4+CD25(high)CCR4+ T cell population increased during the same period (mean change 11.5%, P = 0.0036). The decline in IgA-tTG levels correlated to the decrease in B cells (r = 0.56, P = 0.01), CD4+ T cells (r = 0.66, P = 0.004) as well as CD4+CD25high T cells (r = 0.59, P = 0.01). A negative correlation was found between the decline in IgA-tTG and CD4+CD25high T cells expressing CD45RO (r = -0.49, P = 0.03) and CCR4 (r = -0.54, P = 0.01). This is the first observational study on the effect of gluten-free diet on concurrent changes of tTG autoantibodies and specific peripheral blood lymphocyte subsets. Our data suggest that flow cytometry may be a useful complement to tTG autoantibodies when studying the effects of gluten-free diet in children with coeliac disease.},

Recent observational studies suggest that breast feeding may prevent the development of CD. AIM: To evaluate articles that compared effects of breast feeding on risk of CD. METHODS: Systematic review and meta-analysis of observational studies published between 1966 and June 2004 that examined the association between breast feeding and the development of CD. RESULTS: Six case-control studies met the inclusion criteria. With the exception of one small study, all the included studies found an association between increasing duration of breast feeding and decreased risk of developing CD. Meta-analysis showed that the risk of CD was significantly reduced in infants who were breast feeding at the time of gluten introduction (pooled odds ratio 0.48, 95% CI 0.40 to 0.59) compared with infants who were not breast feeding during this period. CONCLUSIONS: Breast feeding may offer protection against the development of CD. Breast feeding during the introduction of dietary gluten, and increasing duration of breast feeding were associated with reduced risk of developing CD. It is, however, not clear from the primary studies whether breast feeding delays the onset of symptoms or provides a permanent protection against the disease. Long term prospective cohort studies are required to investigate further the relation between breast feeding and CD.},

   abstract = {Celiac disease is a common autoimmune disorder that has genetic, environmental, and immunologic components. It is characterized by an immune response to ingested wheat gluten and related proteins of rye and barley that leads to inflammation, villous atrophy, and crypt hyperplasia in the intestine. The disease is closely associated with genes that code for human leukocyte antigens DQ2 and DQ8. Transglutaminase 2 appears to be an important component of the disease, both as a deamidating enzyme that can enhance the immunostimulatory effect of gluten and as a target autoantigen in the immune response. Sensitive and specific serologic tests, including those for anti-transglutaminase antibody, are facilitating fast and noninvasive screening for celiac disease. Thus, they are contributing to a more accurate estimate of the prevalence of the disease and its association with other disorders. Celiac disease is associated with increased rates of anemia, osteoporosis, cancer, neurologic deficits, and additional autoimmune disorders. A gluten-free diet is the mainstay of safe and effective treatment of celiac disease, although its effect on some of the extraintestinal manifestations of the disease remains to be determined.},

   abstract = {BACKGROUND: Coeliac disease (CD) probably affects one in 100 Australians, but is greatly underdiagnosed. Heightened media interest in the negative effects of dietary gluten has led many patients to request testing for CD or follow inappropriate diets. Doctors have had little education in CD because of its perceived rarity. OBJECTIVE: This article summarises current knowledge of clinical presentations, optimal screening and diagnostic tests, and how the general practitioner can best assist patients in adopting a successful gluten free diet. DISCUSSION: Coeliac disease is associated with a range of conditions including type 1 diabetes, thyroid disease, osteoporosis, and iron deficiency with or without anaemia. Gastrointestinal symptoms may not be present. The GP therefore has an important role in considering CD in the differential diagnosis in a variety of clinical presentations. Antitransglutaminase IgA and total serum IgA are the preferred screening tests but may miss occasional patients with CD. Endoscopic duodenal biopsy while eating gluten is needed for definitive diagnosis. A gluten free diet is complex, and may fail without the involvement of a skilled dietician.},

   abstract = {INTRODUCTION: Gluten ataxia refers to the association of idiopathic ataxia despite exhaustive investigations with gluten sensitivity defined by anti-gliadin antibodies (AGA) presence in blood. This is a controversial concept. PATIENTS AND METHODS: We screened 33 patients, who were hospitalized in 2003 and had subacute or chronic ataxia for presence of circulating AGA. Twelve patients were positive and their clinical and biological features were studied. RESULTS: Among the twelve patients, we concluded that gluten ataxia was present in only eight, including one case of celiac disease. Among these eight patients, five had the usual features of gluten ataxia (progressive cerebellar ataxia affecting mainly lower limbs), but one patient presented unusual left cerebellar hemisyndrome and the two others displayed polyneuropathy with proprioceptive ataxia. Cerebellar atrophy was confirmed with magnetic resonance imaging in five cases and association with other antibodies was found in six cases. Among the four other patients positive for AGA, investigations revealed one case of multiple sclerosis, one case of late-onset Friedreich ataxia, one case of basilar tuberculous meningitis and one case of type 2 diabetes. CONCLUSION: Screening for AGA presence should be systematically performed at presentation of patients with unknown etiology ataxia; in the event AGA are present without any other etiology, treatment with gluten-free diet must be discussed. However, the responsibility of AGA in the pathogenesis of neurological signs is highly debatable and further experimental work is required. Two pathophysiological hypotheses are suggested: (1) overexpression of cerebellar epitopes, in case of primary cerebellar pathology, leading to excessive immune response directed against these epitopes; and (2) molecular mimicry with cross-reactivity of antigens usually directed against gliadin, but also recognizing Purkinje cells epitopes.},

The incidence obtained through diagnosed cases in the paediatric gastroenterology units in Portugal was 1:3648. To determine the best current celiac disease screening method and its prevalence in a portuguese population, 536 sera of teenagers with 14 years +/- 6 months from Braga town schools were tested as follows: a) total IgA, b) anti-tissue transglutaminase antibodies c) anti-endomysium antibodies (AEA). One female adolescent, with negative AEA and anti-transglutaminase antibodies had a diagnosed celiac disease; this patient was under appropriate diet. Eleven adolescents had positive anti-transglutaminase antibodies and 4 of these had also positive AEA. A jejunal biopsy was carried out on the latter adolescents. Three presented intestinal villous atrophy, 2 a flat mucosa and 1 a moderate atrophy. One female adolescent had a normal mucosa. The prevalence was 1:134, [confidence interval at 95%, 1:53-1:500]. CONCLUSIONS: Presently, total IgA with determination of anti-tissue transglutaminase antibodies is apparently the best screening method; it is less expensive test and, given the use of ELISA, less dependent on the observer. The celiac disease prevalence found in the present study falls within the range of prevalence recently found in other European populations, which implies that the celiac disease is under-diagnosed in Portugal.},

   abstract = {Anti endomysial and anti transglutaminase (EMA/TTG) antibodies measurements in large population groups, show that celiac disease is significantly more common than previously thought and 0.5-1% of the population suffer this condition. The recognition of atypical clinical presentations by active screening of high risk groups is a successful global initiative. In Chile there is little awareness of the enormous changes occurred in this field. Available national information on typical presentation of the disease shows that it is found in 1:1836 live births, figure that is comparable to European societies. Two urgent tasks are required in our country. First, to asses the Chilean population using EMA and/or TTG. Second, to improve the legal aspects that regulate consumer information about gluten content in processed foods. We here review the most relevant aspects to be considered to improve the management of celiac patients and the tasks that require the participation of health authorities for their implementation.},

   abstract = {UNLABELLED: Abnormal liver function tests and liver damage are seen frequently with celiac disease. However, the pathogenesis of liver functions abnormality is not clearly understood. The aim of this study was to determine the frequency of abnormal liver functions in children with celiac disease and its relation with anthropometric measurements and severity of intestinal damage. PATIENTS AND METHODS: Twenty seven patients with celiac disease were included in the study. Anthropometric and laboratory examinations and intestinal biopsies were performed in all the patients. Mucosal lesions were classified according to the Marsh classification. Villous area, crypt height and mitotic count were measured morphometrically for all biopsy samples. RESULTS: The mean age of patients was 6 +/- 5 years on admission. Alanine aminotransferase levels were normal (group 1) or elevated (group 2) in 20 and 7 patients, respectively. The mean alanine aminotransferase levels were 22.0 +/- 7.2 in group 1 and 70.5 +/- 31.1 U/L in group 2 patients, (p < 0.001). Complaints, mean age, height for age, weight for height, serum albumin level, villous area, crypt height and mitotic count were not significantly different between the two groups. Similarly, the ratio of Marsh classification was not significantly different between the two groups. All patients were given a gluten-free diet. Serum aminotransferase values returned to normal after 7.4 +/- 2.7 months of a gluten-free diet. CONCLUSION: Abnormalities of liver functions are frequently seen in paediatric celiac disease patients. These abnormalities are not correlated with malnutrition and severity of intestinal mucosal lesions. Liver enzyme activities return to normal levels in a few months after gluten-free diet.},

   abstract = {BACKGROUND: Cow's milk protein sensitive enteropathy (CMSE) and celiac disease (CD) associate with upregulation of local intestinal immune responses, including activation of cytotoxic lymphocytes. OBJECTIVE: We investigated whether this upregulation can be detected at the systemic level by analyzing serum concentrations of granzymes A (GrA) and B (GrB), soluble Fas, and CD30. METHODS: Fifty-seven children with a final diagnosis of CMSE in 23 subjects (18 untreated and 5 on a diet), 20 untreated CD patients, and 14 control subjects with no gastrointestinal disease were examined by endoscopy for gastrointestinal complaints. Duodenal biopsies were studied for basic histology, CD3, alphabeta and gammadelta T-cell receptors (TCRs), and serum samples by commercial ELISA assays. RESULTS: Concentrations of GrA and GrB were significantly higher in untreated CMSE and in CD as compared with the control subjects. Measurable GrB was present in only 20% of the control subjects but in 100% of patients with CMSE. CD30 was similarly increased in both untreated CMSE and CD cases, whereas in treated CMSE cases the concentrations were equal to the control subjects. All groups showed similar soluble Fas. The numbers of duodenal CD3 + , alphabeta- and gammadelta-TCRs correlated with the serum granzyme and CD30 levels. CONCLUSION: The intestinal immune response in CMSE and CD is manifested by the increase in serum GrA, GrB, and CD30; the measurement of these markers provides a new practical and objective complementary means for diagnosis and assessment of treatment response. However, this has to be confirmed by more studies before routine use.},

Intestinal lymphomas are usually discovered during the 4th to 5th decade and constitute an exceptional complication of coeliac disease. This lymphoma is generally a high grade pleomorphic cell lymphoma with large cells. Our case concerned a 30 year old woman with a history of coeliac disease who developed a gastro-enteromesenteric lymphoma. Anatomopathological and immunohistochemical analysis showed an enteropathy associated T-cell lymphoma. We suggest that patients with coeliac disease unresponsive to a gluten free diet or with deteriorating clinical condition be investigated for complications such as enteropathy associated T-cell lymphoma. It is also important to avoid this complication by detecting asymptomatic form of coeliac disease that needs a gluten-free diet.},

Most patients have an associated gluten-sensitive enteropathy GSE that is usually asymptomatic. Both enteropathy and the dermatologic findings disappear with a gluten-free diet, therefore, DH is thought to be the specific dermatologic finding of celiac disease CD. An association between CD and autoimmune disease has been documented in several studies. Similar associations have been reported in DH.

   abstract = {Celiac disease CD is an inflammatory disease of the small intestine brought about by exposure to gluten in genetically predisposed individuals. Celiac disease most often presents with non specific, or extra-intestinal, manifestations and, consequently, the disease remains under diagnosed. Untreated CD is associated with high morbidity and, therefore, early diagnosis is essential. The availability of non-invasive and relatively cheap serological tests has made it possible to screen large numbers of patients and resulted in increased, and earlier, diagnosis of patients with CD. However, these tests have varying degrees of sensitivities and specificities and the results generated can lead to a lot of confusion with regards to the diagnosis, or exclusion, of CD. In the present review, we discuss in detail these tests and suggest how they can be used in screening patients for CD with the hope that such information will help clinicians to select the right tests and interpret the generated results more effectively, and thus lead to improved identification and treatment of patients with CD.},

AIM: To evaluate demographic, clinical and biochemical characteristics of adult coeliac disease patients presenting with iron-deficiency anaemia. PATIENTS: A total of 108 iron-deficiency anaemia patients in whom coeliac disease has been diagnosed were studied. As a control group 108 non-coeliac iron-deficiency anaemia patients, comparable for sex and age, were studied. RESULTS: Of the 108 coeliac disease patients, 95 (88%) were female (mean age 34 years, range 19-72) and 13 (12%) were male (mean age 33 years, range 15-65). The median duration of iron-deficiency anaemia before diagnosis was 66 months in coeliac disease patients and 14 months in the iron-deficiency anaemia control group (P = 0.0001). The occurrence of at least one gastrointestinal symptom, not spontaneously reported, was observed in 92 (85%) patients with coeliac disease and in 67 (62%) patients in the control group (P = 0.001). The concomitant presence of diarrhoea, abdominal pain and abdominal bloating was detected in 14% patients with coeliac disease with respect to 3% in the control group (P = 0.005). CONCLUSIONS: The vast majority of coeliac disease patients with iron-deficiency anaemia presentation were unaware of the gastrointestinal symptoms and this relationship is useful for diet compliance.},

Being a small bowel disorder the upper GI endoscopy and colonoscopy are not of much help. The advent of Capsule Endoscopy (CE) which scans the entire small bowel and gives highly magnified and detailed view of mucosa has facilitated the diagnosis of CD to great extent.

Women seem to be more frequently affected although data on sex differences are poor. In this study the prevalence of different clinical pictures according to sex and age is analysed in a large series of patients. MATERIAL AND METHODS: A total of 1436 patients with gluten intolerance were retrospectively considered, diagnosed from January 1975 to August 2001 based on compatible small-bowel biopsy and response to a gluten-free diet, plus immunofluorescent detection of granular IgA in papillary derma for dermatitis herpetiformis. The clinical picture at onset (classic, non-classic, silent) and age at diagnosis (< or = 2 years, > 2 and < or = 14 years, > 14 years) was recorded; 362 parents of coeliac probands undergoing a familial screening were also studied. The relations among sex, age class and symptoms were analysed using the chi2 test with Yates's correction. RESULTS: The overall female/male ratio was 2.3:1 but the inter-sex difference was significant only when the diagnosis was made in adulthood where a significant association between iron-deficiency anaemia as manifestation at onset in adult women (34% versus 7%) was found. Low weight, dyspepsia and hypertransaminasaemia were more common in adult men than women (20%, 14% and 7% versus 13%, 3% and 2%, respectively). Dermatitis herpetiformis was present more frequently in men (16% versus 9%). The prevalence of silent cases was 6% in men and 3% in women. Familial screening showed the same prevalence (9.3%) of current coeliac disease in fathers and mothers. CONCLUSIONS: Diagnosis of coeliac disease is more frequent in women but physicians' awareness of sex- and age-related differences in clinical presentation could improve diagnostic performances in men.},

   abstract = {OBJECTIVES: The use of screening tests for celiac disease has increased the number of patients referred for evaluation. We proposed that the subgroup of patients with very high tissue transglutaminase antibody (TTG) titers is positive for celiac disease and a small-bowel biopsy is not necessary to make the diagnosis. A gluten-free diet should be attempted and, if the patient's symptoms do not improve, then a biopsy should be performed to confirm the diagnosis. METHODS: A chart review of data for 103 patients who underwent both TTG testing and a small-bowel biopsy was performed. We examined the impact of using TTG values of >100 U and <20 U as cutoff values and suggested performing biopsies for patients with TTG values of 20 to 100 U, as is current practice. RESULTS: Fifty-eight of 103 patients demonstrated positive biopsy results. Forty-nine of 103 patients had TTG levels of >100 U, with 48 of 49 exhibiting positive biopsy results. Only 7 of 16 patients with TTG values of 20 to 100 U exhibited positive biopsy results. Three patients with TTG levels of <20 U had positive biopsies; 2 were IgA negative and 1 had a duodenal ulcer. With the cutoff values of >100 U and <20 U with known IgA status, the sensitivity was 0.980 (48 of 49 cases) and the specificity was 0.972 (35 of 36 cases). An incremental cost analysis found that this proposal could potentially decrease the costs of investigation and diagnosis by almost 30%. CONCLUSIONS: When the cutoff values were changed to >100 and <20 U and IgA levels were verified, the sensitivity and specificity were very high. Patients with mid-range TTG values (20-100 U) or values of <20 U with negative IgA status should continue to undergo biopsies for diagnosis of celiac disease.},

Elimination of gluten from diet is the cornerstone of the therapy. A 73-year-old woman with hyporexia, loss of weight, depression, bowel abnormalities and progressive deterioration of her abilities in the instrumental activities of daily living was referred to our department. Antigliadin and antiendomysial antibodies were present. A subsequent small-intestinal biopsy of the second and third portion of duodenum showed subtotal villous atrophy, increase of intra-epithelial lymphocytes as well as hyperplastic glands (type III Marsh score). All these pathological findings were compatible with celiac disease diagnosis so that a gluten-free diet was then initiated.},

   abstract = {OBJECTIVES: Anti-tissue transglutaminase antibody (anti-tTG) determination using second-generation (human antigen) enzyme-linked immunoassays (ELISAs) is a very accurate test to diagnose celiac disease (CD). In this study, we compared 2 second-generation ELISAs (Celikey tTG; Pharmacia Diagnostics GmbH & Co, Freiburg, Germany, and QuantaLite; Inova Diagnostics, San Diego, CA) and antiendomysial antibodies (EMAs) with a new indirect chemiluminescence immunoassay (LIAISON tTG; DiaSorin S.p.A., Saluggia, Italy) in diagnosing and monitoring CD in children. PATIENTS AND METHODS: Antiendomysial antibodies, anti-tTGs and total immunoglobulin A were measured in the sera of 103 control children, 101 children with histologically proven CD and 31 CD children on gluten-free diet (GFD). RESULTS: Anti-tissue transglutaminase antibody mean levels were significantly higher in CD with respect to control or GFD children. The sensitivity value of EMAs, LIAISON tTG, Celikey tTG and QuantaLite in diagnosing CD was 97.7%, 97.0%, 94.1% and 98.0%, respectively, and the corresponding specificity values were 91.1%, 98.1%, 97.1% and 96.1%, respectively. The degree of mucosal destruction (Marsh criteria) was correlated with EMA semiquantification (P < 0.01) and with the circulating levels of anti-tTGs measured using LIAISON (P < 0.05) or QuantaLite (P < 0.01). Twenty-six CD children were followed up from 5 to 25 months after GFD. The circulating levels of anti-tTGs measured with any of the 3 assays significantly dropped after GFD. CONCLUSIONS: Anti-tissue transglutaminase antibody determination with second-generation ELISAs is as effective as EMAs for CD diagnosis. The novel chemiluminescent method described in the present paper for the detection of anti-tTGs in the diagnosis of CD had the highest sensitivity and specificity values. The anti-tTG test correlates with the degree of mucosal destruction and is suitable for verifying patient compliance to dietary treatment.},

PATIENTS AND METHODS: The diagnosis of CD was established between 1971 and 1982 in 84 infants based on intestinal biopsy data; a gluten-free diet was prescribed and the cohort followed prospectively. RESULTS: Thirty-six infants were followed less than 5 years. A second biopsy was performed in 25. Mucosa had healed in 13 and remained atrophic in 12. Three children developed partial villous atrophy between 6 and 12 years of age in spite of the gluten-free diet. Forty-five patients underwent a gluten challenge between 5 and 10 years of age: in 41 histological lesions relapsed, in two mucosa remained normal and clinical and immunological relapse developed in two. Among those 45 patients, 18 were examined after 18 years follow-up: the exclusion diet was resumed in four, overt clinical relapse developed in four and four experienced intermittent gastrointestinal disorders. All biopsies performed during a period of normal diet showed villous atrophy (except in one patient) without correlation with clinical symptoms. CONCLUSION: The diagnosis of celiac disease in infants was confirmed in nearly all cases in childhood. When they reached adulthood, these patients had few symptoms but their histological lesions persisted. These data are in favor of a lifelong exclusion diet.},

SUBJECTS: We studied sera from 143 untreated coeliac children and adolescents (8.8+/-6.1 years), 212 sera from 97 of those patients after gluten withdrawal, and 64 control subjects with non-coeliac intestinal disorders (6.8+/-4.8 years). METHODS: Samples were tested for IgA and IgG class tissue-transglutaminase antibodies by radiobinding assay, using human-derived tissue-transglutaminase, and for IgA anti-endomysium antibodies by indirect immunofluorescence on monkey oesophagus. RESULTS: Untreated coeliac patients had significantly higher titres of IgA and IgG tissue-transglutaminase antibodies than controls (p<0.00001); the diagnostic sensitivity was 95.8% and 99.3%, respectively, and the specificity was 95.3%. Three patients with selective IgA deficiency were positive for IgG tissue-transglutaminase antibodies. The concordance rate between IgA tissue-transglutaminase antibodies and anti-endomysium antibodies was 98.1%. Patients on gluten-free diet showed a significant decrease in IgA and IgG tissue-transglutaminase antibodies with respect to untreated patients (p<0.0001). Tissue-transglutaminase was more sensible than anti-endomysium antibodies to detect small amounts of gluten intake when the compliance was poor. CONCLUSIONS: The recombinant human tissue-transglutaminase antibodies assay is a highly sensitive and specific test for diagnosis of coeliac disease, and it is useful in monitoring the compliance to gluten-free diet.},

AIM: To determine what proportion of patients with coeliac disease remain under specialist follow-up and to examine patients' perspectives on the long-term management of coeliac disease. METHODS: A questionnaire was sent to 183 patients who had a duodenal biopsy between July 1994 and July 2004 which was consistent with coeliac disease. RESULTS: A total of 126 (69%) patients returned their questionnaire. Patients had on average been diagnosed with coeliac disease 5.4 years earlier. Eighty-eight percentage were trying to follow a strict gluten-free diet. Sixty-two percentage of patients were under regular follow-up although this varied between hospital clinic (doctor/dietitian, 92%) and General Practitioner (8%). Most patients found at least one aspect of the hospital out-patient clinic very useful. The preferred method of coeliac disease follow-up was to see a dietitian with a doctor being available (P < 0.05 vs. all other options). CONCLUSIONS: Respondents to this study showed great variation in follow-up of their coeliac disease -38% were under no active follow-up. Patients would prefer to see a dietitian for long-term follow-up.},

   abstract = {AIM: To determine the fasting plasma carnitine ester in patients with celiac disease. METHODS: We determined the fasting plasma carnitine ester profile using ESI triple quadrupol mass spectrometry in 33 adult patients with biopsy-confirmed maturity onset celiac disease maintained on long term gluten free diet. RESULTS: The level of free carnitine did not differ as the celiac disease patients were compared with the healthy controls, whereas the acetylcarnitine level was markedly reduced (4.703 +/- 0.205 vs 10.227 +/-0.368 nmol/mL, P<0.01). The level of propionylcarnitine was 61.5%, butyrylcarnitine 56.9%, hexanoylcarnitine 75%, octanoylcarnitine 71.1%, octenoylcarnitine 52.1%, decanoylcarnitine 73.1%, cecenoylcarnitine 58.3%, lauroylcarnitine 61.5%, miristoylcarnitine 66.7%, miristoleylcarnitine 62.5% and oleylcarnitine 81.1% in the celiac disease patients compared to the control values, respectively (P<0.01). CONCLUSION: The marked decrease of circulating acetylcarnitine with 50-80 % decrease of 11 other carnitine esters shows that the carnitine ester metabolism can be influenced even in clinically asymptomatic and well being adult celiac disease patients, and gluten withdrawal alone does not necessarily normalize all elements of the disturbed carnitine homeostasis.},

   abstract = {Celiac disease (CD) is a chronic, immune-mediated disorder of the gut, driven by T cells reacting locally to a distinct antigen, gliadin. Thus, CD offers the opportunity to study the T cell memory response to gliadin and whether gut tropism and T helper cell type 1 (Th1) polarization, which characterize the effector phase, are preserved in the memory progeny. It is notable that previous studies yielded conflicting results as to the presence of gliadin-specific memory CD4+ T cells in the peripheral blood of CD patients. However, we used a different and highly sensitive approach based on fluorescein-derived label dilution, whereby the memory cells are identified operationally by their greater capacity to proliferate upon re-encounter with antigen. Thus, using flow cytometry, we could resolve multiple successive generations as well as immunophenotype the dividing cells. Here, we show that the peripheral blood lymphocyte of some CD patients on a gliadin-free diet, but not healthy donors, contains a detectable population of CD4+ memory T cells specific for deamidated gliadin. Moreover, these gliadin-specific memory T cells are marked by a distinctive phenotype: They express high levels of the gut-homing beta7 integrins and primarily produce interferon-gamma and tumor necrosis factor alpha. We conclude that memory for gliadin-derived antigens within the circulating CD4+ T cells is linked with gut tropism as well as Th1 polarization.},

A specific kind of occipital cerebral calcifications in relation to coeliac disease has been also described, and sometimes it means the existence of a syndrome called "Gobby's Syndrome". We show a patient with a mild unknown coeliac disease, a woman who had occipital cerebral calcifications in a TAC cerebral, which was made because of her intractable migraines and that it lead to the diagnosis. The migraine disappeared after a gluten free-diet, like similar cases reported by literature. The fact of existing neurological symptoms associated to coeliac diseases opens a therapeutic window of opportunity because they would respond to a gluten free-diet.},

   abstract = {OBJECTIVE: Patients with autoimmune Addison's disease (AAD) are prone to develop other autoimmune manifestations. An increased prevalence of celiac disease (CD) has recently been demonstrated in Northern European patients with AAD. IgA deficiency is the most frequent type of immunodeficiency among humans and is present in about one in every 600 individuals in the population. IgA deficiency is frequent in patients with other autoimmune diseases, but data concerning AAD are still unavailable. DESIGN: The aim was to define the prevalence of CD and of IgA deficiency in a group of Italian patients with AAD. METHODS: One hundred and nine patients with AAD were enrolled and examined for tissue transglutaminase autoantibodies of the IgA class, circulating levels of IgA and adrenal cortex antibodies. RESULTS: Two (1.8%) of the patients were affected by already diagnosed CD and were already on a gluten-free diet. Out of the remaining 107 patients, four (3.7%) were found to be positive for IgA antibodies to human tissue transglutaminase. Three of the four patients who were positive for tissue transglutaminase autoantibodies agreed to undergo endoscopy and duodenal biopsies and, in one, a latent form of CD was identified. The clinical, silent or latent form of CD was present in six out of 109 (5.4%). This prevalence was significantly higher (P = 0.0001) than that reported for the Northern Italian population which was equal to 0.063%. Specifically, CD was present in 12.5% of the autoimmune polyglandular syndrome (APS) type 1 cases, in four out of 60 (6.7%) of the APS type 2 cases and in one out of 40 (2.5%) of the isolated AAD cases. IgA deficiency was present in two out of 109 patients (1.8%), all of whom had normal IgG anti-gliadin. Autoantibodies to the adrenal cortex were detected in 81 out of 109 patients (74.3%). CONCLUSIONS: In patients with AAD there is a high prevalence of both CD and IgA deficiency. Consequently, it is important to screen for CD with tissue transglutaminase autoantibodies of the IgA class and for IgA levels.},

   abstract = {OBJECTIVES: In developed countries, small bowel histology in coeliac disease is a spectrum, ranging from normal with increased intraepithelial lymphocytes to the classic flat mucosa. In developing countries, mild to moderate enteropathies in children with chronic diarrhea and growth failure are assumed to be caused by tropical sprue, persistent infections, or malnutrition with bacterial overgrowth. We report the prevalence and histology of coeliac disease in children with chronic diarrhea at a tertiary referral hospital in North India. METHODS: Two hundred fifty-nine children with symptoms indicating coeliac disease attended the All India Institute of Medical Sciences. Histology was graded after a modified Marsh classification. Serum immunoglobulin A anti-endomysial antibodies (AEA) were assayed using indirect immunofluorescence. Subjects with abnormal histology and positive AEA were put on a gluten free diet (GFD). Coeliac disease was diagnosed on small intestinal biopsy changes and a clinical response to a GFD. RESULTS: Severe enteropathies were present in 63 (24%) subjects, and 58 (92%) responded to a GFD. Sixty-six (25%) had moderate histologic changes, 61 responding to a GFD. AEA was positive in 56 of 63 patients with severe and 65 of 66 with moderate enteropathies. Fifty-seven children had mild enteropathies, and 19 of 20 with positive AEA responded clinically to a GFD. CONCLUSIONS: Coeliac disease is more common than previously believed. It presents a variable histology, and diagnoses may be missed or delayed if based only on severe enteropathies. Serology is a useful adjunct to diagnosis, and diagnostic criteria need to be developed appropriately for coeliac disease in developing countries despite limited facilities.},

   abstract = {Celiac disease is an immune mediated enteropathy initiated by ingestion of gluten, in genetically susceptible individuals. With changing epidemiology, celiac disease initially thought to affect only Europeans, has been increasingly reported from other parts of the world including India. However, its true prevalence in India is still not known, as the diagnosis is being missed. The gold standards for diagnosis have been characteristic small intestinal mucosal changes on gluten and a full clinical remission on its removal from the diet. Presence of serological antibodies, which disappear on gluten free diet further confirms the diagnosis. The understanding of the histopathology of celiac disease has changed over the years. The small bowel mucosal lesion of celiac disease is an evolutionary process with normal mucosal architecture and an increase in intraepithelial lymphocytes at one end of the spectrum and classical flat mucosa at the other. In the Indian subcontinent celiac disease has a heterogeneous histological presentation and the diagnosis may be missed if it is based only on severe mucosal changes or the serology is not considered when moderate or mild mucosal changes are present. The last two decades have shown that antiendomysical (Anti EMA) and anti tissue transglutaminase antibodies (anti-tTGA) have a sensitivity and specificity of more than 95% to diagnose celiac disease. Anti EMA tests being operator dependent are more liable to errors and anti- tTGA may be preferred for large scale screening. However, the different source of tTGA antigen, varied techniques of production and the use of arbitrary units by different commercial kits can influence the diagnostic accuracy of the anti-tTGA assay. There is a strong genetic association of celiac disease with HLA-DQ2 or DQ8. The presence of HLA-DQ2 hetrodimer in more than 97% of a group of North Indian patients with celiac disease indicates that this population has a similar genetic risk for the disease. HLA DQ2 typing can be used for ruling out celiac disease where the diagnosis is equivocal as it has a negative predictive value of greater than 95%. Given the protean clinical manifestation and the heterogeneous histology a standard algorithm for diagnosis of celiac disease is important.},

   abstract = {BACKGROUND: Tissue transglutaminase, the coeliac autoantigen, was shown to localise in the enterocytes of coeliac patients and controls. It was speculated that surface tissue transglutaminase has a role in the pathogenesis of coeliac disease. AIMS: To study localisation of tissue transglutaminase in different stages of coeliac disease and other enteropathies with and without villous flattening. METHODS: Immunofluorescent and immunoblotting assays were used. Duodenal cryostat sections from 23 coeliac patients (10 untreated, 8 treated, 5 potential) and 18 controls (2 autoimmune enteropathy and 16 normal duodenal mucosa) were incubated with an anti-tissue transglutaminase monoclonal antibody. Slides were blindly examined. RESULTS: The immunofluorescent assay showed that monoclonal antibody localised in the subepithelial layer, in the lamina propria, and in the pericryptal connective tissue of all samples. It also bound to surface enterocytes in 8/10 untreated, 1/8 treated, and 3/5 potential coeliac patients. None of the controls showed an epithelial distribution of tissue transglutaminase. Immunoblotting experiments performed in enterocytes freshly isolated from duodenal biopsy confirmed these findings. CONCLUSION: Epithelial distribution of tissue transglutaminase is specific for coeliac disease rather than due to a non-specific mucosal inflammation. Analysis of different stages of coeliac disease suggests that the epithelial distribution of tissue transglutaminase is gluten dependent.},

   abstract = {OBJECTIVE: Antiendomysial antibody (EMA) production has been induced in vitro by the small bowel mucosa of celiac disease (CD) patients in clinical remission cultured in the presence of gliadin peptides. The aim of the present study was to use this in vitro system to determine whether it could be used to predict the clinical or histologic relapse to gluten challenge in CD children on a gluten-free diet (GFD). METHODS: Enrolled were 32 CD children and adolescents on GFD (group 1), and 80 controls (group 2) who underwent in vitro gliadin challenge. Subsequently, 24 group 1 CD children underwent in vivo gluten challenge to confirm the diagnosis. Biopsy cultures, with and without gliadin, morphometric analysis, immunoglobulin (Ig)A and IgG1 EMA detection, both in sera and culture supernatants, were performed. RESULTS: Of the 32 group 1 CD patients, 23 were IgA EMA positive in culture supernatants. The other nine were IgG1 EMA positive. All 24 children who had in vivo gluten challenge showed clinical or histologic relapse. All culture supernatants from disease controls belonging to group 2 were both IgA and IgG1 EMA negative, irrespective of gliadin challenge. CONCLUSIONS: Organ culture with in vitro gliadin challenge is able to reproduce the results of in vivo challenge. This system could reduce the need for gluten challenge in celiac children.},

   abstract = {Celiac disease is a multifactorial disorder caused, in genetically susceptible patients, by the ingestion of dietary gluten. Very little is known about the genetic factors, but there is a strong association of two HLA haplotypes (DQ2 or alpha1*05, beta1*02 and DQ8 or alpha1*0301, beta1*0302) with the disease. We investigated the relationship between polymorphisms in the first exon of the MBL2 gene, which encodes for mannose binding lectin (MBL) and celiac disease. Moreover we studied the MBL role by immunohistochemistry and TUNEL. Results were confirmed by clinical findings. We enrolled 149 Italian celiac patients; 116 were characterized by the presence of DQ2 or DQ8. The HLA haplotype was established by allelic specific PCR while the MBL2 genotype was resolved by melting temperature assay. Immunohistochemistry and TUNEL assays were performed on serial sections of biopsy specimens from celiac patients and healthy controls. MBL2 allele and genotype frequencies varied significantly between celiac patients and healthy controls. The frequencies of the 0 allele were 28% in DQ2 or DQ8 celiac patients, 36% in HLA atypical celiac patients, and 22% in healthy controls. Interestingly, the MBL2 0/0 genotype was present in 7 of 33 HLA atypical celiac patients (21%) and in 13 of 116 HLA typical celiac patients (13%) but in only 7 of 147 healthy controls (5%). Furthermore, we found that MBL2 genotype is strongly associated with the occurrence of secondary autoimmune diseases. Immunohistochemistry and TUNEL findings support a role of MBL2 in the clearance of apoptotic cells. In conclusion, MBL2 variants, responsible for lower MBL levels, are associated with celiac disease and higher risk of developing autoimmune diseases. Here we propose a role for MBL in the disease which could be easily applied to other autoimmune disorders.},

   abstract = {OBJECTIVE: To assess the occurrence of growth hormone deficiency (GHD) in patients with coeliac disease (CD). STUDY DESIGN: A total of 1066 children diagnosed elsewhere with short stature were referred to our centre for second-line evaluation in a 6-year period. All patients were screened for CD by antiendomysial antibodies (EMA) and those with positive sera underwent intestinal biopsy. RESULTS: Among the 1066 short children, 210 (19.7%) had GHD and 12 (1.12%; chronological age from 3.6 to 12.3 years, bone age from 1.5 to 10.5 years, SDS height from -3.05 to -0.48), having positive EMA, showed histologically confirmed CD. Nine of these latter 12 CD children had a beneficial effect on growth rate after the first year of gluten-free diet, while the remaining three showed no catch-up growth. A careful endocrinological investigation in these three CD boys showed an isolated GHD in two cases and a multiple GHD in one case. The congenital origin of GHD is supported by the congenital abnormalities documented by magnetic resonance imaging. GH therapy associated with gluten-free diet led to an increased growth rate. CONCLUSION: GH secretion should be evaluated in coeliac patients showing no catch-up growth after a period on a gluten-free diet in spite of reversion to seronegativity for EMA. In the case of GHD and CD, replacement GH therapy should be started during a gluten-free diet.},

However, few studies have examined the small intestinal immune response to barley and rye. AIM: To investigate the immunogenicity of barley and rye prolamins (hordein and secalin respectively) in comparison with wheat gliadin. METHODS: Duodenal biopsies from 22 coeliac patients and 23 disease controls were cultured for 4 h with gliadin, hordein or secalin and compared with culture medium alone. Proinflammatory cytokines, interferon-gamma and interleukin-2, were quantified by TaqMan polymerase chain reaction and enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay. RESULTS: Hordein caused the greatest increase in interferon-gamma mRNA in coeliac patients (median: 3.3-fold) in comparison with control subjects (median: 0.28-fold, P < 0.085). Secalin and gliadin induced similar levels of interferon-gamma mRNA with median fold-changes of 3.4 and 2.8, respectively, in coeliac patients in comparison with 1.6- and 1.1-fold increases in control subjects (P < 0.294 and P < 0.105, respectively). The median fold-changes for interleukin-2 mRNA did not differ between coeliac patients and controls. Cytokine protein was not upregulated. CONCLUSION: The findings of this study provide evidence that barley and rye cause immune activation in the mucosa of coeliac patients and support the practice that barley and rye should be excluded from the gluten-free diet.},

   abstract = {BACKGROUND: Celiac disease (CD) is increasingly recognized in North America and is associated with a peripheral neuropathy. OBJECTIVE: To report the clinical characteristics and skin biopsy results in patients with CD and small-fiber neuropathy symptoms. DESIGN: Case series. SETTING: Academic peripheral neuropathy clinic. PATIENTS: Eight patients with CD and neuropathy symptoms. Intervention Three-millimeter punch biopsy using the panaxonal marker protein gene product 9.5 to assess epidermal nerve fiber (ENF) density and a gluten-free diet. MAIN OUTCOME MEASURE: Clinical data and ENF density. RESULTS: All patients had asymmetric numbness and paresthesias. Three had more prominent involvement of hands than feet, and 3 had facial numbness. Celiac disease was diagnosed in 5 after their neuropathy began. The following serum antibody levels were elevated: tissue transglutaminase (n = 6), IgA gliadin (n = 4), and IgG gliadin (n = 7). Results of nerve conduction studies were normal in 7 patients. One patient had mildly reduced sural amplitudes. The ENF density was reduced in 5 patients. The ENF density was at the low limit of the normal range in 3 additional patients, 2 of whom had morphologic changes in axons. Three patients had decreased ENF density at the thigh or forearm, which was more severe than at the distal leg, compatible with a non-length-dependent process. Four reported improvement with a gluten-free diet. One had no improvement after 4 months. Symptoms developed in 2 while receiving a gluten-free diet. CONCLUSIONS: Patients with CD may have a neuropathy involving small fibers, demonstrated by results of skin biopsy. The pattern of symptoms, with frequent facial involvement and a non-length-dependent pattern on skin biopsy findings, suggests a sensory ganglionopathy or an immune-mediated neuropathy. Improvement of symptoms in some patients after initiating a gluten-free diet warrants further study.},

   abstract = {PURPOSE: Celiac disease is associated with hypocholesterolemia, which is thought to contribute to a favorable cardiovascular risk profile. This led to suggestions that the diagnosis of celiac disease and its treatment with a gluten-free diet may result in elevation of the serum cholesterol level and worsen this risk profile. However, no study proves this in adults. We therefore examined the effect of a gluten-free diet on the lipid profile in patients with celiac disease. SUBJECTS AND METHODS: We identified 132 patients with celiac disease who adhered to a gluten-free diet and had lipid profiles performed before and after a median of 20.5 months on the diet. The patients lacked diseases that may affect serum lipids. RESULTS: There were significant increases in total cholesterol and high-density lipoprotein (HDL) cholesterol (P < .0001) but not low-density lipoprotein (LDL) cholesterol (P=.06). The LDL/HDL ratio decreased by 0.36+/-0.7 (P < .0001). Both men and women had a significant increase in total cholesterol and HDL and a significant decrease in the LDL/HDL ratio. Only men had increases in LDL (P=.02). The greatest increase in lipid values was seen in those with the lowest initial values. The largest increase in HDL was seen in subjects with more severe disease as indicated by low albumin level and presence of total villous atrophy. CONCLUSIONS: Diagnosis of celiac disease and its treatment with a gluten-free diet resulted in improvement in the lipoprotein profile, which included an increase in HDL and a decrease in the LDL/HDL ratio.},

Our purpose is to describe a case series of African-American patients with celiac disease. Nine (1.3%) African-American patients with celiac disease were identified from a prospectively generated database of 700 patients with biopsy proven celiac disease and seen between 1981 and 2004. Females predominated, with seven, compared to two males. Diarrhea was the presentation in only two patients, while three presented with iron deficiency anemia. One third had at least one autoimmune disease. Compliance with a gluten-free diet, the only medical therapy of this disease, was poor. Only four patients adhered strictly to the diet. Celiac disease occurs in African-Americans and may well be underdiagnosed. Special attention needs to be given to methods that encourage adherence to the diet in minority groups.},

Whether these antibodies are pathogenic is not clear. The response of neurological symptoms and antibody titers to a gluten-free diet is still controversial. The objective of our study was to assess whether neurological manifestations in CD patients correlate with antibody titers and a gluten-free diet.Thirty-five CD patients (9 males, 26 females, mean age 37.1 +/- 12.6 yrs) were followed prospectively. At initial evaluation, 23 were on a gluten-free diet, 12 were not. At recruitment and during follow-up, patients underwent neurological and electrophysiological evaluation. IgG, IgM, and IgA anti-ganglioside antibodies were assayed by ELISA; anti-neuronal antibodies were assessed by immunohistochemistry and Western blot. Four patients, all males, had electrophysiological evidence of neuropathy; three had been on a gluten-free diet for several months, and one was newly diagnosed. One had reduced tendon reflexes; another complained of distal paresthesias. With regard to anti-ganglioside antibodies, three patients had a moderate increase in antibodies without symptoms or signs of neuropathy. No patients had ataxia or cerebellar dysfunction, although in four patients reactivity to neuronal antigens was found. In 17 patients, an electrophysiological follow-up (mean duration of follow-up, 9 months) showed no changes. In conclusion, the preliminary results of this prospective study indicate that neuropathy, usually subclinical, may accompany CD. Antibody titers do not seem to correlate with neurological symptoms/signs or diet. Ongoing follow-up will help confirm these data and clarify the role, if any, of antibodies in neurological involvement in CD.},

   abstract = {Patients with coeliac disease (CD), particularly those who are undiagnosed or do not adhere to a strict gluten free diet (GFD), are prone to develop complications. Malignant complications are the most serious and should be suspected when expected responses to GFD are not achieved or sustained. Lymphomas, mostly T-cell type, and other malignant tumours, particularly carcinoma of the small bowel, less frequently of stomach and oesophagus, are associated with CD. Loss of response to a gluten free diet (refractory coeliac disease) and ulcerative jejunitis are two recently described complications of CD that may progress to an Enteropathy-Associated T-cell Lymphoma (EATL). Coeliac disease-related lymphoma most often appears at extra-nodal sites, essentially the small bowel, although one have to realise that T-cell lymphomas arising in sites outside the small bowel could be related to coeliac disease. Workup of an EATL must include immunehistology and if necessary T-cell flow cytometry and T-cell rearrangement. Adequate imaging with CT and PET-scanning is mandatory.},

   abstract = {AIM: Coeliac disease is characterized by oral manifestations, such as dental enamel defects and recurrent oral aphthae. In this study we compared the prevalence of enamel defects and recurrent aphthous stomatitis (RAS) between patients diagnosed with coeliac disease and healthy controls. METHODS: A total of 72 patients with coeliac disease were studied together with 162 normal healthy subjects as controls to individualize the prevalence of enamel defects and recurrent aphthous stomatitis (RAS) in this disease. RESULTS: Dental enamel defects were found in 14/70 (20%) coeliac patients and in 9/159 (5.6%) controls. In particular, 13/53 (24.5%) coeliac patients with mixed or permanent dentition and 1/17 (5.8%) coeliac children with deciduous dentition had enamel defects. Altogether, 9/145 (6.2%) control subjects with mixed or permanent dentition had dental enamel defects. None of the controls with deciduous dentition had enamel defects. Thus, the enamel defects occurred more frequently in coeliac patients (p < 0.001). Regarding RAS, 24/72 (33.3%) coeliac patients and 38/162 (23.4%) control subjects had aphthous ulcers. Statistically significant differences were not observed between the two groups (p > 0.05). One in three coeliac subjects suffering from RAS received benefit from a gluten-free diet. CONCLUSION: In the present study, the prevalence of enamel defects was found to be greater in coeliac patients than healthy controls. Even though the prevalence of RAS in coeliac subjects varied from healthy controls, the difference was not statistically significant. However, more than 1/3 coeliac subjects suffering from RAS benefited from a gluten-free diet.},

In the present study, an attempt has been made to define whether cytotoxic cell subsets are activated in situ in the affected mucosa of susceptible individuals early after ingestion of a gluten-containing diet. Duodenal biopsies from 11 patients with coeliac disease who repeatedly underwent endoscopic biopsy after ingestion of individually dosed amounts of gluten were used for immunohistochemistry and in situ hybridization. To identify the cell subsets expressing perforin mRNA and protein, in situ hybridization and FACS analyses were performed on cells isolated from fresh biopsies. Compared with normal mucosa, the number of intraepithelial lymphocytes containing perforin mRNA and protein increased significantly in tissue samples showing moderate or florid coeliac disease and closely paralleled the severity of morphological alteration, whereas the frequency of perforin-expressing lamina propria lymphocytes increased only moderately. Cells isolated from florid biopsies that expressed perforin mRNA and protein were preferentially T-cell receptor (TCR) alphabeta T cells. The increase in both the absolute number and the percentage of lymphocytes expressing perforin mRNA indicates in situ activation of lymphocytes within the epithelial compartment in florid coeliac disease upon ingestion of a gluten-containing diet in patients predisposed to coeliac disease.},

   abstract = {Celiac disease (CD) long has been associated with neurologic and psychiatric disorders including cerebellar ataxia, peripheral neuropathy, epilepsy, dementia, and depression. Earlier reports mainly have documented the involvement of the nervous system as a complication of prediagnosed CD. However, more recent studies have emphasized that a wider spectrum of neurologic syndromes may be the presenting extraintestinal manifestation of gluten sensitivity with or without intestinal pathology. These include migraine, encephalopathy, chorea, brain stem dysfunction, myelopathy, mononeuritis multiplex, Guillain-Barre-like syndrome, and neuropathy with positive antiganglioside antibodies. The association between most neurologic syndromes described and gluten sensitivity remains to be confirmed by larger epidemiologic studies. It further has been suggested that gluten sensitivity (as evidenced by high antigliadin antibodies) is a common cause of neurologic syndromes (notably cerebellar ataxia) of otherwise unknown cause. Additional studies showed high prevalence of gluten sensitivity in genetic neurodegenerative disorders such as hereditary spinocerebellar ataxia and Huntington's disease. It remains unclear whether gluten sensitivity contributes to the pathogenesis of these disorders or whether it represents an epiphenomenon. Studies of gluten-free diet in patients with gluten sensitivity and neurologic syndromes have shown variable results. Diet trials also have been inconclusive in autism and schizophrenia, 2 diseases in which sensitivity to dietary gluten has been implicated. Further studies clearly are needed to assess the efficacy of gluten-free diet and to address the underlying mechanisms of nervous system pathology in gluten sensitivity.},

METHOD OF STUDY: ANA, ASMA, AMA, anti-LKM, antibodies to GPC and ANCA were determined by indirect immunofluorescence (IFI) and anticardiolipin, antigliadina and antitransglutaminase antibodies were measured by enzyme-linked immunosorbent assays (ELISA). RESULTS: There was no significant difference between controls and patients with ANA, ASMA, AMA, LKM, ANCA and GPC. The prevalence of anticardiolipin antibodies in RPL was significantly higher than controls (P < 0,01) and the prevalence of positive antibodies for antigliadina type IgA and IgG and IgA antitransglutaminase in RPL was significantly higher than controls (P < 0.04). CONCLUSION: We show that Caucasian Argentine women with RPL showed significantly higher incidence of anticardiolipin antibodies than normal controls and finally we recommended the screening of IgA and IgG antigliadina and IgA antitransglutaminase antibodies in pregnancy, because of the high prevalence of subclinical CD in RPL and the chance of reversibility through consumption of a gluten free diet.},

We have suspected that there are differences compared with white Caucasian coeliacs, especially with respect to iron-deficiency anaemia and vitamin D deficiency at presentation. AIMS: To compare the clinical and laboratory features of South Asian adult coeliac patients with adult white Caucasian coeliacs. METHODS: We reviewed the notes of patients attending the adult coeliac clinic over the past 10 years. All patients were older than 16 years at diagnosis. There were 40 South Asians and 90 white Caucasians. Symptoms, haematology, biochemistry, endomysial antibody status, HLA alleles and small bowel histology at presentation were compared between the two racial groups. RESULTS: There were significant differences between the racial groups. South Asians were younger at presentation than the Caucasian patients (mean age 27 years compared with 47 years respectively, P<0.0001); they were less likely to have 'irritable bowel syndrome' symptoms (P<0.01), but more likely to have features of vitamin D deficiency (P<0.03). Their haemoglobin (P<0.05), mean cell volume (P<0.0004), serum iron (P<0.01), transferrin saturation (P<0.05), serum 1,25-dihydroxyvitamin D3 (P<0.002), and levels were lower, while serum alkaline phosphatase levels were higher (P<0.04) than in white Caucasian coeliac patients. There were no differences with respect to serum folate, vitamin B12, serum calcium, alanine aminotransferase and small bowel histology. IgA class endomysial antibody positivity was similar in the two groups (88.5% for South Asians compared with 73.5% for white Caucasians). White Caucasian patients were significantly more likely to be DQ2-positive than the South Asian patients (97.2% compared with 83.3%, P=0.02). CONCLUSION: South Asians with coeliac disease are less likely to present with 'irritable bowel syndrome' symptoms, but more likely to have features of vitamin D deficiency and iron deficiency, and have a higher alkaline phosphatase than white Caucasians. The differences in HLA alleles seen in South Asians with coeliac disease compared with white Caucasian patients suggests that among the South Asians, non-HLA regions may play a stronger role in disease susceptibility and presentation.},

METHODS AND RESULTS: Determination in 400 Type 1 diabetic patients of serum anti-endomysial and/or anti-transglutaminase auto-antibodies. All subjects with abnormal serology underwent an intestinal biopsy. Ten patients (2.5%) had positive antibodies. Diagnosis of CD was confirmed by an intestinal biopsy. Eight patients were symptom-free, although laboratory findings suggesting malabsorption were prominent in the presence of CD [microcytic anaemia, iron and folate deficiencies, low levels of 25(OH)vitamin D3, calcium and cholesterol]. Other auto-immune conditions, especially vitiligo, were found in patients with CD. CONCLUSIONS: Asymptomatic coeliac disease occurs frequently in adult Type 1 diabetic patients, and is often associated with subclinical malabsorption. Screening should be part of routine evaluation, to implement life-long dietary gluten avoidance.},

   abstract = {BACKGROUND: Coeliac disease is a common chronic inflammatory enteropathy characterized by villous atrophy and crypt hyperplasia in the small intestine. The mechanism of the intestinal damage in coeliac disease remains unclear. Glucagon-like peptide (GLP)-2 is an enterotrophic peptide that causes crypt hyperplasia and intestinal cell proliferation. We postulate that GLP-2 may be involved in the mucosal changes found in coeliac disease. OBJECTIVES: To study plasma concentrations of GLP-2 in untreated patients with coeliac disease and determine the response to a gluten-free diet (GFD). METHODS: A 440 kcal gluten-free test meal was given to seven controls and 12 coeliac patients at three time intervals: (1) before commencing a GFD; (2) 3 months after a GFD; and (3) 9 months after a GFD. Serial blood sampling was performed over a 2-h period. Each sample was analysed using radioimmunoassay for GLP-2, GLP-1, N-terminal glucagon (N-glucagon) and C-terminal glucagon (C-glucagon). RESULTS: Untreated coeliac patients had significantly higher basal and peak GLP-2 and N-glucagon plasma concentrations compared with controls. After 3 months on a GFD, there was a significant decrease in basal GLP-2 plasma concentrations. There was no significant difference between GLP-1 or C-glucagon in untreated coeliac patients compared with controls. CONCLUSION: This is the first reported study of GLP-2 in coeliac disease. After a GFD there is recovery of the intestine and a reduction in the GLP-2 trophic response. Our findings support the theory that GLP-2 may be part of the mucosal healing and maintenance mechanisms in coeliac disease.},

   abstract = {UNLABELLED: Celiac disease (CD) and chronic urticaria (CU) are both sustained by immune mechanisms, but there are so far few data on their clinical association. We performed a case-control study to determine the occurrence of CD in urticaria and matched control children, and to assess the clinical relevance of this association. Children and adolescents were diagnosed to have severe chronic idiopathic urticaria in the presence of hives for more than 6 wk poorly or not responsive to oral antihistamines. Other known causes of urticaria had to be excluded. A matched control group without urticaria was enrolled. In both groups, the presence of CD was searched by assaying antitransglutaminase and antiedomysial antibodies, and confirmed with endoscopic intestinal biopsy. Results. CD was diagnosed and confirmed in 4/79 (5.0%) of children with CU and in 17/2545 (0.67%) of the controls (p = 0.0003). In the four children with urticaria and CD the gluten free diet (GFD) lead to complete remission of urticaria within 5-10 wk, whereas the disappearance of serological markers occurred in longer times (5-9 months). CONCLUSIONS: The presence of CD in children with CU was significantly more frequent than in controls. GFD resulted in urticaria remission. CD may be regarded in such subjects as a cause of CU.},

   abstract = {Celiac disease is a genetic disorder, presenting with malabsorption-related problems because of mucosal damage after ingestion of gluten. The only known effective treatment is a gluten-free diet. Early diagnosis and treatment are essential in preventing complications due to malabsorption. Here we report the case of an elderly patient with a fifteen-year history of diarrhea, diagnosed with celiac disease, who had developed several complications due to malabsorption such as anemia, electrolyte imbalance and osteoporosis. We believe that late diagnosis of celiac disease had played a great role in the development of complications. Moreover, celiac disease poses an increased risk for all types of malignancies. Our patient also had concurrent plasma cell dyscrasia, but did not fulfil the criteria for diagnosis of multiple myeloma.},

   abstract = {OBJECTIVE: Celiac disease (CD) is characterized by malabsorption, weight loss and increased energy expenditure. The aim of this study was to investigate the relationship between circulating ghrelin and leptin, which are produced at gastrointestinal level and are involved in energy balance regulation, and changes in body composition and energy metabolism in CD patients before and after gluten-free diet (GFD)-induced restoration of the intestinal mucosa. MATERIAL AND METHODS: Body composition (by dual-energy X-ray absorptiometry), resting metabolic rate and substrate oxidation rates (by indirect calorimetry) were assessed in 18 adult women with the classic form of CD (age 31.4 +/- 7.8 years, body mass index (BMI) 20.6 +/- 2.1 kg/m2) before and at least 2 years after GFD treatment and in 22 age-matched healthy women (age 33.1 +/- 7.2 years, BMI 22.9 +/- 2.1 kg/m2). Plasma leptin and ghrelin concentrations were assessed by the ELISA and RIA procedures, respectively. RESULTS: Fat-free mass was reduced before and after GFD compared to control subjects (p < 0.01), while fat mass increased after treatment (p < 0.01). Plasma leptin concentration was similar between groups and correlated only with BMI (r = 0.84; p < 0.0001) and percentage body fat (r = 0.86; p < 0.0001). Circulating ghrelin levels (pg/ml) were similar between untreated patients and control subjects, but decreased after GFD treatment (untreated CD: 282.6 +/- 55.5 versus treated 109.2 +/- 49.9; p < 0.0001 and versus control subjects 262.2 +/- 30.0; p < 0.0001) and were negatively correlated with BMI in CD patients (r = -0.32; p < 0.01). CONCLUSIONS: The low plasma ghrelin concentration found in CD patients after GFD treatment could only be partially explained by the slight increase in body-weight and fat mass. Further studies are needed to better ascertain the role played by an incomplete functional or quantitative recovery of ghrelin-producing cells in CD.},

Hypothyroidism and hypoparathyroidism were the consequence of a total thyroidectomy performed at the age of 65 yr for a large multinodular goiter. Six months after thyroid ablation the patient started to complain of abdominal pain, diarrhea and weight loss. Following, anemia and osteopenia were documented. A progressive increase of replacement therapy for hypothyroidism and hypoparathyroidism was necessary. The clinical presentation suggested a malabsorption syndrome: celiac disease (CD) was diagnosed by serological markers and duodenal biopsy. Following gluten-free diet a normalization of clinical and serological findings was observed, bone mass density improved and a reduction of L-T4, calcium and vitamin D requirements was observed.},

   abstract = {OBJECTIVE: A national change in infant feeding recommendations was proposed in 1996 in Sweden: a slow introduction to gluten during weaning was stressed, the recommendation being introduction at 4 instead of 6 months of age. The aim of the present study was to compare the prevalence of celiac disease in healthy young children born before and after the new feeding recommendations in 1996. MATERIAL AND METHODS: Sera from 679 children at a median age of 2.9 years (range 2.5-4.2 years) born between January 1996 and November 1997 were investigated with IgA-antigliadin antibodies (AGA) and IgA-endomysial autoantibodies (EMA) and compared with 690 age-matched children born between July 1992 and June 1993. Children with a positive test for EMA and AGA or EMA only were re-tested, and if positive at follow up, investigated with intestinal biopsy. RESULTS: At baseline, 2.2% (15/679) children were positive for EMA and another 0.6% (4/679) for both EMA and AGA. One child refused to be re-tested and eight children were still EMA positive at follow-up. Intestinal biopsy was performed in seven children (one declined biopsy), of whom three showed total villous atrophy. Two children with EMA titers 1:640, respectively, refused further participation in the study, but were strongly suspected to have celiac disease. In total, 0.7% (5/679) (95% confidence interval (CI) = 0.1-1.4%) were considered to have celiac disease compared with 1.3% (9/690) (95% CI = 0.4-2.2%) in the control group (p=0.4217). In addition, 0.3% of the children were diagnosed with symptomatic celiac disease compared with 0.7% in controls (p=0.0134). CONCLUSIONS: The prevalence of symptomatic celiac disease declined after the infant dietary recommendations were introduced in 1996, but we could not find any difference in undiagnosed celiac disease between the screened children born before and those born after 1996.},

   abstract = {BACKGROUND & AIMS: The frequency of elevated serum pancreatic enzymes in patients with celiac disease (CD) is unknown. The aim of this study was to evaluate the serum levels of pancreatic enzymes in CD patients. METHODS: Serum pancreatic isoamylase and lipase levels were assayed in 90 adult and 112 pediatric consecutive CD patients at diagnosis and after 12 months of gluten-free diet (GFD). Serum elastase and trypsin levels were assayed in a subgroup of adult CD patients. Pancreatic ultrasonography was also performed. RESULTS: Twenty-six adult (29%) and 29 pediatric (26%) CD patients exhibited elevated values of serum pancreatic amylase and/or lipase; trypsin was elevated in 69% and elastase in 19%. The frequency of elevated serum pancreatic enzymes observed was identical in the patients with "typical" and "atypical" CD symptoms and in the asymptomatic patients. Most of the elevated values were lower than 2-fold the threshold limits. Elevated pancreatic enzymes were not associated with alcohol consumption, drug use, presence of abdominal pain, or diabetes mellitus. Abdominal ultrasound scan showed no abnormal findings in the pancreatic region in any of the CD patients. After 12 months of GFD, pancreatic amylase was elevated in 3 cases and lipase in 2 cases; these patients had not strictly adhered to the GFD. CONCLUSIONS: We demonstrated a frequency of about 25% of elevated pancreatic enzymes values in CD patients, including subjects without gastrointestinal manifestations and apparently asymptomatic subjects. The finding of elevated serum amylase or lipase level, in the absence of signs of pancreatic disease, would appear to suggest a need to screen for celiac disease.},

This article reviews (1) the impact of the GFD on the quality of life of individuals with CD and their families; (2) the causes of poorly controlled CD; (3) the access to and source and quality of information provided by health professionals and other groups; (4) management strategies, including nutritional assessment and education guidelines; (5) a variety of resources available to individuals and health professionals; (6) innovative educational initiatives and partnerships; and (7) specific recommendations to address the increasing numbers of people with CD and the growing need for gluten-free (GF) foods and further education about CD and the GFD. Successful management of CD requires a team approach, including the person with CD and his or her family, physician, dietitian, and celiac support group; an individualized approach; understanding of quality of life issues; use of evidence-based, current information and resources; and regular follow-up to monitor compliance, nutritional status, and additional information and support. The physician must clearly communicate, with a positive attitude, an overview of CD and strongly emphasize the importance of a GFD for life. It is essential that the physician initiate an immediate referral to a dietitian with expertise in CD for nutritional assessment, diet education, meal planning, and assistance with the adaptation to the challenging new gluten-free lifestyle. Good dietary compliance will reduce the risk of further complications and associated health care costs and improve quality of life in patients with CD.},

   abstract = {INTRODUCTION: Chronic conditions modify perceived health in affected individuals. For this reason celiac disease, being a chronic condition, may impair health-related quality of life (HRQOL). OBJECTIVE: To analyze the impact of celiac disease in affected individuals. METHOD: Observational, cross-sectional, prospective study in patients with celiac disease by administering two HRQOL questionnaires: EuroQol-5D and GastroIntestinal Quality of Life (GIQLI). RESULTS: 54 stable patients on a gluten-free diet for a median 60 months, and 9 newly diagnosed individuals still on their usual diet were included. Overall GIQLI score was significantly higher, meaning a better HRQOL, in treated celiac patients versus pre-treated celiac patients (3.1 [2.7-3.5] vs. 2.4 [2.1-2.6], p < 0.01). Similarly, EuroQol s health status preference value was also significantly better in treated patients (0.87[0.8-1.0] vs. 0.7 [0.5-0.8], p < 0.01). EuroQol s visual analogic scale had also better scores, representing a better perceived health, among treated patients (80.0 [70.0-90.0] vs. 65.0 [40.0-71.0], p < 0.05). In comparison to EuroQol-5D scores among the healthy Spanish population, values obtained for celiac patients under treatment are similar to those seen in the general population. CONCLUSIONS: celiac disease impairs perceived health in affected individuals, which improves and reaches results similar to those in the general population when on a gluten-free diet.},

   abstract = {BACKGROUND: The widespread of serologic diagnosis for celiac disease has brought about an epidemiologic shift. Little up-to-date information is available on relevant epidemiologic issues regarding diagnosis, information, and therapy. OBJECTIVE: To examine forms of presentation, diagnostic difficulties, follow-up, information sources, and treatment-related issues regarding celiac disease. METHOD: A cross-sectional observational study using a self-completed questionnaire. RESULTS: Seventy-three adult patients were included; 15.0% of cases were diagnosed over 60 years of age. Most were non-smokers (91.8%). The rate of first-degree relatives with celiac sprue was 10.9%. The disease had a classic presentation in only 54.7% of cases. A functional gastrointestinal disorder was initially suspected in 42.4% of patients. Diet adherence is adequate, with unintentional lack of compliance in 15.5% of patients. Diet results in absent or improved symptoms in virtually all patients, but most of them consider compliance a challenge. Forty percent had difficulty finding gluten-free food, and 50.8% had problems in labelling recognition. CONCLUSIONS: Celiac disease presents at any age, has a great variety of manifestations, and responds very well to gluten-free diet. It is crucial that patients be highly motivated and informed, and that they know for certain which foods and manufactured products are to be to used. Therefore, adequate control will result from coordination and cooperation regarding all resources involved, including medical care, and information provided by associations and other sources such as the Web.},

Transabdominal bowel sonography (TABS) is a safe and noninvasive procedure that allows to detect intestinal abnormalities in many conditions, but actually is not routinely part of the diagnostic management of CD. AIM: To evaluate the diagnostic accuracy of TABS in CD patients. PATIENTS AND METHODS: Fifty CD patients and 50 dyspeptic subjects (control group) underwent TABS. The presence of fluid-distended small bowel loops with thickened valvulae conniventes and increased peristalsis was considered a TABS sign of CD. All clinical, biochemical, and TABS features were assessed at the diagnosis and revaluated after 1 year of gluten-free diet. RESULTS: TABS signs were present in 66% of CD patients. Sensitivity, specificity, positive and negative predictive value were 66%, 96%, 94%, and 74%, respectively. TABS findings were recorded in 82% of patients with endoscopical markers of CD, in 87.5% of symptomatic patients, and in 61% of patients without symptoms. After 1 year of gluten-free diet TABS was still abnormal in 20% patients, with no correlation with laboratory tests e/o symptoms. CONCLUSIONS: Patients with CD frequently present TABS signs of the disease and operators performing sonography every day have to consider the possibility to suggest CD diagnosis and aTTG determination in these subjects.},

The aim of the study was to evaluate rates, distribution, clinical features and environmental risk factors for food intolerances and allergies in immigrant children. Hospital records of 4,130 patients with celiac disease (CD), cow milk protein intolerance (CMPI) and food allergies (FA) diagnosed in 24 Italian Centres from 1999 to 2001 were retrospectively reviewed, comparing immigrant patients with Italian ones. 78/4,130 (1.9%) patients were immigrant: 36/1,917 (1.9%) had CD, 24/1,370 (1.75%) CMPI and 18/843 (2.1%) FA. They were evenly distributed across Italy and their native areas were: East Europe (23/78), Northern Africa (23/78), Southern Asia (14/78), Saharan and Sub-Saharan Africa (9/78), Southern America (4/78), Far East (3/7), Middle East (2/78). Despite differences in their origin, the clinical features of immigrant children were similar to the ones of Italian patients and among each ethnic group. The majority of them were born in Italy (57/78) or have been residing in Italy since several years (19/78). All of them had lost dietary habits of the native countries and had acquired those of the Italian childhood population. Food intolerances and allergies are present also in children coming from developing countries, and paediatricians will need to have a full awareness of them because the number of immigrant children in Italy is quickly increasing. The clinical features of food intolerances and allergies appear the same in each ethnic group, despite differences in races. Sharing of dietary habits with the Italian childhood population seems to be an important environmental risk factor.},

   abstract = {Celiac disease (CD) is associated with intestinal lymphoma and other forms of cancer, especially adenocarcinoma of the small intestine, of the pharynx, and of the esophagus. Enteropathy-associated T-cell lymphoma (EATL) is a rare form of high-grade, T-cell non-Hodgkin lymphoma (NHL) of the upper small intestine that is specifically associated with CD. This NHL subtype arises in patients with either previously or concomitantly diagnosed CD. In a subgroup of patients, there is progressive deterioration of a refractory form of CD. EATL derives from a clonal proliferation of intraepithelial lymphocytes and is often disseminated at diagnosis. Extraintestinal presentations are not uncommon in the liver/spleen, thyroid, skin, nasal sinus, and brain. The outlook of EATL is poor. Recent studies indicated that (1) CD is associated with a significantly increased risk for NHL, especially of the T-cell type and primarily localized in the gut (EATL); (2) the CD-lymphoma association is less common than previously thought, with a relative risk close to 3; (3) CD screening is not required in patients with NHL of any primary site at the onset, unless suggested by specific findings (T-cell origin and/or primary gut localization). The risk of NHL associated with clinically milder (or silent) forms could be lower than in typical cases of CD. Several follow-up studies suggest that the GFD protects from cancer development, especially if started during the first years of life. Strict adherence to the GFD seems to be the only possibility of preventing a subset of rare but very aggressive forms of cancer.},

The human gastrointestinal tract does not possess the enzymatic equipment to efficiently cleave the gluten-derived proline-rich peptides driving the abnormal immune intestinal response in patients with coeliac disease. Oral therapy by exogenous prolylendopeptidases able to digest ingested gluten was therefore propounded as an alternative treatment to the diet. The feasibility of this approach is discussed by reviewing recent data on the intestinal transport of gliadin peptides, properties of available enzymes and preliminary clinical assays. Development of new enzymes or enzymatic cocktails offers potentially more potent therapeutic tools that, however, need meticulous evaluation based on clinical, biological and histological criteria.},

   abstract = {AIMS/HYPOTHESIS: Type 1 diabetes is the result of an inflammatory T helper 1 (Th1) lymphocyte-mediated beta cell destructive process. The majority of diabetes-prone BioBreeding (BBdp) rats fed wheat protein-based diets, such as NTP-2000, develop type 1 diabetes and display a mild coeliac-like enteropathy. Mesenteric lymph nodes (MLNs), which drain the gut, are the major inductive site where dietary antigens are recognised in the gut-associated lymphoid tissue (GALT). We hypothesised that this compartment could be a site of abnormal wheat protein-induced Th1 cell activation. METHODS: MLN cells were isolated from BBdp and BB control (BBc) rats that were fed NTP-2000 or a hydrolysed casein (HC)-based diet at ages that pre-date classic insulitis. The inflammatory status, phenotype and proliferation of these cells in response to wheat protein were determined. RESULTS: The expression ratio of T-bet : Gata3, master transcription factors for Th1 and Th2 cytokines, was increased in the MLN from NTP-2000-fed BBdp rats compared with that from BBc rats, mainly due to decreased Gata3 expression. CD3(+)CD4(+)IFN-gamma(+) T cells were more prevalent in the MLN of wheat-fed BBdp rats, but remained at control levels in BBdp rats fed a diabetes-retardant HC diet. BBdp MLN cells proliferated in response to wheat protein antigens in a specific, dose-dependent manner, and >93% of cells were CD3(+)CD4(+) T cells. This proliferation was associated with a low proportion of CD4(+)CD25(+) T cells and a high proportion of dendritic cells in the MLN of BBdp rats. CONCLUSIONS/INTERPRETATION: Before insulitis is established, the MLNs of wheat-fed BBdp rats contain an unusually high proportion of Th1 cells that proliferate specifically in response to wheat protein antigens.},

It is thought that celiac disease is the result of an inappropriate T cell-mediated immune response against ingested gluten protein. The characteristic lesion of the small intestinal mucosa includes loss of absorptive villi and infiltration of the lamina propria with inflammatory cells. The clinical presentation of celiac disease varies greatly depending on patient's age, duration and extent of the disease, and the presence of extraintestinal manifestations. Unfortunately, most patients with celiac disease have either silent or atypical presentations, thus escaping diagnosis for several years. Medical nutrition therapy with lifelong adherence to a strict gluten-free diet is the only accepted treatment of celiac disease. Individuals at risk for this entity should undergo appropriate serologic testing, but there is no evidence to support mass screening.},

Multifocal motor or sensorimotor neuropathies and a more fulminant neuropathy, associated with ataxia and other neurologic manifestations, also have been reported. The effect of a gluten-free diet on CD-associated PN has not been studied systematically or prospectively; nevertheless, a gluten-free diet currently is the cornerstone of therapy. Although idiopathic ataxia associated with anti-gliadin antibodies and other neurologic complications have been reported to respond to this diet; there is data that indicate that neurologic manifestations may develop or persist, independent of gluten exposure. There is evidence to suggest that inflammatory processes may be involved. Immunomodulatory agents (such as intravenous immunoglobulin or infliximab), described to be beneficial in the treatment of refractory CD or CD-associated ataxia, may have a role in the management of CD-associated PN.},

The disease is strongly linked to the HLA system, though other genetic, environmental and immunologic factors, may determine the type and timing of presentation. The immune response within the intestinal mucosa is characterized by a well defined TH1 response, where IFNgamma secreted by specific T cells is the predominant cytokine, as well as an innate immune response to certain gluten-derived peptides, mediated by IL-15. The strict gluten-exclusion diet is the best way of reversing both the symptoms and the histological changes in the intestinal mucosa. However, the frequency of transgressions and a low dietary compliance had led to the description of new therapeutic alternatives discussed in this review.},

   abstract = {BACKGROUND: Capsule endoscopy (CE) is increasingly being used to investigate the small bowel for various indications, including obscure GI bleeding (OGB). However, false negatives have been described. Double-balloon enteroscopy (DBE) is a new endoscopic technique developed to potentially view the entire small intestine while allowing therapeutic options to be carried out when appropriate. OBJECTIVE: We described 4 patients with small-bowel pathology missed on CE but detected by DBE. DESIGN: Descriptive retrospective study. All patients underwent CE followed by DBE. SETTING: Single-center tertiary referral hospital. PATIENTS: Four patients were included. Three patients had OGB that required blood transfusions. One patient with celiac disease, compliant on a strict gluten-free diet for 5 months, presented with persistent weight loss and abdominal pain. INTERVENTIONS: DBE followed by surgical exploration and resection of small-bowel pathology. MAIN OUTCOME MEASUREMENTS: Successful identification of pathology missed by CE. Definitive treatment of small-bowel pathology by surgical resection. RESULTS: CE did not identify the small-bowel pathology in all 4 patients. The 3 patients with OGB had small-bowel masses found by DBE. Two of these were GI stromal tumors and one was an adenocarcinoma. The patient with celiac disease had a malignant ulcer, confirmed to be a lymphoma after surgical resection. LIMITATIONS: Retrospective study and small sample size. CONCLUSIONS: CE and DBE are complementary investigations. If there is a high index of suspicion of small-bowel pathology despite a negative CE, DBE should be performed.},

METHODS: We identified CD in 4 female patients affected by HFI from among 38 Italian HFI patients. RESULTS: Three of these patients were children in whom the CD-associated signs were hypertransaminasemia, failure to thrive, low weight, and short stature, whereas the adult patient had protracted diarrhea notwithstanding a fructose-free diet. The incidence of CD in our group of HFI patients was higher (>10%) than in the general population (1%-3%) (P<.02). CONCLUSIONS: The possibility of an association between these 2 gastrointestinal disorders is important, particularly in the management of HFI patients with persisting symptoms.},

   abstract = {AIM: To evaluate clinical and psychological status of adults with childhood diagnosis of coeliac disease who were re-exposed to gluten after only a few years and now on a gluten-containing diet, compared with adults with recent diagnosis of coeliac disease, and adults who remained on gluten-free diet after childhood diagnosis. METHODS: A total of 195 adults with a biopsy suggestive of coeliac disease in childhood, who either had adhered to a gluten-free diet for at least 1 year after diagnosis and now are either on gluten-free diet (n = 110) or on gluten-containing diet (n = 85), and adults with newly diagnosed coeliac disease (n = 165) underwent a medical check-up. RESULTS: Body mass index and main laboratory indices were statistically different among groups (lowest in never on gluten-free diet, highest in gluten-free diet). The lowest average levels of bone mineral density were found among never on gluten-free diet patients. Prevalence of autoimmune disorders was increased in never on gluten-free diet when compared with the transient gluten-free diet and gluten-free diet groups. Histology revealed villous subatrophy in all patients of never on gluten-free diet group, in 39 of 110 patients of gluten-free diet and in 84 of 85 of transient gluten-free diet groups. Herpetiform dermatitis was found in three patients of gluten-free diet, three of transient gluten-free diet and three of never on gluten-free diet. Dental enamel defects were found in 15 patients of transient gluten-free diet, 43 of never on gluten-free diet and in zero of the gluten-free diet group. Pregnancy outcome was not significantly different between the two groups, but neonatal weight was lower and breast feeding was shorter in the never on gluten-free diet group. Sexual habits, alcohol intake and cigarette smoking were significantly different in the never on gluten-free diet group when compared with the other two groups. CONCLUSION: Gluten withdrawal in childhood partly protects coeliac adults from clinical and behavioural effects of gluten sensitivity.},

   abstract = {Coeliac disease, the most common intestinal disorder of western populations, is an autoimmune enteropathy caused by an abnormal immune response to dietary gluten peptides that occurs in genetically susceptible individuals carrying the HLA-DQ2 or -DQ8 haplotype. Despite the recent progresses in understanding the molecular mechanisms of mucosal lesions, it remains unknown how increased amounts of gluten peptides can enter the intestinal mucosa to initiate the inflammatory cascade. Current knowledge indicates that different gluten peptides are involved in the disease process in a different manner, some fragments being 'toxic' and others 'immunogenic'. Those defined as 'toxic' are able to induce mucosal damage either when added in culture to duodenal endoscopic biopsy or when administered in vivo, while those defined as 'immunogenic' are able to specifically stimulate HLA-DQ2- or DQ8-restricted T cell clones isolated from jejunal mucosa or peripheral blood of coeliac patients. These peptides are able to trigger two immunological pathways: one is thought to be a rapid effect on the epithelium that involves the innate immune response and the other represents the adaptive immune response involving CD4+ T cells in the lamina propria that recognize gluten epitopes processed and presented by antigen presenting cells. These findings are the subject of the present review.},

Oats are tolerated by most patients with coeliac disease but are not totally innocent. There are considerable differences between individual patients with respect to clinical and mucosal responses to gluten challenge. In vitro and in vivo testing has identified synthetic peptides that are toxic to the coeliac small intestinal mucosa. This toxicity overlaps at least partly to the known epitopes that are recognised by small intestinal T-cells. However, the clinical significance of several of these epitopes is unclear, as is the maximum level of gluten intake that can be recommended to be safe for patients with coeliac disease. Future efforts may lead to better understanding of the disease processes as well as possible new therapeutic options.},

   abstract = {Pyridoxal phosphate is the cofactor for over 100 enzyme-catalysed reactions in the body, including many involved in the synthesis or catabolism of neurotransmitters. Inadequate levels of pyridoxal phosphate in the brain cause neurological dysfunction, particularly epilepsy. There are several different mechanisms that lead to an increased requirement for pyridoxine and/or pyridoxal phosphate. These include: (i) inborn errors affecting the pathways of B(6) vitamer metabolism; (ii) inborn errors that lead to accumulation of small molecules that react with pyridoxal phosphate and inactivate it; (iii) drugs that react with pyridoxal phosphate; (iv) coeliac disease, which is thought to lead to malabsorption of B(6) vitamers; (v) renal dialysis, which leads to increased losses of B(6) vitamers from the circulation; (vi) drugs that affect the metabolism of B(6) vitamers; and (vii) inborn errors affecting specific pyridoxal phosphate-dependent enzymes. The last show a very variable degree of pyridoxine responsiveness, from 90% in X-linked sideroblastic anaemia (delta-aminolevulinate synthase deficiency) through 50% in homocystinuria (cystathionine beta-synthase deficiency) to 5% in ornithinaemia with gyrate atrophy (ornithine delta-aminotransferase deficiency). The possible role of pyridoxal phosphate as a chaperone during folding of nascent enzymes is discussed. High-dose pyridoxine or pyridoxal phosphate may have deleterious side-effects (particularly peripheral neuropathy with pyridoxine) and this must be considered in treatment regimes. None the less, in some patients, particularly infants with intractable epilepsy, treatment with pyridoxine or pyridoxal phosphate can be life-saving, and in other infants with inborn errors of metabolism B(6) treatment can be extremely beneficial.},

   abstract = {The symptoms of celiac disease are diverse, and the disease is often asymptomatic. Without active serologic screening, most cases probably remain undiagnosed. Recent serologic screening assays allow mass screening for the disease. However, there is no evidence as yet to suggest that symptom-free celiac disease patients run an increased risk of small intestinal lymphoma or other complications. The prevention of osteoporosis seems to be the strongest indicator for widespread screening today. Screening asymptomatic individuals for celiac disease may be even harmful. A lifelong gluten-free diet is not easy to maintain, and the subject's quality of life may deteriorate. It is also debatable whether patients found by active screening adhere to a gluten-free diet similarly to symptomatic ones. The cost-effectiveness of population screening is dubious. Serologic screening should be applied in individuals with even subtle symptoms indicative of celiac disease, such as subclinical-isolated iron deficiency. In various autoimmune conditions, the risk of celiac disease is approximately 5% and, in individuals with affected first-degree relatives, 15%. Infertility, neurologic symptoms such as polyneuropathy, ataxia, epilepsy with posterior cerebral calcification, and osteoporosis are conditions in which celiac disease should be kept in mind. Elevated aminotransferases and liver failure can lead to a diagnosis of celiac disease. Evidence today does not support mass screening of celiac disease. Instead, increased alertness should be observed in patients at risk of the condition.},

Borderline villous shortening is common, making the histologic diagnosis difficult. The increase in intraepithelial lymphocytes is typical even in early-stage untreated coeliac disease. Unfortunately, this finding is unspecific. In coeliac disease, the relative density of gammadelta+ intraepithelial lymphocytes is increased. The presence of IgA class anti-endomysium or anti-tissue transglutaminase antibodies clearly increases the likelihood of the disease. Coeliac disease is closely linked to HLA DQ2 and DQ8, and their absence speaks strongly against the condition, whereas a positive finding is virtually of no diagnostic value. In borderline cases, the gluten-dependency of symptoms or mucosal inflammation should be shown by gluten-free diet or gluten challenge. No single test is efficient enough to distinguish unspecific increase in intraepithelial lymphocytes from early coeliac disease; clinical history, histology, serology and gluten-dependency should be taken into account in the diagnostic work-up.},

The pathomechanisms underlying these diseases are different, but the profile of the target antigens in wheat has not been compared for the two diseases. METHODS: We compared IgA- and IgE-reactive antigens in wheat using sera from patients with coeliac disease (n = 35) and food allergy to wheat (n = 16) by one- and two-dimensional immunoblotting. Furthermore, the IgG subclass (IgG1-IgG4) reactivity to wheat antigens was studied by enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay. RESULTS: IgA antibodies from CD patients and IgE antibodies from allergic patients recognised distinct profiles of wheat antigens. Furthermore, the IgG subclass responses to wheat antigens were different in CD and wheat-allergic patients. CONCLUSION: This study thus demonstrates that wheat contains antigens/epitopes which are preferentially recognised by CD patients, whereas others elicit IgE-mediated food allergy. This finding suggests that the nature of a food antigen may influence the quality of the pathological immune response in the gut and has implications for the diagnosis and therapy of hypersensitivity to wheat.},

The entity of bone loss is higher in patients with malabsorption at diagnosis but it is also present in asymptomatic or poorly symptomatic patients, occurring in roughly half of them. Calcium malabsorption and the release of proinflammatory cytokines, activating osteoclasts, represent the main mechanisms responsible for bone derangement. In coeliacs, the presence of an increased fracture risk was recently questioned and its importance on clinical grounds was reconsidered, in view of the fact that gluten-free diet generally improves bone mass and, consequently, reduces fracture risk. However, gluten-free diet rarely normalizes bone mass and the co-administration of mineral active drugs may be useful in a subgroup of coeliacs.},

   abstract = {OBJECTIVE: Enzyme therapy based on animal digestive extracts was investigated as a means of completely digesting toxic residues from gluten in the small intestine, thus providing a means of protection of the mucosa. MATERIAL AND METHODS: A randomized, placebo-controlled, clinical trial of an encapsulated enzyme extract was conducted in 21 coeliac patients in remission who were challenged with a modest amount of gluten daily over 2 weeks. Enzyme extract (900 mg) in three divided doses was administered during this challenge to half the group and a placebo to the other half in a double-blind, crossover design. Symptoms were recorded in daily diaries; blood was taken for tissue transglutaminase antibodies (anti-tTG) at the start and at intervals up to 12 weeks. Duodenal biopsies were performed for histological assessment at the start and end of each challenge period for 6 patients chosen at random from volunteers. After a further 10 weeks, the groups were changed over, and the same assessments carried out. RESULTS: Only 8 of the 21 patients (38%) had more than 5 episodes of moderate to severe symptoms during either of the gluten challenge periods, and in these, symptoms scores were ameliorated during enzyme therapy compared with the placebo period (p<0.02). Rises of 5 U/ml or more in anti-tTG occurred in only 5 patients at about 6-8 weeks after challenge, but were not correlated with symptoms. CONCLUSIONS: Only 1 of the 6 patients had normal histology at entry, thus focusing attention on the need for better management of the disease. By histological criteria, enzyme therapy offered better protection than placebo during the gluten challenges. The study supports the use of enzyme supplementation as a safeguard for patients with coeliac disease because of the difficulty of ensuring a strictly gluten-free diet.},

   abstract = {This mini-review presents the research carried out within the context of two of the main hypotheses of the aetiology of coeliac disease. The enzymopathic hypothesis of the disease has been placed clearly as the underlying deficiency causing increased levels of toxic peptides, while the immunological hypothesis has been implicated in the pathogenesis of the disorder as the result of the action of undigested peptides in the small intestine. As a consequence, we are proposing a unified hypothesis of coeliac disease, which takes into account the actions of these undigested peptides through their direct cytotoxicity and their immunoactivity. At the same time, work aimed at defining some of these biologically active peptides, which could be said to be involved in the aetiopathogenesis of coeliac disease, will be reported. The review also focusses on the use of enzyme therapy for management of the disease, which when used in conjunction with the gluten-free diet, offers a safeguard against damage to the small intestine caused by small amounts of gluten.},

   abstract = {INTRODUCTION: Celiac disease is an autoimmune enteropathy that appears on a predisposed genetic background. Its clinical presentation has been extended those last years by varied extradigestive manifestations. EXEGESIS: This is a case report of a twenty-year-old woman who presented simultaneously a celiac disease and pure red cell aplasia. The IgA and IgG antigliadin antibodies as well as antinuclear, anti-DNA, anti-SSA and anti-SSB antibodies were detected, without any clinical symptom supporting the diagnosis of systemic lupus erythematosus or Sjogren syndrome. Thoracic CT-scan reveals a thymus enlargement and biopsy concludes to thymus hyperplasia at histological examination. Pure red cell aplasia regressed after gluten-free diet, corticoid therapy and thymectomy. CONCLUSION: This observation, added to the three others paediatric cases previously published in the literature concern an uncommon association between pure red cell aplasia and celiac disease. However, they are not enough to conclude to a direct link between these two disorders. Pure red cell aplasia could represent un new dysimmune manifestation occurring in celiac disease, but this will need to be confirmed with others cases.},

At age of 31 she presented with diarrhea and weight loss. Abdominal tumor was detected by ultrasound. The surgically removed tumor was histologically a benign mesenteric multicystic lymphangioma.Simultaneously, celiac disease was diagnosed.Gluten-free diet resulted in a significant improvement of celiac disease,but not of autoimmune hepatitis. Autonomic neuropathy was proven by standard cardiovascular tests. The patient was a homozygous carrier for HLA DQ2 antigen characteristic for celiac disease and heterozygous for HLA DR3 B8 frequent in autoimmune liver diseases. Our novel observation on association of Holmes-Adie syndrome with autoimmune hepatitis and celiac disease is suggestive for a common immunological background for all three entities present in a patient with mesenteric multicystic lymphangioma.},

   abstract = {BACKGROUND AND AIMS: Idiopathic dilated cardiomyopathy (IDCM) and coeliac disease (CD) are two pathological conditions which may lead, by different mechanisms, to malabsorption of various micronutrients, including carnitine, active in cardiac metabolism. The aim of the present investigation was primarily to evaluate differences in serum concentrations of total carnitine between IDCM patients and patients with IDCM associated with CD and then also to evaluate, in the latter, the effect of a gluten-free diet on serum concentrations of total carnitine. METHOD AND RESULTS: Serum carnitine was determined by enzymatic spectrophotometric assay in three groups of individuals: group A, 10 patients (5 males, 5 females), mean age 46.5+/-10.8 years, presenting isolated IDCM; group B, 3 patients (2 males, 1 female), mean age 34+/-8 years, with IDCM+CD; and group C, 10 healthy subjects (5 males, 5 females), mean age 38.6+/-11.1 years. All patients with IDCM belonged to class NYHA I-II. Mean concentrations of total serum carnitine in the group of patients with isolated IDCM (group A) were found to be lower than in the controls (group C). The concentrations in patients with IDCM associated with CD (group B) were lower than in the control group and also lower than in the isolated IDCM (group A). After 2 years on a gluten-free diet, patients presenting IDCM associated with CD showed a progressive increase in mean serum carnitine levels compared to values observed prior to the diet. CONCLUSIONS: Patients presenting IDCM associated with CD show a greater decrease in serum total carnitine levels than patients presenting the isolated form of IDCM. A gluten-free diet, in these patients, leads to a progressive increase in serum levels of this substance.},

An increased prevalence of autoimmune diseases has been reported, particularly autoimmune thyroiditis. The aim of this study was to characterize thyroid disorders in patients with CD. PATIENTS/METHODS: Fifty-two patients with CD (43 female, 9 male; mean age, 41.1 years) were studied. Nine were on a gluten-free diet (GFD). They were divided into four groups: Group 1, without thyroid involvement (n=30); Groups 2A-C, with thyroid involvement (n=22); Group 2A, subclinical hypothyroidism (n=11); Group 2B, clinical hypothyroidism (n=10); and Group 2C, other thyroid disorders (n=1). CD was confirmed by serologic and histologic criteria. Thyroid involvement was detected by measurement of thyroid stimulating hormone (TSH) and anti-thyroperoxidase antibodies (anti-TPO). RESULTS: Increased levels of TSH and/or anti-TPO levels were detected in Groups 2A (21.1%) and 2B (19.2%). The patients of Group 2B presented clinical symptoms of hypothyroidism before the diagnosis of CD, and 5 of these patients were receiving levothyroxine. One woman (Group 2C; 1.92%) had a medullary carcinoma. There was statistical significance between the age when thyroid disease was diagnosed (current age) and the age of CD diagnosis between Groups 1 and 2B. Patients with thyroid involvement presented associated diseases such as diabetes mellitus (2), Down's syndrome (2), ulcerative colitis (1), and dermatitis herpetiformis (2). CONCLUSIONS: Our findings demonstrated an increased prevalence of thyroid disorders (hypothyroidism, 19.2%; and subclinical hypothyroidism, 21.2%), and other associated diseases in celiac patients, even on a GFD, increasing with the age of the patients. Screening for associated diseases is recommended for patients with CD, independent of age at diagnosis or treatment duration.},

   abstract = {BACKGROUND: In coeliac disease, following the introduction of a gluten-free diet, monitoring mucosal disease activity requires repeated small intestinal biopsies. If a test measuring a circulating inflammatory marker was available, this would be clinically valuable. AIM: To determine if levels of soluble CD163, a scavenger receptor shed by tissue macrophages, correlated with the inflammatory lesion in coeliac disease. METHODS: Serum samples were collected from 131 patients with untreated coeliac disease, 40 patients with treated coeliac disease, 92 non-coeliac disease control subjects and 131 healthy controls. A capture enzyme linked immunosorbance assay was established to measure levels of soluble CD163 in sera. The extent of the histological lesion in coeliac biopsies was assessed using a Marsh grading system. RESULTS: Levels of CD163 in untreated coeliac subjects were significantly elevated when compared with the treated coeliac patients, the disease control group and the healthy control subjects (P < 0.0001 in each instance). Moreover, coeliac patients with the most marked histological lesion (Marsh 3) had significantly higher levels of soluble CD163 than patients with Marsh grade 2 lesions (P < 0.0004), with grade 1 lesions (P < 0.0001) and grade 0 lesions (P < 0.0001). CONCLUSIONS: Measurement of soluble CD163 may be a useful method of monitoring the inflammatory lesion in coeliac disease.},

This study aimed to report our initial experience with hand-assisted laparoscopic distal pancreatectomy. METHODS: A retrospective review of a prospectively collected database including 17 patients during the period 2002-2004 was conducted. The median age was 60 years (range, 29-85 years), and the female-to-male ratio was 13:4. The preoperative diagnoses included benign and malignant conditions. Besides two to three ports, a hand port was placed in the upper midline to aid in dissection. The pancreas was divided with a stapler in all the patients, and drains were placed in 10 patients (70%). RESULTS: One patient was found to be unresectable because of celiac artery involvement, and 2 of the remaining 16 patients underwent conversion to an open procedure. The median operating time was 196 min (range, 128-235 min). The mean tumor size was 4 cm (range, 2-7 cm), and the estimated blood loss was 125 ml (range, 50-1,250 ml). The median time to resumption of a regular diet was 3.5 days (range, 2-9 days), and the time to conversion to oral pain medications was 3 days (range, 2-9 days). The length of hospital stay was 5.5 days (range, 4-18 days), with a majority of the patients (11 patients, 78%) staying less than 7 days. There were no mortalities. The overall postoperative morbidity rate was 25%, and the morbidities consisted of pancreatic leak/fistula (2 patients, 14%) and fever (1 patient). The margins were negative in 10 (76%) of the relevant 13 patients. At a median follow-up period of 3.8 months (range, 5-14 months), 11 (84%) of 13 patients had no evidence of disease recurrence. CONCLUSIONS: The minimally invasive approach to pancreatic disease is safe and technically feasible. Further large studies with longer follow-up periods are necessary to determine the role of laparoscopic surgery in the management of pancreatic disease.},

   abstract = {A small proportion of coeliac disease (CD) patients fail to improve after a gluten-free diet (GFD) and may be considered as atypical regarding their outcome (refractory coeliac disease). The aim of this study is to diagnose and manage patients with CD who fail to improve after a GFD. Refractory coeliac disease (RCD) is a malabsorption syndrome defined by persisting villous atrophy with, usually, an increase of intraepithelial lymphocytes (IELs) in the small bowel in spite of a strict GFD and comprises a heterogenous group of diseases. Some of these diseases have to be excluded and can be treated by specific therapies like antibiotics in tropical sprue and giardiasis and immune globulin substitution in common variable immunodeficiency, while other malabsorption syndromes are less well defined and may require immunosuppressive therapy. Standardized treatment, however, has not been evaluated in such patients so far. In a subgroup of patients with RCD, an abnormal intraepithelial lymphocyte (IEL) population may be observed with the lack of surface expression of usual T-cell markers (CD3-CD8 and/or the T-cell receptor (TCR)) on IELs associated with T-cell clonality pattern suggest the presence of an early enteropathy-associated T-cell lymphoma (EATL) in a subgroup of patients with RCD. This hypothesis has been supported by studies, which revealed progression into overt intestinal T-cell lymphomas in a subgroup of RCD. Steroid treatment has been reported effective even in patients with underlying early EATL. However, long-term results are unsatisfactory in most of these patients with RCD and parenteral nutrition has to be applied in some of these cases. First results with more aggressive chemotherapies and use of cytokines are under way. Due to the difficulty of diagnostic and therapeutic regimens patients should be referred to tertiary centres for coeliac disease.},

   abstract = {INTRODUCTION: Refractory sprue (RS) is a rare malabsorption syndrome, which often requires long-term corticosteroid treatment. Locally acting budesonide could replace systemic corticosteroid therapy and reduce toxicity in patients with RS. AIMS: To evaluate the efficacy and toxicity of budesonide in patients with RS. PATIENTS AND METHODS: Clinical and histological data from patients with RS who received budesonide were analyzed. RS was defined as villous atrophy and malabsorption in spite of a strict gluten-free diet persisting for >6 months or requiring earlier therapeutic intervention. RESULTS: We identified 9 patients (1 with autoimmune enteropathy, 4 with RS type I without and 3 with RS type II with signs of early T cell lymphoma and 1 with CD4-positive sprue-like intestinal T cell lymphoma), who received 9 mg/day of budesonide (range 6-12) for 24 months (1-60), and 7 of whom had an initial treatment with 40 mg/day of prednisolone (30-60) for 4 months (1-144). The initial body mass index was 18 (13.1-22.8) and increased similarly under prednisolone [21.5 (14.9-26.7), p < 0.05] and budesonide therapy [21 (18-27.2), p < 0.05]. The stool frequency per day also decreased similarly from 6 (2-8) to 2 (1-3) and 2 (1-5), each p < 0.05, under prednisolone and budesonide therapy, respectively. Two patients with RS type II did not respond and 7, including all 4 with RS type I, were clinically stable with budesonide therapy. Skin fragility in 1 patient was the only adverse effect of budesonide therapy. CONCLUSIONS: Budesonide may be an effective treatment option in patients with RS type I, which can stabilize the clinical condition similar to prednisolone.},

Among these may be liver, rheumatic, gynecologic, dermatologic as well as neurologic diseases. Increased incidences have been reported in autoimmune diseases like diabetes mellitus type 1, IgA-deficiency and other autoimmune diseases. Altogether, epidemiologic studies have shown that celiac disease may be found as often as 1 in 300 persons. Differential diagnosis of refractory sprue has to account several different diseases. Besides an increased risk for lymphoma, also an increased risk for other malignancies like esophageal carcinoma has been described.},

   abstract = {BACKGROUND: Liver involvement represents an extra-intestinal feature of celiac disease (CD) and shows a clinical spectrum varying from nonspecific reactive hepatitis to cirrhosis. Here we report the association of cirrhosis with CD in 5 children. PATIENTS AND METHODS: The mean age of the patients was 9.4 +/- 2.8 years. Viral, metabolic, and autoimmune etiology of liver disease was ruled out. Intestinal and liver biopsies were performed to confirm the histologic diagnosis in all subjects. RESULTS: Three of the patients had chronic diarrhea and hepatosplenomegaly in whom diagnoses of CD and cirrhosis were established at presentation simultaneously. In the other 2 patients, CD was diagnosed following an initial diagnosis of cirrhosis. At diagnosis, alanine aminotransferase (range, 64-271 IU/L) and aspartate aminotransferase (range, 90-225 IU/L) values were elevated. After 1 to 5 years of a gluten-free diet (GFD), normalization of serum aminotransferase levels and clinical improvement were observed in 3 patients with strict GFD. The other 2 patients without improvement of the liver disease had poor dietary compliance. CONCLUSION: CD may be associated with severe hepatic damage in children and strict GFD may have beneficial effect on the course of liver disease. Serologic screening of CD should be included in differential diagnosis of chronic liver disease of unknown origin.},

   abstract = {OBJECTIVES: The ability of the gliadin fraction of wheat gluten to exacerbate coeliac disease is well documented. We investigated the possible toxicity of high molecular weight glutenin subunits (HMW-GS) in coeliac disease in vitro using gluten-sensitive T cells, and in vivo with challenge studies in patient volunteers. METHODS: A mixture of four HMW-GS was chemically separated from wheat flour and checked for purity by HPLC, SDS-PAGE and ELISA. T-cell lines, grown up from small intestinal biopsies from coeliac patients (n=17), were tested for their reactivity to HMW-GS. Adults with coeliac disease and who were on a gluten-free diet (n=3) underwent in-vivo challenges with HMW-GS. Duodenal biopsies, taken prior to the challenge and at intervals up to 6 h afterwards, were assessed for morphology, intra-epithelial lymphocyte count, and interleukin 15 (IL-15) expression, by immunohistochemistry. RESULTS: T-cell lines from 11 of 17 patients were stimulated by HMW-GS. There was a significant change in small intestinal morphology 4 h after commencing infusions with HMW-GS in all three subjects. For example villus height to crypt depth ratios were reduced in the three patients from 3.0+/-0.5 to 1.29+/-0.2, 2.53+/-0.7 to 0.81+/-0.6 and 3.0+/-0.7 to 1.85+/-0.3, P<0.0001 in all cases. There was increased expression of IL-15 in the small intestine from 2 h after the HMW-GS challenges. CONCLUSION: Mixed HMW-GS stimulate T-cell lines from some coeliac patients and exacerbate coeliac disease in vivo, inducing expression, within 2 h, of IL-15. This suggests an innate immune response to these proteins.},

The true prevalence of this condition is much greater than previously recognized, with increasing numbers of silent cases being diagnosed. Population-based studies, using serologic screening, have indicated that the prevalence of celiac disease in Caucasian populations is .5%-1%. The pattern of incidence is changing, with a greater proportion of cases diagnosed later in adulthood. The pathologic lesion is characterized by a flattened small intestinal mucosa with a lymphocytic infiltrate, crypt hyperplasia, and villous atrophy. Absorptive function may be impaired and patients can experience gastrointestinal symptoms and malabsorption leading to development of anemia, osteoporosis, or other complications. Untreated celiac disease is associated with significant morbidity and increased mortality, largely owing to the development of enteropathy-associated intestinal lymphoma. The pathologic changes and symptoms resolve when gluten is excluded from the diet for a sustained period.},

   abstract = {BACKGROUND & AIMS: We investigated the prevalence of functional hyposplenism in autoimmune disorder (AID)-associated and complicated celiac disease (CD). In addition, because the association between hyposplenism and overwhelming infections caused by Streptococcus pneumoniae in patients with CD is well known, we investigated whether immunoglobulin (Ig)M memory B cells, which are responsible for protection against infections by encapsulated bacteria and require the spleen for their generation and/or survival, mirror the reduced splenic function in CD. METHODS: Peripheral blood samples were collected from 73 adult CD patients (27 with AID, 36 without AID, and 10 with CD-related complications including enteropathy-associated T-cell lymphoma, refractory sprue, and ulcerative jejunoileitis). Thirty-four non-CD patients with AID, 35 healthy volunteers, and 29 splenectomized patients also were studied. Counting of erythrocytes with membrane abnormalities (pitted red cells) was used as an indicator of splenic function, and flow cytometry was performed to analyze peripheral blood B cells. RESULTS: A significantly higher risk for hyposplenism was found in AID-associated CD (59%) and complicated CD (80%) than in uncomplicated CD without AID (19%). In AID-associated CD, the degree of splenic function did not correlate to the duration of gluten-free diet. In AID-associated and complicated CD, the frequency of circulating IgM memory B cells was significantly lower than in CD patients without AID or healthy subjects. A significant inverse correlation between IgM memory B cells and pitted red cells was found in all 73 CD patients. CONCLUSIONS: The prevalence of splenic hypofunction is increased in CD with AID and in complicated CD, and is not related to the duration of gluten-free diet. IgM memory B cells are reduced in AID-associated and complicated CD. This defect, which is related to the impairment of splenic function, might predispose hyposplenic CD patients to infections by encapsulated bacteria.},

   abstract = {INTRODUCTION: Coeliac disease (CD) has been linked to several neurological disorders, with a clearly higher incidence of epilepsy than in the general population. Since Gobbi's original description of the epilepsy with cerebral calcifications and coeliac disease syndrome in 1992, various reports have been published concerning different stages of development, although a number of questions remain to be answered with respect to its pathogenesis. The aim of this study is to describe the clinical symptoms and progression of three patients with the characteristic syndrome, who were diagnosed in the early stages of the disease. CASE REPORTS: We describe the cases of three males, of school age, who visited because of partial seizures with visual symptoms that were secondarily generalised. A tomography scan of the head revealed bilateral occipital calcifications in all cases. The electroencephalogram showed temporooccipital paroxysmal discharges with a normal background rhythm. Tests for antiendomysium and antigliadin antibodies, with positive results, and a small intestine biopsy study were requested, which confirmed the suspicion of a grade 3 severe enteropathy. All the patients, following a gluten-free diet and taking anticonvulsants, were free of seizures in the follow-up (1, 2 and 8 years). CONCLUSIONS: It is of vital importance to investigate CD in any patient with epilepsy and occipital cerebral calcifications, even in the absence of digestive symptoms, since early diagnosis and treatment with exclusion of gluten affect how the syndrome courses later on.},

   abstract = {BACKGROUND: It is well established that a minority of celiac patients present with "classic" symptoms due to malabsorption. However, few studies have focussed on the distribution of body mass index (BMI) in celiac populations and its relationship to clinical characteristics, or on its response to treatment. METHODS: We reviewed BMI measurements and other clinical and pathological characteristics from a database of 371 celiac patients diagnosed over a 10-yr period and seen by a single gastroenterologist. To assess response to gluten exclusion, we compared BMI at diagnosis and after 2 yr treatment in patients with serological support for dietary compliance. RESULTS: Mean BMI was 24.6 kg/m2 (range 16.3-43.5). Seventeen patients (5%) were underweight (BMI < 18.5), 211 (57%) were normal, and 143 (39%) were overweight (BMI > or = 25), including 48 (13% of all patients) in the obese range (BMI > or = 30.0). There was a significant association between low BMI and female gender, history of diarrhea, reduced hemoglobin concentration, reduced bone mineral density (BMD), osteoporosis, and higher grades (subtotal/total) of villous atrophy. Of patients compliant with a gluten-free diet, 81% had gained weight after 2 yr, including 82% of initially overweight patients. CONCLUSIONS: Few celiac patients are underweight at diagnosis and a large minority is overweight; these are less likely to present with classical features of diarrhea and reduced hemoglobin. Failed or delayed diagnosis of celiac disease may reflect lack of awareness of this large subgroup. The increase in weight of already overweight patients after dietary gluten exclusion is a potential cause of morbidity, and the gluten-free diet as conventionally prescribed needs to be modified accordingly.},

   abstract = {BACKGROUND AND AIMS: Intestinal inflammation in coeliac disease is driven by the gluten fraction of wheat proteins. Deamidation or cross linking of gluten peptides by tissue transglutaminase (tTG), the coeliac disease autoantigen, creates potent T cell stimulatory peptides. Therefore, our aim was to identify the reaction patterns of gluten peptides, intestinal extracellular matrix proteins, and tTG. METHODS: tTG activity was analysed by incorporation of monodansyl cadaverine into gliadins. Fluorescence labelled tTG reactive short gliadin peptides were used to demonstrate their deamidation and explore their cross linking patterns with tTG itself or extracellular matrix proteins. Patient sera and controls were checked for autoantibodies to matrix proteins. RESULTS: Gliadins alpha1-alpha11, gamma1-gamma6, omega1-omega3, and omega5 were substrates for tTG. tTG catalysed the cross linking of gliadin peptides with interstitial collagen types I, III, and VI. Coeliac patients showed increased antibody titres against the collagens I, III, V, and VI. CONCLUSIONS: tTG formed high molecular weight complexes with all tested gliadins. As all tested gliadins were substrates for tTG, the tTG catalysed modifications were not restricted to single gliadin types and epitopes. Furthermore, haptenisation and long term immobilisation of gliadin peptides by tTG catalysed binding to abundant extracellular matrix proteins could be instrumental in the perpetuation of intestinal inflammation and some associated autoimmune diseases in coeliac disease.},

   abstract = {Coeliac disease (CD) is an inflammatory disorder of the small intestine characterised by a permanent intolerance to gluten-derived peptides. When gluten-derived peptides reach the lamina propria in CD patients, they provoke specific changes in the mucosa of their small intestine. Although the susceptibility to CD is strongly determined by environmental gluten, it is clearly a common genetic disorder. Important genetic factors for CD are the HLA-DQ genes located in the MHC region on chromosome 6 [HLA-DQ2 (95%) or HLA-DQ8 ( approximately 5%) heterodimers]. So far, the only treatment for CD consists of a life-long gluten-free diet. A key question in CD is why the gluten-derived peptides are resistant to further breakdown by endogenous proteases and how, in turn, they can activate a harmful immune response in the lamina propria of genetically predisposed individuals. Four mechanisms, namely apoptosis, oxidative stress, matrix metalloproteinases and dysregulation of proliferation and differentiation, are thought to play a role in the pathophysiology of CD. Whether the genes involved in these four mechanisms play a causative role in the development of the villous atrophy or are, in fact, a consequence of the disease process is unknown. In this review we summarise these mechanisms and discuss their validity in the context of current insights derived from genetic, genomic and molecular studies. We also discuss future directions for research and the therapeutic implications for patients.},

   abstract = {Celiac disease is a complex genetic disorder that affects the small intestine of genetically predisposed individuals when they ingest gluten, a dietary protein. Although several genome screens have been successful in identifying susceptibility loci in celiac disease, the only genetic contributors identified so far are the human leukocyte antigen (HLA)-DQ2/DQ8 molecules. One of the most important aspects in the pathogenesis of celiac disease is the activation of a T-helper 1 immune response, when the antigen-presenting cells that express HLA-DQ2/DQ8 molecules present the toxic gluten peptides to reactive CD4(+) T-cells. Recently, new insights into the activation of an innate immune response have also been described. It is generally accepted that the immune response triggers destruction of the mucosa in the small intestine of celiac disease patients. Hence, the activation of a detrimental immune response in the intestine of celiac disease patients appears to be key in the initiation and progression of the disease. This review summarizes the immunologic pathways that have been studied in celiac disease thus far, and will point to new potential candidate genes and pathways involved in the etiopathogenesis of celiac disease, which should lead to novel alternatives for diagnosis and treatment.},

   abstract = {Intestinal permeability is frequently abnormal in patients with celiac disease. The long-term effect of a gluten-free diet on intestinal permeability and the correlation of intestinal permeability with a gluten-free diet are not known. The objectives of this study were to determine the responses of intestinal permeability and antibody testing to gluten free diet and the degree of correlation of these measurements with gluten ingestion. In this prospective study, patients with celiac disease were divided into three groups based on length of time on a gluten-free diet: Group A, < 1 month; Group B, 1 month-1 year; Group C, > 1 year. Patients in Groups B and C were tested at baseline and at 4-12 weeks later for the following: lactulose/mannitol intestinal permeability, endomysial antibody, and 3-day food record. Permeability tests were also performed in Group A and control subjects. Intestinal permeability was elevated in newly diagnosed celiac disease and in individuals on a gluten-free diet for less than 1 year. Intestinal permeability was normal in 80% at visit 1 and 87% at visit 2 in individuals with celiac disease on a gluten-free diet for more than a year. Trace gluten ingestion was associated with increased intestinal permeability on visit 2 (P = 0.0480). The sensitivity of detecting gluten ingestion as measured by a 3-day food record was higher for permeability testing (29 and 36%) compared with endomysial antibody testing (18 and 18%) for visits 1 and 2, respectively. Intestinal permeability normalizes in the majority of individuals with celiac disease on a gluten-free diet. Gluten ingestion as measured by a 3-day food record correlates with intestinal permeability measurements. The role of permeability testing in the follow-up of patients with celiac disease warrants further investigation.},

   abstract = {BACKGROUND: For over a decade isolated reports have noted liver histology and biochemistry changes in patients with coeliac disease. The prevalence and response to treatment is clinically important. AIM: To outline the frequency and significance of liver abnormalities in coeliac disease. METHODS: A Medline search using Ovid-Coeliac/Coeliac (exp) and liver disease (exp) was completed of English references published during 1966-June 2003. Bibliographic references and other appropriate sources were also searched. RESULTS: Six studies reported liver biochemistry in 591 patients; 248 patients had abnormal results. Elevated transaminases were the most frequently reported abnormality. A gluten-free diet produced resolution of elevated transaminases in 115 of 130 patients. There was a greater than expected association with primary biliary cirrhosis and advanced liver disease. CONCLUSIONS: Mildly abnormal liver biochemistry is frequent in untreated coeliac disease and may provide a key to the diagnosis. Routine investigations for undiagnosed liver disease should include tissue transglutaminase testing. Left untreated, coeliac-induced hepatitis may rarely progress to end-stage liver disease. Primary biliary cirrhosis is clearly linked to coeliac disease. The full story of these linkages is yet to be written.},

   abstract = {Gluten enteropathy is a chronic all-life disease, characterized by typical inflammatory changes of the small bowel mucosa. It is the genetically determined autoimmune disease with permanent intolerance to gluten. Its clinical signs are very heterogeneous and also the severity of intestinal changes varies considerably. It frequently presents with atypical symptoms, as many as 80% of adult patients have no gastrointestinal troubles at all. The present estimated prevalence is 1:200 - 1:250. The diagnosis is based on criteria of the European Society of Paediatric Gastroenterology, Hepatology and Nutrition revised in 1990, above all on the detection of serum antibodies to endomysium and tissue transglutaminase. The five forms are distinguished: classic, subclinical, latent, potential and silent. Coeliac disease and dermatitis herpetiformis are considered to be two identical forms of the gluten enteropathy manifestations. Coeliac disease is frequently associated with other autoimmune diseases--diabetes mellitus, autoimmune thyreoiditis, hepatitis, IgA deficiency. Permanent gluten free diet is the cornerstone of the therapy; untreated gluten enteropathy is a serious illness, considered to be a significant precancerosis.},

   abstract = {OBJECTIVE: To present the case of an elite female volleyball player who complained of diarrhea and fatigue after preseason training. BACKGROUND: The athlete lost 8.1 kg during the first 20 days of training, and we initially suspected an eating disorder. The sports medicine team interviewed the athlete and found she did not have psychological symptoms indicative of an eating disorder. The results of routine blood tests revealed critically high platelet counts; in conjunction with the physical findings, the athlete was referred to a gastroenterologist. DIFFERENTIAL DIAGNOSIS: Our initial suggestion was an eating disorder. Therefore, the differential diagnosis included anorexia athletica, anorexia nervosa, and bulimia nervosa. On referral, the differential diagnosis was anemia, gastrointestinal dysfunction, lymphoma, or bowel adenocarcinoma. Diarrhea, weight loss, and blood test results were suggestive of active celiac disease, and a duodenal biopsy specimen confirmed this diagnosis. TREATMENT: The athlete was treated with a gluten-free diet, which excludes wheat, barley, and rye. Dietary substitutions were incorporated to maintain adequate caloric intake. UNIQUENESS: The presence of active celiac disease may not be uncommon. However, elite athletes who face celiac disease present a new challenge for the athletic trainer. The athletic trainer can help guide the athlete in coping with the lifestyle changes associated with a gluten-free diet. CONCLUSIONS: One in every 200 to 400 individuals has celiac disease; many of these individuals are asymptomatic and, therefore, their conditions are undiagnosed. Undiagnosed, untreated celiac disease and patients who fail to follow the gluten-free diet increase the risk of further problems.},

   abstract = {OBJECTIVE: Leptin has effects on growth and is also involved in immune regulation. We thought that with its intestinal histopathologic alterations due to immune mechanisms, and subsequent malnutrition and/or growth failure, celiac disease (CD) deserves interest regarding leptin status. METHOD: Serum leptin levels of 19 children with CD on admission and 1 year after gluten-free diet (GFD) and of 16 healthy children were determined. RESULTS: Mean age was 9.7+/-3.3 years. Mean serum leptin level of children with CD on admission and of healthy children were 1.60+/-0.63 ng/mL, and 3.98+/-1.49 ng/mL, respectively (P: 0.0001). Mean serum leptin level under GFD was 4.55+/-1.97 ng/mL. There was a statistical significant difference between serum levels determined before and 1 year after GFD (P: 0.001) and between those of under GFD and healthy children (P: 0.001). Of 19 patients with CD, 10 (52.6%) showed Marsh IIIc, other 9 (47.4%) showed Marsh IIIa histologic lesions. Mean serum leptin level of children with Marsh IIIc and Marsh IIIa were not different (1.70+/-0.73 ng/mL vs. 1.45+/-0.59 ng/mL). Leptin was correlated with body mass index in healthy children, and in CD both before and after GFD (P<0.001). Mean lumbar z score of the patients on admission and after GFD were 2.7+/-1.3 and 1.9+/-0.8, respectively (P: 0.048). Serum leptin level was not correlated with lumbar z score either before or after GFD. CONCLUSIONS: Serum leptin level is affected in childhood CD, it is not directly related to histopathologic findings, and is responsive to GFD. Further studies investigating its level in different clinical and histopathologic presentations might give clear clues about the role of leptin in CD.},

   abstract = {OBJECTIVES: To determine serum nitric oxide levels in pediatric patients with celiac disease and to compare them with the results obtained after 1 year of gluten-free diet. METHODS: We studied serum nitric oxide levels in 41 newly diagnosed patients with celiac disease. Serum levels of nitric oxide were reevaluated after 1 year of gluten-free diet in 23 of them. Mean age was 10.4 +/- 3.4 years (range 2-17 years). RESULTS: The levels of nitric oxide in pretreatment 41 patients with celiac disease and healthy children were detected as 198.33 +/- 20.22 micromol/L and 135.63 +/- 21.17 micromol/L, respectively (P = 0.0001). Serum nitric oxide level, measured in the blood samples 1 year after gluten-free diet, was 148.27 +/- 27.25 micromol/L (P = 0.001). Serum nitric oxide levels were statistically correlated with the degree of histologic changes in celiac disease. In the patients with celiac disease, pretreatment level of nitric oxide was not correlated with the levels of triglyceride, cholesterol, albumin, aspartate aminotransferase, alanine aminotransferase, or creatine kinase. We found correlations with the level of nitric oxide and Hb, mean corpuscular volume, and ferritin. CONCLUSION: Higher serum nitric oxide levels found in children who had not compliance with gluten-free diet suggested the role of serum nitric oxide as an indicator of diet compliance. Because determination of serum nitric oxide is a simple, rapid, cheap, noninvasive, and highly sensitive method for celiac disease, we think that this parameter can be used in the evaluation of diet compliance in children with celiac disease or even instead of gluten challenge, due to more noninvasive property.},

   abstract = {BACKGROUND: Limited data on a short series of patients suggest that lymphocytic enteritis (classically considered as latent coeliac disease) may produce symptoms of malabsorption, although the true prevalence of this situation is unknown. Serological markers of coeliac disease are of little diagnostic value in identifying these patients. AIMS: To evaluate the usefulness of human leucocyte antigen-DQ2 genotyping followed by duodenal biopsy for the detection of gluten-sensitive enteropathy in first-degree relatives of patients with coeliac disease and to assess the clinical relevance of lymphocytic enteritis diagnosed with this screening strategy. PATIENTS AND METHODS: 221 first-degree relatives of 82 DQ2+ patients with coeliac disease were consecutively included. Duodenal biopsy (for histological examination and tissue transglutaminase antibody assay in culture supernatant) was carried out on all DQ2+ relatives. Clinical features, biochemical parameters and bone mineral density were recorded. RESULTS: 130 relatives (58.8%) were DQ2+, showing the following histological stages: 64 (49.2%) Marsh 0; 32 (24.6%) Marsh I; 1 (0.8%) Marsh II; 13 (10.0%) Marsh III; 15.4% refused the biopsy. 49 relatives showed gluten sensitive enteropathy, 46 with histological abnormalities and 3 with Marsh 0 but positive tissue transglutaminase antibody in culture supernatant. Only 17 of 221 relatives had positive serological markers. Differences in the diagnostic yield between the proposed strategy and serology were significant (22.2% v 7.2%, p<0.001). Relatives with Marsh I and Marsh II-III were more often symptomatic (56.3% and 53.8%, respectively) than relatives with normal mucosa (21.1%; p = 0.002). Marsh I relatives had more severe abdominal pain (p = 0.006), severe distension (p = 0.047) and anaemia (p = 0.038) than those with Marsh 0. The prevalence of abnormal bone mineral density was similar in relatives with Marsh I (37%) and Marsh III (44.4%). CONCLUSIONS: The high number of symptomatic patients with lymphocytic enteritis (Marsh I) supports the need for a strategy based on human leucocyte antigen-DQ2 genotyping followed by duodenal biopsy in relatives of patients with coeliac disease and modifies the current concept that villous atrophy is required to prescribe a gluten-free diet.},

   abstract = {OBJECTIVE: To assess the presence of both genetic and serological markers of coeliac disease in patients with microscopic colitis, and whether there was associated enteropathy. METHODS: HLA-DQ2, HLA-DQ8, serum immunoglobulin A-antiendomysial and immunoglobulin A-anti-tissue transglutaminase antibodies were investigated in 59 patients with microscopic colitis. Seventy healthy subjects acted as the control group. Endoscopic biopsies from the distal duodenum were obtained in DQ2-positive or DQ8-positive patients. Patients with histological changes compatible with gluten-sensitive enteropathy were started on a gluten-free diet. RESULTS: Seventeen of 70 (24.3%) healthy controls were DQ2-positive. Twelve of 25 (48%) patients with lymphocytic colitis (P = 0.027 versus controls), and 11 of 34 (32.3%) with collagenous colitis (P = 0.38 versus controls) were DQ2-positive. There were no differences in the frequency of DQ8-positivity. The coeliac serology was positive in one patient. Duodenal biopsies were performed in 23 DQ2-positive and/or DQ8-positive patients. None had villous atrophy (Marsh III lesion) (0%; 95% confidence interval, 0-6.1). A Marsh type I lesion was found in four patients. Three of these patients were put on a gluten-free diet with disappearance of diarrhoea. CONCLUSIONS: The results suggest that there is an association of lymphocytic colitis with HLA-DQ2 genes, which might be relevant in the pathogenesis of this disease. The association of microscopic colitis with Marsh type III coeliac disease seems to be rare, making it unnecessary to routinely screen for coeliac disease in microscopic colitis patients.},

There is not definite scientific evidence about AND AIMS: which are the recommended explorations to be performed in the diagnostic workup of patients with functional diarrhea. The aim was to assess prospectively the presence of gluten-sensitive enteropathy, bile acid malabsorption, and sugar malabsorption in consecutive patients with chronic watery diarrhea of obscure origin fulfilling Rome II criteria of functional disease. METHODS: A total of 62 patients with chronic watery diarrhea, defined as more than 3 loose or liquid bowel movements a day for at least 4 wk and a stool weight >200 g/day were included. The following tests were performed: (a) HLA-DQ2/DQ8 genotyping, and if positive, endoscopic biopsies from distal duodenum were obtained, and intestinal damage assessed; (b) SeHCAT (Se-homotaurocholate) abdominal retention test; (c) small bowel follow-through; and (d) hydrogen breath test (lactose, fructose + sorbitol). Gluten- or sugar-free diet, or cholestyramine was administered according to results. Functional disease was diagnosed if all tests performed were normal or if either there was no response to specific therapy or diarrhea relapsed during a 12-month follow-up. RESULTS: Bile acid malabsorption was considered to be the cause of diarrhea in 28 (45.2%) patients, sugar malabsorption in 10 (16.1%), gluten-sensitive enteropathy in 10 (16.1%), and both bile acid and sugar malabsorption in 2 patients. Twelve (19.4%) patients remained without a specific diagnosis and were considered as functional bowel disease. Diarrhea stopped in the 50 patients after specific treatment, decreasing the daily stool number from 5.4 +/- 0.3 to 1.5 +/- 0.1 (P < 0.0005), without relapse after the 12-months follow-up. CONCLUSIONS: The diagnosis of functional disease in patients with chronic watery diarrhea should be performed with caution since in most cases there is an organic cause that justifies diarrhea.},

Inadequate iron intake was the cause of ID or iron deficiency anemia (IDA) in 59 subjects from the first months of life to adolescence. Blood loss linked to cow's milk intolerance was the cause of ID or IDA in 37 younger children. Meckel's diverticulum (MD) (6 cases), reflux esophagitis (RE) (10 cases), some drugs such as acetyl salicylic acid (11 cases) induced bleeding with ID or IDA in children and adolescents. In pubertal females with ID or IDA, polymenorrhea was observed in 16 cases. Coelic disease (CD) (37 cases), Helicobacter pylori infection (HPI) (39 cases), association of HPI and CD (8 cases), enteromonas infection (15 cases), determining particularly malabsorption, were causes of ID or IDA in patients of a wide age range, unresponsive to iron therapy. Our findings show that iron replacement therapy was not always required and should not be prescribed until the diagnosis is certain.},

   abstract = {BACKGROUND: The development of cranial proportions is the result of genetic, embriogenetic and environmental factors. Coeliac disease is a genetically inherited disease that is frequently diagnosed in adulthood in individuals, in whom the disease runs unidentified for years and can affect child growth from the moment of dietary gluten introduction up to the moment of gluten withdrawal following diagnosis. Data on the effects of gluten on craniofacial development in coeliac children are not available. AIM: The aim of the present study is to evaluate gluten-related effects on face development in patients with undiagnosed coeliac disease and their clinical relevance. METHODS: The study was a prospective, multivariate analysis. Face photographs of adult patients with coeliac disease and healthy controls were marked at six reference points and distances and the ratios among distances were measured by computer program software. RESULTS: The main finding of the study is that Caucasian Mediterranean adult coeliac individuals tend to have a peculiar aspect of the face characterised by a larger forehead when compared to general population controls. CONCLUSION: The craniofacial morphology of patients with coeliac disease reveals an altered pattern of craniofacial growth. This is the first report of alterations of craniofacial development in coeliac disease. This alteration is a clinical sign that should be included among the extraintestinal manifestation of coeliac disease. It has a frequency comparable to other signs or symptoms such as anaemia and short stature and is a better predictor of coeliac disease than other signs such as recurrent aphthous stomatitis, recurrent abortion and dental enamel hypoplasia. A large forehead is a sign easily evident visually or with very simple measurements; computer analysis is not required for the general practitioner. This sign along with the presence of other clinical signs and symptoms, should alert a physician to test a patient for coeliac disease.},

   abstract = {Skeletal demineralization and mineral metabolism derangement are well-recognized features of untreated celiac disease (CD). Although treatment with a gluten-free diet appears to prevent bone loss while correcting skeletal demineralization in childhood, there is evidence that bone mineral density does not return to normal in celiacs diagnosed in adulthood. Osteoprotegerin (OPG), a member of the tumor necrosis factor receptor family, and ligand of receptor activator of NFkB (RANKL) are involved in the process of bone turnover and have been implicated in the pathogenesis of osteoporosis and other metabolic bone diseases. We measured OPG, RANKL, bone mineral density (BMD), and biochemical markers of bone turnover in 32 adult female premenopausal celiac patients on a gluten-free diet, and thirty age-matched healthy women. We correlated the OPG/RANKL ratio with the severity of bone loss. Celiac patients had a mean BMD lower than controls in lumbar spine and in the femoral neck. Serum levels of bone alkaline phosphatase (BAP, marker of bone formation), and urinary excretion of telopeptides of type I collagen (a marker of bone resorption) were significantly higher than in controls. Serum OPG and RANKL levels were significantly higher in CD patients than in controls, while the OPG/RANKL ratio was significantly lower in CD patients than in controls and was positively correlated with BMD at the spine. The role of elevated OPG in CD patients is unclear, but it might represent a compensatory mechanism against other factors that promote bone damage. Further studies are required to assess a possible therapeutic potential of osteoprotegerin in optimally treated celiacs with persistent osteopenia.},

   abstract = {BACKGROUND: Coeliac disease (CD) results from mucosal exposure to dietary gluten in genetically predisposed individuals, although other environmental factors may be involved. The seroprevalence of CD is approximately 1%, with a high ratio of undiagnosed to diagnosed cases, leading to the concept of a 'coeliac iceberg'. AIM: To provide contemporary estimates of the incidence of diagnosed CD and the size of the submerged 'coeliac iceberg', and to seek evidence of disease clustering. DESIGN: Prospective observational study in a defined local population. METHODS: Data were collected prospectively for all biopsy-proven cases diagnosed at Poole Hospital, 1993-2002. Age-specific incidence was calculated and point prevalence estimated for cases within the defined study zone. Evidence of disease clustering was sought using a space-time scan statistic based on a Poisson model. RESULTS: The overall incidence of CD was 8.7 cases/100,000/year (95%CI 7.4-10.1), with a median age at diagnosis of 53 years. Incidence increased progressively during the study period, and the estimated point prevalence of biopsy-proven CD rose from 0.18% to 0.4%. An area of significant space-time clustering was identified, with an incidence of 22.9 cases/100,000/year (95%CI 16.1-31.6), but there was no evidence of seasonality. DISCUSSION: The submerged component of the 'coeliac iceberg' may be diminishing due to increasing case ascertainment, with a projected ratio of undiagnosed to diagnosed cases as low as 1.5:1. Our identification of clustering must be interpreted with caution, but suggests that an additional environmental factor may influence the pathogenesis of CD.},

The present study investigated: (1) the role of subdiaphragmatic vagal and non-vagal visceral afferent nerves in mediating a reduction in voluntary feed intake, using subdiaphragmatic vagal deafferentation (vagotomy) either alone or in combination with coeliac-superior mesenteric ganglionectomy (vagotomy and sympathectomy); and (2) the association between appetite, abomasal pH, selected blood values (amidated gastrin (G-17-amide), glycine-extended gastrin (G-17-Gly), pepsinogen and leptin) and worm burden, in sheep experimentally infected with 100,000 O. circumcincta infective larvae per os. Neither vagotomy alone nor vagotomy and sympathectomy in combination adversely affected the establishment or course of development of the parasite burden, when compared with a control group subject to sham surgery. Furthermore, neither surgical procedure prevented the drop in appetite seen 5-10 days post-infection, although combined vagotomy and sympathectomy did reduce voluntary feed intake prior to the start of the study. Ostertagia infection resulted in a significant increase in abomasal pH in all three groups, which was accompanied by an increase in blood G-17-amide and in G-17-Gly, the latter reported for the first time in parasitized ruminants. There were no significant differences in blood leptin, also reported for the first time in parasitized sheep, either between groups or in comparison with pre-infection levels, though weak negative correlations were established between blood leptin and appetite from day 5 to the end of the study in all three groups and a positive correlation with blood G-17-amide in the control group over the same period. These data suggest that neither intact subdiaphragmatic vagal afferent nerves or coeliac-superior mesenteric ganglion fibres, nor changes in circulating gastrin and leptin concentrations play a major role in mediating the hypophagic effects of O. circumcincta in parasitized sheep.},

However, little information is available on the biochemical bone turnover markers in celiac children treated with gluten-free diet. AIM: The aim of presented study was to assess bone resorption and formation processes by biochemical bone turnover markers in children with celiac disease on gluten-free diet. SUBJECTS AND METHODS: We studied 20 children with celiac disease (age range 1.5 - 16 yr; 11 girls, 9 boys). The mean age of diagnosis was 2.6 +/- 1.9 yr and the mean duration of gluten-free diet was 7.8 +/-5.1 yr. Results were compared with those obtained in 130 healthy children. Serum levels of bone-specific alkaline phosphatase and osteocalcin as bone formation indices and serum level of C-telopeptide of type I collagen as bone resorption index were measured by immunoenzymatic methods. Additionally, serum vitamin D, calcium and phosphorus were also estimated. RESULTS: Lower median values of C-telopeptide of type I collagen were observed in about 50% tested celiac patients. Some of them also had lower osteocalcin level. However, in most patients ranges of values of bone turnover markers were similar to those in the controls. During our observation, all tested children had normal serum concentration of vitamin D as well as of calcium and phosphorus. CONCLUSIONS: Our data show normal bone resorption and formation processes in most patients with celiac disease on gluten-free diet. However, some cases had changes in the pattern of bone turnover markers. Further studies of these patients are needed to assess their predisposition to osteopenia and osteoporosis.},

   abstract = {OBJECTIVES: In the past, one of the major problems in gluten analysis has been the unavailability of an efficient, universal, extraction procedure of gliadins - the alcohol-soluble proteins of gluten - from both heat processed and unprocessed products. This study was designed to develop a universal, extraction procedure capable of extracting the totality of gliadins from both unprocessed and heat processed foods for coeliac patients. METHODS: A simple quantitative extraction solution containing 250 mM 2-mercaptoethanol and 2 M guanidine hydrochloride ('cocktail'), was developed to extract gliadins from heated foods. RESULTS: The diluted reducing and disaggregating agents reaching the micro plate at low concentration do not affect the ELISA system based on the R5 monoclonal antibody. The recovery of gliadins extracted by the cocktail from spiked samples was nearly complete, with an average mean value of 95.5%, which is clearly superior to 44.4% obtained with conventional 60% aqueous ethanol. The cocktail always yielded either slightly similar or higher values than 60% aqueous ethanol depending on the type of foods: 1.1-fold in unheated foods, 1.4-fold in wheat starches and 3.0-fold in heated foods. False positives or negatives were never observed using the cocktail solution. CONCLUSION: We present a general complete gliadin extraction procedure based on reducing and disaggregating agents for both heated and unheated foods as a crucial tool for gliadin analysis. The new extraction solution is used for corresponding proteins from rye (secalins) and barley (hordeins). The cocktail was employed as the extraction method in the international ring trial evaluation of sandwich R5-ELISA as proposed by the Codex Alimentarius and organized by the Working Group on Prolamin Analysis and Toxicity.},

   abstract = {Celiac Sprue is a multifactorial disease characterized by an intestinal inflammatory response to ingested gluten. Proteolytically resistant gluten peptides from wheat, rye, and barley persist in the intestinal lumen and elicit an immune response in genetically susceptible individuals. Here, we demonstrate the in vivo ability of a gluten-digesting protease ("glutenase") to accelerate the breakdown of a gluten-rich solid meal. The proenzyme form of endoprotease B, isoform 2 from Hordeum vulgare (EP-B2), was orally administered to adult rats with a solid meal containing 1 g of gluten. Gluten digestion in the stomach and small intestine was monitored as a function of enzyme dose and time by high-performance liquid chromatography and mass spectrometry. In the absence of supplementary EP-B2, gluten was solubilized and proteolyzed to a limited extent in the stomach and was hydrolyzed and assimilated mostly in the small intestine. In contrast, EP-B2 was remarkably effective at digesting gluten in the rat stomach in a dose- and time-dependent fashion. At a 1:25 EP-B2/gluten dose, the gastric concentration of the highly immunogenic 33-mer gliadin peptide was reduced by more than 50-fold within 90 min with no overt signs of toxicity. Evaluation of EP-B2 as an adjunct to diet control is therefore warranted in celiac patients.},

METHODS: Families of 80 patients with CD diagnosed as per modified ESPGAN criteria were offered family screening. Their siblings aged 2-15 years were tested for serum IgA anti-tissue transglutaminase antibody (anti-tTG) antibody. Those with positive or borderline test and some of those with negative test underwent endoscopic duodenal biopsy. Siblings with characteristics histological findings and showing improvement on follow-up were labeled as having celiac disease. RESULTS: Of the 63 siblings of 48 index cases studied, 15 tested positive for anti-tTG; of these 13 had celiac disease. Three tested borderline for anti-tTG; none of them had CD. Of the 45 anti-tTG-negative subjects, two agreed to undergo biopsy; one of these had features of CD. Overall, 14 of 63 (22%) siblings had CD, including 8 who had no symptoms suggestive of CD. CONCLUSIONS: CD is common among siblings of patients with CD in Punjab and may be asymptomatic.},

   abstract = {AIM: To report a patient with C282Y homozygocity, depleted body iron and intestinal atrophy caused by celiac disease (CD) who experienced resolution of the enteropathy with subsequent normalization of iron metabolism upon gluten-free diet. METHODS: To obtain information on the tissue distribution and quantitative expression of proteins involved in duodenal iron trafficking, we determined the expression of divalent-metal transporter 1 (DMT1), ferroportin 1 (FP1) and transferrin receptor (TfR1) by means of immunohistochemistry and real-time PCR in duodenal biopsies of this patient. RESULTS: Whereas in hereditary hemochromatosis patients without CD, DMT1 expression was up-regulated leading to excessive uptake of iron, we identified a significant reduction in protein and mRNA expression of DMT1 as a compensatory mechanism in this patient with HH and CD. CONCLUSION: Occult CD may compensate for increased DMT1 expression in a specific subset of individuals with homozygous C282Y mutations in the hemochromatosis (HFE) gene, thus contributing to the low penetrance of HH.},

   abstract = {Celiac disease (CD) is an intestinal disorder caused by an altered immune response against wheat gluten, a common dietary antigen, and related cereal proteins. Both CD4+ and CD8+ T cells have a role in inducing the intestinal damage, although recent studies have also pinpointed the involvement of the innate immune response in CD pathogenesis. So far, the only available treatment for CD is the strict avoidance of gluten in the diet, but the poor compliance and the associated complications demand alternative therapies. During the last decade, the knowledge of genetic, molecular and cellular mechanisms leading to CD pathogenesis made great progress. The improved understanding of gluten peptides activating either adaptive or innate immune response, of HLA restriction molecules, as well as of cytokines that mediate most of the inflammatory reactions, opens several new promising perspectives for therapeutic intervention. This review discusses both molecular and cellular strategies to treat CD, including the use of proteolytic enzymes active on gluten peptides, antibodies neutralising IL-15 and IFN-gamma, drugs targeting HLA, regulatory cytokines and T cells.},

   abstract = {Celiac disease (CD) results from a permanent intolerance to dietary gluten and is due to a massive T cell-mediated immune response to gliadin, the main component of gluten. In this disease, the regulation of immune responses to dietary gliadin is altered. Herein, we investigated whether IL-10 could modulate anti-gliadin immune responses and whether gliadin-specific type 1 regulatory T (Tr1) cells could be isolated from the intestinal mucosa of CD patients in remission. Short-term T cell lines were generated from jejunal biopsies, either freshly processed or cultured ex vivo with gliadin in the presence or absence of IL-10. Ex vivo stimulation of CD biopsies with gliadin in the presence of IL-10 resulted in suppression of Ag-specific proliferation and cytokine production, indicating that pathogenic T cells are susceptible to IL-10-mediated immune regulation. T cell clones generated from intestinal T cell lines were tested for gliadin specificity by cytokine production and proliferative responses. The majority of gliadin-specific T cell clones had a Th0 cytokine production profile with secretion of IL-2, IL-4, IFN-gamma, and IL-10 and proliferated in response to gliadin. Tr1 cell clones were also isolated. These Tr1 cells were anergic, restricted by DQ2 (a CD-associated HLA), and produced IL-10 and IFN-gamma, but little or no IL-2 or IL-4 upon activation with gliadin or polyclonal stimuli. Importantly, gliadin-specific Tr1 cell clones suppressed proliferation of pathogenic Th0 cells. In conclusion, dietary Ag-specific Tr1 cells are present in the human intestinal mucosa, and strategies to boost their numbers and/or function may offer new therapeutic opportunities to restore gut homeostasis.},

   abstract = {OBJECTIVE: The threshold of gluten contamination in gluten-free products of both dietary and normal consumption is under debate. The objective of this study was to gather information on consumption of gluten-free products intended for dietary use of people under a gluten-free diet. This information is essential to ascertain the exposure of coeliac patients to gluten through their diet and deduce the maximum gluten content that these products should contain to guarantee a safe diet. METHODS: A diet diary of consumption of gluten-free products intended for dietary use was distributed to the coeliac societies of two typical Mediterranean countries (Italy and Spain) and two Northern countries (Norway and Germany). The diet diary included a self-weigh table of the selected food items and a 10-day consumption table. Results were reported in percentiles as distributions were clearly right skewed. RESULTS: The respondents included in the study accounted for 1359 in Italy, 273 in Spain, 226 in Norway and 56 in Germany. Gluten-free products intended for dietary use contributed significantly to the diet of coeliac patients in Italy, Germany and Norway and to a lesser degree in Spain. The most consumed gluten-free product in all countries was bread, and it was double consumed in the Northern countries (P<0.001). Mediterranean countries showed consumption of a wider variety of gluten-free foods and pasta was eaten to a large degree in Italy. CONCLUSIONS: The differences between Northern and Mediterranean countries were not in the total amount of gluten-free products but in the type of products consumed. The observed daily consumption of gluten-free products results in the exposure to rather large amounts of gluten, thus the limit of 200 p.p.m. should be revised. A limit of 20 p.p.m. for products naturally gluten-free and of 100 p.p.m. for products rendered gluten-free is proposed to guarantee a safe diet and to enable coeliac patients to make an informed choice. These limits should be revised as new data become available.},

A total of 7066 children with short stature were referred to a number of centers for second-line evaluation over a 5-year period. All patients were screened for CD by antiendomysial antibodies (EMA) and antitissue transglutaminase IgA. Those with positive sera underwent intestinal biopsy. The EMA-negative patients and the EMA-positive ones who did not grow after 1 year of gluten-free diet underwent endocrinological investigation. RESULTS: Among the 7066 short children (age 2-14 years) evaluated, 650 (9.2%) had GHD and 44 (0.63%) had CD. An association of both CD and GHD was found in 16 short children (0.23%); these children did not grow after 1 year of gluten-free diet and therefore GH treatment was started. CONCLUSIONS: GH secretion should be evaluated in celiac patients showing no catch-up growth after an appropriate period on a gluten-free diet in spite of reversion to seronegativity for EMA.},

Gluten-free products are not widely available and are usually more expensive than their gluten-containing counterparts. There is, therefore, an urgent need to develop safe and effective therapeutic alternatives, to develop high-quality gluten-free products and to investigate the potential of the bread making biotechnology following ancient protocols which include long-time fermentation by selected sourdough lactic acid bacteria. This review describes the most relevant results related to biotechnologies that use selected sourdough lactic acid bacteria and probiotics as starters for sourdough fermentation to investigate their potential to decrease the risk of gluten contamination in gluten-free products. As shown by studies in vitro on celiac intestinal tissue and in vivo on CD patients, the bacterial proteolytic activity is rather promising not only as currently demonstrated for eliminating traces of contaminant gluten but probably also in perspective for the manufacture of tolerated baked goods.},

   abstract = {Coeliac disease, epilepsy and cerebral calcifications (CEC) syndrome is a rare clinical condition. One hundred and seventy-one patients have been reported in the literature. Patients are mostly from Italy, Spain, and Argentina, suggesting a geographically restricted condition. Epilepsy is more frequently characterized by occipital seizures. It may be benign or drug-resistant, sometime evolving into severe epileptic encephalopathy. Gluten free diet (GFD) efficacy seems to be inversely related to the duration of epilepsy and the young age of the patient. Patients with cerebral calcifications (CC) and coeliac disease (CD) without epilepsy are considered as having an incomplete form of CEC syndrome. Some patients with epilepsy and CC without CD are supposed to have a CEC syndrome with silent or latent CD. Whether CEC syndrome is a genetic condition, or whether epilepsy and/or CC are a consequence of an untreated CD is unknown yet. Since histopathological findings seem to be the expression of vascular calcified malformation, CEC syndrome may be considered a genetically determined entity, such as a type of Sturge-Weber-like phacomatosis. Moreover, CEC, as well as CD, is associated with HLA-DQ2 and HLA-DQ8 phenotype and genotype. The progressive growth and late occurrence of CC before beginning a GFD, the demonstration of anti-gliadin antibodies in the cerebro-spinal fluid and the association with HLA class II genes, suggest that an immune reaction originating from the jejunal mucosa, triggered by gliadin in gluten intolerance predisposed subjects (HLA phenotype) may be responsible for seizures and CC. Moreover, a long-lasting untreated CD folic acid deficiency may cause calcifications. Probably, CEC is considered a genetic, non-inherited, ethnically and geographically restricted syndrome associated with environmental factors.},

Although previously believed to be uncommon, celiac disease may be present in up to 1% of the general population. Celiac disease is associated frequently with iron deficiency anemia, dermatitis herpetiformis, selective IgA deficiency, thyroid disorders, diabetes mellitus, and various connective tissue disorders but is rarely associated with cardiomyopathy. We describe a patient with celiac disease associated with cardiomyopathy whose cardiac function improved substantially after treatment with a gluten-free diet. Cardiomyopathy associated with celiac disease is a serious and potentially lethal condition. However, with early diagnosis and treatment with a gluten-free diet, cardiomyopathy in patients with celiac disease may be completely reversible.},

   abstract = {BACKGROUND: Anti-Saccharomyces cerevisiae and perinuclear anti-neutrophil cytoplasmic autoantibodies are markers of Crohn's disease and ulcerative colitis respectively. AIM: To determine the prevalence of anti-S. cerevisiae and perinuclear anti-neutrophil cytoplasmic autoantibodies in a large series of coeliac disease patients before and after gluten free diet, and to correlate anti-S. cerevisiae-positivity with intestinal mucosal damage. METHODS: One hundred and five consecutive coeliac disease patients and 141 controls (22 ulcerative colitis, 24 Crohn's disease, 30 primary sclerosing cholangitis, 15 postenteritis syndrome, 50 blood donors) were tested for anti-S. cerevisiae by enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay and for perinuclear anti-neutrophil cytoplasmic autoantibodies by indirect immunofluorescence. RESULTS: In coeliac disease anti-S. cerevisiae (immunoglobulin G and/or immunoglobulin A) were slightly less frequent (59%) than in Crohn's disease (75%, P = 0.16) and significantly more frequent than in ulcerative colitis (27%), primary sclerosing cholangitis (30%), postenteritis syndrome (26%) and blood donors (4%) (P = 0.009, P = 0.0002, P = 0.025, P < 0.0001). No correlation was found between anti-S. cerevisiae and degree of mucosal damage. Perinuclear anti-neutrophil cytoplasmic autoantibodies were detected only in one coeliac. After gluten free diet the disappearance of anti-S. cerevisiae-immunoglobulin A (93%) was more frequent than that of immunoglobulin G (17%, P = 0.0001); perinuclear anti-neutrophil cytoplasmic autoantibodies disappeared in the only coeliac positive at diagnosis. CONCLUSION: More than half of untreated coeliacs are anti-S. cerevisiae-positive irrespective of the severity of mucosal damage. Differently from immunoglobulin A, anti-S. cerevisiae-immunoglobulin G persisted in more than 80% after gluten free diet. The high prevalence of anti-S. cerevisiae in coeliac disease suggests that they may be the effect of a non-specific immune response in course of chronic small bowel disease.},

   abstract = {Celiac disease is an autoimmune disease that occurs in genetically predisposed individuals as the result of an immune response to gluten. This immune response occurs in both the lamina propria and the epithelium of the small intestine. There is a close link to HLA DQ2 and DQ8, although these HLA genes account for only 40% of the genetic influence. Environmental factors, such as the amount and timing of gluten administration in infancy, as well as breastfeeding, influence the disease. Serologic screening studies that use sensitive and specific antibody tests have revealed the disease to be common, occurring in approximately 1% of the population. Clinical presentations are diverse and atypical; the majority of patients lack diarrhea. Therapy is a gluten-free diet that requires avoidance of wheat, rye, and barley, although there is potential for other therapies based on our understanding of the pathophysiology of the disease.},

Serologic testing has become the main mode of determining who will undergo biopsy. The IgA endomysial antibody and IgA tissue transglutaminase antibody have approximately 90% sensitivity and specificity, though there are reports of lower sensitivity and specificity in the clinical practice setting. This is due to lower titers of these antibodies in the presence of lesser degrees of mucosal damage. The widespread availability of serologic tests for coeliac disease allows the diagnosis to be considered by any physician. Gastroenterologists will be required to interpret the results of serologic tests and perform duodenal biopsies when indicated. Pathologists likewise need to be better acquainted with the more subtle changes of cell mediated immunity within the mucosa that are suggestive of underlying gluten sensitivity.},

It uses a study that examined the management of food and diet in families where one member had been diagnosed with one of two medical conditions: coronary heart disease (CHD) and coeliac disease (CD). The data revealed a propensity for family members, especially female partners/wives, to see the tasks and activities related to the special diet in terms of family practices rather than individual (patients') responsibilities. These family practices could be seen to be gendered but also part of the ongoing lived experience of the family relationship. It is speculated that this is part of a desire for what Giddens has described as 'ontological security'. Thus, the special diet tends to be assimilated into family practices in ways that promote a sense of continuity that is described as 'normality' or 'leading a normal life'.},

   abstract = {UNLABELLED: During the last few years we have been observing the decreasing incidence of the symptomatic celiac disease and increasing incidence of mono- and asymptomatic disease. Various atypical symptoms and extraintestinal manifestations were observed in older children (above 7 years) and in adults. Clinical symptoms of celiac disease may appear at any age, in each of the following forms: clinical celiac disease (symptomatic), silent (oligosymptomatic) or latent, with late manifestation, being the effect of stress, pregnancy, infections or excessive dietary gluten provocation. THE AIM OF THE STUDY: The presentation the variety of clinical pictures of celiac disease in children. MATERIALS AND METHODS: We have evaluated the clinical course of celiac disease in 16 children (13 girls and 3 boys), aged between 12 months to 17 years (mean-7,5 years). The celiac disease was diagnosed on the grounds of clinical symptoms, histopathological examination of the small intestinal endoscopic biopsy and immunological examinations: serum antitransglutaminase antibodies and anti-endomysium antibodies. RESULTS: Most commonly diagnosed form was the silent, monosymptomatic celiac disease. Four children manifested with growth retardation, one with osteoporosis, and one with iron deficiency anemia resistant to treatment. Two girls (aged 16 and 17 years) presented with symptomatic celiac disease. In 3 patients despite the gastrointestinal symptoms and histopathological changes present (villous atrophy, Marsh's index > 40) we did not find any immunological markers of celiac disease (with normal IgA levels). CONCLUSIONS: School-aged children with celiac disease, in many cases have no evident clinical and functional disorders caused by gluten intake, despite to presence of considerable abnormalities in the histopathological examination.},

METHODS: Nutritional status was assessed by serum tests and anthropometric measures in 26 subjects (16 to 25 years of age) with biopsy-proven CD and 29 healthy control subjects (16 to 21 years of age) with negative tissue transglutaminase antibodies (16 to 22 years of age); all the subjects were selected from the cohort of 3654 schoolchildren. RESULTS: Compared with control subjects, CD patients had lower median values of whole blood folic acid (91 versus 109 nmol/L; P = 0.01), serum ferritin (14 versus 27 microg/L; P = 0.028) and pre-albumin (0.21 versus 0.28 g/L; P </= 0.001) and higher transferrin receptor (1.3 versus 1.1; P = 0.008) and serum transferrin receptor-ferritin index (1.2 versus 0.7; P = 0.006). Folic acid concentration was subnormal in 31% of the CD subjects (versus 14% of the controls) and iron status (transferrin receptor-ferritin index) was subnormal in 30% (versus 14%). Body mass index was not different in females of the CD and control groups (22 versus 22 kg/m2) or in the males of the respective groups (25 versus 24 kg/m2). Females with CD were shorter than the controls (mean 162 versus 167 cm; P = 0.018), but no difference was found in males. No association was found between the nutritional status and the markers of mucosal injury (villous-crypt measures), but titer of transglutaminase was associated with whole blood folic acid (r = -0.5; P = 0.016) and with transferrin receptor-ferritin index (r = 0.4, P = 0.05). CONCLUSIONS: One third of screen-detected adolescent CD subjects have abnormalities in folate or iron status that call for early diagnosis and dietary treatment of the disease to prevent nutritional deficiencies.},

A computerised literature review of multiple databases was carried out, identifying 17 primary studies, 6 of which met the criteria for inclusion in this review. None of the six studies found any significant difference in the serology between the oats and control groups. Two studies, however, identified a significant difference (p<0.001; p = 0.039) in intraepithelial lymphocyte counts between the oats and control groups. Oats can be symptomatically tolerated by most patients with coeliac disease; however, the long-term effects of a diet containing oats remain unknown. Patients with coeliac disease wishing to consume a diet containing oats should therefore receive regular follow-up, including small bowel biopsy at a specialist clinic for life.},

RESEARCH DESIGN AND METHODS: In a region comprising 24% of the Danish population, all patients <16 years old with type 1 diabetes were identified and 269 (89%) were included in the study. The diagnosis of celiac disease was suspected in patients with endomysium and tissue transglutaminase antibodies in serum and confirmed by intestinal biopsy. Patients with celiac disease were followed for 2 years while consuming a GFD. RESULTS: In 28 of 33 patients with celiac antibodies, an intestinal biopsy showed villous atrophy. In 5 patients, celiac disease had been diagnosed previously, giving an overall prevalence of 12.3% (95% CI 8.6-16.9). Patients with celiac disease had a lower SD score (SDS) for height (P < 0.001) and weight (P = 0.002) than patients without celiac disease and were significantly younger at diabetes onset (P = 0.041). A GFD was obtained in 31 of 33 patients. After 2 years of follow-up, there was an increase in weight SDS (P = 0.006) and in children <14 years old an increase in height SDS (P = 0.036). An increase in hemoglobin (P = 0.002) and serum ferritin (P = 0.020) was found, whereas HbA(1c) remained unchanged (P = 0.311) during follow-up. CONCLUSIONS: This population-based study showed the highest reported prevalence of celiac disease in type 1 diabetes in Europe. Patients with celiac disease showed clinical improvements with a GFD. We recommend screening for celiac disease in all children with type 1 diabetes.},

At 52 years of age, the patient increasingly suffered from fatigue and exertional dyspnoea and had intermittent abdominal pain, distension and rumbling. Biopsies of the small intestine revealed crypt hypertrophy and intraepithelial lymphocytosis: signs ofcoeliac disease. The symptoms disappeared when the patient started to use a gluten-free diet. The haemoglobin level also normalised. Coeliac disease must be considered in the differential diagnosis of iron-deficiency anaemia.},

Intravenous calcium infusion increased the calcium level and led to resolution of hypocalcemia-induced signs but there was no result when calcium and vitamin D were taken orally. The diagnosis of malabsorption was very probable in light of the family history of celiac disease, the anemia and the hypoalbuminemia. The diagnosis was confirmed by antibodies assay and endoscopy. The PTH level was less than 1 pg/l and radiography showed signs of hyperparathyroidism. Gluten-free diet, calcium and vitamin D led to an improvement of serum calcium.},

   abstract = {OBJECTIVE: No national survey on the present clinical spectrum and health-related quality of life (HRQOL) in people with coeliac disease has been conducted in Germany until now. METHODS: The German Coeliac Society DZG posted a set of questionnaires (self-developed socio-demographic and medical questionnaire, the Short Form Health Survey, the Hospital Anxiety and Depression Scale and the Giessen Symptom Check List) to 1000/18 355 of their members who were >/=18 years (every 18th member following consecutive postal codes of the membership directory). RESULTS: Four hundred and forty-six usable questionnaires were returned (diagnosis proven by biopsy; 78% female, median age 45.5 years). The median interval between the first medical examination due to symptoms of coeliac disease and the final diagnosis was 1 year. Ninety-eight percent reported a reduction of initial symptoms, 85% an improvement of HRQOL with a median gain in weight of 8 kg after starting a gluten-free diet (median duration of 6 years). Sixty-seven percent adhered all the time to the dietary regimen and 26% adhered most of the time. The most frequent diseases associated with coeliac disease were osteoporosis (15%), oral aphtae (12%) and dermatitis herpetiformis (9%). Because of the presence of gastrointestinal symptoms 26% of the patients met the modified Rome I criteria for irritable bowel symptom. Compared to representative samples from the German population, coeliac disease patients had higher scores for anxiety , fatigue, dyspeptic and musculoskeletal pain, and a reduced HRQOL in 9/10 scales of the SF-36 (all P<0.001). CONCLUSION: Despite being on a gluten-free diet German coeliac disease patients suffer from a high burden of general and extra-intestinal symptoms and a reduced HRQOL.},

   abstract = {Celiac disease, or gluten-sensitive enteropathy, is an immune-mediated disease of the small bowel that results in malabsorption. It classically presents with gastrointestinal symptoms including chronic diarrhea, weight loss, abdominal bloating and anorexia. It is becoming more frequently identified in asymptomatic patients with a diagnosis of deficiencies related to malabsorption of iron, folic acid, vitamin B12 and vitamin D. It is increasingly identified as a cause for early or refractory osteoporosis. Occasionally, celiac disease presents with cutaneous manifestations alone. Dermatitis herpetiformis is a well-recognized cutaneous manifestation of celiac disease. Other cutaneous manifestations include alopecia, angular stomatitis and aphthous ulcerations. Described here is a case of a 24-year-old woman who presented with intermittent urticaria and gastrointestinal complaints. She was found to have celiac disease on small-bowel biopsy. Both her gastrointestinal symptoms and urticaria resolved when she was put on a gluten-free diet, suggesting that her urticaria was a cutaneous manifestation of celiac disease.},

   abstract = {Celiac disease develops from an autoimmune response to specific dietary grains that contain gluten. Diagnosis can be made based on the classical presentation of diarrhea, fatty stools, and abdominal bloating and cramping, as well as the presence of specific serum antibodies. In addition, gluten ingestion has increasingly been found to be associated with other conditions not usually correlated with gluten intolerance. The subsequent diversity of the clinical presentation in these cases can complicate decision-making and delay treatment initiation in conditions such as ataxia, headaches, arthritis, neuropathy, type 1 diabetes mellitus, and others. This review explores the etiology and pathology of celiac disease, presents support for the relationship between gluten and other diseases, and provides effective screening and treatment protocols.},

Other presentations include iron-deficiency anemia, osteoporosis, dermatitis herpetiforme, and neurologic disorders, mainly peripheral neuropathy and ataxia. Arthritis is commonly found in patients with celiac disease when systematically sought. Overall, autoimmune diseases occur more frequently (three to ten times more) in those with celiac disease than in the general population. A gluten-free diet is the standard of treatment, although its effect on some of the extraintestinal manifestations remains to be determined.},

   abstract = {BACKGROUND: The risk for lymphoma is increased in both dermatitis herpetiformis (DH) and in coeliac disease. The lymphoma most associated with coeliac disease is enteropathy-associated T-cell lymphoma. OBJECTIVES: To study the occurrence and type of lymphoma in a large series of patients with DH and their first-degree relatives. METHODS: The occurrence of lymphoma was studied in 1104 patients consecutively diagnosed with DH in two university hospitals during 1969-2001. A questionnaire was sent to 341 patients to examine the occurrence of lymphoma in their 1825 first-degree relatives. To analyse whether the DH patients with lymphoma had adhered to a gluten-free diet similarly to the patients without lymphoma, two age- and sex-matched patients with DH served as controls for each index case. Data on the gluten-free diet were collected from prospectively completed dietary forms and also from medical records. RESULTS: Eleven (1%) patients contracted lymphoma 2-31 years after the diagnosis of DH. Eight had B-cell-type lymphoma, two enteropathy-associated T-cell lymphoma and one remained unclassified due to missing material. Three (0.2%) of the first-degree relatives contracted lymphoma, all B-cell type. The 11 DH patients with lymphoma had adhered to a gluten-free diet significantly less strictly than the DH controls without lymphoma. CONCLUSIONS: The present study documents that patients with DH can have both B- and T-cell lymphoma. The DH patients with lymphoma had not adhered as strictly to the gluten-free diet as the control patients without lymphoma. The occurrence of lymphoma in the first-degree relatives was lower than in the patients with DH.},

   abstract = {Celiac disease (CD) is a common condition that occurs in genetically predisposed individuals when they ingest products containing wheat, barley, or rye. It produces an autoimmune-mediated enteropathy with characteristic histologic features on small intestinal mucosal biopsy. The clinical manifestations of CD are highly variable and initially may be unrelated to the gastrointestinal system. The condition is also strongly associated with other autoimmune and nonautoimmune conditions. Physicians caring for children and adolescents are challenged with identifying those who might have CD and require referral for definitive testing, recognizing the potential pitfalls in the diagnostic work-up of the pediatric patient, and providing ongoing care for those with a positive diagnosis. Confirmation of the diagnosis mandates that the individual be placed on a strict gluten-free diet (GFD) for life, as this is the only treatment currently available for CD. This article will discuss the immunopathogenesis, epidemiology, and clinical manifestations of CD and will outline a strategy of active case-finding using serological tests to identify those who require an intestinal biopsy for definitive diagnosis. The need for lifelong treatment by means of a GFD and for continued follow-up of children and adolescents after diagnosis is emphasized.},

The Celiac Disease Guideline Committee of the North American Society for Pediatric Gastroenterology, Hepatology and Nutrition has formulated a clinical practice guideline for the diagnosis and treatment of pediatric celiac disease based on an integration of a systematic review of the medical literature combined with expert opinion. The Committee examined the indications for testing, the value of serological tests, human leukocyte antigen (HLA) typing and histopathology and the treatment and monitoring of children with celiac disease. It is recommended that children and adolescents with symptoms of celiac disease or an increased risk for celiac disease have a blood test for antibody to tissue transglutaminase (TTG), that those with an elevated TTG be referred to a pediatric gastroenterologist for an intestinal biopsy and that those with the characteristics of celiac disease on intestinal histopathology be treated with a strict gluten-free diet.

   abstract = {For both wheat allergy and coeliac disease the dietary avoidance of wheat and other gluten-containing cereals is the only effective treatment. Estimation of the maximum tolerated amount of gluten for susceptible individuals would support effective management of their disease. Literature was reviewed to evaluate whether an upper limit for gluten content in food, which would be safe for sufferers from both diseases, could be identified. When setting gluten limits for coeliac disease sufferers, the overall potential daily intake should be considered, while for wheat allergy limits should be based on single servings. For coeliac disease sufferers this limit should lie between 10 and 100 mg daily intake. For wheat allergy, lowest eliciting doses for children lie in the lower milligram range, while for adults they are most significantly higher. Gliadins (part of the gluten proteins) not only trigger coeliac disease, but are also major allergens in wheat allergy. Therefore, measurement of gliadins with validated enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay methods provides an appropriate marker for assessing gluten and/or wheat protein contents in food. Available data suggest that a maximum gluten content for 'gluten-free' foods could be set, which protects both wheat allergy sufferers and coeliac patients.},

   abstract = {OBJECTIVE: Although in both adults and children with coeliac disease (CD) it is now recommended that oats be added to their gluten-free diet, there is still some controversy concerning the possible harmful effects of oats in some individuals. In this study concentrations of nitric oxide metabolites were repeatedly measured in the urine of children under investigation for CD, when on a gluten-free diet with or without oats. MATERIAL AND METHODS: The study included 116 children, randomized to a standard gluten-free diet (GFD-std) or a gluten-free diet supplemented with wheat-free oat products (GFD-oats), over a one-year period. Small-bowel biopsy was performed at the beginning and end of the study. Morning urine samples were collected from 87 children and urinary nitrite/nitrate concentrations were monitored at 0, 3, 6, 9 and 12 months. RESULTS: All patients were in clinical remission after the study period. There was a rapid decline in urinary nitrite/nitrate concentrations in both groups as early as after 3 months. No differences were seen between the study groups at any of the checkpoints. However, at the end of the study, the nitrite/nitrate values of 9 children in the GFD-oats group and 8 children in the GFD-std group had not normalized. CONCLUSIONS: Children with CD on a gluten-free diet with oats display a similar reduction in urinary nitrite/nitrate as those on a traditional gluten-free diet. Some children, however, still demonstrate high nitrite/nitrate excretion after one year on either diet, indicating that long-term follow-up studies of children on an oats-containing diet are needed.},

   abstract = {OBJECTIVE: Recent studies report negligible toxicity of oats in the majority of coeliac disease (CD) patients. It has previously been shown that children with untreated CD have circulating antibodies to oats avenin. In this study we performed serial assessments of anti-avenin antibodies in children under investigation for CD on a gluten-free diet with or without oats. MATERIAL AND METHODS: The study involved 116 children, randomized to a standard gluten-free diet or a gluten-free diet supplemented with oats. Sera were obtained from 86 children, 48 in the standard gluten-free group and 38 in the gluten-free oats group, of which 33 consumed at least 10 g of oats daily. IgA and IgG anti-avenin antibodies were monitored at 0, 3, 6 and 12 months. Nitric oxide metabolites were measured in 7 patients, with deviating antibody results. RESULTS: There was a significant decrease in anti-avenin antibodies in both groups at the end as compared to the beginning of the study, (p<0.001), but no difference was found between the two groups. IgA titres already declined after 3 months. IgG titres, although significantly decreased, remained high in the majority of patients in both groups. Nitric oxide levels were high in four of the analysed samples. CONCLUSIONS: Oats per se, do not seem to produce a humoral immune reaction in children with CD when given in an otherwise gluten-free diet, indicating that the reaction requires gluten challenge. Anti-avenin antibodies were equal in the two study groups, and these findings strengthen the clinical impression that oats can be tolerated by the majority of patients with CD.},

   abstract = {BACKGROUND: The exclusion of oats from the diet in coeliac disease is controversial. AIM: To study the long-term safety of oats in the treatment of children with coeliac disease. METHODS: Altogether 32 children with coeliac disease were enrolled in a 2-year controlled trial. Twenty-three children in remission were randomized either to oats or gluten challenge; when small bowel histological relapse was evident after gluten challenge, a gluten-free diet including oats was started. Furthermore, nine newly detected coeliac patients adopted an oat-containing gluten-free diet. Small bowel mucosal morphology, CD3+, alphabeta+ and gammadelta+ intraepithelial lymphocytes, human leucocyte antigen (HLA) DR expression and coeliac serology were determined. After the trial, the children were allowed to eat oats freely; follow-up was extended up to 7 years. RESULTS: In coeliac children in remission, oats had no detrimental effect on intestinal histology or serology during the 2-year trial. In contrast, the gluten-challenge group relapsed after 3-12 months. Complete recovery from the disease was accomplished in all relapsed and newly detected patients on an oat-containing gluten-free diet. After the trial, 86% of the children preferred to consume oats and they all remained in remission. CONCLUSION: In most children with coeliac disease, long-term consumption of oats is well tolerated, and it does not result in small bowel mucosal deterioration or immune activation.},

   abstract = {In spite of modern diagnostic possibilities, the diagnosis of celiac disease is still challenging for the physician. This is due to the great variability of the clinical presentation. Nowadays, the classical symptoms like diarrhea, weight loss and abdominal pain are seen less often. It has become evident that celiac disease is not merely a disease of the intestine but of the entire organism. Furthermore, extraintestinal manifestations can present without any gastrointestinal symptoms. It is likely that in many cases the immune system and not nutrient deficiencies play a major role. In addition, the diagnostic tests are not always unequivocal. There is a great variability of the small intestinal changes which are sometimes in contradiction to the antibody results. Since celiac disease implies a lifelong gluten-free diet, a firm diagnosis should be obtained. Thus, one should not rely on a single test but should rather consider serology, histology and clinical response altogether.},

However, in rare cases complications like refractory sprue or lymphoma can occur. Individual management is required since the clinical presentation of celiac disease can be very heterogeneous. For example, it is a matter of controversy if asymptomatic patients, who have the same typical histological changes in their small bowel like patients with symptomatic celiac disease, should adhere to a gluten-free diet. A major problem is the compliance and the unintentional intake of gluten. A 100 % gluten-free diet is not possible since most food components are contaminated with trace amounts of gluten. Fortunately most patients tolerate these contaminations. Furthermore, the threshold for gluten contamination can differ highly among patients. One central point in patient care is the monitoring of a gluten-free diet and the timely recognition of complications. Therefore, the role of antibodies and duodenal histology in monitoring the course of the disease will be discussed.},

   abstract = {Celiac disease is a chronic intestinal disease caused by intolerance to gluten. It is characterized by immune-mediated enteropathy, associated with maldigestion and malabsorption of most nutrients and vitamins. In predisposed individuals, the ingestion of gluten-containing food such as wheat and rye induces a flat jejunal mucosa with infiltration of lymphocytes. The main symptoms are: stomach pain, gas, and bloating, diarrhea, weight loss, anemia, edema, bone or joint pain. Prevalence for clinically overt celiac disease varies from 1:270 in Finland to 1:5000 in North America. Since celiac disease can be asymptomatic, most subjects are not diagnosed or they can present with atypical symptoms. Furthermore, severe inflammation of the small bowel can be present without any gastrointestinal symptoms. The diagnosis should be made early since celiac disease causes growth retardation in untreated children and atypical symptoms like infertility or neurological symptoms. Diagnosis requires endoscopy with jejunal biopsy. In addition, tissue-transglutaminase antibodies are important to confirm the diagnosis since there are other diseases which can mimic celiac disease. The exact cause of celiac disease is unknown but is thought to be primarily immune mediated (tissue-transglutaminase autoantigen); often the disease is inherited. Management consists in life long withdrawal of dietary gluten, which leads to significant clinical and histological improvement. However, complete normalization of histology can take years.},

In The Netherlands, no nutritional information is available. Therefore, we evaluated the nutritional management and nutritional state in young celiac patients. METHODS: The Dutch Celiac Society invited all its members aged 12 to 25 years to complete a food record and a questionnaire. Nutrient intakes were compared with the recommendations and the intake in the general population. Total immunoglobin A, endomysial antibody, tissue transglutaminase and IgA gliadin were determined, and height and weight were assessed. RESULTS: Strict dietary compliance was reported by 75%. The fiber and iron intakes were significantly lower, and the saturated fat intake significantly higher than recommended but comparable with the general population. Most of the patients (61%) found the diet easy to follow. Regular medical controls were reported by 86% but regular dietary controls by only 7% of the patients. Mean and SD scores for height and body mass index were -0.3 +/- 1.1 and -0.3 +/- 0.8, respectively. CONCLUSIONS: The dietary compliance in this group is high, the nutritional state is adequate, but the nutrient intake is not. Better medical and dietary support is necessary to prevent long-term complications and to achieve an ongoing satisfying management in this group of young patients with a chronic disorder.},

   abstract = {INTRODUCTION: Coeliac disease causes histological changes throughout the small bowel, but is often a proximal lesion. We wanted to assess whether terminal ileal histological abnormalities occurred more commonly in patients with coeliac disease and if specific assessment of intraepithelial lymphocytes increases the recognition of undiagnosed coeliac disease. METHODS: Terminal ileal biopsies were prospectively examined over a 3-year period (April 2001-May 2004). Patients were included if they were found to have a synchronous duodenal biopsy that gave a new diagnosis of coeliac disease (n=20). Terminal ileal biopsies taken at colonoscopy during the same period were also examined from four groups of patients: coeliac disease established on a gluten-free diet but with persisting symptoms (n=25), inflammatory bowel disease (n=47), chronic diarrhoea (n=44) and polyp surveillance (n=47). All biopsies were graded according to the Marsh criteria and an intraepithelial lymphocytes count per 100 enterocytes was obtained. RESULTS: There was only one patient from all five groups who had villous atrophy of the terminal ileal. This patient had a new diagnosis of coeliac disease. The mean intraepithelial lymphocytes count in the coeliac disease group was 23.7 intraepithelial lymphocytes/100 enterocytes. This was significantly higher than the control groups: coeliac disease on a gluten-free diet=17.5 (p<0.012), inflammatory bowel disease=12.3 (p<0.0001), diarrhoea=12.6 (p<0.0001) and polyp=13.7 (p<0.0002). Validating terminal ileal villous intraepithelial lymphocytes counts as a test for coeliac disease using an intraepithelial lymphocytes/100 enterocytes of >25 gives a sensitivity of 45% and a specificity of 97.8%. CONCLUSION: Routinely quantifying terminal ileal intraepithelial lymphocytes may be of limited clinical value. However, subjective recognition of raised intraepithelial lymphocytes on a terminal ileal biopsy should alert the clinician to the possibility of coeliac disease.},

   abstract = {BACKGROUND: Colonoscopy may be indicated in patients with coeliac disease who present with iron deficiency anaemia or in coeliac disease patients who have persisting diarrhoea despite being on a gluten-free diet. However, there are limited data to support this approach. METHODS: We prospectively recruited patients who were found to have coeliac disease, having been referred with newly diagnosed iron deficiency anaemia. We also recruited a second group of patients with known coeliac disease. These patients had persisting diarrhoea despite being on a gluten-free diet for 6 months. All patients had colonoscopy and were matched with controls (without coeliac disease) who had similar indications for colonoscopy. RESULTS: Ninety-eight consecutive new patients with coeliac disease and concurrent iron deficiency anaemia had colonoscopy performed. Twelve (12.2%) had pathology, three of which were carcinomas. This diagnostic yield was not significantly different from the findings in the control group 62/362 (17.1%) P=0.24. In coeliac disease patients with persisting diarrhoea (n=37), the diagnostic yield at colonoscopy was 1/37 (2.7%). This was significantly lower than our findings in the control group with chronic diarrhoea 55/390 (14%) P=0.05. CONCLUSION: Colonoscopy should be considered in patients with coeliac disease (over the age of 45 years) who present with iron deficiency anaemia. Whilst, for coeliac disease patients with persisting diarrhoea (on a gluten-free diet) in the absence of sinister symptoms, a flexible sigmoidoscopy may be the initial investigation in order to exclude microscopic colitis. However, further larger prospective studies are required to evaluate this approach.},

RECENT FINDINGS: Despite dropping prevalence rates in developed nations, most new Helicobacter pylori infections are primarily acquired during childhood. Resistance to standard triple therapy and falling eradication rates are increasing problems for clinicians, necessitating the study of alternative treatment strategies. Eosinophilic diseases of the gastrointestinal tract are being increasingly recognized. Although population-based epidemiology and the natural history of eosinophilic diseases are not yet fully characterized, biologic therapies are in development for the treatment of these chronic, often refractory, conditions. A recent US National Institutes of Health celiac disease consensus conference suggested that infants' diet constituents and timing of solid food introduction are potential environmental influences in the development of celiac disease. SUMMARY: New methods of diagnosis and treatment are greatly impacting care of pediatric patients with gastric and duodenal diseases. Less invasive but highly accurate tools for diagnosis are becoming better validated. Early diagnosis and effective intervention in most gastroduodenal disorders of childhood can alter natural history and improve overall quality of life.},

The aim of the study was determination of the amino acid concentrations in coeliacs on gluten-free diet and gluten-containing diet. MATERIAL AND METHODS: 61 patients with coeliac disease were studied. Whole blood citrulline were determined in dried blood spots by tandem mass spectrometry. One-way analysis of variance and the Bonferroni post hoc test for multiple comparisons were used to determine differences among groups under study. RESULTS: Mean citrulline levels were higher in patients on strict gluten-free diet comparing to those newly diagnosed (32.2 +/- 8.7 vs. 24.9 +/- 5.7 micromol/l; p = 0.025). CONCLUSION: Whole blood citrulline concentration may be a simple biochemical marker for diagnosis and monitoring enterocyte loss in coeliac disease.},

She had a 3-year history of fecal incontinence, which had increased in frequency and severity in the year before her most recent presentation. Prior diagnostic workup included anorectal manometry, revealing global sphincter dysfunction, which improved slightly with biofeedback therapy, and colonoscopy, which proved unremarkable. At the time of referral, the patient was taking loperamide 2mg once daily. INVESTIGATIONS: Physical examination, fecal fat stain, abdominal CT scan, therapeutic trial of pancreatic enzymes, celiac disease serologic tests, and upper endoscopy with small-bowel biopsy. DIAGNOSIS: Celiac disease. MANAGEMENT: Gluten-free diet.},

   abstract = {Regulatory T cells are induced by oral administration of an antigen, but the physiological requirements and localization of the inductive sites are largely unknown. Using an adoptive transfer system of cells transgenic for ovalbumin T-cell receptor (OVA TCR tg), we found that antigen-specific CD4+ T cells were activated in the liver-draining celiac lymph node (CLN) shortly after ovalbumin feeding, and that a significantly higher proportion of the T cells in the CLN developed into the putative regulatory phenotype [co-expressing CD25 with the glucocortico-induced tumour necrosis factor (TNF) receptor family related gene (GITR), cytotoxic T-lymphocyte antigen (CTLA)-4 and CD103] than in Peyer's patches, the mesenteric and peripheral lymph nodes and the spleen. In addition, a particularly high level of expression of CD103 on the OVA-specific T cells in the CLN may favour homing to the epithelium of the intestine. While equally suppressive, OVA tg T cells isolated from the CLN of OVA-fed DO11.10 mice were less dependent on transforming growth factor (TGF)-beta for suppression than cells isolated from the peripheral and mesenteric lymph nodes, which indicates the involvement of an additional suppressive mechanism. The expression of FoxP3 was not up-regulated in any of the lymph node compartments studied. Our phenotypic and functional findings suggest that the induction of regulatory T cells in the CLN may be relevant in the control of the immune response to dietary antigens.},

   abstract = {Gluten sensitivity with or without coeliac disease (CD) symptoms and intestinal pathology has been suggested as a potentially treatable cause of various diseases. CD is a chronic disease which improves on withdrawal of wheat gliadins and barley, rye and oat prolamins from the diet. There have been numerous reports linking CD with several skin conditions. A body of evidence shows that dermatitis herpetiformis is actually a cutaneous manifestation of CD. Autoimmune diseases, allergic diseases, psoriasis and miscellaneous diseases have also been described with gluten intolerance. Dermatologists should be familiar with the appraisal of gluten sensitive enteropathy and should be able to search for an underlying gluten intolerance (GI). Serological screening by means of antigliadin, antiendomysial and transglutaminase antibodies should be performed. HLA typing is often useful in association with serologic tests. Intestinal biopsy is usually needed to establish the diagnosis of CD or GI. Thus, gluten intolerance gives rise to a variety of dermatological manifestations which may benefit from a gluten-free diet.},

   abstract = {Coeliac disease is a common enteropathy with a strong inherited risk characterised by dietary wheat, rye and barley induced T-cell activation. Although there is replicated linkage to 2q33, results are inconsistent from association studies of the most promising candidate genes: the CD28/CTLA4/ICOS cluster. CTLA4 plays a key role in regulating T lymphocyte mediated inflammatory responses, and variants in the 3' region influence development of diabetes and thyroid disease. We genotyped CTLA4 variants (-1722 C/T, -658 T/C, -318 C/T, +49 A/G, +1822 C/T, CT60 A/G) to tag all common haplotypes (>5% frequency) and an ICOS variant (IVS+173 C/T) in 340 white UK Caucasian coeliac disease cases. Strict ascertainment criteria for coeliac cases required both villous atrophy at diagnosis and positive serology. In total, 973 healthy controls were available for SNP, and 705 for CTLA4 haplotype, based association analyses. Coeliac disease showed weak association with the CTLA4 +1822T (P=0.019) and CT60 G (P=0.047) alleles. Strong association was seen with a common CTLA4 haplotype (P=0.00067, odds ratio 1.41) of frequency 32.7% in coeliac disease and 25.5% in healthy controls. A common CTLA4 haplotype shows strong association with coeliac disease, and contains multiple alleles reported to affect immunological function. Loss of tolerance to dietary antigens in coeliac disease may be mediated in part by heritable variants in co-signalling genes regulating T-cell responses.},

   abstract = {BACKGROUND AND AIMS: Development of coeliac disease involves an interaction between environmental factors (especially dietary wheat, rye, and barley antigens) and genetic factors (there is strong inherited disease susceptibility). The known human leucocyte antigen (HLA)-DQ2 and -DQ8 association explains only a minority of disease heritability. A recent study in the Dutch population suggested that genetic variation in the 3' region of myosin IXB (MYO9B) predisposes to coeliac disease. MYO9B is a Rho family GTPase activating protein involved in epithelial cell cytoskeletal organisation. MYO9B is hypothesised to influence intestinal permeability and hence intestinal antigen presentation. METHODS: Four single nucleotide polymorphisms were chosen to tag all common haplotypes of the MYO9B 3' haplotype block (exons 15-27). We genotyped 375 coeliac disease cases and 1366 controls (371 healthy and 995 population based). All individuals were of White UK Caucasian ethnicity. RESULTS: UK healthy control and population control allele frequencies were similar for all MYO9B variants. Case control analysis showed no significant association of any variant or haplotype with coeliac disease. CONCLUSIONS: Genetic variation in MYO9B does not have a major effect on coeliac disease susceptibility in the UK population. Differences between populations, a weaker effect size than originally described, or possibly a type I error in the Dutch study might explain these findings.},

   abstract = {OBJECTIVE: Gluten sensitivity is associated with multiple neurological abnormalities including gluten ataxia, motor neuron disease-like neuropathy, small fiber type neuropathy, cognitive impairment, and even parkinsonism. We investigated whether or not gluten sensitivity is involved in Japanese patients with idiopathic cerebellar ataxia with extracerebellar presentation. PATIENTS OR MATERIALS: Fourteen patients with idiopathic cerebellar ataxia with extracerebellar presentation (autonomic instability, parkinsonism, or pyramidal dysfunction in varying combinations) were screened for anti-gliadin antibodies (AGA) to analyze for the presence or absence of gluten sensitivity. Patients with typical MR findings of multiple system atrophy of the cerebellar type were excluded. As disease controls without cerebellar ataxia, 9 patients with Parkinson's disease and 18 patients with amyotrophic lateral sclerosis were screened for AGA. Forty-seven normal controls were also screened for AGA. RESULTS: We found a high prevalence of AGA in 5 (36%) of 14 cerebellar ataxia patients, but in only 1 (4%) of 27 disease controls without cerebellar ataxia (odds ratio, 14.4; 95% CI, 1.41147; p<0.05) and in only 1 (2%) of 47 normal controls (odds ratio, 25.6; 95% CI, 2.66246; p<0.001). Among the cerebellar ataxia patients, atypical features such as sensorimotor neuropathy and/or mild cognitive impairment were more prevalent in the AGA-positive group (60%) than in the AGA-negative group (0%). In one of the ataxic patients with AGA, a gluten-free diet had positive effects on neurological symptoms and nutritional status. CONCLUSION: Gluten sensitivity is involved in at least some of the unexplained neurological symptoms of Japanese patients with adult-onset, sporadic cerebellar ataxia.},

   abstract = {BACKGROUND: Celiac disease (CD) may be missed or diagnosed late in children with chronic diarrhea. In this study the authors estimated the frequency of CD among pediatric patients with chronic diarrhea based on serologic and pathologic examinations. METHODS: During a 6-year period, all patients with chronic diarrhea of more than 6 weeks referred to the authors' department were included. For each patient, an asymptomatic control was enrolled from among the patients referred to our clinic for other reasons. Serologic tests for CD including immunoglobulin A endomysial antibody and immunoglobulin A antigliadin antibody were performed in all patients and controls. If positive, duodenal biopsy was performed to confirm the diagnosis. Patients subsequently diagnosed as CD were placed on a gluten-free diet and reevaluated after 6 months. RESULTS: 825 cases of diarrhea and 825 controls were enrolled. CD was diagnosed in 54 (6.5%) of the diarrhea patients and seven (0.8%) of the controls. After 6 months of gluten-free diet, 48 (88.8%) patients had significant improvement in symptoms and of these 41 (76.1%) were totally asymptomatic. Forty-two patients allowed repeat endoscopy after 6 months of gluten-free diet and 40 (95.2%) showed improvement in histologic findings. CONCLUSION: CD is common among patients labeled as chronic diarrhea. In this subgroup, gluten-free diet may lead to a significant improvement in symptoms. Routine testing for CD may be indicated in all patients being evaluated for chronic diarrhea.},

   abstract = {INTRODUCTION: Coeliac disease (CD) is usually associated with impaired growth in children. A gluten-free diet (GFD) induces a catch-up growth with the recovery of height in about 2 years. AIM AND DISCUSSION: The lack of the height improvement has been related to growth hormone (GH) secretion impairment. CD is an autoimmune disease often associated with other endocrine and non-endocrine autoimmune disease. The aim of this study was to evaluate antipituitary autoantibodies (APA) and antihypothalamus autoantibodies in CD children with poor clinical response to a GFD and growth hormone deficiency (GHD). We diagnosed CD on the basis of specific antibodies and endoscopic biopsies in 130 patients aged 1-15 years. Seven CD children, without catch-up growth after at least 12-months GFD, were tested for GH secretion and, in five out of seven patients, the diagnosis of GHD was made in the absence of metabolic and systemic diseases. RESULTS: APA and antihypothalamus antibodies were detected by the indirect immunofluorescence method in the seven CD children without catch-up growth factor and in 25 CD children without growth impairment matched for sex and age, and in 58 healthy children as control groups. APA resulted positive at high titres in four out of five CD-GHD patients and were also positive at low titres (<1:8) in three of only CD children and in two out of 58 controls. Hypothalamic-pituitary magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) was normal in all patients except in one with cystic pineal. APA have been previously detected not only in adults with GHD, but also in idiopathic GHD children, suggesting the occurrence of an autoimmune hypophysitis in these patients. CONCLUSION: In our study, the presence of APA in CD children without catch-up growth after GFD seems to be able to identify an autoimmune form of hypophysitis involving the somatotrophs cells.},

   abstract = {Sweden has experienced an epidemic of symptomatic coeliac disease that has no likeness anywhere else in the world. This is quite unique for a disease that is genetically dependent, immune-mediated and chronic, and suggests an abrupt increase and decrease, respectively, of one or a few causal factors influencing a large proportion of Swedish infants during the period in question. We have shown that half of the epidemic was explained by an increase in the proportion of infants introduced to gluten in comparatively large amounts after breast-feeding had been ended. This was partly an effect of societal changes in national dietary recommendations and the food content of industrially produced infant foods. Thus, these changes over time in infant feeding practices had a large public health impact. In fact, when the Swedish epidemic began, the increase in incidence rate was larger in girls than in boys, as was the decrease during the post-epidemic period. Moreover, children born during summer had an increased risk for coeliac disease, possibly as they were mostly introduced to dietary gluten during winter when infections are more common. Notably, birth cohorts of the epidemic and post-epidemic periods differ considerably regarding coeliac disease occurrence at comparable ages, even when followed up to school age. A longer follow-up will reveal to what extent new cases develop later in life, and to what extent this difference in cumulative incidence remains. However, mass screening studies of both the epidemic and post-epidemic cohorts at comparable ages are also planned to determine to what extent 'silent' disease cases develop. Continuing to explore the Swedish epidemic of coeliac disease by means of an epidemiological approach provides a unique opportunity. This may include increasing our understanding of what determines the clinical expression of the disease, exploring the potentially causal role of environmental exposures, and possibly also identifying strategies for primary prevention.},

   abstract = {A key initial event is proposed for the pathogenesis of celiac sprue. The indigestible fragments generated from gluten are actively transported to the vicinity of sites which are critical for recognition of intestinal basement membrane by enterocytes. The fragments are attached in the vicinity of those sites by transamidation and make the recognition sites unavailable. Enterocytes are lost because they do not recognize that they are in the right place. Proliferation in the crypts of Lieberkuhn and immune reactions in the epithelium are normal and appropriate. This hypothesis is shown to be compatible with a variety of observations, some of which are difficult to explain otherwise. Absence of a good animal model is laid to the sensitive site being a human peculiarity. The pattern of damage and the fact of recovery on a gluten-free diet are explained since the immune reactions and tissue remodeling observed are normal responses to tissue damage.},

Two strongly associated cofactors have been identified: the presence of HLA-DQ2 or HLA-DQ8 in the host and specific antigenic peptides in the diet that are present in wheat, rye, and barley. Most patients have complete remission after dietary elimination of these foods. Crohn's disease is characterized by chronic, relapsing, recurrent, focal, transmural inflammation of the gastrointestinal tract that can lead to multiple serious problems requiring chronic medical and surgical therapy. Crohn's disease is associated with multiple genetic mutations, at least one of which has been clearly implicated in innate immunity. Multiple lines of evidence suggest that the disease involves abnormal immune responses to gut microbial flora.},

RECENT FINDINGS: The role of genetics in disease susceptibility is slowly becoming more clearly defined and a more detailed understanding of the disease processes at the molecular level is paving the way towards the development of specific targeted therapies. SUMMARY: Despite recent advances in our understanding of celiac disease, the gluten-free diet remains the only current viable therapy and even with advances in serological tests and markers, the duodenal biopsy remains the gold standard for diagnosis and monitoring of the response to therapy.},

   abstract = {BACKGROUND: In recent years there has been increasing recognition that the pattern of presentation of coeliac disease may be changing. The classic sprue syndrome with diarrhoea and weight loss may be less common than the more subtle presentations of coeliac disease such as an isolated iron deficiency anaemia. As a result, the diagnosis of this treatable condition is often delayed or missed. Recent serologic screening tests allow non-invasive screening to identify most patients with the disease and can be applied in patients with even subtle symptoms indicative of coeliac disease. Both benign and malignant complications of coeliac disease can be avoided by early diagnosis and a strict compliance with a gluten free diet. AIM: The aim of this study is to evaluate the trends in clinical presentation of patients diagnosed with adult coeliac disease. In addition, we studied the biochemical and serological features and the prevalence of associated conditions in patients with adult coeliac disease. METHODS: This is an observational, retrospective, cross-sectional review of the medical notes of 32 adult patients attending the specialist coeliac clinic in a district general hospital. RESULTS: Anaemia was the most common mode of presentation accounting for 66% of patients. Less than half of the patients had any of the classical symptoms of coeliac disease and 25% had none of the classical symptoms at presentation. Anti-gliadin antibodies, anti-endomysial antibody and anti-tissue transglutaminase showed 75%, 68% and 90% sensitivity respectively. In combination, serology results were 100% sensitive as screening tests for adult coeliac disease. Fifty nine percent patients had either osteoporosis or osteopenia. There were no malignant complications observed during the follow up of our patients. CONCLUSION: Most adults with coeliac disease have a sub clinical form of the disease and iron deficiency anaemia may be its sole presenting symptom. Only a minority of adult coeliac disease patients present with classical mal-absorption symptoms of diarrhoea and weight loss. Patients with atypical form of disease often present initially to hospital specialists other than a gastro-enterologist. An awareness of the broad spectrum of presentations of adult coeliac disease, among doctors both in primary care and by the various hospital specialists in secondary care, is necessary to avoid delays in diagnosis. It is important to include serological screening tests for coeliac disease systematically in the evaluation of adult patients with unexplained iron deficiency anaemia or unexplained gastro-intestinal symptoms and in those who are considered to be at increased risk for coeliac disease.},

The symptom complex and results from small-bowel radiography and computerized tomography raised concern about progression to lymphoma, and ultimately a laparoscopy and small-bowel resection were done for diagnosis. A capsule endoscopy was performed to assess the extent of the patient's enteropathy-type intestinal T-cell lymphoma after three cycles of chemotherapy. We report the first use of capsule endoscopy in the setting of celiac disease associated enteropathy-type intestinal T-cell lymphoma. These endoscopic findings are correlated with those from gross and microscopic pathology and barium small-bowel radiography.},

Given the immense cost to society, successful treatment options are imperative. Based on initial findings, gluten withdrawal may serve as a safe and economical alternative for the reduction of symptoms in a subset of patients. METHOD: A review of the literature relevant to the association between schizophrenia and celiac disease (gluten intolerance) was conducted. RESULTS: A drastic reduction, if not full remission, of schizophrenic symptoms after initiation of gluten withdrawal has been noted in a variety of studies. However, this occurs only in a subset of schizophrenic patients. CONCLUSION: Large-scale epidemiological studies and clinical trials are needed to confirm the association between gluten and schizophrenia, and address the underlying mechanisms by which this association occurs.},

   abstract = {BACKGROUND: Coeliac disease is strongly associated with human leukocyte antigen (HLA)-DQ2 or DQ8 genotypes. The diagnosis is based on demonstrating crypt-hyperplastic villous atrophy, endomysial or transglutaminase antibodies and correlation of disease activity with gluten intake. AIM: To evaluate the clinical utility of HLA-DQ typing, when coeliac disease diagnosis had previously been established solely by histology. METHODS: HLA-DQ alleles, endomysial and transglutaminase antibodies were investigated and histology slides reviewed in 70 patients diagnosed 2-25 years earlier by small-intestinal biopsy but without measuring endomysial or transglutaminase antibodies. Patients without DQ2 or DQ8 or without unequivocal villous atrophy were followed-up on free diet by using serology and biopsies. RESULTS: All 40 endomysial/transglutaminase antibodies positive patients carried DQ2 or DQ8, and 39 of them had severe villous atrophy. Only 56% of patients without endomysial or transglutaminase antibodies positivity had DQ2 or DQ8 (P < 0.001). Seropositivity and relapse developed in 4 of 11 DQ2 positive but in none of 15 DQ2 and DQ8 negative patients on long-term gluten exposure. CONCLUSIONS: Coeliac disease diagnosis based solely on histology is not always reliable. HLA-DQ typing is important in identifying DQ2 and DQ8 negative subjects who need revision of their diagnosis, but it does not have additive diagnostic value if endomysial positivity is already known.},

SETTING: Tertiary care children's hospital. PARTICIPANTS: Coded stool samples from 20 children with newly diagnosed coeliac disease and 64 controls. Six children with coeliac disease had stool tests every two weeks for three months after starting a gluten-free diet. MAIN OUTCOME MEASURES: Secretory IgA antibodies against gliadin and human tissue transglutaminase in stool samples, determined in duplicate by using recommended cut-off limits. RESULTS: Sensitivity of faecal antibodies against human tissue transglutaminase was 10% (95% confidence interval 1% to 32%), and specificity was 98% (91% to 100%). For antibodies against gliadin, sensitivity was 6% (0% to 29%) and specificity was 97% (89% to 100%). Optimisation of cut-off limits by receiver operating characteristic analysis and use of results of both tests increased sensitivity to 82%, but specificity decreased to 58%. All follow-up stool tests remained negative, except for two positive anti-gliadin results in one patient, six and 10 weeks after the gluten-free diet was started. CONCLUSIONS: Neither stool test was suitable for screening for coeliac disease in children with symptoms.},

AIMS: We assessed whether there are differences in the eating habits of coeliac patients when compared to the general public. In addition, we compared chefs' knowledge with the public's knowledge about CD. METHOD: A questionnaire survey about CD was performed on coeliac patients, chefs and the general public from the United Kingdom (UK). RESULTS: Three hundred and nineteen coeliac patients [mean age 53.8 years, 65.8% female], 513 members of the public [49.2 years, 62.6% female] and 322 chefs [37.6 years, 15.2% female] were interviewed. Chefs were less likely to have heard of CD when compared to the public (17.1% (55/322) versus 44.2% (227/513), respectively, P<0.0001). Coeliac patients ate less frequently at a friend's house than the general public (P = 0.003). Coeliac patients ate less frequently from take-away establishments (P<0.0001). However, coeliac patients' ate as frequently in restaurants (P = 0.078). CONCLUSIONS: In the UK, chefs appear to know less about CD than the general public. Patients with CD feel justifiably cautious when eating food not prepared at home. Educating chefs about a gluten-free diet may alleviate the social restrictions on coeliac patients.},

   abstract = {OBJECTIVE: Coeliac disease (CD) susceptibility has been shown to be associated with the HLA alleles DQA1*0501 and DQB1*0201. This HLA-associated risk has been estimated to account for 29-40% of the genetic component of CD. Conflicting data have been published on the gene dose effect of these HLA alleles on the risk and severity of CD. In this study the aim was to investigate the association between the number of HLA risk alleles and the severity of CD. MATERIAL AND METHODS: Fifty-four Finnish CD families, including 144 CD patients mainly diagnosed in adulthood (94.4%), were enrolled in the study. The association between the number of DQA1*0501 and DQB1*0201 alleles and villous atrophy, symptoms and laboratory parameters at the time of diagnosis, and the association with villous atrophy after one year of treatment on a gluten-free diet were studied. RESULTS: The homozygosity for the DQB1*0201 allele was associated with a more severe form of CD assessed by more severe villous atrophy (p=0.011), younger age (p=0.036), more severe diarrhoea (p=0.048) and a lower level of blood haemoglobin at the time of diagnosis (p=0.010). Furthermore, the homozygosity for the DQB1*0201 allele was associated with a slower recovery of villous atrophy after a gluten-free diet (p=0.041). In contrast, the DQA1*0501 allele did not have a significant association with the severity of CD. CONCLUSIONS: Our results demonstrate a gene dose effect of the DQB1*0201 allele on the clinical heterogeneity of CD and on the rate of recovery from villous atrophy in patients on a gluten-free diet.},

   abstract = {OBJECTIVE: In coeliac disease, autoantibodies directed against transglutaminase 2 are produced in small-bowel mucosa, and they have been found to be deposited extracellularly. The aim of this study was to investigate whether such mucosal IgA deposits are important in the diagnostic work-up of early-stage coeliac disease without small-bowel mucosal villous atrophy. MATERIAL AND METHODS: Forty-one adults suspected of coeliac disease owing to increased density of mucosal gamma(delta)+ intraepithelial lymphocytes but normal villous morphology were randomized to gluten challenge or a gluten-free diet for 6 months. Clinically and histologically verified gluten dependency was compared with existence of small-bowel mucosal transglutaminase 2-specific extracellular IgA deposits and (coeliac disease-type) HLA DQ2 and DQ8; 34 non-coeliac subjects and 18 patients with classical coeliac disease served as controls. RESULTS: Of the 41 patients, 5 in the challenge group and 6 in the gluten-free diet group were clinically gluten sensitive; all 11 had HLA DQ2 or DQ8. Ten of these 11 patients showed transglutaminase 2-targeted mucosal IgA deposits, which were dependent on gluten consumption. Minimal IgA deposits were seen in only 3 out of 30 patients with suspected coeliac disease without any clinically detected gluten dependency. The deposits were found in all classical coeliac patients and in none of the non-coeliac control subjects. CONCLUSIONS: Clinically pertinent coeliac disease exists despite normal small-bowel mucosal villous architecture. Mucosal transglutaminase 2-specific IgA deposits can be utilized in detecting such patients with genetic gluten intolerance.},

   abstract = {Celiac disease is an enteropathy occurring in genetically predisposed individuals due to a dietary intolerance to gluten. Patients with celiac disease may develop a neurological disorder of unknown cause, although autoimmune mechanisms are suspected. We report on a 56-year-old man with celiac disease, who became refractory to a gluten-free diet and died of a rapidly progressive encephalopathy. Magnetic resonance imaging indicated focal lesions of the cerebellum and brainstem, and electrodiagnostic studies suggested an axonal neuropathy. Autopsy revealed a flattened small-bowel mucosa with intraepithelial lymphocytosis, a spectrum of degenerative changes of the intra-abdominal and mediastinal lymph nodes, including cavitary degeneration, and splenomegaly. Histologically, the lymph nodes showed pseudocyst formation and lymphocytic vasculitis with fibrinoid necrosis, and sections of the brain exhibited fibrinoid degeneration of small blood vessels, sparse perivascular lymphocytic infiltrates, and perivascular ischemic lesions. Identical T-cell clones were identified in the duodenum, stomach, lymph nodes, and spleen. This patient had an unusual neurological disorder related to a vasculopathy, probably mediated by a circulating neoplastic clone of activated T cells.},

   abstract = {AIMS: Since hyaluronan (HA) metabolism is disturbed in some malignant tumours and in inflammatory diseases, we analysed HA and its receptor CD44 as well as the expression of the Ki67 nuclear protein, a marker of cell proliferation, in histological sections of duodenal biopsies of coeliac disease patients and controls. METHODS AND RESULTS: The study group consisted of 52 patients with coeliac disease in remission, 40 patients with newly diagnosed disease and 10 healthy control subjects. HA was detected with a specific biotinylated probe prepared from cartilage aggrecan and link protein, and CD44 with an antibody recognizing all forms of CD44 and another specific for its v6 variant. For the expression of the nuclear protein, monoclonal antibody MIB-1 was used. The percentage of HA-positive cells in surface epithelium was higher in newly diagnosed patients (13%) compared with patients in remission (11%) and controls (2%). In addition, HA intensity in the lamina propria was decreased in the newly diagnosed patients. In patients with active disease, 22-26% of the surface epithelium was CD44+, whereas the corresponding figure in patients in remission was 5%, and that of controls 1%. The more intensive MIB-1 labelling in the duodenal epithelium of coeliac patients without treatment was normalized after gluten-free diet. CONCLUSIONS: The HA-positive coat on surface epithelium seen even in patients in remission suggests persistent or even permanent changes in the epithelial permeability barrier in coeliac disease.},

   abstract = {Celiac disease is caused by sensitivity to wheat gluten in genetically susceptible individuals. The etiological role of the other wheat-related cereals, barley, rye, and oats, is still debated. In order to investigate this issue further, in this study we examined the immune response of celiac mucosal T cell lines to fractions from all four cereals. Cell stimulation was assessed by measuring proliferation (employing (3)H-thymidine incorporation) or cytokine (IL-2, IFN-gamma) production. All five T cell lines demonstrated immunoreactivity to protein fractions from the four related cereals. In some cell lines, reactivity to wheat, barley, and rye was only evident when these cereal fractions had been pretreated with tissue transglutaminase. This study confirms the similar T cell antigenic reactivity of these four related cereals and has implications for their exclusion in the gluten-free diet. However, despite oats stimulation of T cell lines, this cereal does not activate a mucosal lesion in most celiac patients.},

   abstract = {Modification of the enzymatic functions of tissue transglutaminase (TG2) by anti-TG2 autoantibodies may play a role in manifestations of coeliac disease. Our aim was to evaluate the effect of coeliac autoantibodies on reactions catalysed by TG2 by a systematic biochemical approach, and in relation to observed clinical presentation type. Coeliac antibodies did not have significant inhibitory effect on transamidation/deamidation activity of TG2 as measured by amine-incorporation into solid and immobilised casein and by ultraviolet kinetic assay. In contrast, immunoglobulins from patients with severe malabsorption enhanced the reaction velocity to 105.4-242.2%. This activating effect was dose-dependent, most pronounced with immobilised glutamine-acceptor substrates, and correlated inversely with the basal specific activity of the enzyme and with dietary treatment. A similar activation could be demonstrated also with the TG2-specific fraction of autoantibodies and in transamidation activity assays which use fibronectin-bound TG2 and thereby mimic in vivo conditions. These results suggest that coeliac antibodies may stabilise the enzyme in a catalytically advantageous conformation. GTPase activity of TG2 decreased to 67.0-73.4% in the presence of antibodies raising the possibility that inhibition of GTPase activity may affect cellular signalling in case coeliac autoantibodies would reach intracellular compartments.},

   abstract = {Celiac disease (CD) is a small intestinal disorder caused by adaptive and innate immune responses triggered by the gluten proteins present in wheat. In the intestine, gluten is partially degraded and modified, which results in gluten peptides that bind with high affinity to HLA-DQ2 or HLA-DQ8 and trigger an inflammatory T cell response. Simultaneously, gluten exposure leads to increased production of IL15, which induces the expression of NKG2D on intraepithelial lymphocytes and its ligand MICA on epithelial cells, leading to epithelial cell destruction. The gluten-specific T cell response results in the production of antibodies against tissue transglutaminase and these are specific indicators of disease. CD is one of the most common inherited diseases, the HLA-DQ locus being the major contributing genetic factor. However, as the inheritance does not follow a Mendelian segregation pattern, multiple other genes, each with relative weak effect, contribute to disease development. An important role for environmental factors, however, can not be ignored as the concordance rate in monozygous twins is considerably less than 100%. The identification of these environmental factors and susceptibility genes may allow a better understanding of disease etiology and provide diagnostic and prognostic markers. The current treatment for CD consists of a life-long gluten-free diet. Although long thought to be impossible, recent results suggest that the development of nontoxic wheat varieties may be feasible, which would aid disease prevention and provide an alternative food source for patients.},

   abstract = {BACKGROUND: Immunoglobulin A class transglutaminase autoantibodies are highly predictive markers of active coeliac disease, a disorder difficult to recognize solely on clinical grounds. AIMS: To develop and evaluate a simple rapid test for point-of-care detection of coeliac autoantibodies. METHODS: The novel whole blood test utilizes the patient's endogenous transglutaminase in red blood cells for detection of transglutaminase-specific immunoglobulin A antibodies present in the blood sample, with normal plasma immunoglobulin A detection as positive test control. We evaluated 284 patients under suspicion of coeliac disease and undergoing jejunal biopsy, and 263 coeliac patients on a gluten-free diet, 383 being tested prospectively in a point-of-care setting. Results were compared with histology, conventional serum autoantibody results and dietary adherence. RESULTS: The rapid test showed 97% sensitivity and 97% specificity for untreated coeliac disease, and identified all immunoglobulin A-deficient samples. Point-of-care testing found new coeliac cases as efficiently as antibody tests in laboratory. Coeliac autoantibodies were detected onsite in 21% of treated patients, while endomysial and transglutaminase antibodies were positive in 20% and 19%, respectively. The positivity rate correlated with dietary lapses and decreased on intensified dietary advice given upon positive point-of-care test results. CONCLUSIONS: Point-of-care testing was accurate in finding new coeliac cases and helped to identify and decrease dietary non-compliance.},

We report a case of a 78-year-old male patient with UJI and CD diagnosed at the same time. He presented with abdominal pain, diarrhoea and weight loss and had serological, endoscopical, radiological and histological findings compatible with the diagnoses of both UJI and CD. The possibility of EATL was carefully excluded. The patient exhibited significant symptomatic improvement with a gluten-free diet, probably indicating an early stage of disease despite his old age. In conclusion, this rather unusual case of an elderly patient presenting with UJI and CD without evidence of EATL supports the great heterogeneity of these diseases not only in their clinical presentation but even in their course and complications.},

   abstract = {Because of the wide variations in the clinical presentation of celiac disease and because treatment exists that is effective in most cases, screening of the general population for celiac disease has been considered. There is still no evidence that patients who have symptom-free celiac disease are at increased risk of small intestinal lymphoma or other complications. Prevention of osteoporosis seems to be the strongest indicator for widespread screening today [22]. The major cause of failure to respond to a gluten-free diet is continuing ingestion of gluten, but other underlying diseases must be considered. Many different drugs (eg, anti-tumor necrosis factor [TNF]-alpha) have been used in patients who have RCD [23]. Steroid treatment has been reported to be effective even in patients who have underlying early EATL. Histologic recovery in patients who have celiac disease usually takes several months but can take up to 1 year, even if the patient remains on a strict gluten-free diet. Some patients report celiac-related symptoms for months after a single gluten intake. The definitions for RCD in literature vary. The authors consider the definition give by Daum and colleagues [24] suitable. They defined true RCD as villous atrophy with crypt hyperplasia and increased IELs persisting for more than 12 months in spite of a strict gluten-free diet. If a patient is not responding well to a gluten-free diet, three considerations are necessary: (1) the initial diagnosis of celiac disease must be reassessed;(2) the patient should be sent to a dietician to check for errors in diet or compliance problems, because problems with the gluten-free diet are the most important cause for persisting symptoms; (3) other reasons for persisting symptoms (eg, pancreatic insufficiency, irritable bowel syndrome, bacterial overgrowth, lymphocytic colitis, collagenous colitis, ulcerative jejunitis, protein-losing enteropathy,T-cell lymphoma, fructose intolerance, cavitating lymphadenopathy, and tropical sprue) should be considered. Other causes for villous atrophy are Crohn's disease, collagenous sprue, and autoimmune enteropathy. Abdulkarim and colleagues [25] examined 55 patients who had a diagnosis of nonresponsive celiac disease. He found that 6 did not have celiac disease, and25 still had some gluten ingestion.Tursi and colleagues [26] reported 15 patients who had celiac disease with persisting symptoms. Because histology improved in all patients after several months, RCD was excluded. Of the 15 patients, 10 had small intestinal bacterial overgrowth, 2 showed lactose malabsorption causing the described symptoms, 1 had mistakenly taken an antibiotic containing gluten, and 1 patient each had Giardia lamblia and Ascaris lumbricoides. Thus, other entities must be considered in patients who have celiac disease and ongoing symptoms. In a follow-up clinical trial, 158 patients who had celiac disease underwent follow-up small intestine biopsies within 2 years after starting a gluten-free diet. Eleven patients (7.0%) with persisting (partial) villous atrophy were considered to have RCD; 5 of them developed EATL [27].RCD type I is characterized by normal expression of T-cell antigens and polyclonal TCR gene rearrangement.RCD type II is characterized by an abnormal IEL phenotype with the expression of intracytoplasmic CD3e, surface CD103, and the lack of classic surface T-cell markers such as CD8, CD4, and TCR-alpha/beta. This clonal IEL population can be considered crypt IEL [24]. RCD II has a poor prognosis, which is a problem for therapy. Clonal TCR gene rearrangements and loss of T-cell antigens such as CD8 and TCR-beta in IELs may indicate the development of an EATL in patients who have RCD. The markers for an overt EATL are a positive stool blood test, increased lactate dehydrogenase, or beta2-microglobulin [24]. If an overt lymphoma is suspected, upper and lower endoscopy, an ear, nose, and throat work-up, CT scan, capsule endoscopy, and possibly double-balloon enteroscopy should be performed. Most reports of the difficulties in treating patients who have true RCE are casereports. Turner and colleagues [28] reported on an induction of remission by useof the anti-TNF-alpha antibody infliximab and maintenance with prednisoloneand azathioprine. Olaussen and colleagues [29] and Mandal and colleagues [30]tried a nonimmunogenic elemental diet. Gillet and colleagues [31] reported successful treatment of a patient who hadRCD using anti-TNF-alpha antibodies (infliximab) for induction and azathioprinefor maintenance. Maurino and colleagues [32] studied seven consecutive patients diagnosed ashaving refractory sprue and no response to oral or parenteral steroids. Aftertreatment with azathioprine (2 mg/kg/d) and oral prednisone (1 mg/kg/d), fivepatients had a complete clinical remission. Two patients who did not respond totreatment at any time died. Goerres and colleagues [33] described 18 patients who had RCD, 10 of whomhad type I RCD, and 8 of whom had type II RCD. Treatment consisted ofazathioprine combined with prednisone for 1 year. Consistent with reports byother investigators, the response rates in the two groups differed. Eight of the10 patients who had type I RCD had a histologic response. Seven of the eightpatients who had type II RCD died, and six of the eight developed a lymphoma. At present there is no effective treatment for type II RCD.Fig. 3 presents a proposed algorithm for monitoring patients who have ce-liac disease.},

   abstract = {Medical nutrition therapy is the only accepted treatment for celiac disease. This paper summarizes a review of scientific studies using the gluten-free diet, nutritional risk factors, controversial elements of the diet, and its implementation in treating celiac disease. Treatment for celiac disease requires elimination of the storage proteins found in wheat, rye, and barley. The inclusion of oats and wheat starch is controversial. Research supports that oats may be acceptable for patients with celiac disease and can improve the nutritional quality of the diet. However, use of oats is not widely recommended in the United States because of concerns of potential contamination of commercial oats. Studies assessing the contamination of commercial oats are limited. Research indicates no differences in patients choosing a strict wheat starch-containing, gluten-free diet vs. a naturally gluten-free diet. Factors other than trace gluten may be the cause of continued villous atrophy in some patients. The impact of nutrient malabsorption caused from untreated celiac disease is well documented. The diet and gluten-free products are often low in B vitamins, calcium, vitamin D, iron, zinc, magnesium, and fiber. Few gluten-free products are enriched or fortified, adding to the risk of nutrient deficiencies. Patients newly diagnosed or inadequately treated have low bone mineral density, imbalanced macronutrients, low fiber intake, and micronutrient deficiencies. Also troubling is the increased incidence of obesity seen in persons with celiac disease following a gluten-free diet. Because of the nutritional risks associated with celiac disease, a registered dietitian must be part of the health care team that monitors the patient's nutritional status and compliance on a regular basis.},

   abstract = {Celiac disease (CD) is an autoimmune condition occurring in genetically susceptible individuals characterized by inflammatory injury to the mucosa of the small intestine after the ingestion of wheat glutens or related barley and rye products. Originally thought to be highly prevalent only in Northern European populations, growing evidence indicates a much higher prevalence in many other regions, including the US as well as South America, North Africa, and Asia. The growing awareness that pediatric patients may present with quite diverse and protean manifestations and the significant impact of CD on childhood development has prompted efforts to increase CD awareness for the early diagnosis and treatment of this disease. The current diagnostic criteria for CD requires characteristic histologic findings in small bowel biopsies and clinical remission when placed on a gluten-free diet. Serologic testing for CD can provide additional support for the diagnosis of CD or a means to assess efficacy and adherence to a gluten-free diet. The mainstay of treatment remains the institution of a gluten-free diet. However, patients with refractory CD may require treatment with immunosuppressant medications. With the increased identification of specific gluten epitopes and understanding of the pathogenesis of CD, future therapies may rely on genetically altering gluten proteins, immunization techniques, or therapies focused on either the development of specific immune tolerance or regulation of mucosal inflammation.},

MATERIAL AND METHODS: We recruited 31 celiac children at diagnosis (on gluten containing diet) and 31 age and sex matched healthy children. Anti-islet cell antibodies (ICA) were detected by indirect immunofluorescence on monkey pancreas. Anti-glutamate decarboxylase (anti-GAD) and anti-tyrosine phosphatase (anti-IA2) antibodies were assessed by a radio-immuno- precipitation method. RESULTS: Three out of 31 celiac patients (9.7%) had one or more diabetes-related autoantibodies. ICA, anti-GAD and anti-IA2 were found in respectively 3.2%; 3.2% and 9.7% of patients. Only one control (3.2%) had anti-GAD. There was no statistically significant difference between the 2 groups. CONCLUSION: The risk to develop diabetes seems to be the same in celiac patients and in healthy subjects thus screening of diabetes-related autoantibodies is not justified in celiac patients.},

Laboratory tests showed severe anaemia in the three cases. Reduced calcium was found in two cases, and corrected calcium was found in one case. Radiological examination showed fissure in two cases. The diagnosis of osteomalacia was made by clinical, biochemical and radiological features. Antigliadin, antireticulin, antiendomysial and anti-tissue transglutaminase antibodies were all positive in the three cases, and a small-bowel biopsy confirmed the diagnosis of CD. Treatment with gluten-free diet (GFD), supplemental calcium and vitamin D was initiated for the three patients, but only one patient complies strictly with the GFD; she showed a marked resolution of her symptoms.},

In fact, careful history, laboratory evaluation and endoscopy with duodenal biopsies found all the classical hallmarks of unmasked celiac sprue. The patient then had a dramatic response to a gluten-free diet, with complete resolution of symptoms. Persistent travelers' diarrhea is an entity which carries an interesting and extensive differential diagnosis beyond persistent enteric infections or infestations. Rather, many sufferers have long been cleared of the initial offending pathogen and are left with either a post-infectious disorder of absorption, digestion, motility or visceral sensation or carry a chronic gastrointestinal disorder which has been unmasked by an enteric infection, such as idiopathic inflammatory bowel disease, gastrointestinal malignancy or celiac sprue. Other key issues raised by the case include the vanishing incidence of tropical sprue, an entity to which most clinicians would have mistakenly attributed this malabsorptive syndrome arising in a traveler, and the under-recognition of the protean manifestations of celiac sprue, to which we would add persistent travelers' diarrhea.},

AIM: To investigate clinical and histopathological variables affecting circulating ghrelin in coeliac patients by comparison with dyspeptic patients and with healthy controls. METHODS: We measured serum ghrelin and obtained gastric and duodenal biopsies in 44 coeliac patients before and after 1-year gluten-free diet, in 39 dyspeptic patients and 53 healthy controls. RESULTS: Serum ghrelin concentration was significantly higher in coeliac (531 +/- 29 pg/mL, P < 0.05) and in dyspeptic patients (526 +/- 14 pg/mL, P < 0.01) than in healthy controls (451 +/- 8 pg/mL), and body mass index was significantly lower in coeliac (20 +/- 1) and in dyspeptic patients (20 +/- 1) than in healthy controls (22 +/- 1, P < 0.05). In coeliac patients serum ghrelin concentration was not related to the severity of duodenal lesions. Serum ghrelin reverted to normal (399 +/- 30 pg/mL) and body mass index increased significantly (0.6 +/- 0.1 kg/m(2) increase, P < 0.05) during gluten-free diet despite persistent duodenal lymphocytic infiltration. CONCLUSIONS: Ghrelin concentration is increased and body mass index is decreased in coeliac and in dyspeptic patients irrespective of presence and severity of duodenal inflammation. Nutritional impairment is a key factor in elevating plasma ghrelin levels in coeliac disease.},

Our aim was to identify the immune mediators involved in the long-standing inflammation in untreated CD patients at diagnosis. mRNA and protein levels of TNFalpha, IL-12(p35), IL-12(p40), IL-15, IL-18 and IL-23(p19) were quantified in biopsies from active CD patients, CD patients on a gluten-free diet (GFD), healthy controls, and patients with non-CD inflammation and mild histological changes in the intestine. Biopsies from CD patients on a GFD were also stimulated in vitro with gliadin, and protein expression of IL-15 and IL-18 was analysed. Levels of IL-12 and IL-23 mRNA are nearly absent, and TNFalpha levels remain unchanged among different groups. Both the active and inactive forms of IL-18 protein have been found in all samples from active CD, and protein expression was only localized within the crypts. Levels of IL-15 mRNA remain unchanged, and protein expression, localized within the lamina propria, is found in a small number of samples. In vitro stimulation with gluten induces the expression of IL-15 and IL-18. In active CD, the early response following gluten intake characterized by high IFNgamma levels is driven by IL-18, and probably IL-15, and this alternates with periods of long-standing inflammation with moderate IFNgamma levels, maintained by IL-18 alone.},

   abstract = {OBJECTIVE: To present the case of a collegiate tennis player with celiac disease symptoms. BACKGROUND: Celiac disease is a common intestinal disorder that is often confused with other conditions. It causes severe intestinal damage manifested by several uncomfortable signs and symptoms. Failure by the sports medicine staff to recognize symptoms consistent with celiac disease and treat them appropriately can have deleterious consequences for the athlete. DIFFERENTIAL DIAGNOSIS: Irritable bowel syndrome, Crohn disease, Addison disease, lupus erythematosus, juvenile rheumatoid arthritis, lactose intolerance, herpes zoster, psychogenic disorder (depression), fibromyalgia, complex regional pain syndrome, hyperthyroidism, anemia, type I diabetes. TREATMENT: The athlete underwent a series of blood and allergen tests to confirm or refute a diagnosis of celiac disease. When celiac disease was suspected, dietary modifications were made to eliminate all wheat-based and gluten-based products from the athlete's diet. UNIQUENESS: The athlete was able to fully compete in a competitive National Collegiate Athletic Association Division I tennis program while experiencing the debilitating effects associated with celiac disease. The immediacy of symptom onset was notable because the athlete had no history of similar complaints. CONCLUSIONS: Celiac disease is a potentially life-threatening condition that affects more people than reported. A properly educated sports medicine staff can help to identify symptoms consistent with celiac disease early, so damage to the intestine is minimized. Prompt recognition and appropriate management allow the athlete to adjust the diet accordingly, compete at a high-caliber level, and enjoy a healthier quality of life.},

   abstract = {Coeliac disease (CoD) is a small intestinal disorder characterized by villous atrophy, crypt cell hyperplasia and an increased production of T helper cell type 1 (Th1) cytokines. Interleukin (IL)-18 is a pro-inflammatory cytokine that has a crucial role in maintaining the Th1 response. In this study, the serum levels of IL-18 were measured in children with CoD or other gastrointestinal diseases in order to evaluate the possibility of using IL-18 as a disease activity marker. IL-18 levels were higher in samples from CoD patients [median 443 pg/ml (148-885)] compared to healthy controls [median 205 pg/ml (11-379)], P <0.05. In contrast, the levels of IL-18 were not enhanced significantly in the serum from patients with inflammatory bowel disease (IBD) [median 324 pg/ml (207-546)] or in the disease control group [median 303 pg/ml (2-689)]. In CoD patients, after 2 weeks of gluten challenge (GC), serum IL-18 was unchanged [median 268 pg/ml (59-458)] compared to patients on a gluten-free diet [median 220 pg/ml (53-600)], while IL-18 was increased after 12 weeks of GC [median 551 pg/ml (94-952)], P <0.01. The IL-18 levels correlated with IgA anti-transglutaminase antibody levels (rs=0.59, P=0.016) in serum from untreated CoD patients, and IL-18 also followed the degree of small intestinal villous atrophy in 12 out of 19 CoD patients. Our results support the view that serum IL-18 concentrations in children with CoD follow disease activity, suggesting a role for IL-18 in the induction of an inflammatory Th1-response after gluten exposure.},

   abstract = {BACKGROUND: Patients with inflammatory bowel disease have a 10- to 100-fold increased risk of nephrolithiasis, with enteric hyperoxaluria being the major risk factor for these and other patients with fat malabsorptive states. Endogenous components of the intestinal microflora can potentially limit dietary oxalate absorption. METHODS: Ten patients were studied with chronic fat malabsorption, calcium oxalate stones, and hyperoxaluria thought to be caused by jejunoileal bypass (1) and Roux-en-Y gastric bypass surgery for obesity (4), dumping syndrome secondary to gastrectomy (2), celiac sprue (1), chronic pancreatitis (1), and ulcerative colitis in remission (1). For 3 months, patients received increasing doses of a lactic acid bacteria mixture (Oxadrop), VSL Pharmaceuticals), followed by a washout month. Twenty-four-hour urine collections were performed at baseline and after each month. RESULTS: Mean urinary oxalate excretion fell by 19% after 1 month (1 dose per day, P < 0.05), and oxalate excretion remained reduced by 24% during the second month (2 doses per day, P < 0.05). During the third month on 3 doses per day oxalate excretion increased slightly, so that the mean was close to the baseline established off treatment. Urinary oxalate again fell 20% from baseline during the washout period. Calcium oxalate supersaturation was reduced while on Oxadrop, largely due to the decrease in oxalate excretion, although mean changes did not reach statistical significance. CONCLUSION: Manipulation of gastrointestinal (GI) flora can influence urinary oxalate excretion to reduce urinary supersaturation levels. These changes could have a salutary effect on stone formation rates. Further studies will be needed to establish the optimal dosing regimen.},

   abstract = {BACKGROUND: Celiac disease is one of the most common dietary-mediated inflammatory enteropathies that occur in genetically predisposed individuals in response to gluten intolerance. This disorder has become more common than in the past, even if it frequently remains undetected for long periods of time. The screening of patients with dyspepsia, a symptom that can be a manifestation of celiac disease, may allow an early identification of affected individuals. Endoscopy and serological tests may have an important role in the management of these patients. AIMS: Determining the prevalence of celiac disease in dyspeptic patients submitted to routine diagnostic upper gastrointestinal endoscopy. PATIENTS/METHODS: Endoscopic findings, duodenal biopsy histological specimens and serological test results were assessed and compared in 142 patients consecutively admitted with dyspeptic symptoms between October 2001 and October 2003. RESULTS: An endoscopic pattern suggestive of celiac disease was observed in four patients. The IgG-AGA assay was positive in 24 patients. Two of the IgG-AGA positive patients also yielded positive results on the IgA-EMA test and concomitantly disclosed endoscopic pattern and histological features in duodenal biopsy compatible with celiac disease. Abnormal endoscopic findings were notably marked in biopsy proven celiac patients. Therefore, a 1.4% prevalence of celiac disease was observed in this study group. CONCLUSIONS: The high prevalence of celiac among dyspeptic symptomatic individuals indicates that they are a higher risk group for developing celiac disease. Undiagnosed celiac disease may be inferred by endoscopic markers of duodenal villous atrophy. Endoscopic findings, however, may be inadequate to suitably diagnose this disease and consequently the incorporation of diagnostic serologic assays of celiac disease in routine testing for dyspepsia is strongly recommended.},

Primary (15%) and secondary (85%) forms are known. In the more frequent secondary forms small intestine and the right side of the colon are mainly affected, and the underlying pathology can be gastrointestinal, pulmonary or immunological. The 64 year old male patient reported by the authors showed clinical signs of severe malabsorption (his body weight: 47,5 kg, height: 178 cm, BMI: 15). The intestinal pneumatosis was diagnosed by exploration performed because of suspected perforation (pneumoperitoneum). Due to severe malabsorption the patient was admitted to Gastroenterological Department. Duodenoscopy and small bowel biopsy was performed. Small intestinal histology and presence of anti-gliadin and anti-endomysium antibody confirmed the suspected diagnosis of coeliakia. Parenteral nutrition, special gliadin free diet, hyperbaric oxygen inhalation, steroid, and metronidazole treatment resulted in a gradual improvement in the nutritional and general condition of the patient. After one year the patient is without complaints, he gained 24,5 kg body weight BMI: 22,5). The author's case points to a rare serious complication of non-treated coeliakia. Recognition of intestinal pneumatosis in time could have prevented surgical intervention in the high risk patient.},

   abstract = {OBJECTIVE: To study the effect of HLA DQ2, dietary history and development of coeliac disease (CD) on the induction of antibody response to wheat gliadin and cow's milk, beta-lactoglobulin between 1 and 2.5 years of age in children who developed CD and in healthy children. MATERIAL AND METHODS: Infants participating in a birth cohort study (the ABIS study) in Sweden were studied. Thirty-nine children developed CD (=cases), confirmed through biopsy, during follow-up until 2.5-5 years of age. A total of 181 healthy control children were matched for duration of exclusive breast-feeding, birth-weight, gender, maternal smoking and season of birth. IgG and IgA antigliadin and anti-beta-lactoglobulin antibodies were measured using enzyme immunoassay (EIA). The effects of HLA-risk genotypes, DQ2 and DQ8, on CD were also considered. RESULTS: Children who developed CD had higher IgG and IgA antigliadin and anti-beta-lactoglobulin antibody levels at 1 year of age than controls (all comparisons: p<0.001). Similar differences were seen between cases with as yet undiagnosed CD by 1 year of age and controls, and also when cases were compared with HLA-matched controls. Higher levels of IgG and IgA antibodies to beta-lactoglobulin (p=0.003; p=0.001), but not to gliadin, were found in treated cases versus controls at 2.5 years of age. HLA-DQ2-positive healthy children had lower levels of IgG and IgA antigliadin antibodies than HLA-DQ2 negative controls at 1 year of age (p=0.004; p=0.012). CONCLUSIONS: Enhanced humoral response emerging not only to gliadin, but also to other food antigens seems to be primarily associated with CD. Poor induction of antibody response to wheat gliadin in healthy children with the HLA-DQ2 risk molecule could at least partly explain the genetic predisposition to gluten intolerance and CD.},

   abstract = {Coeliac disease, daily more frequently diagnosed in our population, involves many organs also in oligosymptomatic patients and with an adequate nutritional regime. Possible endocrine implications include failure to thrive, pubertal delay and reproduction diseases due to deregulation of GH, FSH and LH secretion. Leptin, an adipose tissue hormone, can be decreased as well and its deficiency could be related to growth and puberty anomalies. We studied 14 asymptomatic coeliac patients in peripubertal age (7.5-13.8 years) and tested their leptin levels in order to correlate them with endocrine and anthropometric data. Before the diet was started leptinaemia (M+/-DS) was: 4.94+/-5.53 ng/ml. In 10/14 patients (71%) leptinaemia was<or=2 DS for gender and age. In all the patients, after a period of 6-12 months of gluten-free diet, Leptin levels appreciably raised to 10.8+/-7.9 ng/ml, with a significant correlation to the time of the diet. Leptinaemia was actually lower in patients with a severe mucosal atrophy, and in these patients it increased more significantly after the diet was started. The removal of gluten itself may reduce immunological hit to adipose tissue and the 'malnutrition' of adipocytes: leptin can hence increase despite no significant increase of body mass index occurs. This study could partially explain the correlation between body mass index, Coeliac disease and the deregulation of puberty and fertility, mainly in patients who started the diet late. It could also explain the reversibility of this alteration if the cause is removed.},

In fact, a wide spectrum of liver injuries in children and adults may be related to CD and in particular: (1) a mild parenchymal damage characterised by absence of any clinical sign or symptom suggesting a chronic liver disease and by non-specific histological changes reversible on a gluten-free diet; (2) a chronic inflammatory liver injury of autoimmune mechanism, including autoimmune hepatitis, primary sclerosing cholangitis and primary biliary cirrhosis, that may lead to fibrosis and cirrhosis, generally unaffected by gluten withdrawal and necessitating an immunosuppressive treatment; (3) a severe liver failure potentially treatable by a gluten-free diet. Such different types of liver injuries may represent a spectrum of a same disorder where individual factors, such as genetic predisposition, precocity and duration of exposure to gluten may influence the reversibility of liver damage. A rigorous cross-checking for a asymptomatic liver damage in CD individuals and conversely, for CD in any cryptogenic liver disorder including end-stage liver failure is recommended.},

A prevalence of primary hyperparathyroidism of 2.3% in this series suggests a significant association between hyperparathyroidism and coeliac disease; most studies have indicated a prevalence of 3 in 1000 in the general population, although one study found that it may be as high as 21 in 1000 in women aged 55-75 years. The average age of patients in our series was 59 years and all but one were women. Further studies are needed to establish a possible association between primary hyperparathyroidism and coeliac disease.},

   abstract = {Previous studies on celiac patients demonstrated that exposure to gliadin alters the motility of the upper gastrointestinal tract, leading to increased acid reflux. No literature is available regarding the possible presence of specialized intestinal metaplasia of the esophagus as a consequence of chronic reflux in adult celiac patients. Our purpose was to evaluate endoscopically and histologically the esophagi of a group of untreated celiac patients. We studied 60 celiac patients, 13 men and 47 women (mean age, 40 +/- 14 [SD] years; range, 18-80 years), at their first endoscopy (following a normal diet). The distal esophagus was evaluated and multiple biopsies were taken. Hematoxylin-eosin and alcian blue stainings were performed. A group of nonceliac, age- and sex-matched patients was used as a control. We found intestinal metaplasia in the distal esophagus of 16 of 60 (26.6%) celiacs (mean age, 45 +/- 13 years; range, 27-75 years), in comparison with a control-group prevalence of 10.9% (OR, 3.9; 95% CI, 1.4-11.2%). Among the celiac group with metaplasia, only one patient had reflux-like symptoms. None had esophagitis. In conclusion, we observed an increased prevalence of esophageal metaplasia in patients with celiac disease. This finding could be the result of motor abnormalities leading to chronic acid reflux, combined with a mucosa which is sensitive to gliadin.},

CD is typically characterized by gastrointestinal (GI) symptoms, anti-transglutaminase antibodies in the sera, and microscopical findings of the intestinal mucosa, which resolve with a gluten-free diet (GFD). In Asian populations, including the Japanese, CD and the associated NHL have been supposed to be quite rare, and studies concerning the frequency of CD or its relationship with NHL are scarce. We describe a Japanese middle-aged man with intestinal diffuse large B-cell lymphoma associated with CD. Following multi-combined chemotherapy, the patient's lymphoma has been in a state of complete response, and his GI symptoms have improved with a GFD. This case suggests that the possibility of CD and its association with intestinal NHL should be kept in mind, even in Asian populations.},

   abstract = {Wheat is the staple cereal in many countries and its uses in manufactured foods are ever growing due to the technological qualities of gluten proteins. Transglutaminases (TG) are ubiquitous enzymes with many functions. They are able to transform proteins by deamidation and/or transamidation. This last reaction can cross-link proteins together. Intestinal tissue TG has been shown to play an important role in two kinds of immune reactions to wheat: celiac disease and wheat-dependent exercise-induced anaphylaxis. In addition, new epitopes have been suspected in cases of anaphylaxis to wheat isolates, a food ingredient consisting mainly of deamidated gluten proteins. As a microbial TG is included in many food technological processes, its safe use should be checked. This assessment must cover not only the safety of the TG itself but also that of the deamidated/cross-linked proteins generated by this enzyme. This article aims at discussing the possible consequences of using TG in food industry in the light of today knowledge about immune reactions to wheat.},

   abstract = {Following the application of simple serological tests for the diagnosis of coeliac disease (CD) in the 1980s, it gradually became clear that the prevalence of CD in different countries in the Middle East, North Africa and India is almost the same as that in Western countries. The prevalence of CD in at-risk populations in these regions is reported to range between 3 and 20% and the prevalence in people with type 1 diabetes is approximately 3-5%. Clinical manifestations of CD vary markedly with age, the duration and the extent of disease. Clinical studies showed that presentation with non-specific symptoms or no symptoms is as common in the Middle East as it is in Europe. Wheat has been the major staple food in these regions for many centuries and it is possible that the continuous and high level of exposure to wheat proteins has induced some degree of immune tolerance, leading to milder symptoms, which are misdiagnosed as irritable bowel syndrome or unexplained gastrointestinal disorders. A high index of suspicion for CD should be maintained in all developing countries for patients who present with chronic diarrhoea or iron deficiency anaemia. The best method for diagnosing CD in patients with diarrhoea is the panel of coeliac serological tests followed by small-bowel biopsy. In the absence of supplies for a gluten-free diet in Middle Eastern countries, maintaining this diet represents a real challenge to both patients and clinicians.},

   abstract = {BACKGROUND: Anti-Saccharomyces cerevisiae antibodies (ASCAs) are known to be positive in about 65% of Crohn's disease patients, in up to 43% of coeliac disease patients and in 0-5% of healthy controls. Coeliac disease might be an in-vivo model for unravelling the role of mucosal integrity in the formation of ASCAs since mucosal abnormalities normalize during a gluten-free diet (GFD). AIMS: Firstly, to evaluate, retrospectively, the frequency of ASCA positivity in coeliac patients both at diagnosis and during follow-up on a GFD. Secondly, to study the correlation between ASCA positivity and mucosal damage. METHODS: One hundred and eleven patients with histologically proven coeliac disease, positive endomysium antibodies on diagnosis and normalization of trans-glutaminase antibodies (t-TGAs) after successful adherence to a GFD were included. ASCAs, IgA and IgG were tested by enzyme-linked immunosorbent assays both at diagnosis and after the GFD. RESULTS: Eighty-three children and 28 adults were included in this study. The mean age at diagnosis was 4.6 years for children and 48 years for adults. At diagnosis 15/83 (18%) of children were ASCA positive (either IgG or IgA), compared to 17/28 (61%) of adults. After successful adherence to a GFD and normalization of t-TGAs only one child remained ASCA positive (1%) compared to eight adults (29%). Two out of 28 (7%) adults remained positive for both IgA and IgG ASCAs. CONCLUSION: In the majority of patients ASCAs disappeared during a GFD. In children this disappearance of ASCA positivity was more pronounced. This can be explained by the well-known fact that gut permeability normalizes much better in children than in adults. Also, the adults had higher levels of ASCAs at diagnosis. This was probably because they had been exposed to gluten for longer and therefore had more long-lasting damage.},

   abstract = {BACKGROUND: The prevalence of celiac disease (CD) is unknown in Chile. We have recently noted a rise in the number of cases diagnosed among adults. AIM: To describe the clinical characteristics of a group of adult celiac patients. PATIENTS AND METHODS: Clinical data of patients older than 15 years with positive antitransglutaminase or antiendomysial autoantibodies and a duodenal biopsy characteristic of CD were retrospectively reviewed. Age at diagnosis, symptoms and signs and laboratory, endoscopic and histological findings, were analyzed. RESULTS: Thirty seven patients (28 women), were studied. Median age at diagnosis was 41 years (range 15-69). Main symptoms and signs were diarrhea (78%), weight loss (38%) and abdominal pain (38%). Anemia was found in 49%, elevation of ESR in 57%, elevation of alkaline phosphatases in 54%, elevation of aspartate aminotransferase in 38% and a rise in alanine aminotransferase in 27%. Antiendomysial antibodies were positive in 17/22 (77%) and antitransglutaminase in 19/22 (86%) patients. Endoscopic findings were suggestive of CD in 47% of cases and duodenal biopsy showed intestinal villi atrophy in 34 (92%) patients. The three patients with normal histology had positive serology and a good response to gluten free diet. CONCLUSIONS: CD should be considered in the differential diagnosis of patients with unespecific digestive symptons, even when they present late in adult life. Serologic markers are a good diagnostic tool. A normal duodenal pathology does not exclude the diagnosis, if other diagnostic features are present.},

   abstract = {BACKGROUND & AIMS: By using colorimetric tests, reports have indicated that occult gastrointestinal bleeding is common in celiac disease. These results suggest that bleeding is a significant contributor to iron deficiency in this disorder and imply a significant inflammatory hemorrhagic component. Both these concepts are contrary to previous understanding of pathology of celiac disease. Furthermore, colorimetric tests provide an indirect and nonspecific assessment of blood loss. We therefore hypothesized that an accurate, quantitative, and specific method for blood loss, rather than a guaiac test, might give different findings. We report the results of stool blood loss measurement by using such a method. METHODS: We measured stool blood loss directly by using 51Cr radiolabeled red cells in 18 consecutive patients with celiac disease who consented to the study, 12 with total villous atrophy and 6 with partial villous atrophy, before initiation of a gluten-free diet. RESULTS: Average daily blood loss exceeded 1.5 mL in only 1 of 18 subjects. It is suspected, but unproven, that this subject had an alternate transient source of gastrointestinal bleeding. CONCLUSIONS: Colorimetric tests give a high prevalence of positive results for occult gastrointestinal blood loss in celiac disease, whereas the more specific and direct radiochromium method gives a low prevalence. These results suggest that bleeding is uncommon in celiac disease, and that positive results with colorimetric tests might be due to excess loss of intestinal cells and/or malabsorption of peroxidase-containing foods. Our results suggest that bleeding is not an important contributor to the iron deficiency often found in these subjects.},

   abstract = {Celiac Sprue is a widely prevalent immune disease of the small intestine induced by dietary gluten intake in genetically susceptible individuals. It has been suggested that prolyl endopeptidases (PEPs) may be useful catalysts for gluten detoxification. We have investigated this hypothesis using food-grade gluten as the target antigen, and a combination of mass spectrometry and patient-derived T cells as quantitative assay systems. Spectrometric characterization of physiologically proteolyzed gluten revealed a number of 10 to 50 residue peptides containing known T cell epitopes involved in Celiac Sprue pathogenesis. Several of these peptides were multivalent, suggesting they may be potent triggers of the inflammatory response to gluten in celiac patients. Treatment of proteolyzed gluten with recombinant bacterial PEP decreased the number of potentially immunostimulatory peptides. Substantially reduced immunogenicity was also quantified in 12 of 14 intestinal polyclonal T cell lines from celiac patients. Kinetic investigations using eight T cell clones showed rapid destruction of alpha-gliadin epitopes, but less complete processing of gamma-gliadin epitopes. Given the difficulty associated with a strict lifelong gluten-exclusion diet, the ability of a single enzyme to greatly reduce the antigenic burden of grocery store gluten reinforces the case for developing oral peptidase therapy against Celiac Sprue.},

   abstract = {AIM: Celiac disease is characterized by life-long gluten intolerance. Clinical features of patients with celiac disease are variable. Studies about the prevalence of celiac disease in our country are scarce and there is no study on the prevalence of celiac disease in southern Iran. In the current study, clinical, laboratory and histo-logical features of 52 patients with celiac disease were evaluated. METHODS: In a cross sectional study we retrospectively studied the characteristics of 52 celiac patients at Ahwaz JundiShapour University Hospitals (AJSUH) from November 1, 1999 to 1st Sep 2004. Intestinal biopsy and serum antigliadin and anti-endomysium antibodies were used for the diagnosis of patients. Mucosal lesions were classified according to the criteria of Marsh. Antigliadin antibodies were measured with a commercial enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay. Anti-endomysium antibodies were analyzed by indirect immunofluorescence with the use of a section of monkey esophagus. Routine hematological and biochemical analyses and measurement of immunoglobulin levels were undertaken. RESULTS: Male: female ratio was 1.08. The mean +/- SD patient age was 21 +/- 4.5 years (range 10-70 years) and the most common symptoms were diarrhea and weight loss (78.8%) followed by fatigue (73.1%), pallor (65.4%), anorexia (40.4%), abdominal distention (32.7%), and failure to thrive (23.1%). Diarrhea and weight loss and fatigue were the most common findings. Iron deficiency anemia was found in 63.2% of patients and this became normal after adoption of a gluten-free diet in all patients. Immunoglobulin A, IgG antigliadin antibodies and IgA anti-endomysium antibodies were found in 33 and 48 cases, 78.8% and 85.4% of patients, respectively. Biopsy of the small intestine revealed that 90.4% of patients had typical lesions according to the Marsh classification. CONCLUSION: Although classical presentation was seen in most of the patients, atypical clinical manifestations of celiac disease should be kept in mind. In particular, patients with uncommon findings, such as short stature, and iron-deficiency anemia, should be screened for celiac disease. Further epidemiological studies in our area in the general population and in high risk groups seem to be indicated.},

   abstract = {BACKGROUND: Refractory sprue (RS) is a rare and severe celiac-like enteropathy not responding to a strict gluten-free diet. Although prognosis is generally poor, little is known about the long-term outcome of patients. AIM: to report baseline characteristics and long-term outcome of a series of patients diagnosed and treated in a single institution. MATERIALS: We report a retrospective cohort of 25 consecutive patients (15 females; mean age 46 yr; range 28-71) diagnosed with RS based on the presence of a non-responsive celiac-like enteropathy. All patients were intensively treated with a gluten-free diet, steroids, nutritional support and immunosupression. RESULTS: Clinical and biological characteristics of patients suggest that, at least, 24 patients had clear evidences of celiac disease. HLA DQ2/DQ8 genes were present in all the 24 patients typed and autoimmune enteropathy was excluded in all. According to the genotyping, 12 patients had a polyclonal lymphocyte population (RS type I) and 13 exhibited monoclonal TCR-gamma gene rearrangements (RS type II). Sixteen patients had evidence of ulcerative jejunitis (UJ) (7 in RS type I and 9 in type II). Overall median follow-up time after diagnosis of RS was 29 mo/patient (range 7 to 204) (45 mo for type I and 24 mo for type II). Overall mortality was 48% (12 patients), 6 in each type. Eight patients with UJ (50%), 3 with lymphoma (two T-cell and one B-cell type) and 4 (44%) without ulcers died during follow-up. The causes of death were sepsis in the context of a progressive deterioration but without overt malignancies (n=5), vascular causes (n=3) and severe malnutrition (n=1). Three- and 5-yr survival rate after diagnosis of RS for the overall population was 60% and 56%. There was no differences between type I (67%, 58%) and type II RS patients (54% for both periods). Patients with UJ had lower but non-significant 3- and 5-yr survival rates (56% and 50%, respectively) compared with patients without ulcers (78% and 66%). Survivors had a favorable outcome. While 11 patients persists asymptomatic, two other cases still have mild diarrhea and one low body weight. CONCLUSIONS: We confirm that RS is a severe celiac disease-related disorder with very high mortality. Diagnosis of overt lymphoma (12%) in our long-term follow-up was not as frequent as was reported by other groups. A proportion of patients persist in good health for a long time irrespective of the nature of the IEL infiltration or the presence of UJ.},

   abstract = {Coeliac disease is a lifelong intolerance to the gluten found in wheat, barley and rye, and some patients are also sensitive to oats. The disease is genetically determined, with 10% of the first-degree relatives affected and 75% of monozygotic twins being concordant. Of the patients with coeliac disease 95% are human leucocyte antigen (HLA)-DQ2 or HLA-DQ8 positive. Characteristically, the jejunal mucosa becomes damaged by a T-cell-mediated autoimmune response that is thought to be initiated by a 33-mer peptide fragment in A2 gliadin, and patients with this disorder have raised levels of anti-endomysium and tissue transglutaminase antibodies in their blood. Coeliac disease is the major diagnosable food intolerance and, with the advent of a simple blood test for case finding, prevalence rates are thought to be approximately 1:100. Classically, the condition presented with malabsorption and failure to thrive in infancy, but this picture has now been overtaken by the much more common presentation in adults, usually with non-specific symptoms such as tiredness and anaemia, disturbance in bowel habit or following low-impact bone fractures. Small intestinal biopsy is necessary for diagnosis and shows a characteristically flat appearance with crypt hypoplasia and infiltration of the epithelium with lymphocytes. Diet is the key to management and a gluten-free diet effectively cures the condition. However, this commitment is lifelong and many aisles in the supermarket are effectively closed to individuals with coeliac disease. Compliance can be monitored by measuring antibodies in blood, which revert to negative after 6-9 months. Patients with minor symptoms, who are found incidentally to have coeliac disease, often ask whether it is necessary to adhere to the diet. Current advice is that dietary adherence is necessary to avoid the long-term complications, which are, principally, osteoporosis and small bowel lymphoma. However, risk of these complications diminishes very considerably in patients who are on a gluten-free diet.},

   abstract = {BACKGROUND: Detecting serum antibody against inhaled antigens is an important diagnostic adjunct for hypersensitivity pneumonitis (HP). We sought to validate a quantitative fluorimetric assay testing serum from bird fanciers. METHODS: Antibody activity was assessed in bird fanciers and control subjects using various avian antigens and serological methods, and the titer was compared with symptoms of HP. RESULTS: IgG antibody against pigeon serum antigens, quantified by fluorimetry, provided a good discriminator of disease. Levels below 10 mg/L were insignificant, and increasing titers were associated with disease. The assay was unaffected by total IgG, autoantibodies and antibody to dietary hen's egg antigens. Antigens from pigeon serum seem sufficient to recognize immune sensitivity to most common pet avian species. Decreasing antibody titers confirmed antigen avoidance. CONCLUSION: Increasing antibody titer reflected the likelihood of HP, and decreasing titers confirmed antigen avoidance. Quantifying antibody was rapid and the increased sensitivity will improve the rate of false-negative reporting and obviate the need for invasive diagnostic procedures. Automated fluorimetry provides a method for the international standardization of HP serology thereby improving quality control and improving its suitability as a diagnostic adjunct.},

   abstract = {Screening studies indicate a prevalence of coeliac disease (CD) of up to 1% in populations of European ancestry, yet the majority of cases remain undiagnosed. Serological markers for CD now available have high sensitivity and specificity, offering the option of mass population screening. The principles of disease screening as set out by Wilson and Jugner can be applied to CD to predict whether this is appropriate. CD is an important health problem for the individual and the community because of high prevalence, associated specific and non-specific morbidity, and long-term complications of which the most important are gut malignancy and osteoporosis. However, recent studies indicate that the prevalence of malignancy and the health impact of osteoporosis are much less than previously supposed, so the prophylactic benefits of early diagnosis through screening may be low. While CD has an accepted and effective treatment, dietary gluten exclusion, this is difficult for the individual and asymptomatic cases may be poorly motivated to comply. Diagnosis of CD is by histological confirmation on duodenal biopsy. We now recognise milder degrees of gluten sensitive enteropathy without villous atrophy (Marsh I, II lesions) and the benefits to the individual by identifying these early lesions through screening is unknown: whether to treat such individuals needs to be agreed before programmes commence. Screening with serum antibodies is relatively non-invasive but may have to be repeated during each individual's lifetime. HLA typing beforehand to identify the 30% of the population with DQ2 or DQ8, who are at potential risk of CD, will allow one-off exclusion of a large percentage of the population but like all genetic testing has ethical implications. The economic costs of screening and treatment versus morbidity prevented have not been calculated.},

   abstract = {OBJECTIVE: A screening program was proposed for the village of Carcare (population 5700), located in a region of Italy with an apparently low prevalence of coeliac disease (CD): only 1 patient diagnosed out of 2557 inhabitants. The study group comprised 1002 individuals (568 F, 434 M, age range 13-90 years) recruited from blood donors, secondary school pupils and people referred to the local outpatient facilities for routine blood chemistry. MATERIAL AND METHODS: Total IgA, IgA anti-tissue transglutaminase (tTG) (ELISA, recombinant human antigen) and IgA antiendomysium (EMA) (IFI, umbilical cord substrate) antibodies were measured in the serum of all participants. All patients with IgA deficiency were investigated for IgG tTG antibodies, and in the case of disagreement between tTG and EMA, they were typed for HLA DQ2-DQ8 haplotypes. RESULTS: Thirteen subjects were positive and 988 negative for autoantibodies (3/988 had IgA deficiency). One serum sample was positive for tTG antibodies but negative for EMA. Ten out of 13 positive subjects consented to undergo duodenal biopsy, which invariably produced evidence of CD despite the absence of clinical signs/symptoms. A post-diagnostic clinical investigation provided evidence showing mild iron deficiency (4 subjects) and osteoporosis (2 subjects). After counselling, all subjects accepted a gluten-free diet. CONCLUSIONS: The prevalence of CD in the study group was 1:100 (1.0%; 95% CI: 0.5-1.8%): this indicates that CD is largely underdiagnosed in Carcare. Our results suggest that the low prevalence of CD observed in some regions is likely to be due to underdiagnosis.},

   abstract = {OBJECTIVE: Analytical methods for measurements of gluten in the low level range of 20-200 ppm of gluten, as required for gluten-free food, have never been endorsed by the Codex Alimentarius. With the aim of investigating standardized and reliable methods for the detection of gliadin in food with detection limits lower than 200 ppm, as proposed by the Codex Alimentarius, the Working Group on Prolamin Analysis and Toxicity (WGPAT) coordinated a large collaborative study to validate a monoclonal antibody based ELISA, which uses an antibody (R5) against rye secalins. METHODS: Twelve food samples in which gliadin was present in the range of 0-168 ppm were analysed with two different commercially available R5 ELISA tests and a special extraction solvent, based on a reducing and a dissociating agent designed to extract heat denatured proteins. Twenty laboratories participated in this study. RESULTS: Recovery values ranged from 65 to 110% in general. The repeatability (RSDr) and reproducibility (RSDR) figures ranged between 13 and 25, resp. 23 and 47 for one test, and between 11 and 22, resp. 25 and 33 for the other. CONCLUSION: Both assays are comparable and robust. The repeatability and reproducibility data are in a range that is acceptable for ELISAs. Kits from both suppliers fulfilled performance criteria of regular ELISA methods, and it is shown that both ELISA kits guarantee a sensitivity of 1.5 ppm gliadin for gluten-free food.},

   abstract = {Celiac disease is an intestinal inflammatory disorder induced by dietary gluten in genetically susceptible individuals. The mechanisms underlying the massive expansion of interferon gamma-producing intraepithelial cytotoxic T lymphocytes (CTLs) and the destruction of the epithelial cells lining the small intestine of celiac patients have remained elusive. We report massive oligoclonal expansions of intraepithelial CTLs that exhibit a profound genetic reprogramming of natural killer (NK) functions. These CTLs aberrantly expressed cytolytic NK lineage receptors, such as NKG2C, NKp44, and NKp46, which associate with adaptor molecules bearing immunoreceptor tyrosine-based activation motifs and induce ZAP-70 phosphorylation, cytokine secretion, and proliferation independently of T cell receptor signaling. This NK transformation of CTLs may underlie both the self-perpetuating, gluten-independent tissue damage and the uncontrolled CTL expansion leading to malignant lymphomas in severe forms of celiac disease. Because similar changes were detected in a subset of CTLs from cytomegalovirus-seropositive patients, we suggest that a stepwise transformation of CTLs into NK-like cells may underlie immunopathology in various chronic infectious and inflammatory diseases.},

   abstract = {Man ingests food to mitigate hunger (mediated by physiological and biochemical signals), satisfy appetite (subjective sensation) and because of psychosocial reasons. Satiation biomarkers (stop feeding) are gastric distention and hormones (CCK, GLP-1) and satiety biomarkers (induce feeding) are food-induced thermogenesis, body temperature, glycaemia and also hormones (insulin, leptin and ghrelin). Oxidative metabolism/body composition, tryptophan/serotonin and proinflammatory cytokines are also implicated on hunger physiology. At the present time, ghrelin is the only known circulating orexigenic with potential on hunger/body weight regulation. It is a neuropeptide (endogenous ligand for the GH secretagogue) recently isolated from the oxyntic mucosa and synthesized mainly in the stomach. Its blood concentration depends on diet, hyperglucemia and adiposity/leptin. It is secreted 1-2 hours preprandially and its concentration decreases drastically during the postprandium. Ghrelin acts on the lateral hypothalamus and theoretically inhibits proinflammatory cytokine secretion and antagonizes leptin. Ghrelin physiologically increases food intake and stimulates adipogenesis, gastrointestinal motility and gastric acid secretion, and has other hormonal and cardiovascular functions. Ghrelin blood concentration is reduced in massive obesity, non-alcoholic steatohepatitis, polycystic ovary syndrome, acromegaly, hypogonadism, ageing, short bowel syndrome and rheumatoid arthritis; and increased in primary or secondary anorexia, starvation, chronic liver disease and celiac disease. Cerebral and peritoneal ghrelin administration (rats) and systemic administration (rats and healthy volunteers, cancer patients or patients on peritoneal dialysis) promotes food consumption and increases adiposity, of utmost importance in the treatment of patients with anorexia.},

   abstract = {Duplex scanning of mesenteric arteries was developed in the late 1980s. It's primary clinical application is to identify high-grade stenoses in the superior mesenteric artery (SMA) and celiac artery that may be associated with the clinical condition of chronic mesenteric ischemia. A peak systolic velocity of >275 cm/s in the SMA identifies a >70% SMA stenosis with a sensitivity of 92%, a positive predictive value of 80% and a negative predictive value of 99%. A negative mesenteric duplex study therefore virtually excludes the presence of clinically important mesenteric artery stenosis. A positive study requires confirmation with an additional imaging study prior to mesenteric artery reconstruction. Other applications of mesenteric duplex scanning include identification of reversible compression of the celiac artery, follow-up of mesenteric bypass grafts and physiological studies of the intestinal circulation.},

   abstract = {BACKGROUND AND AIMS: Celiac disease is a prevalent disorder characterized by a chronic intestinal inflammation driven by HLA-DQ2 or -DQ8-restricted T cells specific for ingested wheat gluten peptides. The dominant T-cell responses are to epitopes that cluster within a stable 33mer fragment formed by physiologic digestion of distinct alpha-gliadins. Celiac disease is treated by excluding all gluten proteins from the diet. Conceivably, a diet based on baking-quality gluten from a wheat species that expresses no or few T-cell stimulatory gluten peptides should be equally well tolerated by the celiac patients and, importantly, also be beneficial for disease prevention. METHODS: To identify baking quality, harmless wheat, we followed the evolution of the wheat back to the species that most likely have contributed the AA, BB, and DD genomes to the bread wheat. Gluten were extracted from a large collection of these ancient wheat species and screened for T-cell stimulatory gluten peptides. RESULTS: Distinct differences in the intestinal T-cell responses to the diploid species were identified. Interestingly, we found that the fragments identical or equivalent to the immunodominant 33mer fragment are encoded by alpha-gliadin genes on the wheat chromosome 6D and thus absent from gluten of diploid einkorn (AA) and even certain cultivars of the tetraploid (AABB) pasta wheat. CONCLUSIONS: These findings have implications for celiac disease because they raise the prospect of identifying or producing by breeding wheat species with low or absent levels of harmful gluten proteins.},

   abstract = {Celiac disease (CD) is characterized by a chronic immune reaction in the small intestine to the gluten proteins that are present in a (Western) daily diet. Besides the well known involvement of the HLA class II histocompatibility antigen (HLA)-DQ2.5 and -DQ8 heterodimers (encoded by particular combinations of the HLA-DQA1 and -DQB1 gene) in CD and the minor contribution of the CTLA-4 gene, recently the myosin IXB (MYO9B) gene has also been found to be genetically associated. This review covers the general aspects of CD as well as current insight into important molecular aspects. We evaluate the role of susceptibility genes in CD by following gluten along its path from ingestion to uptake in the body, which leads us through the three aspects of CD's pathology. The first is the presence of gluten in the lumen of the intestine, where it is broken down by several enzymes. The second is the intestinal barrier through which gluten peptides pass. The third is the reaction of the immune system in response to gluten peptides, in which both the innate and the adaptive immune systems play a role. Our main conclusion, based on the current genetic and functional studies, is that we should look for causal genes in the barrier function as well as in the immune systems.},

   abstract = {Glutenfree diet is recommended for all coeliacs. There are almost no data on effective means of monitoring coeliacs. Some consider a decrease in antibody titer as an indication of dietary adherence. A recent American pediatric guideline suggests that additional biopsies are not recommended. The UEGW group about adult coeliacs advises a second biopsy after one year. The required normalisation has not been defined. Serology does not indicate complete mucosal recovery and cannot substitute for follow-up biopsy. Biopsy findings may not always be as conclusive as is imaging in explaining persistent complaints in coeliacs. Treating almost daily refractory coeliacs on their way to EATL, we suggest mucosal recovery is the only protection against such complications, especially in coeliacs diagnosed above the age of 50, so-called old-age coeliacs. A body of published data is mandatory to see if full mucosal recovery is required and is achievable. In countries where gluten-free products are not easily available as in Eastern Europe or the Middle East, this might be extremely difficult for the coeliacs, their doctors and dietitians.},

   abstract = {Large-scale screening studies on CD have been published and suggest a prevalence of CD in USA, Europe, Middle-East and Australia of about 1:100. The costs of finding coeliacs hasn't been discussed in these studies. Coeliac disease can be classified to be an important health problem. It might be relevant to have a low threshold for biopsies when screening for coeliac disease. Screening asymptomatics may be harmful for individuals. A lifelong gluten-free diet is not easy to maintain and quality of life may deteriorate. In countries familiar with coeliac disease, the classic pattern of severe malabsorption and cachexia, as described in textbooks, has become rare. CD is not borne in minds of doctors diagnosing dyspepsia and/or irritable bowel disease, or associated auto-immune diseases. The consequence is a delay in diagnosis, with secondary problems as long term auto-immune stimulation, osteoporosis and secondary malignancies. Enteropathy associated T-cell lymphomas are well known, but considering coeliac disease in T-cell lymphomas presenting outside the GE-tract is uncommon. Nation-wide screening programmes have not started, which are common for phenylketonury and other metabolic defects. It is debatable whether coeliacs found by screening adhere to a gluten-free diet similar to symptomatic coeliacs. Whether a gluten-free diet is of benefit to this subgroup is controversial.},

   abstract = {A continuing flow of new scientific developments concerning coeliac disease in the last decade asks for the formulation of new concepts of pathophysiology and clinical considerations. Immunogenetic studies have shown a correlation of the disease to the HLA region on the short arm of chromosome 6, immunological research has led to the concept of a T-cell driven immunologic response of the small intestine, with the identification of highly sensitive and specific antibodies. The understanding of the histopathology of coeliac disease has changed dramatically, initiated by the proposition of a spectrum of gluten sensitive enteropathy by Marsh in 1992. Clinical studies report a significant change in patient characteristics and epidemiology. The incidence of the disease has shifted to a majority of adult coeliacs, the disease may present with less severe symptoms of malabsorption and the screening studies suggest an overall prevalence of up to 1 in 200-300. Histopathology has been standardized; lymphocytic enteritis (Marsh I), lymphocytic enteritis with crypthyperplasia (Marsh II), and villous atrophy, subdivided in partial, subtotal and total (Marsh IIIABC). Special attention is given to a subgroup of 'refractory coeliacs', including the identification of pre-malignant T-cells in the intestinal mucosa. The management of coeliacs primarely consists of monitoring for compliance and complications. Dietetic and medical associations need to establish protocols and offer additional training to undergraduetes, internships, general practitioners and other allied health professionals. It might be relevant to have a low threshold for intestinal biopsies. However, screening asymptomatics may be harmful for individuals. Research is needed to assess the benefits of mass-screening in the future. HLA analysis can contribute towards recognising populations at increased risk.},

METHODS: We have studied all patients accrued over a 4-year period with increased duodenal IELs. Those patients were recalled for biological and immunological evaluation and a second endoscopy. RESULTS: Twenty-three from a total of 639 patients were identified and 17 of them were included in the study. The median duodenal IEL count was 59 per 100 epithelial cells. Twelve (71%) patients were HP+; eight of them received HP eradication. At the second endoscopy the duodenal IEL count was significantly lower 2 months after HP eradication (73 versus 28), while the IEL count was unchanged in those patients seronegative for HP (n = 5) or those in whom it was not eradicated (n = 4) (55 versus 55). No patient had coeliac antibodies, four expressed HLA-DQ2, lower than in the general population, and the prevalence of CD was 2% (12/639 patients). CONCLUSION: In some cases an increased duodenal IEL count may be due to an inappropriate host response to HP. HP screening and eradication should be considered before recommending a gluten-free diet.},

   abstract = {PURPOSE: To draw attention to the triad of coeliac disease (CD), occipital calcifications, and drug-resistant epilepsy, with focus on the outcome of epilepsy surgery. METHODS: We describe a male patient who despite a diagnosis of CD from the age of 9 did not comply with the gluten-free diet. At the age of 11 he developed simple and complex partial seizures with visual symptoms, anxiety, and ambulatory automatisms. His epilepsy appeared to be drug resistant, and after having tried nine antiepileptic drugs (AEDs), alone or in combinations, he underwent a presurgical evaluation at the age of 30. Interictal standard electroencephalograms (EEGs) disclosed frequent biparieto-occipital epileptiform discharges. Computed tomography showed cortical-subcortical punctate calcifications in the right parieto-occipital region, where his seizures seemed to start, according to ictal EEG registrations from intracranial strip electrodes. RESULTS: At the age of 31 he underwent epilepsy surgery. A 5 x 6 cm large area of the right parieto-occipital region was resected, including the area with calcifications. Except for a few short-lasting episodes of anxiety (simple partial seizures?) he has now been seizure-free for 12 years. AEDs were withdrawn 5 years ago. Postoperatively he was left with an upper left-sided quadrant anopsia, which is not bothering him. CONCLUSIONS: In patients with CD, unilateral occipital calcifications, and drug-resistant epilepsy, epilepsy surgery should be considered, as a lesionectomy might be very successful.},

   abstract = {BACKGROUND: Early diagnosis and treatment with gluten-free diet reduces mortality and the prevalence of associated disorders in celiac disease (CD). A simple "in the office" test of anti-transglutaminase antibodies might be of great help in first-line screening for CD. AIMS: We evaluated the sensitivity and specificity of two commercial kits based, respectively, on rapid detection of IgA-IgG anti-human-transglutaminase antibodies (anti-h-tTG) in serum and IgA anti-h-tTG antibody in one drop of whole blood. These assays were compared to a well-established enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay technique. METHODS: Serum samples were analyzed from 114 biopsy-confirmed celiacs, 120 healthy controls, 20 first-degree relatives of celiacs, and 75 diseased controls. The whole blood samples were analyzed from 51 biopsy-confirmed celiacs and 100 controls. RESULTS: The serum-based test was positive in all 114 celiacs (sensitivity 100%). Among the controls there were seven healthy blood donors, one first-degree relative, and three diseased controls who tested positive (specificity 94.9%). The blood drop-based assay testing IgA antibodies was positive in 46 of 51 (sensitivity 90.2%), and since three of the five patients testing negative had total IgA deficiency, the sensitivity value can be increased to 95.8%. All 100 controls tested negative (specificity 100%). CONCLUSIONS: The commercial kits described here produce high values of sensitivity and specificity, offering the general practitioner who suspects a possible case of CD the real possibility to look for anti-h-tTG antibodies in his own medical office during a standard visit at a satisfyingly low cost.},

METHOD: The authors assess 132 participants from 3 to 57 years of age (M = 19.3 years) affected by CD for the possibility of an associated ADHD-like symptomatology, using the Conner Scale Hypescheme, a behavioral scale similar to the Conners Rating Scales, before their gluten-free diet was started and 6 months later. RESULTS: The overall score improves significantly as well as most of the ADHD-like symptomatology specific features (Bonferroni-corrected, paired-sample t tests). CONCLUSION: The data indicate that ADHD-like symptomatology is markedly overrepresented among untreated CD patients and that a gluten-free diet may improve symptoms significantly within a short period of time. The results of this study also suggest that CD should be included in the list of diseases associated with ADHD-like symptomatology.},

   abstract = {CONTEXT: While gluten ingestion is responsible for the signs and symptoms of celiac disease, it is not known what factors are associated with initial appearance of the disease. OBJECTIVE: To examine whether the timing of gluten exposure in the infant diet was associated with the development of celiac disease autoimmunity (CDA). DESIGN, SETTING, AND PATIENTS: Prospective observational study conducted in Denver, Colo, from 1994-2004 of 1560 children at increased risk for celiac disease or type 1 diabetes, as defined by possession of either HLA-DR3 or DR4 alleles, or having a first-degree relative with type 1 diabetes. The mean follow-up was 4.8 years. MAIN OUTCOME MEASURE: Risk of CDA defined as being positive for tissue transglutaminase (tTG) autoantibody on 2 or more consecutive visits or being positive for tTG once and having a positive small bowel biopsy for celiac disease, by timing of introduction of gluten-containing foods into the diet. RESULTS: Fifty-one children developed CDA. Findings adjusted for HLA-DR3 status indicated that children exposed to foods containing wheat, barley, or rye (gluten-containing foods) in the first 3 months of life (3 [6%] CDA positive vs 40 [3%] CDA negative) had a 5-fold increased risk of CDA compared with children exposed to gluten-containing foods at 4 to 6 months (12 [23%] CDA positive vs 574 [38%] CDA negative) (hazard ratio [HR], 5.17; 95% confidence interval [CI], 1.44-18.57). Children not exposed to gluten until the seventh month or later (36 [71%] CDA positive vs 895 [59%] CDA negative) had a marginally increased risk of CDA compared with those exposed at 4 to 6 months (HR, 1.87; 95% CI, 0.97-3.60). After restricting our case group to only the 25 CDA-positive children who had biopsy-diagnosed celiac disease, initial exposure to wheat, barley, or rye in the first 3 months (3 [12%] CDA positive vs 40 [3%] CDA negative) or in the seventh month or later (19 [76%] CDA positive vs 912 [59%] CDA negative) significantly increased risk of CDA compared with exposure at 4 to 6 months (3 [12%] CDA positive vs 583 [38%] CDA negative) (HR, 22.97; 95% CI, 4.55-115.93; P = .001; and HR, 3.98; 95% CI, 1.18-13.46; P = .04, respectively). CONCLUSION: Timing of introduction of gluten into the infant diet is associated with the appearance of CDA in children at increased risk for the disease.},

   abstract = {UNLABELLED: The aim of this study was to evaluate the concept that pancreatic dysfunction in patients having gluten sensitivity (celiac disease [CD]) or cow's milk protein enteropathy (CMPE) may result from the lack of pancreatic enzyme stimulation in the absence or decrease of cholecystokinin (CCK) secretion caused by villous atrophy. PATIENTS AND METHODS: The following parameters were measured: plasma CCK in response to a fatty meal and human pancreatic fecal elastase in 24 patients with CD while on gluten-free diet and after gluten provocation and in 12 patients with CMPE at diagnosis and after a 6-month period of cow's milk-free diet. Intestinal mucosa morphology was examined by small bowel biopsy. Sixty-three controls having no organic gastrointestinal problems were investigated once at the time of diagnostic evaluation. RESULTS: Fasting CCK, obtained at a time when patients with CD or CMPE had normal intestinal mucosa, was significantly different from postprandial and comparable to that of the control group. Fasting CCK obtained from patients with villous atrophy was also statistically different, but not significantly, from the postprandial. Fasting and postprandial plasma CCK and fecal pancreatic elastase values from patients having normal intestinal mucosa were significantly higher than those obtained from patients with villous atrophy. Significant correlation of intestinal mucosa morphology and CCK with fecal elastase concentration was documented. CONCLUSION: Exocrine pancreatic dysfunction in individuals having villous atrophy may be the consequence of decreased CCK secretion. Cholecystokinin and pancreatic secretion is restored to normal, with intestinal mucosa regeneration.},

   abstract = {BACKGROUND/AIMS: Acquired lactase deficiency is a common cause of gastrointestinal symptoms but its etiology remains unclear. Celiac disease could lead to lactase deficiency and is much more common than previously suspected. Several studies have highlighted the prevalence of lactose intolerance in celiac disease, but studies assessing the prevalence of celiac disease in lactose intolerance are lacking. We evaluated the prevalence of celiac disease in patients with a positive H2-lactose breath test compared to a control group. METHODS: This retrospective study included 54 patients (15 males/39 females; mean age 37.8 +/- 7 years) from southern Italy, referred to the Gastroenterology Unit for bloating and diarrhea after the introduction of milk or dietary lactose. They had a positive H2-lactose breath test and a negative H2-glucose breath test. 50 blood donors were drawn from a similar population, matched for sex and age, and enrolled as a control group. All patients were screened for possible celiac disease by measuring the serum level of IgA antibodies to endomysium, anti-transglutaminase and total IgA. Patients positive for at least one of these markers were submitted to upper gastrointestinal endoscopy. RESULTS: None of the patients had a IgA deficiency. 24% of the patients showed positivity of celiac disease antibodies compared to 2% in the control group (p < 0.001). Histologic samples of these patients showed villous atrophy (53.8% Marsh type IIIa, 38.4% Marsh IIIb, and 7.6% with Marsh type IIIc) confirming the celiac disease, while in the control subjects duodenal biopsies were normal. CONCLUSIONS: A high prevalence of celiac disease was observed in patients with a positive H2-lactose breath test compared to healthy controls. In these subjects lactase deficiency seems to be the only manifestation of celiac disease. We suggest serologic screening for celiac disease in all patients with a positive H2-lactose breath test before beginning a milk-exclusion diet.},

   abstract = {BACKGROUND & AIMS: Patients with celiac disease (CD) who do not improve or exhibit villous atrophy on a gluten-free diet may have type 1 refractory CD (RCD) with a polyclonal mucosal T-cell infiltrate, or type 2 RCD with a monoclonal infiltrate, also termed cryptic T-cell lymphoma. Both conditions are difficult to treat. Here we describe the effects of a nonimmunogenic elemental diet on clinical symptoms and mucosal immunopathology in type 1 RCD. METHODS: Ten CD patients on a strict gluten-free diet were diagnosed with type 1 RCD after extensive clinical evaluation in a tertiary referral hospital. A 4-week amino-acid-based liquid elemental diet regimen was given with no other treatment, except in 1 patient who also received methotrexate. Duodenal biopsy specimens were obtained before and after treatment for histologic assessment, immunophenotyping of intraepithelial lymphocytes, T-cell receptor clonality, mucosal interleukin (IL)-15 expression, flow-cytometric analysis of interferon (IFN)-gamma-secreting T cells, and whole biopsy specimen IFN-gamma messenger RNA determination. RESULTS: Nine patients completed the treatment; however, 1 patient did not tolerate the diet. Histologic improvement and reduced epithelial IL-15 were seen in 8 patients, whereas IFN-gamma-secreting mucosal T cells and IFN-gamma messenger RNA levels decreased in 4 and 7 patients, respectively. Clinical improvement was noted in 6 patients, with 1 patient showing normalization of hypoalbuminemia. Three patients could discontinue their total parenteral nutrition. CONCLUSIONS: Persistent mucosal IFN-gamma and IL-15 production often occurs in type 1 RCD despite conventional treatment. Elemental diet is a therapeutic option that can provide long-term immunopathologic and clinical improvement of this difficult condition.},

We evaluated the frequency of coeliac disease anti-endomysial (or anti-transglutaminase) antibodies in patients with recurrent aphthous stomatitis. Blood samples from 42 patients were evaluated and 2/42 (4.7%) were IgA- and IgG-endomysial antibody-positive. None of the 42 persons in the control group had antibodies, which was not statistically different from the patient group. The two antibody-positive patients had episodes of mild gastrointestinal symptoms only, but histopathology of duodenal mucous membranes confirmed coeliac disease. All symptoms related to aphthous stomatitis responded well to a gluten-free diet. We conclude that every patient with recurrent aphthous stomatitis should be asked about a history of gastrointestinal complaints and screened for markers of coeliac disease, since recurrent aphthous stomatitis may in some cases respond to a gluten-free diet.},

   abstract = {BACKGROUND: Anaemia caused by iron deficiency is one of the most common disorders in the world. We describe a patient with iron deficiency anaemia in whom absorption was limited due to celiac disease, superimposed to chronic blood loss due to the blue rubber bleb nevus syndrome, a rare syndrome characterised by multiple cutaneous venous malformations in association with visceral lesions. CASE REPORT: A 54-year-old patient with severe iron deficiency anaemia showed marked rubbery cutaneous lesions on the body surface, extremities, under and on the left side of the tongue as well as in the stomach and duodenum. The appearance and pathological examination of the lesions were consistent with the diagnosis of blue rubber bleb nevus syndrome (BRBNS). Biopsy of the mucosa of the duodenum showed celiac disease. No association between celiac disease and BRBNS has been previously described. CONCLUSION: Combined loss of iron and malabsorption from the gastrointestinal tract can lead to severe iron deficiency. Early recognition of both diseases can result in early treatment. Patients can recover completely with iron suppletion and a gluten-free diet. Recognising typical BRBNS skin lesions would provide a potential diagnosis and could prevent unnecessary procedures or invasive surgery.},

His body mass index (BMI) at presentation was 37.2 kg/m2 (>99.9th centile). Both antigliadin and anti-endomysial antibodies were positive, and coeliac disease was diagnosed by jejunal biopsy. His diarrhoea ceased and the gliadin and endomysial antibodies disappeared after starting gluten-free diet. At 17 y, his BMI increased to 42.7 kg/m2 despite dietary support. CONCLUSION: Obesity in a child does not exclude the diagnosis of coeliac disease, especially if presenting with suggestive symptoms.},

   abstract = {BACKGROUND: Antiendomysium antibodies have a high sensitivity and specificity for celiac disease. A small percentage of subjects positive for these antibodies have a small intestinal mucosa hitherto considered normal. OBJECTIVES: The aim of this study was to characterize the clinical, serological, immunogenetic, and immunohistological features of these subjects. METHODS: From 409 patients who were positive for celiac-related antibodies, we selected 24 (5.9%) patients who had an architecturally normal small intestinal mucosa. One hundred age-matched celiac patients with a "flat" small intestinal mucosa, and 50 age-matched nonceliac children were also studied. The number of CD3+ and gammadelta+ intraepithelial lymphocytes and of CD25+ lamina propria mononuclear cells, and the expression of crypt HLA-DR and lamina propria ICAM-1 were assessed. HLA haplotyping was also performed. RESULTS: Eleven (45.8%) of the 24 patients had a distinct infiltrative pattern, i.e., an increase in CD3+ intraepithelial lymphocytes (> 2SD of the nonceliac group), whereas 17 (70.8%) had a higher density of intraepithelial gammadelta+ cells. In 17 (70.8%) patients, the number of lamina propria CD25+ cells was increased and/or the expression of ICAM-1 and crypt HLA-DR was enhanced. All 24 patients carried the celiac disease-associated HLA haplotypes. Two of the six patients who remained on a normal diet and underwent a second jejunal biopsy developed villous atrophy. CONCLUSIONS: Most of the patients with serum antiendomysium antibodies and normal jejunal histology showed immunohistochemical signs of immune activation in the epithelium, lamina propria, and crypts. We recommend that such patients be monitored to assess their progress and to determine whether they need a gluten-free diet.},

The anthropometric parameters were expressed as Z scores relative to National Centre for Health Statistics standards using Epi Info 2000 (weight-for-height Z score (WHZ) and height-for-age Z score (HAZ)). Catch-up growth was evaluated by repeated measures. ANOVA, overall significance by an F test and pair-wise comparisons for estimated marginal means using the least significant difference. At the time of enrolment, no significant difference was observed in WHZ and HAZ between children diagnosed before (group 1) or after (group 2) 4 years of age. On follow-up, HAZ was significantly higher in group 1 after the first and third years of the GFD (P=0.04 and 0.02, respectively), with a non-significant increase after completing 4 years of the GFD (P=0.22). Feeding the GFD resulted in an overall significant (F=3.99, P=0.011) increase in HAZ up to 4 years of follow-up. However, the catch-up in height was incomplete, with stunting in sixteen (55.4%) of twenty-nine children after 3 years and in seven (46.6%) of fifteen children after 4 years on the GFD. Pair-wise comparisons demonstrated a linear catch-up growth during the initial follow-up on GFD. Treatment with the GFD did not result in an overall significant increase in WHZ up to 4 years of follow-up (F=1.01, P=0.42). Our results suggest that, in children with late-diagnosed coeliac disease, treatment with a GFD leads to a normalisation of body mass and a significant but incomplete recovery in HAZ during 4 years of follow-up.},

   abstract = {Recently, an atypical form of celiac disease (CD) has been identified, in which gastrointestinal symptoms are less pronounced. Other organs can be more or less severely affected, and the disease might be unrecognized and undiagnosed. In some cases, hypertransaminasemia has been indicated as the first symptom of CD in infancy. A direct relationship between liver damage and glutensensitivity has been proven by the disappearance of biochemical signs and histological lesions of the liver after the initiation of the gluten-free diet. The present case report is of a 14-year-old girl affected by CD and severe hepatic failure who underwent a liver transplant. To our knowledge, this case is the first report of liver involvement related to CD which is so severe as to require a liver transplant in a child. Because most patients with CD remain undiagnosed, and, as observed in the present report, untreated CD with subclinical hepatic involvement can lead to more serious liver disease, a more aggressive diagnostic work-up for CD in the general population is warranted.},

   abstract = {Calcium malabsorption, hypocalcemia and skeletal demineralization are well-recognized features of untreated celiac disease. This study investigates calcium absorption and bone mineral density (BMD) after a prolonged, over 4 years, treatment with a gluten-free diet. Twenty-four adult females with treated celiac disease and twenty age- and sex-matched control subjects were studied. Mean body mass index (MBI), energy intake, serum calcium, and serum 25(OH)D concentrations in treated celiacs did not differ from controls. However, while both dietary calcium and protein intake were significantly higher in celiacs (P<0.012), fractional calcium absorption was lower (mean percentage+/-SD; treated 39.8+/-12 versus controls 52.3+/-10, P<0.001). Thus, after adjusting for calcium intake, the estimated amount of calcium absorbed daily was similar in both groups. Whole body, spine and trochanter BMD were significantly lower in treated celiac patients compared with controls (P<0.05). There were significant inverse correlations between: serum parathyroid hormone (PTH) and femoral neck or total body BMD (P<0.01), PTH and duration of gluten-free diet (P=0.05), and fractional calcium absorption and alkaline phosphatase (P=0.022). Increased calcium intake could potentially compensate for the reduced fractional calcium absorption in treated adult celiac patients, but may not normalize the BMD. In addition, the inverse correlation between PTH and time following treatment is suggestive of a continuing long-term benefit of gluten withdrawal on bone metabolism in celiac patients.},

The present study aimed to characterize liver abnormalities and outcome after a gluten-free diet in patients with celiac disease diagnosed in a hepatology clinic. MATERIAL AND METHOD: The clinical records of patients diagnosed with celiac disease during a 7-year period were reviewed. RESULTS: Of 1916 patients attending a first consultation at the clinic, 10 were finally diagnosed with celiac disease. All patients had been referred for evaluation of persistent elevation of liver enzyme levels. All patients were young (mean age 30 years, range 21-39 years) and there were more women than men (eight women, 80%). Six patients (60%) had additional manifestations attributable to undiagnosed celiac disease, sometimes since childhood. In all patients, elevation of liver enzyme levels was moderate and overall liver function was preserved. Liver biopsy was performed in five patients and all showed chronic periportal infiltrate. Immunohistochemical studies revealed that the infiltrate was mainly composed of CD8-positive T lymphocytes. In all patients, a gluten-free diet was followed by normalization of liver enzyme levels. CONCLUSIONS: Although celiac disease is not highly frequent, it should be considered in the differential diagnosis of patients with persistent abnormalities of liver markers. The most conspicuous histopathological change is periportal T-cell infiltrate. Liver abnormalities in celiac disease are generally mild and improve after a gluten-free diet.},

   abstract = {BACKGROUND/AIM: Smooth muscle antibody (SMA) specific for the protein actin, a major component of the cytoskeleton of epithelial cells, is one of the most prevalent non-organ specific autoantibodies in the serum of celiac disease (CD) patients. Our aim was to explore the clinical relevance of the presence of IgA type anti-actin antibody (AAA) and SMA in a series of patients with CD. METHODS: We evaluated frozen serum samples collected at diagnosis from 92 adult patients with CD and 52 control individuals in whom CD was excluded. Patients were re-evaluated a median time of 5 yr after treatment. IgA type AAA was detected using a modified commercial ELISA assay and IgA SMA was detected using indirect immunofluorescence on primate esophagus substrate. RESULTS: At diagnosis, samples from CD patients had significantly higher AAA values than controls (p<0.00001). While all active CD patients had serum AAA values over the cut-off for healthy controls, we observed a very significant reduction of these antibodies after treatment (p>0.0001). AAA had a highly significant correlation with both, tissue, transglutaminase (r=0.62) and antigliadin (r=0.60, p<0.00001) antibodies as well as the severity of the intestinal injury (p<0.05). SMA was detected in sera of 35 consecutive CD patients. At diagnosis, SMA positive patients had significantly higher values of AAA (p<0.0002), increased number of autoimmune disorders (p<0.04), delayed menarche (p<0.04), lower hemoglobin levels (p<0.01), increased fecal a-I antitrypsin clearance (p<0.01) and more severe diarrhea (p<0.06). We also detected a trend to more severe complications at follow-up (p=0.059). CONCLUSIONS: Based on our findings we suggest that the presence of increased IgA AAA serum levels is a highly sensitive marker of the disturbed architecture of intestinal epithelial cells of CD patients with a potential relevance to diagnosis and follow-up. The presence of SMA seems to define a distinct subset of CD patients with a more severe clinical outcome.},

   abstract = {Coeliac disease is a gluten-sensitive enteropathy characterized by villous atrophy, hyperplastic crypts and increased numbers of intraepithelial lymphocytes which are reversed by gluten withdrawal. Diverse autoimmune disorders are frequently associated with the disease, and patients also carry an increased risk of gastrointestinal malignancy. This review is aimed at outlining the current knowledge on the contribution of the innate immunity to the whole progress of coeliac disease, catalogued as the prototype of an immune-mediated response dominated by the activation of the adaptive immune system. The accumulated data suggest a model in which the gliadin moiety triggers the upregulation of costimulatory molecules on antigen presenting cells in the lamina propria, and the generation of specialized functions on intraepithelial lymphocytes. In the lamina propria, gliadin effects are essential for the generation of a robust T cell response while in the epithelial compartment, gliadin effects confer both innate-like and TCR-mediated cytotoxicity strongly contributing to tissue injury.},

   abstract = {Celiac disease is a genetically determined bowel disease also influenced by exogenous factors in which exposure to grain components triggers a chronic immune response with intestinal symptoms. Dermatitis herpetiformis represents the cutaneous manifestation of celiac disease. While intense pruritus is the characteristic symptom, clinical signs can be highly variable, ranging from grouped papulovesicles with excoriations or eczema-like lesions to minimal variants of discrete erythema and digital purpura. Diagnosis depends on direct fluorescence studies of perilesional skin displaying granular IgA deposits in dermal papillae. Suspecting and then searching for dermatitis herpetiformis is often clinically challenging, as the disease is a true chameleon with many clinical faces. Dapsone therapy alleviates the cutaneous symptoms and signs, but does not prevent the systemic complications of celiac disease; thus, strict adherence to a gluten-free diet is strongly advisable.},

   abstract = {OBJECTIVE: Diagnosis of coeliac disease is based on the presence of villous atrophy which recovers following a gluten-free diet. The presence of circulating antiendomysial antibodies as well as their disappearance after a gluten-free diet supports the diagnosis. It has also been demonstrated that antiendomysial antibodies are detectable in supernatants of cultured intestinal biopsies from patients with coeliac disease. The objective of this study was to compare the histology and antiendomysial antibodies in culture supernatants of intestinal biopsies to validate the in vitro organ culture system as a future diagnostic tool for coeliac disease. MATERIAL AND METHODS: Seventy-five antiendomysial serum-positive patients on a gluten-containing diet were evaluated. Patients underwent endoscopy with 5 biopsy fragments: 3 for histology, 1 cultured with and the other without gliadin-peptide activator. Antiendomysial antibodies were evaluated in all culture supernatants. RESULTS: Sixty-eight patients had evidence of villous atrophy, while 73 out of 75 were positive to the organ culture system. The agreement rate between organ culture and histology results was 94%. CONCLUSIONS: As all the centres participating in the study obtained good agreement between organ culture and histology results, the new system could be considered a reliable tool for the diagnosis of coeliac disease. Nevertheless, it is possible to highlight cases with an organ culture-positive and -negative histology. This feature could be of considerable interest because, as the sensitivity of organ culture seems to be greater than the initial histology, the new system might be useful in uncertain cases where the risk of missing the diagnosis of coeliac disease is high.},

   abstract = {A strong association between type 1 insulin-dependent diabetes mellitus (IDDM1) and coeliac disease (CD) is well documented, but it is known that prevalence values are underestimated. Serum anti-endomysial antibodies (EMA), considered diagnostic for CD because of their high sensitivity and specificity, belong to the IgA class, but the existence of EMA of IgG1 isotype in the presence or absence of IgA deficiency was reported. In order to re-evaluate the occurrence of CD in IDDM1 patients we performed a screening in IDDM1 patients using EMA of both isotypes. Ninety-four adults affected by IDDM1 (unaffected by CD before enrolling) were enrolled and 83 blood donors as controls. All subjects were on a gluten-containing diet. Histology and biopsy culture were performed. EMA IgA and IgG1 in sera and culture supernatants were detected. Serum EMA were positive in 13 of 94 IDDM1 patients (13.8%). Six of 13 presented IgA-EMA, seven of 13 presented IgG1-EMA. No EMA were found in the control population. Total intestinal atrophy was found in all six patients with serum IgA-EMA and in five of seven with serum IgG1-EMA. Diagnosis of CD was confirmed by histology and organ culture in all 13 patients with serum EMA. The prevalence of CD in the patients affected by IDDM1 was 6.4% for IgA-EMA-positive and 7.4% for IgG1-EMA-positive patients. We confirmed the prevalence of CD in the IDDM1 population obtained with IgA-EMA screening only (6.4%). This prevalence value increases dramatically to 13.8% when IgG1-EMA are also used in the screening. We conclude that IgG1-EMA should also be sought whenever an IDDM1 patient undergoes screening for CD.},

   abstract = {Celiac disease is the only autoimmune condition for which we know the environmental trigger: gluten. Complete removal of gluten from the diet in a patient with celiac disease should result in symptomatic, serologic, and histologic remission. However, compliance with the gluten-free diet, especially in the United States, is extremely challenging. Compliance can be measured both noninvasively, by dietary history and measurement of serum antibodies, and invasively, by using endoscopic and histologic criteria. The advantages and disadvantages of these various modalities are discussed. The highest rates of compliance are reported in patients who are diagnosed as young children, whereas adolescents and those diagnosed via mass serologic screening have the most transgressions. Barriers to compliance include the poor palatability of gluten-free foods, confusing food-labeling practices, and common comorbid psychologic burdens such as anxiety and depression. Because celiac disease is a multisystemic disorder, physicians need to be aware of the potential autoimmune, nutritional, and malignant complications. An algorithm for the follow-up and management of the newly diagnosed celiac disease patient is presented, which includes regular follow-up; measurement of serum antibodies; eliciting a detailed dietary history; and examination for signs and symptoms of nutritional deficiencies, malignancy, and other autoimmune diseases. Ideally, a team approach to the follow-up of the newly diagnosed patient should include regular supervision by an interested physician, medical nutritional counseling by a registered dietician, and access to local and national support groups knowledgeable about this condition.},

   abstract = {OBJECTIVE: The treatment of celiac disease is based on lifelong withdrawal of foods containing gluten. Unfortunately, compliance with a gluten-free diet has proved poor in many patients (mainly due to its low palatability), emphasizing the need for cereal varieties that are not toxic for celiac patients. In evolutionary terms, Triticum monococcum is the oldest and most primitive cultivated wheat. The aim of this study was to evaluate the toxicity of T. monococcum on small intestinal mucosa, using an in vitro organ culture system. MATERIAL AND METHODS: Distal duodenum biopsies of 12 treated celiac patients and 17 control subjects were cultured for 24 h with T. aestivum (bread) gliadin (1 mg/ml) or with T. monococcum gliadin (1 mg/ml). Biopsies cultured with medium alone served as controls. Each biopsy was used for conventional histological examination and for immunohistochemical detection of CD3 + intraepithelial lymphocytes (IELs) and HLA-DR. Secreted cytokine protein interferon-gamma (IFN-gamma) was measured in the culture supernatant using an enzyme-linked immunoadsorbent assay. RESULTS: Significant morphological changes, HLA-DR overexpression in the crypt epithelium and an increased number of CD3 + IELs, found after bread gliadin exposure, were not observed in celiac biopsies cultured with T. monococcum gliadin. In contrast, with bread gliadin, there was no significant IFN-gamma response after culture with monococcum gliadin. Similarly, biopsies from normal controls did not respond to bread or monococcum gliadin stimulation. CONCLUSIONS: These data show a lack of toxicity of T. monococcum gliadin in an in vitro organ culture system, suggesting new dietary opportunities for celiac patients.},

   abstract = {Undiagnosed and untreated celiac disease (CD) constitutes an increasing skeletal health problem due to its association with low bone density and fractures. Examinations of skeletal status in children using dual-energy X-ray absorptiometry (DXA) are prone to size-related misinterpretation. In contrary, the analysis of muscle-bone relationship seems to limit a possibility of misdiagnosis because skeletal status is evaluated from the functional perspective. The study was aimed to assess skeletal status of children suffering from CD with the use of muscle-bone functional algorithm. The study group comprised 29 celiac patients (13.7yr+/-2.9) on gluten-free diet (GFD), and 24 newly diagnosed atypical celiac patients, including subgroup with normal height (n=14; 12.6yr+/-3.9) and subgroup with short stature (n=10; 12.2yr+/-2.9). Muscular and skeletal status was evaluated by DXA (DPX-L, GE). Anthropometry, total body bone mineral density (TBBMD, g/cm(2)). and total body bone mineral content (TBBMC, g) as well as lean body mass (LBM, g) were evaluated. Muscle-bone interactions were estimated using TBBMC/LBM ratio. Previously established references for healthy controls were used for the calculation of Z-scores (age-matched) and SD-scores (height-matched). GFD treated celiacs and atypical celiacs with normal body height had TBBMD, TBBMC, LBM, and TBBMC/LBM ratio Z-scores and SD-scores within normal range for healthy controls. In contrary, atypical celiacs with short stature had significantly lower Z-scores for TBBMD (-2.3+/-0.4), TBBMC (-2.1+/-0.3), LBM (-1.4+/-0.3). and TBBMC/LBM ratio (-2.3+/-0.6) when compared to respective values observed in GFD treated celiacs (p<0.001, p<0.001, p<0.05, p<0.01) and atypical celiacs with normal height (p<0.01, p<0.01, p<0.05, p<0.01). When body-height matching of DXA data was used to limit the influence of body size, the atypical celiacs with short stature had SD-scores for TBBMD (-1.3+/-0.7), TBBMC (-1.3+/-0.6), and LBM (+0.8+/-0.3) not significantly different from the corresponding SD-scores obtained in the remaining 2 groups. Nevertheless, short stature in atypical celiacs still coincided with significantly lower TBBMC/LBM ratio SD-score of -1.9+/-0.7 when compared to values observed in GFD treated celiacs (+0.04+/-0.2; p<0.05) and atypical celiacs with normal height (-0.4+/-0.2; p<0.05). GFD regime in classic celiacs corresponded with physiological values of DXA assessed indicators of bone and muscle status as well as normal muscle-bone interactions. Untreated atypical celiacs may present a broad spectrum of heterogeneous abnormalities from normal to markedly depressed TBBMC/LBM ratio values pointing on the marked imbalance between TBBMC and LBM.},

PATIENTS AND METHODS: Over a period of 5 years, a total of 549 children (< or = 14 years) with a clinical suspicion of CD were evaluated. Their detailed clinical features, investigations, and follow-up data were recorded. Complete hemogram, endoscopic duodenal biopsy, and celiac serology were done in all of the cases. Celiac disease was diagnosed on the basis of modified European Society of Paediatric Gastroenterology, Hepatology and Nutrition criteria. RESULTS: Celiac disease was diagnosed in 300 children; 39 were excluded because of lack of follow-up or poor response to gluten-free diet. The remaining 210 had normal villous architecture and served as controls. The mean (+/- standard deviation) age of children with CD was 6.7 +/- 3 years, and the mean duration of symptoms was 3.5 +/- 2.5 years. The majority (84%) presented with diarrhea; other features were failure to thrive in 91%, anemia in 84%, wasting in 87%, and stunting in 60% of cases. Among the serological tests, the best results were obtained with tissue transglutaminase. On follow-up (19.4 +/- 15.5 months), symptoms subsided in all cases of CD with a significant weight and height gain. CONCLUSIONS: Indian children with CD present late, with a significant delay in diagnosis. The majority presents with classic symptoms of diarrhea, failure to thrive, and anemia. There is a need for increasing awareness to pick up the atypical forms of the disease.},

   abstract = {OBJECTIVE: Early exposure to solid foods in infancy has been associated with the development of allergy. The aim of this study was to examine the association between cereal-grain exposures (wheat, barley, rye, oats) in the infant diet and development of wheat allergy. METHODS: A total of 1612 children were enrolled at birth and followed to the mean age of 4.7 years. Questionnaire data and dietary exposures were obtained at 3, 6, 9, 15, and 24 months and annually thereafter. The main outcome measure was parent report of wheat allergy. Children with celiac disease autoimmunity detected by tissue transglutaminase autoantibodies were excluded. Wheat-specific immunoglobulin E levels on children reported to have wheat allergy were obtained. RESULTS: Sixteen children (1%) reported wheat allergy. Children who were first exposed to cereals after 6 months of age had an increased risk of wheat allergy compared with children first exposed to cereals before 6 months of age (after controlling for confounders including a family history of allergic disorders and history of food allergy before 6 months of age). All 4 children with detectable wheat-specific immunoglobulin E were first exposed to cereal grains after 6 months. A first-degree relative with asthma, eczema, or hives was also independently associated with an increased risk of wheat-allergy development. CONCLUSIONS: Delaying initial exposure to cereal grains until after 6 months may increase the risk of developing wheat allergy. These results do not support delaying introduction of cereal grains for the protection of food allergy.},

   abstract = {BACKGROUND & AIMS: Undiagnosed patients with symptoms of celiac sprue often present to physicians after establishing dietary gluten exclusion. Although they must resume a gluten-containing diet for evaluation, there are no guidelines regarding duration of the gluten challenge, gluten dose, or monitoring parameters. We investigated the effects of a short-term gluten challenge in asymptomatic treated adult celiac patients on intestinal absorption and celiac antibody tests. METHODS: Eight adult asymptomatic celiac patients consumed either 5 or 10 g of partially hydrolyzed gluten per day in an orange juice mixture for 21 days while maintaining their usual gluten-free diet. A symptom questionnaire, serum antibodies (antigliadin immunoglobulin [Ig]A and antitransglutaminase IgA and IgG), D-xylose urine excretion test, and 72-hour quantitative fecal fat test were monitored. RESULTS: Two patients (25%) had at least 1 abnormal celiac antibody test at baseline. There was no increase in antibodies during gluten exposure compared with baseline for any of the patients (P > .05). At baseline, 1 patient had abnormal urine xylose excretion, and 3 patients had abnormal fecal fat values. At day 15 of gluten challenge, all patients had reduced xylose absorption compared with baseline (P = .0019), and 5 of 8 participants (63%) reduced their xylose excretion to the abnormal range. Seven of 8 patients (88%) had increased fecal fat excretion at day 15 (P = .026), and 6 of these (75%) had steatorrhea by day 15. CONCLUSIONS: Short-term gluten challenge in asymptomatic adult celiac patients produces carbohydrate and fat malabsorption but does not increase transglutaminase and antigliadin antibody titers.},

   abstract = {BACKGROUND & AIMS: We sought to determine whether prolyl endopeptidase (PEP) treatment of food gluten would obviate the intestinal dysfunction produced by small amounts of dietary gluten supplement in patients with celiac sprue. METHODS: Twenty asymptomatic patients with histologically proven celiac sprue completed a randomized, double-blind, cross-over study involving two 14-day stages. Each patient consumed a low dose of a gluten supplement daily (5 g; equivalent to 1 slice of bread) in 1 stage and gluten pretreated with PEP in the other stage. Patients completed a daily symptom questionnaire and a D-xylose urine excretion and a 72-hour quantitative fecal fat were monitored before and after each stage. RESULTS: Despite clinical remission at baseline, 40% of patients had at least 1 abnormal celiac antibody, 20% had an abnormal urine xylose, and 63% had an abnormal fecal fat test result. There was no difference in symptoms as a function of the type of gluten consumed. In response to gluten not treated with PEP, an appreciable proportion of patients developed malabsorption of fat (7 of 17, 41%) or xylose (8 of 14, 57%). When the gluten was pretreated with PEP, fat malabsorption was avoided in 5 of 7 and xylose malabsorption in 4 of 8 of these same patients. CONCLUSIONS: A significant proportion of asymptomatic patients with celiac sprue have abnormal celiac antibodies and fat or carbohydrate malabsorption. Pretreatment of gluten with PEP avoided the development of fat or carbohydrate malabsorption in the majority of those patients who developed fat or carbohydrate malabsorption after a 2-week gluten challenge.},

   abstract = {BACKGROUND: Coeliac disease in adolescents has been associated with an increased prevalence of depressive and disruptive behavioural disorders, particularly in the phase before diet treatment. We studied the possible effects of a gluten-free diet on psychiatric symptoms, on hormonal status (prolactin, thyroidal function) and on large neutral amino acid serum concentrations in adolescents with coeliac disease commencing a gluten-free diet. METHODS: Nine adolescents with celiac disease, aged 12 to 16 years, were assessed using the semi-structured K-SADS-Present and Lifetime Diagnostic interview and several symptom scales. Seven of them were followed at 1 to 2, 3, and 6 months on a gluten-free diet. RESULTS: Adolescent coeliac disease patients with depression had significantly lower pre-diet tryptophan/ competing amino-acid (CAA) ratios and free tryptophan concentrations, and significantly higher biopsy morning prolactin levels compared to those without depression. A significant decrease in psychiatric symptoms was found at 3 months on a gluten-free diet compared to patients' baseline condition, coinciding with significantly decreased coeliac disease activity and prolactin levels and with a significant increase in serum concentrations of CAAs. CONCLUSION: Although our results of the amino acid analysis and prolactin levels in adolescents are only preliminary, they give support to previous findings on patients with coeliac disease, suggesting that serotonergic dysfunction due to impaired availability of tryptophan may play a role in vulnerability to depressive and behavioural disorders also among adolescents with untreated coeliac disease.},

   abstract = {BACKGROUND: The conventional coeliac disease antibody tests require patient's sera, and are laborious and time-consuming. AIM: To evaluate a newly developed rapid whole blood test in coeliac disease antibody detection, and its suitability for office use. METHODS: Endogenous tissue transglutaminase found in red blood cells in a whole blood fingertip or venous sample is liberated upon haemolysis and complexes with tissue transglutaminase antibodies, if present. The complexes, captured by a lateral flow system, are visualized within 5 min. Stored samples from 121 untreated, 106 treated coeliac disease patients and 107 controls were evaluated and compared with serum endomysium and tissue transglutaminase antibody tests and histology; 150 patients were prospectively tested on site in the doctor's office. RESULTS: The rapid test showed sensitivity (96.7%) comparable with the serum endomysium and tissue transglutaminase antibody tests from stored samples; specificity was slightly lower (93.5%). When tested on site the results were concordant in 96.7% of cases compared with endomysium and tissue transglutaminase antibody results. The test recognized the disappearance of tissue transglutaminase antibodies on a gluten-free diet. CONCLUSIONS: The self tissue transglutaminase-based rapid test can be easily carried out from a fingertip blood sample on site in the physician's office for both coeliac disease case finding and dietary monitoring purposes.},

   abstract = {Various experimental models suggest that the cholesterol-lowering drugs statins may also modulate immune responses. Cellular level studies on human disorders are needed, however, to provide a rational basis for clinical testing of statins as immune therapy. Coeliac disease, a chronic small intestinal inflammation driven by HLA-DQ2 restricted mucosal T cells that are specific for ingested wheat gluten peptides, is in many ways ideal for this purpose. In addition, there is a need for alternative treatment to the gluten-free diet in this disorder. Here we have assessed the effects of atorvastatin on gluten-reactive T cells, dendritic cells and the coeliac mucosa by in vitro culture of biopsies. Atorvastatin inhibited gluten-induced proliferation and specific cytokine production of human intestinal gluten-reactive T cell clones and lines. Dendritic cells exposed to atorvastatin displayed a reduced expression of the costimulatory molecule CD83 upon maturation with lipopolysaccharide. Incubation of intestinal biopsy specimens with atorvastatin in vitro, however, did not influence gluten-induced cytokine release. In conclusion, atorvastatin has specific effects on isolated gluten-reactive T cells and dendritic cells, but does not shut down the gluten-induced production of proinflammatory cytokines in intestinal biopsies.},

   abstract = {OBJECTIVES: We sought to characterize the clinical features at presentation as well as the associated disorders, family history, and evaluation of compliance with a gluten-free diet in children with celiac disease from across Canada. STUDY DESIGN: All members (n = 5240) of the Canadian Celiac Association were surveyed with a questionnaire. Of the 2849 respondents with biopsy-confirmed celiac disease, 168 who were < 16 years old provided the data reported here. RESULTS: The mean age when surveyed was 9.1 +/- 4.1 years, and 58% were female. Median age at diagnosis was 3.0 years with a range of 1 to 15 years. Presenting symptoms included abdominal pain (90%), weight loss (71%), diarrhea (65%), weakness (64%), nausea/vomiting (53%), anemia (40%), mood swings (37%), and constipation (30%). Almost one third of families consulted > or = 2 pediatricians before confirmation of the diagnosis. Before the recognition of celiac disease, other diagnoses received by these children included anemia (15%), irritable bowel syndrome (11%), gastroesophageal reflux (8%), stress (8%), and peptic ulcer disease (4%). A serological test was performed to screen for celiac disease in 70% of those in this population. Eight percent had either type 1 diabetes mellitus or a first-degree relative with celiac disease. Almost all respondents (95%) reported strict adherence to a gluten-free diet, and 89% noted improved health. Reactions after accidental gluten ingestion developed in 54% of the children between 0.5 and 60 hours after ingestion with a median of 2.0 hours. Reactions included abdominal discomfort (87%), diarrhea (64%), bloating (57%), fatigue (37%), headache (24%), and constipation (8%), and most displayed > 1 symptom. Although most adjusted well to their disease and diet, 10% to 20% reported major disruptions in lifestyle. Twenty-three percent felt angry all or most of the time about following a gluten-free diet. Only 15% avoided traveling all or most of the time, and during travel, 83% brought gluten-free food with them all of the time. More than half of the families avoided restaurants all or most of the time. Twenty-eight percent of the respondents found it extremely difficult to locate stores with gluten-free foods, and 27% reported extreme difficulty in finding gluten-free foods or determining if foods were free of gluten. Sixty-three percent of the respondents felt that the information supplied by the Canadian Celiac Association was excellent. Gastroenterologists provided excellent information to 44%, dietitians to 36%, and the family physician to 11.5%. When asked to select 2 items that would improve their quality of life, better labeling of gluten-containing ingredients was selected by 63%, more gluten-free foods in the supermarket by 49%, gluten-free choices on restaurant menus by 49%, earlier diagnosis of celiac disease by 34%, and better dietary counseling by 7%. CONCLUSIONS: In Canada, children with celiac disease present at all ages with a variety of symptoms and associated conditions. Delays in diagnosis are common. Most children are compliant with a gluten-free diet. A minority of these children experience difficulties in modifying their lifestyles, and gluten-free foods remain difficult to obtain.},

   abstract = {Celiac disease is an autoimmune disorder that develops after dietary exposure of the small intestine to gluten peptides in cereals. Celiac disease has a strong genetic component associated with HLA-DQ2 and HLA-DQ8, and testing for absence of these genetic markers is useful when serological tests and biopsies are indeterminate, as it renders celiac disease highly unlikely. We have developed a new real-time PCR assay, using sequence-specific primers (PCR-SSP) and TaqMan probes, for detection of DQB1*05, DQB1*02 (coding for DQ2) and DQB1*0302 (coding for DQ8). PCR amplification and detection of DQ2 and DQ8 was accurately and unambiguously performed from genomic DNA isolated from cell lines and human DNA. Amplification was scored digitally, without laboratory manipulation of amplified PCR products and with a higher accuracy than PCR-SSP. This assay should increase accuracy and throughput, and reduce risks of contamination in laboratories where testing for HLA DQ2 and DQ8 is performed as part of diagnosis of celiac disease.},

   abstract = {PRINCIPLES: Coeliac disease (gluten sensitive enteropathy) is a genetically determined disorder with an incidence in the general population that is comparable to type 2 diabetes mellitus. Awareness of this fact and of the often atypical and oligosymptomatic manifestations is only now gaining ground in the medical profession. A high index of suspicion is important in order to minimise diagnostic and therapeutic delay. METHODS: Testing patterns and follow-up for coeliac disease in our institution have been analysed retrospectively for the past five years. The current literature was reviewed with respect to recommendations for clinical practice. RESULTS: A total of 271 patients were tested for coeliac disease over a period of five years. Only in 24 patients were positive results found; after further work-up, the final number of cases with certain or presumed coeliac disease was four. Followup was often difficult, many patients being lost after a single visit. CONCLUSIONS: This study showed that the number of tests ordered in our institution, more often for abdominal than atypical symptoms, has started to increase in the past two years. It also showed that screening tests have found their place in general clinical practice, while the final choice of tests needs to be determined in accordance with available guidelines and local resources. Upper endoscopy with small bowel biopsy remains the gold standard for diagnosis, but its place in follow-up is less certain. Coeliac disease is a disorder for which there is a definite treatment (gluten free diet); if it is left untreated diminished quality of life and potentially serious complications may ensue. Further education of the medical profession regarding coeliac disease, its incidence, presentation and treatment, is clearly indicated..},

RECENT FINDINGS: The crucial epitopes that confer toxicity to gliadin and related prolamins continue to be defined, as do methods of assessing their toxicity. New approaches to making the gluten-free diet more palatable are being studied. SUMMARY: The position of proline residues is critical to the toxicity of cereal proteins to patients with celiac disease. Other genetic factors, apart from HLA status, remain elusive. Exciting advances in altering the toxicity of cereal proteins are being made.},

   abstract = {Celiac disease (CD) is a common autoimmune disorder, induced by the intake of gluten proteins present in wheat, barley and rye. Contrary to common belief, this disorder is a protean systemic disease, rather than merely a pure digestive alteration. CD is closely associated with genes that code HLA-II antigens, mainly of DQ2 and DQ8 classes. Previously, it was considered to be a rare childhood disorder, but is actually considered a frequent condition, present at any age, which may have multiple complications. Tissue transglutaminase-2 (tTG), appears to be an important component of this disease, both, in its pathogenesis and diagnosis. Active CD is characterized by intestinal and/or extra-intestinal symptoms, villous atrophy and crypt hyperplasia, and strongly positive tTG auto-antibodies. The duodenal biopsy is considered to be the "gold standard" for diagnosis, but its practice has significant limitations in its interpretation, especially in adults. Occasionally, it results in a false-negative because of patchy mucosal changes and the presence of mucosal villous atrophy is often more severe in the proximal jejunum, usually not reached by endoscopic biopsies. CD is associated with increased rates of several diseases, such as iron deficiency anemia, osteoporosis, dermatitis herpetiformis, several neurologic and endocrine diseases, persistent chronic hypertransami-nasemia of unknown origin, various types of cancer and other autoimmune disorders. Treatment of CD dictates a strict, life-long gluten-free diet, which results in remission for most individuals, although its effect on some associated extraintestinal manifestations remains to be established.},

   abstract = {BACKGROUND & AIMS: Hyperhomocysteinemia, a risk factor for thrombosis, recurrent miscarriages, and osteoporosis, might derive from acquired folate and vitamin B 12 deficiencies and from a C677T mutation in methylene-tetrahydrofolate reductase (MTHFR) gene. Undiagnosed gluten-sensitive enteropathy (GSE) is associated with vitamin deficiencies, osteoporosis, and recurrent miscarriages. We evaluated the prevalence and the risk factors for hyperhomocysteinemia in patients with newly diagnosed GSE. METHODS: In this prospective study performed in a tertiary care setting, 40 consecutive subjects with newly diagnosed GSE were evaluated for homocysteine, folate, and vitamin B 12 levels and for C677T polymorphism. One hundred twenty sex- and age-matched healthy control subjects were studied. Nonparametric tests and multiple regression analysis were used to evaluate the risk factors in inducing hyperhomocysteinemia in the GSE population. RESULTS: Hyperhomocysteinemia was more frequent in GSE patients than in control subjects (8/40, 20.0% vs 7/120, 5.8%) (relative risk, 3.4; 95% confidence interval, 1.3-8.9), as well as folate deficiency (17/40, 42.5% vs 10/120, 8.3%) (relative risk, 5.1; 95% confidence interval, 2.5-10.2). Multiple regression analysis showed that folate and B 12 levels were independently and inversely associated with homocysteine levels, whereas homozygosity for the MTHFR thermolabile variant was not. The prevalence of MTHFR variant in GSE population was not different from that reported in racially comparable control groups. Gluten-free diet was able to normalize folate, vitamin B 12 , and homocysteine levels. CONCLUSIONS: Hyperhomocysteinemia is frequent in newly diagnosed GSE. Vitamin deficiencies caused by malabsorption are the most important determinants of this condition. Hyperhomocysteinemia might contribute to the occurrence of common complications of undiagnosed GSE.},

   abstract = {OBJECTIVE: To evaluate the effect of a gluten-free diet on growth and adult height, when available, in coeliac children without gastrointestinal symptoms. PATIENTS AND METHODS: Sixty-one coeliac children without gastro-intestinal symptoms were included in the study. The age at diagnosis was 9.50 +/- 3.3 years. Thirty-eight had short stature at diagnosis (< 10th percentile) and 23 had normal stature. Thirty-seven reached adult height. RESULTS: After beginning the diet an increase in growth velocity was seen in 30 patients (responders) (20 with initial short stature), while in 31 patients (18 with short stature) there was no catch-up growth (non-responders). Bone age at diagnosis was significantly more delayed in the responders than in the non-responders. Target height was significantly higher in children with normal stature at diagnosis than those with short stature. Growth hormone (GH) deficiency was found and confirmed after 6-12 months of diet in 12 of the 38 patients (32%) with short stature. In the group of the 30 'short' patients who attained final height, target height was attained or improved in 12 patients (40%): in eight of the 16 (50%) responders and in four of the 14 (29%) non-responders; in eight (all responders) out of 22 (36%) without GH deficiency, and in four out of eight (50%) patients with GH deficiency treated with GH (all non-responders). CONCLUSIONS: In children in whom coeliac disease is diagnosed because of short stature, a gluten-free diet will be successful if at diagnosis there is a delay of bone age and in the first year of diet there is an evident catch-up growth. When this does not occur, i.e. in half of the patients (18 out of 38), it may be because of an associated and transient GH deficiency. In these patients a period of GH replacement therapy as well as a gluten-free diet may improve their final height.},

   abstract = {BACKGROUND: Enteropathy in coeliac disease (CD) is sustained by a gliadin specific Th1 response. Interleukin (IL)-10 can downregulate Th1 immune responses. AIM: We investigated the ability of recombinant human (rh) IL-10 to suppress gliadin induced Th1 response. PATIENTS AND METHODS: IL-10 RNA transcripts were analysed by competitive reverse transcription-polymerase chain reaction in duodenal biopsies from untreated and treated CD patients, non-coeliac enteropathies (NCE), and controls. CD biopsies were cultured with a peptic-tryptic digest of gliadin with or without rhIL-10. The proportion of CD80+ and CD25+ cells in the lamina propria, epithelial expression of Fas, intraepithelial infiltration of CD3+ cells, as well as cytokine synthesis (interferon gamma (IFN-gamma) and IL-2) were measured. Short term T cell lines (TCLs) obtained from treated CD biopsies cultured with gliadin with or without rhIL-10 were analysed by ELISPOT for gliadin specific production of IFN-gamma. RESULTS: In untreated CD and NCE, IL-10 RNA transcripts were significantly upregulated. In ex vivo organ cultures, rhIL-10 downregulated gliadin induced cytokine synthesis, inhibited intraepithelial migration of CD3+ cells, and reduced the proportion of lamina propria CD25+ and CD80+ cells whereas it did not interfere with epithelial Fas expression. In short term TCLs, rhIL-10 abrogated the IFN-gamma response to gliadin. CONCLUSIONS: rhIL-10 suppresses gliadin specific T cell activation. It may interfere with the antigen presenting capacity of lamina propria mononuclear cells as it reduces the expression of CD80. Interestingly, rhIL-10 also induces a long term hyporesponsiveness of gliadin specific mucosal T cells. These results offer new perspectives for therapeutic strategies in coeliac patients based on immune modulation by IL-10.},

   abstract = {PATIENTS AND METHODS: We assessed the frequency of coeliac disease in 281 children with Type 1 diabetes and the effect of gluten-free diet (GFD) in newly diagnosed cases. Serological screening was performed using anti-gliadin and anti-endomysium antibodies. Data were obtained about clinical symptoms, height and weight-for-height. RESULTS: A small intestinal biopsy was recommended to 18 patients (6.4%) with positive serological results and 12 children agreed. Nine of them had coeliac disease. Three out of nine coeliac children complained about gastrointestinal symptoms. On a GFD, the symptoms disappeared in two patients. Iron-deficiency anaemia was present in four subjects and disappeared in the three patients who accepted the GFD. In three patients (33%), coeliac disease was asymptomatic. Height and weight-for-height were in the normal range for all patients. For well-complying patients, there was a significant increase in height standard deviation at diagnosis and on follow-up (-0.28 vs. +0.35) (P = 0.03). Changes in weight-for-height were not significant (-4.0% vs. +1.4%) (P = 0.28). There was a trend to an improvement in HbA(1c) (8.0 vs. 7.3%) (P = 0.05). CONCLUSIONS: Serological screening is effective. There is a therapeutic benefit for some screening-detected patients, but confirmatory studies are needed.},

   abstract = {BACKGROUND: Acute abdominal pain is the most common indication for surgical admission. Nonspecific abdominal pain (NSAP) may account for up to 40% of cases. There has been no published prospective study in which adult patients presenting with acute abdominal pain are investigated for celiac disease. AIMS: We aimed to assess the association of celiac disease with surgical abdominal pain. PATIENTS AND METHODS: A case-control study was undertaken involving 300 consecutive new unselected patients presenting with acute abdominal pain (in a university hospital) and healthy controls (age and sex matched) without abdominal pain (n = 300). Initial investigations for celiac disease were immunoglobulins, IgA/IgG anti-gliadin (AGA), and endomysial antibodies (EMA). Any patient with a positive IgA AGA, EMA, or only IgG AGA in the presence of IgA deficiency was offered a small bowel biopsy to confirm the diagnosis. RESULTS: : There were 33 patients with abdominal pain who had positive antibodies, of whom 9 had histologically confirmed celiac disease (6 EMA positive; 3 EMA negative). One antibody positive patient (EMA in isolation) declined duodenal biopsy and the remaining 23 had normal duodenal mucosa. Within the control group, there were 2 cases of celiac disease. Compared with matched controls the association of acute abdominal pain with celiac disease gave an odds ratio 4.6. (P = 0.068, 95% confidence interval, 1.11-19.05). When only considering NSAP the prevalence of celiac disease was highly significant at 10.5% (9 of 86, P = 0.006). Patients' symptoms improved on a gluten-free diet at 12- to 18-month follow-up. CONCLUSION: Celiac disease was diagnosed in 3% of patients who presented with unselected acute abdominal pain to secondary care. Targeting patients who have NSAP or celiac associated symptoms/diseases may improve the diagnostic yield.},

   abstract = {Type 1 diabetes mellitus is an autoimmune disorder characterized by destruction of insulin-producing pancreatic beta cells by T lymphocytes. In nonobese diabetic (NOD) mice, a role has been hypothesized for dietary gluten proteins in the onset of diabetes, and because gluten dependence is the major feature of celiac disease, together with production of Abs to the autoantigen tissue transglutaminase (tTG), we looked for the presence of anti-tTG Abs in the serum of NOD mice and, to establish their origin, analyzed the Ab repertoire of NOD mice using phage display Ab libraries. We found significant levels of serum anti-tTG Abs and were able to isolate single-chain Ab fragments to mouse tTG mainly from the Ab libraries made from intestinal lymphocytes and to a lesser extent from splenocytes. Data from NOD mice on a gluten-free diet suggest that the anti-tTG response is not gluten-dependent. The intestinal Ab response to tTG is a feature of NOD mice, but the underlying mechanisms remain obscure.},

   abstract = {BACKGROUND: Crohn's disease is a chronic inflammatory disease of the intestine potentially affecting all parts of the intestine with predilection sites in the terminal ileum and proximal colon. Its prevalence in Western Europe is 20-40/100,000 with equal affection of both sexes and familiar accumulation. Histopathologically, it is characterized by a discontinuous, segmental manifestation and implication of all intestinal layers. Celiac disease, on the other hand, is defined by histologically proven villous atrophy associated with hyperplasia of crypts, lymphocytic infiltration and clinical improvement after a gluten-free diet. CASE REPORT: We report the case of a 52-year-old man presenting with long-term diarrhea and loss of weight associated with Crohn's disease. After interventional therapy for an unstable coronary artery syndrome and medical therapy for hyperthyroidism, the diarrhea stopped only after maintaining a gluten-free diet. A latent form of celiac disease (clinical symptoms, improvement after gluten-free diet, detection of anti-gliadin IgA antibodies, negative histology) was diagnosed. CONCLUSION: To our knowledge, this is the first report on the association of Crohn's disease and the latent form of celiac disease in the same patient. Whereas in most cases, Crohn's disease develops secondary to a pre-existing celiac disease, in our patient, latent celiac disease was diagnosed years after the onset of and therapy for Crohn's disease.},

   abstract = {Mild liver dysfunction occurs in patients with coeliac disease frequently, but severe liver diseases in combination with coeliac disease are rare. A 19-year-old woman was referred for evaluation for emergency liver transplantation with progressive jaundice and prolongation of prothrombin time. She had a history of non-bloody diarrhoea for 3 months and weight loss of 12 kg. At admission, abdominal ultrasound revealed liver enlargement with increased echogenicity and marked thickening of the circular folds of the small intestine, suggestive of coeliac disease. The diagnosis was confirmed by endoscopic biopsy from the second part of the duodenum. On a gluten-free diet the patient recovered within 1 week and remained in excellent health up to the present date. Liver tests normalized within 5 months and a repeat abdominal ultrasound after 20 months revealed a normal liver and small intestine. This case report suggests that coeliac disease should also be considered in patients with unexplained severe acute liver disease and that abdominal ultrasound may be a helpful step to obtain to the correct diagnosis.},

   abstract = {There is increasing evidence that the magnitude and potential of intestinal nutrient absorption (sugars, fatty acids, cholesterol and triglycerides) and intestinal defense function are regulated by metabolic learning phenomena, and are influenced by dietary energy content and exercise. Metabolic overload syndromes, mainly obesity, and chronic malabsorption disorders such as inflammatory bowel disease and celiac disease have been defined as extreme phenotypes. Metabolic learning processes depend on developmental and transcriptional control systems of intestinal epithelial cell differentiation. The physiological differentiation zone of enterocytes is linked to the beta-catenin system, apolipoprotein apoA-IV and the master transcription factors Cdx2, HNF1alpha, and GATA4. In addition to these developmental regulatory transcription factors, nuclear receptors including RXR, LXR, PPAR, PXR, and CAR have been implicated in the generation of more absorptive enterocytes with a more differentiated phenotype on the one hand, and dedifferentiated cells with reduced capacity of detoxification and defense causing loss of junction control and barrier defects on the other. Large-scale analysis of gene expression profiles and identification of key pathways and master regulatory transcription factors will help dissect the role of nutritional and environmental factors as well as pharmacological intervention on mucosal homeostasis and disease, with potential applications for diagnosis and therapy.},

   abstract = {Celiac disease (CD) is an inflammatory small intestinal disorder that can lead to severe villous atrophy, malabsorption, and malignancy. It is triggered by the gluten proteins of wheat, barley, and rye. All patients express the antigen-presenting molecules human leukocyte antigen-DQ2 (HLA-DQ2) and/or HLA-DQ8, which bind gluten peptides and thus activate destructive intestinal T cells. Patients with untreated CD have circulating IgA autoantibodies to the enzyme tissue transglutaminase (tTG), a component of endomysium. Testing for serum IgA tTG has a high predictive value. Therapy of CD is a lifelong gluten-free diet. Counseling by an expert dietitian and association with a celiac support group are important in helping the patient embark on a healthy gluten-free diet. Current research focuses on non-dietary therapies and treatment of refractory (diet-unresponsive) CD.},

   abstract = {Celiac disease (CD) is a chronic disease causing inflammation of the proximal small intestine that occurs in genetically predisposed individuals when they eat gluten, which is the storage protein in wheat, barley, and rye. The disease injury usually resolves when gluten is excluded from the diet. Although the injury will heal, the reaction to gluten is permanent and will recur with the reintroduction of gluten. The condition is surprisingly common, affecting as many as 1% of white populations. The consequences of the disease are predominantly those of malnutrition due to maldigestion and malabsorption, such as diarrhea, weight loss, and anemia. Symptoms caused by inflammation of the small intestine are also common. CD, although it is common and its pathology is well understood, frequently goes undiagnosed, probably because of the nonspecific or vague nature of many of the symptoms that occur. The cornerstone of treatment for CD is elimination of gluten from the diet. In most patients diagnosed with CD, a strict gluten-free diet (GFD) alone should result in complete symptomatic and histologic resolution of the disease and reduce risk of complications. Noncompliance with diet is the leading cause of failure to respond in patients with CD. For these reasons, thorough assessment and counseling at the time of diagnosis and ongoing care are crucial. In this article, we address briefly what is known about the pathogenesis and diagnosis of CD and address its treatment in detail.},

   abstract = {OBJECTIVES: Ghrelin, a gastrointestinal hormone, has effects on nutrient intake and growth. Because celiac disease (CD) has intestinal histopathologic alterations and subsequent malnutrition and/or growth failure, we hypothesized that there would be alterations in serum ghrelin levels of those patients. In this study, we aimed to determine serum ghrelin levels in childhood CD, to observe probable alterations under gluten-free diet (GFD), and to see whether there is a relationship between ghrelin levels and the presentation of the disease and/or diet compliance. METHODS: Thirty-six children with CD and 10 healthy children were included. Serum fasting ghrelin level was measured using radioimmunoassay method. After 6 months under GFD, sera of 19 patients were retested for ghrelin level. RESULTS: Mean serum ghrelin levels in children with CD and in controls were 478.2+/-154.6 and 108.3+/-49.1 pg/mL, respectively (P<0.001). Serum ghrelin level was not different in different clinical presentations. Ghrelin was negatively correlated with body mass index, both in healthy children and in children with CD on admission (P<0.01). Ghrelin level was lower after 6 months under GFDcompared with the level detected on admission (P<0.001), but was still higher compared with that of healthy children (P<0.001). Strict diet compliance lowered ghrelin level, although not statistically. CONCLUSIONS: Ghrelin is increased in childhood CD and is responsive to GFD. Further studies are needed to clarify the mechanism underlying its action in CD.},

Gliadin is a mixture of many proteins that makes difficult the identification of major immunodominant epitopes. To address this issue, we expressed in Escherichia coli a recombinant alpha-gliadin (r-alpha-gliadin) showing the most conserved sequence among the fraction of alpha-gliadins. HLA-DQ8 mice, on a gluten-free diet, were intragastrically immunized with a chymotryptic digest of r-alpha-gliadin along with cholera toxin as adjuvant. Spleen and mesenteric lymph node T cell responses were analyzed for in vitro proliferative assay using a panel of synthetic peptides encompassing the entire sequence of r-alpha-gliadin. Two immunodominant epitopes corresponding to peptide p13 (aa 120-139) and p23 (aa 220-239) were identified. The response was restricted to DQ and mediated by CD4+ T cells. In vitro tissue transglutaminase deamidation of both peptides did not increase the response; furthermore, tissue transglutaminase catalyzed extensive deamidation in vitro along the entire r-alpha-gliadin molecule, but failed to elicit new immunogenic determinants. Surprisingly, the analysis of the cytokine profile showed that both deamidated and native peptides induced preferentially IFN-gamma secretion, despite the use of cholera toxin, a mucosal adjuvant that normally induces a Th2 response to bystander Ags. Taken together, these data suggest that, in this model of gluten hypersensitivity, deamidation is not a prerequisite for the initiation of gluten responses.},

   abstract = {BACKGROUND: Celiac disease (CD) is common and, when undiagnosed, may result in increased mortality, suggesting that mass screening could be justified. The authors examined the cost-effectiveness (CE) of such an approach, assuming a higher mortality rate in undiagnosed CD and that adhering to a gluten-free diet (GFD) reduces the mortality rate. METHODS: The authors developed a state transition Markov model, evaluating the CE of screening an entire population at the age of 18. Screening strategies included no screening v. screening by IgA antiendomysial antibodies (EMA), IgA human antitissue transglutaminase antibodies (TTG), and TTG verified by EMA. All strategies were examined with and without evaluation for IgA deficiency, and they all included an intestinal biopsy. Effects of variables were examined using sensitivity analysis. Effectiveness was assessed by life expectancy for each strategy and the incremental average CE ratio for each. RESULTS: Base-case analysis revealed US$49,491 and US$572,616 per life year gained for screening compared to no screening using EMA or TTG, respectively. The CE of screening with EMA was most influenced by the prevalence of CD and the standardized mortality ratio (SMR) for untreated CD patients. Screening was cost-effective in populations with a relatively high prevalence of CD or when the SMR for untreated CD patients was higher than 1.5. The model was insensitive to changes in the cost of serological markers and diagnostic endoscopy. CONCLUSION: Assuming an SMR of 1.5 or higher for untreated CD patients, mass screening for CD is cost-effective in populations with a relatively high prevalence of CD over a wide range of ages at screening. From a CE perspective, EMA is the preferred serological marker for mass screening. Screening for CD would be justified only if the uncertainties regarding the validity of our assumptions are substantiated.},

   abstract = {Dietary gluten proteins from wheat, rye, and barley are the primary triggers for the immuno-pathogenesis of Celiac Sprue, a widespread immune disease of the small intestine. Recent molecular and structural analyses of representative gluten proteins, most notably alpha- and gamma-gliadin proteins from wheat, have improved our understanding of these pathogenic mechanisms. In particular, based on the properties of a 33-mer peptide, generated from alpha-gliadin under physiological conditions, a link between digestive resistance and inflammatory character of gluten has been proposed. Here, we report three lines of investigation in support of this hypothesis. First, biochemical and immunological analysis of deletion mutants of alpha-2 gliadin confirmed that the DQ2 restricted T cell response to the alpha-2 gliadin are directed toward the epitopes clustered within the 33-mer. Second, proteolytic analysis of a representative gamma-gliadin led to the identification of another multivalent 26-mer peptide that was also resistant to further gastric, pancreatic and intestinal brush border degradation, and was a good substrate of human transglutaminase 2 (TG2). Analogous to the 33-mer, the synthetic 26-mer peptide displayed markedly enhanced T cell antigenicity compared to monovalent control peptides. Finally, in silico analysis of the gluten proteome led to the identification of at least 60 putative peptides that share the common characteristics of the 33-mer and the 26-mer peptides. Together, these results highlight the pivotal role of physiologically generated, proteolytically stable, TG2-reactive, multivalent peptides in the immune response to dietary gluten in Celiac Sprue patients. Prolyl endopeptidase treatment was shown to abolish the antigenicity of both the 33-mer and the 26-mer peptides, and was also predicted to have comparable effects on other proline-rich putatively immunotoxic peptides identified from other polypeptides within the gluten proteome.},

After compensation of the hypothyroidism with doses of L-thyroxine as high as 325 microg/day, the hypothesis of a malabsorptive syndrome was raised. Celiac disease was confirmed by elevated serum antigliadin antibody. A gluten-free diet was instituted which improved the symptoms associated with malabsorption and reduced the L-thyroxine requirement to 125 microg/day.

The aim of this study was to investigate the sequence of events leading to overt CD by retrospective analysis of TGA values in serum samples collected frequently from genetically susceptible children since birth or early childhood. MATERIAL AND METHODS: A total of 1101 at-risk children were recruited in the study. A duodenal biopsy was recommended to all TGA-positive children and performed if parental consent was obtained. RESULTS: During up to 8 years of follow-up, 35 of the cohort children developed TGAs, the youngest at age 1.3 years. After age 1.3 years the annual TGA seroconversion rate was constantly around 1% at least until age 6 years. However, 18 of the 35 TGA-positive children (51%) lost TGAs, without any dietary manipulation. A further 7 children were IgA deficient; of these children, 2 developed IgG antigliadin antibodies (IgG-AGA). Only 13 of the 21 children (62%) who had duodenal biopsies had villous atrophy. The time that passed since emergence of TGAs failed to predict the biopsy findings. Only one of the children with TGAs and both of the IgA-deficient children with IgG-AGA had noticeable abdominal symptoms. CONCLUSIONS: TGAs appear in children at a constant rate after 1 year of age until at least the age of 6 years. Over half of the children loose TGA without gluten exclusion, challenging TGA positivity-based CD prevalence estimates. In symptom-free children, a requirement of two consecutive TGA-positive samples taken >or=3 months apart before performing a duodenal biopsy might diminish the number of unnecessary intestinal biopsies.},

AIM: To evaluate the prevalence, characteristics and associations of fatigue in adult coeliac disease patients. METHODS: The investigated sample comprised adults from Campania, Italy. A total of 130 coeliac disease patients were consecutively recruited in both treated (59 on gluten-free diet) and untreated conditions (71 on normal diet). The control group was made up of 80 healthy controls. Coeliac disease patients and healthy controls underwent laboratory tests, a set of questionnaires for studying fatigue: visual analogue scale for fatigue, chronic fatigue syndrome questionnaire, fatigue severity scale and a modified version of the Zung self-rating depression scale. RESULTS: Coeliac disease patients showed a significantly lower body mass index than controls (P = 0.0001), lower serum iron (P = 0.04). The entire cohort of coeliac disease patients reported greater modified version of the Zung self-rating depression scale score (P = 0.001), greater visual analogue scale for fatigue score (P = 0.0001) and greater chronic fatigue syndrome questionnaire score (P = 0.0001) compared with healthy controls. Coeliac disease patients on a gluten-free diet had a significantly higher modified version of the Zung self-rating depression scale score than coeliacs on a normal diet (P = 0.001). The prevalence of pathological modified version of the Zung self-rating depression scale score was 17% in all coeliac disease patients and 0% in healthy controls. A significant correlation was found between modified version of the Zung self-rating depression scale score and fatigue scale scores in coeliacs on a normal diet. Presence/absence of gastrointestinal symptoms did not show any significant correlation with modified version of the Zung self-rating depression scale score and fatigue scale scores. In coeliacs on a gluten-free diet, modified version of the Zung self-rating depression scale and fatigue scales scores did not significantly differ from coeliacs on a normal diet and were not related to dietetic compliance. CONCLUSION: In coeliacs, fatigue is a common finding, which ameliorates with the gluten-free diet and is strictly correlated to depression although coeliacs on a gluten-free diet showed more frequent and more severe depression symptoms than coeliacs on a normal diet.},

   abstract = {A physician's approach to patients with ulcerative colitis (UC) who are refractory to standard first-line therapies must be thoughtful and systematic and include the individual's physical and emotional state as the physician examines the various dietary, medical, and surgical options currently available. It is of foremost importance to confirm that the refractory patient's symptoms are not simply due to dietary indiscretion, concomitant bowel infection (especially with Clostridium difficile), an incorrect diagnosis (eg, colitis due to infection, NSAIDs, ischemia, diverticulitis, or Crohn's disease), or even a concomitant diagnosis (eg, celiac sprue, pancreatic insufficiency, functional bowel disorder, laxative or sorbitol intake). The ability to quickly assess the status of the colonic mucosa with flexible sigmoidoscopy aids in the ability to distinguish patients with refractory inflammation from those with other diagnoses. The initiation and optimization of the long-term purine analogues azathioprine (AZA) or 6-mercaptopurine (6-MP) remain the backbone of medical therapy for patients with refractory UC. For those unresponsive to corticosteroids, quicker induction of remission may necessitate infliximab, cyclosporine, or tacrolimus. Successful induction and maintenance with AZA, 6-MP, and/or infliximab should be followed by long-term therapy with these agents. Cessation of therapy often leads to relapse. Novel therapies under investigation hold the promise of offering more options for both the induction and maintenance of remission in refractory UC patients. Discussions of surgical intervention should not be put off as a last resort but rather included in the overall treatment plan offered to the patient.},

   abstract = {Celiac disease, which results from an immune reaction to ingested cereal gluten proteins, has several autoimmune features. In particular, celiac disease patients produce highly disease specific IgA and IgG autoantibodies to tissue transglutaminase when they are on a gluten-containing diet, and they have small intestinal intraepithelial lymphocytes which can mediate direct cytotoxicity of enterocytes expressing MIC molecules in an antigen non-specific manner. Similar to typical autoimmune disorders, celiac disease has a multifactorial aetiology with complex genetics, and several autoimmune diseases are commonly presented by patients with celiac disease. Much has been learned about the immunology of celiac disease in recent years, and there is overwhelming evidence that the immune response to gluten is central to the pathogenesis. In light of this, the many autoimmune phenomena associated with celiac disease are thought-provoking, and they challenge us to rethink the boundaries between autoimmunity and immunopathology.},

   abstract = {Celiac disease is a disorder of the small intestine caused by an inappropriate immune response to wheat gluten and similar proteins of barley and rye. At present, the only available treatment is a strict gluten-exclusion diet; hence the need for alternative treatments. Recent advances have improved our understanding of the molecular basis for this disorder and there are several attractive targets for new treatments. Oral enzyme supplementation is designed to accelerate gastrointestinal degradation of proline-rich gluten, especially its proteolytically stable antigenic peptides. Complementary strategies aiming to interfere with activation of gluten-reactive T cells include the inhibition of intestinal tissue transglutaminase activity to prevent selective deamidation of gluten peptides, and blocking the binding of gluten peptides to the HLA-DQ2 or HLA-DQ8 molecules. Other possible treatments include cytokine therapy, and selective adhesion molecule inhibitors that interfere with inflammatory reactions, some of which are already showing promise in the clinic for other gastrointestinal diseases.},

A rare case of concomitant dermatomyositis and celiac disease in a 40-year-old woman is presented. After having been diagnosed with dermatomyositis and iron deficiency anemia, this patient was referred to the gastroenterology clinic to exclude a gastrointestinal malignancy. Blood tests revealed various vitamin deficiencies consistent with malabsorption. The results of gastroscopy with duodenal biopsy were consistent with celiac disease. After she was put on a strict gluten-free diet, both nutritional deficiencies and the dermatomyositis resolved. The patient's human leukocyte antigen haplotype study was positive for DR3 and DQ2, which have been shown to be associated with both juvenile dermatomyositis and celiac disease. It is suggested that patients with newly diagnosed dermatomyositis be investigated for concomitant celiac disease even in the absence of gastrointestinal symptoms.},

   abstract = {BACKGROUND: Celiac disease, as of today, is said to exist in almost all parts of the world, although it is rare among people of purely African-Caribbean, Japanese and Chinese background. The disease has also been considered uncommon in India until recently. Hospital records have revealed an increasing trend of the disease in predominantly wheat-eating areas of North India. The aim of the present study was to determine the prevalence of celiac disease among school children in Punjab, North India. METHODS: The study was carried out in the Ludhiana district of Punjab, Northern India. A total of 4347 children aged 3-17 years attending different schools were enrolled. A structured questionnaire was used to collect sociodemographic data and symptoms and signs related to celiac disease and various sociodemographic factors. The screening for celiac disease for the suspected celiacs was done by testing for antitissue transglutaminase (anti-tTG) by indirect solid-phase immunometric assay (ELISA). All children with high anti-tTG whose parents consented underwent upper gastrointestinal endoscopy for small bowel biopsy from the second part of the duodenum. Histopathology was expressed according to the Marsh classification of 1992. Follow up was carried out among children who were put on a gluten-restricted diet, at monthly intervals for 3 months and every 3 months thereafter. The diagnosis of celiac disease was established on the basis of the revised European Society of Paediatric Gastroenterologists and Nutritionists (ESPGAN) criteria (confirmed cases). RESULTS: A total of 4347 school children (1967 girls, 2380 boys, age range 3-17 years) were screened for celiac disease. Out of these, 198 suspected children were identified for further evaluation. Twenty-one children tested positive for anti-tTG assay (10.6%, 95% confidence interval: 16.91-34.79). Seventeen of these 21 children agreed to undergo biopsy; of these, 14 had histological changes consistent with celiac disease and all these 14 children had clinical response to gluten restriction. Three children with high anti-tTG had normal mucosa on duodenal biopsy and were not labelled as being in the celiac disease group. In the final analysis the disease prevalence was one in 310 children. CONCLUSIONS: This is the first study on celiac disease prevalence among school children from India. Although this disease frequency of one in 310 is thought to be an under-assessment, it clearly shows that celiac disease is not rare in wheat-eating areas of North India.},

   abstract = {BACKGROUND & AIMS: Celiac disease (CD) is an intestinal disorder caused by T-cell responses to peptides derived from the gluten proteins present in wheat. Such peptides have been found both in the gliadin and glutenin proteins in gluten. The only cure for CD is a lifelong gluten-free diet. It is unknown, however, if all wheat varieties are equally harmful for patients. We investigated whether wheat varieties exist with a natural low number of T-cell-stimulatory epitopes. METHODS: Gluten proteins present in public databases were analyzed for the presence of T-cell-stimulatory sequences. In addition, wheat accessions from diploid (AA, SS/BB, and DD genomes), tetraploid (AABB), and hexaploid (AABBDD) Triticum species were tested for the presence of T-cell-stimulatory epitopes in gliadins and glutenins by both T-cell and monoclonal antibody-based assays. RESULTS: The database analysis readily identified gluten proteins that lack 1 or more of the known T-cell-stimulatory sequences. Moreover, both the T-cell- and antibody-based assays showed that a large variation exists in the amount of T-cell-stimulatory peptides present in the wheat accessions. CONCLUSIONS: Sufficient genetic variation is present to endeavor the selection of wheat accessions that contain low amounts of T-cell-stimulatory sequences. Such materials may be used to select and breed wheat varieties suitable for consumption by CD patients, contributing to a well-balanced diet and an increase in their quality of life. Such varieties also may be useful for disease prevention in individuals at risk.},

Because gluten-induced damage is accompanied by activation of the gastrointestinal immune system, the purpose of this study was to investigate if similar changes were induced by oats ingestion. Small intestinal histological sections from 10 patients who ingested 50 g of oats daily for 3 months were investigated for possible evidence of immune activation. Tissue obtained before and after oats challenge was stained with a series of antibodies directed against the following molecules: human leucocyte antigen D-related (HLA-DR), Ki-67, CD25, CD54 [intercellular adhesion molecule 1 (ICAM-1)] and mast cell tryptase. None of the patients developed clinical or laboratory evidence of adverse effects. The distribution of intestinal HLA-DR expression was not affected by oats ingestion and the crypt epithelium remained unstained. In the pre-oats biopsies, the percentage of Ki-67 positive enterocytes, 29.5 +/- 6.9 [95% confidence interval (CI) 13.9-45.0] did not differ significantly from that found in post-oats biopsies, 41.2 +/- 3.7 (95% CI, 32.8-49.6), P = 0.19, not significant. Furthermore, oats ingestion did not alter the number of CD25 positive and tryptase positive cells. Finally, the distribution and intensity of ICAM-1 staining was unchanged by dietary oats. In summary, detailed immunohistological studies of biopsies from patients ingesting oats for 3 months did not reveal evidence of immune activation. Together with other reported findings, this study strengthens the view that oats can be included safely in the diet of gluten sensitive patients.},

   abstract = {The presence of late-onset hypocalcemia (>3 days of age) associated with hypomagnesemia generates a clinical dilemma. Such a disorder may exist as a result of magnesium deficiency with a secondary hypoparathyroidism, congenital hypoparathyroidism (HPT), phosphorus intoxication, activated mutation of calcium sensing receptor (CASR) or the presence of CASR stimulatory antibodies. In phosphorus intoxication, in contrast to the other reasons, serum PTH level is rather elevated. Calcium and phosphorus compete for intestinal absorption and thus if calcium intake is high then magnesium absorption is reduced and vice versa. Patient's history: 14-year-old boy was admitted to the ward because of tetanic seizure few days before. Severe hypocalcemia (1.49 mmol/L) with hypomagnesemia (13.8 mg/L) as well as metabolic alkalosis pH=7.65) and high phosphorus level (10.5 mg/dL) were noted. The boy was prepubertal, euthyroid and proportionally microsomic. Severely low serum PTH level (2 pg/mL) excluded phosphorus intoxication. Magnesium salts treatment alone (p.o.) was introduced but this treatment did not improve serum magnesium level as well as calcium concentration. Primary magnesium deficiency was excluded and therefore calcium salts supplementation and 1alpha(OH)D3 therapy, typical for HPT, was initiated combined with slow-released magnesium salts. Difficulties in the treatment tended to look for the digestive tract defects and finally, based on endomysial antibodies and duodenal biopsy the coeliac disease was confirmed. With gluten-free diet the significant improvement of calcium-phosphorus parameters has been observed showing that the autoimmune background of hypoparathyroidism is very likely.},

   abstract = {Midaortic syndrome is a variety of aortic coarctation, located in the distal thoracic aorta, the abdominal aorta or both, involving the intestinal and renal vessels, usually presenting with renovascular arterial hypertension. Underlying conditions are thought to be Takayasu's arteritis, von Recklinghausen's disease, and connate hypoplasia. Celiac disease is an inflammation in the small intestine, triggered by an allergic reaction to gluten. It is known to be associated with a variety of other autoimmune disorders, e.g., dermatitis herpetiformis (Duhring's disease), insulin-dependent diabetes mellitus, and IgA nephropathy. We describe the case of a young woman who presented with claudication of the lower limbs, therapy-refractory arterial hypertension, and untreated celiac disease. We found a midaortic syndrome, characterized by severe stenosis of the infrarenal aorta, of both renal arteries (more pronounced on the right side) and of the inferior mesenteric artery. We assume that-after having excluded other possible pathogeneses-the underlying condition is a local vasculitis in the abdominal aorta and the renal and mesenteric arteries due to the chronic inflammation of untreated celiac disease. We performed a percutaneous transluminal angioplasty together with implantation of two stents into the infrarenal aorta and the right renal artery and started treating the celiac disease by dietary intervention. The patient is now under regular medical control and observation.},

   abstract = {In the past, celiac disease (CD), or intolerance to gluten, was considered a rare disease of infancy characterized by chronic diarrhea with malabsorption and delayed growth. Besides the overt enteropathy, there are other clinic and subclinical forms which appear later in life. Target organs are not limited to the gut, but include liver, thyroid, skin and female and male reproductive systems. CD interference on reproduction is related to the multifactorial nature of the disease, whose pathological manifestations can be modulated, besides gluten, by different concurrent genetic and environmental factors. CD induces malabsorption with consequent deficiencies of micronutrients such as iron, folic acid and vitamin K, which are essential for organogenesis, and fat-soluble vitamins important for spermatogenesis. Regarding endocrine disorders, the deficiencies of specific trace elements on ovarian function could explain its involvement in the increased risk of female osteoporosis in CD patients. Affected males show a picture of tissue resistance to androgens; the increases of follicle-stimulating hormone and prolactin, not associated with infertility, may indicate an imbalance at hypothalamus-pituitary level, with general effects on health. Since reproductive alterations are reversible, adoption of a gluten-free diet supported by early diagnosis is important. Therefore, the detection of early biomarkers, such as deficiencies of vitamins and/or iron and andrological or endocrinological dysfunctions, should trigger timely strategies for prevention and treatment.},

The pathologic lesion of the small intestinal mucosa is characterized by the loss of absorptive villi, crypt cell hyperplasia, and infiltration of the lamina propria with inflammatory cells. The clinical presentation of celiac disease varies greatly depending on patient's age, duration and extent of the disease, and the presence of extraintestinal manifestations. The classical symptoms like diarrhea, weight loss and abdominal pain are seen less common. Unfortunately, most patients with celiac disease have either silent or atypical presentations, thus escaping diagnosis for several years. The pathologic changes and symptoms resolve when gluten is excluded from the diet for a sustained period. Untreated celiac disease is associated with significant risk of the development of enteropathy-associated intestinal lymphoma.},

   abstract = {BACKGROUND AND AIM: Diagnosis of coeliac disease is based on the demonstration of enteropathy in a small bowel biopsy. Correct diagnosis is of utmost importance, since the need for dietary management is life long, and inadequate treatment may lead to potentially serious complications. The Swedish Working Group for Paediatric Coeliac Disease has published guidelines for the diagnosis of childhood coeliac disease. The present questionnaire was designed in order to create the basis for revision of those guidelines. METHODS: In 2004, a nationwide questionnaire concerning current diagnostic routines was sent to all 45 paediatric clinics performing small bowel biopsy. All clinics responded. RESULTS: All clinics base their diagnosis on small bowel biopsy findings at presentation. Furthermore, in 24 (53%) of the clinics, children with suspected coeliac disease are investigated by small bowel biopsy both at presentation and follow-up while on a gluten-free diet. Eighteen (40%) of the clinics employ a different diagnostic routine for children under 2 y of age than for those older than 2 y. All clinics use coeliac serological testing at various stages of the diagnostic procedure. CONCLUSION: All Swedish paediatric clinics perform a small bowel biopsy at presentation in children with suspected coeliac disease, and the majority of clinics perform a second biopsy when the child is on a gluten-free diet. Serological testing is frequently used as a diagnostic aid and in the monitoring of the disease while on a gluten-free diet.},

   abstract = {BACKGROUND: There is an increased prevalence of osteoporosis among patients with celiac disease. However, the relative prevalence of celiac disease among osteoporotic and nonosteoporotic populations is not known, and the benefit of screening the osteoporotic population for celiac disease remains controversial. METHODS: We evaluated 840 individuals, 266 with and 574 without osteoporosis, from the Washington University Bone Clinic by serologic screening for celiac disease. Individuals with positive serologic test results for antitissue transglutaminase or antiendomysial antibody were offered endoscopic intestinal biopsy to confirm the diagnosis of celiac disease. Individuals with biopsy-proven celiac disease were treated with a gluten-free diet and followed up for improvement in bone mineral density. RESULTS: Twelve (4.5%) of 266 patients with osteoporosis and 6 (1.0%) of 574 patients without osteoporosis tested positive by serologic screening for celiac disease. All but 2 serologically positive individuals underwent in-testinalbiopsy. Nine osteoporotic patients and 1 nonosteoporotic patient had positive biopsy results. The prevalence of biopsy-proven celiac disease was 3.4% among the osteoporotic population and 0.2% among the nonosteoporotic population. All biopsy-positive individuals tested positive by antitissue transglutaminase and antiendomysial antibody. The antitissue transglutaminase levels correlated with the severity of osteoporosis as measured by T score, demonstrating that the more severe the celiac disease the more severe the resulting osteoporosis. Treatment of the patients with celiac disease with a gluten-free diet resulted in marked improvement in T scores. CONCLUSIONS: The prevalence of celiac disease among osteoporotic individuals (3.4%) is much higher than that among nonosteoporotic individuals (0.2%). The prevalence of celiac disease in osteoporosis is high enough to justify a recommendation for serologic screening of all patients with osteoporosis for celiac disease.},

   abstract = {Celiac disease (CD) patients are intolerant to gluten, proteins in wheat, and related cereals. Virtually all patients are human leukocyte antigen (HLA)-DQ2 or HLA-DQ8 positive and several studies have demonstrated that CD4 T cells specific for (modified) gluten peptides bound to these HLA-DQ molecules are found in patients but not in control subjects. These T cell responses are therefore thought to be responsible for disease development. Many immunogenic gluten peptides which may relate to the disease-inducing properties of gluten have now been identified. In addition, gluten can stimulate IL-15 production that ultimately leads to NKG2D-mediated epithelial cell killing. However, CD develops in only a minority of HLA-DQ2 and HLA-DQ8 individuals. This may be attributed to the default setting of the intestinal immune system: induction and maintenance of tolerance to dietary components and commensal flora. Although at present it is unknown why tolerance in CD is not established or broken, both environmental and genetic factors have been implicated. There is strong evidence for the existence of genes or gene variants on chromosomes 5, 6, and 19 that predispose to CD. In addition, type I interferons have been implicated in development of several autoimmune disorders, including CD. Thus, viral infection and/or tissue damage in the intestine may cause inflammation and induce protective Th1-mediated immunity leading to loss of tolerance for gluten. Once tolerance is broken, a broad gluten-reactive T cell repertoire may develop through determinant spreading. This may be a critical step toward full-blown disease.},

   abstract = {PURPOSE OF REVIEW: The default response to protein antigens in the intestine is the induction of systemic and local hyporesponsiveness, ensuring the prevention of coeliac disease and food allergies. Interest is increasing in the role of dietary manipulation and probiotics in treating allergic and other diseases, but less is known about how these regimens might influence systemic and local immune responses. This paper addresses the mechanisms at the interface of innate and adaptive immunity that determine how the body responds to orally administered proteins and how local bacteria modify these. RECENT FINDINGS: This paper discusses evidence that dendritic cells in the intestinal mucosa are the critical cells that take up dietary proteins and migrate to the draining mesenteric lymph node, where they induce regulatory CD4 T-cell differentiation. The properties of tolerized T cells are discussed and it is proposed that the gut microenvironment maintains homeostasis by conditioning dendritic cells to remain in a quiescent state. Inhibitory signalling by commensal bacteria possibly contributes to this process. SUMMARY: A regulatory network controls how dietary antigens are taken up and presented to T lymphocytes by specialized antigen-presenting cells. Elucidating their nature and how they are influenced by external factors such as probiotics may help develop novel therapies for allergy and help understand diseases such as coeliac disease.},

   abstract = {BACKGROUND: Dermatitis herpetiformis (DH), a well-established gluten-sensitive skin disorder presenting variable degrees of enteropathy, constitutes a very useful model in order to assess the utility of the celiac disease (CD)-related serology in patients with mild intestinal damage. OBJECTIVE: Our aim was to explore comparatively the performance of a panel of CD-related serologic tests in patients with DH. METHODS: We assessed a series of 18 consecutive patients with skin biopsy proven DH presenting the overall spectrum of intestinal damage ranging from normal mucosa (n = 6) to total villous atrophy (TVA) (n = 6) through partial villous atrophy (PVA) (n = 6). Sera were obtained from all patients while consuming a gluten containing diet. Serologic tests were antiendomysial, anti-tissue transglutaminase and antigliadin antibodies, and newly developed tests detecting both antibody isotypes (IgA and IgG) against deamidated synthetic gliadin-derived peptides (a-GDP). RESULTS: Serologic tests had a variable behaviour depending on the degree of enteropathy. While the majority of tests detected patients with TVA, only 50% of those with normal histology had positive assays. Patients with PVA had discordant results. Classical CD-specific tests were positive in only some patients with mild damage while all of them were identifed by a single assay detecting both isotypes of a-GDR CONCLUSION: The detection of a-GDP antibodies was the most reliable tool in order to identify gluten sensitivity in DH patients presenting a wide range of intestinal damage. Further studies should explore if these findings can be extrapolated to patients with CD having mild enteropathy.},

   abstract = {BACKGROUND & AIMS: Our aim was to explore the diagnostic value of a newly developed synthetic peptide antibody assay addressing specific synthetic gliadin-derived deamidated peptides (AGA II) for the diagnosis of celiac disease (CD). METHODS: We assayed serum samples obtained prospectively at diagnosis from a population of 92 consecutive adult patients with CD and 113 non-CD controls. Patients were reevaluated after 6 months (n = 56) and 1 year (n = 20) of treatment. All patients and controls underwent intestinal biopsy and a set of CD-related serology tests. A newly developed enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay (ELISA) for detecting IgA and IgG antibodies against synthetic deamidated gliadin epitopes was used. RESULTS: At diagnosis, sensitivity and specificity were 94.6% and 99.1% for AGA II IgA and 92.4% and 100% for AGA II IgG. Absolute values and the proportion of positive samples for both antibodies were significantly reduced at 6 months (P < .0000) and 1 year (P < .001) after initiation of a gluten-free diet. Compared with conventional AGA, the peptide antibodies had greater sensitivity, specificity, positive and negative predictive values, accuracy, and likelihood ratios. Compared with antitissue transglutaminase antibodies, AGA II had similar sensitivity but greater specificity and predictive values, better likelihood ratios, and an excellent agreement (kappa statistic = .92). CONCLUSIONS: This study assessed the value of an ELISA assay in detecting antibodies to gliadin-related peptides. This assay appears to be a reliable tool for diagnosing CD and suggests promising accuracy that may be very useful in clinical practice.},

   abstract = {AIM: The aim of this study was to explore the dilemmas experienced by women and men in their everyday lives in relation to their coeliac disease, and to explore the qualities of these dilemmas in relation to specific situations and living conditions. METHODS: We interviewed 43 informants, aged 20-40 years, using 'The Critical Incident Technique'. Interviews focused on situations that gave rise to confusion or discomfort in relation to disease. The interviews were transcribed verbatim and analysed qualitatively. RESULTS: We found 195 dilemmas, experienced in five arenas: food situation at work, during purchases, when travelling, in relation to meals at home and meals outside the home. Emotions, relationships and the management of daily life were the three main categories of dilemmas that emerged through the analysis. Specific emotions were experienced in relation to the disease, such as isolation, shame, fear of becoming contaminated by gluten and worries about being a bother. In the relationship with other persons the informants experienced a number of complicating dilemmas such as unwanted visibility, neglect, being forgotten, disclosure avoidance and risk taking. Dilemmas related to the management of daily life were restricted product choice, double work and constantly being on call. CONCLUSIONS: The lived experiences of coeliac disease were more varied and profound than expected. It is important to take psychological and social aspects into account in the treatment of patients with coeliac disease.},

   abstract = {INTRODUCTION: After first report of Cooke e Smith, numerous are the reports of Coeliac Disease (CD) and neuropsychological symptoms association. The neuropsychological symptoms may precede or follow the diagnosis of CD, representing sometimes the only clinic manifestations (atypical forms). It's seem that frequency of unknown CD in patients with neuropsychological symptoms is about 16% and in a recent study about 7% of new cases of CD was diagnosed in order of neuropsychological disorders. To explain this clinical association various are the hypothesis proposed. CASE REPORTS: We report n degrees 4 cases (middle age 11 years and 2 months) come to our clinic for neuropsychological symptoms; all had diagnosis of CD (by serologic screening and intestinal biopsy); nobody had nutritional deficit, sideropenic anaemia or thyroid deficits. In all patients the introduction of dietetic therapy resolved the symptoms. CONCLUSION: These cases represent atypical forms of CD manifested in childhood only by neuropsychological disorders. To make an early diagnosis and to improve the disease prognosis, the literature and our clinic experience shown that is useful screen the CD in all patients with neuropsychological disorders such as epileptics foci in the parietal-occipital region and/or occipital calcification, headache (mostly if there isn't familiarity), spinocerebellar ataxia, neuromuscular disease of unknown aetiology, Down syndrome, behavioural disorders and some psychiatric troubles.},

The patient presented elevation of the aminotransferases, upon detection of the Celiac Disease which was initially attributed to the underlying disease. However, despite the complete resolution of her articular symptoms with a gluten-free diet, the liver chemistry abnormalities persisted. This led to consider an autoimmune hepatitis as the cause which was documented with a liver biopsy three months after the diagnosis of the celiac disease and under a strict gluten-free diet. Treatment with prednisone and azathioprine was initiated with complete normalization of aminotransferase levels. We present the sequence of events with the results and a review of the literature.},

Twenty-three adults were prospectively studied: 10 controls and 13 subjects with untreated celiac disease. Distal duodenal biopsies were taken at baseline and after 6 months of a gluten-free diet and assessed for the expression of natural antibiotics. Epithelial human beta-defensin 1 in subjects with celiac disease had a median of 0.02 unit at baseline, compared with 0.34 unit in controls (P < 0.001). It correlated negatively with the degree of villous atrophy (r = -0.64, P = 0.019) and rose to 0.04 unit on the gluten-free diet (P = 0.035 vs. baseline, P < 0.001 vs. controls). The expression of other antibiotics was unchanged. The expression of epithelial natural antibiotics is limited in celiac disease.},

   abstract = {OBJECTIVE: To assess the degree of osteopenia in children with celiac disease (CD) at the time of diagnosis and the effect of a gluten-free diet (GFD). DESIGN: Longitudinal and prospective study. SUBJECTS: In total, 24 children (18 girls, six boys) diagnosed with CD by means of an intestinal biopsy were included in the study. Mean+/-s.d. age was 4.9+/-4.3 years. In all, 16 patients were under (2.20+/-0.82 year) and eight were over the age of 4 years (10.30+/-2.90 year). The time between the first symptoms and diagnosis was 17.30+/-24.70 months (range: 2-109 months). Spine bone mineral content (BMC), area and bone mineral density (BMD) were measured by DXA at baseline and 1.17+/-0.93 years after GFD. RESULTS: Before treatment, mean+/-s.d. BMD was 0.46+/-0.13 g/cm(2), the BMD Z-score was -1.36+/-1.20, and was below -1 s.d. in 14 patients (58%). BMC, area and BMD increased significantly on GFD. BMD increased from 0.46+/-0.13 to 0.55+/-0.13 g/cm(2) (P<0.001). BMD Z-score improved from -1.36+/-1.20 to -0.23+/-1.20 after GFD. However, BMD increased more than 1 s.d. in 15 of the 16 children under the age of 4 years, a similar increase was only observed in four of the eight children aged more than 4 years, some of whom did not follow GFD strictly. Height and weight increased significantly with GFD (P<0.001) and the increase correlated positively with the increase in BMD. CONCLUSIONS: Axial BMD below -1 s.d. was found in 58% of children with celiac disease. Axial bone mass reverted to normal values in most children under the age of 4, who had low bone mass, all of whom followed GFD strictly.},

   abstract = {OBJECTIVE: This survey was conducted to assess nutrient intakes and food consumption patterns of adults with coeliac disease who adhere to a strict gluten-free diet. DESIGN: Three-day estimated self-reported food records were used to assess daily intakes of calories, percent daily calories from carbohydrates, dietary fibre, iron, calcium and grain food servings. SUBJECTS: Volunteers for this survey were recruited through notices placed in coeliac disease support group newsletters, as well as a national magazine for persons with coeliac disease. Forty-seven volunteers met all criteria for participation and returned useable food records. RESULTS: Group mean daily intake of nutrients by gender: Males (n = 8): 2882 calories; 55% carbohydrate; 24.3 g dietary fibre; 14.7 mg iron; 1288.8 mg calcium; 6.6 grain food servings. Females (n = 39): 1900 calories; 52% carbohydrate; 20.2 g dietary fibre; 11.0 mg iron; 884.7 mg calcium; 4.6 grain food servings. Recommended amounts of fibre, iron and calcium were consumed by 46, 44 and 31% of women and 88, 100 and 63% of men, respectively. CONCLUSIONS: Nutrition therapy for coeliac disease has centred around food allowed/not allowed on a gluten-free diet. Emphasis also should be placed on the nutritional quality of the gluten-free diet, particularly as it concerns the iron, calcium and fibre consumption of women. The use of the estimated food record as the dietary survey method may have resulted in the under-reporting of energy intake. Due to the small sample size and possible bias of survey participants, the findings of this survey may not be representative of the larger coeliac community.},

   abstract = {The aim of the present study was to evaluate the epitope specific humoral human tissue transglutaminase (tTG) immunoreactivity against 3 different human recombinant tTG constructs [(full-length tTG (a.a. 1-687), tTG (a.a. 227-687); tTG (a.a. 473-687)] before and after the introduction of a gluten-free diet (GFD). To this end, sera from 64 celiac disease (CD) subjects on a gluten-containing diet (44 f, 20 m) and after 0.6 +/- 0.3 years and 2.1 +/- 1.3 years of GFD were studied using a quantitative radioimmunoprecipitation assay. All 64 CD patients at diagnosis were full-length anti-tTG (a.a. 1-687)Ab positive. These Abs significantly decreased in frequency and titer after 6 months and 2 years of GFD. However, at low titers, 64.1% (41/64) of CD patients were still fl-tTG (a.a. 1-687)Ab positive after 2 years of GFD. At disease diagnosis, 70.3% (45/64) of the CD patients had Abs directed against fragments (227-687) and/or (473-687) of the tTG protein. This percentage, after 2 years of GFD, significantly decreased to 18.7%, whereas almost 50% of GFD patients had no tTG (227-687) and tTG (473-687) fragment reactivity, but only persistent, low-titer full-length tTG (1-687)Abs. We suggest that the selective loss of immunoreactivity against tTG (227-687) and tTG (473-687) fragments in CD patients with a GFD, could be due to quantitative decrease of autoreactivity driven by tTG-gliadin interaction underlying celiac disease pathogenesis.},

METHODS: The study group comprised children with CD, consecutively diagnosed according to current criteria given by the European Society for Paediatric Gastroenterology, Hepatology, and Nutrition. Thirty-six children were studied at presentation, i.e., on a normal gluten-containing diet, with clinical symptoms and signs indicative of CD, positive celiac serology markers, and a small bowel biopsy showing severe enteropathy. Forty-seven patients were studied when they had been on a gluten-free diet (GFD) for at least 3 months. For comparison, a group of 42 healthy controls (HC) were studied. The functional status of the intestinal microflora was evaluated by gas-liquid chromatography of short chain fatty acids (SCFAs) in fecal samples. RESULTS: There was a significant difference between untreated CD children and HC as well as between treated CD children and HC regarding acetic, i-butyric, i-valeric acid, and total SCFAs. The propionic and n-valeric acids differed significantly between CD children on GFD and HC. Moreover, there was a strong correlation between i-butyric and i-valeric acids in all study groups. CONCLUSIONS: This is the first study of the SCFA pattern in fecal samples from children with CD. The results indicate that there is a difference in the metabolic activity of intestinal microbial flora in children with CD compared to that in HC. The finding of a different pattern of some SCFAs in celiacs both at presentation and during treatment with GFD indicates that it is a genuine phenomenon of CD not affected by either the diet, the inflammation, or the autoimmune status of the patient.},

Our aim was to investigate whether HLA-G, a gene located in the MHC class I region, and with important role in the induction of immunotolerance, may contribute to CD susceptibility. We demonstrated the expression of soluble HLA-G (sHLA-G) forms in intestinal biopsy and in serum of patients with CD. Indeed, all patients tested showed a positive expression of HLA-G in intestinal mucosa with different grade of immunoreaction. The serum levels of sHLA-G found in coeliac patients depend on the association with other diseases of autoimmune nature or genetics, and also depend on the transgressions in the diet with gluten ingested. The enhancer expression of sHLA-G in CD could be due as part of a mechanism to try restore the tolerance process towards oral antigens in a disease caused by loss of tolerance to dietary antigens and counteract the inflammation. In summary, in this paper, we demonstrate the association of CD with sHLA-G expression.},

   abstract = {BACKGROUND AND STUDY AIMS: Published follow-up data on small-intestinal recovery in patients with celiac disease are scarce and contradictory. This is especially the case for adult patients, who often show incomplete histological recovery after starting a gluten-free diet (GFD). We conducted a 2-year prospective study to evaluate the effectiveness of a GFD in improving the endoscopic and histological duodenal findings in adults with celiac disease. PATIENTS AND METHODS: We studied 42 consecutive adults with newly diagnosed celiac disease (13 men, 29 women; mean age 32.7 years, range 15 - 72 years). All the patients underwent esophagogastroduodenoscopy and small-bowel biopsy. We devised our own grading system for the endoscopic appearance of the duodenum, which ranged from "normal" appearance to "mild", "moderate", or "severe" alterations. Small-bowel biopsies were obtained from the second part of the duodenum (and from the duodenal bulb when it had a micronodular appearance). The histopathological appearances were described according to modified Marsh criteria. RESULTS: A normal endoscopic appearance in the duodenum was found in 5/42 patients (11.9 %) at entry and in 32/42 patients (76.2 %) after 2 years on a GFD. Subdividing the patients according to age, patients aged from 15 years to 60 years showed significant improvement within 12 months ( P < 0.0001 for patients aged from 15 years to 45 years; P < 0.003 for patients in the 46 years to 60 years group), whereas the improvement in endoscopic findings in patients older than 60 years was not statistically significant, even 24 months after starting the GFD. "Normal" histology was reported in none of the patients at entry, but in 25 patients (59.5 %) after 24 months on a GFD, but this parameter did not show a significant improvement until the patients had been on the GFD for 12 months ( P < 0.0001). Only the younger patients (5 - 30 years) showed significant improvement of histology within 12 months ( P < 0.034); older patients (>30 years) showed histological improvement but this was not statistically significant, even after 24 months on a GFD. CONCLUSIONS: This study shows for the first time that endoscopic recovery is faster than histological recovery in adults with celiac disease who go on a GFD. Moreover, older patients showed incomplete endoscopic and histological recovery even 24 months after starting a GFD. We therefore advise, as a minimum recommendation, that follow-up biopsies should be taken 1 - 2 years after starting a GFD in adults with celiac disease.},

   abstract = {BACKGROUND: Recent literature has shown a correlation between Crohn's disease (CD) and celiac disease, but a prospective study has not been performed. Our aim was to evaluate the prevalence of celiac disease in a consecutive series of patients affected by CD, in whom the disease was diagnosed for the first time. METHODS: From January to December 2004, we diagnosed 27 patients affected by CD (13 men and 14 women; mean age, 32.3 yrs; range, 16-69 yrs). In all patients, we performed antigliadin, antiendomysium, and antitransglutaminase antibody tests, and the sorbitol H2 breath test evaluation. In case of antibodies and/or sorbitol positivity, esophagogastroduodenoscopy was performed for a small bowel biopsy. RESULTS: Antigliadin, antiendomysium, and antitransglutaminase antibody tests were positive in 8/27 (29.63%), 4/27 (14.81%), and 5/27 (18.52%) patients, respectively, whereas the sorbitol H2 breath test was positive in 11/27 (40.74%) patients: all of them underwent esophagogastroduodenoscopy. Nine of 11 patients showed signs of duodenal endoscopic damage, and 5/9 (55.55%) showed histologic features of celiac disease (18.52% of overall CD population studied): 2 showed Marsh IIIc lesions (1 patient affected by ileal CD and 1 affected by ileo-colonic CD), 2 showed Marsh IIIb lesions (all of them affected by ileo-colonic CD), 1 showed a Marsh IIIa lesion (1 patient affected by colonic CD). CONCLUSIONS: Prevalence of celiac disease seems to be high among patients affected by CD, and this finding should be kept in mind at the time of the first diagnosis of CD; a gluten-free diet should be promptly started.},

At entry, 12 of 32 (38%) pts showed signs and symptoms of neurological damage: 7 of 12 (58%), peripheral neurological damage; 3 of 12 (25%), autonomic dysfunction; and 2 (17%), both peripheral neurological damage and autonomic dysfunction. The overall TNS score was 105 at entry. Anti-GM1 antibodies were present in 5 of 12 (42%) pts: 3 showed peripheral neurological damage and 2 showed both peripheral neurological damage and autonomic dysfunction. One year after the GFD was started, histological lesions were still present in only 10 of 12 (83%) pts. TNS score was 99, 98, 98, and 101 at the 3rd, 6th, 9th, and 12th month after the GFD was started, so it did not improve throughout the follow-up. None of the pts showed disappearance of antineuronal antibodies throughout the follow-up. We conclude that adult CD patients may show neurological damage and presence of antineuronal antibodies. Unfortunately, these findings do not disappear with a GFD.},

   abstract = {Coeliac disease has a strong genetic component, higher than for many other common complex diseases. Possession of the HLA-DQ2 variant is required for presentation of disease causing dietary antigens to T cells, although this is also common in the healthy population. Non-HLA genetic factors account for the majority of heritable risk. Linkage studies have identified promising regions on chromosomes 5 and 19, with multiple other loci awaiting definitive confirmation in independent studies. Inherited variants in the tightly clustered chromosome 2q CD28-CTLA4-ICOS region are associated with disease, although of weak effect size. Larger sample sizes are necessary in coeliac disease genetic studies to detect small effects, alternatively meta-analysis offers promise. Newer methods including gene expression analysis and genome wide association studies will advance understanding of genetic susceptibility. Identification of coeliac disease genes may improve diagnostic/prognostic markers, basic understanding of disease aetiology, permit development of novel therapeutics and provide insight into other autoimmune disorders.},

   abstract = {BACKGROUND AND AIMS: It is generally accepted that enteropathy-type intestinal lymphoma (EATL) arises against a background of gluten enteropathy. We investigate whether patients with this diagnosis had celiac disease or pre-existing celiac disease, based on gliadin and endomysium antibodies, as well as duodenal biopsies, HLA typing and response to gluten-free diet. METHODS AND RESULTS: Retrospective study of patients with the diagnosis of peripheral T cell lymphoma of the intestine between January 1990 and January 2002 at the university hospital Gasthuisberg Leuven (n = 14). Patients in whom serologic testing was performed or patients known with pre-existing celiac disease (CD) were included (n = 9). Six of these nine patients were tested for endomysium antibodies (AEM), none of them were positive. Of the six patients with biopsies of mucosa uninvolved by lymphoma, all of them had villous atrophy; five had increased intraepithelial lymphocytes (IEL). In the four patients were HLA typing was performed, the results were compatible with CD. The three patients with initially diagnosed celiac disease all improved on gluten free diet (control biopsies improved as well, but failed to normalise). Of the six other patients, one patient never started GFD, two didn't get better, one initially went better after GFD, and one went better with the concomitantly started chemotherapy. CONCLUSION: There are two possible explanations: Either these patients with EATL have indeed gluten intolerance but the sensitivity of AEM is overestimated in this patient population; or these patients don't have gluten intolerance and EATL itself can mimic CD or other factors mimicking CD are at risk for developing EATL.},

The patient, a 32-year-old man, has had persistent multiple erythematous bull-eye lesions in the stomach, small bowel, and large bowel for 3 years. Histologically, the lesions were well circumscribed and relatively superficial, composed of atypical medium-sized to large-sized lymphocytes with slightly irregular nuclear contours, a dispersed chromatin pattern, and clear cytoplasm. Immunohistochemistry and flow cytometry showed that the cells were NK cells expressing CD56 (aberrantly bright), T-cell intracellular antigen (TIA)-1, cytoplasmic CD3, and CD94, but not surface CD3, with bright aberrant expression of CD7 and a lack of other NK cell-associated markers. Polymerase chain reaction for rearrangement of the T-cell receptor-gamma chain gene showed no evidence of a clonal T-cell population, and in situ hybridization for Epstein-Barr virus encoded RNA was negative. There was no evidence of the involvement of peripheral blood or bone marrow. Although a diagnosis of extranodal NK/T-cell lymphoma was considered because of the atypical morphology and immunophenotypic aberrancy, no chemotherapy was given because of the relatively superficial nature of the infiltrates, lack of significant symptoms, and negativity for Epstein-Barr virus. Two years after initial presentation, the patient was found to have high titers of antigliadin antibodies with no other evidence of celiac disease. After instituting a gluten-free diet, many of the lesions regressed, suggesting that this atypical NK-cell proliferation may be driven by an anomalous immune response. Awareness of this case may prevent pathologists from misdiagnosing similar lesions as NK/T-cell lymphomas. It is as yet unknown whether this process occurs more commonly in patients with gluten sensitivity, or in other settings, and the pathogenesis is as yet undetermined.},

   abstract = {OBJECTIVE: Silent coeliac disease is reported in 1% of Caucasian populations, but there is a lack of knowledge of its natural course and the risk of complications. The need for population screening is debated. We sought for complications of untreated coeliac disease in a well-defined cohort of Finnish adults. MATERIAL AND METHODS: Subjects (n=2427, ages 24-39 years) attending the 21-year follow-up visit of the study "Cardiovascular Risk in Young Finns" completed an extensive questionnaire on their health, diet, social situation and family life, and were given a medical examination. Measurement of serum IgA-transglutaminase and IgA-endomysium antibodies identified 21 subjects with silent coeliac disease. RESULTS: The subjects with silent coeliac disease did not differ from the rest of the cohort in age, gender, stature, weight, medical diagnoses (autoimmune, malignant), health concerns, use of alternative medications, physical activity, or in the cause of death their parents. They had lower serum HDL-cholesterol (1.12 versus 1.29 mmol/L; p=0.015), as described for active coeliac disease. Fewer (5.3% versus 22.8%; p=0.047) had a university or college degree or worked in managerial or professional positions (28% versus 45%; p=0.112). CONCLUSIONS: The underachievement in education and working life observed in subjects with silent coeliac disease is a new and intriguing finding and may be related to the increased prevalence of depressive and disruptive behavioural disorders described in teenagers with untreated coeliac disease. Our findings add a new ingredient to the ongoing discussion regarding the need for population screening for silent coeliac disease.},

   abstract = {BACKGROUND: The benefits of serologic screening for coeliac disease in asymptomatic individuals are debatable. AIM: To investigate dietary compliance, quality of life and bone mineral density after long-term treatment in coeliac disease patients found by screening in risk groups. METHODS: The study comprised 53 consecutive screen-detected coeliac patients diagnosed 14 years (median) ago. Dietary compliance was assessed by interview, 4-day food record and serology. Quality of life was evaluated by the Psychological General Well-Being and SF-36 questionnaires, gastrointestinal symptoms by the Gastrointestinal Symptom Rating Scale and bone mineral density by dual-energy x-ray absorptiometry. Comparisons were made to 44 symptom-detected-treated coeliac patients, 110 non-coeliac subjects and the general population. RESULTS: A total of 96% of screen-detected and 93% of symptom-detected coeliac patients adhered to a strict or fairly strict gluten-free diet. In screen-detected patients, quality of life and gastrointestinal symptoms were similar to those in symptom-detected patients or non-coeliac controls and bone mineral density was similar to that in the general population. CONCLUSIONS: Long-term dietary compliance in screen-detected patients was good. Quality of life and bone mineral density were comparable with those in non-coeliac subjects and the general population. Active screening in coeliac disease risk groups seems to be reasonable rather than harmful.},

   abstract = {OBJECTIVE: Gluten-free diet treatment has been proposed to prevent the development of autoimmune diseases in coeliac subjects. The aim here was to investigate the occurrence of autoimmune disorders in relation to gluten intake in coeliac patients in a well-defined area. MATERIAL AND METHODS: The frequency of autoimmune disorders was evaluated in 703 adults and children with coeliac disease and in 299 controls with normal duodenal histology. Incidence figures were given per 10,000 person-years. In logistic regression analysis, where the prevalence of autoimmune disorders was a dependent variable, the effect of age at end of follow-up, age at diagnosis of coeliac disease, actual gluten exposure time, gender and diagnostic delay were assessed. RESULTS: The prevalence of autoimmune diseases was significantly higher in coeliac subjects than in controls. In logistic regression analysis, age at end of follow-up, age at diagnosis of coeliac disease and female gender increased the risk of autoimmune disorders, whereas actual gluten exposure time reduced the risk; diagnostic delay had no effect. A similar, though not statistically significant, trend was seen in childhood coeliac disease to that in the whole study group. CONCLUSIONS: Despite that fact that patients with coeliac disease are at increased risk of various autoimmune conditions, the duration of gluten exposure seems not to be of crucial importance in the development of autoimmune diseases.},

The risks have probably been overestimated, as patients with subtle forms have earlier remained undetected. PATIENTS: The study comprised 17,245 person-years of follow-up in 1147 patients. METHODS: The observed numbers of malignancies and causes of deaths were assessed, and compared to those expected, and standardised incidence ratio and standardised mortality ratio given. RESULTS: The occurrence of all malignant conditions was equal to that in the population both in coeliac disease and dermatitis herpetiformis: standardised incidence ratios of 1.2 (95% confidence intervals 0.9-1.5) and 1.0 (0.6-1.5), respectively. Five patients with coeliac disease and seven with dermatitis herpetiformis had developed non-Hodgkin lymphoma; standardised incidence ratios of 3.2 (1.0-7.5) and 6.0 (2.4-12.4), respectively. Four patients with coeliac disease and one with dermatitis herpetiformis had enteropathy-associated T-cell lymphoma, associated with inadequate dietary compliance. Mortality was increased (standardised mortality ratio 1.26; 1.00-1.55) in coeliac disease, but decreased in dermatitis herpetiformis (standardised mortality ratio 0.52; 0.36-0.72). CONCLUSION: The overall prognosis in our patients was good. Non-Hodgkin lymphoma emerged in patients with undiagnosed or poorly treated coeliac disease. The mortality rate in dermatitis herpetiformis was even lower than in the population. Our data support the early diagnosis and dietary treatment of these conditions.},

   abstract = {BACKGROUND AND AIMS: Patients with Helicobacter pylori gastritis are more likely to have increased duodenal intraepithelial lymphocytes (IEL); this can be reversed by H. pylori eradication. We hypothesized that: (1) H. pylori-infected celiac disease (CD) patients could have different clinicopathological features from noninfected subjects; and (2) the histopathological responses to a gluten-free diet could be different in H. pylori-infected and noninfected patients. METHODS: Duodenal and gastric biopsies obtained from 80 adults with histologically and serologically confirmed CD before and after 12-18 months of a gluten-free diet were retrospectively evaluated. Gastritis was classified and scored according to the Updated Sydney System; duodenal biopsies were classified using both the Marsh-Oberhuber and a simplified classification proposed by our group. RESULTS: At baseline, 30 patients had H. pylori infection and 50 did not; at follow-up five new infections were detected. Fifteen patients (3 H. pylori-positive and 12 negative) had lymphocytic gastritis. At baseline, a greater proportion of H. pylori-negative patients had severe villous atrophy (p < 0.01), but milder forms were more prevalent in H. pylori-positive patients (p < 0.01). After a gluten-free diet, significant improvement occurred in all duodenal features (p < 0.001), irrespective of H. pylori status; gastric variables did not change, except for lymphocytic, which resolved in 2 infected and 10 noninfected patients. CONCLUSIONS: The clinical features of CD patients are unrelated to H. pylori gastritis, and a gluten-free diet is equally effective in infected as in uninfected patients. The higher prevalence of milder duodenal lesions in CD patients with H. pylori infection suggests that lymphocytosis induced by H. pylori gastric infection becomes less obvious as profound inflammatory and structural changes alter the mucosal architecture. This study also provides further support for a pathogenetic relationship between CD and lymphocytic gastritis.},

   abstract = {We report the case of a 35-year-old woman with a diagnosis of coeliac disease at the age of 32 due to a severe malabsorption and flat mucosa without endomysial and tissue transglutaminase antibodies. The lack of clinical and histological improvement after 1 year of a gluten-free diet led to a diagnosis of refractory sprue. She had a good clinical response to steroids that were stopped after 3 months when she became pregnant. After delivery, she again started to complain of malabsorption with arthritis. Positivity for enterocyte autoantibodies together with a flat mucosa persistence allowed to identify a condition of autoimmune enteropathy; moreover, a rheumatological assessment gave evidence of an associated rheumatoid arthritis. Treatment by steroids and methotrexate brought to the remission of intestinal and articular symptoms together with an improvement of duodenal histology. This is the first description of an autoimmune enteropathy associated with rheumatoid arthritis. Autoimmune enteropathy should be always ruled out in patients with a villous atrophy unresponsive to a gluten-free diet, autoimmune manifestations and negativity of coeliac disease markers.},

AIMS: To investigate the correlation between anti-ganglioside antibodies and neurological involvement in coeliac disease before and after gluten-free diet. PATIENTS AND METHODS: Twenty-two untreated coeliac patients with neurological dysfunction and 30 untreated coeliacs without neurological dysfunction, 20 patients with neurological disorders, 50 autoimmune disease and 20 blood donors were tested for anti-GM1, anti-GD1b and anti-GQ1b IgG and IgM antibodies by enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay. RESULTS: IgG antibodies to at least one of the three antigens tested were positive in 64% of coeliac patients with neurological symptoms compared to 30% of coeliacs without neurological dysfunction (P=0.02), 50% of patients with neurological disorders (P=ns), 20% with autoimmune diseases (P=0.003) and none of blood donors (P=0.0001). A strict gluten-free diet determined anti-ganglioside antibody disappearance in about half of coeliacs. CONCLUSIONS: A significant correlation between anti-ganglioside antibodies and neurological disorders in patients with an underlying coeliac disease has been found. Anti-ganglioside antibodies may represent a new immunological marker to identify neurological impairment in patients with coeliac disease.},

A total of 657 children had either IA-2A (n 360) or GADA (n 335), and thirty-eight children had both GADA and IA-2A. In univariate analysis, male gender and maternal coeliac disease implied a risk of possessing IA-2A. Maternal type 2 diabetes, a high consumption of fresh cows milk at the age of 1 year and a late introduction of gluten were associated with a risk of GADA. Early cessation of breast-feeding (< 2 months of age) was associated with a risk of the simultaneous occurrence of both IA-2A and GADA. In logistic regression analysis, a high consumption of milk at the age of I year (odds ratio 2.6)represented a risk for GADA, and maternal coeliac disease (odds ratio 2.9) represented a risk for IA-2A. The combination of an early introduction of cows milk formula and a late introduction of gluten-containing food gave an odds ratio of 6.0 for positivity for at least one autoantibody at 1 and 21 years of age. The induction of autoantibodies by the age of 2(1/2) years has a male preponderance and is more common in children with maternal type 2 diabetes or maternal coeliac disease. Dietary risk factors for the induction of beta-cell autoantibodies in 21-year-old children are a short duration of breast-feeding, an early introduction of cows milk formula and a late introduction of gluten, as well as a high consumption of milk at the age of I year.},

AIM: To assess ileo-colonic LNH in ASD and control children and to test the hypothesis that there is an association between ileo-colonic LNH and ASD in children. PATIENTS AND METHODS: One hundred and forty-eight consecutive children with ASD (median age 6 years; range 2-16; 127 male) with gastrointestinal symptoms were investigated by ileo-colonoscopy. Macroscopic and histological features were scored and compared with 30 developmentally normal (non-inflammatory bowel disease, non-coeliac disease) controls (median age 7 years; range 1-11; 25 male) showing mild non-specific colitis in 16 cases (13 male) and normal colonic histology in 14 cases (12 male). Seventy-four ASD children and 23 controls also underwent upper gastrointestinal endoscopy. The influence on ileal LNH of dietary restriction, age at colonoscopy, and co-existent LNH elsewhere in the intestine, was examined. RESULTS: The prevalence of LNH was significantly greater in ASD children compared with controls in the ileum (129/144 (90%) vs. 8/27 (30%), P < 0.0001) and colon (88/148 (59%) vs. 7/30 (23%), P = 0.0003), whether or not controls had co-existent colonic inflammation. The severity of ileal LNH was significantly greater in ASD children compared with controls, with moderate to severe ileal LNH present in 98 of 144 (68%) ASD children versus 4 of 27 (15%) controls (P < 0.0001). Severe ileal LNH was associated with co-existent colonic LNH in ASD children (P = 0.01). The presence and severity of ileal LNH was not influenced by either diet or age at colonoscopy (P = 0.2). Isolated ileal LNH without evidence of pathology elsewhere in the intestine was a rare event, occurring in less than 3% of children overall. On histopathological examination, hyperplastic lymphoid follicles are significantly more prevalent in the ileum of ASD children (84/138; 61%) compared with controls (2/23; 9%, P = 0.0001). CONCLUSION: Ileo-colonic LNH is a characteristic pathological finding in children with ASD and gastrointestinal symptoms, and is associated with mucosal inflammation. Differences in age at colonoscopy and diet do not account for these changes. The data support the hypothesis that LNH is a significant pathological finding in ASD children.},

   abstract = {Celiac disease is a gastrointestinal disorder characterized by inflammation, leading to injury to the mucosal lining of the small intestine. The inflammation occurs when gliadin, a protein found in such gluten-containing foods as wheat, rye, and barley, is ingested by genetically susceptible individuals. The mucosal damage and subsequent malabsorption of nutrients leads to various complications. Researchers estimate that more than 2 million people in the United States have celiac disease-a prevalence that is greater than was previously believed. Approximately 60,000 Americans are diagnosed annually with celiac disease. Until recently, diagnosis has been complicated by the fact that the indicators of celiac disease are nonspecific. However, because of the development of new, easy-to-administer serology tests, diagnosis has become much less complicated. After conducting a review of the literature, the authors recommend a serologic testing sequence for diagnosis of celiac disease and urge that adults and children with an assortment of symptoms be tested for this disease. Common signs and symptoms of celiac disease include anemia, arthralgia, fatigue, infertility, neuropathy, and weight loss, in addition to such gastrointestinal symptomatology as abdominal pain, anorexia, bloating, constipation, and diarrhea. The only treatment for patients with celiac disease remains a gluten-free diet.},

STUDY: Case studies with description of associated clinical, biochemical, and genetic findings and review of literature. RESULTS: Five new cases and 7 additional cases found from literature search of hyperhomocysteinemia with celiac sprue are reported. Treatment with gluten-free diet and folic acid led to the variable improvement in homocysteine levels. MTHFR gene variants were present in the each of the new patients described. CONCLUSIONS: Untreated celiac disease may be associated with hyperhomocysteinemia caused by a combination of vitamin deficiencies and variants in the MTHFR gene. Abnormalities do not consistently improve with gluten-free diet. The abnormal findings could result from vitamin deficiencies or variant MTHFR status. Possible clinical implications for patients with celiac disease and hyperhomocysteinemia are reviewed.},

   abstract = {Coeliac disease (CD) is an intestinal disorder caused by intolerance to dietary gluten in susceptible individuals. The HLA-DQ genes are major risk factors for CD, but other genes also play an important role in the disease susceptibility. Immune-mediated mechanisms are known to underlie the pathogenesis of CD. We studied single-nucleotide polymorphisms in transforming growth factor (TGF)-beta1, interleukin (IL)-10, IL-6, interferon (IFN)-gamma and tumour necrosis factor (TNF)-alpha genes in the Finnish population using family-based association approach. In addition, we genotyped a trinucleotide repeat polymorphism in the major histocompatibility complex (MHC) class I chain-related protein A (MICA) gene, located in the human leucocyte antigen (HLA) region in the vicinity of TNF-alpha. To control the effect of linkage disequilibrium between HLA-DQ genes and MICA and TNF-alpha, an HLA-stratified association analysis was performed. We did not find evidence of association between TGF-beta1, IL-10, IL-6 and IFN-gamma polymorphisms and CD susceptibility. No association was found for any of the MICA alleles independently of DQ genes, whereas TNF-alpha-308 A allele was slightly overrepresented on chromosomes carried by CD patients compared with control chromosomes, indicating that either TNF-alpha, or another gene in linkage disequilibrium with it, could confer increased susceptibility to CD. This result supports the earlier findings that the HLA region harbours a novel susceptibility factor in addition to HLA-DQ.},

   abstract = {Human leukocyte antigen DQ2 is a class II major histocompatibility complex protein that plays a critical role in the pathogenesis of Celiac Sprue by binding to epitopes derived from dietary gluten and triggering the inflammatory response of disease-specific T cells. Inhibition of DQ2-mediated antigen presentation in the small intestinal mucosa of Celiac Sprue patients therefore represents a potentially attractive mode of therapy for this widespread but unmet medical need. Starting from a pro-inflammatory, proteolytically resistant, 33-residue peptide, LQLQPFPQPELPYPQPELPYPQPELPYPQPQPF, we embarked upon a systematic effort to dissect the relationships between peptide structure and DQ2 affinity and to translate these insights into prototypical DQ2 blocking agents. Three structural determinants within the first 20 residues of this 33-mer peptide, including a PQPELPYPQ epitope, its N-terminal flanking sequence, and a downstream Glu residue, were found to be important for DQ2 binding. Guided by the X-ray crystal structure of DQ2, the L11 and L18 residues in the truncated 20-mer analogue were replaced with sterically bulky groups so as to retain high DQ2 affinity but abrogate T cell recognition. A dimeric ligand, synthesized by regiospecific coupling of the 20-mer peptide with a bifunctional linker, was identified as an especially potent DQ2 binding agent. Two such ligands were able to attenuate the proliferation of disease-specific T cell lines in response to gluten antigens and, therefore, represent prototypical examples of pharmacologically suitable DQ2 blocking agents for the potential treatment of Celiac Sprue.},

   abstract = {HLA-DQ2 predisposes an individual to celiac sprue by presenting peptides from dietary gluten to intestinal CD4(+) T cells. A selectively deamidated multivalent peptide from gluten (LQLQPFPQPELPYPQPELPYPQPELPYPQPQPF; underlined residues correspond to posttranslational Q --> E alterations) is a potent trigger of DQ2 restricted T cell proliferation. Here we report equilibrium and kinetic measurements of interactions between DQ2 and (i) this highly immunogenic multivalent peptide, (ii) its individual constituent epitopes, (iii) its nondeamidated precursor, and (iv) a reference high-affinity ligand of HLA-DQ2 that is not recognized by gluten-responsive T cells from celiac sprue patients. The deamidated 33-mer peptide efficiently exchanges with a preloaded peptide in the DQ2 ligand-binding groove at pH 5.5 as well as pH 7.3, suggesting that the peptide can be presented to T cells comparably well through the endocytic pathway or via direct loading onto extracellular HLA-DQ2. In contrast, the monovalent peptides, and the nondeamidated precursor, as well as the tight-binding reference peptide show a much poorer ability to exchange with a preloaded peptide in the DQ2 binding pocket, especially at pH 7.3, suggesting that endocytosis of these peptides is a prerequisite for T cell presentation. At pH 5.5 and 7.3, dissociation of the deamidated 33-mer peptide from DQ2 is much slower than dissociation of its constituent monovalent epitopes or the nondeamidated precursor but faster than dissociation of the reference high-affinity peptide. Oligomeric states involving multiple copies of the DQ2 heterodimer bound to a single copy of the multivalent 33-mer peptide are not observed. Together, these results suggest that the remarkable antigenicity of the 33-mer gluten peptide is primarily due to its unusually efficient ability to displace existing ligands in the HLA-DQ2 binding pocket, rather than an extremely low rate of dissociation.},

   abstract = {BACKGROUND: Celiac disease is a small intestine inflammatory disorder with multiple organ involvement, sustained by an inappropriate immune response to dietary gluten. Anti-transglutaminase antibodies are a typical serological marker in patients with active disease, and may disappear during a gluten-free diet treatment. Involvement of infectious agents and innate immunity has been suggested but never proven. Molecular mimicry is one of the mechanisms that links infection and autoimmunity. METHODS AND FINDINGS: In our attempt to clarify the pathogenesis of celiac disease, we screened a random peptide library with pooled sera of patients affected by active disease after a pre-screening with the sera of the same patients on a gluten-free diet. We identified a peptide recognized by serum immunoglobulins of patients with active disease, but not by those of patients on a gluten-free diet. This peptide shares homology with the rotavirus major neutralizing protein VP-7 and with the self-antigens tissue transglutaminase, human heat shock protein 60, desmoglein 1, and Toll-like receptor 4. We show that antibodies against the peptide affinity-purified from the sera of patients with active disease recognize the viral product and self-antigens in ELISA and Western blot. These antibodies were able to induce increased epithelial cell permeability evaluated by transepithelial flux of [(3)H] mannitol in the T84 human intestinal epithelial cell line. Finally, the purified antibodies induced monocyte activation upon binding Toll-like receptor 4, evaluated both by surface expression of activation markers and by production of pro-inflammatory cytokines. CONCLUSIONS: Our findings show that in active celiac disease, a subset of anti-transglutaminase IgA antibodies recognize the viral protein VP-7, suggesting a possible involvement of rotavirus infection in the pathogenesis of the disease, through a mechanism of molecular mimicry. Moreover, such antibodies recognize self-antigens and are functionally active, able to increase intestinal permeability and induce monocyte activation. We therefore provide evidence for the involvement of innate immunity in the pathogenesis of celiac disease through a previously unknown mechanism of engagement of Toll-like receptor 4.},

   abstract = {UNLABELLED: OBJECTIVE We sought to evaluate the impact of the gluten-free diet on the 5,240 members of the Canadian Celiac Association (CCA). Data are presented on 2,681 adults (>or=16 years) with biopsy-proven celiac disease (CD). METHODS: A mail-out survey was used. Quality of life was evaluated using the 'SF12', and celiac-specific questions. RESULTS: Mean age was 56 years, mean age at diagnosis was 45 years, and 75% were female. The 'SF12' summary scores were similar to normative Canadian data, but were significantly lower for females and newly diagnosed patients. Respondents reported: following a gluten-free (GF) diet (90%), improvement on the diet (83%), and difficulties following the diet (44%), which included: determining if foods were GF (85%), finding GF foods in stores (83%), avoiding restaurants (79%), and avoiding travel (38%). Most common reactions to consumed gluten (among 73%) included pain, diarrhea, bloating, fatigue, nausea, and headache. Excellent information on CD and its treatment was provided by the CCA (64%), gastroenterologists (28%), dietitians (26%) and family doctor (12%). CONCLUSIONS: Quality of life in those with CD could be increased with early diagnosis, increased availability of gluten-free foods, improved food labelling, and better dietary instruction. Education of physicians and dietitians about CD and its treatment is essential.},
