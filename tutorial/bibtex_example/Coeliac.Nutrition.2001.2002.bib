   abstract = {BACKGROUND: The relationship between celiac disease and juvenile diabetes has long been known. Only a single study in the United States, from Buffalo, New York, has reported the prevalence of celiac disease in a pediatric diabetic population. This study was conducted to determine the prevalence and clinical presentation of celiac disease in children and adolescents with juvenile diabetes in Wisconsin, USA, using serum antiendomysial antibody as a screening test. METHODS: Two hundred eighteen patients with diabetes (113 males; age range, 4-21 years) and 117 age-and gender-matched control participants were tested for immunoglobulin A endomysial antibody. Patients with positive results were offered a small bowel biopsy. A questionnaire regarding abdominal pain, diarrhea, and growth failure was completed by the parents. RESULTS: Seventeen of 218 diabetic patients (7.7%) had positive endomysial antibody. All control participants had negative results for the endomysial antibody. Small bowel biopsy was performed in 14 patients. Ten patients had villous atrophy. In one patient without villous atrophy, a repeat biopsy 2 years later showed villous atrophy, and two patients had increased intraepithelial lymphocytes without villous atrophy. Seventy percent of the patients with celiac disease were asymptomatic. The reported symptoms were abdominal pain and diarrhea (n = 1) and growth failure (n = 2). Two patients with celiac disease had Down syndrome. CONCLUSIONS: The prevalence of celiac disease in children with juvenile diabetes in Wisconsin is at least 4.6%, which is comparable with European and Canadian studies. Because patients without villous atrophy may have latent celiac disease, the prevalence may be even higher. All children with juvenile diabetes should be screened for celiac disease.},

The objective of this study was to present the clinical, electrophysiologic, and neuroradiologic features in a series of patients with this syndrome. Thirty-two patients with the constellation of epilepsy, occipital calcifications, and celiac disease were identified in our epilepsy clinic. The mean age was 11 years and the mean length of follow-up was 7.4 years. The 1990 criteria of the European Society of Pediatric Gastroenterology and Nutrition were used to diagnose celiac disease. The Kruskal-Wallis statistics test was employed with a signficance of P < .05. Thirty-one patients had partial seizures, 21 of them with symptoms related to the occipital lobe. In most patients, the epilepsy was controlled or the seizures were sporadic. Three developed severe epilepsy. Occipital calcifications were present in all cases. Computed tomography in 7 patients showed hypodense areas in the white matter around calcifications, which decreased or disappeared after a period of gluten-free diet in 3 patients. A favorable outcome of epilepsy was detected in patients with the earliest dietary therapy. This study presents the largest series of children with this syndrome outside Italy. White-matter hypodensities surrounding calcifications are rarely reported. A prompt diagnosis of celiac disease might improve the evolution of the epilepsy and may improve cognitive status.},

   abstract = {BACKGROUND: There are, as yet, no data available about the incidence of celiac disease in Libya. The aim of this study was to test the occurrence of serologic markers in a group of Libyan children with positive clinical and histologic findings indicative of celiac disease diagnosis. METHODS: Thirty-nine children with untreated celiac disease and 50 healthy school children, all younger than 14 years, were included in the study. Enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay for immunoglobulin G and immunoglobulin A (IgA) antigliadin, antitissue transglutaminase, and anticalreticulin antibodies was used to evaluate the serologic markers of the celiac patients. Immunoglobulin A antiendomysial antibodies were detected by indirect immunofluorescence using human umbilical cord tissue. RESULTS: Clinical symptoms at presentation were weight loss (82%), abdominal distension (61.5%), diarrhea or steatorrhea (59%), pallor (41%), abdominal pain (20.5%), constipation (15%), vomiting (10%), and short stature (7.7%). Most of these symptoms disappeared after introduction of a gluten-free diet. Of 39 patients, only 23 (59%) were endomysium positive and positive also in all other serologic markers. The second group of patients with positive clinical and biopsy findings but antiendomysial antibody-negative findings was subdivided into two subgroups according to the IgA antigliadin antibody results. Individuals in the IgA gliadin-negative subgroup also lacked IgA autoantibodies. CONCLUSIONS: The authors' findings stress the importance of serologic testing not only for screening but also for confirmation of celiac disease.},

   abstract = {BACKGROUND: Coeliac sprue is a chronic disease, in which there is a characteristic mucosal lesion of the small intestine and impaired nutrient absorption, which improves upon the withdrawal of wheat gliadins and related grain proteins from the diet. Biopsy specimens demonstrate diffuse enteritis with pronounced atrophy or total loss of villi. There is also a long term risk of malignant disease. AIMS: To compare the immunoexpression of DCC (deleted in colon cancer), p53, E-cadherin, and beta-catenin in the duodenal mucosa of children with coeliac disease with that seen in children with no evidence of small intestinal disease. METHODS: To gain more insight into the genetic and immunohistochemical alterations of the duodenal epithelium in coeliac disease, 21 endoscopic biopsies from children with coeliac disease and 10 duodenal biopsies from children without coeliac disease were immunohistochemically evaluated for p53, DCC, E-cadherin, and beta-catenin. RESULTS: DCC expression was not reduced in patients with coeliac disease compared with those without coeliac disease. p53 positive nuclear immunostaining was seen in seven of the 21 patients with coeliac disease. Positive nuclear staining was seen mainly in the deep and the lateral aspects of the crypts. All patients in the control group were negative for p53. In nine and three of the 21 patients with coeliac disease, respectively, the immunohistochemical expression of E-cadherin and beta-catenin was reduced. However, both E-cadherin and beta-catenin immunostaining in the control group was not altered. CONCLUSIONS: E-cadherin and beta-catenin were reduced in the duodenal epithelium of children with coeliac disease when compared with normal mucosa. p53 was overexpressed in the duodenal mucosa of patients with coeliac disease. The reduced expression of E-cadherin and beta-catenin and p53 overexpression may contribute to the morphological changes seen in the small intestinal mucosa in coeliac disease.},

Immunologic, environmental, infective and genetic factors equally can play role in their development. Antibodies to an oligomannose epitope of the Saccharomyces cerevisiae demonstrated in 60-70% of the patients with Crohn's disease. The origin and the clinicopathological role are not clarified. It is important that there are no surveys with patients suffering in gluten sensitive enteropathy in the literature. As there are no ASCA survey in Hungary, the aim of this study was to determine the prevalence of the ASCA. The authors examined at their patients the ASCA's occurrence and compared with the clinical picture of the Crohn's disease. The results supported the theory that ASCA positivity correlates with small intestines' Crohn's disease and in these cases both the IgG and IgA type antibodies proved. The antibodies in the sera at the analyzed ASCA positive cases prove a systemic immune response against Saccharomyces cerevisiae and the authors suggest the end of the oral tolerance against the yeast's antigens. The diet restriction (elemental diet, total parenteral nutrition, and fecal diversion) may ameliorate the status of the patients with Crohn's disease. It is speculated that the yeast-free diet as a part of the therapy for the ASCA positive patients can be reasonable: moreover the permanent "forbidding" of the yeast can be an acceptable alternative in case of getting well.},

   abstract = {OBJECTIVE: The study was carried out by the GFHGNP to determine the annual incidence of symptomatic celiac disease in children. PATIENTS AND METHODS: The diagnostic criteria were: symptomatic patients diagnosed under 15 years of age during 1996, villous atrophy and positivity of antigliadin and/or other antibodies. Cases were collected from referral centers, general hospital pediatric departments and private pediatricians with endoscopic practice. RESULTS: The study involved roughly half of the French pediatric population in 41 out of the 95 French districts. In all, 124 patients were collected: 76 girls and 48 boys. By geographical areas, in 30 districts where collection of data was complete which counted 186,285 births, the yearly incidence varied from 1/1731 births to 1/3110. (0.57@1000 to 0.32@1000). On the whole there were 77 cases i.e. an annual incidence of 1/2419 or 0.41@1000 (confidence interval 95%: 0.32 to 0.50@1000). Lower incidences were observed in the district of Paris: 1/4865 (0.21@1000) and Lyon: 1/3310 (0.27@1000). Those lower incidences could be explained by the difficulties of collecting the data in the biggest urban areas. The first signs occurred before one year of age in 73% of the cases, during the second year of life in 20.5% and after 3 in only 6.5%. The diagnosis was made before 2 years of age in 77% of the cases and after 3 in only 13%. In order of frequency symptoms were: failure to thrive (80%), diarrhea (59%), anorexia (59%), abdominal distension (57%), weight under 2 standard deviations (43%), short stature (43%). CONCLUSION: Compared with previous studies in two French districts between 1975 and 1990, the annual incidence of symptomatic celiac disease in children appears to be on the rise. The usual clinical signs continue to be observed.},

The development of systemic complications of severe acute pancreatitis such as septic multiple organ failure is closely related to infected necrosis. In this review, the factors predisposing to a severe course of acute pancreatitis are discussed as are clinical and laboratory markers which allow identification of patients at risk. Prevention of complications of acute pancreatitis is difficult. A variety of drugs including antiproteases and antiinflammatory agents have been shown to be of no benefit with regard to the reduction of severe complications. At present, based on the results of controlled trials, there is the widespread belief that prophylactic antibiotics are capable of reducing the incidence of infected pancreatic necrosis. New approaches for the prevention of systemic complications of severe acute pancreatitis are total enteral nutrition and local arterial infusion of antibiotics and antiproteases into the celiac trunk.},

   abstract = {INTRODUCTION: Celiac disease (nontropical sprue, gluten-sensitive enteropathy, chronic intestinal malabsorption disorder) is caused by gluten intolerance. This hereditary disorder is caused by sensitivity to gliadin. Because the body's own immune system causes the damage, celiac disease is considered to be an autoimmune disorder. However, it is also classified as a disease of malabsorption because nutrients are not absorbed. When people with celiac disease eat foods containing gluten, their immune system responds by damaging the small intestine. Specifically, tiny finger-like protrusions, called villi, on the lining of the small intestine are lost. The diagnosis is suspected on the basis of symptoms and signs, enhanced by laboratory and x-ray studies, and confirmed by biopsy revealing flat mucosa and subsequent clinical and histologic improvement on a gluten-free diet. Gluten must be excluded from diet. Supplementary vitamins, minerals and hematinics may be given depending on deficiency. CASE REPORT: This is a case report of a 23-year old female patient with a mineralization defect (osteomalacia) and secondary osteoporosis caused by long-time unrecognized celiac disease. The patient had many symptoms: short stature, steatorrhea, anemia, weight loss and chronic bone pain. Laboratory and x-ray studies and jejunal biopsy revealed a chronic intestinal malabsorption disorder caused by gluten intolerance. Gluten-free diet and supplementary vitamins, minerals and hematinics were included with apparent clinical remission. DISCUSSION AND CONCLUSION: Some people with celiac disease may not have symptoms. The undamaged part of their small intestine is able to absorb enough nutrients to prevent symptoms. However, people without symptoms are still at risk for complications of celiac disease. Biopsy of the small intestine is the best way to diagnose celiac disease. Decreased bone density (osteoporosis and osteomalacia) is a serious problem for celiacs. If calcium is not absorbed, due to small intestinal damage caused by untreated celiac disease, bones are not as dense. The only treatment for celiac disease is gluten-free diet, that is, avoiding all foods that contain gluten. For most people, this diet stops symptoms, heals the existing intestinal damage, and prevents further damage.},

   abstract = {BACKGROUND: A multicenter research study of Down syndrome patients was carried out to estimate the prevalence of celiac disease in patients with Down syndrome and to show clinical characteristics and laboratory data of Down syndrome patients. METHODS: The authors studied 1,202 Down syndrome patients. Fifty-five celiac disease patients (group 1) were compared with 55 immunoglobulin A antigliadin-positive antiendomysium antibodies-negative patients (group 2) and with 57 immunoglobulin A antigliadin-negative antiendomysium antibodies-negative patients (group 3). RESULTS: Celiac disease was diagnosed in 55 of 1,202 Down syndrome patients (4.6%). In group 1, weight and height percentiles were shifted to the left, whereas these parameters were normally distributed in groups 2 and 3. In celiac patients, diarrhea, vomiting, failure to thrive, anorexia, constipation, and abdominal distension were higher than in the other two groups. Low levels of hemoglobinemia, serum iron, and calcium were observed more frequently in group 1. The diagnosis of celiac disease was made after a mean period of 3.8 years from the initiation of symptoms. Sixty-nine percent of patients showed a classic presentation, 11% had atypical symptoms, and 20% had silent celiac disease. Autoimmune disorders were more frequent (30.9%) in group 1 than in the other two groups examined (15%; P < 0.05). CONCLUSIONS: This study reconfirms a high prevalence of celiac disease in Down syndrome. However, the diagnostic delay, the detection of atypical symptoms or silent form in one third of the cases, and the increased incidence of autoimmune disorders suggest the need for the screening of celiac disease in all Down syndrome patients.},

   abstract = {Since 1987, successive framework programmes have contributed to strengthen European food research through the establishment of networks between research institutions, universities and companies from various European countries. In the FAIR programme (1994-1998), 118 research projects comprising nearly 1,000 participants from the European Union and Associated States have been supported in the food area with a European funding of about [symbol: see text] 108 million. Within the Quality of Life and Management of Living Resources programme (1998-2002), food research is mostly supported within the key action 'food, nutrition and health' with a budget of [symbol: see text] 290 million. After the first four deadlines, 735 eligible research proposals have already been received. Further to their evaluation by a panel of independent experts, 108 proposals have been funded or selected for funding representing a total contribution of about [symbol: see text] 168 million. Among those, several clusters of projects are now running on important topics such as probiotics, coeliac diseases, mycotoxins, GMO, safety and food for the elderly. In addition, technology stimulation measures are largely benefiting SMEs to foster their innovation potential. In January 2000, the European Commission adopted a Communication entitled "Towards the European Research Area (ERA)" with the objective to contribute to developing better framework conditions for research in Europe. On 21 February 2001, the Commission adopted proposals to be submitted to the European Parliament and Council for the next framework programme for research and innovation (2002-2006). The new framework programme that is becoming one of the financial instruments of the ERA aims at catalysing the integration of European research by: strengthening of links between the Community research effort and national and regional research policies; concentrating on a limited number of priority fields or research to which activities at the Union level can add real value. One of the seven priority areas, entitled 'food safety and health risks', is intended to help establish the integrated scientific and technological bases needed to develop a system of production and distribution of safe and healthy food and control food-related risks, relying in particular on biotechnology tools, as well as health risks associated with environmental changes. A total budget of [symbol: see text] 600 million is proposed for this priority. In the priority areas, the new framework programme will work mainly by supporting the development of cooperation within networks of excellence bringing together the best research capabilities in Europe's regions to conduct common research programmes and integrated projects involving public and private partners, with clearly stated scientific and technological objectives.},

Besides chronic pain, about 80% of the patients develop acute pancreatitis, pseudocysts, compression of the main bile duct, serous effusion or digestive bleeding during the first five years of the disease course. Painful episodes are more frequent after 5 to 10 years, with a risk of jaundice and persistent pseudocyst formation. CHRONIC COURSE: Beyond 10 years, calcified stones and fibrosis progressively replace the pancreas parenchyma. Painful events become more parse and after 15 years, diabetes and exocrine insufficiency predominate. TREATMENT: Abstention from alcoholic beverages, analgesics administration and balanced diet are essential therapeutic elements. Insulin is required for the diabetes and pancreas extracts in gastroprotected microcapsules are needed to compensate for the chronic exocrine insufficiency. This medical treatment may be able to control pain but interventional radiology (pseudocyst drainage, antalgesic infiltration of the celiac plexus), interventional endoscopy (pseudocyst drainage, biliary stent, pancreatic endoprosthesis), or surgery (deviation of the bile ducts, wirsungojejunal derivation, exceptionally resection) may also be required.},

   abstract = {The effects of endotoxin on gastric emptying of a solid nutrient meal and the neural mechanisms involved in such a response were investigated in conscious rats. The intraperitoneal (i.p.) administration of E. coli endotoxin (40 microg/kg) significantly reduced the 4-h rate of gastric emptying of a standard solid nutrient meal. Ablation of primary afferent neurons by systemic administration of high doses of capsaicin (20+30+50 mg/kg s.c.) to adult rats did not modify the rate of gastric emptying in control animals but prevented the delay in gastric transit induced by endotoxin. Local application of capsaicin to the vagus nerve rather than application of capsaicin to the celiac ganglion significantly repressed endotoxin-induced delay in gastric emptying. Neither treatment modified the rate of gastric emptying in vehicle-treated animals. Blockade of CGRP receptors (CGRP 8-37, 100 microg/kg i.v.) did not alter gastric emptying in control animals but significantly prevented endotoxin-induced inhibition of gastric emptying. In contrast, a tachykinin receptor antagonist ([D-Pro2, D-Trp7.9]-substance P, 2 mg/kg i.p.) significantly reduced the rate of gastric emptying in control animals and did not modify the inhibitory effects of endotoxin. Adrenergic blockade with phentolamine (3 mg/kg i.p.) +/- propranolol (5 mg/kg i.p.) or muscarinic antagonism with atropine (0.1 mg/kg i.p.) failed to reverse the delay in gastric emptying induced by endotoxin. These observations indicate that endotoxin-induced delay in gastric emptying of a solid nutrient meal is mediated by capsaicin-sensitive afferent neurons.},

Diverging studies about adenovirus infection as a possible triggering factor in the pathogenesis have been reported. Our study was undertaken to determine whether enterovirus infection during pregnancy is a risk factor for the development of celiac disease later in childhood. METHODS: Cord blood from 76 mothers whose children developed celiac disease before 15 years of age were analyzed for IgA, IgG, and IgM antibodies for enteroviruses and Ig-A endomysium antibodies. The control group comprised cord blood from 327 mothers with children without known celiac disease. RESULTS: There were no significant differences in antibody titers for enterovirus between the two groups. IgA-endomysium antibodies were elevated in 3 of the 76 mothers, whereas none had known celiac disease. CONCLUSION: This study does not show that enterovirus infection during pregnancy is associated with the development of celiac disease in childhood. Of the mothers whose children developed celiac disease, 4% had Ig-A endomysium antibodies, which may reflect a silent celiac disease.},

   abstract = {BACKGROUND: Nutrient malabsorption is a negative prognostic factor in acquired immunodeficiency syndrome and recent studies have shown that pancreatic insufficiency is a codetermining factor of malabsorption. AIMS: To evaluate the effectiveness of open-label oral pancreatic enzyme supplementation therapy in acquired immunodeficiency syndrome patients with fat malabsorption. PATIENTS AND METHODS: Twenty-four consecutive patients with human immunodeficiency virus infection and fat malabsorption were recruited (11 males, 13 females; median age, 9.1 years). Faecal fat loss was evaluated by steatocrit assay at entry to the study (T-0), after 2 weeks (T-1) without pancreatic enzyme treatment and after a further 2 weeks (T-2) of treatment with pancreatic extracts (Creon 10 000 at a dose of 1000 units of lipase per gram of ingested dietary fat). Faecal elastase-1 and chymotrypsin were assayed at entry. RESULTS: Six patients (25%) had abnormally low elastase-1 and/or chymotrypsin faecal concentration. In all patients, steatocrit values were elevated at both T-0 and T-1. Five patients proved intolerant to pancreatic enzyme treatment because of the onset of abdominal pain, and therapy was discontinued. In the 19 patients who concluded the study, steatocrit values during pancreatic enzyme treatment (T-2) were significantly lower than at entry (P < 0.0001). At T-2, in eight of 19 patients, steatocrit values were within the normal limit and the frequency of cases cured or improved on pancreatic enzyme therapy (at T-2) was significantly higher than that observed during the previous study period without enzyme treatment (T-1) (P < 0.01). A positive significant correlation was found between steatocrit values at entry and the Centers for Disease Control class (P < 0.0005); also, the decrease in steatocrit values during pancreatic enzyme therapy (difference between steatocrit value at T-2 and steatocrit value at T-0) positively correlated with the Centers for Disease Control class (P < 0.05). CONCLUSIONS: This pilot, open-label study showed that pancreatic enzyme supplementation therapy is highly effective in reducing faecal fat loss in human immunodeficiency virus-infected patients with nutrient malabsorption. Further double-blind studies must be undertaken to verify these results and, if they are confirmed, pancreatic enzymes can be added to our weapons in the fight against human immunodeficiency virus-associated nutrient malabsorption.},

   abstract = {Recent data suggest that celiac disease, or gluten-sensitive enteropathy, is a common disorder not only in populations of European ancestry, but also in developing areas, such as North Africa, Middle East and India. The world distribution of celiac disease apparently relates to the consumption of gluten-containing cereals. In the Arab people of Saharawi, the prevalence of celiac disease in children is so high (more than 5%) that this condition represents a primary health problem. In developing countries the clinical picture of celiac disease is often typical, characterized by chronic diarrhea, malnutrition, stunting and increased mortality, especially in younger children. The high prevalence of celiac disease in areas showing a poor sanitary condition could be explained by a protective role of the celiac enteropathy (against intestinal infections) in the context of a low gluten consumption. The problem of celiac disease in developing countries should by approached by a multifaceted strategy, based on (1) increasing disease awareness and diagnostic facilities and (2) a "flexible" dietary intervention that takes into account the nutritional habits and local food availability.},

   abstract = {CONTEXT: Celiac disease is one of the most common lifelong disorders. Non-Hodgkin lymphoma is a possible complication of celiac disease and may lead to a large portion of lymphoma cases. OBJECTIVE: To quantify the risk for developing non-Hodgkin lymphoma of any primary site associated with celiac disease. DESIGN AND SETTING: Multicenter, case-control study conducted between January 1996 and December 1999 throughout Italy. PATIENTS: Cases were older than 20 years (median, 57; range, 20-92 years) with non-Hodgkin lymphoma of any primary site and histological type and were recruited at the time of the diagnosis. Controls were healthy adults (2739 men and 2981 women) from the general population. MAIN OUTCOME MEASURE: Positive test result for class A serum antiendomysial antibody. RESULTS: Celiac disease was diagnosed in 6 (0.92%) of 653 patients with lymphoma. Of the 6 cases, 3 were of B-cell and 3 were of T-cell origin. Four of 6 cases had lymphoma primarily located in the gut. In the control group, 24 (0.42%) had celiac disease. The odds ratio (adjusted for age and sex) for non-Hodgkin lymphoma of any primary site associated with celiac disease was 3.1 (95% confidence interval [CI], 1.3-7.6), 16.9 (95% CI, 7.4-38.7) for gut lymphoma, and 19.2 (95% CI, 7.9-46.6) for T-cell lymphoma, respectively. The risk for non-Hodgkin lymphoma for the overall population, which was adjusted for age and sex, was 0.63% (95% CI, - 0.12% to 1.37%). CONCLUSION: Celiac disease is associated with an increased risk for non-Hodgkin lymphoma, especially of T-cell type and primarily localized in the gut. However, the association does not represent a great enough risk to justify early mass screening for celiac disease.},

   abstract = {PURPOSE:Severe abdominal pain secondary to chronic pancreatitis is often multifactorial in origin. Lateral pancreaticojejunostomy (LPJ) is currently the accepted surgical treatment of choice when the main pancreatic duct is dilated. Chemical ablation of the celiac plexus for the treatment of intractable pain in chronic pancreatitis has been used without clear benefit. The aim of this study is to compare treatment outcomes of 2 groups of patients with the diagnosis of chronic pancreatitis and intractable abdominal pain (LPJ alone versus LPJ with intraoperative alcohol celiac ablation).Between 1994 and 1997, 34 patients underwent LPJ to control intractable pain secondary to chronic pancreatitis. These patients were divided into 2 groups, group 1 was LPJ only (16 patients) and group 2 was LPJ and intraoperative celiac ablation with 50% absolute alcohol (18 patients). Preoperative diagnosis and treatment criteria were similar for both groups. The clinical characteristics and outcome of both groups were retrospectively analyzed. Fisher exact test was used for statistical analysis.Demographic characteristics were similar in both groups. Pain control at short- and long-term follow-up was significantly improved in group 2 compared with group 1 (p < 0.035).Intraoperative celiac ablation in addition to LPJ appears to have a better response than does LPJ alone. Even though the number of patients is small, these results provide a basis for pursuing a prospective, randomized study to definitively answer this question.},

Some spondyloarthropathies are associated with transient ileocolic inflammation. Vasculitis frequently affects the gastrointestinal tract, predominantly manifesting with abdominal pain. In severe cases, intestinal ischemia and perforation may occur. Various arthritides are thought to be associated with other gastrointestinal diseases, such as celiac disease and hepatitis. The association between intestinal disease and arthritis is still being investigated. Interactions between the inflammatory intestinal cells and inflamed synovial cells have been demonstrated. Certain intestinal bacteria such as Klebsiella pneumoniae are suspected to play a role as triggers for the development of arthropathies. Genetic factors, especially human leukocyte antigen associations, are also being increasingly investigated for better characterization of the types of arthritis and possible prognostic implications. Various therapies, including nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drugs, used to treat rheumatologic diseases have the potential to cause gastrointestinal complications.},

   abstract = {BACKGROUND: Tissue transglutaminase enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay (tTG-ELISA) has recently been proposed as a simple and fast screening test for celiac disease (CD). The rate of false-positive and false-negative tests with tTG-ELISA, however, has not been definitively established. Therefore, the aim of our study was to investigate anti-tTG antibodies (TGA) not only in untreated patients with CD and in healthy controls, but also in a large group of patients with other autoimmune diseases. METHODS: The presence of TGA was investigated in sera from 111 patients with untreated CD, 96 patients with other autoimmune conditions (28 with autoimmune liver disease, 46 with insulin-dependent diabetes mellitus, 10 with inflammatory bowel syndrome, 12 with type 1 polyglandular syndrome) and from 100 healthy controls using guinea pig tTG-ELISA (gp-TG/ELISA) and highly purified recombinant human tTG-ELISA (h-TG/ELISA). Western blotting with guinea pig tTG was also performed. RESULTS: Ninety-four patients with CD who tested positive for antiendomysial antibodies (AEA) and one who tested negative for AEA showed antibodies against the gp-TG. Among the controls, 50% of patients with autoimmune liver disease and 6.5% of patients with insulin-dependent diabetes mellitus tested positive with gp-TG/ELISA. Western blotting experiments revealed that the high rate of positive tests observed using ELISA among the control group sera is attributable to impurities in the gp-TG preparation. However, h-TG/ELISA tests were positive for the sera from all patients who tested positive for AEA and from one control who tested negative for AEA, whereas h-TG/ELISA tests were negative for all CD patients who tested negative for AEA and for other controls who tested negative for AEA. CONCLUSIONS: The frequency of false-negative and false-positive tests represents the major limit to the use of gp-tTG/ELISA. However, because h-TG/ELISA is both simple and fast, it could be used in large screening programs for CD.},

   abstract = {Celiac disease is a permanent intolerance to dietary gluten. Its well known features are abdominal symptoms, malabsorption of nutrients, and small-bowel mucosal inflammation with villous atrophy, which recover on a gluten-free diet. Diagnosis is challenging in that patients often suffer from subtle, if any, symptoms. The risk of clinically silent celiac disease is increased in various autoimmune conditions. The endocrinologist, especially, should maintain high suspicion and alertness to celiac disease, which is to be found in 2-5% of patients with insulin-dependent diabetes mellitus or autoimmune thyroid disease. Patients with multiple endocrine disorders, Addison's disease, alopecia, or hypophysitis may also have concomitant celiac disease. Similar heredity and proneness to autoimmune conditions are considered to be explanations for these associations. A gluten-free diet is essential to prevent celiac complications such as anemia, osteoporosis, and infertility. The diet may also be beneficial in the treatment of the underlying endocrinological disease; prolonged gluten exposure may even contribute to the development of autoimmune diseases. The diagnosis of celiac disease requires endoscopic biopsy, but serological screening with antiendomysial and antitissue transglutaminase antibody assays is an easy method for preliminary case finding. Celiac disease will be increasingly detected provided the close association with autoimmune endocrinological diseases is recognized.},

PATIENTS AND METHODS: One hundred eighty-four patients with celiac disease (56 males, 128 females, age range 17-88 years) were classified according to diagnosis and symptoms of celiac disease during childhood. Prevalence of short stature, low fertility, clinical osteoporosis, cancer, and autoimmune disease were assessed in each celiac group and compared with a control group matched for gender and age. RESULTS: Compared with the control group, patients with celiac disease were shorter (men 171.4 +/- 9.0 cm vs 176.4 +/- 6.9 cm, P<0.01; women 159.7 + 7.3 cm vs 162.7 +/- 6.2 cm, P<0.01) and had a higher prevalence of symptomatic osteoporosis (5%) cancer (10%), and autoimmune disease (25%). Compared with matched controls and with patients whose celiac disease had been diagnosed during childhood (n=36), or who had remained symptom-free (n=95), patients who had undiagnosed symptomatic celiac disease during childhood exhibited higher prevalence of short stature (26%), low female fertility or low birth weight (36%). Multivariate analysis showed that short stature and low fertility correlated with duration of symptoms before diagnosis; osteoporosis and cancer correlated with age. The prevalence of autoimmune disease was unrelated to early onset of symptoms or delay to diagnosis. CONCLUSIONS: Missing the diagnosis of celiac disease in a symptomatic child may lead to short stature and low female fertility.},

   abstract = {The gastrointestinal tract constitutes one of the largest sites of exposure to the outside environment. The function of the gastrointestinal tract in monitoring and sealing the host interior from intruders is called the gut barrier. A variety of specific and nonspecific mechanisms are in operation to establish the host barrier; these include luminal mechanisms and digestive enzymes, the epithelial cells together with tight junctions in between them, and the gut immune system. Disruptions in the gut barrier follow injury from various causes including nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drugs and oxidant stress, and involve mechanisms such as adenosine triphosphate depletion and damage to epithelial cell cytoskeletons that regulate tight junctions. Ample evidence links gut barrier dysfunction to multiorgan system failure in sepsis and immune dysregulation. Additionally, contribution of gut barrier dysfunction to gastrointestinal disease is an evolving concept and is the focus of this review. An overview of the evidence for the role of gut barrier dysfunction in disorders such as Crohn's disease, celiac disease, food allergy, acute pancreatitis, non-alcoholic fatty liver disease, and alcoholic liver disease is provided, together with critical insight into the implications of this evidence as a primary disease mechanism.},

   abstract = {Celiac disease is associated with impaired cholecystokinin (CCK) release. The mechanism by which CCK release is impaired is poorly understood and seems to be related to the mucosal atrophy or to decreased stimulation due to reduced intraduodenal nutrient hydrolysis. The aims of our study were to evaluate basal and postprandial CCK in celiac patients presenting with distinctive types of mucosal lesions (normal, infiltrative and atrophic), and to study the role of protein hydrolysis on CCK release. Plasma CCK was measured in 20 celiac patients (normal mucosa: n=6; infiltrative type: n=6; atrophic type=8) and 9 controls, before and after ingestion of a polymeric or a semi-elemental meal. Significant decreases in basal CCK plasma (B 0.6 [95% CI, 0.3-1.3] pmol/l; p<0.003) and postprandial CCK area under curve (AUC 34 [19-61] pmol/l x 120 min, p<0.0001) were observed in patients with an atrophic mucosa compared with treated patients (B 1.6 [1.0-2.4] pmol/l, AUC 267 [172-414] pmol/l x 120 min) or healthy volunteers (B 1.0 [0.7-1.4] pmol/l, AUC 186 [131-264] pmol/l x 120 min). A significant defective CCK release was also observed in patients with an infiltrative type: B 0.4 [0.2-0.7] pmol/l and AUC 56 [31-101] pmol/l x 120 min; p<0.0001. Administration of a semi-elemental diet did not correct the defective CCK release. In conclusion, the decreased CCK levels observed in celiac patients are not strictly related to the mucosal atrophy but rather to the lymphocytic infiltrate. Administration of a predigested meal did not correct the impaired CCK release. Some inhibitory mechanism could be involved in the CCK cell dysfunction observed in celiac patients presenting with lesser degrees of disease activity.},

   abstract = {The pathogenesis of idiopathic chronic pancreatitis remains poorly understood despite the high expectations for ascribing the pancreatic damage in affected patients to genetic defects. Neither mutations in the cationic trypsinogen gene nor mutations of the cystic fibrosis conductance regulator gene account for the chronic pancreatitis noted in most patients with idiopathic chronic pancreatitis. Attempts to find an autoimmune basis for the pancreatitis in these patients have not been very successful. The diagnosis of small duct idiopathic chronic pancreatitis remains a great source of frustration for clinicians. Such patients with negative results of radiographic studies often cannot be diagnosed unless a hormone stimulation test such as a secretin test is performed. Although the porcine biologic form of secretin, which has been used to diagnose chronic pancreatitis, became unavailable because of widespread use in the treatment of children with autism, a synthetic form of porcine secretin has now been approved by the US Food and Drug Administration and is available. The true value of endoscopic ultrasonography in diagnosing small duct chronic pancreatitis remains to be fully defined. Endoscopic ultrasonography is becoming the test of choice in detecting radiographic abnormalities in both the parenchyma and ducts of the pancreas. Endoscopic ultrasonography-guided celiac plexus block can be performed relatively easily and very safely. It can provide excellent short-term pain relief in some patients, but reliable predictors of which patients will be successful with this therapy are not yet available. Because long-term follow-up data on the use of endoscopic ultrasonography in this respect are not available, and because the pain of chronic pancreatitis is, indeed, chronic, the role of endoscopic ultrasonography-guided celiac plexus block should be limited to treating those patients with chronic pancreatitis whose pain has not responded to other modalities.},

   abstract = {"Malabsorption" syndrome is the term widely used to describe the end result of either impaired breakdown of nutrients (maldigestion) or defective mucosal uptake and transport of adequately digested nutrients (true malabsorption). The latter may affect a broad range of nutrients (ie, panmalabsorption) or individual nutrients or groups of nutrients (ie, specific malabsorption). This review discusses the etiology and pathophysiology of malabsorption. A diagnostic approach to malabsorption is proposed. Other articles review specific disorders such as celiac disease, bacterial overgrowth, and chronic pancreatitis.},

   abstract = {Celiac disease (CD) is a syndrome characterized by damage of the small intestinal mucosa caused by the gliadin fraction of wheat gluten and similar alcohol-soluble proteins (prolamines) of barley and rye in genetically susceptible subjects. The presence of gluten in these subjects leads to self-perpetuating mucosal damage, whereas elimination of gluten results in full mucosal recovery. The clinical manifestations of CD are protean in nature and vary markedly with the age of the patient, the duration and extent of disease, and the presence of extraintestinal pathologic conditions. In addition to the classical gastrointestinal form, a variety of other clinical manifestations of the disease have been described, including atypical and asymptomatic forms. Therefore, diagnosis of CD is extremely challenging and relies on a sensitive and specific algorithm that allows the identification of different manifestations of the disease. Serologic tests developed in the last decade provide a noninvasive tool to screen both individuals at risk for the disease and the general population. However, the current gold standard for the diagnosis of CD remains histologic confirmation of the intestinal damage in serologically positive individuals. The keystone treatment of CD patients is a lifelong elimination diet in which food products containing gluten are avoided.},

   abstract = {BACKGROUND: The clinical presentation of celiac disease--a life-long gluten intolerance--may be characterized by chronic abdominal pain. The objective of this study was to determine if children with recurrent abdominal pain had a higher prevalence of antiendomysial antibodies (a serologic marker of celiac disease) compared with healthy children. METHODS: Children with recurrent abdominal pain and healthy control participants were recruited from the offices of community pediatricians. Serum samples were drawn and antiendomysial antibodies were measured in both groups. Demographic data included age, gender, height, and weight. RESULTS: A total of 200 children were recruited, of whom 173 (87%) had serum samples drawn. Of these, 92 were children with recurrent abdominal pain and 81 were control participants. Only 2 of the 173 samples (1.2%) were positive for antiendomysial antibody. The frequency of antiendomysial antibody positivity in children with recurrent abdominal pain was 1 in 92 (1%; 95% confidence interval, 0-6%) compared with 1 in 81 (1%; 95% confidence interval, 0-7%) in control participants. CONCLUSIONS: This community-based case-control study found no association between recurrent abdominal pain and the prevalence of antiendomysial antibody. Therefore, these data do not support screening for celiac disease in the child with classic recurrent abdominal pain in the primary care setting.},

   abstract = {BACKGROUND: The aim of this study was to evaluate the specificity of the immunoglobulin A (IgA) antiendomysial antibody test in the diagnosis of celiac disease in a group of malnourished children with acute diarrhea, chronic diarrhea, or parasitosis, because the reliability of this test has been questioned when applied to this specific group of patients. METHODS: Serum IgA level, IgA antiendomysial antibody (EMA) test, and stool examination were performed in 315 children, ranging in age 6 months to 13 years (range, 41 +/- 2.9 months), affected by malnutrition, isolated or in association with diarrhea or parasitosis. Independent of results, 33 children with a strong suspicion of celiac disease, also underwent IgA antitransglutaminase antibody test and jejunal biopsy. RESULTS: The EMA test was negative in 313 children, including the 43 with parasitosis, being positive in two patients in whom biopsy disclosed typical celiac mucosal abnormalities (1:157). The 31 children with negative EMA test who underwent biopsy also showed negative antitransglutaminase antibody results. Their biopsies disclosed normal mucosa in 1 patient, variable degree of jejunal atrophy (grade 1 and 2) in 27 patients, and grade 3 abnormalities in 3 patients. One of these three children, showing severe jejunal atrophy, died. The diagnosis of celiac disease was apparently not confirmed by a protracted gluten challenge in the other two children. CONCLUSIONS: The specificity of the EMA test seems to be high also in children with chronic malnutrition and diarrhea. However, the possibility of false-negative tests among immunologically compromised children cannot be excluded. In doubtful cases, the gluten challenge is required in malnourished children with clinical picture, biopsy finding, and evolution suggestive of celiac disease.},

Patients with celiac disease can present cerebellar ataxia, progressive myoclonic ataxia, myelopathy, or cerebral, brainstem and peripheral nerve involvement. Antigliadin antibodies can be found in subjects with neurological dysfunction of unknown cause, particularly in sporadic cerebellar ataxia ("gluten ataxia"). Patients with Whipple's disease can develop mental and psychiatric changes, supranuclear gaze palsy, upper motoneuron signs, hypothalamic dysfunction, cranial nerve abnormalities, seizures, ataxia, myorhythmia and sensory deficits. Neurological manifestations can complicate inflammatory bowel disease (e.g. ulcerative colitis and Crohn's disease) due to vascular or vasculitic mechanisms. Cases with both Crohn's disease and MS or cerebral vasculitis are described. Epilepsy, chronic inflammatory polyneuropathy, muscle involvement and myasthenia gravis are also reported. The central nervous system can be affected in patients with hepatitis C virus (HCV) infection because of vasculitis associated with HCV-related cryoglobulinemia. Mitochondrial neurogastrointestinal encephalopathy (MNGIE) is a disease caused by multiple deletions of mitochondrial DNA. It is characterized by peripheral neuropathy, ophthalmoplegia, deafness, leukoencephalopathy, and gastrointestinal symptoms due to visceral neuropathy. Neurological manifestations can be the consequence of vitamin B1, nicotinamide, vitamin B12, vitamin D, or vitamin E deficiency and from nutritional deficiency states following gastric surgery.},

The role of radiotherapy has evolved in the last three decades from the use of stepwise incremental doses in all patients to the current concept of added radiotherapy in advanced cases or in those with unfavorable pathology. To the authors' knowledge, this is the first case of a young woman with prior history of Wilms' tumor and significant weight loss due to radiation arteritis involving the abdominal vasculature. A 31-year-old woman presented with a history of weight loss and severe malnutrition. An angiogram revealed that the aorta was occluded below the renal artery. The celiac artery and the superior mesenteric artery were occluded at the origin, and large intercostal collaterals reconstituted the pelvic circulation. She was initially treated with total parenteral nutrition (TPN) and underwent an infrarenal aortic bypass surgery. Histopathology of the aorta revealed intimal fibrocalcific thickening and changes consistent with radiation-induced arteritis. Later, she was readmitted with progressive hepatic insufficiency. Despite intensive medical therapy, she died of multi-organ failure.},

   abstract = {Celiac disease is a common and permanent condition caused by an abnormal immune response to ingested gluten in genetically susceptible individuals. Its proper diagnosis is very important even in patients presenting with mild symptoms because severe and debilitating complications may occur in celiac patients not following a strict gluten-free diet. In the past several years, important progress has been made not only in our understanding of the pathogenesis of this condition but also in the availability of tools to screen it. Antigliadin antibodies, once largely used for this purpose, have been basically replaced by the more costly but far more accurate antiendomysium antibodies. More recently, the enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay (ELISA), which measures the antibodies directed against the autoantigen responsible for the disease (tissue transglutaminase), has also been developed and tested as a screening tool. Currently, however, the poor positive predictive value of this test does not allow practitioners to diagnose celiac disease without the duodenal biopsy showing the typical morphologic changes.},

   abstract = {BACKGROUND: Patients with coeliac disease are advised to keep to a lifelong gluten-free diet to remain well. Uncertainty still exists as to whether this gives a nutritionally balanced diet. AIM: To assess the vitamin nutrition status of a series of coeliac patients living on a gluten-free diet for 10 years. METHODS: Thirty adults with coeliac disease (mean age, 55 years; range, 45-64 years; 60% women), in biopsy-proven remission following 8-12 years of dietary treatment, were studied. We measured the total plasma homocysteine level, a metabolic marker of folate, vitamin B-6 and vitamin B-12 deficiency, and related plasma vitamin levels. The daily vitamin intake level was assessed using a 4-day food record. Normative data were obtained from the general population of the same age. RESULTS: Coeliac patients showed a higher total plasma homocysteine level than the general population, indicative of a poor vitamin status. In accordance, the plasma levels of folate and pyridoxal 5'-phosphate (active form of vitamin B-6) were low in 37% and 20%, respectively, and accounted for 33% of the variation of the total plasma homocysteine level (P < 0.008). The mean daily intakes of folate and vitamin B-12, but not of vitamin B-6, were significantly lower in coeliac patients than in controls. CONCLUSIONS: Half of the adult coeliac patients carefully treated with a gluten-free diet for several years showed signs of a poor vitamin status. This may have clinical implications considering the linkage between vitamin deficiency, elevated total plasma homocysteine levels and cardiovascular disease. The results may suggest that, when following up adults with coeliac disease, the vitamin status should be reviewed.},

   abstract = {The intestinal epithelium is a selective barrier where incompletely-digested food antigens are transmitted to the immune system. Food antigens are often the starting point of intestinal diseases such as food allergy or coeliac disease. The intestinal epithelial cells (IEC) take up and process food antigens mainly by fluid-phase transcytosis involving two functional pathways, one minor direct pathway without degradation and another major lysosomal degradative pathway. Among the peptidic metabolites generated during transepithelial transport of luminal antigens, some have a molecular mass compatible with a binding to restriction (major histocompatibility complex; MHC) molecules; the latter can be up regulated on enterocytes, especially in inflammatory conditions. Indeed, interferon-gamma not only increases the paracellular absorption of antigens, but also their transcytosis across epithelial cells. It has been reported that enterocytes may even directly present peptidic epitopes to underlying T-cells. As a new potential way of transmitting peptidic information to the local or systemic immune system, the secretion by IEC of antigen-presenting vesicles called exosomes and bearing MHC-peptide complexes has recently been proposed. Many other factors such as nutritional or environmental factors can also influence the properties of the epithelial barrier and the outcome of the immune response to lumen antigens.},

   abstract = {Genes whose products play a critical role in regulation of the immune response include the human leucocyte antigen (HLA) and cytokine families of genes. The HLA genes are the most polymorphic found in the human genome, and the bulk of this polymorphism results in functional differences in expressed HLA molecules, resulting in inter-individual differences in presentation of peptide antigens to T-cells. In addition, a considerable number of cytokine-associated gene polymorphisms have been identified, the bulk of which occur in the upstream promoter sequences of these genes, which in many cases results in differential in vitro expression of the respective pro- or anti-inflammatory gene product. Particular HLA polymorphisms result in well-defined associations with a large number of immunologically-mediated diseases, including some diseases with known dietary risk factors. For example, individuals of HLA-DQA1*0501, DQB1*0201 genotype have a greater than 200-fold increased risk of developing intolerance to dietary wheat gluten (coeliac disease), and additional HLA-related factors may influence the development of malignant lymphoma within pre-existing coeliac disease. Similarly, HLA-DRB1 alleles sharing a common sequence motif constitute the primary known genetic risk factor for rheumatoid arthritis. The influence of polymorphisms associated with differential cytokine expression on disease susceptibility is currently of much interest. Most attention has been focused on associations with susceptibility to benign immunologically-mediated diseases, including a number of gut diseases. However, recent work from our laboratory indicates that cytokine polymorphisms may influence susceptibility to and prognosis in a number of different cancers, including malignant melanoma skin cancer and solid tumours which may be influenced by diet, such as prostate cancer (collaboration with the CRC/BPG UK Familial Prostate Cancer study). In addition, preliminary work suggests that dietary modulation of expression levels of certain cytokines in healthy human subjects may be genotype dependent.},

   abstract = {BACKGROUND: Celiac disease, or permanent gluten-sensitive enteropathy, is an immunologic disease strictly dependent on exposure to wheat gluten or related proteins in rye and barley. OBJECTIVE: The aim of this study was to explore whether breast-feeding and the mode of introducing dietary gluten influence the risk of celiac disease in childhood. DESIGN: A population-based incident case-referent study of Swedish children, 627 cases with celiac disease and 1254 referents, was conducted; 78% of the matched sets were included in the final analyses. A questionnaire was used to assess patterns of food introduction to infants. Models were built, based on current epidemiologic and immunologic knowledge of celiac disease, to study the potential influence of dietary patterns on disease risk and were evaluated by conditional logistic regression in multivariate analyses. RESULTS: The risk of celiac disease was reduced in children aged <2 y if they were still being breast-fed when dietary gluten was introduced [adjusted odds ratio (OR): 0.59; 95% CI: 0.42, 0.83]. This effect was even more pronounced in infants who continued to be breast-fed after dietary gluten was introduced (OR: 0.36; 95% CI: 0.26, 0.51). The risk was greater when gluten was introduced in the diet in large amounts (OR: 1.5; 95% CI: 1.1, 2.1) than when introduced in small or medium amounts. In older children, these risk factors were of no or only minor importance. CONCLUSIONS: The gradual introduction of gluten-containing foods into the diet of infants while they are still being breast-fed reduces the risk of celiac disease in early childhood and probably also during the subsequent childhood period.},

   abstract = {Recently, the endomysial antigen has been identified as the protein cross-linking enzyme known as tissue transglutaminase (tTG). Our objective was to compare a novel enzyme immunoassay (EIA) that detects IgA antibody against tTG to two standard IFA methods utilizing thin tissue sections of rat kidney/rat stomach (KS) and distal primate esophagus (PE) as substrates to detect IgA antibody against endomysium (EMA). Sera from 100 patients suspected of having gluten-sensitive enteropathy (GSE) and 23 sera possessing various antibodies used for EIA cross-reactivity studies were included. Additional tests, performed routinely in our laboratory, were utilized to further assess sera from patients suspected having GSE. These tests include anti-gliadin IgA antibody (AGA) and anti-reticulin IgA antibody (ARA) and are part of the European Society for Pediatric Gastroenterology and Nutrition (ESPGAN) revised criteria for diagnosing GSE. When compared to IFA using KS, the tTG EIA had a sensitivity of 87.5%, was 97.1% specific, and had an overall agreement of 94.0%. When compared to IFA using PE, the tTG EIA had a sensitivity of 92.6%, was 93.2% specific, and had an overall agreement of 93.0%. When the KS IFA was compared to the PE IFA for EMA, the KS IFA had a sensitivity of 96.3%, was 91.8% specific, and had an overall agreement of 93.0%. The majority of sera that were positive for tTG but were negative by IFA (KS, n = 2/PE, n = 5) possessed IgA antibodies against gliadin and/or reticulin. Five of six sera with negative results by PE IFA were positive by the KS IFA and possessed one or more antibodies to tTG and/or gliadin and/or reticulin. We conclude that the tTG EIA compares well to both KS and PE IFAs when detecting IgA antibody against endomysium. We do not recommend the use of PE to detect EMA primarily because of the inconsistencies (i.e., tissue selection, quality, and preparation) and limited availability of commercially prepared PE tissue.},

WHO's revised classification in 1999, based on the etiopathogenesis of the disease, identifies only two categories: type 1 diabetes and type 2 diabetes. MMDM could be considered as type 1b diabetes. Genetic and immunological studies were done on MDDM patients (n = 72) from Cuttack and healthy controls to understand and to justify its inclusion in the category of type 1b diabetes. Antibodies (Abs) to tyrosine pyrophosphatase (IA2-Abs), glutamate decarboxylase 65 (GAD65-Abs), and other minor markers like ICA12 Abs and tissue transglutaminase Abs (TTG-Abs) were studied. HLA-DR and DQ were studied for the genetic markers. Of the MMDM patients 30% were positive for either GAD65 or IA-2 antibodies, and 14% were positive for ICA12 antibodies. All three antibody markers together accounted for 39% of PDDM patients, as some patients were positive for more than one autoantibody. TTG antibodies (specific for Celiac disease) were present in 14/71 (20%) of MMDM patients compared to 3/122 (2%) controls. All four autoantibodies accounted for 53% of PDDM patients, leaving 47% of patients free of known autoantibodies. The autoantibody-negative PDDM patients were analyzed for HLA and MICA markers, showing that DR7-DQ9 and MICA allele 9 are increased in this group compared to healthy controls, which suggests an autoimmune response to an unknown dietary autoantigen. We conclude from our data that an autoimmune mechanism is involved in the etiology of MMDM. In addition, the presence of silent celiac disease seen with MMDM patients, which has not yet been reported, is significant. It is important to note that subclinical celiac disease exists with diabetes mellitus and must be considered in the diagnosis of MMDM.},

The aim of the study was to estimate the prevalence of TTG-Ab in MMDM (n = 71), IDDM (n = 74), and NIDDM (n = 216) and 122 controls from Cuttack in eastern India. MMDM patients are typically young at onset with low body mass index, require insulin for glycemic control, have insulin resistance, and do not develop ketosis on withdrawal of insulin. TTG-Ab was evaluated by radioimmunoassay using in vitro translated recombinant human 35S-TTG. In controls, TTG-Ab was present in 3/122 (2%); in MMDM, TTG-Ab was present in 14/71 (20%); 11/74 (15%) IDDM (P < 0.05 vs. controls) and 23/216 (11%) NIDDM (P < 0.05 vs. controls) were also positive for TTG-Ab. We conclude that MMDM, IDDM, and NIDDM patients from Cuttack have a significantly high proportion of TTG-Ab compared to healthy controls. The highest significance is seen with MMDM patients.

Only 44% said they had received from dietitians a large quantity of information about celiac disease treatment, and only 57% had a high level of confidence in the information received from dietitians. Thirty-six percent reported difficulty in complying with the gluten-free diet. According to a probit analysis, larger region of residence (p<0.02) and concern about preparing meals (p<0.005) were directly related to difficulty in complying, while older age (p<0.05), satisfaction with gluten-free products (p<0.01), and a high level of confidence in treatment information from gastroenterologists and dietitians (p<0.005) were inversely associated with compliance difficulty. Awareness of these results should encourage dietitians to improve their skills in treating celiac disease.},

   abstract = {BACKGROUND: Previously, a gluten challenge was customary to establish the diagnosis of celiac disease in children. There are no clear recommendations on how to perform this challenge or what markers to rely on for timing the biopsy after the challenge. The authors' aim was to monitor gluten intake, clinical symptoms, and antibody kinetics to evaluate the influence of gluten exposure during the challenge. METHODS: Twenty-five children under investigation for suspected celiac disease were challenged. One child was excluded because blood samples, food records, or biopsy was lacking. Median age at the postchallenge biopsy was 3.8 (2.7-8.8) years. The families kept daily records of the children's gluten intake and of symptoms that occurred. Blood samples were taken monthly for analysis of antigliadin and endomysium antibodies and total immunoglobulin A (IgA). A third biopsy was performed when clinical symptoms suggested a relapse. RESULTS: All 24 children showed deterioration of the mucosa or elevated antibodies during gluten challenge. Median duration of the challenge was 13 (5-51) weeks, and mean gluten intake was 1.7 (0.2-4.3) g/d and 0.1 (0.02-0.26) g/kg daily. CONCLUSIONS: Gluten intake during the challenge varied widely, and the parents were unable to give their children the recommended amount. Despite the small amounts given, all children showed signs of relapse at a clinical, laboratory, or histologic level. Much smaller amounts of gluten than previously suggested seem sufficient to cause relapse during gluten challenge in children.},

Peripheral T lymphocytes with the phenotype of helper cells or cluster of differentiation 4 (CD4) were decreased. Circulating activated T cells (CD3/HLA-DR-positive cells) and large granular lymphocytes (CD16/CD56 positive cells) were increased. Plasma levels of interleukin-6 were higher in DS children than in controls. Serum levels of thyroid-stimulating hormone were increased in DS. Coeliac disease was over-represented in the group of DS children and many of these children also showed increased serum levels of immunoglobulin-G (IgG) specific for gliadin antigen. The increment of serum interleukin-6 was age-related and correlated with anti-gliadin IgG levels in DS. Plasma zinc levels were lower in DS children with coeliac disease and in those with anti-gliadin IgG than in DS without detectable anti-gliadin IgG. Dietary antigens may represent a continuous stimulus for the immune system in this syndrome and interfere with normal immune responses. Altered intestinal absorption of nutrients may in turn affect endocrine functions, brain development, and cognitive performances.},

   abstract = {The prevalence of coeliac disease (CD) in the adult population is unknown because silent and latent stages do exist. Type 1 diabetes mellitus may be associated with CD because of common genetic background and/or shared pathogenetic mechanisms. We investigated 74 adults with type 1 diabetes (32+/-11 yr, disease duration 13+/-9 yr), 69 parents of diabetic probands (56+/-10 yr), 59 siblings (30+/-11 yr) and 50 healthy controls (35+/-10 yr) for the presence of circulating islet cell antibodies (ICA), anti-glutamic acid decarboxylase antibodies (GADA65), anti-gliadin immunoglobulins A and G (IgA- and IgG-AGA). All patients with raised AGA, performed also IgA anti-endomysium antibody (EmA) indirect immunofluorescence assay. Samples were positive for ICA in 19 diabetics (26%), 4 parents (6%), 4 siblings (7%), 0 controls (p<0.001); for GADA in 34 diabetics (46%), 4 parents (6%), 1 sibling (2%), 0 controls (p<0.001). Twenty-five diabetic patients (34%), 10 parents (14%), 5 siblings (8%), 3 controls (6%) (p<0.001) had raised IgA-AGA (>4.4 mg/l). Four diabetic patients (5%), 5 parents (7%), 0 siblings (0%), 4 controls (8%) had raised IgG-AGA (>18 mg/l). Both IgA- and IgG-AGA were detected in 1 diabetic and 2 parents. The prevalence of ICA, GADA, and IgA-AGA positivity in Type 1 diabetes patients was significantly higher than in controls (p<0.001). Finally, 50 AGA-positive subjects performed EmA test: only 2 of them resulted EmA-positive, a diabetic patient and a sibling. The patient with Type 1 diabetes had a small-bowel biopsy specimen consistent with CD and, as sole evidence of malabsorption, sideropenic anaemia. EmA-positive sibling also showed severe iron deficiency, yet refused endoscopy. We conclude that: 1) CD cannot be diagnosed on the basis of associated IgA- and IgG-AGA alone. Nevertheless, detection of such antibodies is useful, in combination with EmA, in screening for endoscopic biopsy; 2) too high rate of detection of IgA-AGA in Type 1 diabetic patients in comparison with other groups excludes a false positivity of the test itself, while suggests a pathogenetic association of both immunological disorders, perhaps related to abnormal gammadelta TCR-bearing intraepithelial lymphocytes.},

   abstract = {OBJECTIVE: Refractory sprue is a rare and severe malabsorptive disorder that mimics celiac disease but is refractory to a gluten-free diet and is without initial evidence of overt lymphoma. Treatment is largely empiric and often ineffective, with steroids and immunosuppression being the mainstream therapeutic options. The aim of this study was to evaluate prospectively the effect of azathioprine on a group of patients diagnosed with refractory sprue. METHODS: We studied seven consecutive patients (five women and two men) with a well-defined diagnosis of refractory sprue and a lack of response to oral or parenteral steroids. At diagnosis, five patients had endoscopic evidence of ulcerative jejunitis, and five underwent exploratory laparotomy for exclusion of malignancies. The characteristic monoclonal TCRgamma gene rearrangement was shown in five of six patients studied. Patients were treated for a mean of 11 months (range 8-12 months), and clinical, biochemical, molecular, and histological parameters were reassessed at the end of the trial. The study was a prospective, open-label, non-placebo-controlled study using azathioprine (2 mg/kg/ day) plus oral prednisone (1 mg/kg/day). A gluten-free diet (n = 7) as well as enteral (n = 6) and parenteral nutrition (n = 5) were administered during the trial. RESULTS: After treatment, five patients had a complete clinical remission, and biochemical and nutritional parameters were significantly improved. Steroids were tapered after the onset of azathioprine, and no patient was on steroids at the end of the trial. Intestinal histology improved significantly in all cases (normal histology in three cases and minor infiltration in the lamina propria in two). Two patients did not respond to treatment at any time and died in months 10 and 9, of an irreversible ventricular fibrillation and sepsis, respectively. No overt lymphoma was demonstrated during the follow-up. CONCLUSIONS: The present study confirms earlier anecdotal reports on the efficacy of azathioprine in refractory sprue, with clear clinical and histological improvement shown in most patients. However, monoclonality persisted after treatment. We consider that a larger number of patients should be evaluated before a definitive recommendation is adopted for use of this drug in refractory sprue.},

   abstract = {Oxidants have been shown to be involved in alcohol-induced liver injury. This study was designed to determine whether cocoa flavonoid extract, composed mostly of epicatechin and epicatechin oligomers, protects against early alcohol-induced liver injury in rats. Male Wistar rats were fed high-fat liquid diets with or without ethanol (10-14 g/kg per day) and cocoa extract (400 mg/kg per day) continuously for 4 weeks using an enteral feeding protocol. Mean body weight gains ( approximately 4 g/day) were not significantly different between treatment groups. Cocoa extract did not affect average daily urine ethanol concentrations ( approximately 200mg/dL). After 4 weeks, serum alanine amino transferase levels of the ethanol group were increased nearly fourfold (110+/-16 IU/L) compared to control values (35+/-3 IU/L); this effect of ethanol was blocked by cocoa extract (60+/-6 IU/L). Additionally, enteral ethanol caused severe fat accumulation, mild inflammation, and necrosis in the liver; cocoa extract significantly blunted these changes. Increases in liver TNFalpha protein levels caused by ethanol were completely blocked by cocoa extract. Further, ethanol significantly increased the accumulation of protein adducts of 4-hydroxynonenal, a product of lipid peroxidation serving as an index of oxidative stress; again this was counteracted by the addition of cocoa extract. These results indicate that dietary flavanols such as those found in cocoa can prevent early alcohol-induced liver injury.},

METHODS: Concentrations of transthyretin, retinol binding protein, soluble transferrin receptor, IgA anti-gliadin, and IgA anti-transglutaminase, and titres of IgA anti-endomysial antibody were measured in 36 newly diagnosed adult patients with coeliac disease and duodenal villous atrophy before (T0) and after one year (T1) on a gluten free diet. Duodenal biopsies taken at T0 and T1 were compared and graded as no improvement (no change in initial grade of villous atrophy) or improvement. RESULTS: Twenty two patients showed histological improvement and 14 showed no improvement. Transthyretin values increased in all patients with mucosal improvement and decreased in all patients showing no improvement. However, transthyretin values did not correlate with the degree of villous atrophy at T0 and T1 when assessed separately. Changes in retinol binding protein and soluble transferrin receptor values did not correlate with mucosal improvement. Coeliac disease associated antibodies (to gliadin, endomysium, and transglutaminase) decreased in most patients between T0 and T1, irrespective of mucosal recovery. CONCLUSIONS: Serial but not single measurements of transthyretin may be used as a non-invasive test to monitor mucosal recovery and therefore reduce the need for, or frequency of, follow up biopsies in treated patients with coeliac disease.},

   abstract = {Coeliac disease is an important cause of chronic diarrhoea, failure to thrive, and anaemia in children. Little information on the disease is available in India. This study was undertaken to determine the prevalence, clinical, anthropometric and histological profiles of coeliac disease in patients attending a tertiary referral centre in India. Coeliac disease was diagnosed in 42 (16.6%) of 246 children with chronic diarrhoea, failure to thrive, and anaemia. The mean ages at onset of symptoms and at diagnosis were 2.4 (range 0.5-10) years and 8.3 (range 3-14) years respectively, and a mean period of delay in diagnosis was 5.9 (range 1-13.5) years. Of the 42 cases, history of failure to thrive was observed in 38 (90%), chronic diarrhoea in 37 (88%), and anaemia in 6 cases. Short stature, under-nutrition, anaemia, oedema of feet, rickets, clubbing of fingers, features of vitamin A deficiency, and B-vitamin deficiency were found in 42, 26, 38, 9, 8, 6, 3, and 2 cases respectively. Onset of symptoms, such as, chronic diarrhoea and failure to thrive, was earlier in children with subtotal villous atrophy than in those with partial villous atrophy (mean +/- SD; 2.00 +/- 1.46 years vs 3.30 +/- 2.72 years; p < 0.05). Results of the study suggest that coeliac disease is not uncommon in Indian children. Coeliac disease should be considered in the differential diagnosis, particularly in children without any symptoms of diarrhoea.},

   abstract = {BACKGROUND: Symptomatic hypoglycemia is an unavoidable problem in the treatment of type I diabetes. Celiac disease is associated with malabsorption and may therefore represent an important risk factor. METHODS: The frequency of symptomatic hypoglycemia in patients with type I diabetes and celiac disease (cases) was compared with those of patients who had diabetes without celiac disease (controls). For this purpose, each case was matched for age, sex, and duration of disease with one to two control patients. Indices of metabolic control (hemoglobin [Hb]A1c, frequency of hypoglycemia, and total insulin requirement) were retrieved for the 18 months before and after diagnosis of celiac disease. RESULTS: Eighteen patients (6 males and 12 females) had diagnosed celiac disease and were matched with 26 control patients (10 males and 16 females). There was no difference in age (11.0 years; range, 1.8-21.9 vs. 13.1 years; range, 2.3-22; P = 0.3) and duration of disease (8.4 years; range, 1.2-19.3 vs. 8.3 years; range, 1.1-18.7; P = 0.3) between the two groups. During the 6 months before and after diagnosis of celiac disease the cases had significantly more hypoglycemic episodes than the controls (means +/- SD; 4.5+/-4 vs. 2.0+/-2.2 episodes/months, P = 0.01). This was reflected by a progressive reduction in insulin requirement over the 12 months before diagnosis reaching a nadir at time 0 (0.6+/-0.2 vs. 0.9+/-0.3, P = 0.05). CONCLUSION: These data suggest that underlying celiac disease is associated with an increased risk of symptomatic hypoglycemia and that the introduction of a gluten-free diet with normalization of the intestinal mucosa may reduce its frequency.},

   abstract = {BACKGROUND: Pancreatic insufficiency may appear secondary to several intestinal disorders. It may contribute to malabsorption in tropical sprue (TS). METHODS: The exocrine pancreatic function was evaluated with the indirect pancreolauryl test (PT) in 56 patients with TS. The PT results were analyzed and correlated with serum albumin levels, degree of intestinal atrophy, and steatorrhea. RESULTS: Abnormally low values were found in 36 (64.2%) cases. A significant relationship was not observed between PT and hypoalbuminemia. Patients with more severe damage by intestinal biopsy tended to have lower PT values. No relationship was found between pancreatic insufficiency and steatorrhea (expressed as g/24 h), but patients with pancreatic insufficiency had increased stool fat concentrations (expressed as percentage of wet stool weight). All patients responded favorably to treatment with folic acid and tetracycline. Fifteen patients with abnormal initial PT values underwent a repeat PT after a 6-week therapy; all of them showed normalization of PT values. CONCLUSIONS: The abnormal exocrine pancreatic function found with an indirect test in patients with TS is probably secondary to a low pancreatic hormonal stimulation due to intestinal damage, as occurs in celiac sprue. These abnormalities are reversible after specific treatment for TS.},

   abstract = {UNLABELLED: Confirmation of the diagnosis of coeliac disease requires unequivocal evidence of recovery on a gluten-free diet. The lactose H2 breath test is a non-invasive technique for detecting lactose malabsorption, and this may occur in untreated coeliac disease. The utility of this test was investigated in objectively confirming a response to gluten exclusion. The study included 44 children from 0.9 to 14.75 y of age (median 3.2) with coeliac disease. Five children were asymptomatic, being identified through coeliac antibody screening. Breath tests were performed prior to dietary treatment. If positive, they were repeated at 4-wk intervals following gluten exclusion. Overall, 21/44 (48%) children had positive breath tests at presentation. In 18/21 children on a gluten-free diet, this became negative after 4 wk (86%) and in all the children by 8 wk. In two children with positive tests at 4 wk, problems with dietary adherence were identified. A positive test before treatment was not associated with significant differences in individual symptoms, height, weight and body mass index standard deviation scores, serum haemoglobin or albumin. However, no positive results were found in the asymptomatic patients (p = 0.05). Lactose malabsorption was associated with earlier age of presentation (p = 0.008). CONCLUSION: The lactose H2 breath test objectively confirms a response to gluten exclusion. In selected cases it can help confirm a diagnosis of coeliac disease. However, the test tends to be less informative in asymptomatic patients, and in older children.},

   abstract = {BACKGROUND AND AIMS: To determine bone mass using quantitative phalangeal bone ultrasound in young coeliac patients after a long-term gluten-free diet. SUBJECTS: A total of 99 patients with coeliac disease (CD) (52 girls, mean age 15.5 +/- 9.7 years; 47 boys, mean age 14.4 +/- 8.4 years) and 44 healthy subjects matched for age, weight and height (26 girls, mean age 18.4 +/- 9.9 years; 18 boys, mean age 16.3 +/- 11.2 years) were included in the study. METHODS: Bone status was assessed using an ultrasound device that measures amplitude-dependent speed of sound (Ad-SoS) in metres per second. Measurements were made on the phalanges (II-V) of the non-dominant hand, and an average value was computed. Nutrient intake was assessed using a 7-day record. RESULTS: Analysis of variance (ANOVA) and the unpaired t-test showed that the intake of phosphates (P < 0.05), proteins, fat and carbohydrates (P < 0.005 in all) was higher in patients than in controls. No significant difference in Ad-SoS was found between patients and controls (95% CI -10.9 to 60.6) in the overall group, in girls or boys, or in patients following a gluten-free diet strictly or partially. In the patients, only age (beta 4.01, 95% CI 1.84-6.16, P < 0.0005) and weight (beta 2.62, 95% CI 1.53-3.70, P < 0.0001) showed a significant positive relation with Ad-SoS. CONCLUSIONS: In patients with CD, gluten-free diet and increased nutritional intake were accompanied by normal bone mass values as determined by ultrasound on phalanges.},

   abstract = {AIMS: The aim of this study was to investigate the association between the duration of breast-feeding and the age at the first gluten introduction into the infant diet and the incidence and age at onset of celiac disease. METHODS: In a case-control study, 143 children with celiac disease and 137 randomly recruited gender- and age-matched control children were administered a standardized questionnaire. Multivariate-adjusted odds ratios (OR) as estimates of the relative risk and corresponding 95% confidence intervals (95% CI) were calculated. RESULTS: The risk of developing celiac disease decreased significantly by 63% for children breast-fed for more than 2 months (OR 0.37, 95% CI 0.21-0.64) as compared with children breast-fed for 2 months or less. The age at first gluten introduction had no significant influence on the incidence of celiac disease (OR 0.72, 95% CI 0.29-1.79 comparing first gluten introduction into infant diet >3 months vs. < or =3 months). CONCLUSIONS: A significant protective effect on the incidence of celiac disease was suggested by the duration of breast-feeding (partial breast-feeding as well as exclusive breast-feeding). The data did not support an influence of the age at first dietary gluten exposure on the incidence of celiac disease. However, the age at first gluten exposure appeared to affect the age at onset of symptoms.},

Patients present with abdominal pain, weight loss, pancreatic calcifications, and glucose intolerance or diabetes mellitus. Etiologies include a protein-calorie malnourished state, a variety of exogenous food toxins, pancreatic duct anomalies, and a possible genetic predisposition. Chronic cyanide exposure from the diet may contribute to this disease, seen often in India, Asia, and Africa. The pancreatic duct of these patients often is markedly dilated, and may contain stones, with or without strictures. The risk of ductal carcinoma with this disease is accentuated. Treatment may be frustrating, and may include pancreatic enzymes, duct manipulations at endoscopic retrograde cholangiopancreatography, octreotide, celiac axis blocks for pain control, or surgery via drainage and/or resection.},

   abstract = {BACKGROUND: It was recently shown that antiendomysial antibodies (EMAs), which are highly sensitive and specific for celiac disease, are produced by intestinal mucosa. Furthermore, EMAs were detected previously in supernatant fluid from cultured duodenal mucosa specimens collected from untreated celiac disease patients and in culture media of biopsy specimens collected from treated celiac disease patients after an in vitro challenge with gliadin. Moreover, it was recently shown in vivo that oats are not toxic to celiac disease patients, suggesting the safety of oats in a gluten free-diet. OBJECTIVE: The objective was to better define the controversial role of oats in celiac disease to determine whether oats can be safely included in a gluten-free diet. DESIGN: We used an in vitro model to test whether oats induce EMA production in supernatant fluid from cultured duodenal mucosa specimens collected from 13 treated celiac disease patients. The biopsy specimens were cultured with and without peptic-tryptic digest (PT) of gliadin and avenin (from oats) and in medium alone. Samples from 5 of the 13 patients were cultured with the C fraction of PT-avenin. Indirect immunofluorescence was used to detect EMAs. RESULTS: EMAs were detected in specimens from all 13 patients after the challenge with gliadin but not after culture in medium alone. By contrast, no EMAs were detected in any of the specimens cultured with PT-avenin and its C fraction. CONCLUSIONS: Because the in vitro challenge with PT-avenin and its C fraction did not induce EMA production in treated celiac disease patients, it appears that oats have no harmful effect on celiac disease. Therefore, oats can be safely included in a gluten-free diet.},

   abstract = {BACKGROUND: In a developing country, many conditions other then celiac disease (CD) can give rise to villous atrophy. We therefore assessed the role of immunoglobulin A (IgA)-antigliadin antibody (AGA) in addition to the ESPGHAN criteria in the diagnosis of CD in 104 Indian children. METHODS: Consecutive children with suspected CD were evaluated over 3 years with an intention to diagnose CD. Complete hemogram, d-xylose absorption test, endoscopic duodenal biopsy, and IgA-AGA titers were performed in all. CD was diagnosed on the basis of modified ESPGHAN criteria irrespective of IgA-AGA positivity (>5 U/mL), and those diagnosed were put on gluten-free diet and were monitored regularly. Children with suspected CD who had a normal duodenal biopsy result were taken as controls. RESULTS: The mean age of 50 children with CD was 6.3 +/- 2.6 years, with a male to female ratio of 3:2. The mean duration of symptoms was 3.4 +/- 2.2 years. Predominant symptoms were pallor in 96%, failure to thrive in 92%, and diarrhea in 80%. On follow-up (19.6 +/- 8 months), symptoms subsided within 16 +/- 9.8 days, and patients showed significant weight gain (mean weight at diagnoses and at last follow-up visit were 66% and 86% of expected, respectively; P < 0.001) and height gain (mean height at diagnoses and at last follow-up visit were 88% and 94% of expected, respectively; P = nonsignificant). The control group comprised 47 children with a mean age of 6.9 +/- 3 years. On comparing CD with controls, diarrhea, anemia, low weight, and stunting were significantly (P < 0.001) more frequent in patients with CD. Sensitivity and specificity of AGA at a cutoff value of 5 U/mL were 94% and 91.5% and at 10 U/mL 88% and 100%, respectively. Follow-up AGA test was performed in 42 of 47 positive cases. All showed significant decrease in AGA titer, and 29 (70%) had a negative test result. CONCLUSIONS: Indian children with CD are true cases of CD. They present late, diarrhea is absent in 20% of cases, and AGA test results show 88% of children without false-positive results at a cutoff value of 10 U/mL. However, AGA test with 94% sensitivity at a cutoff value of 5 U/mL can be used as screening test to select suspected cases for further workup.},

METHODS: A total of 65 Saharawi children with coeliac disease were compared with 71 age-matched non-coeliac controls. For each participant, the clinical history was taken and a clinical examination, non-quantitative 24-hour dietary recall, anthropometric and skinfold measurements, bioelectric impedance analysis (BIA) of body composition, and venous blood sampling for haemoglobin determination were performed. RESULTS: Gluten-containing food, especially bread, was the staple diet of Saharawi children. Abdominal pain and distension were significantly commoner among children with coeliac disease than in controls (P < 0.05). The mean height-for-age was significantly lower in such children than in controls (-2.5 +/- 1.4 units vs -1.8 +/- 1.3 units, respectively, P < 0.01). No significant differences were found for either skinfold or BIA measurements. Haemoglobin values tended to be lower in children with coeliac disease than in controls. CONCLUSIONS: Coeliac disease has a negative effect on the health status of Saharawi refugee children. Because of the high prevalence of the condition in the Saharawi, a specific programme for treating all affected individuals should be established. Further studies are required to quantify the impact of coeliac disease in other areas of the developing world.},

   abstract = {BACKGROUND: Follow-up of celiac patients in Chile is often interrupted when adolescents are referred to adult gastroenterologists. AIM: To study the evolution of patients with celiac disease when they reach adolescence or young adulthood. PATIENTS AND METHODS: Current adherence to gluten-free diet and its relation to symptoms and circulating antiendomysial antibodies were evaluated in the 58 confirmed celiac patients older than 12 years of age controlled at 3 hospitals in Santiago. RESULTS: Mean age at the moment of this assessment was 17.8 +/- 5 years, 65.5% were women, 12.5% were at nutritional risk (-IDS) while 20% were overweight/obese. Although all patients declared themselves asymptomatic, a focused questionnaire revealed that 26% suffered some symptoms. Only 24.1% followed a strict gluten-free diet. Eight of 20 patients who ate gluten-containing diets had negative antiendomysial antibodies (EMA), three of whom turned positive within 6 to 9 months. In three of four (asymptomatic) cases that accepted a new jejunal biopsy, histology was abnormal. One patient who followed a strict diet had EMA (+) and normal histology. CONCLUSIONS: These results confirm that after childhood, symptoms abate significantly in celiac patients. The observed sensitivity and specificity of EMA makes necessary to maintain small intestinal biopsies as the gold standard for diagnosis and confirmation of the disease.},

We investigated the serum levels of soluble interleukin-2 receptor, interleukin-6, and tumor necrosis factor-alpha in celiac children before and after gluten exclusion. METHODS: Cytokine levels were determined using enzyme immunoassay in serum from 12 untreated celiac patients, 16 treated celiac patients on a gluten-free diet for at least two years, and from 26 control children. Eight of 12 untreated patients were also investigated at 6 and 12 months after gluten exclusion. Serum IgA antiendomysium antibodies were also assayed by indirect immunofluorescence. RESULTS: Soluble interleukin-2 receptor and interleukin-6 levels were significantly increased in untreated celiac patients compared with treated and control children. There was no difference in the tumor necrosis factor-alpha levels between the groups. Soluble interleukin-2 receptor levels were the only ones significantly decreased at 12 months after gluten exclusion. However, soluble interleukin-2 receptor and interleukin-6 levels at 12 months were significantly higher compared with controls. Antiendomysium antibodies had a diagnostic sensitivity of 100% and the titers decreased significantly after 12 months of gluten exclusion. A significant positive correlation was found between antiendomysium antibody titers with both soluble interleukin-2 receptor and interleukin-6 values. CONCLUSIONS: The serum soluble interleukin-2 receptor and interleukin-6 levels may be used as a noninvasive measure of celiac disease activity and response to treatment.},

The wide spectrum of clinical symptoms is partly due to the malnourished state caused by the malabsorption of macro- and micronutrients. Fertility problems, sexual dysfunction and obstetrical complications are more frequently observed in patients with coeliac disease. These reproductive disorders may be a consequence of the endocrine derangements caused by selective nutrient deficiencies. Nowadays, the early diagnosis and treatment of coeliac disease is possible and not very costly. Therefore, coeliac disease must be seriously considered in the preconceptional screening and treatment of patients with reproductive disorders.},

   abstract = {OBJECTIVE: To characterize the energy and nutrient intake, and the degree of fat malabsorption in children with Alagille syndrome (AGS) and to examine their cross-sectional associations with growth and nutritional status. METHODS: Prepubertal children with AGS were evaluated for dietary intake, growth, bone age, and body composition. Children and their families collected a three-day, weighed diet record at home. Stools were collected for 72 hours and the coefficient of fat absorption (COA) was determined. RESULTS: Children (mean age 6.7 +/- 3.6 years) with AGS (n = 26) had low height-for-age z-scores (HAZ), weight-for-age z-scores (WAZ) (-1.9 +/- 1.3 and -1.7 +/- 1.1, respectively), and delayed skeletal maturation (-1.4 +/- 1.8 years). Fifty-eight percent of the subjects were less than the 5th percentile for height and 54% were less than the 5th percentile for weight. At least 20% of children with AGS had low dietary intake for several nutrients including: calories, fat, calcium, vitamin D, and vitamin E. Children who consumed <2/3 Dietary Reference Intake (DRI) for calcium (n = 6) had a statistically significantly lower HAZ (-3.2 +/- 1.3) than those who consumed >2/3 DRI (-1.5 +/- 1.0), (P < 0.003). Ninety-six percent of the subjects had steatorrhea with a mean COA of 75 +/- 16%. CONCLUSIONS: These data suggest that prepubertal children with AGS are at-risk for poor nutrient intake which, compounded with steatorrhea, may have a negative effect on growth and nutritional status. Intervention studies to increase energy and nutrient intake are needed to determine the effect of improved dietary intake on growth and nutritional status of children with AGS.},

   abstract = {OBJECTIVES: Many afflictions have been associated with celiac disease, but chance associations may exists. The aim of this study was to establish, by means of a multicenter prospective study, the prevalence of thyroid impairment among adult patients with newly diagnosed celiac disease and to evaluate the effect of a 1-yr gluten withdrawal on thyroid function. METHODS: A total of 241 consecutive untreated patients and 212 controls were enrolled. In 128 subjects a thorough assessment, including intestinal biopsy, was repeated within 1 yr of dietary treatment. Thyroid function was assayed by measuring the levels of TSH, free T3, free T4, thyroperoxidase, and thyroid microsome antibodies. RESULTS: Thyroid disease was 3-fold higher in patients than in controls (p < 0.0005). Hypothyroidism, diagnosed in 31 patients (12.9%) and nine controls (4.2%), was subclinical in 29 patients and of nonautoimmune origin in 21. There was no difference regarding hyperthyroidism, whereas autoimmune thyroid disease with euthyroidism was present in 39 patients (16.2%) and eight controls (3.8%). In most patients who strictly followed a 1-yr gluten withdrawal (as confirmed by intestinal mucosa recovery), there was a normalization of subclinical hypothyroidism. Twenty-five percent of patients with euthyroid autoimmune disease shifted toward either a subclinical hyperthyroidism or subclinical hypothyroidism; in these subjects, dietary compliance was poor. In addition, 5.5% of patients whose thyroid function was normal while untreated developed some degree of thyroid dysfunction 1 yr later. CONCLUSIONS: The greater frequency of thyroid disease among celiac disease patients justifies a thyroid functional assessment. In distinct cases, gluten withdrawal may single-handedly reverse the abnormality.},

He underwent a radical resection with intraoperative radiation to the regional field. Two months postoperatively, massive upper gastrointestinal bleeding occurred. Operative management included a left thoracotomy, aortic cross-clamping, laparotomy, and suture repair of a fistula from the root of the celiac trunk to the gastric remnant, with a completion gastrectomy. The patient survived and underwent a delayed reconstruction and closure. Subsequently, several repeat bleeding episodes took place, from sources including the celiac, common hepatic, and proper hepatic arteries. Multiple angiographic coil embolization and surgical procedures became necessary, ultimately requiring an esophagostomy and cecostomy for intestinal diversion. A rectus abdominis flap coverage of the exposed large arteries was performed. Although two more bleeding episodes took place, the patient was ultimately managed successfully. He is currently free of disease 3 years after reexploration, able to take oral nutrition, with intermittent jejunostomy feeding supplements. The discussion highlights aspects relevant to this case: the importance of a complete regional resection during a gastric cancer resection, the management strategy for an acute catastrophic intra-abdominal bleeding, and possible mechanisms that could contribute to such bleeding, including intraoperative radiation and postoperative infection.},

   abstract = {BACKGROUND: In adults, the relation between celiac disease (CD) and cancer has been long recognized. In children, only four cases of CD and cancer have been described in Europe. We made a new inventory of cases with CD and cancer in children that were known by the members of the European Society for Paediatric Gastroenterology, Hepatology and Nutrition between 1989 and 1999. METHODS: Postal inquiry was made of all European Society for Paediatric Gastroenterology, Hepatology and Nutrition members mentioned on the society's web page. The members were asked if they had seen a child with CD and cancer between 1989 and 1999 and if so, to supply additional clinical data. Also, information on working place, experience, and number of celiac patients under their care was requested. RESULTS: Fifty-six percent of the members responded. Sixteen members reported 22 cases of cancer and CD in children. One case had been reported in the literature previously. The tumors that were reported originated from the brain, thyroid, larynx, liver, small bowel, adrenal, lymphoreticular system, and the musculoskeletal system. There were no differences between members reporting a case and those who did not. CONCLUSIONS: Twenty-one new cases of cancer and CD in children in Europe were found. Cancer and CD in children are underreported. A remarkable number of thyroid and small bowel cancers were found, suggesting a possible relation with CD. It is important to evaluate whether these findings are coincidental. All cases of cancer and CD in children should be reported to the literature.},

METHODS: One hundred ninety samples were analyzed: 108 homemade foods prepared in homes of patients with celiac disease, 81 processed products, and 1 positive control of homemade food. All samples were analyzed by EIA based on monoclonal antibodies to heat stable omega-gliadins and related prolamins from wheat, rye, and barley. Samples were also analyzed using the WB technique. RESULTS: Only one (0.9%) of 108 homemade foods contained detectable amounts of gliadin, as determined by EIA. Twelve of 81 processed products contained gliadin by EIA, as follows: 5 of 61 without gluten listed in the ingredients, 2 of 11 malt extracts, 1 of 2 wheat starches, 1 of 2 types of beer, and all 3 positive control products. Gliadin content of these products was between 4 and 10 mg of gliadin/100 g of product, except for the wheat starch sample (28 mg of gliadin/100 g) and all 3 samples with gluten (>4000 mg of gliadin/100 g). The positive control of homemade food contained 152 mg of gliadin/100 g. One hundred three of 190 samples were analyzed by WB, and 21 of these were gliadin positive. A comparison of results obtained by EIA and WB showed no statistical differences between the methods. CONCLUSIONS: The greater part of the foods prepared in homes of patients with celiac disease and most processed products supposed to be gluten-free did not contain gliadin. Therefore, celiac patients adequately prepare gluten-free homemade food and have the expertise to purchase processed gluten-free food in Sao Paulo, Brazil.},

DESIGN: Cross-sectional study. SETTING: Tertiary care HIV subspecialty practice. PARTICIPANTS: Children with perinatally acquired HIV infection. Exclusion criteria included being younger than 1 year and receiving mineral oil as a medication. METHODS: Weight, height, and upper arm anthropometric variables were measured. Spot stool samples were analyzed for steatorrhea using the Sudan III qualitative test and for EPI using fecal elastase-1 enzyme assay. Hormone-stimulated pancreatic function testing and 72-hour stool and dietary fat sample collection were performed when fecal elastase-1 enzyme was in the range of EPI, defined as less than 200 microgram/g. HIV RNA viral load, CD4 status, type of antiretroviral therapy, and biochemical evidence of hepatobiliary disease were measured within 3 months of stool sample collection. z Scores were computed for height, weight, triceps skinfold, and upper arm muscle area. RESULTS: We enrolled 44 patients (23 girls [52%]) with a mean +/- SD age of 7.4 +/- 3.1 years. None had hepatobiliary disease. The prevalence of steatorrhea was 39% (95% confidence interval, 23%-56%). The prevalence of EPI was 0% (95% confidence interval, 0%-9%). There were no associations between steatorrhea and EPI, growth, HIV RNA viral load, CD4 status, or type of antiretroviral therapy. Older children had decreased z scores for height (r = -0.42; P =.006). CONCLUSIONS: The clinical significance of steatorrhea in children with HIV infection is unclear. Furthermore, its evaluation should focus on nonpancreas-based conditions. Continual close monitoring of growth is essential in children with HIV infection.},

   abstract = {BACKGROUND: Celiac disease is common in both children and adults. Small intestinal biopsy is mandatory for establishing a diagnosis. Anti-endomysial antibodies, detected by immunofluorescence, have a sensitivity and specificity close to 100% in the diagnosis of CD. Recently, tissue transglutaminase has been identified as the target autoantigen of antibodies against endomysium, and TTG antibodies are comparable to EMA-IMF in the diagnosis of CD. OBJECTIVE: To evaluate a new enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay kit for EMA, compared to EMA-IMF and TTG antibodies in the diagnosis of CD. METHODS: Our study population included all subjects with positive EMA-IMF who underwent intestinal biopsy (n = 21). From the same sera, TTG antibodies and EMA-ELISA were determined, and all antibody results were compared to the biopsy findings. RESULTS: EMA-IMF was able to predict biopsy findings of CD in 19 of 21 cases (90.5%). When patients with biopsy findings compatible with CD and positive EMA-IMF (n = 19) were tested for EMA-ELISA and TTG antibodies, 18 of the 19 were positive for both EMA-ELISA and TTG antibodies. A significant correlation was found between EMA-ELISA and TTG antibody titers (r = 0.74, P < 0.001). CONCLUSIONS: Our study demonstrates that EMA-ELISA is comparable to TTG antibodies in the diagnosis of CD, and supports the use of EMA-ELISA as a serologic marker for this disease.},

A 54 year old patient with a pancerebellar syndrome and known ulcerative jejunoileitis is described. Small bowel biopsy showed evidence of enteropathy associated T cell lymphoma and subsequent neuropathological analysis and immunophenotyping confirmed metastasis of this tumour to the cerebellum. The presence of anti-gliadin antibodies and MRI evidence of a more longstanding process suggested additional immunologically mediated cerebellar dysfunction. Lymphomatous involvement of the CNS is rare in patients with complicated enteropathies, and has not been previously reported to involve the cerebellar parenchyma. This diagnostic possibility should be borne in mind before attributing cerebellar dysfunction in patients with the coeliac related enteropathies to nutritional compromise or immunological dysfunction (gluten ataxia) alone.},

   abstract = {An increased awareness of the higher incidence of osteopenia and osteoporosis associated with a number of gastrointestinal disease states has occurred over the last few years. High rates of bone loss have been reported in luminal diseases such as inflammatory bowel disease and celiac disease as well as in cholestatic liver diseases and in the post-liver transplant setting. The post-gastrectomy state and chronic pancreatitis are also associated with decreased bone density. Publications over the last year have provided a better understanding of the true incidence of osteoporosis and fracture risk in these gastrointestinal disease states. Dual-energy x-ray absorptiometry remains the diagnostic procedure of choice. Biochemical markers of bone resorption have a role in identifying those patients with ongoing bone loss and monitoring their response to therapy. Identification of patients at risk and initiation of measures to prevent bone loss form the optimal therapeutic strategy. This article reviews advancements in the understanding of the development and activation of osteoblasts and osteoclasts. It also reviews the recent data concerning the diagnosis and treatment of bone loss associated with various gastrointestinal disease states.},

METHODS: A total of 147 Dutch families with at least one patient with biopsy-proven CD were available for this study. In all patients, CD was diagnosed according to the revised European Society for Pediatric Gastroenterology and Nutrition criteria. A microsatellite marker in a noncoding region of the tTG gene was investigated for both linkage and association. Linkage was tested by determining the amount of allele sharing between affected brothers and sisters (affected sibling [sib] pair analysis). Association was determined by comparing transmission of certain tTG alleles from parents to CD patients to the nontransmitted alleles by the transmission/disequilibrium test. RESULTS: Linkage analysis did not show cosegregation of the tTG gene with celiac disease in our families, and there was no association between certain tTG alleles and celiac disease. Furthermore, the tTG gene could be excluded as a CD susceptibility gene. CONCLUSION: Our results indicate that the tTG gene can be excluded as a major primary genetic factor in CD pathogenesis.},

   abstract = {OBJECTIVES: It has been suggested that environmental factors other than gliadin might play a role in pathogenesis of celiac disease. Cigarette smoking was reported to exert a protective effect against the development of symptomatic celiac disease; however, this relationship was not confirmed. The aim of this study was to determine the effect of cigarette smoking on celiac disease. METHODS: A cohort of 87 consecutive celiac disease patients attending the clinic of Malabsorption and 174 age- and sex-matched individuals diagnosed with functional GI disorder were included in the study. Clinical information was obtained both at the time of diagnosis and at follow-up by reviewing the clinical history. Smoking information was obtained through an in-person interview using a questionnaire. RESULTS: Although 33% of controls were current smokers at the time of the study, only 16% of celiac patients were smokers at diagnosis (odds ratio, 0.39; 95% confidence interval 0.19-0.79; p < 0.006). The proportion of nonsmokers among patients (84%) was significantly greater than that among controls (67%; odds ratio, 2.54; 95% confidence interval 1.27-5.16; p < 0.007). Current smoker patients had a lower baseline BMI (p < 0.05) and body weight (p < 0.05) compared to former smokers. Compared with nonsmokers, control individuals who were active smokers at entry in the study were younger (p < 0.02) and had lower body weight (p < 0.03) and BMI (p < 0.03). Interestingly, positive lineal correlation was observed between age at diagnosis and daily cigarette consumption (r = 0.72; p < 0.004) in active smokers. We did not detect any relationship either between causes for cessation of smoking and clinical symptoms or between differences in the proportions of smoking habits when patients were stratified according to their clinical status at diagnosis (symptomatic vs subclinical/asymptomatic cases). CONCLUSIONS: This study provides evidence that, compared with control subjects, a significantly lower proportion of patients with celiac disease were current smokers at the time of diagnosis, and that cigarette smoking delayed diagnosis of celiac disease. Our study suggests that the nutritional compromise of patients with celiac disease who smoked resulted from the summation of the effect of celiac disease per se and that produced by the smoking habit. Further studies are necessary to identify whether the relationship between smoking and celiac disease is causal or incidental.},

   abstract = {AIMS: Gluten ingestion in coeliac disease is associated with alterations of the intestinal mucosa, especially the expansion of the lamina propria. Antiendomysium and antireticulin antibodies may result from interactions between gliadin and extracellular matrix components. By behaving as autoantigens, connective tissue proteins could initiate mucosal damage. This study evaluates changes in the distribution of laminin, type IV collagen, and fibronectin in the mucosa of patients with coeliac disease in an attempt to explain the alterations of mucosal morphology. METHODS: Intestinal biopsies were obtained from patients with coeliac disease on admission and while on a gluten free diet. The distribution of type IV collagen, laminin, fibronectin, and alpha-smooth muscle actin was evaluated by immunofluorescence and by immunogold labelling and electron microscopy. RESULTS: In patients with coeliac disease, the intensity of type IV collagen, laminin, and fibronectin immunofluorescent staining was decreased and less well defined than in controls, with frequent breaches in the basement membrane; fibronectin staining was weak in the distal third of the elongated crypts and absent under the flat surface. The distribution of smooth muscle fibre in the distal lamina propria of flat mucosae was altered. The distribution of these proteins was normal as assessed by immunoelectron microscopy. CONCLUSIONS: The intensity of staining of some components of the basement membrane is decreased in coeliac disease and the distribution of smooth muscle fibres is altered. These changes may result from interactions between gliadin and components of the extracellular matrix and may play a role in the genesis of mucosal lesions and in the damage to the epithelium.},

This interaction not only plays a role in the normal morphological organization of the intestinal mucosa but also in the organization and maturation of the enterocytes, the development of some of their enzymatic activities, the transport of nutrients and the restitution of the epithelium following denudation of the surface of villi due to loss of enterocytes. It is thought that disturbances of the cells of the connective tissue, especially of the myofibroblasts as well as of some of the above mentioned mechanisms, participate in the pathogenesis of some gastrointestinal diseases, celiac disease among them.

   abstract = {BACKGROUND: Exocrine pancreatic insufficiency is a common problem in persons with cystic fibrosis causing malabsorption and poor growth. The 72-hour fecal fat study is the best qualitative measure of fat malabsorption used in clinical practice. This test has several drawbacks, which include cost and logistics. The steatocrit has been proposed as a rapid method to assess fat malabsorption. OBJECTIVES: The objective of this study was to determine whether the steatocrit is an accurate estimation of fat malabsorption in persons with cystic fibrosis. METHODS: Forty-nine stool samples for steatocrit processing were obtained from 72-hour fecal fat collections performed on twenty-seven persons with cystic fibrosis. Stools were weighed and homogenized with sand and water. The emulsified specimen was pipetted into heparinized capillary tubes and centrifuged for 15 minutes. The length of the fatty layer was compared to the length of the solid layer plus the fatty layer in each tube to determine the steatocrit value. Four steatocrit mixtures were evaluated: (1) standard steatocrit, (2) dilute steatocrit, (3) acid steatocrit, (4) dilute acid steatocrit. Steatocrit values were compared with the coefficient of fat absorption determined from the 72-hour fecal fat collection. RESULTS: The correlation coefficient of the steatocrit and the coefficient of fat absorption ranged from -.045 to -.491. Only the coefficient of fat absorption and the acid steatocrit had a significant correlation ( = 0.033). CONCLUSION: The steatocrit is an imprecise measure of fat absorption and not clinically useful in estimating steatorrhea.},

   abstract = {There is growing awareness that primary gastrointestinal pathology may play an important role in the inception and clinical expression of some childhood developmental disorders, including autism. In addition to frequent gastrointestinal symptoms, children with autism often manifest complex biochemical and immunological abnormalities. The gut-brain axis is central to certain encephalopathies of extra-cranial origin, hepatic encephalopathy being the best characterized. Commonalities in the clinical characteristics of hepatic encephalopathy and a form of autism associated with developmental regression in an apparently previously normal child, accompanied by immune-mediated gastrointestinal pathology, have led to the proposal that there may be analogous mechanisms of toxic encephalopathy in patients with liver failure and some children with autism. Aberrations in opioid biochemistry are common to these two conditions, and there is evidence that opioid peptides may mediate certain aspects of the respective syndromes. The generation of plausible and testable hypotheses in this area may help to identify new treatment options in encephalopathies of extra-cranial origin. Therapeutic targets for this autistic phenotype may include: modification of diet and entero-colonic microbial milieu in order to reduce toxin substrates, improve nutritional status and modify mucosal immunity; anti-inflammatory/immunomodulatory therapy; and specific treatment of dysmotility, focusing, for example, on the pharmacology of local opioid activity in the gut.},

   abstract = {BACKGROUND: Patients with celiac disease are diagnosed at any age and can exhibit a wide range of clinical manifestations. The reasons for this are unclear. The aim of this study was to investigate a possible correlation between the HLA-DQA1 and HLA-DQB1 genetic markers and clinical features of celiac disease. METHODS: A total of 133 patients with celiac disease were tested for the HLA-DQA1 and HLA-DQB1 genes. Their corresponding allele and haplotype frequency distributions were estimated from the phenotypes found. The results were correlated with data from the clinical records. RESULTS: The DQ2 molecule was found in 93% of the patients, and DQ2 or DQ8 was found in 98%. The DQA1*0201-DQB1*0202 haplotype showed strong linkage disequilibrium. DQ2 homozygosis was significantly associated with female sex, earlier age at diagnosis, and shorter delay between onset of symptoms and diagnosis. Double-dose DQB1*02 (01-02) allele was more frequent in patients with the classic presentation of the disease. CONCLUSIONS: The genetic markers investigated may prove useful for diagnosing and managing celiac disease. With some clinical variables, correlations not previously described were found. These correlations have a moderate strength and, therefore, must be confirmed by other studies.},
