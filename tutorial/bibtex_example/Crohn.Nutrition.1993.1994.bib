   abstract = {We examined the rhythm of weight velocity in eight patients with Crohn's disease. In this paper we used the spline smoothing technique to study the cycle in the weight increment velocity curves derived from individual data during nutritional therapy. As a result of the weight measurement at four-day intervals, an infradian rhythm with the average cycle of 9.6 +/- 0.7 was recognized in all of the subjects in terms of the weight increment velocity. This rhythm was especially conspicuous in three adolescent patients with serious nutritional lesion. The cycle of the rhythm was unaffected by any of the following factors: energy intake, contents of nutritional therapy, medical examination during the period. Our findings of a common cycle in the process of convalescence from a low nutritious stage in patients with Crohn's disease suggest that, in others as well, the weight increment velocity might have an infradian rhythm with a kind of inherent periodicity.},

   abstract = {BACKGROUND: Recent studies in adults have shown that polymeric (whole protein) diets are as effective as semi-elemental and elemental formulae for the induction of remission in small bowel Crohn's disease. Whole protein diets are more palatable and cheaper. There have been no studies confirming efficacy in children. PATIENTS AND METHODS: We report our experience with seven children with active small bowel Crohn's disease given a casein-based, polymeric feed rich in TGF-beta 2 (Specific Polymeric Diet; Nestle-Clintec; Vevey, Switzerland) as complete nutrition for 8 weeks. RESULTS: Initial and follow-up assessments were performed. All children showed a significant improvement in disease activity, with C-reactive protein returning to normal, an increase in serum albumin and a good weight gain. Initial and follow-up ileal biopsies were assessed and showed reduced mucosal inflammation in six of seven children, with complete healing in two. CONCLUSION: In an uncontrolled descriptive study we have shown that a polymeric (whole protein) diet is a therapeutic option for small bowel Crohn's disease in children. By comprehensive follow-up we have demonstrated clinical and biochemical remission, with an improved endoscopic appearance and a reduction of mucosal inflammation in the terminal ileum.},

   abstract = {Corticosteroids are an efficient treatment for active Crohn's disease. The treatment has to be undertaken with a daily intake equivalent to 1 mg/kg per day of prednisolone for a 3 to 7 week period. Immunosuppressive agents are indicated in case of corticodependency or in case of large intestinal resection. Artificial nutrition (enteral or parenteral) is proposed in corticoresistant forms, and is usually followed by an immunosuppressive therapy. Surgical management is reserved for complications, including resistance to all medical therapy. Surgical resection has to be limited in order to avoid a short bowel syndrome. Surgery should not be considered as the ideal therapy as it has been demonstrated that recurrence after surgery increases at distance. 5-aminosalycilates compounds are an alternative therapy in mild attacks. Mesalazine may reduce the recurrence and could be considered as a possible maintenance treatment.},

   abstract = {Damage to the mucosal barrier may be assessed, non-invasively by use of sugar probes, which permeate through the transcellular or paracellular (tight junction) routes. A standardised test, with analysis of a five hour urine collection has proved useful in studying the sequelae of non-steroid anti-inflammatory drug (NSAID) administration, untreated coeliac disease, and enteric infections. Choice of probe molecule is crucial and lactulose/l-rhamnose seem to be satisfactory, in contrast with polyethylene glycol. Significant correlations have been seen between permeability and plasma IgA concentrates in nephropathy, and between permeability and the passage of neutrophil chemotactic agents. The increased permeability associated with NSAID treatment may relate to the adverse effects of NSAIDs on enterocyte mitochondrial morphology and metabolism. These two factors may predispose the mucosa to permeation of bacterial chemoattractant molecules that elaborate a local inflammatory response. A similar mechanism may operate in patients with untreated Crohn's disease, who show abnormally high permeability. Remission induced by treatment with elemental diets coincides with a reduction in permeability. The period to relapse correlated with the inability of patients to maintain low permeability to sugar probes. These results suggest a mechanism for the benefits of elemental enteral nutrients in the treatment of Crohn's disease.},

   abstract = {Osteoporosis with attendant increased fracture risk is a common complication of many other diseases. Indeed, almost all chronic diseases make some impact on life-style, usually by restricting physical activity and hence reducing the anabolic effect of exercise and gravitational strains on the skeleton. Restricted appetite and modified gastrointestinal tract function is another commonplace finding that has an impact on bone nutrition and synthesis, as on other systems. Sex hormone status is of particular importance for the maintenance of the normal skeleton, and the postmenopausal woman is at particular risk for most causes of secondary osteoporosis. In dealing with secondary osteoporosis in the hypo-oestrogenic woman, the question of giving hormone replacement therapy in addition to other disease-specific therapy should always be considered, as, for example, in a young amenorrhoeic woman with Crohn's disease. Similarly, in hypogonadal men the administration of testosterone is useful for bone conservation. The wider availability of bone densitometry ought to make us more aware of the presence of osteoporosis in the many disease states discussed above. This is particularly important as the life span of such patients is now increased by improved management of the underlying disease process in many instances. Even in steroid-induced osteoporosis--one of the commonest and most severe forms of osteoporosis--we now have some effective therapy in the form of the bisphosphonates and other anti-bone-resorbing drug classes. The possibility of prophylaxis against secondary osteoporosis has therefore become a possibility, although the very long-term effects of such drug regimens are still unknown. In some situations, such as thyrotoxicosis, Cushing's syndrome and immobilization, spontaneous resolution of at least part of the osteoporosis is possible after cure of the underlying problem. The shorter the existence of the basic problem, the more successful the restoration of the skeleton appears to be. A useful credo for clinicians with respect to secondary osteoporosis is: to think of it; to use specific therapy for the underlying disease; to reduce or remove completely any relevant drug or toxic material; to optimize physical activity and general nutrition; to treat hypogonadism if present and feasible; and to consider the use of specific anti-bone-resorbing or other bone active drugs.},

We measured urinary growth hormone concentrations in 36 children with chronic inflammatory bowel disease and 51 normal controls. The median urinary concentration of growth hormone in the stunted children with chronic inflammatory bowel disease was 15.8 ng/g creatinine (range 4.3-32.6), compared with 11.7 ng/g creatinine (range 4.1-35.9) in those with normal growth. The difference was statistically not significant (p = 0.15). Moreover, there was no significant difference between the patients and the control group. One stunted patient had a urinary growth hormone (UGH) concentration below the normal range, whereas four patients with normal height were also below the normal range. Four of these five patients (80%) were on corticosteroid treatment at the time of urinary collection, whereas only 26% of the patients with normal UGH were also on corticosteroid treatment. We conclude that growth retardation in children with chronic inflammatory bowel disease is probably not related to growth hormone deficiency but must involve other mechanisms.},

   abstract = {BACKGROUND/AIMS: Cytokines are thought to be important in mediating tissue damage in inflammatory bowel disease (IBD). Many of the in vivo activities of tumor necrosis factor alpha (TNF-alpha) match the changes found in IBD, but its importance is controversial. METHODS: A sensitive, reverse hemolytic plaque assay was used to determine the frequency of TNF-alpha secreting cells isolated from mucosal biopsy specimens of children with Crohn's disease or ulcerative colitis (UC) and non-IBD controls before and after medical treatment. RESULTS: Frequency of TNF-alpha secreting cells was significantly increased in biopsy specimens from children with mild, nonspecific inflammation compared with those with histologically normal intestine. Frequency did not increase in UC compared with children with nonspecific inflammation but was significantly greater in Crohn's disease than in UC. After treatment, the frequency of TNF-alpha secreting cells was reduced in patients receiving cyclosporin A, not reduced in patients with steroids or enteral nutrition, and not changed with treatment in UC. CONCLUSIONS: TNF-alpha secreting cells are increased in the mucosa of inflamed intestine, regardless of pathogenesis. In patients with IBD, higher levels are seen in Crohn's disease than in UC, probably reflecting the extensive T-cell activation in Crohn's disease. No relation existed between histological healing and the frequency of TNF-alpha-secreting cells.},

Aim of our study was focused on assessing thrombocyte count in evaluation of the activity in Crohn's disease (CD). The study included a total of 19 patients [6 men, 13 women (aged 18-57 years, mean 33, median 28]. All patients were malnourished in active stage of the disease on total parenteral and/or enteral nutrition (TP/EN). Thrombocytes were estimated at the beginning and after 3 weeks of TP/EN in venous blood sample using automatic analyser Coulter Counter JT3 (normal range: 130-380.10(9)/l). Serum prealbumin, transferrin, haptoglobin, alpha 1-orosomucoid and C-reactive protein were measured simultaneously. Thrombocytes count below 400.10(9)/l was found only in 1/19 at the beginning and in 7/19 patients in the end of the study. After 3 weeks of TP/EN a significant platelet count fall was found (mean +/- sd: 472 +/- 98 vs. 354 +/- 110, p < 0.01). A correlation was found between thrombocytes and serum prealbumin (r = -0.3871, p < 0.05), haptoglobin (r = 0.5247, p < 0.001), alpha 1-orosomucoid (r = 0.4857, p < 0.01) a C-reactive protein (r = 0.4354, p < 0.01). CONCLUSION: Thrombocyte count helped in the assessing of disease activity in CD on 3-week-TP/EN. Improvement of clinical status, increase of nutritional parameters and decrease of positive acute phase reactants were associated with a fall of platelet count in 15/19 patients.},

The aim of our study has been focused on serum IgG subclasses in Crohn's disease with resected bowel (11 patients) and without previous surgery for Crohn's disease (12 patients). All patients were in active stage of the disease on total parenteral nutrition. Serum IgG subclasses were estimated by means of radial immunodiffusion. There was no significant differences between in IgG subclasses in Crohn's disease with and without bowel resection. IgG2 over 4.5 g/l was found only in 2/12 with resected bowel and 1/11 without previous surgery for Crohn's disease. Surprisingly, IgG1/IgG2 ratio below 1.5 was found only in 5/23 persons. In 3/23 patients IgG1 was over 10.5 g/l although there was no doubt about the diagnosis of Crohn's disease. IgG subclasses failed to help in confirmation of the diagnosis of Crohn's disease. Serum IgG subclasses alterations probably are not influenced by bowel resection and/or nutritional status.},

   abstract = {An increased degradation of colonic mucus by bacterial enzymes might participate in the development of mucosal lesions in inflammatory bowel disease. The biodisponibility of drugs used in the treatment of such disease relies upon the metabolic activity of colonic bacterial flora. This activity can be indirectly assessed by measuring fecal enzymatic activities. The aim of this study was to compare fecal beta-galactosidase (beta-gal) activity in controls, in patients suffering from extradigestive inflammatory disease and in patients with Crohn's disease (CD). Three groups were studied including 11 healthy volunteers (6 F, 5 M) mean age 29 years (21-37), 20 patients with rheumatoid arthritis (RA) (17 F, 3 M), mean age 61.5 years, and 34 patients with non operated CD (21 F, 13 M) mean age: 27 years (13-50). The Crohn disease activity index (CDAI) was > 150 in 24 and < 150 in 10. beta-gal activity was measured in fecal extracts by its ability to hydrolyze paranitrophenyl beta-D-galactopyranoside and expressed as units of enzymatic activity/gram of fecal proteins. beta-gal activity was significantly decreased in patients with CD (16 +/- 4.5 U/g) (m +/- sem) as compared with patients with RA (353 +/- 64 U/g) (P < 0.0001) and to controls (263 +/- 40 U/g) (P = 0.002). beta-gal activity was not significantly different in controls and in patients with RA. Patients with active CD had a significantly lower beta-gal activity than patients with quiescent CD (9.5 +/- 3.7 U/g vs 31.4 +/- 11.5 U/g) (P = 0.006).(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS)},

The effect of TPN upon the levels of acute phase proteins is unknown. Serum levels of CRP and orosomucoid were measured simultaneously over a four year period in 13 patients receiving TPN for Crohn's disease, nine patients with noninflammatory causes of intestinal failure, and 16 patients with Crohn's disease treated without TPN. An acute phase response was found with a similar frequency in both groups of patients with Crohn's disease (73.6% and 83.9% for Crohn's with and without TPN respectively), but was less prevalent in patients receiving TPN for non-inflammatory causes of intestinal failure (56.1%, P < 0.01). In this latter group, the acute phase response consisted primarily of an isolated elevation of orosomucoid (78.4%), compared with patients with Crohn's disease alone (21.1%, P < 0.001) and with Crohn's disease and TPN (46.6%, P < 0.05). Liver function abnormalities were seen on 68.8% of occasions in patients with noninflammatory causes of intestinal failure who had elevated levels of orosomucoid, compared with 34.9% of occasions on which orosomucoid levels were normal (P < 0.001). TPN may lead to isolated elevation of serum levels of orosomucoid, reducing the value of this acute phase protein in monitoring the activity of Crohn's disease in patients receiving TPN.},

The index takes into account the location and extent of resection, and its value can be calculated from operative records. Retrospective (n = 218) and prospective (n = 68) series of patients were studied. Diarrhoea and malnutrition developed in 102 patients (47 per cent) and 13 patients (6 per cent) respectively in the retrospective series, and in 40 (59 per cent) and one (1 per cent) of those in the prospective series. The handicap index correlated with faecal weight and faecal fat in 112 patients tested. Positive and negative predictive values of an index score greater than 20 for the development of diarrhoea, and over 50 for the development of malnutrition, were 0.64 and 0.90, and 0.60 and 0.99 respectively in the retrospective series; values were 0.80 and 0.71, and 0.25 and 1.00 in the prospective series. The postoperative handicap index is a useful tool for predicting the functional consequences of bowel resection for Crohn's disease.},

The overall prevalence of H pylori seropositivity in the IBD patients was 22%, which was significantly less than that of 52% in the controls (p < 0.002). There was no difference in prevalence between ulcerative colitis and Crohn's patients. The low seropositivity in the IBD patients resulted from a very low prevalence of 10% in those currently receiving sulphasalazine (n = 40) and similarly low prevalence of 7% in those previously receiving sulphasalazine (n = 30). In those receiving olsalazine or mesalazine and who had never had sulphasalazine, the prevalence of seropositivity was 45%. Further studies using 14C urea breath test and microscopy of antral biopsy specimens confirmed that the negative serology in patients receiving sulphasalazine resulted from absence of the infection rather than absence of humoral immune response to it. In six control patients with H pylori infection, a two week course of sulphasalazine (500 mg four times daily) only caused slight suppression of the 14C urea breath test. In vitro studies failed to show any direct antibacterial effect of sulphasalazine on H pylori. These findings indicate that longterm treatment with sulphasalazine leads to eradication of H pylori infection and that this does not result from a direct antibacterial effect. It may be caused by the drug treating the gastritis and thereby depriving the bacterium of essential nutrients exuded by the inflamed mucosa.},

   abstract = {The developments in enteral feeding for Crohn's disease in the past decade are critically reviewed. The advent of amino acid based chemically defined elemental diets signalled the end of 'total bowel rest' in the management of these patients. Subsequently, controlled clinical trials showed that elemental diets were as effective as corticosteroids in inducing clinical remission in patients with acute exacerbations of Crohn's disease. The later use of peptide based elemental diets, in Crohn's disease produced somewhat conflicting results. The initial uncontrolled studies suggest that polymeric whole protein diets might also be effective in the management of acute exacerbations of the disease, casting in turn doubts concerning the role of dietary antigens in the pathogenesis of Crohn's disease. Results of controlled studies comparing the use of elemental and polymeric diets as primary therapy in Crohn's disease have, however, also produced conflicting results. The results of one recent controlled trial in which the use of polymeric diet was compared with that of corticosteroids does, however, suggest that these diets may have a primary therapeutic effect in Crohn's disease. An analysis of the composition of some of the enteral diets used in different trials suggest that the effectiveness of enteral diets in treating active Crohn's disease might relate more to their fat than nitrogen composition. A hypothesis is proposed that the effectiveness of enteral nutrition in the primary therapy of acute exacerbations of Crohn's disease occurs because the successful diets used contain insufficient precursors for arachidonate derived eicosanoid synthesis.},

Enteral neomycin, parenteral polymyxin or metronidazole and cefuroxime were ineffective anti-endotoxin treatments in this model.

The polymeric diet was administered through a fine bore nasogastric tube by continuous, pump assisted infusion (2800 (SEM 120) kcal/day). The steroid group received 1 mg/kg/day of prednisone. Both treatments were effective in inducing clinical remission: 15 of the 17 patients given steroids and 12 of the 15 patients assigned to the polymeric diet went into clinical remission (defined by a Van Hees index < 120) within four weeks of treatment. The percentage reduction of the Van Hees index was 34.8 (4.9)% for steroids and 32.3 (5)% for enteral nutrition (mean difference 2.5%; 95% CI--11.8% to +16.8%). Mean time elapsed to achieve remission was similar in both groups (2.0 (1) v 2.4 (1.2) weeks). Tolerance of the enteral diet was excellent. Four patients in the steroid group had mild complications attributable to this treatment. Ten patients (66.6%) in the steroid group and five (41.6%) in the enteral nutrition group relapsed within a year of discharge, but no differences were found in the cumulative probability of relapse during the follow up period. These results suggest that polymeric enteral nutrition is as safe and effective as steroids in inducing short term remission in active Crohn's disease.},

The therapeutic efficacy of oral mesalazine in small bowel inflammation, although theoretically promising, remains unproven. In an open-labeled initial trial, timed-release 5-aminosalicylic acid (5-ASA), administered at a daily dosage of 30.6 +/- 9.0 mg/kg (mean +/- SEM) to children with active Crohn's disease involving the small intestine, was associated with improvement on the Harvey index in six of 12 patients treated for 8.1 +/- 3.9 weeks. In a subsequent prospective, double-blind study 14 children, ages 9.3 to 16.1 years, with active Crohn's disease limited radiologically in the small intestine were randomized to receive either timed-release 5-ASA [50 mg/kg/day (maximum 3 g/day)] or placebo for 8 weeks. Following a 4-week washout period, patients crossed over to receive the other study drug for a further 8 weeks. Six children completed the entire 20-week trial. The van Hees index improved among patients receiving 5-ASA for 8 weeks (delta = -18 +/- 6.4) but deteriorated among patients given placebo (delta = +14 +/- 4.1) (p < 0.05). Mean Crohn's Disease Activity Index (CDAI) decreased marginally after 8 weeks of 5-ASA treatment (delta = -48 +/- 38.2) but not with placebo (delta = -3.0 +/- 7.9) (p = 0.31).

   abstract = {The onset and course of ulcerative colitis diagnosed in 38 children at or before 10 years of age were reviewed. The mean age at onset was 5.9 years. A family history of inflammatory bowel disease was present in 24% of patients, and 13% had a history of cow milk allergy in infancy. Initially, by radiologic or colonoscopic studies, 71% had total colonic disease, 13% had left-sided colitis, and 6% had proctitis; extensive examination was not performed in 4 patients. Four patients (11%) presented with severe colitis, 14 (37%) with moderate colitis, and 20 (53%) with mild colitis. The most frequent symptoms were abdominal pain (94%), diarrhea (84%), and rectal bleeding (84%). Between 2 and 10 years after diagnosis, 89% of children had total colonic disease and 11% had left-sided disease. All four patients with severe disease at onset responded to medical therapy with one having a colectomy 15 years later with pathology consistent with Crohn's disease. Of those with moderate disease, half had infrequent moderate recurrences and half had intermittent mild disease. One patient had colectomy at 21 years for intractable disease. Of the 20 with mild disease, 16 continued to have intermittent mild recurrences, 1 had chronic mild disease, 2 had moderate recurrent disease, and 1 has remained asymptomatic for 5 years. Psychiatric disturbances requiring therapy were identified in 5 (13%) children. Results are encouraging: after the first 2 years of illness, two thirds of the children have had subsequent mild colitis with infrequent relapses and three quarters consider their life to be of good quality.},

   abstract = {In order to examine the presentation and course of Crohn's disease (CD) versus those of ulcerative colitis (UC) in children < or = 10 years of age, a retrospective review of children < or = 10 years old with inflammatory bowel disease singled out 40 patients and compared their findings with those of 38 children with UC. The mean age at onset was 7.5 years for CD, as compared with 5.9 years for UC. A family history of inflammatory bowel disease was present in 13 patients (32%). Abdominal pain (97%), diarrhea (78%), and weight loss (88%) were the major initial complaints, with growth retardation present in 12 (30%) children. At onset, four children had diffuse small-bowel disease, nine had terminal ileal disease, 15 had ileocolitis, and 12 had colitis; at the end of the study two had diffuse small-bowel disease, four had terminal ileal disease, 25 had ileocolitis, and seven had colitis. Extra-intestinal manifestations increased with duration of disease. Although the number of recurrences did not differ greatly between groups, those with ileocolitis and colitis needed longer steroid therapy and more days in hospital than did those with only small-bowel disease. Operation was required in 42.5% of children with CD, as compared with 5% of those with UC, with six CD children (35%) requiring later reoperation for recurrent disease or fistula and abscess. Two children died from causes unrelated to their disease (gastric volvulus, carcinoma of the breast).(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS)},

   abstract = {Crohn's disease (CD) and ulcerative colitis (UC) represent clinically distinct chronic inflammatory bowel diseases (IBD) of unknown etiology. Although the mucosal immune system is implicated in their pathogenesis, immunological differences between the two disorders are not well defined. The aim of this study was to compare in vitro mucosal T-lymphocyte function in CD and UC. Peripheral blood mononuclear cell interleukin-2 (IL-2) production was similar in pediatric IBD and control patients under unstimulated conditions, but was significantly increased in response to phytohemagglutinin (PHA) stimulation for the UC group. Lamina propria mononuclear cells (LPMNC) isolated from colonic resections in IBD patients had significantly lower spontaneous proliferation and IL-2 production in vitro than did LPMNC of control patients. In contrast, significantly greater IL-2 production was detected when the LPMNC of CD patients were cultured with PHA, in comparison with those of UC or control patients. When indomethacin, a prostaglandin synthetase inhibitor, was added to the cultures, significantly increased IL-2 secretion was observed for CD LPMNC, but not for UC cultures, under both stimulated and unstimulated conditions. These findings demonstrate abnormal LPMNC IL-2 production in IBD. Furthermore, our data suggest that inhibition of the prostaglandin synthetase pathway upregulates IL-2 production by LPMNC in CD. These results support the hypothesis that immunoregulatory mechanisms controlling IL-2 production differ between CD and UC.},

   abstract = {One hundred and two patients with Crohn's colitis present on average for 8 years, were studied retrospectively in order to determine whether or not a group of patients existed in whom the disease remained limited to the colon, and if such a group could be identified early on in the course of the disorder. At the time of the diagnosis of Crohn's disease, 34 patients had a concomitant anoperineal lesion, while 68 had disease affecting the colon only. In the latter, at the end of the follow-up period, the disease remained exclusively limited to the colon in 39 cases (57 p. cent). The actuarial rate of non-extra-colonic spread was 75, 40 and 35 p. cent at 5, 10 and 15 years respectively. Spread involved above all the anoperineal region (55 p. cent at 10 years), and less often the ileum (20 p. cent at 10 years). In patients monitored for at least 6 years, there was no significant difference between those in whom disease had spread and those in whom it remained limited to the colon, regarding the main initial clinical findings by history and examination, the same applying after the disease had been present for 3 years. These results would go against the existence of a specific entity of "Crohn's disease affecting the colon as an organ" and support the opinion that coloproctectomy with a pouch should be avoided in colitis due to Crohn's disease.},

   abstract = {Fistulas complicating Crohn's disease often are refractory to medical management. Immunosuppressive therapy is sometimes effective but requires several months before efficacy can be determined. We treated five patients with Crohn's disease complicated by chronic draining fistulas unresponsive to previous surgery, steroids, antibiotics, total parenteral nutrition, 6-mercaptopurine, or azathioprine with continuous infusion cyclosporin A (CyA). The five patients had a total of 12 fistulas (five enterovaginal, three perianal, three enterocutaneous, one enterovesical). CyA was administered initially at 4 mg/kg/day for 6-10 days, after which oral dosing was begun at 8 mg/kg/day and adjusted to maintain trough serum levels of 100-200 ng/ml. All fistulas responded to CyA infusion with decreased drainage and with improvement in both perifistular inflammation and patient comfort. Complete resolution of drainage was seen in 10 of the 12 fistulas. Initial response was seen after a mean of 3.6 days (range, 2-5 days) with complete cessation of drainage in the 10 fistulas after a mean of 7.9 days (range, 3-28 days). Therapy was continued for a mean of 6.2 months (range, 1.5-18 months). Relapse was seen in two perianal fistulas (3 wk and 7 months) and in two enterovaginal fistulas (1 and 2 months). Two of these recurrences corresponded to lowered serum levels of CyA. An enterocutaneous fistula also recurred after 2.5 months, associated with a distal stricture that required resection. Side effects were minor except for a mycotic aneurysm in one patient which occurred after 7 months of treatment. Intravenous CyA may prove to be a useful agent in the initial management of refractory Crohn's disease fistulas, although relapse as serum levels are lowered and infectious complications are limiting factors for long-term use as a single agent.},

Some suggested causes include inapparent infection with Mycobacterium tuberculosis, or autoimmunity evoked by this organism. We have therefore sought links with mycobacterial disease. METHODS: We assayed the % agalactosyl IgG, antibody to a tuberculosis-specific 38 kDa protein, and antibody to the mycobacterial 65 kDa heat shock protein (HSP), in patients with active or inactive Takayasu's arteritis, in whom the diagnosis of tuberculosis was excluded. The results were compared with findings in tuberculosis (positive controls), normal donors and patients with Wegener's granulomatosis. RESULTS: The % agalactosyl IgG in patients with active arteritis was in the range previously seen only in rheumatoid arthritis, Crohn's disease, and the mycobacterioses. Similarly, significantly raised antibody to the purified 38-kDa protein of M. tuberculosis, and to the 65-kDa HSP of M. leprae, was found in 78% of patients with Takayasu's arteritis, and the levels were higher in those with active disease. CONCLUSION: These results suggest that Takayasu's arteritis particularly clearly illustrates the occasional relationship between mycobacteria and diseases of superficially autoimmune pathogenesis.},

During the year preceding diagnosis, height growth velocity was significantly reduced in both ulcerative colitis and Crohn's disease. At the time of diagnosis, weight-for-height was subnormal in both children with ulcerative colitis (p < 0.05) and those with Crohn's disease (p < 0.001), while height was reduced only in children with Crohn's disease (p < 0.05). Weight for height was normalized within one year in ulcerative colitis, after the initiation of medical therapy. In Crohn's disease, weight-for-height improved during the years following diagnosis but height remained subnormal. Children with ulcerative colitis reached puberty at the normal time and their final heights became normal. In children with Crohn's disease, puberty was delayed (p < 0.001) and final height was reduced (p < 0.01). The impact of inflammatory bowel disease on growth was substantial, but it was smaller in this study than in many other published studies. The possible reasons for this difference include use of population-based material and a relatively short interval between the first symptoms and the start of treatment. Our findings indicate that, although final height was significantly reduced in children with Crohn's disease, delayed puberty reduced the negative effects on permanent adult height, to a certain extent compensating for the period of poor growth earlier in life.},

Eighty-four patients received total enteral nutrition with the ED (35 to 40 kcal/kg ideal body weight/day) and/or conventional drug treatment for induction of remission. Sixty-one patients in remission were then followed-up with prolonged ED therapy (home elemental enteral hyperalimentation, HEEH) and/or drugs. During the follow-up periods the course of patients receiving HEEH was better than those of patients without HEEH, namely the cumulative continuous remission rates after one, 2 and 4 years were, 94%, 63% and 63% in the group receiving HEEH, 75%, 66% and 66% in the group receiving HEEH and drugs, 63%, 42% and 0% in the group receiving drugs, and 50%, 33% and 0% in the group receiving no maintenance therapy, respectively. In particular, when more than 30 kcal/kg ideal body weight/day of the ED was given, the maintenance of remission was successful in 95% of the patients. These results indicated that ED therapy was effective not only for the induction of remission but also for the maintenance of remission in Crohn's disease.},

However, the frequency of uveitis in pediatric IBD is not known, as few patients have eye examinations on a routine basis. Experience with a child with Crohn's disease, who had asymptomatic uveitis identified by routine screening initiated because of associated arthritis, prompted us to undertake this evaluation. The purpose of this cross-sectional prospective study was to ascertain the point-prevalence of uveitis in pediatric IBD patients, including 97 with Crohn's disease and 50 with ulcerative colitis. Each child underwent an ophthalmologic assessment, including slit-lamp examination. In Crohn's disease, inflammatory cells and/or flare were observed in the anterior chamber of six (6.2%) patients. These changes were mild in all six patients and required no treatment. In the group with ulcerative colitis, there were no cases of asymptomatic uveitis. There was a higher frequency of asymptomatic transient uveitis in patients with Crohn's colitis (four of 22, 18.2%) than in those of other anatomic subgroups (two of 75, 2.7%; p < 0.05). Frequency of uveitis was also higher in IBD patients having other extraintestinal manifestations (15.0%) than in those without (3.1%; p < 0.10). There was no relationship observed between the activity of bowel disease and presence of ocular inflammation.},

   abstract = {IBD is one of the most significant chronic diseases afflicting children and adolescents. As in adults, UC and CD constitute the two major disease entities, with many of the characteristics of these two diseases being similar in adults and children. With technical advances, a complete endoscopic examination of the colon and terminal ileum can be performed in most children without difficulty. There are, however, a number of aspects of the presentation, course, and management of these diseases that are unique to the pediatric population. Because the impact of inadequate nutrition is much greater in the growing child than in adults, growth failure is a common, serious complication of malnutrition in this population. The psychological impact of a chronic illness on both the developing child and the family can also be significant. The management of this population is further complicated by the lack of adequate studies that assess not only the effect of a medical or surgical therapy on disease activity, but also address the issues of growth and pubertal development. It has been a challenge to extrapolate data from adult studies to the pediatric population. The management of children and adolescents requires a critical understanding of the differences between pediatric and adult patients to maximize growth potential and minimize longterm sequelae of treatment. After a long period of limited controlled studies, however, collaborative efforts are underway to investigate most aspects of pediatric IBD, and we look forward to exciting advances toward the optimal management of children and adolescents with IBD.},

Due to the possibility to provide complete parenteral nutrition from this number during the past 6 years only three patients were operated. During the next and subsequent period 70 patients were reoperated. Relapses occurred most frequently four years after the first operation. As to the extent of resection, the authors agree with the view that 20 cm from the macroscopic borderline of the affection are sufficient without special regard to lymph nodes. Nevertheless it is important to keep in mind that Crohn's disease is a systemic disease and even by radical removal of the affected part this disease cannot be cured by surgery.},

The International Organization for the Study of Inflammatory Bowel Disease (IOIBD) assessment scores decreased in all cases, except for one case out of 51 cases evaluated. Deterioration in nutritional status was not observed in any patient, but rather was maintained or improved; 42 out of the total 51 cases (82.4%) exhibited at least moderate improvement. Treatment was discontinued on account of side effects such as abdominal distension, abdominal pain and diarrhoea in five cases (8.1%). The enteral formula 'Enterued', utilizing low molecular weight peptides as a nitrogen source, appears to improve nutritional status and encourage remission of the inflammatory process with minimal side effects.},

   abstract = {The clinical outcomes of 2968 patients with active cancer receiving home nutrition support are described. Of these patients 1672 were receiving home parenteral nutrition and 1296 were receiving home enteral nutrition. The outcomes of these active cancer patients are compared to those of 123 radiation enteritis ("cured" cancer) and 480 Crohn's disease patients receiving home parenteral nutrition and 918 noncancer dysphagic patients receiving home enteral nutrition. This longitudinal clinical information was reported to the North American Home Parenteral and Enteral Nutrition Patient Registry between 1985 and 1990. Evidence indicates that the number of home parenteral and enteral nutrition patients has increased nationally by about 25% each year between 1989 and 1990. In a subsample of 37 home nutrition support programs that have consistently reported their data to the registry since 1985, more than 90% of their program growth was accounted for by new patients with active cancer. This is now the largest single diagnosis of patients starting home parenteral and enteral nutrition. The mean survival time of cancer patients is 6 months after starting home parenteral and enteral nutrition, but 25% live beyond a year and 20% resume full oral nutrition. Although most active cancer patients experience only partial rehabilitation, for those patients with longer survival, rehabilitation is more complete. The outcome is relatively better for children and for patients whose neoplasm is leukemia, lymphoma, small bowel, or liver. In comparison, 96% of home parenteral nutrition Crohn's patients, 80% of home parenteral nutrition radiation enteritis patients, and 60% of home enteral nutrition noncancer dysphagic patients survive at least 1 year. Adult active cancer home parenteral and enteral nutrition patients do not have a greater incidence of therapy-related readmissions than other patient groups, however, their overall rehospitalization rate is much more frequent. This article discusses factors that may have contributed to this growth in home nutrition support in active cancer patients. It attempts to clarify where this therapy is clearly justified and where more information is needed. It emphasizes some of the special issues that need to be addressed in treating these vulnerable patients.},

One possible side effect of both disease process and prednisone therapy is risk of development of osteoporosis. To evaluate this risk factor, growth, biochemical indices of mineral and vitamin D status, and bone mass were measured in nine adolescents with Crohn's disease (CD) who were treated with ADP (0.3 mg/kg > 3 months per year) compared with eight adolescents treated with minimal ADP exposure (< 3 months per year). Single photon densitometry was used to measure bone mineral mass at the 1/3 distal radius three times over 2 years. Mean age of the 17 CD boys was 13.9 +/- 2.1 years at baseline. CD patients had lower bone BMC/BW mineral content/bone width (BMC/BW) compared with age- and height-matched normal boys at all times. The difference was less when compared to height-matched normal values as CD patients were shorter than healthy reference boys. Plasma 1,25-dihydroxyvitamin D, alkaline phosphatase, and parathyroid hormone significantly increased with treatment of disease but there were no differences between treatment groups. CD patients treated with ADP had similar heights and weights at baseline and demonstrated similar linear growth over 2 years (9.1 cm/2 years) to CD patients without ADP (10.3 cm/2 years). In both groups, BMC/BW increased significantly from year 1 to year 2, but absolute values for bone mass did not differ between the groups.},

A 26-year-old male with Crohn's disease receiving parenteral nutrition suffered repeated episodes of sepsis and developed an infected intra-atrial thrombus despite repeated courses of antimicrobial chemotherapy and surgical intervention. Continued parenteral nutrition was essential du5e to intestinal failure. Taurolin was administered in the parenteral feed, as a 0.3% solution, to prevent recrudescent and recurrent infection. This concentration was shown, in vitro, to be bactericidal to a variety of pathogenic organisms. No recurrence of sepsis, nor any evidence of side effects was observed throughout the 12 month period of Taurolin administration. After 12 months the taurolin was discontinued and within 2 weeks the patient was re-admitted with recurrent septicaemia. Following re-introduction of Taurolin the infection was controlled and the patient remains well. In our experience the addition of taurolin to the nutritive feeds of a patient at risk of sepsis is a safe and effective method of preventing recurrent sepsis.},

He initially experienced a disturbance of his vision, which was followed by various neurological symptoms during the next 3 years. These symptoms rapidly progressed until he finally developed consciousness disturbance. He also manifested erythrocytic macrocytosis, a low serum level of tri-iodothyronine and a high level of thyroxine. His blood levels of various trace minerals and vitamins were normal, except for selenium, which showed extremely low values. In addition, impaired plasma glutathione peroxidase activity was confirmed. After intravenous supplementation of selenium, macrocytosis, tri-iodothyronine and thyroxine values, and glutathione peroxidase activity all became normalized, yet he improved little neurologically. Our case suggests that long-term selenium deficiency may cause progressive and irreversible encephalopathy, and that careful monitoring of this mineral is necessary when an excessive period of total parenteral nutrition is being considered in the clinical setting.},

Twelve of the patients were affected in the small bowel only, two in the large bowel only, and the remaining 10 in both the small and large bowel. The fat-soluble vitamins A and E were significantly decreased in patients with Crohn's disease compared to controls. Among the water-soluble vitamins, vitamins B1, B2 and B6 and folic acid were more depleted in patients with Crohn's disease than in the controls, whereas vitamins B12 and C, nicotinic acid, and biotin were not different between the two groups, and pantothenic acid was increased in patients with Crohn's disease. In addition, vitamin B2 and nicotinic acid showed a negative correlation with the Crohn's disease activity index. These findings suggest that there is a variety of vitamin deficiencies in Crohn's disease prior to treatment and also that concentrations of some vitamins, such as vitamin B2 and nicotinic acid, may reflect the severity of the disease.},

   abstract = {The mechanisms of nutritional therapy in inflammatory bowel disease have not been thoroughly established. It is likely that a further understanding of the underlying disease process will allow better understanding of these forms of therapy, with a sounder rationale for the construction of specific diet constituents for therapy. Regardless, nutritional therapy is likely to be multidimensional, and various forms may affect different aspects of the disease process. Decreased inflammatory factors, decreased antigenic stimuli, provision of essential nutrients, improved immune function, and other factors may all be of varying importance in different patients with inflammatory bowel disease. Little work has been done on the role of diet therapy in the long-term treatment of patients with inflammatory bowel disease as a method of preventing relapse. Parenteral nutrition and elemental diets appear to have limited roles in this area. Some investigation has been done to see if minor modifications of the normal diet can prolong remission periods. Low-fiber diets are frequently recommended for patients with strictures. Whether this has any significant effect on symptoms, inflammation, or complications is unclear. Heaton et al suggested that a high-fiber, unrefined carbohydrate diet resulted in fewer and shorter hospitalizations. In a prospective follow-up study by Ritchie et al, however, these results were not able to be reproduced. Exclusion diets have also been suggested as a means of reducing relapse rates in patients with Crohn's disease. In a small, randomized, controlled trial of an exclusion diet versus an unrefined carbohydrate, fiber-rich diet, there were significantly fewer relapses among the patients treated with the exclusion diet at 6 months. These diets require intensive patient cooperation, but the potential side effects are minimal. Clearly, these findings need to be reproduced in large, prospective, randomized, controlled studies before widespread use can be advocated. A great deal of data exists on the use of nutritional supplementation in the treatment of inflammatory bowel disease, although little of it is in the form of large, randomized, controlled studies. Nutritional manipulation currently has a limited role in patients with ulcerative colitis; a much broader role exists in patients with Crohn's disease. The mechanisms by which nutritional therapy affects these diseases may include a combination of factors--decreased antigenic exposure, improved immune function, and provision of essential nutrients and calories needed for bowel regeneration.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 400 WORDS)},

There is an increasing body of immunologic and genetic evidence to suggest that Crohn's disease and ulcerative colitis are different diseases, but that once inflammation begins, many common secondary pathways of inflammation are initiated. The major recent conceptual advance is the observation that mice in whom different immunoregulatory pathways are disrupted develop an inflammatory bowel disease. In the case of interleukin-2 knockout mice, the lesion restricted to the colon, is virtually identical to ulcerative colitis in humans, and is initiated by the normal bacterial flora. Yet these mice possess anticolon antibodies, long-considered to be of pathologic significance in ulcerative colitis. These animal models will allow detailed longitudinal studies to be done, and less reliance will need to be placed on cross-sectional studies of chronically inflamed gut from patients.},

With modern parenteral nutrition regimens containing phosphorus, this problem has been virtually eliminated. Enteral nutrition solutions contain adequate phosphate for patients with normal phosphate stores. Hypophosphatemia has therefore rarely been reported in enteral nutrition. We describe two patients with protein-energy malnutrition who developed severe hypophosphatemia during tube feeding with phosphorus-containing formula diets. Chronic alcoholism and vitamin D deficiency due to malabsorption because of Crohn's disease were additional risk factors in these two patients. Patients with depleted phosphate stores and high metabolic demand have a higher daily requirement for phosphorus than is available in routine isotonic enteral formulas. This case report emphasizes the importance of monitoring serum phosphate concentration daily during the first week of refeeding.},

   abstract = {Limited data are available on the impact of enterally or parenterally supplied home nutritional support on quality of life. Data from national registries have been useful in identifying the outcome of different patient groups in terms of their functional capacity and rehabilitation status. Results in patients with inflammatory bowel disease are used as the 'gold standard' for this type of therapy. The annual cost of home parenteral nutrition can range from $US100 000 to $US150 000 per patient, depending on the frequency of feeding. Only one cost-utility analysis has been reported in the literature, based on a Canadian home parenteral nutrition programme which suggested that the estimated quality-adjusted survival of patients receiving this treatment is 4 times greater than if they had not been treated. There are many controversial areas associated with the use of home parenteral and enteral nutrition, including the treatment of patients with terminal malignant disease or severe dementia, and those infected with human immunodeficiency virus. To date, the clinical benefit of providing this type of nutritional support for these patient groups has not been clearly demonstrated. Prospective randomised controlled trials are necessary to evaluate the costs and benefits of this expensive high technology treatment.},

   abstract = {We report the results of a survey of the membership of the North American Society for Pediatric Gastroenterology and Nutrition designed to determine pediatric gastroenterologists' attitudes toward the use of immunosuppressive therapy for inflammatory bowel disease (IBD), and to assess how these medications are actually being used in the treatment of children with IBD. One hundred five physicians (27% of surveys) responded. Eighty-eight (84%) had prescribed 6-mercaptopurine and/or azathioprine for IBD, and 66 believed that they were effective. Only 12 had used cyclosporine and four methotrexate. All physicians who had used immunosuppressives in IBD had prescribed them for patients with Crohn's disease, but only 50% had prescribed them for ulcerative colitis. The predominant indications for use included intractable symptoms despite traditional medical therapy (92%) and for corticosteroid-sparing effects (86%). Potential toxicities of greatest concern included marrow and immune suppression and malignancy. The vast majority of responders were not certain what to recommend with respect to the use of immunosuppressive agents prior to and during pregnancy. A clinical database was compiled from 165 retrospective case reports submitted by 45 physicians (33 medical facilities). At the start of immunosuppressive therapy, patients were 15.3 +/- 4.0 yr of age, and 52% were Tanner IV-V. Eighty-one percent had Crohn's disease, 8% ulcerative colitis, and 11% indeterminant colitis. One hundred twenty-two were treated with 6-mercaptopurine, and 43 with azathioprine. Five also received cyclosporine concomitantly. Overall, 68% of patients treated with an immunosuppressive improved. Complications requiring discontinuation of immunosuppressive therapy occurred in 6% of patients. It appears that immunosuppressives are commonly used to treat children with IBD despite a paucity of data regarding their safety and efficacy in this age group. Controlled, prospective trials are warranted to better define the role of immunosuppressive therapy in pediatric IBD.},

   abstract = {To assess whether children with inflammatory bowel disease (IBD) develop permanent impairment of linear growth, we analyzed records from 48 young adults who had IBD during childhood or early adolescence (Tanner I-III; 11.8 +/- 2.4 years old at diagnosis). All were fully grown (Tanner V; 21.1 +/- 3.0 years) at last examination. Adult heights were predicted from data obtained at or shortly after the diagnosis of IBD by three methods: height for age percentile, the Bailey-Pinneau (BP), and Roche-Wainer-Thissen (RWT) methods. Predicted adult heights were then compared with the actual ultimate height of each subject. Permanent growth failure occurred in 19-35% of subjects, depending upon the method used to assess growth. Overall, 31% (15 of 48) of the subjects had deficits of adult height identified by two or more methods, including 14 of 38 (37%) of those with Crohn's disease but only one of 10 with ulcerative colitis. Age at diagnosis of IBD, age at last examination, age at cessation of linear growth, and site of IBD did not differ between impaired and normal growth groups. Duration of corticosteroid use was longer (p < 0.05) in growth-impaired subjects. In addition, although 60% of all subjects had periods of poor growth that put them in height-for-age percentiles two or more major growth channels below previous percentiles, only 19% remained at these levels upon achieving their final adult heights. Permanent impairment of linear growth leading to clinically meaningful deficits of ultimate adult height is common in patients with IBD in childhood or early adolescence. New therapeutic approaches are needed to address this problem.},

The entire experience includes 221 patients, with 73 patients < 21 years of age. Fifty-six consecutive surviving pediatric patients, all > 1 year after operation, have been studied with 100% follow-up evaluation for up to 17 years after operation. Fifty (89%) are leading normal lives with an acceptable stool frequency and complete continence. A number of postoperative complications have been encountered that are of particular concern to the pediatric gastroenterologist. The most distressing finding has been the subsequent diagnosis of Crohn's disease in most of the patients whose postoperative course was unsatisfactory. This underscores the need for a more accurate means of differentiating ulcerative colitis from Crohn's colitis before advising surgery.},

   abstract = {Anorexia nervosa (AN) and bulimia nervosa (BN) are potentially fatal eating disorders which primarily affect adolescent females. Differentiating eating disorders from primary gastrointestinal (GI) disease may be difficult. GI disorders are common in eating disorder patients, symptomatic complaints being seen in over half. Moreover, many GI diseases sometimes resemble eating disorders. Inflammatory bowel disease, acid peptic diseases, and intestinal motility disorders such as achalasia may mimic eating disorders. However, it is usually possible to distinguish these by applying the diagnostic criteria for eating disorders and by obtaining common biochemical tests. The primary features of AN are profound weight loss due to self starvation and body image distortion; BN is characterized by binge eating and self purging of ingested food by vomiting or laxative abuse. GI complications in eating disorders are common. Recurrent emesis in BN is associated with dental abnormalities, parotid enlargement, and electrolyte disturbances including metabolic alkalosis. Hyperamylasemia of salivary origin is regularly seen, but may lead do an erroneous diagnosis of pancreatitis. Despite the weight loss often seen in eating disorders, serum albumin, cholesterol, and carotene are usually normal. However, serum levels of trace metals such as zinc and copper often are depressed, and hypophosphatemia can occur during refeeding. Patients with eating disorders frequently have gastric emptying abnormalities, causing bloating, postprandial fullness, and vomiting. This usually improves with refeeding, but sometimes treatment with pro-motility agents such as metoclopromide is necessary. Knowledge of the GI manifestations of eating disorders, and a high index of suspicion for one condition masquerading as the other, are required for the correct diagnosis and management of these patients.},

   abstract = {BACKGROUND: Growth failure frequently complicates the clinical course of inflammatory bowel disease (IBD) in children. This study was designed to investigate the role of disease activity versus steroid therapy on growth faltering in this disorder. METHODS: We studied growth failure and its relationship to disease activity and steroid therapy in 69 children who have IBD by prospectively monitoring height for a maximum of 3 years. Disease activity and steroid use were recorded at entry into the study. RESULTS: The prevalence of growth failure was 24%, 23%, and 39% by height velocity, Z score, and height-for-age criteria, respectively; deficits were equally prevalent regardless of the stage of pubertal development. A delay in linear growth persisted throughout puberty and was not reversed after surgery. Patients who had Crohn's disease were twice as likely to have growth abnormalities than patients who had ulcerative colitis. We detected significant negative associations between linear growth and disease activity but not steroid therapy. CONCLUSIONS: In a unique group of children, growth failure is an early, "prepatterned" manifestation of IBD. The inflammatory process, rather than steroid use, has a predominant influence on the development of growth faltering.},

   abstract = {Malnutrition is frequently seen in patients with inflammatory bowel disease, and parenteral or enteral nutrition is considered essential in this patient group. However, many patients with Crohn's disease have difficulties in gaining weight in response to overfeeding, suggesting reduced energy retention. Substrate utilization and nutrient balances as well as changes in body composition were followed in 10 patients with Crohn's disease immediately in the course of remission on low-dose steroid treatment, during an eight-day period of continuous enteral nutrition at constant (protocol 1:1.5-fold basal energy expenditure) and increasing (protocol 2:0.5- to 2.0-fold basal energy expenditure) nutrient supply. Energy, substrate, and nitrogen balances all became positive in response to overfeeding. However, fat was predominantly oxidized at an infusion rate of 1.2 g/kg body wt/day, whereas carbohydrates and proteins were effectively stored. A positive energy balance was reached at an energy infusion rate exceeding 31 kcal/kg body wt/day and corresponding substrate supplies of 1.6, 1.7, and 1.1 g/kg body wt/day for carbohydrates, fat, and protein, respectively. Nitrogen balance normalized at a supply of 0.14 g/kg body wt/day, which also reduced myofibrillar protein breakdown. Considering the relative contributions made by these nutrients in the diets, an accumulation of carbohydrates and protein but a depletion in fat became evident from nutrient balances. In fact, body weight increased by 0.12 kg/day, which was explained by an increased extracellular (+0.18 kg/day) and body cell mass (+0.04 kg/day) at reduced fat mass (-0.10 kg/day). Concomitantly, plasma T3 and insulin secretion both increased, whereas sympathetic nervous system activity decreased with overfeeding. This is contrary to data observed in healthy subjects.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS)},

   abstract = {In the absence of a definitive cure for Crohn's disease and ulcerative colitis, the aim of therapy must be to induce and maintain clinical remission at acceptable cost to the patient in terms of adverse effects. Despite the differences in their pathogenesis, the first-line treatments for Crohn's disease and ulcerative colitis are still based upon combinations of amino-salicylic acid derivatives and corticosteroids, although the use of enteral nutrition regimes is becoming increasingly widespread in Crohn's disease. In this chapter we attempt to provide reasonably didactic guidance for the management of most cases of chronic inflammatory bowel disease. However, we have tried to go beyond this brief, motivated by the recent explosion in knowledge of inflammatory mechanisms, to suggest a rational approach to the choice of newer and less well tested therapeutic approaches in the affected child who is not responding effectively. The relative failure of cyclosporine therapy in Crohn's disease has been particularly disappointing in view of its ideal theoretical suitability. However, the encouraging early reports of treatment with anti-CD4 and anti-TNF alpha monoclonals suggest that the shift from broad spectrum immunomodulation to the targeting of critical components of the inflammatory cascade may yet field important dividends.},

T cell activation is considered to be central to Crohn's disease pathology, and as cyclosporin is a powerful inhibitor of T cell activation, and has been used in adult Crohn's disease with encouraging results, it may offer the prospect of remission if given early in the course of disease. Children with newly diagnosed Crohn's disease or those relapsing off treatment were therefore given cyclosporin or conventional treatment (enteral nutrition or corticosteroids) by random allocation. Evaluation was performed initially and at two months. Twenty four children were studied (10 on cyclosporin and 14 on conventional treatment; one child on cyclosporin withdrew). Significant clinical improvement occurred in the group on conventional treatment, but not in the cyclosporin group. Colonoscopic improvement was noted in 5/9 on cyclosporin and 8/14 on conventional treatment, but neither group produced a significant fall in median colonoscopic index. Histological improvement was seen in 7/8 on cyclosporin and 8/13 on conventional treatment, but cyclosporin was not significantly better. Cyclosporin produced improved clinical and histological appearance without matched improvement in blood disease indices. It was not better than conventional treatment, and simple oral administration is probably not suitable for newly diagnosed patients with Crohn's disease.},

   abstract = {Conditions which resulted in colonic preservation such as strangulated hernia, intestinal volvulus, and mesenteric infarction were once the main reasons for a major intestinal resection leading to the short bowel syndrome. Now Crohn's disease is the most common underlying diagnosis; such patients often have a jejunostomy. A measurement of the residual jejunal length from the duodenojejunal flexure makes possible predictions of patient outcome. Patients with a jejunostomy and less than 100 cm jejunum usually need long-term parenteral support, whereas 50 cm or more of jejunum usually suffices for adequate oral nutrition if the colon is preserved. While patients with and without a colon have problems with nutrient absorption, those with a jejunostomy also have problems of water, sodium and magnesium losses. Stomal losses may exceed oral intake and all such patients ('secretors') need parenteral supplements. Fluid and sodium losses can be reduced by octreotide, omeprazole or H2 blockers but not sufficiently to avoid the need for intravenous supplements. Colonic preservation increases the incidence of calcium oxalate renal stones (20%). Patients with and without a colon have a high prevalence of gallstones (40%). Clinically important intestinal adaptation occurs in those with a colon but not in those with a jejunostomy. Many surgical techniques, including small bowel transplantation, have been suggested to improve absorption, but as the quality of life of most patients with a short bowel is good with current treatments, they are not at present recommended.},

Therefore we investigated the valence of both proteins as markers of inflammation and/or malnutrition in 50 patients with active CD [Crohn's disease activity index (CDAI): median = 243; interquartile range = 191-288] and 70 patients with quiescent CD (CDAI: 62; 25-96). Thirty patients were malnourished, 18 with active [body weight: 84%; 79-88% IBW (ideal body weight)] and 12 with quiescent CD (87.5%; 81.5-88% IBW), and 90 patients were well nourished, 32 with active (96%; 93-112% IBW) and 58 with quiescent CD (104.5%; 96-116% IBW). Median values of PCHE activity and albumin concentration were within the normal range in both groups, in patients with active as well as quiescent CD. PCHE activity was decreased only in 24 patients (48%) with active, but also in 11 (15.7%) patients with quiescent disease. Albumin concentration was decreased in 12 patients (24%) with active and in one patient (1.4%) with quiescent disease. Comparing the two patient groups PCHE activity and albumin concentration were significantly lower in active than in quiescent CD [PCHE: 3.70 kU/l; 3.00-4.30 kU/l vs. 4.80 kU/l; 3.75-5.82 kU/l, p < 0.001; Albumin: 38.0 g/l; 35.1-39.9 g/l vs. 43.8 g/l; 40.8-46.3 g/l, p < 0.001]. Both proteins were significantly lower in malnourished than in well nourished patients, except albumin in patients with quiescent CD. Repeated measurements of PCHE and albumin in patients during and after active phases showed significant increases of both proteins.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS)},

To identify risk factors, the incidence of infection was examined in 41 current home parenteral nutrition patients, 30 with short-bowel syndrome (including 16 with inflammatory bowel disease and 11 with bowel infarction) and 11 with chronic obstructive disorders. Management, which was followed for a mean duration of 78.6 months (range, 1 to 15 1/2 years), was standardized by protocol. Ten patients never experienced infection during the average follow-up of 61 months (range, 14 to 174 months), whereas seven patients experienced frequent infections during the mean follow-up of 77 months (range, 24 to 180 months). Significant distinguishing features in the frequent-infection group were younger age (45 +/- 12 vs 66.9 +/- 14.3 years, p < .05), Crohn's disease (in five of seven vs zero of 10 subjects, p < .05), jejunostomies (in seven of seven vs one of 10 subjects, p < .0005), and central vein thrombosis (in five of seven vs zero of 10 subjects, p < .05). A greater proportion of the frequent-infection group had poor catheter-care technique and more were smokers. One hundred fifty septicemias were confirmed by blood culture, giving an average infection rate of one every 31 months, 52% caused by Gram-positive organisms (chiefly coagulase-negative staphylococci and Staphylococcus aureus), 30% caused by Gram-negative organisms, and 16% caused by fungus (chiefly Candida albicans).(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS)},

   abstract = {This study is a retrospective review of eight pediatric patients with multifocal intestinal Crohn's disease who underwent strictureplasty with or without concomitant bowel resection between January 1978 and April 1992. The patients ranged in age from 9.9 years to 18.5 years. Indications for surgery were partial intestinal obstruction (n = 6), failure of medial therapy or steroid dependence (n = 4), growth failure (n = 2), and enterocutaneous fistula (n = 2). Thirty-six strictureplasties were performed in the eight patients (median, 4.5 strictureplasties per patient; range, 1-12). Bowel resection was performed in six of the eight patients in areas where strictureplasty was not feasible. The mean length of resection was 40 cm (range, 15-82 cm). The only complication was intestinal hemorrhage, which was conservatively managed in two patients. The patients were followed for a mean of 19 months (range, 3-55 months). Five patients had a weight below the fifth percentile prior to surgery. Postoperatively, there was a weight gain in seven patients, including all five patients who were originally below the fifth percentile. A statistically significant weight gain was found when a paired t test analysis was applied to the entire group (p = 0.04). Five of six patients who were on steroid medication at the time of surgery were successfully weaned within 1.5-3 months (mean, 2.3 months) from the time of surgery. Seven of eight patients had relief of their intestinal symptoms. Strictureplasty with small-bowel resection, or perhaps strictureplasty alone, in pediatric patients with multifocal intestinal Crohn's disease can improve gastrointestinal symptoms, promote weight gain, and allow discontinuation of steroid medications.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS)},

Patients were chosen from children aged 7-16 years, who had UC or Crohn's diagnosed following review of colonic biopsies taken during colonoscopy. The patients reviewed had not received treatment for inflammatory bowel disease. Paraffin embedded colonic biopsies were sectioned, deparaffinized, and stained with mouse monoclonal IgG antibodies directed against human recombinant TNF-alpha and IL-1 beta. The colonic lamina propria of all biopsies from patients with UC or Crohn's colitis was expanded with a mixed mononuclear, polymorphonuclear, lymphocytic, and plasmacytic infiltrate. Mononuclear cells distributed throughout the interstitium, stained prominently for both TNF-alpha and IL-1 beta. Plasmacytes, polymorphonuclear leukocytes, small lymphocytes, and foamy macrophages did not stain for either TNF-alpha or IL-1 beta. Transmigrating mononuclear cells in crypt epithelium also stained brightly for both TNF-alpha and IL-1 beta.

   abstract = {It has been claimed that prolonged remissions of Crohn's disease can be achieved after enteral or parenteral nutrition, by identifying and excluding foods that exacerbate a patient's symptoms. The occurrence of food intolerances were assessed after induction of remission with elemental diet in 42 eligible patients to whom single foods were introduced over five days. Suspect foods were reinvestigated with open and if possible, double blind rechallenge. Fourteen patients (33%) dropped out of the study because of relapse of disease unrelated to food (n = 8) or because of difficulties in complying with the regimen (n = 6). Twenty (48%) of the patients identified food sensitivities whereas eight (19%) did not. Seventeen of the patients who identified food sensitivities had an open rechallenge with recurrence of symptoms in 10 (24% of total). Food sensitivity was confirmed in three patients on double blind challenge. There was no significant difference in the duration of remission between patients who did or did not identify food sensitivities. During the study three cases of intolerance to the formula diet, and one of severe salicylate sensitivity were encountered. In conclusion food sensitivities are evident after treatment of Crohn's disease with elemental diet but are variable, often do not persist, and are of insufficient importance to warrant putting all patients through elimination diets.},

   abstract = {UNLABELLED: The efficacy of clofazimine (Lamprene) was analysed retrospectively in twenty one patients with anoperineal lesions (APL) of Crohn's disease. Clofazimine is known for its antimycobacterial, antiinflammatory and immunomodifier properties. It is used with success in leprosy and certain dermatological disorders. A number of clinical and laboratory arguments suggest the probability of a role of mycobacteria in the etiology of Crohn's disease. METHODS: twenty one patients with ileo-colono-anal or bucco-colono-anal Crohn's disease formed the basis of this study. They had been treated in various ways for APL, without success. They had APL of varying degrees of advancement (primary lesions: seven cases; secondary lesions: ten cases; major advanced lesions: four cases). Treatment with Lamprene was given for three to 38 months (mean: 12 months), the mean cumulative dose being 40 grams (4 to 146). Other therapeutic measures were started simultaneously in twelve patients: medical in six cases, medico-surgical in four cases and surgical only in two cases. The aim of treatment in fourteen cases was to obtain the healing of ulcerated lesions and/or fistulas, in three patients to delay dilatation sessions and in four patients to avoid proctectomy in the short-term. RESULTS: ten patients showed no improvement while eleven were improved (with regression of primary lesions in ten cases). Taking combined treatment into consideration, the link between the result obtained and Lamprene was considered probable in five cases, possible in four cases and uncertain in one case. Lamprene was well tolerated in general. It was not possible to evaluate the efficacy of treatment regarding intestinal disease. CONCLUSION: the efficacy of Lamprene in ano-perineal lesions of Crohn's disease is possible and is worthy of evaluation in a controlled trial.},

Morphometric analysis was performed on routinely processed duodenal biopsies. Cell proliferation was evaluated by means of in vitro bromodeoxyuridine uptake. The results were compared with those obtained in five healthy controls. After parenteral nutrition, patients showed significantly lower villus height and crypt depth than those of controls and a normal bromodeoxyuridine labeling index. After 2 months of refeeding, villus and crypt returned to normal, and the labeling index was increased. After 12 months of oral refeeding, labeling index, villus height, and crypt depth were similar to those of controls. The patient with the short bowel showed a number of cells per unit length of villus and crypt significantly greater than those of the controls and of the patient who underwent shorter intestinal resection. In human duodenal mucosa, (1) hypoplasia develops after long-term total parenteral nutrition; (2) mucosal recovery occurs through an increased cell proliferation after oral refeeding; and (3) extensive small bowel resection determines the development of relative hyperplasia.},

The prevalence in this countries 3.2:100,000 and the characteristics of the disease are: a more benign course, better prognosis and infrequent involvement of the colon. The incidence of recurrence is 40.0% during a 5 year period and 65% during a 10 year period. Practically, every patient operated for Crohn's disease will be reoperated once during the first five postoperative years. The experience of the authors indicates that the situation in this country is considerably better. During the period ranging from 1980-1992, a total of 70 patients were operated for Crohn's disease. In this group of operated patients 24 (34.40%) had recurrent symptoms. Seven patients (10.0%) in the series, operated at an earlier date at this Institution, were reoperated for Crohn's disease. Another 8 patients (11.43%) were also reoperated for Crohn's disease in this series, but their initial operation had been done at a different Institution (palliative or inadequate prior surgery). Indications for reoperation did not differ from indications for the initial operation: existence of surgical complications. The most important factors in the surgical management of recurrence are: assessment of disease activity and progression and adequate preoperative and postoperative nutrition in order to improve the immune response, which is often impaired by previous surgery, disease activity and inadequate management. Correct operative strategy is crucial. The authors, in both initial and reoperations, perform limited resection of the small intestine, generous resection of the large intestine and stricturoplasty and divergent stomas on the small intestine.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS)},

   abstract = {We examined the patterns of trefoil peptide gene expression in the ulcer-associated cell lineage (UACL) and mucosa adjacent to Crohn's disease in humans and during gastrointestinal adaptation to enteral feeding in rats. In the UACL, human spasmolytic polypeptide (hSP) mRNA and peptide are present in the acinar and proximal duct cells, whereas pS2 mRNA and peptide are found in the distal duct cells and in the surface cells. In mucosa adjacent to UACL, pS2 mRNA and peptide are expressed ectopically by goblet cells and neuroendocrine cells. Intestinal crypts associated with the UACL showed marked neuroendocrine cell hyperplasia. Ultrastructural immunolocalization showed pS2 to be copackaged in the mucous cell and neuroendocrine granules. The copackaging of a secretory protein in both mucous and neuroendocrine granules, which have different functions, is unusual and indicates an important role for pS2 in the secretory process itself or as a ligand delivered to its receptor via multiple routes. We also cloned the newest trefoil peptide, intestinal trefoil factor (ITF), from human and rat intestinal mucosa. Using in situ hybridization we demonstrated its synthesis by normal rat intestinal goblet cells. RNAse protection analysis revealed that the level of mRNA for rat ITF in small and large intestine was affected by the process of enteral feeding. We conclude that trefoil peptides are widely distributed in the intestine in human inflammatory bowel disease and are of considerable potential functional importance.},

We have examined the sera of 41 children and adolescents with ulcerative colitis, 27 with Crohn's disease, and a control group for the presence of ANCA. Anti-neutrophil cytoplasmic antibodies were detected in the serum of 27 of 41 patients with ulcerative colitis (66%), five of 27 with Crohn's disease (19%), and in none of our control subjects or patients with functional abdominal pain. Overall, the presence of ANCA was 66% sensitive and 84% specific for a diagnosis of ulcerative colitis when compared to Crohn's disease. There was no relationship between a positive ANCA value and disease activity or other clinical indicators. We conclude that evaluation for the presence of ANCA may be a useful adjunct for the clinical assessment of patients with inflammatory bowel disease. The presence of ANCA in children and adolescents, however, will not definitively distinguish between patients with ulcerative colitis and Crohn's disease.},

   abstract = {Hypertriglyceridemia induced by short-term lipid infusions causes redistribution of neutral lipid components between endogenous lipoproteins and emulsion particles. To determine whether such redistribution occurs over a long-term infusion period and affects lipoprotein pattern, we studied seven patients with inflammatory bowel disease who received cyclic home parenteral nutrition for two consecutive periods of 3 months with two different lipid emulsions. During each period, they received in random order either an emulsion composed exclusively of soy-derived long-chain triglycerides (LCTs) or another emulsion containing an equal weight:weight mixture of long- and medium-chain triglycerides (MCTs/LCTs). Both emulsions contained 20 triglycerides (TGs) and 1.2 phospholipids. Lipids provided 50 of nonprotein energy. Blood samples were taken once a week, 1 hour before the end of infusion (during) and again after a 6- to 8-h lipid-free interval (baseline). During infusion, there was a moderate increase of plasma TGs and phospholipids and a slight decrease of plasma esterified cholesterol (CE) and free cholesterol. Most of the plasma TGs increase occurred in the very-low-density lipoprotein fraction (containing both emulsion particles and the endogenous very-low-density lipoprotein), but there was also an increase of TGs content in low-density lipoprotein (LDL) and high-density lipoprotein (HDL) that was more pronounced with MCTs/LCTs. Acquisition by exogenous particles of CE transferred from LDL and HDL was significant for the LCT emulsion only. Although no change was observed in plasma lipid concentration of baseline samples during 3 months of home parenteral nutrition, some modifications were observed in the composition of lipoprotein fractions demonstrating a redistribution of lipid components.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS)},

Energy and protein intakes were lower in patients with weight loss than in those with stable weight (P < 0.01). In the former group, food restrictions were more numerous (P < 0.01) and visual analog scales showed less hunger, decreased appetite, and fewer sensations of pleasure related to eating, as compared with the other group (P < 0.01). Food intake reduction was also related to depressive mood and medical advice. However, there was no difference between groups in fecal energy wasting and resting energy expenditure. Weight loss in Crohn's disease may be due to a decrease in food intake rather than to an increase in energy cost of the disease. Thus, focus of attention on the diet is crucial to prevent malnutrition.},

   abstract = {Crohn's disease is an inflammatory process commonly characterized by phases of flare-up. Weight loss and malnutrition are prominent features in the course of the disease, especially during acute episodes. It is therefore important to define energy needs. Curiously, resting energy expenditure (REE) has rarely been studied in Crohn's disease, and never in relation with the activity of the disease. We therefore determined REE together with body composition (fat free mass, FFM), Crohn's disease activity index (CDAI) and plasma acute phase proteins in 70 patients: during flare-up in 41 and during clinical remission (CDAI < 150) in 29. We found an increase in REE in patients with active disease (CDAI > 150), as compared with patients in remission, when REE was expressed as a function of FFM: 31.7 +/- 2.7 versus 29.4 +/- 3.3 kcal/kg FFM/day (P < 0.01). The mean REE/FFM was 8% higher during flare-up than during remission, and was correlated to both clinical (CDAI; P = 0.011) and biological inflammatory activity indices (C reactive protein, P = 0.018; orosomucoid, P = 0.024). In some patients, the REE was in the normal range, despite an increase in REE/FFM, because of a decrease in FFM due to hypermetabolism. In 8 patients treated successfully by total parenteral nutrition for a massive flare-up, REE/FFM was increased before TPN (36.6 +/- 3.0 kcal/kg/day), and decreased after 4 weeks of TPN (31.4 +/- 1.8 kcal/kg/day; P < 0.001), returning within normal values in 7 patients.},

The programme consisted of a detailed history, physical examination, a battery of laboratory tests, X-ray examination of the skeleton and osteodensitometry. Where, as a result, underlying disease or risk factors were suspected, further tests were performed. 98 patients (39%) were found by densitometric criteria to have preclinical, 156 (61%) manifest osteoporosis with one or more vertebral body fractures. There was no significant difference regarding bone density between the preclinical and manifest cases. 76 of the 254 (30%) patients had no detectable pathogenetic factors, i. e. their osteoporosis was classified as idiopathic (mean age 51 years), while as senile osteoporosis in 16 elderly patients (mean age 78 years). The remaining 162 patients had 286 risk factors within 24 different categories. Depending on duration, intensity and combination of these risk factors, the osteoporosis was classified as primary with few risk factors or as secondary osteoporosis of single or multiple aetiology (mean age of these three groups was 51, 56 and 52 years, respectively). The most important demonstrable risk factors were (in decreasing order of frequency) glucocorticoid treatment, alcohol consumption, smoking, hypogonadism, hypercalciuria, liver disease, Crohn's disease, low calcium nutrition, hyperthyroidism, physical inactivity, stomach operation and plasmacytoma.--This study indicates that if there is evidence of significant risk factors detailed bone densitometry should be performed so that any necessary treatment can be initiated early. If there is known osteoporosis, staging and exact analysis of risk factors is a precondition for any cause-oriented treatment.},

This study compared calculation of fat-free mass (FFM) by five methods to determine whether the currently used equations for total body water (TBW) as assessed by BIA were applicable to 19 malnourished patients with Crohn's disease. When compared with TBW assessed by H2(18)O dilution, BIA was higher by 5.9 +/- 1.1% (P < 0.005). A stepwise-multiple-regression equation was derived to validate BIA: TBW (kg) = 0.25 (ht2/resistance) + 0.29 (wt) + 3.63 (r = 0.97, SEE = 0.28). Comparison of the hydration of FFM (TBW by 18O dilution/FFM) between methods showed that total body potassium (TBK) gave a significantly higher value when compared with the reference method of body protein, mineral, and 18O analysis. Dual-energy x-ray absorptiometry (DXA) provided a value for TBW/FFM in close agreement with the reference method. We conclude that BIA overestimates TBW, and TBK underestimates FFM in malnourished patients. DXA provides an accurate measurement of body fat in malnutrition.},

This study examined the hypothesis that improvement occurs because of the presence of amino acids or the low fat content, or both. A randomised, controlled trial was undertaken in 40 patients with active Crohn's disease to evaluate clinical and nutritional outcomes after an amino acid based diet containing 3% fat was given by a feeding tube compared with a peptide based diet containing 33% fat. After three weeks' treatment, clinical remission occurred in 84% of patients who were given the amino acid diet and 75% of patients who received the peptide diet (p = 0.38). Plasma linoleic acid concentration was reduced after the amino acid but not the peptide diet. An increase in total body nitrogen was associated with the magnitude of nutritional depletion before treatment and at six months' follow up, only patients who showed gains in total body nitrogen after enteral nutrition had a sustained clinical remission. This study shows that peptide based high fat diets are as effective as amino acid low fat diets for achieving clinical remission in active Crohn's disease. Improved total body protein stores but not essential fatty acid depletion may be an important indicator of a sustained remission.},

Ten children were treated by enteral feeding (Nutrison Standard, Nutricia), and nine received corticosteroids. Both treatment regimens lasted 11 weeks. The activity of Crohn's disease was similar in both groups before the commencement of the treatment. Clinical symptoms and signs, as judged by the pediatric Crohn's disease activity index and measurements relating to inflammatory activity (erythrocyte sedimentation rate, C-reactive protein, blood leukocyte and platelet count, and serum immunoglobulins G and A) and to nutritional status (concentrations of serum albumin, prealbumin, hemoglobin) improved rapidly and significantly with as little as 2 weeks' treatment in both treatment groups. In both groups, there was one relapse within 8 weeks after discontinuation of treatment, and one patient in both groups was operated on during the treatment period. During the routine follow-up after the trial (0.3-2.5 years; mean, 1.3 years) five of the corticosteroid group experienced a clinical relapse, whereas only one from the enteral feeding group relapsed. No side effects of enteral feeding were seen. Enteral feeding with a whole protein-based formula proved to be as effective as high-dose corticosteroid in the treatment of the acute phase of Crohn's disease and may prove to be the treatment of choice in pediatric patients with acute Crohn's disease.},

Forty-one children were found to have Crohn's disease and 47, ulcerative colitis. Upper gastrointestinal endoscopy revealed pathology in 32 (80%) cases of Crohn's disease, esophagitis in 16, and esophageal ulcer in two, nonspecific gastritis in 22, duodenitis or duodenal ulcer in 18, and Helicobacter pylori infection in two cases. Granulomas were detected in 10 patients in the upper gastrointestinal tract: one esophageal, eight gastric, and three duodenal. Of the ulcerative colitis patients, seven had esophagitis, one had esophageal ulcer, 17 had nonspecific gastritis, two had gastric ulcers, two had duodenal ulcers, and five had H. pylori infection; altogether 30 (75%) yielded pathological findings. Radiological studies using barium meal revealed pathology in only eight of all inflammatory bowel disease cases. Symptoms at admission were not conclusive for definite diagnosis because 63% of patients with Crohn's disease had signs of colitis (such as diarrhea, bloody diarrhea) compared to 94% of ulcerative colitis patients. Upper gastrointestinal endoscopy may be used to achieve a specific diagnosis, thus being helpful when planning treatment. Also a considerable incidence of nonspecific gastritis, duodenitis, and esophagitis with or without concomitant H. pylori infection may be anticipated in children suffering from both ulcerative colitis and Crohn's disease.},

   abstract = {Tissue and plasma concentrations of several cytokines are increased in patients with inflammatory bowel disease (IBD). Platelets play an important role in inflammation and circulate in an activated state in patients with IBD. This study assesses the expression of IL-8 and IL-1 receptors on the surface of platelets from patients with IBD using phycoerythrin (PE)-labelled recombinant human rhIL-1 beta and rhIL-8 and flow cytometry. The percentage IL-1R expressing platelets (median and interquartile range IQR) in the IBD group was 8.7% (5.5-18.2) compared to 4.2% (2.3-6.1) in controls (P = 0.02). The percentage IL-8R expressing platelets in the IBD group was 22.5% (16.5-27.9) and 9.2% (4.3-9.6) in controls (P < 0.001). Furthermore, platelet IL-1R expression in patients with IBD was inversely related to the total daily dose of steroids (r = 0.71, P < 0.01 linear regression analysis). Finally, platelet rich plasma from healthy controls was stimulated with rhIL-1 beta and rhIL-8 and assessed for activation dependent expression of platelet aGPIIb/IIIa and CD62 (p-selectin, GMP-140). IL-1 beta and IL-8 in vitro significantly and specifically activated the platelets. The surface membrane of platelets is able to express functional IL-1R and IL-8R, the expression of which is significantly increased in IBD. Interleukin-1 beta and IL-8 modulate platelet activation in vitro indicating a target role for platelet function in inflammation.},

   abstract = {BACKGROUND: Patients who have undergone ileal resection are at risk for developing magnesium depletion/deficiency because of poor absorption and decreased intake as well as increased endogenous losses. Magnesium repletion is difficult to accomplish because of the cathartic action of most oral magnesium supplements at therapeutic doses. The results of in vitro and in situ studies show that magnesium diglycinate (chelate) represents a highly available form of magnesium that is absorbed in part as an intact dipeptide in the proximal small intestine. METHODS: We conducted a double-blind, randomized crossover trial with 12 patients who had ileal resections in order to compare the bioavailability of a 100-mg dose of 26Mg-labeled chelate with MgO in this patient population. RESULTS: For the patient group as a whole, 26Mg absorption was low but was not different for the two supplements (23.5% vs 22.8% for magnesium chelate and MgO, respectively). However, 26Mg absorption was substantially greater from the chelate (23.5% vs 11.8%; p < .05) in the four patients who showed the greatest impairment of magnesium absorption with MgO and was better tolerated by all patients. Peak isotope enrichment also occurred significantly earlier after 26Mg chelate than after 26MgO ingestion (mean difference 3.2 +/- 1.3 hours; p < .05), and the area under the enrichment vs time curve was greater after chelate ingestion (p < .05). CONCLUSIONS: Data from this study support the suggestion that some portion of magnesium diglycinate is absorbed intact, probably via a dipeptide transport pathway. Magnesium diglycinate may be a good alternative to commonly used magnesium supplements in patients with intestinal resection.},

In 31 patients endoscopic and histologic activity was compared with scan activity index. In the 98 patients with a positive scan, the extent of Crohn's disease, assessed by scintigraphy, was compared with that evaluated by small bowel x ray or colonoscopy with biopsies. In 48 patients, Crohn's disease activity index, activity index, simple index, erythrocyte sedimentation rate, C-reactive protein were correlated with the scan results. In 16 patients the five parameters and scan were repeated after treatment with methyl-prednisolone (10 cases), enteral nutrition (3), and 5-acetylsalicylic acid (3). The results showed that 99mTc-HMPAO granulocyte scan had a 95% sensitivity and 100% specificity to detect active inflammation; it correctly showed an abscess or a fistula in all the 24 cases found. The correlation between histological inflammatory activity and scan activity index was highly significant (r = 0.85; p < 0.01), less significant (r = 0.65; p < 0.01) between endoscopy and scan activity index. The evaluation for the extent of Crohn's disease by scan was completely correct in the small bowel (100%) and 93% correct in the large bowel. No correlation was seen between the three clinical activity parameters and scanning; in more than 80% of the cases in remission on the basis of a clinical or laboratory index, scintigraphy remained positive. Medical treatment was effective on the clinical indices but not on the active inflammation in the ileum, whereas it led to a negative scan in 5/11 cases in the large intestine. Scintigraphy with 99mTc-HMPAO granulocyte plays an important part in Crohn's disease for the diagnosis of complications, for activity and assessment of the extent, and for the treatment results evaluation.},

The majority (12 patients) were men and the median age was 47 (range 22-67) years. Intraabdominal infection following surgery for Crohn's disease (four patients) and necrotizing pancreatitis (six) was the most common primary condition requiring laparostomy. A total of 23 reconstructive operations were carried out on the 18 patients a median of 6 (range 1-18) months after laparostomy. The indication for surgery was for closure and/or resection of an enteric fistula in 13 patients. The site of the fistula included three gastric, two duodenal, 11 small bowel and seven colonic. A further four patients required operation for closure or refashioning of a stoma. Five patients subsequently required a second laparotomy: two for elective restoration of bowel continuity, two for recurrent fistula and one for an acute abdomen. After reconstructive surgery following laparostomy 16 patients were discharged home alive and well, one requiring home parenteral nutrition for short bowel syndrome. In contrast, the two oldest patients in the series died from multiple organ failure immediately after initial reconstructive surgery. Both had pre-existing medical problems and in neither was there evidence of further intra-abdominal infection after reconstruction.},

   abstract = {The aetiology of ulcerative colitis and Crohn's disease remains unknown. While this remains so, treatment must be directed towards pathogenetic mechanisms. Corticosteroids, sulphasalazine and the new salicylates, the immunosuppressants azathioprine, 6-MP and, more recently, cyclosporin and metronidazole have become the accepted and standard forms of treatment. The importance of maintaining nutritional status is often overlooked but must be considered in every patient. Recognition of the occurrence of disease in all age groups, and in particular in children and adolescents, is also important, as is an appreciation of the special problems involved. The possibility of surgery at some stage of the disease should be raised with the patient. As the pathogenetic mechanisms of inflammatory bowel disease are further elucidated, new forms of treatment will be developed. This is already happening, with studies looking at such agents as immunoglobulin G, eicosapentaenoic acid and a new specific inhibitor of 5-lipoxygenase. These offer hope of more potent drugs with low side-effect profiles that may complement or replace the currently available agents used in the management of inflammatory bowel disease.},

   abstract = {The overall impression gained from the experience of the Departments of Paediatric Gastroenterology and Surgery attached to St Bartholomew's Hospital are the enormous benefits that surgery has to confer on the large percentage of children with both Crohn's disease and idiopathic proctocolitis who require it. The surgical procedures described in this chapter have been accompanied by a remarkably low complication rate, dispelling the impression that morbidity in such cases would be high. This must in large measure be due to the fact that the children who come to surgery are in as good a state of nutrition as can be achieved by means of the various forms of enteral and parenteral feeding now available. Anxiety about healing of anastomoses and the development of fistulas after surgery for example, has not been a feature of the surgical care of these patients. The principal benefit of surgery has been a clear demonstration of an improvement in growth velocity in both Crohn's disease and idiopathic proctocolitis patients provided always that surgery is correctly timed. It is the author's experience that maximum benefit is achieved if the bulk of the diseased bowel can be removed. Plainly relief of symptoms such as abdominal pain and diarrhoea has also been rewarding. In many instances second procedures such as restorative proctectomy in idiopathic proctocolitis can be timed to fit in with educational commitments. In Crohn's disease the likelihood of recurrence in adult life is high but these patients are in a fit state to cope with further therapy including surgery should the need arise. From the management point of view the close cooperation between physicians and surgeons at all stages has been crucial, firstly to achieve smooth preparation prior to surgery and satisfactory after care. But of even more importance in the assessment of Crohn's disease is the presence of all clinicians involved in the case in the operating theatre so that the surgical options are fully assessed. This united approach avoids any unnecessary anxiety when, as inevitably happens, recurrence of symptoms due to relapse occurs. The involvement of patients of whatever age, and parents in all the decision making processes from the time of diagnosis has been vital. Early discussion about stomas involving members of the Stomatherapy Department has been invaluable. One final important aspect of the management of these patients is the seamless hand-over of care to an adult combined medical and surgical clinic at an appropriate time, usually at the age of 17 years.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 400 WORDS)},

The sole administration of total parenteral or enteral nutrition led in each case to a significant reduction of secretion from the fistulas, and in two cases to their complete closing. Apart from this, the nutritional status of the patients improved. The administration of Somatostatin i.v. in the form of the preparation Stilamin led to a further reduction of secretion from the fistulae. Complete closing of the fistulae due to a combination of total parenteral nutrition (TPN) or total enteral nutrition (TEN) and Stilamin, was achieved in only 2 patients, but the combination use of tissue sealant Histoacryle with the treatment resulted in a closure of the fistulas in a further 2 patients. Altogether the application of this treatment resulted in closing 6 fistulas (37.5%). The authors consider that the above mentioned methods can open new prospectives, but this requires further experience.},

Although the potential advantages of preserving intestinal length are obvious, the optimal clinical setting for performing strictureplasty remains to be determined. PATIENTS: Of 244 patients who underwent abdominal exploration for complications of Crohn's disease between Jan. 1, 1985, and Jan. 1, 1991, at the Mayo Clinic, 35 had a total of 71 strictureplasties. Concomitant resection of bowel with active disease was performed in 67% of the procedures. RESULTS: In this series, no perioperative deaths occurred, and no anastomotic leaks, enteric fistulas, or intra-abdominal abscesses were noted during a 3-year follow-up. The overall perioperative complication rate was 14%. Postoperatively, 33 of the 35 patients were able to resume enteral nutrition and discontinue medical treatments. The symptomatic recurrence rate at 3 years was 20%; six patients have required reoperation. CONCLUSION: These findings support the use of strictureplasty for isolated, quiescent, stenotic bowel lesions associated with Crohn's disease.},

At the time of inclusion the patients had a significantly reduced BMC of lumbar spine and femoral neck compared to normals (Z-scores = -3.35 +/- 3.49, p < 0.05 and Z-score = -2.23 +/- 2.11, p < 0.05). During HPN the Z-score of lumbar spine BMC decreased in 8 patients and increased slightly or was unchanged in 7 patients. The mean Z-score of BMC of lumbar spine declined by 1.46 +/- 2.48 (p < 0.05) and the Z-score of femoral neck BMC declined by 0.831 +/- 1.14 (p < 0.05). This corresponds to a yearly decrease of lumbar spine BMC of 4%. There was no correlation between the decline in BMC during the study and the period of length the patients were on HPN. We conclude that patients on HPN have a low bone mineral density and that the bone loss continues during prolonged HPN.},

   abstract = {A combined body scan technique for measuring total energy expenditure (TEE) from energy intake and changes in energy stores is presented. The TEE of 13 patients with Crohn's disease who required nutrition support over a 14-day period was measured. They had a mean TEE of 33 kcal/kg per day. The components of the TEE in these 13 patients were also measured. Seventy percent of the TEE was made up by resting metabolic expenditure, 10% by diet-induced thermogenesis, and the remaining 20% by activity energy expenditure. These patients had a mean activity energy expenditure of 369 kcal/day. The diet-induced thermogenesis was a mean 12.6% increase on the resting metabolic expenditure. Each percent increase was caused by a mean of 210 kcal of energy in either the intravenous nutrition or the enteral nutrition. There was no difference in diet-induced thermogenesis between those having enteral nutrition and those receiving intravenous nutrition. Decreased activity was significantly correlated with increased activity of the disease (r = .7, p < .01). This confirms the belief that patients with Crohn's disease require no more energy (ie, 33 kcal/kg per day) than other patients. If the resting metabolic expenditure is increased through illness, then the activity energy expenditure decreases. The combined in vivo neutron activation-dual energy x-ray absorptiometry technique has allowed for the first time measurements in ward patients with Crohn's disease. The measurements confirm that TEE is not raised and that 30 to 35 kcal/kg per day is sufficient to achieve energy balance in such patients.},

We therefore examined the effects of continuous enteral nutrition on gallbladder motility and cholecystokinin (CCK) release in six patients. METHODS: Gallbladder volume was measured ultrasonographically for 12 h on days 1 (start), 8, 22 (6-h interruption of enteral feeding), 36, and 43 (end) of enteral feeding. Plasma CCK was assessed at several time points. RESULTS: Initial fasting gallbladder volume was 19.3 +/- 4.5 (mean +/- SEM) ml, which decreased to 4.9 +/- 3.6 ml after start of feeding. CCK increased from 1.5 +/- 0.3 to 3.9 +/- 1.1 pmol/l. On days 8 and 36 the gallbladder was almost completely contracted, and CCK increased to 7.5 +/- 2.7 and 8.3 +/- 2.6 pmol/l, respectively. On days 22 and 43 gallbladder volume increased, and CCK decreased rapidly to fasting concentrations after interruption of feeding. CONCLUSIONS: During continuous enteral nutrition the gallbladder is completely contracted, and CCK concentrations remain elevated. It is therefore unlikely that long-term enteral nutrition contributes to the increased prevalence of gallstones in patients with Crohn's disease.},

In Crohn's disease, plasma selenium concentrations were rarely low, but glutathione peroxidase activity was increased in the plasma and reduced in the red cells. Selenium concentration and glutathione peroxidase activity increased with steroid treatment but decreased with a selenium-deficient elemental diet. Plasma selenium concentration was normal in children with cystic fibrosis but very low in severely malnourished children with biliary atresia and intractable diarrhoea. Selenium concentration and glutathione peroxidase activity should be monitored in children with severe malnutrition or requiring prolonged nutritional support. Supplementation is recommended in cases of severe selenium depletion.},

The mean energy intake was 1,764 KJ/day (420 kcal/day) lower in patients during relapse than controls (p < 0.05). All 24 children entered a randomised controlled trial of high-dose steroids compared to an elemental diet. The elemental diet was well tolerated orally in most cases; only one patient required nasogastric administration. There was a similar improvement in disease activity and duration of remission in both groups regardless of the site of disease. Subsequent growth velocity was significantly better in the group treated with the elemental diet despite a greater and more sustained increase in energy intake in the group treated with steroids. Reintroduction of specific foods in the elemental diet group initially caused symptoms in three children but were subsequently tolerated. During remission, there was no significant difference in energy intake, but vegetables were consumed significantly less frequently (p < 0.01) and confectionery significantly more frequently (p < 0.05) when patients were compared with their own siblings.},

The average duration of symptoms prior to presentation was 25 months (range 4 days-4 years). The chief clinical features included abdominal pain in 15 patients, diarrhea in 12, fever in 7, hematochezia in 6, weight loss in 8 and arthralgia in 2 patients. Radiological signs of Crohn's disease involving the terminal ileum and/or the small bowel were seen in 4 of 10 cases. Four cases showed nonspecific inflammation with chronic inflammatory cells and granulomas on bowel and lymph node biopsies. A satisfactory response to therapy with steroids was seen in all cases. Sixteen recurrences were seen in 11 patients; all these recurrences were mild and seen in patients with poor compliance to medication. This study suggests that Crohn's disease is not an uncommon entity in Saudi Arabia. Most cases show satisfactory response to therapy with steroids; however prolonged follow-up is required.},

   abstract = {Nutrition of colonic epithelial cells (colonocytes) is maintained by luminal short-chain fatty acids (SCFAs), chiefly by n-butyrate. The importance of SCFAs for the maintenance of colonic epithelium has been demonstrated in animal models of colitis produced by rectal instillation of an inhibitor of SCFA oxidation and in patients with diversion colitis in whom a segment of colonic epithelium was deprived of contact with luminal SCFAs. We measured fecal SCFAs and lactate in children with ulcerative colitis (UC; n = 17) and with Crohn's disease with ileocolonic involvement (CD; n = 22) and age-matched controls (n = 12) by a vacuum-distillation, gas chromatographic method. Fecal SCFA concentrations were correlated with scores of clinical disease activity. Patients with UC and CD had a decrease in the fecal concentration of acetate (p < 0.05) and an increase in n-butyrate (p < 0.01) compared with controls. No significant changes in fecal lactate were seen. A comparison of inactive- or mild-UC patients with moderate or severe-UC patients yielded major differences in SCFA concentrations with n-butyrate increased in inactive and mild UC well above control values and total SCFA and acetate decreased in moderate and severe UC below control levels. Raised concentrations of fecal n-butyrate may reflect impaired utilization of this SCFA in the colon of patients with mild UC and Crohn's disease with colonic involvement. Whether this defect is primary or secondary to inhibitors in the colonic lumen, due to impaired transport of n-butyrate into the cell or defective metabolism within the cell, or specific to inflammatory bowel disease remains to be explored.},

The important differences between semi-elemental diet and elemental diet in composition are the form of nitrogen and fat content. Forty patients with active Crohn's disease were randomized to receive for 6 weeks either elemental diet (n = 21) which is composed of amino acid based with low fat content or semi-elemental diet (n = 19) which is oligopeptide-based and has higher fat content. Both groups showed similar improvement in Dutch-AI, Crohn's disease activity index (CDAI), erythrocyte sedimentation rate, C-reactive protein, serum albumin, body mass index and radiographic findings of bowel lesion. The present study suggests that semi-elemental diet is equal to elemental diet for treating active Crohn's disease. We conclude the compositional differences between the two diets did not affect the short-term effect of enteral nutritional therapy for active Crohn's disease.},

The authors believe this to be caused of such syndrome, that in the case in question is demonstrated before the normal period described in the literature to be caused by both increased request related to TPN and a greater loss or less absorption due to intestinal phlogosis. The case described has been noted in a general surgery division in a young patient suffering from Crohn's disease for many years in treatment with medical therapy and now complicated by perianal abscess following burrowing on the outside subjected and therefore in treatment with artificial parenteral nutrition pre and post operative. Such pathology to be due when to begin a symptomatology characterized by consciousness alteration, diarrhoea, vesicular squamous cutaneous lesions around orifices, often infected by bacteria and mycosis in patients in treatment nutritional artificial continued for digestive apparatus diseases. The knowledge of this syndrome and its diagnosis lead, through integrative therapy, to its resolution in a short time. The authors describe the course of a clinical case occurred to then and ended with the patient's recovery. They underline the risks of ignoring this pathology.},

Genetic predisposition to inflammatory bowel diseases and genetic influence on immune regulation resulted in the clinical evaluation of potential serologic markers. In adults the presence of anti-neutrophil cytoplasmic antibody (ANCA) in serum identifies patients with ulcerative colitis. In this study we demonstrated that high levels of ANCA are present in 83% of children and adolescents with ulcerative colitis. Furthermore, the majority of patients with ulcerative colitis had a perinuclear pattern of these antibodies by indirect immunofluorescence. The combination of a positive ANCA and perinuclear indirect immunofluorescence pattern was 97% specific for ulcerative colitis. We conclude that determination of ANCA is a sensitive and specific clinical test for identification of children and adolescents with ulcerative colitis.},

   abstract = {Adults with inflammatory bowel disease from North Carolina were questioned during 1986 and 1987 to assess risk due to a variety of childhood infections and treatments with antibiotics. Responses were compared with those of neighbor controls. Persons with Crohn's disease were more likely to report an increased frequency of childhood infections in general (odds ratio 4.67, 95% CI 2.65-8.23) and pharyngitis specifically (odds ratio 2.14, 95% CI 1.30-3.51). This was validated by an increased frequency of tonsillectomy (odds ratio 1.53, 95% CI 1.07-2.20). Crohn's cases were more likely to report frequent treatment with antibiotics for both otitis (odds ratio 2.07, 95% CI 1.03-4.14) and pharyngitis (odds ratio 2.14, 95% CI 1.20-3.84). Although Crohn's cases were more likely to report frequent exposure to penicillin (odds ratio 1.81, 95% CI 0.98-3.31), there did not appear to be excess risk conferred by penicillin after controlling for frequency of infections. Persons with ulcerative colitis also reported an excess of infections generally (odds ratio 2.37, 95% CI 1.19-4.71), but not an excess of specific infections or treatments with antibiotics. Persons who reported an increased frequency of infections tended to have an earlier onset of Crohn's disease (P < 0.0001) and ulcerative colitis (P = 0.04). Finally, it was noted that urban living in childhood increased the risk for Crohn's disease. We conclude that childhood infections may be a risk factor for Crohn's disease and may presage the early onset of disease.},
