   abstract = {Five children with ulcerative colitis for whom surgery was recommended were treated with cyclosporine. The five had received corticosteroids for 1-24 months. The group included two patients with acute-onset ulcerative colitis and three with acute exacerbations of intractable corticosteroid-dependent chronic ulcerative colitis. The average age at initiation of cyclosporine therapy was 13.8 years (range, 11.5-16); all five patients were boys. Cyclosporine was initiated in the hospital by continuous i.v. infusion. Trough levels of 400-600 ng/dl (measured by radioimmunoassay) were achieved, at which point oral cyclosporine was given and oral dosage was adjusted to similar levels. Significant hypertension requiring medical attention was seen in one patient. Of the two recently diagnosed acute cases, one failed to respond and required subtotal colectomy after 2 weeks of treatment, and the other, despite an initial response, had a subtotal colectomy 10 months later. Of the three corticosteroid-dependent children, none was able to be weaned from corticosteroids and all underwent subtotal colectomy. Our experience emphasizes that the appropriate role of cyclosporine as therapy for children with ulcerative colitis is yet to be determined. Cyclosporine was not effective as an alternative to surgery in our patients.},

We measured urinary growth hormone concentrations in 36 children with chronic inflammatory bowel disease and 51 normal controls. The median urinary concentration of growth hormone in the stunted children with chronic inflammatory bowel disease was 15.8 ng/g creatinine (range 4.3-32.6), compared with 11.7 ng/g creatinine (range 4.1-35.9) in those with normal growth. The difference was statistically not significant (p = 0.15). Moreover, there was no significant difference between the patients and the control group. One stunted patient had a urinary growth hormone (UGH) concentration below the normal range, whereas four patients with normal height were also below the normal range. Four of these five patients (80%) were on corticosteroid treatment at the time of urinary collection, whereas only 26% of the patients with normal UGH were also on corticosteroid treatment. We conclude that growth retardation in children with chronic inflammatory bowel disease is probably not related to growth hormone deficiency but must involve other mechanisms.},

   abstract = {BACKGROUND/AIMS: Cytokines are thought to be important in mediating tissue damage in inflammatory bowel disease (IBD). Many of the in vivo activities of tumor necrosis factor alpha (TNF-alpha) match the changes found in IBD, but its importance is controversial. METHODS: A sensitive, reverse hemolytic plaque assay was used to determine the frequency of TNF-alpha secreting cells isolated from mucosal biopsy specimens of children with Crohn's disease or ulcerative colitis (UC) and non-IBD controls before and after medical treatment. RESULTS: Frequency of TNF-alpha secreting cells was significantly increased in biopsy specimens from children with mild, nonspecific inflammation compared with those with histologically normal intestine. Frequency did not increase in UC compared with children with nonspecific inflammation but was significantly greater in Crohn's disease than in UC. After treatment, the frequency of TNF-alpha secreting cells was reduced in patients receiving cyclosporin A, not reduced in patients with steroids or enteral nutrition, and not changed with treatment in UC. CONCLUSIONS: TNF-alpha secreting cells are increased in the mucosa of inflamed intestine, regardless of pathogenesis. In patients with IBD, higher levels are seen in Crohn's disease than in UC, probably reflecting the extensive T-cell activation in Crohn's disease. No relation existed between histological healing and the frequency of TNF-alpha-secreting cells.},

The subjects, aged between 14 and 31 years of age, were assessed post-operatively for their physical health status. In assessing physiological adaptation in these subjects four basic needs were the foci: nutrition, elimination, activity and rest, and protection. Adaptation problems related to nutrition, elimination, activity/rest and protection were found in four, 17, 17 and three subjects respectively. Nine out of 30 had pain that influenced their daily life. Six out of 30 subjects had no adaptation problems at all. Nineteen subjects found their health to be 'excellent' or 'good' despite the adaptation problems reported.},

The aim of our study has been focused on serum IgG subclasses in Crohn's disease with resected bowel (11 patients) and without previous surgery for Crohn's disease (12 patients). All patients were in active stage of the disease on total parenteral nutrition. Serum IgG subclasses were estimated by means of radial immunodiffusion. There was no significant differences between in IgG subclasses in Crohn's disease with and without bowel resection. IgG2 over 4.5 g/l was found only in 2/12 with resected bowel and 1/11 without previous surgery for Crohn's disease. Surprisingly, IgG1/IgG2 ratio below 1.5 was found only in 5/23 persons. In 3/23 patients IgG1 was over 10.5 g/l although there was no doubt about the diagnosis of Crohn's disease. IgG subclasses failed to help in confirmation of the diagnosis of Crohn's disease. Serum IgG subclasses alterations probably are not influenced by bowel resection and/or nutritional status.},

The overall prevalence of H pylori seropositivity in the IBD patients was 22%, which was significantly less than that of 52% in the controls (p < 0.002). There was no difference in prevalence between ulcerative colitis and Crohn's patients. The low seropositivity in the IBD patients resulted from a very low prevalence of 10% in those currently receiving sulphasalazine (n = 40) and similarly low prevalence of 7% in those previously receiving sulphasalazine (n = 30). In those receiving olsalazine or mesalazine and who had never had sulphasalazine, the prevalence of seropositivity was 45%. Further studies using 14C urea breath test and microscopy of antral biopsy specimens confirmed that the negative serology in patients receiving sulphasalazine resulted from absence of the infection rather than absence of humoral immune response to it. In six control patients with H pylori infection, a two week course of sulphasalazine (500 mg four times daily) only caused slight suppression of the 14C urea breath test. In vitro studies failed to show any direct antibacterial effect of sulphasalazine on H pylori. These findings indicate that longterm treatment with sulphasalazine leads to eradication of H pylori infection and that this does not result from a direct antibacterial effect. It may be caused by the drug treating the gastritis and thereby depriving the bacterium of essential nutrients exuded by the inflamed mucosa.},

Twenty-eight children received 30 mg/kg/day of olsalazine (maximum, 2 g/day) and 28 received 60 mg/kg/day of sulfasalazine (maximum, 4 g/day). Side effects were frequent in both groups. Eleven of 28 patients (39%) on olsalazine reported headache, nausea, vomiting, rash, pruritus, increased diarrhea, and/or fever. Thirteen of 28 on sulfasalazine (46%) reported similar side effects and/or neutropenia, and four patients had the drug stopped because of an adverse reaction. After 3 months, 11 of 28 (39%) on olsalazine were asymptomatic or clinically improved, compared to 22 of 28 (79%) on sulfasalazine (p = 0.006). In addition, 10 of 28 patients on olsalazine versus one on sulfasalazine required prednisone because of lack of response or worsening of colitis (p = 0.005). The dose of olsalazine used in this clinical trial was thought to be equivalent to a standard dose of sulfasalazine, but fewer patients on olsalazine improved and a greater number had progression of symptoms when compared to sulfasalazine. Although side effects were slightly less frequent for olsalazine, the number of patients was too small to detect a clinically significant difference.},

   abstract = {Previous studies have shown that butyrate is an important energy source for the distal colon, and that its metabolism may be defective in ulcerative colitis (UC). A similar metabolic defect in the ileum might account for the occurrence of 'pouchitis' in UC patients after colectomy. A method has been developed that allows the measurement of metabolism in ileocolonoscopic biopsy specimens, and this has been used to assess butyrate and glutamine metabolism in quiescent UC and controls. Preliminary experiments showed optimal metabolism of butyrate at 1 mmol/l. In controls glutamine metabolism was greater in the ascending (mean (SD)) (4.9 (3.2) nmol/h/micrograms protein) than in the descending colon (1.4 0.7)) (p < 0.05, Mann-Whitney U test), but butyrate metabolism was similar in the two regions (ascending 62.6 (44.2), descending 51.5 (32.0)). Consequently ratios of butyrate/glutamine metabolism were higher in the descending colon (20.6 (14.3)) than in the ascending colon (14.3 (9.6)) (p < 0.05). In UC, rates of butyrate metabolism were similar in the ascending (92.5 (58.3) nmol/h/micrograms protein) and descending (93.3 (115)) colon, and these were not significantly different from controls. In UC, glutamine metabolism was similar in the ascending (6.2 (7.7) nmol/h/micrograms protein) and descending colon (7.8 (7.9)); the metabolism in the descending colon was significantly greater than in controls (p < 0.01). Butyrate (135 (56) nmol/h/microgram protein) and glutamine (24.1 (16.2)) metabolism in the ileum in UC, were not significantly different from control values (butyrate 111 (57), glutamine 15.5 (15.6)). These results confirm that there is regional variation of nutrient utilisation throughout the colon, but they do not support the hypothesis that UC is caused by a deficiency of butyrate metabolism.},

On the last 2 d an antibiotic was given that suppressed microbial activity in the digesta and slightly reduced ileostomy outflow. Mean daily amino acid excretion in ileostomy fluid ranged from 32 mg/d for methionine to approximately 330 mg/d for aspartate and glutamate. These losses were compared with current international estimates of amino acid requirements.

   abstract = {Systemic endotoxemia has been described in ulcerative colitis and Crohn's disease and shown to correlate positively with disease activity and the extent of intestinal ulceration. This study evaluated the efficacy of antibiotic and anti-endotoxic treatment in reducing systemic endotoxemia in a hapten-induced rat model of colitis. Enteral administration of paromomycin was associated with a significant reduction in systemic endotoxin concentrations (7.4 +/- 1.2 pg/ml) when compared with controls (39.8 +/- 12.6 pg/ml; p = 0.032). Intravenous injection of taurolidine was also found to significantly reduce systemic endotoxemia (3.1 +/- 1.3 pg/ml) in comparison with controls receiving saline injection (17.5 +/- 4.2 pg/ml; p = 0.008). Enteral neomycin, parenteral polymyxin or metronidazole and cefuroxime were ineffective anti-endotoxin treatments in this model. Enteral paromomycin or parenteral tauro-lidine therapy are potential methods of preventing and treating systemic endotoxemia in patients with inflammatory bowel disease.},

   abstract = {To ascertain the role of total enteral nutrition, compared with total parenteral nutrition, as adjunct therapy to steroids in patients with severe acute ulcerative colitis, a prospective randomized trial was conducted in 42 of such patients. Inclusion criteria were the persistence of a moderate or severe attack of the disease (Truelove's index) after 48 h on full steroid treatment (prednisone 1 mg/kg/day). Patients were randomized to receive polymeric total enteral nutrition or isocaloric, isonitrogenous total parenteral nutrition as the sole nutritional support. Remission rate and need for colectomy were similar in both groups. No significant changes in anthropometric parameters were observed in either nutritional group at the end of the study. Median increase in serum albumin was 16.7% (-0.5% to +30.4%) in the enteral feeding group, and only 4.6% (-12.0% to +13.7%) in the parenteral nutrition patients (p = 0.019). Adverse effects related to artificial nutritional support were less frequent (9% vs. 35%, p = 0.046) and milder in enterally fed patients. Postoperative infections occurred more often with parenteral nutrition (p = 0.028). These results suggest that total enteral nutrition is safe and nutritionally effective in severe attacks of ulcerative colitis. It is also cheaper and associated with fewer complications than parenteral nutrition. Total enteral nutrition should be regarded as the most suitable type of nutritional support in these patients.},

A family history of inflammatory bowel disease was present in 24% of patients, and 13% had a history of cow milk allergy in infancy. Initially, by radiologic or colonoscopic studies, 71% had total colonic disease, 13% had left-sided colitis, and 6% had proctitis; extensive examination was not performed in 4 patients. Four patients (11%) presented with severe colitis, 14 (37%) with moderate colitis, and 20 (53%) with mild colitis. The most frequent symptoms were abdominal pain (94%), diarrhea (84%), and rectal bleeding (84%). Between 2 and 10 years after diagnosis, 89% of children had total colonic disease and 11% had left-sided disease. All four patients with severe disease at onset responded to medical therapy with one having a colectomy 15 years later with pathology consistent with Crohn's disease. Of those with moderate disease, half had infrequent moderate recurrences and half had intermittent mild disease. One patient had colectomy at 21 years for intractable disease. Of the 20 with mild disease, 16 continued to have intermittent mild recurrences, 1 had chronic mild disease, 2 had moderate recurrent disease, and 1 has remained asymptomatic for 5 years. Psychiatric disturbances requiring therapy were identified in 5 (13%) children. Results are encouraging: after the first 2 years of illness, two thirds of the children have had subsequent mild colitis with infrequent relapses and three quarters consider their life to be of good quality.},

Extra-intestinal manifestations increased with duration of disease. Although the number of recurrences did not differ greatly between groups, those with ileocolitis and colitis needed longer steroid therapy and more days in hospital than did those with only small-bowel disease. Operation was required in 42.5% of children with CD, as compared with 5% of those with UC, with six CD children (35%) requiring later reoperation for recurrent disease or fistula and abscess. Two children died from causes unrelated to their disease (gastric volvulus, carcinoma of the breast).(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS)},

   abstract = {Crohn's disease (CD) and ulcerative colitis (UC) represent clinically distinct chronic inflammatory bowel diseases (IBD) of unknown etiology. Although the mucosal immune system is implicated in their pathogenesis, immunological differences between the two disorders are not well defined. The aim of this study was to compare in vitro mucosal T-lymphocyte function in CD and UC. Peripheral blood mononuclear cell interleukin-2 (IL-2) production was similar in pediatric IBD and control patients under unstimulated conditions, but was significantly increased in response to phytohemagglutinin (PHA) stimulation for the UC group. Lamina propria mononuclear cells (LPMNC) isolated from colonic resections in IBD patients had significantly lower spontaneous proliferation and IL-2 production in vitro than did LPMNC of control patients. In contrast, significantly greater IL-2 production was detected when the LPMNC of CD patients were cultured with PHA, in comparison with those of UC or control patients. When indomethacin, a prostaglandin synthetase inhibitor, was added to the cultures, significantly increased IL-2 secretion was observed for CD LPMNC, but not for UC cultures, under both stimulated and unstimulated conditions. These findings demonstrate abnormal LPMNC IL-2 production in IBD. Furthermore, our data suggest that inhibition of the prostaglandin synthetase pathway upregulates IL-2 production by LPMNC in CD. These results support the hypothesis that immunoregulatory mechanisms controlling IL-2 production differ between CD and UC.},

   abstract = {UNLABELLED: Severe acute ulcerative colitis unresponsive to medical management is characterized by multiple associated risk factors including anemia, hypoproteinemia, and high steroid requirements when urgent surgery is required. Current surgical options include use of primary ileal pouch-anal anastomosis (IPAA) vs. historic trends favoring colectomy with ileostomy. PURPOSE: To evaluate the efficacy of primary IPAA in patients with severe colitis, we reviewed our own experience in 20 patients with this condition. METHODS: Patients undergoing primary restorative proctocolectomy included 13 males and 7 females (mean age, 30.5 +/- 2.4 years). Exclusion criteria for primary reconstruction included septic patients and patients with associated medical conditions such as pulmonary or cardiovascular disease. History of ulcerative colitis averaged 3.1 +/- 1.1 years (range, 1 month to 19 years). Preoperative mean total serum protein concentration was 5.0 +/- 0.2 g/dl, and mean albumin concentration was 2.1 +/- 0.2 g/dl, reflecting disease severity. The average daily steroid requirement at the time of urgent colectomy was 58.0 +/- 4.4 mg of prednisone (or intravenous equivalent). Primary IPAA included 18 "W" reservoirs, 1 "S" reservoir, and 1 "J" reservoir. RESULTS: Major surgical complications included mild pancreatitis (10 percent), anastomotic leak (5 percent), adrenal insufficiency (15 percent), an upper gastrointestinal bleed (5 percent), and small bowel obstruction (15 percent). There were no deaths, and no patients developed pelvic sepsis or required IPAA removal. At three and twelve months, 24-hr stool frequency averaged 7.3 +/- 0.4 and 4.9 +/- 0.3, respectively. Overall day and night continence was excellent and not different from patients who underwent elective IPAA procedures for ulcerative colitis. CONCLUSIONS: Improved options such as primary IPAA may be safely used in selected patients requiring urgent surgery for severe or fulminant ulcerative colitis. Medical management should be abbreviated when disease control cannot be promptly achieved.},

   abstract = {Weight and height were followed longitudinally from birth to adulthood in children with inflammatory bowel disease living in a defined area of Sweden, 1983 through 1987; 124 children out of a possible 128 were studied. During the year preceding diagnosis, height growth velocity was significantly reduced in both ulcerative colitis and Crohn's disease. At the time of diagnosis, weight-for-height was subnormal in both children with ulcerative colitis (p < 0.05) and those with Crohn's disease (p < 0.001), while height was reduced only in children with Crohn's disease (p < 0.05). Weight for height was normalized within one year in ulcerative colitis, after the initiation of medical therapy. In Crohn's disease, weight-for-height improved during the years following diagnosis but height remained subnormal. Children with ulcerative colitis reached puberty at the normal time and their final heights became normal. In children with Crohn's disease, puberty was delayed (p < 0.001) and final height was reduced (p < 0.01). The impact of inflammatory bowel disease on growth was substantial, but it was smaller in this study than in many other published studies. The possible reasons for this difference include use of population-based material and a relatively short interval between the first symptoms and the start of treatment. Our findings indicate that, although final height was significantly reduced in children with Crohn's disease, delayed puberty reduced the negative effects on permanent adult height, to a certain extent compensating for the period of poor growth earlier in life.},

However, the frequency of uveitis in pediatric IBD is not known, as few patients have eye examinations on a routine basis. Experience with a child with Crohn's disease, who had asymptomatic uveitis identified by routine screening initiated because of associated arthritis, prompted us to undertake this evaluation. The purpose of this cross-sectional prospective study was to ascertain the point-prevalence of uveitis in pediatric IBD patients, including 97 with Crohn's disease and 50 with ulcerative colitis. Each child underwent an ophthalmologic assessment, including slit-lamp examination. In Crohn's disease, inflammatory cells and/or flare were observed in the anterior chamber of six (6.2%) patients. These changes were mild in all six patients and required no treatment. In the group with ulcerative colitis, there were no cases of asymptomatic uveitis. There was a higher frequency of asymptomatic transient uveitis in patients with Crohn's colitis (four of 22, 18.2%) than in those of other anatomic subgroups (two of 75, 2.7%; p < 0.05). Frequency of uveitis was also higher in IBD patients having other extraintestinal manifestations (15.0%) than in those without (3.1%; p < 0.10). There was no relationship observed between the activity of bowel disease and presence of ocular inflammation.},

   abstract = {IBD is one of the most significant chronic diseases afflicting children and adolescents. As in adults, UC and CD constitute the two major disease entities, with many of the characteristics of these two diseases being similar in adults and children. With technical advances, a complete endoscopic examination of the colon and terminal ileum can be performed in most children without difficulty. There are, however, a number of aspects of the presentation, course, and management of these diseases that are unique to the pediatric population. Because the impact of inadequate nutrition is much greater in the growing child than in adults, growth failure is a common, serious complication of malnutrition in this population. The psychological impact of a chronic illness on both the developing child and the family can also be significant. The management of this population is further complicated by the lack of adequate studies that assess not only the effect of a medical or surgical therapy on disease activity, but also address the issues of growth and pubertal development. It has been a challenge to extrapolate data from adult studies to the pediatric population. The management of children and adolescents requires a critical understanding of the differences between pediatric and adult patients to maximize growth potential and minimize longterm sequelae of treatment. After a long period of limited controlled studies, however, collaborative efforts are underway to investigate most aspects of pediatric IBD, and we look forward to exciting advances toward the optimal management of children and adolescents with IBD.},

Thickening of the duodenal wall was observed in nine (82%) of the 11 with such gastrointestinal (GI) symptoms as severe abdominal pain or bleeding. The thickened duodenal wall showed a high echogenicity. Enlargement of the duodenal lumen was seen in seven (64%) patients with GI symptoms. These findings had been observed in four patients before SHP was diagnosed on the basis of the peculiar skin lesions. In three cases of SHP without GI symptoms, those changes were absent. Four cases of ulcerative colitis, three of bacterial enterocolitis (two Yersinia and one Klebsiella), and five without SHP and any GI problems did not exhibit such duodenal abnormalities. On subsequent endoscopic study, mucosal edema and multiple hemorrhagic erosions were seen, especially at the second portion of the duodenum in two cases of SHP. Biopsy specimens from the duodenum of those cases showed leukocytoclastic vasculitis, suggested by the ultrasound (US) findings. It is important to consider the duodenal changes carefully when US is performed in patients with severe GI symptoms of unknown origin. The characteristic duodenal findings described suggest the differential diagnosis of SHP, which usually requires no surgical intervention.},

Liver biopsy and endoscopic retrograde cholangiopancreatography (ERCP) demonstrated sclerosing cholangitis. Colonoscopy with biopsy revealed ulcerative colitis which responded to sulfasalazine. Diabetes occurred at age 18 and insulin therapy was begun. The second patient was 19 at presentation with diarrhea, hematochezia, and weight loss. Proctosigmoidoscopy revealed ulcerative colitis, and sulfasalazine led to clinical remission. Three months later he developed diabetes requiring insulin therapy. At age 28, he developed elevated alkaline phosphatase, and ERCP revealed sclerosing cholangitis. At age 37 he expired from adenocarcinoma that metastasized to the liver. Literature review revealed only one possible case report of this association with microscopic asymptomatic ulcerative colitis in that patient. Statistical analysis suggests that this association is real rather than a chance occurrence. An autoimmune process may be involved and a specific histocompatibility locus antigen (HLA) type may exert a regulatory influence.},

Increasing volumes of liquid nutrients were injected, twice daily for two months, into the pelvic pouch through a mucous ileal fistula proximal to the pouch before closing the temporary ileostomy. With this method the number of evacuations per 24 hours was significantly reduced during the first few weeks following the reestablishment of intestinal continuity, compared with a control group (average, 8.5 vs. 18.2, respectively). Patients also had better continence and less urgency to defecate. We suggest this technique in patients undergoing pelvic ileal reconstruction with temporary ileostomy.},

   abstract = {The mechanisms of nutritional therapy in inflammatory bowel disease have not been thoroughly established. It is likely that a further understanding of the underlying disease process will allow better understanding of these forms of therapy, with a sounder rationale for the construction of specific diet constituents for therapy. Regardless, nutritional therapy is likely to be multidimensional, and various forms may affect different aspects of the disease process. Decreased inflammatory factors, decreased antigenic stimuli, provision of essential nutrients, improved immune function, and other factors may all be of varying importance in different patients with inflammatory bowel disease. Little work has been done on the role of diet therapy in the long-term treatment of patients with inflammatory bowel disease as a method of preventing relapse. Parenteral nutrition and elemental diets appear to have limited roles in this area. Some investigation has been done to see if minor modifications of the normal diet can prolong remission periods. Low-fiber diets are frequently recommended for patients with strictures. Whether this has any significant effect on symptoms, inflammation, or complications is unclear. Heaton et al suggested that a high-fiber, unrefined carbohydrate diet resulted in fewer and shorter hospitalizations. In a prospective follow-up study by Ritchie et al, however, these results were not able to be reproduced. Exclusion diets have also been suggested as a means of reducing relapse rates in patients with Crohn's disease. In a small, randomized, controlled trial of an exclusion diet versus an unrefined carbohydrate, fiber-rich diet, there were significantly fewer relapses among the patients treated with the exclusion diet at 6 months. These diets require intensive patient cooperation, but the potential side effects are minimal. Clearly, these findings need to be reproduced in large, prospective, randomized, controlled studies before widespread use can be advocated. A great deal of data exists on the use of nutritional supplementation in the treatment of inflammatory bowel disease, although little of it is in the form of large, randomized, controlled studies. Nutritional manipulation currently has a limited role in patients with ulcerative colitis; a much broader role exists in patients with Crohn's disease. The mechanisms by which nutritional therapy affects these diseases may include a combination of factors--decreased antigenic exposure, improved immune function, and provision of essential nutrients and calories needed for bowel regeneration.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 400 WORDS)},

   abstract = {Inflammatory bowel disease in children and adults remains the most challenging problem in gastroenterology. There is an increasing body of immunologic and genetic evidence to suggest that Crohn's disease and ulcerative colitis are different diseases, but that once inflammation begins, many common secondary pathways of inflammation are initiated. The major recent conceptual advance is the observation that mice in whom different immunoregulatory pathways are disrupted develop an inflammatory bowel disease. In the case of interleukin-2 knockout mice, the lesion restricted to the colon, is virtually identical to ulcerative colitis in humans, and is initiated by the normal bacterial flora. Yet these mice possess anticolon antibodies, long-considered to be of pathologic significance in ulcerative colitis. These animal models will allow detailed longitudinal studies to be done, and less reliance will need to be placed on cross-sectional studies of chronically inflamed gut from patients.},

METHODS: Thirty-nine consecutive patients with severe ulcerative colitis were randomized on admission to the hospital to receive intravenously either metronidazole (0.5g tid) and tobramycin (4 mg/kg tid) (n = 19), or placebo (n = 20). In addition, they were given parenteral nutrition, intravenous hydrocortisone (100 mg qid) and hydrocortisone enemas (100 mg bid). All patients were assessed after 10 days of continuous treatment, or at any time a severe complication occurred. RESULTS: Twelve of 19 patients (63.15%) treated with antibiotics and 13/20 patients (65%) with placebo showed substantial improvement. Seven patients in each group did not improve (n = 9), or developed complications (n = 5) and underwent emergency colectomy without perioperative deaths or late deaths. CONCLUSIONS: These results do not support the routine use of intravenous tobramycin and metronidazole in the treatment of severe ulcerative colitis.},

One hundred five physicians (27% of surveys) responded. Eighty-eight (84%) had prescribed 6-mercaptopurine and/or azathioprine for IBD, and 66 believed that they were effective. Only 12 had used cyclosporine and four methotrexate. All physicians who had used immunosuppressives in IBD had prescribed them for patients with Crohn's disease, but only 50% had prescribed them for ulcerative colitis. The predominant indications for use included intractable symptoms despite traditional medical therapy (92%) and for corticosteroid-sparing effects (86%). Potential toxicities of greatest concern included marrow and immune suppression and malignancy. The vast majority of responders were not certain what to recommend with respect to the use of immunosuppressive agents prior to and during pregnancy. A clinical database was compiled from 165 retrospective case reports submitted by 45 physicians (33 medical facilities). At the start of immunosuppressive therapy, patients were 15.3 +/- 4.0 yr of age, and 52% were Tanner IV-V. Eighty-one percent had Crohn's disease, 8% ulcerative colitis, and 11% indeterminant colitis. One hundred twenty-two were treated with 6-mercaptopurine, and 43 with azathioprine. Five also received cyclosporine concomitantly. Overall, 68% of patients treated with an immunosuppressive improved. Complications requiring discontinuation of immunosuppressive therapy occurred in 6% of patients. It appears that immunosuppressives are commonly used to treat children with IBD despite a paucity of data regarding their safety and efficacy in this age group. Controlled, prospective trials are warranted to better define the role of immunosuppressive therapy in pediatric IBD.},

All were fully grown (Tanner V; 21.1 +/- 3.0 years) at last examination. Adult heights were predicted from data obtained at or shortly after the diagnosis of IBD by three methods: height for age percentile, the Bailey-Pinneau (BP), and Roche-Wainer-Thissen (RWT) methods. Predicted adult heights were then compared with the actual ultimate height of each subject. Permanent growth failure occurred in 19-35% of subjects, depending upon the method used to assess growth. Overall, 31% (15 of 48) of the subjects had deficits of adult height identified by two or more methods, including 14 of 38 (37%) of those with Crohn's disease but only one of 10 with ulcerative colitis. Age at diagnosis of IBD, age at last examination, age at cessation of linear growth, and site of IBD did not differ between impaired and normal growth groups. Duration of corticosteroid use was longer (p < 0.05) in growth-impaired subjects. In addition, although 60% of all subjects had periods of poor growth that put them in height-for-age percentiles two or more major growth channels below previous percentiles, only 19% remained at these levels upon achieving their final adult heights. Permanent impairment of linear growth leading to clinically meaningful deficits of ultimate adult height is common in patients with IBD in childhood or early adolescence. New therapeutic approaches are needed to address this problem.},

   abstract = {BACKGROUND: Growth failure frequently complicates the clinical course of inflammatory bowel disease (IBD) in children. This study was designed to investigate the role of disease activity versus steroid therapy on growth faltering in this disorder. METHODS: We studied growth failure and its relationship to disease activity and steroid therapy in 69 children who have IBD by prospectively monitoring height for a maximum of 3 years. Disease activity and steroid use were recorded at entry into the study. RESULTS: The prevalence of growth failure was 24%, 23%, and 39% by height velocity, Z score, and height-for-age criteria, respectively; deficits were equally prevalent regardless of the stage of pubertal development. A delay in linear growth persisted throughout puberty and was not reversed after surgery. Patients who had Crohn's disease were twice as likely to have growth abnormalities than patients who had ulcerative colitis. We detected significant negative associations between linear growth and disease activity but not steroid therapy. CONCLUSIONS: In a unique group of children, growth failure is an early, "prepatterned" manifestation of IBD. The inflammatory process, rather than steroid use, has a predominant influence on the development of growth faltering.},

Despite the differences in their pathogenesis, the first-line treatments for Crohn's disease and ulcerative colitis are still based upon combinations of amino-salicylic acid derivatives and corticosteroids, although the use of enteral nutrition regimes is becoming increasingly widespread in Crohn's disease. In this chapter we attempt to provide reasonably didactic guidance for the management of most cases of chronic inflammatory bowel disease. However, we have tried to go beyond this brief, motivated by the recent explosion in knowledge of inflammatory mechanisms, to suggest a rational approach to the choice of newer and less well tested therapeutic approaches in the affected child who is not responding effectively. The relative failure of cyclosporine therapy in Crohn's disease has been particularly disappointing in view of its ideal theoretical suitability. However, the encouraging early reports of treatment with anti-CD4 and anti-TNF alpha monoclonals suggest that the shift from broad spectrum immunomodulation to the targeting of critical components of the inflammatory cascade may yet field important dividends.},

   abstract = {The local release of inflammatory mediators are intricately linked with initiation and propagation of the inflammatory reaction in ulcerative colitis (UC) and Crohn's disease. We have used immunohistochemical staining of colonic biopsies to determine the cell of origin and the location of the cells which synthesize of TNF-alpha and IL-1 beta in patients with UC and Crohn's colitis. Patients were chosen from children aged 7-16 years, who had UC or Crohn's diagnosed following review of colonic biopsies taken during colonoscopy. The patients reviewed had not received treatment for inflammatory bowel disease. Paraffin embedded colonic biopsies were sectioned, deparaffinized, and stained with mouse monoclonal IgG antibodies directed against human recombinant TNF-alpha and IL-1 beta. The colonic lamina propria of all biopsies from patients with UC or Crohn's colitis was expanded with a mixed mononuclear, polymorphonuclear, lymphocytic, and plasmacytic infiltrate. Mononuclear cells distributed throughout the interstitium, stained prominently for both TNF-alpha and IL-1 beta. Plasmacytes, polymorphonuclear leukocytes, small lymphocytes, and foamy macrophages did not stain for either TNF-alpha or IL-1 beta. Transmigrating mononuclear cells in crypt epithelium also stained brightly for both TNF-alpha and IL-1 beta. Colonic epithelial cells did not stain for either TNF-alpha or IL-1 beta.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS)},

We have examined the sera of 41 children and adolescents with ulcerative colitis, 27 with Crohn's disease, and a control group for the presence of ANCA. Anti-neutrophil cytoplasmic antibodies were detected in the serum of 27 of 41 patients with ulcerative colitis (66%), five of 27 with Crohn's disease (19%), and in none of our control subjects or patients with functional abdominal pain. Overall, the presence of ANCA was 66% sensitive and 84% specific for a diagnosis of ulcerative colitis when compared to Crohn's disease. There was no relationship between a positive ANCA value and disease activity or other clinical indicators. We conclude that evaluation for the presence of ANCA may be a useful adjunct for the clinical assessment of patients with inflammatory bowel disease. The presence of ANCA in children and adolescents, however, will not definitively distinguish between patients with ulcerative colitis and Crohn's disease.},

Breast-feeding was negatively associated with Crohn's disease (P approximately 0.04) and ulcerative colitis (P approximately 0.07), with relative risk point estimates around 0.5 and with evidence of duration-dependent trends in both instances. There was no evidence of association of either disease with maternal age at birth, birth order, maternal smoking, or season of birth.},

   abstract = {BACKGROUND: Mercaptides (sodium hydrogen sulfide and sodium methanethiol) and mercapto-fatty acid (sodium mercaptoacetate) are reducing agents that help to maintain anaerobic conditions in the colonic lumen. The metabolic effect of these agents on n-butyrate and glucose oxidation in human colonocytes is unknown. METHODS: Isolated human colonocytes were prepared from 31 colectomy specimens, and generation of oxidative metabolites from [1-14C]n-butyrate and [6-14C]glucose was measured in the presence and absence of reducing agents. Injury to cells was judged by diminished production of metabolites. RESULTS: The injurious action of mercaptides at all sites of the colon was of the order of sodium hydrogen sulfide > methanethiol > mercaptoacetate. Significant inhibition of n-butyrate (< 0.005) but not glucose oxidation was observed with sodium hydrogen sulfide in the ascending colon, splenic flexure, and rectosigmoid region. Hydrogen sulfide more significantly inhibited fatty acid oxidation in the rectosigmoid than in the ascending colon (P < 0.02). CONCLUSIONS: Metabolic effects of sodium hydrogen sulfide on butyrate oxidation along the length of the colon closely mirror metabolic abnormalities observed in active ulcerative colitis, and the increased production of sulfide in ulcerative colitis suggests that the action of mercaptides may be involved in the genesis of ulcerative colitis.},

Forty-one children were found to have Crohn's disease and 47, ulcerative colitis. Upper gastrointestinal endoscopy revealed pathology in 32 (80%) cases of Crohn's disease, esophagitis in 16, and esophageal ulcer in two, nonspecific gastritis in 22, duodenitis or duodenal ulcer in 18, and Helicobacter pylori infection in two cases. Granulomas were detected in 10 patients in the upper gastrointestinal tract: one esophageal, eight gastric, and three duodenal. Of the ulcerative colitis patients, seven had esophagitis, one had esophageal ulcer, 17 had nonspecific gastritis, two had gastric ulcers, two had duodenal ulcers, and five had H. pylori infection; altogether 30 (75%) yielded pathological findings. Radiological studies using barium meal revealed pathology in only eight of all inflammatory bowel disease cases. Symptoms at admission were not conclusive for definite diagnosis because 63% of patients with Crohn's disease had signs of colitis (such as diarrhea, bloody diarrhea) compared to 94% of ulcerative colitis patients. Upper gastrointestinal endoscopy may be used to achieve a specific diagnosis, thus being helpful when planning treatment. Also a considerable incidence of nonspecific gastritis, duodenitis, and esophagitis with or without concomitant H. pylori infection may be anticipated in children suffering from both ulcerative colitis and Crohn's disease.},

We studied 14 outpatients, who were evaluated for an experimental therapeutic protocol. The activity of the disease was established using clinical, endoscopic and histologic parameters. The Kappa Index (K) was used for statistical analysis. The average number of bowel movements was 4/day; rectal bleeding and urgency were found in 100%, diarrhea in 78% and abdominal pain in 64%. The severity of rectal bleeding and urgency was graded II or III in 92% and 78% respectively. The correlation between endoscopy and histology (K = 0.55), and between clinical and endoscopy (K = 0.45) was moderate. There was no correlation between clinical and histological parameters. IN CONCLUSION: the variability of symptoms impairs the clinical evaluation as the unique method to determine the activity of UC and to take therapeutical decisions is necessary to perform a endoscopic/histology correlation.},

The percentage IL-1R expressing platelets (median and interquartile range IQR) in the IBD group was 8.7% (5.5-18.2) compared to 4.2% (2.3-6.1) in controls (P = 0.02). The percentage IL-8R expressing platelets in the IBD group was 22.5% (16.5-27.9) and 9.2% (4.3-9.6) in controls (P < 0.001). Furthermore, platelet IL-1R expression in patients with IBD was inversely related to the total daily dose of steroids (r = 0.71, P < 0.01 linear regression analysis). Finally, platelet rich plasma from healthy controls was stimulated with rhIL-1 beta and rhIL-8 and assessed for activation dependent expression of platelet aGPIIb/IIIa and CD62 (p-selectin, GMP-140). IL-1 beta and IL-8 in vitro significantly and specifically activated the platelets. The surface membrane of platelets is able to express functional IL-1R and IL-8R, the expression of which is significantly increased in IBD. Interleukin-1 beta and IL-8 modulate platelet activation in vitro indicating a target role for platelet function in inflammation.},

   abstract = {The aetiology of ulcerative colitis and Crohn's disease remains unknown. While this remains so, treatment must be directed towards pathogenetic mechanisms. Corticosteroids, sulphasalazine and the new salicylates, the immunosuppressants azathioprine, 6-MP and, more recently, cyclosporin and metronidazole have become the accepted and standard forms of treatment. The importance of maintaining nutritional status is often overlooked but must be considered in every patient. Recognition of the occurrence of disease in all age groups, and in particular in children and adolescents, is also important, as is an appreciation of the special problems involved. The possibility of surgery at some stage of the disease should be raised with the patient. As the pathogenetic mechanisms of inflammatory bowel disease are further elucidated, new forms of treatment will be developed. This is already happening, with studies looking at such agents as immunoglobulin G, eicosapentaenoic acid and a new specific inhibitor of 5-lipoxygenase. These offer hope of more potent drugs with low side-effect profiles that may complement or replace the currently available agents used in the management of inflammatory bowel disease.},

At the time of inclusion the patients had a significantly reduced BMC of lumbar spine and femoral neck compared to normals (Z-scores = -3.35 +/- 3.49, p < 0.05 and Z-score = -2.23 +/- 2.11, p < 0.05). During HPN the Z-score of lumbar spine BMC decreased in 8 patients and increased slightly or was unchanged in 7 patients. The mean Z-score of BMC of lumbar spine declined by 1.46 +/- 2.48 (p < 0.05) and the Z-score of femoral neck BMC declined by 0.831 +/- 1.14 (p < 0.05). This corresponds to a yearly decrease of lumbar spine BMC of 4%. There was no correlation between the decline in BMC during the study and the period of length the patients were on HPN. We conclude that patients on HPN have a low bone mineral density and that the bone loss continues during prolonged HPN.},

   abstract = {BACKGROUND: It is well established that the colonic mucosa is highly dependent upon the luminal presentation of nutrients. This dependence is most marked in the distal colon. The major luminal nutrients are short chain fatty acids (SCFA) that are produced as a by-product of colonic fermentation of carbohydrates. Butyrate appears to be the SCFA that is most avidly metabolized by the colonic mucosa. It has been suggested that ulcerative colitis (UC) is, at least in part, related to an energy deficiency state of the colonic mucosa which may be secondary to impaired SCFA production, uptake, or utilization. OBJECTIVE: To determine if butyrate enemas are safe and effective in refractory distal UC. METHODS: Ten patients with distal UC, refractory to all other available forms of rectal therapy and to oral sulfasalazine or mesalamine (5-ASA), were treated with nightly butyrate enemas in an open-label study. Enemas consisted of 60 ml of 80 mM sodium butyrate titrated to a pH of 7.0. Patients were assessed clinically and endoscopically at baseline and at 3- to 6-wk intervals, and a disease activity score from 0 to 12 was determined. Response to therapy was determined by changes in the activity score. RESULTS: Six of 10 patients responded to therapy. Four of these six had complete responses. The mean disease activity score of all 10 patients fell from 8.0 +/- 2.4 (mean +/- SD) to 4.3 +/- 4.1 at the end of follow-up. Response to therapy could not be predicted based on any of the baseline characteristics analyzed. CONCLUSIONS: In this open-label study, patients with distal UC who were refractory to all previous therapy had a 40% complete response rate and an overall 60% response rate. Controlled studies of this promising therapy are indicated.},

The importance of SCFAs for the maintenance of colonic epithelium has been demonstrated in animal models of colitis produced by rectal instillation of an inhibitor of SCFA oxidation and in patients with diversion colitis in whom a segment of colonic epithelium was deprived of contact with luminal SCFAs. We measured fecal SCFAs and lactate in children with ulcerative colitis (UC; n = 17) and with Crohn's disease with ileocolonic involvement (CD; n = 22) and age-matched controls (n = 12) by a vacuum-distillation, gas chromatographic method. Fecal SCFA concentrations were correlated with scores of clinical disease activity. Patients with UC and CD had a decrease in the fecal concentration of acetate (p < 0.05) and an increase in n-butyrate (p < 0.01) compared with controls. No significant changes in fecal lactate were seen. A comparison of inactive- or mild-UC patients with moderate or severe-UC patients yielded major differences in SCFA concentrations with n-butyrate increased in inactive and mild UC well above control values and total SCFA and acetate decreased in moderate and severe UC below control levels. Raised concentrations of fecal n-butyrate may reflect impaired utilization of this SCFA in the colon of patients with mild UC and Crohn's disease with colonic involvement. Whether this defect is primary or secondary to inhibitors in the colonic lumen, due to impaired transport of n-butyrate into the cell or defective metabolism within the cell, or specific to inflammatory bowel disease remains to be explored.},

   abstract = {Extraintestinal autoimmune disorders are associated with ulcerative colitis in selected patients and lend support to the theory of immune-mediated injury in inflammatory bowel disease. Rarely, alopecia areata has been associated with ulcerative colitis, and familial aggregation and an HLA association have been reported for both disorders. The occurrence of both alopecia and ulcerative colitis in a mother and son are reported with a detailed investigation of antineutrophil cytoplasmic antibodies and HLA alleles in this family. Treatment with the immunosuppressive agent cyclosporine proved beneficial in the child leading to remission of the ulcerative colitis and nascent growth of scalp and body hair.},

   abstract = {Tests that positively identify individuals with ulcerative colitis, distinguishing them from patients with Crohn disease or other causes of colitis, have not been reliable. Genetic predisposition to inflammatory bowel diseases and genetic influence on immune regulation resulted in the clinical evaluation of potential serologic markers. In adults the presence of anti-neutrophil cytoplasmic antibody (ANCA) in serum identifies patients with ulcerative colitis. In this study we demonstrated that high levels of ANCA are present in 83% of children and adolescents with ulcerative colitis. Furthermore, the majority of patients with ulcerative colitis had a perinuclear pattern of these antibodies by indirect immunofluorescence. The combination of a positive ANCA and perinuclear indirect immunofluorescence pattern was 97% specific for ulcerative colitis. We conclude that determination of ANCA is a sensitive and specific clinical test for identification of children and adolescents with ulcerative colitis.},

   abstract = {Adults with inflammatory bowel disease from North Carolina were questioned during 1986 and 1987 to assess risk due to a variety of childhood infections and treatments with antibiotics. Responses were compared with those of neighbor controls. Persons with Crohn's disease were more likely to report an increased frequency of childhood infections in general (odds ratio 4.67, 95% CI 2.65-8.23) and pharyngitis specifically (odds ratio 2.14, 95% CI 1.30-3.51). This was validated by an increased frequency of tonsillectomy (odds ratio 1.53, 95% CI 1.07-2.20). Crohn's cases were more likely to report frequent treatment with antibiotics for both otitis (odds ratio 2.07, 95% CI 1.03-4.14) and pharyngitis (odds ratio 2.14, 95% CI 1.20-3.84). Although Crohn's cases were more likely to report frequent exposure to penicillin (odds ratio 1.81, 95% CI 0.98-3.31), there did not appear to be excess risk conferred by penicillin after controlling for frequency of infections. Persons with ulcerative colitis also reported an excess of infections generally (odds ratio 2.37, 95% CI 1.19-4.71), but not an excess of specific infections or treatments with antibiotics. Persons who reported an increased frequency of infections tended to have an earlier onset of Crohn's disease (P < 0.0001) and ulcerative colitis (P = 0.04). Finally, it was noted that urban living in childhood increased the risk for Crohn's disease. We conclude that childhood infections may be a risk factor for Crohn's disease and may presage the early onset of disease.},
