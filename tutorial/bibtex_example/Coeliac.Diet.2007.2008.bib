   abstract = {Celiac disease (CD) is a small intestinal inflammatory disorder characterized by an immune-mediated enteropathy triggered by the ingestion of wheat gluten or related rye and barley proteins in genetically predisposed individuals carrying the human leukocyte antigens (HLA)-DQ2 or -DQ8. Nonresponsive CD (NRCD) is a clinical diagnosis defined by the persistence of signs, symptoms, and/or laboratory abnormalities typical of CD despite adherence to a gluten-free diet for at least 6 months. One cause for NRCD is refractory CD (RCD), defined as the persistence of severe villous atrophy on small intestinal biopsy despite strict gluten withdrawal for at least 6 months with no evidence of other pathology. Although rare, RCD should be suspected in individuals with an established diagnosis of CD who fail to respond primarily or secondarily to a strict gluten-free diet, particularly if they manifest significant weight loss. A thorough evaluation must be performed to distinguish RCD from other causes of NRCD. RCD may be categorized into type I or type II. Type I RCD has a more favorable prognosis compared with type II and can often be managed with nutritional supplementation and possibly low level immunosuppressive therapy. Type II RCD carries a poor prognosis and is more likely to progress to life-threatening malnutrition or intestinal T-cell lymphoma. Immunosuppressive agents and, more recently, autologous stem cell transplant have been used to treat type II RCD.},

The objective of this study was to evaluate bone mineral density (BMD) in DH and to examine whether dietary treatment or degree of the small intestinal lesion correlate with BMD. Twenty-five patients with DH (18 men) were investigated. Detailed dietary assessment and duodenal biopsies were performed on all patients before entry into the study. BMD at lumbar spine and femur was determined by DXA scan. Bone biomarkers, vitamin D, and parathyroid status were assessed. Twenty patients had enteropathy. None of the patients had hypovitaminosis D or secondary hyperparathyroidism. Resorption and formation markers were within normal limits. BMD Z-scores were not significantly different from expected (-0.38; CI, -0.84 to 0.07) and femur (0.46; CI, -0.06 to 0.97). There was no relationship between BMD Z-scores and the severity of the degree of enteropathy. We conclude that enteropathy of differing severity is present in 80% of patients with DH, but this is not associated with bone disease.},

   abstract = {OBJECTIVE: A high prevalence of anxiety and depression has been reported in coeliac disease (CD). Although social phobia is included among the anxiety disorders, its presence in CD has never been investigated. The aim of the present study was to evaluate social phobia in CD patients. MATERIAL AND METHODS: A total of 40 CD patients were consecutively enrolled in the study. Fifty healthy subjects were studied as controls. Social phobia was assessed by the Liebowitz Social Anxiety Scale (LSAS) and current depression by the modified version of the Zung Self-rating Depression Scale (M-SDS). RESULTS: The percentage of subjects with social phobia was significantly higher in CD patients than in controls (70% versus 16%; p<0.0001), and also when the more severe generalized form was considered (15.0% versus 0%; p=0.006). The percentage of subjects with social phobia was not statistically different between newly diagnosed subjects and patients on a gluten free diet (73.3% versus 68%; p: NS), nor considering its generalized form (7.0% versus 20%; p: NS). Current depression was present in a significantly higher percentage of CD patients in comparison with controls (52.5% versus 8%; p<0.0001). A direct correlation between social phobia and current depression was found in CD patients (r=0.582; p<0.0001). CONCLUSIONS: Despite the limited number of cases evaluated, the present study showed a significantly higher prevalence of social phobia in CD patients compared with in healthy subjects. Future studies are needed to clarify the possible social phobia-induced risks such as school and/or work failure in CD patients.},

The aim was to evaluate immunoglobulin (Ig)A and IgG antibodies to synthetic deamidated gliadin peptides (DGP) and human tTG as screening markers for childhood celiac disease. METHODS: Antibodies were detected in enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay using anti-human IgA, IgG, or a combined conjugate of IgA and IgG (IgAG) against DGP, tTG, or both (DGP/tTG), in sera from 119 children with celiac disease, 57 disease controls, and 398 blood donors. Treatment with a gluten-free diet was evaluated in 20 children with celiac disease who were followed up for 6 months from diagnosis. RESULTS: The highest sensitivity was accounted for IgAG-DGP/tTG at 100% (119 of 119), followed by IgA-tTG at 97% (115 of 119), IgG-DGP at 95% (113 of 119), IgA-DGP at 91% (108 of 119), and IgG-tTG at 13% (15 of 119). With respect to disease controls and blood donors, specificity was for IgAG-DGP/tTG at 89% (51 of 57) and at 97% (385 of 398), IgA-tTG at 96% (55 of 57) and at 98% (392 of 398), IgG-DGP at 86% (49 of 57) and at 99% (395 of 398), IgA-DGP at 91% (52 of 57) and at 92% (366 of 398), and IgG-tTG at 100%, respectively. The concordances between antibody assays were 87%-98%, except for comparisons with IgG-tTG (39%-41%). After 6 months of a gluten-free diet, the mean antibody levels decreased for all test results (P < .001). CONCLUSIONS: The combined IgAG-DGP/tTG assay is recommended as a front-line screening test for the identification of childhood celiac disease and also could be used as a marker of dietary compliance.},

   abstract = {BACKGROUND AND AIMS: Non-diarrheal presentation of celiac disease (CD) is being increasingly recognized. Data on this form of CD from India are limited. METHODS: Consecutive patients with CD presenting to a tertiary referral center in northern India over a 3-year period were studied, with special emphasis on non-diarrheal celiac disease (NDCD). Diagnosis was based on the presence of autoantibodies typical of CD (IgA anti-tissue transglutaminase antibodies and/ or IgA endomysial antibodies), abnormal duodenal biopsy and response to gluten-free diet (GFD). Clinical, hematological and histological responses were assessed over a one-year period after instituting GFD. RESULTS: Of 86 patients with CD, 31 (16 children, 15 adult) had NDCD. Mean (SD) age of these children (12 boys) and adults (4 male) was 10.2 (4.2) y and 35.3 (12.0) y, respectively. Failure to thrive was the most common (11/16) presentation in children, as was refractory anemia in adults (10/15). Malabsorption was found in 8 adults (54%) and 10 children (64%) with NCCD. The duration from onset of symptoms to diagnosis was 2.9 (1.5) y in children and 3.3 (0.3) y in adults. There was significant improvement in body weight (children--baseline 18.9 [5.8] Kg, follow up 27.4 [12.4] Kg; adults--baseline 47.6 [18.2] Kg, follow up 54.9 [5.1] Kg) and hemoglobin (children--8.1 [2.0] g/dL to 11.2 [1.4] g/dL; adults--7.3 [2.3] g/dL to 9.7 [1.7] g/dL) in both groups after one year of GFD; duodenal biopsy also improved, with a majority of patients attaining normal to IIIa Marsh grading. Five adults and all children had evidence of metabolic bone disease at presentation, which did not revert completely with GFD. Eight adults and nine children showed dietary transgression 6 weeks after starting GFD. CONCLUSION: NDCD ac-counted for nearly one-third of all cases with CD at our center, with 'failure to thrive' and refractory anemia being the most common presentations in children and adults, respectively.},

   abstract = {This position paper on complementary feeding summarizes evidence for health effects of complementary foods. It focuses on healthy infants in Europe. After reviewing current knowledge and practices, we have formulated these conclusions: Exclusive or full breast-feeding for about 6 months is a desirable goal. Complementary feeding (ie, solid foods and liquids other than breast milk or infant formula and follow-on formula) should not be introduced before 17 weeks and not later than 26 weeks. There is no convincing scientific evidence that avoidance or delayed introduction of potentially allergenic foods, such as fish and eggs, reduces allergies, either in infants considered at increased risk for the development of allergy or in those not considered to be at increased risk. During the complementary feeding period, >90% of the iron requirements of a breast-fed infant must be met by complementary foods, which should provide sufficient bioavailable iron. Cow's milk is a poor source of iron and should not be used as the main drink before 12 months, although small volumes may be added to complementary foods. It is prudent to avoid both early (<4 months) and late (>or=7 months) introduction of gluten, and to introduce gluten gradually while the infant is still breast-fed, inasmuch as this may reduce the risk of celiac disease, type 1 diabetes mellitus, and wheat allergy. Infants and young children receiving a vegetarian diet should receive a sufficient amount ( approximately 500 mL) of breast milk or formula and dairy products. Infants and young children should not be fed a vegan diet.},

AIM: To investigate the threshold amount of gluten and the threshold concentration of gluten in food products that can be tolerated by people with coeliac disease. DESIGN: Systematic review of studies published between 1966 and May 2007. METHODS: The data sources used were MEDLINE, EMBASE, Cochrane Central Register of Controlled Trials, CINAHL, and reference lists of retrieved articles. We included studies that evaluated the amount of dietary gluten or the concentrations of gluten in food products that can be tolerated by people with coeliac disease whatever their design, method or language of publication. RESULTS: Thirteen studies (three randomized controlled, one cohort, two crossover, and seven cross-sectional) met the inclusion criteria. The daily amount of tolerable gluten varied widely between studies. Whilst some patients tolerated an average of 34-36 mg of gluten per day, other patients who consumed about 10 mg of gluten per day developed mucosal abnormalities. The effect of the consumption of 'gluten-free' products with different degrees of gluten contamination was also inconsistent. CONCLUSIONS: The amount of tolerable gluten varies among people with coeliac disease. Although there is no evidence to suggest a single definitive threshold, a daily gluten intake of <10 mg is unlikely to cause significant histological abnormalities.},

   abstract = {BACKGROUND & AIMS: Autoimmune enteropathy is a rare cause of intractable diarrhea associated with circulating gut autoantibodies and a predisposition to autoimmunity. It is rarely observed in adults, with only 11 cases reported to date. METHODS: Fifteen adults with autoimmune enteropathy were identified at the Mayo Clinic, Rochester, from May 2001-June 2006. The demographic, clinical, and treatment data were abstracted from their records. RESULTS: The study population was 87% white, 47% female, with median age of 55 years (interquartile range, 42-67 years). All patients had protracted diarrhea, weight loss, and malnutrition. Celiac disease was excluded by lack of response to gluten-free diet or absence of the celiac disease susceptibility HLA genotypes. Fourteen patients were tested for gut epithelial cell antibodies, and 93% were positive for anti-enterocyte and/or anti-goblet cell antibodies. Predisposition to autoimmune diseases was noted in 80%, as indicated by a variety of circulating autoantibodies. Small intestinal histopathologic findings included subtotal villous atrophy and lymphoplasmacytic infiltration in the lamina propria with relatively few surface intraepithelial lymphocytes. T-cell receptor gene rearrangement studies were negative in all cases. Immunosuppressive therapy was required in 93% of cases. Clinical improvement was noted in 60% after 1-8 weeks of steroid therapy. CONCLUSIONS: Autoimmune enteropathy is a heterogeneous disease and should be considered in the differential diagnosis of malabsorption and small bowel villous atrophy. The presence of gut epithelial cell antibodies can help confirm the diagnosis. No single agent is unequivocally effective in inducing remission, and immunosuppressive therapy is required in most cases.},

   abstract = {BACKGROUND: Coeliac disease may be regarded as refractory disease (RCD) when symptoms persist or recur despite strict adherence to a gluten-free diet. RCD may be subdivided into types I and II with a phenotypically normal and aberrant intraepithelial T-cell population, respectively. RCD I seems to respond well to azathioprine/prednisone therapy. RCD II is usually resistant to any known therapy and transition into enteropathy-associated T-cell lymphoma (EATL) is common. AIM: To provide further insight into RCD and the development of EATL, by reporting on long-term survival and risk of transition of RCD into EATL in a large cohort of patients with complicated coeliac disease. DESIGN AND METHODS: Retrospective comparison of responses to therapy in four groups of patients with complicated coeliac disease: 43, RCD I; 50, RCD II (total), of whom 26 with RCD II developed EATL after a period of refractoriness to a gluten-free diet (secondary EATL) and 13 were EATL patients without preceding history of complicated coeliac disease (de novo EATL). RESULTS: No coeliac-disease-related mortality was recognised in the RCD I group. The overall 5-year survival in the RCD I group it was 96%; in the RCD II (total) group was 58%; and in the RCD II group after developing EATL it was only 8%. The 2-year survival in the de novo EATL group was 20% versus 15% in secondary EATL group (p = 0.63). Twenty-eight (56%) of the 50 patients with RCD II died, 23 (46%) due to EATL, 4 due to a progressive refractory state with emaciation and 1 from neurocoeliac disease. CONCLUSION: Remarkably, no patient with RCD I developed RCD II or EATL within the mean follow-up period of 5 years (range 2-15 years). A total of 52% of the RCD II patients developed EATL within 4-6 years after the diagnosis of RCD II. More aggressive and targeted therapies seem necessary in RCD II and EATL.},

RCD may not respond primarily or secondarily to GFD. All other causes of malabsorption must be excluded and additional features supporting the diagnosis of CD must be looked for, including the presence of antibodies in the untreated state and the presence of celiac-related HLA-DQ markers. In contrast to patients with a high percentage of aberrant T-cells, patients with RCD I seem to profit from an immunosuppressive treatment. RCD II is usually resistant to medical therapies. Response to corticosteroid treatment does not exclude underlying enteropathy-associated T-cell lymphoma. Cladribine seems to have a role, although it is less than optimal in the treatment of these patients. It may be considered, however, as the only treatment thus far studied that showed significant reduction of aberrant T cells, seems to be well tolerated, and may have beneficial long-term effects in a subgroup of patients showing significant reduction of the aberrant T-cell population. Autologous stem cell transplantation (ASCT) seems promising in those patients with persisting high percentages of aberrant T cells. The first group of patients treated with ASCT showed improvement in the small intestinal histology, together with an impressive clinical improvement. However, it remains to be proven if this therapy delays or prevents lymphoma development.},

   abstract = {True Refractory Coeliac Disease (RCD) is being currently defined as persisting or recurring villous atrophy with crypt hyperplasia and increased intraepithelial lymphocytes in spite of a strict gluten free diet for more than 12 months or when severe persisting symptoms necessitate intervention independent of the duration of the dietary therapy. Currently two categories of RCD are being recognized: type I without aberrant T-cells and type II with aberrant T-cells detected by immunophenotyping by flowcytometric analysis or immunohistology of the intestinal mucosa. Establishing the diagnosis of RCD requires exclusion of other causes of villous atrophy and malignancies that may complicate coeliac disease. In contrast to patients with a high percentage of aberrant T cells, patients with RCD type I seem to profit from an immunosuppressive treatment. In cases of RCD II with persistent clinical symptoms and/or high percentage of aberrant T cells in intestinal biopsies in spite of a corticosteroid treatment, more aggressive therapeutic schemes should be considered. However, no therapy seems to be curative in RCD II. Cladribine (2-CDA) seems to have some role in the management of these patients. More recently, high dose chemotherapy followed by autologous stem cell transplantation has been used in patients resulting in a dramatic improvement in the clinical, laboratory, histopathological and immunological parameters. This review provides an overview of the currently available diagnostic and therapeutic methods in a complicated form of coeliac disease.},

   abstract = {OBJECTIVE: To present a case that illustrates the importance of considering asymptomatic celiac disease (CD) as a possible underlying cause in some cases of normocalcemic primary hyperparathyroidism. METHODS: We describe the clinical presentation, management, and outcome of a case of severe primary hyperparathyroidism manifesting with normocalcemia, likely attributable to the presence of asymptomatic CD. RESULTS: A 24-year-old woman presented with a 5-year history of generalized weakness, which had progressed until use of a wheelchair became necessary. She also had sustained low-trauma fragility fractures of the right tibia and left femur. She had no symptoms suggestive of CD. Physical examination revealed severe proximal myopathy. Laboratory data (and reference ranges) were as follows: serum calcium, 2.34 mmol/L (2.1 to 2.6); phosphorus, 0.91 mmol/L (0.90 to 1.50); alkaline phosphatase, 421 U/L (40 to 135); albumin, 37 g/L (35 to 45); parathyroid hormone, 874 ng/L (15 to 65); urine calcium, 3.76 mmol/d (2.5 to 8); and 25-hydroxyvitamin D, <13 nmol/L (22 to 116). She was treated with increasing doses of calcitriol, ergocalciferol, and calcium carbonate, but the serum calcium concentration did not increase substantially (reaching a maximum of 2.70 mmol/L on suprapharmacologic doses of these agents). Malabsorption was considered as an explanation for this apparent resistance to these medications. The result of antibody screening for CD was highly positive, and a distal duodenal biopsy confirmed the diagnosis of CD. A technetium Tc 99m sestamibi scan revealed uptake in the neck that was consistent with a single parathyroid adenoma, which was surgically removed. Treatment with a gluten-free diet, calcium carbonate, and ergocalciferol yielded remarkable clinical, biochemical, and radiologic improvement. CONCLUSION: Asymptomatic CD may be the underlying cause for some cases of normocalcemic primary hyperparathyroidism, and it should be considered in this setting.},

   abstract = {UNLABELLED: Clinical, serological and histological remission in celiac disease is strictly related to long life complete exclusion of gluten from the diet. Because celiac disease is an autoimmune systemic disorder the potential complications include a wide spectrum with two severe long-term morbidities: osteoporosis and malignancy. Gluten free diet, easy to be recommended, is difficult to be followed. This study aimed at evaluating the diagnostic criteria and dietary instruction, quality of life issues, impact of the gluten free diet on the celiac patient. MATERIAL AND METHOD: 250 patients (mean age at diagnosis 18.18 years) on gluten-free diet were asked to fill out a disease specific questionnaire. RESULTS: The response rate was 58.4% (mean age at diagnosis 11 years); 7% had no biopsy proven diagnosis (being excluded) and 28.26% had only antigliadin antibodies tested as serology method; 84.78% had typical digestive symptoms at diagnosis; 28.2% had been followed up after the diagnosis; information about the disease and diet have been provided exclusively by the gastroenterologist in 95.6% of the responders, 45.6% considering the information insufficient. The gluten free products were considered in 73.9% of cases too expensive for the family income, with low availability, lack of variety and unclear labeling; 48.8% reported impaired access to certain activities (social events, traveling) and even having difficulties to be accepted for some jobs. CONCLUSIONS: There is evidence that an educational program is needed to improve knowledge on the atypical forms of disease, diagnostic criteria and tools. The quality of life would be improved by support groups for patients, improved availability, better prices and food labeling.},

   abstract = {Public anxiety over gluten has fuelled widespread demand for gluten-free food, yet coeliac disease remains significantly underdiagnosed and some confusion remains regarding optimal diagnostic practices. Small bowel histology is the gold standard for diagnosis. High-quality commercial enzyme-linked immunosorbent assays for transglutaminase immunoglobulin A and deamidated gliadin immunoglobulin A and G are sensitive tools for screening, but almost 10% of coeliac disease is seronegative and serological testing is unreliable in the very young, in people already following a gluten-reduced diet, and those using immunosuppressive medications. HLA DQA and DQB genotyping to show that alleles encoding HLA DQ2 and DQ8 are absent virtually excludes coeliac disease. Confirming histological remission reduces the risks of later complications, such as osteoporosis and cancer. Monitoring remission by serology is unreliable. Because gluten is an exogenous antigen and the small intestine is readily accessible, the immunopathogenesis of coeliac disease is better understood than other strongly major histocompatibility complex class II-associated diseases, such as type 1 diabetes mellitus. Therapeutic targets have been identified and drugs are under development to supplement or even replace gluten-free diet. With greater awareness and non-dietary therapeutics, diagnosis and treatment of coeliac disease will be increasingly prominent in medical practice.},

About thirty international specialists were invited to share their experience and thoughts covering the main topics of: A) pancreatic diabetes (type 3c); B) chronic inflammation of the pancreas. The presentations of session A covered an overview about the frequency of exocrine dysfunction in diabetes mellitus, the relation between diabetes, celiac disease and the exocrine pancreas, the prevalence of type 3c diabetes, damage to the pancreas caused by genes, the role of incretins in type 2 and type 3 diabetes, the role of exocrine tissue in beta cell homeostasis, peculiarities in the treatment of type 3c diabetes and a lecture on incretins: from concept to treatment. Session B included presentations about the frequency of chronic inflammation of the pancreas and therapeutical implications, the role of ACE in the pancreas, genomics and the metabolic hypothesis of chronic pancreatitis, nutritional aspects of pancreatic diseases, the stellate cell concept, autoimmunity, genetic background of chronic pancreatitis and the hypothesis of chronic obstruction induced by gallstone disease. The meeting resulted in several new projects that will be started by the participants in the near future.},

   abstract = {Bread is a traditional food generally prepared from wheat flour. The main wheat component responsible for bread quality is gluten, which is an essential structure-binding protein. Although important, this protein can cause health problems in predisposed individuals, and is avoided in the diet of celiac disease patients. As diagnosis methods are improved, revealing the high incidence of gluten-intolerance in the western world, the demand for novel, nutritious and high-quality gluten-free foods also ascends. However, for the production of gluten-free breads the absence of gluten is critical and challenging in regards to the bread structure. Various gluten-free formulations have applied hydrocolloids to mimic the viscoelastic properties of gluten. They comprise a number of water-soluble polysaccharides with varied chemical structures providing a range of functional properties that make them suitable to this application. This paper reviews some actual facts about celiac disease and focuses on the reported applications of hydrocolloids in gluten-free breads.},

   abstract = {BACKGROUND: Screening for celiac disease (CD) in children with diabetes is controversial because no studies have demonstrated metabolic complications in asymptomatic, seropositive subjects or beneficial effects of dietary intervention. OBJECTIVE: We hypothesized that seropositivity to celiac antigens is associated with decreased growth and bone mineralization in asymptomatic diabetic children. DESIGN/METHODS: Asymptomatic diabetic children were screened for seropositivity to tissue transglutaminase. Villous atrophy was assessed by small bowel biopsy in a subset of seropositive subjects. We compared measures of growth and bone mineralization in 30 seropositive subjects, and 34 matched seronegative controls. RESULTS: Relative to seronegative controls, the seropositive subjects had reductions in insulin-like growth factor (IGF) binding protein 3 z scores (p < 0.05) and bone mineral density (BMD) z scores (p = 0.05). Weight, body mass index, IGF-I, and bone mineral apparent density (BMAD) z scores were marginally lower, but height z scores were comparable. Seropositive patients with severe villous atrophy had lower weight (-0.91 SDs), height (-1.1 SDs), BMD (-2.0 SDs), and BMAD (-2.0 SDs) z scores and significant increases in parathyroid hormone (all p < 0.05). Four patients with severe villous atrophy maintained strict gluten restriction for at least 12 months. Gluten restriction increased BMD and BMAD z scores. CONCLUSIONS: High-titer seropositivity to celiac antigens is associated with reductions in weight and BMD in diabetic children, justifying screening of high-risk patients. Results suggest that biopsy is required to confirm the diagnosis and assess the severity of CD; those with severe villous atrophy are more likely to have growth failure and osteopenia. Gluten restriction may reverse these complications.},

   abstract = {BACKGROUND: Immunoglobulin A (IgA) autoantibodies to tissue transglutaminase (tTG) are commonly used for screening and diagnosing of celiac disease (CD). Seroreactivity for anti-Saccharomyces cerevisiae antibody (ASCA) and bacterial antigens have also been detected in CD patients. The aim of this study was to examine prospectively serologic responses to microbial targets in adult CD patients at the time of diagnosis and during a gluten-free diet (GFD). Further, we wanted to evaluate whether these serologic specificities could provide new tools for the follow-up of CD patients. METHODS: Data on 55 adult biopsy-proven CD patients were available for follow-up study. Upper gastrointestinal endoscopy was performed on all patients. Sera from patients were tested for antibodies to tTG and ASCA and additionally analyzed with IgA enzyme-linked immunosorbent assays to Pseudomonas fluorescens-associated sequence, I2, and to a Bacteroides caccae TonB-linked outer membrane protein, OmpW. RESULTS: At the time of diagnosis, 91% of CD cases were positive for tTG and 49% for ASCA; positive seroreactivity to I2 was found in 86% and to OmpW in 60% of CD patients at the time of diagnosis. The frequency of seropositivity and serum levels of these antibodies decreased during GFD. Moreover, we found that the decline in the serum levels was significant in all of these markers (p < 0.005). Interestingly, we also found that serum levels of ASCA correlated with the grade of mucosal morphology (p = 0.021), as the ASCA serum levels declined in accordance with mucosal healing. CONCLUSIONS: Commensal enteric bacteria seem to play a role in the small intestinal mucosal damage in CD. This was proven by the serological responses to different microbial antigens shown in this study. Serum levels of ASCA, anti-I2, and anti-OmpW antibodies decreased significantly during GFD, indicating that these serologic markers are gluten dependent in CD patients. These specificities could provide new tools in the follow-up of CD patients.},

   abstract = {This study involved all children with celiac disease admitted and seen in the Paediatric Gastroenterology Clinic at King Khalid University Hospital (KKUH) over a 10-year period. In the first year, we identified 62 cases with celiac disease. Their mean age at presentation, introduction to cereals in the diet, and onset of symptoms were 6.5, 6 and 6 months, respectively, and most of the children belonged to the indigenous population. There were three Arabia families with more than one affected child and most families were of good social status. The main symptoms noted were diarrhoea in 34 (57%), growth failure in 47 (74.6%), abdominal distension in 21 (33%), and vomiting in 14 patients (14%). The significant physical signs at the time of presentation were short stature, seen in 44 patients (69.8%), pallor in 25 (40.3%) and abdominal distention in 21 (33%). The mean haemoglobin, serum feritin, serum folate, calcium, and serum albumin were 10.25 g/dL, 2.49 g/mL, 0.25 ng/mL, 8.86 mg/dL, and 3.7 g/dL. The mean anti-reticulin IgG, anti-endomyseal IgG, IgA and anti-gliadin IgG, IgA were one in 246, 332, 720, 121 and 300 units. There was total villous atrophy in each patient at the time of initial presentation; repeat small bowel biopsies were done in 12 patients of whom 6, 4 and 2 had normal villi, partial villous atrophy and subtotal villous atrophy, respectively. A third biopsy was performed in 2 patients while on gluten containing diet, which revealed villous atrophy. Most of the children improved on gluten-free diet.},

   abstract = {The gastrointestinal tract is controlled by the independent enteric nervous system. It is also closely connected to the central nervous system, and bi-directional communication exists between them. The communication involves neural pathways as well as immune and endocrine mechanisms. The brain-gut axis plays a prominent role in the modulation of gut functions. Signals from different sources (e.g. sound, sight, smell, somatic and visceral sensations, pain) reach the brain. These inputs are modified by memory, cognition and affective mechanisms and integrated within the neural circuits of the central nervous system, spinal cord, autonomic and enteral nervous systems. These inputs can have physiologic effects, such as changes in motility, secretion, immune function, and blood flow to the gastrointestinal tract. One of the most important neurotransmitters is serotonin that plays a key role in the pathogenesis of the most common chronic functional gastrointestinal disorder: the irritable bowel syndrome. It is a biopsychosocial disease, resulting from the dysregulation of the brain-gut axis. Endogenous pain facilitation rather than inhibition, pathologic gradation of visceral perception and reduced threshold for pain are all evident in these patients. Abuse history is common in their anamnesis. Exaggerated conscientiousness, perfectionism, oversensitivity, feeling of deficiency in effectiveness, and higher demand for social parity, neuroticism and alexithymia have been detected among their constant personality features. Females are also characterized by gender role conflict and low assertiveness. Antidepressants and psychotherapy have important roles in their treatment. Also patients with inflammatory bowel disease are characterized by neuroticism and alexithymia and altered mother-child attachment is often described in their anamnesis. Autonomic neuropathy is a frequent and early neurological complication. Reflux disease and obstructive sleep apnea mutually generate each other and their severities significantly correlate. In the celiac disease the most common neurological manifestations are ataxia, peripheral neuropathy and myopathy. Up to 85% of patients with histologically proven coeliac disease have no gastrointestinal symptoms; consequently, measurement of antigliadin antibody titre is therefore vital in all cases of idiopathic ataxia. Complete resolution of neurological symptoms is the result of gluten-free diet.},

   abstract = {OBJECTIVE: To analyze the prevalence of Helicobacter pylori (H. pylori) infection in children with celiac disease (CD) and to examine the role of H. pylori infection in clinical, laboratory and histopathological presentations of CD. MATERIAL AND METHODS: Data on 96 children with CD and 235 children who underwent endoscopy were compared for the prevalence and gastric histology pattern of H. pylori. Clinical presentation, laboratory and histological findings of CD children with and without H. pylori infection were compared. RESULTS: Twenty-one subjects (21.8%) in the CD group and 56 subjects (23.8%) in the control group had H. pylori gastritis. Gastric metaplasia is higher in CD patients with H. pylori gastritis (19%) than in patients without H. pylori gastritis (1.3%) and in the control group (3.5%) (p<0.05 for all groups). Abdominal distension is more common at initial admission in CD patients with H. pylori gastritis (57.1% versus 14.6%, p<0.05). No significant difference was found between H. pylori (+) and (-) CD patients in terms of prevalence of anemia, iron deficiency and iron-deficiency anemia. Only mild duodenal histological findings were more common in H. pylori patients (57.1% versus 26.7%, p<0.05). CONCLUSIONS: CD may be associated with H. pylori gastritis, but it does not affect the clinical presentation of the disease, except for abdominal distension; CD is associated with mild duodenal lesions. A gluten-free diet improves the symptoms in all patients independently of the presence of H. pylori gastritis. Gastric metaplasia increases in the presence of H. pylori gastritis. Further prospective studies are needed to examine the clinical and histopathological outcomes of gastric metaplasia associated with H. pylori gastritis in CD patients.},

   abstract = {We sought to analyze the long-term growth in children with celiac disease (CD) as well as the association of height and weight SD score at the end of 4 years with the demographic and clinical presentation at initial admission. Thirty-four children with CD were enrolled in the study and followed for at least 4 years. Patients were divided into three groups (Group 1: patients <or=5 years old, Group 2: patients 5-10 years old, and Group 3: patients >10 years, at the time of diagnosis). Patients' charts were reviewed for demographic and clinical features at initial admission. Anthropometric measurements at initial admission, at 6th months, and 1st, 2nd, 3rd, and 4th years were recorded. Gluten-free diet led to rapid increase in weight SD and height SD score in patients <or=5 years old at the time of diagnosis (Group 1). Increment in height SD score was the highest in patients 5-10 years old (Group 2) at the end of 4 years. A negative correlation was found between age at the time of diagnosis and weight and height SD score at the end of 4 years (r = -0.503, P = 0.03 and r = -0.554, P = 0.01). Multiple regression analysis revealed that height SD score at the end of the 4 years was associated with age at the time of diagnosis. The other factors had no effect on the weight and height SD score at the end of 4 years. Early diagnosis and good adhesion to a gluten-free diet are essential for long-term growth in CD. Celiac societies and the mass media must expand an effort to educate the community regarding the symptoms of the disease.},

DESIGN: Cross-sectional study. PLACE AND DURATION OF STUDY: Gastroenterology Unit of Sindh Institute of Urology and Transplantation (SIUT), from January 2002 to January 2004. PATIENTS AND METHODS: Forty nine children and adolescents with PD (defined as diarrhea greater than 14 days duration) and / or FTT (based on anthropometrical indicators, i.e. weight for length below the 5th centile) were included in the study. Demographic data, weaning practices, breast feeding and family history of CD were documented. Laboratory workup included tissue transglutaminase antibody IgA (tTGA), IgA and IgG antigliadin antibodies (IgA AGA and IgG AGA), HLA typing, upper gastrointestinal endoscopy (EGD) with distal duodenal biopsy (where allowed by parents) and anthropometric data. CD diagnosis was in accordance with the "Guidelines for the diagnosis of and treatment of CD for children" by NASPGHAN. Mann-Whitney U-test, Chi-square test and Fisher's exact test were used for analysis as applicable. RESULTS: Forty nine patients (25 [51%] males) with FTT and or PD were included. The mean (+/-SD) age, height, weight and BMI were: 10.1+/-6.2 years (range, 1-20 years), 107.0 +/- 31.7 cm (45-180 cm), 19.04 +/- 12.5 kg (3-68 kg) and 16.12+/-12.58 kg/cm2 respectively. FTT was present in 30 (61%) patients. Thirty four (69%) children had a history of PD, 38 (77%) had a significant history of weight loss and 32 (65%) children had short stature. Majority of the children (88%) were breast fed. Weaning was started at 6 months of age in 40% and included mixed diet according to age. Protuberant abdomen was present in 26 (53%). Elevated tTGA was significantly (p < 0.001) more frequent in patients with CD. HLA-DQ2 and DQ8 haplotypes were positive in 18 (60%) of these patients. Thirty (61%) patients were positive for CD based on Marsh criteria. CD diagnosis was supported by positive tTGA and/ or AGA tests. Majority i.e. 28/30 patients had Marsh stage 3 disease, while 22/30 patients with CD also had PD. Four CD patients were found to suffer from protein calorie malnutrition (PCM). CONCLUSION: Children who fail to thrive with or without PD may have CD. A positive tTGA test in these children is a useful aid in making a CD diagnosis. Majority of CD positive children were found to carry HLA DQ2 or DQ8 genes. Thus, HLA typing could be used to determine genetic disposition to CD. Majority of FTT had Marsh stage 3 changes on histopathology.},

AIM: In this case report the authors emphasize the importance of histopathology in the diagnosis of refractory sprue. METHODS: The sequential biopsies from this patient have been investigated with routine histology, immunohistochemistry and molecular genetics for T-cell clonality analysis. RESULTS: The severely cachectic patient presenting with malabsorption syndrome has been diagnosed with celiac disease through a duodenal biopsy, and the CD8 negativity of the intraepithelial lymphocytes suggested the possible diagnosis of refractory sprue. Azathioprine and glucocorticoid therapy was administered due to the failed jejunal feeding and gluten-free diet, resulting in clinically complete, morphologically partial remission. Intestinal T-cell lymphoma developed in the ileocecal region within two years after the first clinical presentation. DISCUSSION: Refractory sprue and the enteropathy-type T-cell lymphoma constitute a disease spectrum. The reported case shows how a simple method can provide crucial information in the diagnosis of refractory sprue.},

According to established diagnosis of tubulointerstitial nephritis, she was treated with pulse doses of steroid therapy. After temporary improvement, she had dissemination of the disease. On MRI, small intestinal wall was thickened, and abdominal lymph nodes were enlarged with extraluminal compression of common bile duct. Laparotomy with mesenterial lymph node biopsy and consecutive pathohistological and immunohistochemical analyses revealed the diagnosis of EATCL. The patient received chemotherapy, but she died with signs of pulmonary embolization. The third patient was 53 year-old woman without previous history of GSE. Diagnosis of EATCL was revealed after the resection of jejunum because of small intestinal obstruction. She received two cycles of chemotherapy, but she died with signs of disease progression. IgA antiendomysial antibodies were detected in the serum of all patients. The overall survival of patients was 7 months.The possibility of lymphoma rising in patients with clinical progression of GSE despite gluten free diet must be kept in mind.},

   abstract = {Celiac disease is a digestive disease, considered as an autoimmune disorder, that damages the small intestine and interferes with absorption of nutrients. Individuals affected by celiac disease cannot tolerate a protein called gluten, present in wheat, rye, and barley, but also in other common products such as stamp and envelope adhesive, medicines, and vitamins. Celiac disease is a genetic condition that is triggered--or becomes active for the first time--after surgery, pregnancy, childbirth, viral infection, or severe emotional stress. Symptoms may occur in the digestive system, or in other parts of the body. Diagnosis involves blood tests and a biopsy of the small intestine. Recent findings estimate that about 2 million people in the United States have celiac disease, or about 1 in 133 people, as in Europe. Recent studies have shown that it may be more common in Africa, South America, and Asia than previously believed. The only treatment for celiac disease is to follow a gluten-free diet. Various other approaches are being studied that would reduce the need of dieting. One of those promising new approaches involves treating celiac patients with AT-1001, a paracellular permeability inhibitor, and with R-spondin1, a recombinant, secreted protein that early animal studies have shown to act as a highly specific stimulator of the gastrointestinal (GI) epithelial cells.},

Hypertransaminasemia has been observed in up to 40% of untreated celiac patients and is usually resolved by a gluten-free diet. The most common type of liver disease associated with CD is non-specific reactive hepatitis, while association with viral hepatitis or autoimmune-mediated liver diseases such as autoimmune hepatitis, primary biliary cirrhosis or primary sclerosing cholangitis is less frequent. Therefore, a practical recommendation would be to look for liver disfunction in patients with CD as well as to perform diagnostic tests for CD in patients with hypertransaminasemia or cholestasis of unknown etiology.},

   abstract = {AIMS: To assess the histological response to a gluten-free diet (GFD) in a series of coeliac patients in clinical remission, of different ages and with varying degrees of mucosal damage at diagnosis. METHODS AND RESULTS: Biopsy samples from 249 coeliac patients (F 165, M 84) were analysed basally and after clinical and biochemical remission following a GFD. All patients showed an improvement in mucosal findings after starting a GFD, but complete histological normalization was observed in 74.1% of paediatric cases (diagnosed before 14 years of age) and in only 17.5% of adults. Statistical analysis showed that sex, the clinical picture at diagnosis and the length of time between biopsy at the time of diagnosis and on a GFD were not related to histological normalization. In contrast, the age at diagnosis was statistically significantly related to it (P < 0.0001). In addition, the presence/absence of Helicobacter pylori was independent of the normalization of the duodenal mucosa. CONCLUSIONS: In clinical practice the criteria for diagnosis of coeliac disease are sufficiently standardized, whereas for follow-up they are less well defined. We suggest that in order to compare the results from different studies, it should be stated whether remission after treatment is based on clinical or histological criteria or both.},

   abstract = {The clinical spectrum of celiac disease continues to evolve. What was once thought to be a rare disorder affecting young children is now recognized to be very common with a range of symptoms from asymptomatic disease to severely affected persons. Screening for celiac disease has become relatively easily with reliable antibodies against self-antigens (TG) and modified environmental antigens (DGP). Diagnosis is confirmed by small intestinal biopsy with characteristic changes graded by the Marsh score. Elimination of gluten from the diet has been the standard of care for the last half century. Patients often have difficulty adhering to a gluten-free diet, and the failure of symptoms, antibody levels, or pathologic changes to improve after initiating the diet may be largely due to this difficulty. The genetic risk for celiac disease is largely related to HLA genotypes, with over 90% of subjects with celiac disease positive for DQ2 and the remainder positive for DQ8. The HLA association with celiac disease is largely accountable for its link to other autoimmune diseases, including type 1 diabetes and autoimmune thyroid disease, and the majority of risk for celiac disease in these populations is related to HLA genotype. Celiac disease also carries an increased risk for type 1 diabetes and autoimmune thyroid disease. Genetic syndromes such as Turner and Down syndromes are associated with an increased risk for celiac disease. Practitioners can identify groups of subjects at high risk for celiac disease and perform screening with celiac disease-related antibodies.},

   abstract = {BACKGROUND: Coeliac disease is a small intestine enteropathy caused by permanent intolerance to wheat gluten. Gluten intake by patients with coeliac disease provokes a strong reaction by intestinal intraepithelial lymphocytes (IELs), which normalises on a gluten-free diet. AIM: To investigate whether impaired extrathymic T cell maturation and/or secondary T cell receptor (TCR) gene recombination in IELs are features of coeliac disease which could contribute to the failure of establishing tolerance to gluten. METHODS: Expression levels of the four splice-forms of recombination activating gene-1 (RAG1) mRNA and preT alpha-chain (preTalpha) mRNA were determined in IEL-subsets of children with coeliac disease and controls. Frequencies of RAG1 expressing IELs were determined by immunomorphometry. RESULTS: In controls, the RAG1-1A/2 splice-form selectively expressed outside the thymus, was dominant and expressed in both mature (TCR(+)) and immature (CD2(+)CD7(+)TCR(-)) IELs ( approximately 8 mRNA copies/18S rRNA U). PreTalpha was expressed almost exclusively in CD2(+)CD7(+)TCR(-) IELs ( approximately 40 mRNA copies/18S rRNA U). By contrast, RAG1 and preTalpha mRNA levels were low in patients with coeliac disease compared to controls, both with active disease and with inactive, symptom-free disease on a gluten-free diet (p values <0.01 for mature and <0.05 for immature IELs). Similarly, the frequencies of RAG1+ IELs were significantly lower in patients with coeliac disease compared to controls (p<0.001). CONCLUSIONS: Patients with coeliac disease appear to have an impaired capacity for extrathymic TCR gene rearrangement. This is an inherent feature, which probably plays a pivotal role in the failure to efficiently downregulate the T cell response to gluten.},

   abstract = {BACKGROUND: AGA IgA II and AGA IgG II have recently been suggested as reliable tools for celiac disease (CD) diagnosis. We compared their utility for diagnosis and monitoring CD in children with that of tTG IgA, an established CD marker. METHODS: We studied a cohort of 161 CD and 129 control children in whom CD was histologically confirmed or ruled out. We followed 37 children with CD on a gluten-free diet for 12-84 months. In fasting sera, we measured AGA IgA II, AGA IgG II, and tTG IgA using ELISAs. RESULTS: The best sensitivity (92.5%), specificity (97.6%), positive predictive value (98%), and negative predictive value (91.2%) were obtained using tTG IgA. AGA IgG II correctly identified 3 of 3 children with CD with total IgA deficiency who had negative AGA IgA II and tTG IgA results. In children <2 years old without total IgA deficiency, AGA IgG II and tTG IgA performed equally well (sensitivity 96.4% and specificity 100%). AGA IgA II, AGA IgG II, and tTG IgA concentrations diminished significantly (P < 0.0001) after 1 year of a gluten-free diet, reaching values below the cutoff in 87%, 70%, and 51% of cases, respectively. CONCLUSIONS: The best available index for diagnosing CD in children was tTG IgA. In infants <2 years old, AGA IgG II performed as well as tTG IgA in cases without total IgA deficiency and allowed detection of CD when total IgA was <0.06 g/L. Gluten-free diet monitoring can be achieved using any of the studied serum markers.},

However, it is not known if these abnormalities persist after the introduction of a gluten-free diet. The present study aimed to compare antroduodenojejunal motor variables recorded in untreated celiac patients with those of celiac patients given a gluten-free diet and healthy volunteers. METHODS: Eleven untreated celiac disease patients, 12 age- and sex-matched celiac patients on a gluten-free diet (at least 12 months), and 33 controls entered the study. Antroduodenojejunal motility was recorded for 6 h during fasting and for 3 h after a standard meal by means of a perfused, multiple lumen catheter. RESULTS: More than 80% of untreated celiac patients had discrete motor abnormalities of the upper gut, in both fasting and fed recordings, compared to the other subjects. Patients on a gluten-free diet also showed motor abnormalities, albeit to a lesser extent. In these patients histological evaluation showed the persistence of mild mucosal abnormalities. CONCLUSIONS: Upper gut motor abnormalities are frequent in patients with celiac disease, even in those on a gluten-free diet. In the latter group, these abnormalities may suggest an incomplete adherence to the dietary regimen.},

   abstract = {BACKGROUND: Anemia due to hematinic deficiencies is common in patients with untreated celiac disease. Although celiac disease is a chronic condition characterized by an intense inflammatory response of the intestinal mucosa, scant data are available about the prevalence of anemia of chronic disease in celiac disease. DESIGN AND METHODS: One hundred and fifty-two patients with celiac disease at presentation were studied. Anemia was investigated by determining complete blood counts, body iron status, serum levels of the soluble transferrin receptor, erythropoietin, prohepcidin and interferon-gamma. Genotyping for HFE mutations associated with hereditary hemochromatosis was performed. Fifty-three anemic patients were re-evaluated for hematologic response after 1 year on a gluten-free diet. RESULTS: At the time of diagnosis of celiac disease the prevalence of anemia was 34%. Fifty-three out of 65 anemic patients had either iron and/or vitamin deficiency (folate, vitamin B(12)). Hereditary hemochromatosis mutations did not affect the prevalence of anemia. In 11 cases iron status parameters were indicative of anemia of chronic disease, sometimes in association with iron deficiency (6 patients). Patients with anemia of chronic disease had low levels of erythropoietin for the degree of anemia and increased serum interferon-gamma. In most cases anemia improved following a gluten-free diet, response rates being similar in anemia of chronic disease and in anemia due to hematinic deficiencies. CONCLUSIONS: Our study shows that, in addition to iron and vitamin deficiencies, anemia of chronic disease has a significant role in some patients with celiac disease. Suppression of intestinal inflammatory changes as a result of a gluten-free diet improves anemia by correcting iron and vitamin malabsorption as well as mechanisms contributing to anemia of chronic disease.},

   abstract = {Celiac disease is a prevalent disorder of the small intestine that is caused by an inflammatory reaction to dietary gluten in genetically susceptible individuals. More than 90% of patients express the HLA-DQ2 molecule, whereas DQ8 is carried by most of the remaining patients. DQ2- and DQ8-mediated presentation of gluten peptides to CD4+ T cells is a key event in the pathogenesis of the disease. The association of celiac disease with these human leukocyte antigen (HLA) molecules is explained by a preferential binding of gluten peptides to these HLA molecules, although the actual data on this in the literature are scarce. The objective of this study was to test this hypothesis. A panel of peptides representing DQ2-restricted gluten T-cell epitopes was tested for binding to various HLA class II molecules using various experimental approaches. The results demonstrate that the gluten T-cell epitopes mainly bind to the DQ2 molecule.},

   abstract = {The IL-15 triggering effect of gliadin is not exclusive to coeliac disease (CD) patients, whereas the secondary response is CD specific. We have studied the expression of the IL-15 receptor, and the IL-15 response upon stimulation, in non-CD and CD patients, and the possible existence of a lower immunological threshold in the latter. Forty-two CD patients (20 on a gluten-containing diet, GCD, and 22 on gluten-free diet, GFD) and 24 non-CD healthy individuals were studied. IL15R alpha mRNA expression, and tissue characterization, were assayed in the duodenum. Biopsies from six CD patients on GFD and 10 non-CD individuals were studied in vitro using organ culture in basal conditions, as well as after IL-15 stimulation discarding basal IL-15 production. Secretion of immune mediators was measured in the culture supernatants. IL15R alpha mRNA expression was increased in CD patients, as compared with non-CD controls (on GFD P = 0.0334, on GCD P = 0.0062, respectively), and confirmed also by immunofluorescence. No differences were found between CD patients on GFD and on GCD. After in vitro IL-15 stimulation, IL15R alpha expression was only triggered in non-CD controls (P = 0.0313), though it remained increased in CD patients. Moreover, IL-15 induced a more intense immunological response in CD patients after triggering the production of both nitrites and IFN gamma (P = 0.0313, P = 0.0313, respectively). Gliadin-induced IL15 has a lower response threshold in CD patients, leading to the production of other immune mediators and the development of the intestinal lesion, and thus magnifying its effects within the CD intestine.},

   abstract = {INTRODUCTION: A small proportion of coeliac disease (CD) patients become refractory (RCD) to a gluten-free diet (GFD) showing uncontrolled immune-mediated enteropathy. Some of these patients exhibit a high risk to develop enteropathy-associated T-cell lymphoma (EATL). AIM: The aim of the study was to find whether a lack of circulating homeostatic T cells, such as Treg, Tgammadelta(+) or iNKT cells would be associated with the development of RCD or EATL. PATIENTS AND METHODS: We investigated in a total of 137 CD patients [28 untreated, 80 responsive to GFD and 29 RCD (14 type I and 15 type II)] and 73 age-matched healthy volunteers the frequency of Treg, Tgammadelta(+) and iNKT lymphocytes by flow cytometric analysis of peripheral blood. RESULTS: Circulating Tgammadelta(+) cell and Treg frequencies in RCD were comparable to those in healthy controls. However, RCD patients had significantly reduced numbers of circulating iNKT cells, as compared to age-matched patients responding to a GFD. This reduction was similar in RCD patients with and without aberrant intraepithelial lymphocytes and in patients with EATL. Circulating iNKT cell numbers were not reduced in untreated coeliac patients. GFD treated patients had a significantly increased proportion of CD4(+) iNKT cells. CONCLUSION: Follow-up studies are necessary to determine whether CD4(+) iNKT cells control the immune response against gluten and their absence contributes to the progression to RCD and EATL.},

   abstract = {BACKGROUND AND AIMS: Gluten sensitivity is widespread among humans. For example, in celiac disease patients, an inflammatory response to dietary gluten leads to enteropathy, malabsorption, circulating antibodies against gluten and transglutaminase 2, and clinical symptoms such as diarrhea. There is a growing need in fundamental and translational research for animal models that exhibit aspects of human gluten sensitivity. METHODS: Using ELISA-based antibody assays, we screened a population of captive rhesus macaques with chronic diarrhea of non-infectious origin to estimate the incidence of gluten sensitivity. A selected animal with elevated anti-gliadin antibodies and a matched control were extensively studied through alternating periods of gluten-free diet and gluten challenge. Blinded clinical and histological evaluations were conducted to seek evidence for gluten sensitivity. RESULTS: When fed with a gluten-containing diet, gluten-sensitive macaques showed signs and symptoms of celiac disease including chronic diarrhea, malabsorptive steatorrhea, intestinal lesions and anti-gliadin antibodies. A gluten-free diet reversed these clinical, histological and serological features, while reintroduction of dietary gluten caused rapid relapse. CONCLUSIONS: Gluten-sensitive rhesus macaques may be an attractive resource for investigating both the pathogenesis and the treatment of celiac disease.},

   abstract = {Pathogens are exogenous agents capable of causing disease in susceptible organisms. In celiac sprue, a disease triggered by partially hydrolyzed gluten peptides in the small intestine, the offending immunotoxins cannot replicate, but otherwise have many hallmarks of classical pathogens. First, dietary gluten and its peptide metabolites are ubiquitous components of the modern diet, yet only a small, genetically susceptible fraction of the human population contracts celiac sprue. Second, immunotoxic gluten peptides have certain unusual structural features that allow them to survive the harsh proteolytic conditions of the gastrointestinal tract and thereby interact extensively with the mucosal lining of the small intestine. Third, they invade across epithelial barriers intact to access the underlying gut-associated lymphoid tissue. Fourth, they possess recognition sequences for selective modification by an endogenous enzyme, transglutaminase 2, allowing for in situ activation to a more immunotoxic form via host subversion. Fifth, they precipitate a T cell-mediated immune reaction comprising both innate and adaptive responses that causes chronic inflammation of the small intestine. Sixth, complete elimination of immunotoxic gluten peptides from the celiac diet results in remission, whereas reintroduction of gluten in the diet causes relapse. Therefore, in analogy with antibiotics, orally administered proteases that reduce the host's exposure to the immunotoxin by accelerating gluten peptide destruction have considerable therapeutic potential. Last but not least, notwithstanding the power of in vitro methods to reconstitute the essence of the immune response to gluten in a celiac patient, animal models for the disease, while elusive, are likely to yield fundamentally new systems-level insights.},

   abstract = {BACKGROUND AND AIMS: In a previous report, we characterized a condition of gluten sensitivity in juvenile rhesus macaques that is similar in many respects to the human condition of gluten sensitivity, celiac disease. This animal model of gluten sensitivity may therefore be useful toward studying both the pathogenesis and the treatment of celiac disease. Here, we perform two pilot experiments to demonstrate the potential utility of this model for studying intestinal permeability toward an immunotoxic gluten peptide and pharmacological detoxification of gluten in vivo by an oral enzyme drug candidate. METHODS: Intestinal permeability was investigated in age-matched gluten-sensitive and control macaques by using mass spectrometry to detect and quantify an orally dosed, isotope labeled 33-mer gluten peptide delivered across the intestinal epithelium to the plasma. The protective effect of a therapeutically promising oral protease, EP-B2, was evaluated in a gluten-sensitive macaque by administering a daily gluten challenge with or without EP-B2 supplementation. ELISA-based antibody assays and blinded clinical evaluations of this macaque and of an age-matched control were conducted to assess responses to gluten. RESULTS: Labeled 33-mer peptide was detected in the plasma of a gluten-sensitive macaque, both in remission and during active disease, but not in the plasma of healthy controls. Administration of EP-B2, but not vehicle, prevented clinical relapse in response to a dietary gluten challenge. Unexpectedly, a marked increase in anti-gliadin (IgG and IgA) and anti-transglutaminase (IgG) antibodies was observed during the EP-B2 treatment phase. CONCLUSIONS: Gluten-sensitive rhesus macaques may be an attractive resource for investigating important aspects of celiac disease, including enhanced intestinal permeability and pharmacology of oral enzyme drug candidates. Orally dosed EP-B2 exerts a protective effect against ingested gluten. Limited data suggest that enhanced permeability of short gluten peptides generated by gastrically active glutenases may trigger an elevated antibody response, but that these antibodies are not necessarily causative of clinical illness.},

   abstract = {Symptomatic hypogammaglobulinaemia in children younger than 2 years of age was studied to rule out a primary immunodeficiency. Thirty-four patients were referred to the Immunology Service to study the hypogammaglobulinaemia-associated clinical picture. Food allergy was documented in 10 patients by personal and familial history, presence of specific immunoglobulin E (IgE) and elevated total serum IgE levels. Coeliac disease and human immunodeficiency virus infection were also ruled out. Protein loss through stools was assessed by clearance of alpha1-antitrypsin (AAT). Serum immunoglobulin levels were determined by nephelometry and functional antibodies were studied by enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay. The cellular immune response was assessed by in vitro lymphocyte proliferation in response to mitogens and cell subsets were analysed by flow cytometry. In five patients of the 10 patients we suspected a protein loss through the mucosa. Four of these five patients showed an increased AAT and the other showed an extensive cutaneous lesion. Immunological studies revealed normal antibody function, in vitro lymphoproliferative responses and cell numbers in four of the 5 patients. One patient showed abnormally low numbers of CD4(+) T cells as well as a defective proliferative response to mitogens. After diagnosis of cow milk allergy, milk was replaced with infant milk formula containing hydrolysed proteins. Recovery of immunoglobulin values and clinical resolution were achieved. Hypogammaglobulinaemia during early childhood in some children may be secondary to cow milk allergy, and immunoglobulins and cells may leak through the inflamed mucosa. Resolution of symptoms as well as normalization of immunoglobulin values may be easily achieved by avoidance of the offending allergen.},

   abstract = {Intraepithelial lymphocytes (IELs) bearing the gammadelta TCR are more abundant in the small intestinal mucosa of patients with celiac disease (CD) compared with healthy individuals. However, their role in disease pathogenesis is not well understood. Here, we investigated the functional attributes of TCRgammadelta+ IELs isolated from intestinal biopsies of patients with either active celiac disease (ACD) or those on a gluten-free diet (GFD). We found that compared with individuals with ACD, individuals on GFD have a higher frequency of CD8+TCRgammadelta+ IELs that express the inhibitory NK receptor NKG2A and intracellular TGF-beta1. TCR triggering as well as cross-linking of NKG2A increased both TGF-beta1 intracellular expression and secretion in vitro. Coculture of sorted TCRgammadelta+NKG2A+ IELs, IL-15-stimulated TCRalphabeta+ IELs, and HLA-E+ enterocytes resulted in a decreased percentage of cytotoxic CD8+TCRalphabeta+ IELs expressing intracellular IFN-gamma and granzyme-B and surface NKG2D. This inhibition was partially abrogated by blocking either TGF-beta alone or both NKG2A and HLA-E. Thus, our data indicate that suppression was at least partially mediated by TGF-beta secretion as a result of engagement of NKG2A with its ligand, HLA-E, on enterocytes and/or TCRalphabeta+ IELs. These findings demonstrate that human small intestinal CD8+TCRgammadelta+ IELs may have regulatory potential in celiac disease.},

   abstract = {AIMS: Although they are non-specific, minimal intestinal lesions are at the end of the coeliac histological damage spectrum. To investigate whether minimal intestinal lesions in patients without endomysial antibodies are due to coeliac disease, their prevalence, causes and risk of evolving into frank coeliac disease were studied. METHODS: From January 2000 to December 2005, 645 duodenal biopsies were performed. In 209 patients, duodenal biopsies were performed independently of endomysial antibody results. Clinical data and HLA-typing of all the patients negative to endomysial antibodies but with minimal mucosal lesions were re-evaluated. Three years later, they were offered to be seen again, and further investigations were proposed. RESULTS: 14 out of 209 patients had minimal mucosal lesions and negative endomysial antibodies. Two patients were lost to follow-up; in 7/12 patients, symptoms and histological lesions were due to a different condition, not related to coeliac disease. In 11/12 patients, HLA-typing made diagnosis of coeliac disease very unlikely. Only one patient was on a gluten-free diet because of gluten-sensitive symptoms and was DQ2(+)/DQ8(+). CONCLUSIONS: Minimal duodenal lesions in patients negative to endomysial antibodies are rare and are likely to be due to conditions unrelated to coeliac disease.},

   abstract = {Chronic inflammation and malabsorption in celiac disease (CD) can cause bone metabolism alterations and bone mineral loss in children and adults. Bone status before and after gluten-free diet, epidemiology of fractures, and possible treatment options for CD-related osteoporosis are presented. Controversial aspects of this complication of CD are discussed. The relationship between bone derangements and celiac disease (CD) was recognized almost 50 years ago, but many questions are still open. We are now aware that osteoporosis is a relatively frequent atypical presentation of CD, especially in adults, and that undiagnosed CD can be the cause of osteoporosis and related fractures. Chronic inflammatory intestinal diseases, including CD, can affect bone and mineral metabolism because of alterations in both systemic and local regulatory factors. The pathogenetic processes are still controversial, but two main mechanisms seem to be involved: intestinal malabsorption and the presence of chronic inflammation. This review analyzes the published data on bone involvement in children, adolescents, and adults either before or after a gluten-free diet. Special attention is paid to the epidemiology of fractures in celiac patients, considering that fractures are a major complication of osteoporosis and an important problem in the management of a chronic disease like CD. The usefulness of screening osteoporotic patients systematically for CD is still an open question, but some rules can be given. Finally, the current treatment options for children and adults are discussed. Recommendations for future clinical research are proposed.},

   abstract = {BACKGROUND: Serum radioimmunoassay (RIA) tissue transglutaminase autoantibodies (tTG-Abs) proved to be a sensitive test also during coeliac disease (CD) follow-up. We demonstrated that RIA tTG-Abs could be detected in human saliva. AIM: To evaluate salivary RIA tTG-Abs in coeliac children on gluten-free diet (GFD). METHODS: Saliva and serum samples from 109 coeliac children were evaluated at diagnosis (group 1: 71 females, median age 9.4 years) and 58 of them on GFD: 36 after 3-6 months (group 2a), 34 at 9 months or more (group 2b). Two gender- and age-matched control groups: 89 gastroenterological patients (group 3) and 49 healthy subjects (group 4) participated in the study. Saliva and serum tTG-Abs were detected by RIA and compared with serum tTG-Abs ELISA and IgA anti-endomysium antibodies (EMA). RESULTS: Salivary RIA tTG-Abs were found in 94.5%, 66.7% and 50.0% of groups 1, 2a and 2b CD patients and in 98.2%, 72.2% and 50.0% of corresponding serum samples, respectively. tTG-Abs decreased with GFD progression and a correlation was found between saliva and serum titres (r = 0.75, P = 0.0001). During the CD follow-up, salivary and serum RIA sensitivities were comparable, and higher with respect to EMA and ELISA. CONCLUSIONS: This study demonstrates that it is possible to detect salivary tTG-Abs with high sensitivity not only at CD diagnosis, but also during GFD.},

   abstract = {OBJECTIVES: Celiac disease (CD)-related lesions have been reported in duodenal bulb biopsies, sometimes the bulb mucosa being the only one affected. The aim was to verify in a significant series whether histological lesions are always present in the bulb of celiac patients, what is the prevalence of lesions when isolated to the bulb, and if similar lesions are present in nonceliac subjects. METHODS: We studied 665 children with CD (241 males, range 9 months-15 years, 8 months), at diagnosis on a gluten-containing diet, and 348 age- and sex-matched gastroenterological controls submitted to upper endoscopy for gastroenterological complaints. During endoscopy, multiple biopsies (1 bulb and 4 distal duodenum samples) were taken. Anti-endomysium antibodies were evaluated by immunofluorescence method, anti-human tissue-transglutaminase antibodies by an enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay or radioimmunoassay. Human leukocyte antigen-DRB1, -DQA1, and -DQB1 genes were typed by polymerase chain reaction sequence-specific primers repeat method. RESULTS: In all of the patients with CD, histological lesions were present in the bulb sample; in 16 of them, the lesions were present only in the bulb. Patchy villous atrophy was found in 20 children. All of the patients with CD were anti-endomysium and/or antitransglutaminase positive. The controls showed neither autoantibody positivity nor mucosal changes compatible with CD. CONCLUSIONS: This study demonstrated that CD-related histological lesions are always present in the bulb; sometimes this specific site is the only one affected. Therefore, we suggest taking 2 biopsies from the bulb and 2 from the distal duodenum for CD diagnosis.},

   abstract = {OBJECTIVE: Corticosteroids are used in patients with refractory celiac disease. In order to minimize their systemic side effects, we assessed the role of a locally active sustained release corticosteroid with minimal systemic bioavailability in patients with refractory celiac disease in an open labeled noncontrolled study. METHODS: Patients who received budesonide for refractory celiac disease were classified according to whether they were primarily or secondarily unresponsive to the diet, and whether they had a polyclonal (type I) or clonal (type II) expansion of intraepithelial lymphocytes. The response to budesonide was assessed globally and by reduction in bowel movements. RESULTS: Patients (N = 29, 72% female) received budesonide for a mean of 6.7 +/- 8.5 months, 5 patients (18%) had type II disease (clonal T-cell population); 76% responded to the medication, 55% completely. Response occurred when budesonide was used alone or with oral corticosteroids and/or azathioprine. There was an objective improvement in the number of bowel movements in those that responded. Response occurred in those with either primary or secondary refractory disease and in those with type II disease, irrespective of the presence of microscopic colitis (N = 7). There was no improvement in the duodenal biopsy over the study period and there were no side effects of budesonide. CONCLUSIONS: Budesonide may be of value in the management of refractory celiac disease.},

   abstract = {Celiac disease, also known as gluten-sensitive enteropathy and nontropical sprue, is a prevalent autoimmune disorder that is triggered by the ingestion of wheat gluten and related proteins of rye and barley in genetically susceptible individuals. The immune response in celiac disease involves the adaptive, as well as the innate, and is characterized by the presence of anti-gluten and anti-transglutaminase 2 antibodies, lymphocytic infiltration in the epithelial membrane and the lamina propria, and expression of multiple cytokines and other signaling proteins. The disease leads to inflammation, villous atrophy, and crypt hyperplasia in the small intestine. In addition to the intestinal symptoms, celiac disease is associated with various extra-intestinal complications, including bone and skin disease, anemia, endocrine disorders, and neurologic deficits. Gluten-free diet is currently the only effective mode of treatment for celiac disease, but better understanding of the mechanism of the disease is likely to add other choices for therapy in the future.},

   abstract = {BACKGROUND: Aberrant signaling via the p21/mitogen-activated proteins (MAP) kinase pathway has been described in lymphocytes of patients with various autoimmune diseases. There is little published data about the intracellular mediators and signals that regulate expression and activity of transcription factors and their effect on celiac disease induction and progression. AIM: To investigate the possible involvement of MAP kinase pathway in peripheral blood mononuclear cells (PBMC) in celiac disease and its correlation with disease activity. METHODS: Expression of the total and activated forms of two MAP kinases [extracellular response kinase (ERK) and c-Jun amino terminal kinase (JNK)] were studied by Western blots in PBMC of 17 untreated and 19 treated celiac patients, and 17 controls. Seven of these untreated celiac patients were studies before and after 6 months of gluten-free diet. RESULTS: Phosphorylated ERK of active celiac disease patients was significantly lower compared with controls (P < 0.01) and was increased towards normal after 6 month of gluten-free diet (P < 0.01). Phosphorylated JNK was increased significantly in the untreated celiac group (P < 0.01) and normalized towards the control level after 6 months of gluten-free diet (P < 0.04). CONCLUSIONS: Aberrant MAP-kinase pathway activity is associated with active celiac disease (CD). Further studies should examine the potential role of this aberration in pathogenesis of CD.},

An association between coeliac disease and some types of cancer is well known. It is thus important to evaluate the seriousness of the condition and give patients advice and proper follow-up. MATERIAL AND METHODS: The article is based upon literature retrieved through a non-systematic search of PubMed. There are no Norwegian, but several European studies on the topic. Study design and patient selection varies. RESULTS: Most studies show increased cancer risk and mortality, especially for B-and T-cell lymphoma also outside the gut. The risk of breast and lung cancer is decreased. The studies show that the risk of mortality and cancer development is most pronounced the first three years after coeliac disease is diagnosed. The mortality of patients with coeliac disease during this period is nearly doubled in relation to a control population. There does not seem to be an increased cancer risk when the disease is diagnosed during childhood. Adherance to a gluten-free diet is at least partly protective. INTERPRETATION: Coeliac disease causes a certain increased risk of cancer and early death. It is not an innocent condition. This strengthens the arguments for coeliac patients to adhere to a gluten free diet.},

   abstract = {Coeliac disease is a malabsorption syndrome in which dietary gluten damages the small bowel mucosa. Gluten contains gliadin, the primary toxic component that is primarily found in wheat, barley and rye products. The initial diagnosis of coeliac disease is usually made by endoscopic biopsy of the jejunum although sometimes imaging features can suggest the diagnosis. Once a diagnosis is made, patients need to be diet compliant and monitored for potential complications. Many complications are more common when dietary compliance is poor. Complications include intussusception (usually intermittent), ulcerative jejunitis, osteomalacia, cavitating lymph node syndrome and an increased risk of malignancies such as lymphoma, adenocarcinoma and squamous cell carcinoma. Radiological evaluation is central in the evaluation of these complications. Imaging may assist both in the diagnosis and staging of complications as well as enabling radiological guided percutaneous biopsy for complications of coeliac disease such as lymphoma. As coeliac disease is a relatively common disorder, it is likely that most radiologists will encounter the disease and its potential complications. The aim of this review article is to discuss and illustrate the role of modern radiology in evaluating the many presentations of this complex disease.},

   abstract = {OBJECTIVES: Because clinically evident manifestations are frequent in adults with celiac disease (CD), we aimed to investigate whether early neurological abnormalities may be detected in children with CD. METHODS: Electroencephalography, electromyography, and somatosensory evoked potentials were performed in children with CD receiving a gluten-free diet. RESULTS: The neurophysiological tests revealed subclinical neurological abnormalities associated with CD in 3 (11%) of 27 children: 2 had peripheral polyneuropathy documented with electromyography, and 1 had prolonged latencies in somatosensory evoked potential. Magnetic resonance imaging showed abnormalities in 2 (7.4%) of children: pontine demyelinization in 1 and cortical atrophy in the other. CONCLUSIONS: Because the rate of neurological problems is increased in children with CD, neurological abnormalities should be carefully investigated early after the diagnosis of CD is made.},

   abstract = {BACKGROUND AND STUDY AIM: Endoscopy with duodenal biopsy is often performed in order to assess histological recovery in patients with celiac disease who are on a gluten-free diet. Use of the "immersion" technique during upper endoscopy allows visualization of duodenal villi or detection of total villous atrophy. In this two-center study, we investigated the accuracy of the immersion technique in predicting histological recovery in patients on a gluten-free diet whose initial diagnosis of celiac disease had been made on the basis of total villous atrophy. PATIENTS AND METHODS: The immersion technique was performed in 62 patients with celiac disease who were being treated and who had been referred for follow-up (26 patients at the Rome center and 36 patients at the Vicenza center). All these patients had an initial diagnosis based on positive antibodies and biopsy-proved duodenal total villous atrophy. At the follow-up examination, the duodenal villi were re-evaluated as present or absent by one endoscopist at each center, and the results were compared with the histology. RESULTS: At the follow-up endoscopy, the duodenal villi were found to be present in 51 patients and absent in 11. The sensitivity, specificity, positive predictive value, and negative predictive value of the immersion technique for detecting the presence or absence of villi were all 100 %. CONCLUSIONS: This study demonstrated the feasibility and the high level of accuracy of the immersion technique in predicting the histological recovery of duodenal villi in patients with celiac disease who are following a gluten-free diet. An endoscopy-based approach that avoids the need for biopsy could be useful for monitoring the dietary adherence and/or response of patients with an initial diagnosis of celiac disease based on total villous atrophy.},

   abstract = {OBJECTIVE: Although the diagnosis of coeliac disease requires specific histological and serological findings, patients considered to be affected by coeliac disease only on the basis of clinical improvement after gluten withdrawal are commonly referred to our outpatient clinic. The objective of this study was to investigate whether the clinical response of gastrointestinal symptoms to gluten withdrawal and subsequent dietary re-introduction could be an indicator of the presence of coeliac disease. MATERIAL AND METHODS: From December 1998 to January 2007, 180 patients on a gluten-free diet because of a diagnosis of coeliac disease not based on proper diagnostic criteria came to our out-patient clinic. In 112 of these patients, gluten was re-introduced into their diet. Subsequent duodenal biopsies and endomysial antibodies confirmed the diagnosis of coeliac disease in 51 of them. The relationship between improvement/worsening of symptoms and withdrawal/re-introduction of dietary gluten was analysed. RESULTS: Gastrointestinal symptoms improved in 64.7% of coeliac patients and 75.0% of non-coeliac patients after gluten withdrawal (chi(2) test, p=NS). Gluten re-introduction was followed by clinical exacerbation in 71.4% of coeliac patients and 54.2% of non-coeliac patients (chi(2) test, p=NS). The positive predictive value for clinical improvement after gluten withdrawal was 36%; the positive predictive value for clinical exacerbation after gluten re-introduction was 28%. CONCLUSIONS: Clinical response to either withdrawal or re-introduction of dietary gluten has no role in the diagnosis of coeliac disease.},

   abstract = {AIMS: Oral mucosal lesions may be markers of chronic gastrointestinal disorders, such as those causing malabsorption. Our objectives were to assess the prevalence of recurrent oral aphthous-like ulcers in coeliac disease patients living in the Mediterranean area, and to evaluate the impact of a gluten-free diet. METHODS: A test group of 269 patients (age range 3-17 years) with coeliac disease confirmed both serologically and histologically was compared with a control group of 575 otherwise clinically healthy subjects for the presence, or a positive history of aphthous-like ulcers. Coeliac disease patients with aphthous-like ulcers were re-evaluated 1-year after starting a gluten-free diet. RESULTS: Aphthous-like ulcers were found significantly more frequently in coeliac disease, in 22.7% (61/269) of patients with coeliac disease versus 7.1% (41/575) of controls (p=<0.0001; chi-square=41.687; odds ratio=4.3123; 95% confidence interval=2.7664:6.722). Most coeliac disease patients with aphthous-like ulcers and adhering strictly to gluten-free diet (71.7%; 33/46) reported significant improvement on gluten-free diet, with no or reduced episodes of aphthous-like ulcers (p=0.0003; chi-square=13.101; odds ratio=24.67; 95% confidence interval=2.63:231.441). CONCLUSIONS: The epidemiological association found between coeliac disease and aphthous-like ulcers suggests that recurrent aphthous-like ulcers should be considered a risk indicator for coeliac disease, and that gluten-free diet leads to ulcer amelioration.},

   abstract = {BACKGROUND: Many coeliac disease patients with atypical symptoms remain undiagnosed. AIM: To examine the frequency of oral lesions in coeliac disease patients and to assess their usefulness in making coeliac disease diagnosis. PATIENTS AND METHODS: One hundred and ninety-seven coeliac disease patients and 413 controls were recruited and the oral examination was performed. RESULTS: Forty-six out of 197 coeliac disease patients (23%) were found to have enamel defects vs. 9% in controls (P < 0.0001). Clinical delayed eruption was observed in 26% of the pediatric coeliac disease patients vs. 7% of the controls (P < 0.0001). The prevalence of oral soft tissues lesions was 42% in the coeliac disease patients and 2% in controls (P < 0.0001). Recurrent aphthous stomatitis disappeared in 89% of the patients after 1 year of gluten-free diet. Multi-logistic analysis selected the following variables as the most meaningful in coeliac disease patients: dental enamel defects (OR = 2.652 CI = 1.427-4.926) and soft tissue lesions (OR = 41.667, CI = 18.868-90.909). Artificial Neural Networks methodology showed that oral soft tissue lesions have sensitivity = 42%, specificity = 98% and test accuracy = 83% in coeliac disease diagnosis. CONCLUSIONS: The overall prevalence of oral soft tissue lesions was higher in coeliac disease patients (42%) than in controls. However, the positive-predictive value of these lesions for coeliac disease diagnosis was low.},

   abstract = {BACKGROUND: Ample use of serological markers of high sensitivity and specificity led to relevant changes in the epidemiology of celiac disease. The impact of these changes in our country is poorly known. AIM: To assess the diagnostic procedures, clinical presentations and follow up of celiac disease as conducted in current pediatric practice. MATERIAL AND METHODS: A multicentric retrospective study of patients diagnosed between 2000 and 2005 in five pediatric hospitals in Santiago, Chile. Data was obtained from clinical records, recorded in electronic spreadsheets and analyzed by descriptive statistics. RESULTS: Seventy four of 83 identified patients fulfilled the inclusion criteria and were analyzed. Mean time to reach the diagnosis was 2.1 years. Cases younger than 10 years presented digestive manifestations such as chronic diarrhea and abdominal distension. Twenty one percent of older patients had atypical presentations (mainly short stature, refractory anaemia). Ten percent of cases were screened because a first degree relative had celiac disease. All patients had significant duodenal/jejunal lesion. IgA-antiendomysial antibodies (n =65) and IgA-antigliadin antibodies (n =23) were the most commonly used screening tests used but often, they were not available for follow up. A second biopsy was planned in all patients but only 26 had it due to repeated dietary transgressions, often due to unnoticed consumption of gluten in poorly labeled products. CONCLUSIONS: Digestive manifestations were the main presentation form for celiac disease among patients under 10 years of age. Atypical symptoms become relevant in patients older than 10 years. Antiendomysial and antitransglutaminase antibody measurement should be incorporated for routine screening and follow up of celiac disease in public hospitals. To improve food labeling about their gluten content is needed.},

AIMS: To evaluate the presence of IgA and TG3 deposits, considered to be the first step in inducing DH, in healthy skin of coeliac patients without cutaneous manifestations. METHODS: Punch biopsies were taken from 11 consecutive coeliac patients, two with DH and nine without cutaneous manifestations, three of whom were adhering to a gluten-free diet (GFD), and evaluated for the presence of deposits in the upper dermis and vessel walls by immunofluorescence and confocal microscopy. RESULTS: In coeliac patients affected by DH we found the presence of IgA and TG3 deposits mainly on the upper dermis, but also in vessel walls. In all coeliac patients without DH and also in those patients who were following a strict GFD, we found widely variable deposits of IgA and TG3 in both the papillary dermis and the vessel walls, although a lower intensity of the fluorescence signal was detected than with coeliac patients affected by DH. Double immunostaining with anti-IgA and anti-TG3 antibodies showed a strong co-localization in the upper dermis in patients with DH and a weaker co-localization in those without DH. CONCLUSIONS: We have demonstrated the presence of IgA and TG3 deposits in the healthy skin of coeliac patients, which are considered to play a central role in the pathogenesis of DH.},

   abstract = {Celiac disease (CD) is an important cause of serum aminotransferase elevation: between 5 and 10% of patients with persistent and cryptogenetic transaminase elevation may have CD. In fact, a wide spectrum of liver injuries in children and adults may be related to CD, particularly: a) mild parenchymal damage characterized by absence of any clinical signs or symptoms suggesting chronic liver disease, and by non-specific histological changes reversible on a gluten-free diet; b) chronic liver damage with autoimmune etiology, including autoimmune hepatitis, primary sclerosing cholangitis, and primary biliary cirrhosis, which may be associated with CD but are generally unaffected by gluten withdrawal; and c) severe liver failure and decompensated cryptogenetic liver cirrhosis, potentially treatable with a gluten-free diet. Such different types of liver injuries may represent one same disorder where individual factors, such as genetic predisposition, precocity, and duration of exposure to gluten may influence reversibility of liver damage. A rigorous cross-checking for asymptomatic liver damage in CD individuals and, conversely, for CD in any cryptogenic liver disorder, including end-stage liver failure, is recommended.},

   abstract = {BACKGROUND & AIMS: Celiac patients are at risk to develop an autoimmune liver disease. The aim of this study was to describe the clinical features of children and adolescents presenting with an autoimmune liver disease associated with celiac disease. METHODS: A retrospective multicenter national survey was made for the period 1990-2005. RESULTS: Among 140 pediatric patients with autoimmune liver disease in italy, we identified 23 with celiac disease: 19 with autoimmune hepatitis, 2 with autoimmune cholangitis, and 2 with overlap syndrome. Diagnosis of celiac disease preceded the diagnosis of liver disease in 18 of them, but elevation of aminotransferase activity was present in 16 when celiac disease was diagnosed. Acute hepatitis developed in 2 infants on gluten-free diet, and a hidden celiac disease was discovered in 5 other patients. Nineteen patients had liver-related non-organ-specific autoantibodies. Liver histology showed inflammatory lesions with features of autoimmune damage and different degrees of fibrosis in all of them and cirrhosis in 4. All patients, on gluten-free diet, achieved remission on immunosuppressive therapy, 14 relapsed because of discontinuation of therapy or during spontaneous gluten challenge, 20 are still on immunosuppressive treatment, and 3 could stop therapy. CONCLUSIONS: Autoimmune liver diseases are frequently associated with celiac disease, but they might remain undiagnosed because of lack of symptoms, because of absence of liver-specific autoantibodies, or because of a misdiagnosis of celiac hepatitis. Acute hepatitis in celiac patients should induce one to suspect an autoimmune origin. Patients with autoimmune liver disease might have a hidden celiac disease, suggesting a rigorous check in any cryptogenic liver disease.},

   abstract = {In celiac disease (CD), gluten, the disease-inducing toxic component in wheat, induces the secretion of IgA-class autoantibodies which target tissue transglutaminase (tTG). These autoantibodies are produced in the small-intestinal mucosa, and, during gluten consumption, they can also be detected in patients' serum but disappear slowly from the circulation on a gluten-free diet. Interestingly, after adoption of a gluten-free diet the serum autoantibodies disappear from the circulation more rapidly than the small-intestinal mucosal autoantibody deposits. The finding of IgA deposits on extracellular tTG in the liver, kidney, lymph nodes and muscles of patients with CD indicates that tTG is accessible to the gut-derived autoantibodies. Although the specific autoantibody response directed against tTG is very characteristic in celiac patients, their role in the immunopathology of the celiac mucosal lesion is a matter of debate. Here we report a brief summary of anti-tTG antibody effects demonstrating that these antibodies are functional and not mere bystanders in the disease pathogenesis. In fact, they inhibit intestinal epithelial cell differentiation, induce intestinal epithelial cell proliferation, increase epithelial permeability and activate monocytes and disturb angiogenesis.},

   abstract = {The objective of the study is to present a series of 20 patients who have been attending a rheumatology unit and were diagnosed with celiac disease in adult life. The record-charts of 20 Italian not consanguineous patients affected by celiac disease (1 man and 19 women, mean age of 46.7), diagnosed at >16 years of age, followed by a rheumatology unit were reviewed (group 1). Any other autoimmune disease diagnosed in the patients were given was recorded; moreover, the reason for rheumatologist evaluation was registered as well as the presence of symptoms suggestive of celiac disease and the obstetric history. The clinical features were compared with those of a group of 40 celiac patients (8 men and 32 women, mean age of 43.1) followed by a medicine department (group 2); even in these cases the diagnosis of celiac disease was performed in adult life. Sixteen out of 20 patients in Group 1 were diagnosed as suffering from celiac disease by the rheumatologist. Seventeen concomitant autoimmune disorders among which nine were connective tissue diseases were found in 15 patients. The main reason for rheumatologist evaluation was arthromyalgias. Ten patients showed one or more clinical features suggestive of celiac disease; moreover, eight patients had a history of sideropenic anemia. After the adoption of a gluten-free diet there were three pregnancies that all ended with alive newborns, differently from the obstetric history before celiac disease diagnosis, characterized by a relevant number of miscarriages and foetus deaths. In Group 2, a total of ten autoimmune diseases concomitant with celiac disease were found in eight patients; autoimmune thyroid disorders represented the most frequent cases. No connective tissue diseases were recognized. Celiac disease may coexist with connective tissue diseases; the recognition of this association is difficult because celiac disease may present with atypical or even symptomless forms or in some cases may resemble a multisystem disorder or may mimic a rheumatologic condition; on the other hand, the variety of symptoms of rheumatic disorders may make difficult the diagnosis of celiac disease in association with a systemic autoimmune disease. These confounding factors often lead to a delay in performing the right diagnostic formulation.},

   abstract = {OBJECTIVE: Persistent villous atrophy in patients with celiac disease (CD) on a gluten-free diet (GFD) is reported with increasing frequency. The aim of this study was to evaluate a possible association between persistent damage of the villi and "atypical" gastrointestinal symptoms in CD patients on a GFD. MATERIAL AND METHODS: Sixty-nine CD patients on a GFD were divided into two groups: Group A included 42 patients (6 M, 36 F, age range 17-62 years) undergoing esophagogastroduodenoscopies (EGDs) due to the presence of symptoms; Group B included 27 control patients (6 M, 21 F, age range 24-71 years) who were asymptomatic at the time of the study. Both groups underwent EGDs and a duodenal histologic study. RESULTS: Persistent endoscopic lesions were more frequent in Group A (30/42) than in Group B (12/27; p=0.01). Villous atrophy was significantly more frequent in Group A than in Group B: 85% versus 33% (p<0.0001; odds ratio (OR)=12; 95% CI 3.7-38.9). Gastrointestinal symptoms in the Group A patients were different from those present at CD diagnosis: anemia/diarrhea/weight loss in 6 cases; gastroesophageal reflux disease (GERD)-like symptoms in 12 cases; abdominal pain/constipation in 24 cases. In Group A there was no difference in gender distribution, age and duration of GFD between subjects with normal villi and those with persistent partial villous atrophy. Patients with persistent symptoms showed a higher intraepithelial eosinophil count (p=0.005) than the asymptomatic patients (p=0.01). CONCLUSIONS: Persistent intestinal villous atrophy in CD patients on a GFD is associated with gastrointestinal symptoms considered "atypical" for CD and not present at CD diagnosis.},

   abstract = {BACKGROUND: Previous studies have demonstrated that serum anti-actin antibodies are a reliable marker of intestinal damage severity in coeliac disease. AIMS: To validate in a multicentre study the clinical usefulness of serum IgA anti-actin antibody ELISA and its possible use in monitoring intestinal mucosa lesions during gluten-free diet. PATIENTS AND METHODS: Four centres recruited 205 newly diagnosed coeliac disease patients with villous atrophy, 80 healthy controls and 81 "disease" controls. Twelve coeliac disease patients on gluten-free diet but with persistent symptoms underwent serum IgA anti-actin antibody assay and intestinal histology evaluation. IgA anti-actin antibody ELISA was performed with a commercial kit. All coeliac disease patients underwent intestinal histology study. RESULTS: IgA anti-actin antibodies showed a sensitivity of 80% and a specificity of 85% in the diagnosis of coeliac disease patients with villous atrophy. The area under the receiving operator curve for anti-actin antibodies was 0.873 [95% C.I. 0.805-0.899]. Serum anti-actin antibodies values were significantly higher in coeliac disease patients than in healthy or "disease" controls (P<0.0001). Serum anti-actin antibodies were positive in 41 of the 60 coeliac disease patients with mild intestinal histology lesions (69%) and in 123 of the 145 with severe lesions (85.3%) (P<0.05). There was a significant inverse correlation between anti-actin antibody values and the villi/crypts ratio (r=-0.423; P<0.0001). In the 12 coeliac disease patients on gluten-free diet who underwent re-evaluation as they were persistently symptomatic, intestinal histology showed three cases with persistent villous atrophy: all of these were positive for serum anti-actin antibodies ELISA, whereas both serum anti-tTG and EmAs were negative. The other nine patients showed normal intestinal villi and were negative for serum anti-actin antibodies. CONCLUSIONS: Anti-actin antibodies are a reliable marker of severe intestinal mucosa damage in coeliac disease patients and a simple ELISA technique offers an accurate method for their determination. These antibodies seem to be a very reliable marker of persistent intestinal damage in coeliac disease patients.},

METHODS: A multicenter, cross-sectional prospective study was performed in patients with celiac disease who completed two HRQOL questionnaires: the gastrointestinal quality of life index (GIQLI) and the EuroQol-5D (EQ). RESULTS: Three hundred and forty patients (163 controlled with a gluten-free diet, and 177 newly diagnosed with a normal diet) were included. The GIQLI score was significantly better in patients on a gluten-free diet (GFD) than in non-treated patients on their usual diet, both in terms of the overall score (3.3 vs 2.7, respectively; P < 0.001), as well as on the individual questionnaire dimensions. Both the preference value of the EQ as the visual analogue scale were significantly better in treated than in non-treated patients (0.93 vs 0.72 P < 0.001 and 80 vs 70 P < 0.001, respectively). Variables significantly associated with a worse HRQOL score were female gender, failure to adhere to a GFD, and symptomatic status. CONCLUSION: In untreated celiac disease, the most important factors that influence patient perception of health are the presence of symptoms and a normal diet. HRQOL improves to levels similar to those described in the general population in celiac disease patients well controlled with a GFD.},

   abstract = {BACKGROUND: Celiac disease is an enteropathy induced by gluten in genetically predisposed individuals. AIM: To establish the demographic and clinical characteristics of this disease in Santa Catarina State, Brazil. METHODS: A descriptive transversal study was performed involving members of a regional celiac association, to whom a questionnaire focusing various aspects of the disease was sent. RESULTS: From a total of 506 members, 145 (28.7%) were enrolled in the study--all of them biopsy-proven celiacs. Their mean age was 30.8 years (range, 3.3-82.5 years). Female to male rate was 2.1:1. The mean age at diagnosis was 16 years for men and 26.7 years for women. Most frequently reported symptoms were: abdominal distention (71.8%), abdominal pain (71%) and diarrhea (65.5%). Anemia, aphthous ulcers and constipation were more related by women, while diarrhea and low weight were more frequent in men. Only 42.1% of the participants had been submitted to biopsies compatible with a correct investigation of the disease (44.2 % had been submitted to biopsy only after gluten exclusion of the diet and 11.7% did not mentioned whether they were in a gluten-free diet when biopsied). Only 61.4% had been submitted to serological tests for diagnostic or dietary control purposes. Associated diseases were related by 65% of the individuals, of which the most common was lactose intolerance (33%). Vitaminic or mineral supplementation was indicated to 45% and only 32.5% have had bone mineral density measured. Of these, 59% had altered results. CONCLUSIONS: The results suggest a tendency of diagnosis of celiac disease in older ages, specially among women. This may indicate the necessity of improving public and medical knowledge in Santa Catarina concerning the diagnosis and treatment of this disease.},

   abstract = {BACKGROUND & AIMS: Celiac disease is a complex, immune-mediated disorder of the intestinal mucosa with a strong genetic component. HLA-DQ2 is the major determinant of risk, but other minor genes, still to be identified, also are involved. METHODS: We designed a strategy that combines gene expression profiling of intestinal biopsy specimens, linkage region information, and different bioinformatics tools for the selection of potentially regulatory single-nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) involved in the disease. We selected 361 SNPs from 71 genes that fulfilled stringent functional (changes in expression level) and positional criteria (located in regions that have been linked to the disease, other than HLA). These polymorphisms were genotyped in 262 celiac patients and 214 controls. RESULTS: We detected strong evidence of association with several SNPs (the most significant were rs6747096, P = 2.38 x 10(-5); rs7040561, P = 6.55 x 10(-5); and rs458046, P = 1.35 x 10(-4)) that pinpoint novel candidate determinants of predisposition to the disease in previously identified linkage regions (eg, SERPINE2 in 2q33, and PBX3 or PPP6C in 9q34). CONCLUSIONS: Our study shows that the combination of function and position is a valid strategy for the genetic dissection of complex traits.},

Transabdominal bowel sonography (TABS) is a safe and noninvasive procedure that allows to detect intestinal abnormalities in many conditions, but actually is not routinely part of the diagnostic management of CD. AIM: To evaluate the diagnostic accuracy of TABS in CD patients. PATIENTS AND METHODS: Fifty CD patients and 50 dyspeptic subjects (control group) underwent TABS. The presence of fluid-distended small bowel loops with thickened valvulae conniventes and increased peristalsis was considered a TABS sign of CD. All clinical, biochemical, and TABS features were assessed at the diagnosis and revaluated after 1 year of gluten-free diet. RESULTS: TABS signs were present in 66% of CD patients. Sensitivity, specificity, positive and negative predictive value were 66%, 96%, 94%, and 74%, respectively. TABS findings were recorded in 82% of patients with endoscopical markers of CD, in 87.5% of symptomatic patients, and in 61% of patients without symptoms. After 1 year of gluten-free diet TABS was still abnormal in 20% patients, with no correlation with laboratory tests e/o symptoms. CONCLUSIONS: Patients with CD frequently present TABS signs of the disease and operators performing sonography every day have to consider the possibility to suggest CD diagnosis and aTTG determination in these subjects.},

AIM: To analyze the cost of basic food basket (BFB) compared to a basket especially designed for celiac patients in Chile and to estimate the increment in food spending that these patients experience. MATERIAL AND METHODS: The cost of a daily BFB was calculated using the National Socioeconomic Characterization Enquiry (CASEN) methodology of the Ministry of Planning and the food prices delivered by the National Institute of Statistics for consumers, adjusted according to consumer prices at june 2007. To calculate the cost of the basket for celiac disease, equivalent foods without gluten were considered. Their daily and monthly values and the percentage difference between them were analyzed, by food groups and type of basket. RESULTS: The monthly value of BFB and a basket for a celiac is, at June 2007, Ch $ 30.251 and Ch $ 57.250, respectively. This represents an increase in feeding costs for celiac patients of 89%. CONCLUSIONS: The greater cost of food without gluten represents limitation in the budget of celiac patients.},

   abstract = {In the past, celiac disease was believed to be a chronic enteropathy, almost exclusively affecting people of European origin. The availability of new, simple, very sensitive and specific serological tests (anti-gliadin, anti-endomysium and anti-transglutaminase antibody assays) have shown that celiac disease is common not only in Europe and in people of European ancestry but also in the developing countries where the major staple diet is wheat (Southern Asia, the Middle East, North West and East Africa, South America), both in the general population and in the groups at risk. Gluten intolerance thus appears to be a widespread public health problem and an increased level of awareness and clinical suspicion are needed in the New World where physicians must learn to recognize the variable clinical presentations (classical, atypical and silent forms) of celiac disease. In the developing countries, both serological screening in the general population and serological testing in groups at risk are necessary for an early identification of celiac patients. The gluten-free diet poses a challenging public health problem in the developing countries, especially since commercial gluten-free products are not available.},

   abstract = {BACKGROUND: Treatment of celiac disease (CD) is based on the avoidance of gluten-containing food. However, it is not known whether trace amounts of gluten are harmful to treated patients. OBJECTIVE: The objective was to establish the safety threshold of prolonged exposure to trace amounts of gluten (ie, contaminating gluten). DESIGN: This was a multicenter, double-blind, placebo-controlled, randomized trial in 49 adults with biopsy-proven CD who were being treated with a gluten-free diet (GFD) for > or =2 y. The background daily gluten intake was maintained at < 5 mg. After a baseline evaluation (t0), patients were assigned to ingest daily for 90 d a capsule containing 0, 10, or 50 mg gluten. Clinical, serologic, and histologic evaluations of the small intestine were performed at t0 and after the gluten microchallenge (t1). RESULTS: At t0, the median villous height/crypt depth (Vh/Cd) in the small-intestinal mucosa was significantly lower and the intraepithelial lymphocyte (IEL) count (x 100 enterocytes) significantly higher in the CD patients (Vh/Cd: 2.20; 95% CI: 2.11, 2.89; IEL: 27; 95% CI: 23, 34) than in 20 non-CD control subjects (Vh/Cd: 2.87; 95% CI: 2.50, 3.09; IEL: 22; 95% CI: 18, 24). One patient (challenged with 10 mg gluten) developed a clinical relapse. At t(1), the percentage change in Vh/Cd was 9% (95% CI: 3%, 15%) in the placebo group (n = 13), -1% (-18%, 68%) in the 10-mg group (n = 13), and -20% (-22%, -13%) in the 50-mg group (n = 13). No significant differences in the IEL count were found between the 3 groups. CONCLUSIONS: The ingestion of contaminating gluten should be kept lower than 50 mg/d in the treatment of CD.},

   abstract = {PURPOSE OF REVIEW: Recent advances in the clinical, epidemiological, genetic, and therapeutic aspects of celiac disease have made this condition a superb model of autoimmunity. This review will outline the most significant work that contributed to our current knowledge of the disease. RECENT FINDINGS: Celiac disease is not confined to the Caucasian population as previously believed; rather its prevalence is approximately 1% worldwide. In addition to the HLA genes, many other genes involved in innate and adaptive immunity, intestinal barrier regulation, and autoimmunity have been identified as integral genetic components of the disease. Based on this information and on a better understanding of celiac disease pathogenesis, novel therapies alternative to the gluten-free diet are currently in advanced phase of development. SUMMARY: The outcome of these new findings will most likely have a significant impact in clinical practice, including diagnosis and management of the disease. Furthermore, celiac disease can be used as a unique model to gain more insights on the pathogenesis of autoimmune diseases.},

The human gastrointestinal tract does not possess the enzymatic equipment to efficiently cleave the gluten-derived proline-rich peptides driving the abnormal immune intestinal response in patients with coeliac disease. Oral therapy by exogenous prolylendopeptidases able to digest ingested gluten was therefore propounded as an alternative treatment to the diet. The feasibility of this approach is discussed by reviewing recent data on the intestinal transport of gliadin peptides, properties of available enzymes and preliminary clinical assays. Development of new enzymes or enzymatic cocktails offers potentially more potent therapeutic tools that, however, need meticulous evaluation based on clinical, biological and histological criteria.},

METHODS: We studied retrospectively 80 cases enrolled in the paediatrics' department of Sousse between 1993 and 2003. RESULTS: There were 44 girls and 36 boys (sex-ratio=0.81). The middle age of gluten introduction was 9 months, with extremes going from 1 to 24 months. Free interval between the introduction of gluten and the beginning of the symptoms was meaningfully more elevated in patients who received gluten after the age of 6 months (p=0.036). At the time of the diagnosis, the middle age of our patients was six years with extremes going from nine months to 17 years. The classic form of celiac disease with chronic diarrhoea has been observed in 85% of the cases. The morbid associations with celiac disease were dominated by the diabetes type 1 noted in 5% of the cases. Antigliadin antibodies, practiced in first intension, were positive in 98.6%. At histology, villous atrophy was sub-total to total in 96.25% of the cases and partial in 3.75% of the cases. Follow-up was on average at 18 months. Adhesion to the gluten-free diet (GFD) was judged satisfactory in 81.45% of the cases on average. Catch up growth, although remarkable, was not very satisfactory. Indeed, several patients adhering little or not to the GFD kept, at one year of evolution, a ponderal and stature delay superior to 2SD.},

   abstract = {Celiac disease (CD) or gluten sensitive enteropathy is relatively common in western populations with prevalence around 1%. With the recent availability of sensitive and specific serological testing, many patients who are either asymptomatic or have subtle symptoms can be shown to have CD. Patients with CD have modest increases in risks of malignancy and mortality compared to controls. The mortality among CD patients who comply poorly with a gluten-free diet is greater than in compliant patients. The pattern of presentation of CD has altered over the past three decades. Many cases are now detected in adulthood during investigation of problems as diverse as anemia, osteoporosis, autoimmune disorders, unexplained neurological syndromes, infertility and chronic hypertransaminasemia of uncertain cause. Among autoimmune disorders, increased prevalence of CD has been found in patients with autoimmune thyroid disease, type 1 diabetes mellitus, autoimmune liver diseases and inflammatory bowel disease. Prevalence of CD was noted to be 1% to 19% in patients with type 1 diabetes mellitus, 2% to 5% in autoimmune thyroid disorders and 3% to 7% in primary biliary cirrhosis in prospective studies. Conversely, there is also an increased prevalence of immune based disorders among patients with CD. The pathogenesis of co-existent autoimmune thyroid disease and CD is not known, but these conditions share similar HLA haplotypes and are associated with the gene encoding cytotoxic T-lymphocyte-associated antigen-4. Screening high risk patients for CD, such as those with autoimmune diseases, is a reasonable strategy given the increased prevalence. Treatment of CD with a gluten-free diet should reduce the recognized complications of this disease and provide benefits in both general health and perhaps life expectancy. It also improves glycemic control in patients with type 1 diabetes mellitus and enhances the absorption of medications for associated hypothyroidism and osteoporosis. It probably does not change the natural history of associated autoimmune disorders.},

   abstract = {BACKGROUND & AIMS: Celiac disease is a condition in which genetically predisposed people have an autoimmune reaction to gluten proteins found in all wheat types and closely related cereals such as barley and rye. This reaction causes the formation of autoantibodies and the destruction of the villi in the small intestine, which results in malabsorption of nutrientsand other gluten-induced autoimmune diseases. Sorghum is a cereal grain with potential to be developed into an important crop for human food products. The flour produced from white sorghum hybrids is light in color and has a bland, neutral taste that does not impart unusual colors or flavors to food products. These attributes make it desirable for use in wheat-free food products. While sorghum is considered as a safe food for celiac patients, primarily due to its relationship to maize, no direct testing has been conducted on its safety for gluten intolerance. Therefore studies are needed to assess its safety and tolerability in celiac patients. Thus the aim of the present study was to assess safety and tolerability of sorghum flour products in adult celiac disease patients, utilizing an in vitro and in vivo challenge. RESULTS: Sorghum protein digests did not elicit any morphometric or immunomediated alteration of duodenal explants from celiac patients. Patients fed daily for 5 days with sorghum-derived food product did not experience gastrointestinal or non-gastrointestinal symptoms and the level of anti-transglutaminase antibodies was unmodified at the end of the 5-days challenge. CONCLUSIONS: Sorghum-derived products did not show toxicity for celiac patients in both in vitro and in vivo challenge. Therefore sorghum can be considered safe for people with celiac disease.},

L-Carnitine therapy was shown to improve muscular fatigue in several diseases. AIM: To evaluate the effect of L-carnitine treatment in fatigue in adult celiac patients. METHODS: Randomised double-blind versus placebo parallel study. Thirty celiac disease patients received 2 g daily, 180 days (L-carnitine group) and 30 were assigned to the placebo group (P group). The patients underwent clinical investigation and questionnaires (Scott-Huskisson Visual Analogue Scale for Asthenia, Verbal Scale for Asthenia, Zung Depression Scale, SF-36 Health Status Survey, EuroQoL). OCTN2 levels, the specific carnitine transporter, were detected in intestinal tissue. RESULTS: Fatigue measured by Scott-Huskisson Visual Analogue Scale for Asthenia was significantly reduced in the L-carnitine group compared with the placebo group (p=0.0021). OCTN2 was decreased in celiac patients when compared to normal subjects (-134.67% in jejunum), and increased after diet in both celiac disease treatments. The other scales used did not show any significant difference between the two celiac disease treatment groups. CONCLUSION: L-Carnitine therapy is safe and effective in ameliorating fatigue in celiac disease. Since L-carnitine is involved in muscle energy production its decreased absorption due to OCTN2 reduction might explain muscular symptoms in celiac disease patients. The diet-induced OCTN2 increase, improving carnitine absorption, might explain the L-carnitine treatment efficacy.},

   abstract = {PURPOSE: Intestinal diseases may cause urinary stone disease via hyperoxaluria or diarrhea induced hyperconcentrated acidic urine. Data are missing on urinary stone disease in celiac disease, a common malabsorptive disorder. In this study we analyzed urinary stone disease and urine composition in adults with celiac disease. MATERIALS AND METHODS: Study patients were 18 years or older, untreated, and newly diagnosed with celiac disease by serum markers and jejunal biopsy. Clinical presentation of celiac disease was assessed focusing on 5 disorders of diarrhea, and deficiency of calorie (low body mass index or weight loss), lipid (low prothrombin time or low serum lipids), iron (low hemoglobin or low serum ferritin) and calcium (low serum calcium or low bone densitometry). Urinary stone disease history was assessed by questionnaire (imaging, stone excretion, stone disruption/removal). Urinary variables were measured in a 24-hour collection in a subgroup of patients. RESULTS: Under untreated conditions (baseline) urinary stone disease was independent of celiac disease presentation and more prevalent in patients with celiac disease than in a population sample used as a control (608 and 3,540, 7.9% and 5.0%, sex and age adjusted odds ratio 4.0, 95% CI 2.7-5.9). Excluding from analysis individuals with baseline urinary stone disease, the incidence of urinary stone disease history was not significantly different between the treated celiac disease (gluten-free diet) and control population (458 and 3,003, 2.4% vs 3.9%). The urine of untreated patients with celiac disease differed from that of healthy volunteers with 120% higher oxalate and 43% lower calcium (in 45 and 45, p <0.001). A gluten-free diet corrected urinary abnormalities (p <0.01). CONCLUSIONS: Urinary stone disease risk is high in untreated patients with celiac disease independent of overt malabsorption. Hyperoxaluria is likely the underlying disorder. A gluten-free diet reduces urinary stone disease risk and oxaluria.},

   abstract = {Dendritic cells (DC) play a pivotal role in shaping the immune response in both physiological and pathological conditions. In peripheral blood at least two subsets, the myeloid and plasmacytoid, have been described as having different T stimulatory functions and a variable degree of maturation. Certainly, antigen presentation plays a crucial role in the pathogenesis of coeliac disease and circulating immune cells are thought to reflect the state of immune response within the gut. Therefore, we aimed to investigate the quantitative and phenotypical modifications of peripheral blood DC, together with their functional properties, in this pathological condition. Blood samples from 11 untreated patients before and after a course of gluten-free diet, 27 treated patients and 14 controls underwent flow-cytometric analysis, while immunomagnetically sorted DC from the CD patients and eight human leucocyte antigen (HLA)-DQ2/8(+) bone marrow donors were used to evaluate maturation status through the CD83 expression, cytokine profile for interleukin (IL)-6, IL-10, IL-12 and interferon (IFN)-alpha by enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay (ELISA), and functional properties by mixed leucocyte reaction before and after pulsing with digested gliadin. We found that in both untreated and treated patients, a significant reduction of the entire DC population, mainly the plasmacytoid subset, in comparison to healthy controls was observed. In active disease, an impaired allogenic lymphocyte reaction and a significant reduction of IFN-alpha production, paralleled by the presence of a more immature status, were also demonstrated. All the latter modifications have been reverted by pulsing DC with digested gliadin.},

   abstract = {BACKGROUND: Gut bifidobacteria are believed to influence immune-related diseases. The objective of this study was to assess the possible relationships between the gut bifidobacteria composition and coeliac disease (CD) in children. A total of 48 faecal samples (30 and 18 samples from active and no active CD patients, respectively) and 33 duodenal biopsy specimens of CD patients (25 and 8 samples from active and non-active CD patients, respectively) were analysed. Samples (30 faecal samples and 8 biopsies) from a control age-matched group of children were also included for comparative purposes. Gut Bifidobacterium genus and species were analyzed by real-time PCR. RESULTS: Active and non-active CD patients showed lower numbers of total Bifidobacterium and B. longum species in faeces and duodenal biopsies than controls, and these differences were particularly remarkable between active CD patients and controls. B. catenulatum prevalence was higher in biopsies of controls than in those of active and non-active CD patients, whereas B. dentium prevalence was higher in faeces of non-active CD patients than in controls. Correlations between levels of Bifidobacterium and B. longum species in faecal and biopsy samples were detected in both CD patients and controls. CONCLUSION: Reductions in total Bifidobacterium and B. longum populations were associated with both active and non-active CD when compared to controls. These bacterial groups could constitute novel targets for adjuvant dietary therapies although the confirmation of this hypothesis would require further investigations.},

   abstract = {AIMS: To identify specific gut bacteria associated with coeliac disease (CD) at diagnosis and after treatment with a gluten-free diet (GFD) in a paediatric population. METHODS: 30 and 18 faecal samples from untreated and treated CD patients and 25 and 8 biopsy samples from untreated and treated CD patients, respectively, were analysed. In addition, 30 faecal and 8 biopsy samples from control children were evaluated for comparative purposes. Gut bacterial groups were quantified by real-time PCR. RESULTS: Bacteroides and Clostridium leptum groups were more abundant in faeces and biopsies of CD patients than in controls regardless of the stage of the disease. E coli and Staphylococcus counts were also higher in faeces and biopsies of non-treated CD patients than in those of controls, but their levels were normalised after treatment with a GFD. Bifidobacterium levels were lower in faeces of both groups of CD patients and in biopsies of untreated CD patients compared to controls. Similar bacterial groups were related to CD in biopsies and faeces, indicating that faecal microbiota partly reflects that of the small intestine in CD patients, and could constitute a convenient biological index of this disorder. CONCLUSIONS: Duodenal and faecal microbiota is unbalanced in children with untreated CD and only partially restored after long-term treatment with a GFD, constituting a novel factor linked to this disorder.},

   abstract = {GOALS: We have for several years been training health personnel to recognize celiac disease, and have advocated serologic screening in risk groups. The aim was to establish whether this approach would offer an alternative to population screening, which has yielded a prevalence of 1% in Finland. BACKGROUND: The number of detected celiac disease cases is much lower than that obtained in serologic screening studies. STUDY: Nationwide recommendations for the detection of celiac disease were published in 1998, and training of health personnel took place in 2001 to 2002. The prevalence of celiac disease was calculated from the national registry of patients receiving reimbursement for dietary costs, attested by physician's statement. In 1 of the 10 statements the diagnostic criteria and clinical manifestations were scrutinized. RESULTS: The nationwide prevalence of celiac disease was 0.45%; 0.7% in the highest to 0.3% in the lowest area. The annual number of new patients increased from 5/100,000 in the early 1980s to 20/100,000 today. The percentage of patients found in risk groups (relatives of celiac disease patients, patients with extraintestinal symptoms or concomitant autoimmune disorders) was currently 16.3% in the high and 6.6% in the low prevalence area. Seventeen percent of patients had dermatitis herpetiformis, and its incidence was declining. CONCLUSIONS: A maximal prevalence of 0.7% of celiac disease was ascertained; educating primary health care staff regarding the protean manifestations of the disease seemed to be the key issue. The increase in incidence implies that a prevalence of 1.0% is possible, rendering population screening unnecessary.},

   abstract = {OBJECTIVE: Depression, psychological problems and the impairment of quality of life are reported to occur in untreated coeliac disease. Alexithymia ("no words for feelings") is associated with various gastrointestinal disorders. The aim of this study was to evaluate whether patients with coeliac disease suffer from psychoneurotic symptoms or alexithymia, and whether a gluten-free diet has an impact on the symptoms. MATERIAL AND METHODS: The Crown-Crisp Experiential Index (CCEI) and its six subscales were applied to measure neurotic psychopathology, and the 20-item version of the Toronto Alexithymia Scale (TAS-20) and its 3-factor scales to measure alexithymia. The testing was carried out in 20 consecutive adult patients with biopsy-proven coeliac disease before and after one year of treatment on a gluten-free diet. The data were compared with those obtained earlier in non-coeliac Finnish subjects. RESULTS: Somatic anxiety was higher in coeliac disease patients before the introduction of the gluten-free diet than after adhering to the diet. Otherwise, the diet had no significant impact on the CCEI scores. The patients were not suffering from alexithymia, but the TAS-20 score improved significantly during the follow-up. The scores did not differ from those published in the Finnish population. CONCLUSIONS: Psychological problems were not common in adult coeliac disease patients. Gluten-free diet had only a minor influence on the symptoms. Common knowledge about coeliac disease and the readily available gluten-free products may have had an impact on these results.},

   abstract = {This mini-review presents the research carried out within the context of two of the main hypotheses of the aetiology of coeliac disease. The enzymopathic hypothesis of the disease has been placed clearly as the underlying deficiency causing increased levels of toxic peptides, while the immunological hypothesis has been implicated in the pathogenesis of the disorder as the result of the action of undigested peptides in the small intestine. As a consequence, we are proposing a unified hypothesis of coeliac disease, which takes into account the actions of these undigested peptides through their direct cytotoxicity and their immunoactivity. At the same time, work aimed at defining some of these biologically active peptides, which could be said to be involved in the aetiopathogenesis of coeliac disease, will be reported. The review also focusses on the use of enzyme therapy for management of the disease, which when used in conjunction with the gluten-free diet, offers a safeguard against damage to the small intestine caused by small amounts of gluten.},

   abstract = {BACKGROUND & AIMS: Celiac disease may be associated with autoimmune diseases. The aims of the present study were to determine in celiac patients which factors modulate the risk of autoimmune disease and to evaluate the effect of the gluten-free diet. METHODS: The occurrence of autoimmune disease and compliance to gluten-free diet were specified retrospectively in 924 celiac patients recruited from 27 French pediatric and adult gastroenterology centers. RESULTS: One or several autoimmune diseases had developed in 178 patients. The cumulative risk of autoimmune disease was 8.1% +/- 1% at age 15, and 15.7% +/- 1.5% at age 30. Factors associated with an increased risk were family history of autoimmunity (hazard ratio, 2.36; 95% confidence interval, 1.71-3.31) and diagnosis of celiac disease before 36 years of age (hazard ratio, 2.65; 95% confidence interval, 1.79-3.85). After diagnosis of celiac disease, 55 of 788 patients developed an autoimmune disease. The cumulative risk of subsequent autoimmune disease was lower in patients compliant to a gluten-free diet versus noncompliant patients (at 10 years, 6% +/- 2% vs 15.6% +/- 5.9%, respectively; P = .02). The incidence of autoimmune diseases was 5.4 per 1000 patient-years during adherence to a gluten-free diet versus 11.3 per 1000 patient-years during nonadherence to the diet (P = .002). Results were similar in both the pediatric and the adult populations. CONCLUSIONS: Celiac patients most at risk for autoimmune disease are those diagnosed early in life and having a family history of autoimmunity. The gluten-free diet has a protective effect.},

We describe the case of a 68 years DQ-2 positive male who lost response to a strict gluten-free diet after an initial response over a 3-year period. His conditions became critical despite high dose prednisone treatment. After a careful differential diagnosis, the patient was classified as having a type I refractory coeliac disease and a single infusion of infliximab at 5mg/kg was given with excellent clinical results. However, clinical response was lost despite background therapy with azathioprine. Six months after the single infusion an induction therapy with infliximab and, thereafter, maintenance every 8 weeks was administered with excellent clinical results. Since small bowel histology recovered very slowly treatment was continued over the following 2 years with a return to near normal architecture. This case shows that anti-tumour necrosis factor treatment may be used in carefully selected patients with type I refractory coeliac disease.},

   abstract = {Celiac disease is poorly documented in intertropical Africa. The purpose of this retrospective report was to describe 8 cases observed at the Groupement Medico-Chirurgical of Bouffard Hospital in Djibouti (Horn of Africa) between January 2003 and January 2006. There were 5 females and 3 males ranging in age from 9 months to 17 years old (mean age: 48 months). Six patients were of Somali ethnic origin and two of Yemenite ethnic origin. Six were classified as middle class and 2 as lower class. All forms were symptomatic associating constant loss of weight with digestive manifestations (diarrhoea and vomiting). Diagnosis of celiac disease was based on the presence of anti-gliadin antibodies IgA and IgG associated with anti-endomysium or anti-transglutaminase antibodies that were measured in six and two cases respectively. Gastroduodenal endoscopy performed in three cases including two with duodenal biopsy demonstrated villous atrophy associated with gross of intra-epithelial lymphocytosis. A gluten-free diet initiated in five patients led to clinical improvement in four cases with a follow-up of 8.25 months. The findings of this study in Djibouti show that celiac disease exists in intertropical Africa. Its presentation is quite similar to elsewhere but diagnosis is more difficult due to poor knowledge about the disease and limited diagnostic facilities. Favourable response to presumptive treatment by a gluten-free diet is an alternative for diagnosis especially in Djibouti where eating habits differ from those in industrialized countries and this type of diet is easier to follow.},

Most common presenting symptoms included abdominal pain (83%), diarrhea (76%), and weight loss (69%). The mean delay in diagnosis was 11.7 years. Diagnoses made prior to celiac disease included anemia (40%), stress (31%), and irritable bowel syndrome (29%). Osteoporosis was common. Prior to diagnosis, 27% of respondents consulted three or more doctors about their symptoms. Delays in diagnosis of celiac disease remain a problem. Associated medical conditions occur frequently. More accurate food labeling is needed. Improved awareness of celiac disease and greater use of serological screening tests may result in earlier diagnosis and reduced risk of associated conditions.},

The aim of this study is to make a brief review of the literature about celiac disease and to report on a clinical case, showing the impact it may have on the general and oral health. A 39-year-old woman reported the presence of diarrhea, nauseas, flatulence, colic, difficulty with falling asleep, lack of appetite and loose of 18 Kg in the last two years. She also noted the appearance of symptomatic lesions in the mouth. These lesions had a mean duration of a month and occurred in any region of the oral mucosa, particularly on the tongue. Multiples ulcerations were found in the sublingual caruncula region, at the vestibular fornix and at the lingual apex. Topical treatment was instituted for the oral lesions with immediately relief of the symptoms. The diagnosis of celiac disease was established by means of medical clinical exam, biopsy of the small intestine, and by the presence of specific antibodies in the blood. The patient has been instructed to follow a gluten-free diet. Multiprofessional action with the involvement of a gastroenterologist and other health professionals, such as dentists, is important for diagnosing the disease and guiding the patient with celiac disease to achieve a good quality of life.},

   abstract = {BACKGROUND: Aetiopathogenesis of psoriasis is complex and not yet well known. In recent years, it has been observed that psoriasis can coexist with clinically asymptomatic celiac disease and a gluten-free diet helps to obtain remission, even in patients with very chronic lesions. OBJECTIVE: The aim of our work was to investigate how often the positive titres of antibodies characteristic for celiac disease occur in psoriatics' serum in exacerbation in comparison with controls. PATIENTS/METHODS: Serum samples from 67 patients with intensified psoriatic lesions were investigated. Serum from healthy people at a comparable age and with no familial predisposition to psoriasis and celiac disease was the control material. Antibodies against human tissue transglutaminase (recombinant antigen), against tissue transglutaminase isolated from guinea pig's liver and against gliadin were determined by enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay technique. Anti-endomysial antibodies were determined by indirect immunofluorescence method. RESULTS: Patients with psoriasis have significantly higher mean concentrations of antibodies against tissue transglutaminase (human recombinant and guinea pig-derived antigen) and against gliadin for IgA. IgA antibodies against tissue transglutaminase (both antigens) and gliadin positively correlate with psoriasis activity. No anti-endomysial antibodies for IgA were found in any serum. CONCLUSIONS: Our results seem to imply an association between psoriasis and asymptomatic celiac disease/gluten intolerance. High percentage of positive results to guinea pig-derived tTG could be due to cellular activity of tissue transglutaminase in psoriasis.},

   abstract = {OBJECTIVE: To evaluate the prevalence of beta-cell autoimmunity and the usefulness of a type 1 diabetes screening in patients with celiac disease. RESEARCH DESIGN AND METHODS: We measured GAD antibodies (GADAs), insulinoma-associated protein 2 antigens (IA-2As), and insulin autoantibodies (IAAs) in 188 young Italian patients with celiac disease (66 male [35.1%]). Mean age at celiac disease diagnosis was 5.4 years (0.5-17.1), and mean celiac disease duration was 4.2 years (0-28.8). Celiac disease was diagnosed by jejunal biopsy after positivity for endomysial and tissue transglutaminase antibody was confirmed. RESULTS: GADAs were positive in seven patients (3.7%), and IA-2As were positive in two patients. IAAs were negative in all cases. Metabolic evaluation was normal, and no patients developed diabetes during follow-up. There was no significant association among beta-cell autoimmunity and sex, age, pubertal stage, family history, or coexistence of other autoimmune disorders; compliance to a gluten-free diet was confirmed. CONCLUSIONS: Our results showed a low prevalence of beta-cell autoimmunity and do not support a precocious screening for beta-cell autoimmunity in young celiac disease patients.},

   abstract = {The endocannabinoid system is upregulated in both human inflammatory bowel diseases and experimental models of colitis. In this study, we investigated whether this upregulation is a marker also of celiac disease-induced atrophy. The levels of the cannabinoid CB(1) receptor, of the endocannabinoids, anandamide, and 2-arachidonoyl-glycerol (2-AG), and of the anti-inflammatory mediator palmitoylethanolamide (PEA) were analyzed in bioptic samples from the duodenal mucosa of celiac patients at first diagnosis assessed by the determination of antiendomysial antibodies and histological examination. Samples were analyzed during the active phase of atrophy and after remission and compared to control samples from non-celiac patients. The levels of anandamide and PEA were significantly elevated (approx. 2- and 1.8-fold, respectively) in active celiac patients and so were those of CB(1) receptors. Anandamide levels returned to normal after remission with a gluten-free diet. We also analyzed endocannabinoid and PEA levels in the jejunum of rats 2, 3, and 7 days after treatment with methotrexate, which causes inflammatory features (assessed by histopathological analyses and myeloperoxidase activity) similar to those of celiac patients. In both muscle/serosa and mucosa layers, the levels of anandamide, 2-AG, and PEA peaked 3 days after treatment and returned to basal levels at remission, 7 days after treatment. Thus, intestinal endocannabinoid levels peak with atrophy and regress with remission in both celiac patients and methotrexate-treated rats. The latter might be used as a model to study the role of the endocannabinoid system in celiac disease.},

MBL plasma concentration is genetically determined and varies significantly among individuals. Recent findings suggest that MBL is associated with the pathogenesis of celiac disease (CD). In this study, MBL and C-reactive protein (CRP) levels were determined in 101 celiac patients and 120 controls, with the aim to associate with the presence of gluten in the diet, disease severity, and the presence of concomitant autoimmune diseases. MBL concentration was determined by ELISA and CRP by nephelometry, using a high-sensitivity method. EmA-IgA and other autoantibodies were tested by indirect immunofluorescence. Although a significant increase in MBL levels was observed in male patients compared to female (P = 0.024), the absence of any other association suggests that circulating MBL and CRP concentrations are not associated with clinical and autoimmune CD features in Brazilian patients.},

   abstract = {Celiac disease (CD) is characterized by villous atrophy and an increase in intraepithelial lymphocytes (IEL). The IEL usually exhibit a suppressor/cytotoxic phenotype (CD3 and CD8) and display a polyclonal profile for T-cell receptor (TCR) rearrangement as opposed to the monoclonality of refractory CD (RCD) with CD8 IEL. A complication of CD is the loss of response to a gluten-free diet called RCD that may progress to an enteropathy-associated T-cell lymphoma. We reviewed 20 uncomplicated CD and 23 complicated CD (19 RCD and 4 diagnosed at the same time as enteropathy-associated T-cell lymphoma). In complicated CD, the IEL phenotype was CD8 in 9 cases and CD8 in 14 cases. In 100% of cases, IEL showed a monoclonal TCR rearrangement. All the 9 CD8 complicated CD exhibited a monoclonal TCR rearrangement and 3 of them were associated with a T-cell lymphoma (2 at the same time as CD and 1 after 43-mo follow-up) and bore the same monoclonal rearrangement in IEL and in lymphoma. Interestingly, the 13 cases (100%) of CD with a CD8 phenotype were also found monoclonal and 2 of them were associated with a T-cell lymphoma diagnosed at the same time as CD and exhibiting the same rearrangement in IEL and in lymphoma. An aberrant CD3 CD8 IEL phenotype is a good criterion for RCD diagnosis. However, cases with a normal CD3 CD8 IEL phenotype may correspond to RCD. In such cases, we suggest that molecular analysis of TCR-gamma genes is a useful method for identifying cases with RCD.},

Antimitochondrial antibody M2 band, anti-endomysial antibody, antigliadin IgA and IgM were positive. Histopathologic findings of the liver revealed PBC and duodenal biopsy was consistent with CD. She was also found to have osteomalacia. She showed slow response to gluten-free diet, but accelerated full recovery with vitamin D replacement. CONCLUSION: In PBC patients with subclinical CD and myopathy, vitamin D status can provide a basis for treatment.},

The sourdough cultures consisted of Lactobacillus sanfranciscensis LS40 and LS41 and Lactobacillus plantarum CF1 and were selected and used for the manufacture of GF bread. Fermentation occurred in two steps: (i) long-time fermentation (16 h) and (ii) fast fermentation (1.5 h) using the previous fermented sourdough as inoculum (ca. 43%, wt/wt) with Saccharomyces cerevisiae (baker's yeast). GF bread started with baker's yeast alone was used as the control. Gluten was added to ingredients before fermentation to simulate contamination. Initial gluten concentration of 400 ppm was degraded to below 20 ppm only in the sourdough GF bread. Before baking, sourdough GF bread showed phytase activity ca. sixfold higher than that of GF bread started with baker's yeast alone. Atomic absorption spectrophotometric analysis revealed that the higher phytase activity resulted in an increased availability of free Ca2+, Zn2+, and Mg2+. The concentration of free amino acids also was the highest in sourdough GF bread. Sourdough GF bread had a higher specific volume and was less firm than GF bread started with baker's yeast alone. This study highlighted the use of selected sourdough cultures to eliminate risks of contamination by gluten and to enhance the nutritional properties of GF bread.},

   abstract = {Celiac disease is an autoimmune illness characterized by intestinal mucosal injury and malabsorption precipitated by dietary exposure to gluten of some cereals. The immune response is based on both cellular and humoral components, although the former seem to be more important in the pathogenesis. The autoantibody response is directed at the enzyme tissue transglutaminase, tTG or TG2, which possibly play a role in the onset of the disease. In this study we sought to develop an animal model in which to analyze the immunological regulation and significance of anti-TG2 antibodies, by expressing specific human single-chain antibody fragments in mice using adeno-associated virus vectors. Upon vector injection in the skeletal muscles, high and persistent systemic levels of anti-TG2 antibodies were obtained. Mice injected with vectors encoding antibodies also recognizing rodent TG2, also developed a strong anti-idiotypic response. This finding raises the question of whether an anti-idiotypic response to anti-TG2 antibodies is a factor associated with celiac disease.},

   abstract = {BACKGROUND & AIMS: Dendritic cells (DCs) play a crucial role in immune responses by controlling the extent and type of T-cell response to antigen. Celiac disease is a condition in which T-cell immunity to gluten plays an important pathogenic role, yet information on DCs is scant. We examined mucosal DCs in celiac disease in terms of phenotype, activation/maturation state, cytokine production, and function. METHODS: Mucosal DCs from 48 celiacs and 30 controls were investigated by flow cytometry. In situ distribution of DCs was analyzed by confocal microscopy. Interferon (IFN)-alfa, interleukin (IL)-4, IL-5, IL-12p35, IL-12p40, IL-18, IL-23p19, IL-27, and transforming growth factor-beta transcripts were measured by real-time reverse-transcription polymerase chain reaction in sorted DCs. DC expression of IL-6, IL-12p40, and IL-10 was assessed by intracellular cytokine staining. The effect of IFN-alfa and IL-18 blockade on the gluten-induced IFN-gamma response in celiac biopsy specimens grown ex vivo also was investigated. RESULTS: Mucosal DCs were increased in untreated, but not treated, celiacs. The majority of them were plasmacytoid with higher levels of maturation (CD83) and activation (CD80/CD86) markers. Higher transcripts of Th1 relevant cytokines, such as IFN-alfa, IL-18, and IL-23p19, were produced by celiac DCs, but because IL-12p40 was undetectable, a role for IL-23 is unlikely. Intracellular cytokine staining of celiac DCs showed higher IL-6, but lower IL-10 expression, and confirmed the lack of IL-12p40. Blocking IFN-alfa inhibited IFN-gamma transcripts in ex vivo organ culture of celiac biopsy specimens challenged with gluten. CONCLUSIONS: These data suggest that IFN-alfa-producing DCs contribute to the Th1 response in celiac disease.},

There were no positive findings, except for diverticulosis. Almost 5 years later repeat investigations performed in response to the patient's anemia confirmed the development of celiac disease. After 18 months of symptom improvement as a result of gluten exclusion the patient developed diarrhea, and colonoscopy revealed ulcerative colitis. INVESTIGATIONS: Physical examination; analysis of full blood count; measurement of serum ferritin, vitamin B(12), folate and C-reactive protein levels; thyroid and autoantibody profiling (including analysis of endomysial and tissue transglutaminase antibodies); CT scanning of the chest, abdomen and pelvis; and performance of esophagogastroduodenoscopy, push enteroscopy, colonoscopy and wireless capsule endoscopy. DIAGNOSIS: Celiac disease and ulcerative colitis. MANAGEMENT: Gluten-free diet, mesalazine and prednisolone.},

   abstract = {OBJECTIVE: Hyperhomocysteinaemia is considered to be a risk factor for cardiovascular disease (particularly stroke) and has been implicated in recurrent miscarriage and osteoporotic fracture, recognized manifestations of coeliac disease (CD). The objective of this study was to compare plasma homocysteine levels and biomarker status of metabolically related B vitamins (folate, vitamin B(12), B(6) and riboflavin) in treated and untreated CD patients and healthy controls. MATERIAL AND METHODS: CD patients attending a clinic for either initial or follow-up biopsy (at least 12 months after commencing a gluten-free diet) were categorized into three groups: 1) newly diagnosed (untreated; n=35); 2) persistent villous atrophy (VA) at follow-up (n=24) or 3) recovered VA at follow-up (n=41). Blood samples were analysed for plasma homocysteine, serum and red cell folate and serum vitamin B(12) levels, and for plasma pyridoxal 5-phosphate (PLP, vitamin B(6)) and riboflavin (vitamin B(2)) status. RESULTS: Homocysteine concentrations were significantly higher (p=0.05) and red cell and serum folate significantly lower (p<0.001) in untreated patients compared with controls, while all three reached normal levels in recovered VA patients. Although untreated and persistent VA patients tended to have lower B(12) levels, these did not reach significance. There was no evidence of compromised B(6) or riboflavin status, even in untreated CD patients. Homocysteine concentrations were inversely associated with both serum (r=-0.421; p<0.001) and red cell (r=-0.459; p<0.001) folate and with serum vitamin B(12) (r=-0.353; p=0.001). CONCLUSIONS: Gluten exclusion in CD improves folate status and normalizes homocysteine concentrations. Reducing the risk of homocysteine-related disease may be another reason for aggressive diagnosis and treatment of CD.},

The prevalence of the disease is approximately 1:133. Celiac disease can cause significant morbidity. The only treatment is a gluten-free diet. A genome-wide search of 405 microsatellite markers was performed on samples from 18 Bedouin families with a minimum of two cases of celiac disease. Non-parametric and parametric (including both dominant and recessive models of inheritance) linkage analyses were performed. The most significant genome-wide linkage evidence was at chromosome 3p26 with an HLod of 3.21, under the dominant model. The only other HLod or NPL greater than 2 was at 4q35, with an HLod of 2.15 under a dominant model. The region at 3p26, previously reported in two linkage analyses, harbors interleukin receptor genes, plausible candidates for celiac disease.},

   abstract = {BACKGROUND & AIMS: Celiac disease is an enteropathy featuring villous atrophy, crypt hyperplasia, and lymphocytosis. Tissue remodeling is driven by an inflammatory reaction to gluten in genetically susceptible individuals. The adaptive pathway is considered the major immune response but recent evidence has indicated the involvement of innate immunity as well. To assess the contribution of either immune response we performed global gene expression profiling of the regenerating mucosa. METHODS: Microarray hybridizations were performed with biopsy samples from 13 untreated patients, 31 patients on a gluten-free diet in various stages of remission, and 21 controls. Additional data were generated using low-density array and conventional quantitative reverse-transcription polymerase chain reaction, and immunohistochemistry. RESULTS: A total of 108 differentially expressed immune-related genes were identified (50 innate, 43 adaptive, 9 both innate/adaptive, and 6 immunoregulatory). Expression levels showed a gradual change as opposed to the discrete histological transitions. In addition to details provided on the adaptive and innate immune pathways used, we observed a chronic recruitment of activated neutrophils. Neutrophil involvement was unabated in otherwise completely normalized remission patients. CONCLUSIONS: We observed a contribution of both the innate and adaptive immune response in celiac disease pathogenesis. The discrepancy between the histological classification and the observed incremental change in immune-gene expression may have consequences for current diagnostic inclusion criteria. Enhanced neutrophil infiltration in both active and remission patients points to a genetic impairment of the intestinal barrier that may contribute to the cause rather than the consequence of celiac disease.},

He was examined at a military hospital where electromyoneurography showed the signs of distal sensory-motor polyneuropathy with axon demyelinization and weak myopathic changes, whereas histopathological examination of gastrocnemius muscle biopsy revealed some mild and nonspecific myopathy. Besides, he was found to have subcutaneous ankle tissue edemas and hypertransaminasemia. Due to these reasons, he was dismissed from the military service and examined at another hospital where bone osteodensitometry revealed low bone mineral density of the spine. However, his medical problems were not resolved and after the second discharge from hospital he was desperately seeing doctors from time to time. Finally, at our institution he was shown to have celiac disease (CD) by positive serology (antitissue transglutaminase and antiendomysial antibodies) and small bowel mucosal histopathological examination, which showed total small bowel villous atrophy. Three months after the initiation of gluten-free diet, his ankle edema disappeared, electromyoneurographic signs of polyneuropathy improved and liver aminotransferases normalized. Good knowledge of CD extraintestinal signs and serologic screening are essential for early CD recognition and therapy.},

She had been treated previously with an antibiotic for diarrhea. Laboratory analyses showed the presence of iron-deficiency anemia, mild hypoalbuminemia, and considerably prolonged prothrombin time and activated thromboplastin time. Tests revealed that hemostasis improved after the patient received fresh frozen plasma. A coagulation profile showed a decrease in clotting factors II, VII, IX, and X. The patient was given intravenous vitamin K therapy (5 mg/d) for 3 d. All coagulation tests were normalized, and bruising started to disappear. Positive serology (immunoglobulin A antitissue transglutaminase and immunoglobulin A antiendomysial antibodies) and smallbowel mucosal histopathology confirmed the presence of celiac disease (CD). The girl recovered completely after she was put on a gluten-free diet. Vitamin K-deficiency bleeding is a rare complication that occurs almost exclusively in patients with typical CD manifestations. In addition to antibiotic therapy, treatment with other drugs that influence vitamin K resorption and metabolism may increase the risk of bleeding in patients with CD with hypoprothrombinemia.},

BACKGROUND: IgA TTGA are found in the serum of most individuals with CD. This serologic marker is used to screen individuals with suspected CD for duodenal biopsy, the gold standard of CD diagnosis. Data suggest strongly positive IgA TTGA >or= 100 units are highly specific for CD histopathology in pediatric patients and may be sufficient for diagnosis. STUDY: Records of adult and pediatric subjects in the celiac study at the University of Utah and University of California Irvine were reviewed for strongly positive TTGA. Pathology reports from duodenal biopsies of subjects with IgA TTGA >or= 100 units were graded as 0 to 3 by modified Marsh criteria. RESULTS: From a pool of 1882 subjects with IgA TTGA assayed, 208 had IgA TTGA >or= 100 units. Seventy-six of these, including 28 children and 48 adults, also had duodenal biopsies. Villous atrophy (Marsh 3 histopathology) was found on biopsy in 73 (96%) of these subjects. The remaining 3 subjects had intermediate Marsh histology. One (Marsh 1) had a complete serologic response to a gluten-free diet and 2 had Marsh 2 lesions and positive endomysium, making early CD most likely. CONCLUSIONS: IgA TTGA >or= 100 units occur almost exclusively in the setting of Marsh 3 duodenal histopathology in adults and children. Rare cases without villous atrophy were marked by intermediate Marsh changes suggestive of early CD. IgA TTGA >or= 100 arbitrary units indicate duodenal changes consistent with CD.},

Enhancing the activity and stability of PEPs under gastric conditions (low pH, high pepsin concentration) is a challenge for protein engineers. Using a combination of sequence- and structure-based approaches together with machine learning algorithms, we have identified improved variants of the Sphingomonas capsulata PEP, a target of clinical relevance. Through two rounds of iterative mutagenesis and analysis, variants with as much as 20% enhanced specific activity at pH 4.5 and 200-fold greater resistance to pepsin were identified. Our results vividly reinforce the concept that conservative changes in proteins, especially in hydrophobic residues within tightly packed regions, can profoundly influence protein structure and function in ways that are difficult to predict entirely from first principles and must therefore be optimized through iterative design and analytical cycles. Incubation with whole wheat bread under simulated gastric conditions also suggests that some variants have pharmacologically significant improvements in gluten detoxification activity.},

Contamination of many oats products with wheat, rye and particularly barley, together with inadequacy of available gluten-testing systems may account, at least in part, for the confusion. Some clear evidence has, however, emerged in the past few years that a small number of gluten-sensitive patients display a specific small intestinal T cell response to oat peptides that cannot be explained by contamination with other cereals. Oats could form a potentially useful part of a gluten-free diet, but patients require careful advice and monitoring, backed by robust gluten-assay techniques.},

   abstract = {Coeliac disease is a multifactorial disease characterized by a dysregulated immune response to ingested wheat gluten and related cereal proteins. With an incidence of about 1% of the general population, it is considered the most common food intolerance disorder. The mainstay of coeliac disease treatment is strict lifelong adherence to a gluten-free diet. Elimination of gluten and related proteins from the diet leads to clinical and histological improvement. However, some patients do not respond to dietary therapy and others have poor dietary compliance. This has prompted the search for a therapy alternative to a gluten-free diet. Tissue transglutaminase is a crucial factor in coeliac disease because it promotes the gluten-specific T-cell response and is also the target of the autoimmune response. Tissue transglutaminase induces changes in gluten, which in turn, cause the generation of a series of gluten peptides that bind to HLA-DQ2 or DQ8 molecules with high affinity. The resulting HLA-DQ2 (DQ8)-gluten peptide interaction triggers the proinflammatory T cell response. Tissue transglutaminase is also involved in other non-T-cell-mediated biological activities of gliadin peptides. For these reasons, tissue transglutaminase is a potential target for therapeutic intervention. In this paper we review the state-of-the-art of tissue transglutaminase inhibition, and examine known and new-generation inhibitors and their activity in in vitro and in vivo models. We also examine their potential as therapeutic tools for coeliac disease.},

   abstract = {BACKGROUND & AIMS: Enteric glia participates to the homeostasis of the gastrointestinal tract. In the central nervous system, increased expression of astroglial-derived S100B protein has been associated with the onset and maintaining of inflammation. The role of enteric glial-derived S100B protein in gastrointestinal inflammation has never been investigated in humans. In this study, we evaluated the expression of S100B and its relationship with nitric oxide production in celiac disease. METHODS: Duodenal biopsy specimens from untreated and on gluten-free diet patients with celiac disease and controls were respectively processed for S100B and inducible nitric oxide synthase (iNOS) protein expression and nitrite production. To evaluate the direct involvement of S100B in the inflammation, control biopsy specimens were exposed to exogenous S100B, and iNOS protein expression and nitrite production were measured. We also tested gliadin induction of S100B-dependent inflammation in cultured biopsy specimens deriving from on gluten-free diet patients in the absence or presence of the specific S100B antibody. RESULTS: S100B messenger RNA and protein expression, iNOS protein expression, and nitrite production were significantly increased in untreated patients but not in on gluten-free diet patients vs controls. Addition of S100B to control biopsy specimens resulted in a significant increase of iNOS protein expression and nitrite production. In celiac disease patients but not in controls biopsy specimens, gliadin challenge significantly increased S100B messenger RNA and protein expression, iNOS protein expression, and nitrite production, but these effects were completely inhibited by S100B antibody. CONCLUSIONS: Enteric glial-derived S100B is increased in the duodenum of patients with celiac disease and plays a role in nitric oxide production.},

   abstract = {OBJECTIVE: The B cell-activating factor of the tumour necrosis factor (TNF) family (BAFF) was recently described as a critical survival factor for B cells, and its expression is increased in several autoimmune diseases. Abnormal production of BAFF disturbs immune tolerance allowing the survival of autoreactive B cells and participates in the progression of B-cell lymphomas. Coeliac disease (CD) is a common autoimmune disorder induced by gluten intake in genetically predisposed individuals, associated with autoantibody production and with an increased risk of lymphoma at follow-up. The purpose of this study was to investigate the possible implications of BAFF in CD. MATERIAL AND METHODS: Seventy-three patients with small-bowel biopsies and laboratory-proven diagnosis of CD were included in the study. All serum samples were analysed before the start of a gluten-free diet (GFD). In 12 cases, one or more samples were analysed during follow-up of the GFD. Seventy-seven blood donors were taken as controls. Serum BAFF levels and anti-transglutaminase (a-tTG) antibodies were assessed by ELISA and endomysial antibodies by indirect immunofluorescence. RESULTS: Serum BAFF levels appeared to be significantly more elevated in CD patients than in controls (p<0.0001) and, compared with other autoimmune diseases where BAFF is increased, a much larger percentage (80.8%) of CD patients presented BAFF levels above the normal range. In addition, serum BAFF levels were found to correlate with a-tTG antibody levels (p =0.0007) and there was a significant reduction of BAFF after introduction of a GFD. CONCLUSIONS: BAFF may represent a possible pathogenic factor in CD. Its implications for the diagnosis, prognosis and treatment of CD should also be assessed.},

   abstract = {OBJECTIVE: The aim of this article is to determine the prevalence of celiac disease (CD), Helicobacter pylori (H. pylori) and gastroesophageal reflux (GER) in patients with resistant iron deficiency anemia (IDA). PATIENTS: The study included 25 patients <18 years of age with refractory IDA (not responding to iron therapy for 3 months in a dose of 6 mg elemental iron/kg/day). METHODS: All patients included in the study were subjected to careful history taking and thorough clinical examination. Blood sample was taken for analysis of antibodies for CD including: antigliadin antibody (AGA), antiendomysial antibody (EMA), antireticulin antibody (ARA) and antitissue Transglutaminase (tTg) IgG antibody. Anti-H. pylori IgG antibodies and a (13)C-urea breath test (UBT) was done to all patients to diagnose H. pylori. Upper gastrointestinal tract endoscopy was done for all patients to evaluate for the presence of some etiologies of intractable anemia as chronic blood loss. These included: CD, H. pylori infection and GER. The upper gastrointestinal tract endoscopy was also done to evaluate the presence of bleeding spots, ulcers or angiomatous malformations. In addition, gastric antral biopsies were taken for diagnosis of H. pylori infection by the following tests: rapid urease test, histopathological examination and culture. RESULTS: CD was positive in 11 out of 25 patients (44%), H. pylori infection in 12 out of 25 patients (48%), while GER was diagnosed in 11 out of 25 patients (44%). Patients with CD had age of presentation < or =2 years in two patients (18.2%) while the remaining nine patients (81.8%) had age of presentation >2 years and it was statistically significant (p = 0.05*). Also patients with H. pylori had age of presentation < or =4 years in five patients (41.7%) and the remaining seven patients (81.8%) had age of presentation >4 years and it was statistically significant (p = 0.03*). Logistic regression analysis demonstrated that the risk factors for severity of anemia were age of patients and duration of anemia. On the other hand, other parameters have no significant influence on the severity of anemia. Also risk factors of short stature were age of presentation of anemia, degree of anemia and H. pylori infection. AGA had the highest sensitivity (100%) followed by antiendomysium antibody (81.8%) while the tTG antibody had the highest specificity (85.7%) for diagnosis of CD. UBT and histopathology had the highest sensitivity (100%) for diagnosis of H. pylori while rapid urease test, culture, H. pylori stool antigen and anti-H. pylori IgG antibody had the highest specificity (100%). In conclusion, refractory IDA may be due to clinically unapparent H. pylori gastritis and CD. CD is one of the most common causes of intestinal malabsorption during childhood which leads to impairment of iron absorption. Apart from offering them gluten-free diet rich in iron, early detection and treatment of IDA and prophylactic iron and folic acid supplementation will go a long way to optimize their mental and psychological functions. Eradication of H. pylori infection with concomitant iron therapy should correct the anemia.},

There is not definite scientific evidence about AND AIMS: which are the recommended explorations to be performed in the diagnostic workup of patients with functional diarrhea. The aim was to assess prospectively the presence of gluten-sensitive enteropathy, bile acid malabsorption, and sugar malabsorption in consecutive patients with chronic watery diarrhea of obscure origin fulfilling Rome II criteria of functional disease. METHODS: A total of 62 patients with chronic watery diarrhea, defined as more than 3 loose or liquid bowel movements a day for at least 4 wk and a stool weight >200 g/day were included. The following tests were performed: (a) HLA-DQ2/DQ8 genotyping, and if positive, endoscopic biopsies from distal duodenum were obtained, and intestinal damage assessed; (b) SeHCAT (Se-homotaurocholate) abdominal retention test; (c) small bowel follow-through; and (d) hydrogen breath test (lactose, fructose + sorbitol). Gluten- or sugar-free diet, or cholestyramine was administered according to results. Functional disease was diagnosed if all tests performed were normal or if either there was no response to specific therapy or diarrhea relapsed during a 12-month follow-up. RESULTS: Bile acid malabsorption was considered to be the cause of diarrhea in 28 (45.2%) patients, sugar malabsorption in 10 (16.1%), gluten-sensitive enteropathy in 10 (16.1%), and both bile acid and sugar malabsorption in 2 patients. Twelve (19.4%) patients remained without a specific diagnosis and were considered as functional bowel disease. Diarrhea stopped in the 50 patients after specific treatment, decreasing the daily stool number from 5.4 +/- 0.3 to 1.5 +/- 0.1 (P < 0.0005), without relapse after the 12-months follow-up. CONCLUSIONS: The diagnosis of functional disease in patients with chronic watery diarrhea should be performed with caution since in most cases there is an organic cause that justifies diarrhea.},

   abstract = {Celiac disease (CD) is a small intestinal enteropathy caused by permanent intolerance to wheat gluten. Active disease is characterized by a prominent cytokine response of intraepithelial lymphocytes (IELs) to gluten-containing diet with concomitant increase in expression of pro-inflammatory IFN-gamma and down-regulatory IL-10 without increase in tumor necrosis factor-alpha (TNF-alpha) or transforming growth factor-beta1 (TGF-beta1). The aim was to understand the local immune reaction by determining which intraepithelial T cell subsets produce the different cytokines. The three major IEL-subsets gammadeltaIELs, CD4(+)alphabetaIELs and CD8(+)alphabetaIELs, as well as CD94(+)CD8(+)alphabetaIELs, selectively expanded in active CD, were retrieved from small intestinal biopsies of children with active CD and controls and analyzed quantitatively for cytokine mRNA expression. In active CD, CD8(+)alphabetaIELs showed a significant increase in expression levels of both IFN-gamma and IL-10. CD8(+)alphabetaIELs were also the IEL subset with highest expression level per cell of both cytokines and constituted the cellular source for almost all IFN-gamma and most IL-10. Expression levels of both cytokines were higher in CD94(-)CD8(+)alphabetaIELs than CD94(+)CD8(+)alphabetaIELs. TNF-alpha levels were only increased in CD4(+)alphabetaIELs, which also showed the highest expression level per cell and constituted the major source of this cytokine. Interestingly, IL-10 was increased also in CD4(+)alphabetaIELs. Cytokine levels were low in gammadeltaIELs. 'Classical' CD94(-)CD8(+)alphabeta T cells within the epithelium are responsible for the excessive production of IFN-gamma, believed to drive the formation of intestinal lesions in active CD. Production of IL-10 may be a common feature of IELs producing pro-inflammatory cytokines, thereby attempting to limit inflammation in an autocrine fashion.},

Apparently, the endoscopic and histological changes are similar to celiac disease before treatment, but these are not altered by any form of dietary restriction, including a gluten-free diet. As in celiac disease, histologic changes in gastric and colonic biopsies have also been recorded. Anti-enterocyte antibodies detected with immunofluorescent methods have been reported by a few laboratories, but these antibodies appear not to be specific and may simply represent epiphenomena. A widely available, reproducible and quantitative anti-enterocyte antibody assay is needed that could be applied in small bowel disorders that have the histological appearance of celiac disease, but fail to respond to a gluten-free diet.},

Conversely, tissue transglutaminase antibodies have been detected in autoimmune disorders, including systemic lupus erythematosus (SLE), but cases of celiac disease with SLE have been only rarely recorded. METHODS: In this study, 246 patients with biopsy-defined celiac disease were evaluated for a prior diagnosis of SLE on the basis of American Rheumatological Association-defined clinical and serologic parameters. RESULTS: There were 6 patients with celiac disease and SLE, or 2.4%, including 4 females and 2 males. Their mean age at diagnosis of celiac disease was 44.7 years and SLE 50 years. In all patients, the diagnosis of SLE was established from 2 years to more than 10 years after the diagnosis of celiac disease, with a mean of 5.3 years. The celiac disease in all 6 patients responded to a gluten-free diet with histologic normalization of the small intestinal biopsies. Despite this small bowel biopsy response, SLE appeared later in the clinical course of the celiac disease. CONCLUSIONS: This study suggests that SLE occurs far more frequently in biopsy-defined celiac disease than is currently appreciated, and detection may be more likely if the period of clinical follow-up of the celiac disease is prolonged.},

   abstract = {Celiac disease may initially present as a neurological disorder. Alternatively, celiac disease may be complicated by neurological changes. With impaired nutrient absorption, different deficiency syndromes may occur and these may be manifested clinically with neurological changes. However, in patients with deficiency syndromes, extensive involvement of the small intestine with celiac disease is often evident. There are a number of reports of celiac disease associated with neuropathy, ataxia, dementia and seizure disorder. In these reports, there is no clear relationship with nutrient deficiency and a precise mechanism for the neurological changes has not been defined. A small number of patients have been reported to have responded to vitamin E administration, but most do not. In some, gluten antibodies have also been described, especially in those with ataxia, but a consistent response to a gluten-free diet has not been defined. Screening for celiac disease should be considered in patients with unexplained neurological disorders, including ataxia and dementia. Further studies are needed, however, to determine if a gluten-free diet will lead to improvement in the associated neurological disorder.},

   abstract = {In adults with diarrhea or suspected malabsorption, a diagnosis of celiac disease requires that two criteria be fulfilled: first, a demonstration of typical pathological changes of untreated disease in biopsies from the proximal small bowel; and second, evidence should exist that clinical (and/or pathological) changes are gluten-dependent, most often as an unequivocal response to a gluten-free diet. Pathological abnormalities of celiac disease may include severe ('flat') or variably severe (mild or moderate) small bowel mucosal architectural abnormalities that are associated with both epithelial cell and lymphoid cell changes, including intraepithelial lymphocytosis. Architectural changes tend to be most severe in the duodenum and proximal jejunum and less severe, or absent, in the ileum. These findings, while characteristic of celiac disease, are not specific because several other conditions can produce similar changes. Some serological assays (eg, tissue transglutaminase antibody assays) are very useful screening tools in clinical practice because of their high specificity and sensitivity, but these do not provide a definitive diagnosis. The most critical step in the diagnosis of celiac disease is the demonstration of its gluten-dependent nature. The clinical response to gluten restriction in celiac disease is usually reflected in the resolution of diarrhea and weight gain. Normalization of biopsy changes can be first shown in the most distal intestinal sites of involvement, and later, sometimes only after prolonged periods (months to years) in the duodenum. Rarely, recurrent (or refractory) celiac disease may occur after an initial gluten-free diet response. Finally, some with 'sprue-like intestinal disease' cannot be classified because a diet response fails to occur. This may be a heterogeneous group, although some are eventually found to have a malignant lymphoma.},

   abstract = {Celiac disease is a gluten-dependent small intestinal mucosal disorder that causes malabsorption, often with diarrhea and weight loss. Diagnosis is based on detection of typical biopsy changes in the proximal small bowel, followed by evidence for an unequivocal response to a gluten-free diet. Refractoriness in celiac disease may be due to poor diet compliance, sometimes intentional, or consumption of ubiquitious sources of gluten. Alternatively, the original diagnosis may not be correct (eg., duodenal Crohn's disease), or a second cause for symptoms may be present (eg., collagenous colitis, functional bowel disorder). In some with recurrent symptoms, a complication may be present (eg., collagenous sprue, small bowel carcinoma, lymphoma). In some, a response to a gluten-free diet can not be unequivocally defined, and more precise historical terms have been used including "sprue-like intestinal disease" or "unclassified sprue". Although a "wastebasket diagnosis", these likely represent a heterogeneous group, and some, but not all, may develop lymphoma. Precise definition will be critical in the future as an array of new treatments, including biological agents, may emerge.},

This together with the global increased incidence of celiac disease (CD) and that these increases cannot be explained by genetic factors suggest a common environmental factor for these two diseases. Even though enterovirus (EV) infections are believed to trigger T1D and gluten is the trigger of CD, the increasing intake of gluten containing products all over the world could be the trigger for both diseases directly and indirectly. It has been shown that the duration of exposure to gluten is related to the prevalence of T1D. It has also been shown that T1D patients at onset have an inflammatory reaction in the gut. Hence, early diagnose of CD followed by elimination of dietary gluten will lead to a decreased incidence of T1D.},

The cause of pain is usually multifactorial with a complex interplay of factors contributing to a varying degree to the pain in an individual patient and, therefore, a rigid standardized approach for pain control tends to lead to suboptimal results. Pain management usually proceeds in a stepwise approach beginning with general lifestyle recommendations. Low fat diet, alcohol and smoking cessation are encouraged. Analgesics alone are needed in almost all patients. Maneuvers aimed at suppression of pancreatic secretion are routinely tried. Patients with ongoing symptoms may be candidates for more invasive options such as endoscopic therapy, and resective or drainage surgery. The role of pain modifying agents (antidepressants, gabapentin, peregabalin), celiac plexus block, antioxidants, octreotide and total pancreatectomy with islet cell auto transplantation remains to be determined.},

   abstract = {OBJECTIVE: The aim of this study was to determine the prevalence of celiac disease among the adult population of Madrid by measuring antibodies against tissue transglutaminase as serologic screening method. POPULATION AND METHODS: 2,215 subjects participated voluntarily in this study. All of them completed a clinical questionnaire. We determined the levels of total IgA and antibodies to tissue transglutaminase (tTG). An intestinal biopsy by endoscopy was proposed to all subjects who were tTG-positive. The histologic lesion was classified in accordance to Marsh. RESULTS: Three known CD cases were identified by the questionnaire. Eleven donors with tTG positivity were detected, all of them asymptomatic. Four subjects rejected the intestinal biopsy. Seven out of 11 positive subjects consented to undergo a duodenal biopsy -3 had villous atrophy and 4 had increased intraepithelial lymphocyte counts with normal villi. In our study the number of donors with biopsy-proven CD was 6, and the prevalence was 1/370. If we include the subcategories of gluten sensitive enteropathy (Marsh I), the prevalence would be 1/222. When we considered antibody positivity the prevalence of gluten sensitivity was 1 in 201, and it reached 1 in 158 when the three known CD cases were included. CONCLUSIONS: Data on CD prevalence in this study confirm that CD is a first-line healthcare problem that may warrant universal screening. We detected a high number of lymphocytic enteritis cases, and thus some sort of action is mandatory.},

The objective of this study was to review the literature in order to arrive at a firm recommendation. MATERIAL AND METHODS: Electronic databases were searched up to February 2006 using the terms "oats" and "coeliac disease". RESULTS: Twenty relevant studies were found and presented. Early studies were small and uncontrolled and mostly indirect. In 10 studies involving 165 patients, only 1 patient was shown to have histological damage as a result of consuming oats. CONCLUSIONS: Coeliac patients can, to some advantage, include oats in a GFD although there may be the occasional patient who is also oats sensitive. Previous conflicting results may have been partly due to contamination of oats by wheat. Lest contamination is present and exceeds the safe threshold, we recommend that coeliac patients should only add oats to their GFD when they are established on a conventional GFD, and stop eating oats if they develop any symptoms.},

CD is an immune-mediated enteropathy caused by a permanent gluten intolerance. In the last years, the diagnosis is becoming more and more frequent because of the recognition of 'new' symptoms and associated extraintestinal manifestations. Classical CD is dominated by symptoms and sequelae of gastrointestinal malabsorption. In the 'atypical forms', the extraintestinal features usually predominate, with few or no gastrointestinal symptoms. Silent CD refers to asymptomatic patients with a positive serologic test and villous atrophy on biopsy. This form is detected by screening of high-risk individuals, or villous atrophy occasionally may be detected by endoscopy and biopsy conducted for another reason. The potential form is diagnosed in groups at risk including relatives of celiac patients, Down syndrome and autoimmune diseases. Latent CD is defined by positive serological tests but not histological changes on biopsy. These individuals are asymptomatic, but later may develop symptoms and/or histological alterations. Recognition of atypical manifestations of CD is very important because many cases can remain undiagnosed with an increased risk of long-term complications.},

   abstract = {BACKGROUND AND AIMS: Celiac sprue is a multifactorial disease characterized by an inflammatory response to ingested gluten in the small intestine. Proteolytically resistant, proline- and glutamine-rich gluten peptides from wheat, rye, and barley persist in the intestinal lumen and elicit an immune response in genetically susceptible persons. We investigated a new combination enzyme product, consisting of a glutamine-specific endoprotease (EP-B2 from barley) and a prolyl endopeptidase (SC PEP from Sphingomonas capsulata), for its ability to digest gluten under gastric conditions. METHODS: The ability of this combination enzyme to digest and detoxify whole-wheat bread gluten was investigated. In vitro and in vivo (rat) experimental systems were developed to simulate human gastric digestion, and the resulting material was analyzed by high-performance liquid chromatography, enzyme-linked immunoabsorbent assay, and patient-derived T-cell proliferation assays. RESULTS: The analysis revealed that EP-B2 extensively proteolyzes complex gluten proteins in bread, whereas SC PEP rapidly detoxifies the residual oligopeptide products of EP-B2 digestion. In vitro dose variation data suggests that an approximate 1:1 weight ratio of the 2 enzymes should maximize their synergistic potential. The efficacy of this 2-enzyme glutenase was verified in a rat model of gastric gluten digestion. CONCLUSIONS: By combining 2 enzymes with gastric activity and complementary substrate specificity, it should be possible to increase the safe threshold of ingested gluten, thereby ameliorating the burden of a highly restricted diet for patients with celiac sprue.},

Common dietary proteins and 2 bacterial glutenases (proposed oral therapies for celiac sprue) were proteolyzed in the absence or presence of a 10 mmol/L conjugated bile acid mixture, simulating human bile composition. Lipolysis products (monoolein) and fatty acid were also evaluated to simulate postprandial intestinal contents. RESULTS: Conjugated bile acids dramatically enhanced the proteolysis of several dietary proteins, including beta-lactoglobulin, bovine serum albumin, myoglobin, and a commercially available dietary protein supplement. For beta-lactoglobulin, a cow's milk allergen that is resistant to pepsin cleavage, bile acids enhanced its proteolysis by pancreatic proteases even after incubation under gastric conditions. Exposure of prolyl endopeptidases to bile acids made them more susceptible to pancreatic proteases under simulated intestinal conditions. The conjugated bile acid effect was most pronounced in the presence of dihydroxy bile acids and was observable at bile concentrations below the critical micellar concentration but to a much greater extent at concentrations above the critical micellar concentration. CONCLUSIONS: We propose that, in addition to promoting lipid absorption, conjugated bile acids affect the digestion and assimilation of dietary proteins by accelerating hydrolysis by pancreatic proteases. These findings have implications for intraluminal protein breakdown and assimilation in the upper small intestine.},

   abstract = {BACKGROUND & AIMS: Celiac disease is characterized by activation of HLA-DQ2/DQ8-restricted intestinal gluten-specific CD4(+) T cells. In particular, gluten becomes a better T-cell antigen following deamidation catalyzed by tissue transglutaminase. To date, the only available therapy is represented by adherence to a gluten-free diet. Here, we examined a new enzyme strategy to preventively abolish gluten activity. METHODS: Enzyme modifications of the immunodominant alpha-gliadin peptide p56-68 were analyzed by mass spectrometry, and peptide binding to HLA-DQ2 was simulated by modeling studies. Wheat flour was treated with microbial transglutaminase and lysine methyl ester; gliadin was subsequently extracted, digested, and deamidated. Gliadin-specific intestinal T-cell lines (iTCLs) were generated from biopsy specimens from 12 adult patients with celiac disease and challenged in vitro with different antigen preparations. RESULTS: Tissue transglutaminase-mediated transamidation with lysine or lysine methyl ester of p56-68 or gliadin in alkaline conditions inhibited the interferon gamma expression in iTCLs; also, binding to DQ2 was reduced but not abolished, as suggested by in silico analysis. Lysine methyl ester was particularly effective in abrogating the activity of gliadin. Notably, a block in the response was observed when iTCLs were challenged with gliadin extracted from flour pretreated with microbial transglutaminase and lysine methyl ester. CONCLUSIONS: Transamidation of wheat flour with a food-grade enzyme and an appropriate amine donor can be used to block the T cell-mediated gliadin activity. Considering the crucial role of adaptive immunity in celiac disease, our findings highlight the potential of the proposed treatment to prevent cereal toxicity.},

   abstract = {Celiac disease is a systemic autoimmune disorder triggered by the ingestion of gluten found in wheat and related grains. Once considered rare, celiac disease is now thought to affect more than one in 100 individuals, and is commonly associated with other autoimmune disorders. It predisposes patients to an increased risk of malignancy if left untreated. Celiac disease is HLA restricted as only HLA-DQ2 and -DQ8 are able to bind deamidated gluten with sufficient affinity to trigger an immune response. Both cellular and humoral immune activation occur, leading to local tissue damage and antibody formation. These antibodies, primarily to tissue transglutaminase, are the basis for highly accurate serologic testing, although the gold standard for celiac disease diagnosis remains small intestinal biopsy. Currently, the only treatment for celiac disease is a life-long gluten-free diet, although multiple novel therapeutic modalities are being studied. Although most individuals with celiac disease respond completely to gluten withdrawal, 10-20% have persistent symptoms at some point during their course and less than 1% develop refractory celiac disease, an entity of substantial morbidity.},

   abstract = {OBJECTIVE: To evaluate the growth response to growth hormone (GH) replacement therapy during a gluten-free diet in patients with celiac disease (CD) associated with GH deficiency (GHD). PATIENTS AND METHODS: A total of 14 prepubertal children affected by CD and GHD with no catch-up growth after >/=12 months of gluten-free diet and a reversion to seronegativity for antiendomysium antibodies and 10 age-matched prepubertal children with idiopathic GHD (IGHD) entered the study. All of the patients were treated with the same GH dosage (0.25 mg/kg subcutaneously each week). Height, growth rate, and body mass index were measured at the time of diagnosis of CD, at the time of endocrinological evaluation, and after the first, second, and third year of GH replacement therapy. RESULTS: Growth rate strikingly increased (P < 0.005) during the first year of therapy in a similar way in subjects with CD/GHD and IGHD (from a median standard deviation score [SDS] of -2.34 to an SDS of 3.25 and from an SDS of -1.29 to an SDS of 2.79, respectively). During the second and third years of GH treatment, the growth rate tended to decrease but the values at the third year were always positive (CD/GHD, median SDS, 1.10; IGHD, median SDS, 0.11), indicating continued catch-up growth. CONCLUSIONS: In patients with CD with GH deficiency confirmed after >/=12 months of gluten-free diet, GH replacement therapy should be started to allow complete catch-up growth in children. In addition, the effect of GH treatment in patients who comply with a gluten-free diet seems to be comparable to that observed in children with IGHD.},

Here, we aimed to determine whether myriocin could inhibit the progression (or stimulate the regression) of established atherosclerotic lesions and to examine potential changes in hepatic and plasma lipid concentrations. Adult apoE(-/-) mice were fed a high-fat diet for 30 days, and lesion formation was histologically confirmed. Replicate groups of mice were then transferred to either regular chow or chow containing myriocin (0.3 mg/kg/day) and maintained for a further 60 days. Myriocin significantly inhibited the progression of established atherosclerosis when combined lesion areas (aortic sinus, arch, and celiac branch point) were measured. Although the inhibition of lesion progression was observed mainly in the distal regions of the aorta, regression of lesion size was not detected. The inhibition of lesion progression was associated with reductions in hepatic and plasma SM, cholesterol, and TG levels and increased hepatic and plasma apoA-I levels, indicating that the modulation of pathways associated with several classes of atherogenic lipids may be involved.},

Gluten-free products are not widely available and are usually more expensive than their gluten-containing counterparts. There is, therefore, an urgent need to develop safe and effective therapeutic alternatives, to develop high-quality gluten-free products and to investigate the potential of the bread making biotechnology following ancient protocols which include long-time fermentation by selected sourdough lactic acid bacteria. This review describes the most relevant results related to biotechnologies that use selected sourdough lactic acid bacteria and probiotics as starters for sourdough fermentation to investigate their potential to decrease the risk of gluten contamination in gluten-free products. As shown by studies in vitro on celiac intestinal tissue and in vivo on CD patients, the bacterial proteolytic activity is rather promising not only as currently demonstrated for eliminating traces of contaminant gluten but probably also in perspective for the manufacture of tolerated baked goods.},

   abstract = {BACKGROUND: Although the association between type 1 diabetes mellitus (T1DM) and coeliac disease is well known, the presenting features and clinical characteristics of the two diseases when they coexist are less well documented. METHODS: All patients with T1DM attending a paediatric diabetes clinic in London, UK, were screened for coeliac disease by serological testing for coeliac antibodies (antiendomysial and either/both tissue transglutaminase and antigliadin). Antibody positive patients were reviewed and their presenting symptoms, tissue biopsy result and coexisting morbidities investigated. Glycaemic control, growth and the effect of a gluten-free diet on these variables were also evaluated. RESULTS: Of the 113 patients with T1DM, 7 (6.2%) tested antibody positive. Jejunal biopsy confirmed coeliac disease in 5 of the 7 (4.4%) patients. Coeliac disease presented atypically or silently in the majority of cases with an unpredictable interval between diagnosis of diabetes and coeliac disease presentation. Coeliac disease did not appear to affect growth. Mean glycated haemoglobin (HbA1c) levels were not significantly raised in subjects (9.87%) compared with matched controls without coeliac disease (9.08%) (p = 0.249). Analyses of the effect of a gluten-free diet on growth and HbA1c were limited. Of the seven subjects, two suffered other autoimmune diseases. CONCLUSION: Coeliac disease presents atypically and unexpectedly in children and adolescents with T1DM. This, along with the strong association between the two diseases, supports the regular screening of coeliac disease among these patients. The value of a gluten-free diet cannot be commented on from this study alone although other studies show it reduces the risk of complications.},

Primary causes of lactose malabsorption due to loss of intestinal lactase activity include genetic/racial lactase nonpersistence, congenital lactase deficiency, and developmental lactase deficiency. Secondary lactose malabsorption can be caused by any disorder that injures the small intestinal mucosa, such as viral gastroenteritis, celiac disease, allergic (eosinophilic) gastroenteritis, and radiation enteritis. The diagnosis depends on careful clinical evaluation and is customarily confirmed with a lactose breath hydrogen test. As the symptoms are nonspecific, many adults diagnosed with lactose malabsorption actually have irritable bowel syndrome. Treatment consists of a trial of eliminating lactose-containing dairy foods, with supplementation of alternative calcium and protein sources. Commercial enzyme products containing beta-galactosidases can be prescribed to help patients digest dietary lactose. Long-term lactose restriction usually is not necessary and can lead to reduced bone mineral density.},

FINDINGS/CONCLUSIONS: Celiac disease is a genetic autoimmune disease affecting up to 1% of the population. The majority of people with celiac disease do not know they have it. With new diagnostic tests available on the marketplace, increasing numbers of people are being diagnosed with celiac disease. Case managers are likely to encounter patients with celiac disease as either a primary or secondary diagnosis. Celiac disease may cause gastrointestinal symptoms such as gas, diarrhea, or bloating, and is also associated with osteoporosis, other autoimmune disorders, and certain types of cancer. For children, it is a common disorder underlying growth delays. Celiac disease is present in 3%-8% of persons with diabetes and may affect glycemic control in these patients. The only known treatment of celiac disease is a lifelong gluten-free diet. The increased number of individuals diagnosed with celiac disease has led to an increase in products available, as well as in research on treatment alternatives. IMPLICATIONS FOR CASE MANAGEMENT PRACTICE: People with celiac disease report challenges in adhering to the gluten-free diet. Case managers can assist patients in accessing appropriate therapy, including nutrition counseling and monitoring services. They may also advocate for testing of patients in high-risk groups such as persons with diabetes, and those with unexplained gastrointestinal symptoms. In working with celiac patients, case managers should address psychosocial issues as well as knowledge deficits. Patients may need particular support integrating the gluten-free diet with other requirements, including heart healthy or diabetic diets. Case managers can help patients identify reliable sources of information and products. Case managers still have a role to play in educating patients and supporting adherence with this lifelong dietary regimen.},

   abstract = {Coeliac disease is a chronic immune-mediated disorder that primarily affects the gastrointestinal tract. There is an inflammatory response in the intestine to the ingestion of gluten which improves with a gluten-free diet. Many patients, especially adults, may be asymptomatic or have only extraintestinal symptoms at onset without any of the classical coeliac symptoms. In the last two decades there have been increasing numbers of reports describing neurological complications of coeliac disease, especially ataxia, peripheral neuropathy and epilepsy. This literature has become quite controversial, with disputes over the definition of coeliac disease and gluten sensitivity, whether neurological complications are caused by coeliac disease or are epiphenomena, and whether the proposed complications respond to a gluten-free diet. This review uses an evidence-based approach to critically assess this literature and provides guidelines for the evaluation and management of these patients.},

   abstract = {In most developed countries, gluten is currently most commonly introduced between 4 and 6 months of age, in spite of little evidence to support this practice. As for infants at risk of developing food allergies, there is clear evidence that introducing solid foods before the end of the 3rd month is detrimental and should be avoided. A recent growing body of evidence however challenges the notion that solids (and among them, gluten-containing foods) should be introduced beyond the 6th month of life. Another important aspect of gluten introduction into the diet has to do with its possible role in causing type-1 diabetes (IDDM). Recently, a large epidemiological investigation in a cohort of children at risk for IDDM found that exposure to cereals (rice, wheat, oats, barley, rye) that occurred early (< or = 3 months) as well as late (> or = 7 months) resulted in a significantly higher risk of the appearance of islet cell autoimmunity compared to the introduction between 4 and 6 months. As for celiac disease, the protective role of breastfeeding can be considered ascertained, especially the protection offered by having gluten introduced while breastfeeding is continued. Evidence is emerging that early (< or = 3 months) and perhaps even late (7 months or after) first exposure to gluten may favor the onset of celiac disease in predisposed individuals. Additionally, large amounts of gluten at weaning are associated with an increased risk of developing celiac disease, as documented in studies from Scandinavian countries. In celiac children observed in our center, we could show that breastfeeding at the time of gluten introduction delays the appearance of celiac disease and makes it less likely that its presentation is predominantly gastrointestinal. Based on current evidence, it appears reasonable to recommend that gluten be introduced in small amounts in the diet between 4 and 6 months, while the infant is breastfed, and that breastfeeding is continued for at least a further 2-3 months.},

   abstract = {PURPOSE OF REVIEW: Research in celiac disease is unraveling new findings at a high rate, and major advances seem to occur in all areas such as genetics, environmental factor, pathophysiology, and even prospective therapeutic implications. RECENT FINDINGS: New insight is being gained into the interplay between genetic and environmental factors causing celiac disease. In addition to the known human leukocyte antigen haplotypes, genome-wide studies have now identified additional susceptibility loci and the majority of newly discovered risk regions harbor genes controlling immune pathways. The mechanism of translocation of gliadin peptides across the intestinal barrier has been the subject of much investigation, and there is now evidence that the toxic 33-mer peptide can also be translocated transcellularly. As for the paracellular route, this appears to be enhanced by gliadin's stimulation of zonulin release. The growing role of the innate immunity is being recognized and the increased expression of some Toll-like receptors appears to delineate a new inherent defect in this branch of innate immunity. Finally, new perspectives are opening in the treatment of celiac disease based on new detoxified grains, enzymatic degradation of gluten, and prevention of its crossing the mucosal barrier. SUMMARY: The pace of new knowledge in this 'ancient' disease is very fast, and this review outlines the principal lines of such exciting developments.},

   abstract = {BACKGROUND Several studies have suggested a link between coeliac disease and other autoimmune diseases. AIM To compare the presence of autoimmune disease in children with coeliac disease and in controls. METHODS When coeliac disease was diagnosed, 267 children were evaluated for clinical autoimmune disease (with signs/symptoms), subclinical autoimmune disease (with autoantibodies and subclinical impairment of the target organ) or potential autoimmune disease (with autoantibodies only) and compared with 220 healthy controls. 170 coeliac disease patients were followed up for a mean 47 +/- 31 months, in complete remission on a gluten-free diet. Ninety-nine controls were followed up for 45 +/- 33 months. RESULTS When coeliac disease was diagnosed, 71 (27%) children had autoimmune disease vs. 1% among the controls (P < 0.001): 31 had clinical autoimmune disease and 40 had subclinical or potential autoimmune disease. During the follow-up, the clinical autoimmune disease cases slightly decreased from 12% to 11%, while the potential autoimmune disease cases increased from 14% to 21%. Of the 99 controls, none had any variation in their autoantibody profile. CONCLUSIONS Gluten-free diet does not modify the natural history of autoimmunity in patients with coeliac disease. However, gluten-free diet seems to produce a favourable effect on the previously present clinical autoimmune disease and to prevent the development of new clinical autoimmune disease, but does not affect the onset of potential autoimmunity, which tends to increase with time.},

   abstract = {OBJECTIVE: Coeliac disease is effectively treated with a gluten-free diet devoid of wheat, rye, barley and related cereals. Oats has until recently also been considered harmful but is now allowed in several countries. We have, however, identified three adult coeliac disease patients who developed a flare of active coeliac disease after ingestion of oats, which suggests that oats might not be entirely innocent in coeliac disease. It is known that patients with untreated coeliac disease have elevated IgA antibodies to oat prolamins. The objective of this study was to investigate whether levels of IgA against oats were increased in treated, adult coeliac disease patients. MATERIAL AND METHODS: Serum was collected from 136 adult patients with treated coeliac disease and 139 controls. Eighty-two of the coeliac disease patients had been taking oats as part of their gluten-free diet for 6 months or more. IgA against oats avenin, wheat gliadin and tissue transglutaminase was tested with ELISA. RESULTS: No significant differences were found in IgA against oats in oats-eating and non-oats-eating coeliac disease patients. Both groups had increased levels of IgA against wheat, oats and tissue transglutaminase compared to healthy controls. A significant positive correlation was found between anti-avenin and antigliadin IgA (p<0.0001), and between anti-avenin and anti-tissue transglutaminase IgA (p=0.0012). CONCLUSIONS: Ingestion of oats does not cause increased levels of IgA against oats in adult coeliac disease patients on a gluten-free diet. The findings support the notion that most adult coeliac disease patients can tolerate oats.},

   abstract = {BACKGROUND: Estimates of the diagnostic performance of serologic testing and HLA-DQ typing for detecting celiac disease have mainly come from case-control studies. OBJECTIVE: To define the performance of serologic testing and HLA-DQ typing prospectively. DESIGN: Prospective cohort study. SETTING: University hospital. PATIENTS: Patients referred for small-bowel biopsy for the diagnosis of celiac disease. INTERVENTIONS: Celiac serologic testing (antigliadin antibodies [AGA], antitransglutaminase antibodies [TGA], and antiendomysium antibodies [EMA]) and HLA-DQ typing. MEASUREMENTS: Diagnostic performance of serologic testing and HLA-DQ typing compared with a reference standard of abnormal histologic findings and clinical resolution after a gluten-free diet. RESULTS: Sixteen of 463 participants had celiac disease (prevalence, 3.46% [95% CI, 1.99% to 5.55%]). A positive result on both TGA and EMA testing had a sensitivity of 81% (CI, 54% to 95.9%), specificity of 99.3% (CI, 98.0% to 99.9%), and negative predictive value of 99.3% (CI, 98.0% to 99.9%). Testing positive for either HLA-DQ type maximized sensitivity (100% [CI, 79% to 100%]) and negative predictive value (100% [CI, 98.6% to 100%]), whereas testing negative for both minimized the negative likelihood ratio (0.00 [CI, 0.00 to 0.40]) and posttest probability (0% [CI, 0% to 1.4%]). The addition of HLA-DQ typing to TGA and EMA testing, and the addition of serologic testing to HLA-DQ typing, did not change test performance compared with either testing strategy alone. LIMITATION: Few cases of celiac disease precluded meaningful comparisons of testing strategies. CONCLUSIONS: In a patient population referred for symptoms and signs of celiac disease with a prevalence of celiac disease of 3.46%, TGA and EMA testing were the most sensitive serum antibody tests and a negative HLA-DQ type excluded the diagnosis. However, the addition of HLA-DQ typing to TGA and EMA testing, and the addition of serologic testing to HLA-DQ typing, provided the same measures of test performance as either testing strategy alone.},

Myopathy is a less common and poorly characterized additional neurological manifestation of gluten sensitivity.

Three of these patients had a neuropathy with or without ataxia in addition to the myopathy. The mean age at onset of the myopathic symptoms was 54 years. Ten patients had neurophysiological evidence of myopathy. Inflammatory myopathy was the most common finding on neuropathological examination. One patient had basophilic rimmed vacuoles suggestive of inclusion-body myositis. Six patients received immunosuppressive treatment in addition to starting on a gluten-free diet; five improved and one remained unchanged. Among seven patients not on immunosuppressive treatment, four showed clinical improvement of the myopathy with a gluten-free diet. The improvement was also associated with reduction or normalization of serum creatine kinase level. The myopathy progressed in one patient who refused the gluten-free diet. Myopathy may be another manifestation of gluten sensitivity and is likely to have an immune-mediated pathogenesis. A gluten-free diet may be a useful therapeutic intervention.},

Localization and the amount of gliadin, Fas-L, as well as the incidence of apoptosis in 32-term placentas, was analyzed immunohistochemically and with in situ hybridization in a blinded fashion; these were correlated with the weight of their newborns. Extravillous trophoblasts (EVTs) from the noncompliant women were overloaded with gliadin; there was a moderate amount or no gliadin present in the controls. The weight of newborns was lower if extravillous trophoblasts were loaded with gliadin (-2.24SD) (p = 0.004). Increased apoptosis of EVT in placentas of noncompliant women was consistent with abundant expression of Fas-L in those cells and was linked to the low birth weight of newborns. Exposure to gliadin alters extravillous trophoblast dynamics by causing an increase in apoptotic shedding. In genetically predisposed individuals, gliadin affects fetal part of the placenta causing children to be small for their age. A gluten-free diet during pregnancy prevents SGA children and, thus, the fetal origin of serious adult diseases.},

   abstract = {BACKGROUND: While gluten-free diet is an effective treatment for coeliac disease, the need for and goals of long-term management of patients are poorly defined. AIM: To review systematically the complications and associations of coeliac disease, to identify potential risk factors, to define ways of assessing risk factors and to provide a strategy for management. METHODS: Review of medical literature from 1975. RESULTS: There is an increasing list of potential complications and/or conditions associated with coeliac disease, in particular, autoimmune disease, malignancy and bone disease. Risk factors that may predict or influence long-term outcomes include genetic susceptibility, environmental factors predominantly gluten ingestion, persistent small intestinal inflammation/injury and nutritional deficiencies. Genotyping of patients is yet to have an established clinical role in long-term management. Assessment of adherence to the gluten-free diet largely relies upon skilled dietary history, but the ultimate test is duodenal histopathology, which is the only currently established means of assessing healing. Symptoms, serology or other non-invasive means are poor predictors of healing and the likelihood of complications.

   abstract = {Celiac disease is a common systemic disorder that can have multiple hematologic manifestations. Patients with celiac disease may present to hematologists for evaluation of various hematologic problems prior to receiving a diagnosis of celiac disease. Anemia secondary to malabsorption of iron, folic acid, and/or vitamin B12 is a common complication of celiac disease and many patients have anemia at the time of diagnosis. Celiac disease may also be associated with thrombocytosis, thrombocytopenia, leukopenia, venous thromboembolism, hyposplenism, and IgA deficiency. Patients with celiac disease are at increased risk of being diagnosed with lymphoma, especially of the T-cell type. The risk is highest for enteropathy-type T-cell lymphoma (ETL) and B-cell lymphoma of the gut, but extraintestinal lymphomas can also be seen. ETL is an aggressive disease with poor prognosis, but strict adherence to a gluten-free diet may prevent its occurrence.},

   abstract = {Patients with dermatitis herpetiformis (DH) have a gluten-sensitive enteropathy and while on gluten-containing diets have elevated levels of serum IL-8. We hypothesized that the mucosal immune response to gluten is responsible for the elevated serum IL-8. Six DH patients were studied while on a gluten-free diet (GFD), whereas four continued on a normal diet. Patients were followed for a mean 2.2 years and serum IL-8 was analyzed. Small bowel biopsies from five DH patients on normal diets, two DH patients on GFD, and six subjects with no small bowel abnormalities were analyzed for IL-8 mRNA. Serum IL-8 levels normalized in five of six patients on GFD and decreased in one, whereas serum IL-8 levels showed no statistically significant change in DH patients on normal diets. Small bowel biopsies from DH patients on normal diets had increased expression of IL-8 mRNA compared to normal subjects, whereas patients on a GFD showed no significant increase in small bowel mRNA. No significant IL-8 mRNA was detected in normal skin biopsies from patients with DH. These observations suggest that the IL-8 in the serum of patients with DH originates from the small bowel as a mucosal immune response to gluten ingestion.},

   abstract = {BACKGROUND: Patients with coeliac disease living on a gluten-free diet show vitamin deficiency and reduced subjective health status. AIM: To study the biochemical and clinical effects of B vitamin supplementation in adults with longstanding coeliac disease. METHODS: In a double blind placebo controlled multicentre trial, 65 coeliac patients (61% women) aged 45-64 years on a strict gluten-free diet for several years were randomized to a daily dose of 0.8 mg folic acid,0.5 mg cyanocobalamin and 3 mg pyridoxine or placebo for 6 months. The outcome measures were psychological general well-being (PGWB) and the plasma total homocysteine (tHcy) level, marker of B vitamin status. RESULTS: Fifty-seven patients (88%) completed the trial. The tHcy level was baseline median 11.7 micromol/L (7.4-23.0), significantly higher than in matched population controls [10.2 micromol/L (6.7-22.6) (P < 0.01)]. Following vitamin supplementation, tHcy dropped a median of 34% (P < 0.001), accompanied by significant improvement in well-being (P < 0.01), notably Anxiety (P < 0.05) and Depressed Mood (P < 0.05) for patients with poor well-being. CONCLUSIONS: Adults with longstanding coeliac disease taking extra B vitamins for 6 months showed normalized tHcy and significant improvement in general well-being, suggesting that B vitamins should be considered in people advised to follow a gluten-free diet.},

Immunological origin of IPH is now well accepted. We report the case of an 11-year-old female admitted for evaluation of recurrent streaky haemoptysis that had been evolving over the previous 9 months. Physical examination revealed weight loss with normal weight, but there was cutaneous and mucosal pallor due to severe anaemia (haemoglobin 4.6g/dl). The chest X-rays showed unilateral alveolo-intertitial infiltrate. Broncho-alveolar lavage revealed 70% haemosiderin-laden macrophages. The diagnosis of IPH was made. Since severe anaemia is disproportionate to radiologic findings, searching associated CD was performed and then confirmed by biological and histological examinations. A gluten-free diet was initiated. Evolution was favourable. Looking for especially CD in IPH should be systematic, even in the absence of gastrointestinal symptoms.},

The etiology of protein losing enteropathy is various. Increased mucosal permeability to protein as a result of cell damage, mucosal erosion, or lymphatic obstruction may develop protein losing enteropathy. Celiac disease is a common cause of protein losing enteropathy associated with small bowel villous atrophy in Europe. We experienced a case of protein losing enteropathy associated with small bowel villous atrophy of unknown origin. A 36-year-old woman was admitted due to chronic watery diarrhea and weight loss. Laboratory findings showed total protein 4.7 g/dL, albumin 2.7 g/dL, cholesterol 100 mg/dL, WBC 6,000/mm3 (lymphocyte 13.6%) with the absence of proteinuria. On esophagogastroduodenoscopic examination, duodenal ulcer scar was noted on the bulb and colonoscopic finding was nonspecific. On small bowel enteroscopy, jejunal and ileal villi was scantly noticed. Small bowel biopsy showed marked villous atrophy. Her symptoms did not improve after supportive care. Gluten free diet was tried because celiac disease could not be ruled out completely. Diarrhea ceased and body weight regained after gluten free diet.},

We collected hematologic parameters from a cohort of patients seen at a tertiary care center for CD to assess the characteristics of anemia in this population. Hematological parameters measured <or=3 months of diagnosis and degree of villous atrophy from 405 patients diagnosed >1995 was analyzed. Ferritin levels were compared with population controls (NHANES III). Iron deficiency was common, occurring in 33% of men and 19% of women (P < 0.001). Folate deficiency was seen in approximately 12% of the total sample and B12 deficiency in approximately 5%. Anemia was present in approximately 20% of the cohort. Among the anemic patients, ferritin was less than the 10th percentile in 45%, between the 10th and 50th percentile in 39% and greater than the 50th percentile in 13%. Ferritin > 50th percentile was more common in anemic men (24%) than in anemic women (9%; P > 0.20). Macrocytic anemia with concurrent B12 or folate deficiency was rare (3%). Elevated ESR was observed in patients with ferritin < 10th percentile and >50th. A gluten-free diet resulted in increased serum ferritin in iron-deficient patients, and decreased ferritin levels in those with high ferritin (r(2) = 0.46, P < 0.001). Although anemia is still a common presentation of celiac disease, nutritional deficiencies alone do not explain this phenomenon in all cases; inflammation appears to contribute as evidenced by the presence of anemia of chronic disease in some individuals.},

Currently, celiac disease (CD) is the only autoimmune disease in which both the major genetic (95% HLA-DQ2(+)) and etiologic factors (dietary glutens) for susceptibility are known. We demonstrate that wheat gliadin induces significantly greater production of IL-23, IL-1beta, and TNF-alpha in PBMC from CD patients compared with HLA-DQ2(+) healthy controls, strongly advocating a role for IL-23 in the pathogenesis of CD. Moreover, IL-1beta alone triggered IL-23 secretion and the IL-1R antagonist inhibited this response in PBMC and purified monocytes. This sequence of events was replicated by beta-glucan, another substance known to induce IL-23 production. Our results suggest that gliadin and beta-glucan stimulate IL-23 secretion through induction of the IL-1 signaling pathway and reveal for the first time that the IL-1 system regulates IL-23 production. These findings may provide therapeutic targets for this disease and other inflammatory conditions mediated by IL-23.},

Of these 96 patients, 76 (79.2%) sought help (medical and/or nonmedical) due to bowel symptoms (referred to as patients with IBS). IBS-type symptoms had a significant negative impact on the physical summary score of the SF-36 (p = .05). Mental disorder (OR = 2.29; beta = 0.83; p = .006); female sex (OR = 2.34; beta = 0.85; p = .03), and occasional nonadherence to GFD (OR = 1.74; beta = 0.56; p = .05) were risk factors for IBS-type symptoms. Active medical comorbidities predicted IBS-patient status (OR = 0.40; beta = -0.92; p = .001). CONCLUSIONS: The data support the biopsychosocial model of IBS: IBS-type symptoms in adult patients with CD can be explained through an interaction of clinical and sociopsychological mechanisms.},

   abstract = {BACKGROUND: Data available on predictors of reduced health-related quality of life in coeliac disease are not consistent. AIM: To test predictors of reduced health-related quality of life, described in the literature, by a multivariate approach. METHODS: 1000 adult coeliacs of the German Coeliac Society completed a medical and a sociodemographic questionnaire, the Short-Form Health Survey (SF-36), the Coeliac Disease Questionnaire and the Hospital Anxiety and Depression Scale within a postal survey. Predictors of reduced health-related quality of life were tested for by logistic regression analysis. RESULTS: Physical comorbidities (beta = -0.41; OR = 0.66, P < 0.001) and mental disorder (beta = 0.88; OR = 2.4, P = 0.03) were associated with a reduced physical summary score of the SF-36. Mental disorder (beta = 2.5; OR = 11.9, P < 0.001), physical comorbidities (beta = -0.26; OR = 0.77, P = 0.004) and younger age at diagnosis (beta = -0.10; OR = 0.91, P = 0.05) predicted a reduced mental summary score of the SF-36. Mental disorder (beta = 0.90; OR = 2.5, P = 0.03), non-compliance with gluten-free diet (beta = 0.44; OR = 1.6, P = 0.009), active medical comorbidities (beta = -0.28; OR = 0.76, P = 0.007) and dissatisfaction with doctor-patient communication (beta = 0.55; OR = 1.7, P = 0.03) were associated with reduced Coeliac Disease Questionnaire scores. CONCLUSIONS: Reduced health-related quality of life in coeliac disease is associated not only with physical and mental comorbidities, but also with non-compliance with gluten-free diet and dissatisfaction with doctor-patient communication.},

   abstract = {OBJECTIVE: To investigate the effect of chronic enhanced external counterpulastion (EECP) on gene expression profiles of arterial endothelial cells (ECs) of pigs fed with high-cholesterol diet. METHODS: Eight male pigs were fed with high-cholesterol diet for 12 weeks to induce arteriosclerosis and subjected to EECP for accumulative 36 h (2 h every other day for 18 sessions). Another 8 pigs on cholesterol-enriched diet and 6 normally fed pigs served as the arteriosclerosis model group and normal control group, respectively, and the high-cholesterol diet was maintained until the end of EECP treatment. The coronary artery was then isolated for transmission electro microscopy, and the abdominal aorta was observed using Sudan III staining. The gene expression profiles in ECs from the thoracic aorta using cDNA microarrays. RESULTS: Macrophages and foam cells were detected beneath the ECs in the coronary artery of pigs in the model group, but not in the other two groups. The ratios of Sudan III-positive area in the celiac aorta were significantly lower in normal control and EECP groups than in the model control group (P<0.05). Compared with the normal control group, the gene expressions of integrins-beta1 and CTGF were up-regulated in the model group. Compared with the model group, the expressions of integrins-beta1, CTGF and VCAM-1 were down-regulated and eNOS up-regulated in EECP group. CONCLUSION: Chronic EECP may reduce endothelial injury, down-regulate the gene expression level of integrin-beta1, CTGF and VCAM-1, lower cholesterol uptake and attenuate arterial endothelial inflammation to protect the pigs fed with high-cholesterol diet from arteriosclerosis.},

The true prevalence of this condition is much greater than previously recognized, with more silent cases being diagnosed and a greater proportion of cases diagnosed later in adulthood. It presents with a spectrum of clinical manifestations and histological abnormalities. Duodenal biopsy remains the gold standard for diagnosis of celiac disease, even though there are new serologic tests that are very specific. Correlation of clinical, serologic, and histological features are essential for a definitive diagnosis of celiac disease. The pathogenesis consists in an interaction between genetic, immunologic and environmental factors, which interact with HLA molecules to activate an immunologic response in the small bowel mucosa causing tissue damage. The main treatment is a free gluten diet. Health risks for untreated celiac disease appear to be greater compared with those patients who adhere to this treatment.},

   abstract = {Current nutrition recommendations, directed towards populations, are based on estimated average nutrient requirements for a target population and intend to meet the needs of most individuals within that population. They also aim at preventing common diseases such as obesity, diabetes and cardiovascular disease. For infants with specific genetic polymorphisms, e.g. some inborn errors of metabolism, adherence to current recommendations will cause disease symptoms and they need personalized nutrition recommendations. Some other monogenic polymorphisms, e.g. adult hypolactasia, are common but with varying prevalence between ethnic groups and within populations. Ages at onset as well as the degree of the resulting lactose intolerance also vary, making population-based as well as personalized recommendations difficult. The tolerable intake is best set by each individual based on symptoms. For polygenetic diseases such as celiac disease, type-1 diabetes and allergic disease, current knowledge is insufficient to suggest personalized recommendations aiming at primary prevention for all high-risk infants, although it may be justified to provide such recommendations on an individual level should the parents ask for them. New technologies such as nutrigenetics and nutrigenomics are promising tools with which current nutrition recommendations can possibly be refined and the potential of individualized nutrition be explored. It seems likely that in the future it will be possible to offer more subgroups within a population personalized recommendations.},

   abstract = {UNLABELLED: In coeliac disease (CD) there is a gluten-induced small bowel enteropathy leading to malabsorption of various nutrients, vitamins and trace elements. Low levels of serum zinc have been reported in adults with untreated CD. In the present study we related the serum concentration of zinc to the morphology of the small bowel mucosa in 58 children, all under 4 years of age and under investigation for coeliac disease. The mean serum concentration of zinc (mean +/- SD; mumol/L) was significantly lower in children with untreated CD (9.7 +/- 2.0) (n = 11) compared to non-coeliac children without enteropathy (15.1 +/- 2.3) (n = 16) (p < 0.001), coeliac children on a gluten-free diet without enteropathy (14.2 +/- 1.6) (n = 14) (p < 0.001), coeliac children on gluten challenge with enteropathy (14.1 +/- 2.1) (n = 12) (p < 0.001) and coeliac children on gluten challenge without enteropathy (13.8 +/- 1.9) (n = 6) (p < 0.005). CONCLUSION: Serum zinc concentration is decreased in untreated coeliac children with enteropathy and normalizes on gluten-free diet. A low serum zinc value in a child being investigated for possible CD on clinical grounds can thus be used as a complementary marker for enteropathy indicating further investigation with small bowel biopsy. The hypothetical role of zinc in the pathogenesis of CD is discussed.},

   abstract = {BACKGROUND: Intestinal malabsorption in the elderly is infrequent, and clinical features are muted so that the diagnosis is often missed. Physiologic changes with aging are restricted to altered absorption of calcium and perhaps zinc and magnesium; however, achlorhydria can lead to impaired absorption of vitamin B(12), folic acid, and calcium. METHODS AND RESULTS: Small bowel bacterial overgrowth occurs more commonly in elderly than in younger patients, accompanying gastric hypochlorhydria, altered intestinal motor activity, or diseases such as Parkinson's disease. Changes in pancreatic anatomy and secretion occur but are insufficient to produce macronutrient malabsorption. In addition to pancreatic cancer and pancreatic stones, older patients may present with severe pancreatic insufficiency of unknown etiology. Celiac disease is recognized as very common at all ages and may not become evident until late in life. Manifestations of celiac disease in the elderly are occult and the diagnosis often is not considered until serologic tests are performed and confirmed by upper small intestinal biopsy. Associated intestinal lymphoma, esophageal carcinoma, intestinal pseudo-obstruction, and splenic atrophy may be more common in the elderly. Treatment of older patients with celiac disease with a gluten-free diet may be difficult, and intensive vitamin and micronutrient replacement is mandatory. A pragmatic approach to the evaluation of malabsorption in elderly patients is discussed.},

   abstract = {OBJECTIVE: To review and critically evaluate the extant research pertaining to adherence in pediatric gastroenterological diseases, particularly inflammatory bowel disease and celiac disease, and to provide recommendations for future research development. MATERIALS AND METHODS: A literature search with no date restriction was conducted using PubMed and PsychInfo electronic databases and bibliographies of relevant articles. RESULTS: Adherence rates in inflammatory bowel disease and celiac disease range considerably from 16% to 62% and 5% to 70%, respectively, across treatments and assessment method; nonadherence frequency was generally not reported. Measures used to assess adherence included self-report, interview, diet record, and bioassay methods, and each measure demonstrated strengths and limitations. Limited evidence suggests that adherence in both disease populations is related to patient and family behavioral factors and that nonadherence is related to poor disease outcome. Treatment outcome research for nonadherence is scant in the current literature. CONCLUSIONS: Future research should focus on refining assessment method, examining adherence and concomitant behavioral factors longitudinally, testing theoretical models of adherence, and developing efficacious treatments for nonadherence.},

   abstract = {OBJECTIVE: Celiac disease (CD) is a multifactorial disease with a strong genetic association. It is caused by a T-cell-mediated immune response to wheat gluten. The treatment is a strict gluten-free diet (GFD). The purpose of this study was to investigate whether the naturally gluten-free cereal Eragrostis tef (tef) is associated with health problems when used by CD patients. MATERIAL AND METHODS: In March 2006, all 7990 members of the Dutch Celiac Disease Society were invited to complete a questionnaire on tef use and the development of symptoms after tef consumption. Respondents and their family members willing to participate were sent an extended questionnaire on the use of commercially available tef products and on the character of their subsequent symptoms. RESULTS: Thirty-six percent responded to the first questionnaire of whom 53% consumed tef and 15% reported complaints. For the second questionnaire, out of the 1828 participants willing to complete it, 1545 had biopsy-proven CD (median duration GFD: 6.5 years (range: 0-66.5 years)). Of these, 66% used tef (median duration 1.4 years (range: 0.1-5 years)) and 17% reported symptoms after consumption. The percentage for symptoms was significantly lower than that in patients without tef consumption reporting on their regular GFD (17% versus 61%; p = 0.0001). CONCLUSIONS: Tef is frequently used by Dutch CD patients and a wide majority can consume tef without experiencing any clinical symptoms. CD patients using tef reported a significant reduction in symptoms, possibly related to a reduction in gluten intake or to an increase in fiber intake. Hence, tef can be a valuable addition to the GFD of CD patients.},

   abstract = {BACKGROUND: In light of the possibly preventive role of timing and amount of gluten in celiac disease, it would be helpful to have a questionnaire to assess the gluten intake in infants. AIMS: Development and validation of a food questionnaire to assess gluten consumption in healthy infants aged 0-12 months (FQ-gluten). METHODS: A food frequency questionnaire, previously developed for the Generation R study, was adapted for the assessment of gluten intake. The results of a 2-day food record (FR) were compared with the results of this FQ-gluten. RESULTS: Eighty-seven parents filled in the FR and the FQ-gluten. The number of children who consume gluten and who are breast-fed is higher, reported in the FQ-gluten. The amount of gluten is comparable from the age of 3 up to 10 months, but at 11 and 12 months a higher gluten intake is reported using the FR, probably due to a larger variety of food products not detectable by the FQ-gluten. However, there is a high agreement in the food groups (Cohens' kappa=0.6-0.8). CONCLUSIONS: This new, short, standardized, validated and easy to use FQ-gluten may be a useful instrument to assess gluten intake in infants, both at the individual and at the population level. The use of this method by investigators in other countries provides the opportunity for a better comparison of the results of gluten consumption in (co-operative) studies throughout different countries.},

   abstract = {BACKGROUND AND OBJECTIVE: Celiac disease (CD) is believed to be a permanent intolerance to gluten. A number of patients, however, discontinue the gluten-free diet (GFD) without developing symptoms or signs. The aim of our study was to investigate whether CD patients are capable of developing tolerance to gluten. METHODS: All 77 adult patients from our hospital known to have biopsy-proven CD for more than 10 years were invited to participate. We investigated symptoms, gluten consumption, antibodies for CD and other autoimmunity, human leukocyte antigen (HLA)-typing, bone mineral density, and performed small bowel biopsies. Tolerance was defined as no immunological or histological signs of CD while consuming gluten. RESULTS: Sixty-six patients accepted participation, but after review of the diagnostic biopsies 53 were found to have true CD. Twenty-three percent of patients had a gluten-containing diet, 15% admitted gluten transgression and 62% followed the GFD. Patients on a GFD had significantly more osteoporosis. Normal small bowel mucosa was found in four of eight on gluten-containing diet and in four of four with gluten transgression. Two patients were considered to have developed tolerance to gluten. One of them was HLA-DQ2/DQ8 negative. CONCLUSION: Development of tolerance to gluten seems possible in some patients with CD. Further follow-up will show whether this tolerance is permanent or only a long-term return to latency. This feature may be associated with genetic characteristics, especially with HLA genotypes that differ from DQ2 or DQ8. More insight into the mechanisms of the development of gluten tolerance may help to distinguish those CD patients that might not require life-long GFD.},

   abstract = {BACKGROUND & AIMS: The optimal serologic tests for the detection of celiac disease and follow-up assessment remains controversial. Our aim was to evaluate all current immunologic assays for diagnosing celiac disease using the gold standard of duodenal biopsy. We also assessed whether tissue transglutaminase (tTG) antibody is a quantitative marker for histologic severity. METHODS: Consecutive adult patients referred for gastroscopy without a previous known diagnosis of celiac disease were recruited (group 1). Concurrently, patients with a known diagnosis of celiac disease on a gluten-free diet for more than 1 year undergoing repeat duodenal biopsy were identified (group 2). All patients had duodenal biopsies and serologic analysis performed for immunoglobulin(Ig) A and antibodies to human immunoglobulin (Ig)A-tTG, IgA-gliadin, IgG-gliadin, and IgA-endomysial antibody. RESULTS: Two thousand patients were recruited in the first group. Seventy-seven (3.9%) patients were diagnosed with new celiac disease. The sensitivity, specificity, positive predictive value, and negative predictive value for IgA tTG were 90.9%, 90.9%, 28.6%, and 99.6%. When adopting a 2-step approach using tTG first and then EMA the sensitivity, specificity, positive predictive value, and negative predictive value was 85.7%, 98.6%, 71.7%, and 99.7%, respectively. The use of nondeamidated IgA/IgG gliadin antibodies conferred no additional diagnostic benefit when considering the detection of adult celiac disease. In the second group 48 patients with celiac disease on a gluten-free diet were identified. Sixteen of 48 of these patients had persisting villous atrophy, but 7 of 16 (44%) had a normal tTG level. CONCLUSIONS: IgA tTG alone is a sensitive marker for celiac disease. A normal tTG level does not predict recovery of villous atrophy in patients with celiac disease on a gluten-free diet.},

   abstract = {Major histocompatibility complex (MHC) class II alleles HLA-DQ8 and the mouse homologue I-A(g7) lacking a canonical aspartic acid residue at position beta57 are associated with coeliac disease and type I diabetes. However, the role of this single polymorphism in disease initiation and progression remains poorly understood. The lack of Asp 57 creates a positively charged P9 pocket, which confers a preference for negatively charged peptides. Gluten lacks such peptides, but tissue transglutaminase (TG2) introduces negatively charged residues at defined positions into gluten T-cell epitopes by deamidating specific glutamine residues on the basis of their spacing to proline residues. The commonly accepted model, proposing that HLA-DQ8 simply favours binding of negatively charged peptides, does not take into account the fact that TG2 requires inflammation for activation and that T-cell responses against native gluten peptides are found, particularly in children. Here we show that beta57 polymorphism promotes the recruitment of T-cell receptors bearing a negative signature charge in the complementary determining region 3beta (CDR3beta) during the response against native gluten peptides presented by HLA-DQ8 in coeliac disease. These T cells showed a crossreactive and heteroclitic (stronger) response to deamidated gluten peptides. Furthermore, gluten peptide deamidation extended the T-cell-receptor repertoire by relieving the requirement for a charged residue in CDR3beta. Thus, the lack of a negative charge at position beta57 in MHC class II was met by negatively charged residues in the T-cell receptor or in the peptide, the combination of which might explain the role of HLA-DQ8 in amplifying the T-cell response against dietary gluten.},

Although a gluten-free diet is currently the "safe" and appropriate therapy for celiac disease, this is not always an easy and simple option as "harmful" gluten may contaminate food during the processing and preparation phases. There are also further social pressures, which might be more pressing for young celiac patients, in following a strict gluten-free diet. Therefore, a new therapeutic approaches are sought which would permit celiacs to "peacefully" coexist with gluten. Presently, the most promising looks search for genetically modified wheat lacking toxic gluten peptides and the use of oral endopeptidases in attempt to curb gluten toxicity. Recently discovered role of anti-tissue transglutaminase antibodies in celiac pathogenesis has brought a prospect for a new hypothetical therapeutic approach, an oral immunization of celiacs with xenogeneic anti-tissue transglutaminase antibodies.},

The indigestible fragments generated from gluten are actively transported to the vicinity of sites which are critical for recognition of intestinal basement membrane by enterocytes. The fragments are attached in the vicinity of those sites by transamidation and make the recognition sites unavailable. Enterocytes are lost because they do not recognize that they are in the right place. Proliferation in the crypts of Lieberkuhn and immune reactions in the epithelium are normal and appropriate. This hypothesis is shown to be compatible with a variety of observations, some of which are difficult to explain otherwise. Absence of a good animal model is laid to the sensitive site being a human peculiarity. The pattern of damage and the fact of recovery on a gluten-free diet are explained since the immune reactions and tissue remodeling observed are normal responses to tissue damage.},

Gluten-free diet (GFD) is required to achieve remission and prevent complications; however, study reports on GFD growth effect are not consistent. METHODS: Compliance with GFD was estimated according to current body mass and height; presence of anaemia and other signs and symptoms; and attitude toward GFD. RESULTS: Seventy-one patients with CD (mean age = 12 years; mean age after CD diagnosis = 9 years) were examined and their blood sampled for determination of endomysial antibodies (EMA), haemoglobin, and red blood cell count. Questionnaire analysis revealed 42 (59.1%; 4 EMA positive) patients to be on strict GFD, 19 (26.8%; 5 EMA positive) were taking small amounts of gluten, and 10 (14.1%; all EMA positive) were not on a diet at all. The patients on strict GFD had greatest body height, yet the difference was not significant. These patients also had a higher mean body mass (P = 0.05) and significantly higher mean haemoglobin and mean cell haemoglobin levels (P = 0.05 and P < 0.05, respectively). Apart from chronic fatigue in patients on partial diet (P = 0.05), patient groups did not differ significantly in the frequency of symptoms. Anaemia and delayed puberty were recorded only in noncompliers (P < 0.01 and P < 0.05, respectively). Noncompliers often found the specific diet to pose a major life burden (P < 0.01) and did not visit a gastroenterologist on a regular basis (P < 0.01). CONCLUSIONS: Almost half of the coeliac patients were likely to abandon GFD without experiencing major symptoms, thus increasing the risk for developing complications later in life. An active attitude is required in the follow-up of patients with CD.},

   abstract = {Celiac disease and lactose intolerance are both relatively frequent diseases with symptoms occurring after ingestion of certain food components. In celiac disease wheat gluten and related proteins of other cereals induce an inflammatory disease of the small intestine in predisposed individuals, leading to gastrointestinal and extraintestinal symptoms. Moreover, there is an association with many other diseases and besides classic symptoms (diarrhea, weight loss, malabsorption) atypical courses with less or lacking gastrointestinal symptoms exist. The prevalence is about 1 : 100 (Europe, USA) and higher than supposed earlier. Diagnostic criteria include serologic tests (tissue transglutaminase antibody, endomysial antibody) and characteristic small bowel histology (lymphocytic infiltration, villous atrophy). Therapy is a strict and lifelong gluten-free diet. Rarely, refractory disease or lack of compliance are associated with increased risk of malignancy and worse prognosis. Lactose intolerance is attributed to low intestinal lactase levels, due to reduced genetic expression or mucosal injury and consequent intolerance to dairy products. The frequency is varying in different ethnic groups, occurring in 10-15% of Northern European people. Intensity of clinical symptoms (diarrhea, abdominal pain, bloating) depends on the amount of ingested lactose and individual activity of intestinal lactase. The capacity of lactose malabsorption can be measured using the noninvasive lactose breath hydrogen test. The treatment is based on a reduced dietary lactose intake or in case of secondary form treatment of the underlying disease.},

Cow's milk protein-sensitive enteropathy may persist in older children and shows characteristic histological features. The advent of magnification endoscopy may allow the macroscopic detection of unrecognised villous atrophy in these patients. AIM: the aim of the study was to evaluate the duodenum mucosa in older children with CM A in infancy using chromoendoscopy and magnification endoscopy. METHODS: the study involved 15 children (mean age 15 years; range 12-18) with CM A diagnosed and treated in infancy, currently on normal diet, referred to our department due to abdominal pain. The control group consisted of 8 children with abdominal pain without any evidence of allergy (mean age 15 years, range 13-18). In all patients magnification endoscopy and chromoendoscopy was performed under general anaesthesia (GIFQ 160Z, Olympus). The bulb and the descending portion of the duodenum were examined. 1% methylene blue was used for staining. Each endoscopy was recorded on DVD. Patients with celiac disease, after surgery or treated for other disorders were excluded from this part of the investigation. RESULTS: seven of 15 patients with CM A in infancy had focal villous atrophy of the descending part of the duodenum. In the control group, the villous atrophy was seen in one case. CONCLUSIONS: 1. Magnification endoscopy and chromoendoscopy are a valuable method of detecting focal villous atrophy in patients with suspected food allergy. 2. Focal villous atrophy may indicate the presence of food hypersensitivity of persisting from infancy process.},

   abstract = {Celiac disease is a common condition that is thought to affect 1 in 200 people throughout Europe and America, with prevalence rates reaching 1:100 in Ireland. Improvements in the sensitivity and specificity of serological testing for celiac disease over the past 15 years have resulted in a larger number of diagnoses being made. Up to 34% of patients with newly diagnosed celiac disease are older than 60 years of age. The symptomatic presentation of celiac disease in elderly patients can be subtle, leading to a considerable delay in diagnosis and potential accumulation of associated secondary complications. Given that celiac disease is associated with significant morbidity and reduced life expectancy, physicians need to be aware of this condition and its occurrence in the current increasingly elderly population. Compliance with a strict gluten-free diet is as easily achieved in elderly patients as in younger patients, and has been reported to reduce the risks of cancer and lymphoma associated with celiac disease. This Review highlights age-related differences in the clinical presentation and investigation of patients with suspected celiac disease.},

   abstract = {OBJECTIVE: Celiac disease (CD) is a T-lymphocyte-mediated small intestinal enteropathy triggered and maintained by dietary gluten, with a strong genetic component mapping to the HLA genes encoding for the class II DQ(alpha1*0501, beta1*02) molecule. Damage of the small intestine may cause a variety of clinical signs ranging from isolated long-standing iron-deficiency anemia refractory to iron supplementation to forms of severe malnutrition that may become life threatening. However, patients carrying the typical intestinal lesions of CD and presenting no symptoms at all (silent CD) are also a common clinical observation. Since it is commonly assumed that clinical signs and symptoms tend to correlate with the severity of the intestinal damage, the purpose of this study was to investigate whether particular HLA class II genotypes might also influence the extent of intestinal damage and consequently the clinical presentation of the disease. MATERIAL AND METHODS: We retrospectively compared histological grading of celiac disease intestinal biopsies with HLA haplotype, age at onset of disease and clinical signs and symptoms. RESULTS: Our findings showed that homozygosis for the DQB1*0201 allele is associated with a higher severity of the histological score (p<0.008). Of note for the clinician, this work also suggests that the same type 3c of intestinal damage causes a different clinical syndrome, depending on the patient's age. CONCLUSIONS: The genetic predisposition at the HLA-DQB1 locus influences the severity of the mucosal damage in a dose-dependent manner, but not the clinical presentation, of celiac disease.},

   abstract = {In coeliac disease gluten induces an immunological reaction in genetically susceptible patients, and influences on epithelial cell proliferation and differentiation in the small-bowel mucosa. Our aim was to find novel genes which operate similarly in epithelial proliferation and differentiation in an epithelial cell differentiation model and in coeliac disease patient small-bowel mucosal biopsy samples. The combination of cDNA microarray data originating from a three-dimensional T84 epithelial cell differentiation model and small-bowel mucosal biopsy samples from untreated and treated coeliac disease patients and healthy controls resulted in 30 genes whose mRNA expression was similarly affected. Nine of 30 were located directly or indirectly in the receptor tyrosine kinase pathway starting from the epithelial growth factor receptor. Removal of gluten from the diet resulted in a reversion in the expression of 29 of the 30 genes in the small-bowel mucosal biopsy samples. Further characterization by blotting and labelling revealed increased epidermal growth factor receptor and beta-catenin protein expression in the small-bowel mucosal epithelium in untreated coeliac disease patients compared to healthy controls and treated coeliac patients. We found 30 genes whose mRNA expression was affected similarly in the epithelial cell differentiation model and in the coeliac disease patient small-bowel mucosal biopsy samples. In particular, those genes involved in the epithelial growth factor-mediated signalling pathways may be involved in epithelial cell differentiation and coeliac disease pathogenesis. The epithelial cell differentiation model is a useful tool for studying gene expression changes in the crypt-villus axis.},

The patient reported a history of recurrent pulmonary infections and intermittent intestinal symptoms in childhood. Wegner granulomatosis was initially suspected because of rhinopulmonary involvement. Serum's patient was tested for ANCA and anti-tissue antibodies. The latest test was performed on histological sections from rat and revealed the presence of anti-reticulin antibodies. Further testing, for anti-tissue transglutaminase and anti-endomysium antibodies, revealed positive results. Celiac disease was confirmed by histological examination of intestinal biopsy. Pulmonary symptoms were improved on a gluten free diet suggesting a causal relationship between celiac disease and respiratory symptoms.},

As it is well established that the interaction between proline-rich gluten derived peptides and the human HLA-DQ2 molecules induces immune responses that lead to disease development, we have now designed a series of gluten peptides in which proline residues were replaced by azidoprolines. These peptides were found to bind to HLA-DQ2 with an affinity similar to that of the natural gluten peptide. Moreover, some of these peptides were found to be non-immunogenic and block gluten induced immune responses. These can thus serve as lead compounds for the development of HLA-DQ2 blocker peptides.},

OBJECTIVE: The authors sought to perform a systematic study on eating pathology in CD. METHOD: CD patients were assessed for eating disorders by questionnaire, and body mass index was recorded. RESULTS: There was a higher rate of eating pathology in CD patients than would be expected, especially, a higher rate of bulimia nervosa. This subgroup reported more noncompliance with the gluten-free diet and had higher scores on most eating-related questionnaires. In most cases, diagnosis of CD preceded the onset of eating pathology. CONCLUSION: The authors recommend asking early-adolescent CD patients whether they are also dieting for aesthetic reasons.},

   abstract = {Wheat starch is used to make baked products for celiac patients in several European countries but is avoided in the United States because of uncertainty about the amounts of associated grain storage (gluten) proteins. People with celiac disease (CD) must avoid wheat, rye, and barley proteins and products that contain them. These proteins are capable of initiating damage to the absorptive lining of the small intestine in CD patients, apparently as a consequence of undesirable interactions with the innate and adaptive immune systems. In this study, starch surface-associated proteins were extracted from four commercial wheat starches, fractionated by high-performance liquid chromatography and gel electrophoresis, and identified by tandem mass spectrometry analysis. More than 150 proteins were identified, many of which (for example, histones, purothionins, and glutenins) had not been recognized previously as starch-associated. The commercial starches were analyzed by the R-5 enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay method to estimate the amount of harmful gluten protein present. One of these starches had a low gluten content of 7 ppm and actually fell within the range proposed as a new Codex Alimentarius Standard for naturally gluten-free foods (maximum 20 ppm). This low level of gluten indicates that the starch should be especially suitable for use by celiac patients, although wheat starches with levels up to 100 ppm are deemed safe in the proposed Codex standards.},

The purpose of this study was to compare these serological tests with a new test recognizing antibodies against deamidated and defined gliadin peptides. MATERIAL AND METHODS: The study population comprised selected coeliac disease patients in a tertiary clinic: newly detected patients before and after a gluten-free diet, patients with persistent small-bowel mucosal villous atrophy despite a strict gluten-free diet and non-coeliac controls reporting abdominal symptoms after ingestion of cereals. Comparisons were made between serum IgA-class gliadin peptide, endomysial, tissue transglutaminase and conventional gliadin antibodies. RESULTS: The deamidated gliadin peptide antibody test showed a sensitivity of 91% and a specificity of 98% in coeliac disease. The tissue transglutaminase antibody test performed equally well. The specificity of endomysial antibody was just as high, but its sensitivity was lower, 80%. The conventional gliadin antibody test showed poor sensitivity and specificity. Combination of the deamidated gliadin peptide and tissue transglutaminase tests offered the best sensitivity without loss of specificity in the diagnosis of coeliac disease. All antibody levels declined in line with mucosal recovery. The deamidated gliadin peptide antibody test showed six of the nine cases with small-bowel mucosal damage persisting on a gluten-free diet, whereas tissue transglutaminase detected only two cases and endomysial antibody none. CONCLUSIONS: The new gliadin peptide antibody test proved highly accurate in the diagnostic work-up and follow-up of coeliac disease and can be endorsed in combination with the tissue transglutaminase test.},

   abstract = {BACKGROUND: Refractory sprue with malabsorption carries a risk of lymphoma. AIM: To examine whether a good clinical but poor histological response during a strict gluten-free diet predicts a poor outcome. METHODS: The study involved all coeliac patients who showed no histological recovery within 2 years on a strict gluten-free diet. Small intestinal biopsy and bone mineral density were investigated in 2001 and clinical features were followed up until 2005. The results were compared to those in 18 coeliac patients with a good histological recovery. RESULTS: Thirteen coeliac patients had persistent small intestinal villous atrophy despite maintaining gluten-free diet. All had demonstrated a good clinical response. Osteoporosis was found in 58% and 22% of the non-responders and responders, respectively (P = 0.04). In 2005, two of the non-responders had developed symptomatic refractory sprue, one died of lymphoma and one of carcinoid tumour, and one gastric adenocarcinoma was operated. None of the 18 controls had developed refractory sprue or malignancy. The frequency of histological non-responsive disease was 1.9%. CONCLUSIONS: Persistent villous atrophy in adult coeliac disease, even in the absence of symptoms, carries a risk of subsequent severe complications. The follow-up biopsy is important in detecting these individuals.},

These products contain low amounts of residual gluten and it has been questioned whether they are safe for coeliac disease patients. AIM: To investigate whether coeliac disease patients can safely consume wheat-based starch hydrolysate products. METHODS: This randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled, prospective follow-up study involved 90 coeliac disease patients in remission randomized to consume glucose syrups, maltodextrins or placebo for 24 weeks. Small bowel mucosal morphology and inflammation, symptoms, coeliac serology and malabsorption laboratory data were evaluated at baseline and at the end of the study. RESULTS: Daily ingestion of wheat-based starch hydrolysates, glucose syrups and maltodextrins, had no deleterious effect on small-bowel mucosal villous architecture or inflammation in coeliac disease patients when compared to the placebo group. Neither were there any significant differences in gastrointestinal symptoms, serology or malabsorption parameters after 24 weeks. CONCLUSIONS: Wheat-based starch hydrolysates, glucose syrups and maltodextrins did not have harmful effect on coeliac disease patients. Coeliac patients can thus safely continue to consume these products.},

The objective of the present study was to clarify its applicability by analysing local cellular immunological responses after 5 years' consumption of oats by adult coeliac patients. MATERIAL AND METHODS: Forty-two coeliac patients took part in an earlier oats intervention study for 6-12 months. Twenty-two of these patients originally consumed oats as part of their gluten-free diet. During the 5-year follow-up 10 patients had felt uncertain about the safety of long-term consumption of oats and gave up this part of their diet. Finally, 12 of the 22 patients consumed oats for the whole 5-year period. The control group consisted of the remaining 20 coeliac patients using a strict, conventional, gluten-free diet without oats. Intraepithelial CD3, alphabetaTCR (alphabetaIEL) and gammadeltaTCR (gammadeltaIEL) T cells were counted after specific staining of small intestinal biopsy specimens. RESULTS: There were no differences in the densities of CD3, alphabetaIEL and gammadeltaIEL T cells between the oat and the control groups. CONCLUSIONS: Long-term use of oats included in the gluten-free diets of patients with coeliac disease does not stimulate an immunological response locally in the mucosa of the small intestine.},

   abstract = {OBJECTIVE: There is evidence for the long-term safety of oats as part of a gluten-free diet in coeliac disease (CD). Oats is generally processed by kilning, which theoretically may change its antigenic properties and be the reason that it is tolerated by patients with CD. The aim of this study was to investigate the suitability of large amounts of unkilned oats, comparing its use with kilned oats in adult coeliac patients. MATERIAL AND METHODS: The study group included 13 men and 19 women with CD in remission. The goal of daily intake of oats was 100 g during one year. These patients using oats as part of their gluten-free diet were randomized to two treatment groups. One group used regular oats and the other unkilned oats. After 6 months the patients changed the treatment groups. Food intake, symptoms, histology of the small intestine and the levels of endomysial antibodies were noted. RESULTS: No marked changes were found in the duodenal biopsies, in the levels of endomysial antibodies or in the well-being of the patients. Compliance with the diet did not change during the follow-up. CONCLUSIONS: Large amounts of both unkilned and regular kilned oats are well tolerated by adult patients with CD. Oats is therefore not harmful, even in its unkilned form, which indicates that its antigenic nature is not changed by common industrial food processing in such a way that would prevent the provoking of CD.},

PATIENTS AND METHODS: Patients with IPH treated at the Children's Hospital of Tunis between 1976 and 2006 were reviewed and investigated for CD, using serological and histological tests. RESULTS: A total of 10 children (two boys and eight girls) had IPH. The mean age at diagnosis was 3.1 years. Three had digestive symptoms and positive CD serology, which was confirmed by histological data. Clinical and radiological findings improved markedly in all CD patients with corticosteroid treatment combined with a gluten-free diet. Symptoms of IPH and CD both returned in one patient who stopped the gluten-free diet. CONCLUSION: Three of our 10 patients with IPH also had CD. These data illustrate the close etiopathogenic link between IPH and CD, and strongly suggest that CD be looked for in IPH patients, especially in those with symptoms suggestive of CD.},

There is anecdotal evidence to suggest that gluten sensitivity may play a role in psoriasis, and patients with psoriasis in Europe have been reported to improve on a gluten-free diet. OBJECTIVE: To assess whether patients with psoriasis in the US have an increased prevalence of elevated AGAs. METHOD: A US sample of patients with psoriasis (n=100), patients with psoriasis and psoriatic arthritis (n=100), and age-matched control individuals without any personal or family history of autoimmune disorders (n=100) were tested for IgG and IgA AGAs. RESULTS: No difference in the prevalence of abnormal AGAs among patients with psoriasis (14%), combined psoriasis and psoriatic arthritis (18%), and control individuals (19%) was observed. No significant correlations between AGA positivity and psoriasis severity, joint involvement, or age of onset of psoriasis or arthritis were observed. CONCLUSION: We found no support for the results of prior studies showing that elevated AGAs occur with increased frequency in patients with psoriasis. Furthermore, the relatively high prevalence of abnormal AGAs in our control population suggests these antibodies may not be associated with autoimmune disease.},

METHODS: A retrospective review of medical records and a follow-up interview of 102 children (65 girls, 37 boys) at diagnosis of coeliac disease. The inclusion criteria were age >18 months, increased levels of serum antitissue transglutaminase IgA antibodies and pathologic small-bowel mucosal biopsy. Anthropometric data were calculated for children 1.5-11 years of age. RESULTS: The levels of serum antitissue transglutaminase IgA antibodies were either normal (92%) or slightly elevated (8%) in all children after 1 year on a gluten-free diet. The height-for-age Z score increased in 52 of 61 (85%) children, (median 0.26 SD, range -0.45 to 1.83 SD) and the weight-for-age Z score increased in 50 of 61 (82%) children (median 0.42 SD, range -0.77 to 2.24 SD). Sixty of 61 (98%) children showed normal or catch-up growth. Regression of symptoms after 1 year on a gluten-free diet was reported for 71 of 72 (98%) children. CONCLUSION: We propose that a control biopsy is not necessary for the diagnosis of coeliac disease in these children.},

   abstract = {Chronic angiotensin II (Ang II) infusion, in rats fed high salt, engages the sympathetic nervous system to increase venomotor tone. The splanchnic sympathetic nervous system is the most important regulator of venous tone, indicating that splanchnic sympathetic nervous system activity may be increased in Ang II salt hypertension. We hypothesized that celiac ganglionectomy (CGx), to selectively disrupt sympathetic innervation to the splanchnic circulation, would attenuate arterial pressure (AP), and venous tone increases in Ang II salt hypertension. Rats fed 2% or 0.4% NaCl were instrumented to allow AP measurement by radiotelemetry at the same time as surgical CGx or sham operation. Ang II was delivered by minipump (150 ng/kg per minute) for 14 days. CGx reduced AP independent of salt diet during control. CGx markedly attenuated Ang II hypertension in rats on 2% NaCl but had little effect in rats fed 0.4% NaCl. To test the possibility that CGx exerted its effects via renal denervation, rats were subjected to the same protocol but received selective bilateral renal denervation. Renal denervation decreased AP during control but had no protective effect on Ang II hypertension and actually tended to exacerbate the pressor response. Finally, separate groups of rats underwent CGx or sham operation and were instrumented to allow repeated measures of mean circulatory filling pressure, an index of venous tone. In addition to attenuating Ang II salt hypertension, CGx completely prevented Ang II salt-induced increases in mean circulatory filling pressure and substantially attenuated depressor responses to acute ganglion blockade. We conclude that, in the presence of high salt, Ang II activates the splanchnic sympathetic nervous system to increase venomotor tone and AP.},

To compare dietary intakes of people with CD to the dietary intake of the general population. The nutritional contribution of gluten-free products (GFPs) and current purchasing trends was also evaluated. SUBJECTS/METHODS: 106 patients were invited to participate via post. Three-day food diary to assess intake and a short simple questionnaire that looked at purchasing trends of GFP. RESULTS: Forty-nine patients returned the food diary and 48 returned the questionnaire. Patients were found to have a low intake of energy, non-starch polysaccharides (NSPs), vitamin D and calcium. They were obtaining a significantly lower proportion of energy from fat and a significantly higher proportion of energy from protein than the DRVs (P<0.05). Intake was comparable to the general population for most nutrients, except they had a significantly greater intake of protein, a lower intake of fat and a significantly lower intake of vitamin D (P<0.05). Specialist GFP, especially those obtained on prescription, were an important source of energy, carbohydrate, NSP, calcium and iron. CONCLUSIONS: Patients with CD are at risk of having an inadequate intake of calcium, NSP and vitamin D. Specialist GFP, which were obtained on prescription, helped patients get a balanced diet and without these patients would be at an increased risk of many deficiencies.},

She had no gastrointestinal symptoms and reported no allergies. The family history did not reveal any obvious or familial disease. DIAGNOSIS, TREATMENT AND COURSE: Whole blood analysis showed severe macrocytic anemia. The vitamin B12 level was reduced and biopsies revealed autoimmune gastritis and typical megaloblastic changes in the bone marrow. Gastroscopy showed marked mucosal atrophy as seen in celiac disease. Vitamin B12 was administered parenterally and she was put on a gluten-free diet. CONCLUSION: The combination of autoimmune gastritis and celiac sprue is most likely a variant of the polyglandular autoimmune syndrome type 2. Early diagnosis, life-long gluten-free diet and vitamin B12 administration as well as appropriate aftercare prevent serious complications.},

   abstract = {BACKGROUND: The populations in adjacent Russian Karelia and Finland are equally exposed to grain products and share partly the same ancestry, but live in completely different socioeconomic environments. AIM: This creates an ideal epidemiological setting to study gene-environmental interactions in pathogenesis of celiac disease. METHODS: The prevalence of celiac disease and predisposing human leukocyte antigen (HLA) alleles was compared between Russian Karelia and Finland. Tissue transglutaminase antibodies and HLA-DQ alleles were screened from 1988 schoolchildren from Karelia and 3654 children from Finland. Children with transglutaminase antibodies were invited to small-bowel biopsy. Results. Transglutaminase antibodies were less frequent in Russian Karelia than in Finland (0.6% versus 1.4%, P = 0.005). Immunoglobulin class G (IgG) antigliadin antibodies were also less frequent in Russian Karelia (10.2% versus 28.3%, P<0.0001). Celiac disease was confirmed by duodenal biopsy in four of the eight transglutaminase antibody-positive Karelian children, giving a prevalence of 1 in 496 compared to 1 in 107 children in Finland. The same HLA-DQ alleles were associated with celiac disease and transglutaminase antibody positivity in both populations. CONCLUSIONS: The prevalence of transglutaminase antibodies and celiac disease is lower in Russian Karelia than in Finland. This may be associated with a protective environment characterized by inferior prosperity and standard of hygiene in Karelia.},

   abstract = {OBJECTIVE: To evaluate the feasibility and diagnostic accuracy of screening for coeliac disease by rapid detection of IgA antibodies to tissue transglutaminase performed in primary care. DESIGN: District nurses screened 6 year old children using rapid antibody testing of finger prick blood. They also collected capillary blood samples for laboratory determination of IgA and IgG antibodies to endomysium and IgA antibodies to tissue transglutaminase. Children with positive rapid test results were directly sent for biopsy of the small intestine. Setting Primary care in Jasz-Nagykun-Szolnok county, Hungary. PARTICIPANTS: 2690 children (77% of 6 year olds living in the county) and 120 nurses. MAIN OUTCOME MEASURES: Positivity for antibodies to endomysium or transglutaminase in the laboratory and coeliac disease confirmed at biopsy. RESULTS: 37 children (1.4%, 95% confidence interval 0.9% to 1.8%) had biopsy confirmed coeliac disease. Only five of these children had been diagnosed clinically before screening. Rapid testing had a 78.1% sensitivity (70.0% to 89.3%) and 100% specificity (88.4% to 100%) for a final diagnosis of coeliac disease by biopsy. Sensitivity was 65.1% (50.2% to 77.6%) and specificity was 100% (99.8% to 100%) compared with combined results of IgA and IgG laboratory tests. Trained laboratory workers detected 30 of the 31 newly diagnosed IgA competent patients with the rapid test kit used blindly. Median time to biopsy after a positive rapid test result was significantly shorter (20 days, range 4-148) than after a positive laboratory result (142 days, 70-256; P<0.001). Children with coeliac disease detected at screening were smaller and had worse health status than their peers but they improved on a gluten-free diet. CONCLUSIONS: A simple rapid antibody test enabled primary care nurses to detect patients with coeliac disease in the community who were not picked up in clinical care. Extra training is needed to improve sensitivity.},

   abstract = {Coeliac disease is caused by dietary gluten, triggering a chronic inflammation of the small intestine in genetically predisposed individuals. Recently, a risk locus on chromosome 2q11-q12, harbouring interleukin 18 receptor accessory protein (IL18RAP) and three other genes, was suggested for coeliac disease. IL18 has been shown to play an important role in T helper type 1 activity in coeliac disease, making this locus a highly interesting candidate. In this study, two previously indicated risk variants at the IL18RAP locus (rs13015714 and rs917997) were tested for genetic association in 1638 cases with coeliac disease and 1385 control individuals from the Finnish, Hungarian and Italian populations. The protein expression level of IL18RAP was also compared between risk allele carriers and non-carriers by Western blotting. Furthermore, immunohistochemical analysis was performed to study IL18RAP protein expression in small intestinal biopsies of untreated and treated coeliac patients and controls. We confirmed genetic association and dose effects of variants at the 2q12.1 locus with coeliac disease in the Hungarian population. The GA haplotype of the markers rs13015714 and rs917997 showed the strongest association (P = 0.0001, odds ratio = 1.475, 95% confidence interval 1.21-1.80). Two putative isoforms of IL18RAP were detected and the ratios and total levels of these isoforms may contribute to the aetiology of coeliac disease. Our study supports IL18RAP as a novel predisposing gene for coeliac disease and highlights the need for further functional studies on this relatively unknown gene in coeliac disease pathogenesis.},

   abstract = {BACKGROUND: Coeliac disease is caused by dietary gluten, which triggers chronic inflammation of the small intestine in genetically predisposed individuals. In one quarter of the patients the disease manifests in the skin as dermatitis herpetiformis. Recently, a novel candidate gene, myosin IXB on chromosome 19p13, was shown to be associated with coeliac disease in the Dutch and Spanish populations. The same gene has previously been associated with inflammatory bowel disease, systemic lupus erythematosus and rheumatoid arthritis risk, making myosin IXB a potential shared risk factor in these inflammatory disorders. METHODS: In this study, previously reported myosin IXB variants were tested for genetic linkage and association with coeliac disease in 495 Hungarian and Finnish families and in an additional 270 patients and controls. RESULTS AND CONCLUSION: The results show significant linkage (logarithm of odds (LOD) 3.76, p = 0.00002) to 19p13 which supports the presence of a genuine risk factor for coeliac disease in this locus. Myosin IXB variants were not associated with coeliac disease in this study; however, weak evidence of association with dermatitis herpetiformis was found. The association could not explain the strong linkage seen in both phenotypes, indicating that the role of other neighbouring genes in the region cannot be excluded. Therefore, more detailed genetic and functional studies are required to characterise the role of the myosin IXB gene in both coeliac disease and dermatitis herpetiformis.},

   abstract = {OBJECTIVES: In coeliac disease, immunoglobulin (Ig)A-class autoantibodies against transglutaminase-2 are produced in the small intestinal mucosa, where they are deposited extracellularly. It remains unclear whether positive intestinal transglutaminase-2-targeted IgA deposits in subjects having normal small bowel mucosal morphology are signs of early-stage coeliac disease. We evaluated the gluten dependency of these deposits in overt and mild enteropathy coeliac disease. PATIENTS AND METHODS: All together 48 subjects suspected of coeliac disease but having normal small bowel mucosal villi were enrolled; 28 of them had latent coeliac disease. The remaining 20 having positive intestinal IgA deposits adopted a gluten-free diet before villous atrophy had developed. For comparison, 13 patients with overt coeliac disease and 42 noncoeliac controls were studied. Small bowel mucosal transglutaminase-2-specific autoantibodies were compared with villous morphology, intraepithelial lymphocyte densities, and serum coeliac autoantibodies. RESULTS: Intestinal IgA deposits were seen in all but 1 of the patients with latent coeliac disease, when the morphology was still intact; the intensity of these deposits increased as villous atrophy developed and decreased again on a gluten-free diet. In 20 patients with intestinal IgA deposits in normal villi, the intensity of the deposits decreased with the diet similarly to that seen in patients with overt coeliac disease. Mucosal IgA deposits were seen initially only in 5% of noncoeliac controls and in 8% after extended gluten consumption. CONCLUSIONS: The response of small bowel mucosal transglutaminase-2-specific IgA deposits for dietary intervention was similar in overt and mild enteropathy coeliac disease. Detection of such IgA deposits thus offers a good diagnostic tool to uncover early-stage coeliac disease.},

   abstract = {Coeliac disease is an autoimmune enteropathy precipitated by the gluten content of cereals. It had for long been considered a childhood condition as clinical symptoms manifested when gluten was introduced into the diet. The introduction of specific serological markers changed our understanding of the epidemiology and semiology of the syndrome. The main difficulty of the diagnostics arises from the fact that over 50% of patients with gluten-sensitive enteropathy show atypical symptoms, while coeliac-disease patients with extra-gastrointestinal manifestations show no gastrointestinal symptoms at all. Diagnostics of coeliac disease is currently based on the detection of specific antibodies and the histological assessment of the duodenum. Macroscopic signs of villous atrophy (reduction in the number or loss of Kerking's folds, vascular pattern visible through the mucosa, "mosaic or micronodular" pattern, "scalloped" folds) are clearly visible in untreated patients. Capsule endoscopy, contrary to conventional endoscopic approaches, enables non-invasive, pain-free investigation of the entire small intestine. Duodenal mucosa is visualised at an 8:1 magnification during the investigation, enabling the assessment of villous atrophy by an experienced investigator. Based on preliminary experience, standard upper tract endoscopy and capsule endoscopy appear to exhibit equal levels of sensitivity and specificity for coeliac disease. The advantage of CE versus upper tract endoscopy lies in the complete assessibility of the small intestine, thus also enabling the assessment of the spread and severity of the disease. The disadvantage associated with the approach is the lack of histological biopsy samples. CE is recommendable as a first line approach for patients with proven coeliac disease when alarm conditions appear.},

Here, using rectal protein challenge, we investigated the local inflammatory reaction to gluten and CM protein in adult patients with CD in remission. Rectal challenges with wheat gluten and dried CM powder were performed in 20 patients with CD and 15 healthy controls. Fifteen hours after challenge the mucosal reaction was recorded by the mucosal patch technique with measurements of local release of neutrophil and eosinophil granule constituents; myeloperoxidase (MPO) and eosinophil cationic protein (ECP). We measured the mucosal production of nitric oxide (NO) simultaneously. Six of the patients who reacted to CM were also challenged with alpha-lactalbumin and casein. In 18 of 20 patients gluten challenge induced neutrophil activation defined as increased MPO release and increased NO synthesis. Ten of these 20 patients showed a similarly strong inflammatory reaction to CM challenge. Six of the CM sensitive patients were challenged with specific CM proteins: casein and alpha-lactalbumin. Casein, in contrast to alpha-lactalbumin, induced an inflammatory response similar to that produced by CM. A mucosal inflammatory response similar to that elicited by gluten was produced by CM protein in about 50% of the patients with coeliac disease. Casein, in particular, seems to be involved in this reaction.},

   abstract = {BACKGROUND & AIMS: The diagnostic criteria for celiac disease require small-bowel mucosal villous atrophy with crypt hyperplasia (Marsh III). However, mucosal damage develops gradually and patients may evince clinical symptoms before histologic changes appear. Endomysial antibodies are specific in predicting forthcoming villous atrophy. We hypothesized that patients with mild enteropathy but positive endomysial antibodies benefit from a gluten-free diet (GFD) similarly to patients with more severe enteropathy. METHODS: Small-bowel endoscopy together with clinical evaluations was performed in all together 70 consecutive adults with positive endomysial antibodies. Of these, 23 had only mild enteropathy (Marsh I-II) and they were randomized either to continue on a gluten-containing diet or start a GFD. After 1 year, clinical, serologic, and histologic evaluations were repeated. A total of 47 participants had small-bowel mucosal lesions compatible with celiac disease (Marsh III), and these served as disease controls. RESULTS: In the gluten-containing diet group (Marsh I-II) the small-bowel mucosal villous architecture deteriorated in all participants, and the symptoms and abnormal antibody titers persisted. In contrast, in the GFD group (Marsh I-II) the symptoms were alleviated, antibody titers decreased, and mucosal inflammation diminished equally to celiac controls (Marsh III). When the trial was completed, all participants chose to continue on a life-long GFD. CONCLUSIONS: Patients with endomysial antibodies benefit from a GFD regardless of the degree of enteropathy. The diagnostic criteria for celiac disease need re-evaluation: endomysial antibody positivity without atrophy belongs to the spectrum of genetic gluten intolerance, and warrants dietary treatment.},

   abstract = {BACKGROUND & AIMS: Celiac disease is an immune-mediated enteropathy triggered by gliadin, a component of the grain protein gluten. Gliadin induces an MyD88-dependent zonulin release that leads to increased intestinal permeability, a postulated early element in the pathogenesis of celiac disease. We aimed to establish the molecular basis of gliadin interaction with intestinal mucosa leading to intestinal barrier impairment. METHODS: Alpha-gliadin affinity column was loaded with intestinal mucosal membrane lysates to identify the putative gliadin-binding moiety. In vitro experiments with chemokine receptor CXCR3 transfectants were performed to confirm binding of gliadin and/or 26 overlapping 20mer alpha-gliadin synthetic peptides to the receptor. CXCR3 protein and gene expression were studied in intestinal epithelial cell lines and human biopsy specimens. Gliadin-CXCR3 interaction was further analyzed by immunofluorescence microscopy, laser capture microscopy, real-time reverse-transcription polymerase chain reaction, and immunoprecipitation/Western blot analysis. Ex vivo experiments were performed using C57BL/6 wild-type and CXCR3(-/-) mouse small intestines to measure intestinal permeability and zonulin release. RESULTS: Affinity column and colocalization experiments showed that gliadin binds to CXCR3 and that at least 2 alpha-gliadin 20mer synthetic peptides are involved in this binding. CXCR3 is expressed in mouse and human intestinal epithelia and lamina propria. Mucosal CXCR3 expression was elevated in active celiac disease but returned to baseline levels following implementation of a gluten-free diet. Gliadin induced physical association between CXCR3 and MyD88 in enterocytes. Gliadin increased zonulin release and intestinal permeability in wild-type but not CXCR3(-/-) mouse small intestine. CONCLUSIONS: Gliadin binds to CXCR3 and leads to MyD88-dependent zonulin release and increased intestinal permeability.},

   abstract = {Although it has been reported that cystic fibrosis and coeliac disease can coexist, a clear relationship between the two diseases has never been firmly established. Our case concerns a 56-year-old man with cystic fibrosis (delta F508/N1303J). Over the last two years he had been complaining about diarrhoea and meteorism. The serum level of tissue transglutaminase was elevated. Duodenoscopy showed a typical pattern for coeliac disease. This was confirmed by the biopsy. After three months on a gluten-free diet the symptoms had disappeared. In the literature there are some hypotheses to explain the coexistence of cystic fibrosis and coeliac disease. Due to pancreatic insufficiency in patients with cystic fibrosis the mucosa of the bowel may have more contact with the complete gluten protein. In addition, malnutrition might contribute to some additional mucosal damage. Both mechanisms might induce an inappropriate immune response to dietary gluten. In the literature all cystic fibrosis patients with coeliac disease were diagnosed with both diseases in childhood with a maximum latency between both diseases of 26 months. It seems unlikely that manifest coeliac disease remained undiagnosed in our patient since childhood. The long time gap between the diagnosis of cystic fibrosis and the first symptoms of the celiac disease in our patient could support the above-mentioned pathophysiological hypotheses.},

   abstract = {BACKGROUND: Coeliac disease is a common, autoimmune disorder, for which the only treatment is lifelong adherence to a gluten-free diet. This study evaluates the economic burden of adhering to a gluten-free diet. METHODS: A market basket of products identified by name brand, weight or package size for both regular wheat-based products and gluten-free counterparts was developed. The differences in price between purchase venues, both type of store (general grocery store, an upscale grocery store and a health food store and four internet-based grocery sites) and region was also analysed. RESULTS: Availability of gluten-free products varied between the different venues, regular grocery stores carried 36%, while upscale markets carried 41%, and health food stores 94%, compared with 100% availability on the internet. Overall, every gluten-free product was more expensive than their wheat-based counterpart (P <or= 0.05). Bread and pasta was twice as expensive as their wheat-based counterparts. Cost was affected more by shopping venue than geographic location. CONCLUSIONS: This study demonstrated that gluten-free foods have poor availability and are more expensive than their gluten-containing counterparts. The impact of these findings on dietary compliance and the quality of life needs to be addressed.},

AIM: To assess whether exocrine pancreatic insufficiency causes persisting symptoms compared with controls, we determined whether pancreatic enzyme supplementation provided symptomatic benefit in coeliac patients with chronic diarrhoea. METHODS: Patients (n = 259) were subdivided into four groups: (a) new coeliac disease (n = 57), (b) coeliac disease patients on a gluten-free diet without gastrointestinal symptoms (n = 86), (c) coeliac disease patients on a gluten-free diet with chronic diarrhoea (n = 66) and (d) patients with chronic diarrhoea without coeliac disease (n = 50). Stool frequency and weight, before and after treatment with pancreatic enzyme supplementation were recorded. RESULTS: The prevalence of a low faecal elastase-1 within the groups was: group (A) six of 57 (11%), group (B) five of 86 (6%), group (C) 20 of 66 (30%) and group (D) two of 50 (4%). Low faecal elastase-1 was more frequent in coeliac disease patients with chronic diarrhoea vs. other subgroups of coeliac disease (P < or = 0.0001) and controls (P < or = 0.0003). In 18 of 20 stool frequency reduced following pancreatic enzyme supplementation from four per day to one (P < or = 0.001). No weight increase (P = 0.3) was observed. CONCLUSIONS: Low faecal elastase is common in patients with coeliac disease and chronic diarrhoea, suggesting exocrine pancreatic insufficiency. In this group of patients, pancreatic enzyme supplementation may provide symptomatic benefit.},

   abstract = {INTRODUCTION: Coeliac disease is a common but often under diagnosed condition with important complications. It is due to immune-mediated gluten intolerance and may present in a number of ways. It has become more frequently diagnosed due to the recognition of the atypical presentations. In recent years, more sensitive and specific serological markers have been developed but the gold standard of diagnosis remains duodenal biopsy. Compliance with a strict, lifelong gluten-free diet is the cornerstone of management, improving symptoms and reducing complications of the disease. SOURCES OF DATA: For this review, we focused on papers published on coeliac disease in recent years. Particular emphasis was given to clinical papers examining new methods for the diagnosis of coeliac disease or newer therapies for managing complications. The main source was PubMed and the major gastroenterology journals. AREAS OF AGREEMENT: Coeliac disease is more common than once thought with a prevalence of around 1%. Diagnosis should always be confirmed with a duodenal biopsy. Management of coeliac disease with a gluten-free diet remains the cornerstone of treatment. AREAS OF CONTROVERSY: Some complications of coeliac disease, especially neurological, are not widely accepted despite growing support from the literature. Management of enteropathy-associated lymphoma has been difficult, and the optimal therapy is not known. GROWING POINTS: Current understanding is such that coeliac disease is the most widely understood autoimmune condition. 'Atypical' presentations are becoming the most common presenting features of coeliac disease. AREAS TIMELY FOR DEVELOPING RESEARCH: Alternatives to the gluten-free diet are about to go into clinical studies. Similarly, better serological screening tests may obviate the need for duodenal biopsy. This review will try to summarize the current understanding of coeliac disease with regard to diagnosis, management, complications and future perspectives.},

   abstract = {Celiac disease is an inflammatory disorder in which certain peptides from wheat and related grains trigger and maintain an immune reaction in the small intestine. Anorexia nervosa and bulimia nervosa are eating disorders that are morbid and, at times, life-threatening forms of psychopathology. Despite a large body of evidence describing the detrimental effects of eating disorders on the gastrointestinal system, information on the role of the gastrointestinal system in causing or mimicking eating disorders is scarce. To date, eating disorders, as a comorbid condition affecting individuals with celiac disease, has received surprisingly little attention with only a single report found in peer-reviewed literature. In this report, we describe a series of 10 individuals with both celiac disease and eating disorders. These cases demonstrate the complex ways in which celiac disease and eating disorders interact with important clinical implications for the diagnosis and treatment of both illnesses. Our findings suggest that clinicians treating patients with eating disorders or celiac disease should be aware of both conditions to provide optimum care.},

   abstract = {BACKGROUND & AIMS: Nonresponsive celiac disease (NRCD) is a common problem affecting from 7% to 30% of celiac patients. Because NRCD comprises varied and potentially morbid entities, efficient and cost-effective patient care requires knowledge of the specific causes of this disorder. The aim of this study was to determine the common etiologies of NRCD in a tertiary referral center. METHODS: All cases of biopsy examination-proven celiac disease (CD) seen at our institution over the preceding 5 years were included in this study. NRCD was defined as a failure to respond to at least 6 months of treatment with a gluten-free diet or the re-emergence of symptoms or laboratory abnormalities typical of CD while still on treatment with a gluten-free diet. RESULTS: A total of 113 patients with NRCD meeting the earlier-described criteria were seen from a total of 603 patients with CD (19%), however, among patients for whom we provided primary specialist care the incidence of NRCD was 10% (P < .001). Gluten exposure was the most common cause of NRCD (36%), followed by irritable bowel syndrome (22%), refractory CD (10%), lactose intolerance (8%), and microscopic colitis (6%). The mean immunoglobulin A tissue transglutaminase level in the gluten-exposed group was 67 vs 17 U/mL (normal, <20) for other diagnoses (P < .05). Weight loss and male sex were highly predictive of refractory CD (P < .05 and < .001, respectively). CONCLUSIONS: NRCD is a common phenomenon affecting 10%-19% of celiac patients. A limited number of etiologies account for the majority of cases. Clinical factors may be used to guide evaluation.},

The only accepted treatment for coeliac disease is lifelong adherence to a strict gluten-free diet (GFD). Individuals' ability to adhere to the GFD varies, but systematic studies guiding the assessment of adherence are currently lacking. AIM: We sought to compare the predictive value of self-report and four serologic tests compared to expert nutritionist evaluation. METHODS: In all, 154 individual adults with biopsy-proven coeliac disease rated their adherence to the GFD on a Likert scale. Serum antibody titres of IgA anti-tissue transglutaminase, and IgA and IgG anti-deamidated gliadin peptides were determined. Using anova and ROC analyses, results were compared to a standardized evaluation by an expert nutritionist blinded to the participants' self-rated adherence and serology results. RESULTS: All serologic measures as well as participant reported adherence were significantly associated with GFD adherence as assessed by expert nutritionist evaluation. However, on ROC analysis no measure performed satisfactorily. The performance of serologic testing, but not self-report, improved with increased time on the GFD. CONCLUSION: Although current serologic tests have very high sensitivities and specificities for the diagnosis of coeliac disease, they cannot replace trained nutritionist evaluation in the assessment of GFD adherence.},

The purpose of this study was to determine factors influencing gluten-free diet adherence in adults with celiac disease. METHODS: A questionnaire was developed and administered to 154 adults with celiac disease who then underwent a standardized gluten-free diet evaluation by an experienced nutritionist. Multivariate analysis was conducted to determine factors associated with adherence level. RESULTS: Thirteen factors hypothesized to contribute to gluten-free diet adherence were found to be significantly associated with improved adherence including: understanding of the gluten-free diet, membership of a celiac disease advocacy group, and perceived ability to maintain adherence despite travel or changes in mood or stress (P < 0.001). CONCLUSIONS: This study identified specific factors correlated with gluten-free diet adherence. These results provide a foundation for the design of educational interventions to improve adherence.},

   abstract = {OBJECTIVE: Coeliac disease (CD), an autoimmune gluten-dependent enteropathy, can be associated with several extra-intestinal manifestations, including neurological disorders. At present, no data are available on the presence of hearing loss disorder in coeliac patients. The aim of the present study was to investigate the prevalence of hearing loss in coeliac patients compared with that in healthy controls. MATERIAL AND METHODS: Twenty-four adult coeliac patients and 24 healthy subjects matched for gender, age, smoking and drinking habits were enrolled in the study. Among the coeliac patients, 6 were newly diagnosed and 18 patients were on a gluten-free diet for at least one year. RESULTS: A hearing loss was found in 10 (47.1%) coeliac patients and 2 (9.1%) healthy controls. All CD patients with hearing loss presented a sensorineural hearing loss. The prevalence of hearing loss was significantly higher in coeliac patients than in healthy controls (p = 0.01) but it was not significantly different between untreated (33.3%) and treated (44.4%) coeliac patients (p: NS). CONCLUSIONS: Despite the low number of subjects evaluated, the present study showed a higher prevalence of hearing loss in coeliac patients than in healthy controls, suggesting an association between CD and hearing loss. Immunological processes such as ear-specific and non-specific autoantibodies and vasculitis could be the basis of this association. Further longitudinal investigations on a larger sample size will be necessary to confirm the present data.},

   abstract = {BACKGROUND & AIMS: Accurate histopathology of endoscopic duodenal biopsy specimens is critical in the diagnosis of celiac disease (CD) but sampling error and poor quality specimens may generate a false-negative result. Confocal endomicroscopy (CEM) is a novel technology allowing real-time in vivo microscopy of the mucosa that may diagnose CD and evaluate its severity and response to treatment more accurately than histopathology. METHODS: Subjects with CD and controls prospectively underwent CEM. Features of villous atrophy and crypt hypertrophy were defined. A CEM score measuring CD severity was devised and validated against the diagnosis of CD and blinded histopathology. Receiver operator characteristics, sensitivity to change after treatment, and reliability of findings were assessed. RESULTS: From 31 patients (6 untreated CD, 11 treated CD, and 14 controls), 7019 CEM images paired with 326 biopsy specimens were obtained. The accuracy of CEM in diagnosing CD was excellent (receiver operator characteristics area under the curve, 0.946; sensitivity, 94%, specificity, 92%) and correlated well with the Marsh grading (R-squared, 0.756). CEM differentiated CD from controls (P < .0001) and was sensitive to change after treatment with gluten-free diet (1787 optical biopsies; P = .012). The intraclass correlation of reliability was high (0.759-0.916). Of the 17 cases with diagnosed CD, 16 (94%) were diagnosed correctly using CEM but only 13 (76%) had detectable histopathology changes. The procedure was safe and well-tolerated. CONCLUSIONS: CEM effectively diagnoses and evaluates CD severity in vivo. This promising technique has the potential to improve endoscopy efficiency.},

   abstract = {INTRODUCTION: Patients with primary Sjogren's syndrome (pSS) are reported to have a variety of gastrointestinal symptoms partly attributed to an overrepresentation of celiac disease. We have observed that irritable bowel syndrome (IBS)-like symptoms are frequent complaints in this patient group. Allergic manifestations to various drugs are also common in pSS. A role of food allergy in IBS has been proposed. OBJECTIVE: This study is aimed at evaluating the mucosal response to rectal challenge with cow's milk protein (CM) in patients with pSS and relates possible CM reactivity to their intestinal symptoms. METHODS: A rectal challenge with CM was performed in 21 patients with pSS and 18 healthy controls. Fifteen hours after challenge the mucosal production of nitric oxide (NO) and the release of myeloperoxidase (MPO) as signs of mucosal inflammatory reaction were measured using the mucosal patch technique. RESULTS: Eight out of 21 patients with pSS had a definite increase of mucosal NO synthesis and the luminal release of MPO after rectal CM challenge. This sign of milk sensitivity was not linked to IgG/IgA antibodies to milk proteins. The symptoms for IBS according to Rome III criteria were fulfilled in 13 patients. All patients who were CM sensitive suffered from IBS. In a small open study, patients reactive to CM reported an improvement of intestinal symptoms on a CM-free diet. CONCLUSION: A rectal mucosal inflammatory response after CM challenge is seen in 38% of patients with pSS as a sign of CM sensitivity. IBS-like symptoms were common in pSS, linked to CM sensitivity.},

   abstract = {Wheat gliadin induces severe intestinal symptoms and small-bowel mucosal damage in coeliac disease patients. At present, the only effective treatment for the disease is a strict life-long gluten-free diet. In this study we investigated whether probiotics Lactobacillus fermentum or Bifidobacterium lactis can inhibit the toxic effects of gliadin in intestinal cell culture conditions. The ability of live probiotics to inhibit peptic-tryptic digested gliadin-induced damage to human colon cells Caco-2 was evaluated by measuring epithelial permeability by transepithelial resistance, actin cytoskeleton arrangements by the extent of membrane ruffling and expression of tight junctional protein ZO-1. B. lactis inhibited the gliadin-induced increase dose-dependently in epithelial permeability, higher concentrations completely abolishing the gliadin-induced decrease in transepithelial resistance. The same bacterial strain also inhibited the formation of membrane ruffles in Caco-2 cells induced by gliadin administration. Furthermore, it also protected the tight junctions of Caco-2 cells against the effects of gliadin, as evinced by the pattern of ZO-1 expression. We conclude thus that live B. lactis bacteria can counteract directly the harmful effects exerted by coeliac-toxic gliadin and would clearly warrant further studies of its potential as a novel dietary supplement in the treatment of coeliac disease.},

   abstract = {Coeliac disease is an autoimmune-mediated disorder with both innate and adaptive immune components. The disease is triggered by dietary gluten, which provokes the development of a massive immune reaction leading to the destruction of the small-intestinal mucosal morphology and intestinal dysfunction. Besides the typical small-bowel symptoms extraintestinal manifestations may also arise in a subset of coeliac disease patients. In addition, gluten evokes the production of antibodies mainly targeting deamidated gluten peptides or transglutaminase 2. Although coeliac disease has traditionally been regarded as a T cell-mediated disorder, this review discusses the role of the gluten-induced disease-specific anti-transglutaminase 2-autoantibodies in the pathogenesis of the disease.},

   abstract = {INTRODUCTION: Gliadin proteins play a key role in the pathogenesis of celiac disease; however, as a screen for celiac disease, anti-gliadin antibody testing has been replaced by the more sensitive and specific serological assays for transglutaminase autoantibodies (TGAA). A new generation of anti-gliadin antibody assays has been developed to detect synthetic, deamidated homologous gliadin peptides (DGP) with high sensitivity and specificity. METHODS: Sera were collected prospectively from children with an increased risk for celiac disease as part of an ongoing study at Denver, and studied for the development of celiac autoimmunity. We investigated the high-performance DGP antibody assay in 50 TGAA-positive children both before the development of celiac autoimmunity and following the institution of a gluten-free diet to determine the relationship of DGP antibodies to TGAA. TGAA were measured by an in-house radioassay. RESULTS: DGP antibodies and TGAA parallel each other over the period of years children were studied. DGP antibodies resolved sooner than TGAA in subjects on a gluten-free diet. DGP antibodies appeared earlier than TGAA in 9 children. CONCLUSIONS: Measuring DGP antibodies may be more useful than TGAA in monitoring children on a gluten-free diet. DGP antibodies can precede the appearance of TGAA in some at-risk children.},

   abstract = {Patients with celiac disease are sensitive to the gluten fractions of wheat. Symptoms include gastrointestinal problems and a failure to thrive in children, but may range from headaches to general malaise in adults. Thus, it is difficult to diagnose celiac disease by symptoms alone. The standard diagnostic criteria include the presence of the characteristic anti-gliadin or anti-tissue transglutaminase antibodies (anti-tTG) in serum, flattened mucosa on intestinal biopsy, and improved symptoms on a gluten-free diet. Because of the ease of use of the tTG enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay (ELISA) compared to endomysial by indirect immunofluorescence assay, there has been much more screening for celiac disease in recent years. This increased screening showed that celiac disease was more prevalent than previously believed. We compared a new multiplex assay that includes a novel form of deamidated gliadin and recombinant human tTG as the antigens to other assays using standard antigens. In addition, the new assay detects the presence of selective IgA deficiency, which shows a 10-fold increase in prevalence in patients with celiac disease compared to the general population. The combination of sensitivity and specificity of the new multiplex assay was equal or better than those for standard assays. Thus the performance, ease of use, and ability to measure three clinically important parameters in a single test make the new multiplex assay a viable alternative to standard assays in a clinical lab.},

   abstract = {Coeliac disease may have an ancient history dating back to the 1st and 2nd centuries AD. The first clear description was given by Samuel Gee in 1888. He suggested that dietary treatment might be of benefit. In the early 20th century various diets were tried, with some success, but without clear recognition of the toxic components. The doctoral thesis of Wim Dicke of 1950 established that exclusion of wheat, rye and oats from the diet led to dramatic improvement. The toxicity was shown to be a protein component, referred to as gluten. Dicke's colleagues, Weijers and Van de Kamer, showed that measurement of stool fat reflected the clinical condition. Early studies were in children but stool fat measurements documented that the condition could be recognised in adults. Histological abnormalities of the lining of the small intestine were demonstrated beyond doubt by Paulley in 1954 and techniques of per-oral biopsy described by Royer in 1955 and Shiner in 1956 afforded reliable diagnosis. Concurrence in monozygotic twins suggested a genetic component, confirmed by studies of HLA antigens. Additional, non-genetic factors seem likely. Circulating antibodies suggest an immunological mechanism of damage and provide non-invasive screening tests. Lymphoma, adenocarcinoma and ulceration of the small intestine and a range of immunological disorders are associated. A relationship with dermatitis herpetiformis was suggested by Samman in 1955 and established by Shuster and Marks in 1965 and 1968. The Coeliac Society (now Coeliac UK) was founded in 1968 and similar societies now exist across the world. They provide an extremely valuable service. Present problems include definition of the tolerated levels of gluten, whether oats are toxic for some or all coeliacs and the likelihood that the condition is relatively common and frequently without classical symptoms. Hope for the future is that more convenient methods of treatment will follow better understanding.},

   abstract = {BACKGROUND AND AIMS: In the past 20 years, a growing proportion of new cases of celiac disease (CD) are diagnosed in adults and in patients with extraintestinal manifestations. Our understanding of the extremely wide spectra of manifestations and the profound effects on elderly patients is improving. Nevertheless, CD is still underdiagnosed in elderly patients. In this study, we describe a case series of CD patients diagnosed after the age of 60. METHODS: A retrospective chart review was preformed in cases of CD diagnosed after the age of 60. Patients were included if they had positive serology and histologic findings compatible with CD. Eligible patients were reinterviewed, and demographic, clinical, and laboratory information were recorded. RESULTS: During the study period, 7 patients with CD diagnosed after the age of 60 were identified. The most common presenting findings were weight loss, iron deficiency anemia, and diarrhea. Two patients suffered from severe early osteoperosis and 2 additional patients had elevated liver function tests. Neurologic manifestation was suspected in 3 cases. Two female patients presented with cognitive decline that was attributed to Alzheimer dementia but ameliorated after the initiation of gluten-free diet. The third patient had peripheral neuropathy that completely resolved after the initiation of gluten-free diet. Median lag in diagnosis was 8 years. Diet treatment led to complete resolution of symptoms in most cases and a significant weight gain (median 7.75 kg, range 5 to 11). One patient developed a fatal intestinal T-cell lymphoma. CONCLUSIONS: In this case series, we have described several cases of CD in patients over the age of 60 with a varied spectrum of manifestations. We have also found a significant lag in diagnosis and treatment. We believe that it is important to promote the identification of CD as a possible culprit in varied clinical conditions in the elderly population.},

   abstract = {There has been growing recognition of a changing clinical presentation of celiac disease (CD), with the manifestation of milder symptoms. Serologic testing is widely used to screen patients with suspected CD and populations at risk. The aim of this retrospective analysis was to evaluate the clinical presentation of CD in childhood, assess the diagnostic value of serologic tests, and investigate the impact of IgA deficiency on diagnostic accuracy. We evaluated 206 consecutive children with suspected CD on the basis of clinical symptoms and positive serology results. Ninety-four (46%) had biopsy-proven CD. The median age at diagnosis of CD was 6.8 years; 15% of the children were <2 years of age. There was a higher incidence of CD in girls (p = 0.003). Iron deficiency and intestinal complaints were more frequent in children with CD than those without CD (61% vs. 33%, p = 0.0001 and 71% vs. 55%, p = 0.02, respectively), while failure to thrive was less common (35% vs. 53%, p = 0.02). The sensitivity of IgA tissue transglutaminase (IgA-tTG) was 0.98 when including all children and 1.00 after excluding children with selective IgA deficiency. The specificity of IgA-tTG was 0.73 using the recommended cut-off value of 20 IU, and this improved to 0.94 when using a higher cut-off value of 100 IU. All children with CD and relative IgA deficiency (IgA levels that are measurable but below the age reference [n = 8]) had elevated IgA-tTG. In conclusion, CD is frequently diagnosed in school-age children with relatively mild symptoms. The absence of intestinal symptoms does not preclude the diagnosis of CD; many children with CD do not report intestinal symptoms. While the sensitivity of IgA-tTG is excellent, its specificity is insufficient for the diagnostic confirmation of a disease requiring life-long dietary restrictions. Children with negative IgA-tTG and decreased but measurable IgA values are unlikely to have CD.},

   abstract = {The selective CB1 receptor antagonist rimonabant is a novel weight control agent. Although CB1 receptors and binding sites are present in both the rodent central and peripheral nervous systems, including the afferent vagus nerve, the role of gut afferents in mediating anorexia following CB1R blockade is still debated. In the present study we examined rimonabant-induced anorexia in male C57BL/6J mice with subdiaphragmatic vagotomy (VGX) as well as in male Sprague-Dawley rats subjected to either subdiaphragmatic vagal deafferentation (SDA) alone or in combination with a complete celiac-superior mesenteric ganglionectomy (CGX). Irrespective of the operational procedure, rimonabant (10mg/kg) effectively reduced standard chow as well as palatable diet (ensure) intake. In conclusion, the data clearly demonstrate that neither vagal gut afferents, nor gut afferents traveling via the sympathetic nervous system, are required for rimonabant to inhibit food intake leading to the hypothesis that centrally located CB1 receptors are the prime mediators of rimonabant-induced anorexia.},

   abstract = {Coeliac disease, daily more frequently diagnosed in our population, involves many organs also in oligosymptomatic patients and with an adequate nutritional regime. Possible endocrine implications include failure to thrive, pubertal delay and reproduction diseases due to deregulation of GH, FSH and LH secretion. Leptin, an adipose tissue hormone, can be decreased as well and its deficiency could be related to growth and puberty anomalies. We studied 14 asymptomatic coeliac patients in peripubertal age (7.5-13.8 years) and tested their leptin levels in order to correlate them with endocrine and anthropometric data. Before the diet was started leptinaemia (M+/-DS) was: 4.94+/-5.53 ng/ml. In 10/14 patients (71%) leptinaemia was<or=2 DS for gender and age. In all the patients, after a period of 6-12 months of gluten-free diet, Leptin levels appreciably raised to 10.8+/-7.9 ng/ml, with a significant correlation to the time of the diet. Leptinaemia was actually lower in patients with a severe mucosal atrophy, and in these patients it increased more significantly after the diet was started. The removal of gluten itself may reduce immunological hit to adipose tissue and the 'malnutrition' of adipocytes: leptin can hence increase despite no significant increase of body mass index occurs. This study could partially explain the correlation between body mass index, Coeliac disease and the deregulation of puberty and fertility, mainly in patients who started the diet late. It could also explain the reversibility of this alteration if the cause is removed.},

Patients with nonresponsive celiac disease underwent capsule endoscopy, and concordance between endoscopy and histology was then calculated using the kappa statistic. In 19 patients, endoscopy videos were reported as normal in ten (53%) case, as having mild changes in three (16%) cases, and as having moderate-severe changes in six (31%) cases. Two (11%) had acute ulcers. No small bowel tumors were seen. Endoscopy demonstrated concordance with histological changes in 14 of the 18 patients with histology available (78% concordance). The kappa statistic suggested a substantial degree of concordance between histology and endoscopic findings. Endoscopy with distal duodenal biopsies is superior to VCE in detecting proximal, nonresponsive celiac disease, but more distal lesions may be missed such that the strength of VCE lies in its ability to visualize the entire small bowel.},

Without any signs of DLBCL recurrence, he suddenly developed gastrointestinal symptoms and subcutaneous masses after resuming a gluten-containing diet. Peripheral T-cell lymphoma (PTCL) was diagnosed. Although a complete response was seen for 8 months, he was later admitted again with pleural and pericardial effusion due to PTCL. Expression of cytotoxic molecules, CCR4 and CXCR4 were all confirmed in PTCL cells, and the patient died soon afterwards. Clinically speaking, even though no gastrointestinal symptoms were seen, a gluten-free diet should have been strongly recommended for this patient.},

   abstract = {Celiac disease is a lifelong autoimmune intestinal disorder caused by sensitivity to gluten. In clinical practice, no causal treatment is currently available and the disease can only be treated by strict adherence to a gluten-free diet. The disease that was known in ancient Greece continues to draw attention of the professional public worldwide and has been studied by many researchers. As a result, a range of theoretical and practical knowledge has been obtained and thus further aspects of the disease can be addressed. At present the discussion is open not only to doctors, pharmacists, scientists and researchers at various posts, but also to economists, lawyers and managers. In the spectrum of disease manifestations, some new forms were diagnosed, including associations with other diseases. Therefore, a higher prevalence of this disease has been reported. Multiple review articles appeared in both the local and international literature to familiarize the professional public with the symptoms and signs of the disease. Their common aim was to contribute to the detection of the disease in children and adults. Despite that, the disease remains underdiagnosed. In this context, new challenges emerge in the field of celiac disease. The current practice in diagnosing celiac disease and the available and candidate dietary interventions for effective protection and support therapy are described. The importance of early screening and advanced approaches to disease management is underlined.},

Treatment relies on eviction of gluten (wheat, barley, rye). Gluten-free diet allows prevention of malignant complications and osteopenia. The main cause of resistance to gluten-free diet is its bad observance.

   abstract = {BACKGROUND AND AIMS: While severe villous atrophy (SVA) is the most typical histological feature in adult celiac disease (ACD), partial villous atrophy (PVA) is now also frequently found. So far, the impact of the severity of villous atrophy on the clinical presentation of ACD has been scarcely investigated. We aimed to compare the clinical, biological and immune features and outcomes in ACD patients presenting with PVA at diagnosis versus patients with SVA. PATIENTS AND METHODS: Medical files of 48 patients with ACD diagnosed between 1992 and 2003 were retrospectively studied. The diagnosis was based on the presence of intestinal villous atrophy, with increases in intraepithelial lymphocytes and circulating celiac specific antibodies. Villous atrophy was classified as severe (subtotal and total) or partial. Symptoms, biological signs of malabsorption, immune markers, bone mineral density at diagnosis and response to gluten-free diet were recorded. RESULTS: At diagnosis, ten patients (four M/six F) had PVA and 38 patients (five M/33 F) had SVA, with a median age of 54 and 33 years, respectively (p<0.05). Positivity for specific antibodies, HLA typing and frequency of autoimmune disease at diagnosis were similar in both PVA and SVA patients, as was their response to gluten-free diet. Diarrhea, malabsorption syndrome and osteopenia were independent of the degree of villous atrophy. CONCLUSION: PVA was observed in 21% of patients with ACD. Except for their older age at diagnosis, patients with PVA presented with similar clinical, biological and immune characteristics and outcomes as did patients with SVA.},

   abstract = {Celiac disease (CD) is a chronic immune-mediated gluten-dependent enteropathy induced by ingestion of gluten-containing products, characterized by intestinal malabsorption and subtotal or total atrophy of intestinal villi, which improves after gluten-free diet (GFD). Untreated patients affected by the classic form of CD are at high risk of malnutrition, but an impairment of nutritional status is frequently reported also in patients with the subclinical form of the disease. Strict adherence to a GFD greatly improves nutritional status, inducing an increase in fat and bone compartments, but does not completely normalize body composition. A lack of improvement in nutritional status may identify incomplete adherence to GFD treatment. Evidence has shown lower body weights and lower fat mass and fat-free mass contents in CD patients. Untreated CD patients oxidize more carbohydrates as energy substrate compared to treated subjects. In addition, circulating ghrelin concentration was reduced after GFD treatment as a possible consequence of body composition improvement, while leptin did not correlate with the changes in body composition and substrate oxidation in patients with CD. A significant correlation was reported between ghrelin and the degree of severity of intestinal mucosal lesions. CD patients might show an alteration in lipid metabolism, i.e. low serum total and high- density lipoprotein-cholesterol as a consequence of lipid malabsorption and decreased intake. In conclusion, weight loss and nutritional deficiencies are relevant clinical features in CD. Thus, an early and accurate evaluation of nutritional status and energy metabolism represents a fundamental tool in the management of CD patients.},

DATA SOURCES: Published articles identified through Medline using search terms such as celiac disease, gluten sensitivity, and gluten enteropathy. Additional resources were identified from personal bibliographies collected by the authors and bibliographies from gathered articles. DATA SYNTHESIS: Celiac disease is an autoimmune disorder that is characterized by intolerance to gluten and affects approximately 3 million Americans. Although the most common manifestations of the disease are gastrointestinal, including diarrhea, steatorrhea, and weight loss, the disease is a multisystem disorder. Malabsorption is common, often leading to vitamin and mineral deficiencies and resulting in anemia and osteoporosis. Diagnosis is initiated through serology testing and confirmed by intestinal biopsy. The only treatment for celiac disease is strict, lifelong adherence to a gluten-free diet, which includes avoidance of foods, prescription and nonprescription pharmaceutical products, and cosmetics containing wheat, barley, and rye. Adherence to the gluten-free diet will promote intestinal healing and symptom relief and usually prevent complications of celiac disease. CONCLUSION: Pharmacists can play an important role by identifying patients who may have celiac disease, providing information for gluten-free foods and pharmaceutical products, and encouraging adherence to the gluten-free diet.},

   abstract = {Diarrhea and weight loss are common after pancreaticoduodenectomy, and arise from varying etiologies. An uncommon but important cause for these symptoms is the postoperative activation of silent celiac disease. We sought to describe the clinical presentation, diagnosis, treatment, and follow-up of a series of patients with silent celiac disease unmasked after pancreaticoduodenectomy, and to summarize the existing case reports on this association. A search of the electronic medical record at our institution was performed cross-referencing terms associated with celiac disease and pancreaticoduodenectomy for the years 1976-2004. Cases were then reviewed to ensure that no signs or symptoms attributable to celiac disease were present preoperatively. Seven patients were identified; five were male, and the median age was 56. All patients underwent surgery for a presumed pancreatic or ampullary malignancy. Six patients developed symptoms ultimately attributable to celiac disease immediately after pancreaticoduodenectomy, most commonly diarrhea and weight loss. A single patient had silent celiac disease incidentally diagnosed at pancreaticoduodenectomy that remained silent postoperatively on an unrestricted diet. Symptoms completely resolved in 4 of 6 patients after initiation of a gluten-free diet, with partial improvement in the remaining 2 patients. The median delay from pancreaticoduodenectomy to diagnosis of celiac disease in the 6 symptomatic patients was 6 months. Clinicians should consider celiac disease as a potential diagnosis in patients with failure to thrive and diarrhea after pancreaticoduodenectomy. This entity is uncommon, but may be under-recognized. The underlying mechanism may relate to an increased antigenic load secondary to postsurgical changes in intestinal physiology.},

   abstract = {Recurrent abdominal pain (RAP), surely one of the most frequent causes of medical intervention, is frequently present in many gastrointestinal disease. Usually no structural and/or biochemical alterations can be demonstrated. This condition is, therefore, considered to be due to functional disorders such as irritable bowel syndrome (IBS) or functional dyspepsia. Previous observations suggest the presence of a rare alteration of celiac vessels among the possible causes of RAP. This pathological condition was known as Dunbar syndrome. We report 2 cases of chronic abdominal pain. The former reported weight loss and the latter anemia with iron deficiency. It is remarkable that patients with initial diagnosis of IBS can be affected by celiac disease (CD), which is the cause of their abdominal pain. Our patients were tested for CD; the former was negative and IBS was diagnosed, the latter was positive and a gluten free diet was prescribed. The presence of an epigastric bruit, accentuated during expiration, suggested a possible vascular alteration known as tripod celiac artery compression syndrome. Duplex Doppler sonography suggests the diagnosis of celiac arterial constriction due the diaphragmatic ligament. These cases show that tripod celiac artery compression syndrome might be a cause of RAP and that it may be evaluated and investigated when the clinical examination discloses an abdominal systolic bruit.},

   abstract = {Dermatitis herpetiformis (DH) is an autoimmune blistering skin disorder that is associated with intestinal gluten sensitivity. Epidermal transglutaminase (TGe) and closely related tissue transglutaminase (tTG) are considered to be autoantigens in DH, because a majority of DH patients have IgA specific for TGe and for tTG. It is unknown where and how these autoantigen-specific IgAs are generated in DH. Results reported in this paper on nine DH patients on a gluten containing diet demonstrate that the levels of circulating anti-tTG IgA and anti-TGe IgA in DH are correlated with each other and that both appear to be correlated with the degree (extent) of enteropathy. An analysis of 15 untreated celiac sprue (CS) patients demonstrated that approximately 33% of CS patients had elevated levels of anti-TGe IgA. These results would indicate that intestinal damage is associated with the production of anti-tTG IgA and anti-TGe IgA in DH patients.},

   abstract = {Due to its high prevalence, celiac disease is a major health problem. Because of the long-term complications and difficulty of diagnosing this disease, the need for population-based screening has been raised. Serological methods for detection of celiac disease include antiendomysial and antitransglutaminase antibody detection, which has high sensitivity and specificity (nearly 100%) in forms with atrophy and low sensitivity and specificity (between 15 and 30%) in patients with minimal lesions, thus posing diagnostic difficulties in this group of individuals. The risk of late complications is unknown in this group of patients with lymphocytic enteritis. However, this group may be just as symptomatic as patients with atrophy and consequently would also benefit from a gluten-free diet. Systematic screening allows a greater number of patients with gluten-sensitive enteropathy to be detected. However, there are insufficient data to be able to evaluate the economic and social impact of systematic screening.},

The classic form is much more frequent in children. Thereby there has been a misevaluation and improper treatment of coeliac disease in adults who suffer more from asymptomatica and atypical forms. Currently the only effective treatment is a strict gluten free diet for life. However recent researches brought a new light on the matter. Now oats as a causative factor is controvertial. The introduction of some moderate intestinal lesions (pre-atrophic with intra-epithelial hyperlymphocytosis qualified as "weak enteropathies") in the definition of coeliac disease might be possible. Moreover the way to diagnose has evolved as serological tests and markers are more used due to their efficiency.},

   abstract = {PURPOSE: To review the epidemiology, pathophysiology, clinical presentation, diagnosis, and management of celiac disease (CD). DATA SOURCES: Review of literature using Pub Med and Access Medicine. The following search terms were used: celiac disease, malabsorption syndromes, diarrhea, and gluten-free diet (GFD). There was no limitation placed on publication year. Only articles written in English were included. CONCLUSIONS: CD is a chronic systemic autoimmune disorder triggered in genetically susceptible individuals by the ingestion of gluten proteins (wheat, barley, and rye). CD often presents atypically, and diagnosis delays are common. Currently, the only effective treatment for CD is strict adherence to a GFD. This is a difficult diet to comprehend and follow. Adherence to a GFD requires ongoing education and support from a multidisciplinary healthcare team, support groups, family, and friends. IMPLICATIONS FOR PRACTICE: Once considered a rare disease of childhood, CD is now recognized as a common disorder that can occur at any age. Clinicians need to be cognizant of risk factors, clinical manifestations, conditions, and complications associated with CD in order to make a timely diagnosis, ameliorate symptoms, and minimize disease complications.},

   abstract = {OBJECTIVES: To investigate the evolution of IgA and IgG autoantibodies against tissue transglutaminase (tTGase) in celiac patients on gluten-free diet (GFD). METHODS: IgA and IgG anti-tTGAse autoantibodies was evaluated in 93 patients (58 girls and 35 boys; mean age 3.56 +/- 3.04 years; range 0.94-17.5 years) at diagnosis of celiac disease and after 1, 2, 4, 6, 12, 18, 24 months of follow-up on GFD. Autoantibodies were measured with a radioassay using in vitro transcribed-translated human recombinant tTGAse, and immune complexes were precipitated with protein A- or anti-IgA-agarose for IgG and IgA, respectively. RESULTS: Autoantibody titers started to decline very soon after removal of gluten, and no significant differences in the decrease rate between IgG and IgA antibodies were observed. After 6 months on GFD, 63 and 49% of the patients were negative for IgG and IgA, respectively. Patients who remained autoantibody-positive after 6 months of treatment initially presented with significantly higher titers at the time of diagnosis compared to patients that had lost their antibodies by that time. Children diagnosed before the age of two years presented lower autoantibody titers, while patients positive for HLA-DR7 had higher anti-tTGase levels, especially IgA. CONCLUSIONS: There are no differences in the performance of IgG and IgA class autoantibodies in the evolution of celiac patients. Between 3 and 6 months on GFD, almost half of the patients are negative for anti-tTGase antibodies. In our experience, they can be of help in evaluating compliance with diet, at least during the first two years of treatment.},

To address this question, a retrospective analysis of the clinical and biological status of adult coeliac patients diagnosed in childhood, who remained on a normal diet after gluten challenge and were clinically silent, was carried out. METHODS: Patients aged 18-65 years with CD diagnosed in childhood were included. Clinical status, gluten intake, biological parameters of malabsorption, bone mineral density, human leucocyte antigen (HLA) genotype, serological markers of CD, and histological and immunohistochemical parameters in duodenal biopsies were recorded. RESULTS: Sixty-one patients had resumed a normal diet and were asymptomatic. Forty-eight showed different degrees of villous atrophy (silent CD), while 13 had no detectable atrophy (latent CD) on duodenal biopsies. Latent CD patients had significantly less osteopenia/osteoporosis (1/9 (11%) vs 23/33 (70%), p<0.001)), and lower T cell receptor (TCR) alphabeta+ intraepithelial T cell counts (38+/-20 vs 55+/-15, p<0.01) than silent CD patients. The mean age at diagnosis and first GFD was lower in latent than in silent patients (14.4+/-5 vs 40.1+/-47 months, p<0.05). Latent patients did not differ significantly from the seven control patients on a long-term GFD, except for a higher frequency of CD-specific serum antibodies. However, two latent patients relapsed clinically and histologically during subsequent follow-up. CONCLUSIONS: Long-term latency developed in about 20% of CD patients who remained symptom free after gluten reintroduction. This latency can be transient and thus a regular follow-up is mandatory. In silent patients, the increased risk of osteoporosis substantiates the need for a GFD.},

   abstract = {Bone health, characterized by its mass, density, and micro-architectural qualities, is maintained by a balanced system of remodeling. The lack of these qualities, caused by an uncoupling of the remodeling process, leads to bone fragility and an increased risk for fracture. The prime regulator of bone remodeling is the RANK/RANKL/OPG system. The common origin of both bone and immune stem cells is the key to understanding this system and its relationship to the transcription factor nuclear factor kappaB in bone loss and inflammation. Via this coupled osteo-immune relationship, a catabolic environment from heightened proinflammatory cytokine expression and/or a chronic antigen-induced activation of the immune system can initiate a switch-like diversion of osteoprogenitor-cell differentiation away from monocyte-macrophage and osteoblast cell formation and toward osteoclast and adipocyte formation. This disruption in bone homeostasis leads to increased fragility. Dietary and specific nutrient interventions can reduce inflammation and limit this diversion. Common laboratory biomarkers can be used to assess changes in body metabolism that affect bone health. This literature review offers practical information for applying effective strategic nutrition to fracture-risk individuals while monitoring metabolic change through serial testing of biomarkers. As examples, the clinician may recommend vitamin K and potassium to reduce hypercalciuria, _-lipoic acid and N-acetylcysteine to reduce the bone resorption marker N-telopeptide (N-Tx), and dehydroepiandrosterone (DHEA), whey, and milk basic protein (the basic protein fraction of whey) to increase insulin-like growth factor-1 (IGF-1) and create a more anabolic profile.},

   abstract = {BACKGROUND: The aim of this study was to retrospectively examine how positive IgA-endomysial antibody (EMA) test results for celiac disease were being interpreted and acted on by physicians in the Calgary Health Region. METHODS: We reviewed consecutive EMA test results, with or without a serum IgA, obtained during a 17-month period. Seropositive tests were cross-referenced to the surgical database to determine the number of patients who underwent intestinal biopsy and the results of the biopsy. We sent questionnaires to the ordering physicians of positive tests with no record of intestinal biopsy. RESULTS: Among 11,716 EMA tests in 9533 patients, 349 results were positive in 313 patients (3%). Intestinal biopsies were performed in 218 (70%) of the seropositive patients; 194 of them were diagnostic of celiac disease. Celiac disease was also found in 10 EMA-negative patients. Of the 109 positive tests performed in 95 patients with no subsequent biopsy, 28 had appropriate indications to not perform a biopsy; the most common reason being that the test had been ordered to follow up on a previous biopsy-proven diagnosis of celiac disease (n = 21). For 33 other positive test results without a subsequent biopsy, management appeared to be inappropriate, most commonly (n = 21) because of a recommendation to follow a gluten-free diet despite lack of a tissue diagnosis of celiac disease. For the remaining 48 positive EMA results, administrative issues prevented evaluation (n = 19), the patients refused further evaluation (n = 11), or physician surveys were not returned (n = 18). CONCLUSIONS: Celiac disease affected 2% of patients, with a similar prevalence in male and female patients. Most positive EMA tests (77%) were appropriately managed by physicians. Beginning a gluten-free diet without biopsy or failing to follow up on a positive EMA test remain common errors of management.},

   abstract = {BACKGROUND: Coeliac disease (CD) is an enteropathy characterized by an aberrant immune response to cereal-gluten proteins. Although gluten peptides and microorganisms activate similar pro-inflammatory pathways, the role the intestinal microbiota may play in this disorder is unknown. The purpose of this study was to assess whether the faecal microbiota of coeliac patients could contribute to the pro-inflammatory milieu characteristic of CD and the possible benefits of bifidobacteria. METHODS: The effect of faeces of 26 CD patients with active disease (mean age 5.5 years, range 2.1-12.0 years), 18 symptom-free coeliac disease (SFCD) patients (mean age 5.5 years, range 1.0-12.3 years) on a gluten-free diet for 1-2 years; and 20 healthy children (mean age 5.3 years, range 1.8-10.8 years) on induction of cytokine production and surface antigen expression in peripheral blood mononuclear cells (PBMCs) were determined. The possible regulatory roles of Bifidobacterium longum ES1 and B. bifidum ES2 co-incubated with faecal samples were also assessed in vitro. RESULTS: Faeces of both active CD and SFCD patients, representing an imbalanced microbiota, significantly increased TNF-alpha production and CD86 expression in PBMCs, while decreased IL-10 cytokine production and CD4 expression compared with control samples. Active CD-patient samples also induced significantly higher IFN-gamma production compared with controls. However, Bifidobacterium strains suppressed the pro-inflammatory cytokine pattern induced by the large intestinal content of CD patients and increased IL-10 production. Cytokine effects induced by faecal microbiota seemed to be mediated by the NFkappaB pathway. CONCLUSION: The intestinal microbiota of CD patients could contribute to the Th1 pro-inflammatory milieu characteristic of the disease, while B. longum ES1 and B. bifidum ES2 could reverse these deleterious effects. These findings hold future perspectives of interest in CD therapy.},

   abstract = {OBJECTIVE: To describe a patient with osteoporosis who was treated with alendronate and developed hypocalcemia, which ultimately led to the diagnosis of celiac sprue. METHODS: We present the clinical and laboratory findings in a patient with osteoporosis, in whom hypocalcemia developed after treatment with alendronate. This patient was subsequently diagnosed with celiac sprue. The pertinent literature regarding orally administered bisphosphonate-induced hypocalcemia is reviewed. RESULTS: A 79-year-old man who was diagnosed with osteoporosis was treated with alendronate. He was subsequently found to have asymptomatic hypocalcemia (serum calcium concentration, 8.3 mg/dL), which resolved after alendronate therapy was discontinued. He was then treated with calcium, vitamin D, and calcitonin nasal spray, which did not cause hypocalcemia. Because of his reduced bone density, however, he was subsequently referred for endocrine consultation. Evaluation at that time showed normal levels of serum calcium, phosphorus, creatinine, alkaline phosphatase, 25-hydroxyvitamin D, thyrotropin, and parathyroid hormone as well as 24-hour urine calcium excretion. An endomysial antibody titer was dramatically elevated. Upper endoscopy showed villous atrophy, and small bowel biopsy confirmed the presence of villous blunting and chronic inflammation, consistent with celiac sprue. He was treated with a gluten-free diet and then subsequently treated with orally administered risedronate, which he tolerated well without evidence of hypocalcemia. CONCLUSION: To the best of our knowledge, this is the first report of orally administered bisphosphonate-induced hypocalcemia, which subsequently led to the diagnosis of previously unrecognized, otherwise asymptomatic celiac sprue. Patients with unexplained hypocalcemia should be screened for celiac sprue, even in the absence of gastrointestinal symptoms.},

The aim of this study was to evaluate the clinical utility of measuring serum citrulline levels in a group of patients affected by coeliac disease (CD). Fifty healthy volunteers, 21 patients with untreated coeliac disease and 6 patients with refractory coeliac disease took part in the study. Serum citrulline levels and duodenal lesions were evaluated at the time of diagnosis, and after at least 24 months of gluten-free diet. Serum citrulline concentrations were determined by ion exchange chromatography. In comparison to healthy volunteers, serum citrulline concentrations were significantly lower in untreated and refractory coeliac disease patients. No significant difference was found between untreated and refractory coeliac disease patients and between patients with different patterns of clinical presentation or various degrees of duodenal lesions. After a gluten-free diet, the mean of serum citrulline concentration was increased in all but one patient. Although, as expected, serum citrulline levels turned out to be low in coeliac disease, the clinical utility of their measurement is, at least, questionable in this condition.},

   abstract = {BACKGROUND: Palmoplantar pustulosis (PPP) is a chronic inflammatory disease affecting mainly smoking women. Some patients also have psoriasis. A subgroup of patients with psoriasis has been shown to have silent gluten sensitivity with relevance for their psoriasis. Nothing is known about gluten sensitivity in PPP. OBJECTIVES: To find out whether any patients with PPP are gluten-sensitive and whether this might be relevant for the PPP activity. PATIENTS AND METHODS: One hundred and twenty-three patients (113 women) with PPP participated. Screening for IgA antibodies against gliadin and tissue transglutaminase (tTG) was performed, the duodenal mucosa in patients with and without these antibodies was studied and the effect of a gluten-free diet (GFD) was followed up. RESULTS: Twenty-two patients (18%) had IgA antibodies against gliadin and nine of 94 (10%) against tTG. Twelve patients with antibodies and 11 without underwent gastro-duodenoscopy. Four displayed villous atrophy, whereas all other specimens were judged as essentially normal at routine staining. However, with immunohistochemistry, the numbers of CD3+ and CD8+ lymphocytes in the epithelium were found to be increased in patients with any type of antibody, although they were most numerous in those with both types of antibodies. Seven of 123 patients (6%) had coeliac disease (three previously diagnosed). Patients with antibodies who adhered to the GFD displayed total or nearly total clearance of the skin lesions and normalization of the antibody levels. CONCLUSIONS: Patients with PPP should be screened for antibodies against gliadin and tTG. Those with antibodies can be much improved on a GFD regardless of the degree of mucosal abnormalities.},

   abstract = {BACKGROUND: Coeliac disease is caused by an immune response to gluten. As gluten proteins are proline rich they are resistant to enzymatic digestion in the gastrointestinal tract, a property that probably contributes to the immunogenic nature of gluten. AIMS: This study determined the efficiency of gluten degradation by a post-proline cutting enzyme, Aspergillus niger prolyl endoprotease (AN-PEP), in a dynamic system that closely mimics the human gastrointestinal tract (TIM system). METHODS: Two experiments were performed. In the first, a slice of bread was processed in the TIM system with and without co-administration of AN-PEP. In the second, a standard fast food menu was used. Samples of the digesting meals were taken from the stomach, duodenum, jejunum and ileum compartments at time zero until 4 hours after the start of the experiment. In these samples the levels of immunogenic peptides from gliadins and glutenins were assessed by monoclonal antibody-based competition assays, Western blot analysis and proliferation T-cell assays. RESULTS: AN-PEP accelerated the degradation of gluten in the stomach compartment to such an extent that hardly any gluten reached the duodenum compartment. CONCLUSION: AN-PEP is capable of accelerating the degradation of gluten in a gastrointestinal system that closely mimics in-vivo digestion. This implies that the co-administration of AN-PEP with a gluten-containing meal might eliminate gluten toxicity, thus offering patients the possibility of abandoning (occasionally) their strict gluten-free diet.},

Such immune-stimulatory peptides are found in both gliadins and glutenins. Monoclonal antibodies (mAbs) against these peptides can be used to screen food for the presence of such peptides. OBJECTIVE: We aimed to determine the specificity of 5 mAbs raised against T cell stimulatory peptides found in alpha- and gamma-gliadins and in low- and high-molecular-weight glutenins and to compare it with the specificity of patient-derived T cells. DESIGN: The reactivity of the mAbs with gluten peptides, enzymatic gluten digests, and intact gluten proteins was determined and compared with that of gluten-specific T cells by using a combination of immunologic and biochemical techniques. Furthermore, the reactivity of the mAbs with gluten homologues in barley, rye, and oat was determined. RESULTS: The specificity of the mAbs largely overlaps with that of gluten-specific T cells. Moreover, mAbs detect several homologous peptides present in gluten proteins. All except the LMW-specific mAbs also detect storage proteins present in barley and rye, whereas the gamma-gliadin-specific mAbs also recognize oat proteins. CONCLUSION: The mAbs raised against T cell stimulatory peptides in gliadins and glutenins allow a comprehensive screen for the presence of harmful gluten and gluten-like proteins and peptides in food products. They can thus be used to guarantee the safety of food for celiac disease patients.},

   abstract = {Celiac disease is a chronic enteropathy caused by permanent intolerance to gluten and similar proteins found in wheat, barley and rye. The intestinal mucosa of susceptible individuals is crossed by undigested gluten, which leads to a marked inflammatory response. The clinical features may vary from overt intestinal symptoms to silent disease. Bone health has been found to be markedly affected in children and adolescents with untreated celiac disease, regardless of clinical presentation. Bone mass measurements are greatly reduced compared to healthy youth. As indicated by surrogate markers of bone turnover, bone formation rates are depressed and bone resorption rates enhanced in untreated patients. The causes underlying alterations in bone metabolism are still under investigation, but are attributed to non-intestinal factors. Increased production of inflammatory cytokines and presence of specific autoantibodies may together disrupt bone metabolism equilibrium in children and adolescents with celiac disease. Gluten withdrawal is able to restore bone mass quite rapidly, with a normalization of levels of bone formation and bone resorption markers. Good adherence to gluten-free diet is mandatory to maintain optimal bone health. Monitoring of dietary compliance is important to ensure appropriate bone mass accrual through childhood and puberty in these patients, to maximize peak bone mass and reduce fracture risk later in life.},

   abstract = {BACKGROUND: Celiac disease is an immune-mediated enteropathy caused by the ingestion of gluten, a protein fraction found in certain cereals. Immunotoxic gluten peptides that are recalcitrant to degradation of digestive enzymes appear to trigger celiac syndromes. A 33-mer peptide from alpha-2 gliadin has been identified as a principal contributor to gluten immunotoxicity. A gluten-free diet is the usual first therapy for celiac disease patients; therefore, the characterization and quantification of the toxic portion of the gluten in foodstuffs is crucial to avoid celiac damage. OBJECTIVE: We aimed to develop immunologic assays as a novel food analysis tool for measuring cereal fractions that are immunotoxic to celiac disease patients. DESIGN: The design focused on the production of monoclonal antibodies against the gliadin 33-mer peptide and the development of enzyme-linked immunosorbent assays (ELISAs) and Western blot analysis with the use of novel antibodies. RESULTS: A sandwich ELISA method showed a detection limit for wheat, barley, and rye of <1 ppm prolamine. However, the method required a sample that was > or =1 order of magnitude greater for the detection of low-toxic oats, and there was no signal with the safe cereals maize and rice. A competitive ELISA method was also developed for detection of the toxic peptide in hydrolyzed food, which had a detection limit of <0.5 ppm gliadin. CONCLUSIONS: Both ELISAs designed for use with the toxic gliadin 33-mer peptide suggested a high correlation between the presence of the peptide and the amount of cereal that was toxic to celiac disease patients. The sensitivity was significantly higher than that of equivalent methods recognizing other gluten epitopes.},

   abstract = {BACKGROUND & AIMS: Wireless capsule endoscopy provides an opportunity to study the macroscopic features in celiac disease by providing a magnified view of the intestinal mucosa. In this study, we evaluated the following: (1) the distribution of atrophy in untreated celiac disease, (2) the correlation between extent of changes and clinical manifestations, (3) the accuracy and interobserver agreement of wireless capsule endoscopy assessment, and (4) the effect of gluten withdrawal. METHODS: Thirty-eight consecutive patients with untreated biopsy-proven celiac disease underwent wireless capsule endoscopy. Each subject was invited to undergo repeat testing after at least 6 months of gluten withdrawal. The video images of each patient were reviewed independently by 2 investigators. RESULTS: Thirty-five (92%) subjects had visible atrophy detected by capsule endoscopy. Twenty-two (59%) subjects showed an extensive enteropathy, 12 (32%) had enteropathy limited to the duodenum, and only 1 had a jejunal enteropathy. No association was shown between the extent of the lesion and clinical manifestations. Capsule endoscopy had a better overall sensitivity for the detection of atrophy as compared with upper endoscopy (92% vs 55%, P = .0005), with a specificity of 100%. The overall interobserver agreement for the 2 reviewers was relatively high (% total agreement, 86.5%). After gluten withdrawal, the extent and the pattern of atrophy improved both qualitatively and quantitatively. CONCLUSIONS: Celiac disease affects a highly variable portion of the small intestine starting at the duodenum. The extent of visible enteropathy does not explain differences in clinical presentation. Most subjects with visually detected villous atrophy showed a clinically significant improvement after gluten withdrawal.},

   abstract = {Coeliac disease is characterized by immunoglobulin-A (IgA)-class autoantibodies targeted against transglutaminase 2 (TG2), a multi-functional protein also with a role in angiogenesis. These antibodies are present in patient serum but are also found bound to TG2 below the epithelial basement membrane and around capillaries in the small intestinal mucosa. Based on these facts and the information that the mucosal vasculature of coeliac patients on a gluten-containing diet is disorganized, we studied whether the coeliac disease-specific autoantibodies targeted against TG2 would disturb angiogenesis. The effects of coeliac disease-specific autoantibodies on in vitro angiogenesis were studied in angiogenic cell cultures. The binding of the antibodies to cells, endothelial sprouting, migration of both endothelial and vascular mesenchymal cells, the integrity of the actin cytoskeleton in both cell types and the differentiation of vascular mesenchymal cells were recorded. In vitro, IgA derived from coeliac disease patients on a gluten-containing diet binds to surface TG2 on endothelial and vascular mesenchymal cells and this binding can be inhibited by the removal of TG2. In addition, coeliac disease-specific autoantibodies targeting TG2 disturb several steps of angiogenesis: endothelial sprouting and the migration of both endothelial and vascular mesenchymal cells. Furthermore, the autoantibodies cause disorganization of the actin cytoskeleton in both capillary cell types that account most probably for the defective cellular migration. We conclude that coeliac disease-specific autoantibodies recognizing TG2 inhibit angiogenesis in vitro. This disturbance of the angiogenic process could lead in vivo to the disruption of the mucosal vasculature seen in coeliac disease patients on a gluten-containing diet.},

   abstract = {BACKGROUND/AIMS: Celiac disease (CD) patients are affected in their quality of life (QoL). Our objectives were to assess differences in quality of life of patients according to the clinical presentation at diagnosis, and to determine the time-course impact of a gluten-free diet. PATIENTS/METHODS: We prospectively evaluated 132 newly diagnosed adult CD patients and 70 healthy controls using self-administered questionnaires: the Short Form-36 health survey, the Gastrointestinal Symptoms Rating Scale; the Beck Depression Inventory both, at diagnosis and at 3-, 6- and 12-months on treatment. RESULTS: At diagnosis, patients with classical symptoms (n=97) exhibited a significantly more pronounced alteration of all items of the three questionnaires than atypical/silent cases (n=35) (p<0.01 to <0.00001). Silent CD patients had even better baseline scores (p<0.05 to <0.00001). Treatment produced a substantial and rapid (3-month) improvement of most outcome measures in classical and atypical patients but not in asymptomatic cases. Both subgroups attained comparable final scores with no differences comparing strictly adherents with partially compliant. CONCLUSIONS: Atypical/silent celiac disease patients have a significantly better baseline quality of life than those with classical symptoms. Treatment induces a rapid and significant improvement in symptomatic cases but not in silent patients with all subgroups having similar 1-year scores comparable to healthy controls.},

The ingestion of gluten is responsible for the symptoms of CD, but other environmental factors are also thought to play a role in this disorder. In this study, the composition of the duodenal microbiota of coeliac children with active disease, symptom-free CD patients on a gluten-free diet and control children was determined. Bacteriological analyses of duodenal biopsy specimens were carried out by fluorescent in situ hybridization coupled with flow cytometry. The proportions of total bacteria and Gram-negative bacteria were significantly higher in CD patients with active disease than in symptom-free CD patients and controls. Bacteroides and Escherichia coli groups were significantly more abundant in CD patients with active disease than in controls, whilst these bacterial deviations were normalized in symptom-free CD patients. The ratio of Lactobacillus--Bifidobacterium to Bacteroides--E. coli was significantly reduced in coeliac patients with either active or inactive disease compared with controls. The differences in Atopobium, Eubacterium rectale--Clostridium coccoides, Clostridium histolyticum, Clostridium lituseburense, sulphate-reducing bacteria and Faecalibacterium prausnitzii populations among the three groups of children were less relevant. Overall, the higher incidence of Gram-negative and potentially pro-inflammatory bacteria in the duodenal microbiota of coeliac children was linked to the symptomatic presentation of the disease and could favour the pathological process of the disorder.},

   abstract = {BACKGROUND: Individuals with active celiac disease (CD+) have an increased incidence of thyroid dysfunction, which improves on a gluten-free diet (CD-). We investigated whether tissue transglutaminase-2 IgA antibodies (anti-TGase II) present in sera of patients with celiac disease react with thyroid tissue and possibly contribute to thyroid disease. METHODS: Serum from 40 active celiac patients taken before a gluten-free diet (CD+), 46 patients on a gluten-free diet (CD-), 40 normal controls (NC), and 25 with Crohn's disease (CROHN) was used. All sera were screened for antithyroperoxidase antibodies (TPO-AB) and thyroglobulin antibodies (TG-AB), and indirect immunofluorescence (IIF) was performed on primate thyroid tissue sections using TPO-AB- and TG-AB-negative sera. RESULTS: IIF with thyroid seronegative, anti-TGase II-positive CD+ sera (n = 23) demonstrated staining of thyroid follicular cells and extracellular matrix, in an identical pattern with monoclonal anti-human TGase II antibody. Evidence of TGase II as the antigen in thyroid tissue was supported by elimination of the IIF pattern when sera were depleted of anti-TGase II by pretreatment with human recombinant TGase II. No staining of thyroid tissue was observed when sera from CD+ patients that were negative for TGase II antibodies, or sera from NC subjects were used. Thyroid antibodies were found in 43% of CD+ patients, significantly higher than NC and CROHN patients (p < 0.0001). In addition, a positive correlation was observed between anti-TGase II and TPO-AB titers (p = 0.0001; r = 0.63). CONCLUSIONS: Anti-TGase II antibodies bind to TGase II in thyroid tissue, and titers correlate with TPO antibody titers. These findings suggest that anti-TGase II antibodies could contribute to the development of thyroid disease in celiac disease.},

   abstract = {Celiac disease is a gluten-sensitive enteropathy that affects as much as 1% of the population. Patients with celiac disease should maintain a lifelong gluten-free diet, in order to avoid serious complications and consequences. It is essential to have methods of analysis to reliably control the contents of gluten-free foods, and there is a definitive need for an assay that is easy to use, and can be used on site, to facilitate the rapid testing of incoming raw materials or monitoring for gluten contamination, by industries generating gluten-free foods. Here, we report on the development of an electrochemical immunosensor exploiting an antibody raised against the putative immunodominant celiac disease epitope, for the measurement of gliadin content and potential celiac toxicity of a foodstuff. To develop the gliadin immunosensor, we explored the use of two surface chemistries, based on the use of dithiols, 22-(3,5-bis((6-mercaptohexyl)oxy)phenyl)-3,6,9,12,15,18,21-heptaoxadocosanoic acid (1) and 1,2-dithiolane-3-pentanoic acid (thioctic acid) (2), for anchoring of the capture antibody. The different surface chemistries were evaluated in terms of time required for formation of self-assembled monolayers, stability, susceptibility to nonspecific binding, reproducibility, and sensitivity. The thioctic acid self-assembled monolayer took more than 100 h to attain a stable surface and rapidly destabilized following functionalization with capture antibody, while the heptaoxadocosanoic acid surface rapidlyformed (less than 3 h) and was stable for at least 5 days, stored at room temperature, following antibody immobilization. Both surface chemistries gave rise to highly sensitive immunosensors, with detection limits of 5.5 and 11.6 ng/mL being obtained for 1 and 2, respectively, with nonspecific binding of just 2.7% of the specific signal attained. The immunosensors were extremely reproducible, with RSD of 5.2 and 6.75% obtained for 1 and 2 (n = 5, 30 ng/mL), respectively. Finally, the immunosensor was applied to the analysis of commercial gluten-free and gluten-containing raw and processed foodstuffs, and excellent correlation achieved when its performance compared to that of an ELISA.},

In the absence of information on dietetic provision in coeliac disease management in the UK and with surveys in other countries suggesting that patients with coeliac disease gain most information from coeliac support groups (Green et al., 2001), Coeliac UK set out to investigate dietetic services for coeliac patients in the UK. METHODS: Questionnaires were sent to dietetic departments in the UK via the Regional Managers Group of the British Dietetic Association (BDA) by email. The questionnaires were in two parts, the first was completed by the dietetic manager and the second by the dietitian with the main responsibility for the management of coeliac patients within the department. RESULTS: Over one-quarter of departments reported allocating a maximum of 1 h of dietitians' time per month per 100,000 population to seeing coeliac patients. More hours were allocated to coeliac patients in departments where dietitians had attended coeliac disease training, where dietitians were professional members of Coeliac UK or where coeliac patient care was undertaken by a multi-disciplinary team. CONCLUSION: There is wide variation in dietetic provision for diagnosed coeliac patients in the UK. The Coeliac UK survey suggests that the current level of dietetic provision is in the region of one-third of what is required according to the BSG management guidelines (British Society of Gastroenterology (BSG), 2002) to provide diagnosed coeliacs with only basic support and annual review.},

   abstract = {OBJECTIVE: Patients with celiac disease, who often carry human leukocyte antigen-DR3;DQ2, are prone to inadequate response to hepatitis B immunization. We evaluated vaccine response in relation to disease activity and whether previous treatment with a gluten-free diet influences the achievement of protective antibody titers. PATIENTS AND METHODS: We studied 128 children and adolescents with celiac disease and 113 age-matched control subjects. Twenty-two patients with celiac disease were prospectively immunized after diagnosis during dietary treatment (group 1). A total of 106 (group 2) and the control subjects received vaccination by mass immunization in schools at 14 years of age regardless of diet status and when celiac disease was still undiagnosed in 27 of these children. Diet compliance and celiac disease activity were monitored by measurement of antibodies against transglutaminase and endomysium. Vaccine response was determined by measuring antihepatitis B antibodies from serum. RESULTS: The seroconversion after hepatitis B vaccination was 95.5% in group 1. All of these patients carried human leukocyte antigen DQ2. The response rate in group 2 was 50.9% and correlated with gluten intake (untreated patients: 25.9%, non-strict diet: 44.4%, strict diet: 61.4%). Treated and compliant patients did not significantly differ from control subjects (75.2%). Thirty-seven antihepatitis B-negative patients with celiac disease received a booster during a controlled gluten-free diet, and 36 (97.3%) seroconverted, irrespective of the presence of human leukocyte antigen DQ2. CONCLUSIONS: Nonresponse to recombinant hepatitis B surface antigen may be a sign of undiagnosed celiac disease. However, there is a good vaccine response in adequately treated patients. Human leukocyte antigen DQ alleles do not seem to have a primary role. Revaccination is recommended during a controlled gluten-free diet.},

   abstract = {Celiac disease is becoming an increasingly recognized autoimmune enteropathy caused by a permanent intolerance to gluten. Once thought to be a rare disease of childhood characterized by diarrhea, celiac disease is actually a multisystemic disorder that occurs as a result of an immune response to ingested gluten in genetically predisposed individuals. Screening studies have revealed that celiac disease is most common in asymptomatic adults in the United States. Although considerable scientific progress has been made in understanding celiac disease and in preventing or curing its manifestations, a strict gluten-free diet is the only treatment for celiac disease to date. Early diagnosis and treatment, together with regular follow-up visits with a dietitian, are necessary to ensure nutritional adequacy and to prevent malnutrition while adhering to the gluten-free diet for life. The purpose of this review is to provide clinicians with current updated information about celiac disease, its diverse clinical presentation and increased prevalence, the complex pathophysiology and strong genetic predisposition to celiac disease, and its diagnosis. This review focuses in detail on the gluten-free diet and the importance of intense expert dietary counseling for all patients with celiac disease. Recent advances in the gluten-free diet include food allergen labeling as well as the US Food and Drug Administration's proposed definition of the food-labeling term gluten-free. The gluten-free diet is complex and patients need comprehensive nutrition education from a skilled dietitian.},

The aim of the present study is to evaluate the possibility of treating all severe skin manifestations of DH by a GFD only. METHODS: Seventy-two patients with DH were subdivided in two groups: group A (18 patients) underwent a GFD and received dapsone; group B (54 patients) underwent a GFD. Patients were subdivided into slight, moderate and severe forms. RESULTS: A total of 88.9% of patients treated with dapsone and a GFD (group A) had remission of skin manifestations and the remaining 11.1% were improved. In group B, 87% of patients showed complete remission of skin manifestations after 18 months of a GFD; 13% showed improvement. With regard to severe forms, after an 18-month treatment, 70.4% of patients in group B; 66.6% in group A. CONCLUSION: Our study shows that a GFD, if administered steadily and for a long period, can be a valid treatment for severe forms of DH. Dapsone can be useful to control the inflammatory phase of the disease.},

   abstract = {OBJECTIVE: To asses the prevalence of celiac disease and to evaluate the clinical effects of a gluten-free diet on metabolic control and growth in children and adolescents with type 1 diabetes mellitus (DM1). PATIENTS AND METHODS: We performed a retrospective study of 261 patients with DM1. Diagnosis of celiac disease was based on the presence of endomysium and tissue transglutaminase antibodies in serum and was confirmed by intestinal biopsy. The impact of a gluten-free diet on metabolic control (mean annual HbAlc values), growth (height and annual growth velocity) and nutritional status (body mass index) was evaluated. Patients diagnosed with DM1 and subsequently with celiac disease were compared with a control group of patients with DM1 only. RESULTS: Twenty-one (8%) of the 261 diabetic patients were diagnosed with celiac disease and 19% also had another associated autoimmune disease. No significant differences were found in growth or metabolic control after withdrawal of gluten from the diet. CONCLUSIONS: We found a high prevalence of celiac disease in our type 1 diabetes population. A gluten-free diet had no effects on metabolic control of diabetes or on height or weight. Nevertheless, given the high prevalence of celiac disease and the possible development of long-term complications, such as lymphoma and osteoporosis, we recommend systematic screening in all diabetic patients, especially in the first 5 years after diagnosis of DM1.},

   abstract = {OBJECTIVE: In a recent study by our group, it was shown that a large proportion of patients with lactose malabsorption and with no bacterial overgrowth are affected by silent coeliac disease (CD). Our aim was to evaluate the effect of a gluten-free diet on lactose malabsorption assessed using the hydrogen lactose breath test (LBT) and also the relationship with normalization of duodenal biopsies in coeliac patients. MATERIAL AND METHODS: Fifteen patients (11 F, 4 M; mean age 35.8+/-6) affected by CD with a positive LBT and negative glucose breath test were enrolled. All were started on a gluten-free diet and were re-evaluated after 6 months by LBT and after 12 months by both LBT and upper gastrointestinal endoscopy with biopsies. RESULTS: LBT normalization was observed in 1 out of 15 patients (6.7%) after 6 months and in 9 of the remaining 14 (64.2%) after 12 months. Duodenal biopsies showed normal villi in 8 patients, partial villous atrophy in 5 and total atrophy in 2. CONCLUSIONS: The present study shows that a large proportion of CD patients experience a regression of lactose malabsorption after receiving a gluten-free diet. This may be related to normalization of the brush border with an improvement of lactase enzyme activity. LBT should be performed after 12 months in CD patients on a gluten-free diet in order to assess the persistence/disappearance of lactose malabsorption, thus avoiding an unnecessary lactose-free diet.},

   abstract = {BACKGROUND & AIMS: Celiac disease is caused by an inappropriate immune response to dietary gluten, with increased epithelial lymphocyte infiltration in the duodenum/jejunum as a hallmark. The chemokine receptor 9 (CCR9) is a small intestinal homing receptor normally found on most mucosal T cells in this organ. Because CCR9 expression appears to be activation dependent, we examined CCR9 on duodenal T cells from untreated and treated (gluten-free diet) patients with celiac disease and healthy controls. METHODS: Duodenal biopsy specimens and blood samples were obtained for histologic analysis and flow-cytometric CCR9 analysis of isolated lymphocytes. CCR9 expression after activation was studied in peripheral blood T cells from healthy volunteers. RESULTS: The median number of CCR9(+) cells among CD3(+) T cells in epithelium and lamina propria, respectively, was 56% and 48% in controls, 11% and 40% in treated patients, and 1% and 8% in untreated patients. Significant differences occurred between controls and treated or untreated patients in the epithelium but only between controls and untreated patients in the lamina propria (P=.008, all comparisons). No such differences were seen in peripheral blood, but stimulation with phorbol myristate acetate and ionomycin and, to a lesser extent, stimulation via NKG2D reduced the CCR9 expression on blood T cells. CONCLUSIONS: CCR9 expression is reduced on epithelial and lamina propria T cells in untreated celiac disease. Down-regulation of CCR9 persists in intraepithelial T cells from well-treated patients. This suggests ongoing immune activation preferentially within the epithelium.},

OBJECTIVE: The main aim of this study was to demonstrate the utility of determining CD3()/CD7(+) and T cell receptor (TCR) gamma-delta IEL subsets by flow cytometry as a diagnostic marker of adult celiac disease. PATIENTS AND METHODS: We performed a prospective study in a sample of 128 adult patients (70 with celiac disease and 58 controls). In all patients, distal duodenal biopsy was performed and IEL subsets were determined by flow cytometry. RESULTS: Patients with celiac disease showed an increase in gamma-delta IEL subsets and a decrease in CD3(-)/CD7(+) IEL subsets in comparison with the control group, independently of diet. CONCLUSIONS: The results indicate that IEL subset determination by flow cytometry could be useful to confirm diagnosis of celiac disease. IEL subsets should be investigated in diseases other than celiac disease, as well as in patients with potential or latent celiac disease.},

   abstract = {OBJECTIVES: Sweden experienced a unique epidemic of celiac disease in children <2 years of age. The epidemic was partly explained by changes in infant feeding over time and indicated a multifactorial pathogenesis. The main aim of this study was to analyze celiac disease risk in epidemic and postepidemic birth cohorts up to preschool age, to explore further the opportunity for primary prevention. METHODS: A population-based incidence register of celiac disease in children covering the entire nation from 1998 to 2003 and part of the country back to 1973 was analyzed. European Society for Pediatric Gastroenterology, Hepatology, and Nutrition diagnostic criteria for celiac disease were used. The annual incidence rate for each age group and the cumulative incidence according to age for each birth cohort were calculated. RESULTS: A considerable difference in cumulative incidences of celiac disease at comparable ages was demonstrated between birth cohorts from the epidemic and postepidemic periods. The difference persisted during the preschool years, although it decreased somewhat with age. During the last years of the follow-up period, there was again a successive increase in incidence rate among children <2 years of age. CONCLUSIONS: The difference in celiac disease risk between birth cohorts at comparable ages suggests an opportunity for primary prevention. This highlights the importance of further exploring the role of infant feeding and exogenous factors besides dietary gluten that might initiate or prevent disease development. Moreover, on the basis of postepidemic incidence trends, we speculate that the Swedish epidemic might not have been as unique as thought previously, although its magnitude was striking.},

However, knowledge is limited regarding their own perspectives and experiences of managing the disease and the prescription of a gluten-free diet. The aim of this study was to explore how adolescents with coeliac disease perceive and manage their everyday lives in relation to a gluten-free diet. METHODS: In total, 47 adolescents with coeliac disease, divided into 10 focus groups, were interviewed. In the qualitative analysis, themes emerged to illustrate and explain the adolescents' own perspectives on life with a gluten-free diet. RESULTS: The probability of compliance with the gluten-free diet was comprised by insufficient knowledge of significant others, problems with the availability and sensory acceptance of gluten-free food, insufficient social support and their perceived dietary deviance. Three different approaches to the gluten-free diet emerged: compliers, occasional noncompliers, and noncompliers. Each approach, as a coping strategy, was rational in the sense that it represented the adolescents' differing views of everyday life with coeliac disease and a prescription of a gluten-free diet. CONCLUSIONS: dolescents with coeliac disease experience various dilemmas related to the gluten-free diet. The study demonstrated unmet needs and implies empowerment strategies for optimum clinical outcomes.},

The present study in children highlights the possible coexistence of these two conditions. This study also analyzes the epidemiological and clinical profiles of these patients. METHODS: The medical records of patients diagnosed with celiac disease from 1 April 1999 to 31 March 2007 were reviewed. Patients with coincident histological diagnosis of eosinophilic esophagitis were retrospectively identified. The presenting symptoms, laboratory evaluations, endoscopic and histopathological findings, and treatment and follow-up outcomes of these patients were analyzed. RESULTS: Of the 221 patients with celiac disease, seven (3.2%) were also diagnosed with eosinophilic esophagitis. A majority (6/7) presented with periumbilical pain and diarrhea. None had dysphagia. Each patient had abnormal celiac screening tests. Three patients had peripheral blood eosinophilia and elevated eosinophil cationic protein. Endoscopic changes of eosinophilic esophagitis and celiac disease were apparent in the majority of patients (6/7). A gluten-free diet was instituted in every patient. Topical corticosteroid therapy was started in one patient at diagnosis and in another patient after repeat endoscopic and histopathological evaluations. CONCLUSIONS: Awareness of the potential coexistence of eosinophilic esophagitis and celiac disease should promote optimal diagnosis of these conditions. Routine esophageal biopsies may be warranted when investigating for celiac disease.},

   abstract = {AIMS: Some patients with coeliac disease, despite strict adherence to a gluten-free diet, continue to have significant symptoms and/or a severe small intestinal histological lesion. The term "refractory coeliac disease" (rCD) is used to describe this condition. The purpose of this study was to investigate the value of tissue molecular markers reported to help in the diagnosis of rCD. METHODS: Details on 61 patients with suspected rCD were collected. The clinical and laboratory findings in these patients were carefully evaluated, in part to determine whether patients were adhering to a strict gluten-free diet. The co-expression of CD3 and CD8 on intraepithelial lymphocytes was investigated by monoclonal antibody staining of small intestinal biopsy tissue; a finding of less than 50% CD3+ cells co-expressing CD8 was defined as an aberrant phenotype. T cell receptor gene rearrangement was assessed when a sufficient tissue sample was available. RESULTS: A diagnosis of rCD was made in 38 patients based on clinical, laboratory and histological data. An aberrant intraepithelial lymphocyte population was found in 20 of these patients and in this group a clonal T cell population was found in five of seven patients tested. In the remaining 18 patients, the CD3/CD8 ratio was normal and two of seven tested had a clonal T cell population. After detailed monitoring, a diagnosis of rCD was excluded in the remaining 23 patients. CONCLUSIONS: This study supports the use of phenotypic and T cell clonality investigations in identifying patients with true rCD.},

   abstract = {INTRODUCTION: the prevalence of autoimmune diseases is increased in patients with coeliac disease. Duration of gluten exposure seems to predispose adolescents with coeliac disease to autoimmune diseases. AIM: In a retrospective cohort study, we assessed the relationship between autoimmune disorders and actual gluten exposure in patients with coeliac disease. PATIENTS AND METHODS: the frequency of autoimmune disorders was evaluated in 64 patients (53 females, 11 males, mean age 29 years, range 16-63) with coeliac disease. The effect of age at the end of follow up, age at diagnosis of coeliac disease, actual gluten-exposure time, gender and diagnostic delay was assessed. RESULTS: the prevalence of autoimmune diseases was 17%. Mean duration of gluten exposure was 26 and 25 years for patients with and without autoimmunity, respectively. Logistic regression showed that a longer mean follow up (P(1/4)0.044) was related to the prevalence of autoimmune disorders while actual gluten exposure was not predictive. CONCLUSION: in this study, the prevalence of autoimmune diseases in patients with late coeliac disease diagnosis does not correlate with duration of gluten intake. Confirmatory prospective, multicentre studies of the effect of gluten-free diet are needed in adults.},

   abstract = {Celiac disease (CD) has become more common than in the past, although it frequently remains undetected for long periods of time. One reason for this is failure by health care professionals to recognize the variable clinical manifestations of CD and to perform the appropriate tests to make the diagnosis. Although dyspepsia may be part of a clinical spectrum in CD patients, there are scarce data about its prevalence in silent CD. We aimed to determine the prevalence of CD in otherwise healthy dyspeptic patients by means of serologic screening followed by endoscopic biopsies if appropriate. Anti-endomysium antibody assay was positive in 3 of 196 patients. All 3 were female, ages ranged from 19-52 years (mean +/- SD age, 36 +/- 16 years). Duodenal biopsies were compatible with CD in all, whereas abnormal endoscopic findings were noted in 2. Therefore, a 1.5% prevalence of CD was observed in this study group. The odds ratio for CD was 2.57 (95% confidence interval) in comparison with the general population. CD should be kept in mind as a cause of dyspepsia during clinical activities. The association between these 2 conditions is, at most, weak, but a gluten-free diet may still bring symptomatic relief for dyspeptic symptoms in CD. During endoscopic examination for dyspepsia, if indicated, endoscopists should carefully inspect the duodenum for CD findings. Although routine serologic screening can not be recommended, it may be appropriate for the patients with refractory dyspepsia, especially females.},

A 12-year-old girl with recurrent diarrhea and failure to thrive was diagnosed with celiac disease. After six months of gluten-free diet her symptoms persisted. Adherence to diet was considered as correct and complete by a dietitian evaluation and by anti-endomysial antibodies that had become negative. Treatment with pancreatic enzymes, metronidazole or lactose free diet did not improve her symptoms. Colonoscopy was performed and lymphocytic colitis was diagnosed on histology from colonic biopsies. After mesalamine therapy diarrhea ceased, and weight and height z scores increased.

   abstract = {BACKGROUND: It is unknown how many endoscopic biopsy specimens are needed to diagnose celiac disease (CD). OBJECTIVE: To determine the numbers of duodenal biopsy specimens needed to diagnose CD. DESIGN: Retrospective medical record audit, histology slide analysis, and chart review. SETTING: A tertiary-care university hospital. PATIENTS: Adults who underwent EGD to diagnose CD. INTERVENTIONS: Our pathology database was searched for the keywords "consistent with celiac disease," "not consistent with celiac disease," "villous atrophy," and "intraepithelial lymphocytes" from January 2001 to May 2006. The number of biopsy specimens was determined and graded for a modified Marsh classification, and charts were reviewed for diagnosis verification. CD was confirmed if Marsh grade 3A was found, even on one biopsy specimen. MAIN OUTCOME MEASUREMENTS: The number of biopsy specimens needed to make the diagnosis of CD. RESULTS: Of 247 cases, 102 patients were diagnosed with biopsy specimen-confirmed CD. In 9 patients, CD could not be confirmed on the basis of histology alone (highest Marsh lesion was grade 1 or 2), but a clinical diagnosis was made on the basis of presentation and serology. CD could be confirmed if only 2 biopsy specimens were obtained in 84 patients (90%), if only 3 biopsy specimens were obtained in an additional 5 patients (95%), and if at least 4 biopsy specimens were taken in the remainder. CD was ruled out in 145 patients. In 142 patients, biopsy specimens were uniformly negative; 3 patients had Marsh grade 1 lesions but negative serology. LIMITATIONS: A retrospective design. CONCLUSIONS: Only 2 biopsy specimens will lead to a confirmed diagnosis of CD in 90%, and a suspected diagnosis in all. For 100% confidence in diagnosis of CD, 4 duodenal biopsy specimens should be taken.},

   abstract = {GOAL: Recent studies suggest an increasing prevalence of atypical initial symptoms in patients with celiac disease (CD). The aim of this study was to compare the presenting symptoms of CD at 2 comparable referral institutions in South Florida, and in Ankara, Turkey. We retrospectively reviewed the records of patients with an initial diagnosis of CD by small bowel biopsy during the same (1991 to 2001) 10-year period at Cleveland Clinic Florida and University of Ankara, Turkey. A numerical score was assigned to presenting symptom and signs. RESULTS: There were 28 patients in the South Florida group (51% men) and 40 patients in the Turkish group (35% men) (P=NS). The Turkish patients were significantly younger at diagnosis (36+/-2 y vs. US patients 66+/-3 y) (P<0.0001). Typical celiac symptom scores were similar (Turkey 1.1+/-0.2 vs. South Florida 1.3+/-0.3) (P=NS). Atypical symptom scores were significantly higher in the US patients (1.9+/-0.2) versus those from Turkey (1.2+/-0.1) (P<0.01). The Turkish patients were significantly more likely (P<0.01) to present with chronic diarrhea, hypoalbuminemia, and mactocytosis at the time of diagnosis. CONCLUSIONS: Although retrospective, this study points to striking differences in the clinical presentation of CD in individuals in South Florida, United States, and Ankara, Turkey, diagnosed during the same time period at both institutions. Turkish patients were younger, and more likely to present with chronic diarrhea, hypoalbuminemia, and microcytosis-as was more commonly seen in the United States in the 1960s and 70s. These findings raise the question of an interplay of demographics with diet and genetics in the presenting symptoms of CD in these 2 distant geographic areas.},

Elucidation of disease pathogenesis has created opportunities for novel therapeutic approaches to coeliac disease. AT-1001 is an inhibitor of paracellular permeability whose structure is derived from a protein secreted by Vibrio cholerae. AIM: To determine the safety and tolerability of 12 mg doses of AT-1001 in coeliac disease subjects challenged with gluten. METHODS: An in-patient, double-blind, randomized placebo-controlled safety study utilizing intestinal permeability, measured via fractional excretions of lactulose and mannitol, as an exploratory measure of drug efficacy. RESULTS: Compared to placebo, no increase in adverse events occurred in patients exposed to AT-1001. Following acute gluten exposure, a 70% increase in intestinal permeability was detected in the placebo group, while none was seen in the AT-1001 group. Interferon-gamma levels increased in four of seven patients (57%) of the placebo group, but only in four of 14 patients (29%) of the AT-1001 group. Gastrointestinal symptoms were more frequently detected in the placebo group when compared to the AT-1001 group (P = 0.018). CONCLUSIONS: AT-1001 is well tolerated and appears to reduce intestinal barrier dysfunction, proinflammatory cytokine production, and gastrointestinal symptoms in coeliacs after gluten exposure.},

It is often associated with other autoimmune diseases, such as chronic idiopathic urticaria. Nevertheless, association with cold urticaria has not yet been described. A boy aged 3 years 8 months presented local urticaria-angioedema when exposed to cold temperatures. An ice cube test was positive and iron deficiency anemia was demonstrated. He later developed legume intolerance, rhinoconjunctivitis related to pollen sensitization, and asthma. Due to persistence of cold urticaria symptoms and refractory anemia, a test for immunoglobulin A autoantibodies to tissue transglutaminase and an intestinal biopsy were performed. Results of both tests were compatible with celiac disease.A study of human leukocyte antigen indicated a high risk phenotype (HLA, DR6/DR7; DQA 0501, 0201; DQB 0301, 0201). After 7 months of a gluten-free diet, the boy's anemia resolved and he is free of symptoms when exposed to cold. This is a first description of the possibility of an association between celiac disease and cold urticaria. A poor course of cold urticaria in the absence of evidence of another underlying condition should lead to suspicion of celiac disease.},

   abstract = {Celiac disease (CD) is a permanent intolerance to gluten characterized by destructions of the small intestinal villi and malabsorption. The gluten-free diet (GFD) results in healing of the mucosa, resolution of the malabsorpitive states, and reversal of great part of CD effects. Among the extradigestive complications associated with CD, unexplained infertility has been reported since the 70's. The prevalence of CD among women with unexplained infertility is 2.5-3.5%, higher, although not always significantly, than control population. To date, it is widely accepted that untreated CD represents a risk for abortion, low birth weight babies and short-breast feeding period. These features can be corrected by GFD. Some discrepancies could stem from the heterogeneity of the studies. Regarding a potential pathogenic mechanism, since CD causes malabsorption of folic acid and other nutrients, this pathway has been proposed to explain the unfavourable outcomes of pregnancy. However, this remains a speculation. In conclusion, each woman with unexplained infertility should be screened for CD.},

   abstract = {OBJECTIVES: Our aim was to explore the diagnostic value of fasting citrulline concentrations to detect decreased intestinal energy absorption in patients with recently diagnosed celiac disease (CeD), refractory celiac disease (RCeD), and short bowel syndrome (SBS). Decreased intestinal energy absorption is regarded a marker of intestinal failure. METHODS: Fasting plasma citrulline concentrations were determined by high performance liquid chromatography (HPLC) in a prospective study of 30 consecutive adult patients (15 CeD, 9 RCeD, and 16 SBS) and 21 healthy subjects. Intestinal energy absorption capacity using bomb calorimetry was determined in all patients and healthy subjects and was regarded as the gold standard for intestinal energy absorption function. RESULTS: The mean fasting plasma citrulline concentration was lower in RCeD patients than in healthy subjects (28.5+/-9.9 vs 38.1+/-8.0 micromol/L, P<0.05) and CeD patients (28.5+/-9.9 vs 38.1+/-6.4 micromol/L, P<0.05), however, clearly within reference values. The mean intestinal energy absorption capacity was lower in SBS patients than in healthy subjects (64.3+/-18.2 vs 90.3+/-3.5%, P<0.001), CeD patients (64.3+/-18.2 vs 89.2+/-3.4%, P<0.001), and the RCeD group (64.3+/-18.2 vs 82.3+/-11.7%, P<0.01). No relation was observed between fasting plasma citrulline concentration and intestinal energy absorption capacity (Pearson r=0.09, P=0.56). The area under the ROC curve for fasting plasma citrulline to detect decreased intestinal energy absorption capacity (i.e., <85%) was 0.50. CONCLUSION: Fasting plasma citrulline concentrations have poor test characteristics for detection of decreased intestinal energy absorption capacity in patients with enterocyte damage.},

   abstract = {Undiagnosed and untreated celiac disease (CD) constitutes an increasing skeletal health problem due to its association with low bone density and fractures. Examinations of skeletal status in children using dual-energy X-ray absorptiometry (DXA) are prone to size-related misinterpretation. In contrary, the analysis of muscle-bone relationship seems to limit a possibility of misdiagnosis because skeletal status is evaluated from the functional perspective. The study was aimed to assess skeletal status of children suffering from CD with the use of muscle-bone functional algorithm. The study group comprised 29 celiac patients (13.7yr+/-2.9) on gluten-free diet (GFD), and 24 newly diagnosed atypical celiac patients, including subgroup with normal height (n=14; 12.6yr+/-3.9) and subgroup with short stature (n=10; 12.2yr+/-2.9). Muscular and skeletal status was evaluated by DXA (DPX-L, GE). Anthropometry, total body bone mineral density (TBBMD, g/cm(2)). and total body bone mineral content (TBBMC, g) as well as lean body mass (LBM, g) were evaluated. Muscle-bone interactions were estimated using TBBMC/LBM ratio. Previously established references for healthy controls were used for the calculation of Z-scores (age-matched) and SD-scores (height-matched). GFD treated celiacs and atypical celiacs with normal body height had TBBMD, TBBMC, LBM, and TBBMC/LBM ratio Z-scores and SD-scores within normal range for healthy controls. In contrary, atypical celiacs with short stature had significantly lower Z-scores for TBBMD (-2.3+/-0.4), TBBMC (-2.1+/-0.3), LBM (-1.4+/-0.3). and TBBMC/LBM ratio (-2.3+/-0.6) when compared to respective values observed in GFD treated celiacs (p<0.001, p<0.001, p<0.05, p<0.01) and atypical celiacs with normal height (p<0.01, p<0.01, p<0.05, p<0.01). When body-height matching of DXA data was used to limit the influence of body size, the atypical celiacs with short stature had SD-scores for TBBMD (-1.3+/-0.7), TBBMC (-1.3+/-0.6), and LBM (+0.8+/-0.3) not significantly different from the corresponding SD-scores obtained in the remaining 2 groups. Nevertheless, short stature in atypical celiacs still coincided with significantly lower TBBMC/LBM ratio SD-score of -1.9+/-0.7 when compared to values observed in GFD treated celiacs (+0.04+/-0.2; p<0.05) and atypical celiacs with normal height (-0.4+/-0.2; p<0.05). GFD regime in classic celiacs corresponded with physiological values of DXA assessed indicators of bone and muscle status as well as normal muscle-bone interactions. Untreated atypical celiacs may present a broad spectrum of heterogeneous abnormalities from normal to markedly depressed TBBMC/LBM ratio values pointing on the marked imbalance between TBBMC and LBM.},

Sensitive and specific antibody tests are available for detecting celiac disease. AIMS: To evaluate the prevalence in France of histologically documented celiac disease in a vast cohort of children with type 1 DM, and to describe the features of celiac disease and treatment response. METHODS: Retrospective cohort study of 950 children with type 1 diabetes seen between 1994 and 2001. Antibodies to gliadin, reticulin, endomysium and transglutaminase were looked for one to seven times in each patient. RESULTS: Fifteen patients (1.6%) had biopsy-confirmed celiac disease. Symptoms led to the diagnosis in six patients (mean age, 7 years) and screening tests in nine patients (mean age, 11 years). Anti-endomysium antibodies were consistently positive. Tests for HLA-DQB1 0201 and/or 0302 were positive. Anti-endomysium antibody seroconversion was seen in two patients, 2 and 6 years, respectively, after the diagnosis of diabetes. In another patient, the biopsy became abnormal 6 years after the first positive anti-endomysium antibody test (latent form). After a mean of 3 years on a gluten-free diet, significant increases were noted in body weight (P=0.04) and insulin dose (P=0.05); clinical symptoms completely resolved in five of the six symptomatic patients. CONCLUSIONS: The prevalence of celiac disease is higher in children with type 1 DM than in the general pediatric population. Serological screening is useful for diagnosing asymptomatic celiac disease, detecting seroconversion and monitoring latent forms of disease.},

Malnutrition due to chronic malabsorption can alter the axis and can be a cause of primary amenorrhea. CASE: A 20-year-old woman presented to us with primary amenorrhea and failure of development of secondary sexual characteristics. She had significant weight loss in spite of normal intake of diet. On investigation, she had microcytic hypochromic anemia, and her follicle-stimulating hormone and luteinizing hormone levels were low, while the thyroid-stimulating hormone and prolactin levels were normal. Her duodenal biopsy showed villus atrophy, and IgA antiendomysial antibody was positive, suggestive of celiac disease. The patient's condition improved markedly and attained menarche after 6 months of a gluten-free diet. CONCLUSION: Celiac disease should be considered in patients presenting with malnutrition and primary amenorrhea.},

   abstract = {As many as one in every 100 to 200 persons in the United States has celiac disease, a condition resulting from an inappropriate immune response to the dietary protein gluten. The manifestations of celiac disease range from no symptoms to overt malabsorption with involvement of multiple organ systems and an increased risk of some malignancies. When celiac disease is suspected, initial testing for serum immunoglobulin A (IgA) tissue transglutaminase (tTG) antibodies is useful because it offers adequate sensitivity and specificity at a reasonable cost. A positive IgA tTG result should prompt small bowel biopsy with at least four tissue samples to confirm the diagnosis. However, 3 percent of patients with celiac disease have IgA deficiency. Therefore, if the serum IgA tTG result is negative but clinical suspicion for the disease is high, a serum total IgA level may be considered. Screening of asymptomatic patients is not recommended. The basis of treatment for celiac disease is adherence to a gluten-free diet, which may eliminate symptoms within a few months. Patients should also be evaluated for osteoporosis, thyroid dysfunction, and deficiencies in folic acid, vitamin B12, fat-soluble vitamins, and iron, and treated appropriately. Serum IgA tTG levels typically decrease as patients maintain a gluten-free diet.},

METHODS: Seventeen children with history of dyspeptic symptoms were investigated. RESULTS: Six patients (M/F:2/4; mean age +/- s.d.: 5.6 +/- 1.3 years, range: 4-7 years; Group A) affected by eosinophilic oesophagitis also received a diagnosis of coeliac disease. The other 11 children (M/F:10/1, mean age +/- s.d.:7.5 +/- 2.3 years, range: 4-10 years, Group B) were affected solely by eosinophilic oesophagitis. All children underwent a change in dietary regimen. Group A received a gluten-free diet. Group B attempted dietary restriction based on the allergy testing results. After 6 months follow-up, all patients in Group A showed a complete disappearance of symptoms and three of them, who underwent upper gastrointestinal endoscopy, showed histologic remission. Patients from Group B had moderate clinical improvement and in seven of them (64%) a repeated upper gastrointestinal endoscopy showed a statistically significant reduction in eosinophilic infiltration. CONCLUSIONS: This is the first reported group of patients with an association between coeliac disease and eosinophilic oesophagitis. To date, it is not possible to exclude that in a subgroup of children with coeliac disease the oesophageal eosinophilic infiltration could be caused by coeliac disease itself.},

   abstract = {Celiac disease presents a hereditary disorder of gluten tolerance, i.e. of gliadin and related prolamins of wheat, rye and barley. It primarily occurs in Caucasians (1:100-300),while it is considerably or exceptionally rare in colored races. It is particularly frequent in close relatives of the patient, as well as in persons with congenital IgA deficiency and in patients with autoimmune and some chromosomal diseases. The basis of the disease, as well as the key finding in its diagnostics, lies in small bowel inflammation, which withdraws on gluten free diet. Beside clinically manifest or non-manifest enteropathy, changes involving other organs and systems are also frequently seen. The diagnosis of the manifest form of the disease is based on characteristic pathohistological finding detected by the examination of small bowel mucosa in patients on standard diets and their clinical improvement after the introduction of gluten free diet. However, in the diagnosis of the asymptomatic form of the disease, it is necessary to perform enterobiopsy, which confirms the normalization of the appearance of small bowel mucosa in patients on the elimination diet. In children with gluten sensitive enteropathy detected in the first two years of life, as well as in cases in which mucosa samples taken on the first enterobiopsy do not have typical appearance or are inadequate for a reliable interpretation, a definite diagnosis is made based on biopsy finding during the provocation of gluten tolerance. As the quality of permanent teeth can be disturbed, this procedure is not suggested to be done before the completed age of 6 years, and due to adverse effects on the growth and development of the child, it should not be done during puberty. Due to incomplete sensitivity and specificity, the serological indicators of the disease do not have diagnostic value. Therefore, they are primarily used in the disclosure of asymptomatic and atypical forms of celiac disease, as well as in the assessment of the consistency of elimination diet in cases with already verified disease. In addition, the application of these tests makes easier passing the decision to perform pathohistological examination of small bowel mucosa in patients with provoked gluten tolerance, which also gives a more complete understanding into the remission of the disease during the initial phase of treatment.},

The conventional coeliac antibody tests are performed from serum samples in centralized laboratories. AIMS: To evaluate a rapid and easy immunoglobulin A-class whole blood point-of-care test and its commercial application, the Biocard test, in coeliac autoantibody detection. METHODS: In the whole blood point-of-care test transglutaminase is liberated from the red blood cells by haemolysis. Transglutaminase antibodies, if present, complex with the liberated antigen, and are visualized. Altogether 51 biopsy-proven untreated coeliac adult patients, 48 of the same patients after treatment, and 36 controls were tested. The point-of-care test results were compared with serum endomysial and transglutaminase antibody and Biocard test results and histology. RESULTS: The whole blood point-of-care test was as sensitive (82%) as the serum endomysium test (80%) in detecting untreated coeliac disease while the serum transglutaminase antibody test was superior (88%). The tests had 100% specificity. A positive point-of-care test result seroconverted or the test reaction weakened in 90% of the treated coeliac patients. Biocard test-positive were 22 of the 24 tested untreated coeliac patients. Biocard test-negative were 15 of 19 controls. CONCLUSIONS: The whole blood rapid tests are as reliable as the conventional serological tests in detecting untreated coeliac disease and in coeliac disease diet monitoring.},

   abstract = {INTRODUCTION: This study was done to further reveal the role of the innate immune system in celiac disease. METHODS: Dendritic cells were matured from venous blood of patients with active or treated celiac disease and DQ2-DQ8-positive or negative controls. Dendritic cells were treated with a peptic-tryptic digest of gliadin (500 microg/ml) and their activation was analyzed by fluorescent-activated cell sorting analysis, cytokine secretion, and their ability to elicit T cell proliferation. RESULTS AND DISCUSSION: Gliadin upregulated interleukin (IL)-6, IL-8, and IL-12 (p40) secretion in dendritic cells and induced strong expression of the maturation markers human leukocyte antigen (HLA)-DR, CD25, CD83, and CD86 of all subjects irrespective of their genotype or the presence of disease, whereas the digest of bovine serum albumin showed no effect. However, gliadin-stimulated dendritic cells from active celiac showed enhanced stimulation of autologous T cells compared to the other groups. CONCLUSION: Further research should be aimed at identifying the mechanisms that control inflammation in healthy individuals.},

   abstract = {Tetramers of MHC-peptide complexes are used for detection and characterization of antigen-specific T cell responses, but they require knowledge about both antigenic peptide and the MHC restriction element. The successful application of these reagents in human diseases involving CD4+ T cells is limited. Celiac disease, an intestinal inflammation driven by mucosal CD4+ T cells recognizing wheat gluten peptides in the context of disease-associated HLA-DQ molecules, is an ideal model to test the potential clinical use of these reagents. We investigated whether gluten-specific T cells can be detected in the peripheral blood of celiac disease patients using DQ2 tetramers. Nine DQ2+ patients and six control individuals on a gluten-free diet were recruited to the study. Participants consumed 160 g of gluten-containing bread daily for 3 days. After bread-challenge, gluten-specific T cells were detectable in the peripheral blood of celiac patients but not controls both directly by tetramer staining and indirectly by enzyme-linked immunospot. These T cells expressed the beta(7) integrin indicative of gut-homing properties. Most of the cells had a memory phenotype, but many other phenotypic markers showed a heterogeneous pattern. Tetramer staining of gluten-specific T cells has the potential to be used for diagnosis of celiac disease.},

   abstract = {The excretion of hydrogen in breath commonly persists, despite an overnight fast. Although the elevation of hydrogen concentration above the fasting value after the administration of a test sugar is evidence of malabsorption, the level of the fasting value itself in untreated celiac patients is unknown. Therefore, we studied the fasting breath hydrogen (FBH(2)) concentration in 40 healthy controls, 35 subjects with functional bowel disorders, and 30 patients of untreated celiac disease with and without bread or wheat diet one day before the test. The fasting level of hydrogen concentration in untreated celiac patients (28.7 +/- 19.5 ppm) was significantly higher than those in healthy volunteers (9.5 +/- 3.4 ppm) and subjects with functional bowel disorders (10.6 +/- 4.5 ppm). The percentage of patients with elevated H(2) fasting levels in untreated celiac disease (82.5%) was significantly higher than that in healthy controls (10%) and subjects with functional bowel disorders (17.1%). In 30 celiac patients, studied with and without wheat-free diet one day before the test, the fasting hydrogen levels decreased from 28.7 +/- 19.5 ppm to 10.6 +/- 3.5 ppm, and becoming normal in all patients of celiac disease. Our results show that the patients of untreated celiac disease should be instructed not to eat things made up of wheat one day before hydrogen breath testing so that the normal fasting hydrogen concentration can be obtained and false-negative hydrogen breath test results can be avoided.},

   abstract = {BACKGROUND: Occasionally celiac patients continue to experience gastro-intestinal symptoms even with a gluten free diet. In these cases, small intestinal bacterial overgrowth may be one of the causes of the lack of response. Therefore, this prospective study was planned to determine the prevalence of small intestinal bacterial overgrowth in celiac patients. MATERIALS AND METHODS: We studied 87 confirmed cases of celiac disease from North India and 87 age and sex matched controls. Celiac disease was confirmed by positive IgA antitissue transglutaminase on ELISA. 80 g glucose hydrogen breath test (non-invasive test) was performed to establish small intestinal bacterial overgrowth. Rise of more than 10 ppm in hydrogen concentration over baseline value within two hours was considered suggestive of small intestinal bacterial overgrowth. RESULTS: Out of 87 patients with celiac disease, 49 were male and 38 were female. The mean (+/-SD) age for male patients was 26.3 +/- 16.3 years (range 14-59 years) and for female patients was 28.4 +/- 15.6 years (range 16-58 years). Amongst the controls, 52 (59.8%) were male and 35 (40.2%) were female. The mean (+/- SD) age for male controls was 27.6 +/- 14.5 years (range 15-57 years) and for female controls was 29.3 +/- 16.5 years (range 18-59 years). Hydrogen breath test was suggestive of bacterial overgrowth in 18 of the 87 (20.7%) celiac disease patients but not in any of the apparently healthy controls. CONCLUSION: This study indicates that a large number of celiac patients from North India suffer from bacterial overgrowth which can be accordingly treated with antibiotics.},

   abstract = {The treatment of celiac disease is a strict adherence to a gluten-free diet for life. In the past, oats were considered to be toxic to individuals with celiac disease and were not allowed in a gluten-free diet. However, recent evidence suggests that oats that are pure and uncontaminated with other gluten-containing grains, if taken in limited quantities, are safe for most individuals with celiac disease. For adults, up to 70 g (1/2 to 3/4 cup) of oats per day and for children, up to 25 g (1/4 cup) per day are safe to consume. These oats and oat products must fulfill the standards for a gluten-free diet set by the Canadian Food Inspection Agency and Health Canada. The Canadian Celiac Association, in consultation with Health Canada, Agriculture & Agri-Food Canada and the Canadian Food Inspection Agency, has established requirements for growing, processing, and purity testing and labelling of pure oats. These strategies have led to the production of pure, uncontaminated oats for the first time in Canada. Oats and oat products that are safe for consumption by individuals with celiac disease and dermatitis herpetiformis are now commercially available in Canada.},

   abstract = {BACKGROUND & AIMS: Serologic tests are used frequently in celiac disease diagnosis. Gliadin antibodies generally lack the accuracy required for proper diagnosis. We evaluated the value of deamidated gliadin antibody measurements in the diagnosis and follow-up evaluation of celiac disease and compared their potential usefulness with that of gliadin and tissue-transglutaminase antibodies. METHODS: We tested deamidated gliadin, gliadin, and tissue-transglutaminase-immunoglobulin (Ig)A and -IgG in 216 biopsy-selected subjects including 92 biopsy-proven untreated celiac patients (46% with total villous atrophy and 54% with partial villous atrophy) and 124 biopsy-proven nonceliac controls. Fifty-nine celiac patients also were tested after treatment with a gluten-free diet. Antibodies were measured by commercial enzyme-linked immunosorbent assays. Deamidated gliadin-IgA+G was detected using a conjugate reactive to both isotypes, which gives a positive if either isotype is present. RESULTS: The sensitivity, specificity, and accuracy of deamidated gliadin-IgA (74%, 95%, and 86%), deamidated gliadin-IgG (65%, 98%, and 84%), and deamidated gliadin-IgA+G (75%, 94%, and 86%) were superior to gliadin-IgA (63%, 90%, and 79%) (P < .05) and gliadin-IgG (42%, 90%, and 69%) (P < .01), and were similar to tissue-transglutaminase-IgA (78%, 98%, and 90%) before treatment. The sensitivity of IgA isotype for all tests was significantly greater in celiac patients with total villous atrophy compared with those with partial villous atrophy (P < .05). The proportion of positive test results for all tests decreased significantly after treatment (P < .0001). CONCLUSIONS: Deamidated gliadin antibody is a better diagnostic test for celiac disease than the conventional gliadin antibody testing; although histopathology remains the gold standard test for diagnosis of celiac patients.},

At six month follow up patient had gained 5 kg, but the neurological symptoms remained the same. Treatment of neurological symptoms associated with gluten hypersensitivity depends on the type of neurological syndrome associated. Only exceptionally do these symptoms improve with gluten restriction and, in some patients, the neurological manifestations even progress despite resolution of both pathologic findings and intestinal symptoms.},

It primarily causes gastrointestinal symptoms, but it can also cause malabsorption, resulting in anemia and loss of bone mass. There is also an association with other illness such as Type 1 diabetes, autoimmune diseases, and neurological illness. The gold standard for diagnosis is endoscopic biopsy with serological testing sometimes employed for diagnosis and screening. The signs and symptoms of CD can be very broad, making diagnosis problematical. Treatment consists of a gluten-free diet, which is extremely effective although compliance with the diet can be very difficult. Aeromedical disposition of aircrews engaged in military and civil aviation would depend upon the nature of operations and, in some cases, could be liberal. However, for spaceflight, disqualification would be most prudent.},

   abstract = {Presently, the only effective treatment for celiac disease is a life-long gluten-free diet. In this work, we used a new mixture of selected sourdough lactobacilli and fungal proteases to eliminate the toxicity of wheat flour during long-time fermentation. Immunological (R5 antibody-based sandwich and competitive enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay [ELISA] and R5 antibody-based Western blot), two-dimensional electrophoresis, and mass spectrometry (matrix-assisted laser desorption ionization-time of flight, strong-cation-exchange-liquid chromatography/capillary liquid chromatography-electrospray ionization-quadrupole-time of flight [SCX-LC/CapLC-ESI-Q-TOF], and high-pressure liquid chromatography-electrospray ionization-ion trap mass spectrometry) analyses were used to determine the gluten concentration. Assays based on the proliferation of peripheral blood mononuclear cells (PBMCs) and gamma interferon production by PBMCs and intestinal T-cell lines (iTCLs) from 12 celiac disease patients were used to determine the protein toxicity of the pepsin-trypsin digests from fermented wheat dough (sourdough). As determined by R5-based sandwich and competitive ELISAs, the residual concentration of gluten in sourdough was 12 ppm. Albumins, globulins, and gliadins were completely hydrolyzed, while ca. 20% of glutenins persisted. Low-molecular-weight epitopes were not detectable by SCX-LC/CapLC-ESI-Q-TOF mass spectrometry and R5-based Western blot analyses. The kinetics of the hydrolysis of the 33-mer by lactobacilli were highly efficient. All proteins extracted from sourdough activated PBMCs and induced gamma interferon production at levels comparable to the negative control. None of the iTCLs demonstrated immunoreactivity towards pepsin-trypsin digests. Bread making was standardized to show the suitability of the detoxified wheat flour. Food processing by selected sourdough lactobacilli and fungal proteases may be considered an efficient approach to eliminate gluten toxicity.},

   abstract = {Celiac disease (CD) patients show a number of gastrointestinal motor abnormalities. Ghrelin, a gastric peptide implicated in short-term feeding control and long-term body weight regulation, has been recently considered a key regulator of gastric motility. The aim of this study was to evaluate the gastric emptying rate of solids and the density of ghrelin-immunopositive cells in adult CD patients before and at least 1 year after starting a gluten-free diet. Twenty CD patients (M 8/F 12; mean age 36 years) and 10 controls underwent endoscopy with gastric and duodenal biopsies and 13C-octanoic acid breath test to measure gastric emptying of solids. Celiac disease patients repeated the protocol at least 1 year after starting gluten-free diet. Ghrelin tissue levels were evaluated by immunohistochemistry on gastric mucosa specimens. Gastric emptying time was normal in all control subjects (t(1/2) = 89 +/- 16 min) while it was delayed in CD patients prior to gluten-free diet (t(1/2) = 252 +/- 101 min; P < 0.005). The mean number of ghrelin-positive cells/field (x 400) was 14.4 +/- 2.7 in controls and 25.3 +/- 5.7 in CD patients respectively (P < 0.0001). Gluten withdrawal was effective in normalizing gastric emptying time in all CD patients (97 +/- 14 min; P < 0.0001) and resulted in a significant reduction of the density of ghrelin-immunopositive cells (19.8 +/- 5.4; P < 0.0001). The density of ghrelin-positive cells correlated directly with the degree of duodenal damage (P < 0.001) and inversely with the body mass index of CD patients (P < 0.0001). However, in neither CD patients nor controls, a correlation between tissue ghrelin levels and gastric emptying rate was detected. In conclusion, tissue ghrelin level does not correlate with gastric emptying rate in adult CD patients and in controls.},

   abstract = {BACKGROUND: Celiac disease (CD) is a complex genetic disorder of the small intestine resulting from aberrant cellular responses to gluten peptides. It may affect as much as 1% of the Western population and the only treatment is a lifelong gluten-free diet. Allelic variants of the HLA-DQ locus, coding for the HLA-DQ2 and HLA-DQ8 molecules, contribute to approximately 40% of CD etiology, whereas other genes, such as MYO9B, CTLA4, IL2, IL21, PARD3 and MAGI2, have only a modest effect. Most of these genes have shown varied association among different populations and an overlap with other autoimmune or inflammatory disorders, indicating that such disorders may share common pathways. OBJECTIVES: In this review, a molecular approach into diagnostics of celiac disease is shown. CONCLUSIONS: Genome-wide association studies will allow more genes to be identified, and knowing how risk variants combine will help to predict better the risk for the individual. HLA typing can already be used to identify high-risk individuals.},

   abstract = {The diagnosis of coeliac disease has traditionally depended on symptoms and intestinal biopsies; nowadays, the diagnosis has been expanded to include an array of serological markers and subtle microscopic lesions. The most important advance in classifying mucosal lesions in coeliac disease was forwarded by Marsh (1992), who provided the biological explanation of how the small bowel reacts to a variety of environmental antigenic challenges including gluten. In the modified version of this classification (Arnhem 1998-1999) autoantibodies have integrated into Marsh's histopathological scheme. As a large part of the coeliac 'iceberg' remains unrecognised, the difficulties in diagnosis continue to challenge clinicians and researchers. Advances in immuno-histochemistry and discovery of the other sensitive markers have acquainted us with so-called Microscopic enteritis, the distinctive subtle abnormalities behind the atypical gluten sensitivity symptoms that often remain unrecognised. Current diagnostic pathways do not always include facilities for looking for this common histological feature in atypical cases. This is essential since improving of the detection rate has been shown to be directly proportional to recognition of cases with milder or minimal mucosal abnormalities. In this revision, we will define and characterise microscopic enteritis as the entity behind a wide range of unexplained gastrointestinal symptoms. Screening for this subtle and distinctive presentation in small bowel pathology will open a new prospect in recognising the most common but unrecognised atypical forms of symptomatic gluten related enteropathies.},

   abstract = {BACKGROUND & AIMS: Refractory celiac disease (RCD) occurs when both symptoms and intestinal damage persist or recur despite strict adherence to a gluten-free diet. In RCD, the immunophenotype of intraepithelial lymphocytes may be normal and polyclonal (RCD I) or abnormal and monoclonal (RCD II). The aim is to describe the clinical characteristics, treatment, and long-term outcome in a large single-center cohort of patients with RCD. METHODS: We compared the clinical characteristics and outcome in 57 patients with RCD: 42 with RCD I and 15 with RCD II. RESULTS: Fifteen of 57 patients died during follow-up (n=8 with RCD I and n=7 with RCD II), each within the first 2 years after RCD diagnosis. The overall 5-year cumulative survival is 70%, 80%, and 45% for the entire cohort, RCD I, and RCD II, respectively. The refractory state itself and enteropathy-associated T-cell lymphoma (EATL) were the most common causes of death, respectively. A new staging system is proposed based on the cumulative effect of 5 prognostic factors investigated at the time of the refractory state diagnosis: for patients in stages I, II, and III, the 5-year cumulative survival rate was 96%, 71%, and 19%, respectively (P< .0001). CONCLUSIONS: RCD is associated with high mortality with RCD II having an especially poor prognosis because of the development of EATL. A new staging model is proposed that may improve the precision of prognosis in patients with RCD.},

   abstract = {Celiac disease is a common (1% prevalence) chronic immune-mediated disorder of the small intestine induced by dietary wheat, barley, and rye. Several hepatic disorders have been described in association with celiac disease. Isolated hypertransaminasemia with nonspecific histologic changes in a liver biopsy is the commonest hepatic presentation of celiac disease. A gluten-free diet normalizes liver enzymes and histologic changes in most patients. Moreover, celiac disease can coexist with autoimmune liver disorders such as autoimmune hepatitis, primary biliary cirrhosis, and primary sclerosing cholangitis. Celiac disease has increasingly been reported with a variety of other liver diseases. Thus, the hepatologist needs to consider celiac disease in the differential of abnormal liver blood tests and to be aware of the clinical implications of this frequent disease in patients with liver disorders. The possible mechanisms of liver injury and those common factors that explain the association of celiac disease with liver disorders are discussed. The aims of this article are (1) to review the spectrum and pathogenesis of liver injury related to celiac disease and (2) to provide direction to those caring for patients with chronic liver diseases regarding the detection and effective treatment of celiac disease.},

   abstract = {Celiac disease is a chronic immune-mediated disorder that may affect several organs. Liver abnormalities are common extraintestinal manifestations of celiac disease. Isolated hypertransaminasemia, with mild or nonspecific histologic changes in the liver biopsy, also known as ''celiac hepatitis'', is the most frequent presentation of liver injury in celiac disease. Both, histologic changes and liver enzymes reverse to normal after treatment with a gluten-free diet in most patients. Celiac disease may also be associated with severe forms of liver disease and/or coexist with other chronic liver disorders (i.e., autoimmune liver diseases). The mechanisms underlying liver injury in celiac disease are poorly understood. Predisposition to autoimmunity by shared genetic factors (i.e., human leukocyte antigen [HLA] genes) as well as the systemic effects of abnormal intestinal permeability, cytokines, autoantibodies, and/or other yet undefined biologic mediators induced by gluten exposure in susceptible persons may play a pathogenic role. The aims of this article are: 1) to review the spectrum of liver injury related to celiac disease and 2) to understand the clinical implications of celiac disease in patients with chronic liver disorders.},

Oat (Avena sativa) is distinct among the cereals due to its multifunctional characteristics and nutritional profile. Recent advancement in food and nutrition has revealed the importance of its various components. It is a good source of dietary fiber especially beta-glucan, minerals and other nutrients. Oat and oat by products have been proven to be helpful in the treatment of diabetes and cardiovascular disorders. Oat bran in particular, is good source of B complex vitamins, protein, fat, minerals besides heart healthy soluble fiber beta-glucan. The beta-glucan has outstanding functional properties and is of immense importance in human nutrition. Different physiological effects of beta-glucan are related to its viscosity, attenuation of postprandial plasma glucose and insulin responses, high transport of bile acids towards lower parts of the intestinal tract and high excretion of bile acids thereby lowering of serum cholesterol levels. Moreover, it is helpful against coeliac disease. The incorporation of oat grains and oat bran in the food products improves not only the nutrition but also a therapy against various maladies.},

   abstract = {Enteropathy defines abnormalities of the small intestinal mucosa of various etiologies in which nutrition has a causal or a therapeutic role. Breast milk is the gold-standard feeding during infancy for optimal nutrition in health and the majority of diseases. Therapeutic formulae have decreased the need for enteral or parenteral support. Gastrointestinal infections are worldwide the most frequent cause of enteropathy by increasing mucosal permeability, local expression of costimulatory molecules allowing antigen penetration in the mucosa, and T-cell activation leading sometimes to disruption of oral tolerance. Concomitant malnutrition impairs not only the immunologic response but also the recovery of damaged mucosa with secondary intestinal and pancreatic enzymatic reductions. Optimal nutritional rehabilitation is the cornerstone of the management of persisting diarrhea. Celiac disease and cow's milk protein allergy are examples of chronic enteropathy. Multiple food allergies, even during breast-feeding, are increasingly reported due to an impaired development of oral tolerance. The dietary approach to allergic disease is currently evolving from passive allergen avoidance to active modulation of the immune system to (re)establish tolerance. The gastrointestinal flora provides maturational signals for the lymphoid tissue, improves balance of inflammatory cytokines, reduces bacterial invasiveness and dietary antigen load, and normalizes gut permeability. The clinical effects of nucleotides and zinc merit further clinical evaluation. Major attention has recently focused on the immune effects of dietary lipids in terms of possible prevention of allergic sensitization by downregulating inflammatory response and protecting the epithelial barrier and host-microbe interactions modifying the adherence of microbes to the mucosa.},

   abstract = {Enteropathy defines abnormalities of the small intestinal mucosa, visible with the light microscope, of various etiologies, that can be separated into acute versus chronic conditions. This review focuses on these areas in which recent progress has been made. Severe infections increase mucosal permeability and induce local expression of co-stimulatory molecules allowing antigen penetration in the mucosa, T cell activation and possible disruption of oral tolerance. Biotherapeutics are of importance in the prevention and treatment of (chronic) enteropathy of infectious origin. Celiac disease and cow's milk protein allergy are key examples of chronic enteropathy. The dietary approach to allergy has evolved to include active stimulation of the immature immune system in order to support the establishment of tolerance. Supplementation with probiotics may provide maturational signals for the lymphoid tissue and improve the balance of pro- and anti-inflammatory cytokines. Enteral polymeric feeding is effective in Crohn's disease. Dietary nucleotides may improve growth and immunity, optimize maturation, recovery and function of rapidly dividing tissue. Adequate dietary lipids are important not just for caloric value but also for immune-modulatory effects. Lipids may prevent allergic sensitization by downregulating inflammatory response (n-3 but not n-6 fatty acids) whilst protecting the epithelial barrier, regulating immune function and modifying the adherence of microbes to the mucosa, thereby contributing to host-microbe interactions.},

   abstract = {Refractory coeliac disease (RCD) is a very rare and dangerous form of CD, in which gluten-free diet loses its therapeutic effect and the damage of intestinal mucosa persists. Because of the adherence to the diet, serological markers of CD [immunoglobulin A (IgA) antibodies against gliadin, tissue transglutaminase (tTG) and endomysium] are often missing in RCD patients. We found substantially elevated levels of IgA anti-calreticulin (CRT) antibodies in the sera of almost all RCD patients tested. These sera were negative for IgA antibodies to gliadin and tTG and only some of them showed IgA antibodies to enterocytes. Analysis of patients' IgA reactivity to CRT fragments (quarters and halves) by Western blotting revealed differences in the specificity of IgA antibodies between RCD and CD patients. We therefore used the Pepscan technique with synthetic overlapping decapeptides of CRT to characterize antigenic epitopes recognized by serum IgA antibodies of RCD patients. Employing this method we demonstrated several dominant antigenic epitopes recognized by IgA antibodies of RCD patients on the CRT molecule. Epitope GVTKAAEKQMKD was recognized predominantly by serum IgA of RCD patients. Our results suggest that testing for serum IgA antibodies against CRT and its selected peptide could be a very useful tool in RCD differential diagnosis.},

   abstract = {A gluten-free diet (GFD) is the sole effective long-lasting treatment of celiac disease. Four monoclonal antibodies (Abs) were prepared by immunization of animals kept on GFD with gliadin. The specificity of these Abs to decapeptides of alpha- and gamma-gliadin and omega-secalin was analyzed by the PEPSCAN technique. Repetitive sequences of alpha- and gamma-gliadin and omega-secalin containing the motifs QPFPXQ (X = Q, L, P) were recognized by all Abs tested. These Abs also frequently reacted with peptides containing the sequences QQSFPQQ, QQTFPQP, and QPFRPQ. On the basis of PEPSCAN results two Abs--8D4 and 7C6--were selected for the construction of a new ELISA kit for the detection of gliadin in food. The comparison of data obtained using the newly developed ELISA kit and commercially available ones indicated that Abs selection on the basis of their fine specificity to gliadin is useful for sensitive detection of gliadin in foods.},

We report a 3-year-old Iraqi girl with malnutrition due to coexisting coeliac and Hartnup's disease. On admission to hospital, she presented with kwashiorkor, anaemia, hepatitis and hypoalbuminia. She had severe skin changes with erythema, desquamation, erosions and diffuse hyperpigmentation involving the whole integument, particularly the perioral area, trunk and legs. She also had angular cheilitis, glossitis, conjunctivitis and diffuse alopecia. After treatment with a high-protein gluten-free diet and supplementation with vitamins and microelements there was a rapid improvement in the skin lesions. The severity of the skin lesions in this case can be explained by the coexistence of two metabolic diseases causing complex malnutrition.},

   abstract = {BACKGROUND: In gluten-sensitive enteropathy, antitissue transglutaminase antibodies are synthesized in the duodenum. AIM: To compare the diagnostic yield of these autoantibodies in cultured duodenal biopsies, duodenal aspirate and serum. METHODS: Patients (n = 315, 135 female, 180 male; age: 37.3 +/- 1.1 years) referred for duodenal biopsies, were recruited and HLA-DQ2/DQ8 haplotyped. Histological measurements were made from duodenal biopsies and cultured duodenal biopsies were used for antitissue transglutaminase antibodies analysis by enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay. Duodenal aspirate was collected in a subgroup of 81 patients. Patients were classified, according to their histology, response to a gluten-free diet and DQ2/DQ8 status, as definite, likely or nongluten-sensitive enteropathy. RESULTS: Histology was normal in 59% of patients; 28% had lymphocytic enteritis, 1% had crypt hyperplasia and 13% showed atrophy. In Marsh III patients, there was complete agreement between duodenal and serological antitissue transglutaminase antibodies measurements. Marsh I patients showed a slight antitissue transglutaminase antibodies sensitivity improvement in cultured duodenal biopsy compared to serum in definite (22% vs. 19%) and likely gluten-sensitive enteropathy (20% vs. 14%) patients. Combined serum and cultured duodenal biopsy antitissue transglutaminase antibodies assessment increased serological sensitivity from 19% to 30% in Marsh I patients. CONCLUSION: Duodenal antitissue transglutaminase antibodies detection improves serological determination sensitivity in Marsh I patients, providing diagnostic value and therapeutic impact.},

   abstract = {Celiac disease is an autoimmune disorder caused by the continued ingestion of gluten, a protein found in wheat, barley and rye, by predisposed individuals. With the development of highly sensitive serologic tests, this has become an increasingly recognized disease with prevalence as high as 1% in certain patient populations, such as Caucasian females. Almost all celiac patients carry the human leukocyte antigen DQ2/DQ8 gene. Much has recently been discovered about the role of the innate immune system in exposing genetically vulnerable patients to the pathogenic gliadin fraction of gluten. The "classical" presentation of chronic diarrhea and malabsorption is now a rarity. Due to earlier detection and increased awareness, celiac disease now presents with a myriad of "atypical" signs and symptoms such as iron-deficiency anemia and osteoporosis. Associated conditions include T-cell lymphoma, dermatitis herpetiformis, autoimmune thyroiditis and type 1 diabetes. Diagnosis requires serologic confirmation with either antiendomysial or antitransglutaminase antibodies as well as histologic confirmation from endoscopic small bowel biopsy. The only effective treatment necessitates a lifelong, continual adherence to a gluten-free diet.},

   abstract = {BACKGROUND AND AIMS: The alpha(2)-gliadin-33mer has been shown to be important in the pathogenesis of coeliac disease. We aimed to study mechanisms of its epithelial translocation and processing in respect to transcytotic and paracellular pathways. METHODS: Transepithelial passage of a fluorescence-labelled alpha(2)-gliadin-33mer was studied in Caco-2 cells by using reverse-phase high-performance liquid chromatography, mass spectrometry, confocal laser scanning microscopy (LSM) and fluorescence activated cell sorting (FACS). Endocytosis mechanisms were characterised with rab-GFP constructs transiently transfected into Caco-2 cells and in human duodenal biopsy specimens. RESULTS: The alpha(2)-gliadin-33mer dose-dependently crossed the epithelial barrier in the apical-to-basal direction. Degradation analysis revealed translocation of the 33mer polypeptide in the uncleaved as well as in the degraded form. Transcellular passage was identified by confocal LSM, inhibitor experiments and FACS. Rab5 but not rab4 or rab7 vesicles were shown to be part of the transcytotic pathway. After pre-incubation with interferon-gamma, translocation of the 33mer was increased by 40%. In mucosal biopsies of the duodenum, epithelial 33mer uptake was significantly higher in untreated coeliac disease patients than in healthy controls or coeliac disease patients on a gluten-free diet. CONCLUSION: Epithelial translocation of the alpha(2)-gliadin-33mer occurs by transcytosis after partial degradation through a rab5 endocytosis compartment and is regulated by interferon-gamma. Uptake of the 33mer is higher in untreated coeliac disease than in controls and coeliac disease patients on a gluten-free diet.},

   abstract = {Although diarrhea is a common complaint, its evaluation and treatment can be challenging. Appropriately defining and classifying diarrhea provide the framework for approaching diagnostic and therapeutic options. Diarrhea can be defined based on frequency, consistency, and/or weight, and classified as acute or chronic with specific clinical characteristics and stool appearance. Colonoscopy is the most common diagnostic tool used in the evaluation of patients with chronic diarrhea. Other evaluation strategies include timed stool collections, evaluation of inflammatory markers, and hydrogen breath tests. A focused workup of chronic diarrhea may yield a specific diagnosis, including diarrhea-predominant IBS (dIBS), functional diarrhea, diabetic diarrhea, bile acid-induced diarrhea, and microscopic colitis. Ideally, therapeutic decisions are specifically tailored to target the underlying pathophysiology, including, for example, gluten restriction for celiac disease, rotating antibiotics for small bowel bacterial overgrowth, budesonide therapy for collagenous colitis, and loperamide for treatment of functional diarrhea. It is also important to assess the role of diet and medications in chronic diarrhea. However, if no specific causes are identified following workup, empiric therapy with simple opiate antidiarrheals such as loperamide may be effective. If this proves unsuccessful, the use of more potent agents, including codeine and opium, may be considered.},

Our aim was to determine the presence of celiac disease and antibodies associated with celiac disease in patients with inflammatory myopathies and to investigate their relationship. Serum antigliadin, anti-tissue transglutaminase, and antiendomysial antibodies were determined in 51 patients with inflammatory myopathies. HLA-DQ2 and -DQ8 alleles were studied to assess their complementary diagnostic value. Jejunal biopsy was performed in patients with moderate to high levels of antigliadin antibodies. Patients with jejunal histology consistent with celiac disease initiated a gluten-free diet. Seventeen patients (31%) were positive for antigliadin antibodies, which were significantly more frequent in patients with inclusion-body myositis than dermatomyositis (P < 0.001). Positive status to HLA-DQ2 and/or -DQ8 did not differ between antigliadin-positive (75% and 12.5%) or -negative (60% and 15%) patients. Three of five jejunal biopsies were diagnostic for celiac disease with histological normalization after a gluten-free diet. Thus, celiac disease is more prevalent in patients with inflammatory myopathies than in the general population. Positive status to HLA-DQ2 allele, which is known to be more frequent in patients with inflammatory myopathies, could explain the high prevalence of antigliadin antibodies in this population. The diagnostic value of HLA-DQ2 or -DQ8 haplotypes to detect celiac disease in patients with inflammatory myopathy is limited.},

   abstract = {Celiac disease is an autoimmune disorder occurring in genetically susceptible individuals, triggered by gluten and related prolamins. Well identified haplotypes in the human leukocyte antigen (HLA) class II region (either DQ2 [DQA*0501-DQB*0201] or DQ8 [DQA*0301-DQB1*0302]) confer a large part of the genetic susceptibility to celiac disease.Celiac disease originates as a result of a combined action involving both adaptive and innate immunity. The adaptive immune response to gluten has been well described, with the identification of specific peptide sequences demonstrating HLA-DQ2 or -DQ8 restrictive binding motifs across various gluten proteins. As for innate immunity, through specific natural killer receptors expressed on their surface, intra-epithelial lymphocytes recognize nonclassical major histocompatibility complex (MHC)-I molecules such as MICA, which are induced on the surface of enterocytes by stress and inflammation, and this interaction leads to their activation to become lymphokine-activated killing cells. Four possible presentations of celiac disease are recognized: (i) typical, characterized mostly by gastrointestinal signs and symptoms; (ii) atypical or extraintestinal, where gastrointestinal signs/symptoms are minimal or absent and a number of other manifestations are present; (iii) silent, where the small intestinal mucosa is damaged and celiac disease autoimmunity can be detected by serology, but there are no symptoms; and, finally, (iv) latent, where individuals possess genetic compatibility with celiac disease and may also show positive autoimmune serology, that have a normal mucosa morphology and may or may not be symptomatic.The diagnosis of celiac disease still rests on the demonstration of changes in the histology of the small intestinal mucosa. The classic celiac lesion occurs in the proximal small intestine with histologic changes of villous atrophy, crypt hyperplasia, and increased intraepithelial lymphocytosis. Currently, serological screening tests are utilized primarily to identify those individuals in need of a diagnostic endoscopic biopsy. The serum levels of immunoglobulin (Ig)A anti-tissue transglutaminase (or TG2) are the first choice in screening for celiac disease, displaying the highest levels of sensitivity (up to 98%) and specificity (around 96%). Anti-endomysium antibodies-IgA (EMA), on the other hand, have close to 100% specificity and a sensitivity of greater than 90%. The interplay between gliadin peptides and TG2 is responsible for the generation of novel antigenic epitopes, the TG2-generated deamidated gliadin peptides. Such peptides represent much more celiac disease-specific epitopes than native peptides, and deamidated gliadin antibodies (DGP) have shown promising results as serological markers for celiac disease. Serology has also been employed in monitoring the response to a gluten-free diet.Despite the gluten-free diet being so effective, there is a growing demand for alternative treatment options. In the future, new forms of treatment may include the use of gluten-degrading enzymes to be ingested with meals, the development of alternative, gluten-free grains by genetic modification, the use of substrates regulating intestinal permeability to prevent gluten entry across the epithelium, and, finally, the availability of different forms of immunotherapy.},

Articles on known and potential human factors capable of producing susceptibility to NTM lung disease (NTMLD) were identified by a systematic search of the medical literature, and are reviewed in the present study. Patients with pre-existing structural lung disease are known to be at risk of NTMLD. Other susceptible groups have become recognised since the 1980s, in particular middle-aged nonsmokers without previous lung disease (a group including those with Lady Windermere syndrome) and patients with genetically determined defects of cell-mediated immunity, including abnormalities of the interleukin-12/interferon-gamma axis, certain human leukocyte antigen alleles, cystic fibrosis transmembrane conductance regulator mutations, and polymorphisms of solute carrier 11A1 (or natural resistance-associated macrophage protein 1) and the vitamin D receptor. Information is also accruing about acquired systemic causes of susceptibility to NTMLD, including inhibitory antibodies directed against interferon-gamma, post-menopausal waning of endogenous oestrogen levels, coeliac disease and exposure to use of dietary phyto-oestrogens. It is not known whether immunosuppressive factors, such as oral corticosteroid treatment, chronic renal failure, diabetes mellitus and other known risk factors for pulmonary tuberculosis, are also risk factors for the development of NTMLD. Caution is appropriate in managing such patients.},

The study included 55 children and adolescents with a mean age of 10.0 +/- 4.61 years (2-19 years). Mucocutaneous manifestations were evaluated with respect to age, gender, duration of illness, and of gluten-free diet and compliance with this diet. Cutaneous, mucosal, nail, and hair findings were detected in 74.5%, 27.3%, 20.0%, and 7.3% of patients, respectively. The most prevalent dermatologic diagnosis was xerosis (69.1%). No significant relationship was detected between the cutaneous findings and the duration of illness (p > 0.05). However, the duration was longer in patients with mucosal findings compared to those without mucosal findings (p < 0.05). It was found that all patients without cutaneous findings were on a strict gluten-free diet (p < 0.05). Ours is one of the few studies describing skin findings in children with celiac disease. We believe that both pediatricians and dermatologists should be aware of the various mucocutaneous manifestations of celiac disease, because a careful skin, mucosa, nail, and hair examination may lead to a diagnosis of celiac disease, particularly in atypical presentations.},

This study covers a population of 94 menarcheal adolescents with untreated CD, whose MA was compared with that of 3 control populations: the 1st consisting of 117 early-treated and compliant CD girls, the 2nd represented by their non-celiac mothers, and the 3rd consisting of 280 healthy adolescents. Average MA of the girls with post-menarcheal diagnosis of CD was superimposable to that of the patients with pre-menarcheal diagnosis and was no different from the one of their mothers or that of healthy controls. The prevalence of delayed menarche was similar in the patients with either pre-menarcheal or post-menarcheal diagnosis of CD. A direct correlation between patients' MA and that of their mothers was detected in both groups of CD patients. We conclude that: a) untreated CD may not be associated with menarcheal retardation; b) MA in CD is significantly affected by maternal MA and may be irrespective of age at diagnosis and dietary management.},

The aim of the present study was to examine how the screening results and the diagnosis of CD affected these patients' lifestyle and attitude toward CD. METHODS: All subjects with positive serology for CD (n = 59) found in the previous study of healthy blood donors (n = 1571) were contacted and interviewed. Data collected included current and previous symptoms compatible with CD, medical follow up since being informed of positive serology for CD and adherence to gluten-free diet (GFD). Information was obtained regarding attitude towards the screening for CD, the results of the screening, and the effect of screening on subjects' lifestyle. RESULTS: Of the 59 subjects, 51 were available for telephone interview, including all 10 subjects diagnosed with CD (positive serology and biopsy), 17/20 with positive serology and normal intestinal mucosa, and 24/29 with positive serology who refused to undergo intestinal biopsy. Of the 10 patients diagnosed with CD, four adhere to GFD. Only 1/17 subjects with normal intestinal mucosa repeated serology. Two of the 24 who initially refused a biopsy, underwent an intestinal biopsy, and one of them was currently diagnosed with CD. Only one patient diagnosed with CD had all his family members screened for CD. CONCLUSIONS: The data suggest that many of the patients identified in this screened population do not ultimately benefit from the purpose of the screening, which was early identification and treatment of a common disease with potential serious consequences.},

We conducted this study to compare non-diarrheal and diarrheal presentations of CD in children. METHODS: From November 2003 to December 2005, we prospectively screened two groups of children for CD, group I with diarrhea and group II without diarrhea but with atypical presentations (unexplained growth retardation, refractory anemia, refractory rickets, chronic constipation and abdominal distension). Screening was done with IgA antiendomysial antibody (EMA) followed by duodenal biopsy if EMA was positive. Celiac disease was diagnosed according to modified ESPGHAN criteria. RESULTS: A total of 200 children were screened (103 in group I and 97 in group II) and CD was diagnosed in 42 (classical 24, atypical 18). Presentation of atypical CD were; short stature 6, anemia 4, abdominal distension 3, rickets 2, and constipation, diabetes mellitus, delayed puberty in 1 case each. Patients with atypical CD were older (median age 10.4 years vs 5.5 years, p< 0.007) than classical cases. On mean (SD) follow-up of 12.6 (7.5) months all showed response to gluten-free-diet, and median gain in weight, height and final hemoglobin levels were similar in the two groups. CONCLUSION: Atypical CD is not uncommon in India. Children with atypical CD present at an older age. Likelihood of finding CD is high in children with anemia, short stature and rickets.},

Investigations into the molecular pathogenesis of celiac sprue have identified the major histocompatibility complex protein HLA-DQ2 and the multi-functional enzyme transglutaminase 2 as potential pharmacological targets. Based upon the crystal structure of HLA-DQ2, we rationally designed an aldehyde-functionalized, gluten peptide analogue as a tight-binding HLA-DQ2 ligand. Aldehyde-bearing gluten peptide analogues were also designed as high-affinity, reversible inhibitors of transglutaminase 2. By varying the side-chain length of the aldehyde-functionalized amino acid, we found that the optimal transglutaminase 2 inhibitor was 5 methylene units in length, 2 carbon atoms longer than its natural glutamine substrate.},

METHODS: Three varieties of oats were tested by two in vitro assay based on the known ability of peptic-tryptic digests of coeliac-active proteins to agglutinate K562 cells and to disrupt lysosomes, respectively. RESULTS: Avenins from the Italian variety Astra and the Australian variety Mortlook were much more active than the Australian variety Lampton. Gliadin, digested in the same way, certainly displayed more activity than all three avenins, but rice (var. Roma) did not have measurable activity. CONCLUSIONS: The results indicate that some varieties of oats may be potentially harmful to individuals with coeliac disease and therefore should be excluded from the gluten-free diet required to maintain good health in coeliac disease. It is important to realize that constant, small amounts of active proteins in the diet, such as certain avenins, may prevent complete recovery of the intestinal mucosa in this disease.},

If oats is confirmed to be safe, it would be a valuable component and offer more variation in a gluten-free diet. The aim of this work was to evaluate whether avenins from different varieties of oats show different abilities in the activation of coeliac peripheral lymphocytes. MATERIAL AND METHODS: In order to assess whether the immunogenic effect of oats varies according to the cultivar, peripheral lymphocytes from 10 coeliac children were exposed to avenins from four different oats varieties: Lampton, Astra, Ava and Nave. Lymphocyte proliferation and interferon-gamma (IFN-gamma) release in the culture medium were measured as indexes of immune activation. RESULTS: All the varieties of oats tested were immunogenic, with Lampton and Ava avenins inducing lymphocyte activation similar to that activated by wheat gliadin, while Astra and Nave avenins showed less immunogenicity, but still with a measurable effect. CONCLUSIONS: There are still concerns about the suitability of including oats in a gluten-free diet. Coeliac patients consuming oats-containing food should be carefully monitored, until there is more evidence to show the safety of oats and varieties of low-toxicity oats.},

Molecules able to shift the immune response from a Th1- to a Th2-type response have been suggested as therapeutic agents for Th1 autoimmune diseases. OBJECTIVE: We sought to investigate the possibility that a decapeptide from durum wheat (p10mer, QQPQDAVQPF), which was previously shown to prevent the activation of celiac peripheral lymphocytes, may promote a shift from a Th1- to a Th2-type immune response in gluten-specific intestinal T cells of CD patients. DESIGN: Intestinal T lymphocyte lines derived from 8 children with CD were incubated with gliadin peptides both alone and simultaneously with p10mer. Cell proliferation and the production of interferon-gamma and interleukin-10 by these T cells were measured. RESULTS: The incubation of celiac intestinal T cells with deamidated gliadin peptides resulted in a significant (P < 0.008) increase in cell proliferation and interferon-gamma release, whereas the simultaneous exposure to p10mer totally abolished the cell proliferation and cytokine release. Moreover, incubation with p10mer maintained an elevated release of interleukin-10, whereas exposure of the cells to culture medium only did not. The replacement of the residues of aspartic acid in position 5 or those of alanine in position 6 in the sequence of p10mer resulted in peptides with no activity in the activation experiments. CONCLUSION: In vitro, p10mer showed the ability to shift the pathogenic immune response of a CD patient from a Th1- to a Th2-type response.},

The risk of developing an intestinal lymphoma for the celiac patients that used to have dietary gluten was significant (X(2 )= 4.8 P = 0.01).

   abstract = {INTRODUCTION: Celiac disease can be treated by following a strict gluten-free diet for life. If properly followed, the diet resolves symptoms and nutritional deficiencies. It is generally recommended that individuals with celiac disease have careful long-term follow-up. However, it is not clear which elements of disease status evaluation, laboratory investigations and self-management support should be included in follow-up. OBJECTIVES: To examine the current practice guidelines and recommendations regarding follow-up of individuals with celiac disease. METHODS: Guidelines issued by gastroenterological societies and associations, and recommendations by experts were retrieved using Medline and other Internet search engines. RESULTS: Practice guidelines were available from the American Gastroenterological Association; the North American Society for Pediatric Gastroenterology, Hepatology and Nutrition; the National Institutes of Health Consensus Development Conference 2004; the World Gastroenterology Organization; the British Society for Gastroenterology and the United Kingdom-based Primary Care Society for Gastroenterology. Most guidelines recommended a scheduled annual review and regular measurements of body mass index. The British Society for Gastroenterology recommended dietary review only at times of stress, while others recommended dietary review with a nutritionist. All associations recommended serial tissue transglutaminase antibody testing. The American Gastroenterological Association and the Primary Care Society for Gastroenterology recommended annual hemoglobin, ferritin and folate checks. One guideline recommended annual hemoglobin, electrolyte, calcium, albumin, ferritin, folate, fat-soluble vitamin, liver function test, parathyroid hormone and bone density measurements (approximately $400 per patient). CONCLUSIONS: The current practice guidelines regarding the follow-up of patients with celiac disease varied greatly in their recommendations and many were not evidence-based. Prospective studies are required to develop rational, cost-effective and risk-stratified guidelines for long-term follow-up of these patients.},

   abstract = {OBJECTIVES: To explore the natural history of antibodies against tissue transglutaminase (TGA), endomysium (EMA), reticulin (ARA), and gliadin (AGA-IgG and AGA-IgA) in children carrying HLA-conferred risk for celiac disease (CD) and observed frequently from birth. METHODS: TGA was measured in serum samples obtained between years 2000 and 2003 from 1,320 children carrying genetic CD risk. If a sample was TGA positive, all five antibodies were analyzed in all banked and forthcoming samples from that child, and a duodenal biopsy was recommended. At the end of this observation, in August 2004, the age of the children was from 1 to 9.5 yr (mean 4.1 yr). RESULTS: Forty-nine children (3.7%) were TGA positive. In these children, AGA-IgG had emerged at the mean age (+/- SD, range) of 2.0 +/- 1.5, 0.5-6.6 yr, while TGA, EMA, and ARA all emerged concurrently somewhat later (TGA at 3.2 +/- 1.5, 1.0-7.0 yr, P < 0.001 when compared to AGA-IgG). Despite continuing gluten exposure, positive TGA, EMA, ARA, AGA-IgA, and AGA-IgG values were spontaneously lost in 49%, 45%, 43%, 41%, and 32% of the children, respectively. CD was diagnosed by biopsy in 20 of the 26 TGA-positive children who consented to a biopsy. CONCLUSIONS: Potential CD trigger(s) other than only gluten probably function before AGA-IgG emerges, i.e., > or =3 months earlier than the transglutaminase-associated antibodies appear. In a remarkable proportion of the children, antibodies disappear spontaneously suggesting that regulatory immune phenomena under favorable circumstances are able to extinguish incipient CD in genetically at-risk children even without exclusion of gluten from the diet.},

   abstract = {BACKGROUND AND AIM: There is paucity of prospective data on association between cervical esophageal webs and celiac disease. It is not clear whether all patients with cervical esophageal web need screening for celiac disease. Hence, the present study was carried out to determine the association of cervical esophageal web with celiac disease. METHODS: This prospective study included consecutive patients with symptomatic cervical esophageal web diagnosed over a period of 4.5 years. Tissue transglutaminase antibody was measured in serum of each patient. Patients with elevated tissue transglutaminase antibody titer were subjected to esophagogastroduodenoscopy and biopsies were obtained from the descending duodenum to look for histological changes of celiac disease. Esophageal web was treated with bougie dilatation. Celiac disease was diagnosed on the basis of elevated tissue transglutaminase antibody and suggestive duodenal histology. RESULTS: Twenty one patients were diagnosed to have cervical esophageal web. Eighteen (85.7%) had evidence of iron deficiency. Five (23.8%) patients with cervical esophageal web fulfilled criteria for diagnosis of celiac disease. All five had evidence of iron deficiency. None of these patients gave a history of chronic diarrhea. All patients were treated with bougie dilatation. Patients with celiac disease were advised of a gluten-free diet. All five celiac disease patients are free of dysphagia without recurrence after a mean follow up of 10 months (range: 3 to 16 months). CONCLUSIONS: There is association between cervical esophageal web and celiac disease. All adult patients with cervical esophageal web and iron deficiency need screening for celiac disease even in the absence of chronic diarrhea.},

   abstract = {BACKGROUND: Two inflammatory disorders, type 1 diabetes and celiac disease, cosegregate in populations, suggesting a common genetic origin. Since both diseases are associated with the HLA class II genes on chromosome 6p21, we tested whether non-HLA loci are shared. METHODS: We evaluated the association between type 1 diabetes and eight loci related to the risk of celiac disease by genotyping and statistical analyses of DNA samples from 8064 patients with type 1 diabetes, 9339 control subjects, and 2828 families providing 3064 parent-child trios (consisting of an affected child and both biologic parents). We also investigated 18 loci associated with type 1 diabetes in 2560 patients with celiac disease and 9339 control subjects. RESULTS: Three celiac disease loci--RGS1 on chromosome 1q31, IL18RAP on chromosome 2q12, and TAGAP on chromosome 6q25--were associated with type 1 diabetes (P<1.00x10(-4)). The 32-bp insertion-deletion variant on chromosome 3p21 was newly identified as a type 1 diabetes locus (P=1.81x10(-8)) and was also associated with celiac disease, along with PTPN2 on chromosome 18p11 and CTLA4 on chromosome 2q33, bringing the total number of loci with evidence of a shared association to seven, including SH2B3 on chromosome 12q24. The effects of the IL18RAP and TAGAP alleles confer protection in type 1 diabetes and susceptibility in celiac disease. Loci with distinct effects in the two diseases included INS on chromosome 11p15, IL2RA on chromosome 10p15, and PTPN22 on chromosome 1p13 in type 1 diabetes and IL12A on 3q25 and LPP on 3q28 in celiac disease. CONCLUSIONS: A genetic susceptibility to both type 1 diabetes and celiac disease shares common alleles. These data suggest that common biologic mechanisms, such as autoimmunity-related tissue damage and intolerance to dietary antigens, may be etiologic features of both diseases.},

   abstract = {The understanding of the pathogenesis of celiac disease has made huge advances in recent years. The disease is caused by an inappropriate immune response to dietary gluten proteins. This immune response is controlled by CD4(+) T cells in the lamina propria that recognize gluten peptides in the context of disease predisposing HLA-DQ2 and HLA-DQ8 molecules.(1, 2) These T cells are specific for proline- and glutamine-rich gluten peptides that are resistant to proteolysis and that have been become deamidated by the enzyme transglutaminase 2 (TG2). Strikingly, celiac disease patients produce antibodies to this same enzyme when exposed to dietary gluten. Here we discuss how the new insight in the pathogenesis has lead to development of new diagnostics and nourished research into novel treatments.},

RESULTS: We report three patients with biopsy-proven CD who developed cerebellar ataxia and neuropathic pain despite strict adherence to a gluten-free diet. A small fiber neuropathy was suggested by skin biopsy findings in two patients. All patients' symptoms, including small fiber neuropathy symptoms, responded to treatment with intravenous immunoglobulin (IVIG). Discontinuation of IVIG in two patients resulted in worsened ataxia that reversed after resumption of IVIG. CONCLUSION: Intravenous immunoglobulin may be effective in treating cerebellar ataxia and small fiber neuropathy associated with CD, suggesting an immune pathogenesis. Further prospective, controlled studies are necessary to determine the long-term response to IVIG or other immunomodulation therapy.},

   abstract = {BACKGROUND: Patients with autoimmune thyroid diseases (AITDs) are prone to develop other autoimmune manifestations and to display autoimmune polyendocrine syndromes. An increased prevalence of celiac disease (CD) was demonstrated in adult European and Italian patients with AITDs; conversely, an increased prevalence of AITDs was demonstrated in patients with CD. An IgA deficiency is the most frequent immunodeficiency in humans and, in general, high frequency of this disorder was demonstrated in those with autoimmune diseases. AIM: To define the prevalence of both CD and IgA deficiency in North Italian patients with AITDs. METHODS: 276 Italian patients with AITD were enrolled (mean age 42.6 years range 12-89, 186 of whom had chronic thyroiditis and 90 had Graves' disease). The tissue transglutaminase autoantibodies of the IgA class (IgA-tTGAbs) were evaluated using an ELISA method in these patients. Furthermore, the serological levels of the IgA were determined. RESULTS: Five of the patients (1.8%) were affected by previously diagnosed CD and were on a gluten-free diet. Ten out of the remaining 271 patients (3.6%) were found to be positive for celiac-related autoantibodies. All of these patients agreed to undergo endoscopy and duodenal biopsies and silent CD was found in 5 of them but 5 had not histopathological signs of CD. CD (clinical, silent or latent) was present in 15/276 (5.4%) of the North Italian patients with AITD; this prevalence is significantly higher with respect to the general population (p < 0.00001). The genetic pattern of the 10 patients with both AITDs and CD was characterized by the presence of DQ2 in 8 patients and DQ8 in 2. An IgA deficiency was present in 2/276 of the patients (0.72%). CONCLUSIONS: CD is significantly increased in patients with thyroid autoimmune disorders for this reason it is important to screen for CD in patients with AITDs.},

   abstract = {Serotonin is widely distributed throughout the gut within both the enteric nerves and enterochromaffin (EC) cells. EC cells are located in the gut mucosa with maximal numbers in the duodenum and rectum where they act as signal transducers, responding to pressure and luminal substances both bacterial and dietary. Activation leads to serotonin release which acts on a range of receptors on mucosal afferent and myenteric interneurones to initiate secretomotor reflexes. These cause nausea and vomiting as well as intestinal secretion, propulsion and if pronounced, diarrhoea. Inflammation in animal models acts via T lymphocytes to increase EC cell numbers and mucosal serotonin (5-HT) content while inflammatory cytokines decrease serotonin transporter (SERT) function. Inflammation due to coeliac disease and following gastrointestinal infection increases mucosal 5-HT availability by a combination of increased EC cells and depressed SERT. Irritable bowel syndrome (IBS) developing after gastrointestinal infection and IBS with diarrhoea is associated with excess 5-HT. The associated diarrhoeal symptoms respond well to 5-HT(3) receptor antagonists. These drugs also inhibit the nausea and vomiting occurring in patients undergoing chemotherapy which cause a marked increase in release of 5-HT as well as other mediators. Other conditions including IBS-C and constipation may have inadequate 5-HT release and benefit from both 5-HT(3) and 5-HT(4) receptor agonists.},

   abstract = {BACKGROUND: In celiac disease gluten, the disease-inducing toxic component in wheat, induces the secretion of autoantibodies which are targeted against transglutaminase 2 (TG2). These autoantibodies are produced in the small-intestinal mucosa, where they can be found deposited extracellularly below the epithelial basement membrane and around mucosal blood vessels. In addition, during gluten consumption these autoantibodies can also be detected in patients' serum but disappear from the circulation on a gluten-free diet. Interestingly, after adoption of a gluten-free diet the serum autoantibodies disappear from the circulation more rapidly than the small-intestinal mucosal autoantibody deposits. The toxicity of gluten and the secretion of the disease-specific autoantibodies have been widely studied in organ culture of small-intestinal biopsy samples, but results hitherto have been contradictory. Since the mucosal autoantibodies disappear slowly after a gluten-free diet, our aim was to establish whether autoantibody secretion to organ culture supernatants in treated celiac disease patient biopsies is related to the duration of the diet and further to the pre-existence of mucosal TG2-specific IgA deposits in the cultured biopsy samples. RESULTS: In the organ culture system conducted with biopsies derived from treated celiac disease patients, gliadin induced secretion of autoantibodies to culture supernatants, reduced epithelial cell height and increased the density of lamina proprial CD25+ cells. However, these changes could be demonstrated only in biopsies from short-term treated celiac disease patients, where the small-intestinal mucosal TG2-specific IgA autoantibody deposits were still present. Furthermore, in these biopsies autoantibody secretion could be stimulated fully only after a 48-hour gliadin challenge. CONCLUSION: Our results show that studies focusing on the toxic effects of gliadin in the organ culture system should be carried out with biopsy samples from short-term treated celiac disease patients who are likely still to have mucosal IgA deposits present. In addition to providing an explanation for the discrepancies in previous publications, the present study also enables further validation of the organ culture method.},

   abstract = {Celiac disease is an enteropathy caused by intolerance to dietary gluten. The disorder is strongly associated with DQA1*0501/DQB1*0201 (HLA-DQ2) as approximately 95% of celiac patients express this molecule. HLA-DQ2 has unique Ag-binding properties that allow it to present a diverse set of gluten peptides to gluten-reactive CD4+ T cells so instigating an inflammatory reaction. Previous work has indicated that the presence of negatively charged amino acids within gluten peptides is required for specific binding. This, however, only partly explains the scale of the interaction. We have now characterized 432 natural ligands of HLA-DQ2 representing length variants of 155 distinct sequences. The sequences were aligned and the binding cores were inferred. Analysis of the amino acid distribution of these cores demonstrated that negatively charged residues in HLA-DQ2-bound peptides are favored at virtually all positions. This contrasts with a more restricted presence of such amino acids in T cell epitopes from gluten. Yet, HLA-DQ2 was also found to display a strong preference for proline at several anchor and nonanchor positions that largely match the position of proline in gluten T cell epitopes. Consequently, the bias for proline at p6 and p8 facilitates the enzymatic conversion of glutamine into glutamic acid in gluten peptides at p4 and p6, two important anchor sites. These observations provide new insights in the unique ability of HLA-DQ2 to bind a large repertoire of glutamine- and proline-rich gluten peptides. This knowledge may be an important asset in the development of future treatment strategies.},

   abstract = {PURPOSE: The treatment of celiac disease is a strict gluten-free diet for life. This diet is assumed to be more expensive, although no studies confirm this assumption. In the current study, the prices of gluten-free foods and regular (gluten-containing) foods were compared to determine if and to what extent gluten-free products are more expensive. METHODS: Prices were compared for all food products labelled "gluten-free" and comparable gluten-containing food items in the same group available at two large-chain general grocery stores. The unit cost of each food, calculated as the price in dollars per 100 grams of each product, was calculated for purposes of comparison. RESULTS: All 56 gluten-free products were more expensive than regular products. The mean (+/- standard deviation) unit price for gluten-free products was $1.71 (+/- 0.93) compared with $0.61 (+/- 0.38) for regular products (p<0.0001). On average, gluten-free products were 242% more expensive than regular products (+/- 212; range, 5% to 1,000%). CONCLUSIONS: All the commercially available products labelled gluten-free were significantly more expensive than comparable products. This information will be useful to dietitians who counsel individuals and families with celiac disease, and to celiac advocacy groups for lobbying the government about financial compensation.},

   abstract = {BACKGROUND: Oxidative stress has been implicated in the pathogenesis of coeliac disease. The aim of this study was to examine the modulation of the biochemical response to oxidative stress in untreated and treated coeliac disease. METHODS: The study involved peripheral blood samples from 39 paediatric patients (18 with active, 11 with silent form of the disease, 10 on gluten-free diet [GFD]) and 30 control subjects. The activities of superoxide dismutase (SOD), catalase (CAT), glutathione peroxidase (GPx) and glutathione reductase (GR), as well as the concentrations of total glutathione (GSH) and lipid hydroperoxides (LOOH) were determined in patients and controls. RESULTS: In comparison to the controls, a significant increase in SOD activity was found in the active group (P<0.05), while CAT activity was elevated in GFD group (P<0.05). GPx activity was lower in patients than in controls (active and silent, P<0.001; GFD, P<0.01). GSH contents were significantly reduced in all patient groups (P<0.001) as well, while the concentration of LOOH was elevated in active and silent group (P<0.001). The concentration of LOOH correlated negatively with the activity of GPx (r = -0.32, P<0.01) and the concentration of GSH (r = -0.70, P<0.001). A significant positive correlation was found between the concentration of GSH and the activity of GPx (r = 0.57, P<0.001). CONCLUSIONS: The results show evidence of increased oxidative stress in untreated coeliac disease. Although LOOH were not significantly elevated in the GFD group, changes in antioxidant enzyme activities and GSH content demonstrate that oxidative stress persists even in treated patients.},

PATIENTS: Twenty patients were enrolled at diagnosis (9 male, 11 female; age 9.6 +/- 0.8 years). A healthy population of 18 subjects (5 male, 13 female; age 11.3 +/- 0.6 years) comparable for age, sex and pubertal status served as controls at baseline. MEASUREMENTS: Blood samples were taken at diagnosis, and at 6 months and 12 months after starting the GFD. Serum IGF-I, IGF-II, IGFBP-1, IGFBP-2, IGFBP-3, IL-6 and TNF-alpha were measured using commercial kits. Height (Ht) standard deviation score (SDS), body mass index (BMI) SDS and Ht velocity SDS were evaluated at diagnosis and at 6 months and 12 months after starting GFD. RESULTS: In CD patients, both Ht SDS and BMI SDS increased during the first year of treatment, and Ht velocity SDS increased during the second 6 months of follow-up (P < 0.05). At diagnosis, IGF-I, IGF-II and IGFBP-3 were lower compared with controls, IGFBP-1 was similar, IGFBP-2, IL-6 and TNF-alpha were higher (P < 0.05). When on GFD, all peptides normalized and IGFBP-1 decreased. The IGF-I/IGFBP-2 and IGF-I/IGFBP-3 molar ratios were significantly reduced at diagnosis compared with those of controls, but were increased for both groups when on GFD. Although there was no apparent abnormality at diagnosis, the IGF-II/IGFBP-2 molar ratio increased significantly on GFD. Ht velocity SDS was positively correlated with IGFBP-3 (P < 0.05) and with the IGF-I/IGFBP-2 molar ratio (P < 0.05). Serum IL-6 was negatively correlated with IGF-I and positively with IGFBP-1 (P < 0.05). CONCLUSIONS: The data obtained from this study confirm changes in the IGF and cytokine systems at diagnosis of CD which tend to normalize on the gluten-free diet. The two systems show relationships with each other and with linear growth.},

AIMS: To compare the clinical features in patients with CD detected via family screening with those in patients diagnosed routinely. METHODS: Information on screening was provided to relatives of patients. Those who wished to be screened were tested for endomysial and/or tissue transglutaminase antibodies. Duodenal biopsy was performed in those with positive antibodies. The clinical details of the relative screening group were compared with those of 105 patients diagnosed routinely. RESULTS: 183 relatives underwent screening, of whom 32 had positive serology, 24 had histology diagnostic of CD, six had normal biopsies and two declined duodenal biopsy. Patients in the relative screening group were younger with a median age of 33 years (range 17-72 years) compared to the routine group which had a median age of 54 years (range 25-88 years). In the relative screening group, there was a male preponderance (M:F ratio 16:8), anaemia at presentation was significantly less common (13% v 58%; p<0.001) and osteoporosis was less frequent (9% v 22%; p<0.244) compared with the routine group. 65% of the relative screening group had gastrointestinal symptoms or anaemia at diagnosis. CONCLUSIONS: Patients detected by family screening are younger with a male preponderance, but fewer had anaemia and osteoporosis.},

   abstract = {BACKGROUND: Several studies indicate the importance of social support in the case of chronic disease. AIM: The aim was to explore dilemmas experienced by close relatives living with a person suffering from coeliac disease, and to describe the strategies they used to deal with these dilemmas. METHODS: Twenty-three informants were interviewed. A systematic inductive qualitative method, the critical incident technique was used. RESULTS: Disease-related worries included having bad conscience about not being affected by the disease, experiencing anxiety and witnessing the vulnerability of the affected relative in social situations. Dilemmas related to manage daily life were connected with increased domestic work, restricted freedom of action and the diseased person's preferential right of interpretation of health risks associated with the coeliac disease and deviations from the diet restrictions. Dilemmas related to disturbances in social life, concerned lack of information, knowledge and understanding. Different strategies were described to manage daily life. CONCLUSIONS: Close relatives experienced a variety of dilemmas that affected the situation of the whole family. The role of relatives in handling the coeliac disease with the diseased person in the everyday life might be underestimated, and to provide relatives with better knowledge regarding the disease might improve the situation also for patients.},

Because of an increased risk for autoimmune diseases and lymphoma, accurate diagnosis and treatment are imperative. We present a case of DH in a 6-year-old Latino boy previously diagnosed with atopic dermatitis and recurrent urticaria. Our aim is to highlight the various cutaneous presentations of DH and encourage clinicians to consider this diagnosis in young patients with recalcitrant atypical skin disease.},

We demonstrate that gliadin prevents immature dendritic cells (iDCs) elimination by NK cells. Furthermore, cooperation between human NK cells-iDCs and T cells increases IFN-gamma production of anti-gliadin immune response. Gliadin fractions were analyzed for their capability to stabilize HLA-E molecules. The alpha and omega fractions conferred the protection from NK cell lysis to iDCs and increased their HLA-E expression. Gliadin pancreatic enzyme digest and a peptide derived from gliadin alpha increased HLA-E levels on murine RMA-S/HLA-E-transfected cells. Analysis of HLA-E expression in the small intestinal mucosa of gluten-containing diet celiac patients and organ culture experiments confirmed the in vitro data.},

   abstract = {A standardized method of analysis is needed to quantitatively determine the gluten content of food and provide the basis for enforcing regulations regarding use of the term gluten-free in food labeling. People with celiac disease should feel confident that foods labeled "gluten-free" have been assessed for gluten using the same "best available" methodology. The Association of Analytical Communities and the Codex Alimentarius Commission endorse different methods. Both are used by manufacturers in the United States to determine the gluten-free status of food. The sandwich omega-gliadin enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay (ELISA) is the official method of the Association of Analytical Communities. It is able to quantify native and heated gluten. It is unable to accurately detect and quantify barley prolamins, can over- or underestimate gluten content, and cannot accurately quantify hydrolyzed gluten. The sandwich R5 ELISA was endorsed by Codex for gluten determination. It is able to quantify native and heated gluten. One criticism is that it overestimates barley hordein. It also is unable to accurately quantify hydrolyzed gluten. Foods that can be reliably assessed for gluten using a validated commercially available ELISA are those contaminated with native and heated proteins from wheat, barley, and rye. The degree of confidence that can be placed in a manufacturer's assertion that a product is gluten-free is based on the assay used to determine the gluten content and the specific food analyzed.},

   abstract = {OBJECTIVE: In celiac disease (CD), enteropathy of the small bowel results from a T-cell-mediated reaction to gluten in the diet. In addition to gluten, other environmental and genetic factors participate in the disease pathogenesis. We have recently reported the finding of a significantly different short-chain fatty acid (SCFA) profile in fecal samples from children with CD compared to healthy controls reflecting an aberrant gut microflora. The aim of the present study was to make a functional evaluation of the gut microflora status in non-celiac 1st degree relatives of children with CD. MATERIAL AND METHODS: Fecal samples from 76 symptom-free, non-celiac, 1st degree CD relatives and from 91 aged-matched healthy controls were analyzed for fecal tryptic activity (FTA) and a number of SCFAs. RESULTS: There was a significantly lower level of acetic acid and total SCFAs as well as a significantly increased level of i-butyric acid and FTA in relatives compared to healthy controls. CONCLUSIONS: The FTA and the SCFA profiles in fecal samples from 1st degree relatives of children with CD are different from those of healthy individuals. The implication of this observation provides insight into the pathogenesis of CD and opens up the possibility of future new diagnostic, therapeutic and prophylactic strategies.},

MATERIAL AND METHODS: ASCA, IgG and IgA were determined by ELISA in sera of 238 coeliac patients. The patients were divided into three groups: group I - 125 untreated patients; group II - 42 patients under a strict gluten-free diet (GFD); and group III - 71 patients who did not comply with a GFD. Sera of 80 healthy blood donors served as controls. RESULTS: The frequency of ASCA (IgG or IgA) was significantly higher in untreated coeliac patients than in the control group (27.2% versus 3.7%, p=10(-5)). In 238 coeliac patients, the frequency of ASCA was significantly higher in adults than in children (35.4% versus 21.1%, p=0.01). In group III, the frequency of ASCA was significantly higher in adults than in children (60% versus 26.1%, p=0.004). In 238 coeliac patients, ASCA IgG were significantly more frequent than ASCA IgA in both children (19% versus 6.3%, p=0.001) and adults (33.3% versus 12.5%, p=5.10(-4)). In children, ASCA IgG were negative in group II and positive in 20% of group I (p=0.01). In adults, the frequency of ASCA IgG was also significantly lower in group II than in group I (9.5% versus 34%, p=0.03). CONCLUSIONS: A high frequency of ASCA has been found in coeliac patients. The frequency of ASCA was not statistically different between patients with successful adherence to GFD and healthy controls.},

   abstract = {PURPOSE OF REVIEW: In the last few years, knowledge about coeliac disease has significantly improved, resulting in a better understanding of disease pathogenesis, diagnosis and therapy. This review describes the latest progress in research concerning treatment with gluten-free diet in patients with coeliac disease. RECENT FINDINGS: Gluten-free diet is generally admitted as effective therapy in symptomatic patients, but a life-long dietary treatment in some challenging cases such as 'silent' and 'latent' patients is under discussion. Tolerance to gluten may be acquired later in life, but, as latency may be transient, a strict follow-up is necessary in these patients. The composition of gluten-free diet needs a better definition; latest evidence demonstrates that oats are tolerated by most patients with coeliac disease. Finally, the amount of gluten permitted in gluten-free products is still a matter of debate; significant progress has been made in the sensitivity of techniques for gluten detection, but the daily amount of gluten that can be safely consumed is not yet defined. SUMMARY: Gluten-free diet remains the cornerstone of therapy of coeliac disease. More studies addressing the need of gluten-free diet for cases of 'potential' coeliac disease are necessary, as well as studies linking the best available analytical detection of gluten to the clinical threshold of tolerance.},

Its aim is to bring together basic and applied research in the area of coeliac disease (CD). This paper reviews the main issues that are a result of the CDEUSSA initiative. AIM: To identify the major issues in need of investigation in the areas of clinical aspects, treatment, prevention and public health. METHODS: Key stakeholders, representing a wide range of knowledge with crucial importance for CD research and practice, have participated in two workshops aimed at identifying and proposing to the EU, as high priority research, topics in the areas of clinical aspects, treatment, prevention and public health. RESULTS: In public health, the overall goal should be to improve quality of life of the European population by implementing primary prevention strategies, early diagnosis and improved treatments for CD. New treatment strategies need to be developed. The option of primary prevention should be fully explored, which requires combined epidemiological, clinical and basic scientific research efforts. Such studies should also consider the importance of gene-environment interactions in the development of CD. Increased knowledge is needed on the natural history of CD. Diagnostic criteria need to be revised. CONCLUSIONS: To achieve these goals, a collaboration of the stakeholders is fundamental, including research and patient organizations, as well as industries within both diagnostics and food production.},

SS is frequently associated with other autoimmune diseases. Celiac disease (CD) is an autoimmune disorder that affects the digestive system and is trigged by gluten intake. These two diseases share some HLA antigens. We describe the case of a woman with a diagnosis of SS who presented with weight loss. CD was diagnosed. Because the literature on this topic is scarce, this case is compared with a prior review and some similarities were found. Diagnosis of CD in patients with SS may be difficult but is essential to achieve optimal treatment response in patients with poor quality of life.},

   abstract = {Celiac disease is a disease of the small intestine caused by an immune response to ingested gluten. This response results in characteristic damage to the villi, resulting in malabsorption. It is far more prevalent and its presentation can be far more subtle than once recognized. The prevalence of celiac disease in children in the general U.S. population is estimated to be 1 in 100. Toddlers and young children classically present with failure to thrive, diarrhea, and abdominal distension sometime after the introduction of gluten in the diet, but more often they present with subtle gastrointestinal symptoms such as constipation. Some children may be asymptomatic. Symptomatic patients and high-risk individuals should have serologic testing and testing of their total immunoglobulin A. Seropositive patients should undergo upper endoscopy and small-bowel biopsy of the distal duodenum. Treatment is lifelong adherence to a gluten-free diet. Families must meet with a dietician and should be strongly encouraged to participate in celiac support groups. The gastroenterology nurse is in an unparalleled position to assist parents of children newly diagnosed with celiac disease to identify the necessary lifestyle changes to make their child's life gluten free.},

Five hundred and forty-nine CD patients were retrospectively assessed. Two hundred and fifty-one (45.7%) showed classical, 262 (47.7%) subclinical, and 36 (6.6%) silent form of CD at the time of the diagnosis. The mean time under GFD was 7.13 years (range 1-15 years). Out of 549 patients, 381 (69.4%) were fully compliant, 112/549 (20.4%) reported less than one dietary transgression/month, and 56/549 (10.2%) reported at least one dietary transgression/month. Out of 549 patients, 18 (3.3%) patients developed complications under GFD (seven malignant and 11 nonmalignant complications). Fourteen patients were previously affected by classical CD (5.6% of the overall patients with classical CD), and four were affected by subclinical CD (1.5% of the overall patients with subclinical CD). None of the patients affected by silent CD developed complications. There was no statistical difference between the mean age of the two groups developing complications (P = n.s.). Complications appeared after a mean time under GFD of 6.5 years in classical CD, and after a mean time of 3.5 years in subclinical CD (P = n.s.). Finally, 6/14 (42.8%) patients with classical CD were not fully compliant to GFD, while 2/4 (50%) of subclinical CD patients were not fully compliant to GFD (P = n.s.). Less than 5% of CD patients may develop complications under GFD. Complications seem to affect more classical CD than subclinical CD, and seem to be irrespective of optimal GFD adherence.},

   abstract = {PURPOSE: Available literature data show that celiac disease (CD) is a frequent cause of recurrent miscarriage. However, data are lacking for pregnancy outcome when the patient is on a gluten-free diet (GFD). A case-control study about the effect of GFD on pregnancy was conducted from 1995 to 2006. A cohort of 13 women (mean age 32 years, range 22-38 years) affected by CD with recurrent miscarriages was observed. In all of them several causes of miscarriage (gynecological, endocrine, hematological, etc.) were excluded. All patients were started on a gluten-free diet and were reassessed throughout a long-term follow-up period to evaluate the outcome of pregnancy. RESULTS: Six of 13 became pregnant (46.15%) as follows: 1 patient (7.69%) 1 year after GFD was started, 3 patients (23.07%) 2 years after GFD was started, 1 patient (7.69%) after 3 years, and finally 1 (7.69%) 4 years after GFD was started. Moreover, two patients (16.66%) had multiple pregnancies (one had had two childbirths and another had undergone three births within a 7-year follow-up period under GFD). CONCLUSIONS: GFD seems to favor a positive outcome of pregnancy in most CD patients with recurrent miscarriage.},

   abstract = {OBJECTIVES: Xylose absorption testing has traditionally involved measurement of serum xylose and/or measurement of excreted xylose in urine. However, by enriching xylose with a 13C- or 14C-isotope, absorption of an oral xylose load will be reflected in the time-dependent pattern of 13CO2 or 14CO2 exhaled in breath. Our objectives were to evaluate the diagnostic properties of 13C-xylose and 14C-xylose breath tests in coeliac disease, and to develop a diagnostic breath test index. MATERIAL AND METHODS: We reviewed data from 41 coeliac patients who underwent the 14C-xylose breath test before and after commencement of a gluten-free diet, and 60 coeliac patients who underwent the 13C-xylose breath test, 37 of whom repeated the test after starting a gluten-free diet. Coeliac patients were compared with healthy control subjects. RESULTS: Coeliac patients exhaled significantly less 13CO2 or 14CO2 than healthy controls during the first hour of the test and more isotope-labelled CO2 than control subjects after 3 h. Diagnostic accuracy was optimal with test duration of 210 min combining gas measurements at 30 min and 210 min in a simple fraction. This gas fraction index (30 min/210 min) distinguished between coeliac patients and healthy control subjects with 84-95% sensitivity and 87-94% specificity. After commencement of a gluten-free diet, the gas fraction index increased in most coeliac patients, but remained lower than that in healthy control subjects. CONCLUSIONS: 13C-xylose- and 14C-xylose breath tests discriminate between coeliac patients and healthy control subjects with high sensitivity and specificity. The stable isotope 13C-xylose breath test has comparable diagnostic accuracy to the radioactive isotope 14C-xylose breath test and should be the preferred alternative to traditional xylose absorption tests.},

   abstract = {Celiac disease is a chronic inflammatory disease caused by dietary gluten that affects 1% of Europeans and North Americans. Gluten is unusual because it is consumed in relatively large amounts, is partially resistant to luminal digestion in the human small intestine, and when absorbed, is susceptible to post-translational modification (deamidation) by mucosal transglutaminase. Deamidation of certain gluten peptides enhances their binding to HLA-DQ2 or HLA-DQ8 and creates neodeterminants capable of stimulating CD4+ T cells. Only 5% of individuals with HLA-DQ2 and 0.5% of those with HLA-DQ8 have celiac disease, so immuno-logic tolerance to gluten is the norm. The critical steps in the immunopathogenesis of celiac disease are broadly understood, but little is known regarding mechanisms of tolerance to gluten. The effectiveness of therapies being developed for celiac disease will test the accuracy of our current understanding of disease pathogenesis.},

   abstract = {BACKGROUND: Although histology is considered the gold standard for the diagnosis of celiac disease, the early stages (latent or potential) of this disease are difficult to diagnose, because of the negativity of laboratory tests and the lack of villous atrophy. Thus, markers of early disease are needed. AIMS: We investigated the possibility to detect latent or potential celiac disease by means of TCRgamma clonality assay in intraepithelial T cells in patients with suspected disease, negative laboratory tests, and an increased number of intraepithelial lymphocytes. PATIENTS AND METHODS: Duodenal biopsies were obtained from 35 patients with nonspecific duodenitis (controls), 13 latent or potential celiac disease subjects, 28 well-defined celiac patients, and 8 celiac patients in gluten-free diet. Histologic and immunohistochemical quantification of intraepithelial lymphocytes, as well as TCRgamma clonality assay, were carried out in all subjects by means of standard techniques. RESULTS: Intraepithelial lymphocytes and TCRgamma clonality were significantly increased in potential and defined celiac patients with respect to the controls, even though the increase in TCRgamma clonality was lesser with respect to that of intraepithelial lymphocytes. No significant differences were found concerning this variable between the potential and defined celiac subjects. CONCLUSIONS: TCRgamma clonality does not represent a marker of early disease. However, it might be useful to help in distinguishing celiac disease from other causes of nonspecific duodenitis.},

   abstract = {CONTEXT: Celiac sprue affects genetically susceptible individuals, who develop small intestinal injury and malabsorption following dietary exposure to gluten. The histologic features are nonspecific but characteristic. OBJECTIVES: To outline the histologic features of celiac sprue and the necessary clinical context to permit a diagnosis of celiac sprue, to assist the pathologist to identify artifactual biopsy changes that may mimic sprue, to define the differential diagnosis for conditions with a similar histology, and to review historic investigations of this disease. DATA SOURCES: Sources include the historic experiments and clinical work of members of the Gastroenterology Division of the Department of Medicine and experiences with gastrointestinal pathology consultation material at the University of Washington, Seattle, with reference to selected peer-reviewed articles. CONCLUSIONS: Confirmation of a diagnosis of celiac sprue is 2-fold: first, biopsy evidence of a characteristic, but nonspecific, pattern of injury including villous blunting or flattening, surface enterocyte damage, and increased intraepithelial lymphocytes; and second, dramatic clinical response to a gluten-free diet. Complete gluten removal from the diet is effective treatment for patients with symptoms of malabsorption; however, lifelong adherence to the diet is expensive, socially limiting, and nearly impossible on a contemporary diet with manufactured foodstuffs. Therefore, pathologists should avoid overdiagnosis of celiac disease based on minimal, nonspecific histologic changes.},

AIM: To evaluate the effect of gluten-free diet adherence and irritable bowel syndrome-type symptoms co-morbidity on health-related quality of life in adult coeliac disease patients. PATIENTS AND METHODS: A total of 1130 adults were enrolled in the study comprising 1001 controls from the general population and 129 diagnosed coeliac disease patients from the University Clinic in Cagliari. Irritable bowel syndrome-type symptoms and health-related quality of life were assessed using the Rome II and the SF-36 questionnaires, respectively. RESULTS: Irritable bowel syndrome-type symptoms prevalence in controls was 10.1% (102/1001) and 55% (71/129) in the coeliac disease patients. Irritable bowel syndrome-type symptom controls and coeliac disease patients both presented significantly lower health-related quality of life (p<or=0.05) compared to healthy controls. Strict diet coeliac disease patients, compared to partial diet patients, showed significantly (p<or=0.05) better scores in all domains, except physical functioning, physical-role and bodily pain. The lowest scores were found in partial diet coeliac disease patients with irritable bowel syndrome-type symptoms. CONCLUSIONS: The present results confirm the burden of irritable bowel syndrome-type symptoms and coeliac disease on health-related quality of life. Moreover, these data show that health-related quality of life in coeliac disease is impaired by poor compliance and by co-morbidity with irritable bowel syndrome-type symptoms.},

The aim of this study was to establish the recurrence of GERD-rs, in CD patients with nonerosive reflux disease (NERD). METHODS: From a total of 105 adult CD patients observed, 29 who presented with the NERD form were enrolled in the study. Thirty non-CD patients with NERD were studied as controls. Recurrence of GERD-rs was clinically assessed at 6, 12, 18, and 24 months follow-up (FU) after withdrawal of initial proton-pump inhibitor (PPI) treatment for 8 weeks. RESULTS: GERD-rs were resolved in 25 (86.2%) CD patients and in 20 (66.7%) controls after 8 weeks of PPI treatment. In the CD group, recurrence of GERD-rs was found in five cases (20%) at 6 months but in none at 12, 18, and 24 months while in the control group recurrence was found in six of 20 controls (30%), in another six (12/20, 60%), in another three (15/20, 75%), and in another two (17/20, 85%) at 6, 12, 18, and 24 months FU respectively. CONCLUSIONS: The present study is the first to have evaluated the effect of a GFD in the nonerosive form of GERD in CD patients, by means of clinical long-term follow-up, suggesting that GFD could be a useful approach in reducing GERD symptoms and in the prevention of recurrence.},

   abstract = {A reduced bone mineral density has been reported in patients with untreated celiac disease (CD) as well as in patients with poorly controlled type 1 diabetes mellitus (T1DM). The aim of this study was to evaluate the bone mineral status by phalangeal quantitative ultrasound in 52 children and adolescents with both diseases (mean age 13.3+/-4.9 years). As a control group 50 patients with T1DM and no CD (age 12.2+/-4.0 years) were studied. The following bone parameters, amplitude-dependent speed of sound (AD-SoS) and bone transmission time (BTT) were considered and expressed as z score. Compliance to gluten free diet and long term glycemic control (mean of four determinations of HbA1c in the last year) were also assessed. The lowest mean AD-SoS z score values were found in patients with T1DM and CD, who reported transgressions to gluten free diet and exhibited positivity for serum anti-tissue transglutaminase antibodies (tTG) and/or endomysial antibodies (EmA), compared with patients with occasional transgressions but negative for anti-tTG and/or -EmA, patients strictly adherent to the diet, and patients who suffered only from diabetes (ANOVA p=0.021). No difference was found between patients with diabetes alone and patients with both diseases strictly adherent to gluten free diet. Prevalence of osteopenia (z AD-SoS values <-2 SD) was higher in patients with T1DM and CD and poor compliance to the diet (45.5%) compared with patients with T1DM (8%) or patients with both diseases strictly compliant to diet (12.9%) (p=0.015). A negative correlation between Ad-SoS z score and HbA1c (r -0.236, p=0.036) was found when patients with T1DM and patients with T1DM and CD, who strictly adhere to the diet, were pooled. In conclusion the quality of bone as assessed by phalangeal ultrasound in patients with T1DM and CD, who strictly adhere to gluten free diet, is similar to that found in T1DM patients. A higher prevalence of osteopenia is present in patients with both diseases who reported habitual transgressions to gluten free diet. The gluten free diet, as well as the optimization of glycemic control, plays an important role in preventing the osteopenic status caused by the clustering of these two chronic diseases.},

   abstract = {OBJECTIVES: Subjects with type 1 diabetes mellitus (DM) are at increased risk to develop celiac disease (CD). However, most of the published investigations on the association between type 1 DM and CD are cross-sectional ones. In this paper, longitudinal data are presented on the effects of gluten-free diet (GFD) on growth and metabolic control in children and adolescents with type 1 DM screened for CD. METHODS: Clinical records of 27 patients with type 1 DM+CD (7% of a population of 385 subjects with type 1 DM) were reviewed. The following variables were considered at the diagnosis of CD (T0) and after 24 (T24) and 48 (T48) months of GFD according to the length of available follow-up: weight, height, body mass index (BMI), Hb and HbA1c levels and per kg/day dose of insulin. Forty-three patients with type 1 DM alone, matched for sex, age and duration of diabetes were chosen as controls. RESULTS: In patients with type 1 DM+CD, mean (SD) age at type 1 DM diagnosis was 8 (3.3) years. Median time interval between diagnosis of type 1 DM and of CD was 1.8 years (range 0.1-23.9 years). At T0 (n = 23), height and BMI z-score, HbA1c levels and daily insulin dose were comparable in type 1 DM+CD and in control subjects. Mean Hb concentration was significantly lower in subjects with type 1 DM+CD (12.6 (1.3) vs. 13.3 (0.7) g/dl, p < 0.05). At T24 (n = 22) and T48 (n = 16), no difference was detectable in height, BMI, HbAlc and insulin dose and also Hb concentration was comparable in both groups. CONCLUSIONS: This study shows that, at diagnosis of CD, screened subjects with type 1 DM had only minor signs of malnutrition and metabolic disturbances were uncommon. Dietary treatment of CD can allow a growth and diabetes control comparable with subjects with diabetes alone.},

   abstract = {OBJECTIVE: The development of a disease-specific, health-related, quality-of-life questionnaire for children ages 8 to 18 with celiac disease (CD), together with a parent-as-proxy version. MATERIALS AND METHODS: We used a focus-group method (bottom-up approach) to investigate the impact of CD on children's everyday lives and selected 24 items to create a preliminary disease-specific questionnaire. This questionnaire, together with the complementary generic quality-of-life questionnaire DUX-25, was sent to 756 children with CD in the Netherlands and was returned by 530 of them. With the help of statistical analyses (Cronbach alpha, factor analysis, Pearson correlation, Student t test, paired samples t test, and item response theory), we tested the psychometric performance of the 24 items. RESULTS: We reduced the questionnaire to 12 items: the Celiac Disease DUX (CDDUX). The CDDUX has 3 subscales: "Communication" (3), "Diet" (6), and "Having CD" (3). This questionnaire proved to be reliable, valid, and feasible and able to discriminate between perception of severity in cases of CD as assessed by parents. CONCLUSIONS: Children with a better perception of their own health status have a higher score on the CDDUX questionnaire. The whole group seems to have a lower quality of life than the healthy reference group on all domains of the DUX-25. The new disease-specific questionnaire CDDUX provides information about how children with CD think and feel about their illness. The questionnaire may enable researchers and clinicians to determine the consequences of this illness and the effects of clinical interventions on several aspects of daily living.},

   abstract = {Celiac disease is a gluten-sensitive enteropathy, which commits the patient to a life-long gluten-free diet. This is sufficient to treat the overwhelming majority of patients. However, a small group of these patients, mainly those diagnosed above 50 years of age, fails to improve histologically and clinically upon elimination of gluten from the diet. These patients are regarded as suffering from refractory celiac disease. In a subgroup of these patients a pre-malignant intraepithelial lymphocyte population can be detected in the small intestinal mucosa (type II). These patients are at a high risk of developing an enteropathy-associated T-cell lymphoma (50-60% within 4-6 years), which has a very poor prognosis and a 5-year survival of only 8%. The therapeutic challenge in these refractory celiac disease type II patients is targeting the aberrant intraepithelial lymphocytes to eventually prevent enteropathy-associated T-cell lymphoma development. Although management of these patients is difficult and therapeutic options are currently limited, novel treatment modalities are being explored.},

   abstract = {The present report describes a young woman with no previous gastrointestinal complaints who was initially diagnosed with postinfective irritable bowel syndrome (IBS) after a confirmed case of Campylobacter jejuni enteritis. However, because of persistent diarrhea, new-onset bloating and the development of iron and vitamin deficiencies, serological markers for celiac disease (CD) were evaluated. A positive tissue transglutaminase immunoglobulin A antibody test and repeat endoscopy with duodenal biopsy showing a Marsh IIIa lesion confirmed the diagnosis of CD. Infectious gastroenteritis is a well-established risk factor for the development of IBS, and there is recent evidence that it could play a role in the initiation and exacerbation of inflammatory bowel disease. The present case suggests that the clinical expression of CD can be unmasked by an acute gastrointestinal infection and supports the hypothesis that environmental factors other than gliadin may play a role in the clinical onset of CD in a genetically susceptible host. The increasing availability of serological testing and upper endoscopy has led to increasingly frequent diagnoses of CD and recognition that it may mimic IBS. The present case findings suggest that CD should be considered in the differential diagnosis of persistent IBS-like symptoms after an episode of infectious gastroenteritis.},

   abstract = {Celiac disease causes chronic inflammation of the intestinal mucosa and reduces surface absorption; after the withdrawal of gluten from the diet, there are clinical and histologic improvements. The intestinal permeability test and serologic tests are useful for confirming the diagnosis and monitoring patients. The goal of this study is to compare the antigliadin antibody (AGA) test with the intestinal permeability test for celiac patients on a gluten-free diet. The sample consisted of 22 celiac patients who were antigliadin immunoglobulin A-positive before treatment. After 12 months on a gluten-free diet, AGA testing was repeated and the intestinal permeability test was performed. A control group was composed of 11 healthy individuals. AGA remained positive in 40.9% of celiac patients, and the mean urinary lactulose excretion was 10.27%, that of mannitol was 10.18%, and the lactulose/mannitol ratio was 1.02. In the subgroup in which antigliadin became negative (59.1%), the value for lactulose was 3.79%, that for mannitol was 11.12%, the lactulose/mannitol ratio was 0.38, and the p value was less than 0.0001, 0.66, and less than 0.0001, respectively. When the two celiac subgroups were compared with the control group, the urinary lactulose excretion and the lactulose/mannitol ratio was less in the control group, whereas urinary mannitol excretion was greater. The p values were less than 0.0001 for the three variables, suggesting persistent lesions in mucosa of both subgroups, although to a lesser degree for those that became AGA negative. It is concluded that intestinal permeability allows a more precise clinical physiopathologic correlation than antigliadin and offers more information for the monitoring of these patients.},

There is evidence that gut barrier dysfunction may act as a primary disease mechanism in intestinal disorders. The aim of the present study was to evaluate the barrier function towards sugars after the appropriate treatment of celiac disease and Crohn's disease patients and compare the results with those obtained with healthy subjects. Fifteen healthy volunteers, 22 celiac disease patients after 1 year of a gluten-free diet, and 31 Crohn's disease patients in remission were submitted to an intestinal permeability test with 6.0 g lactulose and 3.0 g mannitol. Six-hour urinary lactulose excretion in Crohn's disease patients was significantly higher than in both celiac disease patients (0.42 vs 0.15%) and healthy controls (0.42 vs 0.07%). Urinary lactulose excretion was significantly higher in celiac disease patients than in healthy controls (0.15 vs 0.07%). Urinary mannitol excretion in Crohn's disease patients was the same as healthy controls (21 vs 21%) and these values were significantly higher than in celiac disease patients (10.9%). The lactulose/mannitol ratio was significantly higher in Crohn's disease patients in comparison to celiac disease patients (0.021 vs 0.013) and healthy controls (0.021 vs 0.003) and this ratio was also significantly higher in celiac disease patients compared to healthy controls (0.013 vs 0.003). In spite of treatment, differences in sugar permeability were observed in both disease groups. These differences in the behavior of the sugar probes probably reflect different mechanisms for the alterations of intestinal permeability.},

METHODS: The Down Syndrome Research Foundation sent a questionnaire to 314 families across Canada who were part of the Canadian Voluntary Registry on Down Syndrome. This questionnaire was designed to collect information from parents about physical examinations, laboratory tests, referrals and discussions with family physicians that are listed in the health care guidelines. RESULTS: Two hundred twenty-three families responded to the survey. The highest response rates were in families with children in the five- to 12-year-old age range (41.7%) and the 13- to 18-year-old age range (19.7%). The most common medical conditions reported were visual, hearing and cardiac related. A high percentage of sleep-, gastrointestinal- and thyroid-related conditions were also reported. In the adult group (ie, 30 years of age and older), there was a high proportion of depression and/or anxiety disorders reported. The percentage of those reporting physical examinations and medical referrals by family physicians were highest in the five- to 12-year-old age range and dropped below 50% in those aged 19 years and older. In the one- to four-year-old and five- to 12-year-old age groups, the percentages of those with Down syndrome referred for hearing tests and celiac screens were reported to be below 30%. The percentages of those reporting discussions on behavioural issues were below 50% in all age groups. CONCLUSIONS: Physical examinations, as per the recommended guidelines, were followed only in the five- to 12-year-old age group. Many of the recommendations regarding discussion of behavioural problems, transition planning, diet, exercise and issues around puberty or sexual health were followed infrequently in all age groups. Further physician education about the guidelines is necessary.},

   abstract = {The main cause of lack of response to a gluten-free diet is continued, usually inadvertent, gluten intake. Diagnosis of refractory celiac disease is established on the basis of exclusion of other disorders, persistence of malabsorption and villous atrophy. Refractory celiac disease affects a heterogeneous group of patients, usually adults and, fortunately, is infrequent (<5% of the population). Detection of alterations in the intraepithelial lymphocyte population is essential for diagnosis. Some alterations in these lymphocytes, such as the absence of T cell surface receptor expression (CD3 and CD), indicate an aggressive form of the disease with the potential for malignant transformation (type II refractory celiac disease). Treatment is based on adequate nutritional support and on the use of corticosteroids and/or immunosuppressive agents (mainly azathioprine and infliximab). Because of the high risk of progression to intestinal T cell lymphoma, patients diagnosed with type 2 refractory disease require different -generally more aggressive- therapeutic strategies. At present, no treatment has been demonstrated to be effective in the long term, but two options that should be considered in type II disease are immunotherapy with anti-CD52 or similar agents, and autologous bone marrow transplantation. Trials with antibodies that block epithelial secretion of interleukin-15, a key molecule in the pathogenesis of the disease, are promising.},

   abstract = {OBJECTIVE: A prevalence of coeliac disease higher than in the general population has been reported not only in patients with idiopathic dilated cardiomyopathy, a presumable autoimmune disease, but also in patients with ischaemic or valvular cardiomyopathy. The evidence is controversial, however, and the concept itself of an association unrelated to aetiology is intriguing and warrants further testing. The aim of our study was to assess the prevalence of coeliac disease in a cohort of patients with dilated cardiomyopathy screened for the presence of serum anti-transglutaminase antibodies. We provisionally assessed the sensitivity and specificity of two commercially available kits for tissue transglutaminase antibodies detection. MATERIAL AND METHODS: We screened for anti-transglutaminase antibodies in 350 consecutive patients with idiopathic (n = 182) and with ischaemic (n = 168) dilated cardiomyopathy using the previously validated method for anti-transglutaminase antibody assay. Coeliac disease diagnosis has been confirmed by duodenal histopathology in patients testing positive at serological screening. RESULTS: Two coeliac patients (0.6% prevalence) have been identified, one with idiopathic and one with ischaemic dilated cardiomyopathy. They presented with iron deficiency anaemia and with recurrent abdominal pain and diarrhoea, respectively, and both had villous atrophy at histopathology. After 1 year on a gluten-free diet, the echocardiographic parameters did not improve in either patient. CONCLUSIONS: Our results indicate that the prevalence of coeliac disease in patients with dilated cardiomyopathies is similar to that reported for the Italian general population. The confounding factor of conditions associated with both coeliac disease and dilated cardiomyopathies may explain the association unrelated to aetiology reported in previous studies mostly based on small sample size.},

   abstract = {INTRODUCTION: Platelet counts exceeding 1.000 x 103/microl are usually considered secondary to another cause, particularly to chronic myeloproliferative disease (CMPD). Reactive thrombocytosis due to iron deficiency rarely exceeds platelet counts of 700 x 103/microl. CASE PRESENTATION: Here we report the case of a young woman presenting with clinical signs of severe anemia. Laboratory findings confirmed an iron-deficiency anemia associated with severe thrombocytosis of 1703 x 103/microl. Macroscopic gastrointestinal and genitourinary tract bleeding was excluded. The excessive elevation of platelets, slightly elevated lactate dehydrogenase and slightly elevated leukocytes along with the absence of other inflammation parameters raised the suspicion of an underlying hematological disease. However, bone marrow evaluation could not prove the suspected diagnosis of a CMPD, especially essential thrombocythemia (ET). In the further clinical course the platelet count returned to normal after raising the hemoglobin to a level close to normal range with erythrocyte transfusion, and normalization of serum iron and decline of erythropoietin. Finally, following small bowel biopsy, despite the absence of typical clinical signs, celiac disease was diagnosed. After discharge from hospital the patient was commenced on a gluten-free diet and her hemoglobin almost completely normalized in the further follow-up period. CONCLUSION: This case illustrates the rare constellation of an extreme thrombocytosis most likely secondary to iron deficiency due to celiac disease. This represents, to the best of the authors' knowledge, the highest reported platelet count coincident with iron deficiency. A potential mechanism for the association of iron-deficiency anemia and thrombocytosis is discussed. Even in the presence of 'atypically' high platelets one should consider the possibility of reactive thrombocytosis. Extreme thrombocytosis could emerge in the case of iron deficiency secondary to celiac disease.},

   abstract = {Emerging evidence has suggested environmental factors such as infections and xenobiotics and some dietary proteins and peptides in the pathogenesis of many autoimmune diseases. Considering the fact that autoantibodies can often be detected prior to the onset of a disease, in this study an enzyme immunoassay was used for measurement of antibodies against different highly purified antigens or synthetic peptides originating not only from human tissue, but also from cross-reactive epitopes of infectious agents, dietary proteins and xenobiotics. The measurement of antibodies against a panel of antigens allows for identification of patterns or antibody signatures, rather than just one or two markers of autoimmunity, thus establishing the premise for increased sensitivity and specificity of prediction, as well as positive predictive values. This panel of different autoantibodies was applied to 420 patients with different autoimmune diseases, including pernicious anemia, celiac disease, thyroiditis, lupus, rheumatoid arthritis, osteoarthritis, Addison's disease, type 1 diabetes, cardiovascular disease and autoimmunity, which are presented in this article. In all cases, the levels of these antibodies were significantly elevated in patients versus controls. Antibody patterns related to neuroautoimmune disorders, cancer, and patients with somatic hypermutation will be shown in a subsequent article. We believe that this novel 96 antigen-specific autoantibody or predictive antibody screen should be studied for its incorporation into routine medical examinations. Clinicians should be aware that the detection of antibodies should not automatically mean that a patient will definitely become ill, but would rather give a percentage of risk for autoimmune disease over subsequent months or years.},

   abstract = {Although the spectrum of liver abnormalities associated with celiac disease is particularly wide, two main forms of liver damage, namely cryptogenic and autoimmune, appear to be strictly related to gluten-sensitive enteropathy. The most frequent occurrence is a cryptogenic hypertransaminasemia, present in about a half of untreated celiac patients, as an expression of a mild liver impairment characterised by a histological picture of non specific reactive hepatitis (celiac hepatitis) reverting to normal after a few months of gluten withdrawal. In a few cases, a more severe liver injury leading to chronic hepatitis or liver cirrhosis is present. In these patients liver damage can still improve after a gluten-free diet institution. In addition, a close association between celiac disease and autoimmune liver disorders has been largely demonstrated. Indeed, 3%-7% of patients with primary biliary cirrhosis, 3%-6% with autoimmune hepatitis and 2-3% with primary sclerosing cholangitis are affected by celiac disease. Autoimmune liver dysfunction, found in celiac disease, does not usually improve after gluten-free-diet. Presently, it is difficult to establish if the two main kinds of liver injury found in celiac disease (cryptogenic and autoimmune) are discrete entities with a different pathogenesis or if they are an expression of the same disorder where genetic factors and duration of gluten exposure may determine the severity and the pattern of liver injury.},

   abstract = {The prevalence of the recently described deamidated gliadin peptide antibodies was compared with that of the routinely used antigliadin, antiendomysial, and tissue transglutaminase antibodies in the sera of 128 untreated celiac patients and 134 controls. Sensitivity and specificity for celiac disease were 83.6 and 90.3% for IgA and 84.4 and 98.5% for IgG antibodies to deamidated gliadin peptides. The new test displayed higher diagnostic accuracy than antigliadin antibodies and, although less sensitive than antiendomysial and tissue transglutaminase antibodies, showed significantly higher specificity than tissue transglutaminase antibodies (P < 0.001). Persistence of peptide antibodies after gluten withdrawal was an expression of low compliance with the diet and of the lack of improvement of the intestinal mucosa. The combined use of tissue transglutaminase and deamidated gliadin peptide antibodies seems to be a very useful tool for celiac disease diagnosis. Moreover, antibodies to deamidated gliadin peptides can be helpful in disease follow-up.},

   abstract = {Celiac Sprue is an inflammatory disease of the small intestine triggered by ingestion of dietary gluten, a family of glutamine and proline rich proteins found in common foodgrains such as wheat, rye, and barley. One potential therapy for this lifelong disease anticipates using an oral protease to detoxify gluten in vivo. Recent studies have shown that EP-B2 (endoprotease B, isoform 2) from barley is a promising example of such a glutenase, thus warranting its large-scale production for animal safety and human clinical studies. Here we describe a scaleable fermentation, refolding and purification process for the production of gram to kilogram quantities of pro-EP-B2 (zymogen form of EP-B2) in a lyophilized form. A fed-batch E. coli fermentation system was developed that yields 0.3-0.5 g purified recombinant protein per liter culture volume. Intracellular degradation of pro-EP-B2 during the fermentation was overcome by manipulating the fermentation temperature and duration of protein expression. A simple refolding protocol was developed using a fast dilution method to refold the enzyme at concentrations greater than 0.5 mg/mL. Kinetic analysis showed that pro-EP-B2 refolding is a first-order reaction with an estimated rate constant of 0.15 h(-1). A lyophilization procedure was developed that yielded protein with 85% recoverable activity after 7 weeks of storage at room temperature. The process was successfully scaled up to 100 L with comparable purity and recovery.},

   abstract = {OBJECTIVE: To assess the influence of gluten-free diet (GFD) compliance on the quality of life (QOL) of adolescents with coeliac disease (CD), and the impact of patient's age at time of diagnosis. STUDY DESIGN: Participants included 365 subjects: 283 adolescents (10-20 years old) with biopsy-proven CD and 82 adolescents without a chronic condition matched for age, sex, education, and social status. Their subjective QOL-comprising physical, mental, and social dimensions as defined by the World Health Organization-was measured and has been analyzed according to compliance status and age at CD diagnosis. RESULTS: Adolescents noncompliant with GFD reported a lower general QOL, more physical problems, a higher burden of illness, more family problems, and more problems in leisure time than adolescents who are compliant with GFD. More frequent GFD transgressions were associated with poorer QOL. Higher problem anticipation and higher feelings of "ill-being" were found in the noncompliant group. No differences between compliant patients with CD and adolescents without any chronic condition were found in all QOL aspects. Adolescents with a late CD diagnosis showed more problems at school and in social contact with peers, as well as worse physical health and higher CD-associated burden. CONCLUSIONS: Compliance with GFD is an essential factor to obtain optimal QOL. Psychosocial and educational support should be provided for patients having difficulties strictly adhering to GFD. Early CD onset and diagnosis is associated with better physical health, lower CD-associated burden and fewer social problems, indicating the importance of the earliest CD diagnosis possible.},

We examined the prevalence of celiac disease-associated serum antibodies in diarrhea-dominant irritable bowel syndrome (d-IBS) patients and their efficacy in combination with HLA-DQ2 expression to predict the response to gluten-free diet. METHODS: HLA-DQA1*0501/DQB1*0201 expression and celiac disease-associated IgA and IgG serum antibodies against gliadin and tissue-transglutaminase were measured in 145 patients with d-IBS, 74 patients with untreated and treated celiac disease, and 57 patients with active IBD. Follow-up antibody levels, stool frequency, and gastrointestinal symptom scores were determined in 41 d-IBS patients (26 women, 15 men; median age, 46 years, range, 30-67 years) who participated in a nonrandomized evaluation of 6 months of gluten-free diet. RESULTS: Increased celiac disease-associated serum IgG, but not IgA, was found in the majority of patients with treated (55%) as in most patients with untreated celiac disease (97%). In d-IBS patients, celiac disease-associated serum IgG antibodies (37%) and HLA-DQ2 expression (39%) were more frequent than in IBD patients (18% and 23%, respectively). After 6 months of gluten-free diet, stool frequency and gastrointestinal symptom score returned to normal values in 60% of d-IBS patients who were positive and in 12% who were negative for HLA-DQ2 and celiac disease-associated serum IgG; both parameters combined yielded positive and negative predictive values of 56% (95% confidence interval, 30%-80%) and 88% (69%-97%), respectively. CONCLUSIONS: Celiac disease-associated serum IgG and HLA-DQ2 expression can identify likely responders to gluten-free diet in d-IBS patients.},

   abstract = {AIMS: Autoimmune diseases such as Addison's or coeliac disease can contribute to hypoglycaemia or malabsorption and are more common in Type 1 diabetes (T1DM). This brief report describes the prevalence of known and newly detected autoimmune disease in clinical islet transplant candidates with longstanding T1DM and severe hypoglycaemia and/or glycaemic lability who are routinely screened for coexisting autoimmune disease. METHODS: One hundred and twenty-four C-peptide negative T1DM subjects [77 (62%) female, mean age 44 +/- 9 years, diabetes duration 28 +/- 11 years, body mass index 24.9 +/- 3.5 kg/m(2)] with indications for clinical islet transplantation at the University of Alberta were screened for autoimmune disease by history and measurement of anti-transglutaminase antibodies (positive > 10 U/ml), 09.00 h cortisol (followed by adrenocorticotrophic hormone-stimulation if < 495 nmol/l) and thyroid-stimulating hormone to determine the prevalence of coeliac disease, Addison's disease and autoimmune thyroid disease, respectively. RESULTS: Forty per cent of subjects had one or more coexisting autoimmune disease. The prevalence of autoimmune disease was 35%, coeliac disease 8% and Addison's disease 1.6%. In 11 individuals (9%), one or more autoimmune disease were newly detected (seven coeliac disease and five thyroid disease). Seven of 10 cases of coeliac disease were newly detected. A gluten-free diet in individuals with newly diagnosed coeliac disease reduced gastrointestinal symptoms, but indications for clinical islet cell transplantation persisted. CONCLUSIONS: Coexisting autoimmune disease is common in candidates for clinical islet cell transplantation. Screening in this group identified a substantial number of previously unrecognized cases. Clinicians should consider the presence of autoimmune disease even in the absence of classical symptoms.},

Our aim was to assess the gut mucosal gene expression and genetic association of SPINK1, -2, -4, and -5 in the Dutch CD population. Gene expression was determined for all four SPINK genes by quantitative reverse-transcription polymerase chain reaction in duodenal biopsy samples from untreated (n=15) and diet-treated patients (n=31) and controls (n=16). Genetic association of the four SPINK genes was tested within a total of 18 haplotype tagging SNPs, one coding SNP, 310 patients, and 180 controls. The SPINK4 study cohort was further expanded to include 479 CD cases and 540 controls. SPINK4 DNA sequence analysis was performed on six members of a multigeneration CD family to detect possible point mutations or deletions. SPINK4 showed differential gene expression, which was at its highest in untreated patients and dropped sharply upon commencement of a gluten-free diet. Genetic association tests for all four SPINK genes were negative, including SPINK4 in the extended case/control cohort. No SPINK4 mutations or deletions were observed in the multigeneration CD family with linkage to chromosome 9p21-13 nor was the coding SNP disease-specific. SPINK4 exhibits CD pathology-related differential gene expression, likely derived from altered goblet cell activity. All of the four SPINK genes tested do not contribute to the genetic risk for CD in the Dutch population.},

   abstract = {OBJECTIVES: Short stature is one of the presenting symptoms of celiac disease (CD), and growth acceleration can be achieved with gluten-free diet (GFD). However, the data regarding final adult height of CD patients are scarce and inconclusive. Our aim was to evaluate the adult height of CD patients in relation to the age at diagnosis: < or =18 yr or >18 yr. METHODS: Questionnaires were sent to CD patients > or =18 yr of age, who were either members of the Israeli Celiac Association or patients followed by the pediatric gastroenterology unit, including questions about height, weight, gender, age at diagnosis, and GFD adherence. The height Z scores were calculated for each patient. RESULTS: In total, 290 patients (M/F = 83/207), age 38.9 +/- 15.5 yr (range 18-76), were included: 113 were diagnosed before and 177 after 18 yr of age (groups 1 and 2, respectively). The mean adult height was: 178.4 +/- 6.6 cm and 176.2 +/- 8.6 cm for men (P= 0.22), and 163.0 +/- 6.6 cm and 162.6 +/- 6.5 cm for women (P= 0.68) in groups 1 and 2, respectively. The height Z scores were 0.230 +/- 0.931 and -0.07 +/- 1.19 for men (P= 0.22), and -0.05 +/- 1.02 and -0.101 +/- 0.990 for women (P= 0.68) in groups 1 and 2, respectively. The final height inversely correlated with age at diagnosis in men (R =-0.275, P= 0.012) but not in women (R =-1.0, P= not significant [NS]). CONCLUSIONS: The final height of patients with CD is similar to the general population. The adult height of male patients with CD is inversely related to the age at diagnosis. Delayed diagnosis of CD may lead to a shorter adult height in men but not in women.},

   abstract = {Coeliac disease (CD) is an immune-mediated enteropathy triggered by ingestion of wheat gluten and related cereals in genetically predisposed individuals. Circulating immunoglobulin A (IgA) class autoantibodies against tissue transglutaminase (IgA-TGA) are highly specific and sensitive serological markers for CD, which is ultimately confirmed by duodenal biopsy. Although CD is considered a life-long disorder, transient or fluctuating IgA-TGA seropositivity has been observed in asymptomatic individuals on a gluten-containing diet. We set out to explore possible differences in the maturation of IgA-TGA avidity between individuals progressing to CD and subjects remaining healthy despite occasional expression of autoantibodies. We developed a time-resolved fluorometric IgA-TGA assay based on human recombinant tissue transglutaminase (tTG), and further modified the method to also measure urea-dependent avidity of the autoantibodies. We measured the autoantibody titres and avidities of sequential serum samples from 10 children developing CD and 10 children presenting transient or fluctuating autoantibodies. Both the initial titres at seroconversion and peak values of transient/fluctuating IgA-TGA were significantly lower than corresponding autoantibody titres in samples drawn from individuals with progressing CD (P = 0.004 and P = 0.0002, respectively). However, there were no statistically significant differences in the initial or peak avidity index values between the two groups of children. The avidity index values increased during the follow-up period (P = 0.013 for both groups) with no significant difference in the rate of avidity maturation between children with transient/fluctuating IgA-TGA and children developing CD. According to our results, high autoantibody titres have a higher predictive value than avidity maturation of TGA-IgA in screening for CD.},

MATERIALS AND METHODS: Eighty-one children (53 coeliac patients and 28 control subjects) were examined during the period 2003-2004 in the Oral Surgery Outpatient Clinic of the Academic Medical Centre in Amsterdam. RESULT: Twenty-nine (55%) coeliac patients had enamel defects against 5 (18%) control subjects. In the coeliac disease group, the enamel defects were diagnosed as specific in 20 (38%) children, compared with 1 (4%) in the control group. Statistical analysis showed significantly more specific enamel defects in children with coeliac disease than in children in the control group (chi(2) = 12.62, d.f. = 2, P = 0.002). CONCLUSION: This study showed significantly more specific enamel defects in Dutch children with coeliac disease as compared with children in the control group. Dentists could play an important role in recognizing patients with coeliac disease.},

   abstract = {We report the largest market basket survey of arsenic (As) in U.S. rice to date. Our findings show differences in transitional-metal levels between polished and unpolished rice and geographical variation in As and selenium (Se) between rice processed in California and the South Central U.S. The mean and median As grain levels for the South Central U.S. were 0.30 and 0.27 mimcrog As g(-1), respectively, for 107 samples. Levels for California were 41% lower than the South Central U.S., with a mean of 0.17 microg As g(-1) and a median of 0.16 microg As g(-1) for 27 samples. The mean and median Se grain levels for the South Central U.S. were 0.19 microg Se g(-1). Californian rice levels were lower, averaging only 0.08 and 0.06 microg Se g(-1) for mean and median values, respectively. The difference between the two regions was found to be significant for As and Se (General Linear Model (GLM): As p < 0.001; Se p < 0.001). No statistically significant differences were observed in As or Se levels between polished and unpolished rice (GLM: As p= 0.213; Se p= 0.113). No significant differences in grain levels of manganese (Mn), cobalt (Co), copper (Cu), or zinc (Zn) were observed between California and the South Central U.S. Modeling arsenic intake for the U.S. population based on this survey shows that for certain groups (namely Hispanics, Asians, sufferers of Celiac disease, and infants) dietary exposure to inorganic As from elevated levels in rice potentially exceeds the maximum intake of As from drinking water (based on consumption of 1 L of 0.01 mg L(-1) In. As) and Californian state exposure limits. Further studies on the transformation of As in soil, grain As bioavailability in the human gastrointestinal tract, and grain elemental speciation trends are critical.},

   abstract = {OBJECTIVE: To assess the effect of a prospective screening strategy for the early diagnosis of celiac disease (CD) in children with Down syndrome (DS). STUDY DESIGN: Blood samples were taken from 155 children with DS. Buccal swabs were also taken from 9 of these children for determination of human leukocyte antigen (HLA)-DQ2 or HLA-DQ8 positivity. Independently, immunoglobulin A anti-endomysium-(EMA) and anti-tissue transglutaminase antibodies (TGA) were tested. An intestinal biopsy was performed to confirm the diagnosis of CD. RESULTS: Sixty-three children (40.6%) had test results that were positive for HLA-DQ2 or HLA-DQ8. Results of HLA DQ-typing of DNA isolated from blood and buccal swabs were identical. Eight of the children in whom test results were positive for HLA-DQ2/8 also had positive test results for EMA and TGA. CD was confirmed in 7 of these children with an intestinal biopsy, and in 1 child, CD was suggested with improvement on a gluten-free diet. CONCLUSIONS: We found a prevalence of CD in children with DS of 5.2% (10 times higher than the general Dutch population). We recommend HLA-DQ2/8 typing from buccal swabs in the first year of life and initiating serologic screening of children with DS in whom test results are positive for HLA-DQ2 or DQ8 at age 3 years. Early knowledge of negative HLA-DQ2/8 status can reassure most parents that their children do not have a CD risk.},

   abstract = {This review of the current scenario of celiac disease (CD) in India covers both pediatric and adult CD. CD is primarily reported from northern India with isolated case reports from the rest of the country. CD cases among Indian children are associated with multiple DR3-DQ2 haplotypes. Delay in diagnosis is contributed by multiple factors including atypical presentations. Use of serological tests, IgA EMA and anti-tTG antibodies, along with modified ESPGHAN criteria provides a definitive diagnosis of CD. Dietary management is often difficult due to non-availability of labeled and marketed gluten-free foods. A majority of children with CD show normalization of nutrition, substantial improvement in growth parameters and attainment of healthy percentile curves on gluten-free diet. Small bowel histology remarkably improves but does not normalize even after 2-3 years on gluten-free diet. The true burden of the disease should be addressed by large epidemiological studies.},

We therefore assessed the effects of this diet. METHODS: Forty-two children with CD were enrolled. Weight and height were expressed as weight for height (WfH) and height standard deviation scores (HSDS), respectively. Twenty-five children had repeated duodenal biopsies after 1-2 years and 14 had a third biopsy after 3-7 years of GFD. Compliance was checked by regular interview and IgA antiendomysial antibody estimation (EMA). RESULTS: At diagnosis (n = 25), mean HSDS was -3.3 +/- 1.6 with 76% having a HSDS of <-2; 60% were undernourished (WfH mean 81.6 +/- 5.7). Over a mean follow up of 3.7 years, HSDS improved to -1.3 +/- 1.7 and 84% cases achieved normal nutrition. Mean height velocity was 13.9 cm during first year and 5.6 cm in subsequent years. Small-bowel biopsies at diagnosis showed subtotal villous atrophy (Marsh IIIb) in 18 (72%) and partial villous atrophy (Marsh IIIa) in seven (28%) patients. Repeat biopsy at 1-2 years showed shift from subtotal to partial villous atrophy in 94% (n = 17/18) and normalization in one patient. In patients with Marsh IIIa improvement of partial villous atrophy was observed in all. Immunoglobulin A endomysial antibody was negative in 81%. Repeat biopsies at 5 years of GFD showed improvement to Marsh I-II, but none normalized. CONCLUSION: The majority of children with CD show normalization of nutrition and growth after GFD. Small-bowel histology improves markedly but does not normalize even after 5 years of GFD.},

   abstract = {AIM: To determine the prevalence of gluten sensitive enteropathy (GSE) in a large group of patients with iron deficiency anemia (IDA) of obscure origin. METHODS: In this cross-sectional study, patients with IDA of obscure origin were screened for GSE. Anti-endomysial antibody (EMA) and tissue transglutaminase antibody (tTG) levels were evaluated and duodenal biopsies were taken and scored according to the Marsh classification. The diagnosis of GSE was based on a positive serological test and abnormal duodenal histology. Gluten free diet (GFD) was advised for all the GSE patients. RESULTS: Of the 4120 IDA patients referred to our Hematology departments, 206 (95 male) patients were found to have IDA of obscure origin. Thirty out of 206 patients (14.6%) had GSE. The mean age of GSE patients was 34.6 +/- 17.03 (range 10-72 years). The female to male ratio was 1.3:1. Sixteen patients had Marsh 3, 12 had Marsh 2, and 2 had Marsh 1 lesions. The severity of anemia was in parallel with the severity of duodenal lesions. Twenty-two GSE patients (73.3%) had no gastrointestinal symptoms. Fourteen GSE patients who adhered to GFD without receiving iron supplementation agreed to undergo follow up visits. After 6 mo of GFD, their mean hemoglobin levels (Hb) increased from 9.9 +/- 1.6 to 12.8 +/- 1.0 g/dL (P < 0.01). Interestingly, in 6 out of 14 patients who had Marsh 1/2 lesions (e.g. no villous atrophy) on duodenal biopsy, mean Hb increased from 11.0 +/- 1.1 to 13.1 +/- 1.0 g/dL (P < 0.01) while they did not receive any iron supplementation. CONCLUSION: There is a high prevalence (e.g. 14.6%) of GSE in patients with IDA of obscure origin. Gluten free diet can improve anemia in GSE patients who have mild duodenal lesions without villous atrophy.},

METHODS: The sera of 288 consecutive patients with Behcet's disease were screened with anti-endomysial antibody and anti-tissue transglutaminase antibody for celiac disease. Those with a positive test underwent upper gastrointestinal endoscopy and duodenal biopsies to confirm the diagnosis of celiac disease. The patients with celiac disease were put on a gluten free diet to evaluate its efficacy on the improvement of their lesions. RESULTS: Fourteen patients had positive anti-tissue transglutaminase antibody test (two with positive anti-endomysial antibody as well). Duodenal biopsies showed findings compatible with Marsh 3 in one and Marsh 1 in three other patients. All the diagnosed patients with celiac disease responded to the gluten free diet. CONCLUSION: Our findings didn't support any association between celiac disease and Behcet's disease in Iranian patients compared to the general population of Iran.},

STUDY DESIGN: We studied 54 untreated patients with CD (mean age, 7 years). We compared the serum concentration of calcium, magnesium, 25(OH)vitamin D3, alkaline phosphatase, and parathyroid hormone (PTH) of patients with CD with those of 60 healthy children. Children with CD with 2 laboratory alterations underwent DEXA examination, which was evaluated after 6 months of a gluten-free diet (GFD). RESULTS: The calcium and the 25(OH)vitamin D3 levels were lower in children with CD than in control subjects, and the PTH level was higher in children with CD than in control subjects (P < .001). Hyperparathyroidism was found in 29 children with CD. Twenty patients tested positive for 2 laboratory alterations, and 10 of them were osteopenic. After 6 months of GFD calcium, 25(OH)vit.D3 and PTH levels normalized, with the improvement of bone mineral density. CONCLUSIONS: Calcium metabolism defects are common in untreated children with CD, and they returned to normal after GFD. A detailed, time-consuming, and expensive study of bone metabolism is not necessary in children with CD shortly exposed to gluten who follow the GFD.},
