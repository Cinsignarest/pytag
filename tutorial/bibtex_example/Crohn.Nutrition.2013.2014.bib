   abstract = {BACKGROUND AND AIMS: To assess the reliability and validity of IMPACT-III (HR), a disease-specific, health-related quality of life instrument in Croatian children with inflammatory bowel disease. METHODS: In a multicenter study, 104 children participated in a validation study of IMPACT-III (HR) cross-culturally adapted for Croatia. Factor analysis was used to determine optimal domain structure for this cohort, analysis of Cronbach's alpha coefficients to test internal reliability, ANOVA to assess discriminant validity, and correlation with Pediatric Quality of Life Inventory, Version 4.0 (PedsQL) using Pearson correlation coefficients to assess concurrent validity. RESULTS: Cronbach's alpha for the IMPACT-III (HR) total score was 0.92. The most robust factor solution was a 5-domain structure: Symptoms, Concerns, Socializing, Body Image, and Worry about Stool, all of which demonstrated good internal reliability (alpha=0.60-0.89), but two items were dropped to achieve this. Discriminant validity was demonstrated by significant differences (P<0.001) in mean IMPACT-III (HR) scores between quiescent and mild or moderate-severe disease activity groups for total (148 vs. 139 or 125) and following factor scores: Symptoms (84 vs. 71 or 61), Socializing (91 vs. 83 or 76), and Worry about Stool (significant only between quiescent and moderate-severe groups, 90 vs. 62, respectively). Concurrent validity of IMPACT-III (HR) with PedsQL showed significant correlation, which was strongest when similar domains were compared. CONCLUSION: IMPACT-III (HR) appears to be useful tool to measure health-related quality of life in Croatian children with Crohn's disease and ulcerative colitis.},

   abstract = {BACKGROUND: As a result of technological and analytical advances, genome-wide characterization of key epigenetic alterations is now feasible in complex diseases. We hypothesized that this may provide important insights into gene-environmental interactions in Crohn's disease (CD) and is especially pertinent to early onset disease. METHODS: The Illumina 450K platform was applied to assess epigenome-wide methylation profiles in circulating leukocyte DNA in discovery and replication pediatric CD cohorts and controls. Data were corrected for differential leukocyte proportions. Targeted replication was performed in adults using pyrosequencing. Methylation changes were correlated with gene expression in blood and intestinal mucosa. RESULTS: We identified 65 individual CpG sites with methylation alterations achieving epigenome-wide significance after Bonferroni correction (P < 1.1 x 10(-7)), and 19 differently methylated regions displaying unidirectional methylation change. There was a highly significant enrichment of methylation changes around GWAS single nucleotide polymorphisms (P = 3.7 x 10(-7)), notably the HLA region and MIR21. Two-locus discriminant analysis in the discovery cohort predicted disease in the pediatric replication cohort with high accuracy (area under the curve, 0.98). The findings strongly implicate the transcriptional start site of MIR21 as a region of extended epigenetic alteration, containing the most significant individual probes (P = 1.97 x 10(-15)) within a GWAS risk locus. In extension studies, we confirmed hypomethylation of MIR21 in adults (P = 6.6 x 10(-5), n = 172) and show increased mRNA expression in leukocytes (P < 0.005, n = 66) and in the inflamed intestine (P = 1.4 x 10(-6), n = 99). CONCLUSIONS: We demonstrate highly significant and replicable differences in DNA methylation in CD, defining the disease-associated epigenome. The data strongly implicate known GWAS loci, with compelling evidence implicating MIR21 and the HLA region.},

   abstract = {N-Palmitoylethanolamine or palmitoylethanolamide (PEA) is an anti-inflammatory compound that was recently shown to exert peroxisome proliferator-activated receptor-alpha-dependent beneficial effects on colon inflammation. The actions of PEA are terminated following hydrolysis by 2 enzymes: fatty acid amide hydrolase (FAAH), and the less-studied N-acylethanolamine-hydrolyzing acid amidase (NAAA). This study aims to investigate the effects of inhibiting the enzymes responsible for PEA hydrolysis in colon inflammation in order to propose a potential therapeutic target for inflammatory bowel diseases (IBDs). Two murine models of IBD were used to assess the effects of NAAA inhibition, FAAH inhibition, and PEA on macroscopic signs of colon inflammation, macrophage/neutrophil infiltration, and the expression of proinflammatory mediators in the colon, as well as on the colitis-related systemic inflammation. NAAA inhibition increases PEA levels in the colon and reduces colon inflammation and systemic inflammation, similarly to PEA. FAAH inhibition, however, does not increase PEA levels in the colon and does not affect the macroscopic signs of colon inflammation or immune cell infiltration. This is the first report of an anti-inflammatory effect of a systemically administered NAAA inhibitor. Because NAAA is the enzyme responsible for the control of PEA levels in the colon, we put forth this enzyme as a potential therapeutic target in chronic inflammation in general and IBD in particular.},

   abstract = {PURPOSE: Poor sleep quality is associated with adverse health consequences. Sleep disturbances can impact the immune function and process of inflammation. The relationship between sleep quality and the inflammatory bowel disease (IBD) has not been well studied. METHODS: A prospective observational cohort study was performed to assess the correlation of the quality of sleep and disease activity in IBD. We used the Pittsburgh Sleep Quality Index (PSQI) to measure sleep quality. IBD disease activity was measured by using the Harvey-Bradshaw Index or Modified Mayo Score. RESULTS: Forty-one patients were enrolled with mean age of 37 +/- 15.4 years and 27 (66%) women. Abnormal PSQI was present in all 23 (100%) of the clinically active patients and in 13 (72%) of those with inactive disease (odds ratio = 2.8, P = 0.007). All 30 patients with histologic evidence of inflammation on recent ileocolonoscopy also had abnormal PSQI scores, which were independent of their clinical disease activity status. Only 6 of 11 patients with histologically quiescent disease had abnormal PSQI scores (odds ratio = 6.0, P < 0.0001). There was no difference in disease type, use of steroids, the presence of depression or anxiety, and body mass index between the patients with normal and abnormal sleep. An abnormal PSQI had a positive predictive value for histologic inflammatory activity of 83%. CONCLUSIONS: Our data show a strong association between clinically active IBD and poor sleep quality and demonstrate that patients in clinical remission with abnormal sleep have a high likelihood of subclinical disease activity.},

   abstract = {BACKGROUND: Early-onset (EO) pediatric inflammatory bowel diseases (IBD) seem to be more extensive than those with a later onset. To test this hypothesis, we examined the phenotype and disease course of patients with IBD diagnosis at 0 to 5 years, compared with the ranges 6 to 11 and 12 to 18 years. METHODS: Anatomic locations and behaviors were assessed according to Paris classification in 506 consecutive patients: 224 Crohn's disease, 245 ulcerative colitis, and 37 IBD-unclassified. RESULTS: Eleven percent of patients were in the range 0 to 5 years, 39% in 6 to 11 years, and 50% in 12 to 18 years. Ulcerative colitis was the most frequent diagnosis in EO-IBD and in 6- to 11-year-old group, whereas Crohn's disease was predominant in older children. A classification as IBD-unclassified was more common in the range 0 to 5 years compared with the other groups (P < 0.005). EO Crohn's disease showed a more frequent isolated colonic (P < 0.005) and upper gastrointestinal involvement than later-onset disease. Sixty-two percent of the patients in the 0 to 5 years range had pancolonic ulcerative colitis, compared with 38% of 6 to 11 years (P = 0.02) and 31% of 12-18 years (P = 0.002) range. No statistical difference for family history for IBD was found in the 3-year age groups. Therapies at the diagnosis were similar for all children. However, at latest follow-up, a significantly higher proportion of younger children were under steroids compared with older groups (P < 0.05). Surgical risk did not differ according to age. CONCLUSIONS: EO-IBD exhibits an extensive phenotype and benefit from aggressive treatment strategies, although surgical risk is similar to later-onset disease. A family history for IBD is not common in EO disease.},

   abstract = {IBD includes two classic entities, Crohn's disease and ulcerative colitis, and a third undetermined form (IBD-U), characterized by a chronic relapsing course resulting in a high rate of morbidity and impaired quality of life. Children with IBD are vulnerable in terms of growth failure, malnutrition and emotional effects. The aims of therapy have now transitioned from symptomatic control to the achievement of mucosal healing and deep remission. This type of therapy has been made possible by the advent of disease-modifying drugs, such as biologic agents, which are capable of interrupting the inflammatory cascade underlying IBD. Biologic agents are generally administered in patients who are refractory to conventional therapies. However, there is growing support that such agents could be used in the initial phases of the disease, typically in paediatric patients, to interrupt and cease the inflammatory process. Until several years ago, most therapeutic programmes in paediatric patients with IBD were borrowed from adult trials, whereas paediatric studies were often retrospective and uncontrolled. However, guidelines on therapeutic management of paediatric IBD and controlled, prospective, randomized trials including children with IBD have now been published. Here, the current knowledge concerning treatment options for children with IBD are reported. We also highlight the effectiveness and safety of new therapeutic advances in these paediatric patients.},

The underlying mechanism is multifactorial and includes poor nutrition, chronic inflammation, and the prolonged use of steroids. Despite major advances in the treatment of CD, current cohorts of children continue to display a deficit in linear growth and may qualify for growth-promoting hormonal therapy. However, currently there is limited evidence to support the use of endocrine therapy directed primarily at improving growth. This review is aimed at summarising the current evidence for growth impairment in inflammatory bowel disease and discusses the rationale for using growth promoting therapy.},

MRI findings were compared with clinical, biological, endoscopic and other imaging data. PATIENTS AND METHODS: Studies of MRI enterography use in patients younger than 18 years of age were reviewed. Patients received 500-1000mL of polyethylene glycol one hour before examination (1.5-TMR). T2 HASTE sequences with or without fat saturation, T2 true-FISP, T1 with fat saturation, pre- and post gadolinium-enhanced VIBE sequences, and dynamic and diffusion HASTE were acquired. Thickening of the bowel wall, mucosal enhancement, and extra-luminal complications were evaluated. Five MRI patterns (normal, fibrosis, mild, moderate, and severe transmural activity) were defined. Findings were compared with PCDAI scores, inflammatory parameters, and endoscopic and histological results. RESULTS: Twenty-two studies were reviewed. Optimal intestinal distension was present in 82% of the cases. Mild side effects were observed in 12% of patients. There was a significant relationship between MRI patterns and PCDAI scores (P=.002), sedimentation rate (P=.006) and serum PCR levels (P=.047) and a non-significant relationship with the histology (P=.571). MRI enterography correctly assessed the ileal (80%) and colonic (66%) extension. Extra-luminal complications unrelated to MRI classification (P=.274) were reported in 86.4% of studies. CONCLUSIONS: There was a significant relationship between MRI patterns and PCR, sedimentation rate, and PCDAI scores. MRI enterography showed excellent agreement with ileoscopies, and allowed endoscopically non-accessible areas to be assessed, as well as the diagnosis of extra-luminal complications without irradiation.},

   abstract = {OBJECTIVES: Although anti-tumor necrosis factor (TNF) therapy is the treatment of choice for perianal fistulizing Crohn's disease (CD), the efficacy and safety of anti-TNF therapy in enterocutaneous fistula (ECF) remains unclear. METHODS: Between January 2008 and December 2009, we retrospectively reviewed the outcomes of all CD patients with ECF (excluding perianal fistula) treated with anti-TNF therapy followed up in Groupe d'Etude Therapeutique des Affections Inflammatoires du tube Digestif (GETAID) centers. ECF closure and tolerance of anti-TNF therapy were studied using univariate and multivariate analyses. RESULTS: Forty-eight patients (twenty-six women; median age 34.6 (interquartile range=25.0-45.5) years) were included in this study. The median follow-up period was 3.0 (2.0-6.6) years. The fistula was located in the small bowel (n=38), duodenum (n=1), and colon (n=9). The fistula has been developed in ileocolonic anastomosis in 17 (35%) cases. Sixteen patients (33%) had complex fistulas with multiple tracts and eleven patients (23%) had a high ECF output (if wearing an ostomy bag). Complete ECF closure was achieved in 16 (33%) patients, of whom eight relapsed during the follow-up period. In multivariate analysis, complete ECF closure was associated with the absence of multiple ECF tracts and associated stenosis. An abdominal abscess developed in 15 (31%) patients. ECF resection was needed in 26 (54%) patients. One patient died after surgery owing to abdominal sepsis. CONCLUSIONS: In CD patients with ECF, anti-TNF therapy may be effective in up to one-third of patients, especially in the absence of stenosis and complex fistula. A careful selection of patients is mandatory to prevent treatment failure and improves the safety.},

   abstract = {BACKGROUND: Crohn disease (CD) and ulcerative colitis (UC) are 2 common inflammatory bowel diseases (IBDs) associated with intestinal inflammation and tissue damage. Oxidative stress is suggested to play a major role in the initiation and progression of IBD. Vitamin C (ascorbate, ascorbic acid) supplementation has reduced oxidative stress in persons with IBD. The role of ascorbate transporters in IBD remains to be determined. SLC23A1 is a major ascorbate transporter in the intestinal tract, and some of its genetic variants have been associated with severely decreased ascorbate transport and lower systemic concentrations. OBJECTIVE: This study aimed to determine whether common genetic variants in the vitamin C transporter SLC23A1 are associated with the risk of IBD. DESIGN: Genomic DNA samples from patients with CD (n = 162) and UC (n = 149) from the Manitoba IBD Cohort Study and ethnically matched controls (n = 142) were genotyped for 3 SLC23A1 polymorphisms (rs6596473, rs33972313, and rs10063949) by using TaqMan assays. RESULTS: Variation at rs10063949 (G allele for heterozygote and homozygote) was associated with increased susceptibility to CD (OR: 2.54; 95% CI: 1.38, 4.66; OR: 4.72; 95% CI: 2.53, 8.81; P < 0.0001; respectively). A strong linkage disequilibrium (LD) was observed across the SLC23A1 region (variation rs6596473 with rs10063949) for CD and UC (D' = 0.94 and 0.96, respectively). The risk alleles confirmed a haplotype (CGG) that is carried more in CD patients (65.3%, P < 0.0001) than in controls (43.5%). CONCLUSIONS: A genetic variant (rs10063949-G) in the SLC23A1 ascorbate transporter locus was identified and is associated with an increased risk of CD in a white Canadian IBD cohort. The presented evidence that SLC23A1 variations can modulate the risk of CD has implications for understanding ascorbate transport in CD patients and provides a novel opportunity toward individualized nutritional therapy for patients carrying the disease-associated genotype.},

   abstract = {BACKGROUND & AIMS: Sleep deprivation is associated with production of inflammatory cytokines. Disturbed sleep quality has been associated with increased risk of disease flare in patients with Crohn's disease (CD) or ulcerative colitis (UC). However, the association between sleep and risk of incident CD and UC has not been previously examined. METHODS: We conducted a prospective study of women who were enrolled in the Nurses' Health Study (NHS) I since 1976 and NHS II since 1989 and followed through detailed biennial questionnaires with >90% follow-up. We examined the association of sleep duration reported in 1986 in NHS I and 2001 in NHS II with incident CD and UC, diagnosed through 2010, in NHS I and 2009 in NHS II. Cox proportional hazards models adjusting for potential confounders were used to calculate hazard ratios and 95% confidence intervals (CIs). RESULTS: Among 151,871 women, we confirmed 191 cases of CD (incidence, 8/100,000 person-years) and 230 cases of UC (incidence, 10/100,000 person-years) over 2,292,849 person-years. Compared with women with reported usual sleep durations of 7-8 h/day (incidence, 8/100,000 person-years), women with reported sleep duration <6 h/day (11/100,000 person-years) or >9 h/day (20/100,000 person-years) had a higher incidence of UC (P < .05). The multivariate hazard ratios for UC were 1.51 (95% CI, 1.10-2.09) for sleep durations <6 h/day and 2.05 (95% CI, 1.44-2.92) for sleep durations >9 h/day, compared with sleep durations of 7-8 h/day. In contrast, sleep duration did not modify risk of CD. Duration of rotating night shift work was not associated with CD or UC. CONCLUSIONS: On the basis of data from the NHS I and II, less than 6 hours sleep/day and more than 9 hours sleep/day are each associated with an increased risk of UC. Further studies are needed to evaluate sleep as a modifiable risk factor in the pathogenesis and progression of IBD.},

In a prospective cohort study of 1659 patients with Crohn's disease and 946 patients with ulcerative colitis seen at 7 high-volume referral centers, we collected data on demographics, disease characteristics, and medical and surgical treatments. We used logistic regression to determine differences in treatment among centers, controlling for potential confounders. We found significant variations among centers in the treatment of Crohn's disease with immunomodulators (odds ratio [OR], 3.34; 95% confidence interval [CI], 2.09-5.32) but not anti-tumor necrosis factor agents (OR, 1.64; 95% CI, 0.97-2.77). There was less variation in the treatment of ulcerative colitis; we found no difference in use of immunomodulators (OR, 1.83; 95% CI, 1.00-3.36) or anti-tumor necrosis factor therapy (OR, 0.81; 95% CI, 0.40-1.65). The development and implementation of evidence-based standards of care for inflammatory bowel disease may help reduce variation and improve outcomes.},

   abstract = {INTRODUCTION: Serious infections are an important side effect of immunosuppressive therapy used to treat Crohn's disease (CD) and ulcerative colitis (UC). There have been no nationally representative studies examining the spectrum of infection related hospitalizations in patients with IBD. METHODS: Our study consisted of all adult CD and UC related hospitalizations from the Nationwide Inpatient Sample 2007, a national hospitalization database in the United States. We then identified all infection-related hospitalizations through codes for either the specific infections or disease processes (sepsis, pneumonia, etc.). Predictors of infections as well as the excess morbidity associated with infections were determined using multivariate regression models. RESULTS: There were an estimated 67,221 hospitalizations related to infections in IBD patients, comprising 27.5% of all IBD hospitalizations. On multivariate analysis, infections were independently associated with age, co-morbidity, malnutrition, TPN, and bowel surgery. Infection-related hospitalizations had a four-fold greater mortality (OR 4.4, 95% CI 3.7-5.2). However, this varied by type of infection with the strongest effect seen for sepsis (OR 15.3, 95% CI 12.4-18.6), pneumonia (OR 3.6, 95% CI 2.9-4.5) and C. difficile (OR 3.2, 95% CI 2.6-4.0), and weaker effects for urinary infections (OR 1.4, 95%CI 1.1-1.7). Infections were also associated with an estimated 2.3 days excess hospital stay (95% CI 2.2-2.5) and $12,482 in hospitalization charges. CONCLUSION: Infections account for significant morbidity and mortality in patients with IBD and disproportionately impact older IBD patients with greater co-morbidity. Pneumonia, sepsis and C difficile infection are associated with the greatest excess mortality risk.},

   abstract = {Crohn's disease is a chronic, progressive and disabling condition. New therapeutic goals have emerged in Crohn's disease such as the need to look beyond symptoms by achieving mucosal healing that is known to be associated with better outcomes. Anti-TNF (Tumour Necrosis Factor) therapy is the most potent drug class to induce and maintain mucosal healing in Crohn's disease. Recent evidence indicates that the efficacy profile of thiopurines has been overestimated while the increased risk of malignancies (lymphoma, non-melanoma skin cancers, myeloid disorders) has been underestimated. Methotrexate is well-tolerated, but its potential for disease modification is unknown. Achieving mucosal healing in patients with early Crohn's disease might be the best way to change disease course and patients' life. In 2014, anti-TNF treatment should be the first-line therapy in patients with Crohn's disease who suffer from severe and/or complicated disease and in those with poor prognostic factors. In the remaining patients, a rapid step-up approach based on a tight monitoring is recommended.},

Computed tomography showed increased mural thickness of the ileum and increased mesenteric fat density. Colonoscopic findings revealed a longitudinal ulcer in the terminal ileum and irregularly shaped ulcers and a longitudinal ulcer scar in the descending colon. Histopathological analysis of biopsy specimens from the ileum and descending colon showed non-caseating epithelioid cell granuloma. On the basis of these findings, the condition of the patient was diagnosed as ileocolonic Crohn's disease, and the patient received parenteral nutrition, followed by elemental diet. The patient was responsive to nutrition therapy, and the amount of uric protein decreased as her Crohn's disease activity index decreased. In conclusion, we assume that the Crohn's disease activity correlated with that of IgA nephropathy.},

   abstract = {Clinical trials are reviewed, involving proteins and peptides derived from milk (predominantly bovine), with the exception of lactoferrin, which will be the subject of another article. The most explored milk fraction is alpha-lactalbumin (LA), which is often applied with glycomacropeptide (GMP) - a casein degradation product. These milk constituents are used in health-promoting infant and adult formulae as well as in a modified form (HAMLET) to treat cancer. Lactoperoxidase (LCP) is used as an additive to mouth hygiene products and as a salivary substitute. Casein derivatives are applied, in addition, in the dry mouth syndrome. On the other hand, casein hydrolysates, containing active tripeptides, found application in hypertension and in type 2 diabetes. Lysozyme is routinely used for food conservation and in pharmaceutical products. It was successfully used in premature infants with concomitant diseases to improve health parameters. When used as prophylaxis in patients with scheduled surgery, it significantly reduced the incidence of hepatitis resulting from blood transfusion. Lysozyme was also used in infected children as an antimicrobial agent showing synergistic effects in combination with different antibiotics. Proline-rich polypeptide (PRP) was introduced to therapy of Alzheimer's disease patients. The therapeutic value of PRP was proved in several clinical trials and supported by studies on its mechanism of action. Concentrated immunoglobulin preparations from colostrum and milk of hyperimmunized cows showed efficacy in prevention of infections by bacteria, viruses and protozoa. A nutrition formula with milk-derived TGF-beta2 (Modulen IBD(R)) found application in treatment of pediatric Crohn's disease. In conclusion, the preparations containing milk-derived products are safe and effective measures in prevention and treatment of infections as well as autoimmune and neoplastic diseases.},

   abstract = {BACKGROUND: Anti tumor necrosis factor alpha (TNFalpha) agents have become widely used in pediatric inflammatory bowel disease (IBD). So far, only few studies examined the long-term results of anti-TNFalpha treatment in children with IBD. METHODS: The long-term outcome of pediatric patients with IBD was assessed retrospectively in a multicenter cohort of children treated with anti-TNFalpha beyond induction treatment. Short- and long-term response rates, predictors for loss of response, data on growth and laboratory parameters were assessed. RESULTS: 120 patients [101 crohn's disease (CD), 19 ulcerative colitis (UC) or indeterminate colitis (IC)] received either infliximab or adalimumab. The mean age at initiation of anti-TNFalpha was 13.4 +/- 3.9 years and the median duration of anti-TNFalpha treatment was 15 months (range: 2-90). Overall, 89% of the cohort experienced short-term response following induction. Response was associated with improvement in weight and BMI Z-scores (p<0.001) but not with linear growth. Responders experienced a significant decrease in erythrocyte sedimentation rate (ESR) and C reactive protein (CRP) during treatment (p<0.001). Albumin and hemoglobin both improved but only albumin increased significantly (p<0.001). The cumulative probability of losing response to anti-TNFalpha treatment was 17%, 38%, and 49% after 1, 3, and 5 years, respectively. Responders had a significantly lower weight and BMI Z-scores at initiation of anti-TNFalpha treatment in compared to non-responders (p=0.04 and 0.02 respectively). CONCLUSIONS: Our long term cohort supports the current evidence on the effectiveness and safety of anti-TNFalpha treatment in children with IBD. Response to treatment was interestingly associated with lower weight and BMI.},

   abstract = {BACKGROUND AND AIMS: Clostridium difficile is the major cause of antibiotic-associated diarrhea and is the most well known bacterial pathogen associated with inflammatory bowel disease (IBD). Enterotoxigenic Clostridium perfringens has also been detected in up to 15% of antibiotic-associated diarrhea cases, and it has not been found in healthy people. The aim of this study was to investigate the prevalence of C. perfringens infection in pediatric patients with IBD. METHODS: This was a prospective, controlled study evaluating pediatric IBD patients in the Department of Pediatric Gastroenterology and Nutrition in Warsaw, Poland. All of the patients were diagnosed according to the Porto criteria. There were two control groups: (1) non-IBD patients that were suspected for bacterial diarrhea and (2) healthy children. Stool samples were collected on the day of admission. C. perfringens infection diagnosis was based on a positive stool enzyme immunoassay (C. perfringens enterotoxin test kit TechLab). RESULTS: 91 fecal specimens from patients with IBD were collected. The average patient age was 11.7 years in IBD group, 7.4 years in non-IBD patients with diarrhea, and 7.4 years in healthy children. The prevalence of C. perfringens infection was 9% (8/91; CI 95% 4.6-16.4). There were more Crohn's patients (6/8) in the C. perfringens positive group. There was no C. perfringens infection in the two control groups. CONCLUSION: Our pilot data add evidence to the hypothesis that Clostridia other than C. difficile may play a significant role in the clinical course of IBD. However, further studies are needed to confirm this.},

This was a questionnaire-based study. 242 patients with IBD and 142 controls were enrolled in the study. Of patients with IBD, 7.8% received an influenza vaccine, compared to 18.3% of controls (P = 0.0013). There were no statistically significant differences in time from IBD diagnosis, disease activity and in drugs, between vaccinated and non-vaccinated IBD children. In conclusion, the data of our study demonstrate an alarmingly poor influenza vaccination status in the majority of children with IBD. Therefore, there is an unmet need to implement better influenza vaccination strategies for this group of patients.},

   abstract = {OBJECTIVES: Because of the fluctuating and occasional character of Crohn's disease (CD), patients have to cope with a changeable condition of health. Personal perceived control is known to be an important element of adaptation to their medical condition. The objectives of this work are to determine if perceived personal control is predictive of the clinical activity of the disease and of psychological distress (depression, anxiety). METHODS: The Hospital Anxiety Depression Scale (HADS), the causal dimension scale and the Clinical Global Impression (CGI; assessing perceived severity) were administered to 160 patients affected by Crohn's disease. Indicators of inflammation (CRP), disease duration and clinical activity of the disease were also asessed. RESULTS: Globally, CD patients perceive their disease as being personally neither controllable nor uncontrollable. Whereas psychological distress is significantly higher when the disease is active, the relationship between the variables appears complex. The feeling of personal control is explained by the clinical activity of the disease (p=.0001) and by the perception that CD is unstable (p<.00001) and globally impacts the life of patients (p=.001). Nevertheless perception of personal control does not explain the clinical activity of the disease. Finally, psychological distress is explained by the perception that the medical team is unable to control the disease (p=.00001) and by the global consequences of the disease on life (p<.005). CONCLUSIONS: Psychological treatments should take these dimensions into account so as to improve the well-being and medical conditions of patients.},

   abstract = {BACKGROUND AND AIMS: Eosinophils are implicated in the pathogenesis of inflammatory bowel disease (IBD). A subset of IBD patients develops blood eosinophilia, and the clinical profile of these patients is undefined. We sought to characterize IBD patients with and without eosinophilia. METHODS: We studied a prospective registry of 1,176 IBD patients followed in a tertiary referral center. Patients who developed eosinophilia at any time were identified by electronic medical record query. We performed a chart review case-control study comparing patients with recurrent eosinophilia versus randomly selected disease-matched patients with no history of eosinophilia. Histological analysis was performed on selected cases and controls. RESULTS: Eosinophilia at any time was more prevalent in ulcerative colitis (UC) patients than Crohn's disease patients (22.2 versus 12.7%), as was recurrent eosinophilia (3.4 versus 0.7%). UC patients with recurrent eosinophilia were predominantly male compared with the control UC population (81.3 versus 46.9%) and had higher rates of colectomy for either medically refractory disease or dysplasia/cancer than control UC patients (56.3 versus 15.6%). Primary sclerosing cholangitis (PSC) occurred in 37.5% of UC patients with recurrent eosinophilia compared with only 3.1% in the UC controls. Histological analysis of random diagnostic samples from UC patients with recurrent eosinophilia demonstrated a normal eosinophil pattern as seen in the control UC population. CONCLUSIONS: Eosinophilia-associated UC is a subgroup of IBD associated with severe colitis and PSC. Further studies are warranted to characterize molecular mechanisms underlying eosinophilia-associated UC and to determine optimal approaches for therapy.},

   abstract = {Crohn's disease (CD) is characterized as a chronic immune-mediated inflammatory disorder of the gastrointestinal tract. Current consensus surrounding the cause of the disease suggests a complex interplay between genetic susceptibility, the intestinal microbiome and environmental factors, leading to the aberrant Th1 and Th17 immune cell mediated response. Vitamin D deficiency is common in CD patients, and long-standing deficiency has been associated with reduced bone mineral density (BMD). Accumulating evidence now suggests that in addition to maintaining skeletal integrity, vitamin D also plays an integral role in regulating the general immune response, a function employed via its genomic actions on the vitamin D receptor (VDR). The VDR is expressed in all immune cells and both directly and indirectly targeted by the bioactive form of vitamin D, 1,25-Dihydroxyvitamin D (1,25[OH]2D). Impaired regulation or deficiency of the vitamin has been linked to the promotion of self-reactive T cell development, loss of immune tolerance to self-structures, and experimental colitis in animal models, whereas the subsequent administration of the vitamin in these models resulted in the improvement of immune-mediated symptoms. In addition, low vitamin D has been associated with disease activity in CD patients, and supplementation appears to be beneficial in improving clinical scores and reducing inflammation. Therefore, the primary aims of this article were to review the molecular evidence supporting the immunoregulatory roles of vitamin D and its supplementation in the CD patient, based on existing literature. The physiological processes, accepted serum concentration values, and its well-recognized role in bone health were also summarized.},

   abstract = {BACKGROUND: The most common indications for surgery for patients with ileocolic Crohn's disease are fibrostenotic or perforating disease. The objective was to compare surgical outcomes of patients with perforating versus non-perforating disease following ileocolic resection. METHODS: This was a retrospective review of all patients who had their first ileocolic resection between 1990 and 2010, identified from a prospectively maintained inflammatory bowel disease database. Demographic information, preoperative medication, intraoperative findings and postoperative outcome data were collected. Outcomes in patients who had an abscess drained before surgery or were found to have a fistula or abscess at surgery or at pathology were compared with outcomes in all others. RESULTS: A total of 434 patients (56.2 per cent women) were included, 293 with perforating and 141 with non-perforating disease. Median age, tobacco use, and preoperative steroid and biological agent use were similar in the two groups. Forty patients (13.7 per cent) in the perforating group had abscesses drained before surgery and 251 patients had at least one fistula, most commonly to the sigmoid colon. Patients with perforating disease were more likely to require preoperative total parenteral nutrition, need another resection, have an ileostomy and a longer mean postoperative stay, and less likely to undergo a laparoscopic procedure. Patients in this group also developed more postoperative abscesses or leaks (4.8 versus 0 per cent; P = 0.006). The reoperation rate was similar (3.1 versus 0.7 per cent; P = 0.178). CONCLUSION: Patients with penetrating Crohn's disease are more likely to require a more complex procedure, and an ileostomy, and to a have longer postoperative stay.},

   abstract = {BACKGROUND AND AIMS: The elderly represent a growing demographic of patients with IBD. No study has previously described variations in care or medication prescriptions in senior patients with IBD. We compared prescription rates among elderly patients with IBD in four countries using health administrative data. METHODS: Databases from the United States (US), United Kingdom (UK), Denmark and Canada were queried. Variation in prescription rates between countries was assessed in patients >/=65y with prevalent IBD who had >/=1 prescription for an IBD-related medication in a given quarter between 2004 and 2009. Patients were identified using previously-reported, validated algorithms. Country-specific rates were compared in each quarter using Fisher's exact test. RESULTS: In patients with Crohn's disease, Canada and US had higher prescription rates for oral 5-ASA (P<0.0001 in all quarters) and infliximab (P<0.05 in 22/24 quarters), while the US had higher rates of thiopurine usage (P<0.05 in 23/24 quarters). Canada had greater rates of methotrexate prescriptions (P<0.05 in 21/24 quarters analyzed). In patients with ulcerative colitis (UC), rates of oral steroid usage was lowest in the US (P<0.05 in 22/24 quarters) and oral 5-ASA use was highest in the US and Canada (P<0.0001 in all quarters). Canada and Denmark used more rectal therapy than the US. Infliximab usage in UC was significantly higher in the US and Canada after 2006. CONCLUSIONS: Significant variation in medication prescription rates exists among countries. Future research should assess whether these differences were associated with disparities in outcomes and health care costs.},

   abstract = {OBJECTIVE: Health administrative databases can be used to track disease incidence, outcomes, and care quality. Case validation is necessary to ensure accurate disease ascertainment using these databases. In this study, we aimed to validate adult-onset inflammatory bowel disease (IBD) identification algorithms. STUDY DESIGN AND SETTING: We used two large cohorts of incident patients from Ontario, Canada to validate algorithms. We linked information extracted from charts to health administrative data and compared the accuracy of various algorithms. In addition, we validated an algorithm to distinguish patients with Crohn's from those with ulcerative colitis and assessed the adequate look-back period to distinguish incident from prevalent cases. RESULTS: Over 5,000 algorithms were tested. The most accurate algorithm to identify patients 18 to 64 years at diagnosis was five physician contacts or hospitalizations within 4 years (sensitivity, 76.8%; specificity, 96.2%; positive predictive value (PPV), 81.4%; negative predictive value (NPV), 95.0%). In patients >/=65 years at diagnosis, adding a pharmacy claim for an IBD-related medication improved accuracy. CONCLUSION: Patients with adult-onset incident IBD can be accurately identified from within health administrative data. The validated algorithms will be applied to administrative data to expand the Ontario Crohn's and Colitis Cohort to all patients with IBD in the province of Ontario.},

   abstract = {BACKGROUND & AIMS: The Paris pediatric modification of the Montreal classification defines very early onset inflammatory bowel disease (VEO-IBD) as a form of IBD distinct from that of older children. We compared the incidence and outcomes of VEO-IBD with those of IBD in older children. METHODS: We performed a population-based retrospective cohort study of all children diagnosed with IBD in Ontario, Canada, from 1994 through 2009. Trends in standardized incidence were calculated using Poisson regression. We compared outpatient and emergency department visits, hospitalizations, and surgeries among children diagnosed with IBD when they were younger than age 6, ages 6-9.9, and older than age 10 years. Multivariable models were adjusted for income and stratified by sex. RESULTS: The incidence of IBD increased from 9.4 per 100,000 children (95% confidence interval [CI], 8.2-10.8/100,000 children) in 1994 to 13.2 per 100,000 children (95% CI, 11.9-14.6/100,000 children) in 2009 (P < .0001). The incidence increased by 7.4% per year among children younger than 6 years old and 6-9.9 years old, and by 2.2% per year among children >/=10 years old. IBD-related outpatient visits were less frequent among children <6 years old than >/=10 years old (odds ratio for female patients, 0.67; 95% CI, 0.58-0.78; odds ratio for male patients, 0.86; 95% CI, 0.75-0.98). Hazard ratios [HRs] for hospitalization were lower for children <6 years old (female HR, 0.70; 95% CI, 0.56-0.87; male HR, 1.12; 95% CI, 0.94-1.33) than for older children. HRs for surgery among children <6 years old with Crohn's disease were 0.35 for female patients (95% CI, 0.16-0.78) and 0.59 for male patients (95% CI, 0.34-0.99). HRs for children <6 years old with ulcerative colitis were 0.88 for female patients (95% CI, 0.47-1.63) and 0.42 for male patients (95% CI, 0.21-0.85). There was no difference in hospitalization or surgery rates among children 6-9.9 years old vs those >/=10 years old. CONCLUSIONS: Based on a retrospective cohort study, the incidence of VEO-IBD increased from 1994 through 2009. Children diagnosed with IBD before they were 6 years old used fewer health services and had lower rates of surgery than children diagnosed when they were 10 years or older.},

   abstract = {BACKGROUND: International cohort studies have reported increased incidence of inflammatory bowel disease (IBD) in recent years, and Canada has among the highest rates of IBD in the world. This study assessed incidence and prevalence of IBD in Ontario, the most populous province of Canada, to determine changing trends in age of onset. METHODS: We used a population-based cohort derived from validated health administrative data consisting of all Ontario residents living with IBD from 1999 to 2008. We determined trends over time using Poisson regression analysis, assessing rates in 10-year age groups, children, adults, and the elderly. RESULTS: In 2008, 68,071 people were living with IBD among 12,738,350 people (standardized prevalence 534.3 per 100,000 people). Between 1999 and 2008, standardized IBD incidence increased from 21.3 to 26.2 per 100,000 (2.3% per yr, P < 0.0001). Incidence of Crohn's increased from 9.6 to 12.1 per 100,000 (1.9% per yr, P < 0.0001). Ulcerative colitis incidence increased from 10.7 to 12.1 per 100,000 (2.0% per yr, P < 0.0001). For IBD, incidence increased significantly in people younger than 10 years of age (9.7% per yr, P < 0.0001), 10 to 19 years of age (3.8% per yr, P < 0.0001), 30 to 39 years of age (1.8% per yr, P = 0.0006), 40 to 49 years of age (2.8% per yr, P = 0.0001), and 50 to 59 years of age (2.8% per yr, P < 0.0001). Incidence was stable in patients older than 65 years of age at diagnosis (-0.1% per yr, P = 0.73). Although incidence did not change significantly over time in adults 20 to 29 years, IBD incidence peaked in this age group. CONCLUSIONS: Ontario has among the highest prevalence of IBD in the world. Incidence of IBD increased between 1999 and 2008, owing to increased incidence in children and adults, with stable rates in elderly people. These findings demonstrate the changing age demographics and growing burden of IBD in Ontario, Canada.},

   abstract = {OBJECTIVES: Recent reports demonstrate a link between inflammatory bowel disease (IBD) and sleep disturbance. Increased psychiatric dysfunction is consistently reported in patients with IBD. Our objective is to examine relations among sleep disturbance, inflammation, and psychiatric dysfunction in a pediatric population with Crohn disease (CD) and depression. METHODS: Pediatric patients with CD with depression (n = 96) and healthy controls (n = 19) completed measures of sleep (Pittsburgh Sleep Quality Index [PSQI]), depression, anxiety, and abdominal pain, and provided blood for inflammatory markers. CD activity was determined by the Pediatric Crohn's Disease Activity Index. Factor analysis was performed on subscales of the PSQI to derive measures of sleep disturbance. Univariate and multivariate regression analyses assessed relations between sleep disturbance, psychosocial, and biological measures of CD and psychiatric dysfunction. RESULTS: Sleep disturbance in depressed youth with CD was significantly greater than healthy controls, and was significantly related to measures of abdominal pain, depression, and anxiety, but not biomarkers of inflammation. Factor analysis of the PSQI demonstrated a 2-factor solution. The first factor, termed "Qualitative," included Subjective Sleep Quality, Daytime Dysfunction, Sleep Disturbance, and Sleep Latency, whereas the second factor, "Quantitative," consisted of Habitual Sleep Efficiency and Sleep Duration. This factor showed a significant relation to inflammatory markers. Multivariate modeling suggested that qualitative sleep disturbance was predicted by disease activity, pain, and anxiety, whereas quantitative sleep disturbance was predicted by disease activity. CONCLUSIONS: These results indicate that sleep disturbance in depressed youth with CD differs depending upon illness activity. Patients may require different interventions depending upon the sleep disturbance exhibited.},

   abstract = {Thiopurines have been used in inflammatory bowel disease (IBD) for >30 years, and measurements of both thiopurine methyltransferase (TPMT) and thiopurine (TP) metabolites, 6-thioguanine nucleotides (6-TGN) and 6-methylmercaptopurine (6-MMP), have been readily available. The North American Society for Pediatric Gastroenterology, Hepatology, and Nutrition (NASPGHAN) Committee on Inflammatory Bowel Disease thought it appropriate to review the present indications for use of TPMT and TP metabolite testing. Substantial evidence demonstrates that TP therapy is useful for both Crohn disease and ulcerative colitis. Review of the existing data yielded the following recommendations. TPMT testing is recommended before initiation of TPs to identify individuals who are homozygote recessive or have extremely low TPMT activity, with the latter having more reliability than the former. Individuals who are homozygous recessive or have extremely low TPMT activity should avoid the use of TPs because of concerns for significant leukopenia. TMPT testing does not predict all cases of leukopenia and has no value to predict hypersensitivity adverse effects such as pancreatitis. Any potential value to reduce the risk of malignancy has not been studied. All individuals taking TPs should have routine monitoring with complete blood cell count and white blood cell count differential to evaluate for leukopenia regardless of TPMT testing results. Metabolite testing can be used to determine adherence with TP therapy. Metabolite testing can be used to guide dose increases or modifications in patients with active disease. Consideration would include either increasing the dose, changing therapy or for those with elevated transaminases or an elevated 6-MMP, using adjunctive allopurinol to help raise 6-thioguanine metabolites and suppress formation of 6-MMP. Routine and repetitive metabolite testing has little or no role in patients who are doing well and taking an acceptable dose of a TP.},

RECENT FINDINGS: This review first identifies diseases with which eating disorders are often confused and then explores features in the history, physical examination, and laboratory studies, which can provide clues to the cause of the patient's symptoms. In addition, it discusses the recommended evaluation and treatments for the gastrointestinal diseases that most commonly mimic the presentation of eating disorders including Crohn disease (CrD), celiac disease, gastroesophageal reflux disease (GERD), and eosinophilic esophagitis (EoE). SUMMARY: The ubiquitous nature of the gastrointestinal complaints requires the clinician to consider a broad differential diagnosis when evaluating a patient for an eating disorder.},

   abstract = {The dysbiosis theory of inflammatory bowel disease (IBD) posits that there is an alteration in the gut microbiome as an important underpinning of disease etiology. It stands to reason then, that administering agents that could impact on the balance of microbes on the gut could be impactful on the course of IBD. Herein is a review of the controlled trials undertaken to assess the use of antibiotics that would kill or suppress potentially injurious microbes, probiotics that would overpopulate the gut with potentially beneficial microbes or prebiotics that provide a metabolic substrate that enhances the growth of potentially beneficial microbes. With regard to antibiotics, the best data are for the use of nitroimadoles postoperatively in Crohn's disease (CD) to prevent disease recurrence. Otherwise, the data are limited with the regard to any lasting benefit of antibiotics sustaining remission in either CD or ulcerative colitis (UC). A recent meta-analysis concluded that antibiotics are superior to placebo at inducing remission in CD or UC, although the meta-analysis grouped a variety of antibiotics with different spectra of activity. Despite the absence of robust clinical trial data, antibiotics are widely used to treat perineal fistulizing CD and acute and chronic pouchitis. Probiotics have not been shown to have a beneficial role in CD. However, Escherichia coli Nissle 1917 has comparable effects to low doses of mesalamine in maintaining remission in UC. VSL#3, a combination of 8 microbes, has been shown to have an effect in inducing remission in UC and preventing pouchitis. Prebiotics have yet to be shown to have an effect in any form of IBD, but to date controlled trials have been small. The use of antibiotics should be balanced against the risks they pose. Even probiotics may pose some risk and should not be assumed to be innocuous especially when ingested by persons with a compromised epithelial barrier. Prebiotics may not be harmful but may cause gastrointestinal side effects. Finally, the timing of ingestion of antibiotics and other dietary factors that may function as prebiotics, especially in early childhood, may be critical in shaping the gut microbiome and ultimately predisposing to or preventing IBD. Finding ways to impact on the gut microbiome to alter the course of IBD makes good sense, but should be undertaken in the setting of rigorously performed controlled trials to ensure that the interventions are truly effective and well tolerated.},

   abstract = {There is extensive evidence for influence of gut microbiota on health. Exclusive enteral nutrition (EEN) possibly changes gut microbiota, but the exact pathophysiological role is unknown. EEN has been shown to have an anti-inflammatory effect in children with Mb Crohn, an inflammatory bowel disease. The intestinal tract is very scarcely studied in children with juvenile idiopathic arthritis (JIA), but data points to an immunologically important role. The aim of this study was to explore if EEN had any anti-inflammatory effect in children with JIA. The first patient enrolled in the study was followed for 1 year. She had onset of severe polyarticular disease at 3.2 years of age, negative in RF, anti-CCP, ANA, and HLA-B27. She was included in the study at 7.4 years of age. Exclusive enteral nutrition was given in two periods of almost 7 weeks each, several months apart, during the year of the study. Clinical and laboratory status were assessed before, during, and after treatment periods. In this patient, EEN had remarkable anti-inflammatory effect that was sustained for months after each of two separate treatment periods. Exclusive enteral nutrition is a possible anti-inflammatory treatment in patients with JIA, but to what extent EEN is effective in other children with JIA needs to be explored, as well as the possible pathophysiological role of EEN in those children.},

   abstract = {AIM: Familial Mediterranean fever (FMF) and inflammatory bowel disease (IBD) carry similar clinical and biological properties. Both are characterized with chronic inflammation attacks and neutrophil migration and impaired apoptosis mechanism are present in the areas of damage in both conditions. In our study, we aimed to determine the frequency of association of FMF in patients with IBD, to compare the demographic, clinical, laboratory and treatment response properties in these patients with the ones in other IBD patients and to determine association of FMF especially in treatment-resistant patients. MATERIAL AND METHODS: Fifty-three patients who were being followed up with a diagnosis of IBD aged between 0 and 18 years were included in the study. The patient group included the patients who were diagnosed with IBD according to clinical, serological, endoscopic and histopathological criteria, who were being followed up and whose therapies were continuing. Genetic analysis in terms of MEFV gene mutations was performed in all patients with a diagnosis of IBD. Acute phase reactants, complete blood count, immunoglobulin levels, stool analysis, "perinuclear anti-neutrophil cytoplasmic antibodies" (pANCA) and "anti-Saccharomyces cerevisiae antibodies" (ASCA) were studied at the time of diagnosis. The diagnosis of FMF was made according to detailed history, physical examination findings, laboratory tests and the results of genetic analyses in terms of MEFV gene mutations in accordance with the criteria defined in 2009. RESULTS: We found that FMF accompanied in 14 (26.4%) of the patients who had a diagnosis of IBD. 3 of these 14 patients in whom FMF accompanied were being followed up with a diagnosis of Crohn disease and 11 were being followed up with a diagnosis of ulcerative colitis. All of these patients had MEFV gene mutation. These mutations included M694V (50%), K695R (21.4%), M680I (14.3%) and R202Q (14.3%) in order of frequency. When the laboratory data were compared between the patients who had a diagnosis of IBD alone and who had a diagnosis of IBD plus FMF, it was observed that the erythrocyte sedimentation rate (ESR) and C-reactive protein (CRP) values were statistically significantly higher in the IBD+FMF group. CONCLUSIONS: FMF is a common condition in the Turkish population and M694V mutation is found most commonly. In our study, this status did not change in cases where FMF accompanied IBD, but K695R mutation was found more frequently compared to FMF alone. We think that it should be kept in mind that other inflammatory conditions including mainly FMF may accompany IBD, if a case of IBD does not have an expected course or is resistant to treatment.},

   abstract = {BACKGROUND: There has been a dramatic increase in investigations on the potential mechanistic role of the intestinal microbiota in various diseases and factors modulating intestinal microbial composition. We recently reported on intestinal microbial shifts after smoking cessation in humans. In this study, we aimed to conduct further microbial analyses and verify our previous results obtained by pyrosequencing using a direct quantitative microbial approach. METHODS: Stool samples of healthy smoking human subjects undergoing controlled smoking cessation during a 9-week observational period were analyzed and compared with 2 control groups, ongoing smoking and nonsmoking subjects. Fluorescence in situ hybridization was applied to quantify specific bacterial groups. RESULTS: Intestinal microbiota composition was substantially altered after smoking cessation as characterized by an increase in key representatives from the phyla of Firmicutes (Clostridium coccoides, Eubacterium rectale, and Clostridium leptum subgroup) and Actinobacteria (HGC bacteria and Bifidobacteria) as well as a decrease in Bacteroidetes (Prevotella spp. and Bacteroides spp.) and Proteobacteria (beta- and gamma-subgroup of Proteobacteria). CONCLUSIONS: As determined by fluorescence in situ hybridization, an independent direct quantitative microbial approach, we could confirm that intestinal microbiota composition in humans is influenced by smoking. The characteristics of observed microbial shifts suggest a potential mechanistic association to alterations in body weight subsequent to smoking cessation. More importantly, regarding previously described microbial hallmarks of dysbiosis in inflammatory bowel diseases, a variety of observed microbial alterations after smoking cessation deserve further consideration in view of the divergent effect of smoking on the clinical course of Crohn's disease and ulcerative colitis.},

   abstract = {Crohn's disease and ulcerative colitis are both chronic inflammatory bowel diseases (IBDs) characterized by a cyclical nature, which alternates between active and quiescent states, ultimately impairing a patients' quality of life. The etiology of IBD is not known but it likely involves a combination of genetic predisposition and environmental risk factors. Physical exercise has been suggested to provide protection against the onset of IBD, but there are inconsistencies in the findings of the published literature. Current research recommends exercise to help counteract some IBD-specific complications and preliminary studies suggest that physical activity may be beneficial in reducing the symptoms of IBD. Obesity is becoming more prevalent in patients diagnosed with IBD and may be associated with higher disease activity. There is evidence that adipokines are involved in the inflammatory and metabolic pathways. Hypertrophy of the mesenteric white adipose tissue has been long recognized as a characteristic feature of Crohn's disease; however its importance is unknown. Recent data suggest that dysregulation of adipokine secretion by white adipose tissue is involved in the pathogenesis of Crohn's disease. Skeletal muscle was shown to produce biologically active myokines, which could be a important contributor to the beneficial effects of exercise. There is mounting evidence for the bi-directional endocrine cross talk between adipose tissue and skeletal muscle. The objective of the present review is to explore the role of exercise and its impact on IBD. Also, we discuss how current discoveries regarding the importance of adipokines and myokines and their cross talk expand our view of the pathological changes and the therapeutic options for IBD.},

   abstract = {Inflammatory bowel disease (IBD) is one of the five most prevalent gastrointestinal disease burdens in the US, with an overall health care cost of more than USD 1.7 billion. It commonly requires a lifetime of care, and accounts for more than 700,000 physician visits, 100,000 hospitalizations, and disability in 119,000 patients each year. IBD is a multifactorial disease and comprises genetic susceptibility, uncontrolled immune responses, and environmental factors which play a role in the pathogenesis and course of the disease. IBD patients are lifelong on medication, either for induction or maintenance therapy. Current treatment option (corticosteroids, immune suppressants, biologics), administered in mono- or combination therapy, are still unsatisfactory. Due to the nature of disease, 20-40% of patients relapse within the first 12 months. Although modern treatment algorithms have diminished the risk of surgery, the treatments harbor significant side effects, which impacts patients' quality of life. The role of nutrition in IBD has gathered high interest, especially in pediatric Crohn's disease, where studies have shown that exclusive enteral nutrition can induce remission in mild-to-moderate disease comparable to corticosteroids. Thus, gastroenterologists and patients become increasingly aware that specific nutritional interventions offered in addition to the standard of care are an appealing option for a safe long-term disease management. Such specific nutritional solutions should be based on scientific/clinical evidence and specifically designed to address the patients' distinct nutritional requirements. As per definition, these nutrition products fall under the regulatory framework of a Medical Food (Foods for Special Medical Purposes in Europe).},

   abstract = {BACKGROUND AND AIM: Monitoring of mucosal inflammation in inflammatory bowel disease (IBD) is of major importance. New noninvasive markers for intestinal inflammation are needed. Previous studies have reported that pancreatitis-associated protein (PAP) correlates with clinical activity in IBD subgroups. Our aim was to investigate the correlation of serum and fecal PAP with clinical and biochemical parameters of disease activity in a real-life IBD cohort. PATIENTS AND METHODS: Two hundred and five consecutive IBD patients were enrolled. Clinical disease activity was scored by the Harvey-Bradshaw Index or the Simple Clinical Colitis Activity Index; also, C-reactive protein (CRP), erythrocyte sedimentation rate, and fecal calprotectin were determined. As surrogate for endoscopy, a combination score of clinical indices with CRP or calprotectin was used to define active disease. Fecal and serum PAP were measured by ELISA. RESULTS: The median serum and fecal PAP did not differ in Crohn's disease (CD) or ulcerative colitis (UC) patients with active compared with inactive disease according to clinical activity indices. Defining active disease by a combination score of Harvey-Bradshaw Index of more than 4 and CRP of more than 5 mg/l or calprotectin more than 250 microg/g, serum PAP (P=0.01), but not fecal PAP (P=0.32), was significantly higher in active than inactive CD patients. Area under the curve of the corresponding receiver operating curve (ROC) was 0.64. No differences were found in serum or fecal PAP levels using the combination score for active disease in UC. CONCLUSION: Serum but not fecal PAP was higher in active compared with nonactive CD and may reflect mucosal inflammation in CD, but not in UC. However, the accuracy of serum PAP for the diagnosis of active disease was poor, and therefore, serum PAP does not seem to have additional value compared with the current noninvasive markers.},

   abstract = {INTRODUCTION: Remarkable differences in quality of care (QoC) might be observed in different countries, affecting quality of life of inflammatory bowel disease (IBD) patients. The aim of this study was to assess patient and physician perceptions of the QoC in Italy. METHODS: A multicentre observational study on the quality of care in IBD (SOLUTION-1) was conducted in 36 IG-IBD (Italian Group for Inflammatory Bowel Disease) centres in Italy. The QUOTE-IBD (Quality of Care Through the Patient's Eyes) questionnaire was administered to IBD patients and to the attending physicians. The Quality Impact (QI) score summarises the QUOTE-IBD questionnaire, and a QI >9 is considered satisfactory. RESULTS: Nine-hundred-ninety-two patients and 75 physicians completed the QUOTE-IBD questionnaire. The patients scored the domains of competence (9.47 vs. 8.55) and costs (9.54 vs. 8.26) higher that the physicians, while information (9.31 vs. 9.43) and continuity of care (8.40 vs. 9.01) were scored lower. The QI score was rated worse by physicians with less experience (<12 years) with regard to competence (8.0 vs. 9.01), courtesy (8.12 vs. 10.0) and autonomy (8.97 vs. 10.0). Physicians considered the cost domain unsatisfactory. CONCLUSIONS: Healthcare was rated as satisfactory overall for Italian patients and physicians. The physicians underestimate their competence and consider the cost of medical management unsatisfactory. The patients are more critical regarding the continuity of care and information. Country-specific data on QoC allow local governments to allocate resources more effectively.},

   abstract = {The cytosolic pattern recognition receptor NOD2 is activated by the peptidoglycan fragment muramyl dipeptide to generate a proinflammatory immune response. Downstream effects include the secretion of cytokines such as interleukin 8, the upregulation of pro-interleukin 1beta, the induction of autophagy, the production of antimicrobial peptides and defensins, and contributions to the maintenance of the composition of the intestinal microbiota. Polymorphisms in NOD2 are the cause of the inflammatory disorder Blau syndrome and act as susceptibility factors for the inflammatory bowel condition Crohn's disease. The complexity of NOD2 signalling is highlighted by the observation that over 30 cellular proteins interact with NOD2 directly and influence or regulate its functional activity. Previously, the majority of reviews on NOD2 function have focused upon the role of NOD2 in inflammatory disease or in its interaction with and response to microbes. However, the functionality of NOD2 is underpinned by its biochemical interactions. Consequently, in this review, we have taken the opportunity to address the more 'basic' elements of NOD2 signalling. In particular, we have focused upon the core interactions of NOD2 with protein factors that influence and modulate the signal transduction pathways involved in NOD2 signalling. Further, where information exists, such as in relation to the role of RIP2, we have drawn comparison with the closely related, but functionally discrete, pattern recognition receptor NOD1. Overall, we provide a comprehensive resource targeted at understanding the complexities of NOD2 signalling.},

   abstract = {INTRODUCTION: Calcium deficiency is considered a risk factor for the development of osteoporosis in inflammatory bowel disease (IBD) patients. Various dietary restrictions, including milk products are reported by these patients. OBJECTIVE: To evaluate dairy product and dietary calcium intake by IBD patients. METHODS: This cross-sectional study enrolled 65 outpatients with IBD recruited from one reference center for IBD. A semi-structured questionnaire (to collect demographic, socioeconomic and clinical data) and a quantitative food frequency questionnaire were administered. With regard to clinical data, we evaluated the anthropometric nutritional status, the disease classification, the disease activity index and the presence of gastrointestinal symptoms. Self-reported modifications in the use of dairy products were evaluated. RESULTS: The IBD patients' ages ranged from 20-75 years and 67.0% were diagnosed with ulcerative colitis. The majority (64.7%) reported restricting dairy products. The frequency of gastrointestinal symptoms was higher among the Crohn's disease patients who restricted dairy products than among those with no restrictions (100% vs 42.9%; p = 0.013); this result was not observed among the UC (ulcerative colitis) patients. Disease activity was also more frequent in the IBD patients who restricted dairy products than in those with no restrictions (23.8% vs 4.5%; p = 0.031), and among the UC patients, extensive disease was more common in the patients who restricted dairy products than in those with no restrictions (42.9% vs 20.0%; p = 0.03). CONCLUSION: Restricting dairy products is common among IBD patients, possibly due to disease activity, the presence of gastrointestinal symptoms and the extension of the disease.},

   abstract = {BACKGROUND: The presence of submucosal or myenteric plexitis was associated with clinical and endoscopic Crohn's disease (CD) recurrence after ileocolonic resection. We assessed the value of both submucosal and myenteric plexitis for predicting postoperative surgical recurrence in CD. METHODS: We performed a retrospective study using the database of the Department of Pathology of Nancy University Hospital. All patients who underwent CD-related resection between 1996 and 2008 were analyzed. The proximal resection margin was analyzed blindly by 2 expert pathologists. Plexitis was evaluated by counting each cell type (mast cell, plasmocyte, lymphocyte, eosinophil, and neutrophil) in both submucosal and myenteric plexuses. The optimal cut-off value for each cell type was determined by using receiver operating characteristic analysis. Cox proportional hazards regression analysis was used to identify independent predictors of the second CD-related surgery. RESULTS: Sixty-seven patients were included in the study. Median duration of follow-up was 46 months. Using Kaplan-Meier survival analysis, the proportion of patients without second surgery was 68% at 5 years. In multivariate analysis, using Cox proportional hazards regression analysis, early surgical revision after the first ileocecal resection (hazard ratio = 9.56; 95% confidence interval, 2.02-45.19; P = 0.0046), the presence of at least one eosinophil in the submucosal plexus (hazard ratio = 8.02; 95% confidence interval, 1.87-34.47; P = 0.0054), and the presence of more than 6 lymphocytes in the submucosal plexus (hazard ratio = 5.84; 95% confidence interval, 1.23-27.65; P = 0.0269) were independently associated with risk of surgical recurrence. CONCLUSIONS: Early surgical revision and submucosal plexitis in proximal margins of ileocolonic resection specimens are independently associated with CD surgical recurrence.},

   abstract = {Dietary methyl donors and their genetic determinants are associated with Crohn's disease risk. We investigated whether a methyl-deficient diet (MDD) may affect development and functions of the small intestine in rat pups from dams subjected to the MDD during gestation and lactation. At 1 month before pregnancy, adult females were fed with either a standard food or a diet without vitamin B12, folate and choline. A global wall hypotrophy was observed in the distal small bowel (MDD animals 0.30 mm v. controls 0.58 mm; P< 0.001) with increased crypt apoptosis (3.37 v. 0.4%; P< 0.001), loss of enterocyte differentiation in the villus and a reduction in intestinal alkaline phosphatase production. Cleaved caspase-3 immunostaining (MDD animals 3.37% v. controls 0.4%, P< 0.001) and the Apostain labelling index showed increased crypt apoptosis (3.5 v. 1.4%; P= 0.018). Decreased proliferation was observed in crypts of the proximal small bowel with a reduced number of minichromosome maintenance 6 (MDD animals 52.83% v. controls 83.17%; P= 0.048) and proliferating cell nuclear antigen-positive cells (46.25 v. 59 %; P= 0.05). This lack of enterocyte differentiation in the distal small bowel was associated with an impaired expression of beta-catenin and a decreased beta-catenin-E-cadherin interaction. The MDD affected the intestinal barrier in the proximal small bowel by decreasing Paneth cell number after immunostaining for lysosyme (MDD animals 8.66% v. controls 21.66%) and by reducing goblet cell number and mucus production after immunostaining for mucin-2 (crypts 8.66 v. 15.33%; villus 7 v. 17%). The MDD has dual effects on the small intestine by producing dramatic effects on enterocyte differentiation and barrier function in rats.},

   abstract = {Inflammatory bowel diseases (IBDs), namely Crohn's disease and ulcerative colitis, are lifelong chronic disorders arising from interactions among genetic, immunological and environmental factors. Although the origin of IBDs is closely linked to immune response alterations, which governs most medical decision-making, recent findings suggest that gut microbiota may be involved in IBD pathogenesis. Epidemiologic evidence and several studies have shown that a dysregulation of gut microbiota (i.e., dysbiosis) may trigger the onset of intestinal disorders such as IBDs. Animal and human investigations focusing on the microbiota-IBD relationship have suggested an altered balance of the intestinal microbial population in the active phase of IBD. Rigorous microbiota typing could, therefore, soon become part of a complete phenotypic analysis of IBD patients. Moreover, individual susceptibility and environmental triggers such as nutrition, medications, age or smoking could modify bacterial strains in the bowel habitat. Pharmacological manipulation of bowel microbiota is somewhat controversial. The employment of antibiotics, probiotics, prebiotics and synbiotics has been widely addressed in the literature worldwide, with the aim of obtaining positive results in a number of IBD patient settings, and determining the appropriate timing and modality of this intervention. Recently, novel treatments for IBDs, such as fecal microbiota transplantation, when accepted by patients, have shown promising results. Controlled studies are being designed. In the near future, new therapeutic strategies can be expected, with non-pathogenic or modified food organisms that can be genetically modified to exert anti-inflammatory properties.},

   abstract = {Surgery for inflammatory bowel disease under immunosuppressant drugs is a widely discussed topic. Because therapeutic concepts have significantly changed, almost no patient is currently without an immunosuppressant or biologic agent prior to surgery. However, the data whether biological agents and immunosuppressant are a risk factor are very inconsistent. Concerning Crohn's disease, monotherapy with immunosuppressants or biological agents seems to have no negative influence on the postoperative results. In contrast, however, for ulcerative colitis more publications recognise biologic agents and immunosuppressants as a single therapy as a risk factor for infections. To reduce the general risk, all risk factors have to be reduced. In Crohn's disease, nutritional status must be optimised, corticoids should be reduced, biological agents and immunosuppressant drugs should be stopped, protection of an eventual anastomosis by a stoma. For ulcerative colitis in high-risk patients, a three-stage restaurative proctocolectomy is favoured to a one- or two-staged proctocolectomy.},

   abstract = {Recently, genetic associations have been described in intestinal transplants. Namely, Crohn's disease susceptibility gene NOD2 polymorphisms have been reported to be more prevalent in patients with graft failure following intestinal transplantation (IT). Therefore, we sought to determine if polymorphisms in the NOD2 signaling cascade, including NOD2, CARD9, RAC1 and ATG16L1 are associated with intestinal failure (IF) or its complications. We carried out a cross-sectional study of 59 children with IF and 500 healthy Caucasian controls. Using the Taqman platform we determined the prevalence of NOD2 as well as ATG16L1, RAC1 and CARD9 SNPs. NOD2 pathway polymorphisms were evaluated in relation to outcomes of episodes of sepsis, ICU admissions, hyperbilirubinemia and need for IT. We found that the minor allele of a CARD9 SNP was associated with protection from developing IF when compared to healthy controls and was also associated with decreased odds of sustained conjugated hyperbilirubinemia. Therefore, IF patients with CARD9 polymorphism are less likely to develop progressive liver disease and suggests that host innate immunity may play a role in IF associated liver disease.},

   abstract = {BACKGROUND: Exclusive enteral nutrition (EEN) is an effective first line treatment for active paediatric Crohn's disease (CD). AIM: To examine the effect of EEN on short- and long-term clinical outcome together with anthropometric measurements. METHODS: Retrospective case-note review in newly diagnosed CD (<16 years) who completed 8 weeks of EEN. Demographics, anthropometry, disease characteristics and inflammatory markers were collected at EEN initiation and at 1, 2, 6, 12 & 24 months post treatment initiation. EEN response was determined by a patient global assessment. RESULTS: One hundred and nine patients were included (Males 68; Median age: 11.2 years). After 8 weeks EEN, 65 were in remission, 32 improved and 12 had no improvement. By 4 weeks, mean weight/BMI z-score (s.d.) increased (P < 0.02) and between 4 and 8 weeks (P < 0.05). Baseline inflammatory markers all improved significantly by week 4 (albumin, CRP and platelets; all P < 0.01) and ESR (P < 0.00001). 63/109(58%) relapsed during follow-up. 44/63(70%) patients completed a second course of EEN with similar response rate, but lower weight gain (3.3 vs. 5.1 kg, P < 0.05). Height z-score did not change significantly over the 24 months. Introduction of azathioprine within 6 months of diagnosis did not improve height outcomes at 24 months. CONCLUSIONS: Weight and BMI z-score improved with EEN and changes are sustained to 2 years, but height z-score did not. Seventy per cent of patients who relapsed during 2-year follow-up managed a 2nd course of EEN. The optimal therapeutic strategies for length of EEN course and to improve linear growth are awaited.},

   abstract = {BACKGROUND: Orofacial granulomatosis (OFG) is a chronic granulomatous condition of the mouth, face and lips. Recent work demonstrates a high rate of atopy and silver birch sensitisation from skin prick testing (SPT). Oral allergy syndrome (OAS) is an acute oro-pharyngeal IgE mediated reaction, triggered by foods that cross react with pollens, most commonly silver birch. The aim of this study was to determine if patients with OFG and positive SPT to common OAS associated pollens responded to avoidance of cross reactive foods. METHODS: Patients with OFG and positive SPT to silver birch, grass, mugwort, ragweed and latex were required to avoid cross reacting foods, for 6 weeks and, in those who responded, for a total of 12 weeks. All had standardized oral examinations and were given severity scores (SS) at each appointment. RESULTS: Twenty two of 47 (47%) patients had one or more positive SPT and 13/22 completed 6 weeks on the diet. No difference was seen in SS between weeks 0 (14.62 +/- 11.16) and 6 (13.31 +/- 10.33; P = 0.656). Six of 14 (43%) had significantly improved SS (week 0; 19.17 +/- 12.95, week 6; 10.83 +/- 4.99, P = 0.027). Five completed 12 weeks and no further improvement was seen (week 6; 11 +/- 5.57, week 12; 10.4 +/- 9.94; P = 0.068). Two patients required no further treatments. CONCLUSIONS: On an intention to treat basis, only 2/14 patients improved and required no further intervention. Whilst this diet cannot be recommended routinely, the improvement seen in some patients raises questions about the role of OAS in patients with OFG.},

   abstract = {BACKGROUND: Orofacial granulomatosis (OFG) is a rare disease of unknown cause. A cinnamon- and benzoate-free diet is successful in up to 72% of patients. Phenolic acids are among the chemical constituents restricted in this diet, which avoids some but not all of these structurally similar compounds. The present study aimed to: (i) develop a novel diet low in phenolic acids; (ii) implement this in a small clinical trial; and (iii) assess its nutritional adequacy. METHODS: A literature review identified 10 papers quantifying phenolic acids from which 91 10-mg phenolic acid exchanges were devised. A phenolic acid exclusion diet with precautionary micronutrient supplementation was designed and implemented in 10 patients. Phenolic acids were excluded for 6 weeks and were reintroduced at a rate of one exchange every second day for 6 weeks. Wilcoxon matched pairs tests analysed disease outcomes measured by an oral disease severity scoring tool at weeks 0, 6 and 12. Nutritional adequacy was assessed, excluding micronutrient supplementation, at weeks 0 and 6, and compared intakes with dietary reference values. RESULTS: The diet was nutritionally inadequate for a range of micronutrients. Seven of 10 patients responded. Mean [standard deviation (SD)] severity scores improved from week 0-6 [20.8 (9.39) and 10.1 (5.72); P = 0.009] and were maintained in five patients who completed the reintroduction [6.6 (3.13) and 7.2 (5.54); P = 0.713]. CONCLUSIONS: A low phenolic acid diet with micronutrient supplementation holds promise of a novel dietary treatment for OFG. Further work is required in larger studies to determine long-term outcomes.},

   abstract = {New Zealand has one of the highest rates of Crohn's Disease (CD) in the world, and there is much speculation as to why this might be. A high risk of CD has been associated with deficient or insufficient levels of Vitamin D (Vit D), lifestyle as well as various genetic polymorphisms. In this study we sought to analyse the relevance of serum Vit D levels, lifestyle and genotype to CD status. Serum samples were analysed for 25-OH-Vitamin D levels. DNA was isolated from blood and cheek-swabs, and Sequenom and ImmunoChip techniques were used for genotyping. Serum Vit D levels were significantly lower in CD patients (mean = 49.5 mg/L) than those found in controls (mean = 58.9 mg/L, p = 4.74 x 10(-)(6)). A total of seven single nucleotide polymorphisms were examined for effects on serum Vit D levels, with adjustment for confounding variables. Two variants: rs731236[A] (VDR) and rs732594[A] (SCUBE3) showed a significant association with serum Vit D levels in CD patients. Four variants: rs7975232[A] (VDR), rs732594[A] (SCUBE3), and rs2980[T] and rs2981[A] (PHF-11) showed a significant association with serum Vit D levels in the control group. This study demonstrates a significant interaction between Vit D levels and CD susceptibility, as well as a significant association between Vit D levels and genotype.},

   abstract = {OBJECTIVES: Adolescence is a tough age for patients with inflammatory bowel disease (IBD) because they transition from child to adult medicine. Although a better understanding of the experience of illness and therefore a better response to the patient's needs have often been stressed, no studies have yet investigated the paediatricians' insight into their IBD adolescent patients. METHODS: A group of adolescents (ages 12-19) diagnosed as having IBD was administered a questionnaire listing 22 items of concern. They were asked to rank each item on a 5-point scale according to the degree of effect on the quality of their everyday life. The same questionnaire was administered to a group of paediatricians experienced in treating IBD and to a group of paediatric residents. Paediatricians and residents were asked to estimate how much each item would affect the quality of an average patient's life, according to the same scale. The questionnaire was also used in a face-to-face approach, asking a paediatrician to apply the estimation to an individual patient, instead of an average imaginary one. RESULTS: Fifteen paediatric gastroenterologists, 11 paediatric residents, and 28 patients (female:male = 16:12; median age 16.3 years) took part in the study. The majority of patients experienced Crohn disease (17 vs 11 with ulcerative colitis). We found only 6 items overlapping when comparing the top 10 items ranked by patients and paediatricians. The patients' number 1 concern occupies the ninth position in the paediatricians' list. The number 1 item for paediatricians is not even mentioned in the patients' top 10 list. Overall, both paediatricians' and residents' rankings were significantly higher than those given by patients. CONCLUSIONS: We found a significant misalignment in the estimation of health concerns between IBD adolescent patients and their paediatricians. A better insight into IBD patients' worries and concerns is crucial for the improvement of the patient's quality of life and disease outcome.},

   abstract = {OBJECTIVES: Obesity is associated with a proinflammatory state that may be involved in the etiology of inflammatory bowel disease (IBD), for which there are plausible biological mechanisms. Our aim was to perform the first prospective cohort study investigating if there is an association between obesity and the development of incident IBD. METHODS: A total of 300,724 participants were recruited into the European Prospective Investigation into Cancer and Nutrition study. At recruitment, anthropometric measurements of height and weight plus physical activity and total energy intake from validated questionnaires were recorded. The cohort was monitored identifying participants who developed either Crohn's disease (CD) or ulcerative colitis (UC). Each case was matched with four controls and conditional logistic regression used to calculate odds ratios (ORs) for body mass index (BMI) adjusted for smoking, energy intake, and physical activity. RESULTS: In the cohort, 177 participants developed incident UC and 75 participants developed incident CD. There were no associations with the four higher categories of BMI compared with a normal BMI for UC (Ptrend=0.36) or CD (Ptrend=0.83). The lack of associations was consistent when BMI was analyzed as a continuous or binary variable (BMI 18.5<25.0 vs. >/=25 kg/m(2)). Physical activity and total energy intake, factors that influence BMI, did not show any association with UC (physical activity, Ptrend=0.79; total energy intake, Ptrend=0.18) or CD (physical activity, Ptrend=0.42; total energy, Ptrend=0.11). CONCLUSIONS: Obesity as measured by BMI is not associated with the development of incident UC or CD. Alternative measures of obesity are required to further investigate the role of obesity in the development of incident IBD.},

   abstract = {BACKGROUND: Diet may have a role in the etiology of inflammatory bowel disease. In previous studies, the associations between increased intakes of carbohydrates, sugar, starch, and inflammatory bowel disease are inconsistent. However, few prospective studies have investigated the associations between these macronutrients and incident Crohn's disease (CD) or ulcerative colitis (UC). METHODS: A total of 401,326 men and women were recruited between 1991 and 1998. At recruitment, dietary intakes of carbohydrate, sugar, and starch were measured using validated food frequency questionnaires. The cohort was monitored identifying participants who developed incident CD or UC. Cases were matched with 4 controls, and odds ratios were calculated for quintiles of total carbohydrate, sugar, and starch intakes adjusted for total energy intake, body mass index, and smoking. RESULTS: One hundred ten participants developed CD, and 244 participants developed UC during follow-up. The adjusted odds ratio for the highest versus the lowest quintiles of total carbohydrate intake for CD was 0.87, 95% CI = 0.24 to 3.12 and for UC 1.46, 95% CI = 0.62 to 3.46, with no significant trends across quintiles for either (CD, P trend = 0.70; UC, P trend = 0.41). Similarly, no associations were observed with intakes of total sugar (CD, P trend = 0.50; UC, P trend = 0.71) or starch (CD, P trend = 0.69; UC, P trend = 0.17). CONCLUSIONS: The lack of associations with these nutrients is in agreement with many case-control studies that have not identified associations with CD or UC. As there is biological plausibility for how specific carbohydrates could have an etiological role in inflammatory bowel disease, future epidemiological work should assess individual carbohydrates, although there does not seem to be a macronutrient effect.},

Extracorporeal photopheresis (ECP) has been used in steroid dependent adults with moderate to severely active Crohn's disease, with response rates up to 50%, with up to 25% complete responses. A 12-year-old male patient had severe unremitting Crohn's disease for one year, despite treatment with anti-inflammatory, immunosuppressive, and biologic agents. He failed elemental enteral nutrition and required total parenteral nutrition (TPN). A diverting colostomy for perforation was required. He required frequent hospitalizations and required homebound schooling. Endoscopy revealed severe inflammation and ulcerations of the entire colon. ECP was begun twice weekly for 4 weeks, then twice per week every 14 days for a total of 28 weeks. ECP was well tolerated and prednisone was gradually discontinued. He continued daily azathioprine and infliximab at 6 week intervals. TPN was weaned as enteral intake improved. Disease abatement allowed a return to school and normal activities. Endoscopy at completion of ECP course revealed normal upper tract, normal ano-rectum, and decreased, although significant, colonic disease. This response has continued for at least 16 months since completion of ECP. We conclude that ECP is useful for pediatric patients with steroid dependent Crohn's disease and prospective evaluation is warranted.},

   abstract = {BACKGROUND: Natalizumab (NAT) is a humanized monoclonal antibody against a4-integrin initially approved for the treatment of multiple sclerosis, and then withdrawn from the market in 2005 due to the risk of progressive multifocal leukoencephalopathy. NAT was approved for the treatment of Crohn's disease in the United States in 2008 under a restricted distribution program. There has been limited data on NAT since then. The purpose of this study was to review the experience with NAT in Crohn's disease patients at a tertiary inflammatory bowel disease center. METHODS: A retrospective chart review was performed on all patients who received NAT for treatment of refractory Crohn's disease from January 2008 to August 2010 at Washington University Medical Center in St. Louis. RESULTS: A total of 20 patients were identified and included in our study. Four patients did not complete induction therapy. Seven patients had a clinical response, with 5 patients continuing treatment up to 2012. Four patients had a partial response, 3 had adverse events, and 2 experienced loss of response. Two patients were pregnant while on NAT, and neither had significant adverse pregnancy outcomes. One patient dependent on total parenteral nutrition developed recurrent line sepsis while on NAT. Of the 5 patients on long-term maintenance therapy, 4 have a positive anti-JC virus antibody. No patients developed progressive multifocal leukoencephalopathy or other neurological complications. CONCLUSION: NAT remains a valuable alternative treatment option for patients with refractory Crohn's disease under a restricted distribution program.},

   abstract = {PURPOSE: This study was aimed to evaluate the frequency and course of adverse events associated with azathioprine treatment in Korean pediatric patients with inflammatory bowel disease. METHODS: Total of 174 pediatric patients (age range, 1 to 19 years) with inflammatory bowel disease who received azathioprine in order to maintain remission at Samsung Medical Center (Seoul, Korea) from January 2002 through December 2012 were included in this study. Medical records of these subjects were retrospectively reviewed regarding the development of adverse events associated with azathioprine treatment. RESULTS: Ninety-eight patients (56.3%) of 174 patients experienced 136 episodes of adverse events, requiring dose reduction in 31 patients (17.8%), and discontinuation in 18 patients (10.3%). The mean dose of azathioprine that had been initially administered was 1.32+/-0.42 mg/kg/day. Among the adverse reactions, bone marrow suppression developed in 47 patients (27.0%), requiring dose reduction in 22 patients (12.6%) and discontinuation in 8 patients (4.6%). Other adverse events that occurred were gastrointestinal disturbance (15.5%), hair loss (12.1%), pancreatitis (7.5%), arthralgia (6.9%), hepatotoxicity (2.9%), skin rash/allergic reactions (2.9%), headache/dizziness (2.3%), sepsis (0.6%), and oral mucositis (0.6%). CONCLUSION: Bone marrow suppression, especially leukopenia was most commonly associated with azathioprine treatment in Korean pediatric inflammatory bowel disease patients. Close observation for possible adverse events is required in this population with inflammatory bowel diseases who are under treatment with azathioprine.},

   abstract = {BACKGROUND: Infliximab induces and maintains clinical remission in children with Crohn's disease (CD), but specifically pediatric long-term data remain sparse. METHODS: Patients (N = 195) who received infliximab +/- immunomodulator for luminal CD were retrospectively reviewed. Outcomes included clinical response, linear growth, and mucosal healing. Durability of response was assessed using Cox proportional hazards models. Levels of infliximab and antibodies (antibodies to infliximab) were measured when response was lost. RESULTS: Among 195 patients (median age, 13.9 yr; median CD duration, 1.6 yr), 81% experienced complete response (judged by physician global assessment and pediatric Crohn's disease activity index </=10). Longer duration of diagnosed CD and female gender were associated with lower response. During first year of follow-up, 35% of subjects had regimen individualized through dose escalation/interval shortening. Despite regimen optimization, 16/157 complete responders experienced loss of response at a rate of 2% to 6% per year over 5 years, associated with development of antibodies to infliximab. Concurrent immunomodulation for >/=30 weeks significantly decreased loss of response (hazard ratio = 0.25, 95% confidence interval, 0.08-0.76; P = 0.014). Follow-up endoscopic examination was performed in 40 responders, of whom 22 (73%) demonstrated complete resolution of mucosal ulceration. Patients with growth potential (Tanner 1/2 at induction) demonstrated significant improvements in mean height z-score from induction to years 1 and 2 of follow-up (P < 0.001). With infliximab initiation within the first 18 months after diagnosis, mean height z-score normalized to 0 after 3 years. CONCLUSIONS: These data demonstrate sustained effectiveness of infliximab in children and adolescents with luminal CD. Durability of response is increased by concomitant immunomodulation. Clinical response is associated with enhanced linear growth, particularly when therapy is initiated early.},

   abstract = {BACKGROUND: In the treatment of Crohn's disease (CD), mucosal healing has become a major goal, with the hope of avoiding intestinal damage from chronic inflammation. Magnetic resonance enterography (MRE) has emerged as a non-invasive means of monitoring inflammation and damage. AIMS: As part of the development of MRE-based multi-item measures of inflammation and damage for paediatric studies, we carried out a systematic review and meta-analysis to identify MRE variables used to describe these two distinct concepts. METHODS: 2501 studies of MRI and CD were identified. Studies written in any language reporting individual MRE signs for patients diagnosed with CD were included. Two-hundred-and-forty-four studies were fully reviewed and 62 were included (inflammation, n = 51; damage, n = 24). Sensitivity, specificity and associated confidence intervals were calculated, and hierarchical summary ROC curves were constructed for each MRE sign. RESULTS: A total of 22 MRE signs were used to reflect inflammation, and 9 to reflect damage. Diagnostic accuracy of MRE signs of inflammation and damage was heterogeneous; however, wall enhancement, mucosal lesions and wall T2 hyperintensity were the most consistently useful for inflammation (most sensitivities >80% and specificities >90%), and detection of abscess and fistula were most consistently useful for damage (most sensitivities >90%, specificities >95%). CONCLUSIONS: Identifying the best MRE variables to reflect inflammation and damage will maximise the utility of this rapidly emerging technique and is the first stage of constructing MRE-based indices for evaluating inflammation and intestinal damage.},

   abstract = {Literature reports describe kiwi fruit as a food with significant effects on human health, including anti-oxidant and anti-inflammatory activity. Fresh fruit or raw kiwi fruit extracts have been used so far to investigate these effects, but the molecule(s) responsible for these health-promoting activities have not yet been identified. Kissper is a kiwi fruit peptide displaying pore-forming activity in synthetic lipid bilayers, the composition of which is similar to that found in intestinal cells. The objective of this study was to investigate the kissper influence on intestinal inflammation using cultured cells and ex-vivo tissues from healthy subjects and Crohn's disease (CD) patients. The anti-oxidant and anti-inflammatory properties of kissper were tested on Caco-2 cells and on the colonic mucosa from 23 patients with CD, by challenging with the lipopolysaccharide from Escherichia coli (EC-LPS) and monitoring the appropriate markers by Western blot and immunofluorescence. EC-LPS challenge determined an increase in the intracellular concentration of calcium and reactive oxygen species (ROS). The peptide kissper was highly effective in preventing the increase of LPS-induced ROS levels in both the Caco-2 cells and CD colonic mucosa. Moreover, it controls the calcium increase, p65-nuclear factor (NF)-kB induction and transglutaminase 2 (TG2) activation inflammatory response in Caco-2 cells and CD colonic mucosa. Kissper efficiently counteracts the oxidative stress and inflammatory response in valuable model systems consisting of intestinal cells and CD colonic mucosa. This study reports the first evidence supporting a possible correlation between some beneficial effects of kiwi fruit and a specific protein molecule rather than generic nutrients.},

   abstract = {OBJECTIVE: Under both physiological and pathological conditions, bone volume is determined by the rate of bone formation by osteoblasts and bone resorption by osteoclasts. Excessive bone loss is a common complication of human IBD whose mechanisms are not yet completely understood. Despite the role of activated CD4(+) T cells in inflammatory bone loss, the nature of the T cell subsets involved in this process in vivo remains unknown. The aim of the present study was to identify the CD4(+) T cell subsets involved in the process of osteoclastogenesis in vivo, as well as their mechanism of action. DESIGN: CD4(+) T cells were studied in IL10-/- mice and Rag1-/- mice adoptively transferred with naive CD4(+)CD45RB(high) T cells, representing two well-characterised animal models of IBD and in patients with Crohn's disease. They were phenotypically and functionally characterised by flow cytometric and gene expression analysis, as well as in in vitro cocultures with osteoclast precursors. RESULTS: In mice, we identified bone marrow (BM) CD4(+) T cells producing interleukin (IL)-17 and tumour necrosis factor (TNF)-alpha as an osteoclastogenic T cell subset referred to as Th17 TNF-alpha(+) cells. During chronic inflammation, these cells migrate to the BM where they survive in an IL-7-dependent manner and where they promote the recruitment of inflammatory monocytes, the main osteoclast progenitors. A population equivalent to the Th17 TNF-alpha(+) cells was also detected in patients with Crohn's disease. CONCLUSIONS: Our results highlight the osteoclastogenic function of the Th17 TNF-alpha(+) cells that contribute to bone loss in vivo in IBD.},

   abstract = {OBJECTIVE: The aim of the study was to determine whether infliximab use and other potential predictors are associated with decreased prevalence and severity of depression in pediatric patients with Crohn disease (CD). METHODS: A total of 550 (n = 550) youth ages 9 to 17 years with biopsy-confirmed CD were consecutively recruited as part of a multicenter randomized controlled trial. Out of the 550, 499 patients met study criteria and were included in the analysis. At recruitment, each subject and a parent completed the Children's Depression Inventory (CDI). A child or parent CDI score >/= 12 was used to denote clinically significant depressive symptoms (CSDS). Child and parent CDI scores were summed to form total CDI (CDIT). Infliximab use, demographic information, steroid use, laboratory values, and Pediatric Crohn's Disease Activity Index (PCDAI) were collected as the potential predictors of depression. Univariate regression models were constructed to determine the relations among predictors, CSDS, and CDIT. Stepwise multivariate regression models were constructed to predict the relation between infliximab use and depression while controlling for other predictors of depression. RESULTS: Infliximab use was not associated with a decreased proportion of CSDS and CDIT after adjusting for multiple comparisons. CSDS and CDIT were positively associated with PCDAI, erythrocyte sedimentation rate, and steroid dose (P < 0.01) and negatively associated with socioeconomic status (SES) (P < 0.001). In multivariate models, PCDAI and SES were the strongest predictors of depression. CONCLUSIONS: Disease activity and SES are significant predictors of depression in youth with Crohn disease.},

   abstract = {OBJECTIVE: The aim of the study was to prospectively evaluate clinical and mucosal responses to the specific carbohydrate diet (SCD) in children with Crohn disease (CD). METHODS: Eligible patients with active CD (Pediatric Crohn's Disease Activity Index [PCDAI] >/= 15) underwent a patency capsule and, if passed intact, capsule endoscopy (CE) was performed. Patients taking SCD were monitored for 52 weeks while maintaining all prescribed medications. Demographic, dietary, and clinical information, PCDAI, Harvey-Bradshaw Index (HBI), and Lewis score (LS) were collected at 0, 12, and 52 weeks. CEs were evaluated by an experienced reader blinded to patient clinical information and timing. RESULTS: Sixteen patients were screened; 10 enrolled; and 9 completed the initial 12-week trial-receiving 85% of estimated caloric needs before, and 101% on the SCD. HB significantly decreased from 3.3 +/- 2.0 to 0.6 +/- 1.3 (P = 0.007) as did PCDAI (21.1 +/- 5.9 to 7.8 +/- 7.1, P = 0.011). LS declined significantly from 2153 +/- 732 to 960 +/- 433 (P = 0.012). Seven patients continued the SCD up to 52 weeks; HB (0.1 +/- 0.4) and PCDAI (5.4 +/- 5.5) remained improved (P = 0.016 and 0.027 compared to baseline), with mean LS at 1046 +/- 372 and 2 patients showed sustained mucosal healing. CONCLUSIONS: Clinical and mucosal improvements were seen in children with CD, who used SCD for 12 and 52 weeks. In addition, CE can monitor mucosal improvement in treatment trials for pediatric CD. Further studies are critically needed to understand the mechanisms underlying SCD's effectiveness in children with CD.},

   abstract = {BACKGROUND: Serum infliximab trough levels correlate with efficacy; dose escalation is often beneficial in patients with Crohn's disease who stop responding to infliximab treatment. OBJECTIVE: To carry out a post hoc analysis of A Crohn's Disease Clinical Trial Evaluating Infliximab in a New Long-term Treatment Regimen I (ACCENT I) to evaluate the association between serum infliximab trough levels and C-reactive protein (CRP) after 14 weeks of induction treatment with durable sustained long-term response (Crohn's Disease Activity Index decrease >/=70 points and reduction >/=25% from baseline). DESIGN: ACCENT I was a multicentre, randomised, placebo-controlled study. Week 14 trough levels and CRP percentage decrease from baseline to week 14 were compared between patients with and without durable sustained response through week 54. Sensitivity and specificity were determined to predict durable sustained response. Receiver operating characteristic (ROC) curves identified optimal cut-off points; logistic regression determined ORs. RESULTS: After induction with 5 mg/kg infliximab, 25% (37/147) and 33% (47/144) of patients sustained week 14 response to infliximab 5 or 10 mg/kg, respectively, administered every 8 weeks without dose escalation, through week 54. Median week 14 trough levels of patients with and without durable sustained response to infliximab 5 mg/kg were 4.0 and 1.9 mug/mL, respectively (p=0.0331). Optimal predictors of durable sustained response to maintenance infliximab 5 mg/kg were week 14 trough level >/=3.5 microg/mL and >/=60% CRP decrease (ORs (95% CI), 3.5 (1.1 to 11.4) and 7.3 (1.4 to 36.7)), respectively, in patients with raised baseline CRP (>8.0 mg/L); area under the ROC curve was 0.75 for both predictors. A >/=3.5 microg/mL week 14 infliximab serum level did not predict durable sustained response to 10 mg/kg maintenance infliximab. CONCLUSIONS: Patients with durable sustained response to maintenance infliximab 5 mg/kg had higher postinduction trough levels than patients without durable sustained response. Serum infliximab trough levels >/=3.5 microg/mL and >/=60% CRP decrease were significantly associated with durable sustained response.},

Based on data from 182 children newly diagnosed with CD and 250 controls, we found that children who consumed a higher dietary ratio of omega6/omega3 were susceptible for CD if they were also carriers of specific variants of CYP4F3 and FADS2 genes.

   abstract = {AIMS: Accurate assessment of inflammatory bowel disease (IBD) activity is the cornerstone of effective therapy. Fecal M2 isoform of pyruvate kinase (M2-PK) and fecal calprotectin (FC) are noninvasive markers of mucosal inflammation in IBD. The aim of this study was to compare performance of M2-PK and FC in assessment of pediatric ulcerative colitis (UC) and Crohn's disease (CD) severity and activity. MATERIALS AND METHODS: 121 patients with IBD, including 75 with UC and 46 with CD were recruited. Control group consisted of 35 healthy children (HS). Patients were assigned to groups depending on disease severity and activity. M2-PK and calprotectin concentration were determined in stool samples using ELISA. Areas under receiver operating characteristic curves (AUC) for FC and M2-PK with cut-off level at which M2-PK specificity was matching FC specificity were calculated and compared. RESULTS: Performance of M2-PK at identifying patients with IBD, UC and CD among HS was inferior to FC. The differences in AUC were respectively: -0.10 (95% confidence interval [CI] [-0.13-(-0.06)], p<0.0001), -0.14 (95% CI [-0.19-(-0.09)], p<0.0001) and -0.03 (95% CI [-0.05-(-0.001)], p<0.02). M2-PK was inferior to FC in discriminating patients with mild UC from those with HS (AUC difference -0.23, 95% CI [-0.31-(-0.15)], p<0.0001). CONCLUSIONS: FC reflects pediatric IBD severity and activity better than M2-PK. This difference is particularly pronounced when identifying patients with mild UC and UC in remission.},

   abstract = {BACKGROUND AND AIMS: Fatigue is one of the main symptoms of inflammatory bowel disease (IBD) and is frequently reported by people in both active and quiescent disease. Many different fatigue assessment scales have been used to measure fatigue, but none has been developed or tested in IBD. This study aimed to develop a fatigue scale specific to the needs and experiences of people with IBD. METHODS: A five-step sequential mixed method design was used: a qualitative phase to assess patients' experience of fatigue and its impact on their lives, and four mixed qualitative-quantitative phases to refine the scale and to assess its psychometric properties. RESULTS: 567 people participated in five phases. The resulting questionnaire has 3 sections: 5 questions assessing frequency and severity of fatigue; 30 questions rating the experience and impact of fatigue; and a free-text section asking for patients' comments and additional issues related to fatigue. Initial validation suggests that the questionnaire has good face and content validity, acceptable to excellent test-retest stability (ICC 0.74 for Section 1 and 0.83 for Section 2) and a high degree of internal consistency (Cronbach's alpha>0.9). CONCLUSIONS: Participants in the study confirmed that fatigue in IBD is burdensome. Items generated and refined by people with IBD-fatigue reflect their experience and form the basis of this new IBD-fatigue scale, which is psychometrically robust with reliability estimates which fall within statistically acceptable ranges. The scale can be used by patients and practitioners to assess severity and impact of fatigue in people with IBD.},

The main themes were: the phenomenon of fatigue as perceived by HCPs; the impact of fatigue on patients' lives; and the methods used by HCPs to deal with fatigue. Fatigue was identified as an important, but difficult and frustrating, symptom to understand. HCPs reported that fatigue impacts on the emotional, private and public aspects of patients' functioning, however there were few methods suggested on how to assess and manage the fatigue. Many expressed frustration at not being able to help more. CONCLUSIONS: The study identified a gap in HCPs' knowledge and their understanding of the complexity of IBD fatigue and the full impact that IBD fatigue has on people's lives. There is a need for more research-generated evidence to enhance our understanding of the concept and the factors associated with IBD fatigue. Advances in the assessment and management of this complicated and poorly understood clinical symptom are needed in order to help enable HCPs to provide better quality care to people affected by IBD and IBD fatigue.},

   abstract = {The objective of this study was to evaluate the acceptability of an alimentary supplement of bovine whey-protein concentrate (WPC) and TGF- beta , unavailable commercially, by patients with Crohn's disease (CD) and determine the chemical composition, solubility, and total amino acids content. The supplement was diluted in water, and an acceptance test was done to evaluate the aroma, flavour, and viscosity of the product using facial hedonic scale (nine-point scale), applied on 54 CD patients. The supplement composition indicated 73.3% protein, 10.5% fat, 2.2% ash, 6.3% water, and 7.7% carbohydrate. The supplement is presented as a good protein source and high content of essential amino acids. The average acceptance for all the attributes was between 5.0 and 6.0, and the flavour was mainly associated with soybean/grain, sour milk, and sweet/vanilla flavour. The results indicated that the supplement provided important nutritional properties for CD patients; however, for a large number of individuals to be encouraged to perform supplementation, it is essential to improve the sensory quality of the product. In order to do so, additional research is necessary to prevent the formation of volatiles which cause off-flavours or to mask undesirable aromas/flavours found in it.},

   abstract = {BACKGROUND: Inflammation during inflammatory bowel disease may alter nutrient availability to adherent mucosal bacteria and impact their metabolic function. Microbial metabolites may regulate intestinal CD4 T-cell homeostasis. We investigated the relationship between inflammation and microbial function by inferred metagenomics of the mucosal microbiota from colonic pinch biopsies of patients with inflammatory bowel disease. METHODS: Paired pinch biopsy samples of known inflammation states were analyzed from ulcerative colitis (UC) (23), Crohn's disease (CD) (21), and control (24) subjects by 16S ribosomal sequencing, histopathologic assessment, and flow cytometry. PICRUSt was used to generate metagenomic data and derive relative Kyoto Encyclopedia of Genes and Genomes Pathway abundance information. Leukocytes were isolated from paired biopsy samples and analyzed by multicolor flow cytometry. Active inflammation was defined by neutrophil infiltration into the epithelium. RESULTS: Carriage of metabolic pathways in the mucosal microbiota was relatively stable among patients with inflammatory bowel disease, despite large variations in individual bacterial community structures. However, microbial function was significantly altered in inflamed tissue of UC patients, with a reduction in carbohydrate and nucleotide metabolism in favor of increased lipid and amino acid metabolism. These differences were not observed in samples from CD patients. In CD, microbial lipid, carbohydrate, and amino acid metabolism tightly correlated with the frequency of CD4Foxp3 Tregs, whereas in UC, these pathways correlated with the frequency of CD4IL-22 (TH22) cells. CONCLUSIONS: Metabolic pathways of the mucosal microbiota in CD do not vary as much as UC with inflammation state, indicating a more systemic perturbation of host-bacteria interactions in CD compared with more localized dysfunction in UC.},

   abstract = {BACKGROUND AND AIMS: A six-week course of exclusive enteral nutrition (EEN) is recommended as first treatment in active paediatric Crohn's disease (CD). We aimed to assess short-term and long-term outcome of EEN, and to identify predictive factors of treatment success. METHODS: The medical records of newly diagnosed paediatric CD patients initiating EEN as remission induction therapy between January 2008 and October 2011 were retrospectively studied. Treatment outcome was assessed using a previously described pattern recognition model. RESULTS: 77 CD patients (median age 13.9 years, 57% male) initiated a six-week course of EEN, combined with azathioprine maintenance treatment in 92%. Patients received EEN as either hyperosmolar sip feeds or polymeric formula by nasogastric tube. In patients completing a six-week course of EEN (n=58), complete remission was achieved in 71%, partial remission in 26%, and no response in 3%. Complete remission rates were higher in children presenting with isolated ileal/ileocaecal disease and malnutrition. Nineteen patients discontinued EEN before the intended treatment period due to worsening of symptoms (n=9) or adherence issues (n=10). Non-adherence occurred more often in older children, females, children from non-Dutch parents, and patients taking hyperosmolar sip feeds compared with polymeric formula by nasogastric tube. The likelihood of relapsing disease within the first year after EEN treatment was 59%. CONCLUSION: A six-week course of EEN is effective in newly diagnosed paediatric CD, with response rates that seem to be influenced by disease location and nutritional status, but not by type of formula. Non-adherence occurs frequently and limits the success of this treatment in everyday clinical practice.},

   abstract = {AIM: A Belgian registry for pediatric Crohn's disease, BELCRO, was created. This first report aims at describing disease presentation and phenotype and determining associations between variables at diagnosis and registration in the database. METHODS: Through a collaborative network, children with previously established Crohn's disease and newly diagnosed children and adolescents (under 18 y of age) were recruited over a 2 year period. Data were collected by 23 centers and entered in a database. Statistical association tests analyzed relationships between variables of interest at diagnosis. RESULTS: Two hundred fifty-five patients were included. Median age at diagnosis was 12.5 y (range: 1.6-18 y); median duration of symptoms prior to diagnosis was 3 m (range: 1-12 m). Neonatal history and previous medical history did not influence disease onset nor disease behavior. Fifty three % of these patients presented with a BMI z-score < -1. CRP was an independent predictor of disease severity. Steroids were widely used as initial treatment in moderate to severe and extensive disease. Over time, immunomodulators and biological were prescribed more frequently, reflecting a lower prescription rate for steroids and 5-ASA. A positive family history was the sole significant determinant for earlier use of immunosuppression. CONCLUSION: In Belgium, the median age of children presenting with Crohn's disease is 12.5 y. Faltering growth, extensive disease and upper GI involvement are frequent. CRP is an independent predictive factor of disease activity. A positive family history appears to be the main determinant for initial treatment choice.},

While the development of the immune system and the establishment of the microflora take place during infancy young patients often have a more severe and extensive disease. The differences in composition and concentration of intestinal microbiota and aberrant immune responses towards the luminal bacteria prompted the concept of an 'ecological' approach to control the disease course. Probiotics, living, non pathogenic micro organisms with a beneficial effect on the host, and prebiotics, oligosaccharides promoting the growth of the beneficial microflora, have been studied to this effect. Results have so far been disappointing for Crohn's disease but encouraging for ulcerative colitis. An overview of studies using probiotics in adults or children and a perspective on specific pediatric issues is provided in this review.},

During a 28-year period 5635 patients were followed up at our Pediatric Rheumatology Unit and 357 had HSP according to the European League Against Rheumatism, the Paediatric Rheumatology International Trials Organisation and the Paediatric Rheumatology European Society validated classification criteria. At the same period, 148 patients with IBD according to the European Society for Paediatric Gastroenterology, Hepatology and Nutrition criteria were followed up at the Pediatric Gastroenterology Unit in our University Hospital. Only two of them had vasculitis, as an extra intestinal manifestation of UC mimicking HSP, and fulfilled both disease criteria. A 2-year old girl had bloody diarrhoea, severe abdominal pain, arthritis in ankles, petechiae and palpable purpura not related to thrombocytopenia in lower limbs. A 5-year old boy had bloody diarrhoea, palpable purpura in buttocks, lower limbs, penis and scrotum associated with arthritis in knees, orchitis in right testicle and periarticular swelling in hands and feet. Their ileocolonoscopy showed diffuse mucosal erythema, oedema, friability and multiple irregular ulcers, and histopathological examination of colonic specimen revealed diffuse chronic mucosal inflammation, crypt distortion and crypt abscesses suggesting ulcerative colitis. There were no signs of intestinal vasculitis in both cases. In conclusion, this is the first study in a paediatric population that evidenced palpable purpura associated with UC mimicking HSP.},

   abstract = {OBJECTIVES: Although intestinal dysbiosis is well established in Crohn's disease (CD), little is known about the microbial metabolic activity of CD patients. In this study, we compared the metabolite patterns of the CD patients with profiles from healthy controls (HCs) and correlated them to disease activity and bacterial composition. In addition, the influence of the prebiotic oligofructose-enriched inulin (OF-IN) on the CD metabolites profile was evaluated. METHODS: Sixty-seven inactive and moderately active CD patients were included in a double-blinded randomized placebo controlled trial (RCT). Patients consumed either 10 g OF-IN or 10 g placebo twice per day for 4 weeks. They collected a fecal sample before the start of the study (baseline) and after the treatment period. In addition, fecal samples were obtained from 40 HCs. The metabolite profile was assessed using gas chromatography-mass spectrometry. RESULTS: The number of fecal metabolites was significantly higher in HCs than in CD patients (P<0.001). Forty compounds differed between CD patients and HCs. When correlating the metabolite levels to disease activity, significantly lower levels of butyrate, pentanoate, hexanoate, heptanoate, and p-cresol were found in active patients as compared with HCs. In the RCT, no significant changes in the metabolite pattern were found in patients randomized to placebo. In patients receiving OF-IN (per protocol; n=21), the relative levels of acetaldehyde (P=0.0008) and butyrate (P=0.0011) were significantly increased as compared with baseline. CONCLUSIONS: We identified medium chain fatty acids and p-cresol as differentiating metabolites toward CD disease status and as compared with HCs. In addition, OF-IN intake primarily increased the carbohydrate fermentation metabolites butyrate and acetaldehyde.},

Compositional alterations may also change the metabolic capacities of the gut bacteria. OBJECTIVE: To examine the metabolic activity of the microbiota of patients with Crohn's disease (CD), UC or pouchitis compared with healthy controls (HC) and determine whether eventual differences might be related to the pathogenesis of the disease. METHODS: Faecal samples were obtained from 40 HC, 83 patients with CD, 68 with UC and 13 with pouchitis. Disease activity was assessed in CD using the Harvey-Bradshaw Index, in UC using the UC Disease Activity Index and in pouchitis using the Pouchitis Disease Activity Index. Metabolite profiles were analysed using gas chromatography-mass spectrometry. RESULTS: The number of metabolites identified in HC (54) was significantly higher than in patients with CD (44, p<0.001), UC (47, p=0.042) and pouchitis (43, p=0.036). Multivariate discriminant analysis predicted HC, CD, UC and pouchitis group membership with high sensitivity and specificity. The levels of medium-chain fatty acids (MCFAs: pentanoate, hexanoate, heptanoate, octanoate and nonanoate), and of some protein fermentation metabolites, were significantly decreased in patients with CD, UC and pouchitis. Hexanoate levels were inversely correlated to disease activity in CD (correlation coefficient=-0.157, p=0.046), whereas a significant positive correlation was found between styrene levels and disease activity in UC (correlation coefficient=0.338, p=0.001). CONCLUSIONS: Faecal metabolic profiling in patients with IBD relative to healthy controls identified MCFAs as important metabolic biomarkers of disease-related changes.

   abstract = {Inflammatory bowel disease is a chronic inflammatory disorder of the gastrointestinal tract that includes both Crohn disease (CD) and ulcerative colitis. Abdominal pain, rectal bleeding, diarrhea, and weight loss characterize both CD and ulcerative colitis. The incidence of IBD in the United States is 70 to 150 cases per 100,000 individuals and, as with other autoimmune diseases, is on the rise. CD can affect any part of the gastrointestinal tract from the mouth to the anus and frequently will include perianal disease. The first description connecting regional enteritis with perianal disease was by Bissell et al in 1934, and since that time perianal disease has become a recognized entity and an important consideration in the diagnosis and treatment of CD. Perianal Crohn disease (PCD) is defined as inflammation at or near the anus, including tags, fissures, fistulae, abscesses, or stenosis. The symptoms of PCD include pain, itching, bleeding, purulent discharge, and incontinence of stool. In this report, we review and discuss the etiology, diagnosis, evaluation, and treatment of PCD.},

We present a case of a 42-year-old former smoker female patient diagnosed with Crohn's disease in September 1995 (with severe nutritional problems). On 20 February 2012, she was admitted due to a probable sepsis (without any previous treatment). After several days she developed a confusion syndrome (probable Wernicke's disease). On 5 March 2012, the patient presented with a febrile episode of 39 degrees C. Two days later, the patient presented aphasia and paraparesis, and 3 days later she presented a complex partial status epilepticus. A lumbar puncture was performed and showed 131 leucocytes (63% granulocytes) and proteins 296.3. The abdominopelvic CT scan revealed a presacral collection that seem to extend cranially towards the lumbosacral spine. The lumbar MRI confirmed the lumbar epidural abscess secondary to the fistulisation of the presacral abscess.},

   abstract = {UNLABELLED: The epidemiology and natural history of pediatric primary sclerosing cholangitis (PSC), autoimmune sclerosing cholangitis (ASC), and autoimmune hepatitis (AIH) are not well characterized. Using multiple, overlapping search strategies followed by a detailed records review, we identified all cases of pediatric PSC, ASC, AIH, and inflammatory bowel disease (IBD) in a geographically isolated region of the United States. We identified 607 cases of IBD, 29 cases of PSC, 12 cases of ASC, and 44 cases of AIH. The mean age at diagnosis was 13.0 years for PSC, 11.3 years for ASC, and 9.8 years for AIH. The incidence and prevalence of PSC, ASC, and AIH were 0.2 and 1.5 cases, 0.1 and 0.6 cases, and 0.4 and 3.0 cases per 100,000 children, respectively. The mean duration of follow-up was 5.9 years. The probability of developing complicated liver disease within 5 years of the diagnosis of liver disease was 37% [95% confidence interval (CI) = 21%-58%] for PSC, 25% (95% CI = 7%-70%) for ASC, and 15% (95% CI = 7%-33%) for AIH. The 5-year survival rates with the native liver were 78% (95% CI = 54%-91%) for PSC, 90% (95% CI = 47%-99%) for ASC, and 87% (95% CI = 71%-95%) for AIH. Cholangiocarcinoma developed in 2 of the 29 PSC patients (6.9%). PSC occurred in 9.9% of patients with ulcerative colitis (UC) and in 0.6% of patients with Crohn's disease (CD). ASC occurred in 2.3% of UC patients and 0.9% of CD patients. AIH occurred in 0.4% of UC patients and in 0.3% of CD patients. Liver disease occurred in 39 of 607 IBD patients (6.4%) overall. CONCLUSION: Immune-mediated liver diseases are important sources of morbidity in children. Using a population-based design, this study quantifies the burden and natural history of immune-mediated liver disease in children.},

   abstract = {OBJECTIVES: Patients with inflammatory bowel disease (IBD) have a higher risk for venous thromboembolism compared with non-IBD subjects. The pathogenic mechanisms of the thrombotic events are not fully understood. We investigated levels of circulating microparticles and their influence on thrombin generation in pediatric patients with IBD during active and quiescent disease compared with healthy controls. METHODS: Plasma samples were collected from 33 pediatric patients with Crohn disease (CD), 20 pediatric patients with ulcerative colitis (UC), and 60 healthy controls. Microparticles' procoagulant activity was measured by enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay, and the dependency of thrombin generation on microparticles-derived tissue factor was determined by means of calibrated automated thrombography. RESULTS: The procoagulant function of microparticles was significantly increased in patients with active and inactive CD, and active UC compared with controls. Endogenous thrombin potential was significantly higher in patients with CD and UC compared with controls. A minor influence of microparticles on thrombin generation was only observed for patients with active UC. CONCLUSIONS: Our study shows increased procoagulant function of microparticles in pediatric patients with active and quiescent CD and active UC compared with controls, but demonstrates that they are not a major cause for the higher thrombin generation in pediatric patients with IBD.},

   abstract = {Due to the intestinal inflammation, tissue damage, and painful abdominal symptoms restricting dietary intake associated with both diseases, patients with intestinal pelvic radiation disease (PRD) or inflammatory bowel disease (IBD) are at increased risk to develop protein calorie malnutrition and micronutrient deficiencies. In the current paper, we review the nutritional management of both diseases, listing the similar approaches of nutritional management and the nutritional implications of intestinal dysfunction of both diseases. Malnutrition is prevalent in patients with either disease and nutritional risk screening and assessment of nutritional status are required for designing the proper nutritional intervention plan. This plan may include dietary management, oral nutritional supplementation, and enteral and/or parenteral nutrition. In addition to managing malnutrition, nutrients exert immune modulating effects during periods of intestinal inflammation and can play a role in mitigating the risks associated with the disease activity. Consistently, exclusive enteral feeding is recommended for inducing remission in pediatric patients with active Crohn's disease, with less clear guidelines on use in patients with ulcerative colitis. The field of immune modulating nutrition is an evolving science that takes into consideration the specific mechanism of action of nutrients, nutrient-nutrient interaction, and preexisting nutritional status of the patients.},

   abstract = {OBJECTIVES: The NOS2 gene encodes for the inducible nitric oxide synthase (iNOS), responsible for nitric oxide (NO) production, which contributes to antimicrobial and antipathogenic activities. Higher levels of both iNOS and NO-induced damage have been observed in inflammatory bowel disease (IBD) patients. NOS2 may have a role in a specific subset of IBD patients with severe and/or extensive colitis. Therefore, the aim of this study is to examine the role of NOS2 in such a subset, very early onset IBD (VEO-IBD). METHODS: Seventeen tag single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) in the NOS2 gene were successfully genotyped in VEO-IBD patients. Genetic associations were replicated in an independent VEO-IBD cohort. Functional analysis for iNOS activity was performed on the most significantly associated functional variant. RESULTS: The NOS2 rs2297518 SNP was found to be associated in VEO-IBD in two independent cohorts. Upon combined analysis, a coding variant (S608L) showed the strongest association with VEO-IBD (Pcombined=1.13 x 10(-6), OR (odds ratio)=3.398 (95% CI (confidence interval) 2.02-5.717)) as well as associations with VEO-Crohn's disease and VEO-ulcerative colitis (UC). This variant also showed an association with UC diagnosed between 11 and 17 years of age but not with adult-onset IBD (>17 years). B-cell lymphoblastoid cell lines genotyped for the risk variant as well as Henle-407 cells transfected with a plasmid construct with the risk variant showed higher NO production. Colonic biopsies of VEO-IBD patients showed higher immunohistochemical staining of nitrotyrosine, indicating more nitrosative stress and tissue damage. CONCLUSIONS: These studies suggest the importance of iNOS in genetic susceptibility to younger IBD presentation due to higher NO production.},

Nutritional deficiencies result from reduced oral intake, malabsorption, medication side effects and systemic inflammation due to active disease.

The use of parenteral nutrition in CD is mainly limited to the preoperative setting or for patients with intestinal failure, but does not offer any additional advantage over EN in disease control. Dietary modifications, including elimination-reintroduction diets and a low fermentable, oligosaccharides, disaccharides, monosaccharides and polyols (FODMAP) diet may improve symptoms but there are currently no data to suggest that these approaches have any role in the induction or maintenance of remission.},

   abstract = {OBJECTIVE: To perform a systematic review of the literature about the nutritional impact of inflammatory bowel diseases in children and adolescents. DATA SOURCES: A systematic review was performed using PubMed/MEDLINE, LILACS and SciELo databases, with inclusion of articles in Portuguese and in English with original data, that analyzed nutritional aspects of inflammatory bowel diseases in children and adolescents. The initial search used the terms "inflammatory bowel diseases" and "children" or "adolescents" and "nutritional evaluation" or "nutrition deficiency". The selection of studies was initially performed by reading the titles and abstracts. Review studies and those without data for pediatric patients were excluded. Subsequently, the full reading of the articles considered relevant was performed. RESULTS: 237 studies were identified, and 12 of them were selected according to the inclusion criteria. None of them was performed in South America. During the analysis of the studies, it was observed that nutritional characteristics of patients with inflammatory bowel disease may be altered; the main reports were related to malnutrition, growth stunting, delayed puberty and vitamin D deficiency. CONCLUSION: There are nutritional consequences of inflammatory bowel diseases in children and adolescents, mainly growth stunting, slower pubertal development, underweight and vitamin deficiencies. Nutritional impairments were more significant in patients with Crohn's disease; overweight and obesity were more common in patients with ulcerative rectocolitis. A detailed nutritional assessment should be performed periodically in children and adolescents with inflammatory bowel disease.},

   abstract = {BACKGROUND: Complications of Crohn's disease may include intra-abdominal abscesses, which often result in hospitalization, surgery, and increased cost. There is a paucity of primary research and practice guidelines regarding optimal management in children. The study objective was to assess the current standard of care in an effort to define best practices and identify priority areas for additional research. METHODS: The web-based survey was approved by the Institutional Review Board and North American Society for Pediatric Gastroenterology, Hepatology and Nutrition. We examined preferences in imaging, drainage, anti-tumor necrosis factor-alpha therapy, and antibiotic use. We assessed for associations between provider level of experience and management strategies. RESULTS: A total of 248 of 1608 North American Society for Pediatric Gastroenterology, Hepatology and Nutrition members responded. Of them, 64% were male, 87% practiced in the United States, and 74% practiced in an academic setting. Approximately 26% cared for >50 patients with Crohn's disease and 25% were in practice for >20 years. For initial imaging, computed tomography was chosen by 52%, followed by magnetic resonance imaging (26%) and ultrasound (21%), and upon reassessment computed tomography was chosen by 13%, magnetic resonance imaging by 33%, and ultrasound by 47%. About 77% recommended percutaneous drainage, whereas 21% would only do so if antibiotics were unsuccessful, and 2% proceed to immediate surgery. If a fistula was demonstrated, 70% planned medical therapy followed by surgical resection; only 30% planned surgical resection if no fistula was present. Approximately 55% would consider infliximab before surgery. There were no clinically significant associations between treatment strategies and practitioner experience. CONCLUSIONS: There is considerable variation in diagnostic and therapeutic interventions in the management of intra-abdominal abscesses, which was not explained by practitioner experience.},

   abstract = {Isorhamnetin is an O-methylated flavonol present in fruit and vegetables. We recently reported the identification of isorhamnetin as an activator of the human pregnane X receptor (PXR), a known target for abrogating inflammation in inflammatory bowel disease (IBD). The current study investigated the role of isorhamnetin as a putative mouse PXR activator in ameliorating chemically induced IBD. Using two different models (ulcerative colitis like and Crohn's disease like) of experimental IBD in mice, we demonstrated that isorhamnetin abrogated inflammation through inhibiting the activity of myeloperoxidase, the levels of TNF-alpha and IL-6, the mRNA expression of proinflammatory mediators (iNOS, ICAM-1, COX2, TNF-alpha, IL-2 and IL-6) and the phosphorylation of IkappaBalpha and NF-kappaB p65. PXR gene overexpression inhibited NF-kappaB luciferase activity, and the inhibition was potentiated by isorhamnetin treatment. PXR knockdown by siRNA demonstrated the necessity for PXR in isorhamnetin-mediated up-regulation of xenobiotic metabolism genes. Ligand pocket-filling mutants (S247W/C284W and S247W/C284W/S208W) of human PXR weakened the effect of isorhamnetin on PXR activation. Molecular docking studies and time-resolved fluorescence resonance energy transfer competitive binding assays confirmed the ligand (isorhamnetin)-binding affinity. These results clearly demonstrated the ameliorating effect of isorhamnetin on experimental IBD via PXR-mediated up-regulation of xenobiotic metabolism and down-regulation of NF-kappaB signaling. The novel findings may contribute to the effective utilization of isorhamnetin or its derivatives as a PXR ligand in the treatment of human IBD.},

   abstract = {BACKGROUND: A limited body of research suggests that ongoing maintenance enteral nutrition (MEN) can be beneficial in maintaining disease remission in Crohn's Disease (CD). We aimed to assess how achievable MEN is and whether it helps to prolong remission. METHODS: Patients newly diagnosed with CD in 2010 and 2011 who commenced exclusive enteral nutrition (EEN) for 8 weeks were followed up for a year post diagnosis. All patients who took EEN were encouraged to continue MEN post EEN. Data on azathioprine use was also collected. Categorical variables were compared using chi-square/Fischer's exact test. Medians were expressed along with complete data ranges. RESULTS: 59 patients (34 male, median age 11.07 years, range 2.5-16.33 years) were identified. 11/59 (18%) had a poor response to EEN and were switched to steroids. 48/59 patients completed 8 weeks EEN and achieved clinical remission/response. 46/48 patients received Modulen IBD(R), 29/48 (60%) consumed EEN orally and 19/48 (40%) via NGT. 15/48 (31%) patients were able to continue MEN post EEN completion. MEN was consumed for a mean of 10.8 months (range 4-14 months). 14/15 patients drank MEN and 1/15 had MEN via NGT. Remission rates at 1 year in patients continuing MEN were 60% (9/15) compared to 15% (2/13) in patients taking no treatment (p = 0.001) and 65% (13/20) in patients taking azathioprine (p = 0.14). CONCLUSION: A sub group of patients can continue MEN as a maintenance treatment and this seems a useful strategy, especially in those who are not commencing azathioprine.},

   abstract = {BACKGROUND: Crohn's disease (CD) patients with elevated granulocyte-macrophage colony-stimulating factor autoantibodies (GM-CSF Ab) are more likely to develop stricturing behavior requiring surgery. Computed tomography or magnetic resonance enterography (CTE or MRE) may detect luminal narrowing (LN) before stricture development. The objective of this study was to determine whether CD patients with elevated GM-CSF Ab (>/=1.6 mug/mL) have a higher prevalence of LN and stricturing on CTE or MRE. METHODS: A single-center, cross-sectional study of 153 pediatric patients with CD and control subjects undergoing diagnostic CTE or MRE. Examinations were evaluated for disease activity using a novel scoring system and for the presence of LN, stricture, intra-abdominal abscess, or fistulae. Dichotomous outcomes were compared with respect to antibody status (high or low) using Fisher's exact test and logistic regression, whereas continuous outcomes were evaluated using unpaired t test. RESULTS: GM-CSF Ab were elevated in CD patients (n = 114) with a median (interquartile range) GM-CSF Ab level of 2.3 mug/mL (0.5-6.6 mug/mL) compared with 0.6 mug/mL (0.3-1.3 mug/mL) in healthy and disease control subjects (n = 39) (P = 0.001). Ileal disease location was more common in CD patients with high GM-CSF Ab (P < 0.001). LN increased from 39% in CD patients with low GM-CSF Ab to 71% in those with high levels (P = 0.004) and remained significantly associated with high GM-CSF Ab in a multivariate logistic model, which included age, gender, small bowel location, and duration of disease. Stricturing prevalence on CTE or MRE examination increased from 4% in CD patients with low GM-CSF Ab to 19% in those with high GM-CSF Ab (P = 0.03). CONCLUSIONS: Pediatric CD patients with high GM-CSF Ab levels have a higher prevalence of LN on CTE or MRE. Further study will be needed to determine whether medical therapy will reduce progression to stricturing behavior in these patients.},

   abstract = {Probiotic microorganisms have historically been used to rebalance disturbed intestinal microbiota and to diminish gastrointestinal disorders, such as diarrhea or inflammatory bowel diseases (e.g., Crohn's disease and ulcerative colitis). Recent studies explore the potential for expanded uses of probiotics on medical disorders that increase the risk of developing cardiovascular diseases and diabetes, such as obesity, hypercholesterolemia, arterial hypertension, and metabolic disturbances such as hyperhomocysteinemia and oxidative stress. This review aims at summarizing the proposed molecular and cellular mechanisms involved in probiotic-host interactions and to identify the nature of the resulting beneficial effects. Specific probiotic strains can act by modulating immune response, by producing particular molecules or releasing biopeptides, and by modulating nervous system activity. To date, the majority of studies have been conducted in animal models. New investigations on the related mechanisms in humans need to be carried out to better enable targeted and effective use of the broad variety of probiotic strains.},

   abstract = {The influence of genetics in the etiology of inflammatory bowel disease (IBD) was initially demonstrated by epidemiological data, including differences in prevalence among different ethnic groups, familial aggregation of IBD, concordance in twins, and association with genetic syndromes. These early observations paved the way to molecular genetics in IBD, and culminated in the identification of nucleotide-binding oligomerization domain containing 2 (NOD2) gene as an IBD risk gene in 2001. As in other complex diseases, the advent of Genome Wide Association studies has dramatically improved the resolution of the IBD genome and our understanding of the pathogenesis of IBD. However, the complexity of the genetic puzzle in IBD seems more pronounced today than ever previously. In total, 163 risk genes/loci have been identified, and the corresponding number of possible causal variants is challenging. The great majority of these loci are associated with both Crohn's disease and ulcerative colitis, suggesting that nearly all of the biological mechanisms involved in one disease play some role in the other. Interestingly, a large proportion of the IBD risk loci are also shared with other immune-mediated diseases, primary immunodeficiencies and mycobacterial diseases.},

   abstract = {OBJECTIVE: Proper interactions between the intestinal mucosa, gut microbiota and nutrient flow are required to establish homoeostasis of the host. Since the proximal part of the small intestine is the first region where these interactions occur, and since most of the nutrient absorption occurs in the jejunum, it is important to understand the dynamics of metabolic responses of the mucosa in this intestinal region. DESIGN: Germ-free mice aged 8-10 weeks were conventionalised with faecal microbiota, and responses of the jejunal mucosa to bacterial colonisation were followed over a 30-day time course. Combined transcriptome, histology, (1)H NMR metabonomics and microbiota phylogenetic profiling analyses were used. RESULTS: The jejunal mucosa showed a two-phase response to the colonising microbiota. The acute-phase response, which had already started 1 day after conventionalisation, involved repression of the cell cycle and parts of the basal metabolism. The secondary-phase response, which was consolidated during conventionalisation (days 4-30), was characterised by a metabolic shift from an oxidative energy supply to anabolic metabolism, as inferred from the tissue transcriptome and metabonome changes. Detailed transcriptome analysis identified tissue transcriptional signatures for the dynamic control of the metabolic reorientation in the jejunum. The molecular components identified in the response signatures have known roles in human metabolic disorders, including insulin sensitivity and type 2 diabetes mellitus. CONCLUSION: This study elucidates the dynamic jejunal response to the microbiota and supports a prominent role for the jejunum in metabolic control, including glucose and energy homoeostasis. The molecular signatures of this process may help to find risk markers in the declining insulin sensitivity seen in human type 2 diabetes mellitus, for instance.},

   abstract = {OBJECTIVE: The aim of the present study was to investigate the relation between consanguinity and inflammatory bowel diseases (IBD). METHODS: Review of the medical records of children with a final diagnosis of IBD to determine age, sex, and type of IBD, supplemented by information on consanguinity and family history (FH) of IBD in relatives. There were 138 children, ages 1.4 to 19.3 years, and 50% were girls. RESULTS: The prevalence of consanguinity was 50%, 53%, 39% and 60% in IBD, Crohn disease (CD), ulcerative colitis (UC), and controls, respectively. There was a significantly higher prevalence of consanguinity in controls than in patients with IBD and UC (P = 0.02 and 0.026, respectively), whereas the difference between CD patients and controls was not significant (P = 0.20). The prevalence of first cousin consanguinity was 71%, 73.2%, 61.5% and 70.5% in patients with IBD, CD, UC, and controls, respectively, indicating no significant difference between these conditions and controls (P = 0.95, P = 0.78, P = 0.33, respectively). There was no significant difference in the prevalence of consanguinity in the parents of children with or without a FH of either CD (P = 0.89) or UC (P = 0.32). CONCLUSIONS: There is no significant relation between parental consanguinity and IBD in this population, especially when there is no FH of disease, suggesting reduced genetic susceptibility; however, further studies including larger sample size and details of FH of consanguinity and IBD in multiple generations are needed for further definitions of the role of consanguinity.},

   abstract = {BACKGROUND: Mucosa-associated Escherichia coli are abundant in inflammatory bowel disease (IBD), but whether these bacteria gain intracellular access within the mucosa is uncertain. If E. coli does gain intracellular access, the contribution of bacterial pathogenicity to this requires further elucidation. This study aimed to quantify and characterize mucosa-associated and intracellular E. coli in patients with IBD and in healthy control subjects (HC). METHODS: Mucosal biopsies from 30 patients with Crohn's disease (CD), 15 with ulcerative colitis (UC), and 14 HC were cultured with or without gentamicin protection to recover intracellular or mucosa-associated E. coli, respectively. Overall, 40 strains (CD: n = 24, UC: n = 9, and HC: n = 7) were characterized by phylogenetic typing, adhesion and invasion assays, detection of virulence factors, antimicrobial resistance genes, and proteomic analysis. RESULTS: Mucosa-associated E. coli were more abundant in CD and UC than in HC (2750 versus 1350 versus 230 median colony-forming units per biopsy; P = 0.01). Intracellular E. coli were more prevalent in CD (90%) than in UC (47%) or HC mucosal biopsies (0%) (P < 0.001). Of 24 CD strains, 2 were adherent and invasive, but there were no unifying pathogenicity determinants that could distinguish most CD strains from UC or HC strains, or intracellular isolates from mucosa-associated isolates. CONCLUSIONS: Intracellular E. coli are more common in CD than in UC and not identified in HC. Most intracellular E. coli did not have characterizing pathogenic features, suggesting a significant role for defects in mucosal immunity or barrier dysfunction in their ability to gain intracellular access.},

   abstract = {OBJECTIVES: The aim of this study was to describe the incidence and prevalence of inflammatory bowel disease (IBD) in children <17 years of age in 30 years from 1978 to 2007. METHODS: From January 1, 1978, to December 31, 2007, the sex- and age-adjusted annual incidence and prevalence of pediatric IBD per 100,000 population were calculated based on the pediatric IBD database of the only pediatric tertiary center in the province. The annual health statistics records for the Province of Manitoba were used to calculate population estimates for the participants. To ensure validity of data, the University of Manitoba IBD Epidemiology Database was analyzed for patients <17 years of age from 1989 to 2000. RESULTS: The sex- and age-adjusted incidence of pediatric Crohn disease has increased from 1.2/100,000 in 1978 to 4.68/100,000 in 2007 (P < 0.001). For ulcerative colitis, the incidence has increased from 0.47/100,000 in 1978 to 1.64/100,000 in 2007 (P < 0.001). During the same time period, the prevalence of Crohn disease has increased from 3.1 to 18.9/100,000 (P < 0.001) and from 0.7 to 12.7/100,000 for ulcerative colitis (P < 0.001). During the last 5 years of the study the average annual incidence of IBD in urban patients was 8.69/100,000 as compared with 4.75/100,000 for rural patients (P < 0.001). CONCLUSIONS: The incidence and prevalence of pediatric IBD are increasing. The majority of patients were residents of urban Manitoba, confirming the important role of environmental factors in the etiopathogenesis of IBD.},

   abstract = {BACKGROUND: In paediatric Crohn's disease (PCD), 6-8 weeks of exclusive enteral nutrition (EEN) is effective in 60-80% cases. EEN is followed by gradual food reintroduction over variable (1-5 weeks) periods. Currently, there is no recommended duration or method for food reintroduction. The rationale for slow reintroduction is unclear and may be because of concerns about food intolerance or to maintain longer remission. AIMS: The aims of this study were as follows: to compare relapse rates following standard and rapid reintroduction of food after EEN in PCD and to determine the duration of maintained remission in two groups of PCD patients. MATERIALS AND METHODS: Two groups with PCD were compared: group A received standard food reintroduction over 5 weeks and group B received rapid reintroduction over 3 days. Data were collected over two consecutive time periods: group A (2005-2009) and group B (2009-2011). Only patients with a new diagnosis of PCD were included. Those with strictures and those on steroids or biologicals during EEN were excluded. The minimum duration of follow-up was 1 year. RESULTS: Group A included 20 patients and group B included 19 patients. In these groups, EEN led to clinical remission in 80% of the patients in group A and in 76% of the patients in group B. At 6 months, one-third of the patients from each group had developed relapse and a year after EEN, 50% of the patients in group A and 47% of the patients in group B developed relapse. Time to first relapse was 188 days (group A) and 136 days (group B). None of these results were statistically significant. CONCLUSION: In PCD, rapid food reintroduction following 6-week EEN is safe and equally effective as longer food reintroduction. We propose that a rapid food reintroduction schedule be recommended as the most tolerable approach for food reintroduction. Relapse rate and duration of remission are uninfluenced by the type of food reintroduction.},

   abstract = {OBJECTIVES: Although randomized trials demonstrated the efficacy of infliximab for both pediatric Crohn disease and ulcerative colitis (UC), few patients in these studies exhibited colitis requiring hospitalization. The aims of this study were to determine the rate of subsequent infliximab failure and dose escalation in pediatric patients who started taking infliximab during hospitalization for colitis-predominant IBD, and to identify potential predictors of these endpoints. METHODS: This is a single-center retrospective cohort study of patients admitted from 2005 to 2010 with Crohn colitis, UC, or IBD-unspecified (IBD-U) and initiated on infliximab. RESULTS: We identified 29 patients (12 Crohn colitis, 15 UC, and 2 IBD-U; median age 14 years) with a median follow-up of 923 days. Eighteen patients (62%) required infliximab dose escalation (increased dose or decreased infusion interval). Infliximab failure occurred in 18 patients (62%) because of ineffectiveness in 12 (67%) and adverse reactions in 6 (33%). Twelve patients (41%) underwent colectomy. Subsequent need for infliximab dose escalation was associated with lower body mass index z score (P = 0.01), lower serum albumin (P = 0.03), and higher erythrocyte sedimentation rate (ESR) (P = 0.002) at baseline. ESR predicted subsequent infliximab dose escalation with an area under the curve of 0.89 (95% confidence interval [CI] 0.72-1.00) and a sensitivity and specificity at a cutoff of 38 mm/hour of 0.79 (95% CI 0.49-0.95) and 0.88 (95% CI 0.47-0.99), respectively. CONCLUSIONS: Most hospitalized pediatric patients with colitis treated with infliximab require early-dose escalation and fail the drug long term. Low body mass index and albumin and high ESR, may identify patients who would benefit from a higher infliximab starting dose.},

   abstract = {BACKGROUND & AIMS: Mesenteric adipose tissue hypertrophy is a hallmark of Crohn's disease and can express various adipokines. Exclusive enteral nutrition could effectively induce remission in Crohn's disease with mechanisms largely unknown. We investigated whether exclusive enteral nutrition could modify mesenteric fat in patients with active Crohn's disease. METHODS: Sixteen patients who underwent resection for ileum Crohn's disease were studied. As a control group, eight patients without inflammatory bowel disease were enrolled. Before operation, eight Crohn's disease patients received exclusive enteral nutrition for four weeks, and the other patients had no nutritional therapy. The mesenteric fat samples were obtained during operation. Adipocyte size, adipokine production and topical C-reactive protein level were assessed. RESULTS: The adipocyte size from patients treated with exclusive enteral nutrition was much larger than that from Crohn's disease patients without nutritional therapy. Furthermore, protein levels of proinflammatory adipokines such as TNF-alpha and leptin were lower while protein level of adiponectin was higher in these patients. As to mRNA level, the expression of adiponctin was up-regulated and leptin was down-regulated in the patients received enteral nutrition. CONCLUSIONS: Exclusive enteral nutrition could ameliorate mesenteric fat alterations which are associated with intestinal injury in patients with Crohn's disease by restoring adipocyte morphology and diminishing the inflammatory environment of mesenteric fat.},

Both types of inflammatory bowel disease have a complex etiology, resulting from a genetically determined susceptibility interacting with environmental factors, including the diet and gut microbiota. Genome Wide Association Studies have implicated more than 160 single-nucleotide polymorphisms in disease susceptibility. Consideration of the different pathways suggested to be involved implies that specific dietary interventions are likely to be appropriate, dependent upon the nature of the genes involved. Epigenetics and the gut microbiota are also responsive to dietary interventions. Nutrigenetics may lead to personalized nutrition for disease prevention and treatment, while nutrigenomics may help to understand the nature of the disease and individual response to nutrients.},

   abstract = {Treatment goals in Crohn's disease (CD) are evolving beyond the control of symptoms towards deep remission, which encompasses clinical remission and mucosal healing. The ultimate goals are to prevent bowel damage, reduce long-term disability, and maintain normal quality of life. Until recently, goals of CD management focused on induction and maintenance of a symptomatic response, and little attention was paid to the delay or even prevention of disease progression. A very different approach is taken with other chronic diseases, such as hypertension, diabetes, and rheumatoid arthritis. This more comprehensive approach is often referred to as 'treat-to-target' strategy. The treat-to-target strategy defines a new treatment objective that aims to achieve and sustain both clinical remission and control of inflammation. With our new understanding of the etiopathophysiology of inflammatory bowel disease, are we mistreating our patients? The most convincing concept at this time is that of a defective mucosal barrier due to inappropriate recognition of the luminal flora or a defective defense against those bacteria. These recent theories indicate that the paradigm of immune suppression may not be the optimal concept. Therefore, a variety of approaches to improve the barrier function or to modulate luminal components have to be considered. We still have much to learn about these concepts in order to achieve the treatment goals of avoiding structural damage and complications.},

   abstract = {OBJECTIVE: Adolescent patients with chronic health conditions must gradually assume responsibility for their health. Self-management skills are needed for a successful transfer from adolescent to adult health care, but the development of these skills could be resource intensive. Pediatric providers are already instrumental in teaching patients about their health and may improve these skills. The aim of the study was to evaluate whether informal education of pediatric providers regarding transition improves inflammatory bowel disease (IBD) patient self-management skills. METHODS: Consecutive patients with IBD older than 10 years who presented to the outpatient setting were administered a survey regarding self-management behaviors in 2008 and 2011. During this time, several conferences on transition were presented to the providers. RESULTS: In 2008, 294 patients completed the survey (82%) compared with 121 patients (89%) in 2011. The patient groups were comparable with respect to sex (boys 50% vs 42%), mean age (16.7 vs 16.2 years), and type of IBD (Crohn 68% vs 66%). The 13- to 15-year-olds reported calling in refills (11%, 8%, respectively), scheduling clinic appointment (0, 1%), preparing questions (13%, 5%), and taking the main role in talking during clinic visits (15%, 24%). The 16- to 18-year-olds reported calling in refills (13%, 27%), scheduling clinic appointments (9%, 6%), preparing questions (9%, 16%), and taking the main role in talking in clinic visits (36%, 45%). Responsibility for behaviors gradually increases with age, but did not differ significantly between 2008 and 2011. CONCLUSIONS: Increasing awareness around transition readiness for pediatric providers had an insignificant effect on the self-management skills of patients with IBD. A more formal or structured approach is likely required to improve transition skills in adolescent patients.},

   abstract = {In general, the patient receiving surgery for Crohn's disease (CD) makes an uncomplicated recovery with a speed consistent with the degree of surgical 'insult' - which in these days of laparoscopic approach and minimalist resection often means very rapidly indeed. However, in the patient who has had repeated surgery and in those where there was profound intra-abdominal sepsis this may not be the case. A prolonged period of ileus is to be expected and patients may well require parenteral nutrition to support them through this time. A curious and incompletely understood form of functional short-bowel syndrome is also seen in these and other patients after CD resection. Despite apparently limited resection and known adequate residual bowel length, with more than 1.5 m of healthy small intestine remaining in continuity, some patients develop a high-output state with many litres of diarrhoea or stomal effluent each day. Fortunately, in most cases this resolves spontaneously, but the process may take months: again these individuals may need parenteral nutrition support (including home parenteral nutrition in some). Nutritional support is needed in a broader range of postoperative patients, however, and it is increasingly recognised that simply providing supplements and encouraging eating will not be enough to restore lean body mass and function unless it is combined with an exercise programme. Analogy with sports training helps both physicians and patients understand this better. The patient who has undergone CD surgery has often been ill for some time beforehand, and the psychological aspects of chronic disease and the changes brought about by surgery - especially the creation of a stoma - may themselves become the most prominent features of the rehabilitative phase. A multidisciplinary approach is clearly justified and should be made available to all post-operative patients as needed.},

   abstract = {OBJECTIVES: ImproveCareNow (ICN) is the largest pediatric learning health system in the nation and started as a quality improvement collaborative. To test the feasibility and validity of using ICN data for clinical research, we evaluated the effectiveness of anti-tumor necrosis factor-alpha (anti-TNFalpha) agents in the management of pediatric Crohn disease (CD). METHODS: Data were collected in 35 pediatric gastroenterology practices (April 2007 to March 2012) and analyzed as a sequence of nonrandomized trials. Patients who had moderate to severe CD were classified as initiators or non-initiators of anti-TNFalpha therapy. Among 4130 patients who had pediatric CD, 603 were new users and 1211 were receiving anti-TNFalpha therapy on entry into ICN. RESULTS: During a 26-week follow-up period, rate ratios obtained from Cox proportional hazards models, adjusting for patient and disease characteristics and concurrent medications, were 1.53 (95% confidence interval [CI], 1.20-1.96) for clinical remission and 1.74 (95% CI, 1.33-2.29) for corticosteroid-free remission. The rate ratio for corticosteroid-free remission was comparable to the estimate produced by the adult SONIC study, which was a randomized controlled trial on the efficacy of anti-TNFalpha therapy. The number needed to treat was 5.2 (95% CI, 3.4-11.1) for clinical remission and 5.0 (95% CI, 3.4-10.0) for corticosteroid-free remission. CONCLUSIONS: In routine pediatric gastroenterology practice settings, anti-TNFalpha therapy was effective at achieving clinical and corticosteroid-free remission for patients who had Crohn disease. Using data from the ICN learning health system for the purpose of observational research is feasible and produces valuable new knowledge.},

We describe a case of hepatocellular carcinoma in a 34-year-old man with Crohn's disease treated with azathioprine and infliximab. The patient had no history of liver disease and a complete autoimmune and viral workup was unremarkable. Unfortunately, the patient developed widespread metastatic disease and passed away 5 months after his initial diagnosis. The mechanism of hepatocellular carcinoma in patients' with Crohn's disease is poorly understood and may include both autoimmunity and treatment-related complications. Previous case reports suggest the possibility of a concerning association between azathioprine therapy and the development of hepatocellular carcinoma in patients with Crohn's disease. Clinicians may consider early imaging in patients with Crohn's disease presenting with concerning symptomatology or abnormal liver enzymes, especially in those being treated with azathioprine alone or in combination with infliximab. Future research may help to uncover additional risk factors for this exceedingly rare diagnosis in this patient population.},

   abstract = {The ErbB tyrosine kinases (epidermal growth factor receptor (EGFR), ErbB2/HER2, ErbB3, and ErbB4) are cell surface growth factor receptors widely expressed in many developing mammalian tissues, including in the intestinal tract. Signaling elicited by these receptors promotes epithelial cell growth and survival, and ErbB ligands have been proposed as therapeutic agents for intestinal diseases of pediatric populations, including inflammatory bowel disease (IBD), necrotizing enterocolitis (NEC), and inflammation associated with total parenteral nutrition (TPN). Furthermore, emerging evidence points to reduced ErbB ligand expression and thus reduced ErbB activity in IBD, NEC, and TPN models. This review will discuss the current understanding of the role of ErbB receptors in the pathogenesis and potential treatment of pediatric intestinal inflammation, with focus on the altered signaling in disease and the molecular mechanisms by which exogenous ligands are protective.},

   abstract = {BACKGROUND: Exclusive enteral nutrition (EEN) induces remission and mucosal healing in children with active Crohn's disease (CD). AIM: To compare short- and long-term outcomes of the first vs. second courses of EEN, and to identify predictors of sustained remission. METHODS: Retrospective single centre analysis of all patients with CD (6-18 years) treated with EEN over 7.5 years. Patients were excluded if exposed to anti-TNFalpha or corticosteroids 3 months prior to EEN. Data included disease phenotype, activity, NOD2 genotype, laboratory indices and anthropometrics. Remission and relapse were defined by mathematically weighted Paediatric Crohn's Disease Activity Index (wPCDAI) with 1-year follow-up. RESULTS: Of 94 patients treated with EEN, 52 fulfilled inclusion criteria (31 male, mean age 13.2 years). Azathioprine was started within the first month in 33/52 patients; 26/52 received a second EEN course. First compared to second EEN revealed higher wPCDAI at start (59 vs. 40, P < 0.0001), tended to higher remission rates after 3 months (92% vs. 77%, n.s.), but showed comparable 1-year relapse rates (67% vs. 70%, median time 231 vs. 145 days, n.s.). Disease activity, weight gain and inflammatory markers showed better improvement with first EEN. Faecal calprotectin >200 mug/g during EEN was associated with shorter remission (median time 157 vs. 287 days, n.s.). Certain NOD2 genotypes were related to higher relapse rates (92% R702W or G908R vs. 50% 1007fs vs. 60% wild-type, P < 0.01). CONCLUSIONS: Exclusive enteral nutrition induces remission in active Crohn's disease, but efficacy tends to decrease with the second course. Despite early azathioprine use, 1-year relapse rates are high, but may be related to NOD2 genotype.},

Malnutrition should be assessed in case of IBD (in 20 - 70 % of Crohn's patients) and weight loss(> 5 % within 3 months) or nutritional deficiencies or after extensive bowel resection and afterwards also treated. Malnutrition should be treated with medical therapy of IBD and also adequate - as far as possible - with oral nutritional therapy particularly because of reduced life quality, risk of opportunistic infections, osteopenia/osteoporosis, longer hospitalisations and higher mortality. Iron homeostasis, serum levels of Vitamin B12- and folic acid, 25-hydroxyvitamin D and zinc should be checked. Therapy with enteral liquid diets is only indicated as therapy of first choice in children and adolescents, but only in rare situations in adults with IBD. There is - up to now - no proven oral diet for maintenance of remission in IBD. Probiotics as E. coli Nissle could be used as alternative to mesalazine for maintenance of remission in patients with ulcerative colitis. A specific dietary counselling is mandatory in patients with ileostoma or short bowel syndrome. Malnutrition of short bowel patients is particularly dependent on the function and length of the remaining bowel, therefore the most effective medical therapy should be administered.},

METHODS: Ten active UC (aUC), 10 inactive UC (iUC), 6 aCD, and 8 iCD patients and 10 healthy individuals were included in the study. Circulating Foxp3-, IDO-, IL-17A-, IL-4-, IFN- gamma -, and IL-10-expressing CD4(+) T cells were quantitated by flow cytometry. Interleukin-17-expressing cells, CD25(+)/Foxp3(+) Tregs, and CD123(+)/IDO(+) plasmacytoid dendritic cells were evaluated in intestinal biopsies from 10 aUC, 6 aCD, and 10 noninflamed tissues. RESULTS: All CD4(+) T subsets were increased in aIBD patients compared with healthy donors. Meanwhile, frequency of CD8 alpha (+)/CD16(+)/IDO(+), CD8 alpha (+)/CD56(+)/IDO(+), CD8 alpha (+)/CD80(+)/IDO(+), CD8 alpha (+)/CD123(+)/IDO(+) large granular nonlymphoid cells, and CCR6(+)/CD123(+)/IDO(+) plasmacytoid dendritic cells was higher in aIBD patients versus healthy donors or iIBD patients. Tissue IL-17A(+) cells were present in higher amounts in aIBD versus noninflamed controls. IDO- and Foxp3-expressing cells were increased in aUC versus aCD patients and noninflamed tissues. CONCLUSIONS: The findings represent an original work in Mexican Mestizo patients with IBD. It shows that Tregs and IDO-expressing cells are increased with regard to disease activity. These cells could significantly shape inflammatory bowel disease pathophysiology, severity, and tolerance loss.},

The aim of the present study was to evaluate concordance between parent and child ratings of health-related quality of life on the IMPACT-III questionnaire in children with IBD. METHODS: The IMPACT-III questionnaire was used to measure quality of life in 27 patients (mean age 14.2 +/- 3 years, 40% girls) and one of their parents (82% mothers). Most of the patients had inactive disease at the time of the study. Differences between parent-proxy ratings and child ratings on the IMPACT-III were compared via paired-samples t tests, intraclass correlation coefficients, and standardized difference scores. RESULTS: Parent-proxy and patient ratings were similar on total IMPACT-III and its related domains (bowel symptoms, systemic symptoms, social functioning, body image, treatment/interventions), except that significant differences on emotional functioning ratings were found (P = 0.003). Intraclass correlation coefficients showed medium-to-large effect sizes (range 0.52-0.88) and standardized difference scores showed varying degrees of bias depending on the domain measured (range -0.64 to 0.32). CONCLUSIONS: Parents served as a good proxy for quality-of-life ratings in this population of pediatric patients with IBD. The degree of concordance between parent and child scores, however, varied, as observed in the present study in which parents underreported their child's health-related quality of life on the IMPACT-III emotional functioning domain.},

   abstract = {BACKGROUND: Coping is an integral part of adjustment for patients with Inflammatory Bowel Disease but has not been well described in the literature. This study explored the relationship between coping, perceived health competence, patient preference for involvement in their treatment, depression and quality of life, particularly among patients with inactive disease (in remission). METHODS: Subjects (n=70) with active and inactive IBD completed questionnaires, including the Inflammatory Bowel Disease Quality of Life Questionnaire, Beck Depression Inventory, Perceived Health Competence Scale and the Coping Inventory for Stressful Situations. The Harvey Bradshaw Index measured disease activity. RESULTS: Patients with inactive IBD demonstrated significantly more interest in participating in their treatment (p<.05), more perceived health competence (p=.001), less depressive symptoms (p<.001), more task oriented coping (p=.02), and better quality of life than those with active disease. Only Task Oriented Coping was significantly negatively associated with the number of flares among inactive patients (p<.001). Patient preference for participation in treatment was inversely associated with Avoidance (p=.005), Distraction (p=.008), and Social Diversion (p=.008) coping among inactive patients. CONCLUSION: Among patients in remission, those who expressed a greater interest in treatment participation were also less likely to practice maladaptive coping. Our data demonstrate that a more active coping style may be associated with improved health outcome. Compared to patients with active disease, patients in remission are more likely to employ task oriented coping, demonstrate a higher interest in treatment participation, report greater perceived control of their health, and exhibit less depression symptoms. Our findings may increase awareness of the importance of identifying coping strategies for IBD patients, including those in remission.},

   abstract = {Nutritional concerns, linear growth deficiency, and delayed puberty are currently detected in up to 85% of patients with Crohn's disease (CD) diagnosed at childhood. To provide advice on how to assess and manage nutritional concerns in these patients, a Medline search was conducted using "pediatric inflammatory bowel disease", "pediatric Crohn's disease", "linear growth", "pubertal growth", "bone health", and "vitamin D" as key words. Clinical trials, systematic reviews, and meta-analyses published between 2008 and 2013 were selected to produce this narrative review. Studies referring to earlier periods were also considered if the data was relevant to our review. Although current treatment strategies for CD that include anti-tumor necrosis factor-alpha therapy have been shown to improve patients' growth rate, linear growth deficiencies are still common. In pediatric CD patients, prolonged diagnostic delay, high initial activity index, and stricturing/penetrating type of behavior may cause growth deficiencies (in weight and height) and delayed puberty, with several studies reporting that these patients may not reach an optimal bone mass. Glucocorticoids and inflammation inhibit bone formation, though their impact on skeletal modeling remains unclear. Long-term control of active inflammation and an adequate intake of nutrients are both fundamental in promoting normal puberty. Recent evidence suggests that recombinant growth factor therapy is effective in improving short-term linear growth in selected patients, but is of limited benefit for ameliorating mucosal disease and reducing clinical disease activity. The authors conclude that an intense initial treatment (taking a "top-down" approach, with the early introduction of immunomodulatory treatment) may be justified to induce and maintain remission so that the growth of children with CD can catch up, ideally before puberty. Exclusive enteral nutrition has a key role in inducing remission and improving patients' nutritional status.},

   abstract = {BACKGROUND AND AIM: Intestinal failure (IF) is a rare but devastating complication of Crohn's disease (CD). The clinical and surgical factors that predispose to IF are poorly understood. The aim of this study was to define clinical factors that predispose to IF. METHODS: A retrospective case-control study was performed using consecutive CD patients with IF who were identified from a prospective database. Local population-based controls were selected with which to compare demographic, phenotypic, and clinical outcomes. RESULTS: Eighty-two CD patients requiring long-term intravenous fluids or nutrition were studied. Diagnosis at age 16 years or less (P = 0.01) and a family history of inflammatory bowel disease (P = 0.02) were associated with a significantly higher risk for developing IF. Among the IF group, 53% had perioperative complications from intestinal resections contributing to long-term IF. Furthermore, these patients had more abdominal surgeries (P = 0.05) and stricturing disease was less common than in patients with primary active CD (P = 0.01). IF due to primary active CD was associated with penetrating behavior (P = 0.02) and early age at first surgery (P = 0.004). The need for intravenous nutrition as opposed to intravenous fluids correlated inversely with small intestine length (P < 0.001). CONCLUSIONS: CD resulting in IF relates to earlier age at diagnosis, family history of inflammatory bowel disease, stricturing disease, younger age at first surgery, and operative complications. These factors deserve consideration when planning therapy for CD patients.},

   abstract = {BACKGROUND: Anemia is poorly studied in pediatric inflammatory bowel disease. This study explored the epidemiology and associated factors of anemia at diagnosis, after 1 year, and during treatment with exclusive enteral nutrition (EEN). METHODS: Three cohorts were included: (1) a representative population of newly diagnosed inflammatory bowel disease children (n = 184); (2) patients currently receiving care with data available at diagnosis (n = 179) and after 1 year (n = 139); and (3) 84 children treated with EEN. RESULTS: At diagnosis, 72% were anemic. Abnormal inflammatory markers were more common in Crohn's disease with severe anemia (severe versus no anemia [%]: raised C-reactive protein; 89% versus 48%; suboptimal albumin; 97% versus 29%; P < 0.002). Anemic children with Crohn's disease had shorter diagnosis delay and lower BMI than nonanemic patients (severe versus mild versus no anemia, median [interquartile range]; diagnosis delay [months]: 3 [3.9] versus 6 [10] versus 8 [18], P < 0.001; BMI z score [SD]: -1.4 [1.4] versus -1.3 [1.5] versus -0.2 [1.4], P = 0.003). Extensive colitis was associated with severe anemia in ulcerative colitis. The proportion of severely anemic patients decreased from 34% to 9% and mild anemia doubled at 1 year. After EEN, severe anemia decreased (32% to 9%; P < 0.001) and the hemoglobin concentration increased by 0.75 g/dL. This was observed only after 8 weeks of treatment. Disease improvement and low hemoglobin at EEN initiation but not weight gain were associated with hemoglobin improvement. CONCLUSIONS: Anemia is high at diagnosis and follow-up and should receive more attention from the clinical team; however, the focus should remain suppression of inflammatory process in active disease.},

   abstract = {BACKGROUND: The gut microbiota is implicated in the pathogenesis of Crohn's disease (CD). Exclusive enteral nutrition (EEN) is a successful treatment, but its mode of action remains unknown. This study assessed serial changes in the fecal microbiota milieu during EEN. METHODS: Five fecal samples were collected from CD children: 4 during EEN (start, 15, 30, end EEN approximately 60 days) and the fifth on habitual diet. Two samples were collected from healthy control subjects. Fecal pH, bacterial metabolites, global microbial diversity abundance, composition stability, and quantitative changes of total and 7 major bacterial groups previously implicated in CD were measured. RESULTS: Overall, 68 samples were from 15 CD children and 40 from 21 control subjects. Fecal pH and total sulfide increased and butyric acid decreased during EEN (all P < 0.05). Global bacterial diversity abundance decreased (P < 0.05); a higher degree of microbiota composition stability was seen in control subjects than in CD children during EEN (at P </= 0.008). Faecalibacterium prausnitzii spp concentration significantly decreased after 30 days on EEN (P < 0.05). In patients who responded to EEN, the magnitude of the observed changes was greater and the concentration of Bacteroides/Prevotella group decreased (P < 0.05). All these changes reverted to pretreatment levels on free diet, and EEN microbiota diversity increased when the children returned to their free diet. CONCLUSIONS: EEN impacts on gut microbiota composition and changes fecal metabolic activity. It is difficult to infer a causative association between such changes and disease improvement, but the results do challenge the current perception of a protective role for F. prausnitzii in CD.},

   abstract = {IMPORTANCE: Because of the severity of disease and additional surgery, Crohn disease (CD) may result in intestinal failure (IF) and dependency on home parenteral nutrition (HPN). Defining the indication and timing for intestinal transplantation (ITx) is challenging. OBJECTIVES: To determine the limitations of conventional surgery and to facilitate the decision making for transplantation. DESIGN, SETTING, AND PARTICIPANTS: Data were collected prospectively and obtained by retrospective review of medical records from all patients with CD who were assessed for ITx in Oxford, United Kingdom, and Berlin, Germany, from October 10, 2003, through July 31, 2013. Patients were considered suitable for ITx if a diagnosis of irreversible IF was established and life-threatening complications under HPN were unresolvable. Twenty patients with CD and IF, established on HPN, were evaluated for ITx. The mean (SD) age at CD onset was 17.8 (9.8) years. On first diagnosis, most patients had a stricturing CD. By the time of referral, most had a combination of stricturing and fistulizing disease. INTERVENTIONS: New scoring system: a modification of the American Gastroenterology Association guidelines for ITx. Modifications are related to CD-specific issues that potentially lead to a poorer outcome and are based on the findings of the study to determine the expected benefit from ITx. MAIN OUTCOMES AND MEASURES: A scoring system that would alert the physician to the severity of the patient's CD and trigger early referral for ITx. This system may translate into better long-term outcomes for patients with CD. In addition, the Karnofsky performance status score was used to compare pretransplantation and posttransplantation outcomes. RESULTS: Ten patients underwent ITx, 4 were on the waiting list, and 4 were unavailable for follow-up. One patient was taken off the waiting list because of severe deterioration. One patient underwent conventional stricturoplasty and did not need transplantation. Among the transplant recipients, 17 (85%) had a stoma or enterocutaneous fistula, and the mean (SD) residual bowel length was 71.5 (38) cm. A total of 80% of transplant recipients had life-threatening catheter infections, and 13 (65%) had a significant decrease in the estimated glomerular filtration rate. At a mean (SD) follow-up of 27.6 (36.1) months for transplant recipients, the patient and graft survival is 80%, and their Karnofsky performance status score increased by a mean of 18.6%. CONCLUSIONS AND RELEVANCE: Intestinal transplantation is a suitable treatment option for patients with CD and IF. It should be considered before any additional attempts at conventional surgery, which may cause eligible patients to miss this opportunity through perioperative complications. The suggested scoring system enables the physician to identify patients who may benefit from transplantation before HPN-associated secondary organ failure.},

   abstract = {Inflammatory bowel diseases (IBDs), including Crohn's disease (CD), are genetically linked to host pathways that implicate an underlying role for aberrant immune responses to intestinal microbiota. However, patterns of gut microbiome dysbiosis in IBD patients are inconsistent among published studies. Using samples from multiple gastrointestinal locations collected prior to treatment in new-onset cases, we studied the microbiome in the largest pediatric CD cohort to date. An axis defined by an increased abundance in bacteria which include Enterobacteriaceae, Pasteurellacaea, Veillonellaceae, and Fusobacteriaceae, and decreased abundance in Erysipelotrichales, Bacteroidales, and Clostridiales, correlates strongly with disease status. Microbiome comparison between CD patients with and without antibiotic exposure indicates that antibiotic use amplifies the microbial dysbiosis associated with CD. Comparing the microbial signatures between the ileum, the rectum, and fecal samples indicates that at this early stage of disease, assessing the rectal mucosal-associated microbiome offers unique potential for convenient and early diagnosis of CD.},

   abstract = {The epithelium of the gastrointestinal tract is one of the most versatile tissues in the organism, responsible for providing a tight barrier between dietary and bacterial antigens and the mucosal and systemic immune system while maintaining efficient digestive and absorptive processes to ensure adequate nutrient and energy supply. Inflammatory bowel diseases (Crohn's disease and ulcerative colitis) are associated with a breakdown of both functions, which in some cases are clearly interrelated. In this updated literature review, we focus on the effects of intestinal inflammation and the associated immune mediators on selected aspects of the transepithelial transport of macronutrients and micronutrients. The mechanisms responsible for nutritional deficiencies are not always clear and could be related to decreased intake, malabsorption, and excess losses. We summarize the known causes of nutrient deficiencies and the mechanism of inflammatory bowel disease-associated diarrhea. We also overview the consequences of impaired epithelial transport, which infrequently transcend its primary purpose to affect the gut microbial ecology and epithelial integrity. Although some of those regulatory mechanisms are relatively well established, more work needs to be done to determine how inflammatory cytokines can alter the transport process of nutrients across the gastrointestinal and renal epithelia.},

   abstract = {Inflammatory bowel disease (IBD) with its two distinct entities, Crohn's disease and ulcerative colitis, and Type 1 diabetes mellitus (T1D) are autoimmune diseases. The prevalence of these diseases continues to rapidly rise in the industrialized world. Despite the identification of several genetic loci that are associated with both IBD and T1D, thus far, there is a paucity of epidemiological data to support a clinical overlap. In an effort to better understand the underlying pathogenic mechanisms of both IBD and T1D, this review summarizes the literature about these related autoimmune diseases, describes the most recent advances in their etiopathogenesis and emphasizes the genetic and nongenetic factors that exercise a differential influence. Genome-wide association studies have identified genetic loci with a role in immune response regulation that are linked to both IBD (particularly Crohn's disease) and T1D. Some of these genetic loci (e.g., IL-18RAP) have a divergent role, conferring risk for one disease and protection for the other. Recent evidence highlights an important role of gut microbiota and cellular responses (e.g., endoplasmic reticulum stress) in the pathogenesis of both IBD and T1D.},

   abstract = {Vitamin D deficiency, diagnosed when the serum 25-hydroxyvitamin D (25-OHD(3)) concentration is less than 20 ng/mL, has joined vitamin A deficiency as two of the most common nutrition-responsive medical conditions worldwide. There have been more scientific articles published about vitamin D in the 21st century than about any other vitamin, reflecting the massive expansion of the field of vitamin D research. Adequate vitamin D status has been linked to decreased risks of developing specific cancers, including cancers of the esophagus, stomach, colon, rectum, gallbladder, pancreas, lung, breast, uterus, ovary, prostate, urinary bladder, kidney, skin, thyroid, and hematopoietic system (e.g., Hodgkin's lymphoma, non-Hodgkin's lymphoma, multiple myeloma); bacterial infections; rheumatoid arthritis; Crohn's disease; periodontal disease; multiple sclerosis; asthma; type 2 diabetes; cardiovascular disease; stroke; peripheral artery disease; hypertension; chronic kidney disease; muscle weakness; cognitive impairment; Alzheimer's disease; clinical depression; and premature death. On the other hand, inadequate vitamin D status during human pregnancy may be associated with increased risk for the development of type 1 diabetes in the offspring. However, this point of view may be excessively optimistic. There also is evidence that despite the current heavy reliance on serum 25-OHD(3) concentration for the diagnosis of an individual's vitamin D status, local tissue vitamin D intoxication may be present in individuals with much lower serum 25-OHD(3) concentrations than are currently appreciated. Only rarely are the symptoms of local tissue vitamin D intoxication associated with vitamin D status or intake. An individual's serum 25-OHD(3) concentration may appear to be "low" for reasons totally independent of sunlight exposure or vitamin D intake. Serum 25-OHD(3) concentration is only poorly responsive to increases in vitamin D intake, and the prolonged routine consumption of thousands of international units of vitamin D may interfere with the regulation of phosphate homeostasis by fibroblast growth factor-23 (FGF23) and the Klotho gene product, with consequences that are detrimental to human health. In light of these counterbalancing observations, curbing excessive enthusiasm for universally increasing vitamin D intake recommendations may be in order.},

   abstract = {BACKGROUND: There is controversy about nutrition status and calorie needs during phases of active versus inactive adult Crohn's disease (CD). Results have been reported in cross-sectional studies, but longitudinal data are unavailable. Our aim was to explore whether disease activity had an impact on resting energy expenditure (REE) and body composition in adult patients with CD. MATERIALS AND METHODS: Adult patients were studied on 2 occasions with active and inactive CD. REE was measured by indirect calorimetry. Body composition was estimated from bioelectrical impedance analysis. Disease activity was measured using the Crohn's Disease Activity Index (CDAI). Regression analyses of REE with CDAI score, C-reactive protein, and erythrocyte sedimentation rate were also performed. RESULTS: Seventy-five patients were included. Patients with active CD had increased REE/body weight compared with patients with inactive disease (28.8 +/- 5.4 vs 25.9 +/- 4.3 kcal/kg, P < .001). Disease behavior and location, but not sex, had an impact on REE/body weight. Body mass index was lower in active disease than in remission (17.4 +/- 3.0 vs 18.1 +/- 2.6 kg/m(2), P = .010). Body composition was not affected by disease behavior or location. CONCLUSION: Patients with remission had a better nutrition status and decreased REE compared with those with active CD. REE could also be affected by disease location and behavior.},

   abstract = {Abnormalities of transmembrane and cytoplasmic proteins of tight junctions (TJ) have been implicated in pathogenesis of both celiac (CeD) and Crohn's diseases (CD). Since disease pathogenesis in CeD and CD are different, we planned to study if there is any differential expression pattern of TJ marker proteins and ultrastructural changes, respectively, in duodenal villi vs crypts. Endoscopic duodenal biopsies from treatment naive patients with CeD (n = 24), active CD (n = 28), and functional dyspepsia (as controls, n = 15), both at baseline and 6 months after treatment, were subjected to light microscopic analysis (modified Marsh grading); immune-histochemical staining and Western blot analysis to see the expression of key TJ proteins [trans-membrane proteins (claudin-2, claudin-3, claudin-4, occludin, and JAM) and cytoplasmic protein (ZO-1)]. Transmission electron microscopy and image analysis of the TJs were also performed. There was significant overexpression of claudin-2 (pore-forming) and occludin (protein maintaining cell polarity) with under-expression of claudin-3 and claudin-4 (pore-sealing proteins) in treatment naive CeD and active CD with simultaneous alteration in ultrastructure of TJs such as loss of penta-laminar structure and TJ dilatation. Normalization of some of these TJ proteins was noted 6 months after treatment. These changes were not disease specific and were not different in duodenal villi and crypts. Overexpression of pore-forming and under-expression of pore-sealing TJ proteins lead to dilatation of TJ. These changes are neither disease specific nor site specific and the end result of mucosal inflammation.},

   abstract = {Total parenteral nutrition (TPN) is currently the treatment of choice for patients with intestinal failure. Intestinal failure in adults is mostly due to short bowel syndrome, which is most often caused by ischemia and Crohn's disease. However, TPN fails in a substantial number of cases. For patients with TPN failure, intestinal transplantation (ITx) may be offered as a treatment. TPN failure is considered to be present either if nutrition itself is not possible or if complications of TPN occur. These complications can, for example, originate from recurrent line infections or thrombosis. As TPN is usually a lifelong therapy and is associated with substantial impairment of the quality of life, the tolerance of each patient to this procedure is another important consideration in the decision making about whether to perform transplantation. The survival rates of intestinal transplant recipients have now reached the same level as that of recipients of other solid organ transplants. A five-yr survival of up to 80% has been reported in specialized centers, whereas registry data show rates of <80%. Although in about one-third of patients, isolated ITx is sufficient, patients with concurrent liver disease (mostly due to TPN) benefit from combined intestinal and liver transplantation. In some cases, multivisceral transplantation is necessary. Here, we review the current indications for ITx with a special focus on TPN.},

   abstract = {BACKGROUND: Inflammatory bowel disease-associated liver diseases (IBD-LDs) include autoimmune hepatitis (AIH), primary sclerosing cholangitis (PSC), and an overlap syndrome. Prospective unbiased multicenter data regarding the frequency of IBD-LD in patients with pediatric inflammatory bowel disease (IBD) are lacking. We examined early alanine aminotransferase (ALT) and gamma-glutamyl transpeptidase (GGT) elevations in children diagnosed as having IBD and assessed the likelihood of IBD-LD. METHODS: Data collected from the prospective observational Pediatric Inflammatory Bowel Disease Collaborative Research Group Registry enrolling children of age <16 years within 30 days of diagnosis. AIH, PSC, and overlap syndrome were diagnosed using local institutional criteria. RESULTS: A total of 1569 subjects had liver enzymes available. Of the total, 757 had both ALT and GGT, 800 had ALT only (no GGT), and 12 had GGT only (no ALT). Overall, 29 of 1569 patients (1.8%) had IBD-LD. IBD-LD was diagnosed in 1 of 661 (0.15%) of patients with both ALT and GGT </= 50 IU/L compared with 21 of 42 (50%) of patients with both ALT and GGT > 50 (odds ratio 660, P < 0.0001). Of the 29 patients with IBD-LD, 21 had PSC, 2 had AIH, and 6 had overlap syndrome. IBD-LD was more common in patients with ulcerative colitis and IBD-unclassified (indeterminate colitis) than in those with Crohn disease (4% vs 0.8%, respectively, P < 0.001). CONCLUSIONS: Elevation of both ALT and GGT within 90 days after the diagnosis of IBD is associated with a markedly increased likelihood of IBD-LD. Both ALT and GGT levels should be measured in all of the pediatric patients newly diagnosed as having IBD.},

   abstract = {The human gut is a unique organ in which hundreds of different microbial species find their habitat and in which different host physiologic functions, such as digestion, nutrition, and immunity, coexist. Although all these players were studied separately for decades, recently, there has been an explosion of studies demonstrating the essential role for interactions between these components in gut function. Furthermore, new systems biology methods provide essential tools to study this complex system as a whole and to identify key elements that define the crosstalk between the gut microbiota, immunity, and metabolism. This review is devoted to several human diseases resulting from the disruption in this crosstalk, including immunodeficiency-associated and environmental enteropathies, celiac disease, inflammatory bowel disease, and obesity. We describe findings in experimental models of these diseases and in germ-free animals that help us understand the mechanisms and test new therapeutic strategies. We also discuss current challenges that the field is facing and propose that a new generation of antibiotics, prebiotics, and probiotics coupled with novel, systems biology-driven diagnostics will provide the basis for future personalized therapy.},

In the presence of a compatible clinical presentation, diagnosis is by convention confirmed by a combination of imaging, serologic, endoscopic and histologic investigations. This diagnostic recommendation should be maintained, even though histology is often 'compatible with' rather than 'diagnostic of' suspected CD. The importance of histology varies depending on the specific sites of macroscopic disease. Histology is particularly important in distinguishing type of inflammatory bowel disease, when the colon predominantly is involved, and in confirming CD when macroscopic disease is atypically located.},

   abstract = {BACKGROUND AND AIMS: Exclusive enteral nutrition (EEN) induces clinical and mucosal healing (MH) in Crohn's disease (CD), with MH the best determinant of future outcome. We investigated efficacy of EEN for inducing early clinical, biochemical, mucosal and transmural remission of CD and related early endoscopic response to outcomes at 1 year. METHODS: In a prospective, open label study 34 children (mean 13.1 years; 21 males) with new diagnosis CD were offered EEN, 26 completed a minimum 6 weeks EEN and underwent paired clinical, biochemical and endoscopic assessment at start and completion using PCDAI, BMI, CRP and Simple Endoscopic Score for CD (SES-CD). A subset, 16/26, had paired MR enterography scored. Early good endoscopic response (complete MH, or near complete, SES-CD 0-3) was related to outcome at 1 year. RESULTS: EEN improved mean PCDAI (37.88-7.01, p < 0.001; BMI Z scores (-1.54 to -0.54, p < 0.01); weight Z score (-0.79 to -0.08, p < 0.03); CRP (44.86-5.5, p < 0.001); endoscopy (SES-CD 14.28-3.88, p < 0.001) and MRE (5.14-2.79, p = 0.01). Of 26 children, 22 (84 %) achieved clinical remission; 20 (76 %) biochemical remission. Fifteen (58 %) had early good endoscopic response (11 complete, 4 near complete MH) and 3/14 (21 %) had complete transmural remission of ileal CD (MRE-CD: 0-1). Early good endoscopic response was associated with reduced endoscopic confirmed relapse (53 vs. 100 %, p = 0.02), anti-TNF use (33 vs. 88 %, p = 0.01) and hospitalisation (40 vs. 88 %) at 1 year. CONCLUSIONS: EEN is effective for inducing early clinical, biochemical, mucosal and transmural remission. Early endoscopic remission improves outcomes at 1 year.},

   abstract = {BACKGROUND: Obesity has been associated with a more severe disease course in inflammatory bowel disease (IBD) and epidemiological data identified dietary fats but not obesity as risk factors for the development of IBD. Crohn's disease is one of the two major IBD phenotypes and mostly affects the terminal ileum. Despite recent observations that high fat diets (HFD) impair intestinal barrier functions and drive pathobiont selection relevant for chronic inflammation in the colon, mechanisms of high fat diets in the pathogenesis of Crohn's disease are not known. The aim of this study was to characterize the effect of HFD on the development of chronic ileal inflammation in a murine model of Crohn's disease-like ileitis. METHODS: TNF(DeltaARE/WT) mice and wildtype C57BL/6 littermates were fed a HFD compared to control diet for different durations. Intestinal pathology and metabolic parameters (glucose tolerance, mesenteric tissue characteristics) were assessed. Intestinal barrier integrity was characterized at different levels including polyethylene glycol (PEG) translocation, endotoxin in portal vein plasma and cellular markers of barrier function. Inflammatory activation of epithelial cells as well as immune cell infiltration into ileal tissue were determined and related to luminal factors. RESULTS: HFD aggravated ileal inflammation but did not induce significant overweight or typical metabolic disorders in TNF(DeltaARE/WT). Expression of the tight junction protein Occludin was markedly reduced in the ileal epithelium of HFD mice independently of inflammation, and translocation of endotoxin was increased. Epithelial cells showed enhanced expression of inflammation-related activation markers, along with enhanced luminal factors-driven recruitment of dendritic cells and Th17-biased lymphocyte infiltration into the lamina propria. CONCLUSIONS: HFD feeding, independently of obesity, accelerated disease onset of small intestinal inflammation in Crohn's disease-relevant mouse model through mechanisms that involve increased intestinal permeability and altered luminal factors, leading to enhanced dendritic cell recruitment and promoted Th17 immune responses.},

   abstract = {BACKGROUND: 25(OH) vitamin D levels may be low in patients with moderately or severely active inflammatory bowel diseases (IBD: Crohn's disease and Idiopathic Ulcerative Colitis) but this is less clear in patients with mild or inactive IBD. Furthermore there is limited information of any family influence on 25(OH) vitamin D levels in IBD. As a possible risk factor we hypothesize that vitamin D levels may also be low in families of IBD patients. OBJECTIVES: To evaluate 25[OH] vitamin D levels in patients with IBD in remission or with mild activity. A second objective is to evaluate whether there are relationships within IBD family units of 25[OH] vitamin D and what are the influences associated with these levels. METHODS: Participants underwent medical history, physical examination and a 114 item diet questionnaire. Serum 25[OH] vitamin D was measured, using a radioimmunoassay kit, (replete >/= 75, insufficient 50-74, deficient < 25-50, or severely deficient < 25 nmol/L). Associations between 25[OH] vitamin D and twenty variables were evaluated using univariate regression. Multivariable analysis was also applied and intrafamilial dynamics were assessed. RESULTS: 55 patients and 48 controls with their respective families participated (N206). 25[OH] vitamin D levels between patients and controls were similar (71.2 +/- 32.8 vs. 68.3 +/-26.2 nmol/L). Vitamin D supplements significantly increased intake but correlation with serum 25[OH] vitamin D was significant only during non sunny months among patients. Within family units, patients' families had mean replete levels (82.3 +/- 34.2 nmol/L) and a modest correlation emerged during sunny months between patients and family (r2 =0.209 p = 0.032). These relationships were less robust and non significant in controls and their families. CONCLUSIONS: In patients with mild or inactive IBD 25[OH] vitamin D levels are less than ideal but are similar to controls. Taken together collectively, the results of this study suggest that patient family dynamics may be different in IBD units from that in control family units. However contrary to the hypothesis, intra familial vitamin D dynamics do not pose additional risks for development of IBD.},

   abstract = {Treatment options for irritable bowel syndrome (IBS) and inflammatory bowel disease (IBD) are notoriously either inadequate (IBS) or loaded with potentially serious side effects and risks (IBD). In recent years, a growing interest in effective and safer alternatives has focused on the potential role of probiotics and their metabolic substrates, prebiotics. It is in fact conceivable that the microbiome might be targeted by providing the metabolic fuel needed for the growth and expansion of beneficial microorganisms (prebiotics) or by administering to the host such microorganisms (probiotics). This review presents a concise update on currently available data, with a special emphasis on children. Data for prebiotics in IBS are scarce. Low doses have shown a beneficial effect, while high doses are counterproductive. On the contrary, several controlled trials of probiotics have yielded encouraging results. A meta-analysis including nine randomized clinical trials in children showed an improvement in abdominal pain for Lactobacillus GG, Lactobacillus reuteri DSM 17938, and the probiotic mixture VSL#3. The patients most benefiting from probiotics were those with predominant diarrhea or with a post-infectious IBS. In IBD, the use of prebiotics has been tested only rarely and in small scale clinical trials, with mixed results. As for probiotics, data in humans from about three dozens clinical trials offer mixed outcomes. So far, none of the tested probiotics has proven successful in Crohn's disease, while in ulcerative colitis a recent meta-analysis on 12 clinical trials (1 of them in children) showed efficacy for the probiotic mixture VSL#3 in contributing to induce and to maintain remission. It is evident that this is a rapidly evolving and promising field; more data are very likely to yield a better understanding on what strains should be used in different specific clinical settings and in what doses.},

   abstract = {Intestinal epithelial cells (IEC) are organised as a single cell layer which covers the intestine. Their primary task is to absorb nutrients present in the intestinal lumen. However, IEC also play an important role in the immune defence of our body by building a barrier that separates the bowel wall from potentially hazardous bacteria present in the gut lumen. The life cycle of IEC is determined by the time span in which cells migrate from their place of origin at the crypt base to the villus tip, from where they are shed into the lumen. Cell death in the intestinal epithelium has to be tightly regulated and irregularities might cause pathologies. Excessive cell death has been associated with chronic inflammation as seen in patients with Crohn's disease and ulcerative colitis. While until recently apoptosis was discussed as being essential for epithelial turnover and tissue homeostasis in the intestinal epithelium, recent data using gene deficient mice have challenged this concept. Moreover, an apoptosis-independent mode of programmed cell death, termed necroptosis, has been identified and described in the intestinal epithelium. The following article reviews previous studies on cell death regulation in IEC and a potential role of necroptosis for gut homeostasis.},

   abstract = {BACKGROUND: Exclusive enteral nutrition (EEN) is an effective and safe remission induction treatment for Crohn's disease in adults. Its influence on adults' health-related quality of life remains unknown. The aim of this study was to determine the effect of EEN on health-related quality of life in adults with active Crohn's disease. MATERIALS AND METHODS: Patients recruited were treated with a polymeric enteral feed that was taken orally in the daytime and via a self-intubated nasogastric tube at night for 4 weeks. Prospective evaluation of disease activity (Crohn's Disease Activity Index, CDAI) and health-related quality of life (Inflammatory Bowel Disease Questionnaire, IBDQ) were performed at enrollment and after 4 weeks of treatment. Patients' feelings about EEN were also investigated through 2 questions. RESULTS: Thirteen patients were treated with 4-week EEN. They had a significant improvement in total IBDQ score (P < .001) and all IBDQ dimensions: bowel symptoms (P < .001), systemic symptoms (P < .001), social function (P = .003), and emotional status (P < .001), with 11 patients (84.6%) achieving clinical remission after treatment. In addition, 8 patients (61.5%) expressed their willingness to receive this 4-week EEN treatment again to induce remission if the disease relapsed. The IBDQ correlated significantly with the CDAI at 4 weeks. CONCLUSIONS: A 4-week treatment of EEN improves health-related quality of life significantly in adults with active Crohn's disease and was acceptable by most patients.},

   abstract = {BACKGROUND: Enteral nutritional therapy (EN) is an effective modality for inducing and maintaining remission in pediatric patients with Crohn's disease (CD). The standard protocol for EN provides patients with 100% of their caloric needs for induction of remission. The aim of this study was to determine the efficacy of delivering 80% to 90% of patient's caloric needs through EN, to induce remission in pediatric patients with CD. This approach allows patients to consume remaining calories from a normal diet. METHODS: A retrospective review of charts from 1998 to 2010 was conducted at The Children's Hospital of Philadelphia. Remission (Pediatric Crohn's Disease Activity Index <10) and response (decrease in Pediatric Crohn's Disease Activity Index score of >/=12.5 points) were calculated before and after treatment with EN. Weight z scores and laboratory parameters were evaluated in all participants. RESULTS: Forty-three charts were evaluated. Mean age of participants was 12.8 years (5.1-17.4), 67% were male and 33% female patients. Remission and response were evaluated in a group of 23 participants, with no missing data. There were reductions in erythrocyte sedimentation rate (P < 0.0001) and C-reactive protein (P < 0.02), and increases in albumin (P < 0.03). Mean Pediatric Crohn's Disease Activity Index score at baseline was 26.9 and was reduced to a score of 10.2 at follow-up (P < 0.0001). Induction of remission was achieved in 65% and response in 87% at a mean follow-up of 2 months (1-4 months). CONCLUSIONS: This novel EN protocol seems to be effective for the induction of remission in pediatric patients with CD and contributes to increasing weight and improving laboratory markers. This protocol may result in improved EN acceptance and compliance and will be evaluated prospectively.},

   abstract = {Extensive research over the past half century has shown that curcumin (diferuloylmethane), a component of the golden spice turmeric (Curcuma longa), can modulate multiple cell signaling pathways. Extensive clinical trials over the past quarter century have addressed the pharmacokinetics, safety, and efficacy of this nutraceutical against numerous diseases in humans. Some promising effects have been observed in patients with various pro-inflammatory diseases including cancer, cardiovascular disease, arthritis, uveitis, ulcerative proctitis, Crohn's disease, ulcerative colitis, irritable bowel disease, tropical pancreatitis, peptic ulcer, gastric ulcer, idiopathic orbital inflammatory pseudotumor, oral lichen planus, gastric inflammation, vitiligo, psoriasis, acute coronary syndrome, atherosclerosis, diabetes, diabetic nephropathy, diabetic microangiopathy, lupus nephritis, renal conditions, acquired immunodeficiency syndrome, beta-thalassemia, biliary dyskinesia, Dejerine-Sottas disease, cholecystitis, and chronic bacterial prostatitis. Curcumin has also shown protection against hepatic conditions, chronic arsenic exposure, and alcohol intoxication. Dose-escalating studies have indicated the safety of curcumin at doses as high as 12 g/day over 3 months. Curcumin's pleiotropic activities emanate from its ability to modulate numerous signaling molecules such as pro-inflammatory cytokines, apoptotic proteins, NF-kappaB, cyclooxygenase-2, 5-LOX, STAT3, C-reactive protein, prostaglandin E(2), prostate-specific antigen, adhesion molecules, phosphorylase kinase, transforming growth factor-beta, triglyceride, ET-1, creatinine, HO-1, AST, and ALT in human participants. In clinical trials, curcumin has been used either alone or in combination with other agents. Various formulations of curcumin, including nanoparticles, liposomal encapsulation, emulsions, capsules, tablets, and powder, have been examined. In this review, we discuss in detail the various human diseases in which the effect of curcumin has been investigated.},

   abstract = {OBJECTIVES: Questionnaires exist to assess inflammatory bowel disease (IBD)-related knowledge of adults. Owing to wording and content concerns, these were believed to be inappropriate for use in pediatric patients. The aim of this study was to develop a questionnaire to assess disease-related knowledge of pediatric patients with IBD and their parents. METHODS: Following a formal process of item generation and reduction, the IBD-Knowledge Inventory Device was developed and pilot tested. It was administered to 10- to 17-year-old patients with IBD, and to 1 of each of their parents. To evaluate its discriminatory validity, pediatric residents, nurses, and ward clerks completed the questionnaire. RESULTS: A total of 99 patients (mean 42, Crohn disease 46, age 14(+/-2) years) and 99 parents completed the IBD-Knowledge Inventory Device. Parent knowledge scores, 15(+/-4), were higher than those of patients, 11(+/-4), P < 0.001. Patient and parent knowledge scores were strongly correlated (r = 0.62, P < 0.001). Patient knowledge score was significantly related to disease type (Crohn disease scored higher than ulcerative colitis, P = 0.004) and to perceived knowledge level (P < 0.001) by regression analysis. Similarly, parent knowledge score was significantly related to sex (girls scored higher, P = 0.014), postsecondary education (P < 0.001), and perceived knowledge level (P = 0.002). The questionnaire scores of 23 were 19, 16, and 10, respectively, for residents, nurses, and ward clerks. Both residents and nurses scored significantly higher than ward clerks (P = 0.001 for both). CONCLUSIONS: A valid IBD-related knowledge assessment questionnaire was developed for use in older children and adolescents with IBD and their parents.},

Although HTST treatment leads to inactivation of at least 5 log10 cycles, it might become necessary to enhance the efficacy of HTST by additional treatments such as homogenization if the debate about the role of MAP in Crohn's disease of humans concludes that MAP is a zoonotic agent. This study aimed to determine whether disrupting the clumps of MAP in milk by homogenization during the heat treatment process would enhance the inactivation of MAP. We used HTST pasteurization in a continuous-flow pilot-plant pasteurizer and evaluated the effect of upstream, downstream, and in-hold homogenization on inactivation of MAP. Reduction of MAP at 72 degrees C with a holding time of 28s was between 3.7 and 6.9 log10 cycles, with an overall mean of 5.5 log10 cycles. None of the 3 homogenization modes applied showed a statistically significant additional effect on the inactivation of MAP during HTST treatment.},

   abstract = {The role of Mycobacterium avium subsp. paratuberculosis (MAP) in Crohn's disease in humans has been debated for many years. Milk and milk products have been suggested as possible vectors for transmission since the beginning of this debate, whereas recent publications show that slaughtered cattle and their carcasses, meat, and organs can also serve as reservoirs for MAP transmission. The objective of this study was to generate heat-inactivation data for MAP during the cooking of hamburger patties. Hamburger patties of lean ground beef weighing 70 and 50 g were cooked for 6, 5, 4, 3, and 2 min, which were sterilized by irradiation and spiked with three different MAP strains at levels between 10(2) and 10(6) CFU/ml. Single-sided cooking with one flip was applied, and the temperatures within the patties were recorded by seven thermocouples. Counting of the surviving bacteria was performed by direct plating onto Herrold's egg yolk medium and a three-vial most-probable-number method by using modified Dubos medium. There was considerable variability in temperature throughout the patties during frying. In addition, the log reduction in MAP numbers showed strong variations. In patties weighing 70 g, considerable bacterial reduction of 4 log or larger could only be achieved after 6 min of cooking. For all other cooking times, the bacterial reduction was less than 2 log. Patties weighing 50 g showed a 5-log or larger reduction after cooking times of 5 and 6 min. To determine the inactivation kinetics, a log-linear regression model was used, showing a constant decrease of MAP numbers over cooking time.},

Consequently, chronic gastrointestinal diseases commonly result in malnutrition and increased morbidity and mortality. Chronic malnutrition impairs digestive and absorptive function. Parenteral and enteral nutritions are effective therapeutic modalities in several diseases. In cases of gastrointestinal malfunctions, nutrition has a direct therapeutic role. The benefit of nutrition therapy is similar to medical treatment in patients with pancreatitis, Crohn disease, hepatic failure, and in those with gastrointestinal fistulas. Nutrition has both supportive and therapeutic roles in the management of chronic gastrointestinal diseases. With the development of modern techniques of nutritional support, the morbidity and mortality associated with chronic gastrointestinal diseases can be reduced.},

   abstract = {Inflammatory bowel diseases (IBD) are emerging globally, indicating that environmental factors may be important in their pathogenesis. Colonic mucosal epigenetic changes, such as DNA methylation, can occur in response to the environment and have been implicated in IBD pathology. However, mucosal DNA methylation has not been examined in treatment-naive patients. We studied DNA methylation in untreated, left sided colonic biopsy specimens using the Infinium HumanMethylation450 BeadChip array. We analyzed 22 control (C) patients, 15 untreated Crohn's disease (CD) patients, and 9 untreated ulcerative colitis (UC) patients from two cohorts. Samples obtained at the time of clinical remission from two of the treatment-naive UC patients were also included into the analysis. UC-specific gene expression was interrogated in a subset of adjacent samples (5 C and 5 UC) using the Affymetrix GeneChip PrimeView Human Gene Expression Arrays. Only treatment-naive UC separated from control. One-hundred-and-twenty genes with significant expression change in UC (> 2-fold, P<0.05) were associated with differentially methylated regions (DMRs). Epigenetically associated gene expression changes (including gene expression changes in the IFITM1, ITGB2, S100A9, SLPI, SAA1, and STAT3 genes) were linked to colonic mucosal immune and defense responses. These findings underscore the relationship between epigenetic changes and inflammation in pediatric treatment-naive UC and may have potential etiologic, diagnostic, and therapeutic relevance for IBD.},

   abstract = {Inflammatory bowel diseases (IBD) including ulcerative colitis (UC) and Crohn's disease (CD) are chronic relapsing inflammatory disorders of the gastrointestinal tract. The interaction between a disturbed microbial composition, the intestinal mucosal barrier and the mucosal immune system plays an important role in IBD and its chronicity. It has been indicated that due to the altered microbial composition the balance between T regulatory cells (Treg) and T helper cells (Th) 17 is disturbed, leading to an inflammatory state. The present study shows that oral intake of a specific multi fibre mix (MF), designed to match the fibre content of a healthy diet, counteracts IBD-like intestinal inflammation and weight loss in dextran sodium sulphate treated mice. This reduction in inflammation might be brought about, at least in part, by the MF-induced decrease in inflammatory cytokines, increase in IL-10 and the relative increase in Treg cells in the mesenteric lymph nodes (MLN). Moreover, the Treg percentage in the MLN correlates with the percentage of tolerogenic lamina propria derived CD103+RALDH+dendritic cells in the MLN, suggesting that these play a role in the observed effects. In children with CD exclusive enteral nutrition (EEN) is a widely used safe and effective therapy. Optimizing enteral nutritional concepts with the tested fibre mix, know to modulate the gut microbiota composition, SCFA production and inflammatory status (as indicated by the present study) could possibly further improve efficacy in inducing remission.},

Sixty percent of Crohn's disease patients have sarcopenia. However some inflammatory bowel disease (IBD) patients are obese or suffer from sarcopenic-obesity. IBD patients have many vitamin and nutrient deficiencies, which can lead to important consequences such as hyperhomocysteinemia, which is associated with a higher risk of thromboembolic disease. Nutritional deficiencies in IBD patients are the result of insufficient intake, malabsorption and protein-losing enteropathy as well as metabolic disturbances directly induced by the chronic disease and its treatments, in particular corticosteroids. Screening for nutritional deficiencies in chronic disease patients is warranted. Managing the deficiencies involves simple nutritional guidelines, vitamin supplements, and nutritional support in the worst cases.},

   abstract = {OBJECTIVE: Crohn's disease (CD) is associated with intestinal dysbiosis, altered blood T cell populations, elevated faecal calprotectin (FC) and increased intestinal permeability (IP). CD-associated features present in siblings (increased risk of CD) but not in healthy controls, provide insight into early CD pathogenesis. We aimed to (1) Delineate the genetic, immune and microbiological profile of patients with CD, their siblings and controls and (2) Determine which factors discriminate between groups. DESIGN: Faecal microbiology was analysed by quantitative PCR targeting 16S ribosomal RNA, FC by ELISA, blood T cell phenotype by flow cytometry and IP by differential lactulose-rhamnose absorption in 22 patients with inactive CD, 21 of their healthy siblings and 25 controls. Subject's genotype relative risk was determined by Illumina Immuno BeadChip. RESULTS: Strikingly, siblings shared aspects of intestinal dysbiosis with patients with CD (lower concentrations of Faecalibacterium prausnitzii (p=0.048), Clostridia cluster IV (p=0.003) and Roseburia spp. (p=0.09) compared with controls). As in CD, siblings demonstrated a predominance of memory T cells (p=0.002) and elevated naive CD4 T cell beta7 integrin expression (p=0.01) compared with controls. FC was elevated (>50 mug/g) in 8/21 (38%) siblings compared with 2/25 (8%) controls (p=0.028); whereas IP did not differ between siblings and controls. Discriminant function analysis determined that combinations of these factors significantly discriminated between groups (chi(2)=80.4, df=20, p<0.001). Siblings were separated from controls by immunological and microbiological variables. CONCLUSIONS: Healthy siblings of patients with CD manifest immune and microbiological abnormalities associated with CD distinct from their genotype-related risk and provide an excellent model in which to investigate early CD pathogenesis.},

   abstract = {In the intestinal mucosa trefoil factors (TFF) and mucins (Muc) - primarily produced by goblet cells - are thought to play a major role in providing barrier function during infection and inflammation. To investigate their role in pediatric Crohn's disease (CD) and ulcerative colitis (UC) we obtained mucosal biopsies of children with CD, UC and healthy controls and analyzed genetic expression. Levels of TFF2 mRNA were lower in inflamed mucosal samples (terminal ileum (TI) and duodenum) of children with CD, but higher in non-inflamed mucosal samples when compared to healthy controls (p < 0.05). Similarly, TFF2 levels in the TI were significantly lower in inflamed UC tissue. Adjustment for goblet cell density revealed slightly less marked, yet significantly different gene expression in IBD and controls. Furthermore, TI expression of TFF2 and Muc2 was inversely correlated with interleukin-8 expression in CD (p = 0.027). In Summary, our data demonstrate significant changes in Muc and TFF mRNA expression in pediatric patients with IBD suggesting a role in mucosal healing. Further studies are needed to elucidate a potential use as biomarkers for disease progression.},

   abstract = {PURPOSE: Gender differences in paediatric patients with inflammatory bowel disease (IBD) are frequently reported as a secondary outcome and the results are divergent. To assess gender differences by analysing data collected within the Swiss IBD cohort study database since 2008, related to children with IBD, using the Montreal classification for a systematic approach. METHODS: Data on gender, age, anthropometrics, disease location at diagnosis, disease behaviour, and therapy of 196 patients, 105 with Crohn's disease (CD) and 91 with ulcerative or indeterminate colitis (UC/IC) were retrieved and analysed. RESULTS: THE CRUDE GENDER RATIO (MALE : female) of patients with CD diagnosed at <10 years of age was 2.57, the adjusted ratio was 2.42, and in patients with UC/IC it was 0.68 and 0.64 respectively. The non-adjusted gender ratio of patients diagnosed at >/=10 years was 1.58 for CD and 0.88 for UC/IC. Boys with UC/IC diagnosed <10 years of age had a longer diagnostic delay, and in girls diagnosed with UC/IC >10 years a more important use of azathioprine was observed. No other gender difference was found after analysis of age, disease location and behaviour at diagnosis, duration of disease, familial occurrence of IBD, prevalence of extra-intestinal manifestations, complications, and requirement for surgery. CONCLUSION: CD in children <10 years affects predominantly boys with a sex ratio of 2.57; the impact of sex-hormones on the development of CD in pre-pubertal male patients should be investigated.},

   abstract = {OBJECTIVES: Growth retardation is a frequent complication of paediatric inflammatory bowel disease (IBD). Only a few studies report the final height of these patients, with controversial results. We compared adult height of patients with paediatric IBD with that of patients with adult-onset disease. METHODS: Height data of 675 women 19-44 years of age and 454 men 23-44 years of age obtained at inclusion in the Swiss IBD cohort study registry were grouped according to the age at diagnosis: (a) prepubertal (men</=13, women</=11 years), (b) pubertal (men 13-22, women 11-18 years) and (c) adult (men>22, women>18 years of age), and compared with each other and with healthy controls. RESULTS: Male patients with prepubertal onset of Crohn's disease (CD) had significantly lower final height (mean 172+/-6 cm, range 161-182) compared with men with pubertal (179+/-6 cm, 161-192) or adult (178+/-7 cm, 162-200) age at onset and the general population (178+/-7 cm, 142-204). Height z-scores standardized against heights of the normal population were significantly lower in all patients with a prepubertal diagnosis of CD (-0.8+/-0.9) compared with the other patient groups (-0.1+/-0.8, P<0.001). Prepubertal onset of CD emerged as a risk factor for reduced final height in patients with prepubertal CD. No difference for final height was found between patients with ulcerative or unclassified IBD diagnosed at prepubertal, pubertal or adult age. CONCLUSION: Prepubertal onset of CD is a risk for lower final height, independent of the initial disease location and the necessity for surgical interventions.},

Our aim of the present work has been to explore the levels of antibodies (IgG and IgA) raised against extracellular proteins produced by LAB and its association with IBD. We analyzed, by Western-blot and ELISA, the presence of serum antibodies (IgA and IgG) developed against extracellular protein fractions produced by different food bacteria from the genera Bifidobacterium and Lactobacillus. We used a sera collection consisting of healthy individuals (HC, n = 50), Crohn's disease patients (CD, n = 37), and ulcerative colitis patients (UC, n = 15). Levels of IgA antibodies developed against a cell-wall hydrolase from Lactobacillus casei subsp. rhamnosus GG (CWH) were significantly higher in the IBD group (P < 0.002; n = 52). The specificity of our measurements was confirmed by measuring IgA antibodies developed against the CWH peptide 365-VNTSNQTAAVSAS-377. IBD patients appeared to have different immune response to food bacteria.

   abstract = {Growth and nutritional status are important issues in paediatric inflammatory bowel disease (IBD). While linear growth is easy to assess, nutritional status is more complicated, with reports often compromised by the use of simple measures, such as weight and the body mass index, to assess nutritional status rather than more appropriate and sophisticated techniques to measure body composition. This review is an update on what is currently known about nutritional status as determined by body composition in paediatric IBD. Further, this review will focus on the impact of biologics on growth in paediatric IBD. Significant lean mass deficits have been reported in children with IBD compared with controls, and there is evidence these deficits persist over time. Furthermore, data imply that gender differences exist in body composition, both at diagnosis and in response to treatment. With respect to growth improvements following treatment with biologics, there are conflicting data. While some studies report enhancement of growth, others do not. The relationship between disease severity, impaired growth and the requirement for biologics needs to be considered when interpreting these data. However, key features associated with improvements in growth appear to be successful clinical response to treatment, patients in early stages of puberty, and the presence of growth failure at the onset of treatment.},

   abstract = {BACKGROUND: One of the problems associated with infliximab (IFX) treatment for Crohn's disease (CD) is loss of response during maintenance therapy. AIMS: The aim of this multicenter, retrospective, cohort study was to determine whether enteral nutrition (EN) added to the IFX therapy regimen is effective for maintaining remission in adult CD patients. METHODS: Patients with CD who had started IFX therapy between April 2003 and March 2008 at any one of the seven participating medical centers and who met the following inclusion criteria were enrolled in the study: remission after triple infusions of IFX followed by IFX maintenance therapy every 8 weeks, and follow-up data available for >/= 1 year. Remission was defined as a C-reactive protein (CRP) level of <0.3 mg/dL, and recurrence was defined as an increase in CRP to >/= 1.5 mg/dL or shortening of the IFX interval. Patients were classified by EN dosage into two groups (EN group and non-EN group). The cumulative remission period and related factors were analyzed. RESULTS: Of the 102 adult CD patients who met the inclusion criteria, 45 were in the EN group and 57 were in the non-EN group. The cumulative remission rate was significantly higher in the EN group than in the non-EN group (P = 0.009). Multivariate analysis revealed that EN was the only suppressive factor for disease recurrence (P = 0.01). CONCLUSIONS: The results demonstrate that among this CD patient cohort, EN combined with IFX maintenance treatment was clinically useful for maintaining remission.},

   abstract = {OBJECTIVES: Intractable diarrhea of infancy (IDI), a group of prolonged diarrheal disorders, is difficult to diagnose and manage. We documented general features of patients and the causes of IDI. METHODS: The present retrospective study included 60 hospitalized patients with IDI ages 0 to 24 months during January 2000 to December 2010. Detailed history, laboratory and endoscopic findings, diagnoses, and clinical courses were reviewed. Descriptive analyses were used for statistical evaluation. RESULTS: The male/female ratio was 1.4. The median age at onset of diarrhea was 12 days. A total of 70% and 11% of patients were severely and moderately malnourished, respectively. Carbohydrate malabsorption (CM) and food allergies (n = 11, 18% for both) were the most frequent causes. A total of 16 of the patients (27%) did not have a specific diagnosis. The other diagnoses were infections (n = 5), immune-mediated disorders (IMD) (n = 6), congenital enterocyte defects (CED) (n = 3, 5%), short bowel syndrome (n = 2), cystic fibrosis (n = 2), intestinal pseudoobstruction (n = 1), congenital disorder of glycosylation (n = 1), abetalipoproteinemia (n = 1), and proprotein convertase (PC) 1 deficiency (n = 1). Stool calprotectin level was high in 10 of 19 patients with Crohn disease (n = 3, mean 1116 +/- 851 mg/L), food allergy (n = 4, mean 516 +/- 288 mg/L), and undefined etiology (n = 3, mean 616 +/- 780 mg/L). The mean duration of hospitalization was 76 days. CONCLUSIONS: IDI is a heterogeneous group of diarrheal disorders. The most frequent causes were CM and food allergies in our study. Because high levels of calprotectin support inflammation, calprotectin levels may help to discriminate CED and inflammatory causes of IDI.},

METHODS: During the period of 30 months, we included 44 patients. Chromosome aberrations were analyzed in peripheral blood lymphocytes by a single cytogeneticist. Multicolor flow cytometric was used for immunophenotyping of peripheral blood lymphocytes. RESULTS: We found a significantly higher number of chromosomal aberrations/100 metaphases in the celiac and Crohn's disease group compared with the controls (P=0.01) and they also had a significantly higher number of aberrant cells compared with the controls (P<0.001). There was no statistically significant difference between the groups with respect to the percentage of CD103+ and CD8+CD103+ cells between groups (P=0.16 and 0.41, respectively) and no correlation between the total number of chromosomal aberrations and the percentage of CD103+ and CD8+CD103+ cells (P=0.06 and 0.06, respectively). CONCLUSION: Patients with active celiac and newly diagnosed Crohn's disease, before treatment initiation, have a significantly increased number of chromosomal aberrations in peripheral blood lymphocytes. No dissemination of intraepithelial cells in the blood and correlation to the chromosomal aberration was found.},

   abstract = {UNLABELLED: The aim of this study was to evaluate risk factors associated with the relapse rate in the first year and the need for surgery in children with Crohn's disease (CD). Data of all children (n = 74) diagnosed with CD from January 2004 to June 2011 were retrospectively analyzed. Multivariate Cox proportional hazards regression model was used to assess whether important clinical variables at diagnosis (age, presence of perianal disease, first induction therapy, first maintenance therapy, levels of Pediatric CD Activity Index (PCDAI), C-reactive protein (CRP), and standard deviation score (SDS) for height for weight) were associated with the risk of clinical recurrence in the first year and need for surgery during follow-up. Relapse occurred in 36 (48.6 %) patients in the first year from diagnosis. The only significant parameter associated with negative risk of relapse in the first year was exclusive enteral nutrition (EEN) used as induction therapy (hazard ratio (HR) 0.469, 95 % confidence interval (CI) 0.232-0.948). EEN induced remission in 84.2 % of patients. The only risk associated with EEN treatment failure was the involvement of the upper gastrointestinal tract. During the follow-up, 25 (33.7 %) patients underwent surgery. The multivariate Cox regression model failed to recognize significant risk factor for surgery. CONCLUSION: This study underlines the importance of early EEN in the treatment of CD; it is not only efficacious in the remission induction but could also prevent relapse in the first year.},

   abstract = {OBJECTIVE: The present understanding of inflammatory bowel disease pathogenesis mainly relies on studies of adult patients. Therefore, we studied the balance between T-effector and regulatory cells in pediatric inflammatory bowel disease. METHODS: Quantitative polymerase chain reaction and immunohistochemistry served to quantify the expression of immunological markers in mucosal biopsies and flow cytometry analysis was used in peripheral blood mononuclear cells. RESULTS: Colonic interleukin (IL)-17+, IL-22, and IL-6 mRNA upregulation and increase in the number of colonic IL-17 cells were demonstrated in both Crohn disease (CD) and ulcerative colitis (UC). Likewise, colonic forkhead box P3 (FOXP3+) mRNA expression and the number of colonic FOXP3 cells were increased both in CD and in UC and were accompanied in CD also with increased numbers of FOXP3+CD25 High CD4 cells in peripheral blood. Ileal relation of IL-17/CD4 cells was increased only in CD. CONCLUSIONS: We showed activation of colonic IL-17/IL-22 axis and upregulation of FOXP3 to occur both in pediatric CD and in UC, indicating shared immunological characteristics. Upregulation of IL-17 was restricted to colon in UC, but existed in the ileum and in the colon in active CD.},

   abstract = {INTRODUCTION: Recent research suggests a relationship of inflammatory bowel disease (IBD) and depression. Our objective was to evaluate for improvement of depressive symptoms with treatment of IBD using immunosuppressive medications. METHODS: A retrospective study of consecutive patients with IBD started on immunosuppressive agents [anti-tumor necrosis factor (anti-TNF) or immunomodulator therapy] was conducted. Patients were evaluated if disease activity indices using Harvey Bradshaw Index for Crohn's disease (CD) and Simple Clinical Colitis Disease Activity Index for ulcerative colitis (UC) and depressive indices using Patient Health Questionnaire-9 (PHQ-9) scores were obtained before and at least 30 days after initiation of therapy. RESULTS: Sixteen patients with UC and 53 patients with CD (all with active disease symptoms) were evaluated over a 60 day median follow-up evaluation (range 30, 140 days). Twenty-two patients started on immunomodulator therapy, and 47 patients started on anti-TNF therapy. Crohn's disease patients had significantly decreased PHQ-9 scores at follow-up [median 9 (range 3, 14) to 4 (1, 8)], with significant decreases only in those started on anti-TNF therapy. Changes in PHQ-9 and CRP were correlated (rho = 0.38, p < 0.05). In patients with UC, PHQ-9 scores [5 (3, 9) to 2 (0, 5)] were significantly decreased. Percentage at risk of moderate to severe depression (PHQ-9 scores >/=10) was lower after treatment [Crohn's disease 51-18 % (p < 0.05), ulcerative colitis 18-0 %]. CONCLUSION: Depressive scores decreased significantly in patients with IBD treated with immunosuppressive therapy and the number at risk for moderate to severe depression improved significantly.},

   abstract = {OBJECTIVES: Adults with inflammatory bowel disease (IBD) have a high prevalence of Clostridium difficile infection (CDI). CDI in children with IBD may differ from adults. We aim to compare the prevalence of CDI in hospitalized pediatric and adult IBD patients and patients without IBD. METHODS: The rates of CDI per 1,000 IBD and non-IBD hospitalizations between 1993 and 2012 were examined using the Maryland Health Services Cost Review Commission database. Age, sex and calendar year adjusted incidence rate ratios comparing CDI in pediatrics and adults by type of IBD and with patients without IBD were calculated. p values for trend identifying changes in rates over time were calculated. RESULTS: Among children, the rate of CDI was over 12 times greater in IBD than non-IBD hospitalizations (p < 0.0001) and among adults, the rate of CDI was four times greater in IBD than non-IBD hospitalizations (p < 0.0001). In adults, CDI was significantly higher in ulcerative colitis (UC) than Crohn's disease (60.4 per 1,000 vs. 19.8 per 1,000, p < 0.0001) but in children there was no difference in CDI in UC compared with Crohn's disease (32 per 1,000 vs. 27 per 1,000, p = 0.45). The prevalence of CDI increased in pediatric and adult IBD patients, and patients without IBD, between 1993 and 2012 (p for trend <0.0001). CONCLUSIONS: CDI was more common in adult patients with UC, and no difference was found between CDI and IBD type in pediatrics. There may be different risk factors for CDI during hospitalization between adults and children with IBD.},

   abstract = {BACKGROUND: Interferon-gamma release assay (IGRA) is widely used for screening of latent tuberculosis (TB) before and during biological therapy (BT). An indeterminate result of IGRA represents a limitation in the management of inflammatory bowel disease (IBD). Data on factors influencing IGRA results are scarce in children. The aim of the study was to identify factors influencing IGRA results in children with IBD. METHODS: Seventy-two children with IBD (59 Crohn disease, 11 ulcerative colitis, 2 IBD-unclassified) indicated for BT were tested for TB infection (history, TB skin test, chest radiograph, IGRA; QuantiFERON-TB Gold in tube [QFT]) and consecutively retested using QFT in 1-year intervals. RESULTS: We recorded 165 results of QFT (3% positive, 87% negative, and 10% indeterminate results). During follow-up we identified 4 conversions of negative QFT to positivity (3%) and 4 reversions (4%). Patients with indeterminate results of QFT had significantly lower actual weight-for-height z score (P = 0.022), higher platelet count (P = 0.00017), and lower levels of serum albumin (P = 0.015) compared with patients with positive or negative QFT. Indeterminate QFT was associated with corticosteroid treatment, BT, and disease activity, but not with treatment by immunomodulators. In a subanalysis of patients with Crohn disease alone, Pediatric Crohn's Disease Activity Index was identified as single independent risk factor for indeterminate results (P = 0.00037). CONCLUSIONS: Although corticosteroid treatment is traditionally considered to be the main risk factor for indeterminate results of IGRA, the disease activity of IBD has even more profound effects on the results.},

   abstract = {GOALS: To examine the efficiency of exclusive enteral nutrition (EEN) in relieving inflammatory bowel stricture in patients with Crohn's disease (CD). BACKGROUND: Patients with CD usually develop bowel strictures due to transmural edema of intestinal wall, which can potentially be managed with conservative medical treatment. Previous studies showed that EEN therapy could induce clinical remission through its anti-inflammation effect. METHODS: We achieved a prospective observational study. CD patients with inflammatory bowel stricture were preliminarily differentiated from a fibrous one, and further treated with EEN therapy for 12 weeks. Demographics and clinical variables were recorded. Nutritional (body mass index, albumin, pre-albumin, transferrin, etc.), inflammatory (C-reactive protein, erythrocyte sedimentation rate, white blood cell, etc.), and radiologic parameters (bowel wall thickness, luminal diameter, and luminal cross-sectional area) were evaluated at baseline, week 4, and week 12, respectively. RESULTS: Between May 2012 and January 2013, 65 patients with CD were preliminarily diagnosed with inflammatory bowel stricture and 6 patients were further excluded. Among the remaining 59 cases, 50 patients (84.7%) finished the whole EEN treatment, whereas the other 9 patients (15.3%) gained progressive bowel obstruction resulting in surgery. Intention-to-treat analyses showed that 48 patients (81.4%) achieved symptomatic remission, 35 patients (53.8%) achieved radiologic remission, and 42 patients (64.6%) achieved clinical remission. Among those patients who complete the whole EEN therapy, inflammatory, nutritional, and radiologic parameters improved significantly compared with baseline. Of note, the average luminal cross-sectional area at the site of stricture increased approximately 331% at week 12 (195.7 +/- 18.79 vs. 59.09 +/- 10.64 mm, P<0.001). CONCLUSIONS: EEN therapy can effectively relieve inflammatory bowel stricture in CD, which replenishes roles of enteral nutrition in the treatment of CD. Further studies are expected to investigate the underlying mechanisms of this effect in the future.},

   abstract = {OBJECTIVES: Breath analysis and exhaled breath condensate (EBC) collection are simple and noninvasive processes whereby inflammatory mediators and other biomarkers can be assessed in diseases that affect the lung. It was hypothesised that markers of epithelial dysfunction and secretion, such as a low pH, 8-isoprostane, and release of epithelial factors such as trefoil factor 2 (TFF2) and mucin, would be elevated in the breath of those with inflammatory bowel disease (IBD). The aim was to compare the levels of these biomarkers in EBC and the fraction of expired nitric oxide (FENO) in children with Crohn disease (CD), in those with asthma, and in normal individuals in a pilot study. METHODS: EBC was collected from patients in the 3 groups mentioned above in a cross-sectional design. pH, 8-isoprostane, TFF2, and mucin levels were measured in the EBC. Spirometry was performed in asthmatic patients and patients with IBD, whereas FENO and skin prick tests were performed in patients with IBD. RESULTS: Breath samples including EBC were collected from 80 patients (30 CD, 30 asthma, 20 controls). Compared with controls, EBC pH was lower in children with IBD (P < 0.0001) or asthma (P = 0.0041). 8-Isoprostane levels differed between the 3 groups (P < 0.05). EBC TFF2 was mainly less than the limit of detection, whereas mucin levels did not differ significantly between the 3 groups. FENO was measurable in children with IBD, but did not correlate with disease activity or serum markers of inflammation. CONCLUSIONS: A lower EBC pH may reflect inflammatory events either in the lung or systemically. 8-Isoprostane, FENO, and mucin were detected for the first time in the EBC of children with IBD. Further studies are required to assess the value of these assessments.},

   abstract = {OBJECTIVES: The base of human Peyer patches of the terminal ileum has been noted to contain black granular pigment deposits, composed of titanium dioxide and aluminosilicate, which are food additives typically present in a Western diet, and pharmaceuticals. In the present study, we investigated the distribution of exogenous pigment throughout the gastrointestinal tract of children suspected of having inflammatory bowel disease (IBD), the correlation between their age and the presence and amount of pigment in Peyer patches, and its relation to pediatric IBD. METHODS: Biopsies (upper and lower gastrointestinal tract) from children suspected of having IBD who underwent endoscopy, were reassessed by a blinded, expert pathologist. The amount of pigment in biopsies was scored using a semiquantitative scale (range 0 to +++). RESULTS: A total of 151 children were included: 62 with Crohn disease (CD), 26 with ulcerative colitis, and 63 with non-IBD. In 63 children (42%), deposits of black pigment were found only in biopsies from the terminal ileum, located in Peyer patches. A significant correlation was found between increasing age and the amount of pigment (P = 0.004). Pigment deposits were found significantly less in the patients with CD compared with those in patients with ulcerative colitis and those with non-IBD (26% vs 62% and 49%, P = 0.002). CONCLUSIONS: These results provide support for the hypothesis that the amount of pigment, only present in Peyer patches in the terminal ileum, becomes denser with increasing age. Absence of pigment in Peyer patches in a higher number of patients with CD suggests that microparticles may have become involved in the inflammatory process, possibly because of disrupted autophagy.},

   abstract = {Similar to adults, there is heterogeneous phenotypic expression of inflammatory bowel disease (IBD) in children. Thus, a classification system for disease characteristics is obligatory if one seeks to understand and eventually change the natural history of IBD. Extrapolation of adult clinical trial results to children also depends upon comparable classifications of disease. Features that can differentiate IBD in children from adults include more extensive and severe disease at presentation, frequent corticosteroid dependency, change in location and behavior over time, and the implications of disease for growth and sexual maturation. In contrast to the Montreal classification where all patients <17 years were grouped together, the Paris classification recognizes the different expression of pediatric IBD between those patients aged <10 years and those 10-17 years of age. The recent identification of monogenic disorders in very young children (<2 years) with severe IBD-like disease has further clouded the issue of where appropriate pediatric age guidelines should be drawn, though it is clear these infantile-onset cases should not be grouped with older children. The Paris classification recognizes the importance of upper tract disease on natural history by dividing it into L4a and L4b (proximal and distal to the ligament of Treitz, respectively), while the Montreal system groups all upper-tract patients together. Complicated disease behavior in the Montreal system mandated a single category preventing the concomitant designation as stricturing and penetrating, whereas the Paris classification recognizes that both stricturing and penetrating behavior may occur at the same or different times. Growth delay is recognized only in the Paris classification as a serious manifestation of IBD in children affecting therapeutic decisions. As our understanding of the basic molecular mechanisms of disease pathogenesis in IBD changes over time, it is likely that the IBD classification will change as well. A single classification system that reflects both pediatric and adult disease is needed.},

Epithelioid cell granulomas in intestinal biopsies are one, non-obligate, criterion of CD. We investigated granulomas as markers of CD severity in children followed to adulthood. MATERIAL AND METHODS: Forty-five individuals with childhood onset CD were studied from diagnosis until attainment of final height, with data on disease location, medical and surgical management and with detailed growth data analyses. A blinded review of diagnostic biopsies was also performed. RESULTS: We found granulomas in 22/45 (49%) children at diagnosis, altogether in 28/45 (62%) patients during the disease course (median overall follow-up - 12.3 years, range 9.3-18). Granulomas were found in 9/11 (82%) with upper gastrointestinal involvement (cumulatively 17/20, 85%) (p = 0.017 and p = 0.006, respectively). The time from diagnosis to initiating immune modulating treatment (median 4.5 months, range 0-75) was shorter in the granuloma-positive group (16/22) compared to the granuloma-negative group (18/23) (median 33 months, range 2-105; p = 0.01). The median standard deviation score height at diagnosis and final adult height (both adjusted for target height) did not correlate to findings of granulomas. CONCLUSIONS: Epithelioid cell granulomas were associated with a shorter time to initiating immune modulating drugs, as a possible sign of more severe disease, but growth was not affected.},

However, knowledge about the optimal way in which to use these drugs continues to evolve. In this paper, the evidence regarding optimal timing and dosing of thiopurines and biologics will be reviewed as will the role of thiopurine methyltransferase testing along with therapeutic drug monitoring of both thiopurines and biologics.

   abstract = {Crohn's disease is a chronic incurable condition that normally requires lifelong treatment. Whilst the anti-TNF agents have revolutionised the management of Crohn's disease over the last fifteen years, they are not a panacea. In particular, in part due to their immunogenic nature, loss of response limits their long term effectiveness in many patients. The only other long term disease-modifying options are the immunomodulators, methotrexate, azathioprine and mercaptopurine. Therefore, given the limited number of drugs available to treat Crohn's disease, it is important that efforts are made to ensure that drugs are used in the best way possible as once a drug is deemed ineffective, it is rarely used again. For the growing number of patients who have active disease despite having been exposed to all standard therapies, failure to optimise drug therapy may lead to missed opportunities in the management of their disease.

   abstract = {Carnitine is a vitamin-like compound that plays important roles in fatty acid beta-oxidation and the control of the mitochondrial coenzyme A/acetyl-CoA ratio. However, carnitine is not added to ordinary enteral nutrition or total parenteral nutrition. In this study, we determined the serum carnitine concentrations in subjects receiving ordinary enteral nutrition (EN) or total parenteral nutrition (TPN) and in patients with inflammatory bowel diseases to compare its levels with those of other nutritional markers. Serum samples obtained from 11 EN and 11 TPN patients and 82 healthy controls were examined. In addition, 10 Crohn's disease and 10 ulcerative colitis patients with malnutrition who were barely able to ingest an ordinary diet were also evaluated. Carnitine and its derivatives were quantified using liquid chromatography-tandem mass spectrometry (LC-MS/MS). The carnitine concentrations in EN and TPN subjects were significantly lower compared with those of the control subjects. Neither the serum albumin nor the total cholesterol level was correlated with the carnitine concentration, although a significant positive correlation was found between the serum albumin and total cholesterol levels. Indeed, patients with CD and UC showed significantly reduced serum albumin and/or total cholesterol levels, but their carnitine concentrations remained normal. In conclusion, only a complete blockade of an ordinary diet, such as EN or TPN, caused a reduction in the serum carnitine concentration. Serum carnitine may be an independent biomarker of malnutrition, and its supplementation is needed in EN and TPN subjects even if their serum albumin and total cholesterol levels are normal.},

   abstract = {BACKGROUND: Pediatric inflammatory bowel disease (IBD) self-management fits well within a social-cognitive framework. At the heart of social-cognitive theory is self-efficacy, a set of beliefs about one's ability to perform certain tasks. Self-efficacy is a strong predictor of health outcomes in chronic diseases and could serve as an intermediary outcome measure of self-management for pediatric IBD. The aim of this preliminary study was to develop items for the design of a self-efficacy scale specifically for adolescents and young adults with IBD. METHODS: Survey development is an iterative process. As defined by the US Food and Drug Administration guidelines for developing a patient-reported outcome measurement, the first step of this process is to obtain patient input. Using qualitative research methods, adolescents and young adults were recruited from an outpatient pediatric gastroenterology clinic to participate in a semistructured interview. Transcriptions of the recorded interviews were reviewed for themes related to self-efficacy around disease management. A consensus panel of gastroenterologists and health psychologists reviewed the initially constructed items. Those specific items were then reviewed and adjusted by a panel of participants for content and understandability using cognitive interview methods. The resulting 13-item scale is presented here. RESULTS: Nineteen patients and 5 parents participated in the study. The study sample was 42% girls, 79% whites, 74% had Crohn disease, and 79% had not required surgery. Median age was 15 years (range 10-22 years). Theme analysis and expert review yielded 13 items across 4 theoretical domains: managing medical care, managing daily life with IBD, managing emotions, and managing the future with IBD. CONCLUSIONS: A 13-item disease-specific scale has been developed based on patient input to assess self-efficacy around self-management in adolescents with IBD. Efforts to validate this newly designed scale are presently under way.},

   abstract = {BACKGROUND: Vitamin D insufficiency has been suggested to be associated with high risk of Crohn's disease (CD). In France, where food fortification is limited, the major source of vitamin D is through sun exposure. The aim of this work was to analyze the relationship between residential sun exposure and the risk of incident CD or ulcerative colitis (UC). METHODS: The E3N cohort consists of women living in France, aged 40 to 65 years and free of major diseases at inclusion in 1990. Among the 91,870 women included in the study, we identified 123 incident cases (45 CD, 71 UC, and 7 indeterminate colitis). To assess residential sun exposure, we used a database containing mean daily ultraviolet radiation (UVR) dose for each French county. The relationship between residential sun exposure and risk of incident inflammatory bowel diseases was explored using Cox models. RESULTS: Higher levels of residential sun exposure were associated with a significant decreased risk of CD (hazard ratio [HR] for the third versus the first tertile of UVR dose, 0.49; 95% confidence interval (CI), 0.23-1.01; P for trend = 0.04), but not of UC (HR, 1.21; CI, 0.61-2.11). In women with available data on dietary vitamin D intake, we observed a lower risk of CD with higher residential UVR (HR, 0.29; 95% CI, 0.11-0.80; P for trend = 0.01). Dietary vitamin D intake was neither associated with the risk of CD (HR, 0.41; 95% CI, 0.14-1.24; P for trend = 0.14) nor UC (HR, 1.61; CI, 0.61-4.23). CONCLUSIONS: In this prospective cohort of women, high residential sunlight exposure was associated with decreased incidence of CD, but not UC.},

   abstract = {BACKGROUND & AIMS: Patients with inflammatory bowel disease (IBD) are at increased risk for developing colorectal neoplasia. Researchers have debated whether treatment of IBD with thiopurines reduces cancer risk. We performed a meta-analysis of thiopurine exposure and risk of colorectal dysplasia or cancer in patients with IBD. METHODS: We used MEDLINE, EMBASE, and Cochrane search engines and abstract books from international conferences to identify relevant literature. We included studies on thiopurine exposure and risk of colorectal neoplasia in patients with ulcerative colitis or Crohn's disease. We calculated pooled odds ratios (ORs) with 95% confidence intervals (CIs) and performed a meta-regression analysis of the effect of year of publication. Various sensitivity analyses were conducted. RESULTS: Fifteen studies fulfilled the inclusion criteria. Overall, we did not observe a significant effect of thiopurines on risk for colorectal neoplasia (dysplasia and/or cancer) in patients with IBD (OR, 0.87; 95% CI, 0.71-1.06). The estimate did not change markedly in separate assessments of the 2 population-based studies (OR, 0.87; 95% CI, 0.59-1.29), the 13 clinic-based studies (OR, 0.87; 95% CI, 0.59-1.09), the 7 cohort studies (OR, 0.93; 95% CI, 0.67-1.28), or the 8 case-control studies (OR, 0.83; 95% CI, 0.65-1.08). Studies that used neoplasia (dysplasia or cancer) as outcomes tended to show that thiopurines had protective effects (OR for neoplasia, 0.72; 95% CI, 0.50-1.05); these effects were not observed in studies of colorectal cancer (OR, 0.90; 95% CI, 0.72-1.12) or in studies published in recent years (meta-regression; P = .16). CONCLUSIONS: In a meta-analysis, we did not find a significant protective effect of treatment with thiopurines on the risk of colorectal neoplasia in patients with IBD.},

   abstract = {OBJECTIVES: Crohn's disease (CD) is associated with reduced bone mineral density. The main objective of the present study was to assess the mandibular trabecular bone quality and to compare our findings with those among sex- and age-matched controls. Furthermore, background variables known to be significant for bone density were compared. MATERIALS AND METHODS: Intraoral radiographs of 49 Crohn's patients (23-61 years old) and 49 age- and sex-matched controls were evaluated. Mandibular trabecular pattern was classified as either sparse, mixed dense plus sparse, or dense. Furthermore, two computer-based methods analyzed the transitions from trabecula to intertrabecular spaces and the size and number of these spaces. Differences in continuous background variables were tested with Student's two-sample t test and ordinal variables with Mann-Whitney U test or Kruskal-Wallis nonparametric tests. RESULTS: All three methods to evaluate bone structure seen on dental radiographs showed significantly sparser trabeculation in Crohn's patients than in the control group. The Crohn's patients were heavier, more often smokers, and more frequently had mothers who developed fragility fractures. Furthermore, the Crohn's patients, especially smokers, had a significantly higher fracture rate than the matched control group but no significant relationship was found between trabeculation pattern and fracture. CONCLUSIONS: The results of this investigations indicated that trabecular bone is significantly sparser in subjects with Crohn's disease compared to a matched control group. CLINICAL RELEVANCE: An early identification of CD patients with sparse trabeculation and appropriate advice concerning nutrition and exercise may lead to less fractures and medication in the future.},

   abstract = {Granulocyte-macrophage colony-stimulating factor (GM-CSF) autoantibodies are associated with stricturing behaviour in Crohn disease (CD). We hypothesized that CD ileal lamina propria mononuclear cells (LPMC) would produce GM-CSF autoantibodies and peripheral blood (PB) samples would contain GM-CSF neutralizing capacity (NC). Paediatric CD and control PBMC and ileal biopsies or LPMC were isolated and cultured and GM-CSF, immunoglobulin (Ig)G and GM-CSF autoantibodies production were measured by enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay (ELISA). Basal and GM-CSF-primed neutrophil bacterial killing and signal transducer and activator of transcription 5 (STAT5) tyrosine phosphorylation (pSTAT5) were measured by flow cytometry. GM-CSF autoantibodies were enriched within total IgG for LPMC isolated from CD ileal strictures and proximal margins compared to control ileum. Neutrophil bacterial killing was reduced in CD patients compared to controls. Within CD, neutrophil GM-CSF-dependent STAT5 activation and bacterial killing were reduced as GM-CSF autoantibodies increased. GM-CSF stimulation of pSTAT5 did not vary between controls and CD patients in washed PB granulocytes in which serum was removed. However, GM-CSF stimulation of pSTAT5 was reduced in whole PB samples from CD patients. These data were used to calculate the GM-CSF NC. CD patients with GM-CSF NC greater than 25% exhibited a fourfold higher rate of stricturing behaviour and surgery. The likelihood ratio (95% confidence interval) for stricturing behaviour for patients with elevation in both GM-CSF autoantibodies and GM-CSF NC was equal to 5 (2, 11). GM-CSF autoantibodies are produced by LPMC isolated from CD ileal resection specimens and are associated with reduced neutrophil bacterial killing. CD peripheral blood contains GM-CSF NC, which is associated with increased rates of stricturing behaviour.},

   abstract = {OBJECTIVE: No Crohn's disease (CD) molecular maker has advanced to clinical use, and independent lines of evidence support a central role of the gut microbial community in CD. Here we explore the feasibility of extracting bacterial protein signals relevant to CD, by interrogating myriads of intestinal bacterial proteomes from a small number of patients and healthy controls. DESIGN: We first developed and validated a workflow-including extraction of microbial communities, two-dimensional difference gel electrophoresis (2D-DIGE), and LC-MS/MS-to discover protein signals from CD-associated gut microbial communities. Then we used selected reaction monitoring (SRM) to confirm a set of candidates. In parallel, we used 16S rRNA gene sequencing for an integrated analysis of gut ecosystem structure and functions. RESULTS: Our 2D-DIGE-based discovery approach revealed an imbalance of intestinal bacterial functions in CD. Many proteins, largely derived from Bacteroides species, were over-represented, while under-represented proteins were mostly from Firmicutes and some Prevotella members. Most overabundant proteins could be confirmed using SRM. They correspond to functions allowing opportunistic pathogens to colonise the mucus layers, breach the host barriers and invade the mucosae, which could still be aggravated by decreased host-derived pancreatic zymogen granule membrane protein GP2 in CD patients. Moreover, although the abundance of most protein groups reflected that of related bacterial populations, we found a specific independent regulation of bacteria-derived cell envelope proteins. CONCLUSIONS: This study provides the first evidence that quantifiable bacterial protein signals are associated with CD, which can have a profound impact on future molecular diagnosis.},

   abstract = {BACKGROUND: Loss of response (LOR) to infliximab (IFX) has become an important clinical issue for patients with Crohn's disease (CD). Elemental diet (ED) therapy has been established as a nutrition therapy for CD in Japan. ED therapy can reduce antigen exposure and is both efficacious and safe. AIM: To evaluate the efficacy of concomitant ED therapy in maintaining regular IFX infusion in patients with CD. METHODS: We retrospectively studied 125 patients with luminal CD treated with scheduled IFX maintenance therapy with a regular dosage. Patients were classified into two groups: the ED group with intake >/= 900 kcal/day and the non-ED group with intake <900 kcal/day. When clinical LOR was detected on the basis of disease activity, laboratory parameters, or endoscopic findings, the physician discontinued the infusion schedule of IFX. We investigated the efficacy of ED therapy for sustaining the scheduled IFX maintenance therapy. RESULTS: With the exception of ED intake, no significant differences were found in patient characteristics between the ED group and the non-ED group. The ED group was significantly superior to the non-ED group (p = 0.049) in sustaining scheduled IFX maintenance therapy. It is well known that ED therapy is more effective for small bowel lesions than colonic lesions in CD. When comparing ileitis and ileocolitis patients with CD, the ED group was significantly superior to the non-ED group (p = 0.015). CONCLUSIONS: Concomitant ED therapy is effective in maintaining scheduled IFX maintenance therapy in patients with luminal CD in order to prevent LOR.},

The POC blood glucose values were consistently much higher than the lab values. Humalog insulin (5 U) was given to the patient to decrease high blood glucose levels that developed following administration of TPN. The patient then became hypoglycemic as a result of this insulin treatment. POC glucose testing, performed every 4h, did not detect the iatrogenic hypoglycemia, while lab glucose results were not given close attention. The lab sample was always drawn 1-2h after insulin was given to the patient and resulted in a lower blood glucose value. In addition, the symptoms of hypoglycemia such as shaking and dizziness were masked by the patient's poor health status, supine position, and the continuously given TPN. CONCLUSIONS: These findings highlighted the importance of the correct sampling time following insulin administration and the consideration of the lab results in addition to POC. The patient's insulin regimen was modified to prevent further hypoglycemic events.},

   abstract = {Exclusive enteral nutrition is established as an initial therapy to induce remission in active Crohn's disease (CD), especially in children, but the mechanisms of action of this therapy are yet to be fully defined. CEACAM6 protein is an adhesion molecule that is up-regulated in active CD and implicated in the attachment of adherent-invasive Escherichia coli (AIEC) to the gut epithelium. Using the Caco-2 human adenocarcinoma cell line, this study showed that the incubation of human cells with a polymeric formula (PF) resulted in a dose-dependent increase in the expression of CEACAM6, and that this effect was most noticeable on the cell surface. Further investigation revealed that PF doubled the release of CEACAM6 protein by Caco-2 cells exposed to PF, and that an increase in release of soluble CEACAM6 inversely correlated with the ability of AIEC to associate with the intestinal epithelial cells. Our findings suggest that the secretion of cell surface-associated proteins acting as releasable decoys may be an aspect of the gut's innate immune response to pathogenic bacteria that is strengthened by PF in the setting of CD.},

   abstract = {BACKGROUND: Infliximab (IFX) is efficacious for induction and maintenance of remission in pediatric patients with moderate-to-severe inflammatory bowel disease (IBD). It has, however, not been studied in patients 7 years old and younger. Our aim was to characterize efficacy and safety of IFX therapy in this cohort. METHODS: This was a retrospective study of patients with IBD ages 7 years and younger, treated with IFX between 1999 and 2011. Medical records were reviewed for age of diagnosis, disease phenotype, therapy, surgery, IFX infusion dates, dose, and intervals. Outcome measures included physician global assessment, corticosteroid requirement, and adverse events. RESULTS: Thirty-three children (ages 2.4-7 years) were included. Twenty patients had Crohn disease, 4 had ulcerative colitis, and 9 had indeterminate colitis. Maintenance of IFX therapy at 1, 2, and 3 years was 36%, 18%, and 12%, respectively. Patients of age 5 years and younger had the lowest rates of maintenance of therapy at 25% at year 1, and 10% at years 2 and 3 combined. Nine percent of all of the patients demonstrated response measured by the physician global assessment and were steroid free at 1 year. There were 8 infusion reactions. There were no malignancies, serious infections, or deaths. CONCLUSIONS: IFX demonstrated a modest response rate and a low steroid-sparing effect in patients with IBD 7 years old and younger. Although this is a limited study, there appears to be a trend for decreased sustained efficacy with IFX in this age group, particularly in children 5 years old and younger, when compared with the previously published literature in older children.},

Massive hemorrhagic Crohn's disease is not well known and for this reason, they are a diagnostic and therapeutic challenge. Various diagnostic and therapeutic methods are currently being developed and used. The surgical method is often used only as a last measure since this approach has the risk of serious complications that may endanger patients. However, if massive bleeding continues even after all therapeutic methods are used, the surgical method must be implemented. In this case, all therapeutic methods were found to be ineffective; therefore, surgery was used as a last option. Ultimately, the surgical method was found to be successfully used to treat life-threatening hemorrhagic Crohn's disease.},

Previously, Sasa quelpaertensis leaves have been shown to mediate anti-inflammation and anti-cancer effects, although it remains unclear whether Sasa leaves are able to attenuate inflammation-related intestinal diseases. Therefore, the aim of this study was to investigate the anti-inflammatory effects of Sasa quelpaertensis leaf extract (SQE) using an in vitro co-culture model of the intestinal epithelial environment. MATERIALS/METHODS: An in vitro co-culture system was established that consisted of intestinal epithelial Caco-2 cells and RAW 264.7 macrophages. Treatment with lipopolysaccharide (LPS) was used to induce inflammation. RESULTS: Treatment with SQE significantly suppressed the secretion of LPS-induced nitric oxide (NO), prostaglandin E2 (PGE2), IL-6, and IL-1beta in co-cultured RAW 264.7 macrophages. In addition, expressions of inducible nitric oxide synthase (iNOS), cyclooxygenase (COX)-2, and tumor necrosis factor (TNF)-alpha were down-regulated in response to inhibition of IkappaBalpha phosphorylation by SQE. Compared with two bioactive compounds that have previously been identified in SQE, tricin and P-coumaric acid, SQE exhibited the most effective anti-inflammatory properties. CONCLUSIONS: SQE exhibited intestinal anti-inflammatory activity by inhibiting various inflammatory mediators mediated through nuclear transcription factor kappa-B (NF-kB) activation. Thus, SQE has the potential to ameliorate inflammation-related diseases, including IBD, by limiting excessive production of pro-inflammatory mediators.},

Mesenteric adipose tissue hypertrophy and creeping fat are characteristic features of CD. The purpose of this study was to assess the usefulness of visceral fat for the differential diagnosis of CD and ITB. METHODS: We conducted a retrospective review of 50 patients with findings of CD or ITB between January 2005 and July 2008. Abdominal computed tomography (CT) was performed on all subjects during their first evaluation. The abdominal fat area was assessed using quantitative abdominal CT. RESULTS: The ratio of visceral fat to total fat (VF/TF) was significantly higher in male CD patients than in male ITB patients. The ratio of visceral fat to subcutaneous fat (VF/SF) was also higher in CD patients than in patients with ITB. For a VF/TF cut-off value of 0.46, the sensitivity and specificity for the diagnosis of CD were 42.1% and 93.3% respectively, with positive and negative predictive values of 88.9% and 56.0%, respectively. CONCLUSION: Measurement of the abdominal fat area using CT can be clinically useful for the differential diagnosis of CD and ITB.},

   abstract = {OBJECTIVES: Thiopurines (azathioprine, 6-mercaptopurine) are a mainstay of treatment in Crohn disease (CD). Monitoring intracellular metabolite (6-thioguanine nucleotides [6-TGN] and 6-methylmercaptopurine [6-MMP]) levels can help optimize therapeutic efficacy and minimize potential toxicity. Determination of 6-MMP/6-TGN ratios may provide additional useful information, such as the identification of individuals with excessive thiopurine methyltransferase activity and disadvantageous 6-MMP overproduction. These patients are at increased risk of therapeutic failure and hepatotoxicity. The aim of the study was to evaluate the correlation of 6-MMP/6-TGN ratios with therapeutic efficacy and risk of hepatotoxicity in CD. METHODS: The present study was a single-center cross-sectional study including pediatric patients with CD studied prospectively with clinical and laboratory assessments along with serial measurements of 6-MMP and 6-TGN. Clinical response was determined using established clinical indices. RESULTS: The study included 238 pediatric patients with CD with a total of 1648 evaluation points. The patients were in steroid-free remission at 59.1% of the evaluation points. 6-MMP/6-TGN ratios of 4 to 24 were protective against relapse (odds ratio [OR] 0.52, 95% confidence interval [CI] -0.39 to 0.69, P = 0.001). Hepatotoxicity was associated with high 6-MMP levels (>3919 pmol/8 x 10 red blood cell count: OR 7.65, 95% CI 3.7-15.9, P = 0.001) and high 6-MMP/6-TGN ratios (>24: OR 5.35, 95% CI -3.43 to 8.43, P = 0.001). CONCLUSIONS: We observed significant associations between 6-MMP/6-TGN ratios and clinical response, and risk of hepatotoxicity. Our results suggest that determination of thiopurine metabolite ratios is a valuable tool for identification of patients at increased risk of therapeutic failure and hepatotoxicity.},

   abstract = {While the etiological underpinnings of inflammatory bowel disease (IBD) are highly complex, it has been noted that both clinical and pathophysiological similarities exist between IBD and both asthma and non-pulmonary allergic phenomena. In this review, several key points on common biomarkers, pathophysiology, clinical manifestations and nutritional and probiotic interventions for both IBD and non-pulmonary allergic diseases are discussed. Histamine and mast cell activity show common behaviors in both IBD and in certain allergic disorders. IgE also represents a key immunoglobulin involved in both IBD and in certain allergic pathologies, though these links require further study. Probiotics remain a critically important intervention for both IBD subtypes as well as multiple allergic phenomena. Linked clinical phenomena, especially sinonasal disease and IBD, are discussed. In addition, nutritional interventions remain an underutilized and promising therapy for modification of both allergic disorders and IBD. Recommending new mothers breastfeed their infants, and increasing the duration of breastfeeding may also help prevent both IBD and allergic diseases, but requires more investigation. While much remains to be discovered, it is clear that non-pulmonary allergic phenomena are connected to IBD in a myriad number of ways and that the discovery of common immunological pathways may usher in an era of vastly improved treatments for patients.},

   abstract = {OBJECTIVES: The radiologic healing of perianal fistulizing Crohn disease (PfCD) lags behind the clinical healing. Contrast-enhanced pelvic magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) is the radiologic study of choice used to diagnose PfCD in children. The aim was to study whether the various MRI-based radiologic parameters and score can help in staging and follow-up of patients with PfCD. METHODS: We performed a retrospective chart review of children with PfCD who underwent contrast-enhanced MRI of the pelvis. The demographic profile, clinical status, and laboratory data of the patients at the time of each MRI examination were noted. Based on the clinical status of the patient at the time of MRI examinations, the MRIs were classified into 3 groups: severe disease, mild-to-moderate disease, and asymptomatic. Each MRI examination was reviewed by a radiologist, who was blinded to the clinical status of the patient. RESULTS: Of the radiologic parameters, the number of fistulas, the complexity of fistulas, and the number of abscesses were significantly lower in the asymptomatic group compared with the mild-to-moderate and severe disease groups. The Van Assche MRI-based score was significantly lower in the asymptomatic group compared with the mild-to-moderate disease (P = 0.01) and the severe disease group (P = 0.002). The percentage increase in fistula activity after gadolinium administration was significantly lower in the asymptomatic group compared with the mild-to-moderate disease (P = 0.026) and severe disease (P = 0.019) groups. The MRI-based scores were significantly higher in the MRI examinations performed at diagnosis compared with those that were performed while the patients were receiving the treatment (P = 0.017). CONCLUSIONS: The Van Assche MRI score and the percentage increase in fistula activity after gadolinium administration help in assessing the severity perianal Crohn disease. The Van Assche MRI score may be helpful in documenting healing during therapy of perianal Crohn disease.},

   abstract = {BACKGROUND: We hypothesize that in children with Crohn's disease (CD) isolated to a single site, resection leads to clinical improvement, decreased medication requirements, and improved growth. METHODS: A retrospective review was conducted of children with CD isolated to the terminal ileum undergoing operative intervention at Children's Hospital Colorado between 2002 and 2013. RESULTS: Twenty-six patients underwent ileocecetomy (mean age at diagnosis 14.1 +/- 2.6 years; mean age at resection 15.7 +/- 2.5 years; median follow-up 2 +/- 1.5 years). Twenty-two (84.6%) patients reported clinical improvement and 17 (65.4%) were able to decrease the number or dosage of medications. Average weight increased from the 29th to the 45th percentile (P = .09) at 1 year and to the 56th percentile (P = .02) at 3 years post resection. Average body mass index increased from the 30th to the 48th and 49th percentile at 1 and 3 years (P < .05 for both), respectively. Height increased from the 39th percentile at the time of resection to the 51st percentile at 3 years (P = nonsignificant). CONCLUSION: Surgical resection of an isolated ileal segment in adolescents with CD allows for catch-up growth and reduction in medication requirements.},

   abstract = {BACKGROUND: Genome-wide association studies (GWAS) in Crohn's disease (CD) have identified associations with single-nucleotide polymorphism (SNP) rs11175593 at chromosome 12q12. The MUC19 and LRRK2 genes reside close to the GWAS signal, but it is as yet unclear which of the 2 genes represent the CD susceptibility genes. METHODS: We studied associations between nonsynonymous coding variants in the MUC19 (5) and LRRK2 (3) genes in a case-control sample comprising CD cases aged <18 years at diagnosis. The GWAS lead SNP rs11175593 was also investigated. Allelic, genotype, and haplotype associations were examined assuming different models of inheritance. RESULTS: A total of 530 cases and 600 controls were studied. The mean (+/-SD) age at diagnosis was 12.4 (+/-3.3). Most cases were male (57.4%). Most patients had ileocolonic disease location (48.8%) and inflammatory behavior at diagnosis (87.0%). Three MUC19 SNPs were nominally significantly associated with CD (rs11564245, Asp-->His: P = 0.02; rs4768261, Ser-->Phe: P = 0.0008; and rs2933353, Glu-->Ala: P = 0.01). Associations with rs4768261 were maintained after corrections for multiple comparisons (permuted, P = 0.007). None of the LRRK2 SNPs were associated with CD. Haplotype analysis supported the single SNP associations noted with the MUC19 gene. CONCLUSIONS: GWAS signal at chromosome 12q12 for CD may represent associations with the MUC19 gene.},

   abstract = {Fiber intake is critical for optimal health. This review covers the anti-inflammatory roles of fibers using results from human epidemiological observations, clinical trials, and animal studies. Fiber has body weight-related anti-inflammatory activity. With its lower energy density, a diet high in fiber has been linked to lower body weight, alleviating obesity-induced chronic inflammation evidenced by reduced amounts of inflammatory markers in human and animal studies. Body weight-unrelated anti-inflammatory activity of fiber has also been extensively studied in animal models in which the type and amount of fiber intake can be closely monitored. Fermentable fructose-, glucose-, and galactose-based fibers as well as mixed fibers have shown systemic and local intestinal anti-inflammatory activities when plasma inflammatory markers and tissue inflammation were examined. Similar anti-inflammatory activities have also been demonstrated in some human studies that controlled total fiber intake. The anti-inflammatory activities of synbiotics (probiotics plus fiber) were reviewed as well, but there was no convincing evidence indicating higher efficacy of synbiotics compared with that of fiber alone. Adverse effects have not been observed with the amount of fiber intake or supplementation used in studies, although patients with Crohn's disease may be more sensitive to inulin intake. Several possible mechanisms that may mediate the body weight-unrelated anti-inflammatory activity of fibers are discussed based on the in vitro and in vivo evidence. Fermentable fibers are known to affect the intestinal microbiome. The immunomodulatory role of the intestinal microbiome and/or microbial metabolites could contribute to the systemic and local anti-inflammatory activities of fibers.},

This study was undertaken to know the medical history of the pediatric patients until the final diagnosis could be reached. METHODS: The medical records of all pediatric patients who were diagnosed with IBD (Crohn's disease [CD] in 14 children, ulcerative colitis [UC] in 17) during the last 13 years were reviewed. We investigated the length of the diagnostic time lag, chief clinical presentation, and any useful laboratory predictor among the routinely performed examinations. Indeterminate colitis was not included. RESULTS: The mean ages of children at the final diagnosis was similar in both diseases. As for the pre-clinical past history of bowel symptoms in CD patients, 5 were previously healthy, 9 had had 1-3 gastrointestinal (GI) symptoms, weight loss, bloody stool, anemia and rectal prolapse. With UC, 9 were previously healthy, 8 had had 1-3 GI symptoms, bloody stool, anorexia. The average diagnostic time lag with CD was 3.36 months, and with UC 2.2 months. Body mass index (BMI) and the initial basic laboratory data (white blood cell, hemoglobin, mean corpuscular volume, serum albumin, and serum total protein) were lower in CD, statistically significant only in BMI. CONCLUSION: IBD shows diverse clinical symptoms before its classical features, making the patients waste time until diagnosis. It is important to concern possibility of IBD even in the mildly sick children who do not show the characteristic symptoms of IBD.},

Vegetables, especially Brassicaceae, are often shunned by people with CD because of the negative effects they are alleged to have on their symptoms. Brassicaceae supply key nutrients which are necessary to meet recommended daily intakes. We sought to identify the candidate genes involved in the beneficial or adverse effects of Brassicaceae most commonly eaten, as reported by the New Zealand adults from the "Genes and Diet in Inflammatory Bowel disease Study" based in Auckland. An analysis of associations between the single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) and the beneficial or adverse effects of the ten most commonly eaten Brassicaceae was carried out. A total of 37 SNPs were significantly associated with beneficial effects (p = 0.00097 to 0.0497) and 64 SNPs were identified with adverse effects (p = 0.0000751 to 0.049). After correcting for multiple testing, rs7515322 (DIO1) and rs9469220 (HLA) remained significant. Our findings show that the tolerance of some varieties of Brassicaceae may be shown by analysis of a person's genotype.},

   abstract = {OBJECTIVE: Clinicians often evaluate for Clostridium difficile infection (CDI) in patients with inflammatory bowel disease (IBD) presenting with exacerbations. A highly sensitive polymerase chain reaction (PCR) test for the toxin B gene of C difficile is increasingly used to diagnose CDI. The aim of this study was to determine the prevalence of positive C difficile PCR results in children and young adults with and without active IBD compared with patients with non-IBD gastrointestinal disease. METHODS: Fecal samples were obtained from patients with ulcerative colitis (UC, n = 76) or Crohn disease (CD, n = 69) and 51 controls followed in our gastroenterology program. Samples were analyzed for C difficile using a PCR test for the C difficile toxin B gene (BD GeneOhm Cdiff assay). Proportions of positive tests in each group were compared using the Pearson chi2 test. RESULTS: The prevalence of positive PCR results was 11.6% in patients with CD, 18.4% in patients with UC, and 11.8% in controls (P = 0.25). There were no significant differences in the prevalence of positive C difficile results among patients with IBD with and without active disease or among patients with and without diarrhea. CONCLUSIONS: Positive C difficile PCR results occur with similar frequency in patients with IBD with and without active disease and in patients with other gastrointestinal diseases. A positive result in a highly sensitive PCR assay that detects low copy numbers of a toxin gene in C difficile may reflect colonization in a subset of patients with IBD, confounding clinical decision making in managing disease exacerbations.},

The results of this workshop are presented in three separate manuscripts. This first section describes the most important mechanisms that contribute to the initiation and progression of intestinal fibrosis in IBD including the cellular and molecular mediators, the extracellular matrix molecules and matrix metalloproteinases/tissue inhibitors of metalloproteinases-system, the microbiota products, the role of fat, genetic and epigenetic factors, as well as the currently available experimental models. Furthermore, it identifies unanswered questions in the field of intestinal fibrosis and provides a framework for future research.},

   abstract = {BACKGROUND AND AIMS: Thiopurine use in inflammatory bowel disease (IBD) is well established for maintenance of disease remission. Approximately 3% of patients with IBD develop thiopurine-induced pancreatitis (TIP) as an idiosyncratic reaction. Patients diagnosed as having TIP are largely considered not to be candidates for future use of this drug. We hypothesize that previous TIP is not an absolute contraindication to retrialing a different thiopurine. METHODS: This case series is a retrospective chart review of those patients with IBD in whom thiopurines were successfully reintroduced following suspected TIP. The patients were all cared for in 2 Australasian pediatric IBD services. Four cases are presented of TIP appropriately related temporally to azathioprine commencement, with no other apparent cause of pancreatitis identified. All of these patients were trialled on 6-mercaptopurine according to clinical need and this was well tolerated in all cases. RESULTS AND CONCLUSIONS: This report is the largest case series to date focusing on the reintroduction of a thiopurine following suspected thiopurine induced pancreatitis. All of the patients had a typical presentation of TIP. This case series should call into question the assumption that suspected TIP is an absolute contraindication for the future use of this class of drug. Cautious reintroduction of a thiopurine, in a controlled setting, should be considered in certain circumstances. The clinical relevance of this option is most marked in patients with complicated disease requiring long-term immunosuppression, in whom other therapies are poorly tolerated or contraindicated.},

   abstract = {BACKGROUND AND AIMS: Defects in the interleukin 10 (IL-10) signalling pathway have been shown to cause very early onset inflammatory bowel disease (IBD). We report a patient with severe infantile-onset IBD with a compound heterozygous IL-10 receptor alpha subunit (IL-10RA) mutation, one of which was paternally-inherited and the other occurring de novo. METHODS: Deep sequencing of IL-10, IL-10RA and IL-10 receptor beta subunit (IL-10RB) were performed. Peripheral blood mononuclear cell (PBMC) surface expression of IL-10RA was analysed by flow cytometry. IL-10 signalling pathway was examined by measuring phosphorylated STAT3 in PBMC cultured in the presence of IL-6 or IL-10. RESULT: We identified a missense mutation in exon 4 of IL-10RA (c.583T>C) in one allele and a nonsense mutation in exon 7 of IL-10RA (c.1368G>T) in the other allele. Neither mutation has been reported previously. The patient has functional IL-10RA deficiency despite normal IL-10RA expression. CONCLUSION: This represents the first case report of a de novo mutation of IL-10RA that is associated with very early onset severe IBD. Therefore, IL-10 pathway defect should be considered in patients with infantile-onset IBD even if the parents are non-consanguineous.},

   abstract = {OBJECTIVE: Several studies have indicated that plasma citrulline levels reflect the extent of mucosal injury of the small intestine. This study was performed to determine whether plasma citrulline levels correlate with the disease activity in pediatric patients with Crohn disease (CD). METHODS: A total of 63 CD and 23 ulcerative colitis (UC) patients were included in this study. Disease severity was assessed by pediatric CD activity index (PCDAI), pediatric UC activity index, simplified endoscopic activity score for CD, C-reactive protein (CRP), and erythrocyte sedimentation rate (ESR). The correlations among these variables and plasma citrulline levels were evaluated. We performed subgroup analysis whether correlations between plasma citrulline levels and disease activity depend on small bowel involvement in patients with CD. RESULTS: The plasma citrulline levels correlated negatively with CRP (r = -0.332, P = 0.008), ESR (r = -0.290, P = 0.022), and PCDAI (r = -0.424, P = 0.001) in patients with CD. The plasma citrulline levels were significantly lower in patients with jejunal involvement than in those without (P = 0.027). In subgroup analysis, patients with CD with jejunal involvement showed significantly negative correlations of plasma citrulline levels with CRP (r = -0.628, P = 0.016) and PCDAI (r = -0.632, P = 0.015); however, patients with CD without jejunal involvement revealed no correlations of plasma citrulline levels with CRP and PCDAI. There were no significant correlations between plasma citrulline levels and simplified endoscopic activity score for CD. There were no significant correlations of plasma citrulline levels with CRP, ESR, and pediatric UC activity index in patients with UC. CONCLUSIONS: Plasma citrulline levels correlated with disease severity as measured by PCDAI, CRP, and ESR in pediatric patients with CD with jejunal involvement.},

   abstract = {OBJECTIVES: Seasonal and geographic variations of inflammatory bowel disease (IBD) exacerbations have been described in adults, with inconsistent findings. We sought to determine whether disease activity in pediatric-onset IBD is associated with a seasonal pattern. METHODS: We examined children with Crohn disease (CD) and ulcerative colitis (UC) using data from the ImproveCareNow Collaborative between December 2008 and November 2010. We compared the proportion of patients in continuous remission for all recorded visits in each season. We also compared the distribution of all recorded visits with a physician global assessment (PGA) of remission or active disease across seasons. RESULTS: A total of 1325 patients with CD (6102 visits) and 587 patients with UC (2394 visits) were included. The proportion of patients with UC in continuous remission during each season was highest in the summer (67%) and lowest in the winter (55%) (P=0.01). A similar pattern was found for CD but was not significant. Similarly, the proportion of visits in remission was highest in the summer and lowest in the winter for both UC (29%, 21%; P<0.001) and CD (28%, 23%; P<0.001); however, the distribution of visits with active disease was not significantly different across seasons. CONCLUSIONS: The higher proportion of patients with UC in continuous remission in the summer may be related to the higher proportion of remission visits in the summer, because the proportion of visits with active disease was similar across seasons. These findings do not support any strong associations between season of the year and disease activity in pediatric IBD.},

   abstract = {BACKGROUND: Crohn's disease is a debilitating chronic inflammatory bowel disease. Appropriate use of diet and nutritional therapy is integral to the overall management strategy of Crohn's disease. The aim was to develop evidence-based guidelines on the dietary management of Crohn's disease in adults. METHODS: Questions relating to the dietary management of Crohn's disease were developed. These included the roles of enteral nutrition to induce remission, food re-introduction diets to structure food re-introduction and maintain remission, and dietary management of stricturing disease, as well as whether probiotics or prebiotics induce or maintain remission. A comprehensive literature search was conducted and relevant studies from January 1985 to November 2009 were identified using the electronic database search engines CINAHL, Cochrane Library, EMBASE, MEDLINE, Scopus and Web of Science. Evidence statements, recommendations, practical considerations and research recommendations were developed. RESULTS: Fifteen research papers were critically appraised and the evidence formed the basis of these guidelines. Although corticosteroids appear to be more effective, enteral nutrition (elemental or non-elemental) can be offered as an alternative option to induce disease remission. After a course of enteral nutrition, food re-introduction diets may be useful to structure food re-introduction and help maintain disease remission. Dietary fibre is contraindicated in the presence of strictures as a result of the risk of mechanical obstruction. The use of probiotics and prebiotics is not currently supported. CONCLUSIONS: As an alternative to corticosteroids, evidence supports enteral nutrition to induce disease remission. Food re-introduction diets provide structure to food re-introduction and help maintain disease remission. These guidelines aim to reduce variation in clinical practice.},

   abstract = {BACKGROUND: Thiopurine immunosuppressants such as 6-mercaptopurine (6-MP) are widely used to maintain remission in children with both Crohn's disease and ulcerative colitis. Therapeutic efficacy is associated with higher red blood cell levels of the thiopurine metabolite 6-thioguanine (6-TGN). Studies in both children and adults have inexplicably failed to demonstrate a significant correlation between prescribed dose and level of 6-TGN. We aimed to quantify the relationship between 6-TGN levels and adherence. METHODS: We used electronic monitoring devices to assess adherence in children and adolescents with inflammatory bowel diseases who were prescribed 6-MP. RESULTS: During 3230 days of monitoring in 19 subjects, adherence to 6-MP was 74.2%. Due to the generally low adherence to the prescribed dose of 6-MP, the 6-TGN level was not correlated with the prescribed dose. The 6-TGN level was significantly correlated with the adherence-adjusted dose (R(2) = 0.395). It was also significantly correlated to adherence alone (R(2) = 0.478). Adherence to 5-aminosalicylic acid and 6-MP were significantly positively correlated (r(s)(9) = 0.82, P = 0.00), and a significant relationship was found between 5-aminosalicylic acid adherence and 6-TGN levels independent of 6-MP adherence. Furthermore, low adherence to 6-MP was associated with increased likelihood of escalation of medical therapy. CONCLUSIONS: Red blood cell 6-TGN levels are strongly correlated with the dose, when the dose is actually taken. Lack of efficacy of thiopurines may often be the result of poor adherence. Novel ways of assessing and improving adherence are necessary. Future trials should assess adherence in study participants. Intake of 5-aminosalicylic acid positively influences 6-TGN levels.},

   abstract = {BACKGROUND: Symptoms of inflammatory bowel disease (IBD) include bloody diarrhea, fatigue, abdominal pain, and weight loss. Long-term management of remission for most patients requires adherence to taking 1 or more oral medications daily, in the absence of symptoms. We investigated whether disease characteristics and behavioral characteristics predict adherence to prescribed medical regimens. METHODS: : Patients aged 8 to 17.5 years, newly diagnosed with IBD, and a matched cohort previously diagnosed were studied over a 6-month period. Adherence was assessed using medication electronic monitoring devices (Medication Event Monitoring Systems); participants and parents completed questionnaires regarding emotional and behavioral functioning, and biological parameters were monitored. RESULTS: : Adherence was monitored for 45 newly and 34 previously diagnosed patients. In total, 16,478 patient-days (including 12,066 discrete days) were electronically monitored. Overall, 70.6% of 5-aminosalicylic acid and 65.4% of 6-mercaptopurine doses were taken. Only 25% and 15% of older adolescents took at least 80% of their 5-aminosalicylic acid and 6-mercaptopurine, respectively, compared with about 83% and 64% of 8-year-olds to 11-year-olds. Only age and behavioral issues were statistically linked to rates of adherence. CONCLUSIONS: Adherence to commonly prescribed oral medications for IBD is challenging for patients. Screening for emotional and behavioral problems, especially among older adolescents, would be important in identifying patients at risk of poor adherence, who might benefit from interventions. Biological solutions, although critical, when applied without attention to behavioral issues, are not likely to provide the level of therapeutic benefit that can be provided in a combined biobehavioral approach.},

   abstract = {Crohn disease (CD) and ulcerative colitis (UC), the two main types of inflammatory bowel disease (IBD), have become increasingly common in Australasian children and adolescents in recent years. Furthermore, CD and UC are seen more often in younger children. These conditions are typically more extensive in children and tend to follow more severe disease courses than in adults. Although many children may present with typical symptoms (such as abdominal pain or bloody diarrhoea), others have atypical features (including oral ulceration, short stature or skin manifestations). In addition, many children with IBD will have altered growth or nutrition, which may compromise normal linear growth and pubertal development. Early identification and full assessment of children presenting with possible IBD are essential to avoid consequences of diagnostic delay and to optimise short- and long-term outcomes. Management of IBD encompasses various options and should be undertaken within a team-based, child and family-focused, multidisciplinary setting.},

   abstract = {Zinc is an essential micronutrient playing fundamental roles in cellular metabolism. It acts mostly through binding a wide range of proteins, thus affecting a broad spectrum of biological processes, which include cell division, growth and differentiation. Full annotation of zinc-binding proteins showed them to represent about 10 % of the human proteome, with over 300 enzymes containing zinc ions within their catalytic domains. Also, hundreds of key regulatory proteins, including transcription factors, require zinc for their activity. In this study, the whole set of zinc-binding proteins together with their direct interactors was listed and defined as the zinc proteome (ZNP). We interrogated pathway analysis tools to identify the cellular processes that are predicted to be affected by zinc availability. Network and functional enrichment analyses highlighted biological processes potentially affected by deregulated zinc homeostasis. This computational approach was also tested on a real case study: The possible involvement of ZNP network proteins in Crohn's disease pathogenesis was assessed on genes transcriptionally regulated in the intestine of patients affected by this condition. The analysis produced a network of pathways likely to be influenced by zinc and associated with Crohn's disease. These results highlight a central role for zinc in the tissue remodeling process which occurs upon gut inflammation, pointing at novel disease pathways whose effect could be worsened by zinc dyshomeostasis and impaired zinc fluxes in specific damaged areas. Overall, our computational approach could provide novel insights into pathological conditions and could therefore be used to drive mechanistic research in under-investigated fields of research. An interactive version of the determined ZNP network is available at URL http://93.63.165.11/ZNnetwork/ .},

   abstract = {BACKGROUND: Definitive diagnosis of pediatric ulcerative colitis (UC) may be particularly challenging since isolated colitis with overlapping features is common in pediatric Crohn's disease (CD), while atypical phenotypes of UC are not uncommon. The Paris classification allows more accurate phenotyping of atypical inflammatory bowel disease (IBD) patients. Our aim was to identify the prevalence of atypical disease patterns in new-onset pediatric UC using the Paris classification. METHODS: Information was collected from the EUROKIDS Registry, an inception cohort of untreated pediatric IBD patients undergoing evaluation at diagnosis. Patients with IBD-unclassified were excluded. Patients with isolated Crohn's colitis served as a control group. RESULTS: Data from 898 pediatric patients (643 UC, 255 CD colitis) were included. Extensive or pancolitis was present in 77% of UC patients and macroscopic rectal sparing in 5%. Rectal sparing was inversely associated with age (mean age with rectal sparing 9.9 years vs. 11.8 without; P = 0.02). Upper gastrointestinal (UGI) involvement occurred in 4% of patients. Erosions in the stomach were present in 3.1% of children, but frank ulcerations in 0.4%; 0.8% of children had erosions or ulcerations limited to the esophagus or duodenum. The corresponding UGI involvement in Crohn's colitis was 22%. A cecal patch occurred in 2% of patients. CONCLUSIONS: Extensive disease and rectal sparing are age-dependent phenotypes in pediatric UC. Rectal sparing, cecal patch, backwash ileitis, and gastric erosions are not uncommon at diagnosis, while gastric ulcerations and erosions in the duodenum or esophagus are. Recognition of atypical phenotypes in pediatric-onset UC is crucial to prevent misclassification of IBD.},

   abstract = {BACKGROUND: The diagnosis of pediatric-onset inflammatory bowel disease (PIBD) can be challenging in choosing the most informative diagnostic tests and correctly classifying PIBD into its different subtypes. Recent advances in our understanding of the natural history and phenotype of PIBD, increasing availability of serological and fecal biomarkers, and the emergence of novel endoscopic and imaging technologies taken together have made the previous Porto criteria for the diagnosis of PIBD obsolete. METHODS: We aimed to revise the original Porto criteria using an evidence-based approach and consensus process to yield specific practice recommendations for the diagnosis of PIBD. These revised criteria are based on the Paris classification of PIBD and the original Porto criteria while incorporating novel data, such as for serum and fecal biomarkers. A consensus of at least 80% of participants was achieved for all recommendations and the summary algorithm. RESULTS: The revised criteria depart from existing criteria by defining 2 categories of ulcerative colitis (UC, typical and atypical); atypical phenotypes of UC should be treated as UC. A novel approach based on multiple criteria for diagnosing IBD-unclassified (IBD-U) is proposed. Specifically, these revised criteria recommend upper gastrointestinal endoscopy and ileocolonscopy for all suspected patients with PIBD, with small bowel imaging (unless typical UC after endoscopy and histology) by magnetic resonance enterography or wireless capsule endoscopy. CONCLUSIONS: These revised Porto criteria for the diagnosis of PIBD have been developed to meet present challenges and developments in PIBD and provide up-to-date guidelines for the definition and diagnosis of the IBD spectrum.},

   abstract = {BACKGROUND: Robust evaluation of induction therapies using both clinical and inflammatory outcomes in pediatric Crohn's disease (CD) are sparse. We attempted to evaluate clinical, inflammatory, and composite outcomes of induction of remission therapies (normal C reactive protein [CRP] remission) in a large pediatric prospective multicenter study. METHODS: Patients enrolled at diagnosis into the growth relapse and outcomes with therapy in Crohn's disease study were evaluated for disease activity, CRP, and fecal calprotectin at 8, 12 and 52 weeks after starting treatment. The primary endpoint was week-12 steroid-free remission defined by pediatric Crohn's disease activity index and CRP <0.5 mg/dL. The protocol required tapering off corticosteroids by week 11. RESULTS: We analyzed 222 patients (mean age, 12.9 +/- 3.2 yr) main evaluated treatment options included: 5-ASA (n = 29), exclusive enteral nutrition (n = 43), and corticosteroids (n = 114). Clinical remission at week 12 was achieved in 155 (73%) patients; both exclusive enteral nutrition and steroids were associated with normal CRP remission at week 12, although in a post hoc subgroup analysis exclusive enteral nutrition was superior in mild-to-moderate disease for this outcome. Among those in steroid-free remission in week 12, normal CRP predicted 1-year sustained remission (86% for normal CRP versus 61% for elevated CRP; P = 0.02). Baseline severity and early immunomodulation were similar in both groups. CONCLUSIONS: Normal CRP steroid-free remission at week 12 was impacted by type of induction therapy, but not by early immunomodulation. It was associated with more corticosteroids-free remission at week 52 and a trend for less relapses.},

   abstract = {Inflammatory bowel disease (IBD), including Crohn's disease (CD) and ulcerative colitis (UC), are chronic debilitating diseases that occur in populations around the world. The underlying etiology is thought to be multifactorial. There is a well-defined genetic contribution to the diseases, but this does not fully explain the epidemiology. Environmental factors, including the composition of the gut microbiota, are also important. There is wide geographic variability in the incidence and prevalence of IBD. High incidence rates have been observed in the United Kingdom, Northern Europe, Canada, and the United States. Globally, there is evidence of increasing incidence of CD and UC over time. The rising incidence of IBD in Western countries has generally predated that in developing nations, supporting the hypothesis that 'Westernization' of our lifestyle has led to the increased incidence of IBD. Smoking, antibiotic use, and diet are potentially reversible risk factors for IBD. Recommendations to avoid smoking are appropriate for all people, for numerous reasons. Antibiotic use should be limited to appropriate indications, a recommendation that too is appropriate for all populations. Detangling the relationship between diet, the gut microbiome and IBD raises the potential to reduce the incidence of IBD through dietary modification, an approach that might be considered among those at the highest risk.},

   abstract = {BACKGROUND/OBJECTIVES: Exclusive enteral nutrition (EEN) has been shown to be effective in the management of Crohn's disease (CD). However, few experiences have been reported regarding its role in postoperative intra-abdominal septic complications (IASCs) after bowel resections for enterocutaneous fistulas (ECFs). Our aim was to investigate the influence of preoperative 3-month EEN on the incidence of IASCs and to clarify the risk factors of IASCs in fistulizing CD. SUBJECTS/METHODS: A retrospective study on 123 CD patients suffering from ECFs was conducted from February 2001 to April 2011. Fifty-five patients (44.7%) received preoperative 3-month EEN. The changes in serum albumin and C-reactive protein (CRP) were compared. Perioperative data were analyzed using logistic regression to identify the independent risk factors affecting the incidence of postoperative IASCs. RESULTS: Patients were similar in gender, age, fistula conditions and perioperative medications in the EEN and non-EEN groups. The EEN group had a significantly higher serum albumin level and lower CRP at operation, and suffered a lower risk of IASCs (3.6% vs 17.6%, P<0.05). Two years after operation when follow-up ended, the two groups had comparable cumulative risk of IASCs (P=0.109). A logistic regression analysis identified age at operation and preoperative EEN as independent risk factors of postoperative IASCs. CONCLUSIONS: Preoperative EEN reduced the risk of postoperative IASCs after operation for ECFs in CD. In addition, age at operation may be another factor of influence.},

   abstract = {BACKGROUND: Mesenteric fat plays an important role in the pathogenesis of Crohn's disease (CD), and a higher ratio of visceral fat area (VFA) to subcutaneous fat area (SFA) is related to complicated disease status. Exclusive enteral nutrition (EEN) is an effective treatment option for patients with CD, and the aims of this study were to assess the effects of EEN on abdominal fat in patients with CD. METHODS: Patient data were obtained from a prospectively maintained database. The SFA and VFA were measured in 38 patients with CD before and after 8-week EEN therapy, and the mesenteric fat index (MFI), defined as the ratio of VFA to SFA, was calculated. The correlations between MFI and CD activity index and C-reactive protein level were also evaluated. RESULTS: The median age of the patients in our study was 29 years, and the median duration of disease was 3.05 years. Both VFA (P = 0.029) and MFI (P = 0.021) were significantly decreased in patients after EEN, but no significant change was observed in SFA (P = 0.335). MFI was significantly correlated with CD activity index (r = 0.523, P = 0.001) and C-reactive protein (r = 0.634, P < 0.0001) in patients with active CD before EEN, although no positive correlations were observed in patients after EEN treatment. CONCLUSIONS: EEN induction therapy was associated with a significant decrease in VFA in patients with CD, and MFI was significantly correlated with CD activity index and C-reactive protein in active CD. Thus, our data reveal additional beneficial therapeutic mechanisms of enteral nutrition treatment in CD.},

   abstract = {PURPOSE: Transforming growth factor beta1 (TGF-beta1) plays a role in cell proliferation and differentiation, and it can modulate immune response. In this work, we asked whether levels of either TGF-beta1 or mRNA of the corresponding gene in plasma or tissue can be useful in diagnosing and/or monitoring of the clinical course of inflammatory bowel diseases (IBD). METHODS: The study group consisted of 104 pediatric patients with IBD: 36 with Crohn's disease (CD) and 68 with ulcerative colitis (UC); 42 children represented the control group. TGF-beta1 levels in plasma and intestinal mucosa were estimated by ELISA and immunohistochemistry (IHC), respectively. Levels of TGF-beta1 mRNA were determined by reverse transcription and real-time PCR. RESULTS: In patients with IBD, and in subgroups with CD and UC, no significant differences in the TGF-beta1 level in plasma and tissue were found relative to the control group. These variables were not dependent on the stage of the disease, its activity or severity of endoscopic and histopathological findings. TGF-beta1 mRNA levels were significantly higher in tissue samples withdrawn during the relapse of the disease than in those taken during the remission or in the control group. However, no correlation between TGF-beta1 plasma levels and TGF-beta1 mRNA amount in the intestinal mucosa was observed. CONCLUSIONS: The TGF-beta1 mRNA level, but not the amount of the gene product, was significantly increased in the pathologically changed tissue during the relapse of IBD. We suggest that this parameter might be considered as a potential prognostic value when assessing IBD in children.},

IBD has been reported an increased prevalence of low bone mass. The aims of the present study were to evaluate the nutritional status and to investigate the correlation between bone mineral density (BMD) and nutrient factors in patients with IBD. METHODS: A total of 41 subjects were classified into normal group (n=21) and malnourished group (n=20) by the subjective global assessment result. We surveyed the dietary habit, nutrient intake, and BMD. RESULTS: Subjects' average age was 36.7 years old, and included 26 ulcerative colitis and 15 Crohn's disease. The serum C-reactive protein (CRP) was significantly higher and serum calcium was significantly lower in the malnourished group. Lower bone density subjects were more in the malnourished group but no significant difference. Intake of energy, protein, carbohydrate, fiber, iron, sodium, potassium, zinc, vitamin B6, vitamin C and folate were significantly lower in the malnourished group. The BMD of malnourished group showed correlation with triceps skin fold thickness (TSF), CRP, dietary calcium, phosphorous, iron, animal iron, zinc and vitamin. CONCLUSIONS: The results suggested that adequate intake of nutrients is important to prevent bone loss and systemic education programs are need for IBD patients.},

   abstract = {OBJECTIVE: To compare factors considered by parents to those considered by adolescents making decisions about chronic disease treatments. METHODS: We conducted individual interviews with 15 parent-adolescent dyads in which the adolescent had either juvenile idiopathic arthritis or Crohn's disease. Questions focused on treatment decisions, with an emphasis on the factors that influenced each individual's preferences related to biologic therapies. A multidisciplinary team developed a coding structure. All interviews were coded by two people with disagreements resolved through discussion. We used content analysis and coding matrices to examine decision factors within and between parent-adolescent dyads. RESULTS: Parents and adolescents both participated in decisions about treatment with biologic therapies but considered decision factors differently. In only half of cases did parents and adolescents agree on the factor that most influenced their decision. Although their decision factors often fell into similar categories (e.g. treatment risks, quality of life), in many cases the specifics varied between adolescents and their parents. Adolescents were more likely to focus on immediate treatment effects and quality of life while parents took a longer term view of the decision. Agreement within dyads was most consistent when a special circumstance influenced the treatment decision. CONCLUSIONS: Differences regarding influential decision factors exist within parent-adolescent dyads. Continued research is needed to determine the extent to which such differences are due to individual preferences or to variations in the information available to each person. Future decision support interventions will need to address parents' and adolescents' potentially disparate views and information needs.},

   abstract = {OBJECTIVE: The aim of the study was to describe parents' experiences and the information used when making decisions about tumor necrosis factor-alpha inhibitor (TNFalphai) treatment. METHODS: We interviewed parents of children with Crohn disease (CD) or juvenile idiopathic arthritis who had experience deciding about TNFalphai treatment. Interview questions focused on information used to make decisions and factors that influenced decision making. We used thematic analysis for all coding and analysis. Coding structure was developed by a multidisciplinary team review of the initial interviews. Two coders then coded the remaining interviews, compared coding, and resolved disagreements through discussion. Data were analyzed by thematic grouping and then compared between diseases. RESULTS: We interviewed 35 parents. For nearly all parents the decision about TNFalphai treatment was the most challenging medical decision they had made; however, parents of children with CD experienced more stress and anxiety than did other parents. Both groups of parents sought information from multiple sources including health care providers, the Internet, and social contacts. They looked for information related to treatment effectiveness, adverse effects, and other individuals' treatment experiences. In CD, information was used to help make the decision, whereas in juvenile idiopathic arthritis it was used to confirm the decision. CONCLUSIONS: The decision-making experience, and associated information seeking, leaves some parents with long-lasting concerns and worry about TNFalphai treatment. Providing parents with structured decision-making support may lead to more effective and efficient decision making, decreased psychosocial distress, and, ultimately, improved outcomes for their children.},

   abstract = {BACKGROUND: Anemia is a common and serious complication in patients with inflammatory bowel disease. The present study was dedicated to evaluate the therapeutic efficacy of erythropoietin (EPO) combined with enteral nutrition (EN) in anemic Crohn's disease (CD) patients, in terms of hemoglobin level, treatment success rate, adverse events, and predictor of this therapy. MATERIALS AND METHODS: We performed a prospective study in CD patients. On the basis of hemoglobin level, all enrolled patients were divided into anemic and nonanemic groups. The anemic group was further divided into EPO and non-EPO subgroups, depending on whether EPO was prescribed. Hematological and other parameters were measured initially and in the first 4 weeks after starting treatment. RESULTS: In total, 109 patients (49 nonanemic and 60 anemic, including 38 EPO and 22 non-EPO) were included. The prevalence of anemia in CD was 55.05%. Age, disease behavior, Crohn's Disease Activity Index scores, C-reactive protein, and erythrocyte sedimentation rate were significantly different between anemic and nonanemic groups. An increase in hemoglobin level and a significant decrease in C-reactive protein level were observed in the EPO treatment group. Treatment success rate was 63.16% in the EPO group, whereas none of patients achieved treatment success in the non-EPO group. CONCLUSION: EPO combined with EN can improve the hemoglobin level in anemic CD patients.},

   abstract = {GOALS: This study was designed to investigate the clinical features of nonthyroidal illness syndrome (NTIS) compared with euthyroid patients in Crohn's disease (CD), to explore the etiology of NTIS in CD, to evaluate the clinical outcomes of NTIS patients, and to inspect the correlation of clinical variables and NTIS, and their ability of differentiating NTIS from euthyroid patients. BACKGROUND: NTIS has been described for more than 30 years. However, only few studies focused on the relationship between NTIS and CD. The incidence, underlying pathogenesis, clinical outcomes, and correlation with other inflammatory disease severity and nutritional variables of NTIS in CD have not been completely established. METHODS: Prospectively, 44 CD patients were enrolled. Medical records and various laboratory values (including thyroidal, nutritional, and inflammatory variables) were collected in all participants. RESULTS: The incidence of NTIS in CD was 36.4%. Albumin, Acute Physiology and Chronic Health Evaluation II score, and Crohn's Disease Activity Index score in NTIS group were statistically different from those in euthyroid group. A decreased sum activity of deiodinases and a reduced ratio of TT4/FT4 were observed in NTIS group. Duration of hospitalization was significantly longer for NTIS patients than euthyroid patients. Albumin was confirmed as a protective factor of NTIS in CD. Receiver operating characteristic curve analysis demonstrated the differentiating capacity of albumin, suggesting 37.6 g/L as optimal cut-off value with sensitivity and specificity of 81.3% and 79.2%, respectively. CONCLUSIONS: NTIS was a common complication in CD. NTIS patients showed worse nutrition status and clinical outcome, and more critical disease activity and severity compared with euthyroid patients. A hypodeiodination condition and a potential thyroid-hormone-binding dysfunction may play a role in the etiology of NTIS in CD. Albumin was a meaningful protective and distinguishing marker of NTIS in CD.},

   abstract = {BACKGROUND: Nutritional assessment and dietary intervention, particularly enteral nutrition, are important in the management of Crohn's disease (CD). National audits have reported that dietetic resourcing in gastroenterology is inadequate. The present study aimed to identify current practice in the nutritional assessment and dietary management of enteral nutrition in CD, as well as investigate the factors that influenced it. METHODS: A nationwide questionnaire survey adopting complete population sampling of all 296 U.K. acute hospitals was undertaken aiming to determine dietetic resourcing for gastroenterology. In addition, the case-note review method was used to investigate approaches to nutritional assessment and dietary management of enteral nutrition as treatment for active CD. RESULTS: Data were returned from 149 (56%) hospitals, providing assessment and management information on 190 patients. The median number of dietetic sessions dedicated to gastroenterology was 2 per week (interquartile range 4). Hospitals with five or more sessions per week dedicated to gastroenterology used a greater number of components in their nutritional assessment [mean (SD) 21.5 ( 5.0)] than those with fewer sessions [mean (SD) 19.6 (SD) 6.1, P = 0.05]. Enteral nutrition was perceived to be effective in 100 (55%) of 182 patients. The major reasons for limited success were poor compliance and inadequate volumes consumed, as well as insufficient treatment duration. CONCLUSIONS: The components included in a nutritional assessment of CD patients are significantly lower in hospitals with fewer dietetic gastroenterology sessions. Focus on improving compliance and duration of enteral nutrition is urgently required to maximise the success of enteral nutrition in the treatment of CD.},

   abstract = {BACKGROUND: Crohn's disease (CD) and ulcerative colitis (UC) diagnosis requires comprehensive examination of the patient. Faecalibacterium prausnitzii and Escherichia coli have been reported as representatives of Inflammatory Bowel Disease (IBD) dysbiosis. The aim was to determine whether or not quantification of these species can be used as a complementary tool either for diagnostic or prognostic purposes. METHODS: Mucosa-associated F. prausnitzii and E. coli abundance was determined in 28 controls (H), 45 CD, 28 UC patients and 10 irritable bowel syndrome (IBS) subjects by quantitative polymerase chain reaction (qPCR) and the F. prausnitzii-E. coli index (F-E index) was calculated. Species abundances were normalized to total bacteria and human cells. Data was analyzed taking into account patients' phenotype and most relevant clinical characteristics. RESULTS: IBD patients had lower F. prausnitzii abundance than H and IBS (P<0.001). CD patients showed higher E. coli counts than H and UC patients (P<0.001). The F-E index discriminated between H, CD and UC patients, and even between disease phenotypes that are usually difficult to distinguish as ileal-CD (I-CD) from ileocolonic-CD and colonic-CD from extensive colitis. E. coli increased in active CD patients, and remission in I-CD patients was compromised by high abundance of this species. Treatment with anti-tumor necrosis factor (TNF) alpha diminished E. coli abundance in I-CD whereas none of the treatments counterbalanced F. prausnitzii depletion. CONCLUSION: F. prausnitzii and E. coli are useful indicators to assist in IBD phenotype classification. The abundance of these species could also be used as a supporting prognostic tool in I-CD patients. Our data indicates that current medication does not restore the levels of these two species to those found in a healthy gut.},

   abstract = {The vast majority of patients with inflammatory bowel disease (IBD) will receive immunosuppressive therapy at some point for their disease, whether for the short term (such as a course of corticosteroids) or long term (such as maintenance therapy with immunomodulators or biologics). The systemic immunosuppression places patients at increased risk for infections. Therefore, it is important that patients are up-to-date with immunizations to minimize vaccine-preventable infections. However, the literature shows that the rate of immunization in patients with IBD is low. Ideally, the vaccination status is checked at diagnosis, and patients are immunized with the vaccines they need. Drawing titers is helpful in cases in which vaccination history is unclear or to confirm that titers are at an adequate level in cases in which patients have been vaccinated. Current guidelines recommend that patients with IBD follow the same routine immunization schedule as healthy children, but patients should not be administered live vaccines if they are receiving immunosuppressive therapy. Therefore, it is ideal to administer any necessary vaccinations as early as possible, prior to starting immunosuppressive therapy. Patients may receive inactivated vaccines regardless of immunosuppressive status. The IBD literature suggests that inactivated vaccines are safe and do not worsen disease activity. In general, patients with IBD mount an immune response to vaccines, but the response may be lower if patients are receiving immunosuppressive therapy, especially tumor necrosis factor inhibitors.},

   abstract = {OBJECTIVE: Bacteria play an important role in the onset and perpetuation of intestinal inflammation in inflammatory bowel disease (IBD). Unlike in Crohn's disease (CD), in which dysbiosis has been better characterised, in ulcerative colitis (UC), only small cohorts have been studied and showed conflicting data. Therefore, we evaluated in a large cohort if the microbial signature described in CD is also present in UC, and if we could characterise predominant dysbiosis in UC. To assess the functional impact of dysbiosis, we quantified the bacterial metabolites. DESIGN: The predominant microbiota from 127 UC patients and 87 age and sex-matched controls was analysed using denaturing gradient gel electrophoresis (DGGE) analysis. Differences were quantitatively validated using real-time PCR. Metabolites were quantified using gas chromatography-mass spectrometry. RESULTS: Based on DGGE analysis, the microbial signature previously described in CD was not present in UC. Real-time PCR analysis revealed a lower abundance of Roseburia hominis (p<0.0001) and Faecalibacterium prausnitzii (p<0.0001) in UC patients compared to controls. Both species showed an inverse correlation with disease activity. Short-chain fatty acids (SCFA) were reduced in UC patients (p=0.014), but no direct correlation between SCFA and the identified bacteria was found. CONCLUSIONS: The composition of the fecal microbiota of UC patients differs from that of healthy individuals: we found a reduction in R hominis and F prausnitzii, both well-known butyrate-producing bacteria of the Firmicutes phylum. These results underscore the importance of dysbiosis in IBD but suggest that different bacterial species contribute to the pathogenesis of UC and CD.},

   abstract = {PURPOSE: The incidence of incisional surgical site infections (SSIs) is reported to be higher among patients with Crohn's disease (CD) than among those with colorectal cancer. It has also been reported that the preoperative nutritional and inflammatory status is associated with the frequency of postoperative complications. Onodera's prognostic nutritional index (OPNI) is a simple and useful parameter for determining the nutritional and inflammatory status. In the present study, we retrospectively investigated the correlation between the OPNI and the incidence of incisional SSI in patients with CD who had undergone bowel resection. METHODS: A total of 177 CD patients who underwent abdominal surgery were enrolled. Various clinical factors and the OPNI values were evaluated to identify risk factors for incisional SSIs. RESULTS: The incidence of incisional SSIs was 19.8 %. A multivariate analysis indicated that the OPNI was an independent risk factor for incisional SSIs. CONCLUSIONS: The results of this retrospective study suggest that the OPNI is an independent risk factor for incisional SSIs in patients with a history of bowel resection for CD.},

   abstract = {CONTEXT AND OBJECTIVES: Focally enhanced gastritis and macrophage microaggregates are found in the upper gastrointestinal involvement of Crohn's disease, and may reflect an underlying defective innate immunity. These features, however, are also described in patients with Helicobacter pylori infection. The role of these gastric abnormalities in the diagnosis of Crohn's disease was assessed in a population with high prevalence of H. pylori infection. METHODS: Thirty-seven Crohn's disease, 26 ulcerative colitis, and 30 control patients were included. The H. pylori status was evaluated by the rapid urease test and histology. The presence of focally enhanced gastritis and macrophage microaggregates was recorded. RESULTS: Focally enhanced gastritis was present in 24% of Crohn's disease patients, 4% of ulcerative colitis patients and 11.5% of controls, presenting an overall sensitivity and specificity for Crohn's disease of 24% and 88%, respectively. Macrophage microaggregates were found in all groups, but were only detected in ulcerative colitis and controls in association with H. pylori infection, with an overall sensitivity and specificity for Crohn's disease of 61% and 69%, respectively. In the absence of H. pylori infection, focally enhanced gastritis and macrophage microaggregates were significantly associated with Crohn's disease (P<0.02 and P = 0.001 respectively). CONCLUSIONS: Focally gastritis and macrophage microaggregates are suggestive of Crohn's disease only in H. pylori-negative specimens.},

   abstract = {BACKGROUND AND AIMS: The cellular mechanisms leading to infliximab therapy response in patients with ulcerative colitis (UC) are incompletely known. We therefore investigated early effects of infliximab therapy on monocytes and associated chemokines linked to clinical therapy response in UC patients. METHODS: Blood and biopsies were obtained from anti-TNF therapy-naive UC patients (n = 43) before (baseline) and during induction therapy with infliximab. Therapy response was evaluated at Week 14. Expression of monocyte activation markers and levels of chemokines in serum and biopsies were determined. Quantitative proteomic analysis was performed in cultured mucosal biopsies, and obtained data was validated in serum. RESULTS: In therapy responders, but not in non-responders, infliximab reduced blood monocyte expression of CD14 and CD86, 2 weeks after therapy commenced, relative to baseline. Serum CCL2 levels were decreased only among therapy responders at Week 2 and Week 14, relative to baseline. These data corresponded with lower levels of CD14, CD86 and CCL2 in intestinal tissue in responders as compared with non-responders at Week 14. Proteomic analysis of cultured biopsies showed that infliximab induced a reduction in Tenascin C that predicted downregulation of CCL2. Therapy responders, but not non-responders, had decreased serum Tenascin C levels at Week 2 and Week 14, relative to baseline. CONCLUSIONS: Infliximab therapy response in UC patients is associated with reduced monocyte activation and serum levels of CCL2 2 weeks after therapy commencement. In therapy responders, infliximab influenced Tenascin C, which might be a regulator of CCL2 expression and important for induction of the clinical therapy response.},

Overall, healthcare delivery for patients with CD is not optimal at the present time and therefore needs improvement. There are evidences which suggest that there is a variation in the care provided to patients with CD by the inflammatory bowel disease (IBD) experts and community care providers. The delivery of healthcare for patients with CD is often complex and requires coordination between gastroenterologists/IBD specialist, gastrointestinal surgeon, radiologists and IBD nurses. In order to improve the quality of health care for patients with CD, there is need that we focus on large-scale, system-wide changes including creation of IBD comprehensive care units, provision to provide continuous care, efforts to standardize care, and education of the community practitioners.},

   abstract = {OBJECTIVES: A sharp increase in paediatric (younger than 16 years) inflammatory bowel disease (IBD) incidence was observed in northern Stockholm County, Sweden, in 1990-2001. The increasing incidence was primarily explained by a rising incidence of Crohn disease (CD). Here, we present an update on the trends in incidence of paediatric IBD, 2002-2007. METHOD: Medical records of all children diagnosed as having suspected IBD in northern Stockholm County, 2002-2007, were scrutinised using defined diagnostic criteria. Disease extension, localisation, and behaviour at diagnosis were classified within the framework of the Paris classification. RESULT: A total of 133 children were diagnosed as having IBD 2002-2007 corresponding to a sex- and age-standardised incidence (per 10 person-years) for paediatric IBD of 12.8 (95% CI 10.8-15.2). The standardised incidence was 9.2 (95% CI 7.5-11.2) for CD and 2.8 (95% CI 1.9-4.0) for ulcerative colitis (UC). A significant increasing incidence of UC (P < 0.05) was observed during the study period. No temporal trend was observed for the incidence of CD. CONCLUSIONS: The incidence rate of paediatric IBD in northern Stockholm was significantly higher in 2002-2007 than that observed in our earlier study covering 1990-2001. The former sharp increase in incidence of paediatric CD seems, however, to have levelled out, although at a higher rate than reported from most other regions in the world. Although CD was still predominant, the observed increase in incidence of UC during the study period is notable.},

   abstract = {During nutrient deprivation, autophagy provides the constituents required to maintain the metabolism essential for survival. Recently, genome-wide association studies have identified genetic determinants for susceptibility to Crohn's disease (CD) such as ATG16L1 and IRGM that are involved in the autophagy pathway. Both disease-carrying NOD2 mutations and ATG16L1 mutations may result in impairment of autophagy. Impairment in autophagy results in impaired clearance of microbes. Ileal CD is associated with Paneth cell loss of function such as decreased production of alpha-defensins, which may arise from mutations in NOD2 or autophagy genes. Nutrients are able to modify several cellular pathways and in particular autophagy. We summarize the contribution of a variety of dietary components to activate autophagy. Understanding the crosstalk between nutrients and autophagy in the intestine may provide novel targets that have therapeutics potential in intestinal inflammation. Nutrient activation of autophagy may contribute to restoring the Paneth cell loss of function in ileal CD.},

   abstract = {BACKGROUND: Inflammation is an essential immune response; however, chronic inflammation results in disease including Crohn's disease. Therefore, reducing the inflammation can yield a significant health benefit, and one way to achieve this is through diet. We developed a Mediterranean-inspired anti-inflammatory diet and used this diet in a 6-week intervention in a Crohn's disease population. We examined changes in inflammation and also in the gut microbiota. We compared the results of established biomarkers, C-reactive protein and the micronuclei assay, of inflammation with results from a transcriptomic approach. RESULTS: Data showed that being on our diet for 6 weeks was able to reduce the established biomarkers of inflammation. However, using transcriptomics, we observed significant changes in gene expression. Although no single gene stood out, the cumulative effect of small changes in many genes combined to have a beneficial effect. Data also showed that our diet resulted in a trend of normalising the microbiota. CONCLUSIONS: This study showed that our Mediterranean-inspired diet appeared to benefit the health of people with Crohn's disease. Our participants showed a trend for reduced markers of inflammation and normalising of the microbiota. The significant changes in gene expression after 6 weeks highlighted the increased sensitivity of using transcriptomics when compared to the established biomarkers and open up a new era of dietary intervention studies.},

   abstract = {Inflammatory bowel diseases (IBD) such as Crohn's disease (CD) or ulcerative colitis are chronic intestinal disorders, which are on the increase in "Westernised" countries. IBD can be caused by both genetic and environmental factors. Interleukin-10 (IL-10) is an immunoregulatory cytokine that has been identified as being involved in several diseases including IBD. Studies have shown that polymorphisms in the promoter region reduce serum levels of IL-10 and this reduction has been associated with some forms of IBD. Mouse models have shown promising results with IL-10 supplementation, as such IL-10 supplementation has been touted as being a possible alternative treatment for CD in humans. Clinical trials have shown that recombinant human IL-10 is safe and well tolerated up to a dose of 8 mug/kg. However, to date, the results of the clinical trials have been disappointing. Although CD activity was reduced as measured by the CD activity index, IL-10 supplementation did not result in significantly reduced remission rates or clinical improvements when compared to placebo. This review discusses why IL-10 supplementation is not effective in CD patients currently and what can be addressed to potentially make IL-10 supplementation a more viable treatment option in the future. Based on the current research we conclude that IL-10 supplementation is not a one size fits all treatment and if the correct population of patients is chosen then IL-10 supplementation could be of benefit.},

   abstract = {BACKGROUND: Currently, the only treatment for celiac disease (CD) is a lifelong gluten-free diet (GFD). Research has been carried out in various countries into the nutritional adequacy of the GFD in terms of macro- and micronutrients, mostly presenting conflicting results. However, no data for Germany are available to date. AIM: To elucidate the nutritional composition of a GFD and to compare it with non-GFD in a representative German non-CD population. METHODS AND PATIENTS: A total of 1,000 patients who were members of the German Celiac Society (DZG) were invited to fill out a prospective 7-day food diary and a questionnaire. Data from 88 patients aged 14-80 years were analyzed and compared to the DACH reference values and to data from the German National Diet and Nutrition Survey (NVS II). RESULTS: No significant difference was observed for the intake of energy and macronutrients in male celiac patients compared to the NVS II. Only the fiber intake of male patients was significantly lower than that of the general population. Female patients, however, showed a significantly higher fat intake, but lower carbohydrate consumption. The average daily micronutrient intake of male and female patients, specifically of vitamin B1, B2, B6, folic acid, magnesium and iron, was significantly lower in celiac patients compared to the NVS II. CONCLUSION: This study reveals inadequate nutrient intake by male and female celiac patients in Germany. Based on our findings, regular (laboratory) monitoring of celiac patients should be recommended.},

   abstract = {BACKGROUND: The abundance of Faecalibacterium prausnitzii, an abundant and representative bacterium of Firmicutes phylum, has consistently been observed to be lower in patients with Crohn's disease than in healthy individuals. We have shown that both F. prausnitzii and its culture supernatant (SN) have anti-inflammatory and protective effects in a TNBS-induced acute colitis mouse model. Here, we tested the effects of both F. prausnitzii and its SN in moderate and severe DNBS-induced chronic colitis mouse models. METHODS: Colitis was induced by intrarectal administration of DNBS. After either 4 or 10 days of recovery (severe and moderate protocols, respectively), groups of mice were intragastrically administered either with F. prausnitzii A2-165 or with its culture SN for 7 or 10 days. Three days before being sacrificed, colitis was reactivated by administration of a lower dose of DNBS. The severity of colitis at the time of being sacrificed was assessed by weight loss and macroscopic and microscopic scores. Myeloperoxidase (MPO) activity, cytokine levels, lymphocyte populations, and changes in microbiota were studied. RESULTS: Intragastric administration of either F. prausnitzii or its SN led to a significant decrease in colitis severity in both severe and moderate chronic colitis models. The lower severity of colitis was associated with down-regulation of MPO, pro-inflammatory cytokines, and T-cell levels. CONCLUSIONS: We show, for the first time, protective effects of both F. prausnitzii and its SN during both the period of recovery from chronic colitis and colitis reactivation. These results provide further evidence that F. prausnitzii is an anti-inflammatory bacterium with therapeutic potential for patients with inflammatory bowel disease.},

However, restorative procedures that help to avoid a permanent stoma are being used with more frequency.

Factors that may influence one's decision to perform these procedures, such as patient age and nutritional status, medical comorbidities, sphincter function, desire to avoid a permanent ostomy, and prior medical therapy, will be discussed. Functional outcomes regarding these procedures will also be described. One should keep in mind that surgery does not cure Crohn disease and that postoperative long-term management is essential in preventing progression or recurrence of disease.},

Our aim was to describe the changing pattern of pediatric IBD incidence in Spain in the last 14 years. METHODS: A retrospective survey of patients diagnosed below 18 years of age in the period 1996-2009 was performed. Patients' data were obtained from the hospitals' databases. To avoid reduced accrual of cases diagnosed by adult physicians, adult IBD units in referral centers were invited to participate. Seventy-eight centers participated in our survey. Rates of incidence were calculated using age-stratified population-based epidemiologic data. Incidence rates were compared for the last 14 years (1996-2009). RESULTS: In total, data from 2107 patients were obtained: 1,165 Crohn's disease (CD, 55.3%), 788 ulcerative colitis (UC, 37.4%), and 154 IBD unclassified. The sex distribution was 56.4% male, with higher predominance for CD (59.3%) as compared to UC (52.8%) and IBD unclassified (53.2%) (P = 0.012). The median age at diagnosis was 12.3 years (p25-75 9.7-14.6) with significant differences between diseases. IBD incidence increased from 0.97 to 2.8/100,000 inhabitants <18 years/year in the study period. Although this increase is more evident for CD (from 0.53 to 1.7), UC has also risen considerably (0.39 to 0.88). CONCLUSIONS: This is the first attempt to calculate the current incidence of pediatric IBD in Spain. A significant increase of incidence rates in the study period was observed. In the last 14 years pediatric IBD incidence has almost tripled, with a more important CD increase.},

Median (IQR) age at diagnosis was 12.9 (10.0-15.7) years, with significant differences among IBD subtypes: CD: 13.1 (10.8-16.0) vs UC: 12.4 (9.4-15.1) vs IBDU: 7.5 (3.0-13.0) (p</=0.001). These results are significantly different to the ones in the SPIRIT registry, with a higher proportion of IBDU, younger age and male predominance. The data from both periods taken together give a complete picture of a 25-year period. An annual increase of incident patients was observed, with a ten-fold increase over this period. CONCLUSION: These data extend the epidemiological trends to a full 25-year period (1985-2009). PIBD incidence in Spain has experienced a sixteen-fold increase. The IBD subtype, localization of the affected segment, age- and sex distribution observed are in accordance with our previously published ones of 1996-2009.},

   abstract = {BACKGROUND & AIMS: Malnutrition is common in inflammatory bowel diseases (IBD), mainly in Crohn's disease (CD) because the small bowel is primarily affected. We reviewed the literature to highlight the importance of proper nutrition management. METHODS: A PubMed search was performed for English-language publications from 1999 through 2012. Manuscripts comparing nutritional approaches for IBD patients were selected. RESULTS: We identified 2025 manuscripts: six meta-analyses, 170 clinical-trials, 692 reviews. The study findings are discordant. In adult CD, enteral nutrition plays a supportive role, steroid therapy remaining the first choice treatment. In CD children enteral nutrition may represent the primary therapy. As regards parenteral nutrition, there are no large randomized studies, although mild improvements in morbidity have been described as a result of parenteral nutrition in malnourished surgical IBD patients. Specific micronutrient deficiencies are common in IBD. A number of factors may contribute to micronutrient deficiencies, and these include: dietary restriction, disease activity and surgery. The possible therapeutic roles of omega-3 fatty-acids, probiotics and prebiotics have been studied, but the results are still preliminary. CONCLUSION: Protein-energy malnutrition and micronutrient depletion are clinical concerns in IBD patients. Enteral nutrition, parenteral nutrition and micronutrient supplementation are cornerstone of the multidisciplinary management of IBD patients.},

   abstract = {Since the introduction of biological therapy, endoscopic and histological remission, i.e. mucosal healing, has become an important therapeutic goal in Crohn's Disease and Ulcerative Colitis. Mucosal healing is associated with lower rates of hospitalization and surgery, although its role in preventing progression and changing the natural history of the disease has not been clearly demonstrated. A precise definition of mucosal healing has not yet been established, although the concept used in clinical trials is the "complete absence of all inflammatory and ulcerative lesions in all segments of gut" at endoscopy. This definition does not include mucosal improvement and does not distinguish among grades of mucosal healing. In both Crohn's Disease and Ulcerative Colitis trials, several qualitative and quantitative numeric endoscopic indices have been proposed to measure and distinguish endoscopic changes. In addition, the microscopic features associated with inflammatory bowel diseases are considerably modified by the course of the disease and the treatments adopted. However, it is not yet clear whether microscopic healing should be a primary endpoint in clinical trials. In this paper we discuss endoscopic and histological findings and the limitations of the endoscopic and histological indices as a basis for a standardised diagnosis of mucosal healing.},

   abstract = {BACKGROUND: Although a dysbiosis of the intestinal microbiome plays a role in the pathogenesis of Crohn's disease (CD), the functional implication is unclear. We sought to determine the influence of fecal supernatant from patients with CD on innate immune function in neutrophil, macrophage, and epithelial cells. Metabolomic analysis was subsequently performed in an attempt to identify potential compounds responsible for the effects identified. METHODS: In the fecal samples from 11 pediatric patients with CD and 10 healthy controls, 16S ribosomal and metabolomic analyses were performed. We evaluated the effect of preincubation with fecal supernatant on neutrophil, macrophage, epithelial cell survival, superoxide production, bacterial invasion, and/or bactericidal function using gentamicin protection assay. Ten substances identified as most elevated in CD compared with control samples by metabolomic analysis were similarly tested for effect on bactericidal function. RESULTS: There were no statistically significant differences in microbial membership in fecal samples from patients with CD compared with healthy controls. However, bactericidal function was impaired in neutrophils and monocytes preincubated with supernatant from fecal samples from patients with CD. Although levels of many metabolites were noted to be altered in samples from patients with CD, the combination of the 10 most elevated compounds failed to demonstrate any effect on neutrophil bactericidal capacity. CONCLUSIONS: Fecal supernatant from patients with CD impairs intracellular bactericidal activity in neutrophils and macrophages. The functional consequences of the intestinal microbiome and its associated secreted products on innate immune function may be more critical than microbial membership in understanding the pathophysiology of CD.},

   abstract = {OBJECTIVE: Repetitive interaction with microbial stimuli renders epithelial cells (ECs) hyporesponsive to microbial stimulation. Previously, we have reported that buccal ECs from a subset of paediatric patients with Crohn's disease are not hyporesponsive and spontaneously released chemokines. We now aimed to identify kinetics and mechanisms of acquisition of hyporesponsiveness to microbial stimulation using primary human buccal epithelium. DESIGN: Buccal ECs collected directly after birth and in later stages of life were investigated. Chemokine release and regulatory signalling pathways were studied using primary buccal ECs and the buccal EC line TR146. Findings were extended to the intestinal mucosa using murine model systems. RESULTS: Directly after birth, primary human buccal ECs spontaneously produced the chemokine CXCL-8 and were responsive to microbial stimuli. Within the first weeks of life, these ECs attained hyporesponsiveness, associated with inactivation of the NF-kappaB pathway and upregulation of the novel NF-kappaB inhibitor SLPI but no other known NF-kappaB inhibitors. SLPI protein was abundant in the cytoplasm and the nucleus of hyporesponsive buccal ECs. Knock-down of SLPI in TR146-buccal ECs induced loss of hyporesponsiveness with increased NF-kappaB activation and subsequent chemokine release. This regulatory mechanism extended to the intestine, as colonisation of germfree mice elicited SLPI expression in small intestine and colon. Moreover, SLPI-deficient mice had increased chemokine expression in small intestinal and colonic ECs. CONCLUSIONS: We identify SLPI as a new player in acquisition of microbial hyporesponsiveness by buccal and intestinal epithelium in the first weeks after microbial colonisation.},

   abstract = {BACKGROUND: Vitamin D deficiency and low bone mineral density (BMD) are complications of inflammatory bowel disease. Vitamin D deficiency is more prevalent among African Americans compared with whites. There are little data comparing differences in serum 25-hydroxyvitamin D (25OHD) concentrations and BMD between African American and white children with Crohn disease (CD). METHODS: We compared serum 25OHD concentrations of African American children with CD (n = 52) to white children with CD (n = 64) and healthy African American controls (n = 40). We also analyzed BMD using dual-energy x-ray absorptiometry results from our pediatric CD population. RESULTS: African American children with CD had lower serum 25OHD concentrations (16.1 [95% confidence interval, CI 14.5-17.9] ng/mL) than whites with CD (22.3 [95% CI 20.2-24.6] ng/mL; P < 0.001). African Americans with CD and controls exhibited similar serum 25OHD concentration (16.1 [95% CI 14.5-17.9] vs 16.3 [95% CI 14.4-18.4] ng/mL; NS). African Americans with CD exhibited no difference in serum 25OHD concentration when controlling for seasonality, disease severity, and surgical history, although serum 25OHD concentration was significantly decreased in overweight children (body mass index >/=85%, P = 0.003). Multiple regression analysis demonstrated that obese African American girls with CD had the lowest serum 25OHD concentrations (9.6 [95% CI 6.8-13.5] ng/mL). BMD was comparable between African American and white children with CD (z score -0.4 +/- 0.9 vs -0.7 +/- 1.2; NS). CONCLUSIONS: African American children with CD are more likely to have vitamin D deficiency compared with white children with CD, but have similar BMD. CD disease severity and history of surgery do not affect serum 25OHD concentrations among African American children with CD. African American children have low serum 25OHD concentrations, independent of CD, compared with white children. Future research should focus on how race affects vitamin D status and BMD in children with CD.},

   abstract = {BACKGROUND AND AIMS: Few studies have specifically examined models of care in IBD. This survey was designed to help gather information from health professionals working in IBD services on current care models, and their views on how to best reshape existing models for IBD care worldwide. METHODS: An online mixed-methods survey was conducted with health professionals caring for IBD patients. Recruitment was conducted using the snowballing technique, where members of professional networks of the investigators were invited to participate. Results of the survey were summarised using descriptive statistics. RESULTS: Of the 135 included respondents, 76 (56%) were female, with a median age of 44 (range: 23-69) years, 50% were GI physicians, 34% nurses, 8% psychologists, 4% dieticians, 2% surgeons, 1% psychiatrists, and 1% physiotherapists. Overall, 73 (54%) respondents considered their IBD service to apply the integrated model of care, and only 5% reported that they worked exclusively using the biomedical care (no recognition of psychosocial factors). The majority of respondents reported including mental health assessment in their standard IBD care (65%), 51% believed that an ideal IBD service should be managed in specialist led clinics, and 64% wanted the service to be publicly funded. Respondents pictured an ideal IBD service as easy-access fully multi-disciplinary, with a significant role for IBD nurses and routine psychological and nutritional assessment and care. CONCLUSIONS: Health care professionals believe that an ideal IBD service should: be fully integrated, involve significant roles of nurses, psychologists and dieticians, run in specialist clinics, be easily accessible to patients and publicly funded.},

   abstract = {BACKGROUND: Neutrophil expression of the Fcgamma receptor I (CD64) is upregulated in adult patients with clinically active inflammatory bowel disease (IBD). We tested the relationship of CD64 with mucosal inflammation and clinical relapse in pediatric Crohn's disease (CD). METHODS: In a cohort of 208 newly diagnosed CD and 43 non-IBD controls, ileal expression of FcgammaRI/S100A9 was determined by RNA sequencing from biopsies obtained at ileocolonoscopy. In a second cohort, we tested for the peripheral blood polymorphonuclear neutrophil (PMN) CD64 index from 26 newly diagnosed CD, 30 non-IBD controls, and 83 children with established CD. RESULTS: Ileal FcgammaRIA mRNA expression was significantly elevated in CD at diagnosis compared with non-IBD controls (P < 0.001), and correlated with ileal S100A9 (calprotectin) expression (r = 0.83, P < 0.001). The median (range) PMN CD64 index for newly diagnosed CD was 2.3 (0.74-9.3) compared with 0.76 (0.39-1.2) for non-IBD controls (P < 0.001) with 96% sensitivity and 90% specificity at the cut point of 1.0. The PMN CD64 index significantly correlated with mucosal injury as measured by the simple endoscopic score for CD (r = 0.62, P < 0.001). Patients with CD in clinical remission receiving maintenance therapy with a PMN CD64 index <1.0 had a sustained remission rate of 95% over the following 12 months compared with 56% in those with a PMN CD64 index >1.0 (P < 0.01). CONCLUSIONS: An elevated PMN CD64 index is associated with both mucosal inflammation and an increased risk for clinical relapse in pediatric CD. The PMN CD64 index is a reliable marker for sustained remission in patients with CD receiving maintenance therapy.},

   abstract = {Inflammatory bowel disease (IBD) comprises the principal subtypes Crohn's disease (CD) and ulcerative colitis (UC), with a fraction remaining as IBD unclassified (IBDU). Given the complexity of IBD manifestations in a patient over time and our increasing understanding of IBD biology, a modification in subtype diagnosis can also occur. Herein is a case of a 27-year-old female with well-controlled and long-standing pan-UC, who developed Crohn's-like esophagogastroduodenitis. The difficulty in classifying IBD into a single traditional subtype, and the debated presentation of a coexistent IBD will be discussed.},

   abstract = {BACKGROUND & AIMS: Appetite disturbance is an important nutritional issue in Crohn's disease (CD), but the biological basis is unclear. Satiety signals such as polypeptide YY (PYY) and glucagon-like peptide-1 (GLP-1) are produced by enteroendocrine cells (EEC). In animal models, upregulation of EEC plays a mechanistic role in feeding disturbance and weight loss. We recently showed increased EEC activity in tissue from active small bowel CD. This study investigated EEC products in plasma in CD, and appetite-related symptoms. METHODOLOGY: Active CD patients and a healthy reference group were studied. Gut peptide responses to a mixed nutrient test meal were measured by ELISA. Symptoms were assessed by visual analogue score. A patient subset was re-studied in remission. RESULTS: CD subjects displayed reduced appetite (p < 0.0001) before and after eating. Total PYY was increased 2.2-fold (p = 0.04) and correlated with nausea (p = 0.036) and bloating (p = 0.037) scores only in small bowel CD. Postprandial plasma ghrelin levels were also elevated. Leptin correlated with body mass index (p = 0.0001) and weight loss (p = 0.01). GLP-1 and GIP were not elevated. In remission, postprandial PYY and ghrelin reverted to control levels. DISCUSSION: Enhanced EEC responses may directly and adversely affect appetite in CD patients through increased gut-brain signalling.},

   abstract = {OBJECTIVES: The aim of the study was to evaluate the incidence, baseline disease characteristics, and disease location based on the Paris classification in pediatric inflammatory bowel disease (IBD) in the Hungarian nationwide inception cohort. In addition, 1-year follow-up with therapy was analyzed. METHODS: From January 1, 2007 to December 31, 2009, newly diagnosed pediatric patients with IBD were prospectively registered. Twenty-seven pediatric gastroenterology centers participated in the data collection ensuring the data from the whole country. Newly diagnosed patients with IBD younger than 18 years were reported. Disease location was classified according to the Paris classification. RESULTS: A total of 420 patients were identified. The incidence rate of pediatric IBD was 7.48/10(5) (95% confidence interval [CI] 6.34/10(5)-8.83/10(5)). The incidence for Crohn disease (CD) was 4.72/10(5) (95% CI 3.82-5.79), for ulcerative colitis (UC) 2.32/10(5) (95% CI 1.71-3.09), and for IBD-unclassified 0.45/10(5) (95% CI 0.22-0.84). Most common location in CD was L3 (58.7%); typical upper gastrointestinal abnormalities (ulcer, erosion and aphthous lesion) were observed in 29.9%. Extensive colitis in patients with UC (E4, proximal to hepatic flexure) was the most common disease phenotype (57%), whereas only 5% of children had proctitis. A total of 18.6% of patients had ever severe disease (S1). Frequency of azathioprine administration at diagnosis was 29.5% in patients with CD, and this rate increased to 54.6% (130/238) at 1-year follow-up. In UC, only 3.3% received azathioprine initially, and this rate elevated to 22.5% (25/111). Use of corticosteroid decreased from 50% to 15.3% in patients with UC. Rate of bowel resection in patients with CD during the first year of follow-up was 5%. CONCLUSIONS: The incidence of pediatric IBD in Hungary was among the higher range reported. This is the first large, nationwide incident cohort analyzed according to the Paris classification, which is a useful tool to determine the characteristic pediatric CD phenotype.},

   abstract = {OBJECTIVES: Multiple characteristics of industrialization have been proposed to contribute to the global emergence of inflammatory bowel diseases (IBDs: Crohn disease and ulcerative colitis). Major changes in eating habits during the last decades and the effectiveness of exclusive enteral nutrition in the treatment of Crohn disease indicate the etiologic importance of dietary intake in IBDs. A uniform characteristic of nutrition in developing countries (where the incidence of IBD is low) and exclusive enteral nutrition is their consistent nature for prolonged periods; however, the potentially beneficial effect of dietary monotony in respect to mammalian intestinal inflammation has not been examined. METHODS: The association between alternating (2 different complete chows) and persistent regular diets, and dextran sulfate sodium colitis susceptibility in C57BL/6J mice was studied. Colonic mucosal microbiota changes were investigated by high-throughput pyrosequencing of the 16S rRNA gene. RESULTS: The severity of colitis increased upon dietary alternation compared with consistent control feeding. The microbiota of the alternating nutritional group clustered discretely from both control groups. CONCLUSIONS: Our findings highlight that monotonous dietary intake may decrease mammalian vulnerability against colitis in association with microbiota separation. The epidemiologic and therapeutic implications of our results are also discussed.},

   abstract = {The inflammatory bowel diseases (IBD) include Crohn's disease (CD) and ulcerative colitis. The disease may present at any age although the peak of presentation is the second and third decades of life. The incidences of these diseases are increasing around the world with the age of presentation getting younger. At present CD is incurable with colectomy being the treatment for severe UC. Although several pharmacological approaches are used to modulate the inflammatory response in IBD, few lead to histological healing and most have side effects. An alternative approach is to use enteral formulae given exclusively (EEN) to treat IBD. EEN requires the consumption of an elemental or polymeric formula, with the exclusion of all other nutrients, for a period of up to 12 weeks. The introduction of EEN as a therapeutic option for IBD was through prudent observation; however, EEN has become an established and reliable option for the treatment of paediatric IBD. Despite this, the mechanisms through which EEN induces disease remission are unknown and remain hypothetical. This review will discuss recent research into EEN both describing clinical features of EEN therapy and discussing the most up-to-date understanding of the mechanisms through which EEN may be reducing intestinal inflammation and inducing disease remission.},

   abstract = {BACKGROUND: Exclusive enteral nutrition (EEN) is a well-established approach to the management of Crohn's disease. Aim. To determine effects of EEN upon inflammation and gut barrier function in a colitis mouse model. METHODS: Interleukin-10-deficient mice (IL-10(-/-)) were inoculated with Helicobacter trogontum and then treated with EEN, metronidazole, hydrocortisone, or EEN and metronidazole combination. Blood and tissue were collected at 2 and 4 weeks with histology, mucosal integrity, tight junction integrity, inflammation, and H. trogontum load evaluated. RESULTS: H. trogontum induced colitis in IL-10(-/-) mice with histological changes in the cecum and colon. Elevated mucosal IL-8 mRNA in infected mice was associated with intestinal barrier dysfunction indicated by decreased transepithelial electrical resistance and mRNA of tight junction proteins and increased short-circuit current, myosin light chain kinase mRNA, paracellular permeability, and tumor necrosis factor- alpha and myeloperoxidase plasma levels (P < 0.01 for all comparisons). EEN and metronidazole, but not hydrocortisone, treatments restored barrier function, maintained gut barrier integrity, and reversed inflammatory changes along with reduction of H. trogontum load (versus infected controls P < 0.05). CONCLUSION: H. trogontum infection in IL-10(-/-) mice induced typhlocolitis with intestinal barrier dysfunction. EEN and metronidazole, but not hydrocortisone, modulate barrier dysfunction and reversal of inflammatory changes.},

   abstract = {BACKGROUND: Ulcerative colitis (UC) occurring during childhood is generally extensive and is associated with severe flares that may require intravenous steroid treatment. In cases of corticosteroid resistance is necessary to introduce a second-line treatment to avoid or delay surgery. AIMS: To describe the efficacy and safety of oral tacrolimus for the treatment of severe steroid-resistant UC. METHODS: We performed a retrospective study that included all patients under age 18 suffering from severe steroid-resistant UC treated with oral tacrolimus during the period January 1998 to October 2012 and with a follow-up period after treatment of 24 months or more. RESULTS: A total of ten patients were included. The age at baseline was 9.4+/-4.9 years, and the time from diagnosis was 1.3 months (IQR, 1-5.7). Seven of the patients were in their first flare of disease. All of them received an oral dose of 0.12 mg/kg/day of tacrolimus divided in two doses. Trough plasma levels of tacrolimus were maintained between 4 and 13 ng/ml. Response was seen in 5/10 patients at 12 months, colectomy was eventually performed in 60% of patients during the follow-up period. CONCLUSIONS: Tacrolimus is useful in inducing remission in patients with severe steroid-resistant UC, preventing or delaying colectomy, and allowing the patient and family to prepare for a probable surgery. Tacrolimus may also be used as a treatment bridge for corticosteroid-dependent patients until the new maintenance therapy takes effect.},

   abstract = {INTRODUCTION: Exclusive enteral nutrition (EEN) has been to be more effective than corticosteroids in achieving mucosal healing without their side effects. OBJECTIVES: To determine the efficacy of EEN in terms of inducing clinical remission in newly diagnosed CD children and to study the efficacy of this therapeutic approach in improving the degree of intestinal mucosa inflammation. MATERIALS AND METHODS: The medical records of patients with newly diagnosed Crohn's disease treated with EEN were reviewed retrospectively. The degree of mucosal inflammation was assessed by fecal calprotectin (FC). Remission was defined as a PCDAI<10. RESULTS: Forty patients (24 males) were included, the age at diagnosis was 11.6 +/- 3.6 years. Of the 34 patients who completed the EEN period, 32 (94% per-protocol analysis) achieved clinical remission. This percentage fell to 80% in the intention-to-treat analysis. The compliance rate was 95%. Duration of EEN was 6.42 weeks (IQR 6.0-8.14). FC was significantly higher in patients with moderate and severe disease. Median baseline FC levels (680 mug/g) decreased significantly to 218 mug/g (P<0.0001) after EEN. We found a statistically significant correlation between FC and PCDAI (rho=0.727; P<0.0001). Early use of thiopurines (< 8 weeks) versus subsequent use was not associated with improved outcomes during the follow-up. CONCLUSIONS: EEN administered for 6-8 weeks is effective for inducing clinical remission and decreasing the degree of mucosal inflammation. We did not find differences in terms of maintenance of remission in patients treated early with thiopurines.},

   abstract = {OBJECTIVES: Exclusive enteral nutrition (EEN) is one of the therapeutic strategies used to induce remission in pediatric Crohn's disease (CD). Although its use is recommended in clinical practice guidelines and consensus documents, the frequency of this practice in Spain is unknown. METHODS: A 70-item questionnaire ( PRESENT: PREScription of Enteral Nutrition in pediaTric Crohn's disease in Spain) was drafted and distributed through the SEGHNP (Spanish Society for Pediatric Gastroenterology, Hepatology and Nutrition) e-mail list. RESULTS: We received information from 51 Pediatric Gastroenterology Units. Of the 287 patients newly diagnosed with CD in 2011-2012 at these centres (139 in 2011, 148 in 2012), 182 (63%) received EEN (58% in 2011 and 68% in 2012). 26% of the patients who received EEN in the period studied (64/246) did so during relapses. All the physicians (100%) who responded to the questionnaire believe that EEN is effective in inducing clinical remission in mild to moderate CD. However, 24.5% of respondents never use EEN during relapses. The enteral formulas used most often used were polymeric formulas specific for CD (70.6%) and the preferred administration route was oral, with 60.8% using flavouring and 9.3% allowing a variable percentage of calories in the form of other foods. 65% use 5-ASA together with EEN, 69% use antibiotics and 95% immunomodulators (thiopurines). The duration of EEN tends to be 8 weeks (47.1%), and transition to regular diet was achieved sequentially over a variable period of time. Regarding barriers and limiting factors for the use of EEN, those most frequently reported include lack of acceptance by the patient and/or family (71%), lack of time and/or ancillary staff (69%) and difficulty in convincing the patient and/or family of the suitability of treatment (43%). CONCLUSIONS: EEN use rates are similar to those of other European questionnaires. Tools that facilitate acceptance by the patient and family are needed. Increasing the time dedicated to this therapeutic modality is likewise important. Given the disparity of criteria for indicating treatment with EEN, it would be useful to have widely accepted clinical practice guidelines or protocols that facilitate the decision to use it.},

   abstract = {BACKGROUND: Patients with inflammatory bowel disease (IBD), including Crohn's disease (CD) and ulcerative colitis (UC), are susceptible to protein-calorie malnutrition secondary to decreased oral intake, malabsorption, and increased metabolic expenditure. In this study, we seek to assess the national frequencies of parenteral nutrition (PN) use among hospitalized patients with IBD and to determine their in-hospital outcomes. METHODS: We analyzed the Nationwide Inpatient Sample from 1988-2006 to determine the frequency of PN usage among patients with UC or CD and to determine their in-hospital outcomes. A multivariate analysis was performed to identify factors predictive of increased inpatient mortality in this population. RESULTS: From 1988-2006, the annual incidence of PN use among hospitalized patients with CD was 4.29 per 100,000 and among those with UC was 3.80 per 100,000, with trends being relatively stable through the indexed period. The mean length of hospitalization among patients with UC receiving PN was longer compared with patients with CD. Factors predictive of an increased risk for mortality include the following: age >50 years, acute kidney injury, hospital-acquired pneumonia, Clostridium difficile colitis, prolonged postoperative ileus requiring PN use, pulmonary embolism, malnutrition, and patients with UC relative to CD. CONCLUSION: Traditionally, patients with CD are at a higher risk for developing malnutrition than patients with UC; however, there is a 2-fold higher risk for inpatient mortality and a longer length of hospitalization among patients with UC compared with those with CD. This pattern suggests that the use of PN, particularly among patients with UC, serves as a surrogate marker of higher disease acuity and severity.},

   abstract = {BACKGROUND & AIMS: Guidelines for the management of venous thromboembolism (VTE) from the American College of Chest Physicians do not address patients with inflammatory bowel disease (IBD), a group with a high risk of both VTE and gastrointestinal bleeding. We present recommendations for the prevention and treatment of VTE in patients with IBD. METHODS: A systematic literature search was performed to identify studies on VTE in IBD. The quality of evidence and strength of recommendations were rated according to the Grading of Recommendation Assessment, Development, and Evaluation (GRADE) approach. Statements were developed through an iterative online platform, then finalized and voted on by a working group of adult and pediatric gastroenterologists and thrombosis specialists. RESULTS: IBD patients have an approximately 3-fold higher risk of VTE compared with individuals without IBD, and disease flares further increase this risk. Anticoagulant thromboprophylaxis is recommended for IBD patients who are hospitalized with IBD flares without active bleeding and is suggested when bleeding is nonsevere. Anticoagulant thromboprophylaxis is suggested during moderate-severe IBD flares in outpatients with a history of VTE provoked by an IBD flare or an unprovoked VTE, but not otherwise. The recommended duration of anticoagulation after a first VTE is based on the presence of provoking factors. Specific suggestions are made for the prevention and treatment of VTE in pediatric and pregnant IBD patients. CONCLUSIONS: Using the American College of Chest Physicians' guidelines as a foundation, we have integrated evidence from IBD studies to develop specific recommendations for the management of VTE in this high-risk population.},

   abstract = {BACKGROUND: Children with Crohn's disease (CD) suffer from malnutrition. Understanding substrate utilization during exercise may help patients with CD sustain a healthy active lifestyle without compromising nutrition. The aim of this study was to determine whether substrate utilization and bioavailability during exercise are altered in children with CD compared with controls. METHODS: Seven children with CD (mean age +/- SD: 15.2 +/- 2.3 yr) and 7 controls (14.4 +/- 2.3 yr) were matched by sex and biological age. Participants completed 60 minutes of cycling at an intensity equivalent to 50% of their peak mechanical power. Rates of total fat and carbohydrate (CHO) oxidation, the amount of fat and CHO oxidized, and the contribution of fat and CHO to total energy expenditure were calculated from expired gases collected during exercise. Blood was collected before, during, and at the end of exercise and analyzed for insulin, free fatty acids, and glucose. RESULTS: Whole-body fat oxidation rate (expressed in mg . kg(-1) of body weight per min) during exercise was lower in children with CD (5.8 +/- 1.0) compared with controls (8.0 +/- 2.2, P < 0.05). Children with CD relied significantly more on CHO, with approximately 10% greater contribution toward total energy expenditure (P < 0.05) than controls. There were no differences in plasma insulin, free fatty acids, or glucose between the groups. CONCLUSIONS: Fat metabolism during exercise seems to be impaired in children with CD. A greater reliance on CHO is required to meet the energy demands of submaximal exercise.},

   abstract = {BACKGROUND: Metabolite monitoring and response predictors to azathioprine (AZA) in pediatric inflammatory bowel disease (IBD) are debatable. In an attempt to optimize thiopurine therapy and understand the mechanism of action of thiopurines, we correlated metabolites and other factors with AZA efficacy in children with IBD. METHODS: Data from 86 children with IBD with 440 metabolite measurements were retrospectively analyzed using multilevel logistic regression analyses. A therapeutic response was defined as a pediatric Crohn's disease activity index </=10 for Crohn's disease or a pediatric ulcerative colitis activity index </=10 for ulcerative colitis without any treatment with steroids, antitumor necrosis factor, other immunomodulators, or exclusive enteral nutrition. RESULTS: The 6-thioguanine nucleotide levels >250 pmol per 8 x 10 red blood cells correlated with a higher response (odds ratio, 4.14; 95% confidence interval, 1.49-11.46, P = 0.007), whereas 6-methyl-mercaptopurine and 6-methyl-mercaptopurine:6-thioguanine nucleotide ratio showed no correlation. Other novel response predictors in children with IBD were relative leukopenia (odds ratio, 14.01; 95% confidence interval, 3.77-52.10; P < 0.001) and the absence of lymphopenia (odds ratio, 3.71; 95% confidence interval, 1.26-10.89; P = 0.017). Lower thiopurine methyltransferase activity (P = 0.015), lower platelet count (P = 0.020), and higher aspartate aminotransferase level (P = 0.009) also predicted therapeutic response. Age, gender, patient adherence, the duration of AZA therapy, IBD type, erythrocyte count, and erythrocyte sedimentation rate did not predict efficacy. The high interindividual variability accounting for 57.7% of variance in therapeutic response was observed. CONCLUSIONS: The significant 6-thioguanine nucleotide level-response relationship may support metabolite monitoring to improve thiopurine efficacy in pediatric IBD. The reported response predictors may be helpful for treatment optimization in AZA-treated children with IBD, but should be proved in prospective studies.},

In this study, we evaluated the immunomodulatory effects of AbM. For the non-specific immune response experiments, a total of 40 female BALB/c mice were divided into control (group 1) and experimental (groups 2-4) groups of 10 animals each. Groups 2, 3 and 4 were orally-administered high (819 mg/kg), medium (273 mg/kg) and low (136.5 mg/kg) doses of AbM daily for six weeks and then six parameters related to non-specific immune response were detected. For the adaptive immune response experiments, 40 female mice were similarly divided into four groups. After six weeks of treatment, animals were immunized with the OVA immunogen. Two weeks later, splenocytes and sera were collected. Four parameters related to adaptive immune response were evaluated. We found that feeding mice with AbM extract increased the IgG level in serum, promoted phagocytosis of peritoneal macrophages and elevated the activity of Natural killer cells. We also found that the highest dose of AbM increased interleukin-2 (IL-2) levels in splenocytes and that a medium dose increased interferon-gamma. The levels of interleukin-4 (IL-4) were reduced or unchanged. T-helper type 1 cytokine levels were increased. AbM increased the humoral immune response and also affected the cellular immune response. These results provide evidence that AbM can modulate innate and adaptive immunity.},

Anti-TNF-alpha therapy did not affect REE, but respiratory quotient (RQ) significantly increased after treatment. Serum interleukin-6 levels were significantly decreased and RQ were significantly increased in high REE (>/=25 kcal/kg/day) group as compared to low REE (<25 kcal/kg/day) group.

   abstract = {OBJECTIVE: The antitumor necrosis factor alpha (TNFalpha) antibodies infliximab and adalimumab are effective in inducing and maintaining remission in pediatric patients with Crohn disease (CD). The aim of the study was to evaluate the long-term efficacy and safety of biological therapy in pediatric patients with CD followed at a referral center. METHODS: This work is a retrospective observational study enrolling patients with CD treated with infliximab or adalimumab beyond the induction protocol. The patients' data were collected from the unit's IBD database (maximum follow-up evaluation after 36 months of treatment). The efficacy was evaluated by the Pediatric Crohn Disease Activity Index score and by analysis of the cumulative probability of continuing therapy; the safety was assessed in terms of adverse events. RESULTS: We enrolled 78 patients; the mean therapy duration was 27.2 +/- 16.7 months, and the mean age at enrollment was 15 +/- 3.1 years. The Kaplan-Meier analysis showed a cumulative probability of continuing therapy of 81%, 54%, and 33% at 1, 2, and 3 years, respectively, from the introduction of therapy. No association between the patients' baseline characteristics and the long-term outcome was found. The evaluation of the concomitant therapy with immunomodulators and anti-TNFalpha therapy versus anti-TNFalpha alone did not show a different outcome. No serious adverse events were recorded. CONCLUSIONS: The study indicates that biological therapy is effective and safe in pediatric patients with CD in a longer follow-up period. The response to treatment was not influenced by the patients' baseline characteristics or by the immunomodulator association.},

   abstract = {BACKGROUND: Adults with inflammatory bowel disease (IBD) have an increased risk of venous thrombotic events (TEs). We sought to evaluate the risk for TE in children and adolescents with IBD using a large population database. METHODS: The triennial Healthcare Cost and Utilization Project Kids' Inpatient Database was used in a retrospective cohort study of hospitalized children in the United States across 1997, 2000, 2003, 2006, and 2009. Billing codes were used to identify discharges with Crohn disease, ulcerative colitis, pulmonary embolism, deep vein thrombosis, thrombophlebitis, thrombosis of intracranial venous sinus, Budd-Chiari syndrome, and portal vein thrombosis. A logistic regression model was fitted to quantify the increased risk of TE in children with IBD, while adjusting for other risk factors of thrombosis. RESULTS: The total weighted number of pediatric discharges was 7,448,292, and 68,394 (0.92%) were identified with IBD. The incidence of any TE in a hospitalized child or adolescent with IBD was 117.9/10,000 with a relative risk (95% confidence interval) of 2.36 (2.15-2.58). The adjusted odds ratio for any TE in a patient with IBD without surgery was 1.22 (1.08-1.36). Risk factors for TE among patients with IBD include older age, central venous catheter, parenteral nutrition, and an identified hypercoagulable condition. There is an increasing trend of TE in both the IBD and non-IBD patients. CONCLUSIONS: Hospitalized children and adolescents with IBD are at increased risk for TE. Conservative methods of TE prevention including hydration, mobilization, or pneumatic devices should be considered in hospitalized patients with IBD.},

   abstract = {Although epidemiological findings support a role for vitamin K status in the improvement of bone indices in adult patients with Crohn's disease (CD), this needs to be confirmed in double-blind, randomised controlled trials (RCT) with phylloquinone (vitamin K1). By conducting two RCT, the present study aimed to first establish whether supplementation with 1000 mug of phylloquinone daily near-maximally suppresses the percentage of undercarboxylated osteocalcin in serum (%ucOC; marker of vitamin K status) in adult patients with CD currently in remission as it does in healthy adults and second determine the effect of supplementation with phylloquinone at this dose for 12 months on the indices of bone turnover and bone mass. The initial dose-ranging RCT was conducted in adult patients with CD (n 10 per group) using 0 (placebo), 1000 or 2000 mug of phylloquinone daily for 2 weeks. In the main RCT, the effect of placebo v. 1000 mug vitamin K/d (both co-administered with Ca (500 mg/d) and vitamin D3 (10 mug/d)) for 12 months (n 43 per group) on the biochemical indices of bone turnover (determined by enzyme immunoassay) and bone mass (determined by dual-energy X-ray absorptiometry) were investigated. At baseline, the mean %ucOC was 47 %, and this was suppressed upon supplementation with 1000 mug of phylloquinone daily ( - 81 %; P< 0.01) and not suppressed further by 2000 mug of phylloquinone daily. Compared with the placebo, supplementation with 1000 mug of phylloquinone daily for 12 months had no significant effect (P>0.1) on bone turnover markers or on the bone mass of the lumbar spine or femur, but modestly increased (P< 0.05) the bone mass of the total radius. Despite near maximal suppression of serum %ucOC, supplementation with 1000 mug of phylloquinone daily (with Ca and vitamin D3) had no effect on the indices of bone health in adult CD patients with likely vitamin K insufficiency.},

   abstract = {An essential role of the intestinal epithelium is to separate luminal contents from the interstitium, a function primarily determined by the integrity of the epithelium and the tight junction that seals the paracellular space. Intestinal tight junctions are selectively permeable, and intestinal permeability can be increased physiologically in response to luminal nutrients or pathologically by mucosal immune cells and cytokines, the enteric nervous system, and pathogens. Compromised intestinal barrier function is associated with an array of clinical conditions, both intestinal and systemic. Although most available data are correlative, some studies support a model where cycles of increased intestinal permeability, intestinal immune activation, and subsequent immune-mediated barrier loss contribute to disease progression. This model is applicable to intestinal and systemic diseases. However, it has not been proven, and both mechanistic and therapeutic studies are ongoing. Nevertheless, the correlation between increased intestinal permeability and disease has caught the attention of the public, leading to a rise in popularity of the diagnosis of "leaky gut syndrome," which encompasses a range of systemic disorders. Proponents claim that barrier restoration will cure underlying disease, but this has not been demonstrated in clinical trials. Moreover, human and mouse studies show that intestinal barrier loss alone is insufficient to initiate disease. It is therefore uncertain whether increased permeability in these patients is a cause or effect of the underlying disorder. Although drug targets that may mediate barrier restoration have been proposed, none have been proven effective. As such, current treatments for barrier dysfunction should target the underlying disease.},

   abstract = {Intestinal microbiota may influence human physiology and disease risk due to the role it plays in mediating appropriate immune responses to harmful and innocuous antigens. Colonisation of the intestine in early life seems particularly important as it is the main environmental stimulus for immune system maturation. This is a dynamic process, which depends on both environmental and genetic factors. The pathogenesis of inflammatory bowel disease, such as Crohn's disease, involves genetic polymorphisms (e.g. CARD15/nucleotide-binding oligomerisation domain 2) related to an excessive inflammatory response to commensal microbiota and to its unbalanced composition. Atopic diseases have also been linked to imbalances in microbiota and to related genetic factors (e.g. TLR4 and CD14 genes), although these associations are still controversial. Research into the relationship between the genetic risk of developing celiac disease (human leukocyte antigen (HLA)-DQ2/DQ8) and the early colonisation process in infants at family risk of the disease has also reported that the HLA-DQ genotype could influence staphylococcal colonisation. Future observational studies considering both host genetics and microbiota could be critical in defining the complex host-microbe interactions and the respective role each plays in inflammatory disorders.},

   abstract = {It has been presumed that aberrant immune response to intestinal microorganisms in genetically predisposed individuals may play a major role in the pathogenesis of the inflammatory bowel disease, and there is a good deal of evidence supporting this hypothesis. Commensal enteric bacteria probably play a central role in pathogenesis, providing continuous antigenic stimulation that causes chronic intestinal injury. A strong biologic rationale supports the use of probiotics and prebiotics for inflammatory bowel disease therapy. Many probiotic strains exhibit anti-inflammatory properties through their effects on different immune cells, pro-inflammatory cytokine secretion depression, and the induction of anti-inflammatory cytokines. There is very strong evidence supporting the use of multispecies probiotic VSL#3 for the prevention or recurrence of postoperative pouchitis in patients. For treatment of active ulcerative colitis, as well as for maintenance therapy, the clinical evidence of efficacy is strongest for VSL#3 and Escherichia coli Nissle 1917. Moreover, some prebiotics, such as germinated barley foodstuff, Psyllium or oligofructose-enriched inulin, might provide some benefit in patients with active ulcerative colitis or ulcerative colitis in remission. The results of clinical trials in the treatment of active Crohn's disease or the maintenance of its remission with probiotics and prebiotics are disappointing and do not support their use in this disease. The only exception is weak evidence of advantageous use of Saccharomyces boulardii concomitantly with medical therapy in maintenance treatment.},

   abstract = {There is increasing scientific interest in the field of vitamin D research, moving the focus beyond bone health to other disease processes. Low circulating vitamin D levels have been reported as a risk factor for several pathophysiologically divergent diseases, including cancers, diabetes, CVD, multiple sclerosis and inflammatory diseases, including rheumatoid arthritis and inflammatory bowel disease (IBD). But, therein, remains the challenge: can any single nutrient contribute to multiple complex disease mechanisms and, ultimately, have therapeutic potential? The aim of this review is to critically evaluate several strands of scientific evidence surrounding vitamin D and inflammation, primarily focusing on IBD. Epidemiological studies suggest an increased incidence of IBD and rheumatoid arthritis in countries of more northern latitudes, mirroring sunlight patterns. A considerable body of evidence supports the anti-inflammatory effects of vitamin D, at least in animal models of IBD. Although it is accepted that suboptimal vitamin D status is common in IBD, some studies suggest that this associates with more severe disease. With regard to treatment, the data are only beginning to emerge from randomised controlled trials to suggest that people with IBD may remain in remission longer when treated with oral vitamin D. In conclusion, several strands of evidence suggest that vitamin D may modify the immune response in IBD. There is a continued need for large well-designed clinical trials and mechanistic studies to determine if, and how, this emerging promise translates into tangible clinical benefits for people with chronic debilitating diseases such as IBD.},

Our objective was to characterize the health care burden associated with CDI in hospitalized pediatric patients with IBD. METHODS: We extracted and analyzed cases with a discharge diagnosis of IBD or CDI from the U.S. Healthcare Cost and Utilization Project Kids' Inpatient Database. RESULTS: In our primary analysis, we evaluated pediatric cases with a principal diagnosis of IBD or CDI. For the year 2009, we identified 12,610 weighted cases with IBD of which 3.5% had CDI. In children with IBD, CDI was independently associated with lengthier hospital stays (8.0 versus 6.0 days; adjusted regression coefficient, 2.1 days; 95% confidence interval [CI], 1.4-2.8), higher charges ($45,126 versus $34,703; adjusted regression coefficient, $11,506; 95% CI, 6192-16,820), and greater need for parenteral nutrition (15.9% versus 12.1%; adjusted odds ratio, 1.5; 95% CI, 1.1-2.0) and blood transfusion (17.7% versus 9.8%; adjusted odds ratio, 1.8; 95% CI, 1.4-2.4). There were no deaths. We made similar observations in a subanalysis of cases with principal or secondary diagnoses of IBD or CDI. The incidence of CDI in patients with IBD increased between 2000 and 2009 from 21.7 to 28.0 cases per 1000 IBD cases per year (P < 0.001). There was a significant increase in CDI complicating ulcerative colitis (28.1 versus 42.2, P < 0.001) but not for Crohn's disease (18.3 versus 20.3). CONCLUSIONS: CDI represents a significant health care burden in hospitalized children with IBD.},

   abstract = {Malabsorption encompasses dysfunctions occurring during the digestion and absorption of nutrients. A small proportion of patients presents with chronic diarrhoea. A clinical history supportive of malabsorption may guide investigations toward either the small bowel or pancreas. Serological testing for coeliac disease will determine most cases without invasive investigations. In the clinical context of persisting weight loss and malnutrition, small bowel enteropathy may be investigated with small intestinal biopsies. Small bowel absorptive capacity and permeability might be measured by oral sugar-mix ingestion. Further, approaches to the investigation of malabsorption might also involve the detection in faeces of a substance that has not been absorbed. A variation of the latter is the use of breath testing which relies on the breakdown of the malabsorbed test substance by colonic flora. Measurement of protein absorption is difficult and unreliable; it is, therefore, rarely advocated in clinical settings. No single biological marker confirming a diagnosis of small bowel malabsorption or small bowel integrity is presently available in clinical practice. Plasma citrulline concentration, an amino acid not incorporated into endogenous or exogenous proteins, has been extensively used in research studies and supportive results are establishing its concentration as a reliable quantitative biomarker of enterocyte absorptive capacity.},

   abstract = {BACKGROUND: High diagnostic accuracy is reported for magnetic resonance enterography (MRE) in Crohn's disease (CD), but few studies have evaluated its role in abdominal fistulae. The primary aim of this study was to assess the reliability of MRE in the identification of internal fistulae in CD. METHODS: One hundred and eighty-six patients with moderate CD (CD Activity Index : 250-400) were prospectively selected from the inflammatory bowel disease clinic of Parma University Hospital. Eligible patients had already undergone nutritional screening, pancolonoscopy, and computed tomography enterography (CTE) in the month before enrollment. MRE was performed according to the study protocol. Additional fluoroscopic contrast-enhanced studies or surgical evaluation were used for discordance between CTE and MRE results. A consensus committee resolved equivocal findings. Surgical findings and/or fluoroscopic contrast-enhanced studies together with the clinical data were considered the composite "reference standard" to which the results of MRE were compared. RESULTS: MRE identified 22 internal fistulae in 21 patients (11%), of whom 4 (19%) also had perianal fistulae and found 7 abscesses (33%). Forty-one (22%) additional patients with perianal fistulae were identified. Thirteen patients (57%) with internal fistulae required enteral nutrition support. No statistically significant differences were found between MRE and CTE in fistula detection. There was also no significant difference between MRE and the composite diagnosis in those who underwent surgery (n = 8) and/or contrast-enhanced studies (n = 7). CONCLUSIONS: CTE and MRE accurately detect internal fistulae in CD. MRE is preferable because it avoids radiation. Reliable identification of internal fistulae by MRE should permit earlier and improved treatment.},

   abstract = {BACKGROUND & AIMS: There is a need for a scoring system that provides a comprehensive assessment of structural bowel damage, including stricturing lesions, penetrating lesions, and surgical resection, for measuring disease progression. We developed the Lemann Index and assessed its ability to measure cumulative structural bowel damage in patients with Crohn's disease (CD). METHODS: We performed a prospective, multicenter, international, cross-sectional study of patients with CD evaluated at 24 centers in 15 countries. Inclusions were stratified based on CD location and duration. All patients underwent clinical examination and abdominal magnetic resonance imaging analyses. Upper endoscopy, colonoscopy, and pelvic magnetic resonance imaging analyses were performed according to suspected disease locations. The digestive tract was divided into 4 organs and subsequently into segments. For each segment, investigators collected information on previous operations, predefined strictures, and/or penetrating lesions of maximal severity (grades 1-3), and then provided damage evaluations ranging from 0.0 (no lesion) to 10.0 (complete resection). Overall level of organ damage was calculated from the average of segmental damage. Investigators provided a global damage evaluation (from 0.0 to 10.0) using calculated organ damage evaluations. Predicted organ indexes and Lemann Index were constructed using a multiple linear mixed model, showing the best fit with investigator organ and global damage evaluations, respectively. An internal cross-validation was performed using bootstrap methods. RESULTS: Data from 138 patients (24, 115, 92, and 59 with upper tract, small bowel, colon/rectum, and anus CD location, respectively) were analyzed. According to validation, the unbiased correlation coefficients between predicted indexes and investigator damage evaluations were 0.85, 0.98, 0.90, 0.82 for upper tract, small bowel, colon/rectum, anus, respectively, and 0.84 overall. CONCLUSIONS: In a cross-sectional study, we assessed the ability of the Lemann Index to measure cumulative structural bowel damage in patients with CD. Provided further successful validation and good sensitivity to change, the index should be used to evaluate progression of CD and efficacy of treatment.},

   abstract = {BACKGROUND: Utilization trends and health effects of infliximab and adalimumab in inflammatory bowel disease (IBD) are incompletely understood. We aimed to describe utilization trends of these 2 anti-tumor necrosis factor (TNF) agents, determine the correlation between utilization with rates of hospitalization and surgery and describe differences in use between adults and children. METHODS: Longitudinal data were analyzed for drug utilization, hospitalization, and abdominal surgery. Descriptive statistics were used to show trends, and utilization quotients were compared for standardization. Multivariate logistic regression analysis assessed the association between drug use and rates of hospitalization and surgery. RESULTS: Four hundred thirty-eight pediatric and 2514 adult patients with IBD generated a total of 51,882 inpatient and outpatient encounters, representing 1185 Crohn's disease, 1531 ulcerative colitis, and 236 indeterminate colitis patients. From 2007 through 2012, utilization quotients declined for hospitalization but remained unchanged for surgery; adalimumab saw a 3-fold increase, despite continued dominance of infliximab. Median band and mean fitted plots showed downward hospitalization trends from 2006 to 2012. Utilization of infliximab peaked in 2008, Q4 with gradual decline to 2012, Q2; and adalimumab showed moderate increased utilization since 2007, Q1. Use of infliximab (odds ratio [OR], 0.76; 95% confidence interval [CI], 0.70-0.83) and adalimumab (OR, 0.79; 95% CI, 0.72-0.87) was associated with decreased hospitalization risk but not associated with reduced abdominal surgery risk. Children had increased hospitalization (OR, 2.68; 95% CI, 2.49-2.88) but decreased risk for abdominal surgery (OR, 0.57; 95% CI, 0.46-0.70). CONCLUSIONS: Current infliximab use remains substantially greater than adalimumab use, despite recent increased use of adalimumab. Although trends for hospitalization for IBD are decreasing, it is not reflected in abdominal surgery rates in a tertiary IBD referral center.},

   abstract = {The chronic intestinal inflammation that characterises Crohn's disease and ulcerative colitis arises from a complex interplay between host genotype, the immune system, and the intestinal microbiota. In addition, environmental factors such as smoking impact on disease onset and progression. Individuals who smoke are more likely to develop Crohn's disease, and smoking is associated with recurrence after surgery and a poor response to medical therapy. Conversely, smoking appears protective against ulcerative colitis and smokers are less likely to require colectomy. The mechanism by which smoking exerts its impact on disease and the rational for the dichotomous effect in patients with Crohn's disease and ulcerative colitis is not clear. Recent evidence suggests that smoking induces alterations to both the innate and acquired immune system. In addition, smoking is associated with a distinct alteration in the intestinal microbiota both in patients with active Crohn's disease and healthy subjects.},

   abstract = {BACKGROUND: We developed a new IgA and IgG anti-MZGP2 antibody ELISAs based on recombinant isoform-4 of human zymogen granule protein-2 (GP2), which is the major autoantigen of Crohn's disease (CrD)-specific pancreatic autoantibodies and assessed their clinical relevance in the largest inflammatory bowel disease (IBD) cohort tested to date. METHODS: 832 sera were studied, including 617 consecutive IBD patients from 323 CrD and 294 ulcerative colitis (UC) follow-up in a tertiary centre, and 112 pathological and 103 normal controls. RESULTS: Sensitivity of IgA anti-MZGP2 for CrD in the IBD population was 15% and specificity was 98% (95, 99), while the sensitivity and specificity of IgG anti-MZGP2 were 27% and 97%. IgA and IgG anti-MZGP2 combined testing led to a sensitivity of 31% and a specificity of 96%. Positivity for either ASCA (IgA or IgG) or anti-MZGP2 (IgA or IgG) showed a sensitivity of 75% (70, 80) and a specificity of 84% (79, 89). IgA anti-MZGP2 antibodies were more prevalent in CrD patients with early disease onset (p=0.011). Also, anti-MZGP2 positive patients more frequently had extensive disease with ileal involvement. Patients with longer disease duration were more likely to have IgG anti-MZGP2 antibodies. CONCLUSIONS: Our novel ELISA confirms the high specificity of anti-MZGP2 antibodies for CrD and their association with disease severity phenotypes.},

   abstract = {Frequency of inflammatory bowel diseases (Crohn's disease and ulcerative colitis) tends to increase in developing countries. Nearly 25% of cases affects pediatric patients. Inflammatory bowel diseases are often associated with weight loss and stunting in children. Moreover, weight and height deficiencies are often early symptoms. Initially, nonspecific or latent course of disease delays the diagnostic process. Malnutrition in inflammatory bowel diseases can be caused by disorders of digestion and nutrients' absorption, intestinal loss, increased energy expenditure and appetite impairment. Nutritional deficiencies and inflammatory agents lead to disturbance of tissue metabolism - muscle and bone - and retardation of somatic development of affected children. Thus, deficiencies of muscle mass, bone mineral density and body height are observed. Insufficient normalization of somatic features may be the consequence of recurrent nature of disease and specificity of pharmacological treatment. Present work deals with the current state of knowledge concerning the somatic development disorders of children with inflammatory bowel diseases. Abnormal nutritional status, bone mineral density deficits and growth failure of patients have been discussed in the context of their relations and dependencies on inflammatory, nutritional and therapeutic factors.},

   abstract = {BACKGROUND AND AIMS: The polyunsaturated fatty acids (PUFA) arachidonic acid (AA, n-6) and eicosapentaenoic acid (EPA, n-3) are precursors of eicosanoids and other lipid mediators which have critical roles in inflammation. The mediators formed from the different PUFA have different potencies. We hypothesised that metabolic changes associated with colonic mucosal inflammation would modify the bioavailability of the eicosanoid precursors AA and EPA. METHODS: Colonic mucosa biopsies were obtained from patients with ulcerative colitis and from matched controls. Inflammation was graded endoscopically and histologically. Esterified and non-esterified fatty acids were determined within the biopsies using gas chromatography-mass spectrometry and liquid chromatography-mass spectrometry, respectively. RESULTS: Biopsy samples were collected from 69 UC patients (54 providing both inflamed and non-inflamed mucosa) and 69 controls. Inflamed mucosa had higher AA (p<0.001) and lower EPA (p<0.010) contents and a higher AA:EPA ratio (p<0.001). Inflamed mucosa also had higher docosapentaenoic acid (DPA) and docosahexaenoic acid (DHA) and lower linoleic acid (LA) and alpha-linolenic acid (alpha-LNA) contents (all p<0.001), compared to non-inflamed and controls. There were significant correlations between severity of inflammation and contents of AA, DPA and DHA (positive correlations) and of LA, alpha-LNA and EPA (negative correlations). CONCLUSIONS: Higher AA, AA:EPA ratio, DPA and DHA and lower LA, alpha-LNA and EPA are seen in inflamed mucosa in UC and correlate with severity of inflammation. This suggests an alteration in fatty acid metabolism in the inflamed gut mucosa, which may offer novel targets for intervention and should be considered if nutritional strategies are used.},

   abstract = {Crohn's disease is a complex inherited disorder of unknown pathogenesis with environmental, genetic and microbial factors involved in the development of the disease. A remarkable feature of this disease in childhood is the effective response to exclusive enteral nutrition (EEN) therapy and the need for complete exclusion of normal diet required for success (principle of exclusivity). EEN or dietary interventions might act through removal of dietary components, which affect microbial composition, decrease a proinflammatory response and promote restitution of the epithelial barrier, likewise allowing termination of this vicious disease-forming cycle before a critical threshold is reached. Multiple traditional and nontraditional dietary components may affect the microbiome, mucous layer, intestinal permeability, or adherence and translocation of pathobionts. We review the epidemiological data, as well as data from animal models and cell lines, and propose a model for pathogenesis we have termed the 'bacterial penetration cycle', whereby dietary components such as animal fat, high sugar intake and gliadin, and consumption of emulsifiers, maltodextrin as well as low-fiber diets may be able to cause a localized acquired bacterial clearance defect, leading to bacterial adhesion and penetration, and subsequently inflammation in the gut.},

   abstract = {OBJECTIVE: Of pediatric patients with Crohn disease, 20% to 30% undergo surgery within 10 years. Although disease relapses and reoperations are common, long-term functional outcomes and quality of life (QoL) are unclear. METHODS: In 2010, we reviewed the hospital records of all pediatric patients with CD who had undergone intestinal resections during childhood in 2 major tertiary care hospitals between 1985 and 2008 and mailed out questionnaires that asked about health outcomes and QoL. We compared the QoL of the patients and a group of matched controls randomly chosen from the Population Register Centre. RESULTS: In total, 36 children had undergone bowel resection a median of 10 years earlier and had at least 2 years of follow-up. Disease activation (verified at endoscopy) requiring medical or surgical treatment occurred in 94% (median 1.8 years after primary resection). At least 1 surgical complication occurred in 77%, and 54% underwent re-resection. The patients reported a median stool frequency of 3 stools during the day and zero at night, with 33% being totally continent. Overall, 96% were completely or moderately satisfied with the outcome of the surgery. The QoL was comparable between the patients and controls, but school or work absences diminished the QoL of the patients. CONCLUSIONS: Surgery for pediatric-onset CD is risky even under expert care. Disease relapses and bowel re-resections are common during the first decade after primary surgery. In the long term, however, bowel function is acceptable and the QoL is comparable between patients and their peers.},

   abstract = {BACKGROUND AND AIMS: Oxidative stress is presumed to play an important role in Crohn's disease (CD) pathogenesis. Nevertheless, the evaluation of the intestinal antioxidant capacity through the analysis of glutathione peroxidase activity in CD remains to be determined. METHODS: 20 CD outpatients and 16 volunteers going through colonic cancer screening were enrolled. Colonoscopy with biopsies was performed in all individuals. Samples from inflamed and non-inflamed mucosa were taken when there was CD endoscopic activity. Spectrophotometric assays were performed to measure tissue glutathione peroxidase (GPx) activity, and total (GSHT) and oxidized (GSSG) glutathione in all samples. Demographics and clinical characteristics were collected from clinical charts. RESULTS: Inflamed CD mucosa presented reduced GPx activity compared to non-inflamed CD mucosa (42.94mU/mg protein vs 79.62mU/mg protein, P<0.05) and control mucosa (42.94mU/mg protein vs 95.08mU/mg protein, P<0.001). GSHT concentration was reduced in inflamed mucosa when compared to non-inflamed CD mucosa (0.78mumol/g vs 1.98mumol/g, P<0.01) and the control group (0.78mumol/g vs 2.11mumol/g, P<0.001). A significant correlation was detected between GPx activity and GSSG (r=-0.599), disease duration (r=0.546), and thiopurine treatment (r=-0.480) in non-inflamed CD mucosa. CONCLUSION: Our findings suggest that reduced GPx activity is present in inflamed CD mucosa. In addition, endoscopic activity, disease duration and thiopurine therapy could be associated with mucosal decreased antioxidant activity.},

   abstract = {BACKGROUND: Crohn disease (CD) is a chronic inflammatory process of gastrointestinal tract, which frequently affects children. Recent advances in Magnetic Resonance Imaging (MRI) technique have made small bowel imaging possible, what is extremely useful in pediatrics. The purpose of this article is to describe the characteristic MR enterography findings and to present the advantages of this modality in pediatric patients. MATERIAL/METHODS: A group of 40 patients referred from the Department of Pediatric Gastroenterology and Nutrition, Medical University of Warsaw was included in the analysis. The patients' age ranged from 7 to 18 years (mean age 14 years). Among the study participants, 28 patients were diagnosed with CD, whereas 12 patients had a history of ulcerative colitis or were strongly suspected of CD based on clinical data. The examinations were performed on GE Signa HD 1,5 T system. Small bowel distention was achieved by oral administration of 600-1000 ml of hyperosmotic solution of polyetylenglycol (PEG). Prior to the examination, 20-40 mg of a spasmolytic drug, hioscine-N-butylobromide (Buscolysin((R))), was administrated to reduce peristaltic movements. RESULTS: The abnormal small bowel segments were found in 21 patients and the features of colonic disease were detected in 5 patients. In 2 patients the lesions involved both small and large bowel. In 16 subjects mural changes were not found. Among studied patients, following signs of small bowel inflammation were fund: bowel wall thickening (n=21), submucosal edema (n=8), segment wall hyperenhancement (n=18), deep ulceration (n=6), fistula (n=3), stenosis (n=7), mesenteric signs such as hyperemia (n=9), fibrofatty proliferation (n=8) and lymphadenopathy (n=28). CONCLUSIONS: MR enterography is an excellent examination, which provides an accurate information about severity and activity of and complications related to CD. It is especially valuable in children, because of lack of the negative consequences of repeated exposure to ionizing radiation.},

Early studies recommended immediate surgical intervention for cases of ileostomy obstruction in pregnancy. We present a case of ileostomy obstruction at 29-week gestation in which a laparotomy was performed for presumed adhesions. When adhesiolysis failed to resolve the obstruction, it became clear that the obstruction was caused by external compression from the enlarging gravid uterus. The remainder of the pregnancy was successfully managed by daily aspiration of bowel contents using a large bore drainage tube, and total parental nutrition. Recent studies have utilised MRI to distinguish between adhesions and uterine compression as the cause of ileostomy obstruction in pregnancy. In the few cases of obstruction caused by uterine compression, patients have been safely managed with conservative therapy, thereby avoiding the risks of surgery.},

   abstract = {BACKGROUND: Patients with inflammatory bowel disease (IBD) report a range of nutritional and dietary problems and high-quality written information should be available on these. There is little research investigating the availability and quality of such information for patients with IBD. OBJECTIVE: This study assessed the type and quality of written information on nutrition and diet available to patients with IBD and the opinions of patients and health professionals. SETTING AND PARTICIPANTS: Seventy-two patients with IBD were recruited from a large gastroenterology outpatient centre in England. One hundred dietitians from across the United Kingdom were also recruited. METHODS: Face-to-face surveys were conducted with patients with IBD. Questions regarding the use, format and usefulness of dietary information received were probed. Dietitians were surveyed regarding written dietary information used in clinical practice. Samples of IBD-specific dietary information used across the UK were objectively assessed using two validated tools. MAIN RESULTS: The majority of patients rated written information as 'good' or 'very good', with the most useful information relating to 'general diet and IBD'. Forty-nine (49%) dietitians reported gaps in written information available for patients with IBD. Fifty-three different samples of IBD-specific information sheets were returned, with widely variable objective quality ratings. Commercially produced written information scored greater than locally produced information (BMA tool, P < 0.05). CONCLUSIONS: Patient access to high-quality, written, IBD-specific dietary information is variable. IBD-specific written nutrition information needs to be developed in accordance with validated tools to empower patients, encourage self-management and overcome nutritional implications of IBD.},

   abstract = {INTRODUCTION: Paediatric Crohn's disease is a disorder characterised by a chronic inflammation that can affect any part of the gastrointestinal tract. Intestinal dysbiosis is a key factor in the multifactorial pathogenesis of this disease. Different dietary supplements have been proposed as alternative therapy both on induction and on maintaining remission of this disease. OBJECTIVE: To review current scientific evidence of intestinal dysbiosis in paediatric Crohn's disease patients, as well as efficacy of dietary supplement therapy (especially probiotics). MATERIALS AND METHODS: Extensive search of scientific publications was performed in specialized electronic databases: NBCI, Elsevier, Scielo, Scirus and Science Direct. RESULTS AND DISCUSSION: An increase of Proteobacteria and a reduction of Firmicutes were observed in Crohn's disease paediatric patients. However the results referring to phyla Bacteroidetes and Actinobacteria are disperse. Referring the use of dietary supplements, the use of probiotics did not show any positive impact in paediatric Crohn's disease patients. CONCLUSIONS: A better knowledge and understanding of the bacterial flora modifications in paediatric Crohn's disease patients is possible with the current published results. However, it is not possible to define the precise microbiota associated or causing this disease. In addition, current results do not bring solid evidence of the efficacy of probiotic therapy in those patients.},

   abstract = {In recent years, pediatric health care has embraced the concept of quality improvement to improve patient outcomes. As quality improvement efforts are implemented, network collaboration (where multiple centers and practices implement standardized programs) is a popular option. In a collaborative network, improvement in the conduct of structural, process and outcome quality measures can lead to improvements in overall health, and benchmarks can be used to assess and compare progress. In this review article, we provided an overview of the quality improvement movement and the role of quality indicators in this movement. We reviewed current quality improvement efforts in pediatric inflammatory bowel disease (IBD), as well as other pediatric chronic illnesses. We discussed the need to standardize the development of quality indicators used in quality improvement networks to assess medical care, and the validation techniques which can be used to ensure that process indicators result in improved outcomes of clinical significance. We aimed to assess current quality improvement efforts in pediatric IBD and other diseases, such as childhood asthma, childhood arthritis, and neonatal health. By doing so, we hope to learn from their successes and failures and to move the field forward for future improvements in the care provided to children with IBD.},

The duration of the above-mentioned depends on the prevalence of such symptoms as fever, bowel movements, length of the functioning gastrointestinal tract, stoma and intestinal fistula presence. Nutritional therapy is an essential element of successful treatment alongside pharmacological, surgical, and biological therapy, as well as other methods. Crohn's disease and ulcerative colitis considered as chronic diseases, lead towards physical and biopsychosocial disability, being responsible for the reduction in the quality of life. The aim of the study was to determine the quality of life after surgical procedures in case of patients diagnosed with Crohn's disease and ulcerative colitis, subjected to natural and parenteral nutrition. MATERIAL AND METHODS: The study group comprised 52 patients from the Department of Gastroenterology, Military Medical Institute, and Department of Surgery and Clinical Nutrition, Clinical Hospital in Warsaw. The study was performed between October, 2011 and April, 2012. The World Health Organization Quality of Life Instrument - Bref (WHOQOL-BREF) questionnaire was used to deter-mine the patients' quality of life. CONCLUSIONS: A lower quality of life was observed in case of patients subjected to parenteral nutrition, poor education, disease symptoms exacerbation, in the majority-rural inhabitants. The quality of life does not depend on gender, type of disease, family status, and additional medical care.},

   abstract = {Vitamin D deficiency is common among patients with Crohn's disease. Serum 25-hydroxyvitamin D (25(OH)D) is the best measure of an individual's vitamin D status and current cut-off ranges for sufficiency are debatable. Several factors contribute to vitamin D deficiency in Crohn's disease. These include inadequate exposure to sunlight, inadequate dietary intake, impaired conversion of vitamin D to its active metabolite, increased catabolism, increased excretion and genetic variants in vitamin D hydroxylation and transport. The effects of low 25(OH)D on outcomes other than bone health are understudied in Crohn's disease. The aim of the present review is to discuss the potential roles of vitamin D and the possible levels required to achieve them. Emerging evidence suggests that vitamin D may have roles in innate and adaptive immunity, in the immune-pathogenesis of Crohn's disease, prevention of Crohn's disease-related hospitalisations and surgery, in reducing disease severity and in colon cancer prevention. The present literature appears to suggest that 25(OH)D concentrations of >/=75 nmol/l may be required for non-skeletal effects; however, further research on optimal levels is required.},

   abstract = {BACKGROUND: The distribution of IgG4 plasma cells in colonic mucosa, its significance, and relation to disease activity in patients with inflammatory bowel disease (IBD) is unclear. We systematically evaluated IgG4 cell distribution in colonic mucosal biopsies of patients with IBD and correlated histological findings with disease pattern and mucosal inflammation. METHODS: We reviewed clinical records and pathology specimens of 54 randomly selected patients with IBD (13 Crohn's colitis: 7 active, 6 inactive; 18 ulcerative colitis [UC]: 10 active, 8 inactive; 23 UC with primary sclerosing cholangitis: 11 active colitis, 12 inactive colitis), and 11 controls (3 nonspecific diarrhea, 8 collagenous/lymphocytic colitis) who had colonoscopy and biopsies performed at our institution from April 2003 to July 2010. Immunostains for IgG4 were performed on archived rectal biopsies. Presence of >10 IgG4 cells per high-power field (x40 field) on microscopic evaluation was considered significant. RESULTS: Overall, significant IgG4 plasma cell infiltration was seen in 24% of patients compared with none of the controls (P = 0.05). Within IBD groups, significant infiltration was limited to patients with UC with active colitis (30%), primary sclerosing cholangitis with inactive (25%) and active (64%) colitis. In contrast, patients with Crohn's colitis, UC with inactive colitis, and controls had rare IgG4 plasma cells. No correlation was observed between the number of IgG4 cells and degree of active inflammation. In 4 patients with UC and primary sclerosing cholangitis who had more than 1 colonoscopy and biopsies, the number of IgG4 cells fluctuated without correlation with colonic disease activity. CONCLUSIONS: IgG4 plasma cells are significantly increased in a subset of patients with IBD suggesting the possibility of a B-cell-mediated mechanism in these patients.},

   abstract = {BACKGROUND & AIMS: Telephone communication is common between healthcare providers and patients with inflammatory bowel disease (IBD). We analyzed telephone activity at an IBD care center to identify disease and patient characteristics associated with high levels of telephone activity and determine if call volume could identify individuals at risk for future visits to the emergency department (ED) or hospitalization. METHODS: We performed a prospective observational study in which we categorized telephone calls received by nursing staff over 2 years at a tertiary care IBD clinic (2475 patients in 2009 and 3118 in 2010). We analyzed data on 21,979 ingoing and outgoing calls in 2009 and 32,667 calls in 2010 and assessed associations between clinical factors and logged telephone encounters, and between patterns of telephone encounters and future visits to the ED or hospitalization. RESULTS: Telephone encounters occurred twice as frequently as office visits; 15% of the patients generated >10 telephone encounters per year and were responsible for half of all telephone encounters. A higher percentage of these high telephone encounter (HTE) patients were female, had Crohn's disease, received steroid treatment, had increased levels of C-reactive protein and rates of erythrocyte sedimentation, had psychiatric comorbidities, and had chronic abdominal pain than patients with lower telephone encounters. The HTE patients were also more frequently seen in the ED or hospitalized over the same time period and in subsequent years. Forty-two percent of patients with >8 telephone encounters within 30 days were seen in the ED or hospitalized within the subsequent 12 months. CONCLUSIONS: Based on an analysis of telephone records at an IBD clinic, 15% of patients account for half of all calls. These HTE patients are a heterogeneous group with refractory disease who are likely to visit the ED or be hospitalized.},

   abstract = {The essential micronutrient zinc has long been known to be a functional component of diverse structural proteins and enzymes. More recently, important roles for free or loosely bound intracellular zinc as a signaling factor have been reported. Insufficient zinc intake was shown to exacerbate symptoms in mouse models of inflammation such as experimental colitis, while zinc supplementation was found to improve intestinal barrier function. Herein, we provide evidence that intracellular zinc is essential for maintaining intestinal epithelial integrity when cells are exposed to the inflammatory cytokine Tumor Necrosis Factor (TNF)alpha. Using the human intestinal Caco-2/TC7 cell line as an in vitro model, we demonstrate that depletion of intracellular zinc affects TNFalpha-triggered signaling by shifting intestinal cell fate from survival to death. The mechanism underlying this effect was investigated. We show that TNFalpha promotes a zinc-dependent survival pathway that includes modulation of gene expression of transcription factors and signaling proteins. We have identified multiple regulatory steps regulated by zinc availability which include the induction of cellular Inhibitor of APoptosis (cIAP2) mRNA, possibly through activation of Nuclear Factor-Kappa B (NF-kappaB), as both nuclear translocation of the p65 subunit of NF-kappaB and up-regulation of cIAP2 mRNA were impaired following zinc depletion. Moreover, X-linked inhibitor of apoptosis protein level was profoundly reduced by zinc depletion. Our results provide a possible molecular explanation for the clinical observation that zinc supplements ameliorate Crohn's disease symptoms and decrease intestinal permeability in experimental colitis.},

   abstract = {BACKGROUND: Previous investigations have produced mixed findings on whether youth with inflammatory bowel disease (IBD) experience elevated rates of depressive symptoms. Our first aim was to compare self-report of depressive symptoms by youth with IBD with a community sample. The second aim was to examine the relationship between symptoms of depression and measures of disease activity. METHODS: Item-level responses on the Children's Depression Inventory among a sample of 78 youth diagnosed with IBD were compared with responses from a community sample using 1-sample t-tests. Particular attention was given to items assessing somatic symptoms of depression given the potential overlap with IBD disease symptoms. The relationship between depressive symptoms and IBD disease activity was evaluated using Spearman's rank correlation coefficients and linear regression. RESULTS: Youth with IBD reported lower levels of depressive symptoms compared with the community sample on the Children's Depression Inventory Total Score, and similar or lower levels of difficulty on items assessing somatic symptoms. Most of the sample had inactive or mild disease activity at the time of participation, with 14% experiencing moderate/severe disease activity. Higher ratings of disease activity were related to greater depressive symptoms. Responses on somatic items from the Children's Depression Inventory were not differentially related to disease activity. CONCLUSIONS: As a group, pediatric patients with IBD did not experience the clinical levels of depressive symptoms or elevations in depressive symptoms when compared with a community sample. Somatic symptoms of depression do not differentiate youth with IBD experiencing elevations in disease activity from youth experiencing nonsomatic symptoms of depression.},

   abstract = {BACKGROUND & AIMS: A previous randomized, placebo-controlled study showed that infliximab maintenance therapy prevented recurrence of Crohn's disease 1 year after an ileocolonic resection. We evaluated recurrence of Crohn's disease, on the basis of endoscopic examination and/or the need for additional surgical resection, beyond the first postoperative year. METHODS: In a prospective, open-label, long-term follow-up study, 24 patients previously randomly assigned to receive infliximab for 1 year after an ileocolonic resection were given the option to continue, stop, or start infliximab therapy. The primary end point was the time to recurrence of Crohn's disease, on the basis of endoscopic evidence (endoscopic recurrence), from the initial assignment to postoperative infliximab or placebo. Secondary end points were rate of endoscopic recurrence, time to reoperation, and rate of surgical recurrence in relation to the total time on infliximab. RESULTS: All patients were followed for at least 5 years after surgery. Patients assigned to the infliximab group in the first year after surgery had a longer mean time to first endoscopic recurrence (1231 +/- 747 days) than patients originally assigned to the placebo group (460 +/- 121 days, P = .003). Colonoscopies identified Crohn's disease recurrence in 22.2% of patients who received long-term infliximab and in 93.9% of those not on infliximab (P < .0001). Compared with no infliximab, the adjusted rate ratio for being in endoscopic remission while on infliximab was 13.47 (95% confidence interval, 3.52-61.53; P = .0001). Patients originally assigned to the infliximab group had a mean longer time to surgery (1798 +/- 359 days) than patients originally assigned to the placebo group (1058 +/- 529 days, P = .04). The rate of surgical recurrence (required additional surgical resection) was significantly lower among patients who received infliximab for most of the follow-up period than patients who received it for shorter periods (20.0% vs 64.3%, P = .047). CONCLUSIONS: Postoperative infliximab maintenance beyond 1 year prevents recurrence of Crohn's disease.},

   abstract = {BACKGROUND: Managing patients with inflammatory bowel disease requires multidisciplinary coordination. Technological advances have enhanced access to care for patients and improved physician interactions. The primary aim of our project was to convene diverse institutions and specialties through a multisite virtual conferencing platform to discuss complex patient management. METHODS: The case conference is designed to include multiple institutions to exchange ideas, review evidence-based data, and provide input on the management of patients with Crohn's disease and ulcerative colitis. Technology is supplied and coordinated by an information technology specialist and Chorus Call, Inc., an international teleconferencing service provider. The Inflammatory Bowel Disease Live Interinstitutional Interdisciplinary Videoconference Education (IBD LIVE) initiative is accredited by the University of Pittsburgh Medical Center (UPMC) Center for Continuing Education in the Health Sciences for 1 AMA PRA Category 1 Credit per weekly session. RESULTS: IBD LIVE began in 2009 comprising only adult gastroenterology and pediatric gastroenterology from UPMC Presbyterian and Children's Hospitals. Participation steadily increased from 5 sites in 2010 to 11 sites in 2014. Maximum attendance for a single conference was 73 participants with a median of 48. The Continuing Medical Education scores (1 = worst to 5 = best) have a high median overall score (4.6, range 3.2-5.0) with positive responses with regard to the degree to which the conference changed practice. CONCLUSIONS: IBD LIVE has been successful and continues to grow. Implementation of the Crohn's and Colitis Foundation of America Virtual Preceptor Program using the IBD LIVE platform will provide expanded national physician access to this professional education activity.},

The epidemiology of CD in Cardiff showed a significant association with the River Taff, in which Map can be detected on a regular basis. We have previously hypothesized that aerosols from the river might influence the epidemiology of CD. In this preliminary study, we detected Map by quantitative PCR in one of five aerosol samples collected above the River Taff. In addition, we examined domestic showers from different regions in the U.K. and detected Map in three out of 30 independent samples. In detecting Map in river aerosols and those from domestic showers, this is the first study to provide evidence that aerosols are an exposure route for Map to humans and may play a role in the epidemiology of CD.},

   abstract = {BACKGROUND: The therapeutic effect of enteral nutrition in Crohn's disease (CD) and the epidemiological associations between diet and inflammatory bowel disease (IBD) implicate diet in IBD causation. There is little evidence, however, to support specific dietary changes and patients often receive contradictory advice. AIM: To review the literature on the impacts of diet on IBD causation and activity to produce guidance based on 'best available evidence'. METHOD: Review of Medline, Embase and Cochrane databases from 1975 to 2012 using MeSH headings 'crohn's disease' 'ulcerative colitis' 'enteral' 'diet' 'nutrition' 'fatty acid' and 'food additives'. RESULTS: Enteral nutrition with a formula-defined feed is effective treatment for CD, but approximately 50% of patients relapse within 6 months of return to normal diet. There is no direct evidence of benefit from any other specific dietary modification in CD, but indirect evidence supports recommendation of a low intake of animal fat, insoluble fibre and processed fatty foods containing emulsifiers. Foods tolerated in sustained remission may not be tolerated following relapse. Some evidence supports vitamin D supplementation. In ulcerative colitis (UC), evidence is weaker, but high intakes of meat and margarine correlate with increased UC incidence and high meat intake also correlates with increased likelihood of relapse. CONCLUSIONS: There is little evidence from interventional studies to support specific dietary recommendations. Nevertheless, people with IBD deserve advice based on 'best available evidence' rather than no advice at all, although dietary intake should not be inappropriately restrictive. Further interventional studies of dietary manipulation are urgently required.},

   abstract = {BACKGROUND: Markers that predict the occurrence of a complicated disease behavior in patients with Crohn's disease (CD) can permit a more aggressive therapeutic regimen for patients at risk. The aim of this cohort study was to test the blood levels of hemoglobin (Hgb) and hematocrit (Hct) for the prediction of complicated CD behavior and CD related surgery in an adult patient population. METHODS: Blood samples of 62 CD patients of the German Inflammatory Bowel Disease-network "Kompetenznetz CED" were tested for the levels of Hgb and Hct prior to the occurrence of complicated disease behavior or CD related surgery. The relation of these markers and clinical events was studied using Kaplan-Meier survival analysis and adjusted COX-proportional hazard regression models. RESULTS: The median follow-up time was 55.8 months. Of the 62 CD patients without any previous complication or surgery 34% developed a complication and/or underwent CD related surgery. Low Hgb or Hct levels were independent predictors of a shorter time to occurrence of the first complication or CD related surgery. This was true for early as well as late occurring complications. Stable low Hgb or Hct during serial follow-up measurements had a higher frequency of complications compared to patients with a stable normal Hgb or Hct, respectively. CONCLUSIONS: Determination of Hgb or Hct in complication and surgery naive CD patients might serve as an additional tool for the prediction of complicated disease behavior.},

   abstract = {Saccharomyces cerevisiae is best known as the baker's and brewer's yeast, but its residual traces are also frequent excipients in some vaccines. Although anti-S. cerevisiae autoantibodies (ASCAs) are considered specific for Crohn's disease, a growing number of studies have detected high levels of ASCAs in patients affected with autoimmune diseases as compared with healthy controls, including antiphospholipid syndrome, systemic lupus erythematosus, type 1 diabetes mellitus, and rheumatoid arthritis. Commensal microorganisms such as Saccharomyces are required for nutrition, proper development of Peyer's aggregated lymphoid tissue, and tissue healing. However, even the commensal nonclassically pathogenic microbiota can trigger autoimmunity when fine regulation of immune tolerance does not work properly. For our purposes, the protein database of the National Center for Biotechnology Information (NCBI) was consulted, comparing Saccharomyces mannan to several molecules with a pathogenetic role in autoimmune diseases. Thanks to the NCBI bioinformation technology tool, several overlaps in molecular structures (50-100 %) were identified when yeast mannan, and the most common autoantigens were compared. The autoantigen U2 snRNP B'' was found to conserve a superfamily protein domain that shares 83 % of the S. cerevisiae mannan sequence. Furthermore, ASCAs may be present years before the diagnosis of some associated autoimmune diseases as they were retrospectively found in the preserved blood samples of soldiers who became affected by Crohn's disease years later. Our results strongly suggest that ASCAs' role in clinical practice should be better addressed in order to evaluate their predictive or prognostic relevance.},

   abstract = {OBJECTIVE: To investigate mucosal cytokine gene expression levels in healed mucosa after anti-tumor necrosis factor (TNF) therapy in patients with Crohn's disease (CD) as possible risk factors for relapse after discontinuation of therapy. DESIGN: Thirty-seven CD patients treated with anti-TNF agents until complete mucosal healing, documented by endoscopy, discontinued anti-TNF treatment and entered a follow-up study. Levels of mRNA expression of interleukin (IL)17A (IL17A), IL23, interferon-gamma (IFNG), TNF-alpha (TNF), IL10 and Forkhead Box P3 (FOXP3) were measured in biopsies from healed mucosa and analyzed as possible risk factors of relapse. Mucosal cytokine transcript levels from patients without CD served as controls. RESULTS: Patients were followed after therapy withdrawal until relapse. Median time to relapse was 20 and 68 weeks for patients with elevated and normalized IL17A and TNF expression levels, respectively (p = 0.02 for IL17A and p = 0.003 for TNF, log-rank). Expression levels of TNF, IL17A and FOXP3 were significantly higher in patients who relapsed before 26 weeks than in those who did not relapse, and also higher in patients with relapse before week 52 versus non-relapsers. Elevated expression levels of TNF and IL17A in healed mucosa significantly increased the risk of relapse (HR = 3.4, p = 0.03, sensitivity 80%, specificity 38% and HR = 4.1, p = 0.008, sensitivity 81%, specificity 61%, respectively). CONCLUSIONS: Normalization of mucosal gene expression of cytokines after anti-TNF therapy does not occur in all patients with healed mucosa as judged by endoscopy. Normalization of TNF and/or IL17A expression predicts long-term remission.},

   abstract = {BACKGROUND: Inflammatory bowel disease (IBD) starting during childhood has been assumed to impair quality of life (QoL) of affected children. As this aspect is crucial for further personality development, the health-related quality of life (HRQOL) was assessed in a Swiss nationwide cohort to obtain detailed information on the fields of impairment. METHODS: Data were prospectively acquired from pediatric patients included in the Swiss IBD Cohort Study. IBD activity was evaluated by PCDAI and PUCAI. The age adapted KIDSCREEN questionnaire was evaluated for 110 children with IBD (64 with Crohn's disease 46 with ulcerative colitis). Data were analyzed with respect to established reference values of healthy controls. RESULTS: In the KIDSCREEN index a moderate impairment was only found for physical wellbeing due to disease activity. In contrast, mental well-being and social support were even better as compared to control values. A subgroup analysis revealed that this observation was restricted to the children in the German speaking part of Switzerland, whereas there was no difference compared to controls in the French part of Switzerland. Furthermore, autonomy and school variables were significantly higher in the IBD patients as compared to controls. CONCLUSIONS: The social support for children with IBD is excellent in this cohort. Only physical well-being was impaired due to disease activity, whereas all other KIDSCREEN parameters were better as compared to controls. This indicates that effective coping and support strategies may be able to compensate the burden of disease in pediatric IBD patients.},

   abstract = {The intestinal mucosa possesses a complex epithelial barrier and a well-organized local immune system, which both efficiently protect this internal-external surface against potential microbial aggressions while guaranteeing tolerance towards harmless bacteria or antigens (oral tolerance). There is good experimental evidence that the intestinal microbiota is a main driver for the development of the mucosal immune system. Any perturbations/changes of this interaction with the intestinal microbiota or the microbial colonization process may cause health problems with short- and eventually long-term consequences, such as suspected for allergic or dysimmune disorders. Dendritic cells (DC) play a key role in the initiation of immune responses. Immune responses elicited by intestinal DC differ markedly from those initiated by spleen-derived DC: while intestinal DC induce anti-inflammatory and tolerogenic responses to harmless antigens such as derived from the resident microflora or harmless food allergens, systemic immune activation yields in a strong inflammatory TH1/TH17 reaction to the same antigens. The recent discovery how DC functions are regulated and imprinted by the microenvironment (DC conditioning) will be discussed in this review. High concentrations of retinoic acid or vitamin D metabolites, thymic stromal lymphopoietin and/or transforming growth factor-beta (TGF-beta) activate signaling programs in DC that yield in priming of regulatory and anti-inflammatory T cell responses. TGF-beta is one of the key factors implicated in intestinal immune regulation; it is produced by a large variety of cells in the intestinal mucosa, including intestinal epithelial cells, lymphocytes and monocytes/macrophages/DC. An important anti-inflammatory effect of TGF-beta on the immune system is the promotion and generation of FOXP3-positive regulatory T cells in the intestinal compartment. There are first and encouraging data from the treatment of Crohn's disease, an inflammatory GI condition, that targeted enteral therapy with optimized concentrations of immunoregulatory peptides, such as TGF-beta, might of interest for the treatment of inflammatory disorders.},

   abstract = {OBJECTIVE: Although paediatric-onset IBD is becoming more common, few medications have a registered paediatric indication. There are multiple hurdles to performing clinical trials in children, emphasising the importance of choosing an appropriate outcome measure, which can facilitate enrolment, and thereby also drug approval. The aim of this consensus statement is to highlight paediatric specific issues and key factors critical for the optimal conduct of paediatric IBD trials. DESIGN: The Paediatric European Crohn's and Colitis Organisation (ECCO) committee has established an international expert panel to determine the best outcome measures in paediatric IBD, following a literature search and a modified Delphi process. All recommendations were endorsed by at least 80% agreement. RESULTS: Recognising the importance of mucosal healing (MH), the panel defined steroid-free MH as primary outcome measure for all drugs of new category with one or two postintervention endoscopies per trial (at 8-12 weeks and/or 54 weeks). Since endoscopic evaluation is a barrier for recruitment in children, trials with medications already shown to induce MH in children or adults, could use paediatric-specific disease activity scores as primary outcome, including a modified Paediatric Crohn's Disease Activity Index in Crohn's disease and the Paediatric Ulcerative Colitis Activity Index in UC. Secondary outcomes should include safety issues, MR enterography-based damage and inflammatory scores (in Crohn's disease), faecal calprotectin, quality of life scales, and a patient-reported outcome. CONCLUSIONS: It is crucial to perform paediatric trials early in the development of new drugs in order to reduce off-label use of IBD medication in children. The thoughtful choice of feasible and standardised outcome measures can help move us towards this goal.},

   abstract = {Inflammatory bowel disorders (IBD) are characterized by chronic and recurrent inflammatory reactions of the intestinal mucosa resulting in progressing ulcerating lesions. Research over the past decade clearly identified in patients with Crohn's disease (CD) a marked dysregulation of the intestinal microbiome (dysbiosis) as one trigger factor in these inflammatory processes, particularly in patients with a high genetic risk. When treating patients with CD, most drugs aim to control the inflammatory process (either by inhibiting inflammatory pathways or by reducing the activity of immune cells). Given the importance of the disturbed interaction between the microbiota and the host immune system, there might be a different therapeutic approach in targeting directly the intestinal microflora. There are good data to believe that the use of exclusive enteral nutrition (EEN) is one such option. Historically, enteral nutrition (EN) was used as supplemental nutritional therapy in CD patients with planned resection surgery. This treatment option showed unexpected and very powerful anti-inflammatory effects, and it was rapidly introduced as induction therapy for active CD. Several clinical trials and case series confirmed the efficacy of EN to induce remission in approximately 80% of patients equaling the potential of steroids. It is well established that EN has this strong anti-inflammatory potential only when given on an exclusive basis, without any additional food. This raises major compliance issues, probably one of the reasons why it is less used in adult patients. A recent study demonstrated that EEN has a specific effect on the intestinal microbiota, which is markedly different from steroid-induced remission, while all patients obtained complete clinical remission. These observations give a first basis for the understanding of the impact of EEN on dysbiosis in patients with CD.},

Treatment strategies must reflect that pediatric-onset UC has a slightly different phenotype than adult-onset disease with more often extensive (pancolitis) and more aggressive disease course. Other pediatric-specific aspects include growth, puberty, bone density accrual and emotional development and body image acquisition. These differences and others influenced the development of pediatric treatment algorithms. It is recommended that virtually all children with UC must be treated with some maintenance therapy and 5-ASA requirement and dosing are often higher in children. A larger number of children are at risk for steroid-dependency, and this should not be tolerated; steroid sparing strategies with early use of immunosuppressors are recommended in high-risk patients. On the other hand, the safety profile of immunosuppressive therapy in children includes the rare forms of lymphomas and many future treatment years. Colectomy and pouch formation should be balanced in the treatment algorithms against the higher rate of future infertility in girls. The acute and on-going management of pediatric UC should be guided by evidence- and consensus-based balanced decisions, reflecting a vision of long-term treatment goals.},

   abstract = {Children and adolescents with Crohn's disease (CD) present often with a more complicated disease course compared to adult patients. In addition, the potential impact of CD on growth, pubertal and emotional development of patients underlines the need for a specific management strategy of pediatric-onset CD. To develop the first evidenced based and consensus driven guidelines for pediatric-onset CD an expert panel of 33 IBD specialists was formed after an open call within the European Crohn's and Colitis Organisation and the European Society of Pediatric Gastroenterolog, Hepatology and Nutrition. The aim was to base on a thorough review of existing evidence a state of the art guidance on the medical treatment and long term management of children and adolescents with CD, with individualized treatment algorithms based on a benefit-risk analysis according to different clinical scenarios. In children and adolescents who did not have finished their growth, exclusive enteral nutrition (EEN) is the induction therapy of first choice due to its excellent safety profile, preferable over corticosteroids, which are equipotential to induce remission. The majority of patients with pediatric-onset CD require immunomodulator based maintenance therapy. The experts discuss several factors potentially predictive for poor disease outcome (such as severe perianal fistulizing disease, severe stricturing/penetrating disease, severe growth retardation, panenteric disease, persistent severe disease despite adequate induction therapy), which may incite to an anti-TNF-based top down approach. These guidelines are intended to give practical (whenever possible evidence-based) answers to (pediatric) gastroenterologists who take care of children and adolescents with CD; they are not meant to be a rule or legal standard, since many different clinical scenario exist requiring treatment strategies not covered by or different from these guidelines.},

   abstract = {BACKGROUND: Adjusting to symptom flares, treatment regimens, and side effects places youth with inflammatory bowel disease (IBD) at increased risk for emotional and behavioral problems and adverse disease outcomes. Implementation of psychosocial screening into clinical practice remains a challenge. This study examines the clinical utility of health-related quality of life (HRQOL) screening in predicting disease outcome and healthcare utilization. METHODS: One hundred twelve youth of 7 to 18 years diagnosed with IBD and their parents. Youth completed standardized measures of HRQOL and depression. Parents completed a proxy report of HRQOL. Pediatric gastroenterologists provided the Physician Global Assessment. Families were recruited from a pediatric gastroenterology clinic. Retrospective chart reviews examined disease outcome and healthcare utilization for 12 months after baseline measurement. RESULTS: Linear regressions, controlling for demographic and disease parameters, revealed that baseline measurement of youth and parent proxy-reported HRQOL predicted the number of IBD-related hospital admissions, gastroenterology clinic visits, emergency department visits, psychology clinic visits, telephone contacts, and pain management referrals over the next 12 months. Disease outcome was not significant. CONCLUSIONS: Lower HRQOL was predictive of increased healthcare utilization among youth with IBD. Regular HRQOL screening may be the impetus to providing better case management and allocating resources based on ongoing care needs and costs. Proactive interventions focused on patients with poor HRQOL may be an efficient approach to saving on healthcare costs and resource utilization.},

   abstract = {OBJECTIVE: Crohn's disease (CD) is caused by a complex interplay among genetic, microbial and environmental factors. ATG16L1 is an important genetic factor involved in innate immunity, including autophagy and phagocytosis of microbial components from the gut. We investigated the effect of inflammation on the composition of microbiota in the ileal mucosa of CD patients in relation to the ATG16L1 risk status. DESIGN: Biopsies (n=35) were obtained from inflamed and non-inflamed regions of the terminal ileum of 11 CD patients homozygous for the ATG16L1 risk allele (ATG16L1-T300A) and 9 CD patients homozygous for the ATG16L1 protective allele (ATG16L1-T300). Biopsy DNA was extracted and the bacterial composition analysed by pyrosequencing. Intracellular survival rates of adherent-invasive Escherichia coli (AIEC) were analysed by determining colony forming units after exposure to monocytes isolated from healthy volunteers homozygous for the ATG16L1 risk or protective allele. RESULTS: Inflamed ileal tissue from patients homozygous for the ATG16L1 risk allele contained increased numbers of Fusobacteriaceae, whereas inflamed ileal tissue of patients homozygous for the ATG16L1 protective allele showed decreased numbers of Bacteroidaceae and Enterobacteriaceae and increased Lachnospiraceae. The ATG16L1 allele did not affect the bacterial composition in the non-inflamed ileal tissue. Monocytes homozygous for the ATG16L1 risk allele showed impaired killing of AIEC under inflammatory conditions compared with those homozygous for the ATG16L1 protective allele. CONCLUSIONS: CD patients homozygous for the ATG16L1-T300A risk allele show impaired clearance of pathosymbionts in ileal inflammation indicating that ATG16L1 is essential for effective elimination of pathosymbionts upon inflammation.},

The most severe form of short bowel syndrome occurs in patients having jejunostomy, whose treatment is discussed separately. The authors give a detailed overview of home parenteral feeding, its possible complications, outcomes and adaptation of the remaining bowel. They describe how their own care centre operates where they administer home parenteral nutrition to 12 patients with short bowel syndrome (5 females and 7 males aged 51.25+/-14.4 years). The body mass index was 19.07+/-5.08 kg/m2 and 20.87+/-3.3 kg/m2, skeletal muscle mass was 25.7+/-6.3 kg and 26.45+/-5.38 kg, and body fat mass was 14.25+/-8.55 kg and 11.77+/-2.71 kg at the start of home parenteral nutrition and presently, respectively. The underlying conditions of short bowel syndrome were tumours in 4 patients, bowel ischaemia in four patients, surgical complications in three patients, Crohn's disease in one patient, and Crohn's disease plus tumour in one patient.},

   abstract = {BACKGROUND: Crohn's disease (CD) may involve any part of the gastrointestinal tract. We assessed the prevalence and features of upper gastrointestinal (UGI) lesions in CD. METHODS: This was a retrospective study that included 138 CD patients that underwent esophagogastroduodenoscopy (EGD). The rate of Crohn's specific endoscopic lesions in the esophagus, stomach, and duodenum was assessed, and immunohistochemical analysis was performed. Changes in the UGI lesions were assessed in those who had two or more EGD. RESULTS: Of 138 patients, 51.3% had Crohn's specific UGI lesions. The rates of Crohn's specific lesion in the esophagus, upper-to-middle stomach, lower stomach, duodenal bulb, and 2nd portion of the duodenum were 6.5%, 47.8%, 24.6%, 31.9%, and 18.1%, respectively. Granulomas were detected in 6.1%, 25.0%, and 11.4% in the upper-to-middle stomach, lower stomach, and duodenal bulb, respectively, but none in the esophagus and 2nd portion of the duodenum. Thirty-seven were analyzed for Helicobacter pylori and 4 were positive (10.8%). Improvements of UGI lesions were seen in 14 out of 49 (28.5%) and were unchanged in 59.2% and worsened in 12.2%. CONCLUSIONS: The prevalence of Crohn's specific UGI lesions was common in our case series, and immunohistochemical studies suggested that the majority was unrelated to Helicobacter pylori infection. Worsening of UGI lesions over the course was rare.},

   abstract = {Abundant clinical and experimental evidence supports a role for resident microbiota in Crohn's disease and pouchitis, and probably in ulcerative colitis (UC). These disorders occur in areas of highest bacterial concentrations. Pouchitis and Crohn's colitis respond to antibiotics, while pouchitis and UC can be treated with probiotics. Serologic markers recognizing intestinal bacteria and yeast are present in the majority of Crohn's disease patients and may predict disease aggressiveness. Abnormal profiles of fecal and mucosally associated enteric bacteria (dysbiosis) occur in Crohn's disease, UC, pouchitis and experimental enterocolitis, with a proliferation of aggressive species that promote experimental colitis and a corresponding decrease in protective bacterial subsets. Many of these protective bacteria produce short-chain fatty acids, including butyrate, that promote epithelial barrier function, inhibit effector immune responses and induce regulatory T cell subsets. Furthermore, certain Clostridia species stimulate regulatory T cells that can inhibit intestinal inflammation. Animal models of chronic, immune-mediated enterocolitis convincingly demonstrate that enteric resident bacteria stimulate effector immune cells in susceptible hosts and that a subset of enteric bacteria has particularly aggressive activities, with host and bacterial specificity. Recent studies suggest parallel and perhaps complementary roles for enteric viruses, which have only very recently been identified.},

   abstract = {BACKGROUND & AIMS: Short bowel syndrome (SBS) and intestinal failure (IF) are multi-factorial conditions which in adults result from extensive intestinal resection. NOD2 is an intracellular pattern recognition receptor associated with CD. An unexpected high frequency of NOD2 mutations has been found in patients undergoing intestinal transplantation (35%). The role of NOD2 in a cohort with SBS/IF not specifically requiring intestinal transplantation has not been studied yet. METHODS: The course of 85 patients with non-malignant SBS/IF was characterized. The major NOD2 mutations, as well as ATG16L1 and IL23R were determined. The allele frequencies were compared to the published frequencies of CD patients and controls. RESULTS: In non-CD patients (72%) allele frequencies of NOD2 mutations were statistically more frequent than in controls (14% vs 6%, p = 0.006). In CD patients (28%) allele frequencies were not different between SBS and controls (29% vs 22%, p = 0.23). NOD2 mutations were neither associated with parameters potentially heralding the need for transplantation nor with an earlier time to the indication for intestinal transplantation. CONCLUSIONS: NOD2 mutations are associated with the development of SBS/IF in the absence of CD, but not with specific complications. NOD2 mutations may increase the risk for more extensive intestinal resection or may impair intestinal adaptation.},

   abstract = {BACKGROUND: Inflammatory bowel diseases (IBD) commonly affect young patients in the reproductive phase of their lives. The chronic and relapsing nature of IBD and the potential need for medical or surgical interventions raise concerns about family planning issues. AIM: To review the current knowledge on IBD management in pregnant and nursing IBD patients. METHODS: A PubMed literature search was performed using the search terms 'reproduction' and 'inflammatory bowel disease' and using the headers and main subjects of each section of this article as search terms. RESULTS: Male and female fertility are not impaired in the majority of IBD patients. In IBD patients with quiescent disease pregnancy outcomes are not impaired in comparison to the general population, however, an increased incidence of pregnancy complications is observed in active IBD patients. As methotrexate (MTX) has been demonstrated to be teratogenic, the use of MTX is contraindicated in patients, who wish to conceive, throughout pregnancy and when nursing. However, normal pregnancies following MTX treatment at conception and later have been reported. Most of the other currently approved IBD medications are not associated with adverse pregnancy outcomes and may be used to maintain quiescent disease or to induce a rapid remission in patients with flares and active disease. Breast-feeding in IBD patients is possible and recommended. CONCLUSIONS: The overall outcome of pregnancies in IBD patients is favourable and not different to healthy controls, thus patients with IBD should not be discouraged from having children.},

   abstract = {BACKGROUND: The optimal treatment strategy for patients with Crohn's disease who have loss of response to the anti-tumor necrosis factor alpha medication infliximab is uncertain. Natalizumab has an alternative mechanism of action, but its use has been limited by the risk of progressive multifocal leukoencephalopathy. In this study, we performed a decision analysis assessing the impact of JC virus (JCV) antibody testing and natalizumab utilization for loss of response to infliximab. METHODS: We constructed a Markov model to assess the difference between unscreened natalizumab use (option 1), JCV antibody testing with natalizumab when appropriate (option 2), and second anti-tumor necrosis factor alpha use (option 3). The base case was a 35-year-old man with severe Crohn's disease with loss of response to infliximab. The time horizon was 3 years. Results are reported in quality-adjusted life years (QALYs). Deterministic and probabilistic analyses were conducted. Markov analysis using a cohort of 5000 individuals was performed. The impact of JCV antibody status on outcomes in this model was assessed. RESULTS: Option 2 was the preferred strategy (2.0880 QALYs), followed by option 1 (2.0875 QALYs) and option 3 (2.0808 QALYs). Patients in option 2 required fewer surgeries compared with option 3. Previous JCV infection was associated with reduced QALYs with all options that allowed for natalizumab use. CONCLUSIONS: JCV antibody testing and subsequent treatment selection yield improved outcomes over natalizumab without testing or using only a second anti-tumor necrosis factor alpha in all patients.},

   abstract = {PURPOSE: Children with perianal Crohn's disease (PCD) are a unique and diverse patient population. The purpose of this study was to describe the spectrum of disease and role of surgery. METHODS: A retrospective chart review of all children having at least one surgical intervention for PCD over 10 years was performed. RESULTS: Fifty-seven patients (63% male) aged 0.5-17 (median 13) years were identified. Perianal disease consisted of skin tags (49%), superficial fistulae (49%), deep fistulae (37%), superficial abscesses (68%), deep abscesses (9%), skin breakdown (19%), and anal strictures (7%). 84% received anti-TNF therapy, with 27% treated with a second anti-TNF medication. Minor surgical procedures, commonly done during anti-TNF therapy, included abscess drainage (67%) and seton placement (33%). Major surgical procedures, done almost exclusively after anti-TNF failure, included defunctioning ileostomy (23%) and subtotal colectomy (9%). Follow-up ranged from 7 to 160 (median 54) months. CONCLUSIONS: Pediatric PCD has a wide range of disease severity. Minor surgery provides adequate drainage before and during anti-TNF therapy, while major surgery plays a role in medically refractory disease. Appropriate surgical intervention remains an important part of the treatment paradigm.},

   abstract = {Esophageal polyps are uncommon findings in pediatric patients, and reports have been limited to case reports. Esophageal polyps have been previously ascribed to esophagitis secondary to gastroesophageal reflux, medications, infections and recurrent vomiting. They have been associated with underlying conditions such as hiatal hernia, Barrett's esophagus, eosinophilic esophagitis and Crohn's disease. Presenting complaints of children with esophageal polyps have included vomiting, dysphagia, hematemesis and abdominal pain. The aim of this paper is to characterize the incidence, clinical presentation and progression, histologic subtypes and associated mucosal abnormalities in children with esophageal polyps. A retrospective multicenter study was performed at four institutions identifying diagnosis of esophageal polyps in pediatric patients (<21 years). Information was obtained from patient charts, endoscopy reports and histopathology reports. Specimens and slides were examined by experienced pediatric pathologists for all included cases. Esophageal polyps were identified in 13 patients (9 M) from 9438 esophagogastroduodenoscopies (0.14%). Mean age of subjects was 9.2 years. Vomiting was the most common indication for endoscopy. Polyp location was at the gastroesophageal junction in 7 of the 13 cases. Most polyps were inflammatory (n = 7). Esophagitis was noted in 69% of those with esophageal polyps. Repeat endoscopies in six patients at a mean interval of 8 months noted persistence of polyps in all six patients. This paper is the first to characterize esophageal polyps in pediatrics. These polyps are rare in children and often are associated with esophagitis. Presenting complaints seem to vary by age. Polyps did not consistently change with either time or acid suppression. The optimal management strategy has yet to be defined and likely depends on the underlying pathophysiologic process.},

In the other hand, Crohn's disease is frequently associated with nutritional deficiencies probably as result of disease activity and poor oral intake. AIMS: To investigate the dietary intake in patients with Crohn's disease in comparison with matched population controls and to assess the correlation between the results of the dietary enquete, nutritional status and disease activity. METHODS: We conducted a prospective case control study in patients with Crohn's disease and matched controls. All subjects were evaluated in respect of dietary intake (based on "NUTISTAR" logiciel) and nutritional status. RESULTS: We studied 23 patients and 23 controls. There was no statistical difference between patients and controls according to the proportion of carbohydrates, fat and protein intakes. Energy intakes were significantly lower in patients with Crohn's disease (1991 + 678 kcal/j) compared to controls (2537 + 345 kcal/j) (p=0.007) ; and in active disease (1353 + 308 kcal/j) compared to inactive disease patients (2481 + 415 kcal/j) (p<0.0001). In Crohn's disease patients, correlation study showed that energy intakes were correlated with CDAI (p<0.0001 ; r = - 0.74) and BMI (p=0.03 ; r = 0.45). CONCLUSION: In Crohn's disease, an inadequate dietary intake is correlated with nutritional status and disease activity.},

   abstract = {BACKGROUND: SLC22A23 is an orphan gene in the SLC22 family of organic membrane transporters, and its single-nucleotide polymorphism rs17309827-T was recently nominally associated with intestinal inflammation in a genome-wide association study. Other polymorphisms in the SLC22A23 gene have been associated with diseases with an inflammatory component, and polymorphisms in related genes in the SLC22 family have been repeatedly associated with inflammatory bowel disease (IBD). OBJECTIVE: In a candidate-gene study using a well-phenotyped, highly monitored, Manitoban white cohort, we investigated whether variations in SLC22A23 were associated with intestinal inflammation. DESIGN: Selected genetic variations were genotyped by using fluorescent-based assays or a polymerase chain reaction-restriction fragment length polymorphism analysis in 160 individuals with Crohn disease, 149 individuals with ulcerative colitis, and 142 healthy control subjects to determine genetic associations. RESULTS: Homozygocity for single-nucleotide polymorphisms rs4959235-TT and rs950318-GG was associated with IBD, whereby 6% of patients (18 of 311 cases) carried these genotypes, but they were not seen in healthy controls. CONCLUSION: Associations reported in this article add to the emerging evidence that SLC22A23 variants could modify IBD risk. However, the biology of the gene and impact of variations on the gene's functions need to be tested to validate a causative role.},

   abstract = {Growth failure is common in children with inflammatory bowel disease (IBD), mainly those with Crohn's disease (CD). The prevalence of growth failure varies in different cohorts, mainly due to the heterogeneity of the population treated by the reporting centers (primary vs. referral), but can be as high as 40% of the cases. Factors related to growth impairment in CD include low dietary intake, stool loss, increased energy and nutrient requirements, the use of medications (for example, steroids interfere with the IGF-1 axis), disease activity (the effect of inflammation on growth), genetic background (parents height), and physical activity. In animals, malnutrition, genetic polymorphism, elevated pro inflammatory cytokines, and exposure to lipopolysaccharide are involved in growth impairment in IBD, while malnutrition, genetic polymorphism and increased inflammation have been shown to be associated with growth impairment in humans. Exclusive enteral nutrition (EEN) is the preferred first line treatment in CD. EEN induces remission, prolongs remission and affects growth failure via its effect on malnutrition and inflammation. However, similar to drug treatment, EEN effect on growth failure is limited, most probably due to incomplete control of inflammation. Children with IBD should be assessed for growth on diagnosis and on each follow-up visit. New nutritional strategies, identification of genetic polymorphisms that respond to EN, and methods to increase lean body mass (physical activity) are needed in order to improve growth in our IBD patients.},

   abstract = {INTRODUCTION: We previously reported our experience with standard laparoscopic ileocecectomy, but we have recently used a single-incision laparoscopic approach. PATIENTS AND METHODS: We conducted a retrospective review of a single surgeon's experience from 2009 to 2013. RESULTS: Twenty-eight children 11-18 years of age (mean, 15.5 years) with a mean body mass index of 18.9+/-3 kg/m(2) underwent single-incision laparoscopic ileocecectomy for Crohn's disease. Mean operative time was 86.5+/-25.9 minutes (range, 56-166 minutes). There were no extra ports placed or conversions to open surgery. Five children (18%) were on parenteral nutrition at time of surgery, 14 (50%) were on steroids, and 9 (32%) were on tumor necrotic factor inhibitors. A stapled extracorporeal anastomosis was performed in all children. Complications included abscess (n=4), small bowel obstruction (n=3), superficial wound infection (n=3), and small bowel perforation (n=1). Some patients had more than one complication. Of those with complications, 5 (56%) were on steroids, 5 (56%) were on tumor necrotic factor inhibitors, and 1 patient was on both. The perforation occurred at a point of adhesiolysis also involved with Crohn's disease. There were no anastomotic leaks. Median follow-up was 17 months (range, 1-47 months). CONCLUSIONS: Single-incision laparoscopic ileocecectomy is safe and feasible in pediatric patients with Crohn's disease.},

   abstract = {BACKGROUND: Infliximab (IFX), an established therapy for pediatric Crohn disease (CD), is also efficacious in treating psoriasis, a skin disorder, in which tumor necrosis factor-alpha is implicated pathogenically. Paradoxically, there have been numerous reports of new-onset psoriasis following tumor necrosis factor-alpha antagonist therapy in adult patients with inflammatory bowel disease, but pediatric data are sparse. METHODS: A retrospective review of all IFX-treated patients with CD, who subsequently developed psoriasis, at a single pediatric inflammatory bowel disease center, was performed. A subset of affected patients (10/18) and CD controls (147 of 172) treated with IFX but without the development of psoriasis were genotyped for polymorphisms in the interleukin-23 receptor (IL-23R) gene, which has been identified as conferring susceptibility to both CD and psoriasis. RESULTS: Eighteen (10.5%) of 172 IFX-treated patients with CD developed new-onset psoriasis (n = 17) or worsening of existing psoriasis (n = 1). The duration of IFX exposure was variable, ranging from 1 to 25 infusions. Three patients discontinued IFX because of this complication. Most patients responded well to topical steroid therapy. In comparison to disease-matched controls, patients with CD developing psoriasis following IFX therapy were more likely to be homozygous for specific polymorphisms in the IL-23R gene (rs10489628, rs10789229, and rs1343151). CONCLUSIONS: As in adults, the development of psoriasis or psoriasiform skin lesions occurs in pediatric patients with CD treated with IFX. Adequately powered studies are required to further explore the preliminary findings reported here to determine whether polymorphisms in the IL-23R gene have a role in the pathogenesis of this paradoxical process, which presently remains unexplained.},

   abstract = {Neonatal-onset inflammatory bowel disease (IBD) accounts for only 0.25% of pediatric IBD cases. The molecular pathogenesis of IBD remains unclear. Recently, rare Mendelian mutations have been identified in children with very early-onset Crohn's disease and ulcerative colitis. In this study, we report compound heterozygous mutations in the interleukin-10 receptor A (IL-10RA) gene in children with severe neonatal-onset IBD. Patient 1 had chronic diarrhea within the first month of life and had perianal fistulae. She was diagnosed with 'intractable ulcerating enterocolitis in infancy' and underwent subtotal colectomy at the age of 24 months because of poor response to immunosuppressant therapy. Compound heterozygous mutations, c.[301C>T];[350G>A](p.[R101W];[R117H]), were discovered in IL-10RA for this patient. Patient 2 presented symptoms within the first month of life and was diagnosed with Crohn's disease. Severe colitis and perianal and enteroenteric fistulae occurred repeatedly, and he underwent surgical management involving colectomy, colostomy, and ileostomy. We identified mutations in IL-10RA, c.[272A>G];[784C>T] (p.[Y91C];[R262C]). Patient 3 had chronic diarrhea and a rectovaginal fistula at 3 days of life and was diagnosed with Crohn's disease. She underwent fistulectomy and ileostomy, but experienced frequent relapses. Mutations, c.[272A>G];[301C>T] (p.[Y91C];[R101W]), were found in IL-10RA. This report confirms the genetic defect of IL-10RA in neonatal-onset IBD including 'intractable ulcerating enterocolitis in infancy'.},

   abstract = {BACKGROUND: There are few reports from Iran about the epidemiology and clinical features of inflammatory bowel disease (IBD). This study aims to determine the epidemiologic profile and clinical features of IBD in Northwest Iran referral centers. METHODS: In a cross-sectional setting, we evaluated 200 patients with definitive diagnoses of IBD who referred to Tabriz educational hospitals during the period of 2005 to 2007. Demographic characteristics as well as patients' clinical profiles were evaluated. Disease activity and severity were determined by the Crohn's Disease Activity Index and Truelove and Witt's classification of ulcerative colitis (UC). The related probable demographic factors were tested. RESULTS: Of the 200 IBD patients, 183 (91.5%) were diagnosed with UC and 17 (8.5%) with Crohn's disease (CD). There was a positive first degree relative of IBD in 10.9% of UC and 11.8% of CD patients. Abdominal pain was the primary presenting symptom in 25.7% of UC patients and in 58.8% of those with CD. Among UC patients, left-sided colitis was the main feature (52.5%); while in patients with CD, colon involvement was predominant (52.9%). There was no significant contributor for activity or severity of disease noted among demographic factors. CONCLUSION: The occurrence of UC was much higher than CD. The onset of IBD occurred in younger ages with a predominance in males. Left-sided colitis in UC and colon involvement in CD was common. Mostly, the pattern of IBD was mild to moderate with good response to pharmacotherapy. Disease activity and severity were unaffected by demographic features.},

   abstract = {UNLABELLED: BACKGROUND OBJECTIVES: The relationship between the enteroendocrine hormone glucagon-like peptide 2 (GLP-2) and intestinal inflammation is unclear. GLP-2 promotes mucosal growth, decreases permeability and reduces inflammation in the intestine; physiological stimulation of GLP-2 release is triggered by nutrient contact. The authors hypothesized that ileal Crohn disease (CD) affects GLP-2 release. METHODS: With ethics board approval, pediatric patients hospitalized with CD were studied; controls were recruited from local schools. Inclusion criteria were endoscopy-confirmed CD (primarily of the small intestine) with a disease activity index >150. Fasting and postprandial GLP-2 levels and quantitative urinary recovery of orally administered 3-O-methyl-glucose (active transport) and lactulosemannitol (passive) were quantified during the acute and remission phases. RESULTS: Seven patients (mean [+/- SD] age 15.3 +/- 1.3 years) and 10 controls (10.3 +/- 1.6 years) were studied. In patients with active disease, fasting levels of GLP-2 remained stable but postprandial levels were reduced. Patients with active disease exhibited reduced glucose absorption and increased lactulosemannitol recovery; all normalized with disease remission. The change in the lactulosemannitol ratio was due to both reduced lactulose and increased mannitol absorption. CONCLUSIONS: These findings suggest that pediatric patients with acute ileal CD have decreased postprandial GLP-2 release, reduced glucose absorption and increased intestinal permeability. Healing of CD resulted in normalization of postprandial GLP-2 release and mucosal functioning (nutrient absorption and permeability), the latter due to an increase in mucosal surface area. These findings have implications for the use of GLP-2 and feeding strategies as a therapy in CD patients; further studies of the effects of inflammation and the GLP-2 axis are recommended.},

   abstract = {BACKGROUND: Exclusive enteral nutrition is effective for inducing remission in active pediatric Crohn's disease. Partial enteral nutrition (PEN) with free diet is ineffective for inducing remission, suggesting that the mechanism depends on exclusion of free diet. We developed an alternative diet based on PEN with exclusion of dietary components hypothesized to affect the microbiome or intestinal permeability. METHODS: Children and young adults with active disease defined as a pediatric Crohn's disease activity index >7.5 or Harvey-Bradshaw index >/=4 received a 6-week structured Crohn's disease exclusion diet that allowed access to specific foods and restricted exposure to all other foods, and up to 50% of dietary calories from a polymeric formula. Remission, C-reactive protien, and erythrocyte sedimentation rate were reevaluated at 6 weeks. The primary endpoint was remission at 6 weeks defined as Harvey-Bradshaw index </=3 for all patients and pediatric Crohn's disease activity index <7.5 in children. RESULTS: We treated 47 patients (mean age, 16.1 +/- 5.6 yr; 34 children). Response and remission were obtained in 37 (78.7%) and 33 (70.2%) patients, respectively. Mean pediatric Crohn's disease activity index decreased from 27.7 +/- 9.4 to 5.4 +/- 8 (P < 0.001), Harvey-Bradshaw index from 6.4 +/- 2.7 to 1.8 +/- 2.9 (P < 0.001). Remission was obtained in 70% of children and 69% of adults. Normalization of previously elevated CRP occurred in 21 of 30 (70%) patients in remission. Seven patients used the diet without PEN; 6 of 7 obtained remission. CONCLUSIONS: Dietary therapy involving PEN with an exclusion diet seems to lead to high remission rates in early mild-to-moderate luminal Crohn's disease in children and young adults.},

   abstract = {BACKGROUND: Although the etiology of two major forms of inflammatory bowel disease (IBD), Crohn's disease (CD) and ulcerative colitis (UC) are unknown and evidence suggests that chronic intestinal inflammation is caused by an excessive immune response to mucosal antigens. Previous studies support the role for TGF-beta1 through 3 in the initiation and maintenance of tolerance via the induction of regulatory T cells (Tregs) to control intestinal inflammation. Leptin, a satiety hormone produced primarily by adipose tissue, has been shown to increase during colitis progression and is believed to contribute to disease genesis and/or progression. AIM: We investigated the ability of a pegylated leptin antagonist (PG-MLA) to ameliorate the development of chronic experimental colitis. RESULTS: Compared to vehicle control animals, PG-MLA treatment of mice resulted in an (1) attenuated clinical score; (2) reversed colitis-associated pathogenesis including a decrease in body weight; (3) reduced systemic and mucosal inflammatory cytokine expression; (4) increased insulin levels and (5) enhanced systemic and mucosal Tregs and CD39(+) Tregs in mice with chronic colitis. The percentage of systemic and mucosal TGF-beta1, -beta2 and -beta3 expressing CD4(+) T cells were augmented after PG-MLA treatment. The activation of STAT1 and STAT3 and the expression of Smad7 were also reduced after PG-MLA treatment in the colitic mice. These findings clearly suggest that PG-MLA treatment reduces intestinal Smad7 expression, restores TGF-beta1-3 signaling and reduces STAT1/STAT3 activation that may increase the number of Tregs to ameliorate chronic colitis. CONCLUSION: This study clearly links inflammation with the metabolic hormone leptin suggesting that nutritional status influences immune tolerance through the induction of functional Tregs. Inhibiting leptin activity through PG-MLA might provide a new and novel therapeutic strategy for the treatment of IBD.},

   abstract = {BACKGROUND AND AIMS: Curcumin, an active ingredient of turmeric with anti-inflammatory properties, has been demonstrated to be useful in experimental models of ulcerative colitis (UC). It's efficacy in humans needs to be investigated. METHODS: A randomized, double-blind, single-centre pilot trial was conducted in patients with distal UC (<25 cm involvement) and mild-to-moderate disease activity. Forty-five patients were randomized to either NCB-02 (standardized curcumin preparation) enema plus oral 5-ASA or placebo enema plus oral 5-ASA. Primary end point was disease response, defined as reduction in Ulcerative Colitis Diseases Activity Index by 3 points at 8 weeks, and secondary end points were improvement in endoscopic activity and disease remission at 8 weeks. RESULTS: Response to treatment was observed in 56.5% in NCB-02 group compared to 36.4% (p=0.175) in placebo group. At week 8, clinical remission was observed in 43.4% of patients in NCB-02 group compared to 22.7% in placebo group (p=0.14) and improvement on endoscopy in 52.2% of patients in NCB-02 group compared to 36.4% of patients in placebo group (p=0.29). Per protocol analysis revealed significantly better outcomes in NCB-02 group, in terms of clinical response (92.9% vs. 50%, p=0.01), clinical remission (71.4% vs. 31.3%, p=0.03), and improvement on endoscopy (85.7% vs. 50%, p=0.04). CONCLUSION: In this pilot study we found some evidence that use of NCB-02 enema may tend to result in greater improvements in disease activity compared to placebo in patients with mild-to-moderate distal UC. The role of NCB-02 as a novel therapy for UC should be investigated further.},

THE AIM OF THE STUDY: The assessment of the nutritional state of 168 CD patients, admitted for surgery and the evaluation of the influence of this state on the postoperative course. MATERIAL AND METHODS: We referred the results of the nutritional state assessment to the time of the postoperative hospitalization of patients. RESULTS: Applying the Kruskal-Wallis test we found statistically significant, but weakly expressed, differences between the values of nutritional state parameters and period of hospitalization of patients. The applied U Mann-Whitney test, with statistically significant results with p <0.05, showed that no one parameter of the nutritional state of patients expressed a statistically significant difference between dead and recovered groups. CONCLUSIONS: We propose the body mass loss in the 6 months period before admission, TLC and serum albumin level as parameters which well detect undernutrition in CD patients presenting for surgery.},

   abstract = {INTRODUCTION: Antibodies reacting with various microbial epitopes have been described in inflammatory bowel disease (IBD) and are associated with a specific diagnosis and clinical presentation. AIM: To evaluate the profile of new anti-glycan antibodies, their potential association with disease phenotype and diagnostic accuracy in paediatric Crohn's disease (CD). MATERIAL AND METHODS: Blood samples from 134 paediatric IBD patients (109 CD, 25 ulcerative colitis (UC)) and 67 controls were blindly analysed for anti-Saccharomyces cerevisiae (ASCA), anti-chitobioside carbohydrate (ACCA), anti-laminaribioside carbohydrate (ALCA), and anti-mannobioside carbohydrate (AMCA) antibodies using commercially available assays. The serological response to glycans was correlated with clinical disease characteristics. RESULTS: At least one of the tested anti-glycan antibodies was present in 75% of CD patients. Despite the high frequency of reactivity to glycan epitopes, a limited overlap of serological markers was observed. In total, 49% of ASCA-negative patients presented with one of the following: ACCA, ALCA, or AMCA. The occurrence of one antibody from the anti-glycan panel was independently associated with complicated disease phenotype and ileocolonic disease location. A higher level of immune response as assessed by the quartile sum scores for ACCA, ALCA, and AMCA was linked with older age at diagnosis (10-17 years) and ileocolonic disease location. The ASCA had the greatest accuracy for diagnosis and differentiation of CD. CONCLUSIONS: Qualitative and quantitative serologicalal response to glycan epitopes was associated with distinct clinical presentation in paediatric CD patients. This raises the possibility for the use of these markers to differentiate subgroups of CD patients with more sever clinical presentation. The ASCA was the most accurate serological marker for CD; however, testing for the new anti-glycan antibodies may constitute an adjunctive tool in a specific group of patients to aid in the differentiation of CD with absent ASCA from ulcerative colitis.},

   abstract = {BACKGROUND: Environmental enteropathy (EE) is subclinical, diffuse villous atrophy characterized by T cell infiltration of the small intestinal mucosa associated with nutrient malabsorption and stunting. EE is assessed by the lactulose:mannitol (L:M) test, whereby nonmetabolized sugars are ingested and quantified in the urine. Multiple micronutrient (MN) deficiency morphologically mimics EE, and omega-3 (n-3) polyunsaturated fatty acids reduce mucosal inflammation in Crohn disease. OBJECTIVE: We tested the hypothesis that supplementary MNs, with or without fish oil (FO), would improve L:M in rural Malawian children aged 1-3 y compared with a control (C) group receiving a placebo. METHODS: The MNs and FO provided the Recommended Dietary Intake for 26 vitamins, minerals, eicosapentaenoic acid, and docosahexaenoic acid. This was a 3-arm, randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled clinical trial, with the primary outcomes being the change in L:M (DeltaL:M) after 12 and 24 wk of supplementation. Comparisons were made for DeltaL:M after 12 and 24 wk within each group by using a Wilcoxon matched pairs signed rank test, because the data are not normally distributed. RESULTS: A total of 230 children had specimens adequate for analysis; all had an abnormal baseline L:M, defined as >0.10. After 12 wk, children who received MNs + FO had a DeltaL:M [mean (95% CI)] of -0.10 (-0.04, -0.15; P = 0.001), and children receiving only MNs had DeltaL:M of -0.12 (-0.03, -0.21; P = 0.002). After 24 wk, children who received MNs + FO had a DeltaL:M of -0.09 (-0.03, -0.15; P = 0.001); children receiving only MNs had a DeltaL:M of -0.11 (-0.02, -0.20; P = 0.001), and the C group had DeltaL:M of -0.07 (0.02, -0.16); P = 0.002). Linear growth was similar in all groups, approximately 4.3 cm over 24 wk. CONCLUSION: Although the effect was modest, these data suggest MNs can transiently ameliorate EE in rural African children. The trial was registered at clinicaltrials.gov as NCT01593033.},

   abstract = {The role of radiologic evaluation in Crohn's disease (CD) has undergone a recent paradigm shift in which the radiologist adds value to the multidisciplinary team by longitudinally assessing therapeutic response and identifying treatment-modifying subtypes, such as fibrostenotic or fistulizing disease. Magnetic resonance enterography (MRE) has become the primary imaging modality used. The combination of multiplanar, multiparametric, and multiphasic contrast-enhanced imaging with the high spatial resolution and very high tissue contrast of MR imaging allows for detailed evaluation of intra-abdominal pathology, without the risk of cumulative radiation exposure. MRE provides the benefit of a complete evaluation of mural, extramural, and even extraintestinal manifestations and complications of CD in a single examination. Cine motility sequences and diffusion-weighted imaging may further increase sensitivity and specificity. MRE represents an ideal imaging modality for initial evaluation, assessment of therapeutic response, and evaluation of complications in patients with CD.},

   abstract = {BACKGROUND: Although autologous stem cell transplantation (ASCT) may achieve disease control in severe treatment-resistant Crohn's disease (CD), relapse is frequent, and there is little information regarding long-term outcomes in terms of response to subsequent treatments and complications of ASCT. DESIGN: Retrospective evaluation of UK patients treated on a compassionate basis from three UK tertiary centres. METHODS: We summarize long-term outcomes of six previously unreported patients with severe treatment-resistant CD treated with ASCT according to international guidelines between 2003 and 2009. Median duration of CD before ASCT was 14 (7-22) years. Following stem cell mobilization, patients were treated with high-dose cyclophosphamide (200 mg/kg) and rabbit anti-thymocyte globulin (7.5 mg/kg) followed by ASCT. RESULTS: All patients tolerated ASCT with routine toxicities and no treatment-related mortality and are alive at 50-123 months post-ASCT. Clinical and endoscopic remissions of CD were confirmed at 3 months post-ASCT in five patients, although median time to next treatment for inflammatory disease was 10 months (range: 3-16 months). Subsequently, disease control was achieved with previously ineffective and newer treatments, with surgery performed predominantly for pre-existing fibrotic strictures. Two patients became independent of home total parenteral nutrition (TPN). Reported late complications of ASCT included hypothyroidism and ovarian failure. CONCLUSION: Long-term follow-up supports the safety and feasibility of ASCT as a means of achieving short-term control of severe CD whilst potentially re-sensitizing the disease to medical therapy and reducing requirements for surgery and TPN. Given the inevitability of relapse, pre-emptive salvage and/or maintenance treatments post-ASCT should be the focus of future trials.},

   abstract = {PURPOSE OF REVIEW: Therapy for inflammatory bowel diseases (IBD) has changed dramatically in recent years with a wider use of immunomodulators and the introduction of antitumor necrosis factor (anti-TNF) agents. This article reviews the existing data on the long-term efficacy of biologics, that is, anti-TNF agents, for preventing complications and surgery in patients with IBD. RECENT FINDINGS: Anti-TNF agents are effective for preventing endoscopic and surgical recurrence after surgery for Crohn's disease. They are able to achieve fistula closure and do not increase the risk of stricture. Most randomized short-term trials also showed decreased requirement for hospitalizations and surgery in patients receiving anti-TNF. However, observational studies from referral centers or based on population have shown conflicting results. The need for surgery in Crohn's disease and the risk of colectomy in ulcerative colitis seem to be decreasing in recent years, but the specific effect of the introduction of anti-TNF agents cannot be currently evaluated. SUMMARY: Although anti-TNF agents are the most powerful drugs in IBD, their ability to decrease the need for surgery remains unclear. Conflicting results observed in observational surveys might be because of anti-TNF agents administered too late in the course of IBD.},

MATERIALS AND METHODS: A total of 38 (28 Male; 10 Female) hospitalized patients with moderate or severe IBD (13 with Crohn's disease (CD); 25 with Ulcerative colitis (UC)) were included. At stage 1, the disease severity, clinical symptoms and, signs, food consumption and nutritional status by using subjective global assessment (SGA) were recorded. At stage 2, the patients were blindly randomized into a Study Group and Controls. In the Study Group, a standard enteral product was added into the regulated hospital diets, but for the Controls, deficits were regulated by only hospital diets for 3 weeks. the independent variables were the group, the disease and its activity, age, Body body mass index (BMI), weight loss history, the hospitalization period; the dependent variables were SGA, bowel movements, change in nutritional status, disease severity, clinical findings, and also consumption of macronutrients. RESULTS: Prevalance of malnutrition (SGA-B or SGA-C) for all the patients was 92.1% at the beginning and 71.1% at the end of study. Improvements in disease activity score for the patients with UC were statistically significant in both the Study Group and the Controls (p=0.006 for the Study Group and p=0.001 for the Controls, respectively). Macronutrients, total and water soluble fiber consumption levels improved, with statistically significant differences for all the groups. CONCLUSION: The prevalence of malnutrition is a major problem in patients with IBD. Not only the regulation of hospital food, but also enteral nutritional support, improved their levels of malnutrition, as well as their energy, macronutrients, and fiber consumption, and SGA is an easy method for nutritional monitoring.},

Thus, we aimed to investigate the prevalence of various nutritional and growth parameters at the time of diagnosis in Korean children with CD. METHODS: Seventy-one children (<18 years) were enrolled. We analyzed the Z-scores of height-for-age (HAZ), weight-for-height (WHZ), body mass index for age (BMIZ), bone mineral density for age (BMDZ), and the biochemical markers measured at the time of diagnosis. RESULTS: At diagnosis, HAZ <-2 was observed in three patients (4%), WHZ <-2 in 20 patients (28%), BMIZ <-2 in 19 patients (27%), and BMDZ <-2 in 11 patients (18%). The HAZ was significantly lower in females and patients with extraintestinal manifestations, and the WHZ and BMIZ were significantly lower in patients with stricturing and penetrating disease. Subnormal serum levels were highly prevalent for hemoglobin, albumin, iron, ferritin, calcium, magnesium, folate, vitamin B12, and zinc. There was a significant correlation between nutritional status, growth retardation, and disease activity. CONCLUSIONS: Abnormal nutritional status was highly prevalent in Korean children with CD at the time of diagnosis and was associated with the extent, behavior, and activity of the disease.},

   abstract = {BACKGROUND: Crohn's disease (CD) is a chronic inflammatory disease with increasing incidence in children. Current medications have potentially serious side effects, hence increasing interest in alternative therapies. We previously developed an herbal formula, FAHF-2, based on a classical traditional Chinese herbal formula Wu Mei Wan that has long been used in China to treat colitis. We investigated FAHF-2's potential anti-inflammatory effects. METHODS: FAHF-2 efficacy was tested in vivo in the CD45RbRAG1 transfer colitis model. Weight loss, colonic histology, and cytokine production from mesenteric lymph nodes were assessed. Human peripheral blood mononuclear cells (PBMCs) and colonic biopsies were obtained from children newly diagnosed with CD and controls and cultured with or without FAHF-2. Cytokine levels were measured by multiplex immunoassay. The effect of FAHF-2 on TNF-alpha-producing cells was determined by flow cytometry. NF-kappaB signaling was investigated in human lamina propria mononuclear cells upon FAHF-2 treatment by In-Cell Western. RESULTS: FAHF-2-treated mice had decreased weight loss, improved histology, and reduced TNF-alpha, IL-17, IL-6, and IFN-gamma production. In vitro treated PBMCs produced less TNF-alpha, IFN-gamma, and IL-12. FAHF-2 reduced the TNF-alpha-producing monocytes and T cells. Inflamed CD biopsies produced less TNF-alpha, IL-17, IL-6, and IL-1beta. These effects are because of decreased NF-kappaB activation. CONCLUSIONS: FAHF-2 inhibited both adaptive and innate immune proinflammatory cytokine responses in PBMCs and inflamed CD mucosa due in part to blockage of NF-kappaB activation. FAHF-2 was effective in halting progression of colitis in a murine model. This study shows that FAHF-2 has potential as a novel treatment of CD.},

   abstract = {BACKGROUND: The efficacy of exclusive enteral nutrition (EEN) in induction of remission in pediatric Crohn's disease (CD) is reported to be equivalent to that of corticosteroids (CS). AIMS: Our objective was to compare the efficacy of EEN and CS in inducing remission in pediatric onset CD and the effects of the treatment on nutritional status and bone mineral density (BMD). METHODS: Medical charts were retrospectively studied for patients diagnosed with CD between 2000 and 2010 at the Stollery children's hospital in Edmonton, Alberta. Anthropometric and dual-energy X-ray absorptiometry (DXA) data were collected to assess effects of therapy; clinical remission, relapse, and severity were defined on the basis of the pediatric Crohn's disease activity index. RESULTS: To induce remission at first presentation, 36 patients (mean age 12.9 years) received EEN and 69 (mean age 11.2 years) received CS. Remission (88.9% in the EEN group versus 91.3% in the CS group (p=0.73) at 3 months) and relapse (40.6 vs. 28.6%, respectively (p=0.12) over 12 months) were similar in both treatment groups. Thirty-four patients had paired DXA scans at the time of diagnosis and one year later: 16 given EEN and 18 given CS. Change in BMD spine z-scores based on bone age adjusted for height and chronological age was greater for EEN patients but not statistically significant (Deltaz-score 0.30 vs. 0.03, p=0.28). CONCLUSIONS: EEN has similar efficacy to corticosteroids; however, EEN may lead to better BMD accrual. EEN should be preferred to corticosteroids as first-line therapy for induction of remission in pediatric CD.},

   abstract = {Loss-of-function variants within the gene locus encoding protein tyrosine phosphatase non-receptor type 2 (PTPN2) are associated with increased risk for Crohn's disease (CD). A disturbed regulation of T helper (Th) cell responses causing loss of tolerance against self- or commensal-derived antigens and an altered intestinal microbiota plays a pivotal role in CD pathogenesis. Loss of PTPN2 in the T-cell compartment causes enhanced induction of Th1 and Th17 cells, but impaired induction of regulatory T cells (Tregs) in several mouse colitis models, namely acute and chronic dextran sodium sulfate colitis, and T-cell transfer colitis models. This results in increased susceptibility to intestinal inflammation and intestinal dysbiosis which is comparable with that observed in CD patients. We detected inflammatory infiltrates in liver, kidney, and skin and elevated autoantibody levels indicating systemic loss of tolerance in PTPN2-deficient animals. CD patients featuring a loss-of-function PTPN2 variant exhibit enhanced Th1 and Th17 cell, but reduced Treg markers when compared with PTPN2 wild-type patients in serum and intestinal tissue samples. Our data demonstrate that dysfunction of PTPN2 results in aberrant T-cell differentiation and intestinal dysbiosis similar to those observed in human CD. Our findings indicate a novel and crucial role for PTPN2 in chronic intestinal inflammation.},

   abstract = {PURPOSE: Percutaneous endoscopic gastrostomy (PEG) or percutaneous endoscopic jejunostomy (PEJ) are substantial for patients with swallowing disorders to maintain enteral nutrition or to decompress palliatively intractable small bowel obstruction. Endoscopic placement can be impossible due to previous (gastric) operation, obesity, hepato-splenomegaly, peritoneal carcinosis, inadequate transillumination, or obstructed passage. Computed tomography (CT)-fluoroscopic guidance with or without endoscopy can enable placement of CT-PG/CT-PJ or CT-PEG/CT-PEJ if endoscopically guided placement fails. In this retrospective study, we will evaluate the feasibility and safety of this method. METHODS: A total of 101 consecutive patients were referred to our department for feeding support (n = 87) or decompression (n = 14). Reasons were: ENT tumor (n = 51), esophageal cancer (n = 19), mediastinal mass (n = 2), neurological disorder (n = 15). Decompression tubes were placed because of cancer (n = 13) or Crohn's disease (n = 1). The following approaches were chosen: CT fluoroscopy and simultaneous gastroscopy (n = 61), inflation of the stomach via nasogastric tube (n = 29), and direct puncture under CT-fluoroscopic guidance (n = 11). RESULTS: CT fluoroscopy-guided gastrostomy was feasible in 89 of 101 patients. No procedure-related mortality was observed. One tube was misplaced into the colon in a patient with a history of gastrectomy. No complication was seen after removal. Minor complications: dislodgement (n = 17), peristomal leakage (n = 7), wound infection (n = 1), superficial skin infection (n = 6), tube obstruction (n = 2). CONCLUSIONS: CT fluoroscopy-guided PG/PJ or PEG/PEJ is feasible and safe and provides adequate feeding support or decompression. It offers the benefits of minimally invasive therapy even in patients with contraindications to established endoscopic methods, combining the advantages of both techniques. Long-term complications-mainly tube-related problems-are easily treated.},

   abstract = {BACKGROUND: The role of diet in inflammatory bowel disease (IBD) is supported by migration studies and increasing incidences in line with Westernisation. AIM: To give a complete overview of studies associating habitual diet with the onset or relapses in ulcerative colitis (UC) or Crohn's disease (CD). METHODS: A structured search in Pubmed, the Cochrane Library and EMBASE was performed using defined key words, including only full text papers in English language. RESULTS: Forty-one studies were identified, investigating onset (n = 35), relapses (n = 5) or both (n = 1). Several studies reported high intake of sugar or sugar-containing foods (n = 7 UC, n = 12 CD), and low intake of fruits and/or vegetables (n = 5 UC, n = 10 CD) to be associated with an increased onset risk. However, these findings could not be confirmed by similar or higher numbers of other studies. A possible protective role was found for grain-derived products in CD onset, but results were inconsistent for dietary fibre in UC and CD and grain-derived products in UC. No definite conclusions could be drawn for unsaturated fatty acids (UFA), protein and energy intake due to limited and/or inconsistent results. Six studies reported on diet and relapse risk, of which only two (n = 1 UC, n = 1 CD) had a prospective follow-up. CONCLUSIONS: The current evidence is not sufficient to draw firm conclusions on the role of specific food components or nutrients in the aetiology of IBD. Furthermore, large prospective studies into the role of habitual diet as a trigger of relapses are needed, to identify new therapeutic or preventive targets.},

   abstract = {BACKGROUND: Certolizumab pegol (CERT) is indicated for reducing the signs and symptoms of Crohn's disease (CD) and maintaining clinical response. Patients losing response received an extra "capture" re-induction dose in the PRECiSE 4 study. We examined the use of certolizumab in a retrospective cohort of patients with CD at a single inflammatory bowel disease center. METHODS: We conducted a retrospective chart review of all adult patients with CD treated with CERT at the University of Chicago from April 22, 2008 to May 1, 2011. Demographics, disease characteristics, inflammatory bowel disease therapies, surgeries, CERT dosing, and clinical outcomes were recorded. Predictors of clinical response, re-induction dosing, and maintenance dose escalation were evaluated. Univariate, multivariate, and Kaplan-Meier analyses were performed for predictive variables of clinical response, re-induction dosing, and maintenance dose increases. RESULTS: One hundred ten patients were identified; 23 were excluded. The remaining 87 patients had a sustained clinical response of 31.0%, remission of 14.9%, minimal or no response of 31.0%; 37.9% initially responded but lost response. In total, 35.6% of patients received a single re-induction dose of 400 mg after a mean of 29 weeks, predicted by prior anti-tumor necrosis factor (P = 0.007) and absence of perianal disease (P = 0.006); only 5 patients (16.1%) maintained a durable response or remission; 11.5% increased maintenance dosage after a mean of 50 weeks; all but 1 subsequently stopped CERT. CONCLUSIONS: Some patients with CD (31%) achieved a sustained response. The majority of patients receiving re-induction dosing did not achieve a sustained clinical response. Previous treatment with anti-tumor necrosis factor therapy was associated with reduced responses, suggesting that CERT may be more effective as an initial anti-tumor necrosis factor therapy.},

   abstract = {Coeliac disease (CD) is one of the most common diseases worldwide, resulting from a combination of environmental (gluten) and genetic (human leucocyte antigen (HLA) and non-HLA genes) factors. Depending on the geographical location, the prevalence of CD has been estimated to approximate 0.5-1%. The only treatment currently available for CD is a gluten-free diet (GFD) excluding gluten-containing cereals such as wheat, rye, and barley, and other foodstuffs with natural or added gluten. However, adherence rates and patient acceptance are often poor. Moreover, even in fully adherent patients, the diet may fail to induce clinical or histological improvement. Hence, it is unsurprising that studies show CD patients to be highly interested in non-dietary alternatives. The following review focuses on current pathophysiological concepts of CD, spotlighting those pathways which may serve as new possible, non-dietary therapeutic targets in the treatment of CD.},

We therefore investigated fecal levels of CgA, CgB, SgII and SgIII, and their association with inflammatory activity, disease duration and medical therapy in UC. METHODS: Analyses of CgA, CgB, SgII, SgIII and calprotectin in stool samples from 41 UC patients and 29 healthy controls were performed. Two stool samples, during relapse and remission, respectively, were obtained from each UC patient. RESULTS: The levels of fecal CgA and SgII were higher in UC patients with active disease as compared to healthy controls. CgB and SgII were positively correlated with disease duration, but none of the granins were positively correlated with calprotectin, Mayo score, CRP or serum concentrations of TNF in UC patients with active disease. Also UC patients in remission had higher levels of CgA, CgB, SgII, and SgIII as compared to healthy controls. However, levels of fecal CgA, CgB, SgII and SgIII were lower during active disease relative to remission. Moreover, fecal levels of CgA and SgII were higher in UC patients in remission treated with thiopurines than in thiopurine-naive patients in remission. CONCLUSION: Fecal chromogranins and secretogranins are increased in UC but are not associated with disease activity, but seem to increase with duration of the disease. Thus, fecal granins might reflect structural changes associated with chronicity of disease, or medical therapy.},

   abstract = {Mechanisms responsible for derangements in Fe homeostasis in chronic inflammatory conditions are not entirely clear. The aim of the present study was to test the hypothesis that inflammation affects the expression of Fe-related proteins in the duodenum and monocytes of patients with chronic inflammatory disorders, thus contributing to dysregulated Fe homeostasis. Duodenal mucosal samples and peripheral blood monocytes obtained from patients with chronic inflammatory disorders, namely ulcerative colitis (UC), Crohn's disease (CD) and rheumatoid arthritis, were used for gene and protein expression studies. Hb levels were significantly lower and serum C-reactive protein levels were significantly higher in patients in the disease groups. The gene expression of several Fe-related proteins in the duodenum was significantly up-regulated in patients with UC and CD. In patients with UC, the protein expression of divalent metal transporter 1 and ferroportin, which are involved in the absorption of dietary non-haem Fe, was also found to be significantly higher in the duodenal mucosa. The gene expression of the duodenal proteins of interest correlated positively with one another and negatively with Hb. In patients with UC, the gene expression of Fe-related proteins in monocytes was found to be unaffected. In a separate group of patients with UC, serum hepcidin levels were found to be significantly lower than those in the control group. In conclusion, the expression of Fe-related proteins was up-regulated in the duodenum of patients with chronic inflammatory conditions in the present study. The effects appeared to be secondary to anaemia and the consequent erythropoietic drive.},

This study was undertaken to assess safety and efficacy of MTX in children with CD. METHODS: Patients treated with MTX with a minimum of 1-year follow-up were identified in the Pediatric IBD Collaborative Research Group Registry, a prospective inception cohort study started in 2002. The clinical efficacy and safety of MTX were analyzed retrospectively. RESULTS: Two hundred ninety patients treated with MTX were identified. One hundred seventy-two patients received at least 3 months of MTX without thiopurine or biologicals and had >/=1 year of follow-up. Eighty-one of 172 patients (47%) received MTX as first immunomodulator (IMM), of which 22 (27%) achieved >/=12 months of sustained clinical remission without surgery, thiopurine, biologicals, or corticosteroids. Those receiving MTX as second IMM achieved similar remission rate (35%, P = not significant). Fourteen percent received MTX as first IMM in 2002 and 60% in 2010 (P = 0.005). Disease location did not affect outcomes. MTX doses were equivalent in both groups. Fifteen percent of patients developed an alanine aminotransferase >60 international units/liter and 12% developed a white blood cell <4000 cells per microliter while on MTX. Only 4% of these discontinued MTX completely. A small group of 6 centers, which contributed only about one-third of patients with CD in the registry, contributed nearly two-thirds of the patients receiving MTX (P < 0.001). CONCLUSIONS: MTX use as first choice IMM is increasing in pediatric CD. MTX provided sustained clinical remission in nearly one-third of patients with minimal toxicity. There is large center-to-center variability in its use.},

   abstract = {BACKGROUND: Inflammatory bowel disease (IBD) is characterized by chronic intestinal inflammation in the absence of a recognized etiology. The primary therapies are medications that possess anti-inflammatory or immunosuppressive effects. Given the high use of complementary alternative medicines in pediatric IBD, a prospective tolerability study of curcumin, an herbal therapy with known anti-inflammatory effects, was conducted to assess possible dosage in children with IBD. METHODS: Prospectively, patients with Crohn disease or ulcerative colitis in remission or with mild disease (Pediatric Crohn's Disease Activity Index [PCDAI] <30 or Pediatric Ulcerative Colitis Activity Index [PUCAI] score <34) were enrolled in a tolerability study. All patients received curcumin in addition to their standard therapy. Patients initially received 500 mg twice per day for 3 weeks. Using the forced-dose titration design, doses were increased up to 1 g twice per day at week 3 for a total of 3 weeks and then titrated again to 2 g twice per day at week 6 for 3 weeks. Validated measures of disease activity, using the PUCAI and PCDAI, and the Monitoring of Side Effect System score were obtained at weeks 3, 6, and 9. RESULTS: All patients tolerated curcumin well, with the only symptom that was consistently reported during all 3 visits being an increase in gassiness, which occurred in only 2 patients. Three patients saw improvement in PUCAI/PCDAI score. CONCLUSIONS: This pilot study suggests that curcumin may be used as an adjunctive therapy for individuals seeking a combination of conventional medicine and alternative medicine.},

METHODS: Many of these therapies have not been evaluated scientifically; therefore, we reviewed the medical records of our patients with Crohn disease on the specific carbohydrate diet (SCD). RESULTS: Seven children with Crohn disease receiving the SCD and no immunosuppressive medications were retrospectively evaluated. Duration of the dietary therapy ranged from 5 to 30 months, with an average of 14.6+/-10.8 months. Although the exact time of symptom resolution could not be determined through chart review, all symptoms were notably resolved at a routine clinic visit 3 months after initiating the diet. Each patient's laboratory indices, including serum albumin, C-reactive protein, hematocrit, and stool calprotectin, either normalized or significantly, improved during follow-up clinic visits. CONCLUSIONS: This chart review suggests that the SCD and other low complex carbohydrate diets may be possible therapeutic options for pediatric Crohn disease. Further prospective studies are required to fully assess the safety and efficacy of the SCD, or any other low complex SCDs in pediatric patients with Crohn disease.},

The aim of the present study was to evaluate the preventative effect of oral GLN supplementation against acetic acid (AA) induced intestinal injury in a rat. Male Sprague-Dawley rats were divided into four experimental groups: control (CONTR) rats underwent laparotomy, control-glutamine (CONTR-GLN) rats were treated with enteral glutamine given in drinking water (2%) 48 hours before and five days following laparotomy, AA rats underwent laparotomy and injection of AA into an isolated jejunal loop, and acetic acid-glutamine (AA-GLN) rats underwent AA-induced injury and were treated with enteral GLN 48 hours before and 5 days following laparotomy. Intestinal mucosal damage (Park's injury score), mucosal structural changes, enterocyte proliferation and enterocyte apoptosis were determined five days following intestinal injury. Western blotting was used to determine p-ERK and bax protein levels. AA-induced intestinal injury resulted in a significantly increased intestinal injury score with concomitant inhibition of cell turnover (reduced proliferation and enhanced apoptosis). Treatment with dietary GLN supplementation resulted in a decreased intestinal injury score with concomitant stimulation of cell turnover (enhanced proliferation and reduced apoptosis). In conclusion, pre-treatment with oral GLN prevents mucosal injury and improves intestinal recovery following AA-induced intestinal injury in rats.},

   abstract = {OBJECTIVES: Anti-tumor necrosis factor (anti-TNF) therapy effects on postoperative complications in Crohn's disease (CD) patients are unclear. We examined a retrospective cohort to clarify this relationship. METHODS: CD patients followed at a referral center between July 2004 and May 2011 who underwent abdominal surgery were identified. Postoperative complications (major infection, intra-abdominal abscess, peritonitis, anastomotic leak, wound infection, dehiscence, fistula, thrombotic, and death) were compared in patients exposed and unexposed to anti-TNF </=8 weeks preoperatively. Demographics, surgical history, comorbidities, corticosteroid (CS) and immunomodulator use, Montreal classification, operative details, and preoperative nutritional status were assessed. Multivariate analysis measured the independent effect of preoperative anti-TNF on postoperative complications. RESULTS: Overall, 325 abdominal surgeries were performed; 150 (46%) with anti-TNF </=8 weeks before surgery. The anti-TNF group developed overall infectious (36% vs. 25%, P=0.05) and a trend toward surgical site complications (36% vs. 25%, P=0.10) more frequently. Major postoperative and intra-abdominal septic complications did not differ between groups. Multivariable analysis showed that preoperative anti-TNF was an independent predictor of overall infectious (odds ratio (OR) 2.43; 95% confidence interval (CI) 1.18-5.03) and surgical site (OR 1.96; 95% CI 1.02-3.77) complications. CONCLUSIONS: In a tertiary referral center, use of anti-TNF therapy in CD patients </=8 weeks before intestinal resection or any intra-abdominal surgery was independently associated with increases in infectious and surgical complications.},

   abstract = {OBJECTIVE: The aim of the study was to compare the colonic mucosal immune response in children with new, untreated Crohn disease (CD-New), CD in remission (CD-Remission), and unaffected children (CTRL [controls]). METHODS: We performed flow cytometry of mitogen-stimulated colonic lamina propria mononuclear cells isolated from colonic biopsies and 72-hour biopsy explant cultures, and analyzed the supernatant by an unbiased multiplex cytokine array of 45 analytes. RESULTS: Thirty-six children were studied (mean age 14 +/- 3 years, 14 girls): 12 CD-New, 11 CD-Remission, and 13 CTRL. We found that stimulation of lamina propria mononuclear cells isolated from colonic biopsies induced comparable intracellular cytokine levels of interferon (IFN-gamma), interleukin (IL)-17, and tumor necrosis factor (TNF)-alpha in T cells from CD-New, CD-Remission, and CTRL, suggesting that mucosal innate inflammation plays a larger role than activated T cells in CD-New. To measure factors released during the ongoing inflammatory response in CD-New, we cultured colonic biopsy explants and uncovered 13/45 factors that were significantly higher in CD-New versus CD-Remission, whereas 10 were increased in CD-New over CTRL. Ingenuity Pathway Analysis software revealed the anticipated interconnectivity of TNF-alpha, IL-6, and CSF-2 in CD-New of the colon. A novel subnetwork of chemokines was, however, evident, whereas IL-17a appeared as a peripheral factor. Principal component analysis and hierarchal clustering showed that CD-New and CD-Remission separated into distinct subgroups based on the 13 factors. CONCLUSIONS: At diagnosis of inflammatory bowel disease, the colonic cytokine response contains a predominance of innate immune factors, with chemoattractants and vascular adhesion molecules playing a central role.},

   abstract = {OBJECTIVE: The association between inflammatory bowel disease (IBD) and depression provides a unique opportunity to understand the relation between systemic inflammation and depressive symptom profiles. METHODS: Youth (n = 226) ages 9 to 17 years with comorbid IBD and depression underwent psychiatric assessment and evaluation of IBD activity. Latent profile analysis (LPA) identified depressive subgroups based on similar responses to the Children's Depression Rating Scale-Revised. Demographic factors, depression severity, anxiety, IBD activity, inflammatory markers, IBD-related medications, and illness perception were evaluated as predictors of profile membership. RESULTS: Mean age was 14.3 years; 75% had Crohn disease; 31% were taking systemic corticosteroids. Mean depressive severity was moderate, whereas IBD activity, which reflects inflammation, was mild. LPA identified 3 subgroups: Profile-1 (mild, 75%) had diverse low-grade depressive symptoms and highest quality of life; Profile-2 (somatic, 19%) had severe fatigue, appetite change, anhedonia, decreased motor activity, and depressed mood with concurrent high-dose steroid therapy and the highest IBD activity; and Profile-3 (cognitive, 6%) had the highest rates of self-reported depressive symptoms, ostomy placements, and anxiety with IBD symptoms in the relative absence of inflammation. CONCLUSIONS: Evidence was found for 3 depression profiles in youth with IBD and depression. Our analyses determined that patients with predominantly somatic or cognitive symptoms of depression comprised 25% of our cohort. These findings may be used to design subgroup-specific interventions for depression in adolescents with IBD and other physical illnesses associated with systemic inflammation.},

   abstract = {BACKGROUND: Intestinotrophic therapies, such as glucagon-like peptide-2 (GLP-2) analogs, may enhance intestinal adaptation and reduce dependence on parenteral nutrition (PN) in patients with intestinal failure associated with short bowel syndrome (SBS-IF). However, because GLP-2 enhances cellular growth, there is concern that GLP-2 analogs may also encourage growth of malignant cells. AIMS: To histologically examine the effects of teduglutide, a recombinant human GLP-2 analog, on the mucosa of the small and large intestine for indications of dysplastic transformation. METHODS: In a multicenter, prospective, randomized, placebo-controlled study, 83 PN-dependent patients with SBS-IF were monitored for several weeks to ensure optimal and stable PN. Patients were then randomized to receive 24 weeks of placebo (n=16), teduglutide (0.5 mg/kg/d; n=35), or teduglutide (0.10 mg/kg/d; n=32). RESULTS: Biopsies were obtained from 77 patients to yield 390 individual histologic interpretations. After 6 months of treatment, no features of dysplasia were found in any biopsy from the large or small intestine of patients receiving placebo or either dose of teduglutide. New secondary diagnoses, such as eosinophilic colitis or Crohn's disease, were found at a low frequency overall: teduglutide (0.05 mg/kg/d; range, 3.1% to 6.3%); teduglutide (0.10 mg/kg/d, 3.3%); placebo (range, 6.7% to 13.3%). CONCLUSIONS: Although this histologic substudy of biopsy samples was not powered to detect differences in occurrence of dysplasia between teduglutide-treated patients and those randomized to placebo, it demonstrated that no dysplasia or other pathologic processes were evident within the intestinal mucosa in the placebo group or the 2 teduglutide groups after 6 months of treatment.},

   abstract = {PURPOSE OF REVIEW: To provide a synopsis on established and new research evaluating bone disease in patients with inflammatory bowel disease (IBD). RECENT FINDINGS: Persons with IBD, including Crohn's disease and ulcerative colitis are believed to be at high risk for osteoporosis and fracture. As osteoporosis is clinically silent and persons with IBD are not universally screened, the burden of bone disease in IBD has been difficult to accurately assess. It is also unclear whether bone disease is due to inflammatory activity, medication use, poor nutrient intake/absorption, or body habitus characteristics. Recent studies using population-wide databases of bone mineral density (BMD) analyses suggest that Crohn's disease is responsible for a small effect on BMD after adjusting for other risk factors for low BMD, whereas ulcerative colitis does not appear to confer an independent risk. Furthermore, IBD does not appear to be a risk for overall fracture once controlling for factors which are associated with both IBD and fracture risk. The ability to assess BMD on incidentally performed computed tomography scans may allow detection of low BMD in IBD patients. SUMMARY: Although reduced BMD and fracture are more common in persons with IBD, the precise burden is not well characterized. Also, the relative impact of IBD-associated factors and IBD-specific inflammation on bone health is still uncertain.},

   abstract = {BACKGROUND AND AIMS: Inflammatory bowel disease has been shown to affect children's health-related quality of life (HRQOL) through the use of lengthy questionnaires. We examined whether a pediatric patient's HRQOL, measured by a rapid visual analog scale ("feeling thermometer"), correlates with the perceptions of the HRQOL as determined by the patient's pediatric gastroenterologist and parent(s). Additionally, we attempted to determine whether the HRQOL correlates with the patient's disease activity as determined by validated activity indices. METHODS: A cross-sectional study of pediatric patients (ages 7-21 years) who were diagnosed as having Crohn disease, ulcerative colitis, or indeterminate colitis was conducted from January 2011 to May 2011. Each participant (patient, parent(s), and treating pediatric gastroenterologist) completed feeling thermometers to determine the symptom burden as well as therapeutic burden of the patient. The parent(s) and doctor were blinded to the patient's results. Pediatric Ulcerative Colitis Activity Index or a Short Pediatric Crohn Disease Activity Index (S-PCDAI) was calculated. Correlations between the participant's perceived burdens as well as their calculated disease activity were determined. RESULTS: Sixty-seven children and their families participated, resulting in 101 visits. Patients had a mean age of 15.0 years, and there were 38 boys. There was a strong significant correlation between the patient's perceived symptom burden and that of the parent's (rho 0.59, P < 0.001) and physician (rho 0.48, P < 0.001). Similarly, there was a strong significant correlation between patient's perceived treatment burden and that of the parent treatment burden (rho 0.49, P < 0.001) and, to a lesser degree, the physician (rho 0.29, P < 0.003). The correlation coefficient was strongest between the physician's perception of the patient's symptom burden against the standard disease activity indices Pediatric Ulcerative Colitis Activity Index (rho 0.69, P < 0.001) and Short Pediatric Crohn Disease Activity Index (rho 0.65, P < 0.001). CONCLUSIONS: The patient's HRQOL was highly correlated to both the physician's and parent's perceptions as well as their disease activity. The feeling thermometer is a quick, easy-to-use, visual analog scale that can be implemented in everyday practice to measure a pediatric patient's HRQOL.},

   abstract = {BACKGROUND & AIMS: Chronic abdominal pain is the most common indication for esophagogastroduodenoscopy (EGD) in children. However, little is known about the accuracy of EGD-based diagnosis or the outcomes of the patients who undergo this procedure. We examined the diagnostic yield of EGD and short-term outcomes of children who underwent this procedure for chronic abdominal pain. METHODS: We conducted a prospective study of 290 children (4-18 years old; mean age, 11.9 +/- 3.5 years; 93 girls) who underwent EGD for the primary indication of chronic abdominal pain (216 with at least 1 alarm feature) at a US pediatric gastroenterology referral center. We collected data on demographic features (age, sex), clinical characteristics (alarm features, Rome III criteria), and EGD results for each patient. All subjects with diagnostic lesions were followed for at least 1 year after EGD to determine short-term outcomes. RESULTS: Overall, EGD provided an accurate diagnosis for 109 children (38%). Diagnoses included esophagitis (21.0%), eosinophilic gastroenteritis (4.1%), eosinophilic esophagitis (3.8%), Helicobacter pylori infection (2.0%), celiac disease (0.6%), and Crohn's disease (0.4%). Short-term outcomes were available for 81% of patients with diagnostic findings, and medical therapy was effective in approximately 67% of these children. CONCLUSIONS: EGD is valuable for the diagnosis of children with abdominal pain, with a 38% diagnostic yield. EGD identified disorders for which medical therapy was effective in 67% of children during the year after diagnosis.},

   abstract = {The pathogenesis of inflammatory bowel disease (IBD), including Crohn's disease, is a subject of increasing interest. Loss-of-function mutations in nucleotide-binding oligomerization domain-containing protein 2 (NOD2) are strong genetic factors linked to Crohn's disease, which eventually leads to an excessive mucosal inflammatory response directed against components of normal gut microbiota. Reactive oxygen species (ROS) play an important role in inflammation processes, as well as in transduction of signals from receptors for several cytokines, such as tumor necrosis factor alpha (TNFalpha). ROS activate nuclear factor-kappaB (NF-kappaB) via IkappaB kinase (IKK) through the PI3K/AKT/PTEN pathway. Therefore, this pathway is recognized to play a key role in Crohn's disease. Loss of function has been demonstrated to occur as an early event in a wide variety of diseases. Given this prevalent involvement in a number of diseases, the molecular development that modulates this pathway has been the subject of several studies. In addition, it has been the focus of extensive research and drug discovery activities. A better understanding of the molecular assemblies may reveal novel targets for the therapeutic development against Crohn's disease.},

   abstract = {Primary duodenal localization of Crohn's disease (CD) is rare. Medical therapy can control symptoms, but surgery is required when progressive obstructive symptoms occur. Surgical options include bypass, resection, or strictureplasty, but it is still not clear which should be the treatment of choice. Reviewing the medical records of 1253 patients undergoing surgery for CD between January 1986 and December 2011 at the Digestive Surgery Unit of the Department of Clinical Physiopathology of the University of Florence, 10 patients (6 males and 4 females) underwent operations for duodenal CD. Four patients had only a duodenal localization, 6 patients had synchronous involvement of other intestinal tracts. Strictures were distributed in all the duodenal portions: in 7 patients there were single lesions, in 3 patients there were multiple lesions. Eight patients were treated with strictureplasty: 5 with the Heineke-Mikulicz technique, 2 with Jaboulay, and 1 with a pedunculated jejunal patch. Two patients were treated with resection: one with a B2 gastro-duodenal resection, and 1 with a duodenal-jejunal resection and an end to side duodeno-jejunal anastomosis. Follow up of the patients was from 2 to 18 years. No recurrence of duodenal CD was observed in the 2 patients treated with resection, while 2 of the 8 patients treated with strictureplasty had a recurrence. In our experience, strictureplasty is indicated when less than 2 strictures are present in the 2nd or 3rd duodenal portion. In cases with multiple strictures localized in the 1st or the distal duodenal portion, resection is preferable.},

   abstract = {OBJECTIVES: Allergic colitis shows overlap with classic inflammatory bowel disease (IBD). Clinically, allergic colitis is associated with dysmotility and abdominal pain, and mucosal eosinophilia is characteristic. We thus aimed to characterise mucosal changes in children with allergic colitis compared with normal tissue and classic IBD, focusing on potential interaction between eosinophils and mast cells with enteric neurones. METHODS: A total of 15 children with allergic colitis, 10 with Crohn disease (CD), 10 with ulcerative colitis (UC), and 10 histologically normal controls were studied. Mucosal biopsies were stained for CD3 T cells, Ki-67, eotaxin-1, and eotaxin-2. Eotaxin-2, IgE, and tryptase were localised compared with mucosal nerves, using neuronal markers neurofilament protein, neuron-specific enolase, and nerve growth factor receptor. RESULTS: Overall inflammation was greater in patients with CD and UC than in patients with allergic colitis. CD3 T-cell density was increased in patients with allergic colitis, similar to that in patients with CD but lower than in patients with UC, whereas eosinophil density was higher than in all other groups. Eotaxin-1 and -2 were localised to basolateral crypt epithelium in all specimens, with eotaxin-1+ lamina propria cells found in all of the colitis groups. Eotaxin-2+ intraepithelial lymphocyte (IEL) density was significantly higher in allergic colitis specimens than in all other groups. Mast cell degranulation was strikingly increased in patients with allergic colitis (12/15) compared with that in patients with UC (1/10) and CD (0/1). Tryptase and IgE colocalised on enteric neurons in patients with allergic colitis but rarely in patients with IBD. CONCLUSIONS: Eotaxin-2+ IELs may contribute to the periepithelial eosinophil accumulation characteristic of allergic colitis. The colocalisation of IgE and tryptase with mucosal enteric nerves is likely to promote the dysmotility and visceral hyperalgesia classically seen in allergic gastrointestinal inflammation.},

   abstract = {Total parenteral nutrition (TPN) represents a therapeutic modality that could save the life of a patient with inflammatory bowel disease (IBD) facing severe nutritional problems, by restoring the patient's impaired nutritional status. TPN does not compete with enteral nutrition (EN), the latter being the first choice for all patients having anatomically intact and functionally normal digestive tract. TPN allows bowel rest while supplying adequate calorific intake and essential nutrients, and removes antigenic mucosal stimuli. The value of TPN in malnourished patients with intestinal failure due to CD is beyond doubt. However, it is difficult to suggest TPN as a sole treatment for active CD. An increased rate of remission could not be expected by applying TPN. The utility of TPN is restricted to certain cases involving efforts to close enterocutaneous or other complicated fistulas in patients with fistulizing CD, the treatment of short bowel syndrome following extensive resections for CD, or when EN is impractical for other reasons. There are no advantages of TPN therapy over EN therapy regarding fistula healing. TPN has no influence on the surgical intervention rate and little benefit by bypassing the intestinal passage could be expected. Also TPN shows no advantage if the disease is chronically active. However, an optimal supply of nutrients improves bowel motility, intestinal permeability and nutritional status, and reduces inflammatory reactions. TPN might be associated with an increased risk of adverse events, although TPN undertaken by experienced teams does not cause more complications than does EN.},

   abstract = {BACKGROUND/OBJECTIVES: In the era of modern multidisciplinary clinical management, very little is known about the prevalence and presentation of malnutrition in children with gastrointestinal disorders (GastroD) particularly employing composite, global measures of nutritional status. SUBJECTS/METHODS: Anthropometry, body composition, dietary intake, eating habits and grip strength were assessed with bedside methods in 168 patients from outpatient gastroenterology clinics (n, median (IQR) years; Crohn's disease (CD): n=53, 14.2 (11.6:15.4); ulcerative colitis (UC): n=27, 12.2 (10.7:14.2); coeliac disease: n=31, 9.3 (7.5:13.6); other GastroD: n=57, 9.8 (7.2:13.8)) and compared with 62 contemporary healthy controls (n, median (IQR): 9.8 (6.9:13.8)) and the results of the recent UK, National Diet and Nutritional Survey (NDNS). RESULTS: Children with CD had lower BMI z-scores than controls (median (IQR): -0.3 (-0.9:0.4) vs 0.3 (-0.6:1.4); P=0.02) but only 2% were classified as thin (BMI z-score <-2 s.d.). The prevalence of obesity in children with UC was 19%, 6% in CD, 11% in children with other GastroD and 15% in controls. No difference was found in grip strength measurement between groups. Except for CD children, the proportion of patients with suboptimal micronutrient intake was similar to that of controls and the cohort of children from the latest NDNS. A higher proportion of children with CD had suboptimal intake for riboflavin, vitamin B6 and calcium and consumed significantly more meat products, juices (including carbonated drinks), spreads/jams and crisps and savoury snacks and significantly fewer portions of dairy, fish, fruits and vegetables compared with healthy controls. CONCLUSIONS: GastroD affect children's body composition, growth, strength, dietary intake and eating habits, particularly CD, but to a lesser extent than expected.},

   abstract = {BACKGROUND: Oral methotrexate (MTX) administration avoids weekly injections, reduces costs and may improve quality of life of patients with Crohn's disease (CD), especially children. Routes of administration have never been systematically compared in CD. We aimed to compare effectiveness and safety of orally (PO) versus subcutaneously (SC) administered MTX in paediatric CD. METHODS: 226 children with CD treated with oral or subcutaneous MTX were included in a multicentre, retrospective 1-year cohort study (62% boys, mean age 13.8+/-2.8 years, 88% previous thiopurines). 38 (17%) were initially commenced on oral, 98 (43%) started subcutaneous and switched to oral and 90 (40%) were treated with subcutaneous only. Matching and 'doubly robust' weighted regression models were based on the propensity score method, controlling for confounding-by-indication bias. 11/23 pretreatment variables were different between the groups, but the propensity score modelling successfully balanced the treatment groups. RESULTS: 76 children (34%) had sustained steroid-free remission with a difference that did not reach significance between the PO and the SC groups (weighted OR=1.72 (95% CI 0.5 to 5.9); p=0.52). There were no differences in need for treatment escalation (p=0.24), elevated liver enzymes (p=0.59) or nausea (p=0.85). Height velocity was lower in the PO group (p=0.006) and time to remission was delayed in the PO group (p=0.036; Fleming (0, 1) test). CONCLUSIONS: In this largest paediatric CD cohort to date, SC administered MTX was superior to PO, but only in some of the outcomes and with a modest effect size. Therefore, it may be reasonable to consider switching children in complete remission treated with subcutaneous MTX to the oral route with close monitoring of inflammatory markers and growth.},

   abstract = {BACKGROUND: The results of previous studies on the effectiveness of antibiotics in ulcerative colitis (UC) seem more effective when used orally. In this retrospective, multicenter study, we aimed to report our experience of using a combination of 3-4 antibiotics in children with moderate-severe refractory UC and IBD-unclassified including metronidazole, amoxicillin, doxycycline, and if during hospital admission, also vancomycin (MADoV). METHODS: All children treated during 2013 with the antibiotic cocktail for 2-3weeks in an attempt to alleviate inflammation in refractory colitis were included. Doxycycline was substituted with oral gentamycin or ciprofloxacin in children younger than 8years or when an allergy was known to one of the drugs. Children were assessed using the PUCAI and CRP weekly for 3weeks. RESULTS: All 15 included children had moderate to severe disease with refractory disease course to multiple immunosuppressants (mean age 13.6+/-5.1years, median disease duration 2 (IQR 0.8-3.2) years, 11 females (73%), and 13 (87%) extensive disease; 14 (93%) were corticosteroid-dependent or resistant, and 12 (80%) refractory to anti-TNF therapy). The cocktail was definitely effective in 7 of the 15 included children (47%) who entered complete clinical remission (PUCAI<10) without additional interventions. Questionable or partial short-term response was noted in another 3 (20%), totaling 67% of patients. CONCLUSION: The use of oral wide-spectrum antibiotic cocktail in pediatric UC seems promising in half of patients, refractory to other salvage therapy. A pediatric randomized controlled trial to assess this intervention is underway.},

   abstract = {BACKGROUND: Eosinophilic enterocolitis (EEC) is an emerging distinct inflammatory bowel disease of unknown etiology. There are no published data on the effect of infliximab (IFX) or adalimumab (ADA) for the treatment of refractory cases. METHODS: A report of all pediatric cases with EEC treated with anti-tumor necrosis factor, identified after an open international call. RESULTS: We describe here the first 8 children with refractory EEC who were treated with IFX (75% boys; mean age at diagnosis 8.6 +/- 4.03 [range 1.6-14 years]; mean age at IFX treatment 11.7 +/- 4.4 [range 4.2-16 years]). Allergic and infectious causes of EEC were excluded in all cases. Rapid and complete clinical remission was documented in 6 (75%) children following the induction infusions: 3 (38%) with endoscopic remission, 2 (25%) with endoscopic improvement, and 1 unknown. Four of the 6 responders had secondary loss of response and were switched to ADA, 3 of whom with sustained remission using high doses. Overall, the 6 responders were followed for a median of 7 years (range 4-12; interquartile range 6.4-8.8 years) without evidence of developing Crohn disease or ulcerative colitis. The only case with macroscopic findings on endoscopy was a primary nonresponder. CONCLUSIONS: IFX and ADA may be effective in cases of refractory idiopathic EEC; however, because this is an uncontrolled report, further prospective studies are warranted.},

   abstract = {BACKGROUND: Adalimumab (ADA) is the key treatment for ulcerative colitis (UC) unresponsive or intolerant to standard treatments. Our aim was to assess the efficacy and safety of ADA in treating ambulatory UC patients in primary gastroenterology centers. METHODS: Fifteen patients (6 male, median age 29.9 years, range 22.8-39.9 years) were enrolled. All were previously treated with infliximab (IFX). Clinical activity and endoscopic severity were scored according to the Crohn's disease activity index (CDAI) score and Mayo subscore for endoscopy, respectively. Patients were clinically assessed at weeks 4, 8, and thereafter at weeks 16, 24, 32, 40, 48, and 54. Colonoscopy was performed before starting treatment, at weeks 24 and 54. The co-primary endpoints were clinical remission at 24 and 54 weeks. The secondary endpoints included: 1) sustained clinical remission; 2) steroid-sparing effect; 3) mucosal healing; 4) need for colectomy. Induction dose of ADA was 160 mg at week 0, and then 80 mg at week 2, while ADA maintenance treatment was 40 mg every two weeks. RESULTS: Clinical remission was obtained in 11 (73.3%) and 15 (100%) patients at weeks 24 and 54 respectively. Ten patients (66.7%) were able to discontinue steroids and were under corticosteroid-free remission at week 54. No patients underwent to colectomy. Eight patients (53.33%) at week 24 and 9 patients (60%) at week 54 achieved complete mucosal healing (Mayo endoscopic score 0). Side effects were reported in 2 of 15 patients (13.3%); none of those patients stopped treatment. CONCLUSION: ADA seems to be effective and safe in UC outpatients affected by UC, and previously treated with IFX.},

Our aim was to compare the efficacy and safety of IFX and ADA in treating CD in clinical practice. METHODS: One hundred and twenty-six patients (61 M, 65 F, mean age 36.2 years, range 19-67 years), affected by CD, were treated with infliximab (IFX, 59 patients) or adalimumab (ADA, 66 patients). Clinical efficacy, mucosal healing (MH), histological healing (HH), and safety were assessed. MH was defined complicated if healing of ulcers occurred with deformation of bowel profile and/or complete colonoscopy was impossible because of scars. RESULTS: Patients were followed-up for 36 months. No difference was found between IFX and ADA in maintaining long-term clinical remission, MH and HH. Complicated MH was present in 17 (28.8%) patients in IFX group and in 7 (10.6%) patients in ADA group (p=0.012). In 9 (15.2%) patients in IFX group and 2 (3.0%) patients in ADA group colonoscopy was incomplete without cecal intubation or terminal ileum exploration (p=0.024). Side effects were similar in both groups. CONCLUSIONS: Both IFX and ADA seem to be effective and safe in long-term outpatient treatment of CD in clinical practice.},

   abstract = {Patients with a diverse spectrum of rare genetic disorders can present with inflammatory bowel disease (monogenic IBD). Patients with these disorders often develop symptoms during infancy or early childhood, along with endoscopic or histological features of Crohn's disease, ulcerative colitis, or IBD unclassified. Defects in interleukin-10 signaling have a Mendelian inheritance pattern with complete penetrance of intestinal inflammation. Several genetic defects that disturb intestinal epithelial barrier function or affect innate and adaptive immune function have incomplete penetrance of the IBD-like phenotype. Several of these monogenic conditions do not respond to conventional therapy and are associated with high morbidity and mortality. Due to the broad spectrum of these extremely rare diseases, a correct diagnosis is frequently a challenge and often delayed. In many cases, these diseases cannot be categorized based on standard histological and immunologic features of IBD. Genetic analysis is required to identify the cause of the disorder and offer the patient appropriate treatment options, which include medical therapy, surgery, or allogeneic hematopoietic stem cell transplantation. In addition, diagnosis based on genetic analysis can lead to genetic counseling for family members of patients. We describe key intestinal, extraintestinal, and laboratory features of 50 genetic variants associated with IBD-like intestinal inflammation. In addition, we provide approaches for identifying patients likely to have these disorders. We also discuss classic approaches to identify these variants in patients, starting with phenotypic and functional assessments that lead to analysis of candidate genes. As a complementary approach, we discuss parallel genetic screening using next-generation sequencing followed by functional confirmation of genetic defects.},

METHODS: A total of 47 patients with IBD (25 ulcerative colitis, 14 Crohn's disease, and 8 indeterminate colitis) ages 3 to 17 years were compared with 50 healthy age- and sex-matched controls. Screening for hepatitis A and B serology was carried out before vaccination. Susceptible cases received 20 mg of recombinant DNA vaccine for hepatitis B (0, 1, and 6 months)and 720 milliELISA units of inactivated hepatitis A virus vaccine (HAV) (0 and 6 months). Postvaccination serologic evaluation was performed 1 month after the last dose of primary vaccination, 1 month after the booster dose, and once every year during follow-up. RESULTS: A total of 23 patients and 35 controls received HAV and protective anti-HAV antibodies were developed in all of the patients and controls (P =1.00). Forty-seven patients and 50 controls received hepatitis B vaccine and 70.2% of the patients versus 90% of the controls achieved seroprotection(anti-HBs titers 10 mIU/mL) 1 month after primary vaccination (95% confidence interval 0.71-0.87, P = 0.02). The overall seroprotection rates were 96% in controls and 85.1% in patients after the whole hepatitis B vaccination series (95% confidence interval 0.83-0.95, P = 0.08). No significant reduction was observed in antibody response among patients and controls during the follow-up period. CONCLUSIONS: The rate of seroconversion to the hepatitis B vaccine was lower in pediatric patients with IBD than in healthy controls and hepatitis A vaccine was highly immunogenic among patients with IBD.},

METHODS: A retrospective investigation was conducted on a cohort of newly diagnosed children and adolescents with IBD ages 0 to 18 years between 2002 and 2010 and residing in NE Slovenia. The phenotypic characteristics were determined at presentation and during follow-up. The location of Crohn disease (CD) and ulcerative colitis (UC) was assessed according to the Paris classification at diagnosis, and later in patients who had a follow-up period >2 years. The type of therapy at diagnosis and during follow-up, and the need for surgery were determined. The study covered approximately one-third of the total pediatric population (0-18 years). RESULTS: In total, 107 cases of IBD were diagnosed during the study period. The mean annual incidence (per 100,000) was 7.6 (95% confidence interval [CI] 6.3-9.2) for all IBD, 4.6 (95% CI 3.6-5.9) for CD, and 2.8 (95% CI 1.9-3.8) for UC. The incidences of total IBD, CD, and UC increased from 5.7 (3.8-8.2), 3.9 (2.3-6.1), and 1.8 (0.8-3.5) in the period 2002-2004, respectively, to 8.9 (6.3-12.2), 5.0 (3.1-7.6), and 3.4 (1.9-5.6) in the period 2008-2010, respectively. During the follow-up, the proportion of complicated CD disease behavior (stricturing/penetrating) had doubled. A total of 18.5% of patients with CD underwent bowel surgery. CONCLUSIONS: The incidence of childhood IBD in the northeastern part of the country is high and comparable with that reported from the developed western countries of Europe, and is probably still increasing. This increase may be the result of changes in the lifestyle, especially in dietary habits during the last 20 years.},

   abstract = {Although the significance of focally enhanced gastritis (FEG) as a marker of Crohn disease (CD) in adults has been contested, several studies suggest that it may be more specific of CD in pediatric patients. This study describes the detailed histologic features of FEG in pediatric inflammatory bowel disease (IBD) and clarifies its association with CD. A series of 119 consecutive newly diagnosed IBD patients (62 CD cases, 57 ulcerative colitis [UC] cases) with upper and lower gastrointestinal biopsies were evaluated. The histology of the gastric biopsies was reviewed blinded to final diagnoses and compared with age-matched healthy controls (n=66). FEG was present in 43% of IBD patients (CD 55% vs. UC 30%, P=0.0092) and in 5% of controls. Among CD patients, FEG was more common in younger patients (73% in children aged 10 y and below, 43% in children above 10 y of age, P=0.0358), with the peak in the 5- to 10-year age group (80%). The total number of glands involved in each FEG focus was higher in UC (6.4+/-5.1 glands) than in CD (4.0+/-3.0 glands, P=0.0409). Amongst the CD cohort, patients with FEG were more likely than those without FEG to have active ileitis (79% vs. 40%, P=0.0128) and granulomas elsewhere in the gastrointestinal tract (82% vs. 43%, P=0.0016). There was no correlation between FEG and other gastrointestinal findings of UC. We demonstrate that differences in FEG seen in pediatric CD and UC relate to not only their frequencies but also the morphology and relationship with other gastrointestinal lesions. Further, FEG is associated with disease activity and the presence of granulomas in pediatric CD.},

   abstract = {BACKGROUND AND AIMS: Cryptosporidiosis is usually a self-limiting illness in healthy patients. However, it can cause severe life threatening complications in immunocompromised patients. The effect of cryptosporidial infection on inflammatory bowel disease (IBD) has not been well studied and available literature is largely restricted to adult case reports. The purpose of this study is to describe the clinical characteristics of cryptosporidial infection in children with IBD. METHODS: Stool studies from children with IBD presenting with presumed relapse during the period 2005-2011 were reviewed retrospectively. Cryptosporidial infection was diagnosed by stool enzyme immunoassay. An age matched control group of IBD patients without cryptosporidial infection was used for comparison. RESULTS: Medical records of 170 IBD patients were reviewed and a total of 149 presumed relapses were identified. Cryptosporidial infection was found in seven of the 39 patients with positive stool studies (four ulcerative colitis/three Crohn's disease) presenting with relapse. The median age was 13 years (range: 3-17) and five patients were female. The median duration of the IBD was 18 months (range 2-48 months). All but one patient had stable disease prior to acquiring infection. Five patients required hospitalization due to significant dehydration. Three of the five patients treated with nitazoxanide had significant clinical improvement in 3 days. All patients had complete resolution of symptoms by three weeks and no infection related complications were noted. In comparison to patients with cryptosporidial infection, the control group required an increased need for escalation of therapy (71% vs. 0.0%, p=001) and higher re-hospitalization rates (24% Vs.0.0%, p=0.54) within 6 months following indexed relapse. CONCLUSION: In IBD patients, cryptosporidiosis can cause significant illness leading to increased need for hospitalization. In the absence of appropriate stool studies, cryptosporidiosis can be misdiagnosed as disease relapse and lead to inappropriate therapy. Nitazoxanide appears to be effective along with supportive therapy.},

   abstract = {Crohn's disease (CD) is a chronic granulomatous disease of unknown etiology that affects primarily the gastrointestinal system but can be associated with extraintestinal manifestations. Latent pulmonary involvement in children with CD has been described, but symptomatic pulmonary disease has rarely been reported in children. In this review, we report two pediatric cases, one with pleural effusion at the time of CD diagnosis and the other with bilateral cavitary lesions in a previously diagnosed CD patient. We review the current literature and summarize the diagnosis and management of pulmonary involvement in CD. Awareness of these pulmonary complications of CD in children may lead to more prompt diagnosis, guide appropriate therapy, and decrease morbidity.},

   abstract = {BACKGROUND/AIMS: In Crohn's disease (CD), skeletal muscle mass and function are reduced compared to healthy controls, potentially resulting in disability. Mechanisms contributing to muscle impairment, and thus potential therapeutic targets, are poorly understood. This study aimed to measure and compare skeletal muscle size and molecular targets involved in skeletal muscle growth, in CD subjects and healthy controls. METHODS: CD (n=27) and healthy (n=22) subjects were recruited from the IBD outpatient clinic and via local advertisement respectively. Demographics and clinical data were collected via survey and interview. Quadriceps muscle cross-sectional area was measured using peripheral quantitative CT scanning. Levels of muscle hypertrophy and atrophy signalling targets using quantitative PCR and western blotting were measured in muscle biopsies. RESULTS: Muscle size was 14% lower (p=0.055) and a 54% lower phosphorylated:total (p:t) Akt ratio was measured in the muscle samples (p<0.05), indicating an attenuated muscle hypertrophy pathway in CD compared with controls. In those with CD, a lower p:t Akt ratio (<0.97) was associated with lower serum vitamin D3, lower physical activity indices (49 vs 64 mmol/L, 1.7 vs 2.2x10(6) accelerometer counts respectively, each p<0.05) and a trend towards lower serum ferritin levels (128 vs 322mg/L, p=0.07), compared with CD subjects with normal/high p:t Akt ratios. CONCLUSION: The reduced muscle mass in CD may be explained, in part, by impaired activation of muscle protein synthesis pathways, notably the IGF1-Akt pathway. Normal vitamin D levels and regular exercise may be protective in CD against this trend, though confirmatory longitudinal studies are needed.},

   abstract = {BACKGROUND & AIMS: The association of fatigue with decreased physical performance and underlying mechanisms are poorly understood in Crohn's disease (CD). We aimed to measure and compare self-reported fatigue with skeletal muscle fatigue in CD subjects and healthy controls, and to identify associated factors that may be amenable to change. METHODS: Demographic and clinical data were collected and fatigue assessed using the Fatigue Impact Scale (FIS) in 27 consecutive CD patients and 22 matched healthy controls. Circulating cytokines and growth factors were measured. The rate of quadriceps muscle fatigue was assessed using an isokinetic dynamometer as the decrement of force with 30 contractions performed over a 5-minute period. RESULTS: Compared with healthy controls, CD patients reported greater levels of fatigue (mean global FIS score 45.3 vs 10.5, physical dimension score 12.3 vs 2.7 respectively; each p<0.01) and muscle fatigue (-5.2 vs -1.3 Nm min(-1); p<0.05). The two indices were correlated (r = -0.52 in CD; p<0.01). Patients with CD had lower mean serum IGF-1 levels (16.1 vs 25.4 pmol/L, p<0.01) and higher oxidative stress (TBARS assay 4.3 vs 3.9 muM, p<0.05). On multivariate analysis, low serum vitamin D, IGF-1 and magnesium, and higher IL-6 levels were associated with increased muscle fatigue (all p </= 0.05). CONCLUSION: Subjects with CD had more muscle fatigue than matched healthy controls and this correlated well with self-reported fatigue. Of circulating factors that were independently associated with increased muscle fatigue, vitamin D, magnesium and IGF-1 could be targeted in future studies to reduce fatigue and improve physical performance.},

   abstract = {OBJECTIVE: Anti-neutrophil cytoplasmic antibodies and anti-Saccharomyces cerevisiae mannan antibodies (ASCAs) have been detected in the serum of patients with ulcerative colitis (UC) and Crohn's disease (CD) and their unaffected family members. The aim of this study was to establish the value of serological markers as predictors of UC and CD. DESIGN: Individuals who developed CD or UC were identified from the European Prospective Investigation into Cancer and Nutrition (EPIC) study. At recruitment, none of the participants had a diagnosis of CD or UC. For each incident case, two controls were randomly selected matched for centre, date of birth, sex, date of recruitment and time of follow-up. Serum of cases and controls obtained at recruitment were analysed for ASCA IgG, ASCA IgA, perinuclear anti-neutrophil cytoplasmic antibody (pANCA), antibodies against Escherichia coli outer membrane porin C (OmpC) and flagellin CBir1. Conditional logistic regression was used to determine risk of CD and UC. Receiver operating characteristic curves were constructed to test accuracy. RESULTS: A total of 77 individuals were diagnosed with CD and 167 with UC after a mean follow-up of 4.5 (SD 3.2) and 4.4 (SD 3.1) years following blood collection, respectively. Combinations of pANCA, ASCA, anti-CBir1 and anti-OmpC were most accurate in predicting incident CD and UC (area under curve 0.679 and 0.657, respectively). The predictive value of the combination of markers increased when time to diagnosis of CD or UC decreased. CONCLUSION: A panel of serological markers is able to predict development of CD and UC in individuals from a low-risk population.},

METHODS: The 74-item PedsQL GI Module and 23-item PedsQL Generic Core Scales were completed in a 9-site study by 584 patients and 682 parents. Patients had physician-diagnosed GI disorders (such as chronic constipation, functional abdominal pain, irritable bowel syndrome, functional dyspepsia, Crohn disease, ulcerative colitis, gastroesophageal reflux disease). RESULTS: Fourteen unidimensional scales were derived measuring stomach pain, stomach discomfort when eating, food and drink limits, trouble swallowing, heartburn and reflux, nausea and vomiting, gas and bloating, constipation, blood, diarrhea, worry, medicines, and communication. The PedsQL GI Module Scales evidenced excellent feasibility, excellent reliability for the Total Scale Scores (patient self-report alpha = 0.97, parent proxy-report alpha = 0.97), and good-to-excellent reliability for the 14 individual scales (patient self-report alpha = 0.67-0.94, parent proxy-report alpha = 0.77-0.95). Intercorrelations with the Generic Core Scales supported construct validity. Individual Symptoms Scales known-groups validity across 7 GI disorders was generally supported. Factor analysis supported the unidimensionality of the individual scales. CONCLUSIONS: The PedsQL GI Module Scales demonstrated acceptable-to-excellent measurement properties and may be used as common metrics to compare GI-specific symptoms in clinical research and practice both within and across patient groups for FGIDs and organic GI diseases.},

STUDY DESIGN: The Pediatric Quality of Life Inventory 4.0 Generic Core Scales were completed in a 9-site study by 689 families. Patients had 1 of 7 physician-diagnosed GI disorders: chronic constipation, functional abdominal pain, irritable bowel syndrome, functional dyspepsia, Crohn's disease, ulcerative colitis, and gastroesophageal reflux disease. The healthy control sample included 1114 families. School days missed, days in bed and needing care, parent missed workdays, work impact, and healthcare utilization were compared as well. RESULTS: Patients with an FGID or organic GI disease demonstrated lower HRQOL than the healthy controls across all dimensions (physical, emotional, social, and school; P < .001 for all), with larger effect sizes for patients with an FGID. Patients with an FGID manifested lower HRQOL than those with an organic GI disease. Patients with an FGID or organic GI disease missed more school, spent more days in bed and needing care, had greater healthcare utilization, and had parents who missed more workdays with greater work impact (P < .001 for most), with larger effect sizes for the patients with an FGID. CONCLUSION: Patients with an FGID or organic GI disease demonstrate impaired HRQOL compared with healthy children. HRQOL can be used as a common metric to compare patient outcomes in clinical research and practice both within and across groups of patients with FGIDs and organic GI diseases.},

   abstract = {Curcumin belongs to the family of natural compounds collectively called curcuminoids and it possesses remarkable beneficial anti-oxidant, anti-inflammatory, anti-cancer, and neuroprotective properties. Moreover it is commonly assumed that curcumin has also been suggested as a remedy for digestive diseases such as inflammatory bowel diseases (IBD), a chronic immune disorder affecting the gastrointestinal tract and that can be divided in two major subgroups: Crohn's disease (CD) and Ulcerative Colitis (UC), depending mainly on the intestine tract affected by the inflammatory events. The chronic and intermittent nature of IBD imposes, where applicable, long-term treatments conducted in most of the cases combining different types of drugs. In more severe cases and where there has been no good response to the drugs, a surgery therapy is carried out. Currently, IBD-pharmacological treatments are generally not curative and often present serious side effects; for this reason, being known the relationship between nutrition and IBD, it is worthy of interesting the study and the development of new dietary strategy. The curcumin principal mechanism is the suppression of IBD inflammatory compounds (NF-kappaB) modulating immune response. This review summarizes literature data of curcumin as anti-inflammatory and anti-oxidant in IBD, trying to understand the different effects in CD e UC.},

   abstract = {Crohn's disease (CD) and ulcerative colitis (UC) are the two major phenotypes of inflammatory bowel diseases (IBD) which constitute a spectrum of chronic, debilitating diseases characterised by a relapsing inflammation of the intestinal mucosal lining. Evidence from a variety of disciplines implicates the intestinal microbiota in the pathogenesis of idiopathic IBD and their complications, including pouchitis. Many studies have reported a dysbiosis in IBD, characterised by a decrease in diversity, a decreased abundance of some dominant commensal members (such as Clostridium IV and XIVa) and an increase in detrimental bacteria (such as sulphate reducing bacteria and Escherichia coli). Therapies such as prebiotics and probiotics aim to selectively manipulate the intestinal microbiota and have been evaluated as an attractive therapeutic option with few side effects. The multispecies product VSL#3 was found effective in preventing and maintaining remission in pouchitis, whereas both VSL#3 and E. coli Nissle were effective in maintaining remission in UC. A more drastic approach to restore the composition of the microbiota and correct the underlying imbalance is a faecal microbiota transplantation (FMT). FMT has been successfully applied to treat patients with even recalcitrant Clostridium difficile infection. Particularly in UC, the majority of studies suggest that FMT may be an effective treatment option although the evidence is still limited. It is anticipated that our increasing knowledge on the composition and function of the intestinal microbiota components will allow in the future for a better selection of highly performing bacteria with specific functions required for specific benefits.},

   abstract = {Johne's disease or Paratuberculosis has emerged as major infectious disease of animals in general and domestic livestock in particular on global basis. There have been major initiatives in developed countries for the control of this incurable malady of animals and human beings alike (inflammatory bowel disease or Crohn's disease). Disease has not received similar attention due to inherent complexities of disease, diagnosis and control, in resource poor counties around the world. However, the rich genetic diverstiy of the otherwise low productive animal population offers opportunity for the control of Johne's disease and improve per animal productivity. Present review aims to gather and compile information available on genetics or resistance to Johne's disease and its future exploitation by resource poor countries rich in animal diversity. This review will also help to create awareness and share knowledge and experience on prevalence and opportunities for control of Johne's disease in the livestock population to boost per animal productivity among developing and poor countries of the world. Breeding of animals for disease resistance provides good, safe, effective and cheaper way of controlling Johne's disease in animals, with especial reference to domestic livestock of developing and poor countries. Study will help to establish better understanding of the correlation between host cell factors and resistance to MAP infection which may have ultimately help in the control of Johne's disease in future.},

A diagnosis of CMA in infancy was associated with Crohn disease (odds ratio [OR] 1.92, confidence interval [CI] 1.09-3.36, P < 0.05) and ulcerative colitis (OR 1.71, CI 1.04-2.83, P < 0.05), but childhood asthma only with Crohn disease (OR 2.33, CI 1.41-3.86, P = 0.001).

   abstract = {BACKGROUND: "Fast-track" management (FT) challenges traditional postoperative tenets in order to minimize discomfort and optimize inpatient care. We examined the outcomes of consecutively performed laparoscopic-assisted ileocecectomy for Crohn's disease (CD), with particular focus on FT's effects in patients with underlying bowel inflammation. METHODS: We retrospectively reviewed all patients undergoing isolated laparoscopic-assisted ileocecectomy for CD at our institution between 12/2000 and 12/2010, excluding patients with multiple areas of surgical CD, bladder involvement, or age >18years. RESULTS: Seventy-one patients aged 8-18years underwent isolated laparoscopic-assisted ileocecectomy for CD, of which 45 met FT criteria. Individual practice patterns primarily determined which patients were FT-managed. FT management led to decreased length of stay (LOS), time to first stool, time to full diet, and intravenous narcotic use. No significant difference in complications or disease progression was observed between the two groups during 2-year follow up. CONCLUSIONS: Our results suggest that FT is safe and effective in patients with CD. In a chronically ill population, counseling patients and families to expect early discharge is critical to the success of this strategy. Despite CD-related GI pathology, FT patients realized benefits in terms of LOS, time to bowel function, and narcotic use without any increase in complications.},

   abstract = {BACKGROUND: Enteral nutrition is used to treat a subset of patients with inflammatory bowel diseases. Because dietary factors may contribute to an aggressive immune response toward the intestinal microbiota in the disease susceptible host, we used TNFDeltaARE/WT mice to study the therapeutic effect of a semisynthetic experimental diet in the pathogenesis of Crohn's disease (CD)-like inflammation in the ileum. METHODS: TNFDeltaARE/WT mice were fed chow and experimental diets partially fortified with gluten in a dose and time-dependent manner. Histopathology, markers of inflammation, intraepithelial lymphocytes phenotypes, and antigen-specific reactivation of CD4(+) T cells were determined. RESULTS: TNFDeltaARE/WT mice being transferred to an experimental diet with 7 but not with 10 or 14 weeks of age were protected from development of Crohn's disease-like ileitis. Although disease-related CD8alphabeta(+) intraepithelial lymphocytes were increased irrespective of dietary intervention, the protective effect of experimental diet was associated with decreased expression of inflammation markers in ileal tissues. In addition, CD4(+) T-cell reactivation in bacterial antigen-primed dendritic cell cocultures was not altered between semisynthetic and chow diet-fed TNFDeltaARE/WT mice, suggesting bacteria-independent mechanisms. Most importantly, gluten-fortified experimental diet induced chronic ileitis in TNFDeltaARE/WT mice, despite the fact that gluten-derived peptides failed to induce CD4(+) T-cell activation. Reduced occludin expression levels suggest a negative role of gluten-fortified experimental diet on intestinal barrier integrity. CONCLUSIONS: Crohn's disease-like ileitis can be prevented at early stages of disease development using a semisynthetic experimental diet. Gluten was identified as antigen-independent dietary factor relevant for the induction of chronic inflammation in the small intestine of TNFDeltaARE/WT mice.},

It also has been shown to have benefits over and above induction of disease remission in paediatric populations. However, other than in Japanese populations, this intervention is not routinely utilised in adults. To investigate potential reasons for variation in response between adult studies of EEN and CS therapy. The Ovid database was searched over a 6-mo period. Articles directly comparing EEN and CS therapy in adults were included. Eleven articles were identified. EEN therapy remission rates varied considerably. Poor compliance with EEN therapy due to unpalatable formula was an issue in half of the studies. Remission rates of studies that only included patients with previously untreated/new CD were higher than studies including patients with both existing and new disease. There was limited evidence to determine if disease location, duration of disease or age of diagnosis affected EEN therapy outcomes. There is some evidence to support the use of EEN as a treatment option for a select group of adults, namely those motivated to adhere to an EEN regimen and possibly those newly diagnosed with CD. In addition, the use of more palatable formulas could improve treatment compliance.},

   abstract = {BACKGROUND & AIMS: Standard therapy for children newly diagnosed with Crohn's disease (CD) includes early administration of immunomodulators after initial treatment with corticosteroids. We compared the effectiveness of early (</=3 mo after diagnosis) treatment with an anti-tumor necrosis factor (TNF)alpha with that of an immunomodulator in attaining clinical remission and facilitating growth of pediatric patients. METHODS: We analyzed data from the RISK study, an observational research program that enrolled patients younger than age 17 diagnosed with inflammatory (nonpenetrating, nonstricturing) CD from 2008 through 2012 at 28 pediatric gastroenterology centers in North America. Patients were managed by physician dictate. From 552 children (median age, 11.8 y; 61% male; 63% with pediatric CD activity index scores >30; and median C-reactive protein level 5.6-fold the upper limit of normal), we used propensity score methodology to identify 68 triads of patients matched for baseline characteristics who were treated with early anti-TNFalpha therapy, early immunomodulator, or no early immunotherapy. We evaluated relationships among therapies, corticosteroid and surgery-free remission (pediatric CD activity index scores, </=10), and growth at 1 year for 204 children. Treatment after 3 months was a covariate. RESULTS: Early treatment with anti-TNFalpha was superior to early treatment with an immunomodulator (85.3% vs 60.3% in remission; relative risk, 1.41; 95% confidence interval [CI], 1.14-1.75; P = .0017), whereas early immunomodulator therapy was no different than no early immunotherapy (60.3% vs 54.4% in remission; relative risk, 1.11; 95% CI, 0.83-1.48; P = .49) in achieving remission at 1 year. Accounting for therapy after 3 months, early treatment with anti-TNFalpha remained superior to early treatment with an immunomodulator (relative risk, 1.51; 95% CI, 1.20-1.89; P = .0004), whereas early immunomodulator therapy was no different than no early immunotherapy (relative risk, 1.00; 95% CI, 0.75-1.34; P = .99). The mean height z-score increased compared with baseline only in the early anti-TNFalpha group. CONCLUSIONS: In children newly diagnosed with comparably severe CD, early monotherapy with anti-TNFalpha produced better overall clinical and growth outcomes at 1 year than early monotherapy with an immunomodulator. Further data will be required to best identify children most likely to benefit from early treatment with anti-TNFalpha therapy.},

   abstract = {Epithelial permeability is often increased in inflammatory bowel diseases. We hypothesized that perturbed mitochondrial function would cause barrier dysfunction and hence epithelial mitochondria could be targeted to treat intestinal inflammation. Mitochondrial dysfunction was induced in human colon-derived epithelial cell lines or colonic biopsy specimens using dinitrophenol, and barrier function was assessed by transepithelial flux of Escherichia coli with or without mitochondria-targeted antioxidant (MTA) cotreatment. The impact of mitochondria-targeted antioxidants on gut permeability and dextran sodium sulfate (DSS)-induced colitis in mice was tested. Mitochondrial superoxide evoked by dinitrophenol elicited significant internalization and translocation of E. coli across epithelia and control colonic biopsy specimens, which was more striking in Crohn's disease biopsy specimens; the mitochondria-targeted antioxidant, MitoTEMPO, inhibited these barrier defects. Increased gut permeability and reduced epithelial mitochondrial voltage-dependent anion channel expression were observed 3 days after DSS. These changes and the severity of DSS-colitis were reduced by MitoTEMPO treatment. In vitro DSS-stimulated IL-8 production by epithelia was reduced by MitoTEMPO. Metabolic stress evokes significant penetration of commensal bacteria across the epithelium, which is mediated by mitochondria-derived superoxide acting as a signaling, not a cytotoxic, molecule. MitoTEMPO inhibited this barrier dysfunction and suppressed colitis in DSS-colitis, likely via enhancing barrier function and inhibiting proinflammatory cytokine production. These novel findings support consideration of MTAs in the maintenance of epithelial barrier function and the management of inflammatory bowel diseases.},

   abstract = {BACKGROUND: The aim of this study was to clarify the risk and characteristics of intestinal failure (IF) in patients with Crohn's disease (CD). METHODS: The present study was a retrospective study in 12 hospitals. CD patients who underwent initial surgery at any of the 12 hospitals between 1970 and 2009 were collected (n = 1,703). Those who developed IF were reviewed (n = 68), and the cumulative risk of IF was analyzed by the Kaplan-Meier method. In addition, IF patients who underwent initial surgery at other hospitals and were then treated at any of the 12 hospitals were also reviewed (n = 33). Thus, a total of 101 IF patients were collected, and the cumulative risk of IF-related death was analyzed. RESULTS: The cumulative risk of IF after the initial surgery was 0.8 % (5 years), 3.6 % (10 years), 6.1 % (15 years), and 8.5 % (20 years). In CD patients with IF, mean age at initial surgery, IF occurrence, and present age at the time of the study were 28.2, 38.2, and 46.1 years, respectively. The mean number of surgeries per patient was 3.3. The mean length of the remnant small bowel was 163 cm. Twelve IF patients (12 %) had died and the cumulative risk of IF-related death by the time from the occurrence of IF was 1.1 % (3 years), 3.7 % (5 years), 6.5 % (7 years), and 8.9 % (10 years). CONCLUSION: The occurrence of IF and IF-related death in CD patients is not rare over the long term. There is a pressing need to develop strategies for the prevention and management of IF.},

   abstract = {BACKGROUND: Dietary fiber may favorably influence fermentation, gastrointestinal inflammation, and disease progression in Crohn's disease, ulcerative colitis (UC), and pouchitis and offer an attractive therapeutic addition to pharmacological treatment. This systematic review appraised data from randomized controlled trials of fiber in the management of inflammatory bowel disease. METHODS: The review followed Cochrane and PRISMA recommendations. Seven electronic databases were searched along with hand searching and contacting experts. Inclusion criteria were randomized controlled trials of the effects of fiber on clinical endpoints (primarily disease activity for treatment or maintenance) or physiological outcomes in patients with inflammatory bowel disease. RESULTS: In total, 23 randomized controlled trials fulfilled the inclusion criteria (UC, 10; Crohn's disease, 12; and pouchitis, 1) recruiting 1296 patients. In UC, 3/10 studies reported fiber supplementation to benefit disease outcomes. In Crohn's disease, 0/12 studies and in pouchitis 1/1 study reported a benefit on disease activity. Despite this, a number of studies reported favorable intragroup effects on physiological outcomes including fecal butyrate, fecal calprotectin, inflammatory cytokines, microbiota, and gastrointestinal symptom indices. Meta-analysis was not possible. CONCLUSIONS: There is limited weak evidence for the efficacy of fiber in improving disease outcomes in UC and pouchitis. The potential antiinflammatory role of fiber is intriguing and merits further investigation in adequately powered clinical trials. Excluding overt gastrointestinal obstruction, there was no evidence that fiber intake should be restricted in patients with inflammatory bowel disease.},

   abstract = {INTRODUCTION: Eosinophils contribute to the pathogenesis of inflammatory bowel disease (IBD) in the intestine. Eosinophilic cationic protein (ECP) is one of the most important eosinophilic specific mediators released during activation. The aim of the study was to evaluate the clinical value of serum ECP determination in children with active and inactive IBD and its correlation with disease activity. MATERIAL AND METHODS: There were 125 children with IBD (63 with Crohn's disease - CD, 44 with ulcerative colitis - UC, 18 indeterminate colitis - IC) enrolled in the study. Among them 83 children were in the active phase of the disease, while the remaining 42 were in remission. The control group consisted of 56 healthy children. The ECP was assessed three times in children with active IBD, at baseline and after 2 and 6 weeks of treatment and once in children with inactive IBD and controls using fluoroenzymeimmunoassays. RESULTS: We found elevated ECP at baseline in the total active IBD group when compared to the inactive IBD and control groups, decreasing during treatment. Serum ECP was also elevated in the active UC and CD groups when compared to the inactive UC and CD groups, and correlated with clinical UC and CD activity (R = 0.57 and R = 0.52, p < 0.05, respectively) and duration of the clinical manifestation in UC (R = 0.62, p < 0.05) but not with the disease location in the gastrointestinal tract, or endoscopic and histopathological activity. CONCLUSIONS: Evaluation of serum ECP in children with IBD may be useful in disease activity assessment at onset and during the treatment.},

   abstract = {OBJECTIVES: The function of interleukin (IL)-37 has not been resolved. We recently showed that IL-37 suppresses colonic inflammation in mice. To gain more insight into its relevance in human disease, we investigated the expression of IL-37 in the intestine of pediatric patients with chronic inflammatory bowel disease (IBD). METHODS: Intestinal biopsies were obtained from children with IBD (18 Crohn disease [CD], 14 ulcerative colitis [UC] and 11 controls) during endoscopy and analyzed for IL-37 expression by immunohistochemistry and real-time polymerase chain reaction. Results were correlated with immunostaining for IL-18 and IL-17, messenger RNA (mRNA) levels of pro- and anti-inflammatory cytokines, and clinical parameters. RESULTS: IL-37 protein was detected in epithelial cells and submucosal lymphoid cells of patients with CD and UC as well as healthy controls. IL-37 protein expression tended to be higher with submucosal lymphoid cell infiltration of patients with CD and UC and correlated with histological severity score of inflammation. IL-18 showed a staining pattern similar to that of IL-37, whereas staining for IL-17 revealed distinct positive cells scattered in the submucosal layer. mRNA expression of IL-8, IL-17, and IL-10 was upregulated in patients with CD and UC. mRNA levels of IL-18 and IL-37 were not significantly elevated compared with controls. Levels of IL-37 and IL-18 mRNA showed a positive correlation in the CD group. CONCLUSIONS: IL-37 protein is expressed in healthy and diseased bowel tissue. IL-37 and IL-18 show a similar expression pattern and correlate at mRNA levels. Future studies are warranted to delineate the specific contribution of IL-37 to modulate chronic bowel inflammation in humans.},

   abstract = {AIM: To determine whether temporal changes occurred in the pediatric vs adult inflammatory bowel disease (IBD), both in terms of number and type of yearly published articles. METHODS: We aimed to evaluate all PubMed-registered articles related to the field of IBD from January 1, 1993 and until December 31, 2011. We searched for articles using the key words "inflammatory bowel disease" or "Crohn's disease" or "ulcerative colitis" or "undetermined colitis", using the age filters of "child" or "adult". We repeated the search according to the total number per year of articles per type of article, for each year of the specified period. We studied randomized controlled trials, clinical trials, case reports, meta-analyses, letters to the editor, reviews, systematic reviews, practice guidelines, and editorials. RESULTS: We identified 44645 articles over the 19 year-period. There were 8687 pediatric-tagged articles vs 19750 adult-tagged articles. Thus 16208 articles were unaccounted and not assigned a "pediatric" or "adult" tag by PubMed. There was an approximately 3-fold significant increase in all articles recorded both in pediatric and adult articles. This significant increase was true for nearly every category of article but the number of clinical trials, meta-analysis, and randomized controlled trials increased proportionally more than the number of "lower quality" articles such as editorials or letters to the editor. Very few guidelines were published every year. CONCLUSION: There is a yearly linear increase in publications related to IBD. Relatively, there are more and more clinical trials and higher quality articles.},

   abstract = {BACKGROUND: Pyoderma gangrenosum (PG) and erythema nodosum (EN) are the most common cutaneous manifestations of inflammatory bowel disease (IBD) but little is known regarding their etiopathogenesis. METHODS: We performed a case-control study comparing characteristics between IBD patients with a documented episode of PG (PG+) and/or EN (EN+) with those without PG (PG-) and EN (EN-). Data on clinical features were obtained by chart review. IBD-related serology was determined using enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay and genome-wide data generated using Illumina technology. Standard statistical tests for association were used. RESULTS: We identified a total of 92 cases of PG and 103 cases of EN with genetic and clinical characteristics, of which 64 PG and 55 EN cases were available for serological analyses. Fewer male subjects were identified in the PG(+) (odds ratio 0.6, P = 0.009) and EN(+) groups (odds ratio 0.31, P = 0 < 0.0001). Colonic disease, previous IBD-related surgery, and noncutaneous extra-intestinal manifestations were more common among both PG(+) and EN(+) patients compared with controls. PG(+) was associated with anti-nuclear cytoplasmic antibody seropositivity (P = 0.03) and higher anti-nuclear cytoplasmic antibody level (P = 0.02) in Crohn's disease. Genetic associations with PG included known IBD loci (IL8RA [P = 0.00003] and PRDM1 [0.03]) as well as with USP15 (4.8 x 10) and TIMP3 (5.6 x10). Genetic associations with EN included known IBD susceptibility genes (PTGER4 [P = 8.8 x 10], ITGAL [0.03]) as well as SOCS5 (9.64 x 10), CD207 (3.14 x 10), ITGB3 (7.56 x 10), and rs6828740 (4q26) (P < 5.0 x 10). Multivariable models using clinical, serologic, and genetic parameters predicted PG (area under the curve = 0.8) and EN (area under the curve = 0.97). CONCLUSION: Cutaneous manifestations in IBD are associated with distinctive genetic characteristics and with the similar clinical characteristics, including the development of other extra-intestinal manifestations suggesting shared and distinct etiologies.},

   abstract = {BACKGROUND AND AIMS: Exclusive enteral nutrition (EEN) induces remission in patients with Crohn's disease (CD). We investigated the short-term impact of EEN on bone quality and muscle mass in children with CD. METHODS: Ten newly diagnosed CD patients (7 male, 10.6-17.7 years of age) were assessed by peripheral quantitative computed tomography (pQCT) at the forearm before starting an 8-weeks treatment with EEN, and after 12 and 52 weeks. No steroids or biologicals were applied. Trabecular and cortical bone mineral density, total bone, and muscle cross-sectional area (CSA) were measured by pQCT and expressed as age- and sex-specific z-scores; size-dependent CSAs were corrected for low height for age. Wilcoxon rank sum test was applied. RESULTS: Remission at week 12 was achieved in 8 patients; 2 still had mild disease. Initially low trabecular density z-scores improved (+0.3; p = 0.006) at week 12; simultaneously, the increased cortical density z-scores normalized (-0.4; p = 0.027). The low z-score for muscle CSA corrected for height (median -2.5, range -3.49 to -0.97) increased within 12 weeks (+1.0; p = 0.002) with no further improvement thereafter. CONCLUSIONS: The results indicate disturbed bone remodeling and severely impaired muscle mass in newly diagnosed CD children. Bone metabolism and muscle mass improved within 3 months after starting EEN with no further normalization thereafter.},

   abstract = {BACKGROUND AND AIMS: Inflammatory bowel disease (IBD) frequently manifests during childhood and adolescence. For providing and understanding a comprehensive picture of a patients' health status, health-related quality of life (HRQoL) instruments are an essential complement to clinical symptoms and functional limitations. Currently, the IMPACT-III questionnaire is one of the most frequently used disease-specific HRQoL instrument among patients with IBD. However, there is a lack of studies examining the validation and reliability of this instrument. METHODS: 146 paediatric IBD patients from the multicenter Swiss IBD paediatric cohort study database were included in the study. Medical and laboratory data were extracted from the hospital records. HRQoL data were assessed by means of standardized questionnaires filled out by the patients in a face-to-face interview. RESULTS: The original six IMPACT-III domain scales could not be replicated in the current sample. A principal component analysis with the extraction of four factor scores revealed the most robust solution. The four factors indicated good internal reliability (Cronbach's alpha=.64-.86), good concurrent validity measured by correlations with the generic KIDSCREEN-27 scales and excellent discriminant validity for the dimension of physical functioning measured by HRQoL differences for active and inactive severity groups (p<.001, d=1.04). CONCLUSIONS: This study with Swiss children with IBD indicates good validity and reliability for the IMPACT-III questionnaire. However, our findings suggest a slightly different factor structure than originally proposed. The IMPACT-III questionnaire can be recommended for its use in clinical practice. The factor structure should be further examined in other samples.},

   abstract = {The gastrointestinal microbiota is a complex ecosystem with each human individual hosting at least 160 different bacterial strains. Our understanding of its role is rapidly expanding as a result of the molecular microbiological techniques that can accurately characterise its composition and 'omics' technologies that measure its metabolic activity. Since 1995, extensive research has investigated the prebiotic concept, which describes how supplementation of some non-digestible oligosaccharides can stimulate the growth and/or activity of specific genera including bifidobacteria. However, the vast majority of studies are in healthy human subjects, with few undertaken in patients with disorders relevant to clinical nutrition. Marked alterations of the luminal microbiota have been demonstrated in patients with digestive disorders, highlighting mechanisms through which they might be involved in their pathogenesis, including higher clostridia in patients who develop diarrhoea during enteral nutrition and the influence of bifidobacteria on intestinal dendritic cell phenotype in Crohn's disease. The impact of prebiotics on the intestinal microbiota of healthy people has not been consistently replicated in patients with digestive disorders. For example, a number of studies show that inulin/oligofructose do not increase bifidobacteria in enteral nutrition and Crohn's disease. Indeed, in Crohn's disease and irritable bowel syndrome there is evidence that some prebiotics in high doses worsen functional symptoms. Unlike healthy human subjects, patients experience a number of issues that may alter their gastrointestinal microbiota (disease, antibiotics and inflammation) and the use of microbiota modifying therapies, such as prebiotics, do not always elicit the same effects in patients as they do in healthy people.},

   abstract = {PURPOSE OF REVIEW: There is direct evidence that the pathogenesis of inflammatory bowel disease (IBD) involves the gastrointestinal microbiota and some evidence that the microbiota might also play a similar role in irritable bowel syndrome (IBS). The aim of this article is to review the emerging evidence for the mechanisms and effectiveness of probiotics in the management of these disorders. RECENT FINDINGS: The composition of the gastrointestinal microbiota is strongly influenced by factors including age, diet and disease. Probiotics may be effective through their impact on the host gastrointestinal microbiota and promotion of mucosal immunoregulation. Probiotics are considered to be well tolerated, although the quality of studies and health claims has been variable. There are many short-term studies demonstrating the effectiveness of probiotics in IBS, although recommendations should be made for specific strains and for specific symptoms. Within IBD, a number of trials have shown the benefits of a range of probiotics in pouchitis and in ulcerative colitis, although current evidence in Crohn's disease is less promising. SUMMARY: Clearly, some probiotics have considerable potential in the management of IBS and IBD; however, the benefits are strain specific. High-quality trials of probiotics in gastrointestinal disorders as well as laboratory investigations of their mechanism of action are required in order to understand who responds and why.},

   abstract = {BACKGROUND: Limited studies have examined the intestinal microbiota composition in relation to changes in disease course of IBD over time. We aimed to study prospectively the fecal microbiota in IBD patients developing an exacerbation during follow-up. DESIGN: Fecal samples from 10 Crohn's disease (CD) and 9 ulcerative colitis (UC) patients during remission and subsequent exacerbation were included. Active disease was determined by colonoscopy and/or fecal calprotectine levels. Exclusion criteria were pregnancy, antibiotic use, enema use and/or medication changes between consecutive samples. The microbial composition was assessed by 16S rDNA pyrosequencing. RESULTS: After quality control, 6,194-11,030 sequences per sample were available for analysis. Patient-specific shifts in bacterial composition and diversity were observed during exacerbation compared to remission, but overarching shifts within UC or CD were not observed. Changes in the bacterial community composition between remission and exacerbation as assessed by Bray-Curtis dissimilarity, were significantly larger in CD versus UC patients (0.59 vs. 0.42, respectively; p = 0.025). Thiopurine use was found to be a significant cause of clustering as shown by Principal Coordinate Analysis and was associated with decreases in bacterial richness (Choa1 501.2 vs. 847.6 in non-users; p<0.001) and diversity (Shannon index: 5.13 vs. 6.78, respectively; p<0.01). CONCLUSION: Shifts in microbial composition in IBD patients with changing disease activity over time seem to be patient-specific, and are more pronounced in CD than in UC patients. Furthermore, thiopurine use was found to be associated with the microbial composition and diversity, and should be considered when studying the intestinal microbiota in relation to disease course.},

   abstract = {OBJECTIVES: To assess vitamin D status of pediatric patients with Crohn's disease (CD) and to compare their serum 25-hydroxyvitamin D (s-25OHD) with established cutoffs and assess whether 6 months of supplementation with 2000 IU/d, vs 400 IU/d, would reduce the group prevalence of vitamin D below these cutoffs. STUDY DESIGN: Subjects 8-18 years (n = 83) with quiescent CD were randomized to either 400 or 2000 IU vitamin D3/d for 6 months. RESULTS: Baseline mean +/- SD s-25OHD was 24 +/- 8 ng/mL; 13 subjects (16%) had an s-25OHD <16 ng/mL, 27 (33%) < 20 ng/mL, and 65 (79%) < 30 ng/mL. There was no significant difference between groups in achieving the cutoffs of 16 ng/mL or 20 ng/mL at 6 months; however, only 35% of the 400 IU group achieved the greater cutoff of 30 ng/mL compared with 74% in the 2000 IU group (P < .001). Baseline adjusted mean s-25OHD concentrations at 6 months were 9.6 ng/mL (95% CI 6.0-13.2, P < .001) greater in the 2000 IU than the 400 IU group. Disease activity was not affected by supplement dose. Few subjects exceeded safety marker cutoffs, and this did not differ by dose. CONCLUSIONS: At baseline, a high proportion of patients had a mean s-25OHD >20 ng/mL. 2000 IU vitamin D3/d is more effective in raising s-25OHD concentrations to > 30 ng/mL in children with CD than 400 IU/d, but both treatments were equally effective at achieving 16 or 20 ng/mL.},

   abstract = {UNLABELLED: Paediatric inflammatory bowel disease (IBD), especially Crohn's disease (CD), is commonly associated with poor skeletal health, related to the direct effects of chronic inflammation, prolonged use of glucocorticoid (GC), poor nutrition, delayed puberty and low muscle mass. Low bone mineral density is commonly reported, although the prevalence of long bone fractures may not be increased in these patients. Emerging evidence however suggests that there may be an increased risk of vertebral fractures (VFs) in this group. VFs presenting at diagnosis of paediatric CD, prior to any GC exposure, have been reported, highlighting the deleterious effect of inflammation on skeletal health. This paper reviews the published literature on pathophysiology of skeletal morbidity and fractures in paediatric IBD, illustrated with a new case report of multiple VFs in a prepubertal girl with CD, soon after diagnosis, who received minimal amounts of oral GC. Optimising control of disease, addressing vitamin D deficiency, encouraging physical activity and ensuring normal growth and pubertal progression are paramount to management of bone health in these patients. Despite the lack of evidence, there may be a place for bisphosphonate treatment, especially in the presence of symptomatic pathological fractures, but this requires close monitoring by clinicians with expertise in paediatric bone health. CONCLUSION: Chronic inflammation mediated by pro-inflammatory cytokines may have adverse effects on skeletal health in paediatric patients with IBD. The risk of vertebral fractures may be increased, even without exposure to glucocorticoid. Clinical monitoring of these patients requires careful attention to the various factors that impact on bone health.},

   abstract = {The human gut contains a vast number of microorganisms known collectively as the gut microbiota. Despite its importance in maintaining the health of the host, growing evidence suggests the gut microbiota may also be an important factor in the pathogenesis of various diseases, a number of which have shown a rapid increase in incidence over the past few decades. In some of these diseases, such as inflammatory bowel disease (IBD), the microbiota is dysbiotic with an abnormal community structure and decrease in diversity. If the dysbiotic microbiota plays a role in disease pathogenesis, interventions that modify its composition to make it more similar to the microbiota observed in health, might be a strategy to treat certain disease processes. Indeed, the high-level efficacy of fecal microbiota transplantation in the treatment of refractory Clostridia difficile infection supports this notion as proof-of-principle. The composition of the microbiota can be influenced by many factors including age, genetics, host environment, and diet. With respect to the later, diet has an impact upon both the composition and function of the microbiota. There are epidemiologic data associating diet with the development of IBD as well as evidence that diet can influence both the form and function of the microbiome in a manner that impacts upon the development of intestinal inflammation. Based on this evidence, studies are now underway to examine the effect of defined formula diets, an effective therapeutic modality in Crohn's disease, on both the gut microbiome and its metabolome as a therapeutic probe with the hope of better defining the 'healthy' diet in patients with IBD.},

   abstract = {The peptide transporter PEPT1, expressed in the brush border membrane of enterocytes, mediates the uptake of di- and tripeptides from luminal protein digestion in the small intestine. PEPT1 was proposed not to be expressed in normal colonic mucosa but may become detectable in inflammatory states such as Crohn's disease or ulcerative colitis. We reassessed colonic expression of PEPT1 by performing a systematic analysis of PEPT1 mRNA and protein levels in healthy colonic tissues in mice, rats, and humans. Immunofluorescence analysis of different mouse strains (C57BL/6N, 129/Sv, BALB/c) demonstrated the presence of PEPT1 in the distal part of the colon but not in proximal colon. Rat and human intestines display a similar distribution of PEPT1 as found in mice. However, localization in human sigmoid colon revealed immunoreactivity present at low levels in apical membranes but substantial staining in distinct intracellular compartments. Functional activity of PEPT1 in colonic tissues from mice was assessed in everted sac preparations using [(1)(4)C]Gly-Sar and found to be 5.7-fold higher in distal compared with proximal colon. In intestinal tissues from Pept1-/- mice, no [(1)(4)C]Gly-Sar transport was detectable but feces samples revealed significantly higher water content than in wild-type mice, suggesting that PEPT1 contributes to colonic water absorption. In conclusion, our studies unequivocally demonstrate the presence of PEPT1 protein in healthy distal colonic epithelium in mice, rats, and humans and proved that the protein is functional and contributes to electrolyte and water handling in mice.},

   abstract = {BACKGROUND: PEPT1 was proposed to be expressed only in inflamed colonic tissues in which it could contribute to inflammatory bowel disease (IBD) development by transporting bacterial peptides, such as muramyl dipeptide (MDP), that activate intracellular pattern recognition receptors, such as the nucleotide-binding and oligomerization domain 2. To better define the pathological relevance of this transporter, we analyzed PEPT1 expression during intestinal inflammation and studied the susceptibility of Pept1-deficient (Pept1) mice to experimental colitis. METHODS: Wild-type and Pept1 mice were treated with dextran sulfate sodium and 2,4,6-trinitrobenzene sulfonic acid to induce colitis, and MDP-induced cytokine expression was studied in colonic tissue cultures. PEPT1 expression was characterized in mouse models of Crohn's disease-like ileitis (Tnf) or colitis (Il-10, Il-10XTlr2) and endoscopic tissue samples from descending colon of patients with IBD (n = 11) and controls (n = 17). Moreover, the prevalence of the PEPT1 single-nucleotide polymorphism rs2297322 was tested in German patients with IBD (n = 458) and controls (n = 452). RESULTS: PEPT1 expression was consistently reduced under condition of acute or chronic experimental inflammation. Wild-type and Pept1 mice revealed comparable susceptibility to dextran sulfate sodium-induced and 2,4,6-trinitrobenzene sulfonic acid-induced colitis, and MDP-induced cytokine expression was PEPT1-independent. PEPT1 expression levels were also decreased in descending colon of patients with IBD during acute inflammation, but the rs2297322 single-nucleotide polymorphism was not associated with IBD susceptibility in the German cohort. CONCLUSIONS: PEPT1 expression is reduced during intestinal inflammation and PEPT1 is neither required for MDP-induced immune response nor is the PEPT1 rs2297322 single-nucleotide polymorphism associated with IBD susceptibility in our German cohort. These data strongly argue against a primary role of PEPT1 in the initiation or progression of IBD.},

   abstract = {BACKGROUND: The chemokine CCL25, and its receptor CCR9, constitute a unique chemokine/receptor pair, which regulates trafficking of T lymphocytes to the small intestine under physiological conditions and is an attractive target for small bowel Crohn's disease drug development. We have previously shown that CCL25/CCR9 interactions regulate the recovery from acute dextran sulfate sodium-induced colonic inflammation. In this study, we explored whether these interactions also regulate chronic colitis development in 2 independent murine models of experimental colitis. METHODS: Histological flow cytometry and qPCR analyses were performed to evaluate the role of CL25 and CCR9 in chronic colonic inflammation induced by serial exposures to dextran sulfate sodium salts or by adoptive transfer of CD45RB(hi) CD4(+) T cell into lymphopenic mice devoid of CCL25/CCR9 interactions. RESULTS: Chronic dextran sulfate sodium exposure results in exacerbated colitis in mice deficient for either CCR9 or CCL25 when compared with wild-type control mice. Although CCR9-deficient T cells traffic to the colon and induce severe colitis similar to wild-type T cells in the CD45RB transfer model, naive wild-type T cells induce more severe disease in recipient animals devoid of CCL25 expression. CONCLUSIONS: CCL25/CCR9 interactions are required for modulating protection against large intestinal inflammation in 2 models of chronic colitis. These data may have implications for the potential effects of disrupting CCL25/CCR9 interactions in humans in the setting of intestinal disorders including inflammatory bowel disease.},

The role of dietary interventions and enteral nutrition in the management of IBD remains unelucidated. This study was to review the current evidence for dietary risk factors for the development of IBD and the efficacies of dietary and enteral interventions. RECENT FINDINGS: High dietary intakes of total fats, polyunsaturated fatty acids, omega-6 fatty acids, and meat are associated with an increased risk of Crohn's disease and ulcerative colitis. Further prospective studies are required to confirm these observations. Among various dietary interventions, none has shown striking efficacy. Meta-analyses have shown enteral nutrition to be inferior to corticosteroids in adults with active Crohn's disease. However, in children, a meta-analysis has shown no significant difference in the remission rates between enteral nutrition and corticosteroid therapy. Although the evidence level is not striking, enteral nutrition may be useful for maintaining remission in patients with quiescent Crohn's disease. SUMMARY: Dietary risk factors for IBD and the therapeutic benefit of dietary and enteral interventions need to be confirmed by further well designed studies in large cohorts of patients.},

   abstract = {PURPOSE: The aim of this study was to investigate the long-term effect of enteral nutrition (EN) as a maintenance therapy in Crohn's disease (CD) patients following surgery. METHODS: This study was an extension of our previous study to prolong the duration of intervention and follow-up from 1 to 5 years. Forty consecutive patients who underwent resection for ileal or ileocolic CD were included. Following surgery, 20 patients received continuous elemental diet infusion during the nighttime plus a low-fat diet during the daytime (EN group). Another 20 patients received neither nutritional therapy nor food restriction (control group). All patients were followed for 5 years after operation. No patient received corticosteroid, immunosuppressants, or infliximab except patients who developed recurrence. The end point of this study was recurrence requiring biologic therapy or reoperation. Recurrence rates were analyzed on an intention-to-treat basis. RESULTS: In the EN group, four patients could not continue tube intubation for elemental diet intake. Two patients (10 %) in the EN group and nine patients (45 %) in the control group developed recurrence requiring infliximab therapy (P = 0.03). The cumulative recurrence incidence rate requiring infliximab was significantly lower in the EN group vs the control group (P = 0.02). One patient (5 %) in the EN group and five patients (25 %) in the control group required reoperation for recurrence (P = 0.18). The cumulative incidence of reoperation was lower in the EN group vs the control group, the difference not being significant (P = 0.08). CONCLUSION: The outcomes of this study suggest that EN therapy reduces the incidence of postoperative CD recurrence.},

   abstract = {BACKGROUND/OBJECTIVES: Enterocutaneous fistula (ECF) is a serious complication of Crohn's disease (CD). Enteral nutrition (EN) is believed as one of therapeutic strategies of CD. This study is dedicated to identify predictors of response to EN in CD, which may lead to a better selection of fistula patients for this therapy. SUBJECTS/METHODS: Forty-eight CD patients with ECF treated with short-peptide-based EN for 3 months were included in this study. All patients were followed up for at least 6 months. Logistic regression was performed to investigate the potential predictors of response to EN in these patients. RESULTS: In total, 30 out of 48 patients were confirmed with a successful closure of fistula after 3 months' EN therapy. The average closure time was 32.4+/-8.85 days. Inflammatory parameters (erythrocyte sedimentation rate, C-reactive protein (CRP) and platelet count) improved significantly after EN therapy in all enrolled patients. Specifically, the improvement of CRP after therapy in closed group was more important compared with that in unclosed group (P=0.035). Nutrition status (body weight, body mass index (BMI), hemoglobin, serum albumin (ALB), serum prealbumin and total protein (TP)) improved as well (P<0.05). Similarly, after treatment, the improvement of serum albumin (P=0.046) and prealbumin (P=0.006) in closed group was much more important than those in unclosed group. Logistic regression analysis discovered that a decreased CRP level and an elevated BMI level would be beneficial to the response to EN in CD patients with ECF. CONCLUSIONS: In CD patients with ECF, lower CRP and higher BMI are associated with higher possibility of closure after EN treatment. EN therapy can lead to a closure of ECF in a certain proportion of patients. EN therapy could also ameliorate inflammatory condition and improve nutrition status.},

METHODS: A total of 57 CD patients were prospectively selected from the Sixth Affiliated Hospital of Sun Yat-sen University as the study group, while 51 healthy subjects as the control group. Protein content, mineral content, fat content, lean body mass, waist circumference, and hip circumference in the two groups were measured by body composition analyzer. Characteristics of CD at different location and different disease activity index were investigated as well. RESULTS: Intracellular fluid, extracellular fluid, weight, protein content, fat content, lean body mass, muscle weight, body fat ratio, waist hip ratio, body weight ratio, arm muscle circumference, arm circumference, quality of cells, BMI and basal metabolic rate in CD patients were significantly lower than those in control group(all P<0.05). Proportion of protein-deficiency patients and fat-deficiency patients were 66.7% and 47.4% respectively. Protein content, fat content, and lean body mass in ileocolic CD patients were lower than those with small bowel and colonic CD(all P<0.05). Protein content, fat content, lean body mass in patients with high disease activity index were lower than those in patients with low and medium index, but higher basal metablic rate was found in the former group(all P<0.05). CONCLUSIONS: The human body composition in patients with CD are different from healthy people. Disease location and disease activity index have an impact on protein content, fat content, and lean body mass.},

   abstract = {BACKGROUND & AIMS: There is controversy about whether levels of anti-tumor necrosis factor (TNF) and antidrug antibodies (ADAs) are accurate determinants of loss of response to therapy. We analyzed the association between trough levels of anti-TNF agents or ADAs and outcomes of interventions for patients with loss of response to infliximab or adalimumab. METHODS: We performed a retrospective study of pediatric and adult patients with inflammatory bowel disease and suspected loss of response to anti-TNF agents treated at medical centers throughout Israel from October 2009 through February 2013. We examined the correlation between outcomes of different interventions and trough levels of drug or ADAs during loss of response. An additional subanalysis was performed including only patients with a definite inflammatory loss of response (clinical worsening associated with increased levels of C-reactive protein or fecal calprotectin, or detection of inflammation by endoscopy, fistula discharge, or imaging studies). RESULTS: Among 247 patients (42 with ulcerative colitis), there were 330 loss-of-response events (188 to infliximab and 142 to adalimumab). Trough levels of adalimumab greater than 4.5 mcg/mL and infliximab greater than 3.8 mcg/mL identified patients who failed to respond to an increase in drug dosage or a switch to another anti-TNF agent with 90% specificity; these were set as adequate trough levels. Adequate trough levels identified patients who responded to expectant management or out-of-class interventions with more than 75% specificity. Levels of antibodies against adalimumab >4 microgram per mL equivalent (mcg/mL-eq) or antibodies against infliximab >9 mcg/mL-eq identified patients who did not respond to an increased drug dosage with 90% specificity. Patients with high titers of ADAs had longer durations of response when anti-TNF agents were switched than when dosage was increased (P = .03; log-rank test), although dosage increases were more effective for patients with no or low titers of ADAs (P = .02). An analysis of definite inflammatory loss-of-response events (n = 244) produced similar results; patients with adequate trough levels had a longer duration of response when they switched to a different class of agent than when anti-TNF was optimized by either a dosage increase or by a switch within the anti-TNF class (P = .002; log-rank test). CONCLUSIONS: The results of this retrospective analysis suggest that trough levels of drug or ADAs may guide therapeutic decisions for more than two-thirds of inflammatory bowel disease patients with either clinically suspected or definite inflammatory loss of response to therapy.},

   abstract = {BACKGROUND & AIMS: The level of fecal calprotectin (FC) can predict the onset of inflammatory bowel disease (IBD) with high accuracy and precision. We evaluated the cost-effectiveness of using measurements of FC to identify adults and children who require endoscopic confirmation of IBD. METHODS: We constructed a decision analytic tree to compare the cost-effectiveness of measuring FC before endoscopy examination with that of direct endoscopic evaluation alone. A second decision analytic tree was constructed to evaluate the cost-effectiveness of FC cutoff levels of 100 mug/g vs 50 mug/g (typically used to screen for intestinal inflammation). The primary outcome measure was the incremental cost required to avoid 1 false-negative result by using FC level to diagnose new-onset IBD. RESULTS: In adults, FC screening saved $417/patient but delayed diagnosis for 2.2/32 patients with IBD among 100 screened patients. In children, FC screening saved $300/patient but delayed diagnosis for 4.8/61 patients with IBD among 100 screened patients. If endoscopic biopsy analysis remained the standard for diagnosis, direct endoscopic evaluation would cost an additional $18,955 in adults and $6250 in children to avoid 1 false-negative result from FC screening. Sensitivity analyses showed that cost-effectiveness of FC screening varied with the sensitivity of the test and the pre-test probability of IBD in adults and children. Pre-test probabilities for IBD of </=75% in adults and </=65% in children made FC screening cost-effective, but it was cost-ineffective if the probabilities were >/=85% and >/=78% in adults and children, respectively. Compared with the FC cutoff level of 100 mug/g, the cutoff level of 50 mug/g cost an additional $55 and $43 for adults and children, respectively, but it yielded 2.4 and 6.1 additional accurate diagnoses of IBD per 100 screened adults and children, respectively. CONCLUSIONS: Screening adults and children to measure fecal levels of calprotectin is effective and cost-effective in identifying those with IBD on a per-case basis when the pre-test probability is </=75% for adults and </=65% for children. The utility of the test is greater for adults than children. Increasing the FC cutoff level to >/=50 mug/g increases diagnostic accuracy without substantially increasing total cost.},

   abstract = {BACKGROUND AND AIM: Fatigue, weakness and musculoskeletal manifestations are associated with IBD. An impaired nutritional status and a reduced physical activity can contribute to these clinical outcomes, impacting quality of life and increasing disability. This study aims to assess muscle strength and lower limb physical performance in female UC patients, taking into consideration disease activity, body composition and habitual physical activity. METHODS: A case-control study was performed including 23 UC female outpatients and 23 age- and BMI-matched healthy women as controls. Quadriceps strength (QS), handgrip strength (HGS), physical performance based measures (five repetitions sit-up test and 4meter gait speed test), body composition (bioelectrical impedance analysis, anthropometry), and habitual physical activity (HPA) levels were assessed. RESULTS: UC group had decreased QS (-6%; P=0.012), slower sit-up test (-32%; P=0.000), slower gait speed (-17% P=0.002) and decreased HPA level (-30%, P=0.001) compared with controls. No difference in HGS was observed between groups. Logistic regression showed that UC was an independent factor for decreased QS and slower sit-up test, while HPA was a protective factor for impaired gait speed. Multivariate linear regression showed that BMI was independently associated with an improved QS and slower sit-up test in the UC group. CONCLUSION: Women with UC had decreased lower limb strength and mobility limitations, which were associated with BMI and the level of physical activity. Early evaluation of nutritional status and performance of the lower limbs could identify UC patients with pre-clinical disability who may benefit from earlier health lifestyle modifications.},

   abstract = {Inflammatory bowel disease (IBD) is an abnormal inflammatory response within the gut to a trigger that has yet to be identified. The family history in many patients, especially those with Crohn's disease, suggests a genetic predisposition. It has been hypothesized that the abnormal inflammatory response is due in part to genetic alterations in the normal homeostatic processes that regulate host interactions with the normal gut microbes. Genetic studies have identified increasing numbers of genetic risk factors that involve a diverse series of pathways such as receptors of innate immune response, defects in epithelial barrier function, immune- and cytokine-related genes and genes involved in autophagy. Studies further suggest that abnormal immune responses in IBD patients are directed against the intestinal microbiota, with activation of both innate and adaptive immune responses. Indeed, studies have shown bacterial-derived antigen as drivers of T cell immune responses. More recently, Th17, regulatory T cells and unconventional innate-like T cells have been implicated in the induction and regulation of intestinal inflammation. The seminal discoveries of pathogen recognition receptors including Toll-like receptors and nucleotide-binding oligomerization domain receptors have changed our understanding of how immune cells respond to microbes and the role this may play in IBD pathogenesis. Understanding these mechanism will lead to new strategies in the treatment and prevention of IBD.},

   abstract = {INTRODUCTION: Cystic Fibrosis (CF), Ulcerative Colitis (UC), and Crohn's Disease (CD) manifest as various, multiple symptoms from malfunctioning and/or damaged gastrointestinal tract, which plague the patients. These symptoms result from the dysfunctional expression products of the specific mutations of the genes, which either manifest upon birth (CF) or later in life in immuno-genetically susceptible individuals as inflammatory bowel diseases (IBD). They all may potentially lead to malnutrition of the patients. Since only correcting the mutated genes, may cure these diseases permanently, the works on the future safe gene therapies continue vigorously. However, provision of the necessary nutrients to the suffering patients is the requirement for an effective, supportive care at present. In this realm, we have developed a model of the diseased gastrointestinal tract aimed to guide designing and testing various nutritional therapies. MATERIALS AND METHODS: It is well known that inflammatory bowel diseases induce crypts within the patients' gastrointestinal tract. Therefore, we have bioengineered, a novel, three-dimensional model of the gastrointestinal tract to evaluate the rheology of different types of nutrients. The model was assembled out of the bio-inert polymer tube with openings leading to vials of different shapes and sizes, as the simulation of the gastrointestinal tract altered by the diseases to contain multiple crypts. RESULTS AND CONCLUSIONS: The newly developed three-dimensional model effectively simulates the structure and functions of the gastrointestinal tract of the patients with mild and severe Ulcerative Colitis, Crohn's Disease, and Cystic Fibrosis. This model should allow us to design and test different nutritional supplements, with properties complementing the pathologically altered by the diseases functionalities of the patients' gastrointestinal tracts. Therefore, it should help us to design the effective supportive therapies; thus to prevent the patients' malnutrition.},

   abstract = {INTRODUCTION: Emerging evidence supports an immunologic role for 25-hydroxyvitamin D (25(OH)D) in inflammatory bowel disease (IBD). Here we examined if pretreatment vitamin D status influences durability of anti-tumor necrosis factor (TNF)-alpha therapy in patients with Crohn's disease (CD) or ulcerative colitis (UC). METHODS: All IBD patients who had plasma 25(OH)D level checked <3 months prior to initiating anti-TNF-alpha therapy were included in this retrospective single-center cohort study. Our main predictor variable was insufficient plasma 25(OH)D (<30 ng/mL). Cox proportional hazards model adjusting for potential confounders was used to identify the independent effect of pretreatment vitamin D on biologic treatment cessation. RESULTS: Our study included 101 IBD patients (74 CD; median disease duration 9 years). The median index 25(OH)D level was 27 ng/mL (interquartile range, 20-33 ng/mL). One-third of the patients had prior exposure to anti-TNF-alpha therapy. On multivariate analysis, patients with insufficient vitamin D demonstrated earlier cessation of anti-TNF-alpha therapy (hazard ratio [HR], 2.13; 95% confidence interval [CI], 1.03-4.39; P = .04). This effect was significant in patients who stopped treatment for loss of response (HR, 3.49; 95% CI, 1.34-9.09) and stronger for CD (HR, 2.38; 95% CI, 0.95-5.99) than UC (P = NS). CONCLUSIONS: Our findings suggest that vitamin D levels may influence durability of anti-TNF-alpha induction and maintenance therapy. Larger cohort studies and clinical trials of supplemental vitamin D use with disease activity as an end point may be warranted.},

   abstract = {OBJECTIVE: IBD is a group of complex, systemic disorders associated with intestinal inflammation and extraintestinal manifestations. Recent studies revealed Mendelian forms of IBD, which contributed significantly to our understanding of disease pathogenesis and the heritability of IBD. DESIGN: We performed exome sequencing in a family with Crohn's disease (CD) and severe autoimmunity, analysed immune cell phenotype and function in affected and non-affected individuals, and performed in silico and in vitro analyses of cytotoxic T lymphocyte-associated protein 4 (CTLA-4) structure and function. RESULTS: A novel missense variant was identified in CTLA4 encoding CTLA-4, a coinhibitory protein expressed by T cells and required for regulation of T cell activation. The residue affected by the mutation, CTLA-4 Tyr60, is evolutionarily highly conserved, and the identified Y60C variant is predicted to affect protein folding and structural stability and demonstrated to cause impaired CTLA-4 dimerisation and CD80 binding. Intestinal inflammation and autoimmunity in carriers of CTLA-4 Y60C exhibit incomplete penetrance with a spectrum of clinical presentations ranging from asymptomatic carrier status to fatal autoimmunity and intestinal inflammation. In a clinically affected CTLA-4 Y60C carrier, T cell proliferation was increased in vitro and associated with an increased ratio of memory to naive T cells in vivo, consistent with impaired regulation of T cell activation. CONCLUSIONS: Our results support the concept that variants in CTLA4 provide the basis for a novel Mendelian form of early-onset CD associated with systemic autoimmunity. Incomplete penetrance of autoimmunity further indicates the presence of other genetic and/or environmental modifiers.},

   abstract = {OBJECTIVE: To compare the induction of remission and cost-effectiveness of enteral nutrition (EN) and infliximab (IFX) in moderate-to-severe active Crohn's disease(CD). METHODS: Moderate-to-severe active CD patients were divided into IFX group and EN group. Remission rate, time to remission and treatment cost were compared between the two groups. Clinical remission was defined as Crohn's disease activity index (CDAI) < 150. The quality of life was evaluated by inflammatory bowel disease questionnaire of quality of life (IBDQ). RESULTS: A total of 100 patients were analyzed, including 48 patients in IFX group and 52 patients in EN group. IFX group had higher remission rate [87.5% (42/48) vs 67.3% (35/52) , P = 0.017] and shorter time to remission [(11.00 +/- 8.35) days vs (33.94 +/- 14.60) days, P < 0.001] than EN group. Treatment costs before remission were similar in two groups (P = 0.351) . The increase of IBDQ scores before and after treatment in IFX group was much higher than that of EN group (42.74 +/- 27.50 vs 7.57 +/- 22.77, P < 0.001) . Similarly, patients in EN group had greater increase of body mass index (BMI) than that of IFX group [(1.32 +/- 0.29)kg/m(2) vs (0.51 +/- 0.07) kg/m(2), P < 0.001]. For patients with CDAI < 280, remission rate was not significantly different [85.7% (24/28) vs 81.8% (18/22) , P = 0.718] between the two groups, while treatment cost in EN group was less than that of IFX group [(16.1 +/- 5.9)x10(3) RMB vs (22.9 +/- 11.9)x10(3) RMB, P = 0.021]. CONCLUSIONS: For patients with severe CD (CDAI >/= 280), IFX has higher remission rate, shorter time to remission and comparable treatment cost than EN. But for patients with CDAI < 280, EN group has comparable remission rate to IFX group with lower cost.},

   abstract = {BACKGROUND: Children with Crohn's disease (CD) may report abdominal pain despite clinical remission, suggesting that functional abdominal pain (FAP) may be playing a role. The aim of this study was to explore the presence and impact of FAP in children with CD in remission. METHODS: Children, aged 9 to 17 years, with CD were enrolled. Demographic information, the Pediatric Crohn's Disease Activity Index, and the Children's Depression Inventory were obtained. Disease remission was defined by physician global assessment, normal laboratories findings, absence of 3 or more stools a day, nocturnal stooling, bloody diarrhea, concurrent steroid therapy, strictures, or disease flare within 6 months. FAP was defined as patients with abdominal pain and CD remission. Rates of depression (Children's Depression Inventory >9) were compared. RESULTS: Of 307 children, 139 reported abdominal pain. Of this group, 18 of 139 (13%) children met the criteria for FAP. Despite clinical remission, 8 of 18 patients with CD having FAP were classified with active disease by Pediatric Crohn's Disease Activity Index. These patients had a higher rate of depression than patients with CD in remission with no abdominal pain (55.6% versus 29.9%; P = 0.03), similar to patients with abdominal pain from active CD (55.6% versus 44.8%; P = 0.62). CONCLUSIONS: A proportion of children with CD in remission have FAP. These children are at significant risk of depression. Future studies are needed to determine whether depression contributes to functional pain development or if pain itself leads to depression. Especially given that functional pain may exaggerate disease activity, clinicians caring for children with CD and FAP should consider evaluating for depressive disorders before escalating therapy.},

   abstract = {A 41-year-old woman was admitted with upper abdominal pain, vomiting and fever. Abdominal CT scan showed a colo-duodenal fistula with inflammatory thickening of the transverse colon. The patient's general health was poor because of hypoalbuminemia and coagulopathy. Endoscopy showed a fistula at the lower duodenal angle and the stomach was filled with refluxed stool. Ileostomy and percutaneous endoscopic gastrostomy were performed at that time and a double lumen gastro-jejunostomy inserted through the gastrostomy to allow both gastric drainage and distal enteral feeding. Nutrition support was gradually converted from parenteral to enteral feeding. Colonoscopy showed stenosis of the transverse colon with a colo-colonic fistula near the stenosis. Two months later, right hemi-colectomy and closure of the colo-duodenal fistula were performed. The resected specimen showed stenosis and a fistula in the transverse colon due to Crohn's disease. The colo-colonic fistula was present and the colo-duodenal fistula had almost closed due to fibrosis. The postoperative course was uneventful and the patient was discharged after administration of infliximab. Use of a double lumen gastro-jejunostomy tube was effective in improving the patient's general condition. This therapeutic strategy allowed the safe conduct of major resection in a high-risk patient.},
