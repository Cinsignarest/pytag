   abstract = {OBJECTIVES: Nonresponse or relapse of symptoms is common in patients with celiac disease treated with gluten free diet. Refractory sprue (RS) is defined as initial or subsequent failure of a strict gluten-free diet to restore normal intestinal architecture and function in patients who have celiac-like enteropathy. The aims of this study were: 1) to identify causes of persistent symptoms in patients referred with presumed diagnosis of nonresponsive celiac disease (NCD); and 2) to characterize patients with true RS. METHODS: Patients were identified who had been systematically evaluated for NCD between January 1997, and May 2001. Patient records and small bowel biopsy results were reviewed. RESULTS: A total of 55 patients were referred with a presumed diagnosis of NCD. Six did not have celiac disease and had other diseases responsible for their symptoms. Diarrhea, abdominal pain, and weight loss were the most common reasons for evaluation in cases of NCD, whereas weight loss, steatorrhea, and diarrhea were the most common presenting features of RS (nine patients). Of the 49 patients with celiac disease, 25 were identified as having gluten contamination. Additional diagnoses accounting for persistent symptoms included: pancreatic insufficiency, irritable bowel syndrome, bacterial overgrowth, lymphocytic colitis, collagenous colitis, ulcerative jejunitis, T-cell lymphoma, pancreatic cancer, fructose intolerance, protein losing enteropathy, cavitating lymphadenopathy syndrome, and tropical sprue. CONCLUSIONS: Based on this study, we conclude the following: 1) gluten contamination is the leading reason for NCD; 2) of NCD cases, 18% are due to RS; and 3) alternative diseases or those coexistent with celiac disease and gluten contamination should be ruled out before a diagnosis of RS is made.},

   abstract = {The provision of food is thought to promote the maintenance of gut integrity. Nutrients are able to elicit and affect both systemic and mucosal immune responses. Enteral diet therapy has long been known to be efficacious in inflammatory bowel disease (IBD), particularly in childhood Crohn's disease. However, the mechanisms of action of these diets are not clear. Nutritional repletion, direct effects on the gut mucosa or decreased intestinal permeability have all been postulated as being important in nutritional therapy. There is some evidence that the enteral diet has a direct effect on the gut mucosa by reducing cytokine production and the accompanying inflammation, thus leading to decreased intestinal permeability. Modifications of enteral diet composition have been evaluated in many studies. Such modifications include fat and/or protein content and the addition of bioactive peptides. The fatty acid composition of the enteral diet seems to have a much greater impact on its efficacy than modification of the N source. As specific fatty acids are precursors of inflammatory mediators derived from arachidonic acid, the reduction in these components may be beneficial in nutritional therapy for IBD. Addition of bioactive peptides to enteral diet formulas may also have a role; such peptides may have specific growth factor or anti-inflammatory actions. There is still much work to be done to define disease-specific enteral diet formulas that are effective as therapies for both Crohn's disease and ulcerative colitis.},

However, the precise mechanisms responsible for these effects are still under investigation. On the other hand, it has been suggested that bile salts in the gut lumen play an important role in the integrity of the intestinal mucosa. The aim of the present study was to investigate the ability of GBF to adsorb bile salts in vitro. METHODS: The binding capacities of GBF, enzymatically digested GBF (GBF-fiber), and alpha-cellulose for unconjugated and conjugated bile salts were measured using Langmuir's method. The morphology of these fibers was observed by light and fluorescence microscopy. RESULTS: GBF adsorbed bile salts very strongly, especially hydrophobic bile salts. Even after enzymatic digestion, the GBF fiber still exhibited strong binding capacity, whereas alpha-cellulose exhibited very low binding capacity. Microscopically, GBF consists mainly of aleurone, a lattice-like cell wall with cytoplasm enclosed. After enzymatic digestion, the cytoplasm was also digested. CONCLUSION: GBF possesses a great capacity to adsorb bile salts. This may be part of the mechanism for the therapeutic effects of GBF in UC patients.},

Immunologic, environmental, infective and genetic factors equally can play role in their development. Antibodies to an oligomannose epitope of the Saccharomyces cerevisiae demonstrated in 60-70% of the patients with Crohn's disease. The origin and the clinicopathological role are not clarified. It is important that there are no surveys with patients suffering in gluten sensitive enteropathy in the literature. As there are no ASCA survey in Hungary, the aim of this study was to determine the prevalence of the ASCA. The authors examined at their patients the ASCA's occurrence and compared with the clinical picture of the Crohn's disease. The results supported the theory that ASCA positivity correlates with small intestines' Crohn's disease and in these cases both the IgG and IgA type antibodies proved. The antibodies in the sera at the analyzed ASCA positive cases prove a systemic immune response against Saccharomyces cerevisiae and the authors suggest the end of the oral tolerance against the yeast's antigens. The diet restriction (elemental diet, total parenteral nutrition, and fecal diversion) may ameliorate the status of the patients with Crohn's disease. It is speculated that the yeast-free diet as a part of the therapy for the ASCA positive patients can be reasonable: moreover the permanent "forbidding" of the yeast can be an acceptable alternative in case of getting well.},

The reasons for the discrepancies in the findings could be related to the different study designs, different treatments, overlapping of treatment effects, as well as the variety of treatment formulations and doses used, which have led to results that are, in certain instances, very difficult to explain. Emphasis on a treatment formulation which reduces the incidence of side effects, together with careful selection of patients and experimental design, seems to be associated with benefits, and these studies point to the therapeutic potential for these lipids in the therapy of IBD. It is possible that these fatty acids act by reducing low-grade active inflammation rather than by preventing reinitiation of the inflammatory process from a truly quiescent state. Whether this treatment is applicable to all IBD patients has not been fully elucidated. Nevertheless, taken together, all these studies suggest the effectiveness of these new therapeutic approaches, not only when conventional treatment fails or when it is not possible to treat chronically, but also, in some instances, as first choice.},

Several papers consider whether flat adenomas with high malignant potential are as common in the West as in Japan. Clinical series indicate that signs of rectal bleeding are more predictive of colorectal cancer than gastrointestinal symptoms. Colonoscopy is more accurate than double-contrast barium enema for detecting polyps, and virtual colonoscopy is a promising new diagnostic and screening technique. Primary prevention dietary studies using adenoma recurrence as an end point yield negative results. Surveillance colonoscopy protects individuals in families with hereditary nonpolyposis colorectal cancer, but gastroenterologists continue to perform cancer surveillance in patients with ulcerative colitis in an inconsistent manner. Screening for colorectal neoplasia with fecal occult blood tests and flexible sigmoidoscopy is being better defined and promoted, although many now advocate direct colonoscopy screening based on increasing indirect evidence of efficacy. Better methods of treating large sessile neoplasms are being developed and evaluated, and follow-up surveillance for adenoma patients increasingly is being tailored to individual patient risk.},

   abstract = {Inflammatory bowel disease (IBD) comprises two chronic, tissue-destructive, clinical entities Crohn disease (CD) and ulcerative colitis (UC) both apparently caused by immunological overreaction (hypersensitivity) to commensal gut bacteria. Under normal conditions the intestinal immune system shows a down-regulating tone ('oral tolerance') against dietary antigens and the indigenous microbiota. This local homeostasis is disturbed in IBD, leading to hyperactivation of T helper 1 (Th1) cells with abundant secretion of interferon-gamma and tumor necrosis factor (TNF) and production of IgG antibodies against commensal bacteria. In addition, UC includes genetically determined autoimmunity, particularly IgG1-mediated cytotoxic epithelial attack. Breaching of the epithelium is the best-defined event underlying abrogation of oral tolerance, but immune deviation caused by cytokines fiom irritated epithelial cells or subepithelial elements (for example, mast cells, natural killer cells, macrophages) may also be involved. Endogenous infection with local hypersensitivity likewise causes periodontal disease, reflecting 'frustrated' immune elimination mechanisms entertained by antigens from dental plaque. Altogether, perturbation of a tightly controlled cytokine network, with abnormal crosstalk between several cell types, apparently explains the progressive immunopathology of chronic inflammatory mucosal diseases in general. This adverse development will be influenced by numerous immunity genes, the dosage and potential pathogeniciy of commensal bacteria, general health, nutritional status, and psychological factors. Several targets for new therapy have tentatively been identified to block immunopathological mechanisms in IBD, and inhibition of TNF has a striking beneficial effect in CD, supporting a central role of this cytokine.},

We describe a minilaparotomy technique for restorative proctocolectomy and compare recovery parameters with a laparoscopic procedure. METHODS: A consecutive series of patients undergoing laparoscopic-assisted restorative proctocolectomy were compared with a subsequent consecutive series of patients undergoing a minilaparotomy procedure. This method incorporates a suprapubic incision. Mobilization of the colon is performed in the usual manner with visualization of less accessible areas made possible by using an illuminated St. Mark's retractor. Operative and recovery parameters were analyzed for each group retrospectively. RESULTS: Twenty-five patients were compared (12 in the laparoscopic group). Wound length was significantly longer in the open group (median, 14 vs. 8.5 cm; P < 0.01), but operative times were shorter (median, 120 vs. 150 minutes; P < 0.01). There were no differences in any of the recovery parameters analyzed, including analgesic requirements, time to ileostomy function, first fluid intake, time to solid diet, length of hospital stay, and complications. CONCLUSION: The only advantage of a laparoscopic-assisted procedure over a minilaparotomy technique was the size of the wound. The minilaparotomy restorative proctocolectomy achieves the same postoperative recovery parameters and has a shorter operative time. This technique is recommended for surgeons less experienced in laparoscopy.},

   abstract = {Ulcerative colitis and Crohn's disease (together known as Inflammatory Bowel Disease or IBD) are both associated with increased risk for colorectal cancer. Although it is conventional to emphasise differences between IBD-associated and sporadic colon cancer, such as a lower rate of Adenomatosis Polyposis Coli mutations and earlier p53 mutations, IBD-associated cancer has a similar dysplasia-cancer sequence to sporadic colon cancer, similar frequencies of major chromosomal abnormalities and of microsatellite instability and similar glycosylation changes. This suggests that IBD-associated colon cancer and sporadic colon cancer might have similar pathogenic mechanisms. Because the normal colon is arguably in a continual state of low-grade inflammation in response to its microbial flora, it is reasonable to suggest that both IBD-associated and sporadic colon cancer may be the consequence of bacteria-induced inflammation. We have speculated that the glycosylation changes might result in recruitment to the mucosa of bacterial and dietary lectins that might otherwise pass harmlessly though the gut lumen. These could then lead to increased inflammation and/or proliferation and thence to ulceration or cancer. The glycosylation changes include increased expression of onco-fetal carbohydrates, such as the galactose-terminated Thomsen-Friedenreich antigen (Gal beta1,3GalNAc alpha-), increased sialylation of terminal structures and reduced sulphation. These changes cannot readily be explained by alterations in glycosyltransferase activity but similar changes can be induced in vitro by alkalinisation of the Golgi lumen. Consequences of these changes may be relevant not only for cell-surface glycoconjugates but also for intracellular glycoconjugates.},

Seventy-four adult male Wistar rats were randomized into six groups, five of which had acetic acid-induced colitis. The animals received a fat-free diet and water ad libitum in individual metabolic cages. By a central venous catheter, saline was infused (0.5 ml/h) into the control groups CS (without colitis) and CC (with colitis), while the test groups received specific LE for 7 days. The n-3/n-6 FA ratio and the lipidic compositions regarding long chain (LCT) and medium chain (MCT) triglycerides were: group L--1:7.7 (LCT, n = 12), M--1:7.0 (MCT and LCT, n = 12), LW-3--1:4.5 (LCT plus n-3 FA, n = 12) and MW-3--1:3.0 (MCT and LCT plus n-3 FA, n = 13). The frequency of diarrhea, oral intake/body weight ratio, intestinal alterations, macrophage cellularity were evaluated and colonic concentrations of leukotrienes (LTB4, LTC4), prostaglandins (PGE2) and thromboxanes (TXB2) were measured. Groups M, MW-3 and LW-3 had less diarrhea than the CC group (P<0.05). Average oral intake/body weight ratio in MW-3 animals was comparable to the CS and better than the CC group. n-3 FA treated rats (LW-3 and MW-3) presented less intestinal inflammatory alterations than CC rats. Mucosal ulcer formation in MW-3 group did not differ from CS rats. M and MW-3 rats had less macrophages in the colon than the CC group. Compared with CC group, lower concentrations of LTB4 in the CS, LW-3 and MW-3 groups; of PGE2 in the CS, M and MW-3 groups; and of TXB2 in the CS and MW-3 groups were found. Mean concentrations of LTC4 did not differ among the groups. Thus, a LCT-containing LE with a low n-3-n-6 ratio does not modify inflammatory colitis manifestations; LE with a high n-3-n-6 ratio reduces diarrhea, preserves oral intake-weight ratio, attenuates morphological consequences and decreases colonic concentrations of inflammatory mediators; MCT/LCT-containing LE with 1:3 n-3-n-6 ratio exerts the most profound beneficial impact on the inflammatory response.},

   abstract = {Inflammatory Bowel Diseases - ulcerative colitis and Crohn's disease- are chronic gastrointestinal inflammatory diseases of unknown etiology. Decreased oral intake, malabsorption, accelerated nutrient losses, increased requirements, and drug-nutrient interactions cause nutritional and functional deficiencies that require proper correction by nutritional therapy. The goals of the different forms of nutritional therapy are to correct nutritional disturbances and to modulate inflammatory response, thus influencing disease activity. Total parenteral nutrition has been used to correct and to prevent nutritional disturbances and to promote bowel rest during active disease, mainly in cases of digestive fistulae with high output. Its use should be reserved for patients who cannot tolerate enteral nutrition. Enteral nutrition is effective in inducing clinical remission in adults and promoting growth in children. Due to its low complication rate and lower costs, enteral nutrition should be preferred over total parenteral nutrition whenever possible. Both present equal effectiveness in primary therapy for remission of active Crohn's disease. Nutritional intervention may improve outcome in certain individuals; however, because of the costs and complications of such therapy, careful selection is warranted, especially in patients presumed to need total parenteral nutrition. Recent research has focused on the use of nutrients as primary treatment agents. Immunonutrition is an important therapeutic alternative in the management of inflammatory bowel diseases, modulating the inflammation and changing the eicosanoid synthesis profile. However, beneficial reported effects have yet to be translated into the clinical practice. The real efficacy of these and other nutrients (glutamine, short-chain fatty acids, antioxidants) still need further evaluation through prospective and randomized trials.},

Second, rats with dextran sulphate sodium-induced colitis were supplemented with iron 0.3%/kg diet and compared with rats on dextran sulphate sodium and regular diet. The body weight change, histological scores, colon length, rectal bleeding, plasma and colonic lipid peroxides, colonic glutathione peroxidase and plasma vitamin E and C were measured. Faecal analysis for haem and total, free and ethylenediaminetetra-acetic acid-chelatable iron was also performed. RESULTS: Iron 3% and iron 0.3% increased the activity of dextran sulphate sodium-induced colitis, as demonstrated by higher histological scores, heavier rectal bleeding and further shortening of the colon. This was associated with increased lipid peroxidation and decreased antioxidant vitamins. Faecal iron available to the Fenton reaction was increased in a dose-dependent manner. CONCLUSIONS: Iron supplementation taken orally enhanced the activity of dextran sulphate sodium-induced colitis and is associated with an increase in oxidative stress.},

   abstract = {Growth failure (GF) is one of the major complications affecting children with inflammatory bowel disease. The faltering is temporary in 40-50% of cases and prolonged in 10-20% in Crohn's disease (CD). Such failure is rare in children with ulcerative colitis (5%). This complication is often associated with retarded bone development and delayed onset of sexual maturation. The delayed linear growth has a variety of causes including insufficient intake due to anorexia and the inflammatory process with increased energy and protein expenditure. Other factors are increased intestinal loss, secondary hypopituitarism and treatment with steroids. Therapeutic strategies of CD in children have changed this last decade by introducing new therapeutic agents such as topic steroids, immunosuppressors, anti-TNF (antibody and notably in children enteral nutrition which has shown its efficacy in inducing remissions of active CD, restoring nutritional status and stimulation of linear growth. The results of a recent prospective multicentric study over 2 years in 82 CD show that severe GF (-2 SD) is initially present in 15% (n = 12), among them 11 remain < -2SD after 2 years of follow-up. Six patients who were on the normal range initially increased their GF during the follow-up (< -2SD) (total 21% < -2SD (n = 17) at 2 years). At inclusion in this group there was no difference in growth velocity, used of steroids, enteral nutrition or severity of CD as compared to the group with no GF. It suggests that new treatment strategy should be developed in the future for this specific complication of paediatric CD.},

   abstract = {PURPOSE: Although functional results after ileal pouch-anal anastomosis are excellent, imperfections of function do occur. In this setting, quality-of-life assessment is an invaluable tool in determining overall therapeutic efficacy. We evaluated the impact of dietary restrictions, preoperative diagnosis (ulcerative colitis vs. familial adenomatous polyposis), and pregnancy (after pouch insertion) on quality of life. METHODS: After ethical approval, 64 patients were reviewed (mean age, 31 (range, 15-54) years). Long-term quality of life in patients after ileal pouch-anal anastomosis was assessed using the Cleveland Global Quality of Life instrument or Fazio score. The Cleveland Global Quality of Life score is a novel quality-of-life instrument specifically designed for patients with ileal pouches. Stool frequency and continence were recorded to establish the functional status of this group. RESULTS: Sixty-one patients (95.3 percent) complained of some form of dietary restriction and adopted a fixed dietary regimen. All such patients felt that a breach of this regimen would impinge significantly on their quality of life. Late eating and alcohol were associated with diarrhea, whereas smoking was not. Constipation was infrequently reported. The mean Cleveland Global Quality of Life score of patients with ulcerative colitis (0.81 +/- 0.13) was greater than that of patients with ulcerative colitis and a background of pouchitis (0.78 +/- 0.16; P = 0.042). Whereas postoperative stool frequency in patients with familial adenomatous polyposis was always higher than the preoperative level (4 vs. 2 movements per day; P = 0.04), the Cleveland Global Quality of Life score of this group was lower than that of ulcerative colitis patients (0.77 vs. 0.81; P = 0.047). The Cleveland Global Quality of Life score of females who had had pregnancies after pouch formation was 0.70, significantly lower (P = 0.039) than that of ulcerative colitis patients, although pouch function was similar to the general group (7 vs. 6 daily bowel movements with full continence in all parous patients). CONCLUSIONS: Most patients suffered dietary restrictions, forcing them to adopt a fixed dietary regimen. Breach of this regimen would impact on their quality of life. Hence composition of diet and timing of intake are important determinants of quality of life after ileal pouch formation. Patients with familial adenomatous polyposis and those with a history of pouchitis had poorer Cleveland Global Quality of Life scores than ulcerative colitis patients without a background of pouchitis. This indicates that they also had poorer quality of life. Parous patients had the lowest Cleveland Global Quality of Life scores, indicating the poorest quality of life. These differences did not correlate with poorer pouch function, highlighting the influence of non-pouch-related factors in quality of life after ileal pouch formation.},

   abstract = {BACKGROUND: Oxidative stress is believed to play a key role in the pathogenesis of inflammatory bowel disease (IBD)-related intestinal damage. Circulating antioxidants may have a role to play in preventing free radical-mediated tissue injury. METHODS: Plasma vitamin A, E and carotenoid concentrations, leukocytic genomic damage and 8-hydroxy-deoxy-guanosine (8-OHdG) concentration were determined in 46 ulcerative colitis (UC) patients, 37 Crohn disease (CD) patients and 386 controls. A 20 ml blood sample was taken from each subject for antioxidant and 8-OHdG measurements. A food frequency questionnaire was administered to a sample of subjects from each group to evaluate daily intake of dietary compounds. RESULTS: Antioxidant concentration was significantly reduced in IBD patients, particularly in those with active disease, with respect to controls (P < 0.0001). 8-OHdG concentrations were significantly increased in IBD patients compared to controls, independent of disease activity (P < 0.05). No correlation was found between antioxidant and 8-OHdG concentrations. Carotenoid concentrations were significantly reduced in malnourished IBD patients (0.89 +/- 0.14 micromol/l) compared to patients with normal or high body mass index (1.83 +/- 0.12 micromol/l; P < 0.05), independent of disease activity or extension. Protein, fruit and vegetable intakes of IBD patients were significantly lower than those of controls. CONCLUSIONS: Depletion of antioxidants is likely to be important in the pathophysiology of IBD: UC and CD patients show increased free radical peripheral leukocyte DNA damage and decreased plasma antioxidant defenses. These results indicate the necessity of further studies to establish whether optimal vitamin status may improve the clinical course of UC and CD.},

It is essential to provide an accurate diagnosis in children suspected of IBD, as the initial treatment of Crohn disease and ulcerative colitis in children is not the same as it is in adults. While the role of enteral feeding in the treatment of Crohn disease in adults continues to be controversial, there is firm evidence to support the use of enteral feeding as primary therapy for Crohn disease in children. Nutrition is improved by enteral feeding, and growth and pubertal development are promoted, while the systemic toxicity of corticosteroid therapy is avoided. Supplementary nocturnal enteral nutrition (with daytime intake of normal diet) after primary therapy and remission induction may be associated with the prolongation of remission. Drug treatment in children with IBD is characterized by a lack of evidence from controlled trials.},

   abstract = {Inflammatory bowel disease (IBD) still presents major challenges to the understanding of its cause, mechanisms of inflammation, and therapeutic choices to control the damaged tissue. Both types of IBD, ulcerative colitis and Crohn's disease, have been known and investigated for over half century but neither one is fully understood nor can be satisfactorily managed. While many gaps in our knowledge still exist, the last two decades have witnessed an unprecedented progress not only in the etiology but mainly in the mechanisms underlying the chronic inflammatory response. The pattern of IBD epidemiology has drastically changed since World War II, with an increased frequency in countries that have adopted a ''westernized'' life style. A parallel and important phenomenon is the continuous drop in age of onset in children. Unfortunately, only few epidemiological clues are available, with the exception of smoking and diet. What in smoking alters the course of IBD is still a mystery and which, among thousands of additives, could represent a risk factor will remain unknown for the foreseeable future. The current emphasis on the study of the enteric flora as the source of potential antigens against which the mucosal immune system reacts appear well justified. The data from animal models appears particularly convincing. Thus, after decades of relying almost exclusively on patient-derived information, numerous animal models are generating precious new information on IBD pathogenesis. In experimental IBD the genetic background of the animal markedly influences the course of the disease, and the same is probably true in humans. The identification of NOD2 as the first mutated gene associated with a subgroup of Crohn's disease patients is the first evidence that genetics are pointing to the right direction for understanding how the environment interacts with genes to cause IBD. For many years immunology has been the main source of scientific information on mechanisms of IBD. Cytokines, chemokines and other soluble factors dominate immunological studies aimed at understanding how different anti-inflammatory and pro-inflammatory mediators are improperly regulated and how immune imbalance can be restored. The extent to which T-cells live or die is also a key determinant of chronicity. In addition to classical immune cells, epithelial, endothelial, mesenchymal and nerve cells are slowly gaining more importance in IBD pathogenesis, as they contribute to the ultimate fate of tissue damage. Medical and surgical therapies are vastly better now that they were only a couple of decades ago, but they are still far from satisfactory. Steroid and aminosalicylates are still the most common drugs after 60 years of use, and it is time to renovate our therapeutic approach to a more effective one. The value of biologicals has been highlighted by the recent success of anti-TNF therapy. Timing of therapy must also change. The concept of the step-by-step approach is slowly fading away, and the idea of an ''all-out'' approach with multiple concomitant drugs early in the disease is gaining credibility. New reports on early aggressive therapies, and the demonstration that early and late experimental IBD are caused by different mechanisms are changing the way we think about managing IBD. Both ulcerative colitis and Crohn's disease will continue to challenge the medical establishment for year to come, but the possibility that IBD can be conquered is more realistic now that never before.},

   abstract = {Probiotic ingestion can be recommended as a preventative approach to maintaining the balance of the intestinal microflora and thereby enhance 'well-being'. Research into the use of probiotic intervention in specific illnesses and disorders has identified certain patient populations that may benefit from the approach. Undoubtedly, probiotics will vary in their efficacy and it may not be the case that the same results occur with all species. Those that prove most efficient will likely be strains that are robust enough to survive the harsh physico-chemical conditions present in the gastrointestinal tract. This includes gastric acid, bile secretions and competition with the resident microflora. A survey of the literature indicates positive results in over fifty human trials, with prevention/treatment of infections the most frequently reported output. In theory, increased levels of probiotics may induce a 'barrier' influence against common pathogens. Mechanisms of effect are likely to include the excretion of acids (lactate, acetate), competition for nutrients and gut receptor sites, immunomodulation and the formation of specific antimicrobial agents. As such, persons susceptible to diarrhoeal infections may benefit greatly from probiotic intake. On a more chronic basis, it has been suggested that some probiotics can help maintain remission in the inflammatory conditions, ulcerative colitis and pouchitis. They have also been suggested to repress enzymes responsible for genotoxin formation. Moreover, studies have suggested that probiotics are as effective as anti-spasmodic drugs in the alleviation of irritable bowel syndrome. The approach of modulating the gut flora for improved health has much relevance for the management of those with acute and chronic gut disorders. Other target groups could include those susceptible to nosocomial infections, as well as the elderly, who have an altered microflora, with a decreased number of beneficial microbial species. For the future, it is imperative that mechanistic interactions involved in probiotic supplementation be identified. Moreover, the survival issues associated with their establishment in the competitive gut ecosystem should be addressed. Here, the use of prebiotics in association with useful probiotics may be a worthwhile approach. A prebiotic is a dietary carbohydrate selectively metabolised by probiotics. Combinations of probiotics and prebiotics are known as synbiotics.},

   abstract = {There is increasing evidence that intestinal microflora play an important role in the pathogenesis of ulcerative colitis. Therefore, modification of the microflora by prebiotics, probiotics, and antibiotics may be a rational approach for controlling intestinal inflammation. Germinated barley food-stuff (GBF) is an insoluble mixture of glutamine-rich protein and hemicellulose-rich dietary fiber. GBF is utilized efficiently by Bifidobacterium, Lactobacillus, and Eubacterium and converted by them into lactate, acetate, and butyrate. These bacterial organic acids preserve a favorable intestinal condition. We have previously shown that GBF has attenuated intestinal inflammation in patients with ulcerative colitis and experimental colitis models through prebiotic actions. The aim of this study was to compare the effect of GBF with that of probiotics and antibiotics in an experimental colitis model. Colitis was induced by feeding male SD rats with a diet containing 3.0-3.5% dextran sodium sulfate (DSS). The therapeutic effect of oral administration of a prebiotic (GBF), probiotics (mixture of Lactobacillus and Clostridium butyricum), antibiotics (vancomycin, metronidazole), and the vehicle was determined by assessing clinical and pathological scores on day 6 after initiation of colitis. Butyrate concentrations in the cecal content were also determined. GBF treatment significantly reduced colonic inflammation as assessed by clinical scores with an increase in cecal butyrate levels. Probiotic treatment with a mixture of Lactobacillus and Clostridium butyricum did not show such an effect. Both antibiotic treatments significantly attenuated clinical and pathological scores. However, in contrast to GBF, this treatment led to a significant decrease in cecal butyrate levels. These data suggest that modification of the intestinal microflora by prebiotics, including GBF, may serve as a useful adjunct in the treatment of ulcerative colitis as well as antibiotic treatment.},

   abstract = {BACKGROUND: Crohn's disease and ulcerative colitis are chronic inflammatory bowel diseases of unknown etiology. Unspecific immunosuppressive therapy represents current standard treatment and is often associated with severe side effects. Several treatment regimens have been evaluated to identify alternative therapeutic options. Among these different diet therapies were investigated. Objective of this paper is to review the results of diet therapy in chronic inflammatory bowel disease on the basis of randomised controlled trials and meta-analysis of randomised controlled trials. METHODS: Medline and Cochrane Library were searched for meta-analysis and randomised controlled trials investigating this question. Additionally reference lists of identified articles and text books were checked for further trials. RESULTS: Four meta-analyses investigated the treatment of acute Crohn's disease with elemental-, semi-elemental-, and polymeric diets in comparison to corticosteroids or to another form of enteral diet. All meta-analyses show a superiority of corticosteroids and no difference in the effect of the compared enteral diets. Randomised controlled trials investigating diet therapy in ulcerative colitis have not been summarised in a meta-analysis yet. Eleven randomised trials were identified which evaluated diets in ulcerative colitis patients: Dietary supplementation with n-3-fatty acids (6 trials), elemental diet [2], dietary supplementation with dietary fiber [1], elimination diet [1], and dietary supplementation with olestra [1]. Only for the elimination diet a significant positive effect on the course of disease was found in one trial which investigated only 18 patients. CONCLUSIONS: Enteral nutritional therapy of acute Crohn's disease is less effective than treatment with corticosteroids. In case of severe steroid induced side effects diet treatment can present a promising alternative. Superiority of one of the investigated different formulations was not found. Meta-analyses of randomised trials provide a clear and easy to understand presentation of the effect of this intervention. Eleven published trials investigating the effect of diets in ulcerative colitis show only for elimination diet a positive treatment effect. The trials do find a positive effect of one of the other interventions but the trials are very small and cannot exclude a treatment effect. Meta-analysis of these trials would be helpful for a better presentation and understanding of these results.},

In the past year significant work has been published examining the mechanisms of impaired food intake in animal models of inflammatory bowel disease, which allow a better understanding of these processes. Data from the same laboratory have shed further light on the relative role of underfeeding and inflammation on the growth retardation associated with intestinal inflammation. Other studies have provided further data on the risk factors and predictive biomarkers of bone loss in patients with inflammatory bowel disease. The potential role of enteral nutrition as primary therapy for Crohn's disease is particularly addressed in this review. Recent contributions to the field emphasized the special importance of this modality of therapy in paediatric patients. The possible mechanisms for such a therapeutic action are not well understood. Other nutrients may have a therapeutic potential in inflammatory bowel disease. In particular, recent data on the in-vivo anti-inflammatory actions of butyrate merit special mention. Finally, novel nutritional therapeutic strategies for inflammatory bowel disease, such as transforming growth factor-beta2-enriched enteral feeding, or hydrothermally processed cereals have recently been explored.},

   abstract = {Inflammation is overall a protective response, whose main goal is to liberate the human being of cellular lesions caused by micro-organisms, toxins, allergens, etc., as well as its consequences, and of death cells and necrotic tissues. Chronic inflammation, which is detrimental to tissues, is the basic pathogenic mechanism of hypersensitivity reactions against xenobiotics. Other frequent pathologies, for instance atherosclerosis, chronic hepatitis, inflammatory bowel disease (IBD), liver cirrhosis, lung fibrosis, psoriasis, and rheumatoid arthritis are also chronic inflammatory diseases. Chemical mediators of inflammation are derived from blood plasma or different cell-type activity. Biogenic amines, eicosanoids and cytokines are within the most important mediators of inflammatory processes. The different activities of eicosanoids derived from arachidonic acid (20:4 n-6) versus those derived from eicosapentaenoic acid (20:5 n-3) are one of the most important mechanisms to explain why n-3, or omega-3, polyunsaturated fatty acids (PUFA) exhibit anti-inflammatory properties in many inflammatory diseases. Dietary supplements ranging 1-8 g per day of n-3 PUFA have been reportedly beneficial in the treatment of IBD, eczema, psoriasis and rheumatoid arthritis. In addition, recent experimental studies in rats with experimental ulcerative colitis, induced by intrarectal injection of trinitrobenzene sulphonic acid, have documented that treatment with n-3 long-chain PUFA reduces mucosal damage as assessed by biochemical and histological markers of inflammation. Moreover, the defence antioxidant system in this model is enhanced in treated animals, provided that the n-3 PUFA supply is adequately preserved from oxidation.},

   abstract = {Modifying the diet can have a favorable impact on the course of chronic inflammatory bowel disease. In contrast, nutrition plays no major role in the development of the disease or in provoking an acute attack. During an acute attack of Crohn's disease, the application of oral (drinks) or tube feeding (enteral nutrition) can result in a substantial clinical improvement. The remission rate of this side effect-free therapy is, however, lower than that seen with steroids. The data available for diet therapy in ulcerative colitis are less unequivocal, but the effects are probably slight at best. During the remission phase, the patient should eat a balanced, vitamin-rich and varied normal diet that excludes all poorly tolerated foods: lactose intolerance in particular appears to be increased in patients with Crohn's disease. Known vitamin or mineral deficiencies should be corrected by appropriate dietary measures or supplementation. There is no such thing as a "Crohn's diet" or "colitis diet". The patient can be allowed to eat anything that is tolerated.},

Stable, therapeutic international normalized ratios (INRs) were obtained with warfarin 35 mg/week during a 6-week postpartum course to treat an initial DVT. Ten days after completing warfarin therapy, azathioprine was begun. A recurrent DVT occurred 9 days later, and an increase in warfarin dosage to 120 mg/week was necessary to achieve an INR of 2.0-3.0. The patient denied changes in warfarin adherence, dietary vitamin K intake, or medical conditions. The addition of azathioprine was the only change in her regimen. Review of the literature found only limited reports of an interaction between warfarin and azathioprine, with increases in warfarin requirements of 3-4 times. Careful monitoring and caution are recommended when administering these two drugs concomitantly.},

   abstract = {OBJECTIVES: We examined the use of complementary alternative medicine (CAM) in children and young adults with inflammatory bowel disease. METHODS: After validation of a questionnaire and completion of a pilot survey, children and young adults with inflammatory bowel disease were enrolled in three centers of pediatric gastroenterology (Boston, Detroit, and London). RESULTS: Two hundred eight questionnaires were completed in total (Boston, 120; Detroit, 37; London, 51). Ages ranged from 3.8 to 23.0 yr, 58% were male, 57% had Crohn's disease, and 35% had ulcerative colitis. The frequency of CAM use was 41%. The most common CAMs were megavitamin therapy (19%), dietary supplements (17%), and herbal medicine (14%). Parental CAM use and the number of adverse effects from conventional medicines were predictors of CAM use (odds ratio = 1.9, 95% CI = 1.2-3.1, p = 0.02; odds ratio = 1.3, 95% CI = 1.2-1.5, p < 0.001, respectively). The most important reasons respondents gave for using CAM were side effects from prescribed medicines, prescribed medicines not working as well as they had hoped, and hoping for a cure. Fifty-nine percent of respondents not taking CAM were interested in learning more about it. CONCLUSIONS: In our survey over 40% of children with chronic inflammatory bowel disease used complementary medicine in addition to conventional therapies. Parental CAM use and number of adverse effects from conventional therapies were the only independent predictors of CAM use. Some complementary therapies have potential for adverse effects and for drug interactions with conventional treatments. Physicians should take a thorough history of CAM use in children with chronic inflammatory bowel disease.},

   abstract = {BACKGROUND AND AIMS: Germinated barley foodstuff (GBF) contains protein and insoluble dietary fiber. We have previously shown in ulcerative colitis patients and a colitis model that GBF feeding attenuates mucosal damage by increasing luminal butyrate levels. However, the detailed mechanism remains unclear because of its heterogeneous nature. The present study was carried out to: (i) evaluate the active ingredient in GBF; and (ii) examine its effect on the repair process in colonic inflammation by using a dextran sulfate sodium (DSS) colitis model. METHODS: Colitis was induced by feeding a diet containing 0.5-3.5% DSS to male Sprague-Dawley rats. (i) Active ingredient: GBF was fractionated enzymatically into fiber- and protein-rich fractions. Each fraction was administered to DSS-colitis rats. Clinical signs, cecal short chain fatty acid concentrations and serum alpha1-acid glycoprotein (AAG) levels were determined. (ii) Effect on mucosal repair: GBF with or without salazosulfapyridine (SASP), or SASP alone was administered to rats after the onset of colitis. Seven days after initial treatment, the number of epithelial cells in HE sections was evaluated morphologically in a blind fashion and serum AAG was determined. RESULTS: (i) Germinate barley foodstuff and GBF-fiber significantly attenuated the clinical signs of colitis and decreased serum AAG levels, with a significant increase in cecal butyrate production, while GBF-protein did not. (ii) Treatment with GBF alone and GBF plus SASP significantly accelerated colonic epithelial repair and improved clinical signs. CONCLUSIONS: These findings suggest that the fiber fraction of GBF may effectively enhance luminal butyrate production, and thereby accelerate colonic epithelial repair in colitis.},

   abstract = {A germinated barley foodstuff (GBF) contained glutamine-rich protein and the hemicellulose-rich fiber was made from brewer's spent grain by physical isolation (milling and sieving). Both in vivo and in vitro studies demonstrated that the fiber fraction of GBF supports maintenance of epithelial cell populations, facilitates epithelial repair, and suppresses epithelial nuclear factor kappa B-DNA binding activity through generating increased short-chain fatty acid (especially butyrate) production by luminal microflora which includes Bifidobacterium and Eubacterium, thereby preventing experimental colonic injury. The fiber fraction also modulates stool water content by its high water-holding capacity. The protein fraction which contains larger glutamine prevents experimental small bowel injury. Based on these observations, clinical studies were initiated in patients with mild to moderate active ulcerative colitis. The patients who had been unresponsive to or intolerant of standard treatment received 30 grams of GBF feeding daily in a nonrandomized, open-label fashion. At 4 weeks, this treatment resulted in a significant clinical and endoscopic improvement independent of disease extent. The improvement was associated with an increase in stool butyrate concentrations and in luminal Bifidobacterium and Eubacterium levels. After the end of GBF treatment the patients had an exacerbation of the disease. GBF was safe and well tolerated. These results indicate that GBF feeding is a potentially attractive treatment in patients with ulcerative colitis.},

Since GBF contains a poorly digested protein fraction, this protein may be transferred to and absorbed in the colon. It may therefore be possible to detect the GBF antigen in colitis patients with dysfunctional colonic mucosal barrier defense. In this study, the antigenic potency of GBF was examined in vivo and in vitro. Using the AOAC method, the indigestible fraction of GBF (dietary fiber) was obtained, and the poorly digested protein fraction in GBF was determined. Using Sprague Dawley rats with chronic colitis induced by dextran sulfate sodium (DSS, 2.5% in diet), a GBF and control diet were administered, and total and specific serum immunoglobulin E (IgE) against intestinal contents and the soluble GBF protein were determined. In addition, reactivity between serum and intestinal content were examined by gel electrophoresis mobility shift assay (EMSA). GBF showed relatively low protein digestibility (47%) because of its low solubility in neutral pH. Total serum IgE in both dietary groups was not significantly different, and specific IgE antibodies against intestinal contents and the soluble GBF protein were not significantly different. In addition, supershifts were not observed in either dietary group by EMSA. The possible antigenicity of oral GBF was considered to be low in this colitis model.},

   abstract = {BACKGROUND: Germinated barley foodstuff (GBF) is a prebiotic foodstuff that effectively increases luminal butyrate production by stimulating the growth of protective bacteria. In the first pilot study, GBF has been shown to reduce both clinical activity and mucosal inflammation in ulcerative colitis (UC). The aim of this study was to investigate the efficacy of GBF in the treatment of UC in a multicenter open control trial. METHODS: Eighteen patients with mildly to moderately active UC were divided into two groups using a random allocation protocol. The control group (n = 7) were given a baseline anti-inflammatory therapy for 4 weeks. In the GBF-treated group (n = 11), patients received 20-30 g GBF daily, together with the baseline treatment, for 4 weeks. The response to the treatments was evaluated clinically and endoscopically. Fecal microflora were also analyzed. RESULTS: After 4 weeks of observation, the GBF-treated group showed a significant decrease in clinical activity index scores compared with the control group (P < 0.05). No side effects related to GBF were observed. GBF therapy increased fecal concentrations of Bifidobacterium and Eubacterium limosum. CONCLUSIONS: Oral GBF therapy may have the potency to reduce clinical activity of UC. We believe that these results support the use of GBF administration as a new adjunct therapy for UC.},

   abstract = {OBJECTIVE: Celiac disease (CD), or gluten sensitivity, is considered to be a state of heightened immunologic responsiveness to ingested gluten proteins in genetically predisposed individuals. The gastrointestinal manifestation suggests a severe enteropathy of the small intestine with malabsorption, steatorrhea, and weight loss because of a deranged mucosal immune response. Neurologic complications occur, especially epilepsy, possibly associated with occipital calcifications or folate deficiency and cerebellar ataxia. There have been reports of brain white-matter lesions as an extraintestinal manifestation in Crohn disease and ulcerative colitis but not in CD. METHODS: In this study, 75 diet-treated mainly pediatric patients with biopsy-proven CD underwent prospectively clinical neurologic examinations, laboratory investigations, electroencephalography, computed tomography, and magnetic resonance imaging. The age range was 2.8 to 24.2 years with a mean of 11.6 years. The mean period of gluten exposure was 2.4 years. RESULTS: Ten patients had neurologic findings such as febrile seizures, single generalized seizures, mild ataxia, and muscular hypotonia with retarded motor development. No folate deficiency was found. The hippocampal regions showed no abnormalities. Computed tomography did not reveal any cerebral calcifications, but magnetic resonance imaging detected unilateral and bilateral T2-hyperintensive white-matter lesions in 15 patients (20%). There was no correlation between these lesions and dietary compliance or neurologic or electroencephalographic abnormalities. The mean gluten exposure time of these patients was slightly increased (not significant). CONCLUSIONS: Focal white-matter lesions in the brain may represent an extraintestinal manifestation of CD. They may be ischemic in origin as a result of a vasculitis or caused by inflammatory demyelination. They seem to be more typical of pediatric CD than cerebral calcifications. Their prognostic value is unclear and needs to be elucidated in additional studies. CD should be suggested as a differential diagnosis in children with unclear white-matter lesions even without intestinal symptoms.},

   abstract = {Dietary incorporation of fermentable, indigestible fructans may be of benefit to gastrointestinal health by providing short-chain fatty acids, stimulating the proliferation of bifidobacteria or lactobacilli and suppressing potential pathogenic organisms in the gut. We tested the hypothesis that the effects of fructans on caecal, colonic and faecal short-chain fatty acid concentration and microflora composition depend on their chain length. Germ-free rats associated with a human faecal flora were randomly assigned to one of four treatments as follows: (1) commercial standard diet as a control (Con); (2) Con+50 g short-chain oligofructose/kg (OF); (3) C+50 g long-chain inulin/kg (lcIN); or (4) Con+50 g OF-lcIN/kg (Mix OF-lcIN). Changes in bacterial population groups in response to feeding these diets were investigated with 16S rRNA-targeted probes applied in in situ hybridization. Mix OF-lcIN- and lcIN-containing diets resulted in larger numbers of caecal, colonic and faecal bacteria of the Clostridium coccoides-Eubacterium rectale cluster than Con (10.6 and 10.3 v. 9.5 log10/g wet wt), whereas OF alone did not affect this bacterial group in caecum, colon or faeces. A bifidogenic effect was only observed in the colon and faeces of OF-treated rats. More lactobacilli were found in caecal and colonic contents of Mix OF-lcIN-fed rats and in faeces of OF-fed rats compared with Con. Mix OF-lcIN and OF led to significantly smaller numbers of caecal, colonic and faecal bacteria belonging to the Clostridium histolyticum and C. lituseburense groups than Con (6.8 and 6.9 v. 7.9 log10/g wet wt). Counts of total bacteria, Bacteroides-Prevotella and Enterobacteriaceae did not differ between the groups. OF and/or lcIN-containing diets significantly increased the caecal and colonic concentration of butyrate and its relative molar proportion. Only lcIN-containing diets resulted in a higher faecal concentration of butyrate than Con. Higher molar proportions of faecal butyrate were observed with all diets that had been supplemented with OF and/or lcIN. Stimulation of butyrate production could be of interest for the prevention of ulcerative colitis and colon cancer.},

   abstract = {BACKGROUND: Literature data have shown high specificity of antiendomysial antibodies (EmA IgA) in celiac disease. The scarcity of Brazilian reports concerning this subject motivated the present study. OBJECTIVES: To determine the sensitivity and specificity of antiendomysial IgA antibodies in Brazilian celiac patients at diagnosis and after treatment, to confirm patient adherence to a gluten-free diet and to screen first-degree relatives. METHODS: An extensive clinical and serological study was performed by investigating the presence of these antibodies in 392 individuals from Southern Brazil. Indirect immunofluorescence using human umbilical cord as substrate was employed and the total levels of IgA were determined by turbidimetry in all groups. The study was conducted on 57 celiac patients (18 at diagnosis, 24 who adhered to a gluten-free diet and 15 with marked or slight transgression of the diet), 115 relatives of celiac patients (39 families), 94 patients with other gastrointestinal diseases, and 126 healthy individuals from the general population. RESULTS: The results demonstrated 100% positivity for the recently diagnosed patients and for those consuming gluten, in contrast to the patients who complied with the diet (0%). In the control group one individual was positive, but refused to undergo a biopsy. In the group of other gastrointestinal diseases, one positive patient presented ulcerative colitis, Down's syndrome and epilepsy, and the intestinal biopsy was diagnostic for celiac disease. These data showed 99.3% specificity for the test. Eighteen relatives were positive for antiendomysial antibodies IgA (15.65%), and comparison with the healthy population revealed a significant difference. An intestinal biopsy was obtained from seven subjects (one with total villous atrophy and six without alterations in the mucosal architecture, but all with a high number of intra-epithelial lymphocytes). CONCLUSIONS: The method revealed 100% sensitivity and 99.3% specificity. Because it is not an invasive method it can be used for the screening of atypical and latent forms of celiac disease to avoid serial biopsies and to control adherence to a gluten-free diet with implications in the prevention of malignancy in celiac disease.},

   abstract = {Diverticular disease is common in the elderly Western population and its complications are frequent clinical presentations. Despite this, the pathogenesis of the condition remains relatively poorly understood. Several theories have been developed, the most acceptable suggesting elastosis of the taeniae coli as the primary event, causing shortening of the sigmoid colon, with relative mucosal excess and subsequent mucosal herniations. A Western-type diet is implicated in the increased uptake of proline from the gut, leading to elastosis of the sigmoid colon. For pathologists, in clinical practice, the disease is most commonly seen in sigmoid colonic resection specimens, usually performed for complications of the disease. It is now realised that mucosal biopsies of the luminal mucosa, in the sigmoid colon affected by diverticular disease, can produce perplexing pathological changes. In particular diverticular colitis can mimic both ulcerative colitis and Crohn's disease: care should be taken when diagnosing chronic inflammatory bowel disease on a background of diverticular disease. For pathologists, diverticular disease remains something of an enigma: although common, its pathogenesis remains ill-defined and its complications can provide diagnostic difficulties, which require precise clinical and radiological correlation.},

Coeliac disease (classic and atypical form), Crohn's Disease and ulcerative colitis are considered as chronic autoimmune bowel diseases. The auto-antibodies can be detected with indirect immunofluorescence, ELISA and immunoblotting methods. In coeliac disease the autoantibodies against endomysium (tissue transglutaminase) and antibodies against gliadin are found in patient's sera. The auto-antibody detecting is helpful in establishing diagnosis, controlling gluten-free diet effectiveness and during gluten challenge. In Crohn's disease and ulcerative colitis immunological laboratory tests are helpful to confirm the clinical diagnosis. The following auto-antibodies are tested: against cytoplasm of exocrinal pancreatic cells, and products of these cells, against the neutrophile cytoplasm and against goblet cells. The antibodies against Saccharomyces cerevisiae are also investigated. The clinical relevance of above autoantibodies is not clear, but it is suggested that their presence correlates with exacerbations and severe clinical outcome. In the present study the pictures of autoantibodies from fluorescent microscope were shown.},

   abstract = {BACKGROUND: The mechanism of action of elemental diet in Crohn's disease treatment, is unknown. Alteration of bacterial flora, low antigenicity, low fat content and improvement of nutritional status are postulated to play a role in the anti-inflammatory effect of elemental diet. AIM: To determine whether elemental diet or its modifications has a direct anti-inflammatory effect on colonic tissue biopsies in vitro. PATIENTS AND METHODS: Colonic or ileal biopsies from 39 patients with inflammatory bowel disease and control patients were incubated for 24 hours with enteral diets in which nitrogen sources were amino acids as in elemental diet, casein or whey. Tissues were incubated with elemental diet, casein or whey, at dilutions of 1:5, 1:10 or 1:20 in Waymouth's complete medium; a medium control was also included. Tissue viability was assessed by bromodeoxyuridine uptake. Interleukin-1beta, interleukin-1 receptor antagonist and interleukin-10 concentrations in supernatants were measured by immunoassay (enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay). RESULTS: Incubation of tissues from Crohn's disease with elemental diet resulted in an increase in the ratio of interleukin-1 receptor antagonist/interleukin-1beta vs control statistically significant at 1:10 (89.6+/-17 vs 45.7+/-9. 1, p<0.05). Incubation of Crohn's tissue with casein resulted in a significant increase of interleukin-1 receptor antagonist/interleukin-1beta ratio at dilutions 1:20, 1:10 and 1:5 (101.8+/-22.0, p=0.05, 142.8+/-24.6, p<0.05; 109.7+/-25.0, p=0.05). In ulcerative colitis tissue and non-inflamed non-inflammatory bowel disease control tissue, no significant increase in interleukin 1 receptor antagonist/interleukin-1beta ratio was seen after incubation with elemental diet, casein and whey. CONCLUSION: Elemental diet incubation increases anti-inflammatory:proinflammatory cytokine ratio in Crohn's disease and this anti-inflammatory effect is not specifically due to amino acid composition, as diets containing casein have similar anti-inflammatory effects.},

One example is dietary supplements derived from Chlorella pyrenoidosa, a unicellular fresh water green alga rich in proteins, vitamins, and minerals. OBJECTIVE: To find evidence of the potential of chlorella dietary supplements to relieve signs and symptoms, improve quality of life, and normalize body functions in people with chronic illnesses, specifically fibromyalgia, hypertension, and ulcerative colitis. DESIGN: Double-blind, placebo-controlled, randomized clinical trials. SETTING: Virginia Commonwealth University's Medical College of Virginia. PATIENTS: Fifty-five subjects with fibromyalgia, 33 with hypertension, and 9 with ulcerative colitis. INTERVENTION: Subjects consumed 10 g of pure chlorella in tablet form and 100 mL of a liquid containing an extract of chlorella each day for 2 or 3 months. MAIN OUTCOME MEASURES: For fibromyalgia patients, assessments of pain and overall quality of life. For hypertensive patients, measurements of sitting diastolic blood pressure and serum lipid levels. For patients with ulcerative colitis, determination of state of disease using the Disease Activity Index. RESULTS: Daily dietary supplementation with chlorella may reduce high blood pressure, lower serum cholesterol levels, accelerate wound healing, and enhance immune functions. CONCLUSIONS: The potential of chlorella to relieve symptoms, improve quality of life, and normalize body functions in patients with fibromyalgia, hypertension, or ulcerative colitis suggests that larger, more comprehensive clinical trials of chlorella are warranted.},

This effect is thought to be mediated through the modulation of eicosanoid synthesis. Pro-inflammatory eicosanoids have been implicated in ulcerative colitis. AIM: To investigate the possible therapeutic benefit of essential fatty acids in quiescent ulcerative colitis to reduce the frequency of disease relapse. METHODS: A randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled study was performed with a treatment duration of 12 months. Patients with quiescent disease received either trial medication (gamma-linolenic acid, 1.6 g, eicosapentaenoic acid, 270 mg, and docosahexaenoic acid, 45 mg, per day) or placebo (sunflower oil, 500 mg/day). The primary end-point was disease activity, assessed by a previously validated clinical index, sigmoidoscopic appearance and histology. RESULTS: Sixty-three patients were randomized, 31 to receive essential fatty acid treatment and 32 to receive placebo. Disease relapse rates were similar at 12 months (placebo, 38%; essential fatty acids, 55%), as were changes in sigmoidoscopic grade from baseline. CONCLUSIONS: The supplementation of the diet with this combination of essential fatty acids does not prolong the period of disease remission of ulcerative colitis.},

Epidemiological studies have shown that ulcerative colitis tends to level off, whereas Crohn's disease tends to increase. Some of these changes may be due to diagnostic practices and increasing awareness of the disease and Crohn's colitis. The disease varies according to geographical location and a distribution along a north-south axis has been suggested. The differences may be due to study design, or may reflect differences in lifestyle, diet or be due to genetic predisposition triggered by environmental factors. Epidemiological studies designed to investigate such interactions may provide clues to its aetiology. Inflammatory bowel disease could, therefore, serve as a model for the importance of epidemiology when to test or reject the hypothesis of aetiology.},

We used serum IgA from celiac patients and, for control purposes, from patients with Crohn's disease, ulcerative colitis and from healthy individuals to identify celiac disease-specific IgA autoantigens in nitrocellulose-blotted extracts from various human cell types (epithelial, endothelial, intestinal cells, fibroblasts). The pattern, recognition intensity and time course of IgA autoreactivity was monitored using serial serum samples obtained from celiac children before and under gluten-free diet. By immunoblot inhibition and subcellular (cytosolic, nuclear) cell fractionation we identified a 55 kDa nuclear autoantigen expressed in intestinal, endothelial cells and in fibroblasts which was recognized by IgA antibodies of approximately half of the celiac disease patients and cross-reacted with wheat proteins. IgA reactivity to the 55 kDa autoantigen disappeared during gluten-free diet and was inhibited after pre-absorption of sera with wheat proteins but not with tissue transglutaminase, previously reported as the unique celiac disease-specific autoantigen. In conclusion, we defined a novel 55 kDa celiac disease-specific nuclear IgA autoantigen which shares epitopes with wheat proteins and which is different from tissue transglutaminase and calreticulin. Although the newly defined autoantigen was recognized much less frequently than tissue transglutaminase, our data suggest molecular mimicry between wheat and human proteins as a possible pathomechanism for the induction and/or maintenance of mucosal tissue damage in celiac disease.},

Ultrastructural and histologic changes were analyzed as well as plasma and colonic mucosa fatty acid profiles and some biochemical markers of injury and inflammation [alkaline phosphatase (AP), mieloperoxidase (MPO), prostaglandin E(2) (PGE(2)) and leukotriene B(4)]. Fatty acid profiles of both plasma and mucosa mostly reflected the dietary fatty acid composition. Plasma MUFA proportions were higher in UC animals fed the OO diet compared with FO or BPL groups 1 and 2 wk and (n-3) long chain PUFA (LC-PUFA) were higher in the FO than in the OO and BPL groups. At 1 wk, UC led to lower MUFA mucosa levels and (n-3)LC-PUFA were higher in the FO group compared with the OO and BPL groups. Rats with UC fed FO at 1 wk showed significantly less macroscopic and microscopic colonic damage. They also have lower AP and MPO activities and PGE(2) levels compared with the OO and BPL groups and showed enhanced histological repair, less necrotic areas within the mucosa, and more goblet cells with mature mucin granules. These results suggest that the use of balanced diets containing (n-3) LC-PUFA could ameliorate the inflammation and mucosal damage in UC.},

METHODS: A retrospective review of 32 infants who had been treated with the ketogenic diet at a large metropolitan institution. RESULTS: Most infants (71%) were able to maintain strong ketosis. The overall effectiveness of the diet in infants was similar to that reported in the literature for older children; 19.4% became seizure-free, and an additional 35.5% had >50% reduction in seizure frequency. The diet was particularly effective for patients with infantile spasms/myoclonic seizures. There were concomitant reductions in antiepileptic medications. The majority of parents reported improvements in seizure frequency and in their child's behavior and function, particularly with respect to attention/alertness, activity level, and socialization. The diet generally was well-tolerated, and 96.4% maintained appropriate growth parameters. Adverse events, all reversible and occurring in one patient each, included renal stone, gastritis, ulcerative colitis, alteration of mentation, and hyperlipidemia. CONCLUSION: The ketogenic diet should be considered safe and effective treatment for infants with intractable seizures.},

   abstract = {Measurements of luminal pH in the normal gastrointestinal tract have shown a progressive increase in pH from the duodenum to the terminal ileum, a decrease in the caecum, and then a slow rise along the colon to the rectum. Some data in patients with ulcerative colitis suggest a substantial reduction below normal values in the right colon, while limited results in Crohn's disease have been contradictory. Determinants of luminal pH in the colon include mucosal bicarbonate and lactate production, bacterial fermentation of carbohydrates and mucosal absorption of short chain fatty acids, and possibly intestinal transit. Alterations in these factors, as a result of mucosal disease and changes in diet, are likely to explain abnormal pH measurements in inflammatory bowel disease (IBD). It is conceivable that reduced intracolonic pH in active ulcerative colitis impairs bioavailability of 5-aminosalicylic acid from pH dependent release formulations (Asacol, Salofalk) and those requiring cleavage by bacterial azo reductase (sulphasalazine, olsalazine, balsalazide), but further pharmacokinetic studies are needed to confirm this possibility. Reports that balsalazide and olsalazine may be more efficacious in active and quiescent ulcerative colitis, respectively, than Asacol suggest that low pH may be a more critical factor in patients taking directly pH dependent release than azo bonded preparations. Reduced intracolonic pH also needs to be considered in the development of pH dependent colonic release formulations of budesonide and azathioprine for use in ulcerative and Crohn's colitis. This paper reviews methods for measuring gut pH, its changes in IBD, and how these may influence current and future therapies.},

The aim of this study was to describe the effect of phenol exposure on human colonic epithelial cells in vitro and the conjugation pathways involved in detoxification. METHODS: Primary human colonic epithelial cell cultures or HT-29 cell cultures were exposed to paracetamol, dinitrophenol or phenol (0.1-5 mM) for 24 h. Cell viability was measured using the methyltetrazoleum test. Phenol conjugation products released from cell cultures were identified by high-pressure liquid chromatography. Phenol glucuronidase (PGD) and sulphotransferase (PST) enzyme activities were measured in isolated cell homogenates. RESULTS: Paracetamol, dinitrophenol and phenol (>1.25 mM) significantly impaired the viability of primary colonic epithelial cell cultures. No differences between cell cultures from ulcerative colitis and control patients were observed. Paracetamol (5 mM) also induced significant cell damage in HT-29 cells. Glucuronidation was the preferred conjugation pathway in both cell models, despite the presence of PGD and PST activity. CONCLUSION: Phenols have a direct toxic effect on human colonic epithelial cells in vitro, which supports the view that dietary fermentation metabolites may be involved in the modulation of chronic bowel inflammation.},

It usually presents with rectal bleeding and may be difficult to distinguish clinically, endoscopically and pathologically from other segmental colitides including ulcerative, Crohn's, ischaemic, infective and NSAID-induced colitis as well as diverticulitis. Uncontrolled data suggests that most patients respond satisfactorily to treatment with a high fibre diet, antibiotics and/or aminosalicylates, but a minority with persistent or recurrent symptoms require sigmoid resection.

Appendicitis has an incidence of about 5-10% of the number likely to be observed in a white population. The conundrum is that the disparity exists despite many Africans having adopted an urbanized lifestyle with major changes in their dietary pattern. Dietary fiber intake, which was previously 30-35 g, has decreased to 12-14 g daily. Studies on small bowel function in black people have shown that physiological malabsorption of lactose, fructose, sucrose and maize (the staple food) occurs. It is hypothesized that the increased concentration of substrate available for fermentation in the colon compensates for the low dietary fiber intake, is protective to the large bowel and is a factor in the prevention of 'developed society' large bowel diseases in the African population.},

However, the effect of iron supplementation on UC-associated carcinogenesis is unknown. In this study, the effect of an iron-enriched diet on dextran sulfate sodium-induced acute and chronic colitis in mice was assessed. In a short-term study, mice administered 1% DSS in the drinking fluid and an AIN76A diet containing increasing levels of iron exhibited dose-dependent increases in the severity of acute UC as compared to mice fed a control diet. A marked increase in iron deposition on the epithelial surface of the colon and in the inflamed areas and immunostaining for iNOS and nitrotyrosine were observed in the animals supplemented with diets containing different levels of iron. In a long-term carcinogenesis experiment, a twofold iron-enriched diet significantly increased colorectal tumor incidence (14/16, 88%) as compared with animals fed the control diet (3/16, 19%; P < 0.001). The present findings have implications for the management of human UC and suggest that dietary iron can enhance UC and its associated carcinogenesis by augmenting oxidative and nitrosative stress.},

   abstract = {Long-term ulcerative colitis (UC) patients are at increased risk for developing colorectal cancer. In order to develop strategies for preventing UC-associated carcinogenesis, we studied the effect of the antioxidant N-acetylcysteine (NAC) on UC-associated cancer development in a mouse model. Female C57BL/6J mice were subjected to long-term administration of dextran sulfate sodium (DSS) in the drinking fluid and 2-fold iron-enriched AIN76A diet, with or without NAC. In the DSS-plus-2-fold iron positive control group, gross tumor incidence was 88.5% (23/26 mice) after 12 DSS cycles (1 DSS cycle = 7 day DSS treatment period followed by 10 day recovery period). The tumor multiplicity was 2.1 +/- 0.2 tumors/tumor-bearing mouse, and the tumor volume was 0.054 +/- 0.019 cm3. With 0.2% NAC administration, tumor incidence was significantly reduced (68%, 17/25 mice; P < 0.05), as was the tumor multiplicity (1.5 +/- 0.1 tumors/tumor-bearing mouse; P < 0.05). The tumor volume was lower (0.014 +/- 0.004 cm3), but not significantly decreased. The proliferation index was significantly decreased in non-cancerous epithelia (48.5 +/- 6.0% vs 32.0 +/- 3.7%; P < 0.05), but not in tumor cells. NAC significantly induced apoptosis in both non-cancerous epithelia and colorectal adenocarcinoma. The number of cells immunostained-positive for nitrotyrosine was markedly decreased in the non-cancerous mucosa of NAC-treated mice (102.4 +/-16.6 positive cells/mm2 mucosa vs 53.6 +/- 14.9 cells/mm2; P < 0.05). In addition, the number of inducible nitric oxide synthase (iNOS)-positive inflammatory cells in the non-cancerous mucosa of the distal colon was markedly decreased by NAC. This study indicates that the antioxidant NAC has the potential to serve as a preventive agent for UC-associated colorectal cancer, possibly via inhibition of cellular proliferation and nitrosative stress-caused cellular damage.},

   abstract = {Probiotic therapy is attracting the renewed interest of clinicians and basic investigators from a variety of traditional research disciplines. While the theoretical rationale for modifying the commensal flora of the gastrointestinal tract in specific circumstances appears sound and requires scientific pursuit, the field of probiotics has been clouded by exaggerated claims from some quarters. In general, many of the claims for therapeutic efficacy have not been well substantiated, but the field is now poised for evaluation within the realm of evidence-based medicine. Alterations in commensal bacterial flora within the gastrointestinal tract are associated with susceptibility to pathogens such as Clostridium difficile and there is persuasive evidence that the normal flora may participate in the pathogenesis of inflammatory bowel disease and other chronic diseases in genetically susceptible individuals. This has prompted various strategies to fortify or otherwise modify the enteric flora by dietary supplements containing probiotic formulations. Detailed comparisons of probiotic performance amongst different bacterial strains have not been performed in vivo in man or under clinical trial conditions, and the level of scientific characterisation of individual organisms has been variable. In addition, it cannot be assumed that the same probiotic is equally suitable for all individuals. Moreover, the heterogeneity of clinical disorders such as Crohn's disease and ulcerative colitis implies that strain-specific properties may be required for subset-specific categories of patients. While cocktails of probiotics offer convenience, therapeutic progress may require clarification of the mechanism of probiotic action and may be delayed until individual bacterial components have been rigorously studied. More importantly, the full potential of therapeutic manipulation of the enteric flora with probiotics or other strategies may not be optimally realised until the composition and metabolic activities of the normal flora are better understood.},

Some of the effects of omega-3 PUFA are brought about by modulation of the amount and types of eicosanoids made, and other effects are elicited by eicosanoid-independent mechanisms, including actions upon intracellular signaling pathways, transcription factor activity and gene expression. Animal experiments and clinical intervention studies indicate that omega-3 fatty acids have anti-inflammatory properties and, therefore, might be useful in the management of inflammatory and autoimmune diseases. Coronary heart disease, major depression, aging and cancer are characterized by an increased level of interleukin 1 (IL-1), a proinflammatory cytokine. Similarly, arthritis, Crohn's disease, ulcerative colitis and lupus erythematosis are autoimmune diseases characterized by a high level of IL-1 and the proinflammatory leukotriene LTB(4) produced by omega-6 fatty acids. There have been a number of clinical trials assessing the benefits of dietary supplementation with fish oils in several inflammatory and autoimmune diseases in humans, including rheumatoid arthritis, Crohn's disease, ulcerative colitis, psoriasis, lupus erythematosus, multiple sclerosis and migraine headaches. Many of the placebo-controlled trials of fish oil in chronic inflammatory diseases reveal significant benefit, including decreased disease activity and a lowered use of anti-inflammatory drugs.},

   abstract = {Histiocytic ulcerative colitis (HUC) is described in three non-boxer dogs. Clinical signs were typical of large-bowel diarrhea and included soft stool, hematochezia, tenesmus, and an increased frequency of defecation. Diagnosis in each case was made by light microscopic evaluation of endoscopically obtained colonic biopsy specimens. Treatment regimes varied, but included immunosuppressive agents, anti-inflammatory drugs, antimicrobials, and dietary modification. Clinical response was substantial in two patients, while the third patient was euthanized due to treatment failure. The authors' observations indicate that HUC may be encountered in non-boxer dogs.},

   abstract = {Some inflammatory diseases of the gastrointestinal system are associated with neurological symptoms which, in rare cases, may precede the onset of the gastrointestinal manifestation of the disease. Celiac sprue is characterized by an intolerance to the wheat protein gluten. The typical neurological manifestation of celiac sprue is cerebellar ataxia. The ataxia as well as the gastrointestinal symptoms can be treated with a strictly gluten-free diet. The neurological symptoms of Whipple's disease, a disorder caused by gram-positive bacilli, are variable. Typical symptoms of cerebral Whipple's disease include dementia, ophthalmoplegia, movement disorders, and signs of hypothalamic dysfunction. Nowadays, the diagnosis of cerebral Whipple's disease is made by PCR detection of the bacilli in the CSF. Crohn's disease and ulcerative colitis are associated with neurological symptoms to a similar proportion. Various forms of polyneuropathies have been observed. The CNS manifestations of inflammatory bowel diseases include thromboembolic stroke, cerebral venous thrombosis, and cerebral vasculitis.},

   abstract = {BACKGROUND: Mice with a targeted mutation in the G protein subunit G alpha i2 gene develop a colonic mucosal inflammation, with a highly activated B-cell response. We wanted to investigate whether this increased B-cell activity was directed against dietary antigens and/or various self tissues. METHODS: The level of antibodies specific for dietary (gliadin, soya and fish meal) antigens was measured by ELISA. Reactivity against self antigens was measured by immunohistochemistry on cryo-sectioned mouse and rat tissue. Sera and intestinal lavages were analysed from G alpha i2-/- mice before and after development of colitis and in age-matched wild type litter mates. RESULTS: Titres of antibodies against dietary antigens were significantly enhanced both in serum and in large intestinal lavages from G alpha i2-/- mice with ongoing colitis but not prior to disease, as compared to wild type mice. The autoreactivity to self tissues was significantly increased in G alpha i2-/- mice both before and after development of colitis as compared to litter mate control animals. Self tissue reactivity was directed not only against epithelial cells of the colon, small intestine and gastric glands, but also against smooth muscle cells, hepatocytes, bile duct cells, renal tubule and collecting tubule cells of the kidney. In analogy to human ulcerative colitis, autoantibodies against epithelial cells, bile duct epithelium and neutrophil granulocytes were found. CONCLUSIONS: Earlier increase in levels of autoantibodies (before onset of colitis) than of food antibodies (after onset of colitis) suggests the latter response to be a secondary phenomenon to e.g. a destroyed barrier function.},

   abstract = {Thrombophilia in inflammatory bowel disease may be due to several risk factors, such as a dysbalanced haemostasis with a hypercoagulative state, thrombocytosis, hyperfibrinogenaemia and hyperhomocysteinaemia. In addition, increased concentrations of lipoprotein (a), a modified form of low-density lipoprotein particles, have been associated with a higher risk of thrombotic vascular disease, probably due to inhibition of (local and endothelial) fibrinolysis. The mechanisms regulating the plasma concentration of lipoprotein (a) have not yet been elucidated completely, but genetic factors are involved. Dietary factors seem to play a minor role. In this issue of the journal, Koutroubakis et al. report that lipoprotein (a) concentration is elevated in patients with Crohn's disease, but not in patients with ulcerative colitis. Several other (apo)lipoproteins have a different pattern in patients with inflammatory bowel disease than in a control population of healthy subjects from Crete. These findings add up to the multifactorial nature of thrombophilia in inflammatory bowel disease patients, especially in patients with Crohn's disease, and give rise to speculations about the clinical significance of the observed different lipoprotein metabolism in patients with inflammatory bowel disease.},

   abstract = {PURPOSE: Inflammation is a constant finding in the ileal reservoir of patients with an ileal pouch-anal anastomosis and is associated with decreased fecal concentrations of the short chain fatty acid butyrate, increased fecal pH, changes in fecal flora, and increased concentrations of secondary bile acids. In healthy subjects, inulin, a dietary fiber, is fermented to short chain fatty acids and leads to a lower pH and potentially beneficial changes in fecal flora. The aim of the present study was to investigate the effect of enteral supplementation of inulin on inflammation of the ileal reservoir. METHODS: Twenty patients received 24 g of inulin or placebo daily during three weeks in a randomized, double-blind, crossover design. Stools were analyzed after each test period for pH, short chain fatty acids, microflora, and bile acids. Inflammation was assessed endoscopically, histologically, and clinically. RESULTS: Compared with placebo, three weeks of dietary supplementation with 24 g of inulin increased butyrate concentrations, lowered pH, decreased numbers of Bacteroides fragilis, and diminished concentrations of secondary bile acids in feces. This was endoscopically and histologically accompanied by a reduction of inflammation of the mucosa of the ileal reservoir. CONCLUSION: Enteral inulin supplementation leads to a decrease of inflammation-associated factors and to a reduction of inflammation of pouch mucosa.},

   abstract = {Kidney stones are increased in patients with bowel disease, particularly those who have had resection of part of their gastrointestinal tract. These stones are usually CaOx, but there is a marked increase in the tendency to form uric acid stones, as well, particularly in patients with colon resection. These patients all share a tendency to chronic volume contraction due to loss of water and salt in diarrheal stool, which leads to decreased urine volumes. They also have decreased absorption, and therefore diminished urinary excretion, of citrate and magnesium, which normally act as inhibitors of CaOx crystallization. Patients with colon resection and ileostomy form uric acid stones, as loss of bicarbonate in the ileostomy effluent leads to formation of an acid urine. This, coupled with low urine volume, decreases the solubility of uric acid, causing crystallization and stone formation. Prevention of stones requires treatment with alkalinizing agents to raise urine pH to about 6.5, and attempts to increase urine volume, which increases the solubility of uric acid and prevents crystallization. Patients with small bowel resection may develop steatorrhea; if the colon is present, they are at risk of hyperoxaluria due to increased permeability of the colon to oxalate in the presence of fatty acids, and increased concentrations of free oxalate in the bowel lumen due to fatty acid binding of luminal calcium. EH leads to supersaturation of urine with respect to CaOx, in conjunction with low volume, hypocitraturia and hypomagnesuria. Therapy involves a low-fat, low-oxalate diet, attempts to increase urine volume, and agents such as calcium given to bind oxalate in the gut lumen. Correction of hypocitraturia and hypomagnesuria are also helpful.},
