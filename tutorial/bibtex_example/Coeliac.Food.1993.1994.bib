   abstract = {Several factors related to the patient and the pancreatin formulation influence the efficacy of enzyme supplementation. Up to now, only few tests exist to judge the efficacy of enzyme replacement therapy in pancreatic insufficiency. Tube tests and fecal fat excretion studies are cumbersome, time-consuming and unpleasant. Recently, several breath tests for the detection of pancreatic insufficiency have been developed. The cholesteryl octanoate breath test differentiated between healthy controls and patients with pancreatic insufficiency already after a 30-min collection period. Using this test, it was demonstrated that a pancreatin preparation containing small microspheres (1.0-1.2 mm) induces high duodenal lipolytic activity parallel to gastric emptying of food. In contrast, the gastric emptying of large microspheres (1.8-2.0 mm) is significantly delayed. The cholesteryl octanoate breath test detects pancreatic insufficiency within 30-60 min and offers the possibility of monitoring the in vivo release of pancreatin preparations.},

   abstract = {Hydrogen concentration in expired breath depends on the fraction of ingested carbohydrates unabsorbed by the small intestinal mucosa which reach the large intestine and are fermented by the colonic flora. The aim of this study is to assess whether in coeliac children breath hydrogen excretion reflects the histological changes in the jejunal mucosa. Hydrogen breath test was performed on 40 children (15 males 25 females) divided into three groups. Group I (controls): 9 children with symptoms suggestive of coeliac disease who, after the appropriate workup, were found to suffer from other gastrointestinal disorders and had abnormal jejunal mucosa. Group II: 14 children who had been diagnosed as coeliacs according to the ESPGAN criteria, were kept on a gluten free diet for a minimum of 6 months and had a normal jejunal mucosa. Group III: 17 coeliac children who ate small quantities of gluten or were on a normal diet. At histology, 10 of them showed a total and 7 a partial atrophy of the jejunal mucosa. Breath hydrogen levels were measured both at baseline and after ingestion of a 2% sorbitol solution in water, at 30 minute intervals for four hours. The peak hydrogen level and the total surface area under the hydrogen excretion curve were also assessed. Coeliac children on a gluten containing diet excrete significantly more H2 than controls or coeliacs on a gluten free diet. Patients with more severe histological lesions had higher peak H2 levels and greater total excretion areas. In coeliac children, sorbitol breath H2 test represents a simple noninvasive technique to detect impaired jejunal function and it should have an important role as a screening test and in assessing dietary compliance.},

   abstract = {BACKGROUND: Patients with celiac disease have immunoglobulin (Ig) M antibodies and IgA antigliadin antibody in gut secretions; this pattern of intestinal immunity may be a marker of latent celiac disease. Its frequency in patients referred for jejunal biopsy has been examined. METHODS: Serum IgG and IgA antigliadin antibody, jejunal fluid IgA and IgM antibodies to gliadin, ovalbumin and beta lactoglobulin, and jejunal fluid IgA and IgM concentrations were measured by enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay. RESULTS: Seventeen of 19 celiac patients on normal diet and 16 of 23 on gluten-free diet had the celiaclike antibody pattern, as did 41 of 217 other patients. Jejunal biopsy histology had been classified as normal in 38 of these, with minor abnormalities in 3; however, intraepithelial lymphocyte (IEL) counts were high in 13 cases. Trial of a gluten-free diet produced clinical improvement in 6 of 7 antibody-positive patients. After extra dietary gluten, one developed subtotal villous atrophy. CONCLUSIONS: The celiaclike intestinal antibody pattern and a high IEL count may be markers of latent gluten-sensitive enteropathy; some of these patients are clinically gluten sensitive in the absence of enteropathy.},

   abstract = {Against the background of reported different trends of incidence and presentation of coeliac disease in Sweden and Finland, a joint study was done to explore potential causes. The clinical study confirmed that classical symptoms and diagnosis before 2 years of age dominated in Sweden. In Finland, the symptoms were more diffuse and diagnosis in most cases was made after the age of 8 years. A significantly lower weight score attained at diagnosis was seen in Swedish patients compared with Finnish. No significant difference in HLA expression was found. Infant feeding was investigated by studying food records of healthy infants. Swedish infants ingested three times more wheat protein at 9 months and twice as much at 12 months compared with Finnish children. It is concluded that the intake of infant cereal protein might influence when and how clinical coeliac disease appears. The question whether or not it is important for if coeliac disease will be acquired still remains to be answered.},

In the past 5 years, we have observed six patients with atypical symptoms who had mesenteric artery occlusion combined with stenosis or occlusion of the celiac artery. Atypical symptoms included severe nausea and vomiting at the sight or smell of food, anorexia, weight loss, and right upper quadrant or epigastric discomfort (celiac territory symptoms). An extensive work-up to rule out gastric, pancreatic, biliary, or colonic pathology was undertaken in these patients. The findings included gallbladder dysfunction, diffuse micro-ulceration of gastric mucosa, and colonic mucosal ulceration. The diagnosis of visceral artery occlusion was initially missed in all six patients. Four patients had cholecystectomy. Visceral angiography confirmed occlusion of the celiac, superior, and inferior mesenteric arteries. Five patients had dramatic resolution of symptoms after restoration of visceral circulation. One patient who developed intestinal infarction before revascularization died. Symptoms suggesting upper abdominal visceral pathology may be a manifestation of celiac artery stenosis/occlusion coexisting with mesenteric artery occlusive disease. Visceral angiography should be part of the work-up in these patients for early diagnosis and prompt management.},

Standard dosing consisted of 500 U lipase/kg body weight/meal, 250 U lipase/kg body weight/snack; high dosing consisted of 1,500 U lipase/kg body weight/meal, 750 U lipase/kg body weight/snack. Doses were determined by units of lipase/kg body weight to provide dosing consistency among patients of varying size. Each patient was on a regular diet of approximately 100 g of fat per day. Two separate, 72-h stool collections were performed between markers. A significant difference in mean percentage fat absorbed between the standard dose and the high dose was found (86% versus 91%, p < 0.05). Subjects were then stratified into two groups, based on the grams of fecal fat eliminated (GFFE) as follows: Group 1 with < or = 7 GFFE/24 h on both dosages (n = 7) and Group 2 with > 7 GFFE/24 h on either dose (n = 14). A significant difference (p < 0.05) between Group 1 (96%) and Group 2 (88%) was noted in the percentage fat absorbed while on the high dose. Fat absorption improved from 81% to 88%, (p < 0.05) in Group 2. During the study period, the adverse reactions of constipation or elevated serum uric acid levels were not observed. The increased doses of pancreatic enzymes resulted in improved correction of steatorrhea.},

The atopic group showed normal values of sIL-2R (1,183 +/- 468 u/ml); however, it was increased in children with CMI (1,453 +/- 469 u/ml, p < 0.05). The sIL-2R mean value was highest in patients with gastrointestinal symptoms (1,458 +/- 461 u/ml, p: 0.03) and the presence of atopic dermatitis was not relevant. The sIL-2R was also elevated in 8 children with igE-mediated sensitization against cow's milk (1,477 +/- 328 u/ml, p < 0.05). These results suggest that a delayed cellular mechanism occurred in CMI, similar to that present in coeliac disease, although it was less severe. In addition, there is an overlap of humoral and cellular immunological mechanisms in the IgE-mediated sensitization to cow's milk, but we did not find this coincidence in the allergy to remaining foods. From a pathogenic point of view, to separate CMI from IgE-mediated allergies to milk does not seem to be sufficiently justified at the present time. It is possible that the atopy against cow milk proteins in children has a different immunological mechanism than the atopy to other foods, which would explain its better prognosis.},

   abstract = {Carcinoma of the pancreas has a poor prognosis with a short survival time. Despite diagnostic advances, diagnosis is often delayed because early symptoms are frequently vague and non-specific. Symptomatic treatment is the only possibility in the large majority of patients with pancreatic cancer since curative surgical excision of the tumor is only possible in few cases. Symptoms managed, in the aim to improve the quality of life, include weight loss and anorexia, abdominal pain, jaundice secondary to biliary compression and digestives consequences of pancreatic surgery. Anorexia is a frequent complaint in patients with pancreatic cancer, and contributes to decreased caloric intake, weight loss and malnutrition. Patients who are unable to eat, due to obstruction or dysfunctional gastrointestinal tract, may benefit from enteral or parenteral nutrition. Patients whose main reason to not obtain adequate food intake is anorexia may benefit from recently developed pharmacologic strategies. Megestrol acetate often produce an improvement in appetite and weight gain in patients with advanced cancer. Jaundice can be treated by surgical biliary drainage or better still by palliative biliary endoprosthesis. Percutaneous transhepatic or endocopic biliary drainage are now well established methods for decompressing malignant biliary obstruction. Pain occurs in 80-85% of patients with advanced disease. Abdominal pain should be treated by oral non-narcotic analgesics, or, if necessary, potent narcotic analgesics, and sometimes by percutaneous block of the celiac ganglion, splancnicectomy or abdominal radiotherapy. Celiac plexus block with alcohol is the most common and well described therapy for the specific pain from carcinoma of the pancreas. Digestive consequences of pancreatic surgery also require symptomatic treatment.},

It is commercially rated as a cereal, which has led to some misunderstanding concerning its use in gluten induced enteropathy or celiac disease. The effect of buckwheat flour ingestion by celiac patients was evaluated through the indirect immunofluorescence technique. Samples of serum were collected 30 days after the flour ingestion. Cryostat performed cuts of wheat and buckwheat grains were accomplished in order to compare the reactivity of their proteins and serum of celiac and normal patients. The assay revealed that the buckwheat flour presents no toxicity for the celiac patient and no anti-protein antibodies formation in the grain was observed for serum dilutions of 1:2 up to 1:32 with 0.15 M NaCl solution in 0.01 M phosphate buffer, pH 7.2 throughout the 30 day assay period. The results of the immunological assays showed that the buckwheat flour does not present toxic prolamines to celiac disease patients.},

The results suggested the following conclusions: the 56.5% extraction value for flour obtention is considered good; the buckwheat flour presents methionine and cystine as first limiting amino acids followed by threonine as the second limiting amino acid; the buckwheat flour presents higher content of lysine amino acids than the wheat flour; the buckwheat flour is superior to the wheat flour regarding iron, copper, and magnesium minerals; the buckwheat flour does not present haemagglutinin activity and the tannin content is negligible. Rheological assays indicate that the buckwheat flour does not contain gluten.},

A dot immunobinding assay was developed using these antibodies to detect gluten in wheat, rye, barley and oats. The limit of sensitivity of the assay was 1 microgram/ml for unfractionated wheat gliadin and rye prolamins, and 5 micrograms/ml for barley and oat prolamins. Extracts of flours from coeliac non-toxic rice, maize, millet and sorghum gave negative results. Malt, which represents a partial hydrolysate of barley prolamins, was shown to contain the equivalent of 100-200 mg of barley prolamins/100 g of malt. The assay demonstrates the presence of intact epitopes from the coeliac-activating domain I of alpha-gliadins in malted barley, suggesting toxicity.},

Five of the antibodies cross-reacted with coeliac non-toxic cereals. Two of eight of the antibodies bound specifically to coeliac toxic prolamins. These two antibodies cross-reacted with high molecular weight gliadins, which are closely related to alpha-gliadins and whose toxicity to patients with coeliac disease is unclear. The antibodies were screened by enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay against three amino-acid-sequenced peptides of alpha-gliadin with single amino-acid differences. Differential binding of antibody WC2 suggested that this antibody binds in the region of amino-acid residue 36, a proline residue, where there may be an antigenic beta-reverse turn. This proline residue forms part of a tetrapeptide motif, QQQP, which is thought to be present in all coeliac-active peptides.},

We investigated the inflammatory response of rectal mucosa to local gluten challenge as a dynamic model of antigen-induced tissue injury, during which the expression of adhesion molecules on leucocytes and endothelial cells could be sequentially observed. Expression of ELAM-1, ICAM-1 and VCAM-1 was monitored in 10 treated and eight untreated patients with gluten sensitivity (coeliac disease), and in five disease controls for up to 4 h (short challenge), while a further seven treated coeliacs were monitored for up to 24 h (long challenge) following rectal gluten challenge. In the former, the expression of VCAM-1 and ELAM-1 was significantly raised 4 h after gluten challenge compared with controls. VCAM-1 and ELAM-1 expression was also increased in mucosae of treated patients, but to a lesser extent. VCAM-1 expression continued to increase for up to 24 h after gluten, while ELAM-1 had begun to wane by 4 h, reaching basal levels by 24 h. In contrast, the expression of ICAM-1 did not change in any of the disease groups studied. These findings relate to significant increases in lymphocytes (CD3+ cells) after 8 h, and neutrophils (CD15+ cells) after 4 h in the lamina propria. This approach has permitted novel studies of the inflammatory response to a defined antigen in sensitized (gluten-sensitive) human patients.},

A reference group of preadolescents with coeliac disease was also included in the study. Intestinal permeability and antigliadin antibody tests were performed on all patients. The diagnostic marker of intestinal permeability was excellent in the reference group. Neither the intestinal permeability test nor antigliadin antibody tests, however, succeeded in discriminating between the two groups of adolescents considered in this study.

The presence of these two pathologies interfered with the intestinal absorption of L-thyroxin (L-T4) and made the appropriate management of CH difficult. A male patient, formula fed from birth, was screened for CH at 5 days of age. CH was confirmed and L-T4 treatment (6.8 micrograms/kg/day per os) begun at 35 days of age. Seen after 3 weeks because of feeding problems and impaired growth and with a serum T4 concentration of 4.7 micrograms/dl and a TSH of 56 mU/ml, his replacement dose was increased to 12 micrograms/kg/day. One week later, the child was hospitalized because of vomiting, acidosis and shock. CMPI was diagnosed and the child began a diet with a hydrolyzed milk protein food. After 7 weeks the serum T4 improved to 11 micrograms/dl, the TSH decreased to 10 mU/ml, while maintaining the 12 micrograms/kg dose. After 2 months an oral challenge with cow's milk confirmed the diagnosis of CMPI with a concomitant decrease in serum T4 to 6.4 micrograms/dl, while TSH rose to 64 mU/ml. Weight and T4 levels normalised with CMPI diet. At 12 months of age the patient presented anorexia and impaired growth.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS)},

In Israel, celiac disease is relatively common among the Jewish population but considered to be rarer among the Arab population. We compared the manifestations of celiac disease in children of both ethnic groups and questioned whether differences in presentation relate to degree of awareness for celiac disease in each group. Age at presentation, time interval between onset of symptoms and diagnosis, prevalence of gastrointestinal symptoms, presence of signs of malabsorption and degree of growth retardation varied markedly between both groups. In populations in which there is a low index of suspicion for celiac disease, symptoms may be wrongly attributed to the post-gastroenteritis syndromes or protein-calorie malnutrition, thus resulting in a detrimental delay in diagnosis. Undiagnosed cases may in later childhood manifest predominantly as short stature.},

Doppler indices of PSV, TAMV, EDV, and PI were measured immediately before and after feeding at 15 minute intervals up to 75 minutes. Maximal changes were compared with preprandial baseline values. There were no significant differences between the preprandial and postprandial blood pressures and heart rates. In the superior mesenteric artery the PSV, TAMV, and EDV rose progressively and peaked 30 minutes after feeding in both the milk-fed group and the 5% glucose, water-fed group over baseline (73 versus 41% and 110 versus 63%, 130 versus 100%) (P < 0.05). The PI decreased significantly in the milk-fed group only. There were no significant changes in any blood flow velocity parameters derived from the celiac artery. We conclude that duplex ultrasonography provides a noninvasive means of studying the reactivity of the splanchnic arterial circulation to different stimuli. The chemical composition of the meal is a significant factor determining postprandial mesenteric hyperemia.},

   abstract = {Zinc is present in and indispensable to all forms of life. Zinc is essential for the normal growth of human beings, and zinc proteins have been shown to be involved in the transcription and translation of the genetic material. Zinc deficiency has been incriminated in infertility, abortions, malformations, fetal intrauterine growth retardation, premature and postmature births, perinatal death, and abnormal deliveries with dystocia and placental ablation. Risk groups for developing zinc deficiency, which in turn might modify the expression of the underlying disease, are found among those with insufficient food intake, especially in protein malnutrition; abnormal mucosal uptake, as in celiac disease; abnormal intestinal losses, as in steatorrhea and inflammatory bowel disease; abnormal renal excretion, as in diabetes with insufficient metabolic control; alcoholism; and treatment with diuretic drugs. Zinc deficiency could be identified by means of fasting serum or plasma samples or the more laborious estimation of zinc in leucocytes or monocytes if sampling and handling is carefully performed and if stressful situations and acute-phase reactions as fever, delivery, or abortion are avoided. Zinc therapy in identified low-zinc groups has given favorable results and has reduced the frequencies of premature birth, placental ablation, perinatal death, and postmaturity. It is suggested, as we did in 1980, that these data are compatible with the presence of a zinc-deficiency syndrome in pregnancy, which includes increased maternal morbidity, abnormal taste sensations, abnormally short or prolonged gestations, inefficient labor, atonic bleeding, and increased risks to the fetus such as malformations, growth retardation, prematurity, postmaturity, and perinatal death.},

Drug absorption and ion and bicarbonate transport were also studied in healthy subjects. Patients with Crohn's disease of the distal ileum revealed an increased release of inflammatory agents into the lumen of the proximal jejunum. Luminal provocation with different antigens in cases of celiac disease and food intolerance not only activated cells in the intestinal mucosa but also increased the leakage from plasma and lymph. Studies of drug absorption elucidated the kinetics of drug transport from intestine to plasma, and basal neurologic effects on ion and bicarbonate transport were determined.},

A circulatory response was studied in the celiac trunk, superior mesenteric artery, splenic and portal veins. The normal values of the diameter, linear and volumetric blood flow velocities of the vessels under study were defined. There was their increased velocity of arterial and venous flows. A nevous response to a meal was ahead of an arterial one and the increase in blood flow in the celiac trunk occurred more rapidly than in the superior mesenteric artery.

   abstract = {Exocrine pancreatic insufficiency combined with pancreatic pain and endocrine pancreatic insufficiency are the leading symptoms of chronic pancreatitis. Due to the large functional reserve capacity of the gland, decompensation, i.e. steatorrhea, does not occur before lipase excretion is reduced to < or = 10% of normal. Pancreatic enzyme substitution is indicated when fecal fat excretion exceeds a critical value (normally > 15 g/day) and/or when weight loss is present. A number of studies have dealt with the problems of gastric acid inactivation of pancreatic enzyme preparations as well as their gastric emptying nonsimultaneously with the food. For the present, it is recommended that pancreatic enzyme substitution in patients with proven exocrine pancreatic insufficiency and normal gastric acid secretion be given in multiunit, acid-protected dosages. In patients with gastric hyposecretion and in those who underwent partial or total gastrectomy, enzyme substitution should be administered as granules to enable mixing and simultaneous transport of enzymes with the chyme. The ultimate aim of further scientific and clinical research remains the total abolishment of pancreatic steatorrhea.},

The real meaning of these antibodies is still unclear. We ascertained the levels of antigluten antibodies in a group of children with juvenile chronic arthritis to determine if these antibodies were linked with celiac disease and/or to increased intestinal permeability. In 18 of 53 patients (33.9%), the levels of antigluten antibodies (IgA or IgG) were higher than normal. No correlation was found between the increase in antigluten antibodies and the positive lactulose/mannitol test, used for determining increased intestinal permeability. In all eight patients undergoing intestinal biopsy due to abnormal levels of antigluten antibodies (IgA class), intestinal mucosa was normal. In conclusion, our study shows that in patients with juvenile chronic arthritis, immunological response to gluten is neither related to celiac disease nor to increased intestinal permeability.},

   abstract = {General Recommendations: 1. Children with diabetes mellitus have the same basic nutritional requirements as other children. 2. Dietary recommendations should be based on good eating habits for the whole family. Radical changes in diet involving unusual foods or eating patterns for the child with diabetes alone are not appropriate. 3. Energy requirements of children vary widely and the energy content of the diet should be based on what the child usually eats. The diet should be reviewed regularly to meet the changing needs of growth and physical exercise without obesity. 4. The insulin regimen should, as far as is possible, be chosen to fit the child's daily lifestyle and preferred eating habits. Insulin type, dose, and frequency should be reviewed with the diet as the child develops. 5. Regular distribution of meals and snacks throughout the day remains the most important way to avoid extremes of hyperglycaemia and hypoglycaemia. This distribution should be based on an exchange system, using handy measures and taking into account food and meal type, the particular insulin regimen and the child's exercise patterns and usual eating habits. Currently this exchange system is based on carbohydrate foods but in the future the energy and fat contents will need further consideration. 6. Most special 'diabetic foods' are unnecessary. Low calorie sweeteners, as used in low calorie fruit squashes and fizzy drinks, are useful. 7. Children with diabetes from specific ethnic minority groups, or on vegan diets or living in deprived circumstances require special dietary attention for their diabetes. Those with coexisting chronic disorders such as cystic fibrosis or coeliac disease, should receive dietary advice from professionals with specialist knowledge. 8. Translating the principles of diabetic dietary management into a varied diet, arranged readily by the parents and eaten by the child, is demanding. It can best be met by a skilled dietitian working in close co-operation with child, parents, diabetes specialist nurse and doctor. Infancy 9. The diet should not differ from that of infants without diabetes. Breast feeding should be encouraged or a standard infant formula-feed used. Solids may be introduced from 3-6 months, but breast milk or a modified infant formula is encouraged as part of the increasingly mixed diet to at least the end of the first year. 10. Diabetes is rare in infancy so expert advice should be sought from dietitians experienced in paediatric diabetes. Under fives: 11.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 400 WORDS)},

Mean plasma vitamin E and vitamin E/total lipid ratio were significantly lower in CAIP when compared with either control or Crohn's disease groups. A low vitamin E/total lipid ratio was found in 75% of CAIP patients (91% with steatorrhea) and a ratio less than 1.0 was virtually 100% predictive of steatorrhea. The mean plasma vitamin A level for the CAIP group was significantly lower (overall 16%, 38% with steatorrhea) than in controls. Patients with CAIP show subnormal plasma levels vitamin E more often as compared to vitamin A. Further, the plasma vitamin E/total lipids ratio may be a sensitive and practical means in the detection and follow-up of steatorrhea in these patients.},

In our study we tested with enzyme-linked immunoabsorbent assay test (ELISA) the antibody serum level to cow's milk and soy proteins in 123 children. The following patients were included in the study: 30 children with cow's milk enteropathy (CME), 27 children with soy proteins intolerance (SI), 19 coeliac children on gluten containing diet (CD), 9 coeliac children on gluten free diet (GFD) and 50 healthy sex and age matched control children. All coeliac patients had assumed cow's milk and soy proteins at the moment of the test or a few days before. Higher antibody serum level was found in coeliac disease to both cow's milk and soy proteins and in cases with cow's and soy allergy, than in control cases. The highest mean value of cow's milk and soy proteins antibodies have been found in the untreated coeliac children (CD), also higher than in the two groups of specific allergy. In treated coeliac children (GFD) with normalized jejunal mucosa cow's milk and soy proteins antibodies was normal. None of the 19 CD with high cow's milk and soy proteins antibodies level showed clinical intolerance to cow's milk and soy proteins.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS)},

Out of the 15 children aged younger than 13 years 9 are on a strict diet. Semistrict diet has an impact on gliadin antibody levels respectively. Serum ferritin levels of those on a normal diet are significantly lower than those of the control group. Out of the 25 lactose breath tests 7 showed abnormal results, irrelevant both to the strictness of the diet and to gliadin antibody levels. In the view of weight and length percentiles there is no difference at present between those eating normal food and diet. Nevertheless, with regards to the risk of malignancy in coeliac disease the necessity of a strict diet must be stressed. In long term follow-up the levels of gliadin antibodies and of serum ferritin are of pathognostic importance.},

In 1989 Holmes attributed a protective role to GFD with regard to the development of malignancy in untreated CD. Gluten sensitivity is in general an asymptomatic condition. The identification of subclinical cases is becoming a major topic of current interest. Defining high-risk groups for coeliac disease is mandatory. The evaluation of small-intestine biopsies (SIB), however, is much more complicated, as was suggested in the past. Recognition of the Corazza sign and rediscovery of the endoscopic guided capsule may well be of help. Screening patients with a high-risk of CD with a minimal number of tests prior to SIB makes more and more sense. Therefore intestinal permeability tests might be helpful. GFD appears simple, but in practice it represents a challenge to patients, dietitians and physicians. Management of coeliac disease seems much more complicated, as was thought in the early 1980s.},

Bile acid concentration, and bicarbonate and lipase excretions in the octreotide group decreased to 1/3-1/4 that of controls. Bile acid concentration became 0 mM for 60 minutes. Fecal fat excretion increased; obvious steatorrhea occurred in 2 cases. Fecal bile acid excretion decreased to about 1/4. These results suggest that decreases in bile acid secretion should be considered, as well as pancreatic lipase and bicarbonate secretions, when fatty stool occurs after octreotide administration.},

True food allergy involving an immunological mechanism is less common; these allergies affect approximately 10% of the United States population. Most food allergies are immunoglobulin E-mediated; systemic anaphylaxis is the most serious complication. Diagnosis is based on history and physical examination. In vivo diagnostic studies involve skin testing and food challenges (blinded and unblinded). In vitro testing (most commonly radioallergosorbent test [RAST]) is widely used. Treatment is best accomplished by identifying and avoiding the offending allergen.},

   abstract = {The purpose of this study was to investigate interdigestive cycling and postprandial release of pancreatic polypeptide (PP) in relation to exocrine pancreatic function in chronic pancreatitis (CP). We investigated nine patients with mild-moderate CP (MCP), eight patients with severe CP and steathorrea (SCP), and 17 healthy subjects as controls. Interdigestive antroduodenal motility was monitored by means of manometry. Following two consecutive motility cycles, a standard test meal was administered. Plasma samples were drawn for PP determinations every 15 min throughout the entire study, which concluded 2 hr after ingestion of the meal. Mean interdigestive PP plasma concentrations during phase III motor activity were lower in MCP (146 +/- 46 pg/ml) than in controls (270 +/- 42 pg/ml) and lower still in SCP (55 +/- 8 pg/ml). Accordingly, the percent increase in PP concentrations during phase III over those in phase I was progressively decreased from controls (112%) to MCP (62%) to SCP (19%). Mean interdigestive PP concentrations were also lower during phase I and II in SCP than in controls or MCP. None of the postprandial parameters for PP release was affected in the early stage of disease, while mean, peak, and integrated postprandial values were significantly lower in SCP than in controls or MCP. Thus, we observed a progressive diminution of both interdigestive and postprandial PP release with increasing severity of disease. Interdigestive release parameters, in particular, were tightly correlated with exocrine function. CP appears to alter interdigestive PP release to a greater extent than postprandial PP release; this effect is already apparent in early stages of the disease.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS)},

On oral provocation, 18 children exhibited a positive response to wheat, three to rye, one to barley, and one to oats. Cereal-induced symptoms were dermatologic, gastrointestinal, or oropharyngeal, and their onset after provocation was immediate (eight cases), delayed (14 cases), or both immediate and delayed (one case). A combination of type I allergy tests (prick test, RAST, and histamine-release test) detected all immediate reactors and 9/14 delayed reactors. Of the five subjects remaining negative in these tests, three were positive in the patch or lymphocyte-proliferation tests. Subjects with cereal allergy or intolerance frequently possessed IgE, IgA, and IgG antibodies against gliadin, but only one of these children was HLA-DR3-positive, and none had reticulin antibodies typical of celiac disease. Combining tests of immediate and delayed hypersensitivity can confirm allergy to cereals in a more reliable way. The coexistence of cereal allergy and celiac disease seems to be rare.},

Using an indirect immunofluorescent method, we evaluated the kinetics of the antibody titers both during a gluten-free diet and after gluten was added, comparing them with the intestinal histological pattern. The IgA-EmA titers were evaluated on sera from 91 untreated adults with biopsy-proven celiac sprue and, when positive, were reappraised after different durations of gluten-free diet. Antibody titers were also retested in eight adolescents who had voluntarily discontinued the diet while they were on a free diet. The IgA-EmAs were detectable in 85 of 91 (93.40%) patients but in none of the 438 controls (100% specificity). The antibody titers ranged from 1:5 to 1:2,000 or more and the intestinal histopathological pattern paralleled the antibody titers. After gluten withdrawal, IgA-EmA titers declined to zero in all patients complying with their diet. Modifications in gut histopathologic condition paralleled IgA-EmA kinetics, although seroconversion to negativity preceded mucosal recovery. After a gluten rechallenge, deterioration in gut histopathologic condition followed EmA reversion to positivity. Three negative IgA-EmA tests did not reflect a worsening in gut histopathologic condition after a gluten-containing diet, thus making the diagnosis of celiac sprue uncertain.},

   abstract = {Both gastric preloads and exogenous cholecystokinin (CCK) administration inhibit food intake, and combinations of preloads and CCK suppress feeding to a greater degree than either stimulus delivered alone. A role for the vagus nerve in mediating CCK's inhibition of food intake has been proposed, and gastric vagal afferent fibers respond to both gastric loads and local CCK infusions. To examine whether combined load and CCK stimuli may synergistically augment gastric neural afferent activity at the level of the peripheral vagus, we have examined the gastric vagal afferent responses (n = 8) to a range of gastric saline loads (1, 2, and 3 ml) and exogenous close celiac arterial CCK (10 and 100 pmol) when administered alone or in combination. Gastric loads ineffective in eliciting a significant increase in vagal afferent activity when administered alone became effective when combined with doses of CCK that were subthreshold for the production of a vagal afferent response. Gastric loads that alone were effective in producing a significant vagal afferent response yielded an even greater response when administered in combination with both subthreshold and suprathreshold doses of CCK. These data demonstrate that, in rats, signals produced by combined gastric load and exogenous CCK administration are integrated peripherally and interact synergistically. These results suggest that signals arising from the vagus may provide sufficient information for the synergistic inhibition of food intake produced by combinations of gastric loads and exogenous CCK.},

   abstract = {The classical clinical picture of coeliac disease includes prolonged diarrhoea with failure to thrive. During the past two decades this type of active presentation of coeliac disease has decreased in many European countries, giving the impression that coeliac disease is a disappearing disease. However, this is not true. The disease can be found in older children with a more or less silent presentation. Silent coeliac disease can be detected by active screening with serological tests. Coeliac disease can be suspected in children suffering from mild gastrointestinal symptoms, such as abdominal pain, and in those with signs of nutritional deficiencies, as well as in children of first-degree relatives of already diagnosed coeliacs, patients with IgA-deficiency, patients suffering from dental enamel hypoplasia or dermatitis herpetiformis, and patients with some other disease known to be associated with coeliac disease, such as diabetes mellitus. According to the fundamental criteria of coeliac disease, the intestinal mucosa is flat when the individual is eating gluten-containing foods. However, this is not strictly true. Intolerance to gluten is obviously variable and the intestinal mucosa may be normal. This type of latent coeliac disease can be detected by analysing genetic markers, measuring antibodies in intestinal fluid or counting the density of intra-epithelial gamma/delta T cells which are increased greatly even in the latent phase of coeliac disease. Thus the general concept of the natural history of coeliac disease is changing.},

However, information about the ability to detect stenotic lesions is lacking. The aim of our study was to determine the accuracy of Duplex scanning in detecting angiographically proven lesions. Twenty normal volunteers (13 males and seven females) and 24 patients (19 males and five females) with visceral artery stenosis on angiography were examined in the supine position (angle of insonation 60.5) with colour flow Duplex imaging (CFDI) (3.5 MHz probe), in the fasting state and after a standard meal at 15, 40, 60 and 90 min. Peak systolic velocity (PSV) and end diastolic velocity (EDV) were determined in both CA and SMA. The PSV was the best indicator of stenosis. After the meal, there was an increase in both PSV and EDV but neither of the postprandial measurements improved the accuracy of the test. The results indicate that CFDI can detect the presence of significant stenosis (> 50% in the CA and SMA with a sensitivity and specificity of > 80%.},

Celiac disease belongs to the former, the temporary food sensitive enteropathies of early childhood to the latter. A food sensitive enteropathy is characterized by an abnormal small intestinal mucosa while having the offending food in the diet; the abnormality is reversed by an elimination diet, only to recur once more on challenge with the relevant food. These disorders are temporary and may follow gastroenteritis. Cow's milk sensitive enteropathy is the most frequent and best known example but soy protein, egg, fish, chicken meat, ground rice and probably gluten may also temporarily damage the small intestinal mucosa in infancy. Treatment is with an elimination diet and protein hydrolysates as a cow's milk substitute. The reason why these enteropathies are temporary has not yet been established.},
