   abstract = {The provision of food is thought to promote the maintenance of gut integrity. Nutrients are able to elicit and affect both systemic and mucosal immune responses. Enteral diet therapy has long been known to be efficacious in inflammatory bowel disease (IBD), particularly in childhood Crohn's disease. However, the mechanisms of action of these diets are not clear. Nutritional repletion, direct effects on the gut mucosa or decreased intestinal permeability have all been postulated as being important in nutritional therapy. There is some evidence that the enteral diet has a direct effect on the gut mucosa by reducing cytokine production and the accompanying inflammation, thus leading to decreased intestinal permeability. Modifications of enteral diet composition have been evaluated in many studies. Such modifications include fat and/or protein content and the addition of bioactive peptides. The fatty acid composition of the enteral diet seems to have a much greater impact on its efficacy than modification of the N source. As specific fatty acids are precursors of inflammatory mediators derived from arachidonic acid, the reduction in these components may be beneficial in nutritional therapy for IBD. Addition of bioactive peptides to enteral diet formulas may also have a role; such peptides may have specific growth factor or anti-inflammatory actions. There is still much work to be done to define disease-specific enteral diet formulas that are effective as therapies for both Crohn's disease and ulcerative colitis.},

   abstract = {OBJECTIVE: Patients with Crohn's disease (CD) have increased energy expenditure and fat oxidation. Steroids, commonly used to treat flare-up of CD, induce weight gain. This study was designed to evaluate the effects of prednisone and budesonide on energy expenditure and substrate oxidation in patients with CD. METHODS: Twenty-nine women with CD and 10 healthy controls were studied. Ten patients received prednisone (0.75-1.0 mg/kg/day), nine received budesonide (9 mg/ day), and 10 did not receive steroids. Resting energy expenditure and substrate oxidation were measured by indirect calorimetry in a fasting state and after a standard diet. RESULTS: In the fasting state, resting energy expenditure was higher in patients without steroids than in the controls. Lipid oxidation was lower (p < 0.01) in patients with prednisone (0.46 +/- 0.39 mg/kg/min) than in patients with budesonide (0.97 +/- 0.28 mg/kg/min) and without steroids (1.06 +/- 0.32 mg/kg/min), but was similar with control subjects (0.47 +/- 0.20 mg/kg/min). Postprandially, lipid oxidation was lower (p < 0.01) in patients with prednisone (0.32 +/- 0.23 mg/kg/min) than in patients with budesonide (0.75 +/- 0.20 mg/kg/min), without steroids (0.82 +/- 0.23 mg/kg/min), and controls (0.58 +/- 0.15 mg/kg/min). Protein oxidation was significantly higher in patients with prednisone than in the other subjects. CONCLUSIONS: In women with CD, prednisone decreases lipid oxidation and increases protein oxidation. These effects are not observed with budesonide and may contribute to the weight gain and side effects commonly observed with prednisone. A low-fat/high-protein diet could be proposed during a course of prednisone.},

   abstract = {BACKGROUND: The standard evaluation of a patient with iron deficiency anemia includes a complete evaluation of the gastrointestinal tract to identify a source of bleeding. However, even after a careful examination, many patients remain without a diagnosis. Because iron deficiency anemia results from iron loss or defective absorption, we sought to determine the prevalence of potential gastrointestinal sources for iron deficiency anemia in patients without gastrointestinal symptoms. METHODS: Over a 10-month period, 668 outpatients were referred to the University Hematology Department with iron deficiency anemia, defined by a hemoglobin concentration less than 14 g/dL (less than 12 g/dL in women), mean corpuscular volume less than 80 fL, and ferritin level less than 30 microg/L. After excluding patients with obvious causes of blood loss, inadequate diet, chronic diseases, or malignancies, there were 81 eligible patients, 10 of whom refused investigation. The remaining 71 patients (51 women, median age 59 years) underwent colonoscopy, as well as gastroscopy with gastric (antrum and body) and duodenal biopsies. RESULTS: A likely cause of iron deficiency anemia was detected in 60 patients (85%). Diseases associated with bleeding were found in 26 patients (37%), including colon cancer (10 patients), gastric cancer (2), peptic ulcer (7), hiatal hernia with linear erosions (5), colonic vascular ectasia (3), colonic polyps (2), and Crohn's disease (1). Causes not associated with bleeding were found in 36 patients (51%), including 19 with atrophic gastritis, 4 with celiac disease, and 13 with Helicobacter pylori gastritis. Six (8%) patients had coincident gastrointestinal findings, and 11 (15%) had no cause identified. Patients with an identified nonbleeding-associated cause were younger than those with a bleeding-associated cause (median, 56 vs 70 years; P = 0.001) and included 59% of women (n = 30) versus 30% of men (n = 6) (P = 0.04). Hemoglobin level was not related to the site and severity of disease. CONCLUSION: Gastrointestinal diseases that do not usually cause bleeding are frequently associated with iron deficiency anemia in patients without gastrointestinal symptom or other potential causes of gastrointestinal bleeding.},

It is related both to undernutrition and to direct effects of the inflammatory process on the growth axis. Enteral nutrition (elemental, semi-elemental or polymeric diet) employed as the sole source of nutrition remains a mainstay of treatment of active Crohn's disease because it corrects nutritional deficits, has anti-inflammatory effects, heals mucosal inflammation and stimulates growth. Conventional corticosteroids have adverse effects on growth and preliminary data suggest that an ileal-release preparation of budesonide may also suppress linear growth. 6-Mercaptopurine (6-MP) and its prodrug azathioprine maintain remission in children with Crohn's disease. These treatments thus have the potential to improve growth velocity and final adult height.},

Immunologic, environmental, infective and genetic factors equally can play role in their development. Antibodies to an oligomannose epitope of the Saccharomyces cerevisiae demonstrated in 60-70% of the patients with Crohn's disease. The origin and the clinicopathological role are not clarified. It is important that there are no surveys with patients suffering in gluten sensitive enteropathy in the literature. As there are no ASCA survey in Hungary, the aim of this study was to determine the prevalence of the ASCA. The authors examined at their patients the ASCA's occurrence and compared with the clinical picture of the Crohn's disease. The results supported the theory that ASCA positivity correlates with small intestines' Crohn's disease and in these cases both the IgG and IgA type antibodies proved. The antibodies in the sera at the analyzed ASCA positive cases prove a systemic immune response against Saccharomyces cerevisiae and the authors suggest the end of the oral tolerance against the yeast's antigens. The diet restriction (elemental diet, total parenteral nutrition, and fecal diversion) may ameliorate the status of the patients with Crohn's disease. It is speculated that the yeast-free diet as a part of the therapy for the ASCA positive patients can be reasonable: moreover the permanent "forbidding" of the yeast can be an acceptable alternative in case of getting well.},

The reasons for the discrepancies in the findings could be related to the different study designs, different treatments, overlapping of treatment effects, as well as the variety of treatment formulations and doses used, which have led to results that are, in certain instances, very difficult to explain. Emphasis on a treatment formulation which reduces the incidence of side effects, together with careful selection of patients and experimental design, seems to be associated with benefits, and these studies point to the therapeutic potential for these lipids in the therapy of IBD. It is possible that these fatty acids act by reducing low-grade active inflammation rather than by preventing reinitiation of the inflammatory process from a truly quiescent state. Whether this treatment is applicable to all IBD patients has not been fully elucidated. Nevertheless, taken together, all these studies suggest the effectiveness of these new therapeutic approaches, not only when conventional treatment fails or when it is not possible to treat chronically, but also, in some instances, as first choice.},

   abstract = {BACKGROUND AND AIMS: Tumour necrosis factor alpha (TNF-alpha) plays a key role in the pathogenesis of intestinal inflammation in Crohn's disease. The effect of bacteria on TNF-alpha release by intestinal mucosa was investigated. METHODS: Ileal specimens were obtained at surgery from 10 patients with Crohn's disease (ileal stricture) and five disease controls undergoing right hemicolectomy (caecal cancer). Mucosal explants from each specimen were cultured for 24 hours with either non-pathogenic Escherichia coli, Lactobacillus casei DN-114001, L bulgaricus LB10, or L crispatus (each study contained blank wells with no bacteria). Tissue and bacterial viability was confirmed by lactate dehydrogenase (LDH) release and culture. Concentrations of TNF-alpha were measured in supernatants and the phenotype of the intestinal lymphocytes was analysed by flow cytometry. RESULTS: Coculture of mucosa with bacteria did not modify LDH release. Release of TNF-alpha by inflamed Crohn's disease mucosa was significantly reduced by coculture with L casei or L bulgaricus; changes induced by L crispatus or E coli were not significant. The effect of L casei and L bulgaricus was not prevented by protease inhibitors. Coculture with L casei and L bulgaricus reduced the number of CD4 cells as well as TNF-alpha expression among intraepithelial lymphocytes from Crohn's disease mucosa. None of the bacteria induced changes in non-inflamed mucosa. CONCLUSIONS: Probiotics interact with immunocompetent cells using the mucosal interface and modulate locally the production of proinflammatory cytokines.},

   abstract = {Inflammatory bowel disease (IBD) comprises two chronic, tissue-destructive, clinical entities Crohn disease (CD) and ulcerative colitis (UC) both apparently caused by immunological overreaction (hypersensitivity) to commensal gut bacteria. Under normal conditions the intestinal immune system shows a down-regulating tone ('oral tolerance') against dietary antigens and the indigenous microbiota. This local homeostasis is disturbed in IBD, leading to hyperactivation of T helper 1 (Th1) cells with abundant secretion of interferon-gamma and tumor necrosis factor (TNF) and production of IgG antibodies against commensal bacteria. In addition, UC includes genetically determined autoimmunity, particularly IgG1-mediated cytotoxic epithelial attack. Breaching of the epithelium is the best-defined event underlying abrogation of oral tolerance, but immune deviation caused by cytokines fiom irritated epithelial cells or subepithelial elements (for example, mast cells, natural killer cells, macrophages) may also be involved. Endogenous infection with local hypersensitivity likewise causes periodontal disease, reflecting 'frustrated' immune elimination mechanisms entertained by antigens from dental plaque. Altogether, perturbation of a tightly controlled cytokine network, with abnormal crosstalk between several cell types, apparently explains the progressive immunopathology of chronic inflammatory mucosal diseases in general. This adverse development will be influenced by numerous immunity genes, the dosage and potential pathogeniciy of commensal bacteria, general health, nutritional status, and psychological factors. Several targets for new therapy have tentatively been identified to block immunopathological mechanisms in IBD, and inhibition of TNF has a striking beneficial effect in CD, supporting a central role of this cytokine.},

   abstract = {Ulcerative colitis and Crohn's disease (together known as Inflammatory Bowel Disease or IBD) are both associated with increased risk for colorectal cancer. Although it is conventional to emphasise differences between IBD-associated and sporadic colon cancer, such as a lower rate of Adenomatosis Polyposis Coli mutations and earlier p53 mutations, IBD-associated cancer has a similar dysplasia-cancer sequence to sporadic colon cancer, similar frequencies of major chromosomal abnormalities and of microsatellite instability and similar glycosylation changes. This suggests that IBD-associated colon cancer and sporadic colon cancer might have similar pathogenic mechanisms. Because the normal colon is arguably in a continual state of low-grade inflammation in response to its microbial flora, it is reasonable to suggest that both IBD-associated and sporadic colon cancer may be the consequence of bacteria-induced inflammation. We have speculated that the glycosylation changes might result in recruitment to the mucosa of bacterial and dietary lectins that might otherwise pass harmlessly though the gut lumen. These could then lead to increased inflammation and/or proliferation and thence to ulceration or cancer. The glycosylation changes include increased expression of onco-fetal carbohydrates, such as the galactose-terminated Thomsen-Friedenreich antigen (Gal beta1,3GalNAc alpha-), increased sialylation of terminal structures and reduced sulphation. These changes cannot readily be explained by alterations in glycosyltransferase activity but similar changes can be induced in vitro by alkalinisation of the Golgi lumen. Consequences of these changes may be relevant not only for cell-surface glycoconjugates but also for intracellular glycoconjugates.},

Decreased oral intake, malabsorption, accelerated nutrient losses, increased requirements, and drug-nutrient interactions cause nutritional and functional deficiencies that require proper correction by nutritional therapy. The goals of the different forms of nutritional therapy are to correct nutritional disturbances and to modulate inflammatory response, thus influencing disease activity. Total parenteral nutrition has been used to correct and to prevent nutritional disturbances and to promote bowel rest during active disease, mainly in cases of digestive fistulae with high output. Its use should be reserved for patients who cannot tolerate enteral nutrition. Enteral nutrition is effective in inducing clinical remission in adults and promoting growth in children. Due to its low complication rate and lower costs, enteral nutrition should be preferred over total parenteral nutrition whenever possible. Both present equal effectiveness in primary therapy for remission of active Crohn's disease. Nutritional intervention may improve outcome in certain individuals; however, because of the costs and complications of such therapy, careful selection is warranted, especially in patients presumed to need total parenteral nutrition. Recent research has focused on the use of nutrients as primary treatment agents. Immunonutrition is an important therapeutic alternative in the management of inflammatory bowel diseases, modulating the inflammation and changing the eicosanoid synthesis profile. However, beneficial reported effects have yet to be translated into the clinical practice.

   abstract = {Several reports have indicated that fecal elastase-1 (EL-1) determination is a new, sensitive, and specific noninvasive pancreatic function test; however, very few patients with malabsorption due to small intestine diseases have been included in the previous studies. The aim of the study was to compare the diagnostic accuracy of fecal EL-1 and fecal chymotrypsin (FCT) in distinguishing between pancreatic maldigestion and intestinal malabsorption. Three groups of subjects were studied: group A included 49 patients with known cystic fibrosis (25 males, median age 5 years); group B included 43 subjects with various small intestine diseases (17 males, median age 6 years); and group C included 45 children without any history of gastrointestinal disease (22 males, median age 5 years). In all patients, stools were collected for 72 h on a standard diet and fecal EL-1, FCT, and steatocrit tests were performed. Both EL-1 and FCT were below normal limits in all CF patients with pancreatic maldigestion not treated with pancreatic enzyme (100% sensitivity for both assays); El-1, but not FCT, was also below normal in all the CF patients with pancreatic maldigestion treated with pancreatic extracts. Both EL-1 and FCT values in the CF group were significantly lower than in subjects with various small intestinal diseases and in children without any history of gastrointestinal disease (P < 0.0001). FCT, but not EL-1, values showed an inverse statistically significant correlation with steatocrit values in the whole CF group (P < 0.001); FCT was below normal in three of four CF patients with steatorrhea on pancreatic enzyme therapy. Both EL-1 and FCT had 100% specificity when calculated in children without any history of gastrointestinal disease; in contrast, specificity was 86% for EL-1 and 76% for FCT if we considered the control group with small intestinal diseases: low EL-1 was observed in two cases of intestinal giardiasis, two cases of short bowel syndrome, one case of celiac disease, and one case of intestinal pseudobstruction; FCT was abnormal in four cases of intestinal giardiasis, three cases of celiac disease, one case of short bowel syndrome, one case of Crohn's disease, and one case of intestinal pseudobstruction. Diagnostic accuracy was 92% for fecal EL-1 and 82% for FCT. Steatocrit values were over the normal limit in 11 patients with small intestine diseases; in 7/11 of these patients at least one of the pancreatic test results was below the normal limit. In conclusions, in patients with CF, fecal EL-1 determination is not more sensitive than FCT in identifying pancreatic maldigestion; however, fecal EL-1 assay is more specific than FCT determination in distinguishing pancreatic maldigestion from intestinal malabsorption.},

   abstract = {Growth failure (GF) is one of the major complications affecting children with inflammatory bowel disease. The faltering is temporary in 40-50% of cases and prolonged in 10-20% in Crohn's disease (CD). Such failure is rare in children with ulcerative colitis (5%). This complication is often associated with retarded bone development and delayed onset of sexual maturation. The delayed linear growth has a variety of causes including insufficient intake due to anorexia and the inflammatory process with increased energy and protein expenditure. Other factors are increased intestinal loss, secondary hypopituitarism and treatment with steroids. Therapeutic strategies of CD in children have changed this last decade by introducing new therapeutic agents such as topic steroids, immunosuppressors, anti-TNF (antibody and notably in children enteral nutrition which has shown its efficacy in inducing remissions of active CD, restoring nutritional status and stimulation of linear growth. The results of a recent prospective multicentric study over 2 years in 82 CD show that severe GF (-2 SD) is initially present in 15% (n = 12), among them 11 remain < -2SD after 2 years of follow-up. Six patients who were on the normal range initially increased their GF during the follow-up (< -2SD) (total 21% < -2SD (n = 17) at 2 years). At inclusion in this group there was no difference in growth velocity, used of steroids, enteral nutrition or severity of CD as compared to the group with no GF. It suggests that new treatment strategy should be developed in the future for this specific complication of paediatric CD.},

   abstract = {A number of theories regarding the aetiology of Crohn's disease have been proposed. Diet, infections, other unidentified environmental factors and immune disregulation, all working under the influence of a genetic predisposition, have been viewed with suspicion. Many now believe that Crohn's disease is a syndrome caused by several aetiologies. The two leading theories are the infectious and autoimmune theories. The leading infectious candidate is Mycobacterium avium subspecies paratuberculosis (Mycobacterium paratuberculosis), the causative agent of Johne's disease, an inflammatory bowel disease in a variety of mammals including cattle, sheep, deer, bison, monkeys and chimpanzees. The evidence to support M. paratuberculosis infection as a cause of Crohn's disease is mounting rapidly. Technical advances have allowed the identification and/or isolation of M. paratuberculosis from a significantly higher proportion of Crohn's disease tissues than from controls. These methodologies include: (i) improved culture techniques; (ii) development of M. paratuberculosis-specific polymerase chain reaction assays; (iii) development of a novel in situ hybridization method; (iv) efficacy of macrolide and anti-mycobacterial drug therapies; and (v) discovery of Crohn's disease-specific seroreactivity against two specific M. paratuberculosis recombinant antigens. The causal role for M. paratuberculosis in Crohn's disease and correlation of infection with specific stratification(s) of the disorder need to be investigated. The data implicating Crohn's as an autoimmune disorder may be viewed in a manner that supports the mycobacterial theory. The mycobacterial theory and the autoimmune theory are complementary; the first deals with the aetiology of the disorder, the second deals with its pathogenesis. Combined therapies directed against a mycobacterial aetiology and inflammation may be the optimal treatment of the disease.},

Corticosteroids, commonly used to control exacerbations, appear to be a major risk factor for subsequent development of osteoporosis. Exclusion diets, avoiding foods that precipitate symptoms, frequently allow control of the disease avoiding the use of corticosteroids and may thereby reduce the risk of osteoporosis. To investigate this we performed bone mineral density measurements of the proximal femur and spine in 95 patients, 31 treated predominately by corticosteroids, 33 by dietary manipulation with a low life-time corticosteroid dose and 31 by treatments other than diets but also with a low life-time corticosteroid dose. In both groups with a low life-time corticosteroid dose bone mineral density was comparable to that of age-matched normal controls, whereas bone mineral density was significantly reduced in those treated predominately by corticosteroids. We conclude that corticosteroid therapy is an independent risk factor for osteoporosis in patients with Crohn's disease and should be used as little as possible.},

We evaluated our experience with this procedure in the adolescent population. METHODS: All adolescents undergoing ileocolic resection for Crohn disease during a 3-year period were retrospectively reviewed. Intraoperative and early postoperative results were analyzed, comparing those undergoing the laparoscopic-assisted approach with those having open resection. RESULTS: Eleven patients (mean age, 15.6 years) underwent open and 12 patients (mean age, 16.5 years) underwent laparoscopic-assisted resection. None had undergone previous resection. The two groups did not differ with respect to time from diagnosis to surgery, indications for surgery, preoperative medical therapy, operative time, or length of intestine resected. One patient in the laparoscopic-assisted group was converted to an open procedure. There were no intraoperative complications in either group. Although no statistically significant differences were noted for number of days on narcotic, total dosage of narcotic, and time to regular diet, patients undergoing laparoscopic-assisted resection were discharged 2.2 days earlier (5.4 vs. 7.6; P < 0.05). There was one wound infection and one intraabdominal abscess in the open resection group, and a single patient in the laparoscopic-assisted group with postoperative fever and a wound infection. CONCLUSIONS: Laparoscopic-assisted ileocolic resection is a safe alternative to open surgery in adolescent patients with Crohn disease.},

Many of these young people develop psychological and social problems causing them to become invalids. Local surgery and conservative therapy in such aggressive cases of Crohn's disease presenting with recurring perianal fistulae and abscesses are often unsuccessful; the destruction of the proctium continues. The purpose of our study was to look at the outcome of our patients with regard to these aspects. We included all 56 patients suffering from Crohn's disease treated at our clinic from 1984 until 1991 in a retrospective study and focused on the 13 patients with anal manifestation. The mean follow-up was 15.8 years (3-28 years). Often there was no improvement of perianal disease without resection of the involved bowel, especially in cases where both the colon and the rectum were affected. Anal destruction went on. Seven of the 13 patients suffering from anal complications finally received an anus praeter. An previous bowel-resection or the construction of a temporary anus praeter seem to be necessary to protect the proctium irrespective of abdominal symptoms in patients with recurrent severe perianal Crohn's disease.},

   abstract = {BACKGROUND: Oxidative stress is believed to play a key role in the pathogenesis of inflammatory bowel disease (IBD)-related intestinal damage. Circulating antioxidants may have a role to play in preventing free radical-mediated tissue injury. METHODS: Plasma vitamin A, E and carotenoid concentrations, leukocytic genomic damage and 8-hydroxy-deoxy-guanosine (8-OHdG) concentration were determined in 46 ulcerative colitis (UC) patients, 37 Crohn disease (CD) patients and 386 controls. A 20 ml blood sample was taken from each subject for antioxidant and 8-OHdG measurements. A food frequency questionnaire was administered to a sample of subjects from each group to evaluate daily intake of dietary compounds. RESULTS: Antioxidant concentration was significantly reduced in IBD patients, particularly in those with active disease, with respect to controls (P < 0.0001). 8-OHdG concentrations were significantly increased in IBD patients compared to controls, independent of disease activity (P < 0.05). No correlation was found between antioxidant and 8-OHdG concentrations. Carotenoid concentrations were significantly reduced in malnourished IBD patients (0.89 +/- 0.14 micromol/l) compared to patients with normal or high body mass index (1.83 +/- 0.12 micromol/l; P < 0.05), independent of disease activity or extension. Protein, fruit and vegetable intakes of IBD patients were significantly lower than those of controls. CONCLUSIONS: Depletion of antioxidants is likely to be important in the pathophysiology of IBD: UC and CD patients show increased free radical peripheral leukocyte DNA damage and decreased plasma antioxidant defenses. These results indicate the necessity of further studies to establish whether optimal vitamin status may improve the clinical course of UC and CD.},

   abstract = {In short-term studies, both in animals and in humans, fish oil seems to exert anti-inflammatory effects. However, these effects may vanish during long-term treatment. There is a possibility that in autoimmune diseases, supplementation of dietary n-3 fatty acids might lead to a decrease in the number of autoreactive T cells via apoptosis, as demonstrated in (NZBXNZW) F1 lupus mice [40]. Thus, the "fade away" effect might be due to regrowth of pathogenic autoreactive cells. In animal models of autoimmune diseases, diets high in n-3 fatty acids from fish oil increase survival and reduce disease severity in spontaneous autoantibody-mediated disease, while n-6 linoleic acid-rich diets appear to increase disease severity. The situation in human disease is probably more complex. Some of the discrepancy between studies can be attributed to methodologic problems. The effect of fish oil is dose, time and disease-dependent. Since the anti-inflammatory effects depend on the balance between n-3 and n-6 fatty acids, the relative proportion of EPA and DHA and possibly co-treatment with dietary vitamin E, the dose/effect ratio may vary between individuals. Furthermore, some animal studies demonstrating efficacy used very high doses that may be incompatible with human consumption. It seems that fish oil is only mildly effective in acute inflammation. In those chronic inflammatory disorders where it was found to be effective, several weeks are necessary to exhibit results. Yet, this mild anti-inflammatory effect, possibly through downregulation of pro-inflammatory cytokine production, leads to striking therapeutic improvement in critically ill patients. Fish oil supplementation seems advantageous especially in acute and chronic disorders where inappropriate activation of the immune system occurs. Fish oil has only a mild effect on active inflammation of diseases such as rheumatoid arthritis, SLE and Crohn's disease, but it could prevent relapse (in some of the studies). In diseases where the inflammation is mild, such as IgA nephropathy, fish oil may slow or even prevent disease progression. The above could explain the observation in some populations of a decreased incidence of inflammatory and autoimmune diseases [3], since the constant consumption of n-3 fatty acids could suppress any autoreactive (or hyper-reactive) T cells. However, if there is already an existing disease, increased consumption might not be beneficial over a long period. Therefore, the use of n-3 fatty acids can be recommended to the general healthy population, not only to prevent atherosclerosis but possibly also to reduce the risk of autoimmunity.},

It is essential to provide an accurate diagnosis in children suspected of IBD, as the initial treatment of Crohn disease and ulcerative colitis in children is not the same as it is in adults. While the role of enteral feeding in the treatment of Crohn disease in adults continues to be controversial, there is firm evidence to support the use of enteral feeding as primary therapy for Crohn disease in children. Nutrition is improved by enteral feeding, and growth and pubertal development are promoted, while the systemic toxicity of corticosteroid therapy is avoided. Supplementary nocturnal enteral nutrition (with daytime intake of normal diet) after primary therapy and remission induction may be associated with the prolongation of remission. Drug treatment in children with IBD is characterized by a lack of evidence from controlled trials.},

   abstract = {Inflammatory bowel disease (IBD) still presents major challenges to the understanding of its cause, mechanisms of inflammation, and therapeutic choices to control the damaged tissue. Both types of IBD, ulcerative colitis and Crohn's disease, have been known and investigated for over half century but neither one is fully understood nor can be satisfactorily managed. While many gaps in our knowledge still exist, the last two decades have witnessed an unprecedented progress not only in the etiology but mainly in the mechanisms underlying the chronic inflammatory response. The pattern of IBD epidemiology has drastically changed since World War II, with an increased frequency in countries that have adopted a ''westernized'' life style. A parallel and important phenomenon is the continuous drop in age of onset in children. Unfortunately, only few epidemiological clues are available, with the exception of smoking and diet. What in smoking alters the course of IBD is still a mystery and which, among thousands of additives, could represent a risk factor will remain unknown for the foreseeable future. The current emphasis on the study of the enteric flora as the source of potential antigens against which the mucosal immune system reacts appear well justified. The data from animal models appears particularly convincing. Thus, after decades of relying almost exclusively on patient-derived information, numerous animal models are generating precious new information on IBD pathogenesis. In experimental IBD the genetic background of the animal markedly influences the course of the disease, and the same is probably true in humans. The identification of NOD2 as the first mutated gene associated with a subgroup of Crohn's disease patients is the first evidence that genetics are pointing to the right direction for understanding how the environment interacts with genes to cause IBD. For many years immunology has been the main source of scientific information on mechanisms of IBD. Cytokines, chemokines and other soluble factors dominate immunological studies aimed at understanding how different anti-inflammatory and pro-inflammatory mediators are improperly regulated and how immune imbalance can be restored. The extent to which T-cells live or die is also a key determinant of chronicity. In addition to classical immune cells, epithelial, endothelial, mesenchymal and nerve cells are slowly gaining more importance in IBD pathogenesis, as they contribute to the ultimate fate of tissue damage. Medical and surgical therapies are vastly better now that they were only a couple of decades ago, but they are still far from satisfactory. Steroid and aminosalicylates are still the most common drugs after 60 years of use, and it is time to renovate our therapeutic approach to a more effective one. The value of biologicals has been highlighted by the recent success of anti-TNF therapy. Timing of therapy must also change. The concept of the step-by-step approach is slowly fading away, and the idea of an ''all-out'' approach with multiple concomitant drugs early in the disease is gaining credibility. New reports on early aggressive therapies, and the demonstration that early and late experimental IBD are caused by different mechanisms are changing the way we think about managing IBD. Both ulcerative colitis and Crohn's disease will continue to challenge the medical establishment for year to come, but the possibility that IBD can be conquered is more realistic now that never before.},

   abstract = {Maintenance of adequate nutrition is of obvious importance in the management of patients with Crohn's disease. Exclusive parenteral nutrition can achieve high rates of remission, but this is not usually necessary since exclusive elemental and polymeric enteral regimes can yield similarly good results. Comparison of exclusive enteral formula feeding with steroid treatment favours steroids only because compliance is less complete for the restrictive nutritional regimes, and formula feeds should always be the first choice in the growing child with active Crohn's disease. It is probable that the nature of the lipid provided in Crohn's diets is clinically important, and there is some evidence that the n-3 fatty acids are beneficial. Continuation of nutritional supplements once remission has been obtained appears valuable even when malnutrition is not a major consideration.},

   abstract = {BACKGROUND: Crohn's disease and ulcerative colitis are chronic inflammatory bowel diseases of unknown etiology. Unspecific immunosuppressive therapy represents current standard treatment and is often associated with severe side effects. Several treatment regimens have been evaluated to identify alternative therapeutic options. Among these different diet therapies were investigated. Objective of this paper is to review the results of diet therapy in chronic inflammatory bowel disease on the basis of randomised controlled trials and meta-analysis of randomised controlled trials. METHODS: Medline and Cochrane Library were searched for meta-analysis and randomised controlled trials investigating this question. Additionally reference lists of identified articles and text books were checked for further trials. RESULTS: Four meta-analyses investigated the treatment of acute Crohn's disease with elemental-, semi-elemental-, and polymeric diets in comparison to corticosteroids or to another form of enteral diet. All meta-analyses show a superiority of corticosteroids and no difference in the effect of the compared enteral diets. Randomised controlled trials investigating diet therapy in ulcerative colitis have not been summarised in a meta-analysis yet. Eleven randomised trials were identified which evaluated diets in ulcerative colitis patients: Dietary supplementation with n-3-fatty acids (6 trials), elemental diet [2], dietary supplementation with dietary fiber [1], elimination diet [1], and dietary supplementation with olestra [1]. Only for the elimination diet a significant positive effect on the course of disease was found in one trial which investigated only 18 patients. CONCLUSIONS: Enteral nutritional therapy of acute Crohn's disease is less effective than treatment with corticosteroids. In case of severe steroid induced side effects diet treatment can present a promising alternative. Superiority of one of the investigated different formulations was not found. Meta-analyses of randomised trials provide a clear and easy to understand presentation of the effect of this intervention. Eleven published trials investigating the effect of diets in ulcerative colitis show only for elimination diet a positive treatment effect. The trials do find a positive effect of one of the other interventions but the trials are very small and cannot exclude a treatment effect. Meta-analysis of these trials would be helpful for a better presentation and understanding of these results.},

   abstract = {Nutritional derangements are frequent in inflammatory bowel disease. In the past year significant work has been published examining the mechanisms of impaired food intake in animal models of inflammatory bowel disease, which allow a better understanding of these processes. Data from the same laboratory have shed further light on the relative role of underfeeding and inflammation on the growth retardation associated with intestinal inflammation. Other studies have provided further data on the risk factors and predictive biomarkers of bone loss in patients with inflammatory bowel disease. The potential role of enteral nutrition as primary therapy for Crohn's disease is particularly addressed in this review. Recent contributions to the field emphasized the special importance of this modality of therapy in paediatric patients. The possible mechanisms for such a therapeutic action are not well understood. Other nutrients may have a therapeutic potential in inflammatory bowel disease. In particular, recent data on the in-vivo anti-inflammatory actions of butyrate merit special mention. Finally, novel nutritional therapeutic strategies for inflammatory bowel disease, such as transforming growth factor-beta2-enriched enteral feeding, or hydrothermally processed cereals have recently been explored.},

   abstract = {BACKGROUND: Dietary fat has been suggested to determine the therapeutic effect of enteral diets in Crohn's disease. AIM: To assess the efficacy of two whole protein based diets with different fat compositions (n6 polyunsaturated fatty acids v monounsaturated fatty acids) in inducing clinical remission in active Crohn's disease compared with steroids. METHODS: Sixty two patients with active Crohn's disease were randomised to receive, for not more than 4 weeks: (a) a polymeric enteral diet containing 35 g of lipids per 1000 kcal, high in oleate (79%) and low in linoleate (6.5%) (PEN1), (b) an identical enteral diet except for the type of fat which was high in linoleate (45%) and low in oleate (28%) (PEN2), or (c) oral prednisone (1 mg/kg/day). Diets were double blindly administered. The steroid group received a conventional ward diet. Treatment failure was considered when remission was not achieved at week 4. Clinical activity and biological and nutritional parameters were monitored. Independent predictors of remission were identified by stepwise logistic regression analysis. RESULTS: Overall remission rates (by intention to treat) were 20% (4/20) for PEN1, 52% (12/23) for PEN2, and 79% (15/19) for steroids (overall p=0.001; p<0.0005 steroids v PEN1, and p=0.056 PEN2 v PEN1). After excluding those patients who were non-compliant during the first week (per protocol analysis), remission rates were 27%, 63%, and 79%, respectively (p=0.008, steroids and PEN2 v PEN1). After adjusting for confounding variables, PEN1 remained significantly associated with a poor response. CONCLUSION: The type of dietary fat may be of importance for the primary therapeutic effect of enteral nutrition in active Crohn's disease.},

In contrast, nutrition plays no major role in the development of the disease or in provoking an acute attack. During an acute attack of Crohn's disease, the application of oral (drinks) or tube feeding (enteral nutrition) can result in a substantial clinical improvement. The remission rate of this side effect-free therapy is, however, lower than that seen with steroids. The data available for diet therapy in ulcerative colitis are less unequivocal, but the effects are probably slight at best. During the remission phase, the patient should eat a balanced, vitamin-rich and varied normal diet that excludes all poorly tolerated foods: lactose intolerance in particular appears to be increased in patients with Crohn's disease. Known vitamin or mineral deficiencies should be corrected by appropriate dietary measures or supplementation. There is no such thing as a "Crohn's diet" or "colitis diet". The patient can be allowed to eat anything that is tolerated.},

Proposed causes include bacterial or viral infection, diet or exposure to tobacco smoke, genetic abnormality, and immune dysfunction. The bacterium Mycobacterium avium subsp. paratuberculosis (Map) has received much research attention as a potential cause of the disease. Map causes Johne's disease in ruminants. The pathology of Johne's disease superficially resembles that of Crohn's disease in humans. Some researchers have shown evidence of Map in intestinal tissues of Crohn's disease patients. Studies are in progress to investigate the possibility that Map exists in milk from infected cows and survives pasteurization. This is a controversial subject with the potential for media attention and public outcry. We examined the current literature and concluded that insufficient evidence exists at this time to implicate any one factor, including Map in milk, as the definitive cause of Crohn's disease. The high degree of uncertainty in this issue requires regulators to recognize the need for effective risk communication as ongoing research provides additional information about the disease.},

   abstract = {OBJECTIVES: We examined the use of complementary alternative medicine (CAM) in children and young adults with inflammatory bowel disease. METHODS: After validation of a questionnaire and completion of a pilot survey, children and young adults with inflammatory bowel disease were enrolled in three centers of pediatric gastroenterology (Boston, Detroit, and London). RESULTS: Two hundred eight questionnaires were completed in total (Boston, 120; Detroit, 37; London, 51). Ages ranged from 3.8 to 23.0 yr, 58% were male, 57% had Crohn's disease, and 35% had ulcerative colitis. The frequency of CAM use was 41%. The most common CAMs were megavitamin therapy (19%), dietary supplements (17%), and herbal medicine (14%). Parental CAM use and the number of adverse effects from conventional medicines were predictors of CAM use (odds ratio = 1.9, 95% CI = 1.2-3.1, p = 0.02; odds ratio = 1.3, 95% CI = 1.2-1.5, p < 0.001, respectively). The most important reasons respondents gave for using CAM were side effects from prescribed medicines, prescribed medicines not working as well as they had hoped, and hoping for a cure. Fifty-nine percent of respondents not taking CAM were interested in learning more about it. CONCLUSIONS: In our survey over 40% of children with chronic inflammatory bowel disease used complementary medicine in addition to conventional therapies. Parental CAM use and number of adverse effects from conventional therapies were the only independent predictors of CAM use. Some complementary therapies have potential for adverse effects and for drug interactions with conventional treatments. Physicians should take a thorough history of CAM use in children with chronic inflammatory bowel disease.},

At 28 weeks' gestation, fetal ultrasonography showed an intracranial mass, which was seen to expand on serial ultrasound and magnetic resonance imaging studies. A hematoma was suspected, and, although the mother had no overt hemorrhagic manifestations, maternal vitamin K deficiency was diagnosed by enzyme immunoassay and corrected. After cesarean delivery at 36 weeks' gestation, the newborn was normal, but magnetic resonance imaging showed a chronic subdural hematoma. CONCLUSION: Maternal vitamin K deficiency in active Crohn disease might cause fetal hemorrhage. Monitoring of vitamin K status during pregnancy with Crohn disease seems warranted.},

In the Reha-Clinic "Ob der Tauber", Bad Mergentheim these patients are informed in special Colitis/Crohn-groups for eleven years now. Normally approximately ten patients with IBD are treated in our house at the same time. These patients participate in a nearly closed group in which they are taught in three weeks blocks. Three hours a week the patients are informed by doctors, one hour a week a diet assistant teaches the participants. The psychotherapeutic group takes place regularly once a week. The aim of the patient information or health education is to reach a mostly complete information of the patients about inflammatory bowel disease, that means to inform them about all diagnostic and therapeutic possibilities. Another important purpose of team work is the support of dynamic group processes like reduction of anxiety and the influence on the patients for developing an active positive attitude towards their disease. The participating therapist (doctors, psychotherapist, diet-assistant) have created a structured concept which was modified during the last years. Resulting from the interactive work between therapist and patients this concept is improved continuously. This development however is delayed by the shortcomming of bad personal capacities and the lack of possibilities for the therapist to improve their pedagogic and psychotherapeutic abilities. At the moment their education is based on autodidactic methods and empathy. For a standardization of the program including all hospitals the extended curriculum of the GRVS is useful. An evaluation concerning the therapeutic benefit of patient information has not been done yet.},

L/R ratio (lactulose/1-rhamnose urinary excretion ratio) is considered an indicator of permeability of the small intestine. An increased L/R ratio is caused by mucosal disorders of the small intestine. The L/R ratio in all patients (n = 92) with Crohn's disease was 0.079 +/- 0.081 (mean +/- S.D.), which was significantly higher than the value in normal controls (0.027 +/- 0.009, n = 20, p < 0.05). In 39 patients with Crohn's disease, we assessed intestinal permeability before after treatment with an elemental diet, and during remission. The L/R ratio was 0.120 +/- 0.092, before treatment and 0.065 +/- 0.097 after treatment (p < 0.05), showing increased intestinal permeability before elemental dietary treatment. During remission, the L/R ratio was 0.035 +/- 0.028; this did not differ significantly from the value obtained after treatment. We conclude that intestinal permeability is useful for investigating disease activity in patients with Crohn's disease.},

   abstract = {OBJECTIVE: Celiac disease (CD), or gluten sensitivity, is considered to be a state of heightened immunologic responsiveness to ingested gluten proteins in genetically predisposed individuals. The gastrointestinal manifestation suggests a severe enteropathy of the small intestine with malabsorption, steatorrhea, and weight loss because of a deranged mucosal immune response. Neurologic complications occur, especially epilepsy, possibly associated with occipital calcifications or folate deficiency and cerebellar ataxia. There have been reports of brain white-matter lesions as an extraintestinal manifestation in Crohn disease and ulcerative colitis but not in CD. METHODS: In this study, 75 diet-treated mainly pediatric patients with biopsy-proven CD underwent prospectively clinical neurologic examinations, laboratory investigations, electroencephalography, computed tomography, and magnetic resonance imaging. The age range was 2.8 to 24.2 years with a mean of 11.6 years. The mean period of gluten exposure was 2.4 years. RESULTS: Ten patients had neurologic findings such as febrile seizures, single generalized seizures, mild ataxia, and muscular hypotonia with retarded motor development. No folate deficiency was found. The hippocampal regions showed no abnormalities. Computed tomography did not reveal any cerebral calcifications, but magnetic resonance imaging detected unilateral and bilateral T2-hyperintensive white-matter lesions in 15 patients (20%). There was no correlation between these lesions and dietary compliance or neurologic or electroencephalographic abnormalities. The mean gluten exposure time of these patients was slightly increased (not significant). CONCLUSIONS: Focal white-matter lesions in the brain may represent an extraintestinal manifestation of CD. They may be ischemic in origin as a result of a vasculitis or caused by inflammatory demyelination. They seem to be more typical of pediatric CD than cerebral calcifications. Their prognostic value is unclear and needs to be elucidated in additional studies. CD should be suggested as a differential diagnosis in children with unclear white-matter lesions even without intestinal symptoms.},

   abstract = {BACKGROUND: Polymeric feeds have shown variable efficacy in active Crohn's disease (CD) with remission rates from 36% to 82%. Meta-analyses of elemental, peptide, and whole protein feeds have shown a strong negative correlation between remission rate in CD and the long chain triglyceride (LCT) content of the feed. We performed a randomised controlled double blind trial in patients with active CD comparing two single whole protein feeds with LCT supplying 5% or 30% of the total energy. METHODS: Fifty four patients with active CD (Crohn's disease activity index (CDAI) >200, serum C reactive protein (CRP) 10 mg/l) were randomised to a high or low LCT feed for three weeks. The total amount of energy supplied by fat was identical in the two feeds. Remission was defined as a CDAI < or =150 and response as a fall in CDAI of > or =70 or a CRP <10 mg/l. RESULTS: Overall remission rate by intention to treat was 26% for the low LCT feed and 33% for the high LCT feed (p=0.38). Response was achieved in 33% with the low LCT and in 52% with the high LCT feed (p=0.27). CRP <10 mg/l was achieved in 30% in the low LCT and 33% in the high LCT group (p=0.99). Thirty nine per cent (21/54) of patients withdrew before three weeks because of inability to tolerate the diet. Excluding patients unable to tolerate the diet, remission rates were 46% for low LCT and 45% for high LCT (p=0.99). DISCUSSION: This trial has shown no difference in the effect of low and high LCT whole protein feeds in active CD. The previously reported correlation between LCT content of diet and response in active CD is unlikely to be due to LCT itself and may be due to some other component of high LCT feeds.},

   abstract = {BACKGROUND: Ultrafine and fine particles are potent adjuvants in antigen-mediated immune responses, and cause inflammation in susceptible individuals. Following recent findings that microparticles accumulate in the phagocytes of intestinal lymphoid aggregates, this study is the first investigation of whether their reduction in the diet improves the symptoms of Crohn's disease. METHODS: In a double blind study, 20 patients with active corticosteroid-treated ileal or ileo-colonic Crohn's disease randomly received either a low microparticle diet (trial group; n = 10) or a control diet (n = 10) for 4 months. Crohn's disease activity index (CDAI) and corticosteroid requirements were compared. RESULTS: One patient in each group was withdrawn. In the trial group there was a progressive decrease in CDAI from entry (392 +/- 25) to month 4 (145 +/- 47) (P = 0.002 vs control group) and seven patients were in remission (CDAI <150). In contrast, the control group had returned to baseline levels (302 +/- 28 on entry and 295 +/- 25 at month 4), with none in remission. Corticosteroid intake was reduced more in the trial group although this did not reach significance. CONCLUSIONS: A low microparticle diet may be effective in the management of ileal Crohn's disease and could explain the efficacy of elemental diets, which similarly are low in microparticles.},

   abstract = {Crohn's disease is a modern Western disease characterised by transmural inflammation of the gastrointestinal tract. It is of unknown aetiology, but evidence suggests that it results from a combination of genetic predisposition and environmental factors. Bacterial-sized microparticles (0.1-1.0 microm) are potent adjuvants in model antigen-mediated immune responses and are increasingly associated with disease. Microparticles of TiO2 and aluminosilicate accumulate in macrophages of human gut-associated lymphoid tissue where the earliest signs of lesions in Crohn's disease are observed. Dietary microparticles are of endogenous or exogenous origin. Endogenous microparticles dominate and are calcium phosphate (most probably hydroxyapatite), which precipitates in the lumen of the mid-distal gastrointestinal tract due to secretion of Ca and phosphate in the succus entericus. Exogenous dietary microparticles are contaminants (soil and/or dust) and food additives. TiO2, for example, is a food colourant, and aluminosilicates are anti-caking agents, although some aluminosilicates occur as natural contaminants. Food additives alone account for ingestion of approximately 10(12) particles/person per d. Possible mechanisms for the role of exogenous and endogenous dietary microparticles in promoting toleragenic or immune responses of gastrointestinal mucosal phagocytosis are discussed. In a double-blind randomised pilot study we have shown that a diet low in Ca and exogenous microparticles appears to alleviate the symptoms of ileal Crohn's disease, with a significant (P= 0.002) improvement in the Crohn's disease activity index. A multi-centre trial and further mechanistic studies at the cellular level are underway.},

   abstract = {Diverticular disease is common in the elderly Western population and its complications are frequent clinical presentations. Despite this, the pathogenesis of the condition remains relatively poorly understood. Several theories have been developed, the most acceptable suggesting elastosis of the taeniae coli as the primary event, causing shortening of the sigmoid colon, with relative mucosal excess and subsequent mucosal herniations. A Western-type diet is implicated in the increased uptake of proline from the gut, leading to elastosis of the sigmoid colon. For pathologists, in clinical practice, the disease is most commonly seen in sigmoid colonic resection specimens, usually performed for complications of the disease. It is now realised that mucosal biopsies of the luminal mucosa, in the sigmoid colon affected by diverticular disease, can produce perplexing pathological changes. In particular diverticular colitis can mimic both ulcerative colitis and Crohn's disease: care should be taken when diagnosing chronic inflammatory bowel disease on a background of diverticular disease. For pathologists, diverticular disease remains something of an enigma: although common, its pathogenesis remains ill-defined and its complications can provide diagnostic difficulties, which require precise clinical and radiological correlation.},

Coeliac disease (classic and atypical form), Crohn's Disease and ulcerative colitis are considered as chronic autoimmune bowel diseases. The auto-antibodies can be detected with indirect immunofluorescence, ELISA and immunoblotting methods. In coeliac disease the autoantibodies against endomysium (tissue transglutaminase) and antibodies against gliadin are found in patient's sera. The auto-antibody detecting is helpful in establishing diagnosis, controlling gluten-free diet effectiveness and during gluten challenge. In Crohn's disease and ulcerative colitis immunological laboratory tests are helpful to confirm the clinical diagnosis. The following auto-antibodies are tested: against cytoplasm of exocrinal pancreatic cells, and products of these cells, against the neutrophile cytoplasm and against goblet cells. The antibodies against Saccharomyces cerevisiae are also investigated. The clinical relevance of above autoantibodies is not clear, but it is suggested that their presence correlates with exacerbations and severe clinical outcome. In the present study the pictures of autoantibodies from fluorescent microscope were shown.},

   abstract = {The aetiology and pathogenesis of Crohn's disease (CD) remain to be elucidated. In addition to genetic influences and immune mediated cytokine gene activation, various specific and non-specific environmental factors are considered to be associated with the induction and/or exacerbation of inflammatory bowel disease (IBD). The incidence of CD is higher in urban areas than in the rural, environment. Patients with CD have a higher dietary intake of sucrose, refined carbohydrates and (omega-6 fatty acids, and reduced intake of fruit and vegetables. Elemental and exclusion diets are known to be effective in CD. However, patients relapse on returning to a normal diet, which suggests that there is something in an ordinary diet which, on penetrating the mucosal defence mechanism of the terminal ileum, generates a pathogenic immune process. It has been suggested that the urban diet contains large quantities of inert inorganic non-nutrient microparticles, such as natural contaminants (soil and dust), food additives and anti-caking agents which may combine with intestinal luminal components such as bacterial cell wall lipopolysaccharides, to form antigenic particles. When these are taken up by mucosal mononuclear cells they can mediate immune reactions both locally in the mucosa and in the systemic circulation. In a study published in this issue of the journal, CD patients allocated to a low microparticle diet experienced a significant reduction in CD activity and the requirement for corticosteroids, when compared with the control group on a normal diet. The main advantage of the microparticle free diet, when compared with elemental and exclusion diets, is its enhanced tolerance by the patients and its relatively low cost. The preliminary results may give an explanation for the rising incidence of the disease in urban society. The results of an on-going multi-centre trial by the authors are awaited with interest.},

Alteration of bacterial flora, low antigenicity, low fat content and improvement of nutritional status are postulated to play a role in the anti-inflammatory effect of elemental diet. AIM: To determine whether elemental diet or its modifications has a direct anti-inflammatory effect on colonic tissue biopsies in vitro. PATIENTS AND METHODS: Colonic or ileal biopsies from 39 patients with inflammatory bowel disease and control patients were incubated for 24 hours with enteral diets in which nitrogen sources were amino acids as in elemental diet, casein or whey. Tissues were incubated with elemental diet, casein or whey, at dilutions of 1:5, 1:10 or 1:20 in Waymouth's complete medium; a medium control was also included. Tissue viability was assessed by bromodeoxyuridine uptake. Interleukin-1beta, interleukin-1 receptor antagonist and interleukin-10 concentrations in supernatants were measured by immunoassay (enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay). RESULTS: Incubation of tissues from Crohn's disease with elemental diet resulted in an increase in the ratio of interleukin-1 receptor antagonist/interleukin-1beta vs control statistically significant at 1:10 (89.6+/-17 vs 45.7+/-9. 1, p<0.05). Incubation of Crohn's tissue with casein resulted in a significant increase of interleukin-1 receptor antagonist/interleukin-1beta ratio at dilutions 1:20, 1:10 and 1:5 (101.8+/-22.0, p=0.05, 142.8+/-24.6, p<0.05; 109.7+/-25.0, p=0.05). In ulcerative colitis tissue and non-inflamed non-inflammatory bowel disease control tissue, no significant increase in interleukin 1 receptor antagonist/interleukin-1beta ratio was seen after incubation with elemental diet, casein and whey. CONCLUSION: Elemental diet incubation increases anti-inflammatory:proinflammatory cytokine ratio in Crohn's disease and this anti-inflammatory effect is not specifically due to amino acid composition, as diets containing casein have similar anti-inflammatory effects.},

Epidemiological studies have shown that ulcerative colitis tends to level off, whereas Crohn's disease tends to increase. Some of these changes may be due to diagnostic practices and increasing awareness of the disease and Crohn's colitis. The disease varies according to geographical location and a distribution along a north-south axis has been suggested. The differences may be due to study design, or may reflect differences in lifestyle, diet or be due to genetic predisposition triggered by environmental factors. Epidemiological studies designed to investigate such interactions may provide clues to its aetiology. Inflammatory bowel disease could, therefore, serve as a model for the importance of epidemiology when to test or reject the hypothesis of aetiology.},

   abstract = {Celiac disease patients display IgA antibody reactivity to wheat as well as to human proteins. We used serum IgA from celiac patients and, for control purposes, from patients with Crohn's disease, ulcerative colitis and from healthy individuals to identify celiac disease-specific IgA autoantigens in nitrocellulose-blotted extracts from various human cell types (epithelial, endothelial, intestinal cells, fibroblasts). The pattern, recognition intensity and time course of IgA autoreactivity was monitored using serial serum samples obtained from celiac children before and under gluten-free diet. By immunoblot inhibition and subcellular (cytosolic, nuclear) cell fractionation we identified a 55 kDa nuclear autoantigen expressed in intestinal, endothelial cells and in fibroblasts which was recognized by IgA antibodies of approximately half of the celiac disease patients and cross-reacted with wheat proteins. IgA reactivity to the 55 kDa autoantigen disappeared during gluten-free diet and was inhibited after pre-absorption of sera with wheat proteins but not with tissue transglutaminase, previously reported as the unique celiac disease-specific autoantigen. In conclusion, we defined a novel 55 kDa celiac disease-specific nuclear IgA autoantigen which shares epitopes with wheat proteins and which is different from tissue transglutaminase and calreticulin. Although the newly defined autoantigen was recognized much less frequently than tissue transglutaminase, our data suggest molecular mimicry between wheat and human proteins as a possible pathomechanism for the induction and/or maintenance of mucosal tissue damage in celiac disease.},

   abstract = {Measurements of luminal pH in the normal gastrointestinal tract have shown a progressive increase in pH from the duodenum to the terminal ileum, a decrease in the caecum, and then a slow rise along the colon to the rectum. Some data in patients with ulcerative colitis suggest a substantial reduction below normal values in the right colon, while limited results in Crohn's disease have been contradictory. Determinants of luminal pH in the colon include mucosal bicarbonate and lactate production, bacterial fermentation of carbohydrates and mucosal absorption of short chain fatty acids, and possibly intestinal transit. Alterations in these factors, as a result of mucosal disease and changes in diet, are likely to explain abnormal pH measurements in inflammatory bowel disease (IBD). It is conceivable that reduced intracolonic pH in active ulcerative colitis impairs bioavailability of 5-aminosalicylic acid from pH dependent release formulations (Asacol, Salofalk) and those requiring cleavage by bacterial azo reductase (sulphasalazine, olsalazine, balsalazide), but further pharmacokinetic studies are needed to confirm this possibility. Reports that balsalazide and olsalazine may be more efficacious in active and quiescent ulcerative colitis, respectively, than Asacol suggest that low pH may be a more critical factor in patients taking directly pH dependent release than azo bonded preparations. Reduced intracolonic pH also needs to be considered in the development of pH dependent colonic release formulations of budesonide and azathioprine for use in ulcerative and Crohn's colitis. This paper reviews methods for measuring gut pH, its changes in IBD, and how these may influence current and future therapies.},

In this study, the activities of the antioxidant metalloenzymes copper/zinc-superoxide dismutase (Cu/Zn-SOD) and selenium-glutathione peroxidase (Se-GPx) were determined in erythrocyte lysates from children with Crohn's disease. Both enzymes exhibited significantly lower activities relative to healthy control subjects: 1.55 +/- 0.33 vs 2.13 +/- 0.75 SOD U mg(-1) protein (p < 0.025) for Cu/Zn-SOD, and 61.9 +/- 17.7 vs 93.6 +/- 28.7 mU mg(-1) protein (p < 0.01) for Se-GPx. Treatment of patients with a specific polymeric diet, CT3211, for a period of 8 wk did not significantly alter the activities of the enzymes. In contrast, clinically, enteral nutritional therapy induced a remission in 13/14 children, and a significant fall in both median serum C-reactive protein and mean serum tumour necrosis factor-alpha levels. CONCLUSION: The results imply that the anti-inflammatory action of enteral nutrition in Crohn's disease is caused by a mechanism other than restitution of these antioxidant enzymes.},

   abstract = {Redistribution of white adipose tissue is a long-term symptom of several chronic diseases. Although the roles of adipocytes in acute illness have been thoroughly studied, how or why short-term responses of adipose tissue to disease sometimes produce long-term redistribution, and the causal relationship between the anatomical changes and the associated metabolic syndromes are poorly understood. The present paper reviews explanations for the redistribution of adipose tissue after infection with HIV, and in Crohn's disease; both conditions that share the peculiarity of selective expansion of certain adipose depots while others are depleted. HIV adipose tissue redistribution syndrome (HARS) develops gradually after several months of infection with the HIV both in untreated patients and in those taking protease inhibitors and nucleoside reverse transcriptase inhibitors. Some current theories about the causes of HARS are critically assessed, and reasons presented for implicating local interactions between the immune system and perinodal adipocytes. Some evolutionary aspects of conspicuous long-term changes in the distribution of human adipose tissue are discussed. Adipose tissue acts as a social signal, indicating dietary history and previous exposure to pathogens. A distinctive symptom of Crohn's disease is selective enlargement of the mesenteric adipose tissue near the diseased lymph nodes and intestine. Perinodal adipocytes have site-specific properties not found in adipocytes from nodeless depots, such as perirenal and epididymal, that may equip them to interact locally with lymph-node lymphoid cells, making polyunsaturated fatty acids selectively and rapidly available to activated immune cells. Studies of the time course of activation of perinodal adipocytes via the lymph nodes they enclose indicate that prolonged or frequent stimulation recruits more adipocytes to control by immune cells, which may lead to selective enlargement of node-containing depots. These concepts suggest hypotheses about HARS and the anomalous development of mesenteric adipose tissue in Crohn's disease that could form the basis for further investigations.},

It usually presents with rectal bleeding and may be difficult to distinguish clinically, endoscopically and pathologically from other segmental colitides including ulcerative, Crohn's, ischaemic, infective and NSAID-induced colitis as well as diverticulitis. Uncontrolled data suggests that most patients respond satisfactorily to treatment with a high fibre diet, antibiotics and/or aminosalicylates, but a minority with persistent or recurrent symptoms require sigmoid resection.

   abstract = {UNLABELLED: The objective of the presented work is to evaluate to what extent the CO2 production and O2 utilization and energy metabolism at rest (REE) are influenced by an excessive nutrient intake and to what extent by the composition of enteral nutrition. REE, CO2 production and O2 utilization were investigated in 9 patients on complete enteral nutrition by indirect calorimetry in four modifications: I--nutrition with 40% kJ fat in a ration 1.2x the energy output at rest at the onset of the trial; II--40% kJ and high energy intake (2.4x energy output at rest; III--60% kJ fat in ration of 1.2x energy output at rest; IV--60% kJ fat and energy intake 2.4x energy output at rest. At 40% (I) and 60% (III) fat content in a caloriocally adequate diet the energy output at rest, the CO2 production and O2 utilization did not differ (mean +/- SD: 1438 +/- 264.1 kcal/24 h, 179 +/- 31.6 nl/min, 209 +/- 38.1 ml/min vs. 1431 +/- 342.7, 190 +/- 54.2, 207 +/- 46.5). Comparison of modifications II and IV revealed a significant (p < 0.05) increase of CO2 production on a diet rich in carbohydrates (218 +/- 52.0 vs. 202 +/- 42.3). The energy output at rest (1674 +/- 389.6 vs. 1661 +/- 378.7), nor O2 production (240 +/- 54.5 vs. 242 +/- 55.4) changed. Overfeeding with 40% fat (II) as compared with (I) led to a rise of the energy output at rest (p < 0.05), O2 utilization (p < 0.05) and CO2 production (p < 0.01). Overfeeding with lipids (IV) led as compared with III to a rise of the energy output at rest and O2 utilization; CO2 production did not change. CONCLUSION: The composition of enteral nutrition according to the described modification does not influences the energy output at rest, O2 utilization and CO2 production under conditions of an adequate energy intake. In case of an excessive nutrient intake nutrition with 60% fat does not lead to an increase of CO2 production.},

   abstract = {BACKGROUND: The optimal dietary fat content to induce clinical remission in active Crohn's disease has been the subject of controversy. We therefore performed a prospective, randomized, controlled study to compare the effects of nutrient formulas differing in the amount of medium-chain triglycerides (MCT). METHODS: Thirty-six patients with active Crohn's disease whose Crohn's disease activity index (CDAI) was > or =150 were included in the study. A formula with 3.4 g of fat per 2000-kcal dose was used as the nutrient formula with a low-fat content (ED group), and a formula with 55.6 g of fat per 2000-kcal dose was used as the nutrient formula with a high amount of MCT (TL group). RESULTS: The rate of short-term remission induction at 6 weeks was 67% in the ED group and 72% in the TL group (p = NS). Therapy markedly reduced the high CDAI and van Hees activity index in both groups, with no significant difference in the pattern of the time-course changes. C-reactive protein levels, erythrocyte sedimentation rate, and low serum albumin and plasma prealbumin levels normalized over the course of therapy, with no significant difference between the 2 groups. The assessment of fatty acid fractions revealed that the triene/tetraene ratio began to increase at 2 weeks in the ED group. The serum levels of linoleic acid, an omega-6 fatty acid, almost always varied within the normal range during the treatment period in the TL group, but in the ED group, levels began to decrease significantly at 2 weeks. The levels of linolenic acid, an omega-3 fatty acid, decreased in both groups. CONCLUSIONS: Both nutrient formulas induced clinical remission in about two-thirds of patients. The results of the present study suggest that it is not necessary to restrict the amount of MCT when given in liquid form to patients with active Crohn's disease.},

Appendicitis has an incidence of about 5-10% of the number likely to be observed in a white population. The conundrum is that the disparity exists despite many Africans having adopted an urbanized lifestyle with major changes in their dietary pattern. Dietary fiber intake, which was previously 30-35 g, has decreased to 12-14 g daily. Studies on small bowel function in black people have shown that physiological malabsorption of lactose, fructose, sucrose and maize (the staple food) occurs. It is hypothesized that the increased concentration of substrate available for fermentation in the colon compensates for the low dietary fiber intake, is protective to the large bowel and is a factor in the prevention of 'developed society' large bowel diseases in the African population.},

   abstract = {BACKGROUND: Crohn disease (CD) and vitamin D deficiency are associated with decreased bone mineralization. OBJECTIVE: We examined the prevalence of and risk factors for hypovitaminosis D in children, adolescents, and young adults with CD. DESIGN: Growth, clinical characteristics, vitamin D intake ( micro g/d), and bone mineral density (g/cm(2)) were measured in a cross-sectional study of 112 subjects (44 females) who had CD and were 5-22 y of age. Hypovitaminosis D was defined as a serum concentration of 25-hydroxyvitamin D [25(OH)D] < 38 nmol/L. RESULTS: The mean (+/- SD) serum concentration of 25(OH)D was 59.7 +/- 26.9 nmol/L, and 16% (95% CI: 9.3%, 23%) of the subjects had hypovitaminosis D. Hypovitaminosis D was most prevalent during the winter (31%; P = 0.02), among the African Americans (56%; P = 0.01), in the subjects with CD confined to the upper gastrointestinal tract (44%; P = 0.05), and in the subjects with a greater lifetime exposure to glucocorticoid therapy (23.7 +/- 13.5 compared with 17.5 +/- 12.2 mg/d; P = 0.05). There was no association between hypovitaminosis D and either bone mineral density (P = 0.10) or average dietary intake of vitamin D (4.6 +/- 3.6 micro g/d; P = 0.87). CONCLUSIONS: In this sample of pediatric patients with CD, hypovitaminosis D was common and was associated with the winter season, African American ethnicity, CD confined to the upper gastrointestinal tract, and magnitude of lifetime exposure to glucocorticoid therapy. The occurrence of these factors should prompt assessment of 25(OH)D status and clinical care optimized by supplementing subjects who have low serum concentrations. The physiologic relevance of ethnicity on 25(OH)D status in children with CD remains to be determined.},

   abstract = {Probiotic therapy is attracting the renewed interest of clinicians and basic investigators from a variety of traditional research disciplines. While the theoretical rationale for modifying the commensal flora of the gastrointestinal tract in specific circumstances appears sound and requires scientific pursuit, the field of probiotics has been clouded by exaggerated claims from some quarters. In general, many of the claims for therapeutic efficacy have not been well substantiated, but the field is now poised for evaluation within the realm of evidence-based medicine. Alterations in commensal bacterial flora within the gastrointestinal tract are associated with susceptibility to pathogens such as Clostridium difficile and there is persuasive evidence that the normal flora may participate in the pathogenesis of inflammatory bowel disease and other chronic diseases in genetically susceptible individuals. This has prompted various strategies to fortify or otherwise modify the enteric flora by dietary supplements containing probiotic formulations. Detailed comparisons of probiotic performance amongst different bacterial strains have not been performed in vivo in man or under clinical trial conditions, and the level of scientific characterisation of individual organisms has been variable. In addition, it cannot be assumed that the same probiotic is equally suitable for all individuals. Moreover, the heterogeneity of clinical disorders such as Crohn's disease and ulcerative colitis implies that strain-specific properties may be required for subset-specific categories of patients. While cocktails of probiotics offer convenience, therapeutic progress may require clarification of the mechanism of probiotic action and may be delayed until individual bacterial components have been rigorously studied. More importantly, the full potential of therapeutic manipulation of the enteric flora with probiotics or other strategies may not be optimally realised until the composition and metabolic activities of the normal flora are better understood.},

   abstract = {Among the fatty acids, it is the omega-3 polyunsaturated fatty acids (PUFA) which possess the most potent immunomodulatory activities, and among the omega-3 PUFA, those from fish oil-eicosapentaenoic acid (EPA) and docosahexaenoic acid (DHA)--are more biologically potent than alpha-linolenic acid (ALA). Some of the effects of omega-3 PUFA are brought about by modulation of the amount and types of eicosanoids made, and other effects are elicited by eicosanoid-independent mechanisms, including actions upon intracellular signaling pathways, transcription factor activity and gene expression. Animal experiments and clinical intervention studies indicate that omega-3 fatty acids have anti-inflammatory properties and, therefore, might be useful in the management of inflammatory and autoimmune diseases. Coronary heart disease, major depression, aging and cancer are characterized by an increased level of interleukin 1 (IL-1), a proinflammatory cytokine. Similarly, arthritis, Crohn's disease, ulcerative colitis and lupus erythematosis are autoimmune diseases characterized by a high level of IL-1 and the proinflammatory leukotriene LTB(4) produced by omega-6 fatty acids. There have been a number of clinical trials assessing the benefits of dietary supplementation with fish oils in several inflammatory and autoimmune diseases in humans, including rheumatoid arthritis, Crohn's disease, ulcerative colitis, psoriasis, lupus erythematosus, multiple sclerosis and migraine headaches. Many of the placebo-controlled trials of fish oil in chronic inflammatory diseases reveal significant benefit, including decreased disease activity and a lowered use of anti-inflammatory drugs.},

   abstract = {OBJECTIVES: Small intestinal permeability is often increased in patients with Crohn's disease and may be pathogenic for clinical relapses. No effective prophylactic treatment is available for these patients. The aim of this study was to ascertain whether zinc supplementation may improve intestinal permeability. METHODS: We studied 12 patients with quiescent Crohn's disease who had been in remission for at least 3 months and had increased intestinal permeability on two separate occasions within the last 2 months. Patients received oral zinc sulfate supplements (110 mg three times a day) for 8 weeks and were followed-up for 12 months thereafter to monitor relapses. RESULTS: We found that the lactulose/mannitol ratio was significantly higher before supplementation than after (0.041 +/- 0.003 versus 0.026 +/- 0.005). During follow-up, 10 patients had normal intestinal permeability and did not relapse; of the remaining two who had increased intestinal permeability, one relapsed. CONCLUSIONS: Our findings show that zinc supplementation can resolve permeability alterations in patients with Crohn's disease in remission. Improving intestinal barrier function may contribute to reduce the risk of relapse in Crohn's disease.},

   abstract = {BACKGROUND: Laparoscopic bowel resection is an alternative to open surgery for patients with Crohn's disease requiring surgical resection. The present report describes a seven-year experience with the laparoscopic treatment of Crohn's disease compared with the open technique in a tertiary Canadian centre. PATIENTS AND METHODS: A retrospective analysis of 61 consecutive patients undergoing elective resection for Crohn's disease was carried out between October 1992 and June 1999. This analysis included 32 laparoscopic resections (mean age 33 years) and 29 open resections (mean age 42 years). Patient demographics were compared, as well as short and long term outcomes after surgery (mean follow-up 39 months). RESULTS: Patients in the laparoscopic group were younger and had fewer previous bowel surgeries than patients who had open resections. Indications for surgery and operative times were similar between the groups. Patients who underwent laparoscopic resections required fewer doses of narcotic analgesics. The resumption of bowel function after surgery, and tolerance of a clear liquid and solid diet was quicker in the laparoscopic group. Patients who underwent laparoscopic resections had significantly shorter hospital stays than those who underwent open resections. Fifteen patients (48.4%) in the laparoscopic group experienced recurrence of disease compared with 13 patients (44.8%) in the open group. In both groups, the most common site of recurrence was at the anastomosis. The disease-free interval was the same length for both groups (23.9+/-17.3 months for the laparoscopic resection patients compared with 23.9+/-20.2 months for the open resection patients; P=1.00). CONCLUSIONS: Laparoscopic resection for Crohn's disease can be performed safely and effectively. Quicker resumption of oral feeds, less postoperative pain and earlier discharge from hospital are advantages of the laparoscopic method. No differences in the recurrence rate or the disease-free interval were noted.},

At the age of 13 years, the patient developed Crohn disease and IgA nephropathy recurred. Significant increases in serum IgA were associated with progression of Crohn disease. An elemental diet combined with oral prednisolone resulted in clinical improvement of Crohn disease and in remission of nephropathy and normalization of serum IgA concentration. The clinical course of the two diseases was linked, suggesting a common pathogenetic mechanism involving an IgA immune response to mucosal challenge in the intestine.},

Celiac sprue is characterized by an intolerance to the wheat protein gluten. The typical neurological manifestation of celiac sprue is cerebellar ataxia. The ataxia as well as the gastrointestinal symptoms can be treated with a strictly gluten-free diet. The neurological symptoms of Whipple's disease, a disorder caused by gram-positive bacilli, are variable. Typical symptoms of cerebral Whipple's disease include dementia, ophthalmoplegia, movement disorders, and signs of hypothalamic dysfunction. Nowadays, the diagnosis of cerebral Whipple's disease is made by PCR detection of the bacilli in the CSF. Crohn's disease and ulcerative colitis are associated with neurological symptoms to a similar proportion. Various forms of polyneuropathies have been observed. The CNS manifestations of inflammatory bowel diseases include thromboembolic stroke, cerebral venous thrombosis, and cerebral vasculitis.},

   abstract = {BACKGROUND: Although enteral nutrition (EN) therapy for Crohn's disease has been confirmed to be as effective as steroid therapy, the precise mechanism responsible for the effects of EN remains unclear, although some of the therapeutic effects of EN are believed to be due to a low dietary fat content. In order to elucidate the influence of fat in EN, it is important to investigate not only the quantity of fat, but also the source of the fat. METHODS: We compared two enteral nutritional formulae: Elental (Ajinomoto) (elemental diet; ED), which contains only 1.5% fat, provided as long-chain triglycerides (LCT), versus Twinline (Snow Brand Milk Products) (TL), which contains a high percentage of fat (20.4%), provided mainly as medium-chain triglycerides (MCT). These formulae were tested on rat enteritis and rat colitis induced by trinitrobenzene sulfonic acid (TNBS). RESULTS: Both ED and TL reduced the manifestations of enteritis. TL had a stronger anti-inflammatory effect than ED for colitis. TL also had nutritional advantages as compared with ED, as shown by the total serum protein in the TL group being significantly higher than that in the ED group. CONCLUSION: The results indicate that intraluminal MCT is suitable as a fat energy source during intestinal inflammation in rats. We suggest that Twinline may be more useful to improve nutritional status and to reduce the mucosal inflammation in rat colitis, but that Twinline is equal in effect to Elental for rat enteritis.},

Crohn's disease (CD) patients, especially in the active phase of disease, show a reduced body weight, due to the reduction of lipid stores, in spite of lean mass depletion. Fat mass reduction has been correlated to an increased utilization of lipids as fuel substrate. The alterations of nutritional status are able, in turn, to influence, as independent factors, the disease course and patient prognosis. A disease's treatment based only on pharmacologic therapy, especially on corticosteroid use in the active phases, often does not take into account the relevant need for preserving a normal nutritional status. In this connection, enteral nutrition has been shown to be able to improve nutritional status and induce and maintain remission. We present some of the possible mechanisms of efficacy of enteral feeding and some rules to attempt to treat patients with IBD, especially those with Crohn's disease.},

   abstract = {Thrombophilia in inflammatory bowel disease may be due to several risk factors, such as a dysbalanced haemostasis with a hypercoagulative state, thrombocytosis, hyperfibrinogenaemia and hyperhomocysteinaemia. In addition, increased concentrations of lipoprotein (a), a modified form of low-density lipoprotein particles, have been associated with a higher risk of thrombotic vascular disease, probably due to inhibition of (local and endothelial) fibrinolysis. The mechanisms regulating the plasma concentration of lipoprotein (a) have not yet been elucidated completely, but genetic factors are involved. Dietary factors seem to play a minor role. In this issue of the journal, Koutroubakis et al. report that lipoprotein (a) concentration is elevated in patients with Crohn's disease, but not in patients with ulcerative colitis. Several other (apo)lipoproteins have a different pattern in patients with inflammatory bowel disease than in a control population of healthy subjects from Crete. These findings add up to the multifactorial nature of thrombophilia in inflammatory bowel disease patients, especially in patients with Crohn's disease, and give rise to speculations about the clinical significance of the observed different lipoprotein metabolism in patients with inflammatory bowel disease.},

   abstract = {BACKGROUND: Nutritional therapy plays an important role in the management of Crohn disease, particularly during the acute phase. Nutritional supplementation may also prevent relapses during the quiescent phase of Crohn disease, though this aspect has not been widely explored. METHODS: Thirty-three patients with Crohn disease in remission were studied. All had steroid-dependent disease. Patients were randomized to receive either elemental diet (n = 19, EO28 Extra) or polymeric diet (Forticips, n = 14). The supplement was given orally in addition to normal food in an amount to provide 35%-50% of pre-trial total calorie intake. Prednisolone was withdrawn gradually. Patients were followed up for 12 months. Failure was defined as increase in CDAI by 100 points from baseline to >200, inability to withdraw chronic steroid therapy completely, need for surgery or steroid therapy. RESULTS: The nutritional supplement was successful in 14 (43%) patients who remained in remission for 12 months with complete withdrawal of steroids. The response to elemental diet (42%) was similar to that of polymeric diet (43%). Nutrition supplement failed in 13 (39%). Six (18%) patients were intolerant to enteral feeding because of smell and taste problems. Per-protocol analysis of data indicated that the success rate of nutrition supplement in steroid-dependent patients was 52% (14 out of 27 patients). No disease or patient-related factors helped predict the response to nutrition supplement. CONCLUSION: Nutritional supplementation with either an elemental or polymeric diet may provide a safe and effective alternative to chronic steroid therapy in patients with steroid-dependent Crohn disease.},

   abstract = {Kidney stones are increased in patients with bowel disease, particularly those who have had resection of part of their gastrointestinal tract. These stones are usually CaOx, but there is a marked increase in the tendency to form uric acid stones, as well, particularly in patients with colon resection. These patients all share a tendency to chronic volume contraction due to loss of water and salt in diarrheal stool, which leads to decreased urine volumes. They also have decreased absorption, and therefore diminished urinary excretion, of citrate and magnesium, which normally act as inhibitors of CaOx crystallization. Patients with colon resection and ileostomy form uric acid stones, as loss of bicarbonate in the ileostomy effluent leads to formation of an acid urine. This, coupled with low urine volume, decreases the solubility of uric acid, causing crystallization and stone formation. Prevention of stones requires treatment with alkalinizing agents to raise urine pH to about 6.5, and attempts to increase urine volume, which increases the solubility of uric acid and prevents crystallization. Patients with small bowel resection may develop steatorrhea; if the colon is present, they are at risk of hyperoxaluria due to increased permeability of the colon to oxalate in the presence of fatty acids, and increased concentrations of free oxalate in the bowel lumen due to fatty acid binding of luminal calcium. EH leads to supersaturation of urine with respect to CaOx, in conjunction with low volume, hypocitraturia and hypomagnesuria. Therapy involves a low-fat, low-oxalate diet, attempts to increase urine volume, and agents such as calcium given to bind oxalate in the gut lumen. Correction of hypocitraturia and hypomagnesuria are also helpful.},

   abstract = {BACKGROUND: Laparoscopic colorectal procedures are considered to be technically challenging, and there is a lack of consensus regarding the magnitude of their benefits. The laparoscopic approach is generally held to be more expensive. Using a model of a single procedure performed for a single indication (ileocolic resection for Crohn's disease [CD]), we set out to demonstrate the feasibility of this procedure by determining the conversion rate, documenting the patient benefits, and performing a formal cost analysis. METHODS: Consecutive cases of laparoscopic ileocolic resection for CD were identified (LAP). Case-match methodology identified a series of open laparotomy controls (OPEN) that were matched for five potential confounding criteria: age, gender, diagnosis, type of resection, and date of operation. Pre-, intra-, and postoperative details were gathered. Medical resource utilization was tracked using a standardized database, and all costs were reported in 1999 dollars. RESULTS: The conversion rate was 5.9%. Resolution of ileus occurred more rapidly in the LAP than in the OPEN group. The time to clears in the LAP group was a median of 0 days (range, 0-4) vs 3.0 days (range, 2-8) in the OPEN group (p = 0.0001). Time to regular diet was 2.0 days (range, 1-6) in the LAP group vs 5.0 days (range, 3-12) in the OPEN group (p = 0.0001). Length of hospital stay was significantly reduced in the LAP group (4.0 days [range, 2-8], vs 7.0 days [range, 3-14], p = 0.0001). The LAP group had significantly lower direct costs ($8684 vs $11,373) and indirect costs ($1358 vs $2349) than the OPEN group (p < 0.001). This resulted in total costs of $9895 for LAP vs $13,268 for OPEN (p < 0.001). CONCLUSION: Laparoscopic ileocolic resection for CD is feasible. There are significant postoperative benefits in terms of resolution of ileus, narcotic use, and hospital stay. This approach translates into cost savings of >$3300 for laparoscopic patients.},

   abstract = {BACKGROUND: The role of enteral nutrition in Crohn's disease is controversial. Increasing research on the mechanisms by which nutritional therapy improves the clinical well being of patients with Crohn's disease has led to novel formula design and trials comparing two different forms of enteral nutrition. This systematic review aims to provide an update on the existing efficacy data for both corticosteroids versus enteral nutrition and for one form of enteral nutrition versus another for inducing remission of active Crohn's disease. OBJECTIVES: To evaluate the efficacy of exclusive enteral nutrition as primary therapy to induce remission in Crohn's disease and to examine the importance of formula composition on efficacy. SEARCH STRATEGY: Studies were selected using a computer-assisted search of the on-line bibliographic databases MEDLINE (1966-2000) and EMBASE (1984-2000), as well as the Science Citation Index on Web of Science. Additional citations were sought by manual search of references of articles retrieved from the computerized search, abstracts submitted to major gastroenterologic meetings and published in the journals: Gut, Gastroenterology, Journal of Pediatric Gastroenterology and Nutrition, and Journal of Parenteral and Enteral Nutrition, and from the reviewers' personal files or contact with leaders in the field. SELECTION CRITERIA: All randomized and quasi-randomized controlled trials involving patients with active Crohn's disease defined by a clinical disease activity index were considered for review. Studies evaluating the administration of one type of enteral nutrition to one group of patients and another type of enteral nutrition or conventional corticosteroids to the other group were selected for review. DATA COLLECTION AND ANALYSIS: Data were extracted independently by two reviewers and any discrepancies were resolved by rereading and discussion. For the dichotomous variable, achievement of remission, individual and pooled trial statistics were calculated as odds ratios (OR) with 95% confidence intervals (CI); both fixed and random effect models were used. The results for each analysis were tested for heterogeneity using the chi square statistic. The studies were separated into two groups: A. one form of enteral nutrition compared with another form of enteral nutrition and B. one form of enteral nutrition compared with corticosteroids. Subgroup analyses were conducted on the basis of clinical or disease criteria and formula composition. Sensitivity analyses were conducted on the basis of the inclusion of abstracts of studies not yet fully published, methodologic quality and by random or fixed effects models. MAIN RESULTS: In part A, of the 11 trials (one abstract) comparing different formulations of enteral nutrition ten compared one [or more (Middleton (a)1995)] elemental formulas to a non-elemental diet. The eleventh study (Akobeng 2000) compared two non-elemental diets differing only by glutamine enrichment in one group. This study was therefore not included in the primary analysis but was part of the subgroup analyses. Meta-analysis of nine studies which included 170 patients treated with an elemental diet and 128 patients treated with a non-elemental diet for active Crohn's disease demonstrated no significant difference among diet formulations [OR 1.15 (95% CI: 0.64, 2.08)]. Significant heterogeneity was not present [chi-square 9.77 (df=8)]. Subgroup and sensitivity analyses had no significant effect on the results. In part B, six trials (two abstracts) comparing enteral nutrition to steroid therapy met the inclusion criteria for review. Meta-analysis of four trials that included 130 patients treated with enteral nutrition and 123 treated with steroids yielded a pooled OR of 0.30 favouring steroid therapy (95% CI: 0.17, 0.52). Heterogeneity was not demonstrated [chi-square 0.43 (df=3)]. The risk difference calculated from this meta-analysis was 0.26, and the NNT (number of patients needed to treat with steroids rather than enteral nutrition to achieve one remission) was four. The same result was found in a sensitivity analysis that included abstracts. The inclusion of abstracts resulted in an increase in the number of participants to 150 in the enteral nutrition group and 142 in the steroid group but the meta-analysis yielded a similar result [OR 0.34 (95% CI: 0.20, 0.56)]. There were inadequate data from full publications to perform further subgroup analyses by age, disease duration and disease location. REVIEWER'S CONCLUSIONS: Corticosteroid therapy is more effective than enteral nutrition for inducing remission of active Crohn's disease as was found in past meta-analyses. There is no significant difference in the efficacy of elemental and non-elemental diets for induction of remission of Crohn's disease.},
