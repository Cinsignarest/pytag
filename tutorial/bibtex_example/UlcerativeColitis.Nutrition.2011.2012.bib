   abstract = {The diet of industrialized nations may contribute to the pathogenesis of both ulcerative colitis (UC) and Crohn disease (CD). Malnutrition is relatively unusual in UC, but in CD, which often affects the small intestine, it is frequent and may be severe. Nutrition support is therefore frequently indicated. First principles of artificial nutrition can be applied effectively using the gut whenever possible. Parenteral nutrition is generally required only in those with short bowel syndrome. An increasing literature (especially in pediatrics) favors the use of defined exclusive enteral nutrition (EN) in the primary treatment of active CD. Controlled trials are, however, lacking, and recommendations are accordingly not of the highest rank. It appears that in this context, simple polymeric regimens are usually sufficient, and there is currently insufficient evidence to make a strong recommendation for disease-specific feeds. In the maintenance of remission in CD, controlled data demonstrate that defined EN reduces the risk of relapse requiring steroid treatment. There are no data in support of primary nutrition therapy in UC either in management of the acute flare or in maintenance. In conclusion, nutrition therapy in adults with inflammatory bowel disease is probably both undervalued and underused, but the evidence base needs to be strengthened to confirm its efficacy, determine better those patients most likely to benefit, and optimize the regimens to be employed.},

   abstract = {OBJECTIVES: The aim of the study was to estimate the frequency of primary sclerosing cholangitis (PSC)-type lesions in children with inflammatory bowel disease (IBD) by means of magnetic resonance cholangiopancreatography (MRCP), and to investigate the association between a series of easily applicable data on the one hand and the presentation of such lesions at MRCP on the other hand. METHODS: Collected demographic, laboratory, and magnetic resonance enterography data from the records of 73 children with IBD were cross-sectionally related to the MRCP-based diagnosis. RESULTS: Around the time of MRCP, the distribution of IBD subtypes was 64.4%, 24.7%, and 11% for Crohn disease, indeterminate colitis, and ulcerative colitis, respectively. A total of 11 patients (15.1%) were identified with PSC-type lesions. Demographic and magnetic resonance enterography data were unrelated to the MRCP outcome. Biochemical abnormalities were of low prevalence (<50%) among patients with PSC. The abnormality prevalences of aspartate transaminase, alanine transaminase, and gamma-glutamyl transferase were significantly higher in the PSC group, both at initial diagnosis of IBD and at the time of MRCP. Less-consistent results were documented for bilirubin and alkaline phosphatase, especially at initial diagnosis of IBD. CONCLUSIONS: The abnormality prevalences of aspartate transaminase, alanine transaminase, and gamma-glutamyl transferase were significantly higher in the PSC group. Nevertheless, PSC-type lesions frequently occur in pediatric IBD, even if the biochemical profile is hardly indicative of this probability.},

   abstract = {INTRODUCTION: Serious infections are an important side effect of immunosuppressive therapy used to treat Crohn's disease (CD) and ulcerative colitis (UC). There have been no nationally representative studies examining the spectrum of infection related hospitalizations in patients with IBD. METHODS: Our study consisted of all adult CD and UC related hospitalizations from the Nationwide Inpatient Sample 2007, a national hospitalization database in the United States. We then identified all infection-related hospitalizations through codes for either the specific infections or disease processes (sepsis, pneumonia, etc.). Predictors of infections as well as the excess morbidity associated with infections were determined using multivariate regression models. RESULTS: There were an estimated 67,221 hospitalizations related to infections in IBD patients, comprising 27.5% of all IBD hospitalizations. On multivariate analysis, infections were independently associated with age, co-morbidity, malnutrition, TPN, and bowel surgery. Infection-related hospitalizations had a four-fold greater mortality (OR 4.4, 95% CI 3.7-5.2). However, this varied by type of infection with the strongest effect seen for sepsis (OR 15.3, 95% CI 12.4-18.6), pneumonia (OR 3.6, 95% CI 2.9-4.5) and C. difficile (OR 3.2, 95% CI 2.6-4.0), and weaker effects for urinary infections (OR 1.4, 95%CI 1.1-1.7). Infections were also associated with an estimated 2.3 days excess hospital stay (95% CI 2.2-2.5) and $12,482 in hospitalization charges. CONCLUSION: Infections account for significant morbidity and mortality in patients with IBD and disproportionately impact older IBD patients with greater co-morbidity. Pneumonia, sepsis and C difficile infection are associated with the greatest excess mortality risk.},

   abstract = {OBJECTIVES: Varicella zoster is a childhood disease that can cause devastating illness and death in immunocompromised individuals, including those who are taking steroids. Inflammatory bowel disease (IBD) is managed by decreasing or controlling the inflammation using immunosuppression. Our objective was to show that at least 90% of patients newly diagnosed as having IBD had antibodies against varicella zoster and were protected by vaccination or natural disease. MATERIALS AND METHODS: Retrospective review of all of the charts of the patients diagnosed with IBD at the University of Buffalo's Digestive Diseases and Nutrition Center for 5 years from January 1, 2005 to December 31, 2009. RESULTS: There were 163 new diagnoses of IBD during this time; 57% were boys. Mean age was 12 years (range 1-19 years); 62% had Crohn disease, 33% ulcerative colitis, and 5% indeterminate colitis. A total of 66% of all of the patients had a history of disease or vaccination. Measurable titers against varicella were found in only 77% of all of the patients. CONCLUSIONS: Lack of varicella immunity is common in children and adolescents at the time of diagnosis of IBD. Routine screening for varicella immune status may be warranted. Offering immunization to susceptible patients should confer protection, but this may be difficult to achieve once immune suppression has begun.},

   abstract = {BACKGROUND: Anti tumor necrosis factor alpha (TNFalpha) agents have become widely used in pediatric inflammatory bowel disease (IBD). So far, only few studies examined the long-term results of anti-TNFalpha treatment in children with IBD. METHODS: The long-term outcome of pediatric patients with IBD was assessed retrospectively in a multicenter cohort of children treated with anti-TNFalpha beyond induction treatment. Short- and long-term response rates, predictors for loss of response, data on growth and laboratory parameters were assessed. RESULTS: 120 patients [101 crohn's disease (CD), 19 ulcerative colitis (UC) or indeterminate colitis (IC)] received either infliximab or adalimumab. The mean age at initiation of anti-TNFalpha was 13.4 +/- 3.9 years and the median duration of anti-TNFalpha treatment was 15 months (range: 2-90). Overall, 89% of the cohort experienced short-term response following induction. Response was associated with improvement in weight and BMI Z-scores (p<0.001) but not with linear growth. Responders experienced a significant decrease in erythrocyte sedimentation rate (ESR) and C reactive protein (CRP) during treatment (p<0.001). Albumin and hemoglobin both improved but only albumin increased significantly (p<0.001). The cumulative probability of losing response to anti-TNFalpha treatment was 17%, 38%, and 49% after 1, 3, and 5 years, respectively. Responders had a significantly lower weight and BMI Z-scores at initiation of anti-TNFalpha treatment in compared to non-responders (p=0.04 and 0.02 respectively). CONCLUSIONS: Our long term cohort supports the current evidence on the effectiveness and safety of anti-TNFalpha treatment in children with IBD. Response to treatment was interestingly associated with lower weight and BMI.},

   abstract = {OBJECTIVE: The incidence of inflammatory bowel disease (IBD) in Europe has increased significantly. At least a fourth of patients are children. Mannan-binding lectin (MBL) is believed to be an important component of innate immunity, acting as an opsonin and activator of the lectin pathway (LP) of complement. The data relating any of the LP factors to IBD are sparse and contradictory and were obtained mainly from adult patients. The aim of this study was to investigate the possible role of MBL in Crohn's disease (CD) and ulcerative colitis (UC) in children. METHODS: MBL2 gene single nucleotide polymorphisms (PCR-RFLP) and MBL concentrations (ELISA) were determined. RESULTS: The frequency of MBL2 gene variants responsible for MBL deficiency (LXPA/O and O/O) is significantly higher in CD patients compared with controls or children with UC. A relatively high frequency of the codon 52 mutation (D allele) was noted in these patients. Practically no difference was found between UC and control (C) groups. Similarly, the average MBL levels as well as the number of MBL-deficient (MBL concentrations < 150 ng/ml) individuals differed between CD patients and controls or children suffering from UC. Again, there was no difference between UC and C groups. CONCLUSIONS: These data suggest that MBL deficiency may be associated with CD but not with UC in pediatric patients. The possible role of MBL in IBD requires confirmation in larger series and further investigation of the mechanisms involved.},

The aim of the present study was to investigate the prevalence and risk factors of CDI in newly diagnosed pediatric patients with IBD. METHODS: The current investigation was a retrospective study. All patients newly diagnosed with IBD in the pediatric gastroenterology clinic in Warsaw between 2007 and 2010 were included in the present study. The patients were diagnosed according to Porto criteria and microbiology evaluation screening tests for CDI were conducted. Risk factors including prior hospitalization, use of antibiotics within 2 months of CDI detection, colonic involvement, and the duration of symptoms were evaluated. CDI diagnosis was based on a positive stool enzyme immunoassay. RESULTS: In the present study, 134 patients were evaluated (54 patients with Crohn's disease, and 80 with ulcerative colitis; 87% of the patients had colonic disease). The average age of the patients was 12.3 years, and the prevalence of CDI was 47% (95% confidence interval [CI], 38%-56%). Significant differences in the prevalence of CDI between patients with Crohn's disease and ulcerative colitis (P = 0.72; odds ratio [OR] = 1.187, 95% CI, 0.56-2.52) were not observed. The risk of CDI was associated with an increase in the age of the patient and the severity of the disease. CONCLUSIONS: The prevalence of CDI in newly diagnosed IBD patients was high and was independent of the type of disease.},

   abstract = {Although numerous studies have assessed the effect of foods and nutrients on colorectal carcinogenesis, few studies have investigated human eating behavior in relation to risk of colorectal cancer. In our study, we assessed whether the reported behavior of eating anything at anytime influenced colorectal cancer risk and related plasma biomarkers. We prospectively followed up 55,540 women in the Nurses' Health Study who were aged 48-73 years, had no history of cancer, ulcerative colitis or diabetes and responded to the item "I eat anything I want, anytime I want" in the 1994 questionnaire. We also analyzed blood samples for 1,994 women, which were collected in 1989-1990. During 12 years of follow-up, 552 colorectal cancer cases were documented. After adjusting for age, smoking, body mass index, physical activity, red and processed meat and other known risk factors for colorectal cancer, women who reported eating anything at anytime experienced an increased risk of colorectal cancer (relative risk = 1.28, 95% confidence interval = 1.06-1.56) compared to those who did not report this behavior. In addition, reporting eating anything at anytime was associated with higher fasting plasma levels of insulin (p = 0.04) and C-peptide (p = 0.05). In conclusion, reports of eating anything at anytime are associated with an increased risk of colorectal cancer in this large prospective cohort study, independent of other potential risk factors for colorectal cancer.},

   abstract = {Surgery for chronic inflammatory bowel disease (IBD) is increasingly often necessary in children. This study aimed at assessing the results of these operations in order to facilitate adequate preoperative counseling. We reviewed patients treated from 1992 to 2009. The operations, complications and functional outcome were recorded. For those with preserved rectal defecation, continence (Koivusalo score) and quality of life (standardized questionnaire) were assessed in the long term. Eighty five of 192 patients had Crohn disease (CD), 107 of 192 had ulcerative colitis (UC), and 3 of 192 had indeterminate colitis (IC). 12 of 85 CD patients (15%) aged 14 (12-19) years required 13 resections, 1 stricturoplasty, 1 transplantation and 6 other operations including 3 permanent enterostomies for anorectal involvement. Removal of the involved bowel led to significant improvement of nutritional status, growth and quality of life. The transplanted patient had a striking recovery but eventually died 1 year later of unrelated complications. 29 of 107 UC patients (26%) aged 11 (2-15) years required 87 operations. Nine had emergency colectomy for toxic megacolon (3, one death) or severe hemorrhage (6). 28 had restorative proctocolectomy and ileoanostomy (RPCIA) without (16) or with (12) J-pouch under protective ileostomy. Complications were frequent (40%). Permanent ileostomy was required in five children (17%). Twelve months postoperatively, RPCIA patients had 6.5 (2-13) stools/day; all were continent during daytime, and 25% have nocturnal leaks. Mean Koivusalo score (5-12) was 8.8 +/- 2. Quality of life was good in all. All attended normal school and 7 the university, 4 work and 60% of those older than 18 years have sexual partners. Three of 107 children treated as UC with RPCIA had ultimately IC (3%) and were permanently diverted. The nature of IBD involves frustrating surgery. However, it may change life for CD patients and provide a reasonably good quality of life for UC after the first year. Pediatric surgeons should be able to provide adequate preoperative counseling to patients and families.},

   abstract = {BACKGROUND AND AIMS: Eosinophils are implicated in the pathogenesis of inflammatory bowel disease (IBD). A subset of IBD patients develops blood eosinophilia, and the clinical profile of these patients is undefined. We sought to characterize IBD patients with and without eosinophilia. METHODS: We studied a prospective registry of 1,176 IBD patients followed in a tertiary referral center. Patients who developed eosinophilia at any time were identified by electronic medical record query. We performed a chart review case-control study comparing patients with recurrent eosinophilia versus randomly selected disease-matched patients with no history of eosinophilia. Histological analysis was performed on selected cases and controls. RESULTS: Eosinophilia at any time was more prevalent in ulcerative colitis (UC) patients than Crohn's disease patients (22.2 versus 12.7%), as was recurrent eosinophilia (3.4 versus 0.7%). UC patients with recurrent eosinophilia were predominantly male compared with the control UC population (81.3 versus 46.9%) and had higher rates of colectomy for either medically refractory disease or dysplasia/cancer than control UC patients (56.3 versus 15.6%). Primary sclerosing cholangitis (PSC) occurred in 37.5% of UC patients with recurrent eosinophilia compared with only 3.1% in the UC controls. Histological analysis of random diagnostic samples from UC patients with recurrent eosinophilia demonstrated a normal eosinophil pattern as seen in the control UC population. CONCLUSIONS: Eosinophilia-associated UC is a subgroup of IBD associated with severe colitis and PSC. Further studies are warranted to characterize molecular mechanisms underlying eosinophilia-associated UC and to determine optimal approaches for therapy.},

   abstract = {BACKGROUND AND AIMS: The elderly represent a growing demographic of patients with IBD. No study has previously described variations in care or medication prescriptions in senior patients with IBD. We compared prescription rates among elderly patients with IBD in four countries using health administrative data. METHODS: Databases from the United States (US), United Kingdom (UK), Denmark and Canada were queried. Variation in prescription rates between countries was assessed in patients >/=65y with prevalent IBD who had >/=1 prescription for an IBD-related medication in a given quarter between 2004 and 2009. Patients were identified using previously-reported, validated algorithms. Country-specific rates were compared in each quarter using Fisher's exact test. RESULTS: In patients with Crohn's disease, Canada and US had higher prescription rates for oral 5-ASA (P<0.0001 in all quarters) and infliximab (P<0.05 in 22/24 quarters), while the US had higher rates of thiopurine usage (P<0.05 in 23/24 quarters). Canada had greater rates of methotrexate prescriptions (P<0.05 in 21/24 quarters analyzed). In patients with ulcerative colitis (UC), rates of oral steroid usage was lowest in the US (P<0.05 in 22/24 quarters) and oral 5-ASA use was highest in the US and Canada (P<0.0001 in all quarters). Canada and Denmark used more rectal therapy than the US. Infliximab usage in UC was significantly higher in the US and Canada after 2006. CONCLUSIONS: Significant variation in medication prescription rates exists among countries. Future research should assess whether these differences were associated with disparities in outcomes and health care costs.},

The authors evaluated whether partial replacement of soybean oil by medium-chain triglycerides (MCTs) or olive oil influenced the incidence and severity of experimental ulcerative colitis by using different parenteral lipid emulsions (LEs). METHODS: Wistar rats (n = 40) were randomized to receive parenteral infusion of the following LE: 100% soybean oil (SO), 50% MCT mixed with 50% soybean oil (MCT/SO), 80% olive oil mixed with 20% soybean oil (OO/SO), or saline (CC). After 72 hours of infusion, acetic acid experimental colitis was induced. After 24 hours, colon histology and cytokine expression were analyzed. RESULTS: SO was not significantly associated with overall tissue damage. MCT/SO was not associated with necrosis (P < .005), whereas OO/SO had higher frequencies of ulcer and necrosis (P < .005). SO was associated with increased expression of interferon-gamma (P = .005) and OO/SO with increased interleukin (IL)-6 and decreased tumor necrosis factor-alpha expression (P < .05). MCT/SO appeared to decrease IL-1 (P < .05) and increase IL-4 (P < .001) expression. CONCLUSIONS: Parenteral SO with high concentration of omega-6 fatty acids was not associated with greater tissue damage in experimental colitis. SO partial replacement with MCT/SO decreased the frequency of histological necrosis and favorably modulated cytokine expression in the colon; however, replacement with OO/SO had unfavorable effects.},

   abstract = {BACKGROUND: Current surveillance guidelines for patients with long-standing ulcerative colitis (UC) recommend repeated colonoscopy with random biopsies, which is time-consuming, discomforting, and expensive. A less invasive strategy is to identify neoplasia by analyzing biomarkers from the more accessible rectum to predict the need for a full colonoscopy. The goal of this pilot study was to evaluate whether optical markers of rectal mucosa derived from a novel optical technique, partial-wave spectroscopic microscopy (PWS), could identify UC patients with high-grade dysplasia (HGD) or cancer (CA) present anywhere in their colon. METHODS: Banked frozen nondysplastic mucosal rectal biopsies were used from 28 UC patients (15 without dysplasia and 13 with concurrent HGD or CA). The specimen slides were made using a touch prep method and underwent PWS analysis. We divided the patients into two groups: 13 as a training set and an independent 15 as a validation set. RESULTS: We identified six optical markers, ranked by measuring the information gain with respect to the outcome of cancer. The most effective markers were selected by maximizing the cross-validated training accuracy of a Naive Bayes classifier. The optimal classifier was applied to the validation data yielding 100% sensitivity and 75% specificity. CONCLUSIONS: Our results indicate that the PWS-derived optical markers can accurately predict UC patients with HGD/CA through assessment of rectal epithelial cells. By aiming for high sensitivity, our approach could potentially simplify the surveillance of UC patients and improve overall resource utilization by identifying patients with HGD/CA who should proceed with colonoscopy.},

   abstract = {OBJECTIVES: Increasing numbers of paediatric and adolescent patients with Crohn disease (CD) and ulcerative colitis (UC) are reported. To determine whether this observation is a consequence of a shift towards onset at a younger age, we analysed retrospective data from patients enrolled in the Swiss IBD Cohort Study (SIBDCS). PATIENTS AND METHODS: The SIBDCS is a disease-based cohort in Switzerland, which collects retrospective and prospective data on a large sample of patients with inflammatory bowel disease (IBD). Patients, diagnosed from 1980, were stratified according to diagnosis of CD and UC. Age at disease onset (age at first symptoms and age at diagnosis) was analysed in relation to calendar year of disease onset. Data were extracted from physician and patient questionnaires. Linear regressions of age at disease onset by calendar year of disease onset adjusted by sex, country of birth, and education were performed. RESULTS: Adjusted regression coefficients for CD and UC were significantly positive, that is, age at disease onset has increased with time. Male sex was associated with an increase in age at disease onset, and birth in Switzerland with a decrease. These associations were statistically significant. CONCLUSIONS: The results from the SIBDCS do not support the hypothesis that disease onset of both CD and UC occur today at a younger age. On the contrary, our results show that there is a significant trend for age at disease onset occurring at an older age today as compared with recent decades. We conclude that the observation of increasing numbers of paediatric and adolescent patients with IBD is not caused by a trend towards disease onset at a younger age, but that this may rather be a consequence of the overall increasing incidence of these conditions.},

   abstract = {Several substances, including glutamine and propionic acid but in particular butyric acid, have been proposed to be important for colonic health. beta-Glucans lead to the formation of comparatively high amounts of butyric acid, and germinated barley foodstuff obtained from brewer's spent grain (BSG), containing high amounts of beta-glucans and glutamine, has been reported to reduce the inflammatory response in the colon of patients with ulcerative colitis. The present study examines how 3 barley products, whole grain barley, malt, and BSG, affect SCFA in the hindgut and serum of rats and whether the addition of Lactobacillus rhamnosus 271 to each of these diets would have further effects. Amino acids in plasma and the cecal composition of the microbiota were also analyzed. The butyric acid concentration in the distal colon and serum was higher in the malt groups than in the other groups as was the serum concentration of propionic acid. The concentrations of propionic and butyric acids were higher in the cecum and serum of rats given L. rhamnosus than in those not given this strain. The proportion of plasma glutamine and the cecal number of bifidobacteria were lower in the malt groups than in the other groups. L. rhamnosus decreased the number of cecal bifidobacteria, whereas plasma glutamine was unaffected. We conclude that malt together with L. rhamnosus 271 had greater effects on propionic and butyric acid concentrations in rats than the other barley products. This is interesting when developing food with effects on colonic health.},

   abstract = {BACKGROUND AND OBJECTIVES: Acute pancreatitis (AP) can be a rare extraintestinal manifestation of inflammatory bowel disease (IBD). There are only a few reports of AP presenting before the diagnosis of IBD. We aimed to characterize the demographic, clinical, and laboratory data of patients with IBD in whom AP preceded disease onset and compare the presentation of AP between children and adults. PATIENTS AND METHODS: Pediatric and adult patients presenting with AP as the first symptom of IBD were retrospectively identified (10 years, 7 university hospitals). Demographic and clinical data, IBD type, disease extension, and laboratory data were extracted from the charts. Imaging methods, number of AP episodes, and lag time between onset of first pancreatitis episode and onset of IBD were recorded. RESULTS: AP preceding the diagnosis of IBD was found in 10 in 460 pediatric patients with IBD (2.17%), compared with only 2 in 3500 adults (0.06%). Eight children had colonic disease (4 Crohn disease, 4 ulcerative colitis [3 pancolitis]). Mean amylase level was 1419 and range 100 to 1370. Three children (30%) had mildly elevated transaminases. Median time between onset of first episode of AP in relation to onset of IBD was 24 (range 1-156) weeks. AP most commonly presented with abdominal pain. CONCLUSIONS: IBD presenting as AP was more frequent among the pediatric population with IBD in comparison to adults. It was more common in patients with colitis than in those with ileal disease, suggesting that patients with idiopathic AP should be observed carefully for a possible diagnosis of IBD.},

The dietary suggestions derived from sources found in this article include nutritional deficiency screening, avoiding foods that worsen symptoms, eating smaller meals at more frequent intervals, drinking adequate fluids, avoiding caffeine and alcohol, taking vitamin/mineral supplementation, eliminating dairy if lactose intolerant, limiting excess fat, reducing carbohydrates and reducing high-fiber foods during flares. Mixed advice exists regarding probiotics. Enteral nutrition is recommended for Crohn's disease patients in Japan, which differs from practices in the USA.},

   abstract = {The gastrointestinal (GI) microbiota is the collection of microbes which reside in the GI tract and represents the largest source of non-self antigens in the human body. The GI tract functions as a major immunological organ as it must maintain tolerance to commensal and dietary antigens while remaining responsive to pathogenic stimuli. If this balance is disrupted, inappropriate inflammatory processes can result, leading to host cell damage and/or autoimmunity. Evidence suggests that the composition of the intestinal microbiota can influence susceptibility to chronic disease of the intestinal tract including ulcerative colitis, Crohn's disease, celiac disease and irritable bowel syndrome, as well as more systemic diseases such as obesity, type 1 diabetes and type 2 diabetes. Interestingly, a considerable shift in diet has coincided with increased incidence of many of these inflammatory diseases. It was originally believed that the composition of the intestinal microbiota was relatively stable from early childhood; however, recent evidence suggests that diet can cause dysbiosis, an alteration in the composition of the microbiota, which could lead to aberrant immune responses. The role of the microbiota and the potential for diet-induced dysbiosis in inflammatory conditions of the GI tract and systemic diseases will be discussed.},

The Life Sciences Research Organization, Inc. (LSRO) held a workshop, Prebiotics and the Health Benefits of Fiber: Future Research and Goals, in February 2011 to assess the current state of the science and the international regulatory environment for prebiotics, identify research gaps, and create a strategy for future research. A developing body of evidence supports a role for prebiotics in reducing the risk and severity of GI infection and inflammation, including diarrhea, inflammatory bowel disease, and ulcerative colitis as well as bowel function disorders, including irritable bowel syndrome. Prebiotics also increase the bioavailability and uptake of minerals and data suggest that they reduce the risk of obesity by promoting satiety and weight loss. Additional research is needed to define the relationship between the consumption of different prebiotics and improvement of human health. New information derived from the characterization of the composition and function of different prebiotics as well as the interactions among and between gut microbiota and the human host would improve our understanding of the effects of prebiotics on health and disease and could assist in surmounting regulatory issues related to prebiotic use.},

   abstract = {Besides their possible effects on the development of inflammatory bowel disease (IBD), some environmental factors can modulate the clinical course of both ulcerative colitis (UC) and Crohn's disease (CD). This review is mainly devoted to describing the current knowledge of the impact of some of these factors on the outcome of IBD, with special emphasis on smoking and diet. Although the impact of smoking on the susceptibility to develop CD and UC is firmly established, its influence on the clinical course of both diseases is still debatable. In CD, active smoking is a risk factor for postoperative recurrence. Beyond this clinical setting, smoking cessation seems to be advantageous in those CD patients who were smokers at disease diagnosis, while smoking resumption may be of benefit in ex-smokers with resistant UC. The role of dietary habits on the development of IBD is far from being well established. Also, food intolerances are very frequent, but usually inconsistent among IBD patients, and therefore no general dietary recommendations can be made in these patients. In general, IBD patients should eat a diet as varied as possible. Regarding the possible therapeutic role of some dietary components in IBD, lessons should be drawn from the investigation of the primary therapeutic effect of enteral nutrition in CD. Low-fat diets seem to be particularly useful. Also, some lipid sources, such as olive oil, medium-chain triglycerides, and perhaps omega-3 fatty acids, might have a therapeutic effect. Fermentable fiber may have a role in preventing relapses in inactive UC.},

   abstract = {BACKGROUND & AIM: Despite their well known anti-inflammatory actions, the clinical usefulness of omega-3 PUFA in inflammatory bowel disease is controversial. We aimed to systematically review the available data on the performance of omega-3 PUFA as therapeutic agents in these patients. METHODS: Electronic databases were systematically searched for RCT of fish oil or omega-3 PUFA therapy in both active and inactive ulcerative colitis or Crohn's disease, without limitation on either the length of therapy or the form it was given, including nutritional supplements and enteral formula diets. Eligible articles were assessed for methodological quality on the basis of the adequacy of the randomisation process, concealment of allocation, blinding of intervention and outcome, possible biases, and completeness of follow-up. The five-point Oxford quality score was calculated. RESULTS: A total of 19 RCT were finally selected for this review. Overall, available data do not allow to support the use of omega-3 PUFA supplementation for the treatment of both active and inactive inflammatory bowel disease. Negative results are quite consistent in trials assessing the use of omega-3 PUFA to maintain disease remission, particularly ulcerative colitis, and to a lesser extent Crohn's disease. Trials on their use in active disease do not allow to draw firm conclusions mainly because the heterogeneity of design (ulcerative colitis) or their short number (Crohn's disease). In most trials, the appropriateness of the selected placebo is questionable. CONCLUSION: The present systematic review does not allow to make firm recommendations about the usefulness of omega-3 PUFA in inflammatory bowel disease.},

   abstract = {INTRODUCTION: Despite the fact that the frequency of hypolactasia and lactose intolerance is similar in both chronic idiopathic ulcerative colitis patients and the general population, the elimination of dairy products from the patient's diet is a habitual recommendation. Hypolactasia is common in Mexico, but its relation to chronic idiopathic ulcerative colitis has not been established. AIMS: To evaluate lactose digestion and lactose intolerance in persons with chronic idiopathic ulcerative colitis. MATERIAL AND METHODS: Thirty-nine patients with confirmed chronic idiopathic ulcerative colitis diagnosis were included in the study (mean: 31 years, range: 15 to 38). Twenty-two patients presented with rectosigmoid involvement and the remaining patients with pancolitis. No patient showed inflammatory activity according to the Truelove-Witts criteria and all consumed dairy products before diagnosis. A prospective, controlled, double-blind, cross-over study was designed. Patients randomly received 12.5 g of lactose or maltose in 250 cc water- each test 72 hours apart - and ydrogen was measured in exhaled air before disaccharide ingestion and then every 30 minutes for 3 hours. Digestion was considered deficient when there was an increase in hydrogen of at least 20 ppm. Symptom intensities were evaluated by Visual Analog Scales before, during, and after the hydrogen test. Differences between the groups were contrasted with the Mann-Whitney U and the Wilcoxon tests. RESULTS: Eighteen patients (46%) presented with deficient lactose digestion. No significant differences were found in the symptoms, extension, or progression of chronic idiopathic ulcerative colitis between patients that could digest and those that could not digest lactose. No patient had symptom exacerbation with the disaccharides used. CONCLUSIONS: Lactose digestion deficiency frequency is similar in subjects with chronic idiopathic ulcerative colitis and in healthy individuals in Mexico. We do not know whether higher doses could have some effect, but symptoms in patients with inactive chronic idiopathic ulcerative colitis were not modified using 12.5 g of lactose/day.},

METHODS: this study included patients who were graded as having moderate/severe UC and received corticosteroids as first-line therapy. Demographic, clinical and laboratory findings and pediatric ulcerative colitis activity scores (PUCAS) were recorded. Response to corticosteroids was assessed 30 days after the induction and long-term therapy. RESULTS: twenty-eight children were diagnosed as having moderate/severe UC. Their mean age +/- SD was 1 2.2 +/- 4 years, and 17% were under 5 years of age. PUCAS at their initial admission was 56.9 +/- 11.8. UC was observed at the left colon in 9 patients (32.1%), and pancolitis in 19 (67.9%). At the end of the 30th day, UC was completely remitted in 15 patients (53.5%), partially remitted in 2 (7.1%), and no response in 11 (39.2%). Short-term follow-up showed partial remission in 2 patients, and overall remission with steroid in 17 (60.7%). Non-responders were given second-line treatment; steroid dependency was documented in 2 patients (7.1%) and another 2 (7.1%) patients underwent colectomy. Predictors for steroid non-response were analyzed and only PUCAS at the initial admission was found to be associated with non-response to steroids (51.4 +/- 11.4 vs. 65.4 +/- 6.8, P<0.05). CONCLUSIONS: approximately half of the pediatric patients had complete response to steroid therapy in a long period. PUCAS could be used as a potential marker of "failed response" to steroid, but should be supported with a number of prospective randomized controlled studies.},

Ex-smokers may have a more refractory disease course and anecdotal evidence in non-controlled clinical trials have suggested that smoking resumption, or the administration of nicotine, may ameliorate signs and symptoms of UC in ex-smokers. We report outcomes of ex-smokers with refractory UC who resumed low-dose cigarette smoking. METHODS: 17 ex-smokers with refractory UC were identified. Clinical remission was defined as a disease activity index score of 0. RESULTS: Two out of 17 patients refused the recommendation to resume smoking. Of the 15 patients who resumed smoking, the mean daily number of cigarettes was 8.6. Fourteen out of those 15 patients who resumed smoking were able to maintain prolonged clinical remission off steroids. One out of the 15 patients failed to improve and required oral steroids. Another patient was compelled to quit smoking since he became addicted. His disease flared after maintaining a prolonged remission of 3 years and he eventually underwent surgery. Three out of these 15 patients switched from cigarettes smoking to nicotine compounds and continued to maintain remission. CONCLUSION: Resumption of low dose smoking in a selected group of ex-smokers with refractory UC may ameliorate signs and symptoms. Quality of life, medication side effects, and smoking risk factors should all be considered and discussed with patients. Smokers should be meticulously followed for compliance with "low-dose" regimen and all associated smoking risks.},

   abstract = {BACKGROUND: Aspirin has detrimental effects on the gastrointestinal tract mucosa and may play a role in the aetiology of inflammatory bowel disease. AIM: To investigate if the regular use of aspirin is associated with the development of Crohn's disease (CD) and ulcerative colitis (UC) using, for the first time, a prospective cohort study design. METHODS: A total of 135,780 men and women in Europe, aged 30-74years, were recruited into the European Prospective Investigation into Cancer and Nutrition study. Participants completed questionnaires at baseline detailing their regular aspirin use and were then followed up to identify those who developed either incident CD or UC. Each case was matched with four controls and odds ratios (OR) were calculated, adjusting for cigarette smoking. Potential interactions between aspirin and smoking were assessed. RESULTS: A total of 35 participants developed CD and a further 84 were diagnosed with UC. Regular aspirin intake was positively associated with the risk of developing CD (OR=6.14, 95% CI=1.76-21.35). In those who took aspirin and smoked there was no detectable increased risk of CD (OR=0.30, 95% CI=0.03-3.08). No association was found between regular aspirin use and UC (OR=1.29, 95% CI=0.67-2.46). CONCLUSIONS: A strong positive association between regular aspirin use and CD, but not UC, was observed. The data suggest that regular aspirin use should be measured in epidemiological work on CD. If such findings are consistent in other work then aspirin may affect the development of CD in a middle-aged to elderly population.},

   abstract = {PURPOSE: We evaluated the risk factors for late complications and functional outcome after total proctocolectomy (TPC) with ileal pouch-anal anastomosis (IPAA) for ulcerative colitis (UC). METHODS: Pre- and postoperative clinical status and follow-up data were obtained for 55 patients who underwent TPC with IPAA between 1999 and 2010. The median follow-up duration was 4.17 years. Late complications were defined as those that appeared at least one month after surgery. For a functional assessment, telephone interviews were conducted using the Global Assessment of Functioning Scale. Twenty-eight patients completed the interview. RESULTS: Late complications were found in 20 cases (36.3%), comprising pouchitis (n = 8), bowel obstruction (n = 5), ileitis (n = 3), pouch associated fistula (n = 2), and intra-abdominal infection (n = 2). The preoperative serum albumin level for patients with late complications was lower than for patients without (2.4 +/- 0.5 vs. 2.9 +/- 0.7, P = 0.04). Functional outcomes were not significantly associated with clinical characteristics, follow-up duration, operation indication, or late complications. CONCLUSION: This study demonstrated that a low preoperative albumin level could be a risk factor for late complications of TPC with IPAA. Preoperative nutritional support, especially albumin, could reduce late complications. Functional outcomes are not related to late complications.},

   abstract = {T-helper (Th) cells play a major role in initiating and shaping the pathologic response in inflammatory bowel disease (IBD). Glutamine (GLN) is a nutrient with immune-modulating effects. This study investigated the effect of GLN on cytokine expressions and inflammatory responses of three subsets of Th cells in dextran sulfate sodium (DSS)-induced IBD. There were one normal control (NC) and two DSS groups. Mice in the DSS groups drank distilled water containing 3% DSS for 5 days, whereas the NC group received distilled water. Mice in the G-DSS group were given intraperitoneal injection of 0.5 g GLN/kg/d for 3 days before receiving DSS water. The other DSS group (C-DSS) received an identical amount of amino acid solution without GLN. After induction of IBD, the mice were allowed to recover for 3 days and then were sacrificed. Blood and colon samples were collected for further analysis. The C-DSS group had higher percentages of blood interleukin (IL)-17A, IL-17F, IL-22, IL-4 and interferon-gamma than the NC group. The G-DSS group had lower Th1/Th17/Th2 cytokine expressions, which showed no differences from the NC group. Plasma haptoglobin, colon immunoglobin G and chemokine levels and myeloperoxidase activities were higher in the DSS groups than the NC group. These parameters were significantly lower in the G-DSS than the C-DSS group. These results suggest that pretreatment with GLN suppressed Th-associated cytokine expressions and may consequently reduce inflammatory mediator production and leukocyte infiltration into tissues, thus ameliorating the severity of acute DSS-induced colitis.},

   abstract = {In inflammatory bowel diseases (IBD), it is known that besides genetic and environmental factors (e.g. diet, drugs, stress), the microbiota play an important role in the pathogenesis. Patients with IBD have an altered microbiota (dysbiosis) and therefore, probiotics, defined as 'live micro-organisms that when administered in adequate amounts can confer a health benefit on the host', have been suggested as nutritional supplements to restore these imbalances. The best response on probiotics among the different types of IBD appears to be in the case of ulcerative colitis. Although probiotics show promise in IBD in both clinical and animal studies, further mechanistic studies are necessary to optimize the use of probiotics as supporting therapy in IBD. Murine models of experimental colitis have been used for decades to study this pathology, and these models have been proven useful to search for new therapeutic approaches. The purpose of this review is to summarize probiotic-host interaction studies in murine models of experimental colitis and to evaluate how these models can further help in understanding these complex interactions. Unraveling the molecular mechanisms behind the beneficial effects will assist in better and possibly more efficient probiotic formulations.},

   abstract = {Inflammatory bowel disease (IBD), consisting of Crohn's disease and ulcerative colitis (UC), results in substantial morbidity and is difficult to treat. New strategies for adjunct therapies are needed. One candidate is the semi-essential amino acid, L-arginine (L-Arg), a complementary medicine purported to be an enhancer of immunity and vitality in the lay media. Using dextran sulfate sodium (DSS) as a murine colonic injury and repair model with similarities to human UC, we assessed the effect of L-Arg, as DSS induced increases in colonic expression of the y(+) cationic amino acid transporter 2 (CAT2) and L-Arg uptake. L-Arg supplementation improved the clinical parameters of survival, body weight loss, and colon weight, and reduced colonic permeability and the number of myeloperoxidase-positive neutrophils in DSS colitis. Luminex-based multi-analyte profiling demonstrated that there was a marked reduction in proinflammatory cytokine and chemokine expression with L-Arg treatment. Genomic analysis by microarray demonstrated that DSS-treated mice supplemented with L-Arg clustered more closely with mice not exposed to DSS than to those receiving DSS alone, and revealed that multiple genes that were upregulated or downregulated with DSS alone exhibited normalization of expression with L-Arg supplementation. Additionally, L-Arg treatment of mice with DSS colitis resulted in increased ex vivo migration of colonic epithelial cells, suggestive of increased capacity for wound repair. Because CAT2 induction was sustained during L-Arg treatment and inducible nitric oxide (NO) synthase (iNOS) requires uptake of L-Arg for generation of NO, we tested the effect of L-Arg in iNOS(-/-) mice and found that its benefits in DSS colitis were eliminated. These preclinical studies indicate that L-Arg supplementation could be a potential therapy for IBD, and that one mechanism of action may be functional enhancement of iNOS activity.},

   abstract = {In the West, the incidence and prevalence of inflammatory bowel diseases has increased in the past 50 years, up to 8-14/100,000 and 120-200/100,000 persons, respectively, for ulcerative colitis (UC) and 6-15/100,000 and 50-200/100,000 persons, respectively, for Crohn's disease (CD). Studies of migrant populations and populations of developing countries demonstrated a recent, slow increase in the incidence of UC, whereas that of CD remained low, but CD incidence eventually increased to the level of UC. CD and UC are incurable; they begin in young adulthood and continue throughout life. The anatomic evolution of CD has been determined from studies of postoperative recurrence; CD begins with aphthous ulcers that develop into strictures or fistulas. Lesions usually arise in a single digestive segment; this site tends to be stable over time. Strictures and fistulas are more frequent in patients with ileal disease, whereas Crohn's colitis remains uncomplicated for many years. Among patients with CD, intestinal surgery is required for as many as 80% and a permanent stoma required in more than 10%. In patients with UC, the lesions usually remain superficial and extend proximally; colectomy is required for 10%-30% of patients. Prognosis is difficult to determine. The mortality of patients with UC is not greater than that of the population, but patients with CD have greater mortality than the population. It has been proposed that only aggressive therapeutic approaches, based on treatment of early recurrent lesions in asymptomatic individuals, have a significant impact on progression of these chronic diseases.},

   abstract = {OBJECTIVES: Unintended variation in the care of patients with Crohn disease (CD) and ulcerative colitis (UC) may prevent achievement of optimal outcomes. We sought to improve chronic care delivery and outcomes for children with inflammatory bowel disease by using network-based quality improvement methods. METHODS: By using a modified Breakthrough Series collaborative structure, 6 ImproveCareNow Network care centers tested changes in chronic illness care and collected data monthly. We used an interrupted time series design to evaluate the impact of these changes. RESULTS: Data were available for 843 children with CD and 345 with UC. Changes in care delivery were associated with an increase in the proportion of visits with complete disease classification, measurement of thiopurine methyltransferase (TPMT) before initiation of thiopurines, and patients receiving an initial thiopurine dose appropriate to their TPMT status. These were significant in both populations for all process variables (P < .01) except for measurement of TPMT in CD patients (P = .12). There were significant increases in the proportion of CD (55%-68%) and UC (61%-72%) patients with inactive disease. There was also a significant increase in the proportion of CD patients not taking prednisone (86%-90%). Participating centers varied in the success of achieving these changes. CONCLUSIONS: Improvements in the outcomes of patients with CD and UC were associated with improvements in the process of chronic illness care. Variation in the success of implementing changes suggests the importance of overcoming organizational factors related to quality improvement success.},

   abstract = {BACKGROUND: Cathepsin G (Cat-G) is a neutrophil serine-protease found in the colonic lumen of ulcerative colitis (UC) patients. Cat-G is able to activate protease-activated receptor-4 (PAR(4) ) located at the apical side of enterocytes, leading to epithelial barrier disruption. However, the mechanisms through which Cat-G triggers inflammation are not fully elucidated. The aims of our study were to evaluate in vivo the effects of UC fecal supernatants and Cat-G on epithelial barrier function and inflammation, and the connection between these two parameters. METHODS: Male balb/c mice were used in this study. We evaluated the effect of a 2-hour intracolonic infusion of 1) fecal supernatants from UC patients pretreated or not with specific Cat-G inhibitor (SCGI); 2) PAR(4) -activating peptide (PAR(4) -AP); and 3) Cat-G on colonic myeloperoxidase (MPO) activity and paracellular permeability (CPP). The involvement of PAR(4) was assessed by pretreating animals with pepducin P4pal-10, which blocks PAR(4) signaling. We investigated the role of myosin light chain (MLC) kinase by using its inhibitor, ML-7, and we determined phosphorylated MLC (pMLC) levels in mice colonic mucosa. RESULTS: UC fecal supernatants, Cat-G, and PAR(4) agonist increased both CPP and MPO activity in comparison with healthy subjects fecal supernatants. ML-7 inhibited the CPP increase triggered by Cat-G by 92.3%, and the enhanced MPO activity by 43.8%. Intracolonic infusion of UC fecal supernatant determined an increased phosphorylation level of MLC. CONCLUSIONS: These observations support that luminal factors such as Cat-G play an important proinflammatory role in the pathogenesis of colitis, mainly depending on CPP increase by MLC phosphorylation.},

METHODS: We included 16 of 31 patients who underwent colectomy for ulcerative colitis before 20 years of age between 1980 and 2005 at University of California in San Francisco Benioff Children's Hospital. A disease-specific QOL questionnaire (Inflammatory Bowel Disease Questionnaire-32), validated for adults, was used to determine QOL and an additional questionnaire addressing bowel function and reproductive health in long-term follow-up of these patients. RESULTS: Median age at the time of survey was 20.3 years (17.9-25.3), and time postcolectomy was 6.9 years (4.8-9.0). Mean total score was 159.7 +/- 43.3 (58-210). Two patients (12.5%) had scores of >/= 200, 12 (75.0%) had 101 to 199, and 2 (12.5%) had </= 100. Patients ages 18 years or younger at the time of survey showed higher QOL, particularly in emotional health (P=0.020), social function (P=0.014), and overall QOL (P=0.009). Social function scored highest of all of the systems (median 7; interquartile range 4-7). Patients with scores </= 100 had repeated episodes of pouchitis (16-30) compared with the other 14 patients (0-3). Children who were diagnosed ages 12 years or younger tended to have higher QOL (p=0.072). Years postcolectomy did not correlate to QOL. Eleven patients were sexually active. Two males had feelings of impotence and decreased libido, and 6 females experienced dyspareunia. Three women tried unsuccessfully to conceive after colectomy. One woman became pregnant 4 times, each leading to miscarriage. CONCLUSIONS: Younger age at time of colectomy, diagnosis, and survey show higher QOL. Highest satisfaction was found in ability to attend school, work, and social engagements. Pouchitis continued to be an issue for a small number of the patients, with 2 patients having recurring episodes that severely affected QOL. Patients reported decreased sexual activity and fertility at the time of survey due to colectomy, especially for females.},

   abstract = {OBJECTIVES: Cardiovascular complications have been frequently described in Inflammatory Bowel Disease (IBD). Both Crohn disease and Ulcerative Colitis are characterized by malabsorption of some micronutrients, such as carnitine, which is a very important element for myocardial metabolism, being demonstrated that its deficiency correlates with heart involvement in coeliac disease. Aims of this study are to evaluate cardiac function in IBD patients asymptomatic for cardiovascular diseases and to correlate the cardiac data with the profile of carnitine esters plasma levels. MATERIALS AND METHODS: The study was carried out on 20 IBD patients by comparison with 18 sex- and age-matched clinically healthy controls. Personal and familial history, physical examination, standard electrocardiogram and echocardiogram were performed in all subjects. Complete panel of nutritional status parameters and serum levels of free carnitine and its esters were evaluated both in IBD patients and control subjects. RESULTS: Isovaleryl-carnitine, Tiglyl-carnitine, Octenoylcarnitine and Decanoyl-carnitine, were found to be significantly lower in IBD patients. Significant correlations were found between some carnitine esters and echocardiographic parameters although total and free carnitine were meanly more elevated in IBD. No statistically significant differences in echocardiographic parameters were found between IBD patients and control subjects. CONCLUSIONS: Deficiency of some isoforms of carnitine, especially those esterified with short chain fatty acids, may play an important role in cardiac involvement in course of IBD and could lead, over time, to dilated cardiomiopathy.},

   abstract = {Crohn's disease and ulcerative colitis can be grouped as the inflammatory bowel diseases (IBD). These conditions have become increasingly common in recent years, including in children and young people. Although much is known about aspects of the pathogenesis of these diseases, the precise aetiology is not yet understood, and there remains no cure. Recent data has illustrated the importance of a number of genes-several of these are important in the onset of IBD in early life, including in infancy. Pain, diarrhoea and weight loss are typical symptoms of paediatric Crohn's disease whereas bloody diarrhoea is more typical of colitis in children. However, atypical symptoms may occur in both conditions: these include isolated impairment of linear growth or presentation with extra-intestinal manifestations such as erythema nodosum. Growth and nutrition are commonly compromised at diagnosis in both Crohn's disease and colitis. Consideration of possible IBD and completion of appropriate investigations are essential to ensure prompt diagnosis, thereby avoiding the consequences of diagnostic delay. Patterns of disease including location and progression of IBD in childhood differ substantially from adult-onset disease. Various treatment options are available for children and adolescents with IBD. Exclusive enteral nutrition plays a central role in the induction of remission of active Crohn's disease. Medical and surgical therapies need to considered within the context of a growing and developing child. The overall management of these chronic conditions in children should include multi-disciplinary expertise, with focus upon maintaining control of gut inflammation, optimising nutrition, growth and quality of life, whilst preventing disease or treatment-related complications.},

   abstract = {OBJECTIVE: In 2005, the Inflammatory Bowel Disease (IBD) Working Group of the European Society for Pediatric Gastroenterology, Hepatology, and Nutrition published consensus guidelines on the diagnostic workup of paediatric IBD, the Porto criteria. According to these guidelines, children suspected of having IBD should undergo an oesophagogastroduodenoscopy (OGD), ileocolonoscopy, and (except in cases of definitive ulcerative colitis) adequate imaging of the small bowel. To audit and evaluate the diagnostic workup of paediatric patients with IBD in Europe, the Working Group created EUROKIDS, a prospective, Web-based registry of newly diagnosed paediatric patients with IBD. METHODS: Patients with IBD (ages 0-18 years) were registered in 44 centres in 18 countries. Data on diagnostic workup were analysed according to the year of diagnosis, type of IBD, and centre size. Diagnostic yield of OGD and ileal intubation were evaluated. RESULTS: Between 2004 and 2009, 2087 newly diagnosed patients were correctly registered. Both OGD and ileocolonoscopy had been performed in 64% of all of the patients and increased significantly from year 1 (52 %) to 5 (71%, P < 0.001). Small-bowel follow-through use decreased during the years (year 1 n = 213, year 5 n = 108; P < 0.001), whereas magnetic resonance imaging use increased (year 1 n = 25, year 5 n = 171; P < 0.001). Patients diagnosed as having Crohn disease (CD, 59%) and ulcerative colitis (58%) were more likely to have had a complete diagnostic workup than patients diagnosed as having IBD unclassified (45%). In CD, the diagnostic yield of OGD was 7.5% and the yield of ileal intubation was 13%. CONCLUSIONS: The quality of diagnostic workup in paediatric patients with IBD increased steadily between 2004 and 2009. Small-bowel imaging by magnetic resonance imaging superseded the use of small-bowel follow-through. OGD and ileal intubation contributed to a definitive diagnosis of CD.},

   abstract = {To the best of our knowledge, no cases of ulcerative colitis (UC) mimicking Henoch-Schonlein purpura (HSP) have been reported so far. During a 28-year period 5635 patients were followed up at our Pediatric Rheumatology Unit and 357 had HSP according to the European League Against Rheumatism, the Paediatric Rheumatology International Trials Organisation and the Paediatric Rheumatology European Society validated classification criteria. At the same period, 148 patients with IBD according to the European Society for Paediatric Gastroenterology, Hepatology and Nutrition criteria were followed up at the Pediatric Gastroenterology Unit in our University Hospital. Only two of them had vasculitis, as an extra intestinal manifestation of UC mimicking HSP, and fulfilled both disease criteria. A 2-year old girl had bloody diarrhoea, severe abdominal pain, arthritis in ankles, petechiae and palpable purpura not related to thrombocytopenia in lower limbs. A 5-year old boy had bloody diarrhoea, palpable purpura in buttocks, lower limbs, penis and scrotum associated with arthritis in knees, orchitis in right testicle and periarticular swelling in hands and feet. Their ileocolonoscopy showed diffuse mucosal erythema, oedema, friability and multiple irregular ulcers, and histopathological examination of colonic specimen revealed diffuse chronic mucosal inflammation, crypt distortion and crypt abscesses suggesting ulcerative colitis. There were no signs of intestinal vasculitis in both cases. In conclusion, this is the first study in a paediatric population that evidenced palpable purpura associated with UC mimicking HSP.},

   abstract = {BACKGROUND: Defective detoxification of sulfides leads to damage to the mucosa and may play a role in the etiology of ulcerative colitis (UC). The colonic mucosal thiosulfate sulfurtransferase (TST) enzyme removes H(2) S by conversion to the less toxic thiocyanate. In this study we measured colonic mucosal TST enzyme activity and gene expression in UC and controls. In addition, the influence of sulfides on butyrate oxidation was evaluated. METHODS: Colonic mucosal biopsies were collected from 92 UC patients and 24 controls. TST activity was measured spectrophotometrically. To assess gene expression, total RNA from biopsies was used for quantitative reverse-transcription polymerase chain reaction (RT-PCR). In 20 UC patients, gene expression was reassessed after their first treatment with infliximab. To evaluate the effect of sulfides on butyrate oxidation, biopsies were incubated with 1.5 mM NaHS. RESULTS: TST enzyme activity and gene expression were significantly decreased in UC patients vs. controls (P < 0.001). UC patients, classified into disease activity subgroups, showed a significantly decreased TST activity and gene expression in the subgroups as compared to healthy subjects (P < 0.05 for all). In 20 patients, gene expression was reassessed after their first infliximab therapy. In responders to infliximab, a significant increase in TST gene expression was observed. However, TST mRNA levels did not return to control values after therapy in the responders. In controls, but not in UC, sulfide significantly decreased butyrate oxidation. CONCLUSIONS: We found an impaired detoxification mechanism of sulfide at TST protein and RNA level in UC. Inflammation was clearly associated with the observed TST deficiency.},

   abstract = {BACKGROUND: In ulcerative colitis (UC) butyrate metabolism is impaired due to a defect in the butyrate oxidation pathway and/or transport. In the present study we correlated butyrate uptake and oxidation to the gene expression of the butyrate transporter SLC16A1 and the enzymes involved in butyrate oxidation (ACSM3, ACADS, ECHS1, HSD17B10, and ACAT2) in UC and controls. METHODS: Colonic mucosal biopsies were collected during endoscopy of 88 UC patients and 20 controls with normal colonoscopy. Butyrate uptake and oxidation was measured by incubating biopsies with (14) C-labeled Na-butyrate. To assess gene expression, total RNA from biopsies was used for quantitative reverse-transcription polymerase chain reaction (qRT-PCR). In 20 UC patients, gene expression was reassessed after treatment with infliximab. RESULTS: Butyrate uptake and oxidation were significantly decreased in UC versus controls (P < 0.001 for both). Butyrate oxidation remained significantly reduced in UC after correction for butyrate uptake (P < 0.001), suggesting that the butyrate oxidation pathway itself is also affected. Also, the mucosal gene expression of SLC16A1, ACSM3, ACADS, ECHS1, HSD17B10, and ACAT2 was significantly decreased in UC as compared with controls (P < 0.001 for all). In a subgroup of patients (n = 20), the gene expression was reassessed after infliximab therapy. In responders to therapy, a significant increase in gene expression was observed. Nevertheless, only ACSM3 mRNA levels returned to control values after therapy in the responders groups. CONCLUSIONS: The deficiency in the colonic butyrate metabolism in UC is initiated at the gene expression level and is the result of a decreased expression of SLC16A1 and enzymes in the beta-oxidation pathway of butyrate.},

The aim of the present study was to determine the effect of administration of GBF on serum TNF-alpha, IL-6 and -8 levels in UC patients in remission. METHODS: Forty-one patients with UC were divided into two groups, namely control and GBF group. Twenty-one patients in the control group received standard treatment while 20 patients in the GBF group received 30 g of GBF daily by oral administration during two months of the study along with standard drug therapy. RESULTS: Levels of TNF-alpha, IL-6 and -8 all decreased in the GBF group compared with baseline during the two-month study, while in the control group all values rose. For IL-6 and -8 this effect was significant, P = 0.034 and 0.013, respectively. CONCLUSIONS: The results of the present study showed that the consumption of GBF may reduce the level of serum TNF-alpha, IL-6 and -8 in patients with UC. This investigation was designed as a pilot study and the results may provide a basis for more future clinical trials.},

   abstract = {Infliximab has demonstrated its efficacy in moderate to severe ulcerative colitis. The Active Ulcerative Colitis Trial (ACT) -1 and 2 have demonstrated the beneficial impact of infliximab on the short-term colectomy rate. However, data evaluating this outcome beyond one year remains scarce. To provide evidence on the potential impact of infliximab on the long-term colectomy rate in patients suffering from ulcerative colitis, data was reviewed from randomized and controlled studies, referral centre studies and population-based studies, in adult and pediatric populations. In the pre-biologic era, 9-33%, 50% and 29% of adult patients with ulcerative colitis underwent colectomy in clinical trials, referral center studies and population-based cohorts, respectively. In the pediatric population, 9-61% and 8-20% underwent colectomy in referral centers and population-based cohorts, respectively. Between 10 and 36% of adult patients treated with infliximab for ulcerative colitis underwent colectomy in clinical trials, referral center studies and population-based cohorts. In the pediatric population treated with infliximab, long-term data is lacking, with colectomy rates ranging from 16 to 28%. Whether infliximab proves to be a disease modifying treatment in ulcerative colitis in the long term remains to be elucidated and will require further long-term prospective studies.},

   abstract = {OBJECTIVE: There is increasing knowledge of the pathophysiology behind inflammatory bowel disease (IBD) although the exact mechanism is far from fully understood. In the era of new technology, over the last years molecular approaches have shed light on the inflammatory mechanisms and their metabolic end products. This opens for a molecular fingerprinting that can be used in the biomarker field of IBD. There is a great need of biomarkers for prediction of clinical outcome and prognostic biomarker for prediction of therapeutic effects in IBD. Although the biomarker concept is old, so far very few really useful biomarkers exist in IBD. MATERIAL AND METHODS: Here, we review the predictive and prognostic biomarkers in IBD in the era of new technologies with emphasis on the potential of molecular fingerprinting. RESULTS: Very few candidate biomarkers have been documented. The most promising candidate predictor is tumor necrosis factor-alpha, but there is a lack of validation. CONCLUSION: So far, there are few biomarkers documented in IBD, but we are at the start of a new scientific field that will be of great value for the handling of the disease.},

OBJECTIVE: To study the gene and protein expression of IL-10 in the mucosa from patients with ulcerative colitis (UC). METHODS: We studied 40 patients with UC and 18 controls without endoscopic evidence of intestinal inflammation. From rectal biopsies was determined the gene expression of IL- 10 by real time polymerase chain reaction (PCR). The detection of the protein in tissue was performed by immunohistochemistry. RESULTS: patients with UC in remission had significantly higher expression of il-10 gene in mucosa compared to the group of patients with active UC (p = 0.01) and the control group (p = 0.05). All patients with active UC had pancolitis, while patients in remission from distal inflammation, 16 had extra-intestinal manifestations and 23 had mild to moderate inflammation with less than one relapse within a year. Patients with UC in remission had significantly higher expression of IL-10 gene in mucosa compared with the group of patients with active UC (p = 0.01) or the control group (p = 0.05). CONCLUSIONS: The expression of IL-10 gene is increased in colonic mucosa from patients with UC in remission, confirming that it is an immunoregulatory cytokine that promotes remission in patients with UC.},

   abstract = {BACKGROUND AND AIMS: Increasing use of diagnostic radiography has led to concern about the malignant potential of ionizing radiation. We aimed to quantify the cumulative effective dose (CED) from diagnostic medical imaging in children with inflammatory bowel disease (IBD) and to identify which children are at greatest risk for high amounts of image-related radiation exposure. PATIENTS AND METHODS: A retrospective chart review of pediatric IBD patients seen between January 1 and May 30, 2008 was conducted. The effective dose of radiation received from all of the radiology tests performed during the course of each patient's treatment was estimated using typical effective doses and our institution's computed tomography dose index. A CED >/=50 mSv was considered high. RESULTS: Complete records were available for 257 of 372 screened subjects. One hundred seventy-one had Crohn disease (CD) and 86 had ulcerative colitis (UC). The mean CED was 17.56 +/- 15.91 mSv and was greater for children with CD than for those with UC (20.5 +/- 17.5 vs 11.7 +/- 9.9 mSv, P < 0.0001). Fifteen children (5.8%) had a CED >/=50 mSv, including 14 of 171 (8.2%) with CD and 1 of 86 (1.2%) with UC (P = 0.02). In children with CD, factors associated with high CED per multivariate analysis were any IBD-related surgery (odds ratio 42, 95% confidence interval 8-223, P < 0.0001) and platelet count (odds ratio 16, 95% confidence interval 1.5-175, P = 0.02). CONCLUSIONS: Although all doses of ionizing radiation have some malignancy-inducing potential, a small but important percentage of children with IBD are exposed to particularly high doses of ionizing radiation from diagnostic tests and procedures. Physicians caring for such patients must seek to limit radiation exposure whenever possible to lessen the lifetime risk of malignancy.},

   abstract = {Inflammatory bowel diseases (IBDs), Crohn's disease (CD), and ulcerative colitis (UC) are chronic inflammatory conditions, which are increasing in incidence, prevalence, and severity, in many countries. While there is genetic susceptibility to IBD, the probability of disease development is modified by diet, lifestyle, and endogenous factors, including the gut microbiota. For example, high intakes of mono- and disaccharides, and total fats consistently increases the risk developing both forms of IBD. High vegetable intake reduces the risk of UC, whereas increased fruit and/or dietary fiber intake appears protective against CD. Low levels of certain micronutrients, especially vitamin D, may increase the risk of both diseases. Dietary patterns may be even more important to disease susceptibility than the levels of individual foods or nutrients. Various dietary regimes may modify disease symptoms, in part through their actions on the host microbiota. Both probiotics and prebiotics may modulate the microflora, and reduce the likelihood of IBD regression. However, other dietary factors affect the microbiota in different ways. Distinguishing cause from effect, and characterizing the relative roles of human and microbial genes, diet, age of onset, gender, life style, smoking history, ethnic background, environmental exposures, and medications, will require innovative and internationally integrated approaches.},

   abstract = {Chronic inflammatory disorders such as inflammatory bowel diseases (IBDs) affect bone metabolism and are frequently associated with the presence of osteopenia, osteoporosis, and increased risk of fractures. Although several mechanisms may contribute to skeletal abnormalities in IBD patients, inflammation and inflammatory mediators such as TNF, IL-1beta, and IL-6 may be the most critical. It is not clear whether the changes in bone metabolism leading to decreased mineral density are the result of decreased bone formation, increased bone resorption, or both, with varying results reported in experimental models of IBD and in pediatric and adult IBD patients. New data, including our own, challenge the conventional views, and contributes to the unraveling of an increasingly complex network of interactions leading to the inflammation-associated bone loss. Since nutritional interventions (dietary calcium and vitamin D supplementation) are of limited efficacy in IBD patients, understanding the pathophysiology of osteopenia and osteoporosis in Crohn's disease and ulcerative colitis is critical for the correct choice of available treatments or the development of new targeted therapies. In this review, we discuss current concepts explaining the effects of inflammation, inflammatory mediators and their signaling effectors on calcium and phosphate homeostasis, osteoblast and osteoclast function, and the potential limitations of vitamin D used as an immunomodulator and anabolic hormone in IBD.},

   abstract = {Pouchitis is a non-specific inflammation of the ileal reservoir and the most common complication of proctocolectomy with ileal pouch-anal anastomosis (IPAA) in patients with ulcerative colitis. Its frequency is related to the duration of the follow up, occurring in up to 50% of patients 10 years after IPAA in large series from major referral centers. Treatment of pouchitis is largely empirical and only small placebo-controlled trials have been conducted. The rationale for using probiotics and antibiotics in pouchitis is based on convincing evidence that implicates intestinal bacteria in the pathogenesis of this disease. Probiotics are living organisms, which, upon ingestion in certain numbers, exert health benefits beyond inherent basic nutrition. VSL#3, a highly concentrated cocktail of probiotics has been shown to be effective in the prevention of pouchitis onset and relapses. Antibiotics are the mainstay of treatment of pouchitis, and metronidazole and ciprofloxacin are the most common initial approaches, often with a rapid response. The use of antibiotics in pouchitis is largely justified although proper controlled trials have not been conducted.},

   abstract = {BACKGROUND AND AIMS: The commensal microbiota of the gastrointestinal tract plays an important role in the pathogenesis of inflammatory bowel disease. We examined the horizontal structure of the fecal microbiota in the colon in adolescents with Crohn disease or ulcerative colitis and a control group. PATIENTS AND METHODS: Fecal samples were collected in 3 fractions from patients with Crohn disease (n = 22), ulcerative colitis (n = 12), and controls (n = 24) during preparation for colonoscopy. Additionally, biopsies from colon tissue were taken. Samples were examined using a culture technique and a fluorescent in situ hybridization method. The mucin degradation assay was carried out. RESULTS: Quantitative composition of the microbiota was different in the consecutive 3 fecal fractions and in the colon tissue of the study groups, but in patients from the control group, the composition of microbiota in the consecutive fractions was similar. Statistical analyses showed that the total distribution of the studied bacterial taxons in the contents in all 3 fecal fractions and in the colon tissue in the given disease group, and in the control group was characteristic for the studied patient group. Differences in species distribution among the cohorts studied were highly significant (P < 0.0001). Moreover, it was shown that in the fecal fraction I and in the colon tissue samples, there is no significant difference for any of the analyzed bacterial groups, using the culture methods or fluorescent in situ hybridization, but significant results were demonstrated in the II and III fractions for specific bacterial groups. The bacterial flora attached to the mucus layer in the UC group had significantly more degraded mucus in comparison with the control group (P = 0.045). CONCLUSIONS: Distribution of the microbiota in the colon is layered, which can be called horizontal distribution of the fecal flora. Only in the ulcerative colitis group, the bacterial flora attached to the mucous layer exerts action on the mucin.},

Epidemiological data show an increased incidence of both UC and CD and, especially in North America and in Europe, an increased prevalence of CD. European data show that northern countries present higher rates of IBD than southern ones. It is estimated that 15%-20% of CD patients experience onset of their symptoms under 20 years of age. An increasing number of children enter disease before 8 years of age. The pathogenesis of CD has became more documented involving both the immune system and changes in intestinal microbiota. Chronic abdominal pain associated with failure to thrive and inflammatory syndrome with or without intestinal transit disorders suggest CD. Onset of a anoperineal disease is also suggestive of CD and is a severity sign. The diagnosis is based on clinical history, physical examination, radiological studies, endoscopy, and histology. CD is defined by evidence of a discontinuous chronic inflammation of the gastrointestinal tract with or without granulomas and supported by clinical, biochemical, and radiological evidence. Treatment aims to reducing inflammation and restauring growth. Enteral feeding has become a key issue in allowing to avoid steroids. Immunosuppressive treatment based on azathioprine is increasingly used for maintaining remission. Anti-TNF treatment is a rescue therapy in case of refractory, frequently relapsing disease especially those with ano-perineal disease.},

   abstract = {The role of the gut microbiome in human health and disease with a particular emphasis on therapeutic use of probiotics under specific medical conditions was mainly highlighted in 1st Annual conference of Probiotic Association of India (PAi) and International Symposium on "Probiotics for Human Health - New Innovations and Emerging Trends" held on 27th-28th August, 2012 at New Delhi, India. There is increasing recognition of the fact that dysbiosis or alteration of this gut microbiome may be implicated in gastro-intestinal disorders including diarrheal diseases, ulcerative colitis, inflammatory bowel diseases, life style diseases viz. Diabetes Mellitus-2 and obesity etc. This report summarizes the proceedings of the conference and the symposium comprehensively. Although, research on probiotics has been continuing for the past few decades, the subject has been currently the major focus of attention across the world due to recent advances and new developments in genomics, transcriptomics, proteomics, metabolomics and emergence of new generation of high through put sequencing technologies that have immensely helped in understanding the probiotic functionality and mode of action from nutritional and health perspectives. There is now sufficient evidence backed up with good quality scientific clinical data to suggest that probiotic interventions could indeed be effective in various types of diarrheal diseases, other chronic gastrointestinal inflammatory disorders like pouchitis, necrotizing entero-colitis, allergic responses and lactose intolerance etc. This report makes a modest attempt to give all the stake holders involved in development of probiotic based functional/health foods an overview of the current status of probiotics research at the Global and National level. The most crucial issues that emerged from the lead talks delivered by the eminent speakers from India and abroad were the major focus of discussions in different plenary and technical sessions. By discussing some of these issues from scientific perspectives, the conference could achieve its prime objective of disseminating the current knowledge on the prospects of probiotics as potential biotherapeutics in the management of human health and diseases.},

Genome-wide association studies identified disease-relevant single-nucleotide polymorphisms in approximately 100 genes, but at the same time twin studies also clearly indicated a strong environmental impact in disease development. However, attempts to link dietary factors to the risk of developing IBD, based on epidemiological observations showed controversial outcomes. Yet, emerging high-throughput technologies implying complete biological systems might allow taking nutrient-gene interactions into account for a better classification of patient subsets in the future. In this context, 2 new scientific fields, "nutrigenetics" and "nutrigenomics" have been established. "Nutrigenetics," studying the effect of genetic variations on nutrient-gene interactions and "Nutrigenomics," describing the impact of nutrition on physiology and health status on the level of gene transcription, protein expression, and metabolism. It is hoped that the integration of both research areas will promote the understanding of the complex gene-environment interaction in IBD etiology and in the long-term will lead to personalized nutrition for disease prevention and treatment. This review briefly summarizes data on the impact of nutrients on intestinal inflammation, highlights nutrient-gene interactions, and addresses the potential of applying "omic" technologies in the context of IBD.},

   abstract = {Intestinal epithelial cells (IEC) are organised as a single cell layer which covers the intestine. Their primary task is to absorb nutrients present in the intestinal lumen. However, IEC also play an important role in the immune defence of our body by building a barrier that separates the bowel wall from potentially hazardous bacteria present in the gut lumen. The life cycle of IEC is determined by the time span in which cells migrate from their place of origin at the crypt base to the villus tip, from where they are shed into the lumen. Cell death in the intestinal epithelium has to be tightly regulated and irregularities might cause pathologies. Excessive cell death has been associated with chronic inflammation as seen in patients with Crohn's disease and ulcerative colitis. While until recently apoptosis was discussed as being essential for epithelial turnover and tissue homeostasis in the intestinal epithelium, recent data using gene deficient mice have challenged this concept. Moreover, an apoptosis-independent mode of programmed cell death, termed necroptosis, has been identified and described in the intestinal epithelium. The following article reviews previous studies on cell death regulation in IEC and a potential role of necroptosis for gut homeostasis.},

   abstract = {Extensive research over the past half century has shown that curcumin (diferuloylmethane), a component of the golden spice turmeric (Curcuma longa), can modulate multiple cell signaling pathways. Extensive clinical trials over the past quarter century have addressed the pharmacokinetics, safety, and efficacy of this nutraceutical against numerous diseases in humans. Some promising effects have been observed in patients with various pro-inflammatory diseases including cancer, cardiovascular disease, arthritis, uveitis, ulcerative proctitis, Crohn's disease, ulcerative colitis, irritable bowel disease, tropical pancreatitis, peptic ulcer, gastric ulcer, idiopathic orbital inflammatory pseudotumor, oral lichen planus, gastric inflammation, vitiligo, psoriasis, acute coronary syndrome, atherosclerosis, diabetes, diabetic nephropathy, diabetic microangiopathy, lupus nephritis, renal conditions, acquired immunodeficiency syndrome, beta-thalassemia, biliary dyskinesia, Dejerine-Sottas disease, cholecystitis, and chronic bacterial prostatitis. Curcumin has also shown protection against hepatic conditions, chronic arsenic exposure, and alcohol intoxication. Dose-escalating studies have indicated the safety of curcumin at doses as high as 12 g/day over 3 months. Curcumin's pleiotropic activities emanate from its ability to modulate numerous signaling molecules such as pro-inflammatory cytokines, apoptotic proteins, NF-kappaB, cyclooxygenase-2, 5-LOX, STAT3, C-reactive protein, prostaglandin E(2), prostate-specific antigen, adhesion molecules, phosphorylase kinase, transforming growth factor-beta, triglyceride, ET-1, creatinine, HO-1, AST, and ALT in human participants. In clinical trials, curcumin has been used either alone or in combination with other agents. Various formulations of curcumin, including nanoparticles, liposomal encapsulation, emulsions, capsules, tablets, and powder, have been examined. In this review, we discuss in detail the various human diseases in which the effect of curcumin has been investigated.},

   abstract = {BACKGROUND: The observed heritability of inflammatory bowel disease (IBD) is incompletely explained by known genetic risk factors. Kindred-specific genetic variants that cause IBD may be a source of "missing heritability." Given that they have been previously difficult to identify, we sought to identify high-risk IBD kindreds. METHODS: We used a large population-based database--the Utah Population Database (UPDB)--which contains genealogical and healthcare data to characterize the risk of Crohn's disease (CD), ulcerative colitis (UC), and IBD in kindreds. We identified CD and UC cases using ICD-9 codes. We calculated the adjusted relative risk to relatives of affected individuals. We calculated the familial standardized incidence ratio (FSIR) to quantify the kindred-specific disease risk. RESULTS: In all, 3601 CD cases and 3976 UC cases met inclusion criteria. A total of 655 CD kindreds and 615 UC kindreds had a statistical excess of disease. Risk of disease varied among kindreds, with some kindreds demonstrating approximately 20-fold elevated risk. For CD, UC, and IBD, relative risks were significantly elevated for first- and second-degree relatives and first cousins. The adjusted population attributable risks for familial CD, UC, and IBD were 0.20 (95% confidence interval [CI]: 0.17-0.23); 0.17 (0.14-0.21); and 0.19 (0.17-0.22), respectively. CONCLUSIONS: We identified multiple kindreds with a statistical excess of CD, UC, and IBD, and validated the UPDB as a resource for family studies in IBD. Given the need for novel genetic mapping strategies to explain the apparent missing heritability in IBD, further studies of these high-risk kindreds is justified.},

   abstract = {With the use of molecular techniques, numerous studies have evaluated the composition of the intestinal microbiota in health and disease. However, it is of major interest to supplement this with a functional analysis of the microbiota. In this review, the different approaches that have been used to characterize microbial metabolites, yielding information on the functional end products of microbial metabolism, have been summarized. To analyze colonic microbial metabolites, the most conventional way is by application of a hypothesis-driven targeted approach, through quantification of selected metabolites from carbohydrate (e.g., short-chain fatty acids) and protein fermentation (e.g., p-cresol, phenol, ammonia, or H(2)S), secondary bile acids, or colonic enzymes. The application of stable isotope-labeled substrates can provide an elegant solution to study these metabolic pathways in vivo. On the other hand, a top-down approach can be followed by applying metabolite fingerprinting techniques based on (1)H-NMR or mass spectrometric analysis. Quantification of known metabolites and characterization of metabolite patterns in urine, breath, plasma, and fecal samples can reveal new pathways and give insight into physiological regulatory processes of the colonic microbiota. In addition, specific metabolic profiles can function as a diagnostic tool for the identification of several gastrointestinal diseases, such as ulcerative colitis and Crohn's disease. Nevertheless, future research will have to evaluate the relevance of associations between metabolites and different disease states.},

   abstract = {Our therapeutic goals for the treatment of ulcerative colitis and Crohn's disease are evolving. Until the last decade the goals were primarily the treatment of symptoms. Regulatory approval for ulcerative colitis therapies have been based on short-term improvements in clinical indices and, most recently, the ability to heal the colonic mucosa, whereas approval for Crohn's disease therapies have been based on reductions in the CDAI (Crohn's Disease Activity Index). Over the past decade there has been increasing evidence in favor of more 'objective' measures of biologic disease activity including biomarkers such as C-reactive protein and mucosal healing in Crohn's disease and the histologic resolution of active inflammation in ulcerative colitis. The objective changes have provided expanded therapeutic goals based on longer-term maintenance therapies with the potential to modify the chronic disease behavior and to reduce pharmacoeconomic costs (reductions in hospitalizations, surgeries and neoplasia).},

   abstract = {OBJECTIVES: : The objective of the present study was to quantify the national pediatric inpatient inflammatory bowel disease (IBD) burden in terms of the number of IBD-related hospitalizations, the number of days spent in the hospital, and hospitalization costs. METHODS: : Hospitalizations for children and adolescents 20 years and younger with a primary diagnosis of either Crohn disease (CD) or ulcerative colitis (UC) were selected from the 2006 Kids' Inpatient Database (KID). Length of the hospital stay in days (LOS) and charges for the hospitalization were found directly in the Kids' Inpatient Database, and cost was calculated using the hospital's cost-to-charge ratio. Predictor variables included patient characteristics, such as age and severity of illness, and hospital characteristics. Ordinary-least-squares regressions were developed and estimated to explain hospitalization costs. RESULTS: : In 2006, there were 10,777 IBD-related hospitalizations. The total and mean costs for CD were $66.3 million and $10,176 (95% confidence interval [CI] $9647-$10,705), and for UC were $48.6 million and $11,836 (95% CI $10,760-$12,912). For CD, 0- to 5-year-old patients had the highest mean LOS (8.10, 95% CI 5.53-10.67, days) and mean cost ($13,894, 95% CI $9053-$18,735), whereas, for UC, 11- to 15-year-old patients had the highest mean LOS (7.49, 95% CI 6.88-8.10, 95% CI 5.53-10.67, days) and mean cost ($13,407, 95% CI $11,704-$15,110). CONCLUSIONS: : For a pediatric disease with a rather low prevalence rate, the estimated annual inpatient pediatric burden of IBD is a sizeable $152.4 million (2010 US$) and 64,985 days spent in the hospital. As medications and outpatient treatments improve for the treatment of IBD, there is an opportunity for significant reduction in inpatient burden.},

   abstract = {OBJECTIVES: Long-term data on the influence of cigarette smoking, especially cessation, on the risk of Crohn's disease (CD) and ulcerative colitis (UC) are limited. METHODS: We conducted a prospective study of 229,111 women in the Nurses' Health Study (NHS) and Nurses' Health Study II (NHS II). Biennially, we collected updated data on cigarette smoking, other risk factors, and diagnoses of CD or UC confirmed by medical record review. RESULTS: Over 32 years in NHS and 18 years in NHS II, we documented 336 incident cases of CD and 400 incident cases of UC. Compared with never smokers, the multivariate hazard ratio (HR) of CD was 1.90 (95% confidence interval (CI), 1.42-2.53) among current smokers and 1.35 (95% CI, 1.05-1.73) among former smokers. Increasing pack-years was associated with increasing risk of CD (Ptrend < 0.0001), whereas smoking cessation was associated with an attenuation of risk. By contrast, the multivariate HR of UC was 0.86 (95% CI, 0.61-1.20) among current smokers and 1.56 (95% CI, 1.26-1.93) among former smokers. The risk of UC was significantly increased within 2-5 years of smoking cessation (HR, 3.06; 95% CI, 2.00-4.67) and remained persistently elevated over 20 years. CONCLUSIONS: Current smoking is associated with an increased risk of CD, but not UC. By contrast, former smoking is associated with an increased risk of UC, with risk persisting over two decades after cessation.},

   abstract = {BACKGROUND: Paediatric onset inflammatory bowel disease (IBD) may cause alterations in energy requirements and invalidate the use of standard prediction equations. Our aim was to evaluate four commonly used prediction equations for resting energy expenditure (REE) in children with IBD. METHODS: Sixty-three children had repeated measurements of REE as part of a longitudinal research study yielding a total of 243 measurements. These were compared with predicted REE from Schofield, Oxford, FAO/WHO/UNU, and Harris-Benedict equations using the Bland-Altman method. RESULTS: Mean (+/-SD) age of the patients was 14.2 (2.4) years. Mean measured REE was 1566 (336) kcal per day compared with 1491 (236), 1441 (255), 1481 (232), and 1435 (212) kcal per day calculated from Schofield, Oxford, FAO/WHO/UNU, and Harris-Benedict, respectively. While the Schofield equation demonstrated the least difference between measured and predicted REE, it, along with the other equations tested, did not perform uniformly across all subjects, indicating greater errors at either end of the spectrum of energy expenditure. Smaller differences were found for all prediction equations for Crohn's disease compared with ulcerative colitis. CONCLUSIONS: Of the commonly used equations, the equation of Schofield should be used in pediatric patients with IBD when measured values are not able to be obtained.},

   abstract = {The treatment options for inflammatory bowel disease have expanded with the introduction of biological therapies. Recently published controlled clinical trials were searched and those that impact the clinical management of ulcerative colitis (UC) are discussed in this review. In the management of mild to moderate UC, mesalamine still remains the first choice of drug. The newly developed once daily formulations have shown equal efficacy to divided doses and possibly portend better compliance owing to a simplified regimen. In outpatients with moderate to severe UC, recent data indicate that infliximab induced and maintained remission leads to decreased colectomy rates and fewer hospitalizations. An alternative anti-tumor necrosis factor (TNF) agent, adalimumab, was also recently shown to be effective for induction of remission in moderate to severe UC. The use of immunosuppressives, such as azathioprine and mercaptopurine, is associated with decreased colectomy rates and thioguanine was shown to be effective in maintaining clinical remission in those who are intolerant to azathioprine/mercaptopurine. In hospitalized patients with steroid resistant severe UC, infliximab and tacrolimus may be alternatives to cyclosporine in those who are otherwise candidates for colectomy. Adequate long-term maintenance therapy with immunosuppressives or anti-TNF therapy is required after rescue therapy for a sustained benefit. Future research is needed to position the available anti-TNF agents and combined immunosuppressive therapy in the treatment of UC to achieve and maintain steroid free remission.},

   abstract = {AIMS: The aim of this study was to determine the incidence of Clostridium difficile infection in hospitalized children with inflammatory bowel disease (IBD) and to compare it to other immunosuppressed patients at risk (oncology patients) as well as to immunocompetent patients. METHODS: We analyzed data from all hospitalized children who underwent stool detection of C. difficile toxins A and B (n = 757) in a 5.5-year study period. RESULTS: The number of positive tests was significantly increased in the oncology group compared to the IBD group (12.45 vs. 6.02%, p = 0.03) and immunocompetent group (12.45 vs. 5.7%, p = 0.01). Patients who had C. difficile infection used antibiotics prior to the test more often than patients who did not (12.69 vs. 1.73%, p = 0.03). Pearson's correlation was positive for C. difficile infection and both antibiotics and immunosuppressants, while no correlation was found regarding age and gender. There were no significant differences regarding either IBD diagnosis (Crohn's disease vs. ulcerative colitis, p = 0.71) or treatment used for IBD (p = 0.53) and C. difficile infection. CONCLUSION: In our setting, the incidence of C. difficile infection among hospitalized children with active IBD was found to be low. Children at increased risk for C. difficile infection were oncology patients receiving immunosuppressants and antibiotics.},

   abstract = {AIMS: To describe the change in incidence of paediatric inflammatory bowel disease (IBD) observed at the National Centre for Paediatric Gastroenterology, Hepatology and Nutrition, and to determine whether the presenting disease phenotype and disease outcomes have changed during the past decade. METHODS: The annual incidence of IBD in Irish children aged <16 years was calculated for the years 2000-2010. Two subsets of patients, group A (diagnosed between 1 January 2000 and 31 December 2001), and group B (diagnosed between 1 January and 31 December 2008) were phenotyped according to the Paris Classification. Phenotype at diagnosis and 2-year follow-up were then compared. RESULTS: 406 new cases of IBD were identified. The incidence was 2.5/100 000/year in 2001, 7.3 in 2008 and 5.6 in 2010, representing a significant increase in the number of new cases of Crohn's disease (CD) and ulcerative colitis (UC). There were 238 cases of CD; 129 of UC; and 39 of IBD unclassified. Comparing groups A and B, no differences were found in disease location at diagnosis or, for CD, in its behaviour. CONCLUSIONS: There has been a substantial and sustained increase in the incidence of childhood UC and CD in Ireland over a relatively short period of time. However, disease phenotype at diagnosis has not changed. At 2 years follow-up, CD appears to progress less frequently than in some neighbouring countries. These variations remain unexplained. Prospective longitudinal studies will help to elucidate further the epidemiology of childhood IBD.},

However, little has been published about the prevalence or characteristics of enthesitis in pediatric IBD. METHODS: We conducted a cross-sectional study of children and young adults ages 4-21 years with IBD. Subjects were recruited among those receiving routine care in a gastroenterology clinic. All subjects underwent a clinical examination of the entheses and joints, and completed a study questionnaire. RESULTS: We enrolled 43 subjects, who had a median age of 16 years and a median time from IBD diagnosis of 2.7 years. 32 subjects (74%) had Crohn disease, 10 subjects (23%) had indeterminate colitis, and 1 subject (2%) had ulcerative colitis. At least one tender enthesis was present in 21% of subjects and 12% had more than 2 tender entheses. The most commonly affected entheses were located at the inferior patella, the femoral greater trochanter, and the proximal humerus. The presence of enthesitis was associated with a higher intensity of recent musculoskeletal pain (p=0.03). CONCLUSIONS: Enthesitis is a prevalent extra-intestinal manifestation of pediatric IBD and is associated with increased musculoskeletal pain. Future studies should evaluate the functional and long-term impact of enthesitis on children with IBD.},

   abstract = {OBJECTIVES: The incidence of inflammatory bowel disease (IBD) is increasing. Dietary factors such as the spread of the "Western" diet, high in fat and protein but low in fruits and vegetables, may be associated with the increase. Although many studies have evaluated the association between diet and IBD risk, there has been no systematic review. METHODS: We performed a systematic review using guideline-recommended methodology to evaluate the association between pre-illness intake of nutrients (fats, carbohydrates, protein) and food groups (fruits, vegetables, meats) and the risk of subsequent IBD diagnosis. Eligible studies were identified via structured keyword searches in PubMed and Google Scholar and manual searches. RESULTS: Nineteen studies were included, encompassing 2,609 IBD patients (1,269 Crohn's disease (CD) and 1,340 ulcerative colitis (UC) patients) and over 4,000 controls. Studies reported a positive association between high intake of saturated fats, monounsaturated fatty acids, total polyunsaturated fatty acids (PUFAs), total omega-3 fatty acids, omega-6 fatty acids, mono- and disaccharides, and meat and increased subsequent CD risk. Studies reported a negative association between dietary fiber and fruits and subsequent CD risk. High intakes of total fats, total PUFAs, omega-6 fatty acids, and meat were associated with an increased risk of UC. High vegetable intake was associated with a decreased risk of UC. CONCLUSIONS: High dietary intakes of total fats, PUFAs, omega-6 fatty acids, and meat were associated with an increased risk of CD and UC. High fiber and fruit intakes were associated with decreased CD risk, and high vegetable intake was associated with decreased UC risk.},

   abstract = {PURPOSE: Glutamine (Gln) is a nutrient with immunomodulatory effects in metabolic stressed conditions. This study investigated the effects of Gln on colonic-inflammatory-mediator expression and mucosal repair in mice with dextran sulfate sodium (DSS)-induced colitis. METHODS: C57BL/6 mice received distilled water containing 3 % DSS for 5 d to induce colitis. One of the DSS-treated groups was intraperitoneally injected with an alanyl (Ala)-Gln solution 3 days before (G-DSS) while the other group was administered Ala-Gln 3 days after colitis (DSS-G) was induced. The Ala-Gln solution provided 0.5 g Gln/kg/d. The saline-DSS group (S-DSS) received an identical amount of saline before and after colitis was induced to serve as a positive control. RESULTS: The S-DSS group had a shorter colon length, higher plasma haptoglobin level, and more-severe colon inflammation. Also, the toll-like receptor (TLR)4 level, nuclear factor (NF)-kappaB activation, and inflammatory cytokine gene expression in the colon were higher than those of the normal control group. Gln administration either before or after colitis suppressed TLR4 protein levels, decreased plasma haptoglobin, and reduced colon inflammation. Histological inflammatory scores were also lowered. Compared to the post-colitis Gln group, preventive use of Gln had higher colon length, expressions of mucin 2, trefoil factor 3, and heat shock protein 72 genes were also upregulated in the colon. CONCLUSIONS: These results suggest that Gln administered either before or after the colitis mitigated inflammation of colitis that was not observed in group without Gln injection. Prophylactic treatment with Gln had more-beneficial effects on reducing inflammatory markers and enhancing the recovery of mucosa in DSS-induced colitis.},

   abstract = {OBJECTIVES: For the choice of treatment in children with inflammatory bowel disease (IBD), it is important to make a distinction between Crohn disease (CD) and ulcerative colitis (UC). To look for pathognomonic features of CD, upper gastrointestinal tract (UGT) endoscopy has become part of the routine evaluation of children with suspected IBD; however, pathological changes can also be found in the UGT in patients with UC. The aims of the present study were to establish the role of UGT involvement in the diagnostic assessment of suspected IBD in children and to detect histopathological changes in the UGT mucosa, which can distinguish CD from non-CD (UC and non-IBD). METHODS: Biopsies (colon, ileum, duodenum, stomach, esophagus) from children suspected of having IBD who underwent endoscopy between 2003 and 2008 were reassessed by a blinded, expert pathologist. The histological findings of the UGT were compared with the diagnosis based on ileocolonic biopsies and the final diagnosis. RESULTS: In 11% of the children with CD, the diagnosis was based solely on the finding of granulomatous inflammation in the UGT. Focal cryptitis of the duodenum and focally enhanced gastritis were found significantly more frequently in children with CD compared with children with UC and non-IBD, with a specificity and positive predictive value of 99% and 93% and 87.1% and 78.6%, respectively. CONCLUSIONS: Histology on ileocolonic biopsies alone is insufficient for a correct diagnosis of CD or UC in children. UGT endoscopy should, therefore, be performed in the diagnostic assessment of all children suspected of having IBD.},

   abstract = {BACKGROUND & AIMS: We evaluated the efficacy and safety of infliximab for inducing and maintaining benefit in children with moderately to severely active ulcerative colitis (UC). METHODS: Patients (6-17 years old) who had active UC (Mayo scores of 6-12; endoscopic subscores >/= 2) and had not responded to or tolerated conventional treatment were given 5 mg/kg infliximab at weeks 0, 2, and 6. The primary end point was response at week 8 (decreases in Mayo scores >/= 30% and >/= 3 points and decreases in rectal bleeding subscores of >/= 1 or an absolute subscore of </= 1). At week 8, only responders were randomly assigned to groups given infliximab every 8 or 12 weeks (q8w or q12w) and followed through week 54. Maintenance end points included pediatric UC activity index scores <10 points, defined as remission. RESULTS: At week 8, infliximab induced a response in 73.3% of patients (44 of 60) (95% confidence interval, 62.1%-84.5%; a positive result was defined by 95% confidence interval lower limit >40%). Among responders, twice as many were in remission at week 54 after q8w (8 of 21, 38.1%) than q12w (4 of 22, 18.2%; P = .146) therapy. Assuming the q8w remission rate for responders, the overall remission rate at week 54 would be 28.6%. Serious adverse events and infusion reactions occurred in similar proportions in the q8w and q12w groups. No deaths, malignancies, opportunistic infections, tuberculosis, or delayed hypersensitivity reactions were reported. CONCLUSIONS: Infliximab was safe and effective, inducing a response at week 8 in 73.3% of pediatric patients with moderate to severely active UC who did not respond to conventional therapy. The overall remission rate at week 54 for all enrolled patients was 28.6%, assuming the more effective q8w remission rate.},

   abstract = {Crohn's disease and ulcerative colitis represent distinct phenotypic forms of inflammatory bowel disease and continue to be a common cause of morbidity. The corticosteroids and the immunomodulatory drugs, which are the basis of treatment for the inflammatory bowel diseases, do not assure always satisfactory outcomes. Nutrition has been used in order to modify the inflammatory response of various chronic inflammatory diseases, including Crohn's disease and ulcerative colitis. In the pathogenesis of inflammatory bowel diseases, the intestinal microflora and the intestinal mucosal disorders play a crucial role. Also, the release of reactive oxygen species is a significant factor of initiation and preservation of the inflammatory reaction in these diseases. The advantages of the nutritional treatment derive from the sequestration of intraluminal agents which may promote the inflammatory bowel response or, alternatively, nutrition is able to modify the immune response, reducing the uncontrolled inflammatory reaction. Furthermore, nutrition can enhance the mucosal barrier function and consists a significant source of antioxidants. This review focuses on certain nutritional components that modulate the inflammatory response of the bowel and aims to present a rational thesis regarding the use of nutritional agents in the management of inflammatory bowel diseases.},

   abstract = {BACKGROUND: The aim was to evaluate the incidence, treatment, surgery rate, and anthropometry at diagnosis of children with inflammatory bowel disease (IBD). METHODS: Patients diagnosed between January 1, 2007 to December 31, 2009 in Eastern Denmark, Funen, and Aarhus were included from a background population of 668,056 children <15 years of age. For evaluation of incidence, treatment, and surgery rate, a subcohort from Eastern Denmark was extracted for comparison with a previously published population-based cohort from the same geographical area (1998-2006). RESULTS: In all, 130 children with IBD: 65 with Crohn's disease (CD), 62 with ulcerative colitis (UC), and three with IBD unclassified (IBDU) were included. The mean incidence rates per 10(6) in 2007-2009 were: IBD: 6.4 (95% confidence interval [CI]: 5.4-7.7), CD: 3.2 (2.5-4.1), UC: 3.1 (2.4-4.0) and IBDU: 0.2 (0.05-0.5). Comparing the two cohorts from Eastern Denmark we found higher incidence rates for IBD (5.0 and 7.2 in 1998-2000 and 2007-2009, respectively, P = 0.02) and CD (2.3 versus 3.3, P = 0.04). Furthermore, we found a significant decrease in surgery rates (15.8/100 person-years versus 4.2, P = 0.02) and an increase in the rate of initiating immunomodulators (IM) within the first year (29.0/100 person-years versus 69.2, P < 0.001). IM use was associated with a trend towards a decreased surgery risk (relative risk [RR] 0.38; 0.15-1.0). Children with CD had poor nutritional status at diagnosis compared with the general pediatric population. CONCLUSIONS: Over the past 12 years we found an increase in the incidence of IBD in children, an increasing use of IM, and decreasing 1-year surgery rates. CD patients had poor nutritional status.},

   abstract = {The incidence of inflammatory bowel diseases has increased during recent decades. Within the colon, the families of mucins (MUC) and trefoil factors (TFF) facilitate mucosal protection. Probiotic administration influences the intestinal MUC layer. Additionally, food components may affect gut microflora or have direct effects on the MUC barrier. Our objective was to determine whether diet and/or Lactobacillus rhamnosus GG (LGG) would mediate dextran sodium sulfate (DSS)-induced colitis by altering expression of the MUC and TFF genes. C57BL/6 mice were fed diets containing 20% (wt:wt) casein, soy, or whey proteins with or without LGG for 12 d. Seven days after starting LGG diets, the mice were given 2% DSS in drinking water for 4 d. Two additional casein groups with or without LGG were given tap water, for a total of 8 groups. One day after the DSS treatment, the mice were killed and the colon and cecum tissues and cecum contents were collected and analyzed by qRT-PCR. Whey protein significantly increased cecal LGG content compared with the other diets. In the casein diet groups, MUC1 and TFF-3 expression in colon was significantly induced by DSS independent of LGG. Compared with other DSS-treated groups, soy protein decreased MUC-1 and TFF-3 in the colon. Similarly, soy protein decreased the impact of DSS on inflammatory scores, TNFalpha gene expression, and colon shortening. There was no overall effect of LGG on these measurements. In conclusion, soy protein suppressed the DSS-induced inflammatory stimulation of MUC, TFF, and TNFalpha gene expression independently of LGG.},

   abstract = {Increased levels of homocysteine are found systemically and in intestinal mucosa of patients with inflammatory bowel disease, and, specifically, in ulcerative colitis (UC). However, there are controversial reports regarding the factors contributing to increased levels of homocysteine in UC. Furthermore, little information is available regarding the relationship between hyperhomocysteinemia (HHcy), vitamin status, and genetic polymorphisms of homocysteine-related enzymes in these patients. This study examined four functional polymorphisms linked to homocysteine metabolism (MTHFR C677T and A1298C, MTR A2756G and MTRR A66G), and evaluated plasma levels of homocysteine, folate, and vitamin B(12) in 310 consecutive patients with UC and 936 age- and sex-matched healthy controls from southeast China. The variant allele and genotypic frequencies in MTHFR A1298C, MTR A2756G and MTRR A66G genes were significantly higher in patients with UC compared to healthy controls. Further, HHcy and low levels of folate and vitamin B(12) were more frequent in patients with UC. The MTR 2756G allele, extent of the disease, and gender were the independent determinants of HHcy in these patients. These findings suggest that genetic and nutritional factors have a synergetic effect on HHcy in patients with UC. In conclusion, our data highlight a prevention strategy for moderation of HHcy and supplementation with folate and vitamine B(12) in patients with UC from Southeast China.},

   abstract = {The gastrointestinal epithelium transports solutes and water between lumen and blood and at the same time forms a barrier between these compartments. This highly selective and regulated barrier permits ions, water, and nutrients to be absorbed, but normally restricts the passage of harmful molecules, bacteria, viruses and other pathogens. During inflammation, the intestinal barrier can be disrupted, indicated by a decrease in transcellular electrical resistance and an increase in paracellular permeability for tracers of different size. Such inflammatory processes are accompanied by increased oxidative stress, which in turn can impair the epithelial barrier. In this review, we discuss the role of inflammatory oxidative stress on barrier function with special attention on the epithelial tight junctions. Diseases discussed causing barrier changes include the inflammatory bowel diseases Crohn's disease, ulcerative colitis, and microscopic colitis, the autoimmune disorder celiac disease, and gastrointestinal infections. In addition, the main cytokines responsible for these effects and their role during oxidative stress and intestinal inflammation will be discussed, as well as therapeutic approaches and their mode of action.},

   abstract = {INTRODUCTION: Mounting evidence suggests an important role for the intestinal microbiota in the chronic mucosal inflammation that occurs in inflammatory bowel disease (IBD), and novel molecular approaches have further identified a dysbiosis in these patients. Several mechanisms of action of probiotic products that may interfere with possible aetiological factors in IBD have been postulated. OBJECTIVE: Our objective was to discuss the rationale for probiotics in IBD and to systematically review clinical intervention studies with probiotics in the management of IBD in adults. METHODS: A systematic search was performed in PubMed up to 1 October 2011, using defined keywords. Only full-text papers in the English language addressing clinical outcomes in adult patients were included. The 41 eligible studies were categorized on disease type (ulcerative colitis [UC] with/without an ileo-anal pouch and Crohn's disease [CD]) and disease activity. Pooled odds ratios were only calculated per probiotic for a specific patient group when more than one randomized controlled trial was available. RESULTS: Well designed randomized controlled trials supporting the application of probiotics in the management of IBD are still limited. Meta-analyses could only be performed for a limited number of studies revealing overall risk ratios of 2.70 (95% CI 0.47, 15.33) for inducing remission in active UC with Bifido-fermented milk versus placebo or no additive treatment (n = 2); 1.88 (95% CI 0.96, 3.67) for inducing remission in active UC with VSL#3 versus placebo (n = 2); 1.08 (95% CI 0.86, 1.37) for preventing relapses in inactive UC with Escherichia coli Nissle 1917 versus standard treatment (n = 3); 0.17 (95% CI 0.09, 0.33) for preventing relapses in inactive UC/ileo-anal pouch anastomosis (IPAA) patients with VSL#3 versus placebo; 1.21 (95% CI 0.57, 2.57) for preventing endoscopic recurrences in inactive CD with Lactobacillus rhamnosus GG versus placebo (n = 2); and 0.93 (95% CI 0.63, 1.38) for preventing endoscopic recurrences in inactive CD with Lactobacillus johnsonii versus placebo (n = 2). CONCLUSION: Further well designed studies based on intention-to-treat analyses by several independent research groups are still warranted to support the promising results for E. coli Nissle in inactive UC and the multispecies product VSL#3 in active UC and inactive pouch patients. So far, no evidence is available to support the use of probiotics in CD. Future studies should focus on specific disease subtypes and disease location. Further insight into the aetiology of IBD and the mechanisms of probiotic strains will aid in selecting probiotic strains for specific disease entities and disease locations.},

   abstract = {OBJECTIVE: Ulcerative colitis is a chronic recurrent disease characterized by acute inflammation of the colonic mucosa. In Japan, a dietary supplementation product enriched with glutamine, dietary fiber, and oligosaccharide (GFO) is widely applied for enteral nutrition support. These three components have been suggested to improve intestinal health. In this study, we investigated whether GFO has suppressive effects on mucosal damage in ulcerative colitis in an experimental mouse model. METHODS: C57BL/6 mice received 2.5% dextran sulfate sodium in drinking water for 5 d to induce colitis. Then, they were given 0.25 mL of GFO or a 20% glucose solution twice daily for 10 d. Another set of mice receiving unaltered drinking water was used as the normal control group. RESULTS: The body weight loss and disease activity index were significantly lower in the GFO-treated mice compared with the glucose-treated mice (P < 0.05). The decrease in colon length induced by dextran sulfate sodium was significantly alleviated in GFO-treated mice compared with glucose-treated mice (P < 0.01). In addition, the histologic findings showed that intestinal inflammation was significantly attenuated in mice treated with GFO. Furthermore, treatment with GFO significantly inhibited the dextran sulfate sodium-induced increase in the mRNA expression of interleukin-1beta. CONCLUSION: These results suggest that GFO has potential therapeutic value as an adjunct therapy for ulcerative colitis.},

   abstract = {BACKGROUND AND AIMS: The U.S. population is aging and the burden of geriatric inflammatory bowel disease (IBD) patients has increased. Systematic data describing phenotypic presentation, treatment regimens, outcomes and comorbidities in elderly IBD patients is limited. We performed a retrospective observational study of IBD patients age >/=65 followed in a 20-hospital system to determine patterns of phenotypic presentation, treatment, polypharmacy, nutritional status and comorbidity. METHODS: Data were extracted from electronic medical record based on ICD-9 coding/indexed terms on Crohn's disease (CD) and ulcerative colitis (UC) patients. RESULTS: A total of 393 geriatric IBD patients were identified (49.1% males; 50.9% females; 61.8% UC; 38.2% CD; 73.4 +/- 6.6 years old). Younger age at diagnosis of CD (</=64) was associated with greater prevalence of small bowel surgeries (63.6%) compared with those diagnosed after age >/=65 (20.9%) (p < 0.005). Fistulizing/penetrating disease was frequent in patients diagnosed with CD at a younger age (43.6% compared to 7%) (p < 0.005). IBD maintenance treatment included: 44% 5-ASA agents; 31.6% maintenance prednisone (defined as >/=6 months treatment duration); 4.8% steroid suppositories; 5.6% 6MP/azathioprine; 1.3% methotrexate; 1.3% adalimumab; 1.3% infliximab; 9.4% loperamide/diphenoxylate/atropine; 0.5% had no IBD medications. Longer duration of CD disease correlated with vitamin B12, vitamin D and iron deficiency. CONCLUSION: Geriatric patients diagnosed with CD earlier in life had greater small bowel involvement compared with new onset geriatric CD. There is low utilization of immunomodulator and biologic agents in geriatric IBD patients. Duration of CD correlates with nutrient deficiency. Prospective studies are warranted in this respect.},

   abstract = {BACKGROUND: Fecal bacteriotherapy (FB) has been proposed as a safe and effective alternative treatment for a number of gastrointestinal conditions including ulcerative colitis (UC). We performed a qualitative study to explore the attitudes and concerns of adult patients and parents of children with UC regarding FB as a potential treatment. METHODS: We conducted six focus groups for adult patients with UC and parents of children with UC or indeterminate colitis. Participants were asked about their perceptions of and interest in FB as a treatment for UC. Sessions were recorded, transcribed, and reviewed to identify domains, themes, and major concepts. RESULTS: The focus groups included 15 adult patients and seven parents of children with colitis. We identified five major domains pertaining to FB: impressions of treatment, benefits, risks, potential mechanisms, and social concerns. All but one participant expressed interest in FB and several wished it were already available. Participants compared FB to probiotics, felt it was "natural," easier than current therapies, and with donor screening would be safe. Although initial distaste and the "yuck factor" were uniformly mentioned, these concerns were outweighed by perceived benefits. CONCLUSION: This is the first study to examine important ethical and social issues surrounding FB as a treatment for UC. Given adequate supporting research, donor selection, and screening, adult patients and parents of children with UC will consider FB and are eager for it to become available. These findings have important implications for future microbiome-based treatments.},

However, no data are available on their action on the intestinal epithelium, being exposed to the highest concentrations of carotenoids in the human body, and where they could act preventively on intestinal inflammatory diseases such as Crohn's disease and ulcerative colitis. The objective of the present study was to investigate whether lycopene and beta-carotene in micelles (M), at concentrations that could be reached via the diet (10-25 mug/ml) could aid in the reduction of TNF-alpha plus IL-1beta-induced inflammation of Caco-2 human epithelial cells. The impact on biomarkers of inflammation, including IL-8, NO and cyclo-oxygenase-2 (through PGE-2alpha), and the NF-kappaB and mitogen-activated protein kinase (MAPK) pathways of intracellular signalling cascades were evaluated compared with controls (empty M). Furthermore, proteomic analyses were conducted from total cellular protein extracts. The results revealed that isolated carotenoids had no statistical significant anti-inflammatory effect on the biomarkers observed, or on the regulation of NF-kappaB and MAPK. Nevertheless, analyses of the proteome suggested that fifteen proteins were significantly (P < 0.05, expression ratio >1.3) differentially regulated following beta-carotene exposure, participating mostly in metabolic activities including antioxidant mechanisms, such as glutathione S-transferase A1. Only one protein was differentially regulated by lycopene (profilin-1). To our knowledge, this is the first attempt to investigate pathways involved in the action of carotenoids on the intestinal epithelium.},

   abstract = {The gut microbiota, the intestinal mucosa and the host immune system are among the large biological networks involved in the development of inflammatory bowel disease (IBD), which includes Crohn disease (CD) and ulcerative colitis (UC). Host genetics and environmental factors can significantly modulate the interactive relationships among these biological systems and influence predilection toward IBD. High monozygotic twin discordance rates and the rapid rise in the prevalence of IBD indicate that environmental influences may be as important or even more important in their pathogenesis than genetic susceptibility. However, the nature and timing of environmental factors critical for inducing IBD remain largely unknown. The molecular mechanisms and the key biological component(s) that may be affected by such factors are also in question. Epigenetic changes, such as DNA methylation (the methylation of cytosines followed by a guanine in CpG dinucleotides) can be modified by environmental influences during finite developmental periods and have been implicated in the pathogenesis of IBD. Mucosal DNA methylation can also react to changes in the commensal microbiota, underscoring the intercalating relationships among the large biological systems involved in gastrointestinal disorders. Therefore, transient environmental influences during specific periods of development may induce critical change(s) in an isolated or concomitant fashion within the intestinal biomic networks and lead to increased susceptibility to IBD. The present review focuses on the emerging paradigm shift considering IBD to originate from critical environmental effects during pre- and postnatal development.},

   abstract = {OBJECTIVES: Few clinical predictors are associated with definitive proctocolectomy in children with ulcerative colitis (UC). The purpose of the present study was to identify clinical predictors associated with surgery in children with UC using a disease-specific database. METHODS: Children diagnosed with UC at age <18 years were identified using the Pediatric Inflammatory Bowel Disease Consortium (PediIBDC) database. Demographic and clinical variables from January 1999 to November 2003 were extracted alongside incidence and surgical staging. RESULTS: Review of the PediIBDC database identified 406 children with UC. Approximately half were girls (51%) with an average age at diagnosis of 10.6 +/- 4.4 years in both boys and girls. Average follow-up was 6.8 (+/-4.0) years. Of the 57 (14%) who underwent surgery, median time to surgery was 3.8 (interquartile range 4.9) years after initial diagnosis. Children presenting with weight loss (hazard ratio [HR] 2.55, 99% confidence interval [CI] 1.21-5.35) or serum albumin <3.5 g/dL (HR 6.05, 99% CI 2.15-17.04) at time of diagnosis and children with a first-degree relative with UC (HR 1.81, 99% CI 1.25-2.61) required earlier surgical intervention. Furthermore, children treated with cyclosporine (HR 6.11, 99% CI 3.90-9.57) or tacrolimus (HR 3.66, 99% CI 1.60-8.39) also required earlier surgical management. Other symptoms, laboratory tests, and medical therapies were not predictive for need of surgery. CONCLUSION: Children with UC presenting with hypoalbuminemia, weight loss, a family history of UC, and those treated with calcineurin inhibitors frequently require restorative proctocolectomy for definitive treatment. Early identification and recognition of these factors should be used to shape treatment goals and initiate multidisciplinary care at the time of diagnosis.},

   abstract = {BACKGROUND: Significance of pancreatic autoantibodies determined by using exocrine pancreas (PAB) and antibodies against recombinant pancreas antigen (rPAB), as well as the importance of autoantibodies against goblet cells (GAB), is not known in pediatric patients with inflammatory bowel disease (IBD). Our aim was to determine the complex analysis of PAB, rPAB, GAB, antibodies against Saccharomyces cerevisiae, and perinuclear components of neutrophils in pediatric patients with IBD. Moreover, association with NOD2/CARD15 and disease phenotype was determined. METHODS: A total of 152 pediatric patients (median age 13.9 years) with IBD (103 patients with Crohn disease [CD] and 49 patients with ulcerative colitis [UC]) and 104 controls were included. Serum autoantibodies were determined by indirect immunofluorescence assay. NOD2/CARD15 variants were tested by polymerase chain reaction/restriction fragment length polymorphism. RESULTS: The presence of PAB and rPAB was significantly higher in CD (34% and 35.9%) and in UC (20.4% and 24.5%) compared with pediatric control cohort (0% and 0%, P<0.0001). In addition, GAB positivity was significantly increased in patients with UC in comparison with CD and controls, respectively (UC, 12.2%; CD, 1.9%; controls, 1.9%; P=0.02). Specificity of PAB and rPAB was 100%; however, sensitivity was low. The combination of PAB and/or antibodies against Saccharomyces cerevisiae/perinuclear components of neutrophils improved the sensitivity of serological markers in CD (87.4%) and in UC (79.6%); specificities were 89.3% and 93.2%, respectively. Pancreatic autoantibodies (PAB, rPAB) and GAB were not related to clinical presentation, medical therapy, or need for surgery in CD or in UC. CONCLUSIONS: Pancreatic autoantibodies and GAB were specific for IBD, but the sensitivity was limited as well because there was lack of correlation with clinical phenotype. Combinations of these antibodies have shown increased sensitivity; therefore, it may be recommended in the diagnostic procedure of IBD.},

   abstract = {BACKGROUND: Colon specific drug delivery can significantly improve the efficacy of local treatments of inflammatory bowel diseases. Film coatings containing the starch derivative Nutriose have recently been reported to minimize 5-ASA release in media simulating the upper gastro intestinal tract (GIT), while releasing the drug in a time-controlled manner upon contact with feces from Crohn's Disease and Ulcerative Colitis patients. It was the aim of this study to prepare Nutriose-containing matrix pellets and mini tablets in order to avoid a film coating step. METHODS: Highly dosed matrix pellets were prepared by extrusion-spheronization, highly dosed mini tablets by compression. Various types of lipids were added and drug release measured in 0.1 N HCl and phosphate buffer pH 6.8, optionally containing pepsin and pancreatin. RESULTS: The type of added lipid and the preparation technique, in particular the curing conditions, significantly affected the resulting drug release kinetics. Glyceryl palmitostearate containing pellets and mini tablets showed the most promising results upon appropriate curing, minimizing premature drug release in media simulating the upper GIT. CONCLUSION: The proposed novel multiparticulates do not require a film coating step and show an interesting potential for site-specific drug delivery to the colon of inflammatory bowel disease patients.},

   abstract = {UNLABELLED: Anemia is one of most frequent complication of ulcerative colitis. It affects patients in the exacerbation of the disease as well as in the remission. It may be caused by the loss of the blood, the disturbances of intestinal absorption or deficient diet. The aim of the study was to estimate the rate of anemia in children with ulcerative colitis during first hospitalization. MATERIAL AND METHODS: The study comprised 36 children aged 2.5 to 18 years, 23 girls and 13 boys in whom ulcerative colitis was diagnosed based on the Porto criteria. Anemia in children was assessed depending on the age, period between first symptoms and diagnosis of the disease and on the activity of the disease according to PUCAI scale. RESULTS: Anemia was diagnosed in 72.2% of the children. Hemoglobin concentration ranged from 6.3 to 12.4 g/dl, average 10.05 g/dl depending on age. Activity of the disease according to PUCAI scale amounted to 5 to 80 points, average 51.9 points. Time from first symptoms to the diagnosis of the disease extended from one week to 12 months, average 3.6 months. In children without anemia the average concentration of hemoglobin was 13.2 g/dl, the activity of the disease 33.5 points and average time before diagnosis - 1.7 months. CONCLUSIONS: Anemia is a frequent symptom of ulcerative colitis in children. The presence of anemia depends on the disease activity and on the time between first symptoms and diagnosis of the disease. There is a necessity of iron supplementation in children with anemia despite effective anti-inflammatory treatment.},

PATIENTS AND METHODS: DNA was extracted from formalin-fixed paraffin-embedded colonic and ileal biopsies from patients with CD (n = 22) or UC (n = 20), and from controls without IBD (n = 21). IS900 nested polymerase chain reaction was performed in triplicate to determine the presence of MAP-specific DNA. RESULTS: In mucosal biopsies from terminal ileum, IS900 amplicons were detected in 1 of 19 (5.2%) control subjects, 1 of 20 (5%) patients with UC, and 7 of 20 (35%) patients with CD (P < 0.05 vs controls, odds ratio 9.6). In colonic biopsies, IS900 amplicons were detected in 0 of 19 control subjects, 1 of 19 (5.2%) patients with UC, and 5 of 19 (26.3%) patients with CD (P < 0.05 vs controls, odds ratio 14.8). In patients with CD, there was no correlation between disease activity and the presence of IS900. CONCLUSIONS: Our technique enabled sensitive and specific detection of MAP DNA in archival endoscopic biopsy specimens. Although MAP-specific DNA can be detected in about 5% of intestinal biopsies from children with UC or controls without IBD, its presence was significantly associated with pediatric granulomatous CD, being particularly prevalent in ileal tissue. This easily defined clinical subset of patients may be useful for additional studies to determine the role of MAP in CD.},

METHODS: We performed a cross-sectional analysis of children with Crohn disease (CD) and ulcerative colitis (UC) using data from the ImproveCareNow Network collected between May 2007 and May 2010. Clinical remission, disease severity, body mass index (BMI) z scores, normal height velocity, and medication use were analyzed by sex and age. RESULTS: One thousand four hundred nine patients were included (993 had CD and 416 had UC). No significant sex differences were found in disease severity, BMI, height velocity, or use of medications. Further analysis of combination therapy with infliximab + 6-mercaptopurine/azathioprine and infliximab + methotrexate also did not reveal any differences. No sex differences were found after mediation use was stratified by age (those younger than 13 years and those 13 years old or older). CONCLUSIONS: In this sample of CD and UC pediatric patients, no significant sex differences were found in disease severity, BMI, height velocity, or medication use. Our data do not support the use of sex as a major factor in patient risk stratification for children with IBD. In addition, despite concerns for sex-specific complications of some medications, our analysis did not suggest any sex differences in medication use.},

   abstract = {OBJECTIVES: Currently validated ulcerative colitis (UC) activity measures are physician based, but incorporate patient reports of symptoms. We aimed to assess whether patient-completed Pediatric UC Activity Index (PUCAI) scores are comparable to those of physician scores. PATIENTS AND METHODS: We performed a single-center prospective study to assess agreement between patient- and physician-completed PUCAI scores. Seventy patients with UC (ages 4-29) representative of all of the disease activity categories (inactive, mild, moderate, and severe) in the currently published physician-completed scoring system were recruited. Agreement was analyzed for PUCAI scores both as continuous and categorical measures. To ascertain validity, we compared both patient- and physician-completed PUCAI scores with the physician global assessment and serum inflammatory markers. RESULTS: Patient- and physician-completed PUCAI summary scores were identical 49% of the time, were different but within the minimal clinically important difference (MCID) of 20 points 48% of the time, and were at or beyond the MCID only 3% of the time. In general, patients reported higher mean disease severity on their questionnaires than did their physicians, with a mean difference in PUCAI scores of 3 +/- 8 (95% confidence interval 2%-5%). A categorical comparison of the 2 sets of questionnaires using the disease activity groups demonstrated perfect agreement for 60 (86%) pairs (kappa coefficient 0.78; 95% confidence interval 0.65%-0.90%). Both patient- and physician-completed PUCAI scores also correlated well with the physician global assessment and serum inflammatory markers. CONCLUSIONS: Our data indicate strong agreement between PUCAI scores obtained directly from patients and those completed by physicians. Hence, a patient-based PUCAI could complement existing instruments in both clinical and research settings.},

   abstract = {Tributyrin (TBT) is a TAG composed of three butyric acids that has beneficial effects on ulcerative colitis due to its trophic, anti-inflammatory, pro-apoptotic and anti-carcinogenic properties. The goal of the present study was to evaluate the efficacy and mechanisms of action of TBT supplementation in the prevention of mucosal damage in experimental colitis. Mice received either a control diet or a TBT-supplemented diet for 15 d. Colitis was induced by dextran sodium sulphate administration during the last 7 d. Mucosal damage and the activation of immune cells and cytokines were determined by histological score, flow cytometry and ELISA. Leucocyte rolling and adhesion were assessed by intravital microscopy. Oxidative stress was determined by monitoring hydroperoxide concentration and evaluating superoxide dismutase (SOD) and catalase activities. Intestinal permeability was analysed using diethylenetriaminepentaacetate acid (99mTcDTPA). Compared with the colitis group, the animals in the colitis+TBT group had reduced mucosal damage and neutrophil and eosinophil mucosal infiltration, which were associated with a higher percentage of regulatory T cells (Treg) and higher levels of transforming growth factor beta and IL-10 in the lamina propria. The level of in vivo leucocyte adhesion in the colon microvasculature was reduced after TBT supplementation. A lower level of hydroperoxide and higher levels of SOD and catalase activities were associated with TBT supplementation. TBT-supplemented mice showed reduced intestinal permeability to the levels intermediate between the control and colitis groups. In conclusion, the present results show that TBT has positive effects on colonic restructuring in experimental colitis. Additionally, TBT supplementation changes the immune response by controlling inflammation and regulating the expression of anti-inflammatory cytokines and Treg.},

   abstract = {The incidence of pediatric inflammatory bowel disease (IBD) continues to rise in most countries. Approximately 20-25% of IBD patients present before the age of 20, and their management is associated with many unique challenges. These challenges stem both from the inherent differences between children and adults, and from the differences in the nature and course of the disease. Children with IBD are more likely than adults to present with extensive disease both in Crohn's disease (CD) and ulcerative colitis (UC). Diagnosis requires a high index of suspicion, as children may present with less typical signs such as poor growth and delayed puberty. In the very young patients with inflammatory bowel disease, the pediatric clinician must consider a broader range of immunological and allergic disorders. Optimal management requires recognition of pediatric patterns of presentation, efficacy and adverse-effect profiles, and understanding monitoring aspects unique to pediatrics. These aspects include pediatric disease-related psychological issues, adherence to therapy and transition to adult care. Inadequate attention to growth, puberty or bone health in childhood can result in long-term consequences, such as impaired adult height and increased risk of fractures. Management of pediatric IBD and prevention of adverse long-term consequences relies on a variety of therapies well-known to the adult practitioner, along with therapies that are not widespread in adults, most notably exclusive enteral nutrition (EEN). The latter is as effective as corticosteroids in achieving clinical remission in children, while achieving better results than corticosteroids with regard to mucosal healing and growth. This review discusses the broad variety of issues that form the basis for management of pediatric IBD.},

   abstract = {Transforming growth factor beta1 (TGF-beta1) is a cytokine affecting cell proliferation and development, which also has an immunomodulatory activity. Correlations between polymorphisms of the TGF-beta1 gene and clinical parameters of inflammatory bowel disease (IBD) were reported previously in adults. Here, we tested whether such correlations occur in pediatric patients suffering from IBD. One hundred and four pediatric IBD patients were involved in this study. Among them, 36 were diagnosed with Crohn's Disease (CD) and 68 were diagnosed with ulcerative colitis (UC). The control group consisted of 103 children, in which IBD was excluded. TGF-beta1 levels were determined in plasma and intestinal mucosa samples. The presence of the TGF beta1 protein and the amount of TGF beta1 mRNA were estimated in intestinal mucosa by immunohistochemistry and reverse transcription Real-Time PCR, respectively. Four common polymorphisms of the TGF-beta1 gene were investigated: -800G/A, -509C/T, 869T/C and 915G/C. No significant correlation between TGF-beta1 genotypes and (i) TGF-beta1 levels in plasma and tissue samples, (ii) TGF-beta1 gene expression efficiency in intestinal mucosa, (iii) IBD clinical parameters and (iv) inflammatory activity could be detected in children suffering from IBD. We conclude that, contrary to previous suggestions, the four common polymorphisms of the TGF-beta1 gene do not influence the susceptibility to or clinical parameters of IBD in the tested population of children.},

   abstract = {PURPOSE: Transforming growth factor beta1 (TGF-beta1) plays a role in cell proliferation and differentiation, and it can modulate immune response. In this work, we asked whether levels of either TGF-beta1 or mRNA of the corresponding gene in plasma or tissue can be useful in diagnosing and/or monitoring of the clinical course of inflammatory bowel diseases (IBD). METHODS: The study group consisted of 104 pediatric patients with IBD: 36 with Crohn's disease (CD) and 68 with ulcerative colitis (UC); 42 children represented the control group. TGF-beta1 levels in plasma and intestinal mucosa were estimated by ELISA and immunohistochemistry (IHC), respectively. Levels of TGF-beta1 mRNA were determined by reverse transcription and real-time PCR. RESULTS: In patients with IBD, and in subgroups with CD and UC, no significant differences in the TGF-beta1 level in plasma and tissue were found relative to the control group. These variables were not dependent on the stage of the disease, its activity or severity of endoscopic and histopathological findings. TGF-beta1 mRNA levels were significantly higher in tissue samples withdrawn during the relapse of the disease than in those taken during the remission or in the control group. However, no correlation between TGF-beta1 plasma levels and TGF-beta1 mRNA amount in the intestinal mucosa was observed. CONCLUSIONS: The TGF-beta1 mRNA level, but not the amount of the gene product, was significantly increased in the pathologically changed tissue during the relapse of IBD. We suggest that this parameter might be considered as a potential prognostic value when assessing IBD in children.},

   abstract = {Nutritional assessment and dietary advice are fundamental to inflammatory bowel disease (IBD) patient management and all patients should have access to a dietitian. Newly diagnosed patients often think that their pre-illness diet has contributed to the development of their IBD. However, epidemiological evidence to support diet as a risk factor is lacking. How the diet contributes to the gastrointestinal microbiota is interesting, although the role is not yet clearly defined. Nutritional problems in IBD are common. Malnutrition occurs in up to 85% of patients and weight loss affects up to 80% of patients with Crohn's disease and 18-62% of patients with ulcerative colitis. Nutritional deficiencies are prevalent, particularly in relation to anaemia and osteoporosis. Intestinal strictures can be problematic in Crohn's disease and limiting fibrous foods that may cause a mechanical obstruction in the gastrointestinal tract is helpful. Patients often explore dietary exclusion to alleviate symptoms but such changes may be self-directed or inappropriately advised and can lead to further nutritional deficiencies. Some patients experience concurrent functional symptoms (e.g. abdominal bloating, abdominal pain, flatulence and diarrhoea) that can significantly affect quality of life. Recently, a group of poorly absorbed carbohydrates that occur naturally in the diet called fermentable oligo-, di-, mono-saccharides and polyols have been associated with functional symptoms by intestinal bacterial fermentation leading to rapid gas production, and an osmotic effect increasing fluid delivery to the colon. Emerging evidence indicates that a diet low in fermentable oligo-, di-, mono-saccharides and polyols can alleviate functional symptoms in IBD.},

   abstract = {Inflammatory bowel disease (IBD) is a risk factor for the development of colon cancer. Environmental factors including diet and the microflora influence disease outcome. Folate and homocysteine have been associated with IBD-mediated colon cancer but their roles remain unclear. We used a model of chemically induced ulcerative colitis (dextran sodium sulphate (DSS)) with or without the colon carcinogen azoxymethane (AOM) to determine the impact of dietary folic acid (FA) on colonic microflora and the development of colon tumours. Male mice (n 15 per group) were fed a FA-deficient (0 mg/kg), control (2 mg/kg) or FA-supplemented (8 mg/kg) diet for 12 weeks. Folate status was dependent on the diet (P< 0.001) and colitis-induced treatment (P= 0.04) such that mice with colitis had lower circulating folate. FA had a minimal effect on tumour initiation, growth and progression, although FA-containing diets tended to be associated with a higher tumour prevalence in DSS-treated mice (7-20 v. 0%, P= 0.08) and the development of more tumours in the distal colon of AOM-treated mice (13-83% increase, P= 0.09). Folate deficiency was associated with hyperhomocysteinaemia (P< 0.001) but homocysteine negatively correlated with tumour number (r - 0.58, P= 0.02) and load (r - 0.57, P= 0.02). FA had no effect on the intestinal microflora. The present data indicate that FA intake has no or little effect on IBD or IBD-mediated colon cancer in this model and that hyperhomocysteinaemia is a biomarker of dietary status and malabsorption rather than a cause of IBD-mediated colon cancer.},

At present, there is little evidence for the benefit of currently used probiotic microbes in Crohn's disease or associated conditions affecting extra-intestinal organs. However, clinical practice guidelines are now including a probiotic as an option for recurrent and relapsing antibiotic sensitive pouchitis and the use of probiotics in mild ulcerative colitis is provocative and suggests potential for benefit in select patients but concerns remain about proof from trials.},

We aimed to (1) compare the HRQL of proctocolectomy patients with those treated with conventional therapy and (2) determine factors that influence HRQL in UC patients < 18 years. METHODS: Chart review was done on patients diagnosed with pediatric onset of UC (<18) at the Stollery Children's Hospital. HRQL was evaluated in 88 patients using disease- and age-specific questionnaires; IMPACT III (<18) and Inflammatory Bowel Disease Questionnaire (IBDQ; >/=18). Demographics, disease characteristics, disease index (PUCAI), HRQL EuroQoL visual analog scale (EQ-5D/VAS) were collected and analyzed from all patients. RESULTS: Sixty-five respondents completed the IMPACT III (74 %) and 23 patients completed the IBDQ (26 %). Thirty-three surgical patients (34 %) responded (mean IMPACT III score = 148.9 +/- 12.7; mean IBDQ = 171.2 +/- 40.1). There was no significant difference in IMPACT III scores of surgical patients vs. medically treated patients (148.9 +/- 12.7 vs. 140.6 +/- 19.4, p = 0.09). Patients with high IMPACT scores (>143 points) were most likely to be in remission (p = 0.05), they were less likely to be on medication (p < 0.05), have parent/guardian with postsecondary education (p = 0.01), did not suffer from fatigue (p < 0.01), and did not report depression (p < 0.02). The IMPACT correlation with PUCAI (adjusted r (2) = 0.33) and EQ-VAS (adjusted r (2) = 0.45) was strong. CONCLUSIONS: Surgical patients reported to have a HRQL comparable to or better than the nonsurgical patients. Depression, fatigue, parent/guardian education, and drugs influence HRQL.},

   abstract = {PURPOSE OF REVIEW: There is accumulating evidence on the importance of microbes in the development and maintenance of both the intestinal and immune systems. This review focuses on the current findings on the role of gastrointestinal pathogens in the cause of chronic inflammatory bowel disease. RECENT FINDINGS: A number of intestinal pathogens including Mycobacterium avium subspecies paratuberculosis, adherent-invasive Escherichia coli, and Campylobacter species are associated at fairly high prevalence with Crohn's disease, while two recent studies found a low prevalence for cytomegalovirus. In a prospective study, M. avium subspecies paratuberculosis detection in early Crohn's disease was low and comparable to controls, while much higher in an established inflammatory bowel disease cohort. In the pediatric setting, a high prevalence of Clostridium difficile was seen in both active and inactive Crohn's disease and ulcerative colitis patients. Some studies have speculated that Salmonella or Campylobacter infection may increase the risk of inflammatory bowel disease on long-term follow-up, but detection bias was found to obscure the risk. Recent studies in mouse models have demonstrated that a combination of factors, including viral pathogens, genetic susceptibility, and commensal microflora, can lead to intestinal pathology. SUMMARY: No evidence for causation of inflammatory bowel disease by a single agent has been found, whereas a number of microbes have been strongly associated with the presence of disease. The majority of recent studies support a role for the ability of intestinal pathogens to promote chronic inflammation in individuals with genetic susceptibility and/or other environmental factors which remain to be identified. These factors may include subsets of commensal microflora.},

   abstract = {INTRODUCTION: Inflammatory bowel diseases (IBD) have classically included two entities: Crohn's disease (CD) and ulcerative colitis (UC). The correct differentiation between these two diseases has important implications. The term inflammatory bowel disease unclassified (IBDu) describes inflammatory changes of the colon that cannot be classified as ulcerative colitis or Crohn's disease. This situation has been described in 20-30% of paediatric IBD at diagnosis. In order to reach a definitive diagnosis of suspicion of inflammatory bowel disease in children, the ESPGHAN (European Society for Paediatric Gastroenterology, Hepatology and Nutrition) established the Porto criteria (PC) in July 2005. The recommendations include: 1) total colonoscopy with ileal intubation, 2) upper endoscopy, 3) multiple biopsies and 4) complete small bowel exploration. AIM: To evaluate the diagnostic procedures used in our IBD patients regarding the PC. PATIENTS AND METHODS: Retrospective review of the data of our IBD patients diagnosed in the last ten years (1999-2008) in a Spanish tertiary hospital, differentiating two periods: before and after the publication of the PC. RESULTS: A total of 108 IBD patients had been diagnosed (51 UC, 52 CD, 5 IBDu), 43 girls (39.81%), 65 boys (60.18%). According to the Montreal classification: 1) UC, 40 (78%) extensive colitis, 5 left-sided colitis (9.8%), 6 proctitis (11%), 2) CD: 44 ileo-colonic (84%), 13 ileal, 7 colonic. Median age at diagnosis: 13 years 1 month (p25-p75: 10 years 3 months- 14 years 9months). The Porto criteria were followed in 49% of the cases (33.3% before its publication, 64.8% after, P=.001). Upper endoscopy was performed in 62 patients (58%): 38.9% versus 72.2%, P<.001. Upper involvement was found in 51% of our CD patients. Total colonoscopy with ileoscopy was achieved in 85.2% of the cases. The mean number of ileo-colonic segments biopsied was 6.6 (7 different segments). Granulomas at biopsies were present in 38% of our CD patients. Up to 38% of the CD patients had microscopic inflammation in endoscopically normal appearing segments. During the follow-up, initial diagnosis among the IBDu patients, was changed to CD in 1, to UC in 2 and the other 3 remained with the same diagnosis. We did not observe other changes in diagnosis in the remaining 103 patients (median follow-up: 4y 8mo). Thirty patients were discharged when becoming adults. CONCLUSIONS: Our clinical practice in IBD diagnosis has changed after the PC. Upper endoscopy is a useful tool to find upper involvement in CD. Total colonoscopy with ileoscopy and performance of multiple biopsies are essential to determine extension of the inflammatory changes. We have not observed changes in the final diagnosis in our CD and UC patients after a median follow-up of 4 years.},

   abstract = {BACKGROUND Inflammatory bowel diseases (IBD), which include ulcerative colitis (UC) and Crohn's disease (CD), are debilitating and chronic disorders with unpredictable courses and complicated treatment measures. Therefore, an efficient treatment protocol seems necessary as therapeutic prophylaxis for these disorders.This study aims to determine the healing effect of Teucrium polium (T. polium) in acetic acid-induced UC in an experimental dog model. METHODS From September to December 2010, eight male (20-25 kg) crossbred dogs were used for induction of UC by 6% acetic acid, transrectally. After one week, three biopsies (10, 20 and 30 cm proximal to the anal verge) were taken from the colon of each animal for histological studies. In the presence of UC, 400 mg/kg/day of T. polium extract was administered orally and transrectally (via enema) for 30 days in six of the dogs. The remaining two dogs were used as controls and did not receive T. polium. Multiple biopsies were taken 7, 14, and 30 days after discontinuation of T. polium in the same manner as before treatment. RESULTS After administration of acetic acid, we noted the presence of multiple ulcers, diffuse inflammation, PMN infiltration in the lamina propria, glandular destruction and goblet cell depletion. Treatment with T. polium restored the colonic architecture with an increased number of healthy cells and a reduction in inflammatory cells. Damage of the surface epithelial cells and mucosal layer of the lumen were reversed, which lead to faster ulcer healing. CONCLUSION T. polium may be a treatment choice for UC and can broaden the current therapy options for UC.},

   abstract = {BACKGROUND: Although the role of microbes in disease pathogenesis is well established, data describing the variability of the vast microbiome in children diagnosed with ulcerative colitis (UC) are lacking. This study characterizes the gut microbiome in hospitalized children with severe UC and determines the relationship between microbiota and response to steroid therapy. METHODS: Fecal samples were collected from 26 healthy controls and 27 children hospitalized with severe UC as part of a prospective multicenter study. DNA extraction, polymerase chain reaction (PCR) amplification of bacterial 16S rRNA, and microarray hybridization were performed. Results were analyzed in GeneSpring GX 11.0 comparing healthy controls with children with UC, and steroid responsive (n = 17) with nonresponsive patients (n = 10). RESULTS: Bacterial signal strength and distribution showed differences between UC and healthy controls (adjusted P < 0.05) for Phylum, Class, Order, Family, Genus, and Phylospecies levels with reduction in Clostridia and an increase in Gamma-proteobacteria. The number of microbial phylospecies was reduced in UC (266 +/- 69) vs. controls (758 +/- 3, P < 0.001), as was the Shannon Diversity Index (6.1 +/- 0.23 vs. 6.49 +/- 0.04, respectively; P < 0.0001). Steroid nonresponders harbored fewer phylospecies than responders (142 +/- 49 vs. 338 +/- 62, P = 0.013). CONCLUSIONS: Richness, evenness, and biodiversity of the gut microbiome were remarkably reduced in children with UC compared with healthy controls. Children who did not respond to steroids harbored a microbiome that was even less rich than steroid responders. This study is the first to characterize the gut microbiome in a large cohort of pediatric patients with severe UC and describes changes in the gut microbiome as a potential prognostic feature.},

Here, we present a patient with idiopathic inferior mesenteric venous (IMV) thrombosis. A 65-year-old man presented with constant abdominal pain associated with fever and bloody diarrhea. He was diagnosed with severe ulcerative colitis and was treated with mesalazine and prednisolone. The prednisolone was tapered because of liver dysfunction, and he received total parenteral nutrition for a month. His abdominal pain and bloody diarrhea worsened, and he lost 5 kg of weight. He was then transferred to our institute. Computed tomography showed thickening of the left colon. Colonoscopy showed diffuse colitis with multiple ulcers, large edematous folds, congested mucosa, and stenosis of the sigmoid colon, with sparing of the rectum, raising the possibility of IMV thrombosis. Angiography confirmed IMV thrombosis. Anticoagulation therapy was initiated with intravenous heparin followed by oral warfarin. His abdominal pain and diarrhea resolved, and he was discharged from hospital. Six months later, he remained asymptomatic with normal colonoscopic findings.},

She underwent combination therapy consisting of high-dose corticosteroids, intensive GMA (two sessions per week) and vancomycin, which was used to eradicate Clostridium difficile, under total parenteral nutrition control until the estimated weight of her fetus reached 1,000 g. This combination therapy was partially successful, resulting in almost complete disappearance of abdominal pain and a marked decrease in stool frequency. However bloody diarrhea persisted and the patient developed anemia and hypoalbuminemia and was unable to prolong her gestation time. Cesarean section was conducted at 28 weeks of gestation without any congenital abnormalities or neurological defects. Oral administration of tacrolimus was begun 7 days after cesarean section, which was followed by rapid induction of remission. Corticosteroids were then gradually tapered off. Tacrolimus is one therapeutic option after cesarean section in pregnant patients who do not respond well to GMA and high-dose corticosteroids for persistent active ulcerative colitis.},

   abstract = {Increased production of matrix metalloproteinases (MMPs) plays an important role in tissue damage in inflammatory bowel disease (IBD). Genetically encoded variation between individuals in MMP production may therefore contribute to disease onset, type, or severity. We undertook an extensive candidate gene single nucleotide polymorphism (SNP) study of MMP-1, -2, -3, -7, -8, -9, -10, -12, -13, and -14 and tissue inhibitor of metalloproteinases (TIMPs)-1, -3, and -4 in ulcerative colitis (UC). We identified tagging SNPs across these genes, and genotyped these SNPs in a Caucasian New Zealand dataset consisting of 419 UC patients and 907 controls. SNPs in a number of MMP genes were associated with UC. After correcting for multiple testing SNPs in MMP-3, MMP-8, MMP-10, and MMP-14 remained significant in their associations with UC. In a second study, using samples from a Dutch cohort, most of the significant findings in the New Zealand cohort were not replicated. However, data from an international meta-analysis provide some support for the initial findings. In conclusion, this study provides preliminary evidence to suggest that genetic variation in the MMPs may play a role in interindividual differences in UC susceptibility and clinical outcome. Further studies are needed in other cohorts to determine the robustness of these observations in different populations.},

   abstract = {BACKGROUND: The inflammatory bowel diseases (IBD) Crohn's disease and ulcerative colitis result from alterations in intestinal microbes and the immune system. However, the precise dysfunctions of microbial metabolism in the gastrointestinal microbiome during IBD remain unclear. We analyzed the microbiota of intestinal biopsies and stool samples from 231 IBD and healthy subjects by 16S gene pyrosequencing and followed up a subset using shotgun metagenomics. Gene and pathway composition were assessed, based on 16S data from phylogenetically-related reference genomes, and associated using sparse multivariate linear modeling with medications, environmental factors, and IBD status. RESULTS: Firmicutes and Enterobacteriaceae abundances were associated with disease status as expected, but also with treatment and subject characteristics. Microbial function, though, was more consistently perturbed than composition, with 12% of analyzed pathways changed compared with 2% of genera. We identified major shifts in oxidative stress pathways, as well as decreased carbohydrate metabolism and amino acid biosynthesis in favor of nutrient transport and uptake. The microbiome of ileal Crohn's disease was notable for increases in virulence and secretion pathways. CONCLUSIONS: This inferred functional metagenomic information provides the first insights into community-wide microbial processes and pathways that underpin IBD pathogenesis.},

   abstract = {Pro-inflammatory cytokines like macrophage migration inhibitory factor (MIF), IL-1beta and TNF-alpha predominate in inflammatory bowel diseases (IBD) and TNBS colitis. Increased levels of serine proteases activating protease-activated receptor 2 (PAR-2) are found in the lumen and colonic tissue of IBD patients. PAR-2 activity and pro-inflammatory cytokines impair epithelial barrier, facilitating the uptake of luminal aggressors that perpetuate inflammation and visceral pain. Soy extracts contain phytoestrogens (isoflavones) and serine protease inhibitors namely Bowman-Birk Inhibitors (BBI). Since estrogens exhibit anti-inflammatory and epithelial barrier enhancing properties, and that a BBI concentrate improves ulcerative colitis, we aimed to evaluate if a fermented soy germ extract (FSG) with standardized isoflavone profile and stable BBI content exert cumulative or synergistic protection based on protease inhibition and estrogen receptor (ER)-ligand activity in colitic rats. Female rats received orally for 15 d either vehicle or FSG with or without an ER antagonist ICI 182.780 before TNBS intracolonic instillation. Macroscopic and microscopic damages, myeloperoxidase activity, cytokine levels, intestinal paracellular permeability, visceral sensitivity, faecal proteolytic activity and PAR-2 expression were assessed 24 h, 3 d and 5 d post-TNBS. FSG treatment improved the severity of colitis, by decreasing the TNBS-induced rise in gut permeability, visceral sensitivity, faecal proteolytic activity and PAR-2 expression at all post-TNBS points. All FSG effects were reversed by the ICI 182.780 except the decrease in faecal proteolytic activity and PAR-2 expression. In conclusion, the anti-inflammatory properties of FSG treatment result from two distinct but synergic pathways i.e an ER-ligand and a PAR-2 mediated pathway, providing rationale for potential use as adjuvant therapy in IBD.},

   abstract = {BACKGROUND & AIMS: RAC1 is a guanosine triphosphatase that has an evolutionarily conserved role in coordinating immune defenses, from plants to mammals. Chronic inflammatory bowel diseases are associated with dysregulation of immune defenses. We studied the role of RAC1 in inflammatory bowel diseases using human genetic and functional studies and animal models of colitis. METHODS: We used a candidate gene approach to HapMap-Tag single nucleotide polymorphisms in a discovery cohort; findings were confirmed in 2 additional cohorts. RAC1 messenger RNA expression was examined from peripheral blood cells of patients. Colitis was induced in mice with conditional disruption of Rac1 in phagocytes by administration of dextran sulfate sodium. RESULTS: We observed a genetic association between RAC1 with ulcerative colitis in a discovery cohort, 2 independent replication cohorts, and in combined analysis for the single nucleotide polymorphisms rs10951982 (P(combined UC) = 3.3 x 10(-8), odds ratio = 1.43 [95% confidence interval: 1.26-1.63]) and rs4720672 (P(combined UC) = 4.7 x 10(-6), odds ratio = 1.36 [95% confidence interval: 1.19-1.58]). Patients with inflammatory bowel disease who had the rs10951982 risk allele had increased expression of RAC1 compared to those without this allele. Conditional disruption of Rac1 in macrophage and neutrophils of mice protected against dextran sulfate sodium-induced colitis. CONCLUSIONS: Human studies and knockout mice demonstrated a role for the guanosine triphosphatase RAC1 in the development of ulcerative colitis; increased expression of RAC1 was associated with susceptibility to colitis.},

   abstract = {The objective was to systematically review the efficacy and safety of n-3 (omega-3 fatty acids, fish oil) for maintaining remission in Crohn's disease (CD) and ulcerative colitis (UC). Electronic databases were searched systematically for randomized controlled trials of n-3 for maintenance of remission in inflammatory bowel disease (IBD). Studies of patients of any age group who were in remission at the time of recruitment and were followed for at least 6 months were included. The primary outcome was relapse rate at the end of the follow-up period. Nine studies were eligible for inclusion; six studies of CD (n = 1039) and three of UC (n = 138). There was a statistically significant benefit for n-3 in CD (relative risk [RR] 0.77; 95% confidence interval [CI] 0.61-0.98); however, the studies were heterogeneous (I 2 = 58%). The absolute risk reduction was -0.14 (95% CI: -0.25 to -0.02). Opinions may vary on whether this is a clinically significant effect. Two well-done studies with a larger sample size reported no benefit. A sensitivity analysis excluding a small pediatric study resulted in the pooled RR being no longer statistically significant. A funnel plot analysis suggested publication bias for the smaller studies. For UC, there was no difference in the relapse rate between the n-3 and control groups (RR 1.02; 95% CI: 0.51-2.03). The pooled analysis showed a higher rate of diarrhea (RR 1.36; 95% CI: 1.01-1.84) and symptoms of the upper gastrointestinal tract (RR 1.96; 95% CI: 1.37-2.80) in the n-3 treatment group. There are insufficient data to recommend the use of omega-3 fatty acids for maintenance of remission in CD and UC. ( Inflamm Bowel Dis. 2011;17:336-345).},

   abstract = {Heme oxygenase-1 (HO-1) is the rate-limiting enzyme in the catabolism of heme, followed by production of biliverdin, free iron and carbon monoxide (CO). HO-1 is a stress-responsive protein induced by various oxidative agents. Recent studies demonstrate that the expression of HO-1 in response to different inflammatory mediators may contribute to the resolution of inflammation and has protective effects in several organs against oxidative injury. Although the mechanism underlying the anti-inflammatory actions of HO-1 remains poorly defined, both CO and biliverdin/bilirubin have been implicated in this response. In the gastrointestinal tract, HO-1 is shown to be transcriptionally induced in response to oxidative stress, preconditioning and acute inflammation. Recent studies suggest that the induction of HO-1 expression plays a critical protective role in intestinal damage models induced by ischemia-reperfusion, indomethacin, lipopolysaccharide-associated sepsis, trinitrobenzene sulfonic acid, and dextran sulfate sodium, indicating that activation of HO-1 may act as an endogenous defensive mechanism to reduce inflammation and tissue injury in the gastrointestinal tract. In addition, CO derived from HO-1 is shown to be involved in the regulation in gastro-intestinal motility. These in vitro and in vivo data suggest that HO-1 may be a novel therapeutic target in patients with gastrointestinal diseases.},

   abstract = {OBJECTIVE: Inflammatory bowel disease (IBD) is a chronic inflammatory process in the digestive tract and patients with IBD develop osteopenia. Although vitamins K and D are important for maintaining bone health and inhibiting inflammation, their roles in patients with IBD are not clear. We investigated the roles of vitamins K and D in the bone health and inflammation in patients with IBD. METHODS: Bone mineral density (BMD) of patients with IBD (Crohn's disease [CD], n = 47, and ulcerative colitis [UC], n = 40) was measured with dual-energy X-ray absorptiometry. Vitamin K and D levels of patients with IBD and healthy volunteers (n = 41) were evaluated by measuring serum undercarboxylated osteocalcin and 1,25 dihydroxyvitamin D, respectively. Clinical activity index was evaluated in patients with CD and UC. RESULTS: BMD was low in patients with CD and UC. Serum undercarboxylated osteocalcin levels were significantly higher in patients with CD, but not with UC, compared with healthy subjects, indicating that bone vitamin K is insufficient in patients with CD. The levels of undercarboxylated osteocalcin were significantly correlated with the clinical activity index of CD, although they were not correlated with BMD. The levels of 1,25 dihydroxyvitamin D were significantly lower in patients with CD and UC than in healthy subjects. The levels of 1,25 dihydroxyvitamin D were inversely correlated with BMD in patients with UC and were not correlated with the clinical activity index of CD. CONCLUSION: Vitamins K and D are insufficient in patients with IBD. Insufficiency of vitamin K is suggested to be associated with inflammatory processes of CD.},

   abstract = {In vitro and animals models have long been used to study human diseases and identify novel therapeutic approaches that can be applied to combat these conditions. Ulcerative colitis and Crohn's disease are the two main entities of inflammatory bowel disease (IBD). There is an intricate relationship between IBD features in human patients, in vitro and animal colitis models, mechanisms and possible therapeutic approaches in these models, and strategies that can be extrapolated and applied in humans. Malnutrition, particularly protein-energy malnutrition and vitamin and micronutrient deficiencies, as well as dysregulation of the intestinal microbiota, are common features of IBD. Based on these observations, dietary supplementation with essential nutrients known to be in short supply in the diet in IBD patients and with other molecules believed to provide beneficial anti-inflammatory effects, as well as with probiotic organisms that stimulate immune functions and resistance to infection has been tested in colitis models. Here we review current knowledge on nutritional and probiotic supplementation in in vitro and animal colitis models. While some of these strategies require further fine-tuning before they can be applied in human IBD patients, their intended purpose is to prevent, delay or treat disease symptoms in a non-pharmaceutical manner.},

Although biological agents are alternative treatments, they may not be suitable or available to some patients. AIM: To review the evidence for use of nonbiological drugs in the treatment of patients with IBD refractory to corticosteroids or thiopurines. METHODS: A literature search was performed using PubMed for English language publications with predetermined search criteria to identify relevant studies. RESULTS: Published evidence from uncontrolled series and controlled clinical trials has been used to produce a practical approach relevant to clinical practice which incorporates the indication, optimal dose, and side effects of various therapies including tacrolimus, methotrexate, thalidomide, tioguanine, mycophenolate mofotil, leucocyte apheresis, nutritional therapy, antibiotics, probiotics, allopurinol, rectal acetarsol and ciclosporin in the treatment of patients with refractory ulcerative colitis and Crohn's disease. Approaches to optimise thiopurine efficacy are also discussed. CONCLUSIONS: Patients with IBD refractory to corticosteroids or thiopurines may respond to alternative anti-inflammatory chemical molecules, but the evidence base for many of these alternatives is limited and further trials are needed.},

   abstract = {BACKGROUND AND AIM: The effect of vitamin D supplementation on immune disorders has been a topical research focus. The aim of this systematic review was to examine the current evidence of the effect of vitamin D supplementation as a therapy for colitis. METHODS: The following databases were searched: MEDLINE, Pubmed, Scopus, Web of Knowledge, Cinicaltrials.gov and the Cochrane Central Register of Controlled Trials using the terms 'inflammatory bowel disease' 'Crohn's disease' 'ulcerative colitis' 'colitis' [and] 'vitamin D'. Both human and animal studies published in English language were examined. The reference lists of included studies and review articles were manually searched for any relevant studies. RESULTS: Four studies were included in this systematic review. All reported an improvement in disease activity with vitamin D supplementation. The only high quality human study reported a non-significant reduction of relapse rate for Crohn's disease. No major adverse effects of vitamin D supplementation were reported. CONCLUSIONS: Although there is some evidence that supplemental vitamin D, as an adjunctive treatment, may help in controlling colitis, this evidence is not enough to justify using vitamin D in treating inflammatory bowel disease (IBD). Large high quality placebo-controlled randomised controlled trials are needed to explore a possible benefit of using vitamin D in treating IBD.},

   abstract = {UNLABELLED: THE AIM OF THE STUDY was to describe the authors' experience in performing laparoscopic restorative proctocolectomy with the formation of an intestinal reservoir of the J-pouch type, anal anastomosis and protective ileostomy. MATERIAL AND METHODS: Between 2004 and 2011, a total of 23 patients underwent laparoscopic restorative proctocolectomy with the formation of an intestinal reservoir of the J-pouch type, anal anastomosis and protective ileostomy for ulcerative colitis (n = 17) or familial adenomatous polyposis (n = 6). A statistical analysis of the treatment outcomes was performed. RESULTS: No intraoperative complications were observed and none of the patients required conversion or blood transfusions. The mean duration of the procedure was 4.08 hours (2.5-6.0 hours). The mean duration of hospitalization was 15.4 days (8-24 days). We observed three major postoperative complications requiring intervention: two cases of small bowel obstruction (one due to postoperative adhesions and the other due to volvulus) and one case of infection of the surgical and ostomy wound healed following ileostomy closure. CONCLUSIONS: For such extensive procedures as restorative proctocolectomy, laparoscopic techniques prove safe and are characterised by a better patient acceptance thanks to the low invasiveness and good cosmetic effects. The technological progress and the increasing experience in performing laparoscopy provide more and more arguments to support the selection of this method as the preferred method of treatment.},

   abstract = {TANK-binding kinase 1 (TBK1) regulates the interferon regulatory factor (IRF) 3 and IRF7 activation pathways by double strand RNA (dsRNA) via Toll-like receptor (TLR) 3 and by lipopolysaccharide (LPS) via TLR4. Rebamipide is useful for treating inflammatory bowel disease (IBD). Although IBD is associated with nuclear factor-kappaB (NF-kappaB), any association with the TBK1-IRF pathway remains unknown. How rebamipide affects the TBK1-IRF pathway is also unclear. We analyzed the relationship between IBD (particularly ulcerative colitis; UC) and the TLR-TBK1-IRF3/7 pathway using human colon tissue, a murine model of colitis and human colonic epithelial cells. Inflamed colonic mucosa over-expressed TKB1, NAP1, IRF3, and IRF7 mRNA compared with normal mucosa. TBK1 was mainly expressed in inflammatory epithelial cells of UC patients. The expression of TBK1, IRF3, IRF7, IFN-alpha and IFN-beta mRNA was suppressed in mice given oral dextran sulfate-sodium (DSS) and daily rectal rebamipide compared with mice given only DSS. Rebamipide reduced the expression of TBK1, IRF3 and IRF7 mRNA induced by LPS/dsRNA, but not of NF-kappaB mRNA in colonic epithelial cells. Rebamipide might suppress the TLR-TBK1 pathway, resulting in IRF3/7-induction of IFN-alpha/beta and inflammatory factors. TBK1 is important in the induction of inflammation in patients with UC. If rebamipide represses the TLR-TBK1 pathway, then rectal administration should suppress inflammation of the colonic mucosa in patients with UC.},

   abstract = {Biological therapies are an important step in the management of Inflammatory Bowel Diseases. In consideration of high cost and safety issues there is the need to have clear recommendations for their use. Despite the American Gastroenterological Association and the European Crohn's and Colitis Organisation have published exhaustive Inflammatory Bowel Disease guidelines, national guidelines may be necessary as cultural values, economical and legal issues may differ between countries. For these reasons the Italian Society of Gastroenterology and the Italian Group for the study of Inflammatory Bowel Disease have decided to elaborate the Italian guidelines on the use of biologics in Inflammatory Bowel Disease. The following items have been chosen: definitions of active, inactive, steroid dependent and resistant disease; measures of activity; anti-tumor necrosis factor alpha therapy use in active steroid dependent and refractory luminal Crohn's Disease, in fistulising Crohn's Disease, in steroid dependent and resistant active Ulcerative Colitis; risk of cancer; risk of infections during anti-tumor necrosis factor alpha therapy; special situations. These guidelines are based on evidence from relevant medical literature and clinical experience of a national working group.},

   abstract = {BACKGROUND: The magnitude of association between homocysteine metabolism and inflammatory bowel diseases (IBD) remains unknown, whereas the association between hyperhomocysteinaemia and thrombosis remains controversial in IBD. AIM: To conduct a systematic review and meta-analysis to examine these issues. METHODS: The literature search was conducted using MEDLINE database and international conference abstracts from January 1966 to April 2011 and included all studies that evaluated plasma homocysteine level in IBD. RESULTS: Twenty-eight studies evaluated the plasma homocysteine level and/or hyperhomocysteinaemia risk in IBD patients. Five studies assessed the association of hyperhomocysteinaemia with thrombosis. The mean plasma homocysteine level was significantly higher in IBD patients when compared with controls (weighted mean difference (WMD)=3.75 mumol/L; 95% CI, 2.23-5.26 mumol/L; P<0.0001; reference ranges for plasma homocysteine level: 5-12 mumol/L). The mean plasma homocysteine level did not differ between ulcerative colitis (UC) and Crohn's disease (CD) (WMD=0.41 mumol/L; 95% CI, -2.45 to 3.06 mumol/L; P=0.76). The risk of hyperhomocysteinaemia was significantly higher in IBD patients when compared with controls [odds ratio (OR)=4.65; 95% CI, 3.04-7.09; P<0.0001]. The risk of hyperhomocysteinaemia was not higher among IBD patients who experienced thromboembolic complications (OR=1.97; 95% CI, 0.83-4.67; P=0.12). Plasma folate level was inversely correlated with IBD risk associated with MTHFR C677T polymorphism (P=0.006). CONCLUSIONS: The risk of hyperhomocysteinaemia is significantly higher in IBD patients when compared with controls. The risk assessment of hyperhomocysteinaemia-related thrombosis in IBD requires further investigation. Deficient folate status is associated with a higher impact of MTHFR C677T polymorphism on IBD risk.},

   abstract = {BACKGROUND: Inflammatory bowel diseases (IBDs) are costly chronic gastrointestinal diseases, with pediatric IBD representing increased costs per patient compared to adult disease. Health care expenditures for ulcerative colitis (UC) are >$2 billion annually. It is not clear whether the addition of VSL#3 to standard medical therapy in UC induction and maintenance of remission is a cost-effective strategy. PATIENTS AND METHODS: We performed a systematic review of the literature and created a Markov model simulating a cohort of 10-year-old patients with severe UC, studying them until 100 years of age or death. We compared 2 strategies: standard medical therapy versus medical therapy + VSL#3. For both strategies, we assumed that patients progressed through escalating therapies--mesalamine, azathioprine, and infliximab--before receiving a colectomy + ileal pouch anal anastamosis (IPAA) if the 3 medical therapy options were exhausted. The primary outcome measure was the incremental cost-effectiveness ratio (ICER), defined as the difference of costs between strategies for each quality-adjusted life-year (QALY) gained. One-way sensitivity analyses were performed on variables to determine the key variables affecting cost-effectiveness. RESULTS: Standard medical care accrued a lifetime cost of $203,317 per patient, compared to $212,582 per patient for medical therapy + VSL#3. Lifetime QALYs gained was comparable for standard medical therapy and medical therapy + VSL#3 at 24.93 versus 25.05, respectively. Using the definition of ICER <50,000/QALY as a cost-effective intervention, medical therapy + VSL#3 produced an ICER of $79,910 per QALY gained, making this strategy cost-ineffective. Sensitivity analyses showed that 4 key parameters could affect the cost-effectiveness of the 2 strategies: cost of colectomy + IPAA, maintenance cost after surgery, probability of developing pouchitis after surgery, and the quality of life after a colectomy + IPAA. High surgical and postsurgical costs, a high probability of developing pouchitis, and a low quality of life after a colectomy + IPAA could make adjunct VSL#3 use a cost-effective strategy. CONCLUSIONS: Given present data, adjunct VSL#3 use for pediatric UC induction and maintenance of remission is not cost-effective, although several key parameters could make this strategy cost-effective. The quality of life after an IPAA is the single most important variable predicting whether this procedure benefits patients over escalating standard medical therapy.},

   abstract = {BACKGROUND: Inflammatory bowel diseases are costly chronic gastrointestinal diseases. We aimed to determine whether immediate colectomy with ileal pouch-anal anastamosis (IPAA) after diagnosis of severe ulcerative colitis (UC) was cost-effective compared to the standard medical therapy. METHODS: We created a Markov model simulating 2 cohorts of 21-year-old patients with severe UC, following them until 100 years of age or death, comparing early colectomy with IPAA strategy to the standard medical therapy strategy. Deterministic and probabilistic analyses were performed. RESULTS: Standard medical care accrued a discounted lifetime cost of $236,370 per patient. In contrast, early colectomy with IPAA accrued a discounted lifetime cost of $147,763 per patient. Lifetime quality-adjusted life-years gained (QALY-gained) for standard medical therapy was 20.78, while QALY-gained for early colectomy with IPAA was 20.72. The resulting incremental cost-effectiveness ratio (Deltacosts/DeltaQALY) was approximately $1.5 million per QALY-gained. Results were robust to one-way sensitivity analyses for all variables in the model. Quality-of-life after colectomy with IPAA was the most sensitive variable impacting cost-effectiveness. A low utility value of less than 0.7 after colectomy with IPAA was necessary for the colectomy with IPAA strategy to be cost-ineffective. CONCLUSIONS: Under the appropriate clinical settings, early colectomy with IPAA after diagnosis of severe UC reduces health care expenditures and provides comparable quality of life compared to exhaustive standard medical therapy.},

   abstract = {BACKGROUND: In ulcerative colitis (UC), reduction of inflammation may represent a key mechanism in UC therapy, and anti-inflammatory agents would be good candidates for preventing UC. Kaempferol, a natural flavonoid, is believed to have anti-inflammatory activities and has been shown to be potentially immune-modulatory. AIMS: The aim of this study was to determine whether kaempferol alleviates the inflammatory responses of dextran sulfate sodium (DSS)-induced colitis in mice. METHODS: Female C57BL/6J mice were divided into six groups: a negative control group, a DSS control group, and DSS + 0.1% or 0.3% kaempferol pre- or post-fed groups. At the end of the experimental period, clinical and biochemical markers were evaluated. RESULTS: Plasma levels of NO and PGE(2) were significantly decreased in both the 0.3% kaempferol pre- and post-fed groups. The plasma LTB(4) level was profoundly decreased in all animals fed kaempferol. Colonic mucosa MPO activity was also suppressed in both the 0.3% kaempferol pre- or post-fed groups. TFF3 mRNA, a marker for goblet cell function, was up-regulated in kaempferol pre-fed animals. CONCLUSIONS: These results indicate that kaempferol is an effective anti-inflammatory agent that protects colonic mucosa from DSS-induced UC. Dietary kaempferol fed prior to colitis induction was more effective to suppress some of the colitis-associated markers.},

The present study evaluated the anti-inflammatory effects of aloe components (aloin, aloesin and aloe-gel) known to be biologically active in the rat model of colitis. MAIN METHODS: Male Sprague Dawley rats were fed experimental diets for 2 weeks before and during the induction of colitis. Drinking water containing 3% dextran sulfate sodium (DSS) was provided for 1 week to induce colitis. At the end of the experimental period, clinical and biochemical markers were compared. KEY FINDINGS: Plasma leukotriene B(4) (LTB(4)) and tumor necrosis factor-alpha (TNF-alpha) concentrations were significantly decreased in all groups supplemented with aloe components compared to the colitis control group (p<0.05). Animals fed both a 0.1% and 0.5% aloesin supplemented diet showed colonic myeloperoxidase (MPO) activities which were decreased by 32.2% and 40.1%, respectively (p<0.05). Colonic mucosa TNF-alpha and interleukin-1ss (IL-1beta) mRNA expressions were significantly reduced in all animals fed aloin, aloesin, or aloe-gel (p<0.05). SIGNIFICANCE: Dietary supplementation of aloe components ameliorates intestinal inflammatory responses in a DSS-induced ulcerative colitis rat model. In particular, aloesin was the most potent inhibitor. Further studies are required for a more complete understanding of the specific mechanism of the action of these supplements.},

   abstract = {BACKGROUND: miR-143 and miR-145 are believed to function as colon cancer tumor suppressors, as they inhibit colon cancer cell growth and are downregulated in sporadic colonic tumors. We speculated that miR-143 and miR-145 might also be downregulated and contribute to malignant transformation of colonic epithelium in longstanding ulcerative colitis (UC). METHODS: Biopsies were obtained 20 cm proximal to the anus from individuals with quiescent UC and from normal controls. RNA and proteins were extracted and measured. miR-143 and miR-145 were quantified by real-time polymerase chain reaction (PCR) and miR-145 was also assessed by in situ hybridization. Putative targets of these miRNAs, K-RAS, API5, MEK-2 (miR-143), and IRS-1 (miR-145) were determined by western blotting. To assess the effects of miR-143 and miR-145 on these predicted targets, HCT116 and HCA-7 colorectal cancer cells were transfected with miR-143 and miR-145 and expression levels of these proteins were measured. RESULTS: In UC, miR-143 and miR-145 were significantly downregulated 8.3-fold (3.4-20.1) (P < 0.0001) and 4.3-fold (2.3-7.8) (P < 0.0001), respectively, compared to normal colon. In contrast, IRS-1, K-RAS, API5, and MEK-2 were upregulated in UC, consistent with their assignments as targets of these miRNAs. Furthermore, transfected miR-143 and miR-145 significantly downregulated these proteins in HCT116 or HCA-7 cells. CONCLUSIONS: Compared to normal colonic mucosa, in chronic UC miR-143 and miR-145 were significantly downregulated and their predicted targets, IRS-1, K-RAS, API5, and MEK-2 were upregulated. We postulate that loss of these tumor suppressor miRNAs predispose to chronic inflammation and neoplastic progression in IBD.},

   abstract = {The cytokine IL-1 is critical to the pathogenesis of a variety of human conditions and diseases. Unlike most other cytokines, IL-1 is counterbalanced by two endogenous inhibitors. The functional significance of IL-1 receptor antagonist (IL-1RA) is well documented due to the clinical utilization of the recombinant human IL-1RA analog, anakinra. In contrast, much less is known about the type 2 IL-1 receptor (IL-1R2), which acts as a decoy receptor for IL-1. While IL-1R2 is structurally similar to the type 1 IL-1 receptor (IL-1R1) responsible for IL-1 signal transduction, its truncated cytoplasmic domain and lack of Toll-IL-1 receptor (TIR) region renders IL-1R2 incapable of transmembrane signaling. IL-1R2 competes with IL-1R1 for ligands and for the IL-1R1 co-receptor, IL-1 receptor accessory protein (IL-1RAP). Additionally, IL-1R2 exists in both a membrane bound and soluble form (sIL-1R2) that has biological properties similar to both a decoy receptor and a binding protein. Thus far, IL-1R2 has been implicated in arthritis, endometriosis, organ transplantation, sepsis/sickness behavior, diabetes, atherosclerosis, autoimmune inner ear disease (AIED), Alzheimer's disease and ulcerative colitis. In this review, we will detail the functional properties of IL-1R2 and examine its role in human disease.},

   abstract = {BACKGROUND: New medical therapies have improved outlook in inflammatory bowel disease but published impact on surgical rates has been modest suggesting that many patients are still not attaining remission. AIM: To review remission rates with current medical treatments for inflammatory bowel disease. METHODS: We searched MEDLINE (source PUBMED, 1966 to January, 2011). RESULTS: Induction and maintenance of remission was observed in 20% (range, 9-29.5%) and 53% (range, 36.8-59.6%) of ulcerative colitis (UC) patients treated with oral 5-ASA derivatives. Induction of remission was noted in 52% (range, 48-58%) of Crohn's disease (CD) patients and 54% of UC patients treated with steroids in population-based cohorts. Maintenance of remission was reported in 71% (range, 56-95%) of CD patients on azathioprine over a 6-month to 2-year period and in 60% (range, 41.7-82.4%) in UC at 1 year or longer. Induction and maintenance of remission was noted in 39% (range, 19.3-66.7%) and 70% (range, 39-90%) of CD patients on methotrexate over a 40-week period. Induction of remission was reported in 32% (range, 25-48%), 26% (range, 18-36%) and 20% (range, 19-23%) of CD patients on infliximab, adalimumab or certolizumab pegol, respectively. The corresponding figures were 45% (range, 39-59%), 43% (range, 40-47%) and 47.9% at weeks 20-30 among initial responders. Induction of remission was observed in 33% (range, 27.5-38.8%) and 18.5% of UC patients on infliximab or adalimumab, respectively. Maintenance of remission was noted in 33% (range, 25.6-36.9%) of UC patients on infliximab at week 30. Approximately one-fifth of CD and UC patients treated with biologicals require intestinal resection after 2-5 years in referral-centre studies. CONCLUSION: In the era of biologics, the proportion of patients with inflammatory bowel disease not entering remission remains high.},

   abstract = {OBJECTIVES: Our work is aimed at identifying ex vivo new transcription factors, potentially involved in the pathogenesis of pediatric inflammatory bowel disease (IBD), by using a microarray approach. PATIENTS AND METHODS: Microarray, including 84 transcription factors, was performed in inflamed and uninflamed mucosal tissues of pediatric patients with Crohn disease (CD) and in healthy controls. Real-time polymerase chain reaction was used to confirm microarray results on a larger size of CD and patients with ulcerative colitis (UC). Protein expression was evaluated by Western blot assay. RESULTS: Microarray assay showed 40 genes differentially regulated in the inflamed mucosa and 17 in the uninflamed mucosa of patients with CD as compared with controls. Real-time polymerase chain reaction analysis revealed 10 transcripts in CD and 4 in UC, selected among those with higher differences as compared with healthy controls, significantly overexpressed in the inflamed tissues of patients. Moreover, 4 transcripts in CD and 2 in UC were found significantly upregulated in the uninvolved tissue. A further investigation evidenced an increased protein expression of activating transcription factor 3 and hypoxia-inducible transcription factor-1alpha in patients with CD as well as in Caco2 cell line stimulated by cytokines and hypoxia. CONCLUSIONS: The present study shows an evident upregulation of several transcription factors in the inflamed and uninflamed mucosa of children with IBD, suggesting that the inflammatory process is somehow activated at molecular levels even in the macroscopically normal mucosa of patients. A differential pattern of gene expression between CD and UC indicates distinct molecular mechanisms underlying the pathogenesis of 2 diseases. Finally, activating transcription factor 3 and hypoxia-inducible transcription factor-1alpha are proposed as new transcription factors potentially involved in the onset and maintenance of IBD.},

   abstract = {In vitro and animal studies point to numerous mechanisms by which fatty acids, especially long-chain polyunsaturated fatty acids (LCPUFA), can modulate the innate and adaptive arms of the immune system. These data strongly suggest that improving the fatty acid supply of young children in low-income countries might have immune benefits. Unfortunately, there have been virtually no studies of fatty acid/immune interactions in such settings. Clinical trial registers list over 150 randomized controlled trials (RCTs) involving PUFAs, only one in a low-income setting (the Gambia). We summarize those results here. There was evidence for improved growth and nutritional status, but the primary end point of chronic environmental enteropathy showed no benefit, possibly because the infants were still substantially breastfed. In high-income settings, there have been RCTs with fatty acids (usually LCPUFAs) in relation to 18 disease end points, for some of which there have been numerous trials (asthma, inflammatory bowel disease and rheumatoid arthritis). For these diseases, the evidence is judged reasonable for risk reduction for childhood asthma (but not in adults), as yielding possible benefit in Crohn's disease (insufficient evidence in ulcerative colitis) and for convincing evidence for rheumatoid arthritis at sufficient dose levels, though formal meta-analyses are not yet available. This analysis suggests that fatty acid interventions could yield immune benefits in children in poor settings, especially in non-breastfed children and in relation to inflammatory conditions such as persistent enteropathy. Benefits might include improved responses to enteric vaccines, which frequently perform poorly in low-income settings, and these questions merit randomized trials.},

   abstract = {BACKGROUND AND AIMS: Crohn's Disease (CD) and ulcerative colitis (UC) are inflammatory bowel diseases (IBD), which may result in nutrition problems that impact on patient health, nutritional status and quality of life. Subjective reports of how IBD patients experience these problems as part of their disease process, including comparisons between patient groups, or the need for tailored nutrition advice as perceived by these patients, have not been widely studied. This survey aimed to identify and explore nutritional problems that are important to CD and UC patients and to investigate their views on the IBD health services provided to help them with these. METHODS: Eighty-seven IBD patients were invited to take part in a nutrition survey using face-to-face questionnaire interviews. The survey asked about food and nutrition problems that patients have experienced, identifying which were most significant and the extent to which they had been addressed by the clinical service. RESULTS: Seventy-two IBD patients completed the evaluation (47 CD, 25 UC). Of these, 45 (62.5%) felt that food and nutrition were either 'important' or 'extremely important' in their experience of IBD, and 59 (82%) reported problems with food and nutrition. Patients with CD and UC reported similar frequencies of most nutritional problems. However, 44 (94%) CD vs. 16 (64%) UC patients reported problems with weight (p=0.002). Less than half of patients had seen a dietitian for tailored nutritional advice to address these problems. CONCLUSIONS: Nutritional problems experienced and reported by IBD patients are numerous and varied. They are considered important by patients with CD and UC, both of whom would generally value specific dietary counselling, highlighting a need for further research in this area and adequate and equal provision of services for both groups.},

   abstract = {BACKGROUND: Subjective physician assessment is the cornerstone of routine ulcerative colitis (UC) management. Endoscopic and histologic assessment of UC provides objective measures of inflammatory disease activity. The level of agreement between physician impression of UC activity and endoscopic disease activity has not been evaluated. The aim was to assess the level of agreement between physician's clinical impression of UC disease activity and endoscopic and histologic findings of inflammation. METHODS: Using the Medical Archival Retrieval System at the University of Pittsburgh Medical Center, we reviewed clinical information on all UC patients between 1995 and 2008 who had clinic visits recorded prior to colonoscopy. Clinical UC disease activity was defined by the physician's clinical impression and the endoscopic and histologic activity by colonoscopy with biopsy. The level of agreement between colonoscopy assessment of UC with histologic and clinical assessment was determined by sensitivity, specificity, positive and negative predictive values, and the kappa coefficient. RESULTS: There were 369 UC patients who had a clinic visit proximate to a colonoscopy. The mean age of patients was 46 +/- 16 years (50% female). The performance of clinical impression in recognizing disease activity, as determined by endoscopy, was relatively poor: sensitivity = 56.0%, predictive value negative = 56.8%, kappa coefficient = 0.35. In contrast, the performance of histological evaluation in recognizing disease activity was markedly better: sensitivity = 93.5%, predictive value negative = 89.1%, kappa coefficient = 0.70. CONCLUSIONS: The physician's clinical impression of UC activity shows poor agreement with endoscopy and histology, with over one-third of patients with chronic inflammation underrecognized by clinical impression. The consequences of underestimated UC activity by clinical assessment may include undertreatment of active disease and uncontrolled chronic inflammation.},

   abstract = {OBJECTIVE: Mucosal cytokine profile determines T cell differentiation and may play an important role in the clinical course of inflammatory bowel disease (IBD). Cytokines from different T helper (Th) cell subsets are elevated in inflamed mucosa of patients with ulcerative colitis (UC), contributing to the inflammation. The aim of this study was to determine the predictive value of pre-treatment mucosal cytokine profile in response to therapy with the anti-TNF agent infliximab (IFX). MATERIAL AND METHODS: The expression of Th1, Th17, Th2 and T-regulatory (Treg)-related cytokines was quantified by real-time PCR in mucosal biopsies from 74 UC patients before initiation of IFX induction therapy. Clinical and endoscopic effects were assessed after three infusions. Remission was defined as ulcerative colitis disease activity index (UCDAI) below 3. RESULTS: Higher gene expression levels of IL-17A and IFN-gamma were significantly associated with remission after three IFX infusions (OR = 5.4, p = 0.013 and OR = 5.5, p = 0.011, respectively). IL-17A and IFN-gamma mRNA expression showed positive correlation. Th2 and Treg-related mediators were not significantly associated with clinical outcome, but were expressed at higher levels in UC patients compared with the controls. Immunohistochemistry (IHC) confirmed the presence of cells expressing both IL-17A and IFN-gamma. CONCLUSIONS: High expression of Th1- and Th17-related cytokines in the mucosa of UC patients can potentially predict a favorable outcome of IFX induction therapy. Th2 and Treg-related mediators do not appear useful as predictive markers.},

   abstract = {Ulcerative colitis and Crohn's disease are relapsing and remitting chronic disorders. So far, endoscopy is the gold standard for their diagnosis, but less invasive diagnostic biomarkers are needed. Many authors have developed techniques to individuate biomarkers such as genetic testing factor or proteins in biological samples such as serum, plasma, and cellular subpopulations. A protein fingerprint pattern, patient-unique, specific for the diagnosis of inflammatory bowel disease (IBD) and potentially able to predict the future patterns of disease and to help in diagnosis, treatment, and prognosis is of increasing interest among researchers. Nowadays, a proteomic approach may be used in the identification of major alterations of proteins in IBD, but there is still a lack in the identification of a panel of biomarkers among a significant number of patients in large clinical trials. In this review, we analyze and report the current knowledge in proteomic application and strategies in the study of IBD.},

   abstract = {BACKGROUND: Interleukin 13 (IL-13) is upregulated in ulcerative colitis (UC) and increases colon epithelial permeability by inducing apoptosis and expression of the pore-forming tight junction protein claudin-2. IL-13 induces activation of signal transducer and activator of transcription 6 (STAT6). However, the STAT6 phosphorylation status in patients with UC is unknown, as is the effect of STAT6 inhibition on colonic epithelium exposed to IL-13. The study aims were to determine if mucosal STAT6 phosphorylation is increased in patients with UC, and if STAT6 inhibition attenuates IL-13-induced colon epithelial cell dysfunction. METHODS: Immunohistochemical staining for phosphorylated (p) STAT6 was performed on colonic tissue from newly diagnosed pediatric subjects with UC (early UC) or Crohn's disease (CD), colectomy tissue from adults with UC (advanced UC), and controls. Colon HT-29 and T84 cells were transfected with STAT6 small interfering RNA (siRNA), or treated with suberoylanilide hydroxamic acid (SAHA), a histone deacetylase inhibitor that inhibits STAT6, prior to IL-13 treatment. RESULTS: The median score for epithelial pSTAT6 was 0 in control subjects, 2 in early UC (versus control P = 0.019), 4 in advanced UC (P = 0.003), and 0 in CD (P = 0.4). Cell transfection with STAT6 siRNA prevented IL-13-induced apoptosis and claudin-2 expression. SAHA inhibited IL-13-induced STAT6 phosphorylation, apoptosis, and claudin-2 expression, and mitigated IL-13-induced reductions in transepithelial resistance. CONCLUSIONS: UC is associated with increased colonic epithelial STAT6 phosphorylation, and STAT6 inhibition prevents IL-13-induced apoptosis and barrier disruption. These data identify STAT6 as a novel target for UC treatment and support further study of SAHA as a therapeutic agent.},

   abstract = {Ulcerative colitis (UC) and Crohn disease (CD), collectively referred to as inflammatory bowel disease (IBD), are chronic inflammatory disorders that can affect the gastrointestinal tract of children and adults. Like other autoimmune processes, the cause(s) of these disorders remain unknown but likely involves some interplay between genetic vulnerability and environmental factors. Children, in particular with UC or CD, can present to their primary care providers with similar symptoms, including abdominal pain, diarrhea, weight loss, and bloody stool. Although UC and CD are more predominant in adults, epidemiologic studies have demonstrated that a significant percentage of these patients were diagnosed during childhood. The chronic nature of the inflammatory process observed in these children and the waxing and waning nature of their clinical symptoms can be especially disruptive to their physical, social, and academic development. As such, physicians caring for children must consider these diseases when evaluating patients with compatible symptoms. Recent research efforts have made available a variety of more specific and effective pharmacologic agents and improved endoscopic and radiologic assessment tools to assist clinicians in the diagnosis and interval assessment of their patients with IBD; however, as the level of complexity of these interventions has increased, so too has the need for practitioners to become familiar with a wider array of treatments and the risks and benefits of particular diagnostic testing. Nonetheless, in most cases, and especially when frequent visits to subspecialty referral centers are not geographically feasible, primary care providers can be active participants in the management of their pediatric patients with IBD. The goal of this article is to educate and assist pediatricians and adult gastroenterology physicians caring for children with IBD, and in doing so, help to develop more collaborative care plans between primary care and subspecialty providers.},

Prevalence is 35 to 100/100,000 people in USA, 1% of them are infants. UC develops in a genetically predisposed individual with altered intestinal immune response. An eight-month-old girl presented with loose bloody stool, growth failure, and moderate pallor. The girl was diagnosed as a case of UC by colonoscopy and biopsy. Treatment was thereafter started with immunosuppressive drugs. After initial induction therapy with parenteral steroid and infliximab, the patient is now on remission with azathioprine and mesalamine. UC is rare in Bangladesh, especially in children, and it is rarer during infancy. Several conditions like infective colitis, allergic colitis, Meckel's diverticulitis, Crohn's disease, etc. may mimic the features of UC. So, if a child presents with recurrent bloody diarrhea, UC should be considered as differential diagnosis.},

   abstract = {BACKGROUND: Adalimumab is efficacious therapy for adults with Crohn's disease (CD). AIM: To summarise the United Kingdom and Republic of Ireland paediatric adalimumab experience. METHODS: British Society of Paediatric Gastroenterology, Hepatology and Nutrition (BSPGHAN) members with Inflammatory Bowel Disease (IBD) patients <18 years old commencing adalimumab with at least 4 weeks follow-up. Patient demographics and details of treatment were then collected. Response and remission was assessed using the Paediatric Crohn's Disease Activity Index (PCDAI)/Physicians Global Assessment (PGA). RESULTS: Seventy-two patients [70 CD, 1 ulcerative colitis (UC), 1 IBD unclassified (IBDU)] from 19 paediatric-centres received adalimumab at a median age of 14.8 (IQR 3.1, range 6.1-17.8) years; 66/70 CD (94%) had previously received infliximab. A dose of 80 mg then 40 mg was used for induction in 41(59%) and 40 mg fortnightly for maintenance in 61 (90%). Remission rates were 24%, 58% and 41% at 1, 6 and 12 months, respectively. Overall 43 (61%) went into remission at some point, with 24 (35%) requiring escalation of therapy. Remission rates were higher in those on concomitant immunosuppression cf. those not on immunosuppression [34/46 (74%) vs. 9/24 (37%), respectively, (chi(2) 8.8, P=0.003)]. There were 15 adverse events (21%) including four (6%) serious adverse events with two sepsis related deaths in patients who were also on immunosuppression and home parenteral nutrition (3% mortality rate). CONCLUSIONS: Adalimumab is useful in treatment of refractory paediatric patients with a remission rate of 61%. This treatment benefit should be balanced against side effects, including in this study a 3% mortality rate.},

   abstract = {The current paradigm of inflammatory bowel diseases (IBD), both Crohn's disease (CD) and ulcerative colitis (UC), involves the interaction between environmental factors in the intestinal lumen and inappropriate host immune responses in genetically predisposed individuals. The intestinal mucosal barrier has evolved to maintain a delicate balance between absorbing essential nutrients while preventing the entry and responding to harmful contents. In IBD, disruptions of essential elements of the intestinal barrier lead to permeability defects. These barrier defects exacerbate the underlying immune system, subsequently resulting in tissue damage. The epithelial phenotype in active IBD is very similar in CD and UC. It is characterized by increased secretion of chloride and water, leading to diarrhea, increased permeability via both the transcellular and paracellular routes, and increased apoptosis of epithelial cells. The main cytokine that seems to drive these changes is tumor necrosis factor alpha in CD, whereas interleukin (IL)-13 may be more important in UC. Therapeutic restoration of the mucosal barrier would provide protection and prevent antigenic overload due to intestinal "leakiness." Here we give an overview of the key players of the intestinal mucosal barrier and review the current literature from studies in humans and human systems on mechanisms underlying mucosal barrier dysfunction in IBD.},

   abstract = {PURPOSE: Malnutrition is a frequent problem in patients with ulcerative colitis (UC) leading to increased postoperative complication rates. Preoperative total parenteral nutrition (TPN) has been shown to reduce complications in some subgroups of patients, but has not been studied in UC. We investigated the impact of preoperative TPN on postoperative complication rates in patients undergoing surgery for UC. METHODS: This paper is a review of 235 patients who underwent surgery for UC; 56 received preoperative TPN and 179 did not. Postoperative complication rates were compared. RESULTS: Both had similar rates of anastomotic leak (5.4 vs. 2.8 %, p = 0.356), infection (12.5 vs. 20.1 %, p = 0.199), ileus/bowel obstruction (21.4 vs. 15.6 %, p = 0.315), cardiac complications (3.6 vs. 0 %, p = 0.056), wound dehiscence (3.6 vs. 1.7 %, p = 0.595), reoperation (10.7 vs. 3.9 %, p = 0.086), and death (1.8 vs. 0 %, p = 0.238). The TPN group was more malnourished (albumin 2.49 vs. 3.45, p < 0.001), more often on steroids (83.9 vs. 57.5 %, p < 0.001), had more emergent surgery (10.7 vs. 3.4 %, p = 0.029), more severe colitis (89.3 vs. 65.9 %, p = 0.001), and lower Surgical Apgar Score (6.15 vs. 6.57, p = 0.033). After controlling for these with logistic regression, the TPN group still had higher complication rates (OR 2.32, p = 0.04). When line infections were excluded, TPN did not significantly affect outcomes (OR 1.5, p = 0.311) CONCLUSION: There were no differences in postoperative complications when line infections were excluded. Our data does not support routine preoperative TPN in patients with UC. However, it may lead to equal surgical outcomes in the sickest and most malnourished patients at the cost of line-related morbidity.},

   abstract = {PURPOSE: Recent epidemiological studies have shown that habitual consumption of extra virgin olive oil (EVOO), the characteristic culinary fat of the Mediterranean area, is effective in the prevention of diverse types of digestive disorders such as inflammatory bowel disease. Many of these benefits are, in addition to its high proportion of oleic acid, due to the high content of phenolic compounds. METHODS: Six-week-old mice were randomized into three dietary groups: standard, EVOO and hydroxytyrosol-enriched EVOO. After 30 days, mice that were exposed to 3% DSS for 5 days developed acute colitis that progressed to severe chronic inflammation during a regime of 21 days of water. RESULTS: Diets enriched with EVOO significantly attenuated the clinical and histological signs of damage, improving results from disease activity index and reducing about 50% the mortality caused by DSS. Moreover, hydroxytyrosol supplement showed better results. Cytokines study showed that TNF-alpha was maintained near to sham control and IL-10 levels were significantly improved in EVOO and EVOO plus hydroxytyrosol diet-DSS groups. In the same way, COX-2 and iNOS were downregulated, and the activation of p38 MAPK was reduced. We also observed a higher significant reduction in iNOS in hydroxytyrosol-enriched EVOO compared with EVOO alone. CONCLUSIONS: EVOO diets exerted a noteworthy beneficial effect in chronic DSS-induced colitis by cytokine modulation and COX-2 and iNOS reduction via downregulation of p38 MAPK. In addition to the beneficial effect by EVOO, supplementation of the diet with hydroxytyrosol may improve chronic colitis through iNOS downregulation plus its antioxidant capacity.},

   abstract = {BACKGROUND: Children with inflammatory bowel disease (IBD) undergo imaging using ionizing radiation and may be exposed to high cumulative radiation. We hypothesized that children with IBD have high exposure to radiation from medical imaging. METHODS: An Institutional Review Board (IRB)-approved retrospective chart review from 2002-2008 was performed on all patients with IBD. Radiographic studies performed were recorded and exposure for each study was estimated. RESULTS: A total of 117 children with IBD (86 Crohn's disease [CD], 31 ulcerative colitis [UC]) were evaluated. The median current exposure was 15.1 mSv in CD and 7.2 mSv in UC (P = 0.005). Computed tomography (CT) scan and small bowel follow-through (SBFT) were responsible for 43% and 36% of all radiation exposures, respectively. The rate of radiation was higher in CD compared to UC (4.3 versus 2.2 mSv/yr). In CD, the rate of exposure was highest in the first 3 years of diagnosis (8.2 mSv/yr), and no different between the 3-5 year follow-up and 5+ year follow-up groups (3.8 versus 4.3 mSv/yr). Using the annual dose rate in those followed for more than 3 years, an estimated 47 out of 78 (60%) children (40 CD, 7 UC) would exceed 50 mSv by 35 years of age. CONCLUSIONS: Radiation exposure from medical imaging is high in a subset of children diagnosed with IBD. Estimation of radiation exposure at age 35 suggests a significant portion of children with IBD will have high radiation exposure in their lifetime. Nonionizing imaging such as magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) and ultrasound should be offered to children with IBD as an alternative to current imaging that employs radiation.},

   abstract = {OBJECTIVES: The aim of the present study was to review postoperative complications of pediatric patients undergoing colectomy for ulcerative colitis (UC) or inflammatory bowel disease-unspecified (IBD-U) with a focus on preoperative immunosuppression including exposure to infliximab. METHODS: We performed a retrospective chart review of all of the children with UC or IBD-U undergoing colectomy at our institution from 1996 to 2010. Data collected included indication for colectomy, immunosuppressive medications taken within 30 to 90 days of colectomy, surgical techniques and staging, and early and late postoperative complications. RESULTS: A total of 51 patients underwent colectomy (45 UC, 6 IBD-U) (55% male, 63% pancolitis at diagnosis, mean age at diagnosis 10.8 +/- 3.8 years, mean age at colectomy 13.1 +/- 3.8 years). Indications for colectomy were fulminant colitis in 26% and medically refractory chronic disease in 74%. Patient exposure to immunosuppression in the 30 days before colectomy included corticosteroids (88%), thiopurines (51%), and calcineurin inhibitors (4%). Within 90 days before colectomy, 65% of patients were exposed to infliximab. Small bowel obstruction was the most common postoperative complication, occurring in 19% (treated surgically in 30%), followed by wound infection in 8% and intraabdominal abscess in 6%. One patient developed postoperative sepsis. There was no increased incidence of early or late infectious or noninfectious complications in those patients taking or not taking thiopurines or calcineurin inhibitors (within 30 days), or infliximab (within 90 days). CONCLUSIONS: Preoperative exposure to thiopurines or calcineurin inhibitors (within 30 days) or infliximab (within 90 days) was not associated with increased postoperative complications in our cohort undergoing colectomy for UC or IBD-U.},

   abstract = {OBJECTIVES: Low bone mineral density (BMD) is recognized as a potential problem in children with inflammatory bowel disease (IBD). We aimed to describe the longitudinal development of BMD in a population of Swedish pediatric patients with IBD. METHODS: A total of 144 patients with IBD (93 males; 83 with ulcerative colitis [UC], 45 with Crohn disease [CD]) were examined with dual-energy x-ray absorptiometry at baseline. At follow-up 2 years later, 126 of the initial 144 patients were reexamined. BMD values are expressed as z scores. RESULTS: Children with UC and CD had significantly lower mean BMD z scores for the lumbar spine (LS) at baseline and after 2 years. The reduction in BMD was equally pronounced in patients with UC and CD, and neither group improved their z score during the follow-up period. Furthermore, significantly lower mean BMD z scores for the LS were found at baseline in boys (-1.1 SD, +/-2.7 SD, P < 0.001), but not in girls (-0.0 SD, +/-3.0 SD). This finding remained unchanged at follow-up. Subanalyses of the different age groups at baseline showed the lowest BMD values in the group of patients ages 17 to 19 years in boys (mean z score for the LS 1.59 SD, +/-3.1 SD) and in girls (mean z score for the LS -3.40 SD, +/-3.1 SD); however, at follow-up, these patients had improved their BMD significantly (mean change z score for the LS 1.00 SD, 95% CI 0.40-1.60; 1.90 SD, 95% CI 0.60-3.20). CONCLUSIONS: In this longitudinal study, the entire group of pediatric patients with IBD showed permanent decreases in their BMD z scores for the LS; however, our data indicate that afflicted children have the potential to improve their BMD by the time they reach early adulthood.},

   abstract = {Many foods have been implicated in theories about the etiology of inflammatory bowel disease. While evidence has accumulated that nutritional factors as part of overall lifestyle changes may play a role in the growing incidence, no specific dietary recommendations except the promotion of breastfeeding can currently be given to decrease the risk of developing Crohn's disease or ulcerative colitis. For the treatment of Crohn's disease in children and adolescents, however, enteral feeding with a semi-elemental diet seems to be as effective as corticosteroids in inducing and maintaining remission. In the meta-analyses, advantages of one formula over the other are evened out, and more research is warranted into the anti-inflammatory properties of different nutrients, such as polyunsaturated fatty acids, butyrate, glutamine, and cytokines, such as transforming growth factors-beta. Unfortunately, for practical reasons, nutritional therapy remains underutilized, even though pediatric patients are most vulnerable to the harmful effects of nutrient deficiencies on growth, pubertal development, and bone health. There is hope that in the future the new field of nutrigenomics may enable physicians to more accurately tailor a specific diet to the patient genotype.},

   abstract = {To identify Escherichia coli proteins involved in adaptation to intestinal inflammation, mice were monoassociated with the colitogenic E. coli strain UNC or with the probiotic E. coli strain Nissle. Intestinal inflammation was induced by treating the mice with 3.5% dextran sodium sulfate (DSS). Differentially expressed proteins in E. coli strains collected from cecal contents were identified by 2-dimensional difference gel electrophoresis. In both strains, acute inflammation led to the downregulation of pathways involved in carbohydrate breakdown and energy generation. Accordingly, DSS-treated mice had lower concentrations of bacterial fermentation products in their cecal contents than control mice. Differentially expressed proteins also included the Fe-S cluster repair protein NfuA, the tryptophanase TnaA, and the uncharacterized protein YggE. NfuA expression was 3-fold higher in E. coli strains from DSS-treated than from control mice. Reporter experiments confirmed the induction of nfuA in response to iron deprivation, mimicking Fe-S cluster destruction by inflammation. YggE expression, which has been reported to reduce the intracellular level of reactive oxygen species, was 4- to 8-fold higher in E. coli Nissle than in E. coli UNC. This was confirmed by in vitro reporter gene assays indicating that Nissle is better equipped to cope with oxidative stress than UNC. Nissle isolated from DSS-treated and control mice had TnaA levels 4- to 7-fold-higher than those of UNC. Levels of indole resulting from the TnaA reaction were higher in control animals associated with E. coli Nissle. Because of its anti-inflammatory effect, indole is hypothesized to be involved in the extension of the remission phase in ulcerative colitis described for E. coli Nissle.},

CASE PRESENTATION: The patient presented with frequent passage of blood stained stool, abdominal pain and significant weight loss. The diagnosis was entertained after she was investigated for common causes of chronic diarrhea in our setting and the findings were negative. The patient symptoms abated after she was commenced on steroid therapy. CONCLUSION: Under-diagnosis and misdiagnosis may account for a dearth of information on UC in African children.},

Various nutrients were found to be involved, sometimes with controversial results, possibly pertaining to geographic regions.

Identification of specific genetic risk factors has improved the understanding of specific pathways to disease, but the primacy of environmental or lifestyle factors linked to changes in the gut microbiota, particularly in early life, is increasingly evident. Clarification of the molecular basis of host-microbe interactions in health and in susceptible individuals promises novel therapeutic strategies.},

Intestinal healing rather than merely symptom control is an especially important therapeutic goal in young patients, given the potential for growth impairment as a direct effect of persistent chronic inflammation and the long life ahead, during which other disease complications may occur. Corticosteroids achieve rapid symptom control, but alternate steroid-sparing strategies with greater potential to heal the intestine must be rapidly adopted. Exclusive enteral nutrition is an alternate short-term treatment in pediatric Crohn's disease. The results of multi-center pediatric clinical trials of both infliximab and adalimumab in Crohn's disease and of infliximab in ulcerative colitis (all in children with unsatisfactory responses to other therapies) have now been reported and guide treatment regimens in clinical practice. Optimal patient selection and timing of anti-TNF therapy requires clinical judgment. Attention must be paid to sustaining responsiveness safely.},

   abstract = {INTRODUCTION: There are not many studies published in the literature on failure of medical treatment in Ulcerative Colitis (UC) that leads to colectomy. PATIENTS AND METHODS: Retrospective study of patients under 14 years diagnosed with UC from 1984 to 2009, who underwent colectomy due to lack of response to medical treatment. They are divided into urgent or elective surgery. RESULTS: Colectomy performed in 14 paediatric patients (26.9% of total UC patients). Age at diagnosis 7.8+/-4.0 years, 8 of them younger than 10 years and 5 younger than 5 years. All cases diagnosed on patients less than 5 years of age required colectomy in the first 6 months after diagnosis. Elective colectomy was performed on 5/14 and urgent surgery in 9/14. The reported complications were divided into early (first 30 days after colectomy) and late. Pharmacological treatment in cases with urgent colectomy included methylprednisolone (100%), oral tacrolimus (55.5%), oral/intravenous cyclosporine (33.3%) and infliximab (33.3%). Cases of elective colectomy were all in the 1985-1998 period. CONCLUSIONS: The influence of age is a key factor for prognosis. All patients less than 5 year-old ended up with colectomy. The main indication for urgent surgery was lack of response to treatment with intravenous steroids combined with a potent immunomodulator (tacrolimus, cyclosporine, infliximab). All cases of elective colectomy were performed before 1999, when second line medical treatment was very uncommon, making remission unlikely.},

   abstract = {BACKGROUND AND AIMS: Colectomy rates for ulcerative colitis (UC) and data on postcolectomy complications in children are limited. Thus, we assessed colectomy rates, early postcolectomy complications, and clinical predictors in children with UC undergoing a colectomy. METHODS: Children (18 years old or older) with UC who underwent colectomy from 1983 to 2009 were identified (n=30). All of the medical charts were reviewed. The diagnostic accuracy of International Classification of Diseases codes for UC and colectomy were validated. The primary outcome was postoperative complications defined as Clavien-Dindo classification grade II or higher. The yearly incidence of colectomies for pediatric UC was calculated and temporal trends were evaluated. RESULTS: The sensitivity and positive predictive value of UC and colectomy International Classification of Diseases codes were 96% and 100%, respectively. The median ages at UC diagnosis and colectomy were 10.9 and 12.1 years, respectively. All of the children had pancolitis and 63% underwent emergent colectomy. Postoperatively, 33% experienced at least 1 complication. Patients with emergent colectomy were more likely to have a postoperative complication compared with patients with elective colectomy (90% vs 50%; P=0.03). For emergent colectomy, postoperative complications were associated with a disease flare of >/=2 weeks before admission (60% vs 0%; P=0.03) and >2 weeks from admission to colectomy (78% vs 22%; P=0.04). The average annual rate of pediatric colectomy was 0.059/100,000 person-years and stable from 1983 to 2009 (P>0.05). CONCLUSIONS: Colectomy UC was uncommon and rates have remained stable. Postcolectomy complications were common, especially in patients undergoing emergent colectomy. Optimizing timing of colectomy may reduce postoperative complications.},

   abstract = {BACKGROUND & AIMS: Matrix metalloproteases (MMPs) mediate pathogenesis of chronic intestinal inflammation. We characterized the role of the gelatinase (GelE), a metalloprotease from Enterococcus faecalis, in the development of colitis in mice. METHODS: Germ-free, interleukin-10-deficient (IL-10(-/-)) mice were monoassociated with the colitogenic E faecalis strain OG1RF and isogenic, GelE-mutant strains. Barrier function was determined by measuring E-cadherin expression, transepithelial electrical resistance (TER), and translocation of permeability markers in colonic epithelial cells and colon segments from IL-10(-/-) and TNF(DeltaARE/Wt) mice. GelE specificity was shown with the MMP inhibitor marimastat. RESULTS: Histologic analysis (score 0-4) of E faecalis monoassociated IL-10(-/-) mice revealed a significant reduction in colonic tissue inflammation in the absence of bacteria-derived GelE. We identified cleavage sites for GelE in the sequence of recombinant mouse E-cadherin, indicating that it might be degraded by GelE. Experiments with Ussing chambers and purified GelE revealed the loss of barrier function and extracellular E-cadherin in mice susceptible to intestinal inflammation (IL-10(-/-) and TNF(DeltaARE/Wt) mice) before inflammation developed. Colonic epithelial cells had reduced TER and increased translocation of permeability markers after stimulation with GelE from OG1RF or strains of E faecalis isolated from patients with Crohn's disease and ulcerative colitis. CONCLUSIONS: The metalloprotease GelE, produced by commensal strains of E faecalis, contributes to development of chronic intestinal inflammation in mice that are susceptible to intestinal inflammation (IL-10(-/-) and TNF(DeltaARE/Wt) mice) by impairing epithelial barrier integrity.},

   abstract = {BACKGROUND: Osteoprotegerin (OPG) is increased in inflamed colonic mucosa and has a role in immune regulation and apoptosis resistance. Fecal OPG may be useful in predicting corticosteroid resistance in hospitalized children with severe ulcerative colitis (UC). We aimed to determine whether fecal OPG predicts the need for second-line therapies in children hospitalized for UC. METHODS: We included 83 children with UC admitted for intravenous corticosteroid treatment. Children were classified as responders/nonresponders based on the need for therapy escalation. Fecal OPG results were compared with those of four other fecal markers. RESULTS: Of the enrolled children, seven had day 1 samples only, 53 children had day 3 samples only, and 23 had both. Twenty-two children failed corticosteroid therapy and required infliximab (n = 20) or colectomy (n = 2). On the third treatment day the median fecal OPG levels were significantly higher in the nonresponders group compared with the responders: 77 pmol/L (interquartile range [IQR] 27-137) versus 13 pmol/L (3-109); P = 0.007. The best day 3 fecal OPG cutoff to predict second-line therapy was >50 pmol/L with a sensitivity of 71% and specificity of 69% (area under the receiver operator curve [ROC] of 0.70%-95% confidence interval [CI] 0.57-0.82). Fecal OPG was superior to day 3 fecal calprotectin, lactoferrin, and S100A12 as a predictor of corticosteroid nonresponse, but equivalent to the less commonly used M2-pyruvate kinase. CONCLUSIONS: Day 3 fecal OPG may guide the decision to institute second-line therapy in children with severe UC. The role of OPG in the inflammatory response in pediatric UC deserves further study.},

   abstract = {OBJECTIVE: Leukocytapheresis (LCAP) is a nonpharmacologic therapy that has recently been used to treat ulcerative colitis (UC). This multicenter open-label study prospectively assessed the efficacy and safety of LCAP in pediatric patients with UC. PATIENTS AND METHODS: Twenty-three patients ages 8 to 16 years with moderate (n = 19) to severe (n = 4) steroid-resistant UC were enrolled. One of 2 LCAP columns with different volumes (model EX and the half-volume model EI) was selected, according to body weight. LCAP was performed once per week for 5 consecutive weeks. Clinical and laboratory data were collected at predetermined time points. The primary endpoint was decreased stool frequency/hematochezia score, and secondary endpoints were clinical, laboratory, and endoscopic improvements. RESULTS: The stool frequency/hematochezia score decreased significantly from 4.5 +/- 1.2 before treatment to 1.6 +/- 1.9 after the fifth treatment. Clinical parameters, including stool frequency, presence of visible blood, abdominal pain, and body temperature, were significantly improved. Fecal calprotectin decreased significantly. Endoscopic findings evaluated using Matts score also improved (P < 0.01). The steroid dose decreased from 1.1 +/- 0.4 mg/kg before treatment to 0.8 +/- 0.5 mg/kg after treatment. There were no significant differences in changes between the EX and EI columns. The incidence of adverse effects was 61%, although none was serious. The most common adverse effects were decreased hematocrit and hemoglobin concentration. CONCLUSIONS: The present study showed that LCAP was well tolerated in children with UC, mostly moderate, and was as effective as in adults. The types of pediatric patients best suited to LCAP remain to be determined.},

We aimed to formulate guidelines for managing UC in children based on a systematic review (SR) of the literature and a robust consensus process. The present article is a product of a joint effort of the European Crohn's and Colitis Organization (ECCO) and the European Society for Paediatric Gastroenterology, Hepatology, and Nutrition (ESPGHAN). METHODS: A group of 27 experts in pediatric IBD participated in an iterative consensus process including 2 face-to-face meetings, following an open call to ESPGHAN and ECCO members. A list of 23 predefined questions were addressed by working subgroups based on a SR of the literature. RESULTS: A total of 40 formal recommendations and 68 practice points were endorsed with a consensus rate of at least 89% regarding initial evaluation, how to monitor disease activity, the role of endoscopic evaluation, medical and surgical therapy, timing and choice of each medication, the role of combined therapy, and when to stop medications. A management flowchart, based on the Pediatric Ulcerative Colitis Activity Index (PUCAI), is presented. CONCLUSIONS: These guidelines provide clinically useful points to guide the management of UC in children. Taken together, the recommendations offer a standardized protocol that allows effective, timely management and monitoring of the disease course, while acknowledging that each patient is unique.},

   abstract = {BACKGROUND: There has not been an extensive comparison of CRP and ESR in ulcerative colitis (UC), and thus, we aimed to explore their utility in UC. METHODS: Four previously enrolled cohorts of 451 children with UC were utilized, all including laboratory, clinical and endoscopic data. A longitudinal analysis was performed on prospectively collected data of 75 children. Disease activity was captured by both global assessment and pediatric UC activity index (PUCAI). RESULTS: The best thresholds to differentiate quiescent, mild, moderate and severe disease activity, were <23, 23-29, 30-37, >37 mm/h for ESR, and <2.5, 2.5-5, 5.01-9, >9 mg/L for CRP (area under the ROC curves 0.70-0.81). Correlation of endoscopic appearance with CRP and ESR were 0.55 and 0.41, respectively (P<0.001). Both CRP and ESR may be completely normal in 34% and 5-10% of those with mild and moderate-severe disease activity, respectively. Elevated CRP in the presence of normal ESR or vice versa was noted in 32%, 38%, 30% and 17% of those with quiescent, mild, moderate and severe disease activity. Over time, the utility of CRP and ESR in reflecting disease activity remained stable in 70-80% of cases. CONCLUSION: In ~2/3 of children, both CRP and ESR values reflect disease activity to a similar degree and in the remaining, either CRP or ESR may be sufficient, with slight superiority of CRP. CRP is more closely correlated with endoscopic appearance. When either CRP or ESR performs well for a given patient, this is likely to remain so over time. Therefore, it may not be justified to routinely test both ESR and CRP in monitoring disease activity.},

We aimed to formulate guidelines for managing ASC in children based on systematic review of the literature and robust consensus process. This manuscript is a product of a joint effort of the ECCO (European Crohn's and Colitis Organization), the Pediatric Porto Inflammatory Bowel Disease (IBD) Working group of ESPGHAN (European Society of Pediatric Gastroenterology, Hepatology, and Nutrition) and ESPGHAN. METHODS: A group of 19 experts in pediatric IBD participated in an iterative consensus process including two face-to-face meetings. A total of 17 predefined questions were addressed by working subgroups based on a systematic review of the literature. RESULTS: The recommendations and practice points were eventually endorsed with a consensus rate of at least 95% regarding: definitions, initial evaluation, standard therapy, timing of second-line therapy, the role of endoscopic evaluation and heparin prophylaxis, how to administer second-line medical therapy, how to assess response, surgical considerations, and discharge recommendations. A management flowchart is presented based on daily scoring of the Pediatric Ulcerative Colitis Activity Index (PUCAI), along with 28 formal recommendations and 34 practice points. CONCLUSIONS: These guidelines provide clinically useful points to guide the management of ASC in children.

   abstract = {BACKGROUND: Vitamin D deficiency is common in inflammatory bowel disease (IBD). The aim of the study was to determine the prevalence and predictors of vitamin D deficiency in an IBD cohort. It was hypothesized that vitamin D deficiency is associated with increased disease activity and lower health-related quality of life (HRQOL). METHODS: This was a retrospective cohort study. Harvey-Bradshaw index and ulcerative colitis disease activity index were used to assess disease activity. Short Inflammatory Bowel Disease Questionnaire scores were used to assess HRQOL. Multivariate logistic regression was used to identify independent predictors of vitamin D deficiency and its association with disease activity and HRQOL. RESULTS: The study included 504 IBD patients (403 Crohn's disease [CD] and 101 ulcerative colitis [UC]) who had a mean disease duration of 15.5 years in CD patients and 10.9 years in UC patients; 49.8% were vitamin D deficient, with 10.9% having severe deficiency. Vitamin D deficiency was associated with older age (P = .004) and older age at diagnosis (P = .03). Vitamin D deficiency was associated with lower HRQOL (regression coefficient -2.21, 95% confidence interval [CI], -4.10 to -0.33) in CD but not UC (regression coefficient 0.41, 95% CI, -2.91 to 3.73). Vitamin D deficiency was also associated with increased disease activity in CD (regression coefficient 1.07, 95% CI, 0.43 to 1.71). CONCLUSIONS: Vitamin D deficiency is common in IBD and is independently associated with lower HRQOL and greater disease activity in CD. There is a need for prospective studies to assess this correlation and examine the impact of vitamin D supplementation on disease course.},

METHODS: In all, 98 consecutive adult patients (age 25-55 years) with CD (n = 70) and UC (n = 28) were enrolled and assessed at three timepoints over 1 year. RESULTS: There were no significant differences in levels of homocysteine, B vitamins, or dietary intake by disease type, disease activity, or across visits. 13% of all inflammatory bowel disease (IBD) patients had elevated homocysteine at least once during the study. Nine patients with CD had fluctuating homocysteine levels during the study but these were inconsistent, ranging from within normal range to elevated levels in any individual. Six of these nine patients were persistently in remission. 30% of all IBD patients had vitamin B6 deficiency, 11% had vitamin B12 deficiency, and one patient (CD) had folate deficiency. All vitamins showed a significant correlation between intake and serum levels (B6; r = 0.46, P < 0.001, B12; r = 0.42, P < 0.001, and folate; r = 0.26, P = 0.008). There was an inverse relationship between serum homocysteine in the blood and serum vitamin B12 (r = -0.241, P = 0.017). CONCLUSIONS: Serum homocysteine was mostly normal in patients with IBD and changed minimally over time. There was no association between disease activity and elevation of serum homocysteine. 30% of patients have vitamin B6 deficiency but vitamin B6 is not associated with elevated homocysteine. The routine measurement of homocysteine is not warranted.},

   abstract = {BACKGROUND: Teenagers with inflammatory bowel disease undergo regular follow-up visits to watch for symptoms that may indicate relapse. Current disease activity is frequently estimated with the use of the Pediatric Ulcerative Colitis Activity Index (PUCAI) and the Pediatric Crohn's Disease Activity Index (PCDAI). We examined the capacity of fecal calprotectin and C-reactive protein (CRP) to predict relapse in teenagers who report no symptoms. Second, we examined whether calprotectin and CRP as an "add-on test" improve the specificity of PUCAI or PCDAI to predict relapse. METHODS: We collected data of 62 consecutive teenagers (31 with Crohn's disease and 31 with ulcerative colitis) who scored their degree of disease control between 90 and 100% on two successive outpatient clinic visits. Calprotectin, PUCAI or PCDAI, and CRP were measured at baseline. Primary outcome was symptomatic relapse within 3 months of baseline, necessitating the introduction of steroids, exclusive enteral nutrition, or an aminosalicylate dose escalation. RESULTS: Fifteen teenagers (24%) developed symptomatic relapse within 3 months of baseline. Based on the receiver operating characteristic curve, the optimum calprotectin cutpoint to differentiate high from low risk patients was 500 mug/g. The PUCAI or PCDAI predicted relapse in 42% (11/26) of teenagers with a positive result (score >/= 10 points), while a negative PUCAI or PCDAI result reduced the risk of relapse to 11% (4/36). Teenagers with a positive calprotectin test had a 53% (10/19) risk of progressing to symptomatic relapse within 3 months, whereas a negative calprotectin result gave a 12% (5/43) risk of symptomatic relapse. A positive CRP result (cutoff 10 mg/L) gave a 50% (4/8) risk of relapse, whereas a negative CRP result hardly reduced the risk compared with the pretest probability (from 24% to 21% (11/53)). As an add-on test after PUCAI or PCDAI, the calprotectin test limited the number of false positives and thus increased the specificity to detect gastrointestinal inflammation: 60% (9/15) of teenagers with positive concordant test results progressed to symptomatic relapse. Negative concordance reduced the risk of relapse to 10% (3/32). CRP contributed little as add-on test after PUCAI or PCDAI: two of five teenagers with positive concordant tests progressed to symptomatic relapse (40%). CONCLUSIONS: Unlike CRP, fecal calprotectin as an add-on test after PUCAI or PCDAI facilitates recognition of preclinical relapse. This could help to identify teenagers who require treatment intensification at the time of minimal disease rather than at the time of clinically overt relapse. Further studies are warranted to determine the impact of fecal calprotectin testing on treatment management and outcome.},

   abstract = {OBJECTIVE: Anti-neutrophil cytoplasmic antibodies and anti-Saccharomyces cerevisiae mannan antibodies (ASCAs) have been detected in the serum of patients with ulcerative colitis (UC) and Crohn's disease (CD) and their unaffected family members. The aim of this study was to establish the value of serological markers as predictors of UC and CD. DESIGN: Individuals who developed CD or UC were identified from the European Prospective Investigation into Cancer and Nutrition (EPIC) study. At recruitment, none of the participants had a diagnosis of CD or UC. For each incident case, two controls were randomly selected matched for centre, date of birth, sex, date of recruitment and time of follow-up. Serum of cases and controls obtained at recruitment were analysed for ASCA IgG, ASCA IgA, perinuclear anti-neutrophil cytoplasmic antibody (pANCA), antibodies against Escherichia coli outer membrane porin C (OmpC) and flagellin CBir1. Conditional logistic regression was used to determine risk of CD and UC. Receiver operating characteristic curves were constructed to test accuracy. RESULTS: A total of 77 individuals were diagnosed with CD and 167 with UC after a mean follow-up of 4.5 (SD 3.2) and 4.4 (SD 3.1) years following blood collection, respectively. Combinations of pANCA, ASCA, anti-CBir1 and anti-OmpC were most accurate in predicting incident CD and UC (area under curve 0.679 and 0.657, respectively). The predictive value of the combination of markers increased when time to diagnosis of CD or UC decreased. CONCLUSION: A panel of serological markers is able to predict development of CD and UC in individuals from a low-risk population.},

METHODS: The iterative process included multiphase qualitative methods. A literature review of GI disorders was conducted to generate domains for the focus interviews. Six pediatric gastroenterologists with extensive clinical experience in GI disorders provided expert opinion regarding the conceptual framework. A total of 98 participants, 46 pediatric patients ages 5 to 18, and 52 parents of patients ages 2 to 18 with physician-diagnosed GI disorders (chronic constipation, functional abdominal pain, irritable bowel syndrome, inflammatory bowel disease [Crohn disease, ulcerative colitis], gastroesophageal reflux disease), participated in the focus interviews and cognitive interviewing phases, including think-aloud and cognitive debriefing protocols. RESULTS: Eleven domains were derived from the qualitative methods involving patient and parent interviews and expert opinion, with content saturation achieved, resulting in 76 items. The 11 domains consisted of items measuring stomach pain, stomach upset, food and drink limits, trouble swallowing, heartburn and reflux, gas and bloating, constipation, diarrhea, worry, medicines, and communication. CONCLUSIONS: Qualitative methods involving pediatric patients and their parents in the item generation process support the content validity for the new PedsQL Gastrointestinal Symptoms Module. The PedsQL Gastrointestinal Symptoms Module is undergoing national multisite field testing as the next iterative phase.},

   abstract = {OBJECTIVE: High-fat diets have been shown to be a risk factor for ulcerative colitis (UC). Omega-6 polyunsaturated fatty acids are considered to increase lipid peroxidation, while the omega-3 polyunsaturated fatty acid exerts a chemopreventative effect. We evaluated the effect of high-fat diets (20%) enriched with fish or soybean oil on colonic inflammation and DNA damage in dextran sulfate sodium-induced colitis. METHODS: Male Wistar rats (28-30 days) were fed an American Institute of Nutrition (AIN)-93 diet for 47 days and divided into five groups: control normal fat non-colitic (C) or control colitis (CC), high soybean fat group (HS) colitis, high fish fat group colitis, or high-fat soybean plus fish oil colitis. UC was induced from day 35 until day 41 by 3% dextran sulfate sodium. On day 47, the rats were anesthetized; blood samples collected for corticosterone determination, and the distal colon was excised to quantify interleukin-4 (IL-4), IL-10, and interferon-gamma levels, myeloperoxidase activity, histological analyses, and DNA damage. The disease activity index was recorded daily. RESULTS: The disease activity index, histological analysis, myeloperoxidase activity, IL-4, interferon-gamma, and corticosterone levels did not differ among the colitic groups. IL-10 was significantly increased by the high fish fat group diet in relation to HS, but only the high soybean-fish fat diet increased the IL-10/IL-4 ratio (anti-inflammatory/pro-inflammatory) to levels closer to the C group and reduced DNA damage compared to the HS group (P<0.05). CONCLUSION: The data show that high-fat diets did not exacerbate UC and suggest that the soybean and fish oil mixture, more than the fish oil alone, could be a complementary therapy to achieve a cytokine balance in UC.},

   abstract = {Butyrate is a four-carbon short-chain fatty acid that improves colonic trophism. Although several studies have shown the benefits of butyrate enemas in ulcerative colitis (UC), studies using the oral route are rare in the literature. In the present study, we evaluated the effect of butyrate intake in the immune response associated to UC. For that, mice were fed control or butyrate (0.5% sodium butyrate) diets for 14 days. Acute UC was induced by dextran sulphate sodium (DSS, 2.5%), replacing drinking water. The results showed that, in UC animals, oral butyrate significantly improved trophism and reduced leukocyte (eosinophil and neutrophil) infiltration in the colon mucosa and improved the inflammatory profile (activated macrophage, B and T lymphocytes) in cecal lymph nodes. In the small intestine, although mucosa histology was similar among groups, DSS treatment reduced duodenal transforming growth factor-beta, increased interleukin-10 concentrations and increased memory T lymphocytes and dendritic cells in Peyer's patches. Butyrate supplementation was able to revert these alterations. When cecal butyrate concentration was analyzed in cecal content, it was still higher in the healthy animals receiving butyrate than in the UC+butyrate and control groups. In conclusion, our results show that oral administration of sodium butyrate improves mucosa lesion and attenuates the inflammatory profile of intestinal mucosa, local draining lymph nodes and Peyer's patches of DSS-induced UC. Our results also highlight the potential use of butyrate supplements as adjuvant in UC treatment.},

   abstract = {BACKGROUND AND AIM: Exclusive enteral nutrition (EEN) is an effective method of treatment in achieving remission in inflammatory bowel disease (IBD); however, its mechanism of action is still poorly understood. The objective of our study was to assess the influence of EEN on serum vascular endothelial growth factor (VEGF) and transforming growth factor-beta 1 (TGF-beta1) in children and adolescents with IBD. PATIENTS AND METHODS: Thirty-nine children and adolescents with IBD (24 with Crohn disease [CD] and 15 with ulcerative colitis [UC]) and 25 healthy controls were enrolled in the study. VEGF and TGF-beta1 were assessed at the baseline and after 2 and 4 weeks of EEN in CD and UC groups and once in controls using enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay immunoassays. RESULTS: At the baseline, we found increased serum VEGF in the CD versus UC group and controls (P < 0.05) and serum TGF-beta1 in the UC versus CD group and controls (P < 0.05). During EEN, VEGF decreased in the UC and CD groups, whereas TGF-beta1 increased in the CD group and decreased in the UC group. The CD group achieved disease remission faster than the UC group, and the weight gain of patients with CD during EEN was higher compared with patients with UC. Additionally, TGF-beta1 concentration correlated with protein and energies daily intake in the CD group (R = 0.95; P < 0.05). CONCLUSIONS: Different effectiveness of EEN in achieving remission in CD and UC may result from a modification of growth factor production. EEN stimulated TGF-beta1 production in CD but not in UC, which possibly resulted in higher effectiveness of EEN in this group of patients.},

   abstract = {BACKGROUND: Methotrexate (MTX) is used as an alternative immunosuppressive treatment for patients with inflammatory bowel disease (IBD). The aim of the study was to evaluate effectiveness and tolerance of MTX for children with IBD. METHODS: A retrospective study was conducted in our pediatric IBD center of all children having received MTX for the treatment of their IBD between 2000 and 2008. Remission was defined as discontinuation of steroids and Harvey-Bradshaw Index <4 for Crohn's disease (CD) patients or Pediatric Ulcerative Colitis Activity Index (PUCAI) <10 for ulcerative (UC) or indeterminate colitis (IC) patients. RESULTS: Seventy-five patients had CD, 5 UC, and 13 IC. Mean age at diagnosis was 11 (0.6-17.4) years. Ninety patients were previously treated with purine analogs and 26 with anti-tumor necrosis factor (TNF). Among patients assessed for effectiveness of MTX (n = 79), clinical remission was observed in 29, 37, 25, and 16% of CD patients (n = 63) and 19, 25, 13, and 7% of patients with UC or IC (n = 16), respectively, 3, 6,12, and 24 months after initiation of MTX. The 1-year remission rate for CD patients was significantly higher in patients with colonic disease. Forty-six patients (49%) experienced side effects but only 13 (14%) had to discontinue treatment. CONCLUSIONS: The long-term remission rate with MTX in our pediatric IBD population was low. However, MTX was generally well tolerated and induced and maintained remission in some patients who previously had failed a purine analog and/or anti-TNF. Prospective controlled trials are indicated to determine the place of MTX in the management of pediatric IBD.},

   abstract = {It is generally accepted that carbohydrate fermentation results in beneficial effects for the host because of the generation of short chain fatty acids, whereas protein fermentation is considered detrimental for the host's health. Protein fermentation mainly occurs in the distal colon, when carbohydrates get depleted and results in the production of potentially toxic metabolites such as ammonia, amines, phenols and sulfides. However, the effectivity of these metabolites has been established mainly in in vitro studies. In addition, some important bowel diseases such as colorectal cancer (CRC) and ulcerative colitis appear most often in the distal colon, which is the primary site of protein fermentation. Finally, epidemiological studies revealed that diets rich in meat are associated with the prevalence of CRC, as is the case in Western society. Importantly, meat intake not only increases fermentation of proteins but also induces increased intake of fat, heme and heterocyclic amines, which may also play a role in the development of CRC. Despite these indications, the relationship between gut health and protein fermentation has not been thoroughly investigated. In this review, the existing evidence about the potential toxicity of protein fermentation from in vitro animal and human studies will be summarized.},

   abstract = {BACKGROUND: There has been increasing interest in the use of nutrition risk assessment tools in paediatrics to identify those who need nutrition support. Four non-disease specific screening tools have been developed, although there is a paucity of data on their application in clinical practice and the degree of inter-tool agreement. METHODS: The concurrent validity of four nutrition screening tools [Screening Tool for the Assessment of Malnutrition in Paediatrics (STAMP), Screening Tool for Risk On Nutritional status and Growth (STRONGkids), Paediatric Yorkhill Malnutrition Score (PYMS) and Simple Paediatric Nutrition Risk Score (PNRS)] was examined in 46 children with inflammatory bowel disease. Degree of malnutrition was determined by anthropometry alone using World Health Organization International Classification of Diseases (ICD-10) criteria. RESULTS: There was good agreement between STAMP, STRONGkids and PNRS (kappa > 0.6) but there was only modest agreement between PYMS and the other scores (kappa = 0.3). No children scored low risk with STAMP, STRONGkids or PNRS; however, 23 children scored low risk with PYMS. There was no agreement between the risk tools and the degree of malnutrition based on anthropometric data (kappa < 0.1). Three children had anthropometry consistent with malnutrition and these were all scored high risk. Four children had body mass index SD scores < -2, one of which was scored at low nutrition risk. CONCLUSIONS: The relevance of nutrition screening tools for children with chronic disease is unclear. In addition, there is the potential to under recognise nutritional impairment (and therefore nutritional risk) in children with inflammatory bowel disease.},

   abstract = {BACKGROUND & AIMS: Little is known about the impact of disease and treatment on the pattern of growth in children with Inflammatory Bowel Disease (IBD). Significant deficits in height and weight in children with Crohn's disease have been reported but changes in fat and fat free mass are less well defined. This study aims to describe the height, weight and body composition of a cohort of children with IBD. METHODS: Height, weight, skinfold thicknesses and bioelectrical impedance analysis was performed. Disease activity was assessed with clinical scoring systems. RESULTS: 55 children, median age 13.7 years (range 6.5-17.7) were studied. Median (25th, 75th percentile) Standard Deviation Score for BMI, Height and Weight were - 0.3 (- 0.97, 0.65), - 0.56 (- 1.42, 0.06), - 0.62 (- 1.43, 0.19). In Crohn's disease, using multiple regression analysis disease activity measured by PCDAI was significantly inversely related to fat free mass (beta - 0.2, 95% CI -0.17, -0.03, p 0.005). CONCLUSIONS: Children with IBD were both under and overweight. Nutritional deficits were more common in Crohn's disease. Fat free mass was related to disease activity in children with Crohn's disease regardless of changes in weight. Weight or BMI may mask deficits in lean tissue in the presence of normal or increased proportions of body fat.},

   abstract = {Various genes that may influence the intestinal barrier have been identified, including MAGI2, PARD3, and MYO9B. These genes are associated with inflammatory bowel disease (IBD) in several European studies. A total of 2,049 individuals (656 Crohn's disease [CD], 544 ulcerative colitis [UC], and 849 controls) were genotyped and association studies were performed for 1 single nucleotide polymorphism (SNP) in MAGI2, 1 SNP in PARD3, and 6 SNPs in MYO9B. We reported an association between 3 SNPs in MYO9B and ileal involvement with rs1457092 as the most significant SNP (p = 0.0073, odds ratio [OR] 0.69 [95% confidence interval (95% CI) 0.52-0.90]). The nonsynonymous SNP rs1545620 exhibited a p value of 0.014, OR 0.72 (95% CI 0.55-0.93). MYO9B was not associated with UC. MAGI2 or PARD3 was not associated with IBD. A 6-SNP haplotype block in MYO9B demonstrated association with CD and ileal CD (p = 0.0030 and 0.0065, respectively). These data demonstrate an association of MYO9B with ileal CD; however, there was no association of MAGI2 and PARD3 with IBD. Because the direction of association of MYO9B in this Canadian study was not consistent with European studies, further studies are needed to elucidate the role of MYO9B in IBD.},

   abstract = {Ulcerative colitis (UC) is an inflammatory bowel disease (IBD) of unknown etiology. Interleukin (IL)-19 belongs to the IL-10 family and is a potent immunomodulatory cytokine, with implications for pathogenesis in IBD. No previous studies have reported this novel association between UC and IL-19 polymorphisms. In the present work, the role of IL-19 gene polymorphisms as susceptibility markers for UC was evaluated. Three polymorphisms of IL-19 gene (rs2243188, rs2243191, and rs2243193) were genotyped by 5' exonuclease TaqMan genotyping assays on an ABI Prism 7900 HT Fast Real-Time PCR System in a group of 200 Mexican Mestizo patients with UC and 698 healthy unrelated individuals with no family history of UC. The rs2243191 polymorphism significantly deviated from Hardy-Weinberg equilibrium (HWE) (p < 0.05) and consequently was not included in the analysis. Although genotypes AA (rs2243188) and AA (rs2243193) were significant decreased in UC patients as compared with healthy controls (p(c) = 0.018 and p(c) = 0.006, respectively), a genetic additive effect for the alleles was not observed (Cochran-Armitage trend test, not significant). In the subgroup analysis, no differences were found between the IL-19 genotypes and the clinical characteristics of UC. The results suggest that IL-19 polymorphisms (rs2243188 and rs2243193) might have a protective role in the development of UC in Mexican individuals.},

   abstract = {BACKGROUND: Ulcerative Colitis (UC) is a chronic inflammatory bowel disease characterized by diffuse inflammation of the mucosa of the colon. Up to now, diverse observational studies have implicated a wide variety of pathogenic microorganisms as causal and exacerbating factors in UC. Clostridium difficile (C. difficile) infection has been associated with recurrence and treatment failure and its incidence in patients with UC has been on the rise in the last few years. AIMS: To determine the frequency of infection by different microorganisms in Mexican UC patients. PATIENTS AND METHODS: A total of 150 patients with definitive UC diagnosis were studied. All the stool tests for parasites and ova, stool cultures, tests for the C. difficile toxins A and B, and immunohistochemistry for Cytomegalovirus in colon segment biopsies were analyzed. Other demographic and clinical variables of the disease were recorded for their correlation with infection frequency. RESULTS: Infection frequency in UC patients was 28.00%. C. difficile infection was present in 0.013%. Other pathogens were found, such as Endolimax nana (9.00%), Entamoeba histolytica (3.00%), Cytomegalovirus (2.00%), Salmonella (2.00%), Shigella (0.70%), Toxoplasma gondii (0.70%) and Iodamoeba butschlii (0.70%). CONCLUSIONS: Infection frequency was 28.00% in our study and C. difficile infection represented only 0.013%.},

Among cytokines induced in UC, interleukin 1 antagonist (IL-1ra) and interleukin 1 beta (IL-1beta) seems to have a central role because of its immunoregulatory and proinflammatory activities. GOAL: To determine the association between IL-1RA and IL-1B gene polymorphisms and the clinical features of UC in the Mexican Mestizo population. STUDY: Five polymorphisms in the IL-1 gene cluster members IL-1B (rs16944), IL1F10 (rs3811058), and IL-1RN (rs419598, rs315952, and rs315951) were genotyped by 5' exonuclease TaqMan genotyping assays in a group of 200 Mexican patients with UC and 248 ethnically matched unrelated healthy controls. RESULTS: We found a significant increased frequencies of IL-1RN6/1 TC (rs315952) and RN6/2 CC (rs315951) and decreased frequency of IL-1B-511 TC (rs16944) genotypes in UC patients as compared with healthy controls. In the subgroup analysis, we found a significant association between the RN6/2 GG (rs315951) and IL-1B-511 CC (rs16944) genotypes and the presence of steroid-dependence in UC patients (pC=00001, OR=15.6 and pC=0.008, OR=4.09, respectively). Patients with UC showed increased frequencies of IL-1RN "CTC" and "TCG" haplotypes when compared with healthy controls (P=0.019, OR=1.43 and P<10(-7), OR=2.63, respectively). Two haplotypes (TTG and CTG) showed decreased frequency in patients when compared with healthy controls (P=9x10(-7), OR=0.11 and P=8x10(-6), OR=0.11, respectively). CONCLUSIONS: IL-1 RN and IL-1B polymorphisms were associated with the genetic susceptibility to develop UC and might be associated with the presence of steroid-dependence in UC patients.},

   abstract = {The human gastrointestinal tract harbors a complex and abundant microbial community reaching as high as 10(13)-10(14) microorganisms in the colon. This endogenous microbiota forms a symbiotic relationship with their eukaryotic host and this close partnership helps maintain homeostasis by performing essential and non-redundant tasks (e.g. nutrition/energy and, immune system balance, pathogen exclusion). Although this relationship is essential and beneficial to the host, various events (e.g. infection, diet, stress, inflammation) may impact microbial composition, leading to the formation of a dysbiotic microbiota, further impacting on health and disease states. For example, Crohn's disease and ulcerative colitis, collectively termed inflammatory bowel diseases (IBD), have been associated with the establishment of a dysbiotic microbiota. In addition, extra-intestinal disorders such as obesity and metabolic syndrome are also associated with the development of a dysbiotic microbiota. Consequently, there is an increasing interest in harnessing the power of the microbiome and modulating its composition as a means to alleviate intestinal pathologies/disorders and maintain health status. In this review, we will discuss the emerging relationship between the microbiota and development of colorectal cancer as well as present evidence that microbial manipulation (probiotic, prebiotic) impacts disease development.},
