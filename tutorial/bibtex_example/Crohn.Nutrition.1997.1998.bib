   abstract = {A 47-year-old woman with seronegative polyarthritis, diarrhea, and photosensitivity dermatitis was found to have Crohn's disease and pellagra. The presence of high values of 5-hydroxyindolacetic acid in the urine began the exhaustive investigations and finally enterotomy. No mass lesion was found. Argyrophilic cells were not increased in areas of inflamed intestinal mucosa or the normal mucosa. The disagreement between biochemical and histologic findings was attributed to sampling error. Antiinflammatory treatment for Crohn's disease was given and the gastrointestinal and articular symptoms improved, excretion of 5-hydroxyindolacetic acid returned to normal and there was no relapse of pellagra. Pellagra as a complication of Crohn's disease has been described in 4 cases; malnutrition and intestinal malabsorption were the proposed mechanisms for the niacin deficiency and pellagra of those patients. In the current case, the pathogenesis of pellagra may be accounted to wastage of tryptophan by an increased pool of intestinal argyrophilic cells, suggested by increased urinary excretion of 5-hydroxyindolacetic acid.},

   abstract = {BACKGROUND: The etiology of inflammatory bowel disease is unclear, and the role played by anxiety and depression is highly controversial. Anxiety and depression in patients with inflammatory bowel disease could be secondary to disabling symptoms, but the interaction between physical morbidity and psychologic illness in these subjects has not been sufficiently investigated. Patients with inflammatory bowel disease are nevertheless frequently undernourished, but there are no studies on the association between anxiety and depression and malnutrition. This study was designed to characterize anxiety and depression in subjects affected by inflammatory bowel disease and to establish the influence of physical morbidity and/or nutritional status on psychologic disorders. METHODS: Seventy-nine consecutive patients, 43 with Crohn's disease (CD) and 36 with ulcerative colitis (UC), were enrolled in the study. An index of the disease activity and physical morbidity was obtained by the simplified Crohn's Disease Activity Index and Truelove-Witts criteria and using the Clinical Rating Scale. Thirty-six healthy volunteers were studied as controls. All the subjects were given the State and Trait Anxiety Inventory (STAI) test and the Zung self-rating Depression Scale. RESULTS: The percentage of subjects with state anxiety was significantly higher in the CD (P < 0.001) and UC (P < 0.001) groups than in control subjects. There was no significant difference in trait anxiety among groups. The percentage of subjects with depression was significantly higher in the CD (P < 0.05) and UC (P < 0.05) groups than in control subjects. State anxiety and depression were significantly associated with physical morbidity and correlated with malnutrition in CD and UC patients. CONCLUSION: Anxiety and depression in patients with inflammatory bowel disease could be reactive to the disabling symptoms and to malnutrition. As measured with the STAI, personality trait of anxiety does not seem to play an important role in inflammatory bowel disease.},

   abstract = {BACKGROUND: Malnutrition and growth retardation are common complications of Crohn's disease in children. The contribution of resting energy expenditure (REE) to malnutrition is unclear. AIMS: To characterise the REE and body composition in children with Crohn's disease and compare them with normal controls and patients with anorexia nervosa; to compare the effects of prednisolone and enteral nutrition on energy expenditure and body composition. SUBJECTS: Twenty four children with Crohn's disease, 19 malnourished females with anorexia nervosa, and 22 healthy control subjects were studied. METHODS: In children with Crohn's disease measurements were done when the disease was acute and repeated at one and three months after treatment with either prednisolone or enteral nutrition. Resting energy expenditure was measured by indirect calorimetry and body composition by anthropometry, bioelectrical impedance analysis, total body potassium, H218O, and bromide space studies. RESULTS: Body weight and ideal body weight were significantly lower in patients with Crohn's disease than in healthy controls. Lean tissue was depleted and there was an increase in extracellular water. Per unit of lean body mass, there was no difference between REE in patients with Crohn's disease and controls, whereas patients with anorexia nervosa had significantly reduced REE. With enteral nutrition all body compartments and REE increased significantly (p < 0.001). In a subgroup of age-matched men there was a significant increase in height after three months of enteral nutrition compared with prednisolone (p < 0.01). Those treated with steroids did not show a significant change in height but did show an increase in all body compartments. However, intracellular water as well as lean body mass accretion were significantly higher in the enteral nutrition group than in the prednisolone group. CONCLUSIONS: Despite being malnourished, children with Crohn's disease fail to adapt their REE per unit of lean body mass. This might be a factor contributing to their malnutrition. Lean tissue accretion is higher in patients treated with enteral nutrition than in those treated with prednisolone.},

   abstract = {Mycoplasmas are most unusual self-replicating bacteria, possessing very small genomes, lacking cell wall components, requiring cholesterol for membrane function and growth, using UGA codon for tryptophan, passing through "bacterial-retaining" filters, and displaying genetic economy that requires a strict dependence on the host for nutrients and refuge. In addition, many of the mycoplasmas pathogenic for humans and animals possess extraordinary specialized tip organelles that mediate their intimate interaction with eucaryotic cells. This host-adapted survival is achieved through surface parasitism of target cells, acquisition of essential biosynthetic precursors, and in some cases, subsequent entry and survival intracellularly. Misconceptions concerning the role of mycoplasmas in disease pathogenesis can be directly attributed to their biological subtleties and to fundamental deficits in understanding their virulence capabilities. In this review, we highlight the biology and pathogenesis of these procaryotes and provide new evidence that may lead to increased appreciation of their role as human pathogens.},

   abstract = {Enteral diets, both elemental and, more recently, polymeric (whole protein), are used as primary therapy in Crohn's disease and can induce disease remission without the concomitant use of immunosuppressive drugs. Controlled trials comparing enteral nutrition with corticosteroid therapy have given mixed results but suggest, at least in children, that they are as effective as corticosteroids in inducing remission. There is no clear consensus as to which dietary therapy is best. Elemental diets do not seem to be superior to polymeric whole protein-based diets, although further work is necessary. The effect of enteral diets does not seem to be related to the site of intestinal inflammation. Enteral nutrition is particularly appropriate in children and adolescents with Crohn's disease, improving nutrition and promoting growth and pubertal development, and avoiding the systemic toxicity of corticosteroid therapy. Most centers will use it as a first line of treatment. Supplementary enteral nutrition after primary therapy and remission induction may be associated with the prolongation of remission and promotion of linear growth. Pathways by which enteral diets may affect mucosal inflammation are discussed. Enteral diets may inhibit intestinal immune responses by reducing the number of cytokine-producing cells. Enteral nutrition may also boost immunosuppressive pathways, which then endogenously suppress ongoing inflammation. Enteral diets may promote epithelial healing and reepithelialization of Crohn's ulcers and may also reduce the bacterial load in the small bowel.},

   abstract = {OBJECTIVE: Abnormal linear growth is common in childhood and adolescent Crohn's disease. We have studied the concentrations of the inflammatory marker CRP and of serum IGF-I and IGFBP-3 in patients with active Crohn's disease and have assessed the changes in these parameters during therapeutic intervention with enteral nutrition or intestinal resection. DESIGN: Children and adolescents attending the inflammatory bowel disease clinic at our hospital underwent treatment either with enteral nutrition (Study A) or intestinal resection (Study B). These are two separate studies and the results cannot be compared. Serum concentrations of CRP, IGF-I and IGFBP-3 were determined at 0, 2, 8 and 16 weeks after start of enteral nutrition and in addition to height velocity, at 0 and 6 months after intestinal resection. SUBJECTS: Study A: 14 patients, 9 male, 5 female, median age 12.5 years (range 7.0-17.2), puberty stage 1 (n = 13), stage 3 (n = 1). All had active Crohn's disease. Study B: 9 patients, 7 male, 2 female, median age 13.5 years (range 7.8-16.5), puberty stage 1 (n = 5), stages 2-4 (n = 4). All had Crohn's disease resistant to medical therapy. METHODS: Crohn's disease was confirmed radiologically, endoscopically and histologically. Disease activity was scored using the Lloyd Still index (LSI). Study A: nutritional support was with a polymeric, casein-based formula feed AL 110. Study B: surgical procedures were small bowel resection (n = 2), right hemicolectomy (n = 5), subtotal colectomy (n = 2). MEASUREMENTS: Study A: weight SDS, CRP, IGF-1 and IGFBP-3 were measured at 0, 2, 8, 16 weeks after start of enteral feeding. Study B: height velocity, CRP, IGF-I and IGFBP-3 were measured 0, 6 months after intestinal resection. STATISTICAL ANALYSIS: Medians and ranges were used. Significance of changes was calculated using the Wilcoxon rank test for the analysis of paired data. RESULTS: Study A: median LSI before treatment was 39 and increased after 8 weeks of enteral nutrition to 60 (P < 0.05). Weight SDS increased at 8 and 16 weeks (P < 0.05) compared to pretreatment. CRP was elevated at 0 weeks, falling during treatment. Median (range) values (normal < 5 mg/l) at 0 at 2, 8, 16 weeks were 53 mg/l (15-150), 8 mg/l (5-25), 7 mg/l (5-83) and 14 mg/l (5-39), all P < 0.001 compared with pretreatment. Median IGF-I-values increased during treatment. Median (range) values at 0, 2, 8, 16 weeks (all P < 0.005) compared to pretreatment, median (range) values at 0, 2, 8, 16 weeks were 78 micrograms/l (50-204), 131 micrograms/l (73-251), 119 micrograms/l (77-291) and 133 micrograms/l (67-497), all P < 0.005 compared to pre-treatment. IGFBP-3 levels increased during treatment. Median (range) values at 0, 2, 8, 16 weeks were 2.4 mg/l (1.4-3.1), 2.9 mg/l (1.8-4.6), 3.0 mg/l, 3.2 mg/l (1.8-4.5), all P < 0.01 compared to pretreatment. Study B: height velocity increased during 6 months after surgery. Median (range) values; 3.3 cm/year (0-8.3) before surgery, 8.4 cm/year (2-12.6) 6 months post-surgery, P < 0.01. Median (range) CRP values fell from 45 mg/l (5-150) to 8 mg/l (5-31) and IGF-I-values increased from 163 micrograms/l (64-286) to 226 micrograms/l (71-391). These changes were not statistically significant. IGFBP-3 values did not change. CONCLUSION: The IGF system, as shown by serum IGF-I and IGFBP-3, is responsive to therapeutic intervention in active Crohn's disease. It is likely that a combination of decreased inflammatory activity and improved nutrition contributes to these changes.},

PATIENTS: Forty-three children (47%) with Crohn's disease developed PAL in a retrospective study of 92 patients ranging in age from 4 to 20 years. RESULTS: PAL occurred at the mean age of 11.4 +/- 0.7 years, prior to diagnosis in 25% or subsequently in 21%. PAL were severe: complex fistulae (15%), rectovaginal fistulae (2%), anal raggedness (13%); moderate: subcutaneous fistulae (11%), abscesses (19%), cavitating ulcers (9.5%) and stricture formations (5.7%); or mild: eczema (6.7%), fissures (57%) and skin tags (17%). An association with these various features has been observed in 31%. The extent of involvement of the gastrointestinal tract was rectosigmoid (72%), ileal and colonic (41%), ileal with pancolitis (12%). Two PAL course profiles were observed: one with exacerbation and remissions (52%), the other without remission (48%), especially anal raggedness (100%), cavitating ulcers (80%) and skin tags (61%). Medical treatment included steroids (54%), metronidazole (53%), salicylates (51%), nutritional support (44%), azathioprine (17%). PAL healed in 41%. Surgical treatment was performed in 27% with 83% of healing. Relapses occurred in 35% after medical treatment and 86% after surgery.},

   abstract = {BACKGROUND: Rantes (regulated upon activation, normal T cell expressed and secreted) is a chemotactic cytokine for memory T lymphocytes, monocytes, and eosinophils. The cytokine interferon-gamma (IFN-gamma) plays a key in the immune response. Their distributions and possible roles in the selective accumulation of inflammatory cells in Crohn's disease (CD) were examined by determining the expression of Rantes and IFN-gamma genes in patients with CD using in situ hybridization (ISH) on frozen and paraffin-embedded tissue sections. METHODS: Intestinal and mesenteric lymph node samples from 9 children who had undergone ileal resection for CD were examined for the presence of epithelioid-giant cell granulomas (EGCG) and Rantes and IFN-gamma messenger RNA (mRNA). Normal pediatric intestine (n = 5) and lymph nodes (n = 2) served as controls. RESULTS: Many cells in all CD specimens in the epithelial compartment, lamina propria, and the EGCG gave positive signal with the Rantes antisense probe. Labelled cells were identified on paraffin sections as lymphocytes, macrophages, and epithelioid cells. There were Rantes-positive cells in the control intestinal tissues, but many Rantes-positive cells in control lymph nodes that showed follicular hyperplasia. IFN-gamma-positive cells were present in all CD ileal and lymph node specimens, predominantly in close contact with EGCC. No positive signal was obtained with the Rantes and IFN-gamma sense control probes. CONCLUSIONS: These findings suggest that Rantes and IFN-gamma contribute to the selective accumulation of macrophages and memory T helper lymphocytes inside the granulomas and inflammatory infiltrates that are characteristic of CD.},

   abstract = {BACKGROUND: Osteoporosis has been reported in adult patients with inflammatory bowel disease. AIMS: To evaluate bone mineral density (BMD), nutritional status, and determinants of BMD in children with inflammatory bowel disease. PATIENTS: Fifty five patients (34 boys and 21 girls, age range 4-18) were studied; 22 had Crohn's disease and 33 ulcerative colitis. METHODS: Lumbar spine and total body BMD, and body composition were assessed by dual energy x ray absorptiometry (DXA). Results were expressed as standard deviation scores (SDS). Lean body mass was also assessed by bioelectrical impedance analysis (BIA). Yearly measurements during two years were performed in 21 patients. RESULTS: The mean SDS of lumbar spine BMD and total body BMD were significantly lower than normal (-0.75 and -0.95, both p < 0.001). Height SDS and body mass index SDS were also decreased. The decrease in BMD SDS could not be explained by delay in bone maturation. The cumulative dose of prednisolone correlated negatively with lumbar spine BMD SDS (r = -0.32, p < 0.02). Body mass index SDS correlated positively with total body BMD SDS (r = 0.36, p < 0.02). Patients with Crohn's disease had significantly lower lumbar spine and total body BMD SDS than patients with ulcerative colitis, even after adjustment for cumulative dose of prednisolone. In the longitudinal data cumulative dose of prednisolone between the measurements correlated negatively with the change in lumbar spine and total body BMD SDS. Lean tissue mass measured by DXA had a strong correlation with lean body mass measured by BIA (r = 0.98). CONCLUSIONS: Children with inflammatory bowel disease have a decreased BMD. Children with Crohn's disease have a higher risk of developing osteopaenia than children with ulcerative colitis. Corticosteroid therapy and nutritional status are important determinants of BMD in these patients.},

   abstract = {BACKGROUND: Hypovitaminosis and fat-soluble vitamin deficiency have been reported in adults with inflammatory bowel disease (IBD). A prospective study was undertaken to determine the prevalence of low serum levels of vitamins A and E in children and young adults with IBD. METHODS: Clinical information and serum for vitamin levels was gathered prospectively from 61 patients with Crohn's disease, 36 patients with ulcerative colitis, and 23 control subjects. Disease activity and disease location were determined for IBD patients. Serum retinol and alpha-tocopherol levels were determined by high-performance liquid chromatography. RESULTS: The prevalence of hypovitaminosis A (defined as serum vitamin A < 20 micrograms/dl) or hypovitaminosis E (defined as serum vitamin E < 5 mg/l) was 16% in the pediatric IBD population studied. Low vitamin A levels were more common than low vitamin E levels. Serum retinol levels correlated significantly with alpha-tocopherol levels. Hypovitaminosis was significantly more prevalent in the Crohn's disease patients who had active disease, an erythrocyte sedimentation rate of more than 25 mm/hour, or a serum albumin level less than 3 mg/dl. CONCLUSIONS: Children and young adults with active IBD frequently have low serum levels of vitamin A or vitamin E. The severity of disease activity is a better predictor of risk for hypovitaminosis than is nutritional status. Further work is necessary to determine whether the hypovitaminosis seen in children with IBD reflects true deficiency.},

   abstract = {Basic fibroblast growth factor is a heparin-binding protein known to stimulate angiogenesis and promote wound healing in tissues. Since Crohn's disease is characterized in part by submucosal vascular proliferation, we sought to determine whether serum basic fibroblast growth factor is elevated in children with Crohn's disease and whether serum levels reflect disease activity. Sera were obtained from 64 children with Crohn's disease, 44 children with ulcerative colitis, 20 children with functional abdominal pain, and 29 from children with documented inflammatory disease evaluated in our gastroenterology program. Disease activity indices and clinical data were gathered prospectively for the inflammatory bowel disease patients. Serum basic fibroblast growth factor levels were measured by enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay. Although the mean basic fibroblast growth factor level did not significantly differ between children with Crohn's disease and other conditions, there was a strong (r = 0.53, P < 0.001) correlation between basic fibroblast growth factor level and disease activity. The relationship of basic fibroblast growth factor with disease activity persisted even after adjusting for other covariates (including age, sex, hematocrit, albumin, and sedimentation rate) in a multivariate linear regression model. There was also a statistically significant, although less strong correlation (r = 0.33, P = 0.03) between basic fibroblast growth factor level and disease activity in ulcerative colitis. While basic fibroblast growth factor is not a specific marker for Crohn's disease, serum levels reflect disease activity. Therefore, basic fibroblast growth factor release may be important in mediating the angiogenesis and wound healing seen in Crohn's disease.},

   abstract = {Children and adolescents with inflammatory bowel disease (IBD) present unique challenges to physicians and all health-care providers. The most important aspect is that children are not small adults. They are characterized by a highly dynamic state of growth and physical change as well as a constant alteration in psychological status. It will not be difficult to recognize IBD, even in children, when it presents with classical symptoms such as bloody diarrhoea, abdominal pain and weight loss. However, some children will present with abdominal pain and depression. Not infrequently these children are diagnosed as being depressed and are seen and treated by psychologists and psychiatrists for different periods of time. In addition, several children will be initially diagnosed as having a bacterial gastroenteritis with a proven positive faecal culture. It seems to be the triggering event in these children, and if adequate therapy fails, colonoscopy is indicated. Recently, Beattie et al. showed that in children seen for chronic abdominal pain simple routine blood tests including full blood count and erythrocyte sedimentation rate are almost always abnormal in children with IBD. But most importantly, growth retardation is common in children with IBD and is more often found in Crohn's disease (CD) than in ulcerative colitis (UC). Faltering growth is a sign of a catabolic situation. Therefore, it is essential to follow the growth of children at the beginning and during treatment of IBD. Growth retardation can be the first symptom of IBD and is often already present before other symptoms of IBD become apparent. Rarely, extra-intestinal manifestations, particularly arthritis, can be the first and sometimes only initial symptom for months to years in children with IBD. About 2% of all patients with IBD present before the age of 10 years, but 30% present between the age of 10 and 19 years. A significant proportion of young patients with IBD will develop the disease just prior to or during puberty. Adolescent growth is characterized by rapid accumulation of lean body mass and any inflammatory disease occurring at this time is likely to have a major impact on nutritional status and growth. This rapid growth requires an appropriate increase in nutritional substrates and failure to achieve catch-up growth may ultimately lead to poor cumulative growth over time. Most of the growth retardation is seen in children with CD, approximately 30%. However, also in UC 15% will show a reduction in growth. The higher percentage in CD could be due to the disease itself or to the relative subtlety of the intestinal manifestations of CD, mainly abdominal pain and general malaise. Not only growth, but also delayed puberty, is a sign of an ongoing disease that most likely needs more intensive treatment. It has been shown that the severity of disease activity plays a more important role in the occurrence of growth retardation than steroid treatment. Therefore in paediatrics it is important to state that growth retardation during medical treatment equals undertreatment. In contrast to adults, the potential benefit of nutritional therapy should be seriously considered in addition to aggressive medical therapy including steroids and other immunosuppressive agents such as azathioprine. The most convincing evidence that malnutrition is primarily responsible for growth failure is based on depletion studies. The malnutrition itself is caused by ongoing inflammation and loss of appetite. Recommendations for nutritional therapy include an increase in energy and protein intake to 150% of recommended daily allowances for height and age. Some studies have shown the benefit of nocturnal nasogastric infusion as supplements of daily intake. Importantly, nutritional support has been shown to be as effective as steroids in achieving remission of disease in children. Furthermore, no significant differences have been shown in studies using elemental versus polymeric diets.},

DESIGN: A cross-sectional study. SETTING: The Department of Internal Medicine, Catholic University Hospital, Rome, Italy. SUBJECTS: Thirty-four patients with biopsy-proven inflammatory bowel disease (18 CD; 16 UC) in clinical remission (SCDAI < 3 and Powell-Tuck index < 4) not receiving steroid therapy. INTERVENTIONS: All patients had a clinical examination. MAIN OUTCOME MEASURES: Blood indicators of inflammation and nutritional status. Body composition was assessed by both anthropometry and bioimpedance and metabolic variables were measured by indirect calorimetry over a 60-90 min period. RESULTS: CD had a lower body weight than both controls (58.1 kg, range 41.5-71.0 vs. 66.4 kg, range 57.0-76.0; P < 0.001) and UC) 58.1 kg, range 41.5-71.0 vs. 69.6 kg, range 50.5-94.0; (P < 0.001). Fat-free mass (FFM) did not differ between the groups, whilst fat mass was significantly lower in CD than in UC (P < 0.05) and controls (P < 0.001). Normalizing the basal metabolic rate by FFM, a higher value was found in CD compared with UC (143 kJ kg-1) d-(-1), range 97.5-179 vs. 133 kJ kg-1 d-1, range 123-148; P < 0.05) and control subject 143 kj kg-1 d-1, range 97.5-179 vs. 134 kj kg-1 d-1, range 122-162; P < 0.05). The nonprotein respiratory quotient was significantly lower in CD compared to UC 0.80, range 0.73-0.84 vs. 0.84, range 0.79-0.91; P < 0.01) and controls (0.80, range 0.73-0.84 vs. 0.83, range 0.81-0.87; P < 0.001), with a consequently higher lipid oxidation rate in CD. CONCLUSIONS: CD subjects showed a decreased fat mass and enhanced utilization of lipids compared with UC and controls. These data could be explained by the larger intestinal involvement and considered as a contribution to lipid tissue wasting in CD.},

A combined therapeutic approach of the acute episode was based on intestinal diversion, abscess drainage, antibiotherapy, nutritional support and post-operative immunosuppression with azathioprine. The definitive treatment of the ileocolonic involvement occurred 6 months after the acute episode and consisted of limited resection, multiple strictureplasties, primar" closure of ileosigmod fistula and undiversion. This operative procedure was followed by a short period of total parenteral nutrition and progressive re-establishment ofenteric nutritional support and immunosuppression. At 18 months follow-up, under low dose azathioprine revealed, a normal growth with a 20 Kg weight gain and 10 cm height gain, no evidence of fistula recurrence or restenosis and suggests the safety of strictureplasty in paediatric patients as a way to conserve as much small bowel as possible.},

Percutaneous endoscopic gastrostomy has been little used, even through it can facilitate the administration of an unpalatable elemental diet to an anorexic, undernourished patients. Its use is reported in 10 children with Crohn's disease. The gastrostomy was found to be more acceptable than a nasogastric tube and was associated with only minor complications. As a consequence of improved delivery of enteral nutrition, in the year after the insertion of the gastrostomy there was a reduction in prednisolone dosage in all patients, with six patients being able to stop prednisolone completely. The SD score for height also improved significantly. It is suggested that percutaneous endoscopic gastrostomy is both useful and safe in the management of Crohn's disease in children, particularly when compliance with an elemental diet is likely to be poor.},

The effect of nutritional state, disease activity, and steroid therapy on bone mineral content (BMC) of whole body, lumbar spine, and left femoral neck measured by dual energy x ray absorptiometry in 32 children with IBD was assessed by comparison with 58 healthy local school children. Using the control data, a predicted BMC was calculated taking into account bone area, age, height, weight, and pubertal stage. The measured BMC in children with IBD was expressed as a percentage of this predicted value (% BMC). Mean (SD) % BMC was significantly reduced for the whole body and left femoral neck in the children with IBD (97.0 (4.5)% and 93.1 (12.0)% respectively, p < 0.05). Of the children with IBD, 41% had a % BMC less than 1 SD below the mean for the whole body and 47% at the femoral neck. Reduction in % BMC was associated with steroid usage but not with the magnitude of steroid dose, disease activity, or biochemical markers of bone metabolism. In conclusion, osteopenia is relatively common in childhood IBD and may be partly related to the previous use of steroids.},

   abstract = {BACKGROUND: Pediatric patients presenting with colitis, suggestive of inflammatory bowel disease, undergo evaluation with either flexible sigmoidoscopy or colonoscopy. Our objectives were to assess current practice behavior in the evaluation of pediatric patients with colitis and to determine whether flexible sigmoidoscopy or colonoscopy was more cost-effective as the initial evaluation. METHODS: Practice behavior and procedure charges were assessed using a nationwide survey, and costs for diagnostic strategies were compared using a decision analysis program. RESULTS: The vast majority of survey respondents would proceed with colonoscopy if colitis suggestive of Crohn's disease was noted in the rectosigmoid area (81%) or if ulcerative colitis extended proximal to the rectosigmoid area (70%). If colonoscopy would follow if flexible sigmoidoscopy suggested either ulcerative colitis or Crohn's disease (67%), then colonoscopy would result in a savings of 23%. If the evaluation was predetermined to be limited to flexible sigmoidoscopy (16%), then flexible sigmoidoscopy was the cost-effective strategy with savings of 29%. If colonoscopy would follow flexible sigmoidoscopy for Crohn's colitis only (13%), there was no clear cost advantage. CONCLUSIONS: The most cost-effective strategy depends on the physician's need to know the disease location. Our survey results indicate that most physicians chose to establish the extent of disease in both ulcerative colitis and in Crohn's disease; thus initial colonoscopy would be the more cost-effective strategy. When knowledge of disease distribution is not essential for patient care, flexible sigmoidoscopy can lead to substantial cost savings.},

   abstract = {Crohn's disease is frequently complicated by protein-calorie malnutrition. Four common clinical presentations of Crohn's disease include acute exacerbations or flares of disease, intestinal obstruction, fistulizing disease, and perianal disease. In this review, we examine the role of nutritional support in these clinical scenarios. Nutritional support is important for maintaining functional status and preventing loss of lean tissue. Determinants of lean-tissue loss include severity of underlying injury, baseline nutritional status, and duration of inadequate nutrition. One of the clinically useful measures of nutritional status is the nutritional risk index (NRI) defined on the basis of the serum albumin and weight loss. Nutritional support is important in severely malnourished patients (NRI < 83). Enteral nutrition is the route of choice, provided there are no contraindications to using the gastrointestinal tract. In acute exacerbations of Crohn's disease, enteral nutrition also has a role in the primary management of disease although it is not as effective as corticosteroids in inducing remission. The mechanisms are poorly understood and the most effective enteral formulation needs to be determined. Total parenteral nutrition is justified in severely malnourished Crohn's disease patients who are unable to tolerate enteral feeding or in whom enteral feeding is contraindicated. More clinical studies are needed on the assessment of malnutrition in Crohn's disease, the effects of nutritional management on functional status, and the timing of nutritional intervention.},

   abstract = {OBJECTIVE: To determine whether the greater daily expense of administering total parenteral nutrition (TPN) via plastic bags changed once daily, compared to glass bottles changed thrice daily, could be offset by savings from a reduction in nosocomial infections. DESIGN: The costs and potential benefits of commercially available TPN bags and TPN in glass containers were compared. Costs were computed from the viewpoint of the hospital, first in a general model and then for two specific examples, Crohn's disease and intensive-care unit (ICU) patients. The extra cost of using bags was $20 per day. The total cost of nosocomial bacteremia was estimated at $6,000. The monetary benefits of using TPN bags were $6,000XT, where XT was the percentage of nosocomial infections averted. We also considered that reduction in intravenous (IV)-line manipulation could reduce bacteremia-related mortality and computed a cost-per-life-saved ratio. RESULTS: Modeling showed that TPN in bags could yield a net benefit when the absolute reduction in the daily risk of nosocomial bacteremia reached the threshold value of 0.3%. Such a reduction could not be attained in patients with Crohn's disease, and corresponded to a 50% to 60% reduction of infection rates in ICU patients. Varying the risk of mortality attributable to IV-line-related infection from 1% to 13% resulted in a cost effectiveness of using TPN bags ranging from $90,000 to $7,000 per life saved in ICU, assuming a two-thirds reduction in IV-line infections, and from $180,000 to $14,000 if the infection rate was reduced by one third. CONCLUSION: The baseline cost-minimization analysis concluded that the extra cost of TPN bags was not justified by the extra savings. The cost-effectiveness analysis, however, found that the cost per life saved fell within the accepted range of public health interventions, provided a large fraction of infections are averted using TPN bags.},

   abstract = {Most patients with Crohn's disease have to be operated on. Necessity to loose some amount of the intestine and time-point of the surgical intervention may be derived from the irreversible cascade of the inflammatory process and the limitations of the conservative treatment. In ileocecal disease indications for surgery are represented by stenotic and/or penetrating complications of the inflamed bowel, whereas in Crohn's colitis acute or terminal medical refractority is predominating. Standard-procedures result from constantly definable patterns of the disease manifestation: ileocecal resection and colectomy/-proctocolectomy. In segmental colitis sometimes "resections within Crohn's" may be adequate in a first attempt to avoid anticipating the natural course by surgical means. In these cases the further prognosis depends on the treatment possibilities of the remaining colon. In contrast, true recurrence is a new inflammation of the neoterminal ileum and may indicate repeated resections. The frequence decreases with the number of resections. Nevertheless nutritional status is restored even by multiple resections, whereas specific functional sequelae of the resection--distal resection- and dehydration syndromes--are well treatable mostly. In the case of appropriate timing of the operation and the reoperation operative morbidity and mortality are remarkable low today resulting in an almost normal life expectancy. Most important as negative prognostic factor remains sepsis resulting from pre-existing or postoperative infectious complications. Keeping this in mind experimental pharmaco-therapy to delay the operation and not profoundly substantiated tendencies to minimize surgery are to be considered only with critical scepticism. At the moment, future research is thought to be more successful in focussing prophylaxis of ileal recurrence than avoiding surgery.},

   abstract = {OBJECTIVE: The authors investigate the effects of low dose recombinant human growth hormone (rhGH) on body composition and absorptive capacity in patients with short bowel syndrome from Crohn's disease. SUMMARY BACKGROUND DATA: Patients with short bowel syndrome usually are malnourished because of malabsorption. The anabolic effects of high doses of rhGH have been tested in different clinical catabolic conditions, recently including patients with short bowel syndrome. The authors have investigated the effects of low-dose rhGH in short bowel syndrome in a placebo-controlled crossover clinical trial. METHODS: Ten patients were treated with daily subcutaneous doses of rhGH/placebo (0.5 international units/kg-1 per week-1 = 0.024 mg/kg-1 per day-1) for 8 weeks in a randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled crossover clinical trial with a minimum of 12 weeks wash-out. Absorptive capacity and biochemical parameters were investigated in a metabolic ward before treatment and during first and last week of treatment. Body composition was determined by DEXA-Scan (Lunar DPX, Scanexport Medical, Helsingborg, Sweden), impedance analysis, and whole body potassium counting. RESULTS: Low-dose rhGH doubled serum levels of insulin-like growth factor-1 (IGF-1) and increased body weight, lean body mass, and total body potassium by 5% (p < 0.05). Fat-free mass and total body water increased by 6% (p = 0.008). Increases in IGF-1 levels correlated with increases in fat-free mass (r = 0.77, p < 0.02). No significant changes in absorptive capacity of water, energy, or protein were detected. CONCLUSION: Eight weeks of low-dose rhGH treatment leads to increases in body weight, lean body mass, and fat-free mass in patients with short bowel syndrome, correlated to increases in IGF-1 levels.},

In comparison to adults, abdominal pain is a relatively frequent presenting symptom in children in addition to rectal bleeding, bloody diarrhoea or diarrhoea. Distribution of disease in children is generally more extensive (ratio rectal:left sided:extensive 25:30:45). There are remarkably few clinical trials of therapy in children and reasons for this are discussed. Subjective indices of disease severity and activity are unreliable in children. Objective measures such as endoscopy are of value to define the extent of ulceration and histopathological features; a test of gut protein loss using whole gut lavage gives an objective index of disease activity. Principles of medical management in children are generally the same as in adults with the additional need for scrupulous attention to nutrition and growth, and psychological factors. Reassuring results of a review of the health status of young adults who had developed ulcerative colitis in childhood are presented. Twenty-four of 27 considered themselves fully fit although nine of the patients had a permanent ileostomy.},

   abstract = {Disordered nutrition is common in Crohn's disease and is multifactorial. Regular and systematic monitoring of at least a minimum set of nutrition data is an essential component of care of children and adults with Crohn's disease. However, even in children, monitoring of growth and development may be deficient. Multiple macro- and micronutrient deficiencies are common in Crohn's disease, especially in those with extensive small bowel deficiencies or after multiple surgical resections. Body composition analysis may show differences from simple starvation, and metabolic effects of inflammation are increasingly being recognized. Nutritional support is part of the management of all patients with Crohn's disease, but nutritional intervention with defined formula liquid diet is an effective specific anti-inflammatory therapy. Although meta-analysis of published trials suggest that steroids are more effective than defined formula liquid diets, objective evidence from whole gut lavage fluid analysis and from faecal excretion of radiolabelled leukocytes shows unequivocal benefit of elemental diet based on measuring parameters of tissue damage. Enteral feeding with liquid diets should be considered in patients with incomplete small bowel obstruction, severe painful perianal disease, failure of corticosteroids in active Crohn's disease, borderline intestinal failure and in children with active Crohn's disease or with growth failure.},

We aimed to assess the mucosal fatty acid pattern in patients with ulcerative colitis and Crohn's disease, and in rats with trinitrobenzene-sulfonic acid (TNB) induced colitis. METHODS: Fatty acids were measured in colonic mucosa of patients with ulcerative colitis (n = 30), Crohn's disease (n = 21), and healthy controls (n = 13). Likewise, they were assessed in the colonic mucosa of rats with TNB- and sham-colitis. RESULTS: There was an increase of the end-products (C22:5n3, C22:6n3, C20:4n6, C22:5n6) and a decrease of the precursors (C18:3n3, C18:2n6) of both n3 and n6 polyunsaturated fatty acids in the mucosa of active ulcerative colitis and TNB-colitis. Also, high values of saturated (C16:0, C18:0) and low values of monounsaturated fatty acids (C18:1n9) were observed. Furthermore, the mucosa of active Crohn's disease showed substantial changes in saturated, monounsaturated and essential fatty acids, but not in polyunsaturated fatty acids. Mucosa of patients with inactive disease showed intermediate fatty acid values between the mucosa of active patients and healthy controls. CONCLUSIONS: Colonic inflammation causes a characteristic modification of the mucosal fatty acid profile which appears to be common to different aetiologies and seems to be related to the degree of inflammation.},

After operation the patients should be adapted to enteral feeding as soon as possible. The nutritional management is determined by the type of intestinal resection and length of remaining small and large bowel. Total parenteral nutrition for life-time is necessary in patients with less than 50 cm of small bowel. Toxic megacolon is a rare complication seen in Crohn's disease. Conservative therapy includes high doses of intravenous steroids, electrolyte replacement and hydration, antibiotics, decompression of the bowel as well as vigorous surveillance for potential complications. About 50% of the patients with toxic megacolon recover with conservative treatment alone. Surgical intervention should be performed not later than 48 hours after unsuccessful conservative therapy.},

Subjects participated in breath tests before and after six months of a high polyunsaturated to saturated (P/S) fat ratio diet to measure their response to [1-13C] 10:0 and [1-13C] 16:0 ingested with a test meal. Whole body absorption-oxidation of C10:0 was not affected by the diet treatment. Before diet treatment, whole body absorption-oxidation of C16:0 in Crohn's patients was 80% of that observed for control subjects. After consuming a high polyunsaturated to saturated fatty acid ratio diet, subjects increased oxidation of C16:0 by 85% compared to before the diet treatment period. It is concluded that (1) absorption of labelled C16:0 from a test meal is reduced in Crohn's patients, and (2) consumption of a high polyunsaturated to saturated fatty acid ratio diet improves the utilization of dietary C16:0 by Crohn's patients.},

METHODS: We examined the intestinal absorption of ursodeoxycholic acid by the oral ursodeoxycholic acid tolerance test in 19 children and adolescents with inflammatory bowel disease at various stages, including 8 patients with unoperated Crohn's disease, 3 patients with ileal-resected Crohn's disease, 8 with ulcerative colitis, and 8 healthy control subjects. RESULTS: Ursodeoxycholic acid malabsorption was present in all patients with unoperated Crohn's disease in the first diagnosed active stage, in 3 of 5 patients in a relapsing active stage, and in 2 of 8 patients in remission. Ursodeoxycholic acid absorption was significantly lower in patients in the first diagnosed active stage than in the healthy controls (p < 0.01) or in patients in remission (p < 0.01). There was no significant difference between healthy controls and the patients in a relapsing active stage or in remission. Ursodeoxycholic acid absorption was abnormal during the first postoperative month in patients with ileal-resected Crohn's disease, but normalized over time. Malabsorption of ursodeoxycholic acid was not observed in any patients with ulcerative colitis. CONCLUSIONS: These findings suggest that absorption of ursodeoxycholic acid in the proximal intestine is impaired in patients with Crohn's disease and that the oral ursodeoxycholic acid tolerance test is a convenient and useful means of evaluating the absorption of bile acid in the proximal intestine in pediatric patients with ileal or ileocolic Crohn's disease.},

From 1985 to 1992, 87 active patients treated for more than 4 weeks with EN and 71 active patients treated with TPN were analysed. Excluding the case with severe complications (abdominal abscess, external fistula, sub-ileus), 132 patients were divided to two groups (patients with remission and non-remission) based on clinical response to the treatment. Remission was defined as Crohn's disease activity index (CDAI) < 150 and ESR < 20 mm/hr after 4 weeks of treatment. Clinical characteristics and radiographic findings were compared between the two groups. Furthermore, a multiple logistic regression analysis was performed to clarify the relative importance of various clinical or radiographic factors associated with remission. Remission rate at four weeks with EN was 77% and that with TPN was 62%. By a multiple logistic regression analysis using 15 factors, which were significant by a single variable analysis, four factors (times of previous nutritional treatment, IOIBD, WBC, polyposis score of the colon) in EN cases and three factors (ESR, platelets, extent of Crohn's disease) in TPN cases were selected as independent prognostic factors after adjusting for the effect of other factors. Moreover, mode of therapy was not selected as a valuable factor. From the above mentioned results, it was concluded that EN and TPN were equivalent in the efficacy of short-term therapy and patients having had several previous nutritional therapy, high IOIBD score, high WBC count, severe cobblestoning of the colon were tended to be resistant to EN therapy and high ESR value, high platelet count, broader extent of Crohn's disease were tended to be resistant to TPN therapy. Both clinical and radiographic features are important prognostic factors in predicting response to nutritional therapy.},

   abstract = {Malnutrition is observed frequently and is an important complication in patients with Crohn disease (CD). The pathophysiology of malnutrition in this disorder is complex. To obtain a comprehensive picture of nutritional status in patients with long-standing CD that was clinically in remission, we assessed four measures of nutritional status in 32 patients (18 women and 14 men) and 32 matched healthy control subjects: 1) body composition, 2) dietary intake, 3) biochemical indexes of nutrition, and 4) and muscle strength (as a functional index). Mean daily intakes of fiber and phosphorus were significantly lower in CD patients than in control subjects. Serum concentrations of several nutrients (beta-carotene, vitamin C, vitamin E, selenium, and zinc) and activity of the enzyme glutathione peroxidase were also significantly lower in CD patients, as were antioxidant status and serum concentrations of magnesium and vitamin D. Percentage body fat and hamstring muscle strength were significantly lower in male CD patients than in control subjects, whereas muscle strength of the quadriceps was preserved. In conclusion, this study showed a variety of nutritional and functional deficiencies in patients with long-standing CD in remission, especially in male patients with a high lifetime prednisone dose. A comprehensive nutritional assessment seems superior to the assessment of a single dimension of nutritional status.},

   abstract = {BACKGROUND & AIMS: Children with inflammatory bowel disease (IBD) are at risk for osteoporosis because of undernutrition, delayed puberty, and prolonged corticosteroid use. The aim of this study was to compare bone mineral density (BMD) in children with IBD with that in normal children and to assess the effects of nutritional and hormonal factors and corticosteroid dosages on BMD. METHODS: One hundred sixty-two subjects (99 with IBD and 63 healthy sibling controls) were enrolled. Patients underwent anthropometric assessment, pubertal staging, bone age radiography, and BMD assessment by dual energy x-ray absorptiometry of the lumbar spine, femoral neck, and radius. Laboratory evaluations included serum calcium, phosphate, alkaline phosphatase, 25-hydroxyvitamin D, 1,25-dihydroxyvitamin D, parathyroid hormone, osteocalcin, urinary N-telopeptides, albumin, insulin-like growth factor I, and testosterone or estradiol. Cumulative corticosteroid doses were calculated. RESULTS: BMD Z scores at the lumbar spine and femoral neck were lower in patients with IBD, and lower in those with Crohn's disease compared with those with ulcerative colitis. Low BMD persisted after correction for bone age in girls with Crohn's disease (lumbar spine, P = 0.004; femoral neck, P = 0.002). Cumulative corticosteroid dose was a significant predictor of reduced BMD. BMD did not correlate with measures of calcium homeostasis, except elevated serum phosphate and urine calcium levels in girls. CONCLUSIONS: Low BMD occurs in children with IBD (more in Crohn's disease than in ulcerative colitis), especially pubertal and postpubertal girls. Cumulative corticosteroid dose is a predictor of low BMD, but other factors in Crohn's disease remain undetermined.},

At the end of the study, 63% of the patients continued to receive AHEN, showing a mortality rate of 70%. The majority of the patients undergoing treatment presented a sever social disability (20%) or were bed ridden (18%). The most common indications for the AHPN are: radical enteritis (26%), Crohn's disease (21%), and mesenteric ischemia (16%).

   abstract = {INTRODUCTION: Long-term survival after massive intestinal resection is now possible with parenteral nutritional support. The expense, morbidity, and inconvenience of this therapy, however, have led to continued interest in alternatives for the treatment of the short bowel syndrome. Patients with short bowel require a multi disciplinary approach over a prolonged period. HISTORICAL CONSIDERATIONS: The history of small bowel transplantation started in 1959 when Lillehei showed that autotransplantation of the small intestine in a dog was feasible. From 1964 to 1971, 7 attempts of small bowel allotransplantations in humans have been reported. All 7 patients died. DEFINITION: Short gut syndrome is a malabsorptive condition occurring after significant loss of intestinal absorptive capacity. The clinical syndrome is manifested by malnutrition, steatorrhea, weight loss, and diarrhea due to decreased absorptive capacity. ETIOLOGY: Etiologic factors leading to the short gut state include necrotizing enterocolitis, midgut volvulus, trauma, embolic phenomenon, and Crohn's disease. PATHOPHYSIOLOGY: Intestinal failure is the end result of several complex interacting mechanisms related to: reduced enterocyte mass, short small bowel length with consequent reduced mucosal contact time for absorption, massive proximal loop dilatation with poor propulsion, and intraluminal stasis and bacterial overgrowth lead to bacterial translocation to the liver systemically. MANAGEMENT: Patients with short bowel must be totally or partly supported with intravenous nutrition until enteral absorption can sustain survival and growth. Autologous bowel reconstruction attempts to reconfigure the residual bowel to eliminate negative factors of bowel dilatation and stasis, and redistribute the absorptive mucosa to enhance the adaptation response. Several procedures have been suggested to: prolong transmitting time and increase mucosal contact time, enhance absorption by bowel tailoring and bowel lengthening, and increasing the Enterocyte mass. CONCLUSION: Autologous gastro-intestinal reconstruction is still in its infacny with prospect of new and different concepts for the future.},

   abstract = {PURPOSE: To determine the dietary practices of the pediatric inflammatory bowel disease population at the Children's Hospital of the Hamilton Health Sciences Corporation and the reported effectiveness of those diets. PATIENTS AND METHODS: A questionnaire mailed to 153 pediatric patients was returned by 125 patients (76 Crohn's disease [CD] and 49 ulcerative colitis [UC] patients)--an 82% response rate. RESULTS: The median age of respondents was 13 years, and 62% were male. Ninety per cent and 71% of CD and UC patients, respectively, had changed their diets since diagnosis. Caloric supplements (eg, BOOST [Mead Johnson Nutritionals]), sole source nutrition, low fibre and lactose-free diets were used by more than 15% of CD patients, whereas lactose-free, nonspicy, low acid, additive-free, caloric supplement and low fibre diets were used by more than 15% of UC patients. A diet supplement was more commonly used in CD patients (P < 0.05) and an additive-free diet in UC patients. Corn and corn products, nuts, milk and bran were avoided by more than 20% of CD and UC patients; however, more CD than UC patients avoided corn and corn products. In addition, UC patients (more than 20%) also avoided tomato, other dairy (nonfluid milk-based products and foods containing milk products), chocolate, cheese, wheat, tomato sauces and fruit juice. A benefit was reported for 103 of 141 reported diets, with the most commonly alleviated symptoms being abdominal pain, diarrhea and flatulence. CONCLUSION: Many children with inflammatory bowel disease have altered their diets to manage their disease and have attributed symptomatic relief to these diets.},

   abstract = {The clinical features of Crohn's disease manifest during adolescence are varied as in adults. The potential complication of growth impairment and concomitant delay in pubertal development is unique to this population. Cytokines released from the inflamed bowel and chronic nutritional insufficiency are the major factors in the pathophysiology of growth inhibition. Hence reduction of intestinal inflammation and consistent provision of adequate nutrition are of paramount importance in management. Drug treatment mirrors that of adults; few specifically paediatric clinical trials have been conducted. Enteral nutrition is an important therapeutic alternative for young patients. There is evidence that it constitutes both a primary therapy of inflammation and a means of providing the calories needed for growth. In the setting of extensive disease, dependency on corticosteroids should be minimized through judicious administration of immunosuppressive drugs. For an adolescent with localized stenotic disease, optimal management includes a timely referral for intestinal resection as a means of providing an asymptomatic interval during which growth and pubertal development can normalize.},

No specific dietary toxin or antigen has been identified to have an etiologic role in either ulcerative colitis or Crohn's disease. A possible modulating effect of omega-3 polyunsaturated fatty acids on intestinal inflammation is being investigated. Most prevalent among the nutritional consequences of inflammatory bowel disease is weight loss, for which inadequate caloric intake is primarily responsible. Impairment of linear growth and associated delay in pubertal development commonly complicate childhood Crohn's disease. The two major etiologic factors are chronic undernutrition and direct effects of inflammatory mediators secreted from the inflamed gut. Recent studies have incriminated interleukin-6. Treatment of intestinal inflammation and provision of adequate nutrition are of paramount importance in preventing or remedying growth impairment. Exclusive enteral nutrition using formulated food is efficacious primary therapy of active Crohn's disease, although the mode of action is poorly understood.},

METHODS: Transhiatal oesophagectomy was done in 29 patients for benign oesophageal conditions including corrosive stricture (21), achalasia of the cardia (four), tuberculosis (one), mediastinal fibrosis (one), Crohn's disease (one) and peptic stricture (one). Dysphagia was the predominant symptom in all patients; strictures had all previously been dilated repeatedly. The stomach was used as an oesophageal substitute in 24 patients; in five with a scarred stomach due to damage by a corrosive agent, oesophagocoloplasty was performed. Resection and reconstruction were done in one stage in 25 patients; four with poor nutritional status had a two-stage procedure. RESULTS: There was no perioperative death. Complications encountered were recurrent laryngeal nerve palsy (six patients) which was mostly transient, anastomotic leak (seven) and stenosis (eight). Postoperative function of the intrathoracic stomach was satisfactory. CONCLUSION: Transhiatal oesophagectomy is a safe and satisfactory procedure for benign obstructive conditions of the oesophagus.},

   abstract = {OBJECTIVE: Wernicke encephalopathy (WE) is an acute neurologic disorder characterized by a triad of ophthalmoplegia, ataxia, and mental confusion. WE is attributable to thiamine (vitamin B1) deficiency. Beriberi is the systemic counterpart of thiamine deficiency and often manifests in cardiovascular collapse. WE is usually associated with alcoholism and malnutrition. It has also been seen in people with gastrointestinal diseases with malabsorption. Patients who have received total parenteral nutrition (TPN) without proper replacement of thiamine have also developed WE. Since November 1996, there has been a shortage of multivitamin infusion (MVI). Many patients who were on chronic TPN with MVI ceased to receive the MVI and were converted to an oral form of the multivitamin. As a result, there have been several reports of children and adults on TPN who have developed WE as a result of thiamine deficiency. With this case report, we bring to attention the association of the MVI shortage and WE. Early diagnosis of WE is important, because if it is treated with thiamine in the acute stages, the neurologic and cardiovascular abnormalities can be reversed. CASE REPORT: We report a 20-year-old female patient with Crohn's disease who developed WE as a result of thiamine deficiency. She had Crohn's disease since age 9 years and was on chronic TPN. Two months before admission, MVI was discontinued in the TPN because of the shortage of its supply. An oral multivitamin tablet was substituted instead. She was admitted to the hospital for persistent vomiting. In the hospital, she continued to receive TPN without MVI, but continued taking an oral multivitamin preparation. Two weeks after admission, she developed signs of WE including diplopia, ophthalmoplegia, nystagmus, and memory disturbance. She also developed hypotension that was thought to be caused by beriberi. She was treated with 50 mg of intravenous thiamine. Within hours of the intravenous thiamine, her hypotension resolved. The day after the infusion, she no longer complained of diplopia, and her ophthalmoplegia had improved dramatically. Magnetic resonance imaging showed several areas of abnormally high signal on T2-weighted images in the brainstem, thalamus, and mamillary bodies. The topographic distribution of these changes was typical of WE. After 2 months, her mental status and neurologic status had recovered completely. CONCLUSION: WE and thiamine deficiency should be considered in all patients with malabsorption, malnutrition, and malignancies. WE from thiamine deficiency can occur as a result of cessation of MVI in the TPN infusion. Even if an oral multivitamin preparation is given instead of MVI, patients with malabsorption may not absorb thiamine adequately. Prompt diagnosis of WE is important because it is potentially fatal and readily treatable with thiamine supplementation. Early recognition of WE may be more difficult in children, because the classic triad of symptoms may not develop fully. Magnetic resonance imaging may be useful in these cases to confirm the diagnosis of WE. Because the shortage of MVI is expected to be a long-term, there are likely to be more cases of WE in the pediatric population of TPN-dependent children. Because there is no shortage of intravenous thiamine, it should be administered with TPN even if MVI is not available.},

   abstract = {BACKGROUND: Eosinophils contribute to the intestinal inflammatory infiltrate in Crohn's disease (CD). Eosinophilic infiltration occurs early in Crohn's recurrences, and a release of eosinophil cationic proteins has been observed in active CD. The proliferation, differentiation, and activation of eosinophils are highly dependent on the cytokine interleukin 5 (IL5). In the present study, we used in situ hybridization (ISH) to investigate the expression of the IL5 gene in intestinal specimens from patients with CD. METHODS: We studied 14 intestinal samples from eight children who had undergone ileocolectomy for advanced CD. The samples were examined for the intensity of the inflammatory infiltrate. Normal pediatric intestine specimens served as controls. In situ hybridization was performed on frozen tissue using radiolabeled IL5 mRNA probes. RESULTS: Positive signal with the IL5 antisense probe was observed within numerous cells infiltrating the specimens involved with CD. The number of IL5-expressing cells correlated with the histological grade of inflammation. Most of the labeled cells were eosinophils, characterized by their bilobed nuclei. Rare IL5-positive cells were detected in the control tissues. No positive signal was obtained with the IL5 sense probe. CONCLUSION: These results suggest that IL5 can be produced by eosinophils at the sites of inflammation in active CD and could be involved in the immune response by activating eosinophils, at least in part through an autocrine pathway, and perhaps by interacting with B and T cells.},

   abstract = {UNLABELLED: Indication for and an evaluation of enteral nutrition in Crohn's disease differ between Japan and western countries. PURPOSE: Japanese results are reported and differences are discussed. RESULTS: Enteral nutrition with an elemental diet is first-line therapy for active Crohn's disease in Japan. The remission induction rate of elemental diet therapy is approximately 80 percent, which is superior to steroids. Furthermore, elemental diet therapy induces radiographic and endoscopic remission. On the other hand, meta-analysis from randomized, controlled trials showed steroids to be more effective than enteral nutrition in western countries. The differences are considered to be the result of such differences as therapeutic duration of enteral nutrition, the composition of enteral diets used, criteria for remission, the quality of life score of a long-term fast with a nasogastric tube, medical care, and health insurance system. The main mechanism of the therapeutic effect of elemental diet is speculated to be attributable to removal of food antigens and decreases of secretion and motility (bowel rest) by very low fat. To prevent relapse and rehospitalization, home enteral nutrition is now used widely in Japan. The therapeutic effect is observed in patients with ileal involvement, and more than 1,200 kcal/day is more effective than a lower amount. CONCLUSION: Most Japanese studies were open-labeled, uncontrolled trials. We should conduct randomized, controlled trials comparing enteral nutrition with steroids during the active stage of Crohn's disease and home enteral nutrition with drugs in maintaining remission and investigate the therapeutic effect, quality of life, and costs.},

To determine whether antioxidant defenses might be altered, we evaluated plasma antioxidant concentrations in 24 children with inflammatory bowel disease (12 with Crohn disease and 12 with ulcerative colitis) and in 23 healthy control subjects. Anthropometric measurements and disease activity scores were obtained. The groups were of similar age and sex distribution; most children had quiescent or mild disease. The children with Crohn disease were malnourished compared with the ulcerative colitis and control groups. Children with inflammatory bowel disease had decreased plasma ascorbic acid and increased glutathione peroxidase, glutathione, and alpha-tocopherol (vitamin E) concentrations compared with control subjects. These differences were found primarily in the children with Crohn disease. This study provides evidence that children with Crohn disease have alterations in circulating antioxidant defenses, possibly related to an ongoing oxidant stress.},

   abstract = {BACKGROUND: Pediatric inflammatory bowel disease is often associated with growth failure and inadequate energy intake. Although several circulating cytokines are known to be elevated in inflammatory bowel disease, the mechanism for the related anorexia has not been described. Leptin is a newly recognized circulating protein that is an important regulator of appetite and energy metabolism; leptin levels are elevated in several animal models of inflammation. This study was conducted to determine whether serum leptin levels are elevated in young patients with inflammatory bowel disease. METHODS: One hundred twelve children and young adults with Crohn's disease or ulcerative colitis were studied prospectively. Forty-two patients with other gastrointestinal illnesses were used as control subjects. Height, weight, erythrocyte sedimentation rate, serum albumin concentration, and clinical information were collected prospectively, and leptin was measured by radioimmunoassay of stored serum. RESULTS: No significant differences in leptin levels were found among disease groups or control subjects. Body mass index and gender were the only independent predictors of serum leptin in all groups examined. Disease activity varied inversely with serum leptin in patients with Crohn's disease, but these differences were explained entirely by variations in body mass index. CONCLUSIONS: The determinants of serum leptin were the same in young patients with inflammatory bowel disease as in normal populations, indicating that alterations in leptin levels are unlikely to mediate the anorexia and growth failure associated with this disease.},

   abstract = {During the past 20 years there has been growing interest in the importance of nutritional factors in the pathogenesis of inflammatory bowel disease. There are so far no definite links between ulcerative colitis and diet, but links with Crohn's disease have been studied by both epidemiologists and clinicians. Epidemiological studies, although retrospective, have suggested that patients with Crohn's disease eat more sugar and sweets that control individuals; however, when dietary sugar is restricted, there is little clinical benefit. The clinical approach to nutrition in Crohn's disease has been by the use of elemental diets, which will produce symptomatic and objective remission in up to 90% of compliant patients. Those who return to normal eating soon relapse but, in some studies, have enjoyed prolonged remission on exclusion diets. The foods excluded have been not sugar, but predominantly cereals, dairy products and yeast. Attention has now switched to the possible harmful role of fat in Crohn's disease. The efficacy of elemental feeds appears to depend not on the presentation of nitrogen but on the amount of long chain triglyceride present. Increases in recent years in the frequency of Crohn's disease in Japan have been correlated with increased dietary fat intake, and a recent study suggested that W-3 fatty acids, which are metabolized by immunomodulatory leukotrienes and prostaglandins, may have a beneficial role to play. The links between nutrition and Crohn's disease have now become strong and the role of fat may be the most exciting of all.},

This article reviews much of the research that has evaluated the role of diet in the causation, primary treatment, and adjunctive therapy of both ulcerative colitis (UC) and Crohn's disease (CD). Benefits have been demonstrated in the use of elemental diets or polymeric diets in CD in both acute flare up or maintenance of IBD. A careful team approach can overcome problems in implementing nutritional therapy. Nutrition also has a critical benefit in postoperative CD and perioperative UC. Numerous easily corrected, nutritional abnormalities are often overlooked in patients with IBD, which may have significant consequences. Nutritional therapy may have a central place in the hierarchy of treatment in IBD and further research is critical in this area to better define the benefits of nutrition in IBD.},

   abstract = {BACKGROUND: In patients with inflammatory bowel disease (IBD), accelerated bone loss and osteopenia have been found. Potential etiologies of these bone abnormalities have included malnutrition, poor calcium intake or absorption, and the use of corticosteroids. Recent studies have suggested that circulating pro-inflammatory cytokines, which are produced in inflamed bowel, can have a profound effect on bone metabolism, particularly bone resorption. Our aim was to characterize the effects of serum from subjects with IBD on bone metabolism in an in vitro bone culture system. METHODS: Organ cultures of fetal rat parietal bones were treated with sera from 9 subjects with Crohn's disease, 7 with ulcerative colitis, and 10 controls with functional bowel disease (age range of all subjects 7-16 years). Patients were also classified by disease activity, serum albumin level, erythrocyte sedimentation rate (ESR), and serum interleukin (IL) 6 levels. The effects of sera on bone formation and resorption were quantified. RESULTS: Compared with control serum, serum from patients with Crohn's disease significantly decreased bone dry weight (p < 0.01) and calcium content (p < 0.001) during 96 h of culture, while serum from ulcerative colitis patients had no effect. While no difference in collagen synthesis was noted between any of the three experimental groups, noncollagen protein synthesis was lower in the ulcerative colitis group than in the control group or those with Crohn's disease (p < 0.05). DNA content was similar in all groups. There was no significant effect of serum from any experimental group on bone resorption. There was no demonstrable relationship between clinical disease activity, ESR, or serum IL-6 levels and measures of bone metabolism. Histologic evaluation of cultured bone showed marked differences between control subjects and Crohn's disease patients, with the latter being characterized by disorganization of mineral and osteoid and morphologically abnormal osteoblasts. CONCLUSIONS: Serum from children with IBD has a significantly different effect than control serum on an in vitro model of bone metabolism. Our data suggest that circulating factors may affect osteoblasts and bone formation, leading to bone loss. Further work will be required to further characterize the nature of these factors and develop treatment strategies to minimize their effects.},

   abstract = {Malnutrition is a very common situation in patients inflammatory with intestinal disease (IID), which can be caused by a multitude of factors. It has been shown that nutritional support not only improves the nutritional condition of the patients, but in Crohn's disease it also has an effect on the activity of the disease, although this effect is smaller than that of steroids. Elemental diets are no more efficient than polymeric diets except under very special circumstances, but they are more expensive and patients tolerate them worse. A digestive pause is not recommended unless there is an absolute contraindication for the use of the digestive tract. Therefore, parenteral nutrition, which is more expensive and can cause serious complications, will be reserved for very specific indications. The use of fish oil supplements, either because it competes with arachidonic acid and prevents the initiation of the inflammatory cascade, or because it decreases the production of cytokines, has shown to be potentially useful in inflammatory intestinal disease, and this must be confirmed by further studies. Short chain fatty acids enemas have shown promising results in distal ulcerative colitis but the lack of homogeneity in the studies makes it necessary for these results to be consolidated in new studies. Nutritional support is especially interesting in children with inflammatory intestinal disease given that the growth retardation which is often seen in severe cases, can be controlled by adequate enteral or parenteral diets.},

   abstract = {BACKGROUND: Recurrence of Crohn's disease after surgery is a common occurrence, pointing to the need for a strategy to prevent recurrent disease. We report the postoperative course of 10 patients who required intestinal resections for complications related to Crohn's disease. METHODS: All patients had a Pediatric Crohn's Disease Activity Index score of 10 or greater. Among these patients, 5 began treatment with 6-mercaptopurine in the perioperative period. All 10 had received various combinations of prednisone and salicylate compounds. Patients who were given 6-mercaptopurine did not discontinue the medication until 2 years after the surgery. RESULTS: To date, none of the five patients who were placed on 6-mercaptopurine have had recurrence of their Crohn's disease (mean disease-free period 32.6 +/- 18.4 months). Among those five patients not receiving 6-mercaptopurine there have been three relapses (mean time to relapse 3.7 +/- 1.2 months). Log-rank sum analyses of Kaplan-Meier survival curves show benefit to patients receiving 6-mercaptopurine in preventing relapses after intestinal resection (p < 0.05). CONCLUSIONS: Although the underlying pathophysiologic reasons leading to the high relapse rate after intestinal surgery in Crohn's disease are unknown, we conclude that treatment with 6-mercaptopurine in the perioperative period may be warranted to help prevent the recurrence of Crohn's disease after surgery.},

   abstract = {BACKGROUND: Perinuclear antineutrophil cytoplasmic antibodies occur frequently in adult patients with chronic pouchitis after colectomy and ileal pouch-anal anastomosis for ulcerative colitis. The purpose of the study was to determine the prevalence of perinuclear antineutrophil cytoplasmic antibodies and cytoplasmic antineutrophil cytoplasmic antibody in children and adolescents who undergo colectomy and ileal pouch-anal anastomosis for ulcerative colitis and familial adenomatous polyposis. METHODS: Five groups of children and adolescents (age, <20 years) were studied, with the following histories: acute pouchitis and history of ulcerative colitis; chronic pouchitis and history of ulcerative colitis; pouchitis with Crohn's disease features and a history of ulcerative colitis; no pouchitis and a history of ulcerative colitis; and familial adenomatous polyposis, with or without pouchitis. Antineutrophil cytoplasmic antibody levels and titers were detected in postoperative sera by enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay, and positive results were subtyped by indirect immunofluorescence. RESULTS: The frequency of perinuclear antineutrophil cytoplasmic antibodies and cytoplasmic antineutrophil cytoplasmic antibody in patients with a history of ulcerative colitis were 67% and 15%, compared with a 0% presence in patients with familial adenomatous polyposis (p < 0.001). There was no significant correlation between the frequency of perinuclear antineutrophil cytoplasmic antibodies and ulcerative colitis patient subgroups (patients with and without pouchitis, 66% and 75%). Similarly, there was no significant correlation between the frequency of cytoplasmic antineutrophil cytoplasmic antibodies among ulcerative colitis patient subgroups (patients with and without pouchitis, 19% and 8%). The frequency of cytoplasmic antineutrophil cytoplasmic antibody in patients with Crohn's disease features (50%), was increased, but this difference was not significant. CONCLUSIONS: There is a high frequency of perinuclear antineutrophil cytoplasmic antibodies in children and adolescents who undergo ileal pouch-anal anastomosis for ulcerative colitis, whether or not they have pouchitis. The frequency of cytoplasmic antineutrophil cytoplasmic antibody is lower in this patient population. Additional studies will be required to determine whether the presence of cytoplasmic antineutrophil cytoplasmic antibody is associated with the postoperative development of features of Crohn's disease.},

Sister chromatid exchange (SCE) frequencies in peripheral blood lymphocyte cultures from 22 Crohn's disease patients and an equal number of healthy controls matched for sex and age were analyzed. The mean of SCE frequency in Crohn's disease patients was 11.64 +/- 0.42 (SEM) per cell, which was significantly higher than the value of 8.38 +/- 0.22 per cell in the matched controls (p < 0.0001). The Crohn's disease patients showed significantly increased high frequency cells (HFC) as compared to those among the matched controls. There was a significant correlation between HFC frequencies of the Crohn's disease patients and the severity of their disease as determined by the number of relapses per year and the degree of chronic activity after adjusting for the smoking status (r = 0.54, p = 0.011). In both smokers and non-smokers, the mean SCE and HFC frequencies of the patients were significantly higher than those of the controls. These results suggest that Crohn's disease is a condition with increased chromosome instability characterized by a high level of SCE frequencies which are associated with the inflammatory condition itself.},

However, in adolescents with growth failure and when corticosteroid therapy is contra-indicated or has failed, it may become the treatment of choice. Furthermore, dietary therapy allows circumvention of the adverse side-effects of repeated courses of steroids. A number of different hypotheses have been proposed to explain the effect of enteral feeds but none has reached universal acceptance. Prospective trials suggest that the exclusion of whole protein is not necessary. Comparison of feeds with differing composition suggests that a low fat content increases efficacy and various explanations have been offered. The reduction of colonic bacterial load may also be important. Because symptoms of Crohn's disease may be provoked by eating, there is a risk of falsely attributing symptoms to specific foodstuffs. However, in many individuals foods can be identified which affect disease activity, and their exclusion leads to prolongation of disease remission. Dietetic supervision during food testing is important to avoid detrimental effects on nutrient and micronutrient intake.},

The aim of this study was to analyze the safety of AZA and 6-MP and steroid reduction in this age group. METHODS: The investigators' database identified 118 patients who received either drug; 23 were excluded (single visit, noncompliance, or therapy < 1 week), leaving 95 patients, with a mean (+/-SD) age of 14.2 +/- 4.4 years. Medical files were reviewed for adverse side effects: fever, pancreatitis, infections, gastrointestinal intolerance, aminotransferase level increase, leukopenia, and thrombocytopenia. Prednisone doses before and after immunomodulatory therapy were compared. RESULTS: AZA or 6-MP was tolerated in 51 of 95 patients (54%) without adverse reaction; 27 of 95 (28%) experienced side effects that responded to dose reduction (23 patients) or spontaneously (4 patients), most commonly increased aminotransferase level (13.7%). Cessation of therapy was needed in 17 of 95 patients (18%), including recurrent fever (4), pancreatitis (4), gastrointestinal intolerance (4), and recurrent infections (3). Mean prednisone dose decreased from 24.3 to 8.6 mg/day. CONCLUSIONS: AZA and 6-MP were well tolerated in 82% of patients; of these, prednisone reduction occurred in 87%. However, 18% required discontinuation because of hypersensitivity or infectious side effects.},

In hospital for Crohn's disease, twenty-eight patients were given nutritional therapy: 9 patients by TPN, 10 by ED, and 9 by PD. Nutritional state, inflammatory reactions, disease activity and clinical remission rate were assessed two weeks and four weeks after treatment, and morphological findings were assessed before and after each nutritional therapy by radiographic and colonoscopic findings. Inflammatory reactions were more effectively controlled by TPN and ED than by PD, and early improvement achieved by TPN and ED was especially note-worthy. Clinical remission rate after treatment by TPN was highest in three types of nutritional approach, but no significant difference was seen at any point. In nutritional state, disease activity and morphological findings, comparable changes were effected without preference. These results suggest that nutritional therapy by total parenteral nutrition and elemental diet is superior to polymeric diet for treating active phase of Crohn's disease with marked inflammatory reactions.},

METHODS: The prevalence of antibodies for H. pylori in serum was determined in 47 pediatric patients with inflammatory bowel disease (19 with Crohn's disease, 21 with ulcerative colitis, and 7 with unclassified disease). H. pylori antibodies of the IgG and IgA classes were measured by enzyme immunoassay in 24 patients at the time of diagnosis of inflammatory bowel disease and in 23 more patients during the follow-up of inflammatory bowel disease (mean follow-up, 3.5 years; range 1-10 years). Esophagogastroduodenoscopy was performed on 40 patients during the examination for inflammatory bowel disease. RESULTS: In contrast to earlier findings, no patient was determined to be positive for H. pylori, either in serologic or histologic examination. This negative finding was unexpected, because it is known that approximately 10% of asymptomatic Finnish children have antibodies for H. pylori in serum and approximately 10% of analyses of specimens obtained in gastric antral biopsies obtained at the Hospital for Children and Adolescents, Helsinki, Finland, are positive for H. pylori. CONCLUSIONS: Permanent colonization of the stomach with H. pylori is unusual in children with inflammatory bowel disease.},

   abstract = {OBJECTIVES: To cells play a crucial role in many chronic inflammatory diseases. Mucosal T cells are particularly important in the pathogenesis of Crohn's disease (CD). We investigated the response of T cells in CD and other intestinal inflammatory conditions to interleukin-2 (IL-2), a cytokine essential for T-cell activation, growth, and function. STUDY DESIGN: T-cell reactivity was assessed by measuring growth induced by IL-2 in mucosal endoscopic biopsy specimens obtained from children with CD, ulcerative colitis, indeterminate colitis, and chronic nonspecific colitis and from children without gastrointestinal inflammation. RESULTS: CD mucosal T cells grew remarkably and significantly more than T cells from normal, ulcerative colitis, and chronic nonspecific colitis mucosa. T cells from indeterminate colitis mucosa grew similarly to those of CD mucosa. The enhanced growth response in CD was independent of disease location, presence or absence of intestinal inflammation, treatment, disease duration, or clinical activity. CONCLUSION: Mucosal T cells from children with CD exhibit an intrinsic hyperreactivity to IL-2. This may represent a primary pathogenic abnormality in this condition.},

   abstract = {We report the case of a previously healthy 53-year-old white male who developed an extraordinary complication of acute Campylobacter jejuni colitis. Toxic megacolon occurred while the patient was treated with a fluoroquinolone antibiotic and glucocorticoids, which were given for endoscopically suspected Crohn's colitis. During the course of the disease no cause of colitis was found other than C. jejuni. Despite the extreme dilatation, the patient was treated conservatively with parenteral nutrition and repeated decompression colonoscopies and made a full, though slow, and uneventful recovery. Follow-up colonoscopies for up to 4 years showed persistent scarring of the transverse colon, probably due to the extreme dilatation, and mild unspecific inflammation of the terminal ileum without histological evidence of inflammatory bowel disease. A comparison with the 6 previously published cases leads to the following conclusions: in most cases the transverse colon is most severely affected. Treatment with either antimotility agents or systemic glucocorticoids does not seem to promote colonic dilatation. The complication has affected patients of both sexes (4 women, 3 men), in the age range of 21 to 83 years, most of them without an underlying disease. The interval between the start of diarrhea and development of the megacolon ranged widely from 3 to 33 days, as did recovery time (2 days to several months). Three of the 7 patients underwent colectomy for imminent or actual colonic perforation. The delayed recovery of our patient was partly attributed to colonic damage caused by extreme dilatation, leading to ischaemia and subsequent scarring of the mucosa, which persisted. Histologically no Crohn's disease or ulcerative colitis could be found at any stage. A rapid increase in resistance of C. species against fluoroquinolone antibodies has been observed in recent years, due to use of the antibiotics in farming. Our patient's severe illness may partly have resulted from delayed effective antibiotic treatment due to resistance. Antibiotic resistance to common enteropathogens should be considered in the case of unusually prolonged or severe enterocolitis. The level of suspicion for either infection or inflammatory bowel disease should remain high as it may be impossible to distinguish between them on the basis of clinical or endoscopic criteria alone.},

CASE REPORT: An 11-year-old girl with Crohn's disease was given 40 mg/kd/day of sulphasalazine after achieving remission with prednisone. She developed urticaria and eosionophilia 8 days later, then extended skin edema during a second course of sulphasalazine requiring methyl prednisolone therapy. Mesalazine administration (25 mg/kg/day), one month later, resulted to watery stools, vomiting, and fever, a side effect observed again after two further mesalazine challenges of one-month interval. Eosionophilia was present and the lymphocyte stimulation test with mesalazine was positive. Successful desensitization to sulphasalazine could be obtained 9 months later permitting further safe administration of this drug up to 18 months. CONCLUSION: Hypersensitivity to sulphasalazine may be successfully overcame by oral desensitization, especially in those patients with low-grade activity of Crohn's disease.},

PATIENTS AND METHODS: One hundred and fifty pregnancies in 72 women (28 with ulcerative colitis and 44 with Crohn's disease) were compared with those of 150 control subjects. RESULTS: Among 150 pregnancies, 108 (group I) began before and 42 (group II) at the same time or after the diagnosis of inflammatory bowel disease. In ulcerative colitis patients, age at first pregnancy, mean birth weight and preterm birth rates were not different between groups I and II; rate of underweight offsprings was significantly higher (P < 0.05) in group II than in group I and controls. In Crohn's disease, compared to group I, mean age of first pregnancy was higher (P < 0.0001), mean birth weight was lower (P < 0.005) and preterm birth rate was higher (P = 0.001) than in group II.

Little is known about gallbladder motility during prolonged enteral nutrition. METHODS: We studied gallbladder motility during continuous enteral nutrition (CEN) in nine hospitalized patients with active inflammatory bowel disease. The patients received a polymeric diet (2000 kcal/24 h) by CEN through a nasogastric tube for a prolonged period. Gallbladder volumes were obtained daily by ultrasonography, starting from day 0 (before CEN) and on 7 consecutive days during CEN. At days 0, 1, 4, and 7, the gallbladder response to i.v. cholecystokinin (CCK-33; 0.5 Ivy Dog unit/kg/h) was studied. Plasma CCK levels were determined at regular intervals by radioimmunoassay. RESULTS: No significant differences were observed on day 0 between patients and a group of nine healthy control subjects in fasting gallbladder volumes (19.4 +/- 2.3 and 19.6 +/- 2.4 cm3, respectively) and gallbladder contraction during CCK infusion (56 +/- 14% and 69 +/- 7%, respectively). During CEN, from day 1 to day 7, mean gallbladder volume remained significantly (p < 0.05) reduced compared with fasting gallbladder volume, and mean plasma CCK levels remained significantly (p < 0.05) increased compared with fasting levels. Although gallbladder volume was significantly reduced during CEN, the gallbladder contractile response to CCK was not affected; at days 1, 4, and 7, gallbladder contraction was 36-57%. CONCLUSIONS: During CEN, 1) gallbladder volume is significantly reduced and plasma CCK levels are significantly increased, 2) these effects are sustained over time (7 days), and 3) the gallbladder remains responsive to exogenous CCK. These results indicate that gallbladder contractility and gallbladder responsiveness to CCK are preserved during prolonged CEN in patients with inflammatory bowel disease.},

MATERIAL AND METHODS: Pressure monitoring with a double-lumen tube during fluoroscopy-guided adjustment of contrast media instillation rate due to small bowel motility and contrast media transport of 67 patients. Stratification according to patient data and findings in enteroclysis: Crohn's disease (n = 12), non-inflammatory disease (n = 35) and irritable bowel syndrome (n = 20). RESULTS: The amount, instillation period and rate of contrast media and distension media were not statistically different within the study population. Crohn's disease patients showed elevated intraluminal pressure at the end of the distension phase (47.94 +/- 10.42 cm H2O versus 38.03 +/- 10.08 and 39.55 +/- 9.74 cm H2O, respectively, P = 0.0099), as well as at the end of the examination (48.59 +/- 10.42 cm H2O versus 39.66 +/- 6.52 and 35.67 +/- 8.28 cm H2O, P = 0.0002). In comparison with both other patient groups, maximum intraluminal pressure in Crohn's disease is higher and totals 51.75 +/- 9.94 cm H2O versus 43.00 +/- 6.20 and 39.55 +/- 9.74 cm H2O, P = 0.0010. Patients with Crohn's disease require a longer instillation period of distension media (28.05 +/- 12.82 min, not statistically significant). CONCLUSION: Intraluminal pressure differs in standardized enteroclysis with fluoroscopy-guided instillation rate adjustment. Irrespective of stenosis or acute inflammation, patients with Crohn's disease show a higher intraluminal pressure compared to patients with non-inflammatory disease or irritable bowel syndrome.},

Activated protein C (APC) resistance is the most common inherited disorder leading to thrombosis and accounts for 30% to 40% of episodes of idiopathic venous thrombosis. METHODS: The prevalence of APC resistance was studied in 23 patients with IBD (17 with Crohn's disease, 6 with ulcerative colitis) and in 11 control subjects with recurrent abdominal pain or celiac disease, using an APC resistance screening method. RESULTS: One patient with Crohn's disease had a positive screen result, two patients (one with Crohn's, one with ulcerative colitis) had borderline results, and results in all of the control subjects were normal. One patient with Crohn's disease had a history of a thromboembolic event but had a normal screen result. CONCLUSIONS: Activated protein C resistance does not seem to play a major role in the etiology of the hypercoagulable state in inflammatory bowel disease.},

   abstract = {Inflammatory bowel diseases remain a significant chronic disease affecting children and adolescents. Although corticosteroids remain the standard form of therapy for many patients, an era of biological agents for therapy in inflammatory bowel diseases is upcoming with human trials using these agents now forthcoming. In addition, studies on maintenance of remission are beginning to address the selection of those patients most likely to benefit from aminosalicylate therapies, the risks of relapse from using cyclooxygenase inhibitors, the lack of benefit from lipoxygenase inhibitors, and possible future methodologies to examine the effectiveness of the immuno-suppressive agent 6-mercaptopurine. Further development of the hypothesis that new-onset disease may be different than longstanding disease can be appreciated with reports of cytokine analysis in new-onset inflammation and the high risk of progression of disease in new-onset ulcerative proctitis in children. With more reports on the role of intestinal epithelial cells in intestinal diseases, it is now clear that this cell layer is not a passive bystander with regard to the interactions between the luminal contents and immune system components found within the lamina propria; new studies suggest that novel therapeutic strategies may be possible. This review summarizes recently reported aspects of Crohn's disease and ulcerative colitis, with an emphasis on issues-pertinent for younger patients.},

High-dose propofol infusion was associated with reversal of enteral and intravenous warfarin anticoagulation in a 39-year-old woman with severe Crohn's disease. Despite increasing the daily dose of warfarin to 30 mg, anticoagulation was not achieved until propofol was discontinued. Reversal of anticoagulation recurred when PN support was supplemented with Liposyn II 20%. Lipid emulsions may interfere pharmacodynamically with warfarin activity by enhancing the production of clotting factors, facilitating platelet aggregation, or supplying vitamin K. They also may facilitate warfarin binding to albumin. Until further information regarding the mechanism of interference is elucidated, heparin therapy should be considered for initial anticoagulation in patients with intestinal absorptive deficiencies who receive high-dose lipid emulsions and require reliable anticoagulation. If warfarin is given, the international normalized ratio should be monitored daily to ensure adequate anticoagulation.},

METHODS: We retrospectively reviewed the charts of 25 patients with Crohn's disease who underwent surgical or endoscopic gastrostomy tube placement. Additional follow-up information was obtained by contacting the patients by telephone. RESULTS: Twenty-five patients with Crohn's disease underwent either surgical or percutaneous gastrostomy tube placement for prolonged enteral nutrition or gastric decompression after abdominal surgery. Gastrostomies were placed without difficulty in all cases. No major complications occurred after the procedures. Minor complications occurred in five patients, including one case of local wound infection, one case of persistent pain at the gastrostomy site, and three cases of peristomal leakage. These minor complications occurred in 22% of those who underwent percutaneous gastrostomy tube placement and 16% of those who underwent surgical gastrostomy. There was a higher incidence of minor complications in those who underwent gastrostomy for gastrointestinal decompression than in those who underwent the procedure for nutritional supplementation (14% versus 3.5%). A prior history of fistula formation did not predispose to complications related to gastrostomy placement. After gastrostomy tube removal, rapid closure of the site occurred in 96%. No cases of gastrocutaneous fistula formation occurred during follow-up, which ranged from 45 days to 8.7 yr (mean = 2.6 yr). CONCLUSIONS: We conclude that gastrostomy placement is safe in patients with Crohn's disease and does not result in an increased incidence of peristomal disease or formation of prolonged gastrocutaneous fistulas after gastrostomy tube removal.},

   abstract = {Several hypotheses have been proposed to explain the nutritional deficiencies seen in Crohn disease patients, including inadequate food intake, decreased assimilation and increased loss of nutrients, and increased energy expenditure. To assess the effect of steroid therapy on body composition, energy expenditure, and fuel selection in Crohn disease, we compared 12 patients (6 men and 6 women) with biopsy-proven ileal Crohn disease with 11 healthy volunteers (6 men and 5 women). Five patients [Crohn's disease activity index (CDAI) = 98.4 +/- 3.78] took no medication and seven patients (CDAI = 283.9 +/- 22.5) were administered 29 +/- 18 mg prednisone/d. Body composition was evaluated by isotopic dilution and bioelectrical impedance analysis, and 24-h energy expenditure and basal metabolic rate were measured in a respiratory chamber. Fat-free mass was not significantly different among groups, whereas fat mass was lower in patients than in control subjects. Energy intake was higher in treated patients than in both untreated patients (P = 0.004) and control subjects (P = 0.005). Fecal losses were not significantly different between untreated patients and control subjects, but were higher (and proportional to the CDAI) in treated patients than in control subjects (P = 0.001). Metabolizable energy was not significantly different among groups, whereas energy balance was significantly higher in treated patients than in both control subjects (P = 0.0057) and untreated patients (P = 0.018). Nitrogen balance was mildly negative in treated patients compared with both control subjects and untreated patients, but not significantly so. In conclusion, prednisone treatment in Crohn disease patients stimulates food intake, promoting an overall positive energy balance despite large fecal nutrient losses.},

   abstract = {The ability of inflammatory bowel disease (IBD) patients to tolerate dairy products and the guidance they receive from physicians and nutritionists on this subject are important considerations in the management of their IBD. Although most affected persons are able to consume a glass of milk daily without discomfort, additional consideration must be given to specific factors that can be relevant to certain individuals. The declaration by patients that they are "dairy sensitive" may be related to lactose intolerance or malabsorption, the long-chain triacylglycerol content of milk, allergy to milk proteins, as well as psychologic factors and the misconception that dairy products can be detrimental to their health. The prevalence of lactose malabsorption is significantly greater in patients with Crohn disease involving the small bowel than it is in patients with Crohn disease involving the colon or ulcerative colitis. In the latter colonic conditions the prevalence of lactose malabsorption is mainly determined by ethnic risk, which is based on genetic factors. In addition, lactose malabsorption in Crohn disease of the small bowel may be determined by factors other than lactase enzyme activity, such as bacterial overgrowth and/or small bowel transit time. Physicians differ widely in the advice they give their patients: some dogmatically advise avoidance of dairy products when the diagnosis is made whereas others discount the possible role of dairy in the management of IBD. IBD patients avoid dairy products more than they would need to based on the prevalence of lactose malabsorption and/or milk intolerance, probably partly because of incorrect patient perceptions and arbitrary advice from physicians and authors of popular diet books. Adequate scientific and clinical information is now available to permit recommendations about the intake of dairy products for each IBD patient.},

   abstract = {Gut-associated lymphoid tissue is the major inductive site of the mucosal immune system, which is functionally independent of the systemic immune system. Both the amount and type of dietary fat modulate intestinal immune function. Absorption of long-chain fatty acids stimulates lymphocyte flux and lymphocyte blastogenesis in intestinal lymphatics. Long-chain fatty acid absorption also significantly enhances migration of T lymphocytes to Peyer's patches, possibly due to up-regulation of adhesion molecules, such as alpha4-integrin and L-selectin. Lipoproteins are involved in stimulation of lymphocyte function by both receptor-dependent and independent mechanisms. However, unsaturated fatty acids at higher concentrations have a suppressive effect on cell-mediated immunity via eicosanoid release, receptor affinity changes or interactions with intracellular signal transduction. Fat absorption also influences various other cells in the intestinal mucosa: increased cytokine release from intestinal epithelial cells follows long-chain fatty acid absorption. In Crohn's disease, elemental diets and total parenteral nutrition often induce remission, possibly by reducing antigenic load on activated immune cells in the intestine and, thus, down-regulating hyperreactive CD4 cells. Dietary oleic acid supplements caused an immunological reversal effect in the intestinal immune system of animals fed an elemental diet. An excess of long-chain fatty acids in an elemental diet, therefore, may negate its beneficial effect on gut-associated lymphoid tissues in Crohn's disease. In contrast, supplemental dietary fish oil apparently tends to prevent relapse of Crohn's disease. Because dietary fat intake is closely associated with immunological function of the intestinal mucosa, careful manipulation of dietary fat can be important in management of this disease.},

There appears to be no difference between elemental diet, oligopeptide diet and intact nutrients in effectiveness for active Crohn's disease. Although corticosteroid is also useful for treating active Crohn's disease, low dose of it is not effective for maintaining remission. Steroid has important role in combined therapy with elemental diet. New steroid, budesonide appears to be fascinate because of less adverse effects. Recently, instead of salazosulfapyridine, 5-aminosalicylic acid (5-ASA) proved to be more effective not only for active disease but also for maintenance of remission including small intestinal type of Crohn's disease with reduced adverse effects. Azathioprine, 6-mercaptopurine (6-MP), methotrexate and metronidazole are second choice treatment in patients whose disease relapse frequently. Although methotrexate appears to be effective for active Crohn's disease, the role of it has to be defined. Evidences support the use of 5-ASA and methotrexate for prophylaxis after surgery. It is important to chose and combine the therapies, thinking of the situation of each patient.},

Similar activation occurs acutely during the course of invasive intestinal infections such as shigellosis, but is then usually downregulated. The macrophage cytokines tumor necrosis factor-alpha and interleukin-1 (IL-1) are centrally involved in the local inflammatory response, and blockade of either cytokine greatly attenuates the inflammatory lesion. Induction of focal vascular thrombosis and matrix degradation are thought to be an important component of this focal damage. Both cytokines and IL-6 are now recognized to contribute to the systemic effects of intestinal disease, including growth suppression, anorexia, and chronic anemia. Disturbance of sleep patterns, mood, and affect may also occur, and recent evidence points towards bidirectional interplay between macrophage cytokines and central nervous system function.},

   abstract = {Nutritional support currently accounts for about 1% of the total health care costs in the USA. Interestingly, most of the prospective randomized controlled trials to date have not been able to demonstrate that this therapeutic intervention alters morbidity or mortality. In fact, parenteral nutritional support may predispose the recipients to developing systemic infections. There have been a few areas in which nutritional support may be of benefit. Enteral supplements given to underweight women who suffer hip fractures reduce the hospital stay and, presumably, overall cost. Preoperative parenteral nutritional support may produce a small absolute reduction in post-operative morbidity, but its cost becomes prohibitive. Preoperative enteral nutritional support, especially if carried out in the home, may be of benefit (using the most optimistic interpretation of a small number of trials); if so, it is an economically defensible intervention. Particular nutrients or diets may have specific effects on certain disease processes. Indirect comparisons have suggested that elemental diets can be used to treat flares of Crohn's disease (perhaps because putative food antigens are removed). However, corticosteroid therapy is more efficacious. Furthermore, it is less expensive to employ 6-mercaptopurine as the next modality in steroid failures. Branched-chain amino acid infusions may have some effect on hepatic encephalopathy, but again, lactulose is less expensive. Nutritional support is one area of medicine in which there has been far more enthusiasm than the data justify. Disease-associated malnutrition probably is a secondary phenomenon, not an important cause of morbidity. The widespread use of this modality cannot be justified in a cost-constrained health care system.},

This 2-center study examined sera from 102 pediatric patients with inflammatory bowel disease (IBD) to evaluate their diagnostic value and assess their relationship with disease features, distribution, activity and treatment. METHODS: The serum ANCA of 102 children with IBD were measured: 33 UC, 64 CD and 5 UE with various disease locations and degrees of activity. The mean age at the onset of symptoms was 10.7 years (1 to 16.3 years). Sera from 26 unaffected first degree relatives and 20 children without IBD were also investigated. ANCA were detected using indirect immunofluorescence of ethanol-fixed granulocytes. RESULTS: There were ANCA in the sera of 24/33 children with UC (73%), 9/64 with CD (14%) and 4/5 with UE (80%). p-ANCA were more frequent than cytoplasmic-ANCA in positive sera: UC = 67%, CD = 57% and UE = 75%. The presence of ANCA was 73% sensitive and 81% specific for a diagnosis of UC, compared to other IBD (p < 0.001). Three children with proved sclerosing cholangitis associated with UC were all positive. There was no link between ANCA-positive sera and disease activity, or other endoscopic or clinical criteria. ANCA were detected in 4/26 first degree relatives (15%) and in 1/20 control subjects (5%). CONCLUSIONS: Because of their sensitivity and specificity, ANCA may be helpful in the clinical assessment of patients with IBD, and especially those with UC. However, there is no link between the pressure of p-ANCA and the site of UC or its activity, so that it cannot be used to monitor medical treatment or surgical indications.},

Controlled trials have demonstrated that enteral nutrition induces remission rates comparable to that of corticosteroid therapy in Crohn's disease and remains the treatment of choice for specific subgroups such as children with signs of growth impairment and patients with intolerable steroid-induced side effects. The mechanism by which an enteral diet induces remission in Crohn's disease is unclear. Bowel rest, reduced antigenic load, nutritional effects, the provision of trophic amino acids, modification of gut flora, intestinal permeability, or fecal pH have been proposed. Equally, the fat profile of the feed may reduce pro-inflammatory ecosanoid synthesis and thus modify disease activity. Maintaining long-term remission remains a challenge in the management of this disease. Cyclic administration of enteral diets, maintenance drug therapy, fat manipulated formulas, or fish oil therapy may be strategies to prolong diet-induced remission. In the future, nutrient derivatives that play a role in the protective processes of the intestinal mucosa may have application in nutritional therapy in Crohn's disease.},

RESULTS: Twelve patients (8%) developed colonic lesions. Ten-year cumulated risks (95% confidence interval) for colonic extension were 17.2% (range: 5.8-28.6) in the whole group, and 22.4% (range: 8.7-36.1) in the group of 86 patients with repeated colonoscopy. Young age at diagnosis was the only factor predicting colonic extension. Seven patients with colonic extension required immunosuppressive therapy but none underwent surgery. CONCLUSION: Ileal Crohn's disease has a low tendency for colonic extension. Colonic extension has no major prognostic implications.},

   abstract = {The need for a basic epidemiological study, according to international standards, of the prevalence of IBD in Slovakia was increased by the dissolution of Czechoslovakia. This paper presents the results of CD prevalence to 30 April 1994 in Slovakia. To evaluate the statistical data of the prevalence of the disease according to age, sex, regions and districts, the authors employed the multi-dimensional Kruskal-Wallis test and cluster analysis and determined that the prevalence of CD in Slovakia is 6.75/100.000 inhabitants. The distribution differences indicate the need for further investigations of environmental differences. The socio-economic and psychological evaluation of the patients examined revealed some interesting associations. The psychological reaction to the disease is neurotic and depressive and a higher occurrence of affective symptomatology was observed in patients with permanent partnership and with children. On the other hand, the educational level and knowledge concerning the disease on the part of the patient had a positive influence on the reaction to the disease.},

   abstract = {BACKGROUND: Patients with intestinal disease are at risk of developing selenium deficiency due to impaired intestinal absorption. The aim of the present study was to evaluate selenium status and to identify predictive factors of selenium depletion in patients with gastrointestinal disease. METHODS: The concentration of selenium and the activity of glutathione peroxidase in plasma and erythrocytes were measured by fluorometry and by spectrophotometry. Eighty-six patients with Crohn's disease, 40 patients with ulcerative colitis, and 39 patients with various other gastrointestinal diseases were studied. Twenty-seven patients (16%) received home parenteral nutrition. Stool mass, faecal fat, and vitamin B12 absorption were analysed in 100 patients. RESULTS: The plasma selenium concentration was decreased in 85% of the patients receiving supplementary parenteral nutrition and in 20% of the patients receiving oral nutrition, among them in 26% of the patients with Crohn's disease. Almost all patients with ulcerative colitis had normal selenium levels. A statistically significant correlation was found between plasma selenium and vitamin B12 absorption, stool mass, faecal fat excretion, body mass index, P-albumin, P-zinc, and the length of the remaining small bowel. Stepwise regression analyses showed that the strongest predictors of selenium deficiency were stool mass, vitamin B12 absorption, and the length of the small-bowel resection. CONCLUSION: Selenium deficiency is common in patients with severe gastrointestinal disorders. The deficiency is mainly related to malabsorption, and a low selenium level was almost invariably present in patients who needed parenteral supplementation due to gut failure.},

The exact cause of low bone mineral density in Crohn's disease patients has not been determined. The purpose of this study was to assess the incidence of low bone mineral density in premenopausal women with Crohn's disease and to determine the role diet plays in bone mineral density for this population. Bone mineral density of the lumbar spine (L2-L4), proximal femur, and forearm was measured in 51 female controls and 50 females with Crohn's disease using dual energy X-ray absorptiometry (Lunar DPXPlus, Madison, WI). Dietary intake for all Crohn's disease participants was analyzed using both 3-d dietary records and a food frequency questionnaire. When compared to healthy controls, bone mineral density values of Crohn's disease participants were decreased for all sites, particularly the spine (1.169 +/- 0.114, p = 0.054), Ward's area (0.831 +/- 0.128, p = 0.052), and the femoral neck (0.927 +/- 0.100, p = 0.01). Factors associated with lower bone density in Crohn's participants were weight, corticosteroid usage, length and age of diagnosis, history and length of resection, and dietary intakes of magnesium, copper, magnesium, vitamin K, and zinc. The results of this study indicate for the first time that diet plays a role in the development of low bone density in premenopausal women with Crohn's disease.},

AIM: To investigate the pre-illness diet in patients with recent IBD in comparison with matched population and clinic controls. METHODS: Quantified dietary histories were obtained from 87 patients with recent IBD (54 ulcerative colitis (UC) and 33 Crohn's disease (CD)) and 144 controls. Odds ratios (OR) for IBD were derived for intake levels of various foods. RESULTS: A high sucrose consumption was associated with an increased risk for IBD (OR 2.85 (p = 0.03) against population controls and 5.3 (p = 0.00) against clinic controls). Lactose consumption showed no effect while fructose intake was negatively associated with risk for IBD (NS). Similar trends were noted in UC and CD. A high fat intake was associated with an increased risk for UC; this was particularly marked for animal fat (OR 4.09, p = 0.02) and cholesterol (OR 4.57, p = 0.02). A high intake of fluids (p = 0.04), magnesium (p = 0.04), vitamin C, and fruits (NS) was negatively associated with the risk for IBD, while a positive association was found for retinol (p = 0.01). Most of the findings were similar in UC and CD except for potassium and vegetable consumption which showed a negative association only with risk for CD. CONCLUSIONS: An association was found between pre-illness diet and subsequent development of UC and CD. The effect of dietary components may be primary or modulatory.},

   abstract = {OBJECTIVES: The objective of this Review was to locate, appraise and summarise evidence from scientific studies on home parenteral nutrition (HPN) in order to answer specific research questions on the effectiveness of this technology. The following questions were asked. What patients have received HPN? What has been the experience of patients on HPN programmes? How have HPN programmes been organised, and what techniques and equipment have been used, and to what effect? What comparative information is available on effectiveness? What evidence exists for the cost-effectiveness of HPN? What questions about the provision of HPN could be answered with additional research, and what studies would be most suitable? DATA SOURCES: A comprehensive list of studies was provided by an extensive search of electronic databases (including MEDLINE, Embase, Science Citation Index, Uncover, Cinahl, Caredata, Food Science and Technology Abstracts, NTIS, Pascal, Psychlit, and Economic Literature Index), relevant journals (including Journal of Parenteral and Enteral Nutrition, Clinical Nutrition, American Journal of Clinical Nutrition, Nutrition, Clinical Gastroenterology, Nutrition Reviews, Annals of Nutrition and Metabolism, Nutrition and Cancer, Nutrition and Health, and Journal of Paediatric Nutrition and Metabolism), and scanning of reference lists, as well as other search strategies outlined in the protocol. STUDY SELECTION: Studies relevant to the questions were selected. The inclusion criteria were fairly broad because of the quality of the studies located. DATA EXTRACTION: Data extraction forms were used to collect data from studies included in the review. The data was checked by a second researcher to reduce error. DATA SYNTHESIS: Quantitative analysis was difficult owing to the type of studies located. The data is discussed in a qualitative manner. Where complication rates have been given, we have attempted to combine the results in a quantitative manner. RESULTS: The age and sex of patients on HPN varies according to the underlying disease but, on the whole, patients are young (see Tables 4a and 4b). There are trends showing an increased use of the technology at the extremes of the age range. There are marked differences between countries on the underlying diseases for which HPN is indicated. For example, many more patients with an underlying malignancy are treated in Italy and the USA than in the UK (40-67% versus 8%). Morbidity rates for the majority of patients are acceptable (see Table 8), the complications tend to be related to the central venous catheter. It is fairly clear that a minority of patients are susceptible to recurrent problems and that many patients have very few complications. The mortality rate for HPN patients (see Table 10) was good for those patients with benign underlying disease (for example, 5% of Crohn's HPN patients die per year), and there are very few reports of patients dying from complications of the technology. The survival of those with malignant disease and AIDS is poor, almost all having died from the underlying disease at one year; despite this, most programme growth worldwide is due to an increase in the numbers of patients with these diagnoses (see Table 5). Quality of life is reasonable for patients with benign disease (see Table 9); no studies were found that examined the quality of life of HPN patients with malignant disease. Economic analysis shows that the cost of HPN treatment is cheaper than the alternative of in-patient care (see Table 18). There is a paucity of comparative studies examining different aspects of the technology, and this accounted for the majority of gaps in the evidence. CONCLUSIONS: The use of HPN for benign intestinal failure is supported by evidence from the scientific studies located. There are, however, large gaps in the evidence, particularly relating to the use of HPN in malignant disease and AIDS. A programme of research is suggested at the end of this review.},

   abstract = {BACKGROUND: A study was performed to measure the quality of life of patients receiving home parenteral nutrition (HPN). Quality of life is an important determinant of the effectiveness of health technologies, but it has rarely been assessed in patients receiving HPN. AIMS: To measure quality of life and highlight any moderating factors. PATIENTS AND METHODS: Quality of life was measured using two validated instruments (SF 36 and EuroQol) in 51 patients with intestinal failure. All patients had benign disease, the commonest being Crohn's disease (n = 35). RESULTS: HPN patient scores were worse for six of eight SF 36 domains (p < 0.05) compared with standard population scores. Younger patients (< 45) had good scores but older patients (> 55 years) scored significantly less. Patients addicted to narcotic substances had very low scores. EuroQol utility scores confirmed the SF results. Forty one patients reported that they felt too ill to work and only five were in full time work or education. CONCLUSIONS: The health status profile of our young patients on HPN was good compared with the normal population. The poorest scores were in older patients and those dependent on narcotic drugs. This has clinical and economic relevance when considering such patients for HPN.},

DESIGN: All publications from refereed journals which reported intakes of sugars and sugar-containing foods in the context of Crohn's disease onset or treatment were selected. CONCLUSION: Evidence suggesting a relationship between sugars and onset of Crohn's disease was inconsistent and subject to important methodological limitations. There was a clear lack of distinction between reporting of current, as opposed to, retrospective intakes. There appeared to be no clinical advantage to the use of reduced sugar diets in Crohn's disease treatment.},

   abstract = {PURPOSE: A retrospective chart review of 20 consecutive patients with 23 anal fistulas treated with cutaneous advancement flap closure was undertaken to ascertain the efficacy of this previously unreported technique. METHODS: The so-called "diamond" and "house" flaps are commonly used to treat anal stenosis, and mucosal advancement flaps are successfully used to close fistulas. The authors began, in 1994, to close selected fistulas with skin advancement flaps after suture closure of the internal opening and adequate drainage of the external opening. Fourteen patients (4 females; average age, 42 years; a total of 14 fistulas) without inflammatory bowel disease and 6 patients (3 females; average age, 35 years) with inflammatory bowel disease (5 with Crohn's disease; 1 with chronic ulcerative colitis; a total of 8 fistulas) were treated. Indications were low internal opening with transsphincteric fistula in both groups. Mucosal advancement was relatively contraindicated, either because of fear of ectropion or, in the inflammatory bowel disease patients, diseased mucosa. No one in the noninflammatory bowel disease group was diverted or kept without anything by mouth, and all were treated as outpatients or with overnight observation. The inflammatory bowel disease group was either diverted (1 patient) or kept on home total parenteral nutrition (5 patients) for three to six weeks. Cyclosporine, antibiotics, 5-acetylsalicylic acid, and other medications were used judiciously in the inflammatory bowel disease group. RESULTS: In the noninflammatory bowel disease group, complete healing of all wounds occurred in 11 patients in an average of 6.5 weeks (average follow-up, 18 months). Complications included donor site separation in two patients and minor incontinence of flatus in one patient. In the inflammatory bowel disease group, five fistulas healed, two failed, and one patient developed a new fistula during an average follow-up of 16 months. Deep venous thrombosis and catheter sepsis occurred in one patient in this group. There were no fatalities in either group. CONCLUSIONS: Although the numbers, especially in the inflammatory bowel disease group, are very small, the results are encouraging. This technique appears to have a place in the armamentarium of the surgeon repairing anal fistulas.},

   abstract = {The vermilion of the lips was conceptualized by Jean Darier as the semi-mucosa. The anatomy of the lips is transitional from skin to mucous membrane. This article emphasizes inflammatory diseases of the lips known as cheilitis. Angular cheilitis is a reactive process with several possible causes, including infections, mechanical, nutritional deficiency, and various dermatoses. Contact cheilitis may be caused by a primary irritant or a delayed hypersensitivity allergic reaction to contactants. Plasma cell cheilitis is a reactive periorificial mucositis. Exfoliative cheilitis is also a reactive process, probably secondary to factitious activity of the patient. Cheilitis glandularis is a chronic inflammatory disorder of the labial salivary glands and their ducts. There are three forms: simple, superficial suppurative, and deep suppurative. A premalignant potential is present in cheilitis glandularis. Cheilitis granulomatosa is one manifestation of orofacial granulomatosis. The granulomatous conditions of Melkersson-Rosenthal syndrome, sarcoidosis, and Crohn's disease may be associated with cheilitis granulomatosa or it may stand alone as Miescher's cheilitis. Actinic cheilitis is another premalignant form of cheilitis that is amenable to a variety of therapeutic modalities.},

   abstract = {BACKGROUND & AIMS: Accurate serological assays are desirable for the diagnosis of inflammatory bowel disease (IBD) types in the pediatric age group. The aim of this study was to test the diagnostic accuracy of modified assays for perinuclear (p) antineutrophil cytoplasmic antibodies (ANCAs) and anti-Saccharomyces cerevisiae antibodies (ASCAs) in patients with pediatric ulcerative colitis (UC) and Crohn's disease (CD) and in those without IBD. METHODS: With observers blinded to patients' diagnoses, serum specimens were analyzed for immunoglobulin (Ig) A and IgG ASCAs and ANCAs by enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay. The perinuclear location of ANCAs visualized by indirect immunofluorescence was confirmed by its disappearance after administration of deoxyribonuclease. RESULTS: IgA and IgG ASCA titers were significantly greater and highly specific for CD (95% for either, 100% if both positive). pANCA was 92% specific for UC and absent in all non-IBD controls. The majority of patients with CD positive for pANCA had a UC-like presentation. Disease location, duration, activity, complications, and treatment with immunosuppressive drugs did not have an impact on the ASCA or pANCA assay results. After resection, UC patients remained pANCA positive, in contrast to patients with CD, in whom ASCA titers decreased toward normal values postoperatively. CONCLUSIONS: ASCA and pANCA assays are highly disease specific for CD and UC, respectively. These serological tests can assist clinicians in diagnosing and categorizing patients with IBD and may be useful in making therapeutic decisions.},

Most of these studies concern adolescent patients. METHODS: The growth of 47 prepubertal children (20 boys and 27 girls, mean age at diagnosis 7 years) with inflammatory bowel disease was studied at Tampere University Hospital, Department of Paediatrics. The mean height and height velocity standard deviation scores were calculated at diagnosis and, after that, yearly. The cumulative doses of oral and rectal prednisone per year were calculated. The severity of the disease was scored. The statistical analysis was carried out using the analysis of variance for repeated measurements. RESULTS: During the year preceding the diagnosis, children with inflammatory bowel disease had grown more slowly than their healthy peers. At diagnosis, they were slightly shorter as a group than are healthy children. During treatment and follow-up the mean height velocity of children with inflammatory bowel disease increased (change in the mean height velocity standard deviation scores from -0.84 to +1.08), normalizing the mean heights of these children compared with those of their healthy peers (change in the mean height standard deviation scores from -0.32 to +0.05). In the analysis of covariance, the poorest growth was seen in children with Crohn's disease, scored as severe, and the best growth in children with mild ulcerative colitis. No difference was seen in groups with or without prednisone treatment. CONCLUSIONS: Growth retardation is an important sign of chronic inflammatory bowel disease in prepubertal as well as adolescent children. During treatment, increasing growth velocity brings these children as a group to normal heights for age and sex.},

   abstract = {Because home total parenteral nutrition (TPN) is not available to most of the Brazilian population, an alternative treatment for short bowel syndrome was evaluated. Four patients ages 40-65 y (mean: 53.75 +/- 10.59), three with mesenteric thrombosis, and one with Crohn's disease were studied. The average length of the remaining small bowel in these patients was 54.5 +/- 6.4 cm; the ileocecal valve was preserved in 3 cases. A progressive step diet was used for intestinal adaptation. Administration of pectin was started at the beginning of the special oral diet (step 1), followed by medium-chain triacylglycerols (MCTs) and complex, nonfermentable sugars (step 2); coconut oil (47% MCTs) and simple sugars (step 3); and long-chain triacylglycerols and lactose (step 4). TPN was interrupted at step 3 or 4 when the energy content of the diet reached 150% of the patient's resting energy expenditure, if serum albumin and weight were stable or increasing, and if the frequency, amount, and consistency of stools remained unchanged. Nutritional follow-up showed that patients responded well to this approach; also, patients returned to their previous professional activities. Thus, enteral formulas were not essential for gastrointestinal adaptation. Home TPN should not be indicated on the basis of strict criteria, but rather when a patient fails to adapt to a progressive, special oral diet.},

   abstract = {High-dose corticosteroids remain the gold standard of therapy in acute Crohn's disease, but is associated with a variety of side effects. Nutritional therapy could be an interesting alternative, but corticosteroids are meant to be significantly superior according to efficacy. Published studies, identified by references, MEDLINE and meta-analysis, were evaluated for efficacy of nutritional therapy in acute Crohn's disease. In 18 evaluable of 38 identified publications, 571 patients were treated with nutritional therapy: 295 received elemental diet, 214 oligopeptide diet and 62 polymeric diet. Remission rates were 60%, 55% and 66% respectively. However, only intention-to-treat-analysis was performed in all the studies. When correcting for patients who really were treated with nutritional therapy, remission rates were substantially better: 73%, 70% and 67% respectively, thus comparable with that of corticosteroids. Positive predictors for successful treatment were stenosing disease and low ESR. Remission seems to last as long as after corticosteroid treatment, when a reinduction diet is performed. Negative aspects of nutritional therapy are poor tolerance and higher costs. Perspectives for the future aim on broadening of indications, improving acceptance (by adjuvant instead of exclusive nutrition, or new flavors) and efficacy by modification of compounds (such as glutamine, omega-3 fatty acids or trace elements) or combination with other therapeutic agents (e.g., mesalamine).},

The association of osteoporosis and the development of vertebral compression fractures is well delineated. This case report describes 5 pediatric patients with Crohn's disease in whom vertebral compression fractures associated with a marked reduction in bone density developed. As in adults, the association of osteoporosis and Crohn's disease in pediatric patients is multifactorial, including corticosteroid use, calcium and vitamin D homeostasis, malnutrition, alteration in sex hormones, and site of disease. At the time of diagnosis of the vertebral fractures, the patients' ages ranged from 10.6 to 16.8 years, they had persistent and severe back pain, and 3 of 5 patients had a decrease in height. They were taking 13.7-41.6 mg/day of corticosteroid, and all 5 patients had terminal ileal involvement. Bone mineral density measured by dual-energy x-ray absorptiometry was well below 2SD from the mean in all patients (z-score, -2.31 to -5.11). Because of the high morbidity and mortality associated with fractures that result from low bone mineral density, medical care of all pediatric patients with Crohn's disease should include an evaluation of bone mineral density.},

The course of these entities is typified by periods of symptomatic exacerbation interspersed with clinical remissions. Management is based upon regimens which decrease mucosal inflammation. Colonic disease distal to the splenic flexure may be treated with topical therapy, but other regions generally necessitate oral therapy. Currently used medications include the aminosalicylates, glucocorticoids, antibiotics and immunomodulators. The immunomodulator class of medications includes azathioprine, 6-mercaptopurine, cyclosporine A and methotrexate. Newer agents include short-chain fatty acids, omega-3 fatty acids and antibodies directed to tumor necrosis factor. Medical management also occasionally involves optimizing nutritional status with the addition of elemental diets or total parenteral nutrition. Management of specific clinical presentations is discussed.},

   abstract = {In adult cases with Crohn's disease, treatment of both the disease and patients' social lives is required for therapeutic regimens. Therefore, we assessed the safety and effectiveness of home enteral nutrition using PEG in patients with adult Crohn's disease. Five patients who were diagnosed with Crohn's disease undergoing a domiciliary treatment with enteral nutrition using PEG in The Jikei University School of Medicine and related institutions from May, 1994, to July, 1998, were the subjects of this study. All patients were relieved of symptoms and returned to work, one of whom relapsed two years later to undergo reoperation. Improvements of nutritional status and almost complete disappearance of inflammatory response were found in all patients. As for PEG-related complications, there was one case complicated with wound infection at an early time, and late complications, included two cases with abnormal granulation and one case with pain in ambient PEG. However, neither major complications nor complications that hindered everyday living were observed. Results of a questionnaire relating to this regimen showed almost complete well-being, though there were complaints about limited of oral intake and the cumbersome procedure of enteral nutrition. In conclusion, home enteral nutrition using PEG is effective in maintaining relief of symptoms, both the time required for feeding and patient pain are less, patients can be readily socially rehabilitated, and complications related to PEG have been few. These suggest that it may become a beneficial measure for patients with adult Crohn's disease.},

A second upper gastrointestinal tract X-ray revealed a persistent gastric outlet obstruction. At laparotomy, the duodenal wall was found to be thickened over a distance measuring 3.5 cm in length from the pyloric ring. A longitudinal incision was made over the entire length, up to 5.5 cm beyond the pyloric ring on either side, while Finney-type anastomosis was also performed. A postoperative upper gastrointestinal tract X-ray showed an improvement in the gastroduodenal passage. Enteral nutrition therapy was provided postoperatively. Omeprazole was administered at a dose of 20 mg/day for 2 months. The patient currently remains on maintenance therapy with famotidine at 20 mg/day and is clinically doing well.},

MATERIALS AND METHODS: Duplex Doppler sonographic measurements of SMA bloodflow volume were obtained in 90 patients with suspected or known Crohn's disease in three separate studies. The first study was a pilot study to ascertain the value of Doppler measurements in patients with proven active or inactive disease and to check our performance. In two following studies prospectively a correlation was sought between the independent assessment of Doppler flow measurements and our standard of reference based on clinical history, physical examination, laboratory values, endoscopy, surgery and/or follow-up and prospectively a correlation was sought between Doppler studies and the results of enteroclysis. RESULTS: In all but two patients (study II) adequate measurements of SMA flow were obtained. In the active patient groups the Doppler SMA flow was significantly increased (P < 0.05) compared to the inactive patient groups and the control groups. CONCLUSION: These studies show that SMA Doppler flow measurements can be used as a parameter to assess disease activity in patients with Crohn's disease.},

   abstract = {The aim of therapy in Crohn's disease in childhood is to induce and to maintain a remission of disease activity so that normal growth and development of the child may occur. Enteral nutrition may now be recommended as the first-line treatment for most children with Crohn's disease. However, the evidence for remission is better for children with Crohn's disease of the small intestine rather than of the large intestine. There is evidence that amino acid feeds (elemental), whole protein (polymeric) and protein hydrolysate feeds (semi-elemental) may all be successful. Such a therapeutic approach can lead to healing of the mucosa and down-regulation of inflammation. However, in some cases surgery is required, particularly in children with growth failure and delayed puberty. Drug therapy also continues to have a role in therapy especially with severe colonic disease.},

CASE HISTORY: A 42-year-old woman with severe Crohn's disease presented with septic shock and pulmonary embolism three weeks after emergency laparotomy and ileocolic resection for small-bowel perforation with peritonitis. Cardiopulmonary evaluation with ECG, pulmonary artery catheter and TEE demonstrated no evidence of acute myocardial ischemia or ventricular dysfunction; hemodynamic indices were consistent with severe sepsis. TEE revealed a large sheathing thrombus surrounding a central venous catheter used for parenteral nutrition. A spiral CT scan of the chest confirmed multiple peripheral pulmonary emboli. Treatment consisted of systemic anticoagulation and antibiotics. To avoid further pulmonary embolism, the central venous catheter was not removed until six days later under TEE monitoring, which revealed that the thrombus was firmly adherent to the superior vena cava. The patient made an uneventful recovery and was discharged from hospital on long-term anticoagulant therapy. CONCLUSION: In a case of catheter-induced superior vena cava thrombosis with septicemia and pulmonary embolism, bedside TEE was very helpful to make the correct diagnosis early, assess thrombus size during anticoagulation, and monitor cardiac performance and thrombus disposition during central venous catheter removal.},

   abstract = {It is currently held that the pathogenesis of inflammatory bowel disease (IBD) involves a complex interaction of host responses, some immunologic and genetically determined, and external influences including microbial and dietary factors. Nutritional surveys and studies testing stepwise exclusion dietary compounds have suggested that dietary factors might be linked to the occurrence of IBD. Food allergy was suggested early as a possible trigger for the inflammatory response; however, no firm evidence has been gathered over the years to substantiate this possibility. The possibility that patients with Crohn's disease may have an unusual premorbid pattern of dietary intake has also been examined since the early seventies. Several groups of investigators report a high intake of refined sugars (i.e. sucrose), recycled cooking oil, a more frequent consumption of fast foods in patients with Crohn's disease and ulcerative colitis respectively. However, a critical comparison of incidence and prevalence studies published from 1976 until 1994 clearly showed no pre-existing nutritional abnormality that has been identified consistently in patients who develop inflammatory bowel disease.},

However, there is no documented standardized medical regimen for treatment of these patients. We report five cases of esophageal Crohn's disease as well as a review of the literature emphasizing therapeutic approach and increased incidence of corticosteroid dependence in these patients. In the past, patients with significant esophageal disease and symptoms have been surgical candidates. We recommend that all patients with symptoms of dysphagia, odynophagia, chest pain, or dyspepsia with documented esophageal Crohn's disease should receive H2 receptor antagonists as part of their medical regimen. In addition, immunosuppressant agents should be considered as adjuvant therapy in steroid-dependent patients with esophageal disease involvement.},

In addition, various novel etiologies that have been described lately in the medical literature are illustrated. Next, this paper discusses two examples of pancreatic disorders associated with systemic manifestations, i.e., ganglioneuromatosis and diabetes mellitus. Finally, a few rare genetic syndromes with pancreatic involvement are touched upon, an association that is not very well recognized. Cystic fibrosis is not covered.},

Some forms of HBLP have been shown to be due to truncated forms of apoB-100. A total of 3873 subjects participating in the Framingham Offspring Study had LDL-C levels measured every 4 to 5 years throughout a 25-year period. Seventy-five subjects were identified with persistent HBLP, defined as an LDL-C <70 mg/dL on at least 2 observations, for a prevalence of 1.9% in this population. Compared with subjects with LDL- C >/=70 mg/dL, subjects with HBLP had significantly lower mean levels of total cholesterol, LDL-C, triglyceride, and apoB; higher levels of high density lipoprotein cholesterol; and a higher prevalence of the E2/E3 genotype: 38.7% versus 10.9% (P<0.001). Men with HBLP had a larger mean LDL particle size than did men with an LDL- C >/=70 mg/dL. One individual had a truncated apoB as a cause of HBLP, for a prevalence of 0.03%. Medical causes of HBLP included 2 cases of Crohn's disease, 1 of hemochromatosis, and 1 of hepatitis. Three subjects with HBLP developed coronary heart disease, for an incidence of 4% compared with 5% in those with an LDL- C >/=70 mg/dL (P=NS). The incidence of cancer was 8% in those with HBLP compared with 4% in those with an LDL-C >/=70 mg/dL (P=0.21). In conclusion, a truncated apoB was a rare cause of HBLP, whereas the E2/E3 genotype was a much more common cause. A large prospective study is needed to evaluate the incidence of cancer and atherosclerosis in subjects with HBLP.},

We recently validated a HRQOL questionnaire in French patients with inflammatory bowel disease. The aim of this study was to evaluate prospectively the impact of surgery on HRQOL in patients operated on for Crohn's disease (CD). METHODS: Twenty-six patients (14 women, 12 men; median age 28.5 yr) undergoing an elective ileocolonic resection for CD were studied. The HRQOL questionnaire comprised a general questionnaire of 36 items (Medical Outcomes Study-Short Form 36), to which was added a sleep module, and a specific questionnaire of 28 items (Rating Form of Inflammatory Bowel Disease Patient Concerns), to which were added three independent items because of their pertinence in the French population. HRQOL was assessed immediately preoperatively and 3 months postoperatively. RESULTS: HRQOL was improved postoperatively compared with the immediate preoperative status in almost all scales. Patient concerns and worries decreased after surgery. However, ranking was unchanged for the five most intense concerns: having an ostomy bag, having surgery, energy level, uncertainty of the disease, and pain or suffering. CONCLUSIONS: HRQOL is greatly improved after surgery for CD, and this reassuring message might be delivered to our patients. In addition, the questionnaire showed the ability to detect clinical changes over time. This attests to its potential use in research.},

An overshooting immune response with T cell activation in the local gut associated immune system seems to be central in the etiopathogenesis of IBD. Modulation of the antigenic load in the gut lumen by parenteral or enteral nutrition or antibiotic treatment can alter disease activity. Immunosuppressive drugs are able to decrease the overshooting immune response. Azathioprin has its clear value in chronic active steroid dependent disease courses of Crohn's disease. According to recent studies, Methotrexate seems to be active as well, however, more studies are necessary. Several studies were not able to prove that Cyclosporine is of value in the treatment of Crohn's disease. Newer preparations of aminosalicylates have shown effectiveness in both active disease and prolongation of remission in Crohn's disease in high doses. Local release formulations of steroids with high first-pass-effect as Budesonide will have their indication in subgroups of IBD patients. However, systemic steroid application is still the gold standard in active disease.},

METHODS: Twenty-two patients (12 males, median age 30 years, range 18-60) with moderately active Crohn's disease were enrolled in a randomized study in which the efficacy of an elemental diet administered orally was compared to high-dose corticosteroids in achieving clinical and laboratory remission. Ten patients were treated by oral elemental diet (Peptamen, Clintec, USA) and 10 received corticosteroids. Both treatment regimens lasted 2 weeks. The two groups did not differ with respect to age, sex, body weight, location of disease, treatment or disease activity prior to the study. In all patients studied, simple Crohn's disease activity index, nutritional status (expressed as body mass index), percentage of ideal body weight, fat mass, fat free mass, erythrocyte sedimentation rate, interleukin-6, intestinal permeability (expressed as permeability index), prealbumin, retinol binding protein and multiskin test were evaluated before and after treatment. RESULTS: After 2 weeks of treatment, there were significant improvements in simple Crohn's disease activity index, erythrocyte sedimentation rate, permeability index, body mass index, prealbumin, retinol binding protein and multiskin test in the elemental diet group. There were significant improvements in simple Crohn's disease activity index and fat free mass in the corticosteroid group. CONCLUSIONS: These data suggest that, in the short term, an oral elemental diet is at least as effective as steroids in inducing remission of mild-moderately active Crohn's disease, but it may be more effective in improving the nutritional status of these patients, probably through a more rapid restoration of normal intestinal permeability.},

AIMS: To evaluate the effects of long term administration of long chain triglyceride emulsions on reticuloendothelial system function. METHODS: Splenic function and tuftsin activity were measured in 20 patients on intravenous nutrition for intestinal failure, 20 patients with Crohn's disease who were not receiving intravenous nutrition, and 50 healthy controls. RESULTS: Pitted red cells counts in patients on intravenous nutrition (8.0%) were significantly higher (p<0.001) than in healthy controls (0.6%) and in patients with Crohn's disease (0.9%). No difference was found between healthy controls and patients with Crohn's disease. There was a correlation (r=0.50; p<0.03) between percentage of pitted red cells and duration of intravenous nutrition. Tuftsin activity was significantly reduced in the intravenous nutrition patient group (6%) compared with both disease controls (16.5%, p<0.01) and healthy volunteers (17.8%, p<0.001). An inverse correlation between tuftsin activity and pitted red cell percentage was found in the patients on intravenous nutrition (r(s) =-0.44, p<0.05). No relation was found in the patients on intravenous nutrition between pitted red cell percentage or tuftsin activity and type of disease, percentage of ideal body weight, residual length of small intestine, or administration (quantity and frequency) of lipid emulsion. Eight patients on intravenous nutrition had serious infections within the previous 12 months. CONCLUSIONS: Patients with a short bowel treated with long term intravenous nutrition have impaired splenic function, reduced tuftsin activity, and an increased risk of infection.},
