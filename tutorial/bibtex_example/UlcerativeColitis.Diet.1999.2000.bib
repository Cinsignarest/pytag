   abstract = {It has been postulated that patients with ulcerative colitis (UC) have altered reactivity of gut-associated lymphoid tissue. In such cases there is intense infiltration of the mucosa with immune competent cells and associated tissue damage. We have shown previously that the dietary supplementation with the n-3 polyunsaturated fatty acids (n-3 PUFAs), eicosapentaenoic acid (EPA), and docosahexaenoic acid (DHA) results in significant systemic immune suppression. The aim of this study, therefore, was to evaluate the in situ effect of n-3 PUFAs on distal proctocolitis. Each patient received either fish oil extract (EPA 3.2 g, DHA 2.4 g) (n = 9) or sunflower oil (n = 9) daily in a double blind manner for six months. Monthly assessment included: (1) disease activity using clinical, sigmoidoscopic, and histological scores and (2) immunohistochemical analysis (immunoglobulins, CD profiles) of rectal biopsy specimens (before and after six months supplementation) using monoclonal antibodies and quantitative computer-assisted video image analysis. Prior to receiving supplementation, patients with proctocolitis (n = 18) showed significantly higher numbers of cells expressing CD3 (pan T cells) and HLA-DR and IgM containing cells compared with non-colitic controls (n = 8). Six months supplementation with n-3 PUFAs resulted in significant reduction in the number of cells expressing CD3 and HLA and the percentage of cells containing IgM. There was no significant change in the CD20 nor the percentage of IgG or IgA containing cells in either group of patients with procto-colitis. In patients receiving n-3 PUFA supplementation, there was improvement in the disease activity and histological scores, compared with pretreatment evaluation. This study has demonstrated both evidence of suppression of in situ immune reactivity and concurrent reduction in disease activity in patients with proctocolitis receiving n-3 PUFA supplementation. This may have important implication for therapy in patients with ulcerative colitis.},

   abstract = {Environmental factors play an important role in the pathophysiology of inflammatory bowel disease. There is a strong and consistent association between smoking and Crohn's disease, and between nonsmoking and ulcerative colitis. Despite extensive research, the exact pathophysiological mechanisms for these associations remain unclear. In spite of this, some clinical trials with nicotine-patches showed beneficial effects for the treatment of ulcerative colitis. Associations of Crohn's disease and ulcerative colitis with other environmental factors are weaker like the association with use of oral contraceptives or those less well investigated such as the association with childhood hygiene. Most studies suggesting a potential pathogenetic role of Mycobacterium paratuberculosis or an effect of tuberculostatic therapy in Crohn's disease could not be reproduced by others. Perinatal or childhood infections by viruses like measles are heavily debated, but not proven to be causal for inflammatory bowel disease. Coagulation disorders have been described as protecting from inflammatory bowel disease, suggesting hypercoagulability to be a pathogenetic factor. Some studies described that appendectomy may prevent the onset of ulcerative colitis in man and mice. Other environmental factors such as hydrogen sulfide, tonsillectomy, diet, blood transfusions, and Listeria also require confirmation. There are, however, convincing data from genetic animal models and twin studies that environmental factors as the intestinal bacterial flora interact with susceptible hosts to cause inflammatory bowel disease. Inflammatory bowel diseases have multifactorial etiologies, which require a differentiated approach for treatment and prevention.},

The first evidence of the importance of dietary intake of n-3 polyunsaturated fatty acids was derived from epidemiologic observations of the low incidence of inflammatory bowel disease in Eskimos. The aim of this paper was to briefly review the literature on the use of n-3 fatty acids in inflammatory bowel disease (ulcerative colitis and Crohn disease), the results of which are controversial. The discrepancies between studies may reside in the different study designs used as well as in the various formulations and dosages used, some of which may lead to a high incidence of side effects. Choosing a formulation that lowers the incidence of side effects, selecting patients carefully, and paying strict attention to experimental design are critical when investigating further the therapeutic potential of these lipids in inflammatory bowel disease.},

It is anticipated that natural antioxidants are involved in this effect in addition to other substances. The aim of this study was to determine levels of vitamins A, C and E, as well as beta-carotene, selenium, zinc and copper in blood of 249 patients with precancerous lesions (atrophic gastritis, gastric hyperplastic polyp, gastric, colonic and rectal adenoma, chronic ulcerative colitis) and in 96 individuals with gastric, colonic or rectal carcinoma and to compare these levels with the values of a control group of 130 healthy individuals. We have found that the frequency of average values of analyzed micronutrients in precancerous groups was decreasing in the order vit C > vit E/vit A > Se > beta-car. The average levels of vitamins and beta-carotene were significantly reduced in all carcinoma groups, while selenium level showed a decrease only in the gastric carcinoma group. Copper level was elevated in the ulcerative colitis group and in all groups with carcinoma. The results indicate a frequent insufficient saturation of organism by natural antioxidants in groups with precancerous lesions and carcinomas of stomach and colorectum. Therefore, it is necessary to increase the general consumption of fruits and vegetables in Slovakia as a part of primary prevention of malignant diseases in these organs. Chemoprevention may be recommended in individuals with precancerous lesions.},

   abstract = {There have frequently been doubts as to the relevance of food allergy, in particular as far as the involvement of the intestinal tract is concerned. Several studies, however, have confirmed the existence of allergic reactions in the gut, with an estimated prevalence of about 1-2% in adults. Clinical symptoms are unspecific and include nausea, vomiting, abdominal pain, cramping and diarrhea. Intestinal mast cells, as well as intestinal eosinophils, have been shown to be involved in the pathogenesis of food-allergy-related enteropathy. In addition to classical IgE-dependent degranulation, further agonists have been demonstrated for mast cell activation, for example IL-4. The methods used to confirm the diagnosis of intestinal allergy are still insufficient. Until now, blinded oral challenge procedures with food antigens have been accepted as the 'gold standard' in diagnosing food allergy, although these tests have practical problems. Therefore, new test systems have been developed, such as endoscopic provocation tests, that may improve diagnostic procedures. Elimination diet still presents the main basis of therapy. Aspects to be focused on in the future are the role fo IgE-independent allergic mechanisms in intestinal allergy, the impact of cross-reactivity with other allergens and the relationship to other inflammatory bowel diseases such as Crohn's disease, ulcerative colitis, celiac disease and irritable bowel syndrome.},

   abstract = {BACKGROUND: Antisecretory factor (AF), a 41 kDa cloned and sequenced protein, suppresses intestinal inflammation and hypersecretion in animals. Endogenous AF production can be induced by dietary modifications in several animal species, and this feed has been shown to reduce the incidence of diarrhoeal disease in weaning piglets. The role of AF in intestinal disease in humans is not known. AIMS: To study the effects of hydrothermally processed cereals, optimised for AF induction in animals, added to the diet of patients with longstanding symptoms of inflammatory bowel disease (IBD). PATIENTS: Fifty three patients with IBD (ulcerative colitis and Crohn's disease) were entered into the study, and 50 completed follow up. The experimental group consisted of 16 females (mean age 50 (SEM 5) years) and 10 males (41 (4) years) and the placebo group of 12 women (41 (4) years old) and 12 men (51 (5) years). METHODS: Patients were randomised to receive either hydrothermally processed cereals (active treatment) or the same amount of ordinary cereals (placebo treatment) for four weeks in a double blind study design. Baseline diet and medications remained unchanged. Bowel symptoms, plasma levels of AF, and colonic biopsies were evaluated before and after treatment. RESULTS: The active treatment significantly improved subjective ratings of clinical symptoms and increased plasma AF levels compared with placebo. Plasma lipid levels were unaffected. CONCLUSION: Hydrothermally processed cereals can induce AF production in human IBD. This increase in endogenous AF activity is associated with clinical improvement. Further studies are warranted to clarify the exact role of AF in human intestinal disease.},

   abstract = {Short chain fatty acids (SCFAs) are the end products of anaerobic bacteria break down of carbohydrates in the large bowel. This process, namely fermentation, is an important function of the large bowel; SCFAs, mainly acetate, propionate and butyrate account for approximately 80% of the colonic anion concentration and are produced in nearly constant molar ratio 60:25:15. Among their various properties, SCFAs are readily absorbed by intestinal mucosa, are relatively high in caloric content, are metabolized by colonocytes and epatocytes, stimulate sodium and water absorption in the colon and are trophic to the intestinal mucosa. While the fermentative production of SCFAs has been acknowledged as a principal mechanism of intestinal digestion in ruminants, the interest in the effects of SCFAs production on the human organism has been raising in the last ten years. SCFAs are of major importance in understanding the physiological function of dietary fibers and their possible role in intestinal neoplasia. SCFAs production and absorption are closely related to the nourishment of colonic mucosa, its production from dietary carbohydrates is a mechanism whereby considerable amounts of calories can be produced in short-bowel patients with remaining colonic function and kept on an appropriate dietary regimen. SCFAs enemas or oral probiotics are a new and promising treatment for ulcerative colitis. The effects have been attributed to the oxidation of SCFAs in the colonocytes and to the ability of butyrate to induce enzymes (i.e. transglutaminase) promoting mucosal restitution. Evidence is mounting regarding the effects of butyrate on various cell functions the significance of which needs further considerations. Up until now, attention has been related especially to cancer prophylaxis and treatment. This article briefly reviews the role of SCFAs, particularly butyrate, in intestinal mucosal growth and potential clinical applications in inflammatory and neoplastic processes of the large bowel.},

   abstract = {OBJECTIVE: To study cholesterol absorption and excretion in ileostomy subjects with different intakes of saturated fat and dietary fibre. DESIGN: Short-term experimental study, with four controlled diets in repeated measurements. SETTING: Out-patients at metabolic-ward kitchen. SUBJECTS: Nine healthy volunteers with conventional ileostomy after colectomy because of ulcerative colitis. INTERVENTIONS: Four diet periods, each of 3 days duration: high saturated fat and low dietary fibre (STAND); reduced saturated fat (RESAT); high saturated fat and high fibre (FATFIB); and reduced saturated fat and high fibre (RESATFIB). MAIN OUTCOME MEASURES: Absorption of cholesterol, and ileal excretion of cholesterol, bile acids, fat and energy. Differences between diets evaluated with Friedman's two-way analysis of variance by rank sum with Bonferroni adjustment, and post hoc differences assessed by rank sum comparison. RESULTS: RESAT and RESATFIB reduced fractional cholesterol absorption by 7% and 10%; RESATFIB and FATFIB increased net cholesterol excretion by 46% and 54% respectively. Further, RESATFIB increased net sterol excretion by 18%, all compared to STAND (P<0.05 for all). All three intervention diets contained more phytosterols than STAND (P<0.05), and the phytosterol content was inversely correlated to fractional cholesterol absorption (r=-0.77, P<0.01). CONCLUSIONS: Current nutrition recommendations to reduce saturated fat and increase dietary fibre affect sterol excretion additively. The effect on cholesterol absorption might be partly explained by the content of dietary plant sterols.

   abstract = {After a short introduction (chapter 1) methods of measuring gastrointestinal pH are described in chapter 2. The methods are divided into intubation techniques and tubeless methods, and the advantages and disadvantages are discussed. Measurements with pH-sensitive, radiotransmitting capsules are highlighted, and methodological problems with these capsules are described. Chapter 3 concerns the gastrointestinal pH profile of healthy subjects. The intraluminal pH is rapidly changed from highly acid in the stomach to about pH 6 in the duodenum. The pH gradually increases in the small intestine from pH 6 to about pH 7.4 in the terminal ileum. The pH drops to 5.7 in the caecum, but again gradually increases, reaching pH 6.7 in the rectum. The physiological background of these pH values is discussed. Chapter 4 describes the effect of gastrointestinal pH on bacterial flora, absorption of vitamins and electrolytes, and on the activity of digestive enzymes. The pH-profile in children is described in chapter 5. The profile is identical with that of adults, and it is therefore concluded that the release of a drug from pH-dependent, controlled-release preparations is also probably identical with that of adults. Chapter 6 describes the correlation between certain diseases and the gastrointestinal pH. A resection of the colon and the creation of an ileostomy do not affect the pH of the remaining gut. An ileocaecal resection shortens the small intestinal transit time, increases pH of the proximal colon, but does not change the pH-profile of the small intestine. Chronic pancreatitis and cystic fibrosis seem to decrease pH of the proximal small intestine. Very low colonic pH values have been observed in severe active ulcerative colitis and in Crohn's disease, but the background and clinical implication of this phenomenon are not clear. Chapter 7 describes the modulating effect of diet and drugs on gastrointestinal pH. Diet primarily has an effect on the colonic pH, whereas drugs might affect both small intestinal and colonic pH. The different effects are described. Finally, chapter 8 summarizes the present knowledge about gastrointestinal pH, and future investigations are proposed.},

   abstract = {Energy-protein malnutrition and the sub-clinical deficiencies of vitamins and trace elements, are frequent findings in ulcerative colitis and Crohn's disease, and these may negatively influence the clinical course of these diseases. In general, the majority of the patients with ulcerative colitis and uncomplicated Crohn's disease can ingest a normal diet that is well balanced and without any restrictions. The intolerance to specific foods is rare in Crohn's disease and the application of exclusion diets in a routine manner is not indicated. When the nutritional status cannot be adequately maintained with normal ingestion, the use of artificial nutrition is indicated. Enteral nutrition is the first choice nutritional support system if the gastrointestinal tract is accessible and at least partially functional. In Crohn's disease enteral nutrition could have a specific anti-inflammatory effect ("primary treatment"), and it has been suggested that this could be effective to induce the clinical remission of the activity bouts of the disease. Some types of dietary fiber could be effective in the treatment of ulcerative colitis. Initial studies suggest their usefulness in maintaining the remission of the disease.},

   abstract = {OBJECTIVE: Butyrate enemas may be effective in the treatment of active distal ulcerative colitis. Because colonic fermentation of Plantago ovata seeds (dietary fiber) yields butyrate, the aim of this study was to assess the efficacy and safety of Plantago ovata seeds as compared with mesalamine in maintaining remission in ulcerative colitis. METHODS: An open label, parallel-group, multicenter, randomized clinical trial was conducted. A total of 105 patients with ulcerative colitis who were in remission were randomized into groups to receive oral treatment with Plantago ovata seeds (10 g b.i.d.), mesalamine (500 mg t.i.d.), and Plantago ovata seeds plus mesalamine at the same doses. The primary efficacy outcome was maintenance of remission for 12 months. RESULTS: Of the 105 patients, 102 were included in the final analysis. After 12 months, treatment failure rate was 40% (14 of 35 patients) in the Plantago ovata seed group, 35% (13 of 37) in the mesalamine group, and 30% (nine of 30) in the Plantago ovata plus mesalamine group. Probability of continued remission was similar (Mantel-Cox test, p = 0.67; intent-to-treat analysis). Therapy effects remained unchanged after adjusting for potential confounding variables with a Cox's proportional hazards survival analysis. Three patients were withdrawn because of the development of adverse events consisting of constipation and/or flatulence (Plantago ovata seed group = 1 and Plantago ovata seed plus mesalamine group = 2). A significant increase in fecal butyrate levels (p = 0.018) was observed after Plantago ovata seed administration. CONCLUSIONS: Plantago ovata seeds (dietary fiber) might be as effective as mesalamine to maintain remission in ulcerative colitis.},

Knowledge of the nutritional status in patients with recently diagnosed IBD is limited. The aim of this study was to establish a comprehensive picture of the nutritional status in recently diagnosed IBD patients. SUBJECTS: Sixty-nine IBD patients (23 Crohn's disease (CD) and 46 with ulcerative colitis (UC)) within 6 months of diagnosis and 69 age- and sex-matched population controls were included in the study. METHODS: The nutritional status was assessed by: (1) body composition (anthropometry and dual-energy X-ray absorptiometry); (2) dietary intake (dietary history); (3) biochemical indexes of nutrition; and (4) muscle strength (isokinetic dynamometer). RESULTS: Body weight and body mass index were significantly lower in UC patients compared with controls. The mean daily intake of carbohydrates was significantly higher in CD patients and the intakes of protein, calcium, phosphorus, and riboflavin were significantly lower in UC patients compared with controls, respectively. Serum concentrations of several nutrients (beta-carotene, magnesium, selenium and zinc) were significantly lower in UC patients compared with controls. Serum vitamin B12 concentration was significantly lower in CD patients. Muscle strength did not significantly differ between IBD patients and controls. CONCLUSIONS: This study showed that the nutritional status of IBD patients was already affected negatively at time of diagnosis. It needs to be elucidated whether nutritional supplementation in recently diagnosed IBD patients may improve the clinical course of the disease.},

   abstract = {OBJECTIVE: Dietary factors have been considered as a possible risk factor for ulcerative colitis (UC). However, available data are inconsistent. The aim of the present study was to evaluate the etiological role of dietary factors in the development of UC. METHODS: Recently diagnosed (<6 Months) UC patients (n = 43) and age- and gender-matched population controls (n = 43) were studied in a case-control design. The crosscheck dietary history method was used to assess dietary intake of 5 yr before the study. Adipose tissue fatty acid composition was used as a biomarker of long-term fat intake. Conditional logistic regression-derived odds ratios (OR), and 95% confidence intervals (CI) were used for statistical analysis. Dietary intake ORs were adjusted for energy intake. RESULTS: High intakes of monounsaturated fat (OR: 33.9 [95% CI 2.6-443.1]), polyunsaturated fat (OR: 5.1 [95% CI 1.0-26.7]), and vitamin B6 (OR: 6.9 [95% CI 1.6-30.7]) were associated with an increased risk to develop UC. No other significant associations were found with UC risk. CONCLUSIONS: High intakes of mono- and polyunsaturated fat and vitamin B6 may enhance the risk of developing UC. Whether this observation is a true risk factor in the development of UC or rather a reflection of a certain dietary lifestyle needs to be investigated.},

Additional, nonconventional approaches include nicotine, probiotics, dietary therapies, and heparins. Several novel approaches have arisen from animal models, including additional means of inhibiting nuclear factor-kappaB and targeting of tumor necrosis factor-alpha.},

A number of studies have examined the prevalence of abnormal bone mineral metabolism in children and adolescents. Studies, conducted over the past decade, indicate a greater likelihood of clinically significant problems in Crohn's disease than in ulcerative colitis. Corticosteroids have been proven to impair bone mineral status. It is increasingly clear that inflammation and other factors play a bigger role than malabsorbtion of minerals or vitamin D in most patients. As the use of the bisphonate class of drugs is limited in pediatric patients, there is a need to emphasize the role of diet and exercise in children and teenagers, particularly in those affected by inflammatory bowel disease.},

   abstract = {These studies were performed to test the benefit of resistant starch on ulcerative colitis via prebiotic and butyrate effects. Butyrate, propionate, and acetate are produced in the colon of mammals as a result of microbial fermentation of resistant starch and other dietary fibers. Butyrate plays an important role in the colonic mucosal growth and epithelial proliferation. A reduction in the colonic butyrate level induces chronic mucosal atrophy. Short-chain fatty acid enemas increase mucosal generation, crypt length, and DNA content of the colonocytes. They also ameliorate symptoms of ulcerative colitis in human patients and rats injected with trinitrobenzene sulfonic acid (TNBS). Butyrate, and also to a lesser degree propionate, are substrates for the aerobic energy metabolism, and trophic factors of the colonocytes. Adverse butyrate effects occur in normal and neoplastic colonic cells. In normal cells, butyrate induces proliferation at the crypt base, while inhibiting proliferation at the crypt surface. In neoplastic cells, butyrate inhibits DNA synthesis and arrests cell growth in the G1 phase of the cell cycle. The improvement of the TNBS-induced colonic inflammation occurred earlier in the resistant starch (RS)-fed rats than in the RS-free group. This benefit coincided with activation of colonic epithelial cell proliferation and the subsequent restoration of apoptosis. The noncollagenous basement membrane protein laminin was regenerated initially in the RS-fed group, demonstrating what could be a considered lower damage to the intestinal barrier function. The calculation of intestinal short-chain fatty acid absorption confirmed this conclusion. The uptake of short-chain fatty acids in the colon is strongly inhibited in the RS-free group, but only slightly reduced in the animals fed with RS. Additionally, RS enhanced the growth of intestinal bacteria assumed to promote health. Further studies involving patients suffering from ulcerative colitis are necessary to determine the importance of RS in the therapy of a number of intestinal diseases and the maintenance of health.},

A database was designed to incorporate the date of data collection, the IBD disease, food habits, the quantity consumed and a response rating of the subjects' reactions to each food. For each of 122 foods, subjects were asked simultaneously about these five categories. Thirty three subjects with Crohn's disease and 27 with ulcerative colitis completed the questionnaire in two seasons. The focus of the examination was directed to the upper and lower limit of reactions to foods. Foods that affect people negatively and foods that affect people positively were identified in relation to habits of consumption. Foods that affect people negatively were among those never consumed while foods that affect people positively were among the regularly consumed foods. Findings included an increased number of foods that caused problems for people with Crohn's disease when compared with people with ulcerative colitis. Problems with chocolate, dairy products, fats and artificial sweeteners were documented in both groups of IBD. A standard food list generated without the input of individuals with a chronic illness may be inadequate to collect data about their consumption since many of the foods on the list were reportedly never consumed and there may be other foods not on the list that are consumed by this chronically ill population.},

   abstract = {BACKGROUND: Germinated barley foodstuffs (GBF), which are derived from brewer's spent grain and are a highly safe food substance, increased butyrate production in the lower intestine and prevented mucosal damage and bloody diarrhoea in an acute experimental colitis model. As human histocompatibility leucocyte antigen (HLA)-B27 transgenic rats develop spontaneous and chronic intestinal inflammation resembling ulcerative colitis, we investigated the mechanisms underlying the preventive effects of GBF against a spontaneous and chronic colitis model. Specifically, the production of bacterial butyrate and the regulation of proinflammatory cytokine production were examined. METHODS: A GBF diet and a cellulose (CE) diet were fed to HLA-B27 transgenic rats for 13 weeks. The presence of faecal occult blood, colonic mucosal protein, DNA and RNA content, colonic myeloperoxidase activity, nuclear factor kappa B (NFkappaB) DNA binding activity, the depth of the crypts and serum inflammatory parameters were then evaluated. Butyrate production in the caecal contents was also determined. RESULTS: Feeding GBF significantly increased bacterial butyrate production and simultaneously attenuated the presence of faecal occult blood and colonic mucosal hyperplasia. Colonic mucosal NFkappaB-DNA binding activity and the production of interleukin-8 were also suppressed by the butyrate produced from GBF. CONCLUSIONS: Germinated barley foodstuffs feeding promotes bacterial butyrate production and attenuated inflammation in both spontaneous and chronic colitis in HLA-B27 transgenic rats.},

IBD actually encompasses two diseases, i.e. Crohn's disease (CD) and ulcerous colitis (UC). These diseases resemble each other so closely that they cannot be distinguished even pathologically, but differ from each other sufficiently to regard them as independent entities. Epidemiological observations may be helpful in identifying the true causative factors of this evasive disease. Geographically, the prevalence of the disease has a slope from North to South and, to a lesser degree, from West to East. The Western-Eastern discrepancy can be attributed to a difference in Western life styles. The incidence of the disease has been increasing world-wide of late, but its spread has been slowing down in highly affected countries. Racial and ethnic relations in different populations and immigration studies offer interesting data which can reflect genetic, inherited, environmental and behavioural factors. The disease seems to have a characteristic racial-ethnic distribution: the Jewish population is highly susceptible everywhere, but its prevalence in that population nears that of the domestic society in which they live. In Hungary, the Roma (Gypsies) have a considerably lower prevalence than the average population. This can be attributed to a genetic or environmental influence. According to age, the onset of the disease occurs more often in the second or the third decade of life, but there also is another peak in the 60s. Regarding sexual distribution, there is a slight preponderance of colitis ulcerosa in men and of Crohn's disease in women. It may correspond to the stronger auto-immune affection in the process of Crohn's disease. Environmental factors and behavioural influences also are investigated. Diet, the role of the early ages, smoking habits and the influence of hormonal status and drugs are viewed as useful contributing factors in the manifestation of the disease. Genetic studies show that one-fourth of IBD patients have an affected family member. HLAB27 histocombatibility also plays an important, but not determining role in the development of the disease. Genetic factors seem to have a stronger influence in Crohn's disease than ulcerative colitis. The existence of multiple sclerosis-IBD families may reflect the common genetic background or the similar microbial effect as well. A great number of bacterial and viral factors has been suspected of being infectious factors in IBD, mostly in CD. Mycobacteria, Yersinia, Campylobacter, Clostridium, Clamidias, etc. as well as bacteria and some viruses such as herpes and rotavirus and the primary measles virus. None of them has been proven as a real and exclusively pathogenic factor. Immunological background has an important function in the manifestation of the disease. If an individual has a genetic susceptibility to infections, the down regulation of an inflammation in the bowel wall does not occur in a proper way. This initiates the auto-immune process which is a self-increasing cycle. Extra-intestinal manifestations of IBD are of high importance because they can not only follow intestinal symptoms, but precede them by years. Hepatic and biliary disturbances (primary sclerosing cholangitis), are the most serious complications. Mucocutaneous manifestations can be the first appearance of the main disease (in the mouth). Auto-immune consequences (erythema nodosum) or complications caused even by the therapy can occur. Ocular and musculoskeletal manifestations supposedly have the same genetic background and often precede the intestinal symptoms. Considering the epidemiological, genetic and immunological data, we can conclude that ulcerative colitis and Crohn's disease are heterogeneous disorders of mutifactorial etiology in which hereditary (genetic) and environmental (microbial, behaviour) factors interact to produce the disease.},

   abstract = {This study was conducted to investigate the efficacy of rebamipide against experimental colitis induced by dextran sulfate sodium (DSS) in a rat model of inflammatory bowel disease. Experimental colitis was induced in male Wistar rats by oral administration of 3% DSS solution for one week. The rats were provided with standard diet containing 0.105% rebamipide (160 mg/kg/day) for 1 week. In rats treated with rebamipide, clinical (body weight loss, bloody diarrhea, reduced physical activity, severe anemia, shortened colonic length, and perianal injury) and histopathological (pathological lesion score) findings of DSS colitis were significantly less than in rats with DSS colitis not treated with rebamipide. Rebamipide thus inhibited the induction of colitis. Rebamipide significantly reduced concentrations of both interleukin-1alpha and GRO/CINC-1 (IL-8-like substance) and cell infiltrates in colonic wall, in parallel with decreased activity of myeloperoxidase. It also reduced expression of IL-1 mRNA but did not influence expression of GRO/CINC-1 mRNA. The attenuation of colonic indices of colitis by rebamipide in this rat model suggests that this drug might have beneficial effects in the treatment of human ulcerative colitis. These effects of rebamipide are attributable to its inhibition of inflammatory cytokine-mediated granulocyte (neutrophil) infiltration into the colon.},

Results of a questionnaire survey answered by 155 patients organised in a support group are presented.

One half of the patients used medication every day to decrease the number of defaecations. 64% had changed their diet, while social and physical activities were reduced for 43% of the patients. Changes in lifestyle after the operation lead to increased expenses for 70% of the group. Women were more often incontinent than men and experienced it as a serious problem, and more women than men had changed their dietary habits. The quality of sleep was inferior to that of the preoperative period for 47% of the patients. 50% felt restricted in daily life activities due to frequent defaecations. These patients are living with a concealed disability. In spite of this, their assessments of self-esteem, health and quality of life were mainly positive.},

This prospective study was therefore undertaken to define the role of Doppler sonography in the assessment of disease activity and in the prediction of early relapse. SUBJECTS/METHODS: Splanchnic flowmetry was performed in 76 patients with ulcerative colitis (47 with active disease and 29 in remission), six with infectious colitis, and 13 healthy controls during fasting and 30 minutes after ingestion of a standardised meal. Twenty seven of the patients with ulcerative colitis and all patients with infectious colitis were investigated during the active state as well as in clinical remission and followed up for six months. Flow velocity and pulsatility index (PI) of the superior (SMA) and inferior (IMA) mesenteric arteries and the portal vein were related to clinical (Truelove index), laboratory (C-reactive protein), and endoscopic (Sutherland index) parameters of disease activity. RESULTS: The mean flow velocity of the IMA correlated closest with clinical activity (Truelove, r = 0.41, p<0.005), the PI with C-reactive protein (r = 0.30, p<0.05), and endoscopic activity (r = 0.45, p<0.001). All patients in remission after six months (14/14) or with infectious colitis (6/6) showed an increase in PI of the IMA compared with the initial measurement during active disease (mean increase for ulcerative colitis +36% and for infectious colitis +77%). In contrast, most patients with later relapse or surgery (11/13) had decreased PI during initial remission (mean decrease -12%). The positive predictive value of this index for maintenance of remission was 0.77. Flow variables of the SMA and portal vein displayed weaker correlations. CONCLUSIONS: Flow measurements in the IMA are closely related to clinical and endoscopic disease activity in patients with ulcerative colitis. Repeated measurement of the PI allows estimation of the risk of recurrence.},

   abstract = {BACKGROUND: Hydrogen sulfide is a luminally acting, bacterially derived cell poison that has been implicated in ulcerative colitis. Sulfide generation in the colon is probably driven by dietary components such as sulfur-containing amino acids (SAAs) and inorganic sulfur (eg, sulfite). OBJECTIVE: We assessed the contribution of SAAs from meat to sulfide production by intestinal bacteria with use of both a model culture system in vitro and an in vivo human feeding study. DESIGN: Five healthy men were housed in a metabolic suite and fed a sequence of 5 diets for 10 d each. Meat intake ranged from 0 g/d with a vegetarian diet to 600 g/d with a high-meat diet. Fecal sulfide and urinary sulfate were measured in samples collected on days 9 and 10 of each diet period. Additionally, 5 or 10 g bovine serum albumin or casein/L was added to batch cultures inoculated with feces from 4 healthy volunteers. Concentrations of sulfide, ammonia, and Lowry-reactive substances were measured over 48 h. RESULTS: Mean (+/-SEM) fecal sulfide concentrations ranged from 0.22 +/- 0.02 mmol/kg with the 0-g/d diet to 3.38 +/- 0.31 mmol/kg with the 600-g/d diet and were significantly related to meat intake (P: < 0.001). Sulfide formation in fecal batch cultures supplemented with both bovine serum albumin and casein correlated with protein digestion, as measured by the disappearance of Lowry-reactive substances and the appearance of ammonia. CONCLUSION: Dietary protein from meat is an important substrate for sulfide generation by bacteria in the human large intestine.},

   abstract = {BACKGROUND: Ileal dysfunction, and resection or exclusion may affect intestinal bile acid resorption resulting in alterations in serum lipid concentration. In restorative proctocolectomy, the different procedures may involve the ileum in all three ways. AIM: The aim of the present study was to analyse possible changes of the blood lipid profile during the different steps of restorative proctocolectomy operative procedure. METHOD: There were nineteen elective patients on their ordinary diet and 19 emergency patients on total parenteral nutrition. The former group were primarily operated on with colectomy; ileoanal pouch and loop ileostomy while the later group had had an emergency colectomy and terminal ileostomy before the pouch operation. Thirty five of the patients had ulcerative colitis, 2 had familial colon polyposis and 1 familial cancer syndrome. Blood specimens were collected in the mornings with the patients in a fasting state. The emergency patients were on unchanged ordinary diet during the preoperative period. Serum cholesterol and triglyceride were determined by enzymatic methods. Lipoproteins, studied only in the elective patients, were analysed by a combination of ultracentrifugation and precipitation. Student's t-test with Bonferroni's correction for multiple comparisons was used for statistic calculations. RESULTS: Preoperatively, the emergency group had significantly lower serum cholesterol but not serum triglycerides values compared to the elective group. This finding is probably due to difference in the preoperative nutrition. The cholesterol levels among patients who received steroids in the two groups were compared and found to be significantly lower in the emergency group. Later, no significant differences concerning cholesterol and triglycerides were found between the groups. The cholesterol level was not significantly different in the elective group between patients who receive hydrocortisone and those who did not. During the period with loop ileostomy cholesterol was significantly lowered while the triglycerides were significantly increased compared to the preoperative values of the elective group. The decrease of serum cholesterol levels was correlated to the length of the excluded ileum. During the same period alpha-lipoprotein decreased significantly and reached values below the normal of the reference material. Beta-lipoproteins, which were subnormal already preoperatively, increased but not significantly. Pre-beta-lipoproteins were at the same level at all stations. At 12 months with functioning pouches all analysed values, with the exception of beta-lipoproteins. were within the normal limits set by the reference material. In the emergency group the patterns for triglycerides and cholesterol were similar but for the preoperatively depressed cholesterol values. After 12 months with functioning pouch the serum cholesterol and triglycerides were at the same level as for the elective patients. CONCLUSION: A serum lipid profile was studied in patients undergoing restorative proctocolectomy. Serum cholesterol and alpha-lipoprotein decreased and triglycerides increased when the patients had a diverting loop ileostomy. At 12 months after it's closure and with a functioning pouch, the patients had the same profile as the elective patients preoperatively, and with exception of beta-lipoproteins within normal limits in spite of the loss of the colon and the construction of a pouch of the distal ileum.},

The lowering of serum cholesterol by plant sterols is believed to be the result of an inhibition of cholesterol absorption in the small bowel, although increased bile acid excretion has also been suggested. The difference in effect of saturated and unsaturated plant sterols on cholesterol absorption needs to be elucidated further. OBJECTIVE: The primary aim of this study was to measure small-bowel cholesterol absorption and sterol excretion in addition to hepatic cholesterol synthesis after intake of soy sterol esters and beta-sitostanol ester corresponding to 1.5 g plant sterols/d. DESIGN: Seven ileostomy subjects were studied during a control period and 2 intervention periods when either soy sterol esters or beta-sitostanol ester was added to a basal diet. Ileostomy bags were collected every other hour and frozen immediately for analysis of nutrients and sterols. RESULTS: Cholesterol absorption was 56% (43-65%) in the control period and decreased to 38% (32-46%) in the soy sterol ester period (P = 0.00) and to 39% (30-48%) in the beta-sitostanol ester period (P = 0.00). CONCLUSION: Esterified soy sterols and beta-sitostanol inhibited cholesterol absorption equally, despite the different structures of the plant sterols.},

We determined serum anti-Saccharomyces cerevisiae antibody (ASCA) levels in patients with inflammatory bowel disease. METHODS AND RESULTS: Immunoglobulin G (IgG) ASCA was measured by using an ELISA in serum samples from 19 patients with ulcerative colitis, 18 patients with Crohn's disease and 7 healthy controls. The ASCA level was significantly higher in patients with ulcerative colitis and patients with Crohn's disease than in controls, and was significantly higher in patients with Crohn's disease compared with patients with ulcerative colitis. Age, gender, disease activity, extent of disease and small bowel involvement each did not affect ASCA levels. The use of elemental or polymeric diet therapy for Crohn's disease and administration of corticosteroids to patients with inflammatory bowel disease also did not affect ASCA levels. The ASCA titer was significantly lower in patients with Crohn's disease taking mesalazine than in those not taking it, although, serum IgG levels did not differ between these two groups, which might imply a suppression of IgG production by mesalazine at the intestinal level. CONCLUSIONS: The finding of increased serum ASCA titers in patients with inflammatory bowel disease suggests that Saccharomyces cerevisiae may play a role in the pathophysiology of this condition.},

Our aim was to identify the information needs, levels and associated factors in IBS, and to contrast this with patients with inflammatory bowel disease (IBD). DESIGN: Seventy adult IBS patients (Rome criteria) were prospectively recruited, together with 82 ulcerative colitis (UC) and 60 Crohn's disease (CD) patients. Demographic data, clinical data, and anxiety and depression scores (HAD scale) were recorded. Patients rated their perceived levels of disease knowledge and satisfaction with their knowledge level on visual analogue scales. Qualitative data on disease information needs were obtained by an open-ended question. SETTING: Gastroenterology out-patient clinic. RESULTS: The majority of IBS patients (77%; n = 54) and over half of IBD patients (56%; n = 79) required further information about their disease. The primary issues for IBS patients were bowel cancer risk and diet. Queries about medications ranked top for UC, while prognosis and cancer risk jointly ranked top for CD. In the IBS group, 27% rated their knowledge as < 25 out of 100 compared to 10% of IBD patients. The perceived level of knowledge in IBS was significantly negatively associated with length of hospital consulting (r(s) = -0.32; P = 0.04). CONCLUSION: Most IBS patients feel insufficiently informed, particularly in relation to risk of serious disease and role of diet. Educating IBS patients about their disorder may play a role in reducing healthcare use.},

   abstract = {In our ongoing studies on the chemoprevention of cancer we have a particular interest in the health benefits of the Mediterranean diet, of which olive oil is a major component. Recent studies have shown that extravirgin olive oil contains an abundance of phenolic antioxidants including simple phenols (hydroxytyrosol, tyrosol), aldehydic secoiridoids, flavonoids and lignans (acetoxypinoresinol, pinoresinol). All of these phenolic substances are potent inhibitors of reactive oxygen species attack on, e.g. salicylic acid, 2-deoxyguanosine. Currently there is growing evidence that reactive oxygen species are involved in the aetiology of fat-related neoplasms such as cancer of the breast and colorectum. A plausible mechanism is a high intake of omega-6 polyunsaturated fatty acids which are especially prone to lipid peroxidation initiated and propagated by reactive oxygen species, leading to the formation (via alpha,beta-unsaturated aldehydes such as trans-4-hydroxy-2-nonenal) of highly pro-mutagenic exocyclic DNA adducts. Previous studies have shown that the colonic mucosa of cancer patients and those suffering from predisposing inflammatory conditions such as ulcerative colitis and Crohn's disease generates appreciably higher quantities of reactive oxygen species compared with normal tissue. We have extended these studies by developing accurate high performance liquid chromatography (HPLC) methods for the quantitation of reactive oxygen species generated by the faecal matrix. The data shows that the faecal matrix supports the generation of reactive oxygen species in abundance. As yet, there is a dearth of evidence linking this capacity to actual components of the diet which may influence the colorectal milieu. However, using the newly developed methodology we can demonstrate that the antioxidant phenolic compounds present in olive oil are potent inhibitors of free radical generation by the faecal matrix. This indicates that the study of the inter-relation between reactive oxygen species and dietary antioxidants is an area of great promise for elucidating mechanisms of colorectal carcinogenesis and possible future chemopreventive strategies.},

   abstract = {Various specific and non-specific environmental factors have been associated with the induction and/or exacerbation of disease activity in patients with Crohn's disease and ulcerative colitis. One such factor is the potential role of ingested ultrafine particles. In fact, based on a Western diet, recent data suggest that more than 10(12)ultrafine particles are ingested per person every day. These microparticles have been considered inert although they adsorb endogenous constituents of the intestinal lumen and are taken up by human intestinal lymphoid aggregates. Based on these observations, we determined whether one such dietary microparticle, titanium dioxide (TiO(2)), alters intestinal cell responsiveness to lipopolysaccharide (LPS) using colonic biopsy specimens from 28 patients with ulcerative colitis, 21 with Crohn's disease, and 36 healthy controls. These samples, as well as peripheral blood mononuclear cells when available, were incubated alone (control), or with either (a) LPS (1-2,000 ng/ml), (b) TiO(2)(5 microg/ml) or (c) LPS (1 ng/ml) adsorbed to TiO(2)(5 microg/ml). In each case, the levels of interleukin 1 (IL-1) produced in these assays were quantitated by bioassay and by ELISA. Interestingly, there was dramatic stimulation of peripheral blood mononuclear cells using the TiO(2)-LPS conjugate, with values 30-60-fold above controls and only minor stimulation with LPS or TiO(2)alone. In intestinal organ cultures there was no increase in IL-1 secretion when challenged with TiO(2)alone or with up to 2,000 ng/ml LPS. However, the TiO(2)-LPS conjugate produced a two-to-three-fold, significant increase in the intestinal secretion of IL-1. Our data demonstrate that ultrafine dietary particles are not immunologically inert and may be important adjuncts in overcoming normal gut cell hyporesponsiveness to endogenous luminal molecules. This may be particularly relevant to patients with inflammatory bowel disease where there is abnormal intestinal permeability.},

Sulphide may damage the colonic epithelium and has been implicated in the pathogenesis of ulcerative colitis. The accurate measurement of sulphide in biological samples, particularly in gut contents is difficult due to the volatile nature of the compound, and the viscosity and turbidity of the samples. Here we describe a method for the determination of sulphide in gut contents and whole blood which overcomes these problems. Initially, samples are treated with zinc acetate to trap sulphide. A microdistillation pretreatment is then used, which releases sulphide from its stable, stored state, coupled to ion chromatography with electrochemical detection. The limit of detection of the method was determined as 2.5 micromol/l, which enabled sulphide levels in gut contents and whole blood samples obtained from humans to be accurately determined. A preliminary investigation in healthy human subjects showed blood sulphide ranged from 10 to 100 micromol/l. Whole blood sulphide did not change significantly when increasing amounts of protein from meat were fed. However, faecal sulphide did show a significant increase from 164 to 754 nmol/g in four subjects fed diets which contained 60 and 420 g meat.},

Emptying of solids was measured using the [13C]octanoic acid breath test, and liquid emptying was assessed after oral dosing with paracetamol. Ileostomist subjects exhibited an increased half-emptying time for solids (P = 0.047), which included components of an increased gastric lag time (P = 0.004) and a reduction in the linear emptying rate (P = 0.003).

   abstract = {BACKGROUND/AIMS: Minimally invasive surgery has developed as one of the most important advances in surgical techniques. The laparoscopic procedure has been successfully used to perform colonic resections. Inflammatory bowel diseases like ulcerative colitis (UC) and familial adenomatous polyposis (FAP) appear as a main indication for total laparoscopic proctocolectomy. METHODOLOGY: At the Second Department of Surgery of the "Regina Elena" Institute for Cancer Research, 5 non-selected patients were submitted within a 3-year period (1993-1996) to a total laparoscopic proctocolectomy with a restorative ileal J pouch-anal anastomosis. They comprised 3 males suffering from UC and 2 females affected by FAP. RESULTS: No patients undergoing laparoscopic procedure were converted. The average operative time was 364 min (480 min in the first case, 290 min in the fifth case). There were no intra-operative or post-operative complications (except a mild peritoneal bleeding in the first case, spontaneously stopped). Post-operative pain was mild and no analgesics were required. Late results were excellent, with good bowel function within 1 year after the operation, without dietetic, working and sport restrictions and without sexual disorders, mainly in males. CONCLUSIONS: Laparoscopic total proctocolectomy in the hands of skilled laparoscopic surgeons is a feasible, safe and effective procedure, with early and late results comparable to, and in some aspects better than, those obtained with "open" surgery. Moreover, it does not have the disadvantage of intra-operative fluid loss, prolonged post-operative ileus, pain and, in younger patients, psychological discomfort of the wide scar.},

Twenty-two patients with severely and moderately active ulcerative colitis (8 severe and 14 moderate) and 12 patients with Crohn's colitis were analyzed retrospectively. Eleven of 22 patients with ulcerative colitis were treated with TPN and corticosteroids (TPN group). The remaining 11 patients were treated with corticosteroids alone and hospital meals (oral diet group). Both groups were matched regarding disease severity at pretreatment. The clinical characteristics, and the initial and total dosages of corticosteroids for 3 weeks were similar between the two groups. The authors compared the changes in the clinical, inflammatory, and nutritional parameters and short-term outcome between the TPN and the oral diet groups with ulcerative colitis. The same evaluations were also made for 12 patients with Crohn's colitis who received TPN (CD group). The TPN group did not show any significant improvement in the clinical parameter, inflammatory signs, or nutritional state compared with the oral diet group with ulcerative colitis. The remission rate after 3 weeks of therapy and a colectomy rate also showed no significant difference between the two groups. In contrast, TPN resulted in a disappearance of clinical symptoms and an improvement in both the inflammatory and nutritional parameters in the CD group. Only one of the 12 patients with Crohn's colitis underwent colectomy. TPN induced no additional benefit in corticosteroid therapy in an acute attack of ulcerative colitis. In contrast, TPN may have primary effects on Crohn's colitis.},

   abstract = {Most conventional forms of drug therapy suppress or modify the host immunoinflammatory response and neglect the other contributor to disease pathogenesis-the environmental microflora. Probiotics are live microbial food ingredients that alter the enteric microflora and have a beneficial effect on health. The rationale for using probiotics in IBD is mainly based on evidence from human studies and experimental animal models implicating intestinal bacteria in the pathogenesis of these disorders. The relationship between bacteria and intestinal inflammation is complex and does not appear to reflect a simple cause and effect. Similarly, the field of probiotics is complex and in need of rigorous research. Until the indigenous flora are better characterized and mechanisms of probiotic action defined, the promise of probiotics in IBD is unlikely to be fulfilled. Because of strain-specific variability and clinical and therapeutic heterogeneity within Crohn's disease and ulcerative colitis, it cannot be assumed that a given probiotic is equally suitable for all individuals. Although preliminary results of probiotic therapy in animal models and humans with ulcerative colitis and pouchitis have been encouraging, their efficacy in treatment or maintenance of remission of Crohn's disease remains to be clarified. However, the circumstantial evidence for some form of biotherapeutic modification of the enteric flora in Crohn's disease seems compelling. In the future, probiotics may offer a simple adjunct to conventional therapy with the emphasis on diet shifting from one of nutritional replenishment alone to a more functional role.},

METHOD: We review the food intake, presentation, laboratory and radiographic data, and course of two patients who developed ileoanal J-pouch perforation after rapid consumption of meals rich in fiber or calories or both. The potential association between food consumption and rupture is explored. RESULTS: The authors propose that the rapid ingestion of a high-fiber, high-calorie meal may lead to an acute intraluminal pressure elevation or a closed-loop obstruction. These effects may be the basis for an association between food ingestion patterns and perforation at the distal transection site in an ileoanal J-pouch. CONCLUSION: The authors hypothesize that the rapid ingestion of a high-fiber, high-calorie meal may be associated with J-pouch perforation. Further investigative efforts are needed to confirm this association and to evaluate whether a causal relationship is present. If causality is established, physicians may develop a higher index of suspicion for pouch rupture in patients who present with abdominal disturbances after the rapid ingestion of a high-fiber, high-calorie meal.},

   abstract = {Human beings evolved consuming a diet that contained about equal amounts of n-3 and n-6 essential fatty acids. Over the past 100-150 y there has been an enormous increase in the consumption of n-6 fatty acids due to the increased intake of vegetable oils from corn, sunflower seeds, safflower seeds, cottonseed, and soybeans. Today, in Western diets, the ratio of n-6 to n-3 fatty acids ranges from approximately 20-30:1 instead of the traditional range of 1-2:1. Studies indicate that a high intake of n-6 fatty acids shifts the physiologic state to one that is prothrombotic and proaggregatory, characterized by increases in blood viscosity, vasospasm, and vasoconstriction and decreases in bleeding time. n-3 Fatty acids, however, have antiinflammatory, antithrombotic, antiarrhythmic, hypolipidemic, and vasodilatory properties. These beneficial effects of n-3 fatty acids have been shown in the secondary prevention of coronary heart disease, hypertension, type 2 diabetes, and, in some patients with renal disease, rheumatoid arthritis, ulcerative colitis, Crohn disease, and chronic obstructive pulmonary disease. Most of the studies were carried out with fish oils [eicosapentaenoic acid (EPA) and docosahexaenoic acid (DHA)]. However, alpha-linolenic acid, found in green leafy vegetables, flaxseed, rapeseed, and walnuts, desaturates and elongates in the human body to EPA and DHA and by itself may have beneficial effects in health and in the control of chronic diseases.},

Specifically, this involves interactions between the resident microbiota and dietary ingredients that support their activities. Currently, it is accepted that the gut microflora contains pathogenic, benign and beneficial components. Some microbially induced disease states such as acute gastroenteritis and pseudomembranous colitis have a defined aetiological agent(s). Speculation on the role of microbiota components in disorders such as irritable bowel syndrome, bowel cancer, neonatal necrotising enterocolitis and ulcerative colitis are less well defined, but many studies are convincing. It is evident that the gut microflora composition can be altered through diet. Because of their perceived health-promoting status, bifidobacteria and lactobacilli are the commonest targets. Probiotics involve the use of live micro-organisms in food; prebiotics are carbohydrates selectively metabolized by desirable moieties of the indigenous flora; synbiotics combine the two approaches. Dietary intervention of the human gut microbiota is feasible and has been proven as efficacious in volunteer trials. The health bonuses of such approaches offer the potential to manage many gut disorders prophylactically. However, it is imperative that the best methodologies available are applied to this area of nutritional sciences. This will undoubtedly involve a genomic application to the research and is already under way through molecular tracking of microbiota changes to diet in controlled human trials.},

   abstract = {CD and UC represent a spectrum of chronic IBD that present in protean ways and are accompanied by a variety of systemic sequelae. Sulfasalazine and the newer 5-aminosalicylates are important in the management of mild-to-moderate disease, whereas corticosteroids remain the primary therapy for most patients with moderate-to-severe disease (Tables 2-5). The toxicities associated with long-term steroid therapy, combined with their ineffectiveness as maintenance medications, have led to increased use of immunomodulators, such as azathioprine and 6-MP, for the treatment of steroid-dependent and steroid-resistant IBD. Infliximab is a novel therapeutic adjunct for chronically active and fistulizing CD that will herald a new era of biologic therapy for IBD. Meanwhile, CSA remains an alternative to urgent colectomy in severe UC unresponsive to corticosteroids and also for CD patients with severe disease or refractory fistulas. Finally, continued insights into the etiopathogenic pathways in IBD will provide evolving and innovative approaches until the eventual causes and cures are elucidated. In the meantime, clinicians should remain optimistic regarding current ability to reduce the morbidity and maintain the quality of life for patients suffering with these frustrating diseases.},

In the active state, the aim of nutrition therapy is to reduce the activity of the disease. In the remission state, the aim is to keep the condition and to supply elements of nutrition which the disease causes these deficiency such as vitamins or minerals. Needless to say, it is required to consider a few points; patient's condition, lesion's digestion disorder and leakage, or side effects of caused by medicines. High calorie, low fat and rich protein is ideal for the nutrition therapy for this disease, however it is suggested to satisfy patient's mental health at the same time. Nutrition therapy for Ulcerative Colitis should be regarded as the long-term treatment that requires the co-operation and comprehension between patients and medical supporting staffs.},

   abstract = {BACKGROUND: Eosinophils may be involved in the pathogenesis of inflammation in inflammatory bowel disease. The purpose of this study was to verify whether concentrations of eosinophilic cationic protein in gut lavage fluid from children with inflammatory bowel disease correlate with clinical and laboratory indexes of disease activity. METHODS: Twenty-three children with Crohn's disease, 14 with ulcerative colitis, and 22 age-matched control subjects entered the study. Radioimmunoassay and sandwich enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay techniques were used to measure eosinophilic cationic protein, total immunoglobulin G and interleukin-1beta, respectively. RESULTS: Gut lavage eosinophilic cationic protein levels were significantly (p < 0.005) higher in patients with Crohn's disease and ulcerative colitis than in control subjects. Intestinal eosinophilic cationic protein levels decreased in three of four children with Crohn's disease who were fed an elemental diet. There was a significant (p < 0.001) correlation between eosinophilic cationic protein concentrations and immunoglobulin G and interleukin-1beta levels in gut lavage fluid. CONCLUSIONS: Elevated intestinal eosinophilic cationic protein levels in inflammatory bowel disease suggest that eosinophils are involved in the gastrointestinal inflammation in this disease. Intestinal eosinophilic cationic protein concentration is another marker with which to discriminate between active and inactive inflammatory bowel disease.},

   abstract = {Till about 3 decades ago, inflammatory bowel disease (IBD) was considered as non-existent in our country. However, since that time several reports of IBD, mainly ulcerative colitis have been published. More recently, Crohn's disease is also being reported from the country. This trend of UC appearing first in a population followed by CD also appears to be true in other developing nations. A substantial increase in the rates of CD over UC in the last few decades is reported from developed nations as well. Of the other epidemiological factors, an increased risk of CD and lower risk of UC in smokers is established in adults. However, it appears that smoking increases the risk of IBD in children. The etiology of IBD remains elusive. Within the triad of genetics, immunity and antigen responsible for the development of IBD, maximum advances have been made in the field of immune aberrations and this is being exploited to treat the disease. It is well established that IBD results from a disordered immune system in the gut, in response to an unidentified antigen in a predisposed individual. The immune response is enhanced and revolves around antigen-presenting cells, CD 4 T-lymphocytes and tumor necrosis factor alpha. CD results from an enhanced Th1 activity. The pathogenesis of UC is less clear but appears to be humoral. Advances in diagnostics include the availability of serology, ultrasound and nuclear scans, none of which have been tried in our setting where infectious diseases and tuberculosis is rampant. Growth failure and the importance of nutrition in IBD, especially CD, cannot be underemphasized. In many situations nutritional interventions have been used solely as a form of therapy for CD. Newer steroid molecules with minimal systemic effects are also being considered. Other treatment options highlighted are the use of immunosuppressive agents, biologic agents and role of surgery.},

   abstract = {Short chain fatty acids (SCFA), especially butyrate, play central metabolic roles in maintaining the mucosal barrier in the gut. A lack of SCFA, leading to endogenous starvation of enterocytes, may be the cause of ulcerative colitis and other inflammatory conditions. The main source of SCFA is dietary fibre, but they can also be derived from structured lipids, e. g. tributyrin. Once absorbed by non-ionic diffusion or carrier-mediated anion exchanges, SCFA are either used locally as fuel for the enterocytes or enter the portal bloodstream. Butyrate has been shown to increase wound healing and to reduce inflammation in the small intestine. In the colon, butyrate is the dominant energy source for epithelial cells and affects cellular proliferation and differentiation by yet unknown mechanisms. Recent data suggest that the luminal provision of butyrate may be an appropriate means to improve wound healing in intestinal surgery and to ameliorate symptoms of inflammatory bowel diseases.},

   abstract = {Bowman-Birk inhibitor concentrate (BBIC) is a soybean extract enriched in the Bowman-Birk inhibitor, a protein protease inhibitor. The Bowman-Birk inhibitor can inhibit proteases released from inflammation mediating cells and suppress superoxide anion radical secretion from immunocytes. This study investigates the ability of Bowman-Birk inhibitor concentrate to inhibit colon inflammation in the dextran sulfate sodium model of ulcerative colitis, an inflammatory bowel disease. When compared to mice on a standard diet, mice given food supplemented with 0.5% BBIC during and after dextran sulfate sodium treatment showed suppression of three of four scored histopathological inflammation criteria (P < 0.01), total histopathological score (P < 0.01), a 15% lower mortality rate (P < 0.01), and a delayed onset of mortality. We conclude that dietary Bowman-Birk inhibitor concentrate can beneficially affect dextran sulfate sodium-treated mice and may be useful in the treatment of human inflammatory bowel diseases, particularly ulcerative colitis.},
