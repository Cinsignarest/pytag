The Istituto Superiore di Sanita (Italian National Institute of Health) has carried out the analytical control of the composition of infant foods present on the Italian market, and verified the nutritional quality and the presence, if any, of undesirable substances. Since 1980 the research has often required the development of specific and accurate analytical methods for these products. Adapted and follow-up formulas, cereal-based weaning products and those meant for subjects in special physiological conditions (premature, coeliac, allergic) have been analyzed, monitoring their qualitative transformation during the years. The main essential nutrients-proteins, lipids and minerals-have been assayed to evaluate whether the nutritional requirements of infants during the first year of life were satisfied. The protein and lipid composition of infant formulas was compared with that of human milk, and the influence of such feedings on plasma amino acid levels and erythrocyte fatty acids was assessed.},

   abstract = {Despite the progress made in understanding the mechanisms of allergic disease, the pathophysiology and clinical significance of intestinal allergic reactions is largely unclear. The intestinal mucosa is pre-destined for allergic reactions against food proteins and other antigens, and a number of studies indicate that allergic reactions occur in the GI tract. However, only a few epidemiological data are available, and the mechanisms are poorly understood. Intestinal allergic reactions may be different to classical IgE-mediated reactions because patients with intestinal allergy often have negative skin tests and low levels of serum IgE. There is increasing evidence that, as with the findings in the skin and lung, mast cells and eosinophils play a central role in mediating intestinal allergic reactions. Furthermore, both types of cell are found to be activated in a number of other GI inflammatory diseases such as inflammatory bowel disease, celiac disease and eosinophilic gastroenteritis. However, the relationship between these pathologies and intestinal allergy is largely unclear. A major clinical problem is the lack of appropriate means for confirming the diagnosis of intestinal allergy. However, new test systems have been developed--such as the measurement of eosinophil mediators in stool samples or endoscopic provocation tests performed locally at the intestinal mucosa, which may improve the possibility of identifying afflicted patients on an objective basis. Since symptoms of intestinal allergic reactions are variable and non-specific, the diagnosis requires the use of multiple tests and the exclusion of other pathologies such as infectious disease or non-immunological intolerance reactions. The preferred therapeutic option is avoidance of the allergens of relevance; however, this approach can be realized only in some patients, whereas others require additional treatment, for example, with oral cromoglycate or corticosteroids. Although we do not yet know to what extent intestinal allergic reactions may be an aetiological factor in GI diseases, such reactions should be considered in the differential diagnosis of unclear intestinal inflammation and irritable bowel syndrome.},

   abstract = {The noninvasive assessment of intestinal permeability in humans has a 20-year history. Because the tests are increasingly used in clinical practice and research and because there is much controversy, we reviewed the literature and outlined the potential and possible shortcomings of these procedures. Data was obtained from personal files and from a systemic search through MEDLINE and EMBASE. The principle of the differential urinary excretion of orally administered test markers is explained with reference to the desired physicochemical properties of the markers and how the principle can be exploited to allow assessment of various other gastrointestinal functions. The use of intestinal permeability tests for diagnostic screen for small bowel disease and assessment of responses to treatment, the pathogenesis of disease, normal intestinal physiology, and the effect of drugs and toxins on the intestine is described and reviewed. The controversy surrounding the anatomic location of the permeation pathways that the markers use is highlighted. Noninvasive tests of intestinal permeability have fulfilled early promises of usefulness in clinical practice and research. There is now a need for integrated research into the basic mechanisms of regulatory control of the intestinal barrier function.},

   abstract = {To investigate the prevalence and clinical and genetic patterns of celiac disease (CD) among siblings of CD patients, 103 siblings and one twin of 80 celiac children were evaluated by means of their clinical history, physical examination, blood indices of nutritional status, and antigliadin antibodies (AGA). Antiendomysium antibody (AEA) levels were determined in 70 patients and 85 subjects were human leucocyte antigen (HLA) typed. On the basis of clinical or laboratory data or both, 21 siblings (20.2%) were submitted to intestinal biopsy, whereas intestinal biopsy in six siblings with positive serologic screening (AGA IgA or AEA or both) was not performed because of parental refusal. In a high percentage of cases (18%), all on a gluten-containing diet, the intestinal mucosa was atrophic, and CD was subsequently diagnosed. Because we could not submit all the siblings to intestinal biopsy, this figure could underestimate the real prevalence of the disease in our series; consequently, it was not possible to calculate accurately the sensitivity and specificity of AGA and AEA. Nevertheless, AEA (positive in all the nine siblings with mucosal atrophy), followed by AGA IgA, proved to be the best screening for CD. Eighteen of 19 CD siblings showed HLA-predisposing antigens. Among the 19 CD siblings, one showed a typical form with gastrointestinal symptoms, two had short stature, one suffered from recurrent vomiting, and in 15, the disease was clinically silent. On the contrary, among siblings who were first diagnosed (index cases), the majority (73.7%) had a typical form of CD, and no clinically silent cases were observed. We did not find any difference between index cases and CD siblings in food habits and distribution of HLA antigens. In 15 of 18 cases, the sibling diagnosed subsequently was the older one. Finally, the typical form of CD was significantly more frequent among the younger brother than the older. In conclusion, the high prevalence of the silent form of CD in our cases indicates that siblings of CD subjects should always be screened for CD. The combination of AGA IgA and AEA represent a good screening method to use in selecting children for the intestinal biopsy.},

   abstract = {Celiac disease is the classical food-sensitive enteropathy and is caused by an antigen-specific immunologic hypersensitivity response to gluten within the small intestinal mucosa. Antibody and T-cell hypersensitivity may play a role in vivo, but it is more likely that the primary problem is an inappropriate T-cell response to gluten. The deleterious effects of gluten in celiac patients can be completely explained by the immune-mediated alterations in upper small-intestinal mucosal shape; these alterations include the replacement of long villi and short crypts with short or absent villi and hyperplastic crypts. It is an extremely unusual disease in that it is highly linked to human leukocyte antigen (HLA)-DQ2, and CD4+ T-cell clones that recognize gluten in the context of DQ2 have been isolated from celiac mucosa lamina propria. HLA-DQ2 is commonly used in Whites, but the incidence of celiac disease varies greatly between different countries and with time, without any obvious explanation. Celiac disease is also unusual in that it has features of autoimmune disease. Patients with active disease have immunoglobulin (Ig)A antibodies in endomysium, an uncharacterized extracellular matrix protein, and the presence of these antibodies is very specific for this condition. However, because celiac disease is more common in IgA-deficient patients, the IgA antiendomysial antibodies are unlikely to be pathogenic.},

Significant reductions in intake were produced by near-celiac infusions of 400, 800, and 1,600 ng CCK-8, but only the two highest doses affected intake when infused intravenously. In a second experiment, which replicated previous observations, near-celiac bolus infusions of 70 ng CCK-8 significantly reduced sucrose intake but intravenous infusions did not. Behavioral observations indicated that although bolus infusions produced immediate disruption of feeding, suggesting an aversive effect, effects of continuous CCK-8 infusions on temporal intake patterns were consistent with enhancement of satiety. These data provide further evidence that CCK-8 acts on a site within the upper gastrointestinal tract to produce satiety.},

We therefore conducted a study on children with active celiac disease to detect possible GI motor abnormalities in this disease. Fourteen children (age range, 1-13 years) were studied; they underwent fasting and fed manometric recordings in the gastroduodenojejunal area. Four patients were restudied after a 6-month gluten-free diet. Data were compared with those obtained in eight control children. As compared with controls, celiac disease patients showed a shorter duration of activity fronts (p < 0.01) and a significant (p < 0.01) reduction of the postprandial antral motility index; furthermore, > 90% of the patients displayed marked fasting and/or fed motor abnormalities, suggesting a neuropathic disorder. Interestingly, gut dysmotilities disappeared in the four subjects reassessed after the gluten-free diet. It is concluded that celiac disease frequently affects the motor behavior of the gut and that its effects may be reversed by appropriate diet.},

When fractionated by affinity chromatography on Sepharose-6B coupled with mannan, peptic-tryptic digests separated into three fractions. Fraction C peptides were shown to agglutinate K562(S) cells, whereas peptides in fractions A and B and in the mixed fraction B + C were inactive, suggesting that fraction B contains "protective" peptides that interfere with toxic peptides in fraction C in their agglutinating activity. These results offer an opportunity to study the biochemical and genetic bases of wheat toxicity at the diploid level. Moreover, the reduced toxicity, if any, of Triticum monococcum in the celiac disease, along with the good grain characteristics of some "monococcum" accessions, greatly increases the economical prospects of this wheat species.},

For each patient a thorough dietary history was obtained; the Recommended Dietary Allowances (RDA) 1986/1987--Istituto Nazionale della Nutrizione were used as reference measurements. 71.3% of our patients had a daily calorie intake lower than recommended (mean +/- 1SD = -110 +/- 389 kcal/day). Calorie deficiency was mainly due to a low carbohydrate intake (50.2 +/- 7% of daily calorie intake vs. 59% RDA; difference = -4.7 +/- 7%). Fast absorbed simple carbohydrates exceeded by 46% the recommended 10% ratio to complex carbohydrates. Daily fat intake was higher than RDA (+7.7%) in 94.1% of our patients, who obtained from fat 35.7 +/- 5.2% of their daily calorie intake vs 28% recommended. Saturated to unsaturated fat ratio was unbalanced towards saturated fat intake (2.3 +/- 1.1 vs 0.33 recommended). Coeliac children on a GFD have low caloric and carbohydrate intakes and a high fat intake. An unbalance towards simple sugar and saturated fat ingestion was detected. A lifelong protraction of these dietary habits may favour the onset of metabolic diseases in mature age.},

We found 28 biopsy-proven coeliac patients who were invited to start the gluten-free diet (GFD). The aim of this study was a clinical and laboratory follow-up in these screening-detected coeliac adolescents. Patients were 17 females and 11 males with a mean age at diagnosis of 12.8 +/- 1 years (range 11-4). Mean follow-up duration time was 23 +/- 7 months (range 9-37). Twenty-three of the 28 screening-detected coeliac patients came to the control visit, 3 refused the follow-up and 2 subjects were not found. Twelve patients (52.2%) stated that they never ate any gluten-containing food, while 11 of them (47.8%) reported occasional transgressions to the diet. GFD acceptance was reported as good (n = 6), moderate (n = 11) or low (n = 6). After starting the GFD, signs of improvement were seen in most patients, such as weight gain, increased height velocity and increased feeling of well-being. AGA (both IgG and IgA classes) and antiendomysium antibodies (AEA) were normal in 19 subjects, 2 cases had IgG-AGA and AEA positivity, 1 patient showed abnormal AGA and AEA levels, while isolated IgA-AGA positivity persisted in 1 case. This study shows that even silent CD cases can clinically benefit from the GFD. The consequences of occasional transgressions to the GFD remain unclear.},

   abstract = {Infant feeding history was investigated in 72 celiac and 288 age-matched reference children in a retrospective questionnaire study. The reply rate was 100% in celiac and 91.6% in reference children. The celiac children were breast-fed for a significantly shorter time than reference children, and they were less often breast-fed at the introduction of gluten. The age of the children at gluten introduction was similar, but the celiac children were significantly more often introduced by a gluten-containing follow-up formula, while the reference children more often started on a gluten-containing porridge. The results can be interpreted in two ways. First, it could be argued that breast milk per se protects against symptoms of celiac disease in childhood. It could, however, also be claimed that breast-feeding merely modulates the gluten introduction, causing a less abrupt introduction of gluten in the baby diet and thereby fewer overt symptoms of the disease.},

   abstract = {OBJECTIVE: Comparison between the usefulness of immunological markers and intestinal biopsy in the diagnosis and follow-up of coeliac disease. MATERIALS AND METHODS: Serum antibodies to gliadin, several dietary proteins and endomysium were appraised in 27 patients with biopsy proven coeliac disease, both while untreated and 6-8 months after gluten withdrawal, when an intestinal biopsy was repeated. Forty-six healthy volunteers entered the study as controls. Antibodies to gliadin and dietary proteins were assessed by ELISA, antibodies to endomysium by indirect immunofluorescence using monkey oesophagus as antigen. RESULTS: Mean antibody levels to dietary proteins were significantly higher in untreated patients as compared to controls. Their titers decreased after gluten withdrawal, but a significant difference was found, except for casein, for the IgA class only. However, because of their unlinear and unpredictable behaviour, they showed a poor reliability. Antigliadin antibodies showed higher diagnostic accuracy, although they also produced false-positive and false-negative results. Anti-endomysium antibodies, albeit the more expensive, proved the more reliable, due to their 100% specificity. CONCLUSION: To date, anti-endomysium antibodies are the most reliable marker for coeliac disease: a positivity warrants an intestinal biopsy. The actual role of antibodies to gliadin, cheaper than endomysium, is during follow-up when many determinations are needed. Antibodies to dietary proteins, useful in the pre-endomysium era, only have a historical role.},

Normally there are immune reactions to dietary proteins, particularly secretory antibodies of IgA class, low titers of serum antibody and specific down-regulation of IgE and T cell reactivity (oral tolerance). From time to time, abnormal immunity to foods, either as inappropriately high titers of antibodies or qualitatively altered responses, produce disease. Lactase deficiency, with dose-related lactose and milk-intolerance, occurs in 50-90% of most populations. White, western Europeans are the exception.},

   abstract = {When compared with the general population, patients with coeliac disease (CD) have an increased risk of developing enteropathy-associated T-cell lymphoma (EATCL), esophageal and pharyngeal squamous carcinomas and small intestinal adenocarcinomas. The prevalence of histologically confirmed CD in Edinburgh and the Lothians in 1979 was 61 per 100,000. The National Health Service Central Records of all 653 subjects registered at that time have been flagged, allowing us to analyse mortality in CD. At a mean of 13.5 years, mortality overall was 1.9-fold that of the general population (115 deaths observed. 61.8 expected; p < 0.0001). For both sexes the early mortality was much greater than expected, but the excess steadily diminished with time from diagnosis. Much of the increased mortality from malignant disease was accounted for by deaths from lymphoproliferative disease and esophageal cancer. Interim re-analysis after a further 9 years shows that the pattern of later deaths is consistent with these trends. Clinical and pathological features of lymphomas in CD are described. In serum samples of 41 patients with normal villus architecture while taking a normal diet, but with minor pathological and/or immunological abnormalities, i.e. potential CD, IgA antiendomysium antibodies were positive in 7 with dermatitis herpetiformis but in only 3 others.},

Two patients with lymphocytic colitis and normal small intestinal biopsies who were administered 40 g of added dietary gluten for four consecutive weeks are presented. Small intestinal biopsies from multiple sites in the proximal small bowel were done after three and four weeks to determine whether pathological changes in latent celiac disease could be induced in these patients with a high gluten-containing diet. In addition, colorectal biopsies were done to determine whether the colitis was sensitive to oral gluten. No alterations in the small intestinal biopsies were detected in either patient and no changes occurred in colitis severity. Although microscopic forms of colitis have been linked to celiac disease, this study indicates that lymphocytic colitis is a heterogeneous clinicopathological disorder that, in some patients, is independent of any gluten-induced intestinal pathological changes.},

The total financial load of gluten intolerance, in its present state, is about 150 million ECU/year in Italy. Four million ECU is actually needed to develop a genetic probe, which may make the population screening feasible.

IgA antiendomysium antibodies (IgA-EMA) were evaluated both as a single test and in combination with IgA-AGA. When screening individuals for CD in a population with no or few symptoms the easy and cheap IgA-AGA assay should be used as a first test and the IgA-EMA to verify the diagnosis and avoid unnecessary biopsies.},

   abstract = {Severe and protracted diarrhea (SPD) is the most severe form of diarrhea in infancy and has also been defined as intractable diarrhea. Its etiology is poorly defined. We have retrospectively evaluated the etiology, the outcome, and the risk factors of 38 children, admitted with protracted diarrhea and need for total parenteral nutrition (TPN) from 1977 to 1993. Children with anatomic abnormalities and/or primary immunodeficiency were excluded. There was an inverse relationship between the number of patients and the age of diarrheal onset (mean age, 2.9 +/- 3.5 months). Etiology of SPD was an enteric infection in 18 cases (eight Salmonella, three Staphylococcus, five rotavirus, one adenovirus, one Cryptosporidium), multiple alimentary intolerance (eight cases), familial microvillous atrophy (two), autoimmune enteropathy (two), celiac disease, lymphangectasia, eosinophilic enteropathy, intestinal pseudoobstruction, and intestinal neurodysplasia (1 case each). Etiology was not detected in three cases. Overall, 12 children died, five are presently being treated, and 21 had full remission. Comparative evaluation of risk factors between children with SPD and a control population of children with diarrhea but without the need for TPN showed that low birth weight, no breast feeding, history of fatal diarrhea in a relative, and early onset of diarrhea had a significantly higher incidence in the former. Social background was similar in the two populations. We conclude that a specific etiology can be identified in the majority of cases of SPD. The etiologic spectrum of SPD is broad, but an enteric infection is the most common cause of SPD. The severity of this condition is related, at least in part, to established risk factors.},

To determine the effect of lipid digestion on CCK release and gall bladder motility, six patients with untreated coeliac disease and a flat jejunal mucosa were studied on two separate days. After an overnight fast, the plasma CCK concentration and gall bladder volume were measured before and at regular intervals after the intraduodenal instillation of 60 ml corn oil (triglycerides) incubated with 40 ml saline or with 40 ml bile and pancreatic juice. The mean (SEM) concentration of free fatty acids in the aqueous phase of corn oil after incubation with bile and pancreatic juice (predigested corn oil) was 78 (35) mM compared with 0.1 (0.1) mM in the aqueous phase of corn oil incubated with saline (undigested corn oil). Integrated plasma CCK in response to predigested corn oil was significantly greater than that in response to undigested corn oil (101 (18) pM. 80 min v-2 (9) pM.80 min; p < 0.005). Similarly, integrated gall bladder contraction in response to predigested corn oil was significantly larger than that after undigested corn oil (817 (210) ml. 80 min v-225 (243) ml. 80 min; p < 0.05). In contrast to undigested corn oil, corn oil that has been predigested with bile and pancreatic juice induces plasma CCK secretion and gall bladder contraction in patients with untreated coeliac disease, presumably by generating and rendering soluble lipolytic products.},

For all eligible subjects, a detailed questionnaire concerning characteristics of abdominal pain and defecatory pattern was completed at presentation. In addition, a battery of screening tests was performed and additional evaluation was done at the discretion of their physician. In all, 227 subjects fulfilled the entrance criteria, but 56 were subsequently excluded because of diagnoses of inflammatory bowel disease (nine cases), lactose malabsorption (46 cases), or celiac disease (one case). Of the remaining 171 patients, 117 had IBS symptoms. In the IBS subjects, lower abdominal discomfort (p < 0.001), cramping pain (p < 0.0009), and increased flatus (p < 0.0003) were more common, whereas dyspeptic symptoms such as epigastric discomfort (p < 0.003), pain radiating to the chest (p < 0.009), and regurgitation (p < 0.02) were more common in the non-IBS subjects. Our study not only confirms the clinical heterogeneity of children with recurrent abdominal pain but also concomitantly demonstrates that most children with this disorder have symptoms that fulfill the standardized criteria for IBS in adults. The identification of subgroups of children with recurrent abdominal pain can provide a framework for the diagnosis of functional bowel disease as well as establish the need for invasive and expensive tests.},

Rats were acclimated to the condition with a 12-hour light-dark cycle for 1 week before surgery. One week after VMH lesions, control and VMH lesioned rats were divided into three groups: sham vagotomy, hepatic vagotomy, and celiac vagotomy. Three days after vagotomy, food intake was measured at 6-hour intervals. Seven days after vagotomy, plasma glucose and insulin were measured at the midpoint of each feeding period. In control rats, hepatic vagotomy destroyed circadian rhythms of plasma glucose and insulin probably due to removal of afferent function. In VMH lesioned rats, celiac vagotomy destroyed circadian rhythm of food intake due to the reduction of plasma insulin by removal of efferent function without affecting the loss of circadian rhythms of plasma glucose and insulin.},

The treatment time ranged from a few days (in case of intolerance symptoms) to 12 months. In 13 children intolerance symptoms or unwillingness to take food was observed: in 4 (12%) after the application of Humana SL and in 9 (21%) after Prosobee. Lack of improvement after Prosobee treatment was observed in 4 (10%) children, and in 4 (12%) children with Humana SL. The partial or total relief of symptoms was observed in others (Humana SL-76%, Prosobee-69%). Analysis showed good results of Humana SL and Prosobee treatment of food allergy and intolerance. Both are usually well tolerated by children, however Humana SL seems to taste better and be better accepted. Intolerance symptoms or lack of improvement were most often observed in children at the age of 1-2 months.},

   abstract = {BACKGROUND: Wheat, rye, and barley damage the small-intestinal mucosa of patients with celiac disease; maize and rice are harmless. The effects of a diet containing oats are uncertain. METHODS: In a randomized trial, we compared the effects of gluten-free diets without oats and with oats (with a goal of 50 to 70 g per day from three sources: two types of wheat-starch flour mixed with an equal amount of oats, muesli containing 60 percent oats, and rolled-oat breakfast cereal). Fifty-two adults with celiac disease in remission were followed for 6 months and 40 with newly diagnosed disease for 12 months. Endoscopy with duodenal biopsy was performed at the beginning and end of the study. RESULTS: The mean (+/- SD) oat intake in the oat group was 49.9 +/- 14.7 g per day at 6 months for patients in remission and 46.6 +/- 13.3 g per day at 12 months for patients with newly diagnosed disease. The oat and control groups did not differ significantly in nutritional status, symptoms, or laboratory measures. Patients in remission, regardless of diet, did not have worsening architecture of the duodenal villi or increased mononuclear-cell infiltration. All the patients with new diagnoses were in remission at one year, except for one in the control group. Six patients in the oat groups and five in the control group withdrew from the study. CONCLUSIONS: Moderate amounts of oats can be included in a gluten-free diet for most adult patients with celiac disease without adverse effects.},

   abstract = {Thrombosis in the visceral arteries is the most common cause of acute mesenteric ischemia. It typically occurs in areas of atherosclerotic narrowing. Atherosclerosis of splanchnic blood vessels also causes chronic mesenteric ischemia. In the present study, the occurrence of atherosclerosis in the celiac and mesenteric arteries was evaluated in an unselected Finnish autopsy series of 120 patients. Thirty-five patients (29%) had stenosis in the first few centimetres of mesenteric arteries. In 18 cases (15%) at least two mesenteric arteries were stenotic. The celiac artery was the most common site of mesenteric artery stenosis. More distally, only hemodynamically insignificant signs of macroscopic atherosclerosis, fatty streaks or fibrous plaques, observed. The occurrence of mesenteric artery stenosis was strongly associated with aging. Sixty-seven per cent of the subjects aged 80 or more presented with mesenteric artery stenosis, whereas the rate was 6% among those aged less than 40 years. Despite sometimes extensive stenotic alterations in the mesenteric arteries, only one patient in our study had bowel necrosis at autopsy. We conclude that atherosclerosis of mesenteric arteries commonly affects individuals of advanced age. As a part of general arteriosclerotic process of the circulatory system, mesenteric artery atherosclerosis is strongly associated with atherosclerosis in coronary arteries. In addition, there was an association between atherosclerosis in mesenteric arteries and cerebral arteries in the skull base. Thus, a characteristic triad of postprandial abdominal pain, food aversion, and weight loss in an elderly patient with other manifestations of arteriosclerosis should suggest a possibility of the visceral arterial insufficiency.},

   abstract = {BACKGROUND: The purposes of this study were to determine the early and late results of placement of arterial bypass grafts in the treatment of chronic and acute intestinal ischemia and to ascertain whether multiple grafts provide better late results than a single graft. METHODS: Records of 34 patients who underwent mesenteric vascular graft placement were retrospectively reviewed. RESULTS: All 21 patients with chronic ischemia had a history of intestinal angina and weight loss. Food fear was reported by 33% of patients; also, diarrhea in 57%, constipation in 29%, acalculous cholecystitis in 19%, ischemic gastritis or peptic ulcer in 19%, and elevation of liver enzymes in 22% were reported. Angiogram showed more than 50% stenosis or occlusion of the superior mesenteric artery (SMA) in 100% of patients, celiac artery in 90%, and inferior mesenteric artery in 90%. Although not described previously, a reduction in collateral flow from the internal iliac arteries was caused by severe pelvic disease in 56% of patients. There were no in-hospital deaths. The rate of survival at 1 year was 100%; at 2 years it was 93% +/- 6%, at 3 years 86% +/- 9%, at 5 years 79% +/- 11%, and at 10 years 50% +/- 15%. During follow-up, graft thrombosis occurred in three patients. Of the patients who underwent only a single SMA or celiac bypass, two of five died of bowel infarction; only one of 16 patients who underwent both celiac and SMA bypass had to undergo a repeat surgical procedure because of graft occlusion. Three of 16 retrograde bypasses thrombosed, compared with zero of five prograde bypasses. In nine patients who underwent placement of mesenteric bypass grafts because of acute ischemia caused by acute mesenteric thrombosis, the early mortality rate was 22%; the two deaths were the result of bowel ischemia. The cumulative survival rate was 78% +/- 14% at 1 month, 65% +/- 17% at 1 year, and 52% +/- 16% at 5 years. One of the two late deaths was due to graft thrombosis and bowel infarction. Three of four patients who underwent concomitant mesenteric bypass at the time of aneurysm repair or aortobifemoral bypass survived the surgical procedure. CONCLUSIONS: When chronic and acute mesenteric ischemia are diagnosed and treated with a bypass graft, the early and late results are good. Complete revascularization of the SMA and celiac artery or pelvis or both and prograde bypass may reduce the risk of late bowel ischemia.},

METHODS: Forty untreated and 52 coeliac patients in remission were admitted to the study. The control group included 77 persons. Four-day food records, anthropometric measurements, and blood biochemistry were examined to obtain nutrient intake and nutritional status. RESULTS: Concentrations of serum ferritin, vitamin B12, and erythrocyte folate were lower in patients with untreated coeliac disease than in those in remission. Altogether, 15-38% of the untreated patients but only 0-20% of the patients in remission had levels of haemoglobin, serum ferritin, iron, vitamin B12, or erythrocyte folate below the reference values. No difference in anthropometric measurements was found between the two groups of coeliac patients. CONCLUSIONS: Except for some subclinical abnormal values in biochemical analyses in 20-38% of coeliac patients, nutritional status was quite normal in both groups of coeliac patients.},

   abstract = {The spontaneous feeding behavior of adult male rats was monitored during continuous infusion of the bombesin receptor antagonist BW2258U89 into the coeliac artery (100 micrograms kg-1 h-1) from an osmotic minipump. Nocturnal food intake was suppressed over 5 days of testing. Similar effects followed acute BW2258U89 treatment [100 micrograms kg-1, intraperitoneally (i.p.)]. Moreover, i.p. BW2258U89 mimicked the acute behavioral effects of 2 micrograms kg-1 i.p. bombesin by reducing meal size. Verifying that BW2258U89 can retain its potency throughout the entire period of chronic infusion, we demonstrated that the acute anorectic action of bombesin (4 micrograms kg-1, i.p.) was blocked by pretreatment with a BW2258U89 solution (100 micrograms ml-1 kg-1, i.p.) that was freshly prepared, or incubated for 1 or 6 days at body temperature. These data demonstrate that acute and chronic administration of BW2258U89, at a dose that abolishes the satiety effect of bombesin, significantly suppresses spontaneous feeding. Thus, BW2258U89 appears to attenuate food intake by acting as a partial agonist at peripheral receptors for bombesin-like peptides.},

We studied the permeability to human alpha-lactalbumin, beta-lactoglobulin, mannitol, and lactulose on 46 occasions in 33 celiac disease patients in various phases of the disease; in addition, mannitol and lactulose permeability was studied in 18 healthy controls. Lactalbumin absorption was detected in 19 of 42 patients tested, more often in celiac disease patients with villous atrophy than in those with normal jejunal biopsy (p = 0.01). Higher absorption of lactalbumin was found in patients with subtotal villous atrophy than in those with normal biopsy (p = 0.02). beta-lactoglobulin was found in four of 42 patients tested. Less mannitol was absorbed by patients with either subtotal or partial villous atrophy than by those with normal histology (p = 0.001 and 0.006, respectively). Lactulose recovery was higher in newly diagnosed patients and patients with subtotal villous atrophy than in controls (p = 0.007 and 0.03, respectively). The lactulose/mannitol ratio was higher in newly diagnosed patients and patients with villous atrophy than in controls (p = 0.002 and 0.002, respectively). The correlation between permeability to lactalbumin and mannitol and lactulose was poor. We conclude that permeability to proteins and sugar molecules is abnormal in celiac disease patients with mucosal damage and that they probably reflect different mechanisms of penetration.},

   abstract = {Bone mineral content was measured in the whole body, the spine (L2-L4) and hip by Dual Photonic Absorpciometry (densitometer Norland 2600 Gd-153), in seventeen celiac patients, aged 6 to 12 years, with good adherence to the gluten free diet. The diagnosed was made before 30 months of age in 50% of cases. Average treatment duration was 69.8 +/- 36 months. The randomly selected control group was composed of 48 school age children, of the same age and sex of patients. Total bone mass (TBM) and bone mineral density (BMD) were expressed as Z scores on the basis of normal values established by the authors in Chilean children. Celiac patients had lower TBM and BMD of whole body, than controls (-1.11 +/- 0.94 vs 0.00 +/- 0.85 and -0.59 +/- 0.76 vs 0.06 +/- 0.84, respectively) and at the spine (-0.79 +/- 1.04 vs 0.003 +/- 0.92 and -1.49 +/- 0.99 vs 0.06 +/- 0.87 respectively). A lower TBM was founded at the hip (-0.62 +/- 1.28 vs -0.08 +/- 0.82) without differences in BMD. Celiac patients had a lower bone mass than controls despite early diagnosis and good compliance with the gluten-free diet. These differences could not be atributed entirely to the lower height of celiac patients. These results suggest that celiac patients constitute a risk group for development of osteoporosis later in life. This fact should be taken into consideration in the treatment of this condition.},

   abstract = {The pathophysiology of diarrhea, especially in the otherwise healthy child, is still poorly understood. The aim of this study was to use the scanning electron microscope (SEM) to examine the surface of the jejunal mucosa of children with chronic nonspecific diarrhea (CNSD) (n = 9) and to compare the findings with specimens obtained from children with (n = 21) and without (n = 11) other gastrointestinal diseases. Light microscopy of the specimens from children with CNSD was normal. However, SEM showed the presence of bacterial colonization with predominantly coccoid organisms in 100% of cases. This colonization was associated with loss of glycocalyx and clumping of the microvilli. The children with celiac disease (n = 9) all showed characteristic appearances with light microscopy, but only one had bacterial colonization on SEM. The surface features of specimens from children with other gastrointestinal disorders (food intolerance, postenteritis syndrome, protracted diarrhea of infancy, and immune deficiency states) were very similar to those from the CNSD group. Bacteria were visible on 89% of specimens, and in half of these cases the organisms were bacilli. SEM of specimens from children with no gastrointestinal disease (ages 11-107 months) suggested an increased density of villi/unit area with advancing age. Bacteria were present in only two cases and did not include bacilli. The findings suggest that bacterial colonization of the surface of the small intestine is common in children with several gastrointestinal diseases and may play a part in their pathogenesis. Routine SEM examination of jejunal biopsies provides information not available from standard light microscopy, which may be relevant to the treatment of children with chronic diarrhea.},

   abstract = {Expression of major histocompatibility (MHC) class II molecules by enterocytes is known to be enhanced in coeliac disease and other disorders characterised by intestinal inflammation--an effect thought to be mediated via intestinal lymphocytes. To investigate if food peptides can exert direct effects on class II expression, the influence of gliadins, casein, and beta lactoglobulin on an intestinal epithelial cell line (HT-29) was examined in the absence of immune cells. Class II expression was determined by flow cytometry and immunofluorescence microscopy using antibodies against the beta chain of all products of the gene subregions DR, DQ, and DP. MHC expression was low in HT-29 cells but could be stimulated by interferon gamma. Tryptin digested gliadin had no effect on class II expression. In the presence of interferon gamma, however, it was able to amplify MHC class II expression to mean (SEM) 150 (4)%. Casein exerted a similar effect (160 (14)%), but undigested gliadin, tryptin digested casein, and beta lactoglobulin had no influence. The observations suggest that within the concert of cytokine mediated interactions between enterocytes and lymphocytes, some dietary peptides could upregulate the presentation of food antigens, leading to a more efficient stimulation of lymphocytes, which in the case of coeliac disease might result in damage to the enterocytes.},

This disease is characterized by changes in the mucosal lining of the small intestine. The mucosal lining is damaged by protein fragments of gliadin, which is found in gluten (wheat, rye, barley, oats), and the small intestine is unable to carry out its main functions of digestion and absorption. The treatment for this disease is to discontinue gluten from the diet permanently. Once gluten is removed from the diet, the small intestine begins to heal itself. As the healing process continues, digestion and absorption resume. Celiac Sprue does not go away. A gluten-free diet must be maintained for the rest of one's life.},

Fecal fatty acids were analyzed by the gas chromatographic method. Fecal fat excretion by normal individuals was 1.7 +/- 1.0 (Mean +/- SD) g/day (range, 0.4-4.9 g/day). Steatorrhea was therefore defined as fecal fat excretion that exceeded 5.0 g/day. The patients with CP were divided into three groups: non-steatorrhea (fecal fat < 5.0 g/day), chemical steatorrhea (fecal fat > or = 5 g/day and no appearance of fatty stool), and manifest steatorrhea (evaluated from the appearance of fatty stool). In addition, we investigated the correlation between fecal fat excretion and pancreatic exocrine function, obtained by the pancreozymin-secretin (or secretin) test in 24 controls and 30 CP patients. Fecal fat excretion by CP patients was 9.1 +/- 8.8 g/day, which was significantly higher (P < 0.01) than that of controls. There were 28 (65%) CP patients with steatorrhea. Of these, 15 (35%) showed chemical steatorrhea and 13 (30%) manifest steatorrhea. In CP patients, the fecal mass (250.5 +/- 133.6 g vs control, 125.6 +/- 52.5 g), fecal fat concentration (3.40 +/- 2.16 g% vs control, 1.48 +/- 0.89 g%), and coefficient of fat absorption (77.3 +/- 20.2% vs control, 97.2 +/- 1.7%) all showed significant differences from the controls.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS)},

Faecal fat excretion was evaluated before and after drug administration. Faecal fat excretion was reduced by 2.9 g (range, 1.7 to 5.0 g) in group I; 8.8 g (range, 2.9 to 39.9 g) in group II; 10.8 g (range, 2.3 to 21.8 g) in group III; and 4.3 g (range, 3.6 to 5.6 g) in group IV. The pancreatic digestive enzyme preparation was more effective than sodium bicarbonate and agents that raise the pH of the upper small intestine (such as proton-pump inhibitors) in reducing faecal fat excretion. The results indicate that all of the preparations used are effective against mild pancreatic steatorrhoea. If the condition is more advanced, however, a massive dosage of pancreatic digestive enzyme and possibly the combined use of an agent to raise the pH of the upper small intestine are likely to be effective.},

   abstract = {Nutrition and intestinal function are intimately interrelated. The chief purpose of the gut is to digest and absorb nutrients in order to maintain life. Consequently, chronic gastrointestinal (GI) disease commonly results in malnutrition and increased morbidity and mortality. For example, studies have shown that 50-70% of adult patients with Crohn's disease were weight-depleted and 75% of adolescents growth-retarded. On the other hand, chronic malnutrition impairs digestive and absorptive function because food and nutrients are not only the major trophic factors to the gut but also provide the building blocks for digestive enzymes and absorptive cells. For example, recent studies of ours have shown that a weight loss of greater than 30% accompanying a variety of diseases was associated with a reduction in pancreatic enzyme secretion of over 80%, villus atrophy and impaired carbohydrate and fat absorption. Finally, specific nutrients can induce disease, for example, gluten-sensitive enteropathy, whilst dietary factors such as fibre, resistant starch, short-chain fatty acids, glutamine and fish-oils may prevent gastrointestinal diseases such as diverticulitis, diversion colitis, ulcerative colitis, colonic adenomatosis and colonic carcinoma. The role of dietary antigens in the aetiology of Crohn's disease is controversial, but controlled studies have suggested that elemental diets may be as effective as corticosteroids in inducing a remission in patients with acute Crohn's disease. In conclusion, nutrition has both a supportive and therapeutic role in the management of chronic gastrointestinal diseases. With the development of modern techniques of nutritional support, the morbidity and mortality associated with chronic GI disease can be reduced. On the other hand, dietary manipulation may be used to treat to prevent specific GI disorders such as coeliac disease, functional bowel disease, Crohn's disease and colonic neoplasia. The future development of nutria-pharmaceuticals is particularly attractive in view of their low cost and wide safety margins.},

   abstract = {A substantial minority of patients with coeliac disease (estimated at anything between 7 and 30%) fail to respond to treatment with a gluten-free diet. Non-responsiveness may be primary, that is when the patient fails to respond to treatment following initial diagnosis, or secondary, when a patient who has previously had a documented response to gluten exclusion becomes non-responsive to therapy. The commonest cause of non-responsiveness is continued gluten ingestion, either voluntary or inadvertent. Other causes to be considered include intolerances to dietary constituents other than gluten (e.g. milk, soya), pancreatic insufficiency, enteropathy-associated T-cell lymphoma and ulcerative jejunitis. There is some evidence that ulcerative jejunitis is, in fact, a manifestation of lymphoma. The most important steps in the management of the non-responsive coeliac patient are (a) to determine whether the patient is indeed coeliac, (b) to exclude lymphoma and (c) to establish the cause of the non-responsiveness. In those coeliac patients with no demonstrable cause for non-responsiveness, a variety of therapeutic stratagems (mostly based on small, uncontrolled studies) have been described; these include elimination diets, dietary supplementation with zinc and copper, and pharmacological therapy in the form of steroids, azathioprine and cyclosporin. In a minority of non-responsive patients, the clinical course is characterized by a rapid decline, and total parenteral nutrition is required. None of the therapies described above has been subjected to rigorous controlled studies. The precise mechanisms of non-responsiveness in coeliac patients need to be unravelled before rational therapeutic approaches can be established.},

We investigated whether this increase reflects a recruitment of individuals with less predisposing HLA genotypes. METHODS: Genomic HLA-DRB1, -DQA1, and -DQB1 typing was performed in 135 Swedish patients (48 belonging to a low- and 81 to a high-incidence cohort) and 179 controls. The distribution of HLA class-II genotypes in the cohorts was compared. RESULTS: DQA1*0501 and DQB1*02 conferred increased risk for CD, and a gene dosage effect of DQB1*02 was found. The distribution of HLA genotypes among the cohorts did not differ. CONCLUSIONS: The results suggest that Swedish CD patients do not differ in genetic susceptibility compared with other populations. No evidence was found suggesting that the increase would be a result of more frequent development of disease in individuals carrying less predisposing HLA genotypes.},

We therefore performed a prospective study to determine the incidence and clinical presentation of celiac disease in Jordanian children. A total of 34 (12 boys and 22 girls) cases were diagnosed over a period of 36 months. Nine cases were clustered in three families. The incidence was calculated to be 1:2,800 live births. The mean age at presentation was 4.6 years (range 0.3-13), but it was 8.4 years at the time of diagnosis. Diarrhea was the main initial symptom in 15 (44%) patients. Other signs and symptoms included recurrent abdominal pain in five patients (14%), short stature in four (12%), abdominal distension in three (9%), constipation in three (9%), pallor and recurrent mouth ulcers in two patients each. At the time of diagnosis, 24 (71%) had hypochromic microcytic anemia, and nine (26%) had rickets. The relatively high incidence of celiac disease may be related to the large wheat consumption in this population (135 kg/head/year), and the late onset could be related to the widespread prevalence of prolonged breast-feeding in Jordan (12 months) and late introduction of cereals (6.2 months) in children with late presentation. The delay in diagnosis might be due to the presence of other diseases clinically resembling celiac disease in our community.},

These components were characterized by a combination of reverse-phase high-performance liquid chromatography, immunoblotting using a coeliac serum and microsequencing analysis. This allowed the identification of a group of secalins with different molecular masses according to their N-terminal amino-acid sequence: one omega-type secalin of 40 kDa (omega 1-40); three gamma-type secalins, one of 70 kDa (gamma-70) and two of 35 kDa (gamma-35); as well as two low molecular mass glycoproteins of 15 and 18 kDa, all exhibiting coeliac serum antigenicity. Moreover, four additional rye components, including two low molecular mass proteins, which did not react with coeliac sera, have also been identified. Analysis by matrix-assisted laser desorption/ionization time-of-flight mass spectrometry (MALDI-TOF MS) of the three main purified coeliac immunogenic secalins, gamma-70, gamma-35 and omega 1-40, indicated molecular masses of 71457, 32240 and 39117 Da, respectively. The omega 1-40 secalin displays a significant absorption in the visible region which could be related to its peculiar low capacity to bind both coeliac sera antibodies and Coomassie brilliant blue dye.},

In total, 390 determinations of CEA (201 for CD, 27 for FA and 162 for UD) and 558-IgE (238, 136 and 184, respectively) were carried out during disease aggravations and remissions. The analysis of CEA mean values with respect to sex revealed no differences while IgE level in boys with UD was twice as high as in girls. No differences in CEA or IgE levels were found with respect to the season of the year. The IgE concentration increased during aggravations, but only in the case of UD was the difference statistically significant. CEA behaviour was similar (statistically significant differences for CD and very significant for UD). Both values, however, were normal.},

   abstract = {BACKGROUND & AIMS: Fat and complex carbohydrates in the distal bowel activate "brakes" inhibiting upper gut motility. The hypothesis of this study was that rapid transit carcinoid diarrhea in association with steatorrhea results in impairment of gastric emptying. METHODS: Fifteen patients with carcinoid diarrhea without prior gastrointestinal resection or whose small bowel resection was limited to < 100 cm of ileum were studied. Gastrointestinal transit was measured scintigraphically with a standardized meal. Percentage of ingested fat excretion was calculated. RESULTS: Mean length of small bowel resected was 33 cm, and mean 24-hour urine 5-hydroxyindoleacetic acid was 120 mg. Fourteen patients had increased daily stool weights, and 10 had increased stool fat excretion (mean, 13%). Transit was accelerated in the small bowel in 14 and in the colon in all patients. The lag time for gastric emptying was prolonged in 2 patients who had no previous resection. Gastric emptying rate was accelerated in 5, normal in 7, and delayed in 3 patients. CONCLUSIONS: Ileal and colonic brakes do not seem to delay gastric emptying in patients with carcinoid diarrhea associated with rapid transit and mild to moderate steatorrhea.},

Levels of epithelial cell proliferation were measured in children with food intolerance (cows' milk protein intolerance and coeliac disease), and after infection with Giardia lamblia, Cryptosporidium, and enteropathogenic Escherichia coli. METHODS: Comparative measures of epithelial cell proliferation were performed by recording mitotic activity and MIB-1 immunoreactivity in proximal small intestinal biopsy specimens. RESULTS/CONCLUSIONS: A hyperplastic crypt response was evident in all of the disease states examined and was particularly pronounced in coeliac disease and in infection with enteropathogenic E coli, where mitotic and MIB-1 labelling indices were significantly raised above control values. In contrast with coeliac disease, increased crypt cell production rates in enteropathogenic E coli infection were also due to an expansion of the crypt proliferation compartment, without a comparable increase in crypt cell numbers. Crypt hyperplasia is therefore a common tissue response to mucosal damage in food allergy and infection, although disease specific mechanisms are evident.},

We have identified populations of fibers that respond with increased neurophysiological discharge rates to gastric loads, duodenal loads, and close celiac arterial administration of a brain-gut peptide, cholecystokinin. Load-sensitive fibers with gastric and duodenal mechanoreceptive fields are able to integrate information arising from mechanical and peptidergic stimulation, where cholecystokinin octapeptide (CCK) administration potentiates subsequent responses to distending loads, and synergizes with distending loads to produce greater excitation than either load stimulus alone or peptide stimulation alone. In addition, we have identified situations where the duodenal presence of nutrients modifies the vagal afferent activity of gastric load-sensitive fibers. Thus, our approach can mimic the temporal and spatial distribution of meal-related stimuli in the gut, and reveals the potential for nutrients in one gastrointestinal compartment to affect neutral signals arising from another gut compartment.},

Duodenal, but not gastric, loads increased discharge rates in these slowly adapting fibers. CCK alone excited these fibers, and CCK pretreatment amplified subsequent duodenal load responses. Furthermore, duodenal loads generated greater responses when combined with CCK infusions. The small (< 3 mm) receptive fields of these fibers were localized to the ventral wall of the proximal duodenum, with C fiber conduction velocities (< 2 m/s). These results demonstrate for the first time rat duodenal load-sensitive vagal afferents. They can integrate signals arising from CCK and duodenal loads, and may mediate aspects of the role of CCK in the inhibition of gastric emptying and the control of food intake.},

   abstract = {Work continues to progress in the unravelling of the molecular interactions involved in the pathogenesis of coeliac disease. The immunogenetics of the disease implicate certain HLA DQ alleles as necessary for subsequent disease development. These HLA molecules have been shown to be necessary in the binding and presentation of gliadin peptides to antigen-specific T cells. Current work is examining the precise HLA-antigen interaction that may lead to the development of antigen-blocking agents. The isolation of antigen-specific T cells has led to the confirmation of a toxic T-cell epitope of the gliadin protein (residues 31-49) and it would appear likely that additional toxic epitopes may be similarly characterized in the near future. No common TCR motifs have so far been detected, although these may become apparent as this work progresses. The gliadin peptide sequence, residues 31-49, has now been demonstrated to be toxic in vivo. Additional toxic T-cell epitopes may also be present within gliadins, but this identification of a toxic gliadin sequence for the first time raises the possibility of future manipulation of the wheat genome (and other toxic cereals) that could lead to the development of new graminae cereals with the properties of wheat, but which do not induce toxicity in patients with coeliac disease.},

   abstract = {Under the umbrella of coeliac disease (CD), or gluten-sensitive enteropathy, the concepts of silent, latent and potential CD have recently been introduced. While silent CD is marked by severe damage to the jejunal mucosa in the absence of clinical symptoms, both latent and potential CD are characterized by jejunal mucosa that would be reported as normal by most clinical pathologists in an individual on a gluten-containing diet. As opposed to potential coeliac patients, latent subjects sometimes in their life have had a flat jejunal biopsy which recovered on a gluten-free diet. Latent coeliac patients are often symptomatic; neither high titres of gliadin antibodies nor mucosal changes (including raised intraepithelial lymphocyte counts) are obligate features of latent CD, although the presence of elevated endomysial antibodies is probably the best predictor of progression towards villous atrophy. The term potential CD has been proposed for those subjects who do not have, and have never had, a jejunal biopsy consistent with overt CD, and yet have immunological abnormalities similar to those found in coeliac patients. Good markers of potential CD include the presence of serum endomysial antibodies, a high count of intraepithelial lymphocytes and subtle pathological alteration such as increased density of intraepithelial lymphocytes expressing gamma delta T cell receptor, signs of activated mucosal cell-mediated immunity, coeliac-like intestinal antibody pattern, and positive rectal gluten challenge.},

All patient sera revealed polymorphic IgA and IgG binding to cereal peptides with molecular weights of 11-97 kD. The antibody staining was essentially identical with atopic dermatitis patients and controls. Patients with dermatitis herpetiformis or celiac disease showed more intensive staining with the ethanol extract of wheat and showed more IgA-stained bands in immunoblotting. It seems that the presence of IgA and IgG antibodies to different cereal antigens is a result of natural exposure and in atopic dermatitis displays little diagnostic significance, in contrast to antigliadin antibody response in dermatitis herpetiformis and celiac disease.},

To specify the neural pathways and receptor locations of this feedback, we examined the effects of intraduodenal infusions of 10 nutrients plus saline on short-term food intake of rats with selective deafferentations of vagal celiac branches. Three response profiles were observed: 1) isotonic saline, 5.6% glycerol, and 3% fructose did not inhibit intake of controls or selectively deafferented animals; 2) 3% glucose, 3% maltose, 3% L-phenylalanine, 12% Isocal, and 1.4% oleic acid suppressed intake of controls, but this inhibition was eliminated by vagal celiac deafferentation; and 3) 3% casein hydrolysate and 24% Isocal suppressed intake of controls and rats with selective vagotomies, although the latter exhibited significantly less suppression. In addition, elimination of celiac afferents chronically reduced meal size (i.e., first 30-min intake) without reducing daily food intake or body weight. Furthermore, D-phenylalanine infusions produced a delayed suppression of food intake in controls (possibly from intraluminal irritation); however, this reduction was eliminated with celiac deafferentation. Overall, this experiment indicates that vagal celiac afferents are critical for preabsorptive detection of some energy-yielding molecules or properties of nutrient solutions (as well as, perhaps, intraluminal inflammation), but not others, which are still detected, although only partially.},

Surprisingly only 24 CD patients were found among the Danish children, compared with 155 in the Swedish group, despite the close ethnic, geographical, and cultural background of the two populations. The Swedish CD children were diagnosed at an earlier age than the Danish children (mean, 1.5 vs. 5.5 years). The symptoms of the Swedish patients were dominated by failure to thrive (93 vs. 71%), whereas a higher proportion of the Danish CD patients suffered from stomach pain (21 vs. 5%). Breast-feeding habits were comparable. The estimated content of gliadin in the officially recommended diets of the two countries in 1987 differed substantially, the Swedish diet containing more than 40 times more gliadin than the Danish (4,400 vs. 100 mg) at the age of 8 months, and 4 times more (3,600 vs. 900 mg) at the age of 12 months. The Danish infant diet differed significantly from the Swedish in containing a larger amount of the lower gluten-containing rye flour. The earlier introduction of food items with a high gluten content in the Swedish compared with the Danish diet seems to be an obvious explanation for the great difference in incidence and symptomatology of CD between the two populations.},

   abstract = {Of 771 children (381 Swedish and 390 Danish) investigated during 1972-1989 because of suspected coeliac disease (CD), 179 proved to have the disease. Surprisingly only 24 CD patients were Danish whereas 155 were Swedish, despite the very similar ethnic, geographical, and cultural backgrounds of the two populations. The Danish CD children were diagnosed at an older age (mean 5.5 versus 1.5 years). Breastfeeding habits were comparable. The estimated content of gliadin in the officially recommended diets of the two countries in 1987 differed substantially, the Swedish diet containing more than 40 times more gliadin than the Danish (4400 mg versus 100 mg) at the age of eight months, and four times more (3600 mg versus 900 mg) at the age of 12 months. Compared to the Swedish diet, the Danish infant diet contained significantly larger amounts of rye flour, which is low in gluten. The earlier introduction of food items with a high gluten content in the Swedish as compared with the Danish diet could be a possible explanation for the great difference in incidence and symptomatology of CD between the two populations.},

   abstract = {In recent years, remarkable progress has been made in the elucidation of cereal protein structure and its relation to coeliac toxicity. Gluten proteins of wheat can be classified according to their primary structure into high-, medium- and low-molecular-weight (HMW, MMW, LMW) groups. Each of these groups contains two or three different protein types having partly homologous, partly unique, structural elements: chi- and gamma-type HMW subunits of glutenin (HMW group), omega 5 and omega 1,2-type gliadins (MMW group) and alpha-type gliadins, gamma-type gliadins and LMW subunits of glutenin (LMW group). Numerous proteins from the same type do exist with only a few modifications of the amino-acid sequence. The structure of the HMW and LMW group proteins can be divided into three and five domains, respectively. Most typical for each type and unique for cereals are the glutamine- and proline-rich domains containing repetitive sequences (HMW group: domain B; LMW group: domain I). omega-type gliadins consist almost entirely of repetitive sequences. Rye and barley, closely related to wheat, have protein types homologous to those of wheat. Early investigations showed that wheat gluten and, in particular, the alcohol-soluble gliadin fraction contained the factor toxic for coeliac patients. Equivalent protein fractions of rye, barley and probably oats were also considered to be toxic. The effects of toxic proteins were not destroyed by digestion with pepsin, trypsin and pancreatin. In-vivo (instillation) testing established the toxicity of alpha-type gliadins, and in-vitro (organ culture) testing of gliadin peptides demonstrated that the N-terminal region (domain I) of alpha-type gliadins is involved in activating coeliac disease. The longest sequences common for toxic peptides were found to be -Pro-Ser-Gln-Gln- and -Gln-Gln-Gln-Pro-. Various in-vitro tests and two in-vivo studies on synthetic peptides support the importance of one or both of these sequences. They do not occur in non-toxic food proteins and are characterized by their ability to form a beta-turn conformation. Although these sequences are probably not sufficient for toxicity in themselves, and other amino-acid residues are additionally required, they could serve as the starting point for further investigation.},

   abstract = {Gliadin, the alcohol-soluble protein fraction of wheat, contains the factor toxic for coeliac patients. The numerous components of gliadin can be classified according to their primary structure into omega 5-, omega 1,2-, alpha- and gamma-type. Both omega-types have almost entirely repetitive amino acid sequences consisting of glutamine, proline and phenylalanine. alpha- and gamma-type gliadins contain four and five different domains, respectively, and are homologous within the domains III and V. Unique for each alpha- and gamma-type is domain I, which consists mostly of repetitive sequences rich in glutamine, proline and aromatic amino acids. Coeliac toxicity of gliadin is not destroyed by digestion with gastropancreatic enzymes. In vivo testing established the toxicity of alpha-type gliadins and in vitro testing of gliadin peptides revealed that domain I of alpha-type gliadins is involved in activating coeliac disease. The sequences -Pro-Ser-Gln-Gln- and -Gln-Gln-Gln-Pro- were demonstrated to be common for toxic gliadin peptides. Most of the in vivo and in vitro studies of synthetic peptides confirmed the importance of one or both of these sequences. Cultivated hexaploid, tetraploid and diploid wheat species do not differ significantly in potential toxic sequences of alpha-type gliadins.},
