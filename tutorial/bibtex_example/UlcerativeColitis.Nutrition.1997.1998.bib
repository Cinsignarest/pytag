   abstract = {We have used cyclosporin to treat patients with acute steroid-resistant ulcerative colitis since the beginning of 1991. Of the 55 patients so far elected for treatment, 40 received the drug intravenously at 2 mg/kg/day for 14 days, with the responders being maintained on traditional soft-gelatin-capsule cyclosporin at a dose of 6-8 mg/kg/day for 6 months; the remaining 15 received oral microemulsion cyclosporin, 5 mg/kg/day, for 3 months. The doses were titrated to ensure whole-blood drug concentrations of 60-240 ng/ml, with levels of approximately 200 ng/ml being attained by both regimens. One-hundred percent of the patients receiving oral microemulsion cyclosporin and 65% of those receiving the intravenous regimen achieved a short-term response (p = 0.011). Both the responder subsets received additional azathioprine and relapsed on treatment with the same frequency of 40%. However, 17% of the patients who received intravenous cyclosporin developed major toxicity (including one fatality), whereas no major toxicity was observed in the oral microemulsion cyclosporin group. The microemulsion formulation was therefore more effective than intravenous cyclosporin in achieving the short-term remission of steroid-unresponsive ulcerative colitis. As the maintenance drug, it led to the same frequency of disease relapse as traditional oral cyclosporin. However, because it did not involve invasive in-hospital procedures or cause major toxicity, it was more efficient than the combination of the intravenous and traditional oral drug.},

   abstract = {BACKGROUND: The etiology of inflammatory bowel disease is unclear, and the role played by anxiety and depression is highly controversial. Anxiety and depression in patients with inflammatory bowel disease could be secondary to disabling symptoms, but the interaction between physical morbidity and psychologic illness in these subjects has not been sufficiently investigated. Patients with inflammatory bowel disease are nevertheless frequently undernourished, but there are no studies on the association between anxiety and depression and malnutrition. This study was designed to characterize anxiety and depression in subjects affected by inflammatory bowel disease and to establish the influence of physical morbidity and/or nutritional status on psychologic disorders. METHODS: Seventy-nine consecutive patients, 43 with Crohn's disease (CD) and 36 with ulcerative colitis (UC), were enrolled in the study. An index of the disease activity and physical morbidity was obtained by the simplified Crohn's Disease Activity Index and Truelove-Witts criteria and using the Clinical Rating Scale. Thirty-six healthy volunteers were studied as controls. All the subjects were given the State and Trait Anxiety Inventory (STAI) test and the Zung self-rating Depression Scale. RESULTS: The percentage of subjects with state anxiety was significantly higher in the CD (P < 0.001) and UC (P < 0.001) groups than in control subjects. There was no significant difference in trait anxiety among groups. The percentage of subjects with depression was significantly higher in the CD (P < 0.05) and UC (P < 0.05) groups than in control subjects. State anxiety and depression were significantly associated with physical morbidity and correlated with malnutrition in CD and UC patients. CONCLUSION: Anxiety and depression in patients with inflammatory bowel disease could be reactive to the disabling symptoms and to malnutrition. As measured with the STAI, personality trait of anxiety does not seem to play an important role in inflammatory bowel disease.},

   abstract = {OBJECTIVE: To examine prospectively the relationship between self-reported regular use of nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drugs (NSAIDs) and acetaminophen and the risk of symptomatic diverticular disease. DESIGN: Prospective cohort study using a mailed baseline questionnaire in 1986, and follow-up every 2 years through 1992. SETTING: Male health professionals residing in 50 US states. PATIENTS: A total of 35 615 male health professionals (dentists, optometrists, veterinarians, physicians, pharmacists, osteopathic physicians, podiatrists) 40 to 75 years of age at baseline and free of diagnosed diverticular disease, colon or rectal polyp, ulcerative colitis, and cancer prior to 1988. MAIN OUTCOME MEASURES: Follow-up questionnaires in 1988, 1990, and 1992 about use of NSAIDs, acetaminophen, and other variables including the diagnosis of symptomatic diverticular disease. RESULTS: During 4 years of follow-up, we documented 310 newly diagnosed cases of symptomatic diverticular disease. After adjustment for age, physical activity, and energy-adjusted dietary fiber and total fat intake, regular and consistent use of NSAIDs and acetaminophen was positively associated with the overall risk of symptomatic diverticular disease (for users vs nonusers, relative risk [RR] for NSAIDs = 2.24, 95% confidence interval [CI], 1.28-3.91; RR for acetaminophen = 1.81, 95% CI, 0.79-4.11). Most of this positive association was attributable to cases associated with bleeding, particularly for acetaminophen (for users vs nonusers, RR for NSAIDs = 4.64, 95% CI, 0.99-21.74; RR for acetaminophen = 13.63, 95% CI, 3.53-52.60). CONCLUSIONS: These results suggest that regular and consistent use of NSAIDs in general and acetaminophen is associated with symptoms of severe diverticular disease, particularly bleeding. Further research is needed to investigate the potentially deleterious effect of NSAIDs and other medications on the lower gastrointestinal tract.},

The insoluble component of fiber was inversely associated with risk of diverticular disease relative risk (RR) = 0. 63, 95% confidence interval (CI), 0.44-0.91, P for trend = 0.02, and this association was particularly strong for cellulose (RR = 0.52, 95% CI, 0.36-0.75, P for trend = 0.002). The association between diverticular disease and total dietary fiber intake calculated from the AOACstandards method was not appreciably different from results using the Southgate or Englyst method [for AOAC method, RR = 0.60, 95% CI, 0.41-0.87; for Southgate method, RR = 0.61, 95% CI, 0.42-0. 88; for Englyst method, RR = 0.60, 95% CI, 0.42-0.87, for the highest quintiles]. Our findings provide evidence for the hypothesis that a diet high in dietary fiber decreases the risk of diverticular disease, and this result was not sensitive to the use of different analytic techniques to define dietary fiber. Our findings suggest that the insoluble component of fiber was significantly associated with a decreased risk of diverticular disease, and this inverse association was particularly strong for cellulose.},

However, few studies have examined the mode of action of glutamine in reducing intestinal damage. AIMS: To examine the effects of glutamine supplemented elemental diets on the potent inflammatory cytokines interleukin 8 (IL-8) and tumour necrosis factor alpha (TNF-alpha) in trinitrobenzene sulphonic acid (TNBS) induced colitis which presents with both acute and chronic features of ulcerative colitis. METHODS: Sprague-Dawley rats were randomised into three dietary groups and fed 20% casein (controls), or 20% casein supplemented with either 2% glutamine (2% Gln) or 4% glutamine (4% Gln). After two weeks they received intracolonic TNBS to induce colitis. RESULTS: Both Gln groups of rats gained more weight than the control group (p < 0.05) which had progressive weight loss. Colon weight, macroscopic, and microscopic damage scores for the Gln groups were lower than in the control group (p < 0.05). IL-8 and TNF-alpha concentrations in inflamed colonic tissues were lower in the Gln groups than in the control group (p < 0.05), and correlated well with disease severity. Bacterial translocation was lower both in incidence (p < 0.05) and in the number of colony forming units (p < 0.05) for the Gln groups, than in the control group. With respect to all indices studied, the 4% Gln group performed better than did the 2% Gln group. CONCLUSION: Prophylactic glutamine supplementation modulates the inflammatory activities of IL-8 and TNF-alpha in TNBS induced colitis.},

OBJECTIVES: The aim of the study was to investigate the blood levels of A, C and E vitamins, Beta-carotene, zinc, and selenium in 249 patients with precanceroses (atrophic gastritis, hyperplastic polyp of the stomach, adenomas of the stomach and colorectum, ulcerative colitis), 96 patients with carcinoma of the stomach or colorectum, and to compare them with a control group of 130 people. RESULTS: We have discovered the frequency of decreased average levels of micronutrients in patients with precanceroses as follows: vitamin C > vitamins E and A > selenium > beta carotene. In all groups of patients with carcinoma the average levels of vitamins and Beta-carotene were significantly decreased, the level of selenium has decreased only in the group of gastric carcinoma. The copper level was increased in the group of ulcerative colitis and in all groups with carcinoma. CONCLUSION: The results indicate that in the primary prevention of these malign diseases it is necessary to improve the levels of the presented micronutrients in the population of the Slovak Republic by increasing the intake of fruit, vegetables and other sources of nutrition, the secondary prevention in persons with precanceroses requires an appropriate intermittent supplementation of micronutrients (chemoprevention).

We investigated the activities of antioxidant enzymes-superoxide dismutase, catalase and glutathion peroxidase-in colonic mucosa biopsy specimens obtained at different phases of the disease in patients given vitamin E therapy or not and in controls. PATIENTS AND METHODS: Biopsy specimens were obtained from 29 patients with ulcerative colitis and from 18 healthy controls. Ten patients on maintenance drug therapy were also given a 300 mg daily oral dose of vitamin E. RESULTS: Enzyme activities were significantly increased in inflamed non-polypous colonic mucosa in patients with active ulcerative colitis, while they were similar to activities observed in controls during quiescent phases of the disease. Antioxidant enzyme activities in specimens from inflammatory polyps remained high even in patients in clinical remission. Administration of vitamin E resulted in a significant reduction of glutathion peroxidase activity in the colonic mucosa. CONCLUSION: These findings indirectly confirm that important quantities of reactive oxygen species are formed in ulcerative colitis. Further studies are needed to elucidate the relationship of these changes with the pathogenesis of ulcerative colitis.},

A nested case-control study was performed to evaluate the association between family history of colon cancer and spontaneously occurring colon cancer in cotton-top tamarins (Saguinus oedipus). METHODS: Subjects were chosen from a colony of cotton-top tamarins held in captivity between 1968 and 1995. The cancer status of parents and grandparents was compared for 48 animals with colon cancer and 58 controls, all with histological confirmation of ulcerative colitis. Multivariate odds ratios were calculated using logistic regression. RESULTS: A parental history of colon cancer was positively associated with risk of colon cancer (multivariate odds ratio, 2.7; 95% confidence interval, 1.1-6.3). Risk also increased as an animal's total number of family members with colon cancer increased (multivariate odds ratio, 1.7 for each increase in the total number of family members with cancer; 95% confidence interval, 1.1-2.8). CONCLUSIONS: The results suggest that cotton-top tamarins with ulcerative colitis are at significant increased risk for developing colon cancer if they have a family history of colon cancer. Further investigation of this relationship in both tamarins and humans is warranted.},

   abstract = {BACKGROUND: Osteoporosis has been reported in adult patients with inflammatory bowel disease. AIMS: To evaluate bone mineral density (BMD), nutritional status, and determinants of BMD in children with inflammatory bowel disease. PATIENTS: Fifty five patients (34 boys and 21 girls, age range 4-18) were studied; 22 had Crohn's disease and 33 ulcerative colitis. METHODS: Lumbar spine and total body BMD, and body composition were assessed by dual energy x ray absorptiometry (DXA). Results were expressed as standard deviation scores (SDS). Lean body mass was also assessed by bioelectrical impedance analysis (BIA). Yearly measurements during two years were performed in 21 patients. RESULTS: The mean SDS of lumbar spine BMD and total body BMD were significantly lower than normal (-0.75 and -0.95, both p < 0.001). Height SDS and body mass index SDS were also decreased. The decrease in BMD SDS could not be explained by delay in bone maturation. The cumulative dose of prednisolone correlated negatively with lumbar spine BMD SDS (r = -0.32, p < 0.02). Body mass index SDS correlated positively with total body BMD SDS (r = 0.36, p < 0.02). Patients with Crohn's disease had significantly lower lumbar spine and total body BMD SDS than patients with ulcerative colitis, even after adjustment for cumulative dose of prednisolone. In the longitudinal data cumulative dose of prednisolone between the measurements correlated negatively with the change in lumbar spine and total body BMD SDS. Lean tissue mass measured by DXA had a strong correlation with lean body mass measured by BIA (r = 0.98). CONCLUSIONS: Children with inflammatory bowel disease have a decreased BMD. Children with Crohn's disease have a higher risk of developing osteopaenia than children with ulcerative colitis. Corticosteroid therapy and nutritional status are important determinants of BMD in these patients.},

   abstract = {BACKGROUND: Hypovitaminosis and fat-soluble vitamin deficiency have been reported in adults with inflammatory bowel disease (IBD). A prospective study was undertaken to determine the prevalence of low serum levels of vitamins A and E in children and young adults with IBD. METHODS: Clinical information and serum for vitamin levels was gathered prospectively from 61 patients with Crohn's disease, 36 patients with ulcerative colitis, and 23 control subjects. Disease activity and disease location were determined for IBD patients. Serum retinol and alpha-tocopherol levels were determined by high-performance liquid chromatography. RESULTS: The prevalence of hypovitaminosis A (defined as serum vitamin A < 20 micrograms/dl) or hypovitaminosis E (defined as serum vitamin E < 5 mg/l) was 16% in the pediatric IBD population studied. Low vitamin A levels were more common than low vitamin E levels. Serum retinol levels correlated significantly with alpha-tocopherol levels. Hypovitaminosis was significantly more prevalent in the Crohn's disease patients who had active disease, an erythrocyte sedimentation rate of more than 25 mm/hour, or a serum albumin level less than 3 mg/dl. CONCLUSIONS: Children and young adults with active IBD frequently have low serum levels of vitamin A or vitamin E. The severity of disease activity is a better predictor of risk for hypovitaminosis than is nutritional status. Further work is necessary to determine whether the hypovitaminosis seen in children with IBD reflects true deficiency.},

   abstract = {Basic fibroblast growth factor is a heparin-binding protein known to stimulate angiogenesis and promote wound healing in tissues. Since Crohn's disease is characterized in part by submucosal vascular proliferation, we sought to determine whether serum basic fibroblast growth factor is elevated in children with Crohn's disease and whether serum levels reflect disease activity. Sera were obtained from 64 children with Crohn's disease, 44 children with ulcerative colitis, 20 children with functional abdominal pain, and 29 from children with documented inflammatory disease evaluated in our gastroenterology program. Disease activity indices and clinical data were gathered prospectively for the inflammatory bowel disease patients. Serum basic fibroblast growth factor levels were measured by enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay. Although the mean basic fibroblast growth factor level did not significantly differ between children with Crohn's disease and other conditions, there was a strong (r = 0.53, P < 0.001) correlation between basic fibroblast growth factor level and disease activity. The relationship of basic fibroblast growth factor with disease activity persisted even after adjusting for other covariates (including age, sex, hematocrit, albumin, and sedimentation rate) in a multivariate linear regression model. There was also a statistically significant, although less strong correlation (r = 0.33, P = 0.03) between basic fibroblast growth factor level and disease activity in ulcerative colitis. While basic fibroblast growth factor is not a specific marker for Crohn's disease, serum levels reflect disease activity. Therefore, basic fibroblast growth factor release may be important in mediating the angiogenesis and wound healing seen in Crohn's disease.},

   abstract = {Children and adolescents with inflammatory bowel disease (IBD) present unique challenges to physicians and all health-care providers. The most important aspect is that children are not small adults. They are characterized by a highly dynamic state of growth and physical change as well as a constant alteration in psychological status. It will not be difficult to recognize IBD, even in children, when it presents with classical symptoms such as bloody diarrhoea, abdominal pain and weight loss. However, some children will present with abdominal pain and depression. Not infrequently these children are diagnosed as being depressed and are seen and treated by psychologists and psychiatrists for different periods of time. In addition, several children will be initially diagnosed as having a bacterial gastroenteritis with a proven positive faecal culture. It seems to be the triggering event in these children, and if adequate therapy fails, colonoscopy is indicated. Recently, Beattie et al. showed that in children seen for chronic abdominal pain simple routine blood tests including full blood count and erythrocyte sedimentation rate are almost always abnormal in children with IBD. But most importantly, growth retardation is common in children with IBD and is more often found in Crohn's disease (CD) than in ulcerative colitis (UC). Faltering growth is a sign of a catabolic situation. Therefore, it is essential to follow the growth of children at the beginning and during treatment of IBD. Growth retardation can be the first symptom of IBD and is often already present before other symptoms of IBD become apparent. Rarely, extra-intestinal manifestations, particularly arthritis, can be the first and sometimes only initial symptom for months to years in children with IBD. About 2% of all patients with IBD present before the age of 10 years, but 30% present between the age of 10 and 19 years. A significant proportion of young patients with IBD will develop the disease just prior to or during puberty. Adolescent growth is characterized by rapid accumulation of lean body mass and any inflammatory disease occurring at this time is likely to have a major impact on nutritional status and growth. This rapid growth requires an appropriate increase in nutritional substrates and failure to achieve catch-up growth may ultimately lead to poor cumulative growth over time. Most of the growth retardation is seen in children with CD, approximately 30%. However, also in UC 15% will show a reduction in growth. The higher percentage in CD could be due to the disease itself or to the relative subtlety of the intestinal manifestations of CD, mainly abdominal pain and general malaise. Not only growth, but also delayed puberty, is a sign of an ongoing disease that most likely needs more intensive treatment. It has been shown that the severity of disease activity plays a more important role in the occurrence of growth retardation than steroid treatment. Therefore in paediatrics it is important to state that growth retardation during medical treatment equals undertreatment. In contrast to adults, the potential benefit of nutritional therapy should be seriously considered in addition to aggressive medical therapy including steroids and other immunosuppressive agents such as azathioprine. The most convincing evidence that malnutrition is primarily responsible for growth failure is based on depletion studies. The malnutrition itself is caused by ongoing inflammation and loss of appetite. Recommendations for nutritional therapy include an increase in energy and protein intake to 150% of recommended daily allowances for height and age. Some studies have shown the benefit of nocturnal nasogastric infusion as supplements of daily intake. Importantly, nutritional support has been shown to be as effective as steroids in achieving remission of disease in children. Furthermore, no significant differences have been shown in studies using elemental versus polymeric diets.},

   abstract = {The role of diet in the aetiology and pathogenesis of ulcerative colitis (UC) remains uncertain. Impaired utilization by colonocytes of butyrate, a product of bacterial fermentation of dietary carbohydrates escaping digestion, may be important. Sulphur-fermenting bacteria may be involved in this impaired utilization. Oxidative stress probably mediates tissue injury but is probably not of causative importance. Patients with UC are prone to malnutrition and its detrimental effects. However, there is no role for total parenteral nutrition and bowel rest as primary therapy for UC. The maintenance of adequate nutrition is very important, particularly in the peri-operative patient. In the absence of massive bleeding, perforation, toxic megacolon or obstruction, enteral rather than parenteral nutrition should be the mode of choice. Nutrients may be beneficial as adjuvant therapy. Butyrate enemas have improved patients with otherwise recalcitrant distal colitis in small studies. Non-cellulose fibre supplements are of benefit in rats with experimental colitis. Eicosapentaenoic acid in fish oil has a steroid-sparing effect which, although modest, is important, particularly in terms of reducing the risk of osteoporosis, but it seems to have no role in the patient with inactive disease. gamma-Linolenic acid and anti-oxidants also are showing promise. Nutrients may also modify the increased risk of colorectal carcinoma. Oxidative stress can damage tissue DNA but there are no data published at present on possible protection from oral anti-oxidants. Butyrate protects against experimental carcinogenesis in rats with experimental colitis. Folate supplementation is weakly associated with decreased incidence of cancer in UC patients when assessed retrospectively. Vigilance should be maintained for increased micronutrient requirements and supplements given as appropriate. Calcium and low-dose vitamin D should be given to patients on long-term steroids and folate to those on sulphasalazine.},

Formulas contained comparable levels of protein, fat and non-structural carbohydrates. Daily intake of the formulas provided nutrients to meet or exceed the recommended daily allowance. Intake was recorded daily while blood and urine samples were collected weekly on days 0, 7 and 14. Certain subjects consuming large quantities of the UCNF experienced some abdominal distention, gas and loose stools. Sole source intake of the UCNF was safe over 14 days as assessed by routine measurements of serum metabolite profiles, haematology and urinalysis compared with subjects fed the control formula. Substantial decreases in plasma and red blood cell phospholipid 18:2n-6 and increases in 20:5n-3 and 22:6n-3 within 1 wk of feeding the UCNF were noted.},

The purpose of this study was to assess the effects of an ulcerative colitis nutritional formula (UCNF) containing oligosaccharides, fish oil, gum arabic and antioxidants on plasma and colonic phospholipid fatty acid and prostaglandin profiles in pigs. Twenty-four growing barrows in two replications were equally randomized among four killing times (d 0, 7, 14 and 21), and one of two diets, a control and the UCNF. Diets contained comparable levels of protein, fat, and nonstructural carbohydrate and met 100% of the energy requirements of the pig. Intake and body weight were recorded daily while blood, urine and tissue samples were collected at time of kill. Within 1 wk of ingestion of the UCNF, the composition of plasma phospholipid fatty acids showed an increase in 20:5(n-3) and 22:6(n-3) (P < 0.0001) and a decrease in 20:4(n-6) and 18:2(n-6) (P < 0.0001). Similar effects were observed for the phospholipids in the colonic and cecal mucosa. Plasma prostaglandin E was unaffected by treatment, whereas thromboxane B2 and 6-keto-prostaglandin F1 alpha levels were significantly decreased after 7 d of UCNF ingestion. Ingestion of the UCNF resulted in a suppression in the synthesis of proinflammatory prostaglandins by cecal and colonic mucosal cells. Levels of colonic and cecal prostaglandin E, 6-keto-prostaglandin F1 alpha and thromboxane B2 were significantly decreased after 7 d of UCNF ingestion. These changes may have been mediated by rapid increases of (n-3) fatty acids into cellular phospholipids. Dietary supplementation with the UCNF may prove beneficial for patients with ulcerative colitis by modulating colonic prostaglandin synthesis.},

DESIGN: A cross-sectional study. SETTING: The Department of Internal Medicine, Catholic University Hospital, Rome, Italy. SUBJECTS: Thirty-four patients with biopsy-proven inflammatory bowel disease (18 CD; 16 UC) in clinical remission (SCDAI < 3 and Powell-Tuck index < 4) not receiving steroid therapy. INTERVENTIONS: All patients had a clinical examination. MAIN OUTCOME MEASURES: Blood indicators of inflammation and nutritional status. Body composition was assessed by both anthropometry and bioimpedance and metabolic variables were measured by indirect calorimetry over a 60-90 min period. RESULTS: CD had a lower body weight than both controls (58.1 kg, range 41.5-71.0 vs. 66.4 kg, range 57.0-76.0; P < 0.001) and UC) 58.1 kg, range 41.5-71.0 vs. 69.6 kg, range 50.5-94.0; (P < 0.001). Fat-free mass (FFM) did not differ between the groups, whilst fat mass was significantly lower in CD than in UC (P < 0.05) and controls (P < 0.001). Normalizing the basal metabolic rate by FFM, a higher value was found in CD compared with UC (143 kJ kg-1) d-(-1), range 97.5-179 vs. 133 kJ kg-1 d-1, range 123-148; P < 0.05) and control subject 143 kj kg-1 d-1, range 97.5-179 vs. 134 kj kg-1 d-1, range 122-162; P < 0.05). The nonprotein respiratory quotient was significantly lower in CD compared to UC 0.80, range 0.73-0.84 vs. 0.84, range 0.79-0.91; P < 0.01) and controls (0.80, range 0.73-0.84 vs. 0.83, range 0.81-0.87; P < 0.001), with a consequently higher lipid oxidation rate in CD. CONCLUSIONS: CD subjects showed a decreased fat mass and enhanced utilization of lipids compared with UC and controls. These data could be explained by the larger intestinal involvement and considered as a contribution to lipid tissue wasting in CD.},

At admission 8 patients had a high-grade illness, 10 patients had a middle-grade illness, 5 patients had a toxic megacolon. All the patients were treated with systemic medical management (mesalazine + methylprednisolone) and topical medical management with rectal steroid (methylprednisolone) and rectal mesalazine by enema, and with nutritional support (Total Parenteral Nutrition). The 5 patients with toxic megacolon, after 48 hours of unsuccessful medical management, underwent surgery with deferred urgency; the other 18 patients underwent surgery after one-four months. The authors prefer the ileorectal anastomosis (IRA), since the rectal lesions are more susceptible to topical therapy. A single-stage IRA was performed in 17 patients. A sigmoid resection has been employed in the first stage in the 18th patient with a local development of the disease in the sigma; a following relapse of the lesions required a total colectomy with a low ileorectal anastomosis. A first-stage subtotal colectomy with ileostomy and Hartmann closure of the rectum with low ileorectal anastomosis at a later date was performed in the 5 patients with toxic megacolon. One of these, 18 years old, died after a heart failure. After surgery, as soon as the patients start moving their bowels all of these had again a systemic therapy with mesalazine for a short period and after they had a topical therapy with mesalazine + methylprednisolone by enema, for a long period. The average postoperative period of admission was 16.3 days. The functional results have been encouraging with an average of 1.6 bowel movements daily and an average of 0.4 nocturnal bowel movements. All the patients had a normal anal sphincter function with an acceptable stool frequency. In male patients there no urinary or sexual defects. In one case of these, there was a low grade of dysplasia, revealed by endoscopic biopsy. The authors conclude that today surgical treatment of ulcerative colitis is not well established.},

The degree of mucosal adaptation that may occur in response to changes in nutrient supply and faecal stasis after the formation of an ileoanal pouch is poorly understood. METHOD: The ability of ileal mucosal biopsies, from nine patients with ulcerative colitis and from 18 with an ileoanal pouch, to oxidize [14C]-glucose, glutamine and butyrate to carbon dioxide was quantified. RESULTS: Glucose, glutamine and butyrate were oxidized respectively at a median of 12.5 (95 per cent confidence interval (4-22), 77 (34-207) and 194 (81-321) pmol microgram-1 h-1 by ileal mucosa and 12.9 (6-21), 35 (11-57) and 194 (73-737) pmol microgram-1 h-1 by pouch mucosa. CONCLUSION: Ileoanal pouch construction and subsequent bacterial colonization and faecal stasis resulted in a significant (P < 0.05) reduction in the mucosal ability to oxidize glutamine whereas there was no difference in the rate of butyrate oxidation.},

   abstract = {The prevalence of osteopenia in children with inflammatory bowel disease (IBD) is unknown. The effect of nutritional state, disease activity, and steroid therapy on bone mineral content (BMC) of whole body, lumbar spine, and left femoral neck measured by dual energy x ray absorptiometry in 32 children with IBD was assessed by comparison with 58 healthy local school children. Using the control data, a predicted BMC was calculated taking into account bone area, age, height, weight, and pubertal stage. The measured BMC in children with IBD was expressed as a percentage of this predicted value (% BMC). Mean (SD) % BMC was significantly reduced for the whole body and left femoral neck in the children with IBD (97.0 (4.5)% and 93.1 (12.0)% respectively, p < 0.05). Of the children with IBD, 41% had a % BMC less than 1 SD below the mean for the whole body and 47% at the femoral neck. Reduction in % BMC was associated with steroid usage but not with the magnitude of steroid dose, disease activity, or biochemical markers of bone metabolism. In conclusion, osteopenia is relatively common in childhood IBD and may be partly related to the previous use of steroids.},

   abstract = {BACKGROUND: Pediatric patients presenting with colitis, suggestive of inflammatory bowel disease, undergo evaluation with either flexible sigmoidoscopy or colonoscopy. Our objectives were to assess current practice behavior in the evaluation of pediatric patients with colitis and to determine whether flexible sigmoidoscopy or colonoscopy was more cost-effective as the initial evaluation. METHODS: Practice behavior and procedure charges were assessed using a nationwide survey, and costs for diagnostic strategies were compared using a decision analysis program. RESULTS: The vast majority of survey respondents would proceed with colonoscopy if colitis suggestive of Crohn's disease was noted in the rectosigmoid area (81%) or if ulcerative colitis extended proximal to the rectosigmoid area (70%). If colonoscopy would follow if flexible sigmoidoscopy suggested either ulcerative colitis or Crohn's disease (67%), then colonoscopy would result in a savings of 23%. If the evaluation was predetermined to be limited to flexible sigmoidoscopy (16%), then flexible sigmoidoscopy was the cost-effective strategy with savings of 29%. If colonoscopy would follow flexible sigmoidoscopy for Crohn's colitis only (13%), there was no clear cost advantage. CONCLUSIONS: The most cost-effective strategy depends on the physician's need to know the disease location. Our survey results indicate that most physicians chose to establish the extent of disease in both ulcerative colitis and in Crohn's disease; thus initial colonoscopy would be the more cost-effective strategy. When knowledge of disease distribution is not essential for patient care, flexible sigmoidoscopy can lead to substantial cost savings.},

   abstract = {BACKGROUND: To review the outcome after restorative proctocolectomy among children and adolescents with ulcerative colitis at a pediatric inflammatory bowel disease center. METHODS: The records of all patients with ulcerative colitis undergoing colectomy and ileoanal anastomosis at The Hospital for Sick Children, Toronto, Canada, were reviewed. Questionnaires concerning functional results were sent to patients with restored transanal defecation. RESULTS: Seventy three patients (mean age, 13.2 years; range, 2.6-18.8 years) underwent ileoanal anastomosis (19 straight ileoanal anastomosis, 41 J pouch, 13 S pouch) between January 1980 and June 1995 and were observed 5.8+/-3.3 years. The ileoanal anastomosis is nonfunctional in 19 (26%) patients. Excision rates according to type of restorative procedure were J pouch, 7% (3 of 41); S pouch, 32% (4 of 13); and straight ileoanal anastomosis, 32% (6 of 19). Failure was usually attributable to intractable diarrhea among patients with straight ileoanal anastomosis but was caused by anastomotic leak or pelvic-perianal sepsis among patients with pouch procedures. Failure rates did not vary with age at ileoanal anastomosis. Among patients retaining ileoanal continuity, continence problems reported in the questionnaire were frequent and tended to be more extreme among younger patients. Overall, 90% of respondents reported satisfaction with the functional outcome of the restorative operation. CONCLUSIONS: The success rate of the ileoanal anastomosis/J-pouch procedure is comparable to that in adult series. The ileoanal anastomosis/J-pouch procedure is the operation of choice for children and adolescents who want ileoanal continuity restored after colectomy for ulcerative colitis.},

DESIGN: Double-blind cross-over study. SETTING: Metabolic kitchen with policlinic visits, Sahlgrenska Hospital, Goteborg, Sweden. SUBJECTS: Patients with conventional ileostomy because of ulcerative colitis. INTERVENTIONS: 7 g of inulin, 17 g of oligofructose and 7 g of sucrose were added to a controlled diet during three experimental periods of three days each. Ileostomy effluents were collected and analysed. Differences between experimental and control diet were investigated with the Wilcoxon's sign and values test. RESULTS: Inulin and oligofructose were recovered in the ileostomy effluent to 88% (95% CI, 76-100%) and 89% (64-114%) respectively. Dry solid excretion increased by 14.4 g (11.3-17.5) on inulin, and by 14.7 g (13.0-16.4 g) on oligofructose and energy excretion increased 245 kJ (190-307 kJ) on inulin and 230 kJ (214-315 kJ) on oligofructose compared to control diet (P < 0.05). Cholesterol absorption, excretion of cholesterol, bile acids, nitrogen, fat, calcium, magnesium, zinc and iron were not affected by inulin and oligofructose. CONCLUSIONS: Inulin and oligofructose are not digested in the small intestine. They do not affect mineral excretion and hence hardly mineral absorption. They do not increase fat or nitrogen excretion from the small intestine. Any physiological effect of inulin and oligofructose is probably mediated through other mechanisms than altered excretion from the small intestine.},

   abstract = {The incidence of ulcerative colitis in school-age children in most parts of Europe has been steady at 1.5-2.0 per 100,000 children per year for the last 20-30 years. In comparison to adults, abdominal pain is a relatively frequent presenting symptom in children in addition to rectal bleeding, bloody diarrhoea or diarrhoea. Distribution of disease in children is generally more extensive (ratio rectal:left sided:extensive 25:30:45). There are remarkably few clinical trials of therapy in children and reasons for this are discussed. Subjective indices of disease severity and activity are unreliable in children. Objective measures such as endoscopy are of value to define the extent of ulceration and histopathological features; a test of gut protein loss using whole gut lavage gives an objective index of disease activity. Principles of medical management in children are generally the same as in adults with the additional need for scrupulous attention to nutrition and growth, and psychological factors. Reassuring results of a review of the health status of young adults who had developed ulcerative colitis in childhood are presented. Twenty-four of 27 considered themselves fully fit although nine of the patients had a permanent ileostomy.},

We aimed to assess the mucosal fatty acid pattern in patients with ulcerative colitis and Crohn's disease, and in rats with trinitrobenzene-sulfonic acid (TNB) induced colitis. METHODS: Fatty acids were measured in colonic mucosa of patients with ulcerative colitis (n = 30), Crohn's disease (n = 21), and healthy controls (n = 13). Likewise, they were assessed in the colonic mucosa of rats with TNB- and sham-colitis. RESULTS: There was an increase of the end-products (C22:5n3, C22:6n3, C20:4n6, C22:5n6) and a decrease of the precursors (C18:3n3, C18:2n6) of both n3 and n6 polyunsaturated fatty acids in the mucosa of active ulcerative colitis and TNB-colitis. Also, high values of saturated (C16:0, C18:0) and low values of monounsaturated fatty acids (C18:1n9) were observed. Furthermore, the mucosa of active Crohn's disease showed substantial changes in saturated, monounsaturated and essential fatty acids, but not in polyunsaturated fatty acids. Mucosa of patients with inactive disease showed intermediate fatty acid values between the mucosa of active patients and healthy controls. CONCLUSIONS: Colonic inflammation causes a characteristic modification of the mucosal fatty acid profile which appears to be common to different aetiologies and seems to be related to the degree of inflammation.},

METHODS: We examined the intestinal absorption of ursodeoxycholic acid by the oral ursodeoxycholic acid tolerance test in 19 children and adolescents with inflammatory bowel disease at various stages, including 8 patients with unoperated Crohn's disease, 3 patients with ileal-resected Crohn's disease, 8 with ulcerative colitis, and 8 healthy control subjects. RESULTS: Ursodeoxycholic acid malabsorption was present in all patients with unoperated Crohn's disease in the first diagnosed active stage, in 3 of 5 patients in a relapsing active stage, and in 2 of 8 patients in remission. Ursodeoxycholic acid absorption was significantly lower in patients in the first diagnosed active stage than in the healthy controls (p < 0.01) or in patients in remission (p < 0.01). There was no significant difference between healthy controls and the patients in a relapsing active stage or in remission. Ursodeoxycholic acid absorption was abnormal during the first postoperative month in patients with ileal-resected Crohn's disease, but normalized over time. Malabsorption of ursodeoxycholic acid was not observed in any patients with ulcerative colitis. CONCLUSIONS: These findings suggest that absorption of ursodeoxycholic acid in the proximal intestine is impaired in patients with Crohn's disease and that the oral ursodeoxycholic acid tolerance test is a convenient and useful means of evaluating the absorption of bile acid in the proximal intestine in pediatric patients with ileal or ileocolic Crohn's disease.},

   abstract = {BACKGROUND & AIMS: Children with inflammatory bowel disease (IBD) are at risk for osteoporosis because of undernutrition, delayed puberty, and prolonged corticosteroid use. The aim of this study was to compare bone mineral density (BMD) in children with IBD with that in normal children and to assess the effects of nutritional and hormonal factors and corticosteroid dosages on BMD. METHODS: One hundred sixty-two subjects (99 with IBD and 63 healthy sibling controls) were enrolled. Patients underwent anthropometric assessment, pubertal staging, bone age radiography, and BMD assessment by dual energy x-ray absorptiometry of the lumbar spine, femoral neck, and radius. Laboratory evaluations included serum calcium, phosphate, alkaline phosphatase, 25-hydroxyvitamin D, 1,25-dihydroxyvitamin D, parathyroid hormone, osteocalcin, urinary N-telopeptides, albumin, insulin-like growth factor I, and testosterone or estradiol. Cumulative corticosteroid doses were calculated. RESULTS: BMD Z scores at the lumbar spine and femoral neck were lower in patients with IBD, and lower in those with Crohn's disease compared with those with ulcerative colitis. Low BMD persisted after correction for bone age in girls with Crohn's disease (lumbar spine, P = 0.004; femoral neck, P = 0.002). Cumulative corticosteroid dose was a significant predictor of reduced BMD. BMD did not correlate with measures of calcium homeostasis, except elevated serum phosphate and urine calcium levels in girls. CONCLUSIONS: Low BMD occurs in children with IBD (more in Crohn's disease than in ulcerative colitis), especially pubertal and postpubertal girls. Cumulative corticosteroid dose is a predictor of low BMD, but other factors in Crohn's disease remain undetermined.},

   abstract = {PURPOSE: To determine the dietary practices of the pediatric inflammatory bowel disease population at the Children's Hospital of the Hamilton Health Sciences Corporation and the reported effectiveness of those diets. PATIENTS AND METHODS: A questionnaire mailed to 153 pediatric patients was returned by 125 patients (76 Crohn's disease [CD] and 49 ulcerative colitis [UC] patients)--an 82% response rate. RESULTS: The median age of respondents was 13 years, and 62% were male. Ninety per cent and 71% of CD and UC patients, respectively, had changed their diets since diagnosis. Caloric supplements (eg, BOOST [Mead Johnson Nutritionals]), sole source nutrition, low fibre and lactose-free diets were used by more than 15% of CD patients, whereas lactose-free, nonspicy, low acid, additive-free, caloric supplement and low fibre diets were used by more than 15% of UC patients. A diet supplement was more commonly used in CD patients (P < 0.05) and an additive-free diet in UC patients. Corn and corn products, nuts, milk and bran were avoided by more than 20% of CD and UC patients; however, more CD than UC patients avoided corn and corn products. In addition, UC patients (more than 20%) also avoided tomato, other dairy (nonfluid milk-based products and foods containing milk products), chocolate, cheese, wheat, tomato sauces and fruit juice. A benefit was reported for 103 of 141 reported diets, with the most commonly alleviated symptoms being abdominal pain, diarrhea and flatulence. CONCLUSION: Many children with inflammatory bowel disease have altered their diets to manage their disease and have attributed symptomatic relief to these diets.},

   abstract = {Many nutritional issues are important in the care of children and adolescents with inflammatory bowel disease. No specific dietary toxin or antigen has been identified to have an etiologic role in either ulcerative colitis or Crohn's disease. A possible modulating effect of omega-3 polyunsaturated fatty acids on intestinal inflammation is being investigated. Most prevalent among the nutritional consequences of inflammatory bowel disease is weight loss, for which inadequate caloric intake is primarily responsible. Impairment of linear growth and associated delay in pubertal development commonly complicate childhood Crohn's disease. The two major etiologic factors are chronic undernutrition and direct effects of inflammatory mediators secreted from the inflamed gut. Recent studies have incriminated interleukin-6. Treatment of intestinal inflammation and provision of adequate nutrition are of paramount importance in preventing or remedying growth impairment. Exclusive enteral nutrition using formulated food is efficacious primary therapy of active Crohn's disease, although the mode of action is poorly understood.},

To determine whether antioxidant defenses might be altered, we evaluated plasma antioxidant concentrations in 24 children with inflammatory bowel disease (12 with Crohn disease and 12 with ulcerative colitis) and in 23 healthy control subjects. Anthropometric measurements and disease activity scores were obtained. The groups were of similar age and sex distribution; most children had quiescent or mild disease. The children with Crohn disease were malnourished compared with the ulcerative colitis and control groups. Children with inflammatory bowel disease had decreased plasma ascorbic acid and increased glutathione peroxidase, glutathione, and alpha-tocopherol (vitamin E) concentrations compared with control subjects. These differences were found primarily in the children with Crohn disease. This study provides evidence that children with Crohn disease have alterations in circulating antioxidant defenses, possibly related to an ongoing oxidant stress.},

   abstract = {BACKGROUND: Pediatric inflammatory bowel disease is often associated with growth failure and inadequate energy intake. Although several circulating cytokines are known to be elevated in inflammatory bowel disease, the mechanism for the related anorexia has not been described. Leptin is a newly recognized circulating protein that is an important regulator of appetite and energy metabolism; leptin levels are elevated in several animal models of inflammation. This study was conducted to determine whether serum leptin levels are elevated in young patients with inflammatory bowel disease. METHODS: One hundred twelve children and young adults with Crohn's disease or ulcerative colitis were studied prospectively. Forty-two patients with other gastrointestinal illnesses were used as control subjects. Height, weight, erythrocyte sedimentation rate, serum albumin concentration, and clinical information were collected prospectively, and leptin was measured by radioimmunoassay of stored serum. RESULTS: No significant differences in leptin levels were found among disease groups or control subjects. Body mass index and gender were the only independent predictors of serum leptin in all groups examined. Disease activity varied inversely with serum leptin in patients with Crohn's disease, but these differences were explained entirely by variations in body mass index. CONCLUSIONS: The determinants of serum leptin were the same in young patients with inflammatory bowel disease as in normal populations, indicating that alterations in leptin levels are unlikely to mediate the anorexia and growth failure associated with this disease.},

   abstract = {During the past 20 years there has been growing interest in the importance of nutritional factors in the pathogenesis of inflammatory bowel disease. There are so far no definite links between ulcerative colitis and diet, but links with Crohn's disease have been studied by both epidemiologists and clinicians. Epidemiological studies, although retrospective, have suggested that patients with Crohn's disease eat more sugar and sweets that control individuals; however, when dietary sugar is restricted, there is little clinical benefit. The clinical approach to nutrition in Crohn's disease has been by the use of elemental diets, which will produce symptomatic and objective remission in up to 90% of compliant patients. Those who return to normal eating soon relapse but, in some studies, have enjoyed prolonged remission on exclusion diets. The foods excluded have been not sugar, but predominantly cereals, dairy products and yeast. Attention has now switched to the possible harmful role of fat in Crohn's disease. The efficacy of elemental feeds appears to depend not on the presentation of nitrogen but on the amount of long chain triglyceride present. Increases in recent years in the frequency of Crohn's disease in Japan have been correlated with increased dietary fat intake, and a recent study suggested that W-3 fatty acids, which are metabolized by immunomodulatory leukotrienes and prostaglandins, may have a beneficial role to play. The links between nutrition and Crohn's disease have now become strong and the role of fat may be the most exciting of all.},

This article reviews much of the research that has evaluated the role of diet in the causation, primary treatment, and adjunctive therapy of both ulcerative colitis (UC) and Crohn's disease (CD). Benefits have been demonstrated in the use of elemental diets or polymeric diets in CD in both acute flare up or maintenance of IBD. A careful team approach can overcome problems in implementing nutritional therapy. Nutrition also has a critical benefit in postoperative CD and perioperative UC. Numerous easily corrected, nutritional abnormalities are often overlooked in patients with IBD, which may have significant consequences. Nutritional therapy may have a central place in the hierarchy of treatment in IBD and further research is critical in this area to better define the benefits of nutrition in IBD.},

   abstract = {BACKGROUND: Although the course of ulcerative proctitis in adults has been well described, little data are available concerning its clinical behavior in children and adolescents. This study sought to characterize the presentation, response to therapy, and long-term course of ulcerative proctitis in the pediatric population. METHODS: A retrospective chart review was conducted at five pediatric gastroenterology centers. RESULTS: A total of 38 subjects (mean age 11.6 years) were identified with ulcerative proctitis (mean follow-up 4.3 years). Symptoms were mild at diagnosis in 74% and moderate or severe in 26%. Thirty-two percent had a complaint of constipation at presentation. Cessation of symptoms was noted in 68% within 3 months of therapy, an additional 24% within 6 months, and 8% were still symptomatic despite 6 months of therapy. During any subsequent yearly follow-up interval, -55% of patients were asymptomatic, 40% had a chronic intermittent course, and < 5% were continuously symptomatic despite therapy. Eight subjects were treated with oral corticosteroids, one with 6-mercaptopurine, and one with cyclosporine. Extension of inflammation proximal to the rectosigmoid occurred in 11 of 38 subjects (29%), 0.5-11.3 years postdiagnosis. Seven of the 13 subjects (54%) followed for > or = 5 years had proximal extension of disease, and two had undergone colectomy. CONCLUSIONS: Despite a mild presentation in most subjects, ulcerative proctitis seems to have a high risk of proximal extension of disease. The overall response to therapy seems to be similar to that reported for ulcerative colitis in children. Follow-up endoscopic evaluation of patients with ulcerative proctitis seems warranted, especially in the setting of recurrent or recalcitrant symptoms.},

   abstract = {BACKGROUND: In patients with inflammatory bowel disease (IBD), accelerated bone loss and osteopenia have been found. Potential etiologies of these bone abnormalities have included malnutrition, poor calcium intake or absorption, and the use of corticosteroids. Recent studies have suggested that circulating pro-inflammatory cytokines, which are produced in inflamed bowel, can have a profound effect on bone metabolism, particularly bone resorption. Our aim was to characterize the effects of serum from subjects with IBD on bone metabolism in an in vitro bone culture system. METHODS: Organ cultures of fetal rat parietal bones were treated with sera from 9 subjects with Crohn's disease, 7 with ulcerative colitis, and 10 controls with functional bowel disease (age range of all subjects 7-16 years). Patients were also classified by disease activity, serum albumin level, erythrocyte sedimentation rate (ESR), and serum interleukin (IL) 6 levels. The effects of sera on bone formation and resorption were quantified. RESULTS: Compared with control serum, serum from patients with Crohn's disease significantly decreased bone dry weight (p < 0.01) and calcium content (p < 0.001) during 96 h of culture, while serum from ulcerative colitis patients had no effect. While no difference in collagen synthesis was noted between any of the three experimental groups, noncollagen protein synthesis was lower in the ulcerative colitis group than in the control group or those with Crohn's disease (p < 0.05). DNA content was similar in all groups. There was no significant effect of serum from any experimental group on bone resorption. There was no demonstrable relationship between clinical disease activity, ESR, or serum IL-6 levels and measures of bone metabolism. Histologic evaluation of cultured bone showed marked differences between control subjects and Crohn's disease patients, with the latter being characterized by disorganization of mineral and osteoid and morphologically abnormal osteoblasts. CONCLUSIONS: Serum from children with IBD has a significantly different effect than control serum on an in vitro model of bone metabolism. Our data suggest that circulating factors may affect osteoblasts and bone formation, leading to bone loss. Further work will be required to further characterize the nature of these factors and develop treatment strategies to minimize their effects.},

We evaluated the effects of perioperative biosynthetic growth hormone (GH) treatment on short- and long-term changes in body composition and on nutritional intake. Patients with ulcerative colitis undergoing IAA surgery were randomly assigned to double-blind treatment with placebo (n=12) or 6 IU GH twice daily (n=12) from 2 d before to 7 d after the operation. Examinations were from 2 d before to 9 d after the operation and on days 30 and 90. Body composition was assessed with a dual-energy X-ray absorptiometry scanner. The 2 groups had similar nutritional intakes. On postoperative day 7, placebo-treated patients had lost 4.2 kg (95% CI: 3.0, 5.4) total tissue mass, 3.6 kg (2.1, 5.1) lean tissue mass, and 0.5 kg (-0.1, 1.2) fat mass. These reductions persisted 3 mo later. Compared with placebo, GH improved nitrogen balance, changes in lean tissue mass [gain of 4.0 kg (1.9, 6.0), P=0.001], and changes in total tissue mass [gain of 3.2 kg (1.6, 4.9), P=0.001], but increased the loss of fat mass [loss of 0.7 kg (0.0, 1.5), P=0.049] on postoperative day 7. Three months later, the placebo-treated patients had lost 2.4 kg (0.7, 4.2) more lean tissue mass than GH-treated patients (P=0.009), whereas changes in total tissue and fat mass were not significantly different. Hence, GH treatment enhanced the long-term regain of lean tissue mass.},

   abstract = {Malnutrition is a very common situation in patients inflammatory with intestinal disease (IID), which can be caused by a multitude of factors. It has been shown that nutritional support not only improves the nutritional condition of the patients, but in Crohn's disease it also has an effect on the activity of the disease, although this effect is smaller than that of steroids. Elemental diets are no more efficient than polymeric diets except under very special circumstances, but they are more expensive and patients tolerate them worse. A digestive pause is not recommended unless there is an absolute contraindication for the use of the digestive tract. Therefore, parenteral nutrition, which is more expensive and can cause serious complications, will be reserved for very specific indications. The use of fish oil supplements, either because it competes with arachidonic acid and prevents the initiation of the inflammatory cascade, or because it decreases the production of cytokines, has shown to be potentially useful in inflammatory intestinal disease, and this must be confirmed by further studies. Short chain fatty acids enemas have shown promising results in distal ulcerative colitis but the lack of homogeneity in the studies makes it necessary for these results to be consolidated in new studies. Nutritional support is especially interesting in children with inflammatory intestinal disease given that the growth retardation which is often seen in severe cases, can be controlled by adequate enteral or parenteral diets.},

   abstract = {BACKGROUND: This case report describes our preliminary data on the use of taurolidine as a lock technique. Taurolidine is a novel antimicrobial agent that has found a niche in Europe for prevention of bacteremia in home parenteral nutrition (HPN) patients who have multiple catheter-related blood-stream infections. METHODS: A 29-year-old male with short bowel syndrome was admitted 18 times in 9 years for treatment of Gram-positive, Gram-negative, and yeast-associated catheter-related bloodstream infections. Management consisted of conventional antibiotic treatment in accordance with blood culture and sensitivity results as well as catheter removal in 10 cases. Ten months before the last infection, the patient was instructed to instil 1.5 mL taurolidine 2% daily into his central line after finishing his HPN infusion and has continued to do so 2 years to date. RESULTS: The incidence of catheter-related bloodstream infections decreased from 8.5 to 1.5 infections per 1000 catheter days. CONCLUSIONS: These data support previous observations made outside North America and suggest that taurolidine may prove to be an effective and safe antimicrobial agent for the prevention of recurrent catheter-related bloodstream infections.},

   abstract = {BACKGROUND: Perinuclear antineutrophil cytoplasmic antibodies occur frequently in adult patients with chronic pouchitis after colectomy and ileal pouch-anal anastomosis for ulcerative colitis. The purpose of the study was to determine the prevalence of perinuclear antineutrophil cytoplasmic antibodies and cytoplasmic antineutrophil cytoplasmic antibody in children and adolescents who undergo colectomy and ileal pouch-anal anastomosis for ulcerative colitis and familial adenomatous polyposis. METHODS: Five groups of children and adolescents (age, <20 years) were studied, with the following histories: acute pouchitis and history of ulcerative colitis; chronic pouchitis and history of ulcerative colitis; pouchitis with Crohn's disease features and a history of ulcerative colitis; no pouchitis and a history of ulcerative colitis; and familial adenomatous polyposis, with or without pouchitis. Antineutrophil cytoplasmic antibody levels and titers were detected in postoperative sera by enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay, and positive results were subtyped by indirect immunofluorescence. RESULTS: The frequency of perinuclear antineutrophil cytoplasmic antibodies and cytoplasmic antineutrophil cytoplasmic antibody in patients with a history of ulcerative colitis were 67% and 15%, compared with a 0% presence in patients with familial adenomatous polyposis (p < 0.001). There was no significant correlation between the frequency of perinuclear antineutrophil cytoplasmic antibodies and ulcerative colitis patient subgroups (patients with and without pouchitis, 66% and 75%). Similarly, there was no significant correlation between the frequency of cytoplasmic antineutrophil cytoplasmic antibodies among ulcerative colitis patient subgroups (patients with and without pouchitis, 19% and 8%). The frequency of cytoplasmic antineutrophil cytoplasmic antibody in patients with Crohn's disease features (50%), was increased, but this difference was not significant. CONCLUSIONS: There is a high frequency of perinuclear antineutrophil cytoplasmic antibodies in children and adolescents who undergo ileal pouch-anal anastomosis for ulcerative colitis, whether or not they have pouchitis. The frequency of cytoplasmic antineutrophil cytoplasmic antibody is lower in this patient population. Additional studies will be required to determine whether the presence of cytoplasmic antineutrophil cytoplasmic antibody is associated with the postoperative development of features of Crohn's disease.},

   abstract = {An important hallmark of ulcerative colitis (UC) is mucosal neutrophil (PMN) infiltration associated with mucosal damage. This suggests that colonic chemoattractants such as bacterial products (e.g., N-formyl-methionyl-leucyl-phenylalanine (fMLP), lipopolysaccharide (LPS)) reach systemic circulation and attract PMNs to the colon. PMNs are then activated in the colonic mucosa and release their toxic oxidative metabolites. However, bacterial products are also present in the systemic circulation of healthy subjects. Thus we hypothesized that PMNs develop tolerance to colonic factors in the normal state and that this tolerance is absent in UC. We evaluated the PMN respiratory burst in response to stimulation with fMLP, LPS, or phorbol 12-myristate 13-acetate (PMA) by measuring the production of reactive oxygen species (ROS) with both luminol-enhanced chemiluminescence and a cytochrome C reduction assay. PMNs were obtained from control subjects, inactive UC patients, patients with UC who had undergone colectomies, and non-UC patients with colectomies. All three stimuli induced a significant rise in ROS. PMNs from non-UC colectomy subjects produced significantly higher ROS than PMNs from control subjects with intact colons in response to both fMLP and LPS. In contrast, PMNs from UC colectomy patients produced levels of ROS similar to those produced by PMNs from UC patients with intact colons in response to fMLP and LPS. Colectomy had no effect on PMA-induced ROS production in controls. The observed difference in fMLP-induced ROS production in control subjects with intact colons was not due to fMLP receptor down-regulation because a competition assay performed with the fMLP blocker BMLP showed a similar receptor apparent affinity in all four groups. We conclude the following: (1) the normal colonic milieu modulates the PMN respiratory burst, resulting in hyporesponsiveness of PMNs to "physiologic" but not "pharmacologic" stimulation. This effect is not due to receptor down-regulation. (2) UC colonic milieu does not appear to modulate PMN respiratory burst. This loss of PMN "tolerance" to colonic factors may have a pathogenic role in the sustained inflammation and tissue damage in UC.},

It has been proposed that ulcerative colitis, a chronic inflammatory condition of the colon, may result from a metabolic defect in SCFA oxidation in the colon and that this defect may be corrected by supraphysiologic luminal levels of SCFA in the colon. Clinical trials published to date suggest that topical SCFA provide an effective primary and/or adjunctive treatment in patients with mild to moderate distal ulcerative colitis at substantial cost savings and without significant side effects.},

The aim of this study was to analyze the safety of AZA and 6-MP and steroid reduction in this age group. METHODS: The investigators' database identified 118 patients who received either drug; 23 were excluded (single visit, noncompliance, or therapy < 1 week), leaving 95 patients, with a mean (+/-SD) age of 14.2 +/- 4.4 years. Medical files were reviewed for adverse side effects: fever, pancreatitis, infections, gastrointestinal intolerance, aminotransferase level increase, leukopenia, and thrombocytopenia. Prednisone doses before and after immunomodulatory therapy were compared. RESULTS: AZA or 6-MP was tolerated in 51 of 95 patients (54%) without adverse reaction; 27 of 95 (28%) experienced side effects that responded to dose reduction (23 patients) or spontaneously (4 patients), most commonly increased aminotransferase level (13.7%). Cessation of therapy was needed in 17 of 95 patients (18%), including recurrent fever (4), pancreatitis (4), gastrointestinal intolerance (4), and recurrent infections (3). Mean prednisone dose decreased from 24.3 to 8.6 mg/day. CONCLUSIONS: AZA and 6-MP were well tolerated in 82% of patients; of these, prednisone reduction occurred in 87%. However, 18% required discontinuation because of hypersensitivity or infectious side effects.},

   abstract = {BACKGROUNDS AND AIMS: Total parenteral nutrition (TPN) has been traditionally used as an adjunctive therapy in severe ulcerative colitis patients. We performed a prospective study to ascertain the safety, nutritional efficiency, tolerance and costs of total enteral nutrition in this situation. METHODS: After 48 hours of intensive medical treatment, severe ulcerative colitis patients initiated enteral feeding with a polymeric formula. The formula concentration and volume were increased daily. RESULTS: 17 patients (7 women, 10 men; age 36.8 +/- 12.8 years) with a mean clinical activity score of 15.6 +/- 1.5 were included. In 14 patients (82.4%) enteral nutrition was well tolerated, attaining in 11 of them more than 80% of the caloric requirements by day 4. In 3 cases we observed vomiting and bloating. Prealbumin levels improved significantly from 11.1 +/- 3.4 mg/dl to 22.7 +/- 6.8 mg/dl (p = 0.002) at the end of enteral nutrition (11.8 +/- 4.7 days). Albumin and other nutritional parameters did not change. CONCLUSIONS: Total enteral nutrition could be considered a safe and well tolerated nutritional support in these patients. Although albumin and other nutritional parameters did not change during the study period, the increase in prealbumin levels suggests a favourable anabolic effect of total enteral nutrition.},

METHODS: The prevalence of antibodies for H. pylori in serum was determined in 47 pediatric patients with inflammatory bowel disease (19 with Crohn's disease, 21 with ulcerative colitis, and 7 with unclassified disease). H. pylori antibodies of the IgG and IgA classes were measured by enzyme immunoassay in 24 patients at the time of diagnosis of inflammatory bowel disease and in 23 more patients during the follow-up of inflammatory bowel disease (mean follow-up, 3.5 years; range 1-10 years). Esophagogastroduodenoscopy was performed on 40 patients during the examination for inflammatory bowel disease. RESULTS: In contrast to earlier findings, no patient was determined to be positive for H. pylori, either in serologic or histologic examination. This negative finding was unexpected, because it is known that approximately 10% of asymptomatic Finnish children have antibodies for H. pylori in serum and approximately 10% of analyses of specimens obtained in gastric antral biopsies obtained at the Hospital for Children and Adolescents, Helsinki, Finland, are positive for H. pylori. CONCLUSIONS: Permanent colonization of the stomach with H. pylori is unusual in children with inflammatory bowel disease.},

We investigated the response of T cells in CD and other intestinal inflammatory conditions to interleukin-2 (IL-2), a cytokine essential for T-cell activation, growth, and function. STUDY DESIGN: T-cell reactivity was assessed by measuring growth induced by IL-2 in mucosal endoscopic biopsy specimens obtained from children with CD, ulcerative colitis, indeterminate colitis, and chronic nonspecific colitis and from children without gastrointestinal inflammation. RESULTS: CD mucosal T cells grew remarkably and significantly more than T cells from normal, ulcerative colitis, and chronic nonspecific colitis mucosa. T cells from indeterminate colitis mucosa grew similarly to those of CD mucosa. The enhanced growth response in CD was independent of disease location, presence or absence of intestinal inflammation, treatment, disease duration, or clinical activity. CONCLUSION: Mucosal T cells from children with CD exhibit an intrinsic hyperreactivity to IL-2. This may represent a primary pathogenic abnormality in this condition.},

   abstract = {We report the case of a previously healthy 53-year-old white male who developed an extraordinary complication of acute Campylobacter jejuni colitis. Toxic megacolon occurred while the patient was treated with a fluoroquinolone antibiotic and glucocorticoids, which were given for endoscopically suspected Crohn's colitis. During the course of the disease no cause of colitis was found other than C. jejuni. Despite the extreme dilatation, the patient was treated conservatively with parenteral nutrition and repeated decompression colonoscopies and made a full, though slow, and uneventful recovery. Follow-up colonoscopies for up to 4 years showed persistent scarring of the transverse colon, probably due to the extreme dilatation, and mild unspecific inflammation of the terminal ileum without histological evidence of inflammatory bowel disease. A comparison with the 6 previously published cases leads to the following conclusions: in most cases the transverse colon is most severely affected. Treatment with either antimotility agents or systemic glucocorticoids does not seem to promote colonic dilatation. The complication has affected patients of both sexes (4 women, 3 men), in the age range of 21 to 83 years, most of them without an underlying disease. The interval between the start of diarrhea and development of the megacolon ranged widely from 3 to 33 days, as did recovery time (2 days to several months). Three of the 7 patients underwent colectomy for imminent or actual colonic perforation. The delayed recovery of our patient was partly attributed to colonic damage caused by extreme dilatation, leading to ischaemia and subsequent scarring of the mucosa, which persisted. Histologically no Crohn's disease or ulcerative colitis could be found at any stage. A rapid increase in resistance of C. species against fluoroquinolone antibodies has been observed in recent years, due to use of the antibiotics in farming. Our patient's severe illness may partly have resulted from delayed effective antibiotic treatment due to resistance. Antibiotic resistance to common enteropathogens should be considered in the case of unusually prolonged or severe enterocolitis. The level of suspicion for either infection or inflammatory bowel disease should remain high as it may be impossible to distinguish between them on the basis of clinical or endoscopic criteria alone.},

PATIENTS AND METHODS: One hundred and fifty pregnancies in 72 women (28 with ulcerative colitis and 44 with Crohn's disease) were compared with those of 150 control subjects. RESULTS: Among 150 pregnancies, 108 (group I) began before and 42 (group II) at the same time or after the diagnosis of inflammatory bowel disease. In ulcerative colitis patients, age at first pregnancy, mean birth weight and preterm birth rates were not different between groups I and II; rate of underweight offsprings was significantly higher (P < 0.05) in group II than in group I and controls. In Crohn's disease, compared to group I, mean age of first pregnancy was higher (P < 0.0001), mean birth weight was lower (P < 0.005) and preterm birth rate was higher (P = 0.001) than in group II. CONCLUSION: These results suggest that both ulcerative colitis and Crohn's disease induce deleterious effects on pregnancy and fetal outcome.},

   abstract = {OBJECTIVES: During total parenteral nutrition, gallbladder motility is impaired, resulting in sludge and stone formation. Little is known about gallbladder motility during prolonged enteral nutrition. METHODS: We studied gallbladder motility during continuous enteral nutrition (CEN) in nine hospitalized patients with active inflammatory bowel disease. The patients received a polymeric diet (2000 kcal/24 h) by CEN through a nasogastric tube for a prolonged period. Gallbladder volumes were obtained daily by ultrasonography, starting from day 0 (before CEN) and on 7 consecutive days during CEN. At days 0, 1, 4, and 7, the gallbladder response to i.v. cholecystokinin (CCK-33; 0.5 Ivy Dog unit/kg/h) was studied. Plasma CCK levels were determined at regular intervals by radioimmunoassay. RESULTS: No significant differences were observed on day 0 between patients and a group of nine healthy control subjects in fasting gallbladder volumes (19.4 +/- 2.3 and 19.6 +/- 2.4 cm3, respectively) and gallbladder contraction during CCK infusion (56 +/- 14% and 69 +/- 7%, respectively). During CEN, from day 1 to day 7, mean gallbladder volume remained significantly (p < 0.05) reduced compared with fasting gallbladder volume, and mean plasma CCK levels remained significantly (p < 0.05) increased compared with fasting levels. Although gallbladder volume was significantly reduced during CEN, the gallbladder contractile response to CCK was not affected; at days 1, 4, and 7, gallbladder contraction was 36-57%. CONCLUSIONS: During CEN, 1) gallbladder volume is significantly reduced and plasma CCK levels are significantly increased, 2) these effects are sustained over time (7 days), and 3) the gallbladder remains responsive to exogenous CCK. These results indicate that gallbladder contractility and gallbladder responsiveness to CCK are preserved during prolonged CEN in patients with inflammatory bowel disease.},

   abstract = {Prompt diagnosis and exclusion of infection requires a minimum of rigid sigmoidoscopy, rectal mucosal biopsy and stool culture. Admission to hospital is mandatory for patients with features of severe disease, or who are in their first attack of ulcerative colitis and have bloody diarrhoea, even if the criteria for severe disease are not met. Once admitted, the patient should be monitored by plain abdominal X-ray, full blood count, serum albumin and C reactive protein on alternate days; temperature and pulse rate should be recorded four times per day. Treatment should be instituted as soon as the diagnosis is made with an intravenous corticosteroid (hydrocortisone 100 mg intravenously, four times daily, or equivalent). Antibiotics may be included if infection cannot be confidently excluded. Free diet can be allowed but attention should be given to nutritional, fluid and electrolyte status with intravenous replacement if necessary. Any evidence of colonic dilatation occurring despite maximal therapy should be regarded as an absolute indication for colectomy. The patient should be kept fully informed from an early stage about the likely natural history of the condition and about the possible therapeutic options including surgery. Cyclosporin therapy should be reserved for patients who have a poor response to the first 3-4 days of corticosteroid therapy, particularly those with serum C reactive protein > 45 mg/l and who do not yet have absolute indications for colectomy. Most patients who have not convincingly responded within 10 days of starting full medical therapy should undergo colectomy, although partial responders who are afebrile may reasonably continue for up to 14 days before a final decision. Approximately 30-40% of patients with severe colitis will need colectomy within the first 6 months. With optimal management, mortality should be zero, but better medical therapies are urgently needed to reduce the colectomy rate.},

   abstract = {BACKGROUND: There is evidence for a hypercoagulable state in inflammatory bowel disease (IBD), and small vessel thrombosis has been identified in the bowel of patients with Crohn's disease, suggesting thrombosis as a possible etiologic factor. Activated protein C (APC) resistance is the most common inherited disorder leading to thrombosis and accounts for 30% to 40% of episodes of idiopathic venous thrombosis. METHODS: The prevalence of APC resistance was studied in 23 patients with IBD (17 with Crohn's disease, 6 with ulcerative colitis) and in 11 control subjects with recurrent abdominal pain or celiac disease, using an APC resistance screening method. RESULTS: One patient with Crohn's disease had a positive screen result, two patients (one with Crohn's, one with ulcerative colitis) had borderline results, and results in all of the control subjects were normal. One patient with Crohn's disease had a history of a thromboembolic event but had a normal screen result. CONCLUSIONS: Activated protein C resistance does not seem to play a major role in the etiology of the hypercoagulable state in inflammatory bowel disease.},

CASE REPORT: A girl with ulcerative colitis developed at the age of 8 years an acute digestive episode despite prednisolone and total parenteral nutrition. The patient was then given intravenous methylprednisolone (2 mg/kg/d). Polypnea appeared 25 days later while blood pressure remained normal. Echocardiography revealed a cardiac hypertrophy associated with a systolic anterior motion of the mitral valve. Cardiac symptoms and echography findings returned to normal after reduction of corticosteroid therapy and its administration via the oral route. CONCLUSION: Hypertrophic cardiomyopathy has been described in preterms treated with dexamethasone for bronchopulmonary dysplasia. It is exceptional in older children under corticosteroid therapy and its mechanism remains unknown.},

   abstract = {Inflammatory bowel diseases remain a significant chronic disease affecting children and adolescents. Although corticosteroids remain the standard form of therapy for many patients, an era of biological agents for therapy in inflammatory bowel diseases is upcoming with human trials using these agents now forthcoming. In addition, studies on maintenance of remission are beginning to address the selection of those patients most likely to benefit from aminosalicylate therapies, the risks of relapse from using cyclooxygenase inhibitors, the lack of benefit from lipoxygenase inhibitors, and possible future methodologies to examine the effectiveness of the immuno-suppressive agent 6-mercaptopurine. Further development of the hypothesis that new-onset disease may be different than longstanding disease can be appreciated with reports of cytokine analysis in new-onset inflammation and the high risk of progression of disease in new-onset ulcerative proctitis in children. With more reports on the role of intestinal epithelial cells in intestinal diseases, it is now clear that this cell layer is not a passive bystander with regard to the interactions between the luminal contents and immune system components found within the lamina propria; new studies suggest that novel therapeutic strategies may be possible. This review summarizes recently reported aspects of Crohn's disease and ulcerative colitis, with an emphasis on issues-pertinent for younger patients.},

Complete understanding of the potential complications and their management, especially toxic megacolon, is essential. We review the current medical arsenal and advocate a standardized approach to management that includes continuous, high dose intravenous hydrocortisone, more aggressive use of topical steroids as well as feeding the patients and continuing (but not initiating) oral 5-aminosalicylic acid (5-ASA) agents. For those patients whose disease proves refractory to intravenous steroids, intravenous cyclosporin (with an acute response rate of 82%) is an essential component in the medical management of these patients. Antibiotics should be used only when specifically indicated. Total parenteral nutrition has not been shown to be helpful in the acute setting. Air contrast barium enema and colonoscopy have been used to predict response but may be dangerous diagnostic modalities in these acutely ill patients and are no better than good clinical judgement. We review and advocate long-term management of acute response using 6-mercaptopurine or azathioprine. The surgical experience and the postoperative complications of the ileal pouch anal anastomosis, which include acute pouchitis in 50-60%, chronic pouchitis in 5-10% and recent reports of dysplasia among patients with chronic pouchitis, must be considered before colectomy is advised. Over 80% of patients with acute severe colitis can be spared colectomy using our current arsenal of medical therapies.},

   abstract = {The ability of inflammatory bowel disease (IBD) patients to tolerate dairy products and the guidance they receive from physicians and nutritionists on this subject are important considerations in the management of their IBD. Although most affected persons are able to consume a glass of milk daily without discomfort, additional consideration must be given to specific factors that can be relevant to certain individuals. The declaration by patients that they are "dairy sensitive" may be related to lactose intolerance or malabsorption, the long-chain triacylglycerol content of milk, allergy to milk proteins, as well as psychologic factors and the misconception that dairy products can be detrimental to their health. The prevalence of lactose malabsorption is significantly greater in patients with Crohn disease involving the small bowel than it is in patients with Crohn disease involving the colon or ulcerative colitis. In the latter colonic conditions the prevalence of lactose malabsorption is mainly determined by ethnic risk, which is based on genetic factors. In addition, lactose malabsorption in Crohn disease of the small bowel may be determined by factors other than lactase enzyme activity, such as bacterial overgrowth and/or small bowel transit time. Physicians differ widely in the advice they give their patients: some dogmatically advise avoidance of dairy products when the diagnosis is made whereas others discount the possible role of dairy in the management of IBD. IBD patients avoid dairy products more than they would need to based on the prevalence of lactose malabsorption and/or milk intolerance, probably partly because of incorrect patient perceptions and arbitrary advice from physicians and authors of popular diet books. Adequate scientific and clinical information is now available to permit recommendations about the intake of dairy products for each IBD patient.},

   abstract = {OBJECTIVE: To evaluate the effects of smoking on the long term clinical course in patients with ulcerative colitis. METHODS: The medical charts of 556 patients with ulcerative colitis were reviewed retrospectively. Patients were classified as smokers (n = 85) or nonsmokers (n = 471) according to their smoking status during the course of the disease. Extent of colonic lesions, complications, medical requirements, and actuarial rate of colectomy were compared in smokers and nonsmokers. RESULTS: Mean follow-up (+/- SD) was longer in smokers than in nonsmokers (116 +/- 107 mo, vs 87 +/- 94 mo.). Less smokers than nonsmokers required oral steroids (52 vs 63%, P = 0.05). No difference between the groups was observed regarding the use of salicylates, the need for intravenous steroids, for immunosuppressive drugs, for colectomy, and the occurrence of complications. The actuarial rate of colectomy was less in smokers than in nonsmokers (32 +/- 12% and 42 +/- 6% at 10 years respectively. P = 0.04). Initial and cumulative extent of the disease process did not differ between the groups. However, in the subgroup of patients with limited disease at onset, development of pancolitis was less frequent in smokers than in nonsmokers (14 and 26%, respectively, P = 0.04). CONCLUSION: The lesser need for oral steroids and the lower actuarial rate of colectomy in smokers suggest that ulcerative colitis in smokers is characterized by a less severe clinical presentation and a better long term prognosis than in nonsmokers.},

   abstract = {The activation of macrophages and newly recruited monocytes appears to be common to both Crohn's disease and ulcerative colitis, despite different inductive stimuli. Similar activation occurs acutely during the course of invasive intestinal infections such as shigellosis, but is then usually downregulated. The macrophage cytokines tumor necrosis factor-alpha and interleukin-1 (IL-1) are centrally involved in the local inflammatory response, and blockade of either cytokine greatly attenuates the inflammatory lesion. Induction of focal vascular thrombosis and matrix degradation are thought to be an important component of this focal damage. Both cytokines and IL-6 are now recognized to contribute to the systemic effects of intestinal disease, including growth suppression, anorexia, and chronic anemia. Disturbance of sleep patterns, mood, and affect may also occur, and recent evidence points towards bidirectional interplay between macrophage cytokines and central nervous system function.},

This 2-center study examined sera from 102 pediatric patients with inflammatory bowel disease (IBD) to evaluate their diagnostic value and assess their relationship with disease features, distribution, activity and treatment. METHODS: The serum ANCA of 102 children with IBD were measured: 33 UC, 64 CD and 5 UE with various disease locations and degrees of activity. The mean age at the onset of symptoms was 10.7 years (1 to 16.3 years). Sera from 26 unaffected first degree relatives and 20 children without IBD were also investigated. ANCA were detected using indirect immunofluorescence of ethanol-fixed granulocytes. RESULTS: There were ANCA in the sera of 24/33 children with UC (73%), 9/64 with CD (14%) and 4/5 with UE (80%). p-ANCA were more frequent than cytoplasmic-ANCA in positive sera: UC = 67%, CD = 57% and UE = 75%. The presence of ANCA was 73% sensitive and 81% specific for a diagnosis of UC, compared to other IBD (p < 0.001). Three children with proved sclerosing cholangitis associated with UC were all positive. There was no link between ANCA-positive sera and disease activity, or other endoscopic or clinical criteria. ANCA were detected in 4/26 first degree relatives (15%) and in 1/20 control subjects (5%). CONCLUSIONS: Because of their sensitivity and specificity, ANCA may be helpful in the clinical assessment of patients with IBD, and especially those with UC. However, there is no link between the pressure of p-ANCA and the site of UC or its activity, so that it cannot be used to monitor medical treatment or surgical indications.},

Thiol methyltransferase (TMT) activity was measured in erythrocyte membranes as the extent of conversion of 2-mercaptoethanol to S-methyl-2-mercaptoethanol with [3H]methyl-S-adenosyl methionine as methyl donor. Phenol sulfotransferase (PST) activity was measured in platelet homogenates as the extent of sulfation of p-nitrophenol with 3-phosphoadenosine 5-phospho[35S]sulfate (PAPS) as sulfate donor. TMT activity was significantly higher in UC patients (27.0 vs 17.1 nmol/mg protein/hr; P < 0.005). No difference in PST activity was found. We conclude that TMT may be up-regulated in UC to detoxify excess hydrogen sulfide exposed to the peripheral blood compartment. This may arise from either increased luminal sulfide production or reduced colonic detoxification.},

   abstract = {BACKGROUND: Patients with intestinal disease are at risk of developing selenium deficiency due to impaired intestinal absorption. The aim of the present study was to evaluate selenium status and to identify predictive factors of selenium depletion in patients with gastrointestinal disease. METHODS: The concentration of selenium and the activity of glutathione peroxidase in plasma and erythrocytes were measured by fluorometry and by spectrophotometry. Eighty-six patients with Crohn's disease, 40 patients with ulcerative colitis, and 39 patients with various other gastrointestinal diseases were studied. Twenty-seven patients (16%) received home parenteral nutrition. Stool mass, faecal fat, and vitamin B12 absorption were analysed in 100 patients. RESULTS: The plasma selenium concentration was decreased in 85% of the patients receiving supplementary parenteral nutrition and in 20% of the patients receiving oral nutrition, among them in 26% of the patients with Crohn's disease. Almost all patients with ulcerative colitis had normal selenium levels. A statistically significant correlation was found between plasma selenium and vitamin B12 absorption, stool mass, faecal fat excretion, body mass index, P-albumin, P-zinc, and the length of the remaining small bowel. Stepwise regression analyses showed that the strongest predictors of selenium deficiency were stool mass, vitamin B12 absorption, and the length of the small-bowel resection. CONCLUSION: Selenium deficiency is common in patients with severe gastrointestinal disorders. The deficiency is mainly related to malabsorption, and a low selenium level was almost invariably present in patients who needed parenteral supplementation due to gut failure.},

AIM: To investigate the pre-illness diet in patients with recent IBD in comparison with matched population and clinic controls. METHODS: Quantified dietary histories were obtained from 87 patients with recent IBD (54 ulcerative colitis (UC) and 33 Crohn's disease (CD)) and 144 controls. Odds ratios (OR) for IBD were derived for intake levels of various foods. RESULTS: A high sucrose consumption was associated with an increased risk for IBD (OR 2.85 (p = 0.03) against population controls and 5.3 (p = 0.00) against clinic controls). Lactose consumption showed no effect while fructose intake was negatively associated with risk for IBD (NS). Similar trends were noted in UC and CD. A high fat intake was associated with an increased risk for UC; this was particularly marked for animal fat (OR 4.09, p = 0.02) and cholesterol (OR 4.57, p = 0.02). A high intake of fluids (p = 0.04), magnesium (p = 0.04), vitamin C, and fruits (NS) was negatively associated with the risk for IBD, while a positive association was found for retinol (p = 0.01). Most of the findings were similar in UC and CD except for potassium and vegetable consumption which showed a negative association only with risk for CD. CONCLUSIONS: An association was found between pre-illness diet and subsequent development of UC and CD. The effect of dietary components may be primary or modulatory.},

   abstract = {PURPOSE: A retrospective chart review of 20 consecutive patients with 23 anal fistulas treated with cutaneous advancement flap closure was undertaken to ascertain the efficacy of this previously unreported technique. METHODS: The so-called "diamond" and "house" flaps are commonly used to treat anal stenosis, and mucosal advancement flaps are successfully used to close fistulas. The authors began, in 1994, to close selected fistulas with skin advancement flaps after suture closure of the internal opening and adequate drainage of the external opening. Fourteen patients (4 females; average age, 42 years; a total of 14 fistulas) without inflammatory bowel disease and 6 patients (3 females; average age, 35 years) with inflammatory bowel disease (5 with Crohn's disease; 1 with chronic ulcerative colitis; a total of 8 fistulas) were treated. Indications were low internal opening with transsphincteric fistula in both groups. Mucosal advancement was relatively contraindicated, either because of fear of ectropion or, in the inflammatory bowel disease patients, diseased mucosa. No one in the noninflammatory bowel disease group was diverted or kept without anything by mouth, and all were treated as outpatients or with overnight observation. The inflammatory bowel disease group was either diverted (1 patient) or kept on home total parenteral nutrition (5 patients) for three to six weeks. Cyclosporine, antibiotics, 5-acetylsalicylic acid, and other medications were used judiciously in the inflammatory bowel disease group. RESULTS: In the noninflammatory bowel disease group, complete healing of all wounds occurred in 11 patients in an average of 6.5 weeks (average follow-up, 18 months). Complications included donor site separation in two patients and minor incontinence of flatus in one patient. In the inflammatory bowel disease group, five fistulas healed, two failed, and one patient developed a new fistula during an average follow-up of 16 months. Deep venous thrombosis and catheter sepsis occurred in one patient in this group. There were no fatalities in either group. CONCLUSIONS: Although the numbers, especially in the inflammatory bowel disease group, are very small, the results are encouraging. This technique appears to have a place in the armamentarium of the surgeon repairing anal fistulas.},

   abstract = {BACKGROUND & AIMS: Accurate serological assays are desirable for the diagnosis of inflammatory bowel disease (IBD) types in the pediatric age group. The aim of this study was to test the diagnostic accuracy of modified assays for perinuclear (p) antineutrophil cytoplasmic antibodies (ANCAs) and anti-Saccharomyces cerevisiae antibodies (ASCAs) in patients with pediatric ulcerative colitis (UC) and Crohn's disease (CD) and in those without IBD. METHODS: With observers blinded to patients' diagnoses, serum specimens were analyzed for immunoglobulin (Ig) A and IgG ASCAs and ANCAs by enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay. The perinuclear location of ANCAs visualized by indirect immunofluorescence was confirmed by its disappearance after administration of deoxyribonuclease. RESULTS: IgA and IgG ASCA titers were significantly greater and highly specific for CD (95% for either, 100% if both positive). pANCA was 92% specific for UC and absent in all non-IBD controls. The majority of patients with CD positive for pANCA had a UC-like presentation. Disease location, duration, activity, complications, and treatment with immunosuppressive drugs did not have an impact on the ASCA or pANCA assay results. After resection, UC patients remained pANCA positive, in contrast to patients with CD, in whom ASCA titers decreased toward normal values postoperatively. CONCLUSIONS: ASCA and pANCA assays are highly disease specific for CD and UC, respectively. These serological tests can assist clinicians in diagnosing and categorizing patients with IBD and may be useful in making therapeutic decisions.},

   abstract = {BACKGROUND: Growth retardation has been reported in children with chronic inflammatory bowel disease, especially in those with Crohn's disease. Most of these studies concern adolescent patients. METHODS: The growth of 47 prepubertal children (20 boys and 27 girls, mean age at diagnosis 7 years) with inflammatory bowel disease was studied at Tampere University Hospital, Department of Paediatrics. The mean height and height velocity standard deviation scores were calculated at diagnosis and, after that, yearly. The cumulative doses of oral and rectal prednisone per year were calculated. The severity of the disease was scored. The statistical analysis was carried out using the analysis of variance for repeated measurements. RESULTS: During the year preceding the diagnosis, children with inflammatory bowel disease had grown more slowly than their healthy peers. At diagnosis, they were slightly shorter as a group than are healthy children. During treatment and follow-up the mean height velocity of children with inflammatory bowel disease increased (change in the mean height velocity standard deviation scores from -0.84 to +1.08), normalizing the mean heights of these children compared with those of their healthy peers (change in the mean height standard deviation scores from -0.32 to +0.05). In the analysis of covariance, the poorest growth was seen in children with Crohn's disease, scored as severe, and the best growth in children with mild ulcerative colitis. No difference was seen in groups with or without prednisone treatment. CONCLUSIONS: Growth retardation is an important sign of chronic inflammatory bowel disease in prepubertal as well as adolescent children. During treatment, increasing growth velocity brings these children as a group to normal heights for age and sex.},

Male 9-week-old rats were intracolonically administrated trinitrobenzene sulfonic acid (TNBS) and fed the experimental diets containing 0.05% catechin and 0.025% alpha-tocopherol for 1 week, then dissected. The extent of colitis-induced TNBS was assessed macroscopically. The supplementation of catechins and alpha-tocopherol significantly decreased colonic damage compared with the group fed the basal diet (the disease control). In particular, catechin feeding completely inhibited the development of colon adhesions. Colonic myeloperoxidase (MPO) activity, which is a marker of neutrophil infiltration into the colonic mucosa, was lower in the groups that had been given catechins and alpha-tocopherol. The levels of thiobarbituric acid reactive substances in colon was highest in the disease control group; however, the differences among the groups were not significant. Plasma alkaline phosphatase activity was maintained at normal levels in the rats supplemented with catechins and alpha-tocopherol. These results suggest that catechins and alpha-tocopherol have anti-inflammatory effects on TNBS-induced rat colitis.},

LCAP was administered once a week for 5 weeks of intensive therapy and once approximately a month for maintenance therapy, for 38 patients with UC. LCAP could remove approximately 1 x 10(10) white blood cells in each session. In the evaluation, we classified the response to the LCAP as: 1) excellent, 2) moderately improved, 3) no change, and 4) deterioration. Clinical improvement was recognized in 29 of 38 patients (76%) including 8 with dramatic response during the intensive therapy, and continued throughout the maintenance therapy in 26 patients (68.4%). Even though their symptoms were mild, the patients with more than 5 years UC history seemed to be not effective. The patients with moderately improvement and with excellent response have kept remission for about 20 months and about 2.5 years on an average, respectively. Clinical and blood examinations showed no side effects in any cases. It suggests that LCAP is able to be a UC treatment between drug therapies and an operation.},

   abstract = {Selected inflammatory conditions of the distal alimentary tract may respond to topical SCFA treatment. The rationale for using SCFA enemas is based on Roediger's (1980) observation that butyrate is the preferred fuel of colonocytes and that SCFA deficiency could lead, in the short term, to mucosal hypoplasia and, in the long term, to colitis. The absence of luminal nutrients is especially evident in the excluded rectum after complete diversion of the faecal stream. Harig et al. (1989) were the first to treat successfully diversion colitis with SCFA irrigation (acetate 60 mM, propionate 30 mM, n-butyrate 40 mM). However, subsequent studies could not reproduce the initial positive data. In distal ulcerative colitis an impaired mucosal oxidation of SCFAs has been described despite their luminal abundance. Pilot studies using either the SCFA mixture or butyrate monotherapy have yielded promising results. However, extended confirmatory studies with a larger sample size have not yet been performed. Preliminary data are also available for the use of SCFA in pouchitis and radiation proctitis. In summary, SCFA topical therapy seems to be a promising option in distinct forms of inflammatory bowel disease; however, the routine use of SCFAs cannot be recommended until their efficacy has been confirmed in larger trials.},

Starvation of colonocytes through lack or impaired metabolism of luminal SCFAs may be a cofactor in the pathogenesis of ulcerative colitis. DESIGN: A detailed histological evaluation of colonic biopsy specimens was performed in patients with active distal ulcerative colitis who were treated with rectal enemas containing a mixture of SCFAs, n-butyrate alone or saline placebo. Together with light microscopic parameters of mucosal inflammation, the pattern of crypt cell proliferation (proliferating cell nuclear antigen) and the mucosal activity of factor XIII were assessed. RESULTS: Butyrate reduced the density of polymorphonuclear leucocytes in the lamina propria (4 weeks: P = 0.063; 8 weeks: P = 0.091); other inflammatory parameters remained unchanged. Both butyrate and the SCFA mixture reduced significantly the number of proliferating cells in the upper 40% of crypts. Tissue factor XIII activity in active ulcerative colitis was significantly lower than in mucosa from normal colons; however, it was not affected by SCFA or butyrate irrigation. CONCLUSION: SCFAs and butyrate have a more marked effect on crypt cell proliferation than on parameters of inflammation in patients with active ulcerative colitis.},

   abstract = {Inflammatory bowel disease represents chronic idiopathic disorders which involve either the colon exclusively (ulcerative colitis) of any part of the gastrointestinal tract (Crohn's disease). The course of these entities is typified by periods of symptomatic exacerbation interspersed with clinical remissions. Management is based upon regimens which decrease mucosal inflammation. Colonic disease distal to the splenic flexure may be treated with topical therapy, but other regions generally necessitate oral therapy. Currently used medications include the aminosalicylates, glucocorticoids, antibiotics and immunomodulators. The immunomodulator class of medications includes azathioprine, 6-mercaptopurine, cyclosporine A and methotrexate. Newer agents include short-chain fatty acids, omega-3 fatty acids and antibodies directed to tumor necrosis factor. Medical management also occasionally involves optimizing nutritional status with the addition of elemental diets or total parenteral nutrition. Management of specific clinical presentations is discussed.},

   abstract = {Increased expression of intercellular adhesion molecule-1 (ICAM-1) in the colon of inflammatory bowel disease (IBD) has been reported. We evaluated the effects of monoclonal antibodies to ICAM-1 on acute colitis induced by dextran sodium sulphate (DSS) in rats. Colitis was induced by feeding rats 3% DSS for 7 days. Anti-ICAM-1 antibody or vehicle alone was injected intraperitoneally in rats daily from day 0 to day 6. On day 7 the rats were killed and colitis was evaluated histologically. Prophylactic treatment with anti-ICAM-1 significantly attenuated colonic damage, neutrophil infiltration and the shortening of the colon in DSS colitis. Our findings demonstrate that ICAM-1 plays an important role in this model of inflammatory bowel disease. Although this study does not directly address the effect of anti-ICAM-1 therapy in IBD, our findings encourage experiments using therapies that target ICAM-1 in rats with already developed disease.},

   abstract = {It is currently held that the pathogenesis of inflammatory bowel disease (IBD) involves a complex interaction of host responses, some immunologic and genetically determined, and external influences including microbial and dietary factors. Nutritional surveys and studies testing stepwise exclusion dietary compounds have suggested that dietary factors might be linked to the occurrence of IBD. Food allergy was suggested early as a possible trigger for the inflammatory response; however, no firm evidence has been gathered over the years to substantiate this possibility. The possibility that patients with Crohn's disease may have an unusual premorbid pattern of dietary intake has also been examined since the early seventies. Several groups of investigators report a high intake of refined sugars (i.e. sucrose), recycled cooking oil, a more frequent consumption of fast foods in patients with Crohn's disease and ulcerative colitis respectively. However, a critical comparison of incidence and prevalence studies published from 1976 until 1994 clearly showed no pre-existing nutritional abnormality that has been identified consistently in patients who develop inflammatory bowel disease.},

   abstract = {New therapeutic measures in inflammatory bowel diseases (IBD) are either based on actual data on disease pathogenesis or on new pharmaceutic preparations of known drugs. An overshooting immune response with T cell activation in the local gut associated immune system seems to be central in the etiopathogenesis of IBD. Modulation of the antigenic load in the gut lumen by parenteral or enteral nutrition or antibiotic treatment can alter disease activity. Immunosuppressive drugs are able to decrease the overshooting immune response. Azathioprin has its clear value in chronic active steroid dependent disease courses of Crohn's disease. According to recent studies, Methotrexate seems to be active as well, however, more studies are necessary. Several studies were not able to prove that Cyclosporine is of value in the treatment of Crohn's disease. Newer preparations of aminosalicylates have shown effectiveness in both active disease and prolongation of remission in Crohn's disease in high doses. Local release formulations of steroids with high first-pass-effect as Budesonide will have their indication in subgroups of IBD patients. However, systemic steroid application is still the gold standard in active disease.},
