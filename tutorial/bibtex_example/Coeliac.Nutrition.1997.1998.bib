The diagnosis of coeliac disease was made using the revised diagnostic criteria of the European Society of Paediatric Gastroenterology and Nutrition. Seventy-seven of the children conformed to these criteria. The demographic and clinical features of the disease were studied and compared with other studies in Arab countries and elsewhere. The male:female ratio was 1:1.3. Weight loss, anaemia, anorexia, diarrhoea and abdominal distention, in descending order of frequency, were the most frequently occurring clinical features. Jejunal biopsy is mandatory for the diagnosis of coeliac disease.},

   abstract = {This paper presents a new hypothesis for the etiology and pathogenesis of celiac disease (CD). It is our contention that CD is triggered by the binding of one or more gliadin peptides to CD-associated HLA class II molecules. Furthermore, we propose that these putative CD peptides bind to oligosaccharide residues on HLA class II molecules distal to the peptide-binding groove invoking recognition and binding by specialized subsets of gamma delta T cell receptor-bearing lymphocytes. The binding of these gamma delta T cells serves as a signal for abrogation of oral tolerance to ingested proteins setting in motion a series of immune responses directed against the small intestinal epithelium of CD patients. CD patients are victimized by this self-distructed immune response because of inheritance of certain combinations of HLA-DQ and DR haplotypes. Dimers encoded by HLA-DR haplotypes may be the primary restriction elements for lectin-like, gliadin peptides while the degree of immune suppression (or lack thereof) to ingested gliadins is governed by inherited HLA-DQ haplotypes. Finally, we speculate that molecular mimicry between one or more gliadin peptides and some, as yet unidentified, bacterial or viral superantigen plays a role in disease pathogenesis.},

However, notwithstanding patient' belief about 'allergies' related to food stuffs, only a minority of them have actually such a diagnosis substantiated. Moreover, the diagnostic approach to these problems is cumbersome and unsatisfactory, and the objectivation of a food hypersensitivity is often difficult. PATIENTS AND METHODS: For these reasons we studied by means of small bowel manometry a small group of patients with food hypersensitivity, and showed abnormal fasting and postprandial findings in those with the gut as a target organ on clinical grounds. RESULTS: Manometric abnormalities were somewhat similar to those previously described in celiac disease, a well recognized food allergy disease. The possible usefulness of this technique in the investigative approach of food hypersensitivity is discussed.},

   abstract = {BACKGROUND: Short stature is one of the features of Turner syndrome and a form of presentation of monosymptomatic celiac disease. METHODS: The recognition of celiac disease in two antiendomysium antibody-positive Turner syndrome girls who did not respond to growth hormone treatment led us to perform as a screening for celiac disease IgA and IgG antigliadin antibodies and antiendomysium antibodies determination in other 35 Turner syndrome patients. Intestinal biopsy was proposed to the antiendomysium antibodies-positive girls; in the former, subtotal villous atrophy was found; in the latter, one parent's consent for intestinal biopsy was not obtained. RESULTS: The prevalence of celiac disease in Turner syndrome patients observed in the present study (8.1 if we consider 3 villous atrophy, 10.8 if we consider 4 antiendomysium antibody-positive) is quite high and seems to indicate that the association of these two disorders could not be coincidental. As to the clinical picture, celiac disease appeared atypical in one case, typical in another one and as a silent form in the third case. Of the 3 cases with villous atrophy on gluten-free diet growth hormone therapy was not effective in two girls, who were older than 16 years, while in the younger patient, detected by the screening, a significant increment of height velocity and height Standard Deviation Score for Chronological Age according to Turner references was observed. CONCLUSIONS: This study suggests that celiac disease can be associated with Turner syndrome and even responsible for a failure of growth hormone therapy. Therefore we propose to perform in Turner syndrome patients antiendomysium antibody determination as a screening followed by intestinal biopsy in positive cases. This would be advisable at least before starting growth hormone treatment.},

METHODS: IgA and IgG antigliadin antibodies (AGA) were determined with an enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay technique. IgA anti-R1-reticulin antibodies (ARA) and IgA antiendomysium antibodies (EmA) were determined with the fluorescein isothiocyanate-conjugate-labeled anti-human immunoglobulin technique. To compare sensitivity and specificity, EmA were identified using monkey esophagus and human umbilical cord as substrates. RESULTS: While AGA (IgA and IgG) showed a high sensitivity but a low specificity, ARA showed a high specificity but a low sensitivity. Data on EmA showed a high sensitivity and specificity with both tissue sections, with monkey esophagus being more sensitive (96%) and umbilical cord more specific (100%). CONCLUSIONS: Our results confirm the importance of celiac disease-related antibodies in identifying celiac children. Moreover, the easy availability of human umbilical cord indicates that it would be proper to use this tissue as substrate, instead of monkey esophagus, for EmA search in the future.},

   abstract = {BACKGROUND: Concern over the adequacy of histologic diagnosis of endoscopic duodenal biopsies in children prompted this comparative study on the histologic quality of endoscopic versus capsule biopsies. We found this problem addressed in only six previous reports. METHODS: Blind examinations of the histologic sections of 48 duodenal biopsies obtained by gastrointestinal endoscopy in children aged 2-18 years were compared to 52 biopsies obtained by the small bowel suction method (from children aged 1-16 years). RESULTS: Although 87.5% of endoscopic biopsies and 94.2% of capsule biopsies were adequate for histologic diagnosis, fragmentation or squashing was seen in 83.3% of endoscopic biopsies and only in 25% of capsule biopsies. CONCLUSIONS: Biopsies obtained by suction are of better quality than those obtained by endoscopy. If endoscopy is preferred for technical reasons, the following conditions should be observed: the patients should be aged over 2 years, and a minimum of four biopsies should be obtained with forceps of a diameter greater than 2 mm. Adequate histologic criteria for diagnosis should include at least one full-thickness mucosal specimen more than 3 mm in length, vertically oriented, and not fragmented. In children under age 2, duodenal or jejunal capsule biopsies are preferred, since the specimens are usually larger and less fragmented. Endoscopy is technically more difficult in the very young patient.},

In this study body composition, dietary habits, basal energy expenditure, and substrate oxidation were investigated in patients with the classic form of coeliac disease. METHODS: Sixteen untreated and 18 adult coeliac patients on a gluten-free diet participated in the study. Body composition was assessed by anthropometry and bioimpedance. Energy expenditure was measured by indirect calorimetry. A food diary over 7 days was collected. RESULTS: Coeliac patients showed reduced body weight components but not a different fat-free mass percentage compared with age- and sex-matched healthy volunteers. Basal metabolic rate normalized by fat-free mass (BMR/FFM) was higher in coeliac patients than in controls. Untreated patients showed a significantly higher non-protein respiratory quotient with regard to both treated patients (P < 0.01) and controls (P < 0.05), an increased percentage of carbohydrate intake, and a good correlation between lipid faecal loss and carbohydrate oxidation (Spearman R = 0.74; P < 0.01). CONCLUSIONS: Both groups of patients had lower fat mass and FFM content than controls. The preferential carbohydrate oxidation in untreated patients might be a result of both lipid malabsorption and high carbohydrate intake.},

Four patients had a complicated celiac disease, 3 did not respond to a gluten-free diet, and 2 had an ulcerative jejunitis (including 1 patient with nonresponsive celiac disease). Seven patients had an untreated celiac disease responsive to a gluten-free diet. Histological examination of duodenal biopsies of these 11 patients showed benign-appearing celiac disease without evidence of lymphoma. Four patients with nonulcer dyspepsia and normal duodenal biopsies served as controls. TCRgamma gene rearrangements were analyzed by multiplex polymerase chain reaction on DNA extracted from duodenal biopsies. Major clonal rearrangements of the T-cell receptor were found in 4 cases, all with complicated celiac disease. Monoclonality was confirmed by DNA sequencing of the junctional region in 3 cases and by hybridization with clone-specific oligoprobes. Patients with celiac disease responsive to gluten-free diet had mainly a polyclonal pattern, with 1 of them having an oligoclonal rearrangement. An oligoclonal pattern was also observed in 2 control patients. Three patients with complicated celiac disease evolved to T-cell lymphoma with liver (n = 2) or bone marrow (n = 1) invasion. Identical clones were found in the enteropathic duodenojejunum and peripheral blood in the patient with large-cell lymphoma with bone marrow invasion. This study suggests that complicated celiac disease is a cryptic T-cell lymphoma.},

AIMS: To investigate pancreatic function in HIV infected children and to determine whether faecal fat loss, a prominent feature of intestinal dysfunction, is associated with pancreatic dysfunction. PATIENTS: Forty seven children with HIV infection without apparent pancreatic disease and 45 sex and age matched healthy controls. METHODS: Pancreatic function was evaluated by measuring elastase 1 concentration and chymotrypsin activity in stools by ELISA and colorimetric methods, respectively. Intestinal function was evaluated by measuring fat and protein loss by the steatocrit method and by faecal alpha1 antitrypsin concentration. RESULTS: 14 (30%) had abnormal pancreatic function tests: seven had isolated elastase activity deficiency, three isolated chymotrypsin deficiency, and four pancreatic deficiencies in both enzymes. Patient enzyme values were significantly lower than those of controls. Low faecal pancreatic enzymes were not associated with symptoms. Twelve children had steatorrhoea and four had increased alpha1 antitrypsin. Steatorrhoea was significantly associated with reduced faecal pancreatic enzymes. There was a significant negative correlation between elastase 1 concentration and steatocrit. Children with pathological faecal elastase 1 or chymotrypsin values did not differ from the other HIV infected children with respect to nutritional and immunological status, stage of HIV disease, presence of opportunistic infections, or drug administration. CONCLUSIONS: Abnormal pancreatic function tests are a frequent feature of paediatric HIV infection; this condition is associated with steatorrhoea, which probably contributes to the disease.},

   abstract = {OBJECTIVE: To test the effectiveness of serologic antigliadin antibody (AGA) testing in predicting celiac disease in children. DESIGN: Prospective clinical assessment. SETTING: Hopital Sainte-Justine, montreal. PATIENTS: A total of 176 children with possible celiac disease who were referred for duodenal biopsy between January 1992 and June 1995. OUTCOME MEASURES: IgA and IgG AGA titres, as determined by enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay (ELISA); duodenal biopsy; clinical outcome on a gluten-free diet. RESULTS: Of the 176 children 30 were found to have celiac disease according to the criteria of the European Society of Pediatric Gastroenterology and Nutrition (ESPGAN). The sensitivity and specificity of the IgA AGA titre, as well as its positive and negative predictive values, were 80%, 92%, 67% and 96% respectively; the corresponding values for the IgG AGA titre were 83%, 79%, 45% and 96%. The respective values for IgA and IgG AGA titres combined were 93%, 71%, 43% and 98%. Only 2 of the 30 patients with celiac disease had false-negative results for both IgA and IgG AGA titres. The IgA and IgG AGA titres decreased significantly (p < 0.005) in all 11 patients after being on a gluten-free diet for at least 10 months and reached normal values in 8. CONCLUSION: AGA screening for celiac disease permits better selection of patients for duodenal biopsy and adds specificity to the histologic diagnosis. Such screening cannot replace intestinal biopsy, which remains the gold standard for diagnosis.},

   abstract = {OBJECTIVE: Evaluate in patients with celiac disease the tolerance of prolonged consumption of small amounts of gliadin contained in products containing wheat starch. DESIGN: Open 1-year trial of the addition of wheat starch to a gluten-free diet in a cohort of adult patients with biopsy-proven celiac disease who had never consumed wheat starch. The control group consisted of patients with celiac disease who tolerated wheat starch. SUBJECTS: Seventeen patients with celiac disease and 14 control patients, all diagnosed according to criteria of the European Society of Pediatric Gastroenterology and Nutrition, were recruited from the Canadian Celiac Association and the Quebec Celiac Foundation. SETTING: The study was conducted in the outpatient clinic of the Gastroenterology and Nutrition Service of Ste Justine Hospital, Montreal, Quebec, Canada. INTERVENTIONS: Patients were asked to consume four to six portions daily of a wheat starch-containing product, mainly bread, for up to 1 year. MAIN OUTCOME MEASURES: The gliadin content of the wheat starch product used in this trial was quantified by enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay. Patient outcome measures included symptoms, nutritional parameters (anthropometric data, complete blood count, serum folate and iron levels), and immunologic parameters (antigliadin antibody and antiendomysium antibody titers). RESULTS: A quantifiable amount of immunoreactive gliadin (0.75 mg/100 g) was found in the wheat starch. The majority of the patients with celiac disease (11 of 17) who had never consumed wheat starch previously developed symptoms, which resolved within weeks of discontinuing the product. Relapse of skin lesions was seen in two of three patients with coexisting dermatitis herpetiformis. No weight loss or biochemical changes were observed. Despite the presence of symptoms, antigliadin antibody and antiendomysium antibody determinations were not useful to detect the clinical intolerance. APPLICATIONS: The innocuousness of the long-term ingestion of "gluten-free" products containing wheat starch is still unproven, and prolonged use of such products by patients with celiac disease cannot be recommended.},

   abstract = {BACKGROUND: The finding of characteristic small intestinal mucosal abnormalities on histologic examination of a biopsy specimen remains the first requirement for the diagnosis of celiac disease. A reliable and noninvasive test would be ideal for the patient's convenience and for reducing health-care costs. The sensitivity and specificity of anti-gliadin antibodies (AGA-immunoglobulin [Ig] G, AGA-IgA) have been variable; anti-endomysium IgA (EmA-IgA) is more helpful. In an earlier study conducted at the authors' institution, celiac disease was present in 19 patients examined from 1992 to 1995. Anti-endomysium titers were higher than normal in all 19 patients (100%). Total villous atrophy was seen in 14 of 17 biopsy specimens (82%) and subtotal atrophy in 3 (18%). The purpose of the current study was to evaluate further the accuracy of EmA-IgA in diagnosing celiac disease. METHODS: One hundred seven patients were screened for celiac disease between March 1996 and July 1997. The level of EmA-IgA was measured in all patients, and AGA-IgG and AGA-IgA were measured in 104 patients. Forty-six patients underwent endoscopic biopsy of the small bowel, with measurement of disaccharidase enzymes in 45 patients. RESULTS: Five of 46 patients had celiac disease (three boys and two girls; mean age, 5.3 years; 2-9.5 years); one also had cystic fibrosis and another had insulin-dependent diabetes mellitus. All five had marked to complete villous atrophy with crypt hyperplasia and increased serum EmA-IgA (100% sensitivity). None of the remaining patients had increased EmA-IgA (100% specificity). Serum levels of AGA-IgG and AGA-IgA were increased in all four celiac disease patients (100% sensitivity), but they were also high in patients without celiac disease (38% and 92% specificity, respectively), which compromises their diagnostic value. None of the patients confirmed to have celiac disease had IgA deficiency. Abnormal disaccharidase enzyme activities were documented in all five celiac disease patients: severe generalized deficiency (n = 2), moderately severe generalized deficiency (n = 2), and alactasia with moderate deficiency of the alpha-glucosidases (n = 1). CONCLUSIONS: This study confirmed the reliability and accuracy of EmA-IgA in the diagnosis of celiac disease. Small bowel biopsy may be unnecessary in EmA-positive patients in whom celiac disease is suspected.},

   abstract = {Celiac disease is characterized by small intestinal damage with loss of absorptive villi and hyperplasia of the crypts, typically leading to malabsorption. In addition to nutrient deficiencies, prolonged celiac disease is associated with an increased risk for malignancy, especially intestinal T-cell lymphoma. Celiac disease is precipitated by ingestion of the protein gliadin, a component of wheat gluten, and usually resolves on its withdrawal. Gliadin initiates mucosal damage which involves an immunological process in individuals with a genetic predisposition. However, the mechanism responsible for the small intestinal damage characteristic of celiac disease is still under debate. Small intestinal biopsy with the demonstration of a flat mucosa which is reversed on a gluten-free diet is considered the main approach for diagnosis of classical celiac disease. In addition, IgA antibodies against gliadin and endomysium, a structure of the smooth muscle connective tissue, are valuable tools for the detection of patients with celiac disease and for therapy control. Incidence rates of childhood celiac disease range from 1:300 in Western Ireland to 1:4700 in other European countries, and subclinical cases detected by serological screening revealed prevalences of 3.3 and 4 per 1000 in Italy and the USA, respectively. IgA antibodies to endomysium are particularly specific indicators of celiac disease, suggesting that this structure contains one or more target autoantigens that play a role in the pathogenesis of the disease. However, the identification of the endomysial autoantigen(s) has remained elusive. We identified tissue transglutaminase as the unknown endomysial autoantigen. Interestingly, gliadin is a preferred substrate for this enzyme, giving rise to novel antigenic epitopes.},

A 55-year-old woman with presumed celiac disease presented with steroid-refractory diarrhea, weight loss and abdominal pain. A laparotomy was performed to exclude the possibility of a lymphomatous disorder, and multiple nonmalignant small bowel ulcerations were discovered. Despite a combination of treatment with total parenteral nutrition (TPN) and prednisone 30 mg/day she continued to deteriorate. The addition of azathioprine to her treatment regimen resulted in marked clinical and biochemical improvement. Her enteroscopy normalized, and she was able to discontinue TPN and reduce her steroid requirements. Although azathioprine has been used occasionally to treat refractory sprue, there have been no reports of its use in NGUJI. In this case, azathioprine played a key role in the management of NGUJI and should be considered a treatment option for patients with this disorder.},

   abstract = {BACKGROUND: Knowledge of splanchinic hemodynamics in celiac disease is scarce. The hemodynamic parameters of the superior mesenteric artery were evaluated by duplex Doppler ultrasonography in children with celiac disease to show whether histomorphologic changes in small bowel mucosa led to any alteration in splanchinic blood flow. METHODS: The hemodynamic parameters of the superior mesenteric artery were evaluated by Doppler ultrasonography in 23 children with celiac disease. Ten patients were studied at the time of diagnosis. The remaining 13 children were studied after complete clinical and histologic recovery induced by gluten-free diet. Additionally, 9 patients out of 13 who were on a gluten-free diet for about 2 years were given gluten challenge, and superior mesenteric artery blood flow was measured after the challenge. The results were compared with those of healthy children. RESULTS: Peak systolic velocity of the superior mesenteric artery was higher in untreated celiac patients than in healthy controls and treated celiac patients. Peak systolic velocity of the superior mesenteric artery in the treated group of children was close to that of control subjects, implying that successful treatment with gluten-free diet improves hemodynamic changes. The comparison of Doppler ultrasonographic measurements of the challenge group before and after the gluten challenge revealed that the peak systolic velocity, resistive index, and blood flow of the superior mesenteric artery were changed significantly. CONCLUSIONS: The pathophysiologic events in small bowel mucosa during the active phase of celiac disease induce some hemodynamic changes that can be detected noninvasively by duplex Doppler ultrasonography.},

The present study, using a survey similar to that of the New York City investigation, evaluated the diagnostic and management experience of specialists for adult celiac disease patients in British Columbia. Four hundred and four patients were reported in the combined clinical practice experience of the responding physicians. Of these, 59, or 15%, were diagnosed in the prior year. Although each physician diagnosed an average of 2.4 new celiac disease patients per year in their entire practice experience, an average of over 4.0 new celiac disease patients were detected in the past year. Most patients presented with diarrhea, weight loss, anemia or nutrient deficiency, but about 14% were asymptomatic or diagnosed by an incidental small intestinal biopsy done at upper gastrointestinal endoscopy. Specialist physicians in British Columbia usually refer patients to their family physicians, dietitians and patient support groups for continued care and appear to rarely rely on serological assays, including antibody tests, for detection of celiac disease in adults. An associated or complicating lymphoma was detected in 16 of 404 patients (4%). Recognition of biopsy-defined celiac disease appears to be increasing in British Columbia.},

Health professionals should ensure the baby receives a sufficient and balanced diet during the weaning period, to meet the needs for energy and growth. Breast milk or infant formula should continue up to the age of at least one year. The weaning period is a good time to educate parents in good nutrition. A wide variety of foods should be the aim in child nutrition, but each different type needs to be started separately during weaning. Care is needed to ensure vegetarian babies receive enough proteins, vitamins and minerals (especially iron). Failure to thrive has a multitude of causes, and treatment must be that of the cause. Strictly vegan children who eat no dairy products will need added synthetic vitamin B12. Failure to thrive may be due to physical problems (eg choanal atresia), infection, vomiting, diarrhoea, anorexia, parental ignorance or poverty. Other causes include coeliac disease, cow's milk protein allergy, cystic fibrosis, severe eczema or asthma, or diabetes.},

The aim of this study was evaluate the compliance to a gluten-free diet and the dietary habits in general of coeliac teenagers and young adults. PATIENTS AND METHODS: A total of 306 adolescents and young adults were followed in a coeliac clinic. They were grouped on the basis of: strict compliance to a gluten-free dietary regimen (n = 223, 73%); dietary transgressions 2-3 times/month (n = 46, 15%); and frequent transgressions or a full gluten-containing diet (n = 37, 12%). RESULTS: The physical growth status was optimal in the male patients, and less so in the females, but was not related to compliance. Symptoms were very rare in all groups. Compliance to the diet was related to sex (females better than males), age (younger better than older), good school grades, and good self-esteem. CONCLUSIONS: The teen-agers studied consumed an average of about 11.32 kg/month of gluten-free products provided by the Italian Health System. Gluten-free pasta and bread were the daily choices. The mean cost for each patient was estimated to be Italian Lire 242,640 (ECU 124) per month or ECU 1,490/year.},

   abstract = {BACKGROUND: Celiac disease has a wide range of clinical features. The goal of this study was to evaluate whether specific HLA genotypes are associated with particular clinical appearances. METHODS: One hundred forty-five patients with confirmed celiac disease were oligotyped for DR and DQ HLA genes. Clinical notes, physical examination, and a questionnaire provided their personal data. Patients were grouped into nine genotypic categories, according to the presence of the specific DQ heterodimer DQA1*0501-DQB1*0201 (hence termed alpha0beta0), in single or double dose, and the presence of the DRB4 antigen. RESULTS: Age at first symptoms and age at beginning of gluten-free diet were not significantly different in the nine groups. The initial symptoms of the disease had a similar distribution in all groups. In twenty-seven patients, disease was diagnosed by family screening: they shared a similar HLA genotype with those who had relevant symptoms. The actual growth status-evaluated by standardized height, percentage of median weight for age, and percentage of median weight for height--was not different in the nine groups. Presence of unusual health complaints was not associated with a specific genotype. CONCLUSIONS: There is no evidence that clinical features of celiac disease are associated with different HLA genotypes. Genes outside the HLA may play a relevant role.},

We examined the nutritional status of 40 adult patients with newly diagnosed celiac disease classified according to the grade of villous atrophy: partial, subtotal, and total. Nutritional status was determined by food records as well as by anthropometric and biochemical measurements. Anthropometric results did not differ among the three atrophy groups, but serum ferritin and erythrocyte folate were lower in patients with total villous atrophy than in the other groups. Most of the abnormal biochemical values were normalized during 1 y of a gluten-free diet; villous atrophy healed concomitantly. To conclude, patients with total mucosal villous atrophy at diagnosis had low erythrocyte folate and serum ferritin values, but no other major differences were found in nutritional status among celiac disease patients with different grades of villous atrophy.},

   abstract = {BACKGROUND: An improvement in screening for celiac disease has recently been described that uses human umbilical cord as a substitute for monkey esophagus to determine IgA endomysium antibodies in adults. As using monkey esophagus is ethically questionable for large-scale screening, we studied whether substitution of umbilical cord would be suitable for pediatric patients as well. METHODS: Serum from 53 children with untreated celiac disease, 22 in remission and 13 on challenge, were screened for antigliadin IgA, antigliadin IgG, and IgA reticulin antibodies, in addition to IgA endomysium antibodies tested both on monkey esophagus and on human umbilical cord. Controls included 20 patients with cow-milk-sensitive enteropathy, 23 with inflammatory bowel disease, and 23 with diabetes mellitus, and 48 patients who were biopsied to exclude celiac disease either because of positive gliadin antibody test or disturbed growth. RESULTS: Sensitivity (0.94) and specificity (1.0) were similar for umbilical cord and esophageal determinations in active celiac disease. Both substrates detected identical positive cases and neither gave false-positive results. In celiac patients on a gluten-free diet, endomysium antibodies with either substrate were positive in seven identical cases and negative in 15 of 22 cases. Correlations with reticulin antibodies were comparable with human umbilical cord and monkey esophagus (0.83 and 0.85, respectively; Spearman Correlation Section Pair-Wise deletion). CONCLUSIONS: Human umbilical cord is an excellent substitute for monkey esophagus to determine endomysium antibodies in celiac diagnosis in children and adolescents.},

   abstract = {BACKGROUND: In order to assess their long-term predictability for the diagnosis of celiac disease, antiendomysium antibody results were compared with the outcome of the Interlaken diagnostic process. METHODS: Prospective gluten challenge was performed in 153 children with previously diagnosed flat small-intestine mucosa. In 90 patients (Group A), endomysium antibodies were initially positive, in seven (Group B) they were negative, and 56 patients (Group C) had no initial serological results. In IgA-deficient persons, IgG antibodies were also assayed, both by the immunofluorescent method. RESULTS: Histological relapse rates were 100% (90/90), 14.3% (1/7), and 76.8% (43/56), p < 0.001, in Groups A, B, and C, respectively. Each patient with relapse also exhibited endomysium antibody positivity during the challenge. Patients in whom celiac disease could be finally ruled out remained consistently endomysium-antibody negative. The celiac disease patient in Group B had severe secondary immunoglobulin deficiency at entry, which explained the initial negativity. Diagnosis based on antiendomysium antibody positivity and flat mucosa gave a higher applicability (92.8 vs. 50.3%) and reliability (relapse rate 100 vs. 89.6%) than the 1990 European Society of Paediatric Gastroenterology and Nutrition (ESPGAN) criteria among these patients. CONCLUSIONS: Endomysium antibody positivity at presentation has been found to be as useful as gluten challenge in the diagnosis of celiac disease, even in patients under the age of 2 years. Challenge is still advisable in patients with a flat small intestinal mucosa when antiendomysium antibody results are negative or have not been done, as among these patients significantly lower relapse rates were found.},

METHOD: Coeliac axis and superior mesenteric artery (SMA) blood flow velocity were measured longitudinally in a cohort of 61 babies using Doppler ultrasound. RESULTS: Babies fed 1 hourly had significantly higher preprandial SMA peak systolic velocity (PSV) than those fed 3 hourly (70 vs 53 cm/s). Those fed 1 hourly showed no postprandial change whereas those fed 3 hourly showed significant postprandial hyperaemia. This hyperaemia had longer latency (42 vs 27 mins) and smaller amplitude (31 vs 25 mins) after expressed breast milk compared with preterm formula. The addition of long chain polyunsaturated fatty acids to the formulas had no effect on the postprandial response. CONCLUSION: Hourly bolus feeding leads to a persistent hyperaemic state in the SMA. The composition of feeds is an important determinant of the postprandial response of the SMA to 3 hourly feeding.},

METHODS: We measured basal and postprandial oxyntomodulin-like immunoreactivity values in 35 children divided into 3 groups: group 1 was composed of 13 children with celiac disease, either under a gluten-free diet (8 patients) or normal diet (5 patients); group 2 was composed of 8 children hospitalized for gastroenteritis or chronic diarrhea, without biological evidence of malabsorption nor abnormal jejunal mucosa; group 3 was composed of 22 control subjects. RESULTS: Fasting and meal-stimulated levels in the control group were 71+/-10 and 130+/-26 pmol/l, respectively. Mean concentrations were elevated in patients with celiac disease (basal = 349+/-254 pmol/l, postprandial = 446+/-332 pmol/l) and in the group 2 (basal = 139+/-58 pmol/l, postprandial = 218+/-85 pmol/l), but the difference with control subjects did not reach statistical significance. In children with celiac disease, basal and stimulated values correlated with the degree of malabsorption as assessed by hemoglobin (p = 0.006 and p = 0.01, respectively) and serum folate concentrations (p = 0.03 and p = 0.02, respectively). CONCLUSIONS: Oxyntomodulin-like immunoreactivity is noticeably higher in healthy children than previously measured in healthy adult subjects. This hormonal parameter is not an adequate diagnostic tool in celiac disease. Nevertheless, in the context of celiac disease, its elevation reflects the degree of malabsorption and may provide a quantitative approach of the extent of mucosal damage.},

Activated protein C (APC) resistance is the most common inherited disorder leading to thrombosis and accounts for 30% to 40% of episodes of idiopathic venous thrombosis. METHODS: The prevalence of APC resistance was studied in 23 patients with IBD (17 with Crohn's disease, 6 with ulcerative colitis) and in 11 control subjects with recurrent abdominal pain or celiac disease, using an APC resistance screening method. RESULTS: One patient with Crohn's disease had a positive screen result, two patients (one with Crohn's, one with ulcerative colitis) had borderline results, and results in all of the control subjects were normal. One patient with Crohn's disease had a history of a thromboembolic event but had a normal screen result. CONCLUSIONS: Activated protein C resistance does not seem to play a major role in the etiology of the hypercoagulable state in inflammatory bowel disease.},

The prevalence rate has increased over the last decades and just 1/3 of cases are diagnosed in childhood. There is a striking association with class II histocompatibility antigens, HLA-DR3 and HLA-DQ2. Cellular immune response mediated by intraepithelial and lamina propria lymphocytes is the primary event in the small intestine damage. Up to 50% of adult coeliac patients don't present intestinal symptoms being more frequent subclinic forms. The immunological markers of coeliac disease are antigliadin, antireticulin and antiendomysial antibodies, being the last one the most specific. Mortality of coeliac patient is increased mainly for malignancies, being the most frequent the intestinal T lymphoma.},

   abstract = {BACKGROUND: The gluten-free diet is the standard therapy for patients affected by celiac disease, although compliance with the diet is not optimal in adolescents or adults. Moreover, the gluten-free diet may induce nutritional imbalances. METHODS: Alimentary habits and diet composition were examined in 47 adolescents with celiac disease and 47 healthy aged-matched control subjects. All subjects compiled a 3-day alimentary record that allowed determination of their energy intakes: the macronutrient composition of their diets; and their iron, calcium, and fiber intakes. To evaluate compliance with the gluten-free diet, immunoglobulin A antigliadin and antiendomysium antibodies were assessed in all with celiac disease. RESULTS: The analysis of the records and the results of antibody levels showed that 25 subjects strictly followed dietetic prescriptions (group 1A), whereas 22 patients consumed gluten-containing food (group 1B). Those with celiac disease and control subjects (group 2) consumed a normocaloric diet. Lipid and protein consumption was high, however, and the consumption of carbohydrates low. Moreover, dietary levels of calcium, fiber, and especially in girls, iron, were low. These nutritional imbalances were significantly more evident in group 1A than in group 1B, as a consequence of poor alimentary choices. Moreover, in group 1A overweight and obesity were more frequent (72%) than in group 1B (51%) and in the control subjects (47%). CONCLUSIONS: In people with celiac disease, adherence to a strict gluten-free diet worsens the already nutritionally unbalanced diet of adolescents, increasing elevated protein and lipid consumption. In the follow-up of patients with celiac disease, considerable effort has yet to be made to improve compliance with a gluten-free diet, and especially to control the nutritional balance of the diet in compliant patients.},

   abstract = {Important inroads are being made into understanding the pathophysiology of acute diarrhea. Clear understanding of key mechanisms should suggest new approaches to combat disease. Exciting developments are occurring in terms of super-ORS solutions, particularly with the promise of short-chained glucose polymers and glutamine. Perhaps the most important development is the prospect of a good rotavirus vaccine being available before the end of the decade. Chronic diarrhea seems to be on the increase globally, probably because of the success of ORS. The mechanisms that lead to mucosal injury are elusive and therapy is still largely supportive and empiric. Celiac disease continues to be a puzzle, not least because of the uncomfortable feeling that a majority of cases may be being missed because of atypical presentations. The successful use of long-term parenteral nutrition has allowed survival and better characterization of cases that otherwise would have perished as "lethal protracted diarrhea". Microvillus inclusion disease may be the most common congenital secretory diarrhea. The role of the recently reported high prevalence of glucoamylase deficiency may be important. Lastly attention to micronutrients, particularly low vitamin A and probably zinc, may prove to be important in prevention and amelioration of diarrhea and growth failure.},

Additional anomalies included cupped ears in 2 patients and one each with Dandy-Walker malformation with hydrocephaly, congenital cataracts, and peripheral pulmonary artery stenosis. The mothers of these 3 patients had chronic conditions associated with intestinal malabsorption requiring total parenteral nutrition for varying periods of time. The underlying causes of malabsorption were celiac disease, short bowel syndrome secondary to surgical resection, and jejuno-ileal bypass, respectively. Bleeding diathesis occurred in one mother requiring vitamin K supplementation during the second and third trimesters of pregnancy. We speculate that the chondrodysplasia punctata and other abnormalities in these children were caused by an acquired maternal vitamin K deficiency manifested during early pregnancy. However, the involvement of other vitamin deficiencies cannot be excluded. Thus, vitamin K deficiency of the embryo secondary to maternal malabsorption appears to be a third vitamin K-related mechanism leading to chondrodysplasia punctata in addition to warfarin embryopathy and epoxide reductase deficiency (pseudo-warfarin embryopathy).},

DESIGN: Study group consisted of 32 healthy full term infants of Estonian origin. SETTINGS: Study was carried out in Tartu University Women's Hospital and in Tartu University Children's Hospital. These are both primary care facilities. SUBJECTS: Infants were recruited to the study group according to their health parameters and parents agreement to take part of this study. Material of this article is based on one part of Estonian infants dietary habits investigation. RESULTS: The total amount of gluten containing cereals in Estonian infants diet was lower than in Sweden and Finland. We found that there is a certain parallelism between CD incidence and cereal intake. Wheat intake of Estonian infants was very close to Finnish infants, but almost twice lower than in Swedish infants. CONCLUSION: Data from the study is consistent with the hypothesis that gluten intake during infancy play role in development of CD. The quality of gluten-containing cereals may have important part in the development of the disease.},

In the present study we measured the bone mineral density (BMD) in children and adolescents at diagnosis of celiac disease and after approximately 1 y of a gluten-free diet. BMD was measured at the lumbar spine and in the whole skeleton by dual-energy X-ray absorptiometry in 44 celiac disease patients aged 2.58-20.42 y at diagnosis. BMD was also measured in a subset of 25 patients after 1.4 +/- 0.04 y of a gluten-free diet. BMD was compared with that of 177 healthy control subjects aged 1.52-20.99 y. Lumbar spine and whole-body BMD values at diagnosis of celiac disease were significantly lower than in control subjects (P = 0.015 and P = 0.0001, respectively) after differences in age and anthropomorphic variables were controlled for. The subjects studied after the gluten-free diet had BMD values not significantly different from those of control subjects. In conclusion, children and adolescents with celiac disease have remarkably reduced lumbar spine and whole-body bone density. A gluten-free diet promotes a rapid increase of BMD that leads to a complete recovery of bone mineralization. These results emphasize the need for an early diagnosis and treatment in patients with celiac disease to obtain an adequate peak bone mass at the end of puberty.},

Treatment of pancreatic steatorrhea is described. Throughout this study, we compared characteristics of maldigestion and malabsorption in these patient populations and our study revealed that fecal fat excretion reflected quantitative differences in fat consumption, plasma fatty acid profiles reflected quantitative and qualitative differences in fish oil consumption, and there were no differences in pancreatic exocrine dysfunction among these three groups. Since differences in fecal fat excretion and plasma fatty acid profiles appear to depend on dietary fats, the pathology and treatment of CP patients should be evaluated and the findings used to prescribe treatments.},

CASE REPORT: A 27-year-old female with a history of two episodes of small bowel ileus due to vascular causes presented with subacute pain in the left lower extremity. Angiography revealed a short segmental occlusion in the P III segment of the popliteal artery with small vessel collateralization and proximal occlusion of the superior mesenteric artery und the coeliac trunk. Vascular risk factors in this patient included smoking over a duration of 10 years, use of oral contraceptives (estrogen and gestagen combination) and elevated levels of homocysteine in the fasting state and after methionin loading. The patient was treated conservatively with intravenous application of prostaglandins, additionally she underwent training to improve her walking capability. After 4 weeks of the fasting state as well as after methionin loading were normalized by an oral substitution with folate and B vitamins. So far it was not possible to prove a genetic defect of the enzymes participating in the metabolism of homocysteine. CONCLUSION: This clinical conference of a young female patient with occlusion of several arteries illustrates the differential diagnosis of premature occlusive vascular disease with special regard to mild hyperhomocysteinemia as an independent risk factor.},

   abstract = {BACKGROUND: In patients with celiac disease, the occurrence of exocrine pancreatic insufficiency has been related to an impairment of the gut-mediated stimulatory effect of the meal on the pancreas. The purpose of this study was to assess the intraduodenal lipase activity in patients with celiac disease by means of the 13C mixed-triglyceride breath test and to monitor pancreatic function after the institution of a gluten-free diet. METHODS: Seventeen untreated patients with celiac disease (mean age, 17.4 +/- 10.5 years) were studied. After an overnight fast, patients were given a standard test meal consisting of 100 g of white bread and 0.25 g of butter per kilogram of body weight, to which 16 mg di-stearyl-13C-octanoyl-glyceride (mixed triglyceride) had been added. Breath samples were taken twice at baseline and at 30-minute intervals for 6 hours after the meal. 13C enrichment in breath was determined by means of Isotope Ratio Mass Spectrometer (IRMS) (ANCA-NT; Europa Scientific, Crewe, UK). Results were expressed as the maximum percentage of 13C recovery per hour at any time, the time to reach peak excretion of 13C, and the percentage of 13C cumulative dose over 6 hours. RESULTS: Mixed-triglyceride breath test results were pathologic in three patients and at the lower limit of the normal range in another patient. In the remaining 13 patients, the results were within normal values. At the 6- and 12-month follow-ups, all patients showed normal intraduodenal lipase activity. CONCLUSIONS: In approximately 24% of patients with celiac disease, the intraduodenal pancreatic lipolytic activity is impaired. The mixed-triglyceride breath test could be used to assess fat maldigestion and to monitor the need for enzyme replacement therapy in such patients.},

   abstract = {BACKGROUND: Bone metabolism may be disturbed in children with celiac disease. METHODS: Two markers of bone turnover were used: the level of osteocalcin (BGP) and the level of carboxylterminal peptide of type I procollagen (PICP). BGP and PICP were measured by radioimmunoassays in 18 untreated children with celiac disease (mean age: 22.9 +/- 15.6 months) and in 15 control subjects (mean age 28.5 +/- 21 months). All the patients were rechecked after 1 month and again after 3 months from beginning of a gluten-free diet (GFD). RESULTS: Compared with controls at diagnosis our patients had significantly lower serum levels of BGP and PICP (p = 0.003 and p = 0.018 by Student's t test, respectively). These levels increased markedly during the 1st 3 months of GFD. CONCLUSIONS: The alteration in calcium phosphate homeostasis caused by celiac disease directly affects the synthesis of both components of the connective matrix of bone. Measurements of BGP and PICP provide a reliable and rapidly obtainable index of normalization of the processes of bone growth which can be achieved with a GFD.},

RESULTS: The excretion of peptides increased compared with that in an age- and sex-matched reference group. CONCLUSIONS: Celiac patients have hyperpeptiduria. It is possible that some of these peptides are bioactive and may mediate varying systemic effects also found in untreated celiac disease.},

Increasing evidence indicates that prolactin also has an immunomodulatory influence on the immune system. The status of prolactin in patients with coeliac disease was investigated by obtaining serum samples from 48 patients with active and non-active coeliac disease. These were compared with samples from 20 children with familial Mediterranean fever and 65 normal controls. Serum prolactin in patients with active coeliac disease was significantly higher than in the other groups studied and reference values. Serum prolactin correlated well with the degree of mucosal atrophy and with the serum concentration of antiendomysial antibodies. Prolactin may play a part in immune modulation in the intestinal damage of coeliac disease and serve as a potential marker for disease activity.},

CD activity was assessed by intestinal biopsy to determine intestinal atrophy histologically and by measuring the level of antiendomysial antibody titer. TTR was measured in 26 CD patients fed a diet containing gluten and 22 CD patients fed a gluten-free diet. The control group was composed of 65 healthy sex- and age-matched children. We compared the TTR levels to the two established markers of CD activity. TTR levels were lowest among the celiac patients fed a diet containing gluten and differed significantly from those of the other two groups (r = 0.7, p < 0.002). The TTR levels correlated inversely with both the degree of mucosal atrophy (r = 0.6, p < 0.005) and with anti-endomysial antibody titers (p < 0.005). TTR levels appear to be correlated with morphologic and serologic markers of activity in celiac patients. TTR can be used as a systemic parameter in assessing celiac patients. It can contribute information to the evaluation of children in whom celiac disease is suspected, and it can monitor patients' diet compliance.},

   abstract = {BACKGROUND: Programmed cell death refers to the genetically determined processes by which cells die in response to physiologic extracellular and intracellular signals, morphologically described as apoptosis. In physiologic and pathologic circumstances this process may involve effector and target cells. METHODS: To identify serine esterase granules in intraepithelial lymphocytes, fresh-frozen human small intestine mucosal sections from normal and celiac-affected mucosa were incubated with substrate-specific N-alpha-benzyloxy-carbonyl-L-lysine thiobenzyl (BLT) and a chromogen (4 Benzoylamino-2,5-diethoxybenzene-dazonium chloride hemi [zinc chloride] salt as capture agent and were examined by light microscopy. RESULTS: Normal mucosa showed an occasional intraepithelial lymphocyte with BLT-positive intracytoplasmic granules. Some large mononuclear cells of the lamina propria were similarly stained. Many more intraepithelial lymphocytes were BLT-positive among the surface enterocytes of untreated celiac mucosa. Lamina propria mononuclear cells close to the basal layer of crypt cells also appeared to be increased. CONCLUSIONS: The histochemical identification of BLT-positive esters within intraepithelial lymphocytes suggests their involvement in enterocyte death under physiologic conditions. The increased BLT-positive intraepithelial lymphocytes found in the celiac mucosa may be related to the known increase in cytotoxic intraepithelial lymphocytes in untreated celiac disease.},

   abstract = {OBJECTIVES: This prospective study was designed to assess the nutritional changes associated with the long-term treatment of celiac disease. In addition, we analyzed whether these changes were related to the degree of compliance with a gluten-free diet. METHODS: We studied nutritional parameters and body composition in 25 newly diagnosed celiac patients after a mean period of 37 months (range 25-49 months) on a gluten-free diet. Body composition parameters (fat, lean tissue, and bone masses) were measured by dual energy x-ray absorptiometry. Anthropometry was measured according to conventional formulas. RESULTS: At diagnosis, fat (-49%), lean tissue (-12%), and bone (-24%) compartments were reduced, compared with that of sex- and age-matched controls. After treatment, we noted a significant increase in body weight (p < 0.0001), fat mass (p < 0.0005), bone mass (p < 0.002), and body mass index (p < 0.005). In contrast, we did not observe a significant increase in lean-tissue mass or muscle mass. Patients who adhered strictly to a gluten-free diet experienced a greater, though nonsignificant improvement in fat mass, body weight, and body mass index than patients whose compliance had been partial. Mean caloric intake at the end of the study was significantly lower among those patients who had adhered strictly to a gluten-free diet, compared with those who had complied only partially with the diet (p < 0.05). CONCLUSIONS: This study shows that the institution of a gluten-free diet in celiac disease patients results in a significant improvement in nutritional parameters, as measured by anthropometry and/or body composition. This effect was more pronounced in patients who followed strict gluten restriction and was related mainly to changes in fat and bone compartments.},

We sought to establish whether immunoglobulin (Ig) A class tissue transglutaminase autoantibodies can be considered specific for celiac disease. METHODS: Serum samples from 136 patients with untreated celiac disease (diagnosed according to the criteria of the European Society for Pediatric Gastroenterology, Hepatology and Nutrition) and 207 disease controls were studied. Enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay (ELISA) and Western blots were performed using calcium-treated and untreated tissue transglutaminase as antigen. Reticulin, endomysial, and mouse monoclonal tissue transglutaminase antibodies were studied by an indirect immunofluorescence method and gliadin antibodies with ELISA. RESULTS: The calcium-activated tissue transglutaminase autoantibody ELISA was highly sensitive (129 of 136) and specific (194 of 207) in detecting celiac disease. The new autoantibody ELISA test correlated well with the endomysial antibody test. Tissue transglutaminase autoantibody ELISA showed a clearly better predictive potential than the IgA class gliadin antibody ELISA. Immunoblots and ELISA blocking studies showed that calcium is needed for the specific antigen-antibody reaction to occur. Double immunofluorescence staining in human umbilical cord with sera from patients with celiac disease and with monoclonal tissue transglutaminase antibodies showed complete overlap. CONCLUSIONS: Calcium-activated tissue transglutaminase autoantibody ELISA is highly accurate in detecting untreated celiac disease. Tissue transglutaminase seems to be the target self-antigen for endomysial antibodies.},

Among human tissues, the umbilical cord also expresses these antigens. This study was conducted to compare different autoantibody tests and especially to elucidate whether human umbilical cord is a suitable substrate in tests and whether the cord jelly-derived fibroblasts express the antigens. METHODS: The indirect immunofluorescence method was used to detect the tissue and Wharton's jelly-derived fibroblast antibodies in 334 celiac disease and control sera samples. Affinity chromatography studies were used to show the correlation between human fibroblast-derived autoantigens and tissue and gliadin antibodies. The jelly-derived fibroblasts were used as antigen in a whole-cell enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay. RESULTS: Celiac disease patient sera showed IgA-class human umbilical cord antibody with high sensitivity (100%) and specificity (99%). All celiac disease patient sera tested showed in indirect immunofluorescence the molecules expressed by Wharton's jelly-derived fibroblasts. The whole-cell fibroblast autoantibody enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay had a sensitivity of 100% and a specificity of 81%. Human fibroblast-derived celiac disease autoantigens absorbed most of the IgA responsible for human umbilical cord antibodies but not the IgA responsible for gliadin antibodies in the same sera. CONCLUSIONS: Wharton's jelly-derived fibroblast autoantibodies tested in a novel whole-cell enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay correlated well with the human umbilical cord but not with gliadin antibodies.},

   abstract = {BACKGROUND: Celiac disease is characterized by morphologic and functional aberrations of the small intestinal mucosa, i.e., crypt hyperplasia, villous atrophy, infiltration of intraepithelial lymphocytes, and alteration of permeability. Nitric oxide has been shown to affect mucosal permeability after ischemia-reperfusion, but little is known about the regulatory role of nitric oxide in celiac disease. The purpose of this study was to assess nitric oxide production in children with celiac disease and in control subjects. METHODS: The sum of nitrite and nitrate in the urine was measured with a colorimetric method in 137 children with a median age of 3 years, 84 patients and 53 reference children, all of whom underwent a small intestinal biopsy to confirm or overrule suspicion of celiac disease. RESULTS: Median urinary nitrite-nitrate concentration in celiac children was 3323 microM (4147 +/- 1102; mean +/- SEM) at first clinical examination and 2501 microM (2939 +/- 386) after gluten challenge, which was significantly higher than concentrations in reference children (1029 microM; 1174 +/- 116) and in children with celiac disease on a gluten-free diet (882 microM; 1369 +/- 360) (p < 0.0001). CONCLUSIONS: A gluten-containing diet is associated with an increased nitrite-nitrate secretion in the urine in children with celiac disease, presumably as a result of nitric oxide synthase activation and nitric oxide production in the diseased small intestinal mucosa.},

   abstract = {BACKGROUND & AIMS: Nutrients and properties of lipases affect survival of lipolytic activity during aboral gastrointestinal transit. Whether different doses and formulations of bacterial lipase and diets affect steatorrhea was tested in pancreatic-insufficient dogs. METHODS: A dose of 0-600,000 IU of powdered and 135,000 and 300,000 IU of liquid bacterial lipase was given with a standard meal to 5 dogs with ligated pancreatic ducts. In 4 dogs, 0 or 300,000 IU (normal 6-hour postprandial amount) of powder bacterial lipase was also given with five meals containing 850 kcal with different nutrient caloric densities (mixture design). Coefficients of fat absorption during 72-hour fecal balance studies were used to assess treatments. RESULTS: With the standard meal, powder bacterial lipase reduced steatorrhea in a dose-dependent manner (P = 0.03), and 135,000 and 300,000 IU of the liquid form decreased steatorrhea more than powder bacterial lipase (P = 0.017 and 0.057, respectively). Coefficients of fat absorption with 300,000 IU of powder bacterial lipase correlated (r2 = 0.79; P < 0.001) with increasing proportions of fat calories in diets. CONCLUSIONS: Liquid bacterial lipase decreases steatorrhea more than powder, and 300,000 IU of powder bacterial lipase ingested with high-fat meals corrects canine pancreatic steatorrhea. The combination of adequate mixing of small amounts (milligrams) of bacterial lipase and high-fat meals abolishes canine steatorrhea and may abolish human pancreatic steatorrhea.},

   abstract = {Celiac disease is an intolerance to protein fractions in wheat, rye, barley, and possibly oats. When these grains are consumed by a person with celiac disease, they damage the mucosa of the small intestine, which eventually leads to malabsorption of nutrients. Patients are therefore advised to remove these grains from their diet, with lifelong adherence generally suggested. Although many dietitians and physicians consider this dietary prescription to be standard protocol, it is actually quite controversial. Whether oats can safely be consumed by persons with celiac disease has been debated since the gluten-free diet was first advocated more than 40 years ago. Historically, there have been several reasons for this debate, including the difficulty in identifying the precise amino acid sequence in gliadin that is responsible for toxicity; the differences in cereal chemistry between wheat and oats; and the lack of well-designed studies to assess the toxicity of oats. A growing body of evidence now suggests that moderate amounts of oats may be safely consumed by most adults with celiac disease. If further research continues to find no adverse effects from oat consumption, a consensus may emerge on the place of oats in the gluten-free diet. In the meantime, individual dietary prescriptions, routinely assessed for appropriateness using histologic and/or serologic studies, may be warranted to prevent unnecessary dietary restrictiveness and undesirable medical complications.},

   abstract = {Most children with cystic fibrosis (CF) show persisting steatorrhoea even when treated with pancreatic enzyme. As a low duodenal pH could be responsible for this persisting fat loss, we evaluated the effects of a proton-pump inhibitor (lansoprazole) on both steatorrhoea and growth parameters in 15 CF patients, aged 3.1-22.6 y. Acid steatocrit, anthropometry and dual-energy X-ray absorptiometry were used to evaluate steatorrhoea and the nutritional status before, during and 3 months after stopping lansoprazole treatment (15 mg/d for 3 months). Mean +/- SD acid steatocrit values decreased from 37.1 +/- 8.8% to 28.5 +/- 10.6% (p = 0.02). Significant mean Z-score improvements were found for weight (+0.14; p = 0.02), height (+0.15; p = 0.03), subscapular (+0.61; p = 0.003), supra-iliac (+0.8; p = 0.002) and the sum of the four measured skinfolds (+0.61; p = 0.002). Z-scores deteriorated again after stopping lansoprazole. Fat mass and bone mineral content increased significantly on lansoprazole (p = 0.008 and p = 0.005, respectively). We conclude that lansoprazole as adjuvant therapy significantly improves both steatorrhoea and the nutritional status in CF children who maintain steatorrhoea while on pancreatic enzymes.},

   abstract = {BACKGROUND: The association of celiac disease and insulin-dependent diabetes mellitus has been known for some time. In an attempt to clarify this association, the prevalence of celiac disease among diabetic children was determined, and the risk of insulin-dependent diabetes mellitus was defined in pediatric patients with celiac disease. METHODS: Ninety-three children with diabetes were analyzed for the presence of celiac disease-related markers (antigliadin and antiendomysial antibodies) and characteristic alterations in the intestinal mucosa. In another group, 93 children with celiac disease were screened for pancreatic autoantibodies and pancreatic beta-cell function. RESULTS: Among children with insulin-dependent diabetes mellitus, a 6.45% prevalence of celiac disease was observed, a value significantly higher than that found among healthy controls. In contrast, only three celiac disease patients showed potential autoimmunity toward the pancreatic beta cell, a proportion not significantly different from that in the general population. Additionally, no alteration of glucose metabolism was observed in the antibody-positive patients. CONCLUSION: The increased risk of celiac disease among patients with diabetes requires a long follow-up to determine the presence of celiac disease markers among patients with diabetes, to avoid potential malignant disease derived from untreated celiac disease. In contrast, there is no evidence to support an increased risk of insulin-dependent diabetes mellitus among children with celiac disease. In accordance with the accepted influence of diet in the development of autoimmune diabetes, a hypothetical mechanism of protection against insulin-dependent diabetes mellitus that is mediated by environmental factors related to restricted diet is suggested in this population.},

   abstract = {BACKGROUND: Literature information regarding clinical and histological correlates in celiac disease is limited. The present study was designed to assess the value of various clinical parameters in predicting the severity of small bowel histopathology. METHODS: Small bowel biopsy specimens of 59 children with established celiac disease (ESPGAN criteria) were evaluated blindly. Morphology was evaluated based on a common histopathology score. The following clinical variables were evaluated: age at diagnosis, duration of symptoms, severity score of clinical symptoms, severity score of physical signs, and growth parameters (height and weight Z scores). Multiple regression analysis was performed to evaluate the relative importance of each clinical parameter. RESULTS: Only three clinical variables revealed a significant correlation with the histopathology score. The symptom severity score (t = 3.883, p = 0.0003) demonstrated a positive correlation. The two others, age at diagnosis (t = 3.076, p = 0.0032) and duration of symptoms (t = -2.987, p = 0.0041), revealed a negative correlation. CONCLUSIONS: We conclude that more severe clinical symptoms of a shorter duration, presented at a younger age, are better predictors of a more severe form of small bowel histopathology in children with celiac disease.},

   abstract = {It has been reported that hyperglycemia in the portal venous blood suppresses afferent activity of the hepatic branch of the vagus nerve, which in turn accelerates efferent activity of the pancreatic branch of the vagus nerve to stimulate insulin secretion. The present study examined this neural control mechanism in genetically obese diabetic male Wistar fatty (fa/fa) rats. Adult (aged 12 to 14 weeks) Wistar fatty rats were obese, hyperinsulinemic, and hyperglycemic. Young (aged 5 to 6 weeks) Wistar fatty rats were slightly obese and hyperinsulinemic, but were euglycemic compared with the lean littermates. In both adult and young lean littermates, the plasma insulin response after an intragastric glucose load (1 g/kg) was diminished by intracerebroventricular (i.c.v.) atropine methylbromide (methylatropine 10 nmol) pretreatment, and a transient increase in plasma insulin was observed after selective hepatic vagotomy, as reported in normal rats. In contrast, in both adult and young Wistar fatty rats, the plasma insulin response after an intragastric glucose load was not diminished by i.c.v. methylatropine pretreatment, and plasma insulin decreased slightly after selective hepatic vagotomy. Further, afferent discharges of the hepatic vagal branch decreased and efferent discharges of the celiac/pancreatic vagal branch increased when 10 mg glucose was infused into the portal vein in the 9-week-old lean littermates, as reported in normal rats. In 7-week-old Wistar fatty rats, afferent discharges of the hepatic vagal branch decreased but efferent discharges of the celiac/pancreatic vagal branch did not increase after intraportal glucose infusion. It is concluded that the vagus nerve-mediated regulation of insulin secretion is impaired from an early stage of life in Wistar fatty rats. Efferent discharges of the vagus nerve to the pancreas seem not to be suppressed by afferent discharges from the hepatic vagus branch, which may lead to insufficient insulin secretion in response to nutrient ingestion followed by a delayed peak. These abnormalities may thus lead to the insulin resistance and fasting hyperinsulinemia that characterize the Wistar fatty rat model.},
