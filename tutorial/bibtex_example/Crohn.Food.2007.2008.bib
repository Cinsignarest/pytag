   abstract = {Patients who respond to infliximab enjoy many benefits, including improvement in clinical symptoms, less disability, and a better quality of life. Unfortunately, many patients are unresponsive to infliximab therapy. They may be completely refractory to infliximab therapy (ie, primary nonresponders), they may have shown an initial response to therapy that subsequently diminished, or they may be hypersensitive to the drug. For these patients, second-generation tumor necrosis factor (TNF) inhibitors will soon be available; adalimumab and certolizumab pegol are the two agents most likely to gain Food and Drug Administration approval for the treatment of Crohn's disease. This article looks at recent studies using these newer TNF inhibitors in patients in whom infliximab treatment has failed as well as in those who have never received infliximab.},

   abstract = {The idiopathic inflammatory bowel diseases, broadly classified as either Crohn's disease or ulcerative colitis, are caused by a dysregulated mucosal immune response to a luminal antigen, possibly a bacterium, in a genetically predisposed host. A rapid expansion of knowledge in recent years has greatly increased our understanding of the pathophysiology of these disorders. For example, the relatively recent discovery of the NOD2 gene, a protein involved in bacterial sensing, has provided further evidence of the complex interplay between hosts and microbes in Crohn's disease. Significant recent advances have also occurred with the discovery of the role of Toll-like receptors and dendritic cells in the development of gut inflammation, and the role of proinflammatory cytokines in the development and potentiation of gut inflammation. This article presents an update on these key developments and emphasizes the translational aspects of research that are directly related to patient care.},

   abstract = {Similarities between Johne's disease in ruminants and Crohn's disease in humans have led to speculation that Mycobacterium avium paratuberculosis (MAP) might be a causative agent in Crohn's disease. However, evidence remains inconsistent. In this case-control study (1999-2004), the authors assessed the possible role of drinking water and dairy products potentially contaminated with MAP in the etiology of Crohn's disease. A total of 218 patients with Crohn's disease recruited from nine hospitals in England and 812 controls recruited from the community completed a short questionnaire for evaluation of proxy measures of potential exposure to MAP. Logistic regression showed no significant association with measures of potential contamination of water sources with MAP, water intake, or water treatment. Multivariate analysis showed that consumption of pasteurized milk (per kg/month: odds ratio (OR) = 0.82, 95% confidence interval (CI): 0.69, 0.97) was associated with a reduced risk of Crohn's disease. Meat intake (per kg/month: OR = 1.40, 95% CI: 1.17, 1.67) was associated with a significantly increased risk of Crohn's disease, whereas fruit consumption (per kg/month: OR = 0.78, 95% CI: 0.67, 0.92) was associated with reduced risk. This study does not support a role for water or dairy products potentially contaminated with MAP in the etiology of Crohn's disease. The observed association with meat and the negative association with pasteurized milk need further study.},

This study investigated the adequacy of dietary intake, based on the Canadian Dietary Reference Intake, in ambulatory patients with Crohn's disease and a normal body mass index (BMI; calculated as kg/m(2)). This was a cross-sectional study of 74 patients with mean age of 35.7+/-1.4 years and BMI of 23.05+/-0.45. All patients completed a 7-day food record and a diary for the Crohn's Disease Activity Index. Mean Crohn's Disease Activity Index was 138.99+/-11.38. Energy and protein intakes were within the recommended levels of intake, but total carbohydrates, fat, and saturated fat intake exceeded the recommended levels of <55%, <35%, and <10% in 39.2%, 27%, and 59.5% of the patients, respectively. Micronutrient intakes were suboptimal most notably for folate, vitamins C, E, and calcium. There were no substantial differences between patients with active and inactive disease in terms of failure to meet the Dietary Reference Intake. In conclusion, in this population sample, a large number of ambulatory patients with Crohn's disease have suboptimal dietary patterns despite a normal BMI and inactive disease. Dietary counseling and supplementation may be warranted in this patient population.},

A number of interventions are currently used in clinical practice to try and maintain remission in Crohn's disease but the evidence base for some of them may be questionable. AIM: To review the available evidence on interventions, which are currently used to maintain remission in Crohn's disease. METHODS: The Cochrane Library and Medline (Pubmed) were searched for level 1 evidence on specific interventions. Search terms included 'Crohn's disease or synonyms', 'remission or synonyms' and the names of specific interventions. RESULTS: Azathioprine, infliximab and adalimumab are effective at maintaining remission in Crohn's disease. Natalizumab is also effective, but there are concerns about its potential association with progressive multifocal leukoencephalopathy. Long-term enteral nutritional supplementation, enteric-coated omega-3 fatty acids and intramuscular methotrexate may also be effective but the evidence for these is based on relatively small studies. The available evidence does not support the use of oral 5-aminosalicylates agents, corticosteroids, anti-mycobacterial agents, probiotics or ciclosporin as maintenance therapy in Crohn's disease. CONCLUSION: A better understanding of the evidence base of existing interventions could result in the use of treatments, which are more likely to lead to improved patient outcomes.},

   abstract = {BACKGROUND: Prevention of relapse is a major issue in the management of Crohn's disease. Corticosteroids and 5-ASA preparations are not effective for the maintenance of remission. Methotrexate, infliximab, 6-mercaptopurine and its prodrug, azathioprine may be effective in maintaining remission, but these drugs may cause significant adverse events. OBJECTIVES: To conduct a systematic review to evaluate the efficacy of enteral nutrition for the maintenance of remission in Crohn's disease. SEARCH STRATEGY: MEDLINE (1966 to January 2007), EMBASE (1984 to January 2007) the Cochrane Central Register of Controlled Trials from the Cochrane Library (Issue 4, 2006) and the IBD/FBD Review Group Specialized Trials Register were searched. The articles cited in each publication were hand searched. SELECTION CRITERIA: Randomised controlled trials which compared enteral nutrition with no intervention, placebo or with any other intervention were eligible for inclusion. DATA COLLECTION AND ANALYSIS: Data extraction and assessment of methodological quality of included studies were independently performed by two authors. The main outcome measure was the occurrence of clinical or endoscopic relapse as defined by the primary studies. Odds ratios and 95% confidence intervals were calculated for dichotomous outcomes. MAIN RESULTS: Two studies were identified that met the inclusion criteria and were included in the review. Statistical pooling of the results of these studies was not possible because the control interventions, and the way outcomes were assessed differed greatly between the two studies. In one study (Takagi 2006), patients who received half of their total daily calorie requirements as elemental diet and the remaining half by normal diet had a significantly lower relapse rate compared to patients who received unrestricted normal diet (9 of 26 versus 16 of 25; OR 0.3, 95% CI 0.09 to 0.94). In the other study (Verma 2001), elemental and polymeric feeds (providing between 35 and 50% of patients' pretrial calorie intake in addition to unrestricted normal food) were equally effective for maintenance of remission and allowing withdrawal of steroid therapy (8 of 19 versus 6 of 14; OR 0.97, 95% CI 0.24 to 3.92). AUTHORS' CONCLUSIONS: The available evidence suggests that supplementary enteral nutritional may be effective for maintenance of remission in Crohn's disease. Whilst larger studies are needed to confirm these findings, enteral nutritional supplementation could be considered as an alternative or as an adjunct to maintenance drug therapy in Crohn's disease.},

   abstract = {Populations in high infectious exposure countries are at low risk of some immune-mediated diseases such as Crohn's disease and allergy. This low risk is maintained upon immigration to an industrialized country, but the offspring of such immigrants have a higher immune-mediated disease risk than the indigenous population. We hypothesize that early life exposures in a developing country shape the maternal immune system, which could have implications for the offspring born in a developed country with a low infectious load. The aim of this study was to investigate if exposures in childhood (indicated by country of origin) and subsequent exposures influence immunologic characteristics relevant to stimulation of offspring. Breast milk components among 64 mothers resident in Sweden, 32 of whom immigrated from a developing country, were examined using the ELISA and Cytometric Bead Array methods. Immigrants from a developing country had statistically significantly higher levels of breast milk interleukin-6 (IL-6), IL-8 and transforming growth factor-beta1. A larger number of previous pregnancies were associated with down-regulation of several substances, statistically significant for soluble CD14 and IL-8. The results suggest that maternal country of birth may influence adult immune characteristics, potentially relevant to disease risk in offspring. Such a mechanism may explain the higher immune-mediated disease risk among children of migrants from a developing to developed country. Older siblings may influence disease risk through the action of previous pregnancies on maternal immune characteristics.},

   abstract = {BACKGROUND AND OBJECTIVES: The role of dietary factors in the etiology of Crohn's disease (CD) is inconsistent largely due to difficulties in acquiring valid information on consumption habits. We examined the impact of diet on new onset CD in children using a validated food-frequency questionnaire (FFQ). METHODOLOGY: A case-control study was carried out. Children < or =20 yr, newly diagnosed with CD, were recruited from 3 pediatric gastroenterology clinics across Canada. Population or hospital controls were selected matched to cases for time of diagnosis (+/-6 months) and area of residence. Dietary consumption 1 yr prior to disease diagnosis was evaluated using a validated FFQ, administered within 1 month of diagnosis. Conditional logistic regression analysis adjusting for potential confounding variables (energy intake, age, gender, body mass index) was carried out. RESULTS: A total of 130 CD patients and 202 controls were studied. Mean age at diagnosis (+/-SD) was 14.2 (2.7). There were more male patients (59%). Comparing the highest to the lowest levels of consumption, higher amounts of vegetables (OR 0.69, 95% CI 0.33-1.44, P= 0.03), fruits (OR 0.49, 95% CI 0.25-0.96, P= 0.02), fish (OR 0.46, 95% CI 0.20-1.06, P= 0.02), and dietary fiber (OR 0.12, 95% CI 0.04-0.37, P < 0.001) protected from CD. Consumption of long-chain omega-3 fatty acids (LCN-omega-3) was negatively associated with CD (OR 0.44, 95% CI 0.19-1.00, P < 0.001). A higher ratio of LCN-omega-3/omega-6 fatty acids was significantly associated with lower risks for CD (OR 0.32, 95% CI 0.14-0.71, P= 0.02). CONCLUSIONS: Our findings indicate that an imbalance in consumption of fatty acids, vegetables, and fruits is associated with increased risks for CD among Canadian children.},

An ulcerative lesion in the third portion of the duodenum was revealed during duodenoscopy, with a diagnosis of adenocarcinoma on biopsy specimen histology. The patient underwent a partial pancreatoduodenectomy. No adjuvant therapy was instituted and follow-up is negative for local recurrence or metastases 21 months postoperatively. CONCLUSION: CREST syndrome has been associated with colon cancer, gastric polyps, familial adenomatous polyposis (FAP) syndrome and Crohn's disease; however, this is the first report of a primary adenocarcinoma of the duodenum in a patient with CREST syndrome. However, any etiologic relationship remains to be further investigated.},

   abstract = {BACKGROUND & AIMS: Elemental diet (ED) is effective for human Crohn's disease (CD). Although some of this effectiveness may be due to its low antigenic load and low fat content, the mechanisms remain unclear. We sought to assess the role of histidine, one of the constituent amino acids of ED, in controlling colitis. METHODS: The interleukin (IL)-10-deficient (IL-10(-/-)) cell transfer model of colitis was used. SCID mice with colitis induced by transfer of IL-10(-/-) cells were maintained on experimented diets containing either single amino acids or a mixture. The severity of colitis was assessed by wet colon weight. Colonic tumor necrosis factor (TNF)-alpha messenger RNA (mRNA) expression was detected by quantitative reverse-transcription polymerase chain reaction. Mouse peritoneal macrophages were stimulated by lipopolysaccharides (LPS), with or without amino acids. The concentration of cytokines in the supernatant was determined by enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay. Inhibitor of nuclear factor (NF)-kappaB-alpha and nuclear p65 were confirmed by immunoblotting. RESULTS: In the IL-10(-/-) transfer model, dietary histidine, but not alanine, reduced histologic damage and colon weight and TNF-alpha mRNA expression. Histidine inhibited LPS-induced TNF-alpha and IL-6 production by mouse macrophages in a concentration-dependent manner, whereas alanine or histidine-related metabolites had no such effect. Histidine inhibited LPS-induced NF-kappaB in macrophages. CONCLUSIONS: These results showed that histidine could be a novel therapeutic agent for CD by inhibition of NF-kappaB activation, following down-regulation of proinflammatory cytokine production by macrophages. Thus, our studies provided new insights into the roles of amino acid metabolism in the pathophysiology of CD and for therapeutic strategies.},

   abstract = {The pathogenesis of Crohn's disease (CD) and ulcerative colitis (UC) is not fully understood. The interaction between intestinal environmental factors of food and intestinal microbes and the immunological system of hosts seems to be an important aspect. We have reviewed the relationship of the daily consumption of dietary animal meat and fats, dairy products, sugar, and other factors that may be linked to the occurrence of CD and UC from the literature and Japanese epidemiological data. In the present study, we reviewed the association between food and intestinal microbes and other factors contributing to the occurence of inflammatory bowel disease (IBD) from epidemiological data and case-control studies of IBD in the literature that appeared on Medline, and assessed the reports of intestinal microbes involved in the occurrence of IBD. We found several papers describing the positive association of animal meat and sweets and sugar with the occurrence of CD and UC. An analysis of Japanese epidemiological data suggested that the registered number of patients with CD or UC started to increase more than 20 years after an increased daily consumption of dietary animal meat and fats, and milk and dairy products, and after a decreased consumption of rice. Many studies implied a positive role of intestinal microbes in the occurrence of IBD. Intestinal environmental factors, such as Westernized food and intestinal microbes, seem to be involved in the increased occurrence of IBD.},

   abstract = {Apart from genetic and environmental factors, the mucosal immune system of the gut plays a central role in the pathogenesis of inflammatory bowel disease (IBD). In the healthy gut, the mucosal immune system ensures the balance between pro- and anti-inflammatory mediators and thereby allows an effective defence against luminal pathogens but at the same time prevents an overwhelming immune reaction directed against the huge amount of harmless luminal antigens (for example, components of food or nonpathological bacteria). In both entities of IBD (Crohn's disease and ulcerative colitis) this immunological balance is severely impaired and shifted towards the pro-inflammatory side. The chronic mucosal inflammation in IBD is caused by hyperactivation of effector immune cells, which produce high levels of pro-inflammatory cytokines like tumour necrosis factor-alpha, interleukin-6 and interferon-gamma, resulting in colonic tissue damage. The nuclear transcription factor kappaB (NF-kappaB) was identified as one of the key regulators in this immunological setting. Its activation is markedly induced in IBD patients and through its ability to promote the expression of various pro-inflammatory genes, NF-kappaB strongly influences the course of mucosal inflammation. Considering the different cell-type specific effects which are mediated by NF-kappaB, this review aims at describing the complex role of NF-kappaB in IBD and discusses existing pharmacological attempts to block the activation of NF-kappaB to develop new therapeutic strategies in IBD.},

   abstract = {PURPOSE OF REVIEW: Though long hypothesized, the putative link between Mycobacterium avium paratuberculosis and Crohn's disease remains neither confirmed nor refuted. This article reviews published contributions that directly or indirectly address this question. RECENT FINDINGS: Epidemiologic studies, looking for M. avium paratuberculosis DNA in Crohn's tissue, show a strong association between the agent and this disease. Supporting data, however, are presently inconclusive on a causal role. Genetic studies provide indirect support for a role of mycobacteria in Crohn's disease, by identifying susceptibility genes that encode proteins implicated in innate immunity to intracellular bacteria. Clinical trial data support at least a short-term benefit for antimycobacterial therapy in Crohn's disease, but the microbial specificity of this response is presently unknown. SUMMARY: There appears to be a strong association between M. avium paratuberculosis and Crohn's disease, but the causality of this association is unknown. Consequently, the therapeutic implications of this association require further study. A number of critical questions about the biology of M. avium paratuberculosis remain unanswered. Data from studies of this organism, and its interaction with the immune system, can help address proposed reasons for or against a role of M. avium paratuberculosis in the etiology of Crohn's disease.},

It is important to understand the genetics, various clinical presentations, comorbidities, and treatment options associated with psoriasis. RECENT FINDINGS: The human leukocyte antigen-C gene likely contains a susceptibility locus for psoriasis. Cytokines interleukin-12 and interleukin-23 have been implicated in the pathogenesis of psoriasis as well. Psoriasis is likely associated with an increased risk of myocardial infarction, metabolic syndrome, Crohn's disease, and depression; it is difficult to assess the implications in the adolescent population. SUMMARY: Psoriasis is not rare in the adolescent population. It is important for physicians to be aware of the different clinical presentations as well as the spectrum of treatment options that are available.},

   abstract = {AIM: To investigate the effect of a new oral preparation, highly concentrated in fish cartilage, in a group of inflammatory bowel diseases (IBD) patients with chronic iron deficient anemia. METHODS: In an open label pilot study, we supple-mented a group of 25 patients (11 with Crohn's disease and 14 with ulcerative colitis) in stable clinical conditions and chronic anemia with a food supplement which does not contain iron but contains a standardized fraction of fish cartilage glycosaminoglycans and a mixture of antioxidants (Captafer Medestea, Turin, Italy). Patients received 500 mg, twice a day during meals, for at least 4 mo. Patients were suggested to maintain their alimentary habit. At time 0 and after 2 and 4 mo, emocrome, sideremia and ferritin were examined. Paired data were analyzed with Student's t test. RESULTS: Three patients relapsed during the study (2 in the 3rd mo, 1 in the 4th mo), two patients were lost to follow up and two patients dropped out (1 for orticaria, 1 for gastric burning). Of the remaining 18 patients, levels of serum iron started to rapidly increase within the 2nd mo of treatment, P < 0.05), whereas serum ferritin and hemoglobin needed a longer period to significantly improve their serum levels (mo 4) P < 0.05. The product was safe, easy to administer and well tolerated by patients. CONCLUSION: These data suggest a potential new treatment for IBD patients with iron deficiency chronic anemia and warrant further larger controlled studies.},

   abstract = {BACKGROUND AND AIM: Malnutrition is a common feature in patients with Crohn's disease (CD), which leads to frequent infections and poor prognosis. In view of the rising incidence of CD in India we planned this study to assess the nutritional status of patients with CD. METHODS: Nutritional status of 112 patients (mean age 35.9 [SD 11.7] years; 61 men) with CD was assessed by anthropometric, dietary and biochemical parameters. Patients were considered malnourished if 3 or more anthropometric parameters (% ideal body weight [IBW], % tricep skin fold [TSF], %mid upper arm circumference [MUAC], and % mid arm muscle circumference [MAMC], body mass index [BMI]) were abnormal. Dietary intake was assessed by a 24-hour dietary recall along with a semi-quantitative food frequency method. Eighty volunteers were taken as healthy controls (HC). RESULTS: At the time of assessment, 77 patients were in remission and 35 had active disease. The values of BMI, MUAC, TSF and mid arm fat area (MAFA) in patients were significantly lower than those in healthy controls. MAMC and mid arm muscle area (MAMA) of patients and controls were comparable. TSF (Rem vs HC = 10.4 [2.8-71] vs 16 [3-41]) and MAFA (Rem vs HC = 1236 [240-7757] vs 1858 [322-5650]) of the patients in the remission phase were significantly lower than those of healthy controls; the remaining parameters were comparable. There was no difference in the dietary intake of patients in the remission and active phases, and healthy controls. The percentage energy fulfillment of the patients was lower than that of healthy controls. Twenty-nine of 35 (82.8%) patients in the active and 30 of 77 (38.9%) patients in the remission phase were malnourished (OR 7.5, 95% CI 2.8-20.4). The overall prevalence of malnutrition was 52.6% among patients. CONCLUSION: The percentage of malnourished patients in the active and remission phases of the disease was 82.8% and 38.9%, respectively, possibly due to low percentage energy fulfillment.},

Biopsy-associated bacteria are assumed to be particularly relevant in bacteriological investigations of IBD because they are assumed to be located on the mucosal surface and hence close to immunological cells. This investigation analysed the bacterial collections associated with bowel biopsies, aspirates of residual fluid after bowel cleansing and faeces from IBD patients and non-IBD subjects in Edmonton, Canada, and Mexico City, Mexico. Temporal temperature gradient gel electrophoresis of 16S rRNA gene sequences produced profiles of the bacterial collections and their similarities were compared. Similarity analysis showed that the profiles did not cluster according to disease status, but that Canadian and Mexican profiles could be differentiated by this method. Comparison of biopsy, aspirate and faecal samples obtained from the same subject showed that, on average, the profiles were highly similar. Therefore, biopsy-associated bacteria are likely to represent, at least in part, contaminants from the fluid, which resembles a faecal solution, that pools in the bowel after cleansing prior to endoscopy.},

   abstract = {Several biologic agents have been assessed in patients with inflammatory bowel disease (IBD; Crohn's disease [CD] and ulcerative colitis [UC]). Until recently, only infliximab (humanized monoclonal anti-TNF-alpha antibody) had been approved by the Food and Drug Administration (FDA) to induce and maintain remission in patients with active mild to moderate and/or fistulizing Crohn's disease who are refractory to conventional therapy. Two recent trials, ACT 1 and ACT2, observed high efficacy of infliximab in inducing and maintaining clinical remission, mucosal healing, and corticosteroid-sparing effects in patients with moderate to severe UC. This agent also was recently approved by the FDA for the treatment of ulcerative colitis to reduce signs and symptoms, to induce clinical remission and healing of the intestinal mucosa, and to eliminate the use of corticosteroids in patients with moderately to severely active UC who have had an inadequate response to conventional therapy. There have been many randomized, double-blind, controlled and open-label uncontrolled studies of large and small numbers of patients assessing the efficacy and safety of various biologic agents considered potentially useful in the treatment of IBD. Among all the biologic agents, infliximab has the most robust data on safety. This is because it has been evaluated in many more trials than has any other biologic agent. In addition, postmarketing experience provides very valuable information about adverse events occurring during treatment with this agent.},

The purpose of this review is to discuss recent data bearing on the possible mechanisms of action of these bacteria, with a particular focus on the relation of these mechanisms to the pathogenesis of inflammatory bowel disease, their main arena of use. RECENT FINDINGS: Studies of probiotic activity in recent years provide evidence that probiotics counter experimental and human gastrointestinal inflammation (human inflammatory bowel disease) by their effects on epithelial cell function, including epithelial cell barrier function, epithelial cytokine secretion, and their antibacterial effects relating to colonization of the epithelial layer. In addition, there is emerging evidence that probiotics induce regulatory T cells that act as a break on the effector T cells that would otherwise cause inflammation. SUMMARY: This review of probiotics and inflammatory bowel disease marshals support for the concept that administration of probiotics ameliorates inflammation by exerting positive effects on the epithelial cell dysfunction and mucosal immune system dysfunction that forms the basis of the inflammation.},

   abstract = {Carrageenan is a high molecular weight sulfated polygalactan used to improve the texture of commercial food products. Its use increased markedly during the last half century, although carrageenan is known to induce inflammation in rheumatological models and in intestinal models of colitis. We performed studies to determine its direct effects on human intestinal cells, including normal human intestinal epithelial cells from colonic surgeries, the normal intestinal epithelial cell line NCM460, and normal rat ileal epithelial cells. Cells were treated with high molecular weight lambda-carrageenan at a concentration of 1 mug/ml for 1-96 h. IL-8, IL-8 promoter activity, total and nuclear NF-kappaB, IkappaBalpha, phospho-IkappaBalpha, and Bcl10 were assessed by immunohistochemistry, Western blot, ELISA, and cDNA microarray. Increased Bcl10, nuclear and cytoplasmic NF-kappaB, IL-8 promoter activation, and IL-8 secretion were detected following carrageenan exposure. Knockdown of Bcl10 by siRNA markedly reduced the increase in IL-8 that followed carrageenan exposure in the NCM460 cells. These results show, for the first time, that exposure of human intestinal epithelial cells to carrageenan triggers a distinct inflammatory pathway via activation of Bcl10 with NF-kappaB activation and upregulation of IL-8 secretion. Since Bcl10 contains a caspase-recruitment domain, similar to that found in NOD2/CARD15 and associated with genetic predisposition to Crohn's disease, the study findings may represent a link between genetic and environmental etiologies of inflammatory bowel disease. Because of the high use of carrageenan as a food additive in the diet, the findings may have clinical significance.},

It is known that T and B cells of patients with Crohn's disease can be stimulated with the yeast antigen, mannan. We evaluated the impact of eating habits with special respect to food containing yeast on the course of inflammatory bowel disease. METHODS: Questionnaires were sent to 180 German-speaking patients of the Inflammatory Bowel Disease Outpatient Clinic at the University Hospital Bern, Switzerland. The following information was obtained by the questionnaires: (1) course of disease, (2) eating habits, (3) environmental data, and (4) inflammatory bowel disease questionnaire. The survey was anonymous. RESULTS: A total of 145 patients (80.5 percent 95 with Crohn's disease, and 50 with ulcerative colitis) responded. Food items containing yeast were better tolerated by patients with ulcerative colitis than by patients with Crohn's disease. A significant difference between the two groups was observed concerning food containing raw yeast (dough, P = 0.04; and pastry, P = 0.001). CONCLUSIONS: Food items containing raw yeast led to more frequent problems for patients with Crohn's disease than for patients with ulcerative colitis. This observation supports our previous data, which showed the stimulatory effect of the yeast antigen, mannan, on B and T cells of patients with Crohn's disease but not of controls.},

   abstract = {Fermented foods have been used since prehistoric times. Their number, variety and geographic origin are considerable, and different substrates and agents including bacteria, yeasts and moulds have been used in their preparation. In the last few decades the scientific approach to the study of the participating microorganisms and the resulting products have provided a better understanding of their biological importance. Among the many health-related properties of fermented foods, effects on blood pressure have been described after casein hydrolysis by lactic acid bacteria. Peptides with antimicrobial activity, mainly against Gram-negative bacteria, and derived from casein have also been identified. This could explain, at least in part, the antidiarrheal effects of fermented products including those on traveler's diarrhea and against colonization by Helicobacter pylori. One of the best known advantages of fermented milk products is their capacity to improve lactose tolerance in hypolactasic subjects. With the growing prevalence of allergies and inflammatory bowel diseases, considerable interest has been focused on the effects of lactic acid bacteria in these conditions; there is evidence that these agents are associated with improvements in allergy; no such evidence exists for Crohn's disease or ulcerative colitis. A cholesterol-lowering capacity has also been described for some microorganisms. Not all the fermenting microorganisms have probiotic capacities as the latter are strain-specific.},

   abstract = {OBJECTIVE AND DESIGN: Western diets regularly expose the gastrointestinal tract (GI) to large quantities ( > 10(12)/day) of man-made, submicron-sized, particles derived from food additives and excipients. These are taken up by M cells, accumulate in gut macrophages, and may influence the aetiology of inflammatory bowel diseases (IBD). MATERIALS: We investigated the effects of common dietary microparticles on the function of macrophages from healthy donors or active Crohn's disease (CD) patients. METHODS: Macrophages were incubated for 24 h with microparticles before being assayed for cytokine production and phagocytic activity. RESULTS: Microparticles alone were non-stimulatory but, in the presence of bacterial antigens such as LPS, they could act as adjuvants to induce potent cytokine responses. Uptake of high concentrations of microparticles also impaired macrophage phagocytic capacity - but not their ability - to take up 2microM fluorescent beads. CONCLUSIONS: While dietary microparticles alone have limited effects on basic macrophage functions, their ability to act as adjuvants could aggravate ongoing inflammatory responses towards bacterial antigens in the GI tract.},

   abstract = {BACKGROUND: Crohn's disease has a high morbidity and there is no known cure. Current treatments have multiple side effects and an effective treatment with minimal side effects is desired. Probiotics have been proposed as such a treatment but their efficacy is undetermined. There is some evidence that probiotics are effective in other conditions affecting the gastrointestinal tract and they are popular with patients. They are thought to work through competitive action with commensal and pathogenic flora, influencing the immune response. OBJECTIVES: To determine if there is any evidence for the efficacy of probiotics for the induction of remission in Crohn's disease. SEARCH STRATEGY: The Cochrane Central Register of Controlled Trials (CENTRAL) (Issue 1, 2007), MEDLINE (1966 to 2007), Excerpta Medica/EMBASE (1974 to 2007), CINAHL (1982-2007) and the Cochrane Inflammatory Bowel Disease and Functional Bowel Disorders Group Specialised Trial Register were searched. Manufacturers of probiotics were also contacted to identify any unpublished trials. References of trials were also searched for any additional trials. SELECTION CRITERIA: Randomised controlled trials (RCTs) that compared probiotics against placebo or any other intervention for the induction of remission in Crohn's disease were eligible for inclusion. DATA COLLECTION AND ANALYSIS: Data extraction and assessment of methodological quality of included studies were independently performed by two authors. The main outcome measure was the occurrence of clinical remission. Odds ratios and 95% confidence intervals were calculated for dichotomous outcomes. MAIN RESULTS: One small study (n = 11) met the inclusion criteria and was included in the review. There were some methodological concerns with this study. Four of 5 patients in the probiotic group achieved remission compared to 5 of 6 in the placebo group (OR 0.80; 95% CI 0.04 to 17.20). AUTHORS' CONCLUSIONS: There is insufficient evidence to make any conclusions about the efficacy of probiotics for induction of remission in Crohn's disease. There is a lack of well designed RCTs in this area and further research is needed.},

   abstract = {Complications of Crohn's disease (CD) lead to surgery in about 70-90% of patients. The majority of patients suffer from relapse of the disease. Colonic bacteria are essential to the development of CD. Therefore, a rationale exists in trying to prevent relapse by manipulation of gut microflora. This is feasible by treatment with probiotics or antibiotics. Synbiotic 2000 is a cocktail containing 4 probiotic species and 4 prebiotics. It is rational to pursue that it could be effective in preventing postoperative disease. We sought to check weather treatment with Synbiotic 2000 could prevent postoperative recurrence in patients with CD. This was a prospective multicenter, randomized study. Patients were randomized to active treatment or placebo in a 2:1 ratio. Follow-up consisted of endoscopic, clinical, and laboratory parameters. Thirty patients were enrolled. No differences were found between the 2 treatment groups regarding gender, age at diagnosis, age at surgery, weight, smoking status, type of disease, length of the resected segment, or medical treatment prior to surgery. No difference in either endoscopic or clinical relapse rate was found between patients treated with once daily dose of Synbiotic 2000 or placebo. In our small study, Synbiotic 2000 had no effect on postoperative recurrence of patients with CD. Larger studies in patients with the inflammatory type of CD undergoing surgery, using higher doses of probiotics cocktail might prove effective.},

   abstract = {The tumor necrosis factor alpha (TNF-alpha) is synthesized as a 26-kDa membrane-bound protein on certain cell types, e.g., T cells. The membrane-bound protein is cleaved to release a 17-kDa soluble form that exists as a homotrimer. It has been implicated in the pathogenesis of different diseases including cancer and inflammatory diseases such as rheumatoid arthritis (RA), Crohn's disease (CD), and ulcerative colitis (1, 2). The stimulation of TNF-alpha induction is known to activate several pro-inflammatory cytokines, chemokines, matrix metalloproteinases, and endothelial adhesion molecules that attract cells known to promote inflammation (3). Because of its role in the pathogenesis of different inflammatory diseases, a variety of anti-TNF-alpha agents have been developed and investigated for the treatment of these conditions (4). Several anti-TNF-alpha antibodies such as infliximab, adalimumab, and certolizumab are now available for the treatment of TNF-alpha-mediated inflammatory diseases (2). Infliximab is an anti-TNF-alpha, chimeric mouse-human IgG1 monoclonal antibody (mAb) that is commercially available and is approved by the United States Food and Drug Administration for the treatment of a variety of inflammatory diseases (2, 4). This mAb is known to bind TNF-alpha in the serum or on the cell membranes and to inhibit its biological activity mediated through the TNF-alpha receptor. To evaluate its in vivo use for the detection of TNF-alpha in the various inflammatory diseases, infliximab was labeled with radioactive meta-stable technetium (99mTc) and used as detailed below (2, 5-7).},

In Argentina, the strains were characterized in beef and dairy cattle and deer in different genetic patterns by molecular tools. M. avium subsp. paratuberculosis has been linked in men to a chronic inflammation of the intestine, named Crohn's disease. There is clinical and experimental evidence to link M. avium subsp. paratuberculosis with Crohn's disease by PCR, positive bacteriological culture from mother milk, blood and affected tissues by in situ hybridization. The milk and sub-products might be one of the possible infection sources and it has been suggested that M. avium subsp. paratuberculosis could resist pasteurization. Several works showed that this mycobacteria could be present in retail milk of countries such as United Kingdom, USA, Czech Republic, and recently in Argentina. M. avium subsp. paratuberculosis was associated with different dairy products and water for human consumption. Therefore, it is possible that these food sources may have a role for transmission. New investigations should emphasize the role of contaminated food and water in human infection around the world and determine the possible zoonotic role of M. avium subsp. paratuberculosis.},

To begin resolving this dilemma, over 100 officials, researchers, and industry representatives gathered in April 2007 to set research priorities that could lead to effective co-management of both food safety and water quality. Following the meeting, research priorities were refined and ordered by way of a Delphi process completed by 35 meeting participants. Although water quality and food safety experts conceptualized the issues differently, there were no deep disagreements with respect to research needs. Top priority was given to investigating the fate of pathogens potentially present on farms. Intermediate priorities included characterizing the influence of specific farm management practices on food safety and improving our understanding of vector processes. A scientific subdiscipline focusing on competing risks is needed to characterize and resolve conflicts between human and environmental health.},

   abstract = {Many advances have been made in the understanding of Crohn's disease (CD) pathogenesis during the last decade. CD is currently seen as a predominantly T-lymphocyte-driven disease characterized by the presence of a complex cocktail of interacting cytokines, chemokines and other mediators produced by a variety of cell types. Prevailing theories of CD pathogenesis suggest that patients' T-lymphocytes are inappropriately activated in the setting of an immune imbalance, which is itself caused by an unfortunate confluence of genetic and environmental factors. The T-cell response then leads to the chronic inflammation characteristic for the disease. Various environmental factors may play a role in the development of CD, but microbes are most consistently implied. This theory is based on epidemiological, clinicopathological, genetic and experimental evidence. Despite the abundance of arguments for the implication of bacteria in the aetiopathogenesis of CD, the precise role of bacteria in this disease still remains elusive. Three not necessarily mutually exclusive theories have been proposed: (1) an unidentified persistent pathogen; (2) an abnormally permeable mucosal barrier leading to excessive bacterial translocation; and (3) a breakdown in the balance between putative "protective" versus "harmful" intestinal bacteria ("dysbiosis"). At present, one cannot exclude with certainty any of these three proposed hypotheses; they may all apply to CD to a certain extent.},

In CD patients, the comparative effects on nutritional status of infliximab and traditional therapy have not yet been determined. The aim of our study was to assess the effects of infliximab as compared with those of standard therapy on nutritional status, disease activity, resting energy expenditure (REE), and food intake in CD children and adolescents. METHODS: From September 1999 to September 2005, all CD patients treated with infliximab (group A) were reviewed and matched with CD patients treated with traditional therapy (mesalazine and azathioprine) (group B). RESULTS: Fourteen CD patients from group A and 14 from group B were included; median interval before follow-up investigation was 10 months. Baseline and final values of weight, height, body mass index (BMI), pediatric CD activity index (pCDAI), REE, and food intake were studied. In treated patients, but not in control group, mean baseline weight (kg) and BMI values, 39.7 +/- 13.1 and 17.9 +/- 3.3, respectively, were significantly lower than their final values 42.6 +/- 13.2 and 18.9 +/- 3.1, and median pCDAI values 23.5 were significantly higher than their final values 10 (P < 0.05). Significant changes in height, REE, and food intake were not found in either group. CONCLUSIONS: In pediatric CD patients, infliximab seems to impact positively on the nutritional status as demonstrated by the improvement in weight and BMI, but not in linear growth; effects on nutritional status seem to be due to amelioration of disease activity, rather than to REE reduction or food intake increase.},

   abstract = {BACKGROUND: Some dietary foods are considered protective (vegetables and fruits), whereas others (fatty foods) are thought to enhance the risk for Crohn's disease (CD). The evidence, however, is inconsistent. METHODS: We postulated that specific dietary patterns may influence the risk for CD. A case-control study was carried out. Newly diagnosed CD cases with population and/or hospital-based controls < or =20 years were selected from 3 tertiary hospitals across Canada. Pre-disease diet was assessed using a validated food frequency questionnaire (FFQ) administered within 1 month of diagnosis. Factor analyses and unconditional logistic regression (adjusted) was used to determine gender-specific dietary patterns and assess associated risks for CD. Odds ratios (ORs) and corresponding 95% confidence intervals (95% CIs) were estimated. RESULTS: A total of 149 cases and 251 controls were included. The mean age (range) of the cases was 13.3 (2.6-20 years). There were more boys (61.1%). Four dietary patterns each were observed among both boys and girls. Pattern 1 in girls, characterized by meats, fatty foods, and desserts, was positively associated with CD (OR 4.7, 95% CI 1.6-14.2). Pattern 2, common to both boys and girls, was characterized by vegetables, fruits, olive oil, fish, grains, and nuts and was inversely associated with CD in both genders (girls: OR 0.3, 95% CI 0.1-0.9; boys: OR 0.2, 95% CI 0.1-0.5). CONCLUSIONS: Our results suggest that specific dietary patterns could be associated with higher or lower risks for CD in children. Larger prospective studies are required to confirm these findings.},

   abstract = {INTRODUCTION: Combined medullar sclerosis, together with peripheral sensory neuropathies, is the most common neurological manifestation observed in cobalamin deficiency. Biermer's disease is the predominant cause. Other clinical and etiological aspects are nevertheless frequent, although underestimated. METHODS: This retrospective study included patients with neurological symptoms and cobalamin (B12 vitamin) deficiency confirmed by laboratory tests collected over a period of 11 years. RESULTS: Twenty-seven cases were analyzed. Mean age was 47 years and there were 11 women and 16 men. Distribution of the neurological syndromes was: combined medullar sclerosis in 18 patients (67%), sensory neuropathies in 30% of cases and sensory-motor neuropathies in 15%. One patient had fronto-subcortical dementia with good improvement after vitamin replacement. In addition, autonomic dysfunction was noted in six patients (orthostatic symptomatic hypotension and/or urinary dysfunction and/or erectile failure). Dysautonomia revealed cobalamin deficiency in three patients with a good and fast response to the cobalamin therapy in all cases. Biermer's disease was diagnosed in 17 patients (63%) and a likely syndrome of nondissociation of cobalamin in two patients. One patient had Crohn's disease and no etiology was found in seven patients. In five patients (19%), nitrous oxide undoubtedly induced decompensation of latent cobalamin deficiency; four after a general anesthesia and one by chronic professional exposure. Outcome was very good in 46% of patients after vitamin replacement, particularly if treatment was started rapidly. DISCUSSION: The findings in this series highlight the frequency of autonomic dysfunction sometimes revealing cobalamin deficiency with a fast and good response to vitamin replacement and the frequency of neurological disorders following decompensation triggered by general anesthesia using nitrous oxide in patients with latent cobalamin deficiency.},

Identification of candidate genes is often based on a priori knowledge of disease processes. However, genome-wide association methods are not only validating previously identified genes and polymorphisms, but also revealing new gene-disease associations not anticipated from prior knowledge. In Crohn's disease (CD), such studies not only confirm the importance of caspase-activated recruitment domain 15 and major histocompatibility complex II molecules, but also reveal strong associations with the proinflammatory cytokine interleukin-23 receptor and autophagy-related 16-like gene. Genes identified to date in CD can be linked into two interrelated pathways: receptor-mediated cytokine induction or autophagocytosis. New genomic technologies need to be matched with innovative methodologies to characterize the likely impact of foods and to take the field to another dimension of value for human diet development and optimized health.},

   abstract = {BACKGROUND: Clinical trials of probiotic treatment for Crohn's disease (CD) have yielded conflicting results. This study assessed the clinical usefulness of combined probiotic and prebiotic therapy in the treatment of active CD. METHOD: Ten active CD outpatients without history of operation for CD were enrolled. Their mean (+/-SD) age was 27 +/- 7 years and the main symptoms presented were diarrhea and abdominal pain. Patients' initial therapeutic regimen of aminosalicylates and prednisolone failed to achieve remission. Patients were thus initiated on a synbiotic therapy, consisting of both probiotics (75 billion colony forming units [CFU] daily) and prebiotics (psyllium 9.9 g daily). Probiotics mainly comprised Bifidobacterium and Lactobacillus. Patients were free to adjust their intake of probiotics or prebiotics throughout the trial. Crohn's disease activity index (CDAI), International Organization for the Study of Inflammatory Bowel Disease (IOIBD) score and blood sample variables were evaluated and compared before and after the trial. RESULTS: The duration of the trial was 13.0 +/- 4.5 months. By the end of therapy, each patient had taken a 45 +/- 24 billion CFU daily probiotic dose, with six patients taking an additional 7.9 +/- 3.6 g daily psyllium dose. Seven patients had improved clinical symptoms following combined probiotic and prebiotic therapy. Both CDAI and IOIBD scores were significantly reduced after therapy (255-136, P = 0.009; 3.5-2.1, P = 0.03, respectively). Six patients had a complete response, one had a partial response, and three were non-responders. Two patients were able to discontinue their prednisolone therapy, while four patients decreased their intake. There were no adverse events. CONCLUSION: High-dose probiotic and prebiotic cotherapy can be safely and effectively used for the treatment of active CD.},

   abstract = {OBJECTIVE: Crohn's disease (CD) is characterized by a reduction in mucosal integrity that permits antigen penetration into the intestinal tissue. The administration of probiotics has been suggested to improve the barrier function of the mucosa. The objective of this study was to evaluate the influence of Saccharomyces boulardii on the intestinal permeability in CD. MATERIAL AND METHODS: Thirty-four patients were randomized according to the Vienna classification for treatment with either placebo or Saccharomyces boulardii. Baseline medications (mesalamine, azathioprine, prednisone, metronidazole and/or thalidomide) were maintained. Intestinal permeability (lactulose/mannitol ratio) was evaluated immediately before the beginning of treatment and at the end of the first and third treatment month. Fifteen healthy volunteers were also submitted for the intestinal permeability test. RESULTS: In volunteers, the lactulose/mannitol ratio was 0.005+/-0.0037, whereas this value was 0.021+/-0.01 in patients with CD (p=0.001). In the placebo group, there was an increase in lactulose/mannitol ratio by 0.004+/-0.010 (p=0.12) at the end of the third month. In the S. boulardii group, there was an improvement in intestinal permeability, with a decrease in the lactulose/mannitol ratio by 0.008+/-0.006 (p=0.0005) in the same period. CONCLUSIONS: Patients with CD in remission present alterations in the integrity of the intestinal mucosal barrier according to lactulose/mannitol ratio. S. boulardii added to baseline therapy improved intestinal permeability in these patients, even though complete normalization was not achieved.},

   abstract = {The endocannabinoid system is an ancient lipid signaling network which in mammals modulates neuronal functions, inflammatory processes, and is involved in the aetiology of certain human lifestyle diseases, such as Crohn's disease, atherosclerosis and osteoarthritis. The system is able to downregulate stress-related signals that lead to chronic inflammation and certain types of pain, but it is also involved in causing inflammation-associated symptoms, depending on the physiological context. The cannabinoid type-2 (CB(2)) receptor, which unlike the CB(1) receptor does not induce central side effects, has been shown to be a promising therapeutic target. While CB(1) receptor antagonists/inverse agonists are of therapeutic value, also CB(2) receptor ligands including agonists are of pharmacological interest. Although the endocannabinoid system is known to be involved in the regulation of energy homoeostasis and metabolism (mainly via CB(1) receptors) there was hitherto no direct link between food intake and cannabinoid receptor activation. Our recent finding that beta-caryophyllene, a ubiquitous lipohilic plant natural product, selectively binds to the CB(2) receptor and acts as a full agonist is unexpected. Maybe even more unexpected is that oral administration of this dietary compound exerts potent anti-inflammatory effects in wild type mice but not in CB(2) receptor (Cnr2(-/-)) knockout mice. Like other CB(2) ligands also beta-caryophyllene inhibits the pathways triggered by activation of the toll-like receptor complex CD14/TLR4/MD2, which typically lead to the expression of proinflammatory cytokines (IL-1beta, IL-6; IL-8 and TNFalpha) and promotes a TH(1) immune response. In this addendum, the CB(2) receptor-dependent effect of beta-caryophyllene on LPS-triggered activation of the kinases Erk1/2 and JNK1/2 are further discussed with respect to the possibility that both CB(2) inverse agonists and agonists, independent of their G-protein signaling, may block LPS-triggered activation of MAPKs, leading to inhibition of proinflammatory cytokine expression and attenuation of inflammation.},

   abstract = {Probiotics are defined as live microorganisms that, when administered in adequate amount, confer a health benefit on the host. Amongst the many benefits associated with the consumption of probiotics, modulation of the immune system has received the most attention. Several animal and human studies have provided unequivocal evidence that specific strains of probiotics are able to stimulate as well as regulate several aspects of natural and acquired immune responses. There is also evidence that intake of probiotics is effective in the prevention and/or management of acute gastroenteritis and rotavirus diarrhoea, antibiotic-associated diarrhoea and intestinal inflammatory disorders such as Crohn's disease and pouchitis, and paediatric atopic disorders. The efficacy of probiotics against bacterial infections and immunological disorders such as adult asthma, cancers, diabetes, and arthritis in humans remains to be proven. Also, major gaps exist in our knowledge about the mechanisms by which probiotics modulate immune function. Optimum dose, frequency and duration of treatment required for different conditions in different population groups also remains to be determined. Different probiotic strains vary in their ability to modulate the immune system and therefore efficacy of each strain needs to be carefully demonstrated through rigorously designed (randomised, double-blind, placebo-controlled) studies. This chapter provides an over view of the immunomodulatory effects of probiotics in health and disease, and discusses possible mechanisms through which probiotics mediate their disparate effects.},

In particular, n-3 fatty acids may be of therapeutic value for some Crohn's disease patients who experience Ca malabsorption. Therefore, the aim of the present study was to investigate the effect of 20 : 5n-3 and 22 : 6n-3 on transepithelial Ca transport across monolayers of healthy Caco-2 cells as well as of TNF-alpha-treated Caco-2 cells (an in vitro model of Crohn's disease). Caco-2 cells were seeded onto permeable filter supports and allowed to differentiate into monolayers, which were treated with 80 microM-20 : 5n-3, 80 microM-22 : 6n-3, or 40 microM-20 : 5n-3 + 40 microM-22 : 6n-3 for 6 or 8 d, with or without co-treatment with TNF-alpha (10 ng/ml) (n 11-15 monolayers per treatment). On day 16, transepithelial and transcellular transport of 45Ca and fluorescein transport (a marker of paracellular diffusion) were measured. Treatment of healthy and inflamed Caco-2 cells with 20 : 5n-3, 22 : 6n-3 and both fatty acids combined for 8 d significantly (P < 0.005-0.01) increased total transepithelial Ca transport compared with that in control, effects which were mediated by an enhanced rate of transcellular Ca transport. The effects of n-3 fatty acids on Ca absorption after 6 d were less clear-cut. In conclusion, the present in vitro findings highlight the need to investigate the effect of marine oil-based n-3 fatty acids on Ca absorption in vivo in studies of healthy human subjects as well as of Crohn's disease patients.},

   abstract = {BACKGROUND: Mycobacterium avium subspecies paratuberculosis (MAP) is the cause of paratuberculosis. MAP infections have not been reliably detected in dogs, but a reemerging debate about the link between MAP and Crohn's disease has renewed interest about the occurrence of MAP in pets. HYPOTHESIS: This study was undertaken to examine canine intestinal biopsies for the presence of MAP-specific DNA. ANIMALS: Forty-two dogs with chronic vomiting, diarrhea, or both; and 14 dogs with no gastrointestinal disease. METHODS: All dogs with signs of gastrointestinal disease had a standard work-up for chronic gastrointestinal disease. Endoscopically obtained intestinal biopsies were submitted for histopathologic and molecular investigations. Biopsies were screened for MAP-specific DNA by 3 polymerase chain reaction (PCR) methods (nested, seminested, and triplex real-time PCR). Samples from control dogs were obtained during necropsy. RESULTS: Histopathology of the biopsies was indicative of inflammatory bowel disease (IBD) in 17 and neoplasia in 6 dogs. Six dogs showing nonspecific changes responded to diet and were classified as having food-responsive enteropathy. In 13 dogs a final diagnosis was not established. MAP-specific DNA was detected and confirmed by sequencing in 8 dogs (19%). These dogs were diagnosed with food-responsive enteropathy (n=3), IBD (n=2), and open diagnosis (n=3). MAP-specific DNA was not detected in dogs with no gastrointestinal disease. CONCLUSIONS AND CLINICAL IMPORTANCE: MAP-specific DNA was detected in approximately one fifth of dogs with chronic gastrointestinal disease and might play a role as a pathogenic agent. Apart from animal welfare, the zoonotic aspect warrants further studies addressing the viability of MAP organism in canine intestinal biopsies by culture.},

   abstract = {Inflammatory bowel disease (IBD; Crohn's disease and ulcerative colitis) is the clinical outcome of three interactive pathogenic factors: genetic susceptibility, environmental triggers and immune dis-regulation. At present, only the immune response is targeted by most therapeutic or preventive strategies. The beneficial effect of yoghurt on health as well as its immunomodulator effect on the gut immune system is well documented. The aim of this work was to study the possible beneficial effects of yoghurt consumption on an experimental model of IBD in mice. Balb/c mice were fed with yoghurt for 10 consecutive days. At the end of the feeding period the mice received three inoculations of 2, 4, 6-trinitrobenzene sulphonic acid (TNBS) solutions once a week for 3 consecutive weeks. After TNBS instillation the mice received yoghurt again for 10 consecutive days. IBD control received only TNBS. After treatments we analysed the number of IgA-secreting cells, CD4+, CD8+ T cells population and the number of apoptotic cells in the large intestine. The number of erythrocytes and leucocytes in peripheral blood mononuclear cells (PBMCs) was also determined. We demonstrated the antinflammatory effect of yoghurt in an experimental model of IBD induced by TNBS. The effect was mediated by an increase in the number of the IgA+cells, a decrease in CD8+ population and by the induction of apoptosis of the infiltrative cells in the large intestine.},

   abstract = {The concept of the immune system in human milk emerged in the 1970s from clinical and laboratory observations made between the late 18th through the mid-20th centuries. The discovery of living leukocytes in human milk in 1970 was the final link to the chain of evidence that culminated in the concept. The concept was later expanded to include not only antimicrobial but also anti-inflammatory and immunoregulatory agents. These agents evolved to compensate for developmental delays in the immune system during infancy. Indeed, that explains the defense by human milk against common infectious diseases in infancy, necrotizing enterocolitis in preterm infants, and immune-mediated disorders such as Crohn's disease in later childhood. These diverse evolutionary outcomes underscore the superiority of human milk for the nutrition of human infants. Finally, other components of the immune system in human milk and their fate and functions in the developing infant may well be discovered in the near future.},

   abstract = {Johne's disease is an infectious disease of cattle caused by Mycobacterium avium subspecies paratuberculosis (MAP). Crohn's disease (CD) is a human disease of unknown etiology that is characterized by chronic bowel inflammation. No causal link has been scientifically established between MAP and CD, but it is important to understand possible impacts on society should such a causal link be established. The goal of this paper is to analyze the implications and the possible economic impacts that finding such a link would have on milk demand in the dairy industry and to provide a framework for further discussion among stakeholders. Three scenarios were developed based on the effectiveness of possible risk-mitigation strategies. In the first scenario, it was assumed that an effective strategy exists; therefore, a negligible demand decrease in the consumption of dairy products was expected. In the second scenario, it was assumed that new risk mitigation would need to be implemented to minimize the health hazard for humans. In this case, a small milk demand decrease was expected, but larger demand decreases were also possible. The third scenario assumed that no fully effective risk mitigation was available, and this resulted in a considerable demand decrease and a potential reduction in milk supply as a result of regulatory measures. A milk demand reduction of 1 or 5% resulted in a reduction in consumer surplus of $600 million and $2.9 billion, and a reduction in dairy farm income of $270 million and $1.3 billion, respectively. A decrease in milk supply would cause a slight increase in total losses, but would cause the greatest losses to test-positive dairy farms. Given the current scientific knowledge about MAP and CD, we conclude that if a link were established, it is most likely that the first or second scenario would occur. Thus, consumer response and economic consequences to the discovery of such a link are expected to be limited, but could be large if the consumer's perception of risk is large or if risk-mitigation strategies were ineffective.},

   abstract = {Rather than our routinely blamed ageing demography, pharmaceutical promotion and the medical business, not research, are responsible for our ever growing health bill. To keep essential health care affordable, only what has been proved necessary and cost effective should be financed by some kind of risk mutualisation system. Hedonistic care should be left to the free market. From conception to death, a devastating culture of medicalization and therapeutic agressivity has turned naturally inexpensive processes, such as conception, birth, ageing and death, into over-priced medical achievements. The increasing lack of personal and social responsibility triggered by the market, such as junk food, tobacco, drugs, sedentarity or trash media, multiply life-threatening illnesses such as diabetes 2, obesity, cardiovascular diseases and all kinds of cancers. Screenings require millions of participants and intense statistical analysis to prove any efficacy. Screenings, testings and proactive practices make people sick and produce more patients than they save lives , while generating exceptional returns on investments thanks to state and insurance financing; they should be put under public control. New drugs are unaffordable in spite of their dubious efficacy which often relies on biased and underpowered studies. Because they target desperate, debilitating, up to now incurable diseases like metastatic cancers, multiple sclerosis, Alzheimer, polyarthritis, Crohn disease, patients and their families want them by any means and at any price. The answer to the North-South health gap is in a global deal: a declining demographic trend, already well under way and free circulation not only of goods but also of people which would in the long run shape up the age pyramid of a progressively mixed population. That could also save lives at both ends of the human chain: those who die from starvation and those who die from overfeeding.},

   abstract = {In genetically susceptible individuals, an altered mucosal immune response against some commensal bacteria of the gut ecosystem appears to be the principal mechanism leading to intestinal lesions in inflammatory bowel disease (IBD). The information currently available does not provide an exact explanation about the origin of this important dysfunction of the interaction between host and commensal bacteria, but an altered microbial composition has been detected in the gut ecosystem of patients with Crohn's disease or ulcerative colitis. Prebiotics are food ingredients not digested nor absorbed in the upper intestinal tract that are fermented by intestinal bacteria in a selective way promoting changes in the gut ecosystem. Experimental and human studies have shown that inulin and oligofructose stimulate saccharolysis in the colonic lumen and favour the growth of indigenous lactobacilli and bifidobacteria. These effects are associated with reduced mucosal inflammation in animal models of IBD. Strong experimental evidence supports the hypothesis that inulin and oligofructose can offer an opportunity to prevent or mitigate intestinal inflammatory lesions in human Crohn's disease, ulcerative colitis, and pouchitis. Encouraging results have been obtained in preliminary clinical trials.},

   abstract = {BACKGROUND: A polymeric diet rich in transforming growth factor-beta 2 used as a single nutrient has been shown to induce remission in 79% of children with Crohn's disease. OBJECTIVES: To summarize the experience of several pediatric gastroenterology units in Israel using a TGFbeta2-enriched polymeric diet (Modulen IBD) supplementation in children and adolescents with Crohn's disease. METHODS: In a retrospective study we reviewed the charts of 28 children with Crohn's disease (10 girls, 18 boys) who received, in addition to conventional treatment, Modulen IBD as a supplement to their regular nutrition. These children were compared with 18 children supplemented with standard polymeric formula (Ensure Plus) and 18 children without formula supplementation. We recorded clinical manifestations, growth, and the Pediatric Crohn's Disease Activity Index before and after initiation of the polymeric diet. RESULTS: The Modulen-treated children showed a significant decrease in PCDAI from 34.3 to 15.7 (P< 0.0001). A significant decrease in PCDAI was recorded also in the Ensure Plus group, from 35 to 22 (P= 0.02) but not in the non-supplemented group. Significant improvements in body mass index (P = 0.01) and erythrocyte sedimentation rate (P= 0.03) were recorded at follow-up (median 3.4 months) only in the Modulen IBD group. CONCLUSIONS: In this cohort of children with Crohn's disease, supplementation of the diet with Modulen IBD as well as supplementation with Ensure Plus was associated with a decrease in PCDAI. The children supplemented with Modulen IBD also showed improvement in BMI, suggesting an additional advantage of nutritional therapy in children with this disease.},

   abstract = {Human subjects and their enteric microbiota have evolved together to reach a state of mutual tolerance. Mounting evidence from both animal models and human studies suggests that inflammatory bowel disease (IBD) represents a malfunction of this relationship. The enteric microecology therefore represents an attractive therapeutic target with few side effects. Probiotics and prebiotics have been investigated in clinical trials as treatments for IBD, with conflicting results. The evidence for the use of probiotics in the management of pouchitis is persuasive and several studies indicate their effectiveness in ulcerative colitis. Trials of probiotics and prebiotics in Crohn's disease are less convincing. However, methodologies vary widely and a range of probiotic, prebiotic and combination (synbiotic) treatments have been tested in a variety of patient groups with an assortment of end points. Conclusions about any one treatment in a specific patient group can therefore only be drawn on evidence from relatively small numbers of patients. The present article reviews the role of the intestinal microbiota in the pathogenesis of IBD and addresses the clinical evidence for the therapeutic manipulation of bowel microbiota using probiotics, prebiotics and synbiotics in IBD.},

Therapeutic strategies are designed to intervene in these abnormal host microbial communications. A novel approach in the last decade has been to use other bacteria or selective foods to induce beneficial bacteria to normalize inflammation. In this review we discuss rationale for such use and describe 46 clinical trials gleaned from the literature. Reports are divided into type, indications, and agents used. The search revealed 15 nonrandomized and 31 randomized trials. Of the latter 23 were double-blind and 8 were open-label randomized controlled. In 32 of the total, different probiotics were used, while 10 and 4 used different prebiotics or synbiotics respectively. In 14 nonrandomized trials, outcome was successful. In the randomized controlled trials 12 of 16 ulcerative colitis but only 2 of Crohn's disease trials of biotic therapy were successful. No superiority of any probiotic was clearly evident, but a multi-agent mixture, VSL3# may be better suited in ulcerative colitis and pouchitis while the probiotic Lactobacillus rhamnosus GG appears less useful in inflammatory bowel disease, especially Crohn's disease. Further studies with uniform stringent criteria are needed to provide proof of this therapy in inflammatory bowel disease.},

   abstract = {A possible mode of transmission for the ruminant pathogen Mycobacterium avium subsp. paratuberculosis (MAP) from cattle to humans is via milk and dairy products. Although controversially, MAP has been suggested as the causative agent of Crohn's disease and its presence in consumers' milk might be of concern. A method to detect MAP in milk with real-time PCR was developed for screening of bulk tank milk. Pellet and cream fractions of milk were pooled and subjected to enzymatic digestion and mechanical disruption and the DNA was extracted by automated magnetic bead separation. The analytical sensitivity was assessed to 100 organisms per ml milk (corresponding to 1-10 CFU per ml) for samples of 10 ml. The method was applied in a study of 56 dairy herds to compare PCR of farm bulk tank milk to culture of environmental faecal samples for detection of MAP in the herds. In this study, 68% of the herds were positive by environmental culture, while 30% were positive by milk PCR. Results indicate that although MAP may be shed into milk or transferred to milk by faecal contamination, it will probably occur in low numbers in the bulk tank milk due to dilution as well as general milking hygiene measures. The concentration of MAP can therefore be assumed to often fall below the detection limit. Thus, PCR detection of MAP in milk would be more useful for control of MAP presence in milk, in order to avoid transfer to humans, than for herd prevalence testing. It could also be of value in assessing human exposure to MAP via milk consumption. Quantification results also suggest that the level of MAP in the bulk tank milk of the studied Danish dairy herds was low, despite environmental isolation of MAP from the herds.},

   abstract = {BACKGROUND: Folate is postulated to protect against cell injury and long-term risk of cancer. Folate deficiency has been shown to be associated with inflammatory bowel disease (IBD). However, folate concentrations are poorly delineated in children with IBD. OBJECTIVE: The objective was to compare folate concentrations between children with newly diagnosed IBD and healthy controls. DESIGN: Red blood cell folate (RBCF) and whole-blood folate (WBF) concentrations were measured in 78 children (mean age: 12.8 +/- 2.7 y): 22 patients with newly diagnosed untreated Crohn disease, 11 patients with ulcerative colitis, 4 patients with indeterminate colitis, and 41 controls. Vitamin supplementation and dietary intakes determined by food-frequency questionnaire were recorded for 20 IBD patients and 28 controls. RESULTS: RBCF concentrations were 19.4% lower in controls (587.0 +/- 148.6 ng/mL) than in patients (728.7 +/- 185.8 ng/mL; P = 0.0004), and WBF concentrations were 11.1% lower in controls (218.2 +/- 49.7 ng/mL) than in patients (245.3 +/- 59.1 ng/mL; P = 0.031). Total folate intake was 18.8% higher in controls (444.7 +/- 266.7 microg/d) than in IBD patients (361.1 +/- 230.6 microg/d), but this difference was not statistically significant (P = 0.264). Folate intakes were below the Recommended Dietary Allowance (200-400 microg/d), adjusted for age and sex, in 35.4% of study subjects. CONCLUSIONS: In contrast with previous evidence of folate deficiency in adult IBD patients, our data indicate higher folate concentrations in children with newly diagnosed untreated IBD than in controls. This finding was unexpected, especially in light of the higher dietary folate intakes and hematocrit values in children without IBD. The influence of IBD therapy on folate metabolism and the long-term clinical implications of high RBCF and WBF concentrations at the time of IBD diagnosis should be explored further.},

   abstract = {INTRODUCTION: Crohn's disease (CD) in its active period is accompanied by a decreased food intake and deterioration in water, mineral and metabolic balance. Lipid metabolism is known to be altered in many acute diseases, and hypocholesterolemia is a serious negative prognostic indicator. The causes of decreased serum cholesterol concentration are multiple. Simultaneous affection of both cholesterol synthesis and absorption has been reported in many sources. The changes in both the above processes can be quantified with the use of specific indicators of synthesis (cholesterol level) and absorption (sitosterol and campesterol levels). OBJECTIVE: The objective of the study was to demonstrate changes in lipid metabolism in patients with active Crohn's disease, and to find out to what extent the above phenomenon is influenced by the affection of the process of cholesterol synthesis and/or absorption in the case of detected hypocholesterolemia. MATERIAL AND METHODS: Total serum cholesterol, LDL- and HDL-cholesterol and triglyceride levels were measured on the 3rd, 14th and 28th day from admission in addition to admission analyses in 24 patients with acute manifestation of CD (CDAI - Cohn's disease activity index - over 150). Also measured were the concentrations ofsqualene, lathosterol, sitosterol and campesterol. The results were compared with a control sample of 100 voluntary blood donors. The obtained data was processed using the Sigma-stat 3.1 statistical software. RESULTS: Decreased levels of all basic lipid metabolism parameters were detected. At the same time, a statistically significant decrease in the levels of lathosterol and camposterol was recorded. The decrease in sitosterol levels was insignificant and the level of squalene was higher than in the controls. CONCLUSION: Significant changes in lipid metabolism were demonstrated in the study in patients in active phase of Crohn's disease. Also detected was statistically significant hypocholesterolemia, with altered process of cholesterol synthesis and absorption.},

   abstract = {OBJECTIVE: Crohn's disease (CD) has been associated with low mucosal interleukin (IL)-10 production, but the mechanism behind this deficiency remains unclear. The aim of this study was to investigate IL-10 and interferon (IFN)-gamma production in intestinal CD4+ T cells from CD patients and healthy volunteers (HV) and to examine how this was affected by bacterial products and the presence or absence of autologous dendritic cells. MATERIAL AND METHODS: We cultured intestinal CD4+ T cells from CD patients (n=9) and HV (n=6) and differentiated dendritic cells from their peripheral monocytes. Intestinal T cells were stimulated with Lactobacillus strains or autologous intestinal bacteria in the presence or absence of dendritic cells. IL-10 and IFN-gamma were measured on day 4. RESULTS: When there were autologous dendritic cells present, CD intestinal T cells produced high levels of IFN-gamma (mean 6.4 ng/ml+/-standard error of the mean 1.1 ng/ml) but low levels of IL-10 (0.7 ng/ml+/-0.1 ng/ml). In contrast, HV intestinal T cells produced less IFN-gamma (3.9 ng/ml+/-0.8 ng/ml, p=0.06) and more IL-10 (4.6 ng/ml+/-0.9 ng/ml, p=0.0001) than CD intestinal T cells. Co-culture with Lactobacilli failed to revert this imbalance in CD, but tended to do so in HV. When there were no dendritic cells, CD intestinal T cells responded to autologous bacteria with an increased IFN-gamma production (2.3+/-1.3 ng/ml) compared with HV intestinal T cells (0.3+/-0.2 ng/ml). CONCLUSIONS: Crohn's disease intestinal CD4+ T cells display a pro-inflammatory cytokine profile with impaired production of the regulatory cytokine IL-10. Tolerogenic bacteria (Lactobacilli) failed to restore this regulatory defect.},

Retail cheese may represent a significant source of human exposure to MAP and the aim of this study was to assess MAP status in clinically healthy sheep and goats in Greece, comparing techniques routinely used in the positive diagnosis of the disease. From a total of 30 flocks, 632 sheep and goats had faecal, serum, and whole-blood samples examined by culture, complement fixation test (CFT), and polymerase chain reaction (PCR) targeted at IS900, IS1245, and IS6110. PCR produced positive results in 21% of the animals tested, with 5.6%, 3.9%, and 11.5% being identified as MAP, Mycobacterium avium subsp. avium, and Mycobacterium tuberculosis complex, respectively. CFT produced positive and suspicious results in 4.4% and 14.4% of the cases. Faecal cultures were negative in all but a single case that was identified as restriction fragment length polymorphism (RFLP)-type BC1. Agreement between results obtained by PCR and CFT was poor with isolated cases although an assessment of the MAP positive tests produced similar results for both methods. The findings indicate the need for additional measures of control, although the costs may be substantial if public health protection justifies elimination of MAP from livestock.},

   abstract = {Nutrition and Crohn's disease (CD) are intertwined because of the central role of nutrition in the care of patients with CD, specifically the theories regarding a dietary contribution to pathogenesis and formal studies investigating the primary role of nutrition as therapy for CD. Perhaps one of the most important studies evaluating the role of nutrition therapy and bowel rest in the management of CD was performed by Greenberg and colleagues in 1988. This pivotal study attempted to define the role of bowel rest as an independent variable in the management of hospitalized patients with active CD unresponsive to the traditional medical therapy that was available at the time. As the first randomized controlled trial evaluating nutrition intervention in CD, it showed that bowel rest was not a major factor in achieving remission during nutrition support and did not affect outcome during 1-year follow-up. Although these discouraging findings would be subsequently replicated, the role of enteral and parenteral nutrition therapy would evolve during the following years as a result of insight into CD pathogenesis, the emergence of more effective medical therapies, and improved understanding of the role of nutrition in the care of patients with CD.},

OBJECTIVE: Assessment of clinical course and activity of inflammatory bowel disease in children younger than 5 years was the goal of the study. MATERIAL AND METHODS: The study comprised 21 children aged 2 to 5 years (13 boys and 8 girls) who were diagnosed with: Lesniowski-Crohn disease (7 children), ulcerative colitis (7 children) and indeterminate colitis (remaining 7 children). RESULTS: Among studied children boys prevailed (61.9%). In 6 children the disease started in the first and second year of life; the average age of disease onset was 26.9 months and the time between the onset of the disease and the diagnosis was 16.6 months. 46% of patients came from the cities with population above 100000 when only 23% lived in the country. Autoimmune diseases were diagnosed in the families of 6 children, food or pollen allergy in the families of 11 children. Abdominal pain, diarrhea, presence of blood and mucous in the stool, fever and lack of thrive were most apparent in the clinical picture. The pathological changes were present mainly in the large intestine and only in one case in the upper part of the alimentary tract and jejunum. The observed course of the disease was severe or moderate. In two children aged 3 years colectomy was performed. CONCLUSIONS: In children younger than 5 years severe and moderate course of the Lesniowski-Crohn disease and ulcerative colitis is apparent. Fever, abdominal pain, diarrhea, presence of blood and mucous in the stool and lack of appetite were the most often seen symptoms. Pathological changes in children younger than 5 years were present mainly in the large intestine and only in single cases in the upper part of the alimentary tract and jejunum. In children with inflammatory bowel disease a frequent occurrence of allergy, bronchitis, pneumonia and urinary tract infection, which required antibiotics, was observed.},

The real time PCR assay amplifies both an internal sequence of the IS900 gene and an internal control targeting the ruminant-specific mt-cyt-b gene, in order to control for any false negative results. The sensitivity of this multiplex real time PCR assay on ground beef is 10(1) CFU/g and the sensitivity of conventional culture at 10(3) CFU/g. Furthermore, we conducted a survey of 200 retail ground beef samples using this system and did not detect the presence of MAP.},

AIM AND METHOD: To review the available evidence of clinical trials on probiotics in gastrointestinal and liver diseases, with a major focus on irritable bowel syndrome, inflammatory bowel disease, pancreatitis and chronic liver diseases. RESULTS: Evidence for the therapeutic or preventive application of particular probiotic strains is available for antibiotic-associated diarrhoea, rota-virus-associated diarrhoea and pouchitis. Results are encouraging for irritable bowel syndrome, ulcerative colitis and for reducing side effects by Helicobacter pylori eradication therapies, but are less clear for Crohn's disease, lactose intolerance and constipation. In general, for most of these patient groups, more placebo-controlled methodologically well-designed studies that pay attention to both clinical outcome and mechanistic aspects are required. The application in liver disease and pancreatitis is promising, but more human trials have to be awaited. Possible mechanisms of probiotics include modulation of the intestinal microbiota and the immune system, but different bacterial may have different effects. CONCLUSION: Further insight into disease entities and the functioning of probiotic strains is required to be able to select disease-specific strains, which have to be tested in well-designed placebo-controlled studies.},

There was no previous history of familial CD. METHODS: The family was interviewed at their home and an elaborated questionnaire was completed. The food and sanitation characteristics of the family were investigated. Moreover, serological markers were tested in all family members, including ASCA, ASCAg, ALCA, ACCA, Omp, and ANCA, using enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay and indirect immunofluorescence. Genetic variants in CARD15, TLR4, NOD1, CARD8, and DLG5 associated with CD were tested as well. The complete medical history of all patients was reviewed. RESULTS: There were no known genetic variants associated with CD in this family. None of the serological antibodies could discriminate between patients and unaffected family members, although the antibody titers were higher in diseased family members as compared with the healthy family members. CONCLUSION: The occurrence of 5 new cases of CD within 1 Moroccan family after immigration to Belgium cannot be explained by the known genetic susceptibility factors, and thus suggests a major environmental factor probably not related to sanitation in childhood.},

   abstract = {Elemental diet (ED) has been used as an enteral nutritional therapy for Crohn's disease. However, the precise mechanisms of ED remain unclear. In interleukin-10 (IL-10)-deficient cell-transferred mice, we investigated the change of intestinal microbiota with ED using molecular terminal-restriction fragment length polymorphism (T-RFLP) analysis and culture method, and evaluated its influence on therapeutic effects of ED. ED significantly suppressed intestinal inflammation. The total amount of bacteria in colitis mice fed the regular diet was higher than in normal mice but decreased in colitis mice fed ED. T-RFLP profiles of the ED group markedly differed from those of the regular diet groups. The diversity of bacterial species in the ED group decreased to 60% of that found in the regular diet groups. Among the cultivated bacteria, the change in lactic acid bacteria composition was remarkable. Lactobacillus reuteri and L. johnsonii decreased and Enterococcus faecalis and E. durans increased in the ED group. The culture supernatant of L. reuteri isolates induced significant tumor necrosis factor-alpha (TNF-alpha) and IL-6 activity in RAW 264 cells, while the culture supernatant of E. faecalis and E. durans barely induced their activity. These data suggested that reduction in amount and diversity of intestinal microbiota and decrease of proinflammatory cytokines via a change in composition of lactic acid bacteria by ED seem to contribute to reduction of bowel inflammation in this model.},

   abstract = {Inflammatory bowel disease (IBD) is characterized by anorexia, malnutrition, altered body composition, and development of mesenteric white adipose tissue (WAT) hypertrophy. Increasing evidence suggests that adipokines synthesized either in WAT or in immune cells, are involved in these manifestations of IBD. Among adipokines leptin, adiponectin and resistin hold a fundamental role while the role of ghrelin in inflammation is not well established. Preliminary studies have shown overexpression of leptin, adiponectin, and resistin in mesenteric WAT of patients with Crohn's disease (CD) and significant alterations of circulating serum levels of these adipokines in IBD. It has also been demonstrated that intestinal inflammation causes an increase in endogenous ghrelin production. In animal models of intestinal inflammation, existing data suggest that leptin, adiponectin, and resistin are pivotal mediators of inflammation. Interesting therapeutic interventions based on these data have been suggested. A specific role for hypertrophic WAT has also been implicated in CD. Further efforts with experimental and clinical studies are needed to better understand the role of adipokines in IBD.},

However, infliximab has been associated with various opportunistic pathogens such as tuberculosis, histoplasmosis, listeriosis, aspergillosis, and Pneumocystis jiroveci (carinii) pneumonia. We reviewed the FDA Adverse Event Reporting System for cases of Pneumocystis associated with infliximab use from January 1998 through December 2003. The database revealed 84 cases of PCP following infliximab therapy. Concomitant immunosuppressive medications included methotrexate, prednisone, azathioprine, 6-mercaptopurine, and cyclosporine. Mean time between infliximab infusion and onset of symptoms of pneumonia, when reported, was 21 days (+/-18 days; n=40). Twenty-three of the 84 (27%) patients died. The use of infliximab is associated with PCP infection. Further, the mortality rate for Pneumocystis following the use of infliximab is significant. The potential for severe disease, mortality, and often subtle presentation of these infections warrant close follow-up and careful monitoring after therapy.},

While a cure remains elusive, both can be treated with medications that induce and maintain remission. With the recent advent of therapies that inhibit tumor necrosis factor (TNF) alpha the overlap in medical therapies for UC and CD has become greater. Although 5-ASA agents have been a mainstay in the treatment of both CD and UC, the data for their efficacy in patients with CD, particularly as maintenance therapy, are equivocal. Antibiotics may have a limited role in the treatment of colonic CD. Steroids continue to be the first choice to treat active disease not responsive to other more conservative therapy; non-systemic steroids such as oral and rectal budesonide for ileal and right-sided CD and distal UC respectively are also effective in mild-moderate disease. 6-mercaptopurine (6-MP) and its prodrug azathioprine are steroid-sparing immunomodulators effective in the maintenance of remission of both CD and UC, while methotrexate may be used in both induction and maintenance of CD. Infliximab and adalimumab are anti-TNF agents approved in the US and Europe for the treatment of Crohn's disease, and infliximab is also approved for the treatment of UC.},

   abstract = {SUMMARY: Vitamin K and D deficiency and decreased bone mineral density (BMD) were highly prevalent in patients with inflammatory bowel disease (IBD), especially Crohn's disease (CD). Dietary intakes of these vitamins, however, were above the Japanese adequate intakes in IBD patients, suggesting that malabsorption is the basis for hypovitaminosis K and D and decreased BMD. INTRODUCTION: We have studied the possible involvement of vitamin K and D deficiency in the pathogenesis of decreased BMD in IBD. METHODS: Seventy patients with IBD were evaluated for their BMD; plasma levels of vitamin K; phylloquinone (PK), menaquinone-7 (MK-7), and 25OH-D; serum PTH, protein induced by vitamin K absence (PIVKA-II), and undercarboxylated osteocalcin (ucOC) levels; and their food intake. RESULTS: Compared with ulcerative colitis (UC) patients, CD patients had significantly lower plasma vitamin K and 25OH-D concentrations; significantly higher serum levels of PTH, PIVKA-II, and ucOC; and significantly lower BMD scores at almost all measurement sites. More IBD patients were vitamin K deficient in bone than in liver. Multiple regression analyses revealed that low plasma concentrations of vitamin K and 25OH-D were independent risk factors for low BMD and that they were associated with the patients' fat intake, but not with their intake of these vitamins. CONCLUSION: IBD patients have high prevalence of decreased BMD and vitamin K and D deficiency probably caused by malabsorption of these vitamins.},

Traditionally, the incidence of IBD was higher in the developed, industrialized countries, in contrast, nowadays it became more prevalent in the previously low incidence areas. In particular, the incidence of ulcerative colitis (UC) is similar to that observed in North America and Western Europe, while the incidence of Crohn's disease (CD) in developing countries is still low, suggesting that the environmental factors may act faster or differently in UC than in CD. In Europe, the North to South gradient disappeared, and also the West to East gradient is diminishing. Smoking and appendectomy may be considered as important environmental factors in both UC and CD, however, with opposite effects. In addition, the use of oral contraceptives is associated to disease susceptibility in both diseases. The role of diet, perinatal events, stress and nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drugs in the pathogenesis is still controversial.},

   abstract = {Crohn's disease and ulcerative colitis, also called chronic inflammatory bowel diseases (IBD), affect up to 500 per 100,000 persons in the Western world. Recent studies in the etiology of IBD suggest that these diseases are caused by a combination of genetic, environmental, and immunological factors. Results from humans and especially animal models of colitis reported by our group and others have indicated that these diseases result from a lack of tolerance to resident intestinal bacteria in genetically susceptible hosts. Probiotic bacteria have health-promoting effects for the host when ingested and have also shown efficacy in ulcerative colitis and refractory pouchitis. In light of the efficacy of providing probiotic bacteria to patients with IBD, there has been interest in the prophylactic and therapeutic potential of inulin, oligofructose, and other prebiotics for patients with or at risk of IBD. Prebiotics are nondigestible dietary oligosaccharides that affect the host by selectively stimulating growth, activity, or both of selective intestinal (probiotic) bacteria. Prebiotics are easy to administer and, in contrast to probiotic therapy, do not require administration of large amounts of (live) bacteria and are therefore easier to administer. Studies using prebiotics, especially beta-fructan oligosaccharides, for the treatment of chronic intestinal inflammation have shown benefit in animal models of colitis. Studies using these prebiotics alone or in combination with probiotics are emerging and have shown promise. These dietary therapies could lead to novel treatments for these chronic debilitating diseases.},

   abstract = {The same drugs are used to treat hemorrhagic rectocolitis (HRC) and Crohn's disease (CD), although the aims are very different. Aminosalicylates are highly beneficial in HRC but virtually ineffective in CD, a disease in which immunosuppressants are more useful. Aminosalicylates exert their antiinflammatory effect directly on the lesions. Various oral and rectal preparations have been developed in order to deliver the active molecule to the intestinal target segment. These drugs are now known to act by stimulating the nuclear receptor PPAR-gamma, and this knowledge should help with the development of new agents. Chronic aminosalicylate treatment appears to diminish the risk of malignant transformation. Systemic steroids are still the mainstay of treatment for exacerbations of HRC and CD, yielding remissions in 60 to 90% of cases. In contrast, systemic steroids should not be used for maintenance therapy. Budesonide is a preparation that selectively releases steroids in the ileocolonic region, thereby reducing systemic adverse effects. Immunosuppressants such as azathioprine and 6-mercaptopurine, and also methotrexate in some cases, are used for maintenance therapy of steroid-dependent and highly recurrent forms. These drugs stabilize the disease in about half the patients who receive them. Treatment typically lasts several years and necessitates regular monitoring, especially of hematological status. Cyclosporine is used intravenously in severe HRC. Infliximab (RemicadeR), a chimeric monoclonal antibody targeting TNF is effective in acute forms and as maintenance therapy for CD. It was also recently shown to be effective in HRC. Infliximab is indicated in steroid-resistant forms and contraindicated in patients with latent systemic infections (tuberculosis, hepatitis B) and heart failure. Artificial nutrition is now only used in children with acute forms, in order to avoid the need for steroids. Probiotics might have a place in maintenance treatment of HRC. Surgical treatment of HRC consists of colectomy or, more radically, ileoprotectomy followed by ileoanal anastomosis with resection: however, the likely benefits and potential complications (especially nocturnal diarrhea) must be carefully weighed up. Surgical treatment of CD consists of resecting the worst-affected segments. As available medical and surgical treatments can only control these diseases, without curing them, patient management must be planned on a long-term basis. Control of exacerbations is judged on the basis of clinical parameters and biological markers of inflammation, rather than on lesion healing. The choice of maintenance therapy depends on the nature of the disease (HRC or CD) and its progressive nature. Surgery is reserved for patients with complicated and drug-resistant forms.},

Crohn's disease (CD) is a chronic relapsing intestinal inflammation in genetically susceptible individuals and is influenced by yet unidentified environmental factors. It is hypothesized, in the present review, that Al is a potential factor for induction or maintaining the inflammation in CD. Epidemiologically, CD incidence is higher in urban areas, where microparticle pollution is prevalent. Al immune activities share many characteristics with the immune pathology of CD: increased antigen presentation and APCs activation, many luminal bacterial or dietary compounds can be adsorbed to the metal and induce Th1 profile activity, promotion of humoral and cellular immune responses, proinflammatory, apoptotic, oxidative activity, and stress-related molecule expression enhancement, affecting intestinal bacterial composition and virulence, granuloma formation, colitis induction in an animal model of CD, and terminal ileum uptake. The Al-bacterial interaction, the microparticles homing the intestine together with the extensive immune activity, put Al as a potential environmental candidate for CD induction and maintenance.},

   abstract = {Cyclooxygenases (COX) regulate a variety of inflammatory diseases, including inflammatory bowel disease (IBD). While the pathological effects of COX-1 inhibition by NSAIDs on intestinal ulceration are well established, the role of COX-2 on intestinal inflammation remains under investigation. In this paper, we report a protective role for COX-2 against diet-mediated intestinal inflammation in mice. COX-2(-/-) mice fed an atherogenic diet or diet containing cholate, but not chow or fat alone, had a high mortality whereas COX-1(-/-) mice and wild-type mice were unaffected by the dietary changes. Histological analysis identified the cause of death in COX-2(-/-) mice due to severe intestinal inflammation that was surprisingly limited to the ileo-ceco-colic junction. COX-2 expression is induced in the cecum of wild-type mice fed an atherogenic diet. Our findings show that COX-2 plays an anti-inflammatory role at the ileo-ceco-colic junction in mice, and the pathology of diet-mediated intestinal inflammation in COX-2(-/-) mice offers an excellent model system to elucidate the molecular mechanisms of intestinal inflammation.},

We studied 20 healthy controls and 20 subjects with IBD, 15 of whom had Crohn's disease and five with ulcerative colitis. All the subjects consumed Lactobacillus rhamnosus GR-1 and L. reuteri RC-14 supplemented yogurt for 30 days. The presence of putative regulatory T (T(reg)) cells (CD4(+) CD25(high)) and cytokines in T cells, monocytes and dendritic cells (DC) was determined by flow cytometry from peripheral blood before and after treatment, with or without ex vivo stimulation. Serum and faecal cytokine concentrations were determined by enzyme-linked immunosorbent assays. The proportion of CD4(+) CD25(high) T cells increased significantly (P = 0.007) in IBD patients, mean (95% confidence interval: CI) 0.84% (95% CI 0.55-1.12) before and 1.25% (95% CI 0.97-1.54) after treatment, but non-significantly in controls. The basal proportion of tumour necrosis factor (TNF)-alpha(+)/interleukin (IL)-12(+) monocytes and myeloid DC decreased in both subject groups, but of stimulated cells only in IBD patients. Also serum IL-12 concentrations and proportions of IL-2(+) and CD69(+) T cells from stimulated cells decreased in IBD patients. The increase in CD4(+) CD25(high) T cells correlated with the decrease in the percentage of TNF-alpha- or IL-12-producing monocytes and DC. The effect of the probiotic yogurt was confirmed by a follow-up study in which subjects consumed the yogurt without the probiotic organisms. Probiotic yogurt intake was associated with significant anti-inflammatory effects that paralleled the expansion of peripheral pool of putative T(reg) cells in IBD patients and with few effects in controls.},

   abstract = {Collagenous and lymphocytic colitis are the two recognized major presentations of microscopic colitis. Both diseases present with chronic watery diarrhea and a chronic inflammatory infiltrate in the colonic mucosa without specific endoscopic abnormalities, and hence diagnosis is established by histology. Recent epidemiological studies suggest that microscopic colitis may affect as many patients as Crohn's disease or ulcerative colitis. The cause of these diseases is unknown; however, several lines of evidence support the hypothesis of mucosal injury from an unknown agent in the fecal stream. Due to the lack of disease causality, therapeutic management of microscopic colitis is now directed primarily at symptoms' resolution or improvement. Based on current evidence, oral budesonide represents an effective treatment option for patients with microscopic colitis to achieve and maintain remission. Other anti-inflammatory drugs such as mesalazine or bismuth subsalicylate are now under evaluation. The optimal long-term management strategy of microscopic colitis, however, remains an unsolved issue.},

Current Food and Drug Administration classifications do not necessarily reflect clinical experience or recent literature. Ideally, one should use the lowest-risk drug possible, with attention to the appropriate level of efficacy for the patient's condition, the stage of pregnancy and dose adjustment. Every treatment decision should be fully discussed with the patient and a multidisciplinary team that should include the obstetrician and, if appropriate, the paediatrician. This review will cover the medications commonly used to treat gastrointestinal disease. The majority of medications can be categorised as 'low risk' or 'should be avoided'. The following medications should never be used during pregnancy due to the clear risk of teratogenicity or adverse events: bismuth, castor oil, sodium bicarbonate, methotrexate, ribavirin, doxycycline, tetracycline, and thalidomide.},

   abstract = {Inflammatory bowel disease (IBD) represents a spectrum of diseases in which inflammation leads to acute and chronic gut injury. It is a growing health issue for which no cure exists. The pathogenesis is multifactorial with links to infectious and environmental events that trigger disease in genetically predisposed individuals. Treatment of the two major forms of IBD, Crohn's disease and ulcerative colitis, involves the reduction of inflammation with toxic immunosuppressive drugs or blocking of the pro-inflammatory effects of tumour necrosis factor-alpha (TNF-alpha) with antibodies. Here, we show that the oral administration of transgenic low-alkaloid tobacco expressing the contra-inflammatory cytokine human interleukin-10 (hIL-10) reduces the severity of colitis by down-regulating TNF-alpha expression directly at the sites of inflammation in IBD-susceptible IL-10(-/-) mice. hIL-10 expressed in plants is biologically active and displays resistance to gastrointestinal degradation. Dietary supplementation with plant tissue delivering up to 9 microg of hIL-10 daily for 4 weeks was well tolerated by treated mice. Gut histology was significantly improved relative to controls (P = 0.002), and was correlated with a decrease in small bowel TNF-alpha mRNA levels and an increase in IL-2 and IL-1beta mRNA levels. Transgenic plants expressing IL-10 to directly attenuate TNF-alpha expression at sites of inflammation in the gut may become a useful new approach in the luminal therapy of IBD.},

Few clinical, biological and genetic factors tend to predict response in Crohn's disease (CD) patient subcategories, none widely predicting response to infliximab. DESIGN AND METHODS: Twenty CD patients showing clinical response or non response to infliximab were used for serum proteomic profiling on Surface Enhanced Lazer Desorption Ionisation-Time of Flight-Mass Spectrometry (SELDI-TOF-MS), each before and after treatment. Univariate and multivariate data analysis were performed for prediction and characterization of response to infliximab. RESULTS: We obtained a model of classification predicting response to treatment and selected relevant potential biomarkers, among which platelet aggregation factor 4 (PF4). We quantified PF4, sCD40L and IL-6 by ELISA for correlation studies. CONCLUSIONS: This first proteomic pilot study on response to infliximab in CD suggests association between platelet metabolism and response to infliximab and requires validation studies on a larger cohort of patients.},

   abstract = {BACKGROUND: In the general population, selective cyclooxygenase (COX)-2 inhibitors have been associated with fewer gastrointestinal adverse effects (AEs) than NSAIDs, but whether they are associated with exacerbations in patients with inflammatory bowel disease (IBD) remains controversial. OBJECTIVE: The aim of this study was to review published and unpublished findings to determine whether the use of COX-2 inhibitors increased the risk for IBD exacerbations relative to placebo in the treatment of IBD. METHODS: A systematic search of MEDLINE (1966-July 2007), EMBASE (1980-July 2007), the Cochrane Library (2007 Issue 4), US Food and Drug Administration records, and data on file at Novartis Pharmaceuticals Corporation, Pfizer US Pharmaceutical Group, and Merck & Co., Inc., using the search terms celecoxib, rofecoxib, valdecoxib, etoricoxib, lumiracoxib, cyclooxygenase 2 inhibitor, Crohn's disease, ulcerative colitis, and inflammatory bowel disease, was performed to identify randomized, placebo-controlled clinical trials of 5 COX-2 inhibitors in patients with IBD. The publications were fully reviewed for quality. Data on trial design, patient characteristics, intervention drugs, dosages, and outcomes were collected using a predetermined data-extraction form. A meta-analysis was performed based on the publications that met the inclusion/exclusion criteria. RESULTS: Of 588 studies identified in the electronic search, 574 were excluded after screening the titles and abstracts. Fourteen related to the use of COX-2 inhibitors in patients with IBD were reviewed. Two randomized, controlled trials comparing COX-2 inhibitors with placebo were identified. In the first trial, 82 patients were randomized to receive etoricoxib (60-120 mg/d) and 77 to receive placebo. The exacerbation rates were 10.5% (8/76) in the active-treatment group and 11.4% (8/70) in the placebo group (relative risk [RR], 0.92; 95% CI, 0.37-2.32). In the second trial, 112 patients were treated with celecoxib (200 mg BID) and 110 received placebo. The exacerbation rates were 3.7% (4/107) in the celecoxib group and 2.7% (3/110) in the placebo group (RR, 0.73; 95% CI, 0.17-3.18). Of these patients, 5 were lost to follow-up because of AEs. In the meta-analysis comparing COX-2 inhibitors and placebo, the RR was 0.86 (95% CI, 0.39-1.88). No statistically significant differences in IBD relapse rates were found between COX-2 inhibitors and placebo. CONCLUSIONS: The results from this meta-analysis suggest that insufficient data were available to determine the impact of COX-2 inhibitors on IBD exacerbations. The relatively smaller risk for AEs makes the short-term use of COX-2 inhibitors potentially attractive, but the long-term benefits remain unclear. Further studies with sound methodology and large sample sizes are needed to evaluate the tolerability of COX-2 inhibitors in the treatment of IBD.},

As a result many patients affected by Crohn's disease and ulcerative colitis are females of reproductive age interested in bearing children. It has been shown that the most important factor in the success of a pregnancy in patients with IBD is the state of disease activity. Therefore, the goal prior to and during pregnancy is to best optimise control of the disease through medical therapy. Unfortunately, many medications utilised to treat IBD are potentially toxic and/or teratogenic, leaving many physicians and patients without a clear answer as to the safest methods of therapy. This review attempts to summarise the medical literature to date, as it pertains to the safety of medical therapy for IBD during pregnancy and the puerperium.},

We aimed to assess the effect of two different enteral supplements of Impact(R) Powder (IP; Novartis, Switzerland) on leptin levels and nutritional status in active CD patients during prednisolone treatment and tapering. METHODS: Thirty-one CD patients were randomized to IP Extra (group 1) or IP Standard (group 2). Leptin levels, nutritional, clinical and biochemical markers were studied at inclusion, after 5 and after 9 weeks of the study. RESULTS: Leptin levels, body mass index (BMI) and total cholesterol increased significantly within both groups at week 5 compared to inclusion. Leptin levels correlated with BMI in both groups at inclusion and in group 2 at week 9. In group 1, triglyceride levels remained unchanged, while levels in group 2 increased significantly at week 5 compared to inclusion. Clinical and biochemical markers improved during the study compared to inclusion. CONCLUSIONS: Increased leptin levels during the study progress were transient, decreasing due to prednisolone withdrawal at the end of the study. Both formulas used as adjuvant therapy to prednisolone treatment were able to improve nutritional status in CD patients.},

   abstract = {The gastrointestinal innate and adaptive immune system continuously faces the challenge of potent stimuli from the commensal microflora and food constituents. These local immune responses require a tight control, the outcome of which is in most cases the induction of tolerance. Local T cell immunity is an important compartment of the specific intestinal immune system. T cell reactivity is programmed during the initial stage of its activation by professional presenting cells. Mucosal dendritic cells (DCs) are assumed to play key roles in regulating immune responses in the antigen-rich gastrointestinal environment. Mucosal DCs are a heterogeneous population that can either initiate (innate and adaptive) immune responses, or control intestinal inflammation and maintain tolerance. Defects in this regulation are supposed to lead to the two major forms of inflammatory bowel disease (IBD), Crohn's disease (CD) and ulcerative colitis (UC). This review will discuss the emerging role of mucosal DCs in regulating intestinal inflammation and immune responses.},

ONS and/or TF in addition to normal food is indicates in undernourished patients with CD or UC to improve nutritional status. In active CD EN is the first line therapy in children and should be used as sole therapy in adults mainly when treatment with corticosteroids is not feasible. No significant differences have been shown in the effects of free amino acid, peptide-based and hole protein formulae for TF. In remission ONS is recommended only in steroid dependent patients in CD. In patients with SBS TF should be introduced in the adaptation phase and should be changed with progressing adaptation to ONS in addition to normal food. Special nutrition support should not be used routinely in patients with mild or moderate acute pancreatitis. EN is the preffered route in patients with pancreatitis and should be attempted before initiating parenteral nutrition. Nutrition assessment in patients with liver disease should include screening for micronutrient deficiencies. Protein restriction should be implemented for the acute management of hepatic encephalopathy and should not be implemented chronically in patients with liver disease.},

   abstract = {OBJECTIVE: Short bowel syndrome patients frequently experience impaired health-related quality of life. This syndrome is also associated with increased costs for the individuals concerned and the community. Intake of specially processed cereals has been demonstrated to decrease intestinal secretion. This study evaluates the effect of a supplementary diet with specially processed cereals compared with nonprocessed cereals. METHODS: This investigation is a randomized double-blind, cross-over multicentre prospective study of 26 intestinal resected out patients, considered as short bowel syndrome patients. The patients were divided into groups A or B, in accordance with the first allocated treatment. Subgroup analyses of the underlying diagnoses and type of surgical procedure were performed. The studied parameters were faecal volume, nocturnal stools, abdominal pain/discomfort, health-related quality of life, peripheral blood tests and anthropometric data. RESULTS: In both groups, intake of nonprocessed cereals significantly decreased the faecal volume. The subgroup analyses of patients with a history of ulcerative colitis (compared with Crohn's disease) and nonileostomy-operated procedure (compared with ileostomi-operated procedure) showed significantly decreased faecal volume during nonprocessed cereals intake. Peripheral blood tests, quality of life and anthropometry were not affected. CONCLUSION: In this study, nonprocessed cereals seemed to be as effective as specially processed cereals in decreasing faecal volume in general and especially in ulcerative colitis patients (mainly operated with nonileostomy techniques). Our results indicate that use of supplementary cereals is safe for this group of patients, but should optimally include evaluation of the underlying diagnosis and the surgical method used.},

   abstract = {Nutrigenomics seeks to understand the interplay between an individual's genes and their diet. This approach can potentially be harnessed to reduce the incidence or symptoms of chronic diseases, such as inflammatory bowel disease (IBD). It becomes desirable to interrogate the vast number of discrete compounds present in foods for their ability to influence the phenotype of a cell carrying a variant single nucleotide polymorphism (SNP). Here we describe two cell-based assays that can now be used to test the ability of food components or extracts, to overcome the functional effects of certain variant SNPs that may be important in human IBD. The first monitors the signal transduction pathways of key pattern recognition receptors, in which SNPs associated with IBD have been identified, and tests for food components or extracts that can modulate these pathways for potential therapeutic benefit. The second models the NOD2 3020insC SNP, which is the most common and highest risk variant in Crohn's disease, and examines the ability of food components or extracts to restore the normal phenotype in the mutant cell line. Such screens provide a scientific basis for the rational choice of foods to be more rigorously investigated in animal models of IBD.},

Shear stress induced during the atomisation and the type of carrier used for the layering process did not influence the viability. A 5% lactose matrix resulted in the highest viability of L. lactis (8.9+/-1.7%) which could be maintained for at least 12 months at -20 degrees C. A higher bacterial cell load on the pellets was obtained using a longer process time, but the addition of 10% skim milk was essential to maintain the stabilising capacity of the matrix. Increasing the load of viable L. lactis was also possible using a higher bacterial cell concentration of the layering suspension and increasing the amount of stabilising matrix to 10% lactose/20% skim milk, yielding a formulation with 1.7 x 10(9)cfu/100 mg pellets. To protect the bacteria during gastric passage and to obtain ileum targeting, the formulation was enteric coated with 5% Eudragit FS30D, but after coating and gastric residence for 2 h HCl about 1% of the bacteria remained viable. Application of a subcoating, previous to enteric coating, did not result in a higher viability.},

   abstract = {Dietary microparticles are non-biological bacterial-sized particles of the gastrointestinal lumen that occur due to endogenous formation (calcium phosphate) or following oral exposure (exogenous microparticle). In the UK, about 40 mg (10(12)) of exogenous microparticles are ingested per person per day, through exposure to food additives, pharmaceutical/supplement excipients or toothpaste constituents. Once ingested, exogenous microparticles are unlikely to pass through the gastrointestinal tract without adsorbing to their surfaces some ions and molecules of the intestinal lumen. Both entropy and ionic attraction drive such interactions. Calcium ions are especially well adsorbed by dietary microparticles which then provide a positively charged surface for the attraction (adsorption) of other organic molecules such as lipopolysaccharides, peptidoglycans or protein antigen from the diet or commensal flora. The major (but not only) sites of microparticle entry into intestinal tissue are the M-cell rich lymphoid aggregates (termed Peyer's patches in the small bowel). Indeed, it is well established that this is an efficient transport route for non-biological microparticles although it is unclear why. We hypothesise that this pathway exists for "endogenous microparticles" of calcium phosphate, with immunological and physiological benefit, and that "exogenous dietary microparticles", such as titanium dioxide and the silicates, hijack this route. This overview focuses on what is known of these microparticles and outlines their potential role in immune tolerance of the gut (endogenous microparticles) or immune activation (exogenous microparticles) and inflammation of the gut.},

More recently, probiotics have been evaluated in the management of specific colonic disorders such as inflammatory bowel disease, irritable bowel syndrome, and Clostridium difficile colitis. It is evident that no two probiotics are exactly alike; why then should we expect reproducible results from studies that employ different species or strains, variable formulations, and diverse dosing schedules? When probiotics have been studied with the rigor appropriate to a new therapeutic modality, some coherent results have emerged: specific strains are effective in certain diarrheal states, irritable bowel syndrome, ulcerative colitis, and pouchitis, as well as in the prevention of C. difficile-related colitis. Even here, not to mention other colonic disorders, further adequately powered and appropriately designed trials are needed.},

METHODS: PUBMED and Cochrane Central Register of Controlled Trials were searched for clinical trial studies investigated the efficacy of probiotics for the maintenance of remission in Crohn's disease. Clinical relapse and endoscopic relapse were the key outcomes of interest. Data were searched within the time period of 1966 through May 2007. RESULT: Eight randomized placebo-controlled clinical trials met our criteria and were included in the analysis. Seven determined clinical relapse and three evaluated endoscopic relapse among patients with CD received probiotics for maintenance of remission. Pooling of seven trials for the outcome of clinical relapse yielded an odds ratio of 0.92 (95% confidence interval of 0.52-1.62, P = 0.8853), a nonsignificant odds ratio. The odds ratio for three studies for the outcome of endoscopic relapse was 0.97 (95% confidence interval of 0.54-1.78, P = 0.93), a nonsignificant odds ratio. CONCLUSION: This meta-analysis fails to demonstrate the efficacy of probiotics in maintaining remission and preventing clinical and endoscopic recurrence in CD.

In addition, patients with inflammatory bowel disease are often found to have nutrient deficiencies at the time of diagnosis, whereas others develop features of malnutrition over the course of their illness. Therefore, an understanding of the relationship between nutrients and inflammatory bowel disease is important if these patients are to receive optimal care. RECENT FINDINGS: Epidemiologic and basic research has helped to shed light on the interaction between diet and the pathogenesis of inflammatory bowel disease. Numerous clinical trials utilizing various types of lipids, including fish oil and short chain fatty acids, suggest that fats play an important role in the inflammatory response that characterizes inflammatory bowel disease. Vitamins and other micronutrients involved in nutrient metabolism and modulation of oxidative stress are also considered in this review. SUMMARY: This update discusses nutritional issues that can be used to help prevent and treat nutrient deficiencies and ameliorate disease activity in individuals with inflammatory bowel disease.},

Whole-protein polymeric formula (PF) seems to be much more palatable than amino acid-based elemental formula (EF) and thus may significantly improve adherence to LDT. AIM: To compare adherence to LDT using PF versus EF. METHODS: Success in completing a 6-week course of LDT, need for nasogastric tube administration of formula and use of LDT for relapses were compared between children presenting with active disease and treated with EF (n = 53) and children given PF (n = 45). RESULTS: Remission rates were similar (EF 64%, 95% CI 51 to 77 vs PF 51%, 95% CI 37 to 66; p>0.15). 72% (95% CI 60 to 84) given EF completed the initial course of LDT compared with 58% (95% CI 44 to 72) given PF (p = 0.15). Of those failing to complete the initial course, 13% on EF and 16% on PF gave up by choice (non-adherence), the remainder stopping due to treatment failure. Nasogastric administration was more frequent with EF (55%, 95% CI 42 to 68) compared to PF (31%, 95% CI 17 to 45) (p = 0.02). Among those treated successfully at first presentation, LDT was used for 28% of relapses in the EF group (95% CI 12 to 44) and 39% in the PF group (95% CI 19 to 59) (p>0.2) over the next year. CONCLUSION: PF did not effect adherence to LDT but was associated with significantly reduced need for nasogastric tube administration of formula.},

   abstract = {Enteropathy defines abnormalities of the small intestinal mucosa, visible with the light microscope, of various etiologies, that can be separated into acute versus chronic conditions. This review focuses on these areas in which recent progress has been made. Severe infections increase mucosal permeability and induce local expression of co-stimulatory molecules allowing antigen penetration in the mucosa, T cell activation and possible disruption of oral tolerance. Biotherapeutics are of importance in the prevention and treatment of (chronic) enteropathy of infectious origin. Celiac disease and cow's milk protein allergy are key examples of chronic enteropathy. The dietary approach to allergy has evolved to include active stimulation of the immature immune system in order to support the establishment of tolerance. Supplementation with probiotics may provide maturational signals for the lymphoid tissue and improve the balance of pro- and anti-inflammatory cytokines. Enteral polymeric feeding is effective in Crohn's disease. Dietary nucleotides may improve growth and immunity, optimize maturation, recovery and function of rapidly dividing tissue. Adequate dietary lipids are important not just for caloric value but also for immune-modulatory effects. Lipids may prevent allergic sensitization by downregulating inflammatory response (n-3 but not n-6 fatty acids) whilst protecting the epithelial barrier, regulating immune function and modifying the adherence of microbes to the mucosa, thereby contributing to host-microbe interactions.},

   abstract = {Mucosal surfaces are colonized by a diverse and dynamic microbiota. Much investigation has focused on bacterial colonization of the intestine, home to the vast majority of this microbiota. Experimental evidence has highlighted that these colonizing microbes are essential to host development and homeostasis, but less is known about host factors that may regulate the composition of this ecosystem. While evidence shows that IgA has a role in shaping this microbiota, it is likely that effector molecules of the innate immune system are also involved. One hypothesis is that gene-encoded antimicrobial peptides, key elements of innate immunity throughout nature, have an essential role in this regulation. These effector molecules characteristically have activity against a broad spectrum of bacteria and other microbes. At mucosal surfaces, antimicrobial peptides may affect the numbers and/or composition of the colonizing microbiota. In humans and other mammals, defensins are a predominant class of antimicrobial peptides. In the small intestine, Paneth cells (specialized secretory epithelial cells) produce high quantities of defensins and several other antibiotic peptides and proteins. Data from murine models indicate that Paneth cell defensins play a pivotal role in defense from food and water-borne pathogens in the intestinal lumen. Recent studies in humans provide evidence that reduced Paneth cell defensin expression may be a key pathogenic factor in ileal Crohn's disease, a subgroup of inflammatory bowel disease (IBD), and changes in the colonizing microbiota may mediate this pathogenic mechanism. It is also possible that low levels of Paneth cell defensins, characteristic of normal intestinal development, may predispose premature neonates to necrotizing enterocolitis (NEC) through similar close links with the composition of the intestinal microbiota. Future studies to further define mechanisms by which defensins and other host factors regulate the composition of the intestinal microbiota will likely provide new insights into intestinal homeostasis and new therapeutic strategies for inflammatory and infectious diseases of the bowel.},

Environmental triggers initiate or reactivate inflammation and modulate genetic susceptibility. New pathogenesis concepts include defective bacterial killing by innate immune cells in CD, colonization of the ileum in CD with functionally abnormal Escherichia coli that adhere to and invade epithelial cells and resist bacterial killing, and alterations in enteric microbiota composition in CD, UC, and pouchitis detected by molecular probes. The considerable therapeutic potential of manipulating the enteric microbiota in inflammatory bowel disease patients has not been realized, probably due to failure to recognize heterogenic disease mechanisms that require individualized use of antibiotics, probiotics, prebiotics, combination therapies, and genetically engineered bacteria to restore mucosal homeostasis.},

   abstract = {Inflammatory bowel disease, an umbrella term used for Crohn disease and ulcerative colitis, is often accompanied with the presenting symptom of diarrhea. This symptom can be a great nuisance and emotionally distressing to the individual with inflammatory bowel disease. Although the exact etiology of inflammatory bowel disease is still unknown, interactions between the host susceptibility, mucosal immunity, and intestinal microflora are thought to be major factors. One intervention that is gaining increasing support by the research and medical community is the use of probiotics, which work on the intestinal flora by altering the bacterial composition and thereby rendering the environment unfavorable to pathogenic organisms. The human response to illness model provides an ideal organizing framework to gain a comprehensive understanding of the human response of diarrhea in the inflammatory bowel disease population. By examining the physiological, pathophysiological, behavioral, and experiential perspectives as well as individual vulnerabilities, this model establishes sound rationale to guide nursing interventions to help the individual better cope with the physical and emotional effects of having diarrhea. This model also facilitates the provision of holistic and personalized care, which may include the use of probiotics to help alleviate this distressing symptom.},

   abstract = {Chronic inflammatory bowel diseases (IBD), such as Crohn's disease and ulcerative colitis, are recurrent and aggressive inflammatory disorders that are most likely the result of an overly aggressive immune response to ubiquitous intestinal antigens in a genetically susceptible host. Despite decades of intense research, our knowledge of factors causing IBD remains incomplete and, therefore, conventional therapy to induce and maintain remission works in a symptomatic fashion, merely suppressing the immune response. Probiotic bacteria have long been known to confer health benefits, especially with regard to intestinal disorders. Although there is mounting evidence from in vitro and animal experiments supporting the use of probiotics in IBD, clinical trials have not provided definite evidence for the therapeutic effect of probiotic therapy in IBD to date. This is with the notable exception of pouchitis and the maintenance of remission in ulcerative colitis, whereas Crohn's disease and active ulcerative colitis do not seem amenable to probiotic intervention. The next 5 years will see more trials targeting specific clinical settings using tailor-made probiotic combinations, taking into account our increasing knowledge of individual probiotic properties and the diversity of these microorganisms.},

   abstract = {Recently, conventional therapies for inflammatory bowel disease (IBD) have not received the same amount of attention as biologic therapies, yet they remain the backbone of therapy for IBD because of their efficacy, safety, and relatively low cost. Advances in efficacy and safety continue because of modifications in drug dosing and monitoring. Higher doses of mesalamine per pill, together with once-daily dosing, may help to optimize drug delivery and patient compliance. Budesonide, an effective agent for both induction and short-term remission maintenance in Crohn's disease, is devoid of many of the toxicities common to corticosteroids. Assessments of thiopurine methyltransferase and metabolite levels are helping to fine-tune dose optimization for the thiopurines azathioprine and 6-mercaptopurine. The oral calcineurin inhibitors tacrolimus and cyclosporine have been shown to have expanded roles in IBD, and methotrexate may be useful in some patients with refractory ulcerative colitis. Probiotics are showing promise for maintenance of remission in Crohn's disease, ulcerative colitis, and pouchitis.},

Ecological treatments including probiotics, prebiotics, and synbiotics are actively studied in Crohn's disease (CD), ulcerative colitis (UC) and pouchitis. We review herein the literature on the rational use of probiotics in IBD considering efficacy (as evaluated in randomized controlled trials), mechanisms of action and safety issues. A probiotic effect is strictly restricted to one defined strain and cannot be generalized from one to another. There is evidence of efficacy of some probiotic drugs in pouchitis (VSL#3), and in the prevention of recurrence of UC (Escherichia coli Nissle 1917). However, the evidence for efficacy of probiotic drugs in CD is still low as well as that of dietary ecological treatments. Despite an ecological (hopefully nutritional) treatment of IBD is promising, many questions remain unanswered and further clinical and fundamental studies are needed.},

   abstract = {CONTEXT: As patients look to complementary therapies for management of their diseases, it is important that the physician know the effectiveness and/or lack of effectiveness of a variety of dietary approaches/interventions. Although the pathogenesis of the inflammatory bowel diseases (ulcerative colitis and Crohn's disease) is not fully understood, many suspect that diet and various dietary factors may play a modulating role in the disease process. EVIDENCE ACQUISITION: The purpose of this article is to present some of what is known about various dietary/nutritional factors in inflammatory bowel disease, with inclusion of evidence from various studies regarding their putative effect. MedLINE was searched (1965-present) using combinations of the following search terms: diet, inflammatory bowel disease, Crohn's disease, and ulcerative colitis. Additionally, references of the articles obtained were searched to identify further potential sources of information. EVIDENCE SYNTHESIS: While much information is available regarding various dietary interventions/supplements in regard to inflammatory bowel disease, the lack of controlled trials limits broad applicability. Probiotics are one of the few interventions with promising results and controlled trials. CONCLUSION: While there are many potential and promising dietary factors that may play a role in the modulation of inflammatory bowel disease, it is prudent to await further controlled studies before broad application/physician recommendation in the noted patient population.},

This clinicopathological entity describes patients with oral lesions characterized by persistent and/or recurrent labial enlargement, ulcers, and a variety of other orofacial features, which on biopsy have lymphedema and noncaseating granulomas. The cause is idiopathic but appears to represent an abnormal immune reaction. This may be a manifestation of Crohn's disease (CD) since some patients with oral lesions develop typical bowel symptoms of CD in ensuing months to years; tooth-associated infections, sarcoidosis, food or contact allergies, and viruses have also been implicated in causing OFG. Clinical features of OFG are highly variable and sometimes so insidious that signs and symptoms are frequently not severe enough to cause alarm. The lips are most commonly involved and demonstrate a nontender, persistent swelling. Because of the relatively nonspecific clinical findings associated with granulomatous diseases, a microscopic diagnosis of granulomatous inflammation often presents a diagnostic dilemma for clinicians. We report a case of OFG of the lower lip and cheek and describe its management to add to the current body of literature on the subject.},

The control of lactose digestion phenotypically divides populations into those who can [lactase persistent (LP)] and those who cannot [lactase nonpersistent (LNP)] assimilate lactose. LNP subjects, however, can adapt to lactose intolerance through intestinal bacteria. The DF/LNP status interactions may function as disease risk modifiers. We evaluated the relationship between DF and LNP with colorectal, breast, prostate, ovarian, lung, and stomach cancer and inflammatory bowel diseases (IBD; Crohn's disease and ulcerative colitis). Yearly per capita DF consumption, LNP national prevalence, cancer mortality, and incidence of IBD were obtained from several sources. A negative binomial regression model was used to derive incremental risks. There were statistically significant (P <or= 0.05) increases in risk for colorectal and prostate cancer and ulcerative colitis with DFs and a statistically significant decreased risk for stomach cancer. There were trends (P<0.1) for lung and ovarian cancers and Crohn's disease. As LNP prevalence increased, stomach cancer risk increased, whereas risks of all other conditions decreased (P<0.01). In 3 cancers (prostate, ovarian, and breast), meta-analyses of case-based studies support ecological data. In colorectal cancer, on the contrary, meta-analyses of case-based studies suggest protection. The possible importance of distinguishing LNP/LP status in studies is discussed.},

Indirect modalities such as barium follow-through have the disadvantage of attendant radiation exposure. Capsule endoscopy, a novel wireless method of investigation of the small bowel, has acquired an important role in both adult and paediatric medicine. RECENT FINDINGS: The clinical utility of capsule endoscopy has rapidly expanded since its approval by the Food & Drug Administration in the USA in 2001. It has developed an established role in adults, in the investigation of obscure gastrointestinal bleeding, small bowel Crohn's disease, complications of coeliac disease and surveillance of polyposis syndromes. Despite a lag in its use in paediatrics, capsule endoscopy offers an accurate and effective means of investigating the small bowel in children. It has opened up new horizons and permitted a noninvasive approach to identifying occult lesions in the small bowel of children when conventional imaging has been unhelpful. SUMMARY: This review appraises the current literature to define the clinical indications and practical aspects of capsule endoscopy that are of interest to the paediatrician.},

   abstract = {Crohn's disease (CD) and ulcerative colitis (UC), collectively referred to as inflammatory bowel disease (IBD), are associated with extraintestinal manifestations (EIMs) in approximately 40% of patients. Infliximab, a chimeric monoclonal antibody to tumor necrosis factor-alpha, is effective for induction and maintenance of remission of CD and UC. The role of infliximab for EIMs related to IBD has been less studied, but it is likely as effective. The EIMs may run a course that parallels IBD activity or may present separately. The EIMs that parallel intestinal inflammation (eg, peripheral arthritis, pyoderma gangrenosum, erythema nodosum, and episcleritis) generally respond to infliximab. Therefore, treating patients with IBD who have one of these EIMs will more often than not improve the EIM. The EIMs that run a separate course from IBD are more difficult to treat. Ankylosing spondylitis (AS), uveitis, and primary sclerosing cholangitis (PSC) have variable responses to IBD medications. Infliximab is efficacious for uveitis and is approved by the US Food and Drug Administration for treatment of AS. The efficacy of infliximab for PSC is unknown. The dosing schedule of infliximab for IBD patients with EIMs should be induction doses with 5 mg/kg at 0, 2, and 6 weeks followed by every 8 weeks. Whether long-term infliximab therapy is necessary to maintain remission of EIMs, as in the case of IBD, has not been established.},

   abstract = {A decrease in the abundance and biodiversity of intestinal bacteria within the dominant phylum Firmicutes has been observed repeatedly in Crohn disease (CD) patients. In this study, we determined the composition of the mucosa-associated microbiota of CD patients at the time of surgical resection and 6 months later using FISH analysis. We found that a reduction of a major member of Firmicutes, Faecalibacterium prausnitzii, is associated with a higher risk of postoperative recurrence of ileal CD. A lower proportion of F. prausnitzii on resected ileal Crohn mucosa also was associated with endoscopic recurrence at 6 months. To evaluate the immunomodulatory properties of F. prausnitzii we analyzed the anti-inflammatory effects of F. prausnitzii in both in vitro (cellular models) and in vivo [2,4,6-trinitrobenzenesulphonic acid (TNBS)-induced] colitis in mice. In Caco-2 cells transfected with a reporter gene for NF-kappaB activity, F. prausnitzii had no effect on IL-1beta-induced NF-kappaB activity, whereas the supernatant abolished it. In vitro peripheral blood mononuclear cell stimulation by F. prausnitzii led to significantly lower IL-12 and IFN-gamma production levels and higher secretion of IL-10. Oral administration of either live F. prausnitzii or its supernatant markedly reduced the severity of TNBS colitis and tended to correct the dysbiosis associated with TNBS colitis, as demonstrated by real-time quantitative PCR (qPCR) analysis. F. prausnitzii exhibits anti-inflammatory effects on cellular and TNBS colitis models, partly due to secreted metabolites able to block NF-kappaB activation and IL-8 production. These results suggest that counterbalancing dysbiosis using F. prausnitzii as a probiotic is a promising strategy in CD treatment.},

METHODS: A total of 78 CD patients and 80 healthy controls were evaluated in respect of nutritional status, dietary intake, and life styles factors. RESULTS: These 73/78 CD patients were on immunomodulating therapies. Mean body mass index (BMI) was lower in patients as compared to controls (P= 0.006) but 32% of CD patients and 33.8% of controls had a BMI > 25, whereas 8% and 23.8% in each group, respectively, were obese (BMI > 30Kg/m(2)). Fat free mass was significantly decreased in both genders (P < 0.05) whereas fat mass was decreased only in males (P= 0.01). Energy intake was significantly lower in CD patients (P < 0.0001) and we observed significantly lower adjusted mean daily intakes of carbohydrates, monounsaturated fat, fiber, calcium, and vitamins C, D, E, and K (P < 0.05). 29% of patients had excluded grains from their usual diet, 28% milk, 18% vegetables, and 11% fruits. Milk exclusion resulted in a significantly lower consumption of calcium and vitamin K (P < 0.001) and the exclusion of vegetables was associated to a lower consumption of vitamins C and E (P < 0.05). Physical activity was significantly lower in CD patients (P= 0.01) and this lack of physical activity was inversely correlated with increased fat mass percentage (r=-0.315, P= 0.001). CONCLUSIONS: Results showed that the most prevalent form of malnutrition in CD patients was an excess of body weight, which was concomitant with an inadequate dietary intake, namely micronutrients, clearly related to dietary exclusion of certain foods.},

These conditions are often refractile to conventional treatments involving the employment of anti-inflammatory and immunosuppressant drugs, and this has led to a search for alternative therapies based on the use of probiotics, prebiotics and synbiotics. The majority of investigations in this area have been done with probiotics, and while there is increasing interest in the abilities of prebiotics and synbiotics to control the symptoms of IBD, very few randomised controlled trials have been reported. Although the results have been variable, human and animal studies have demonstrated that in many circumstances, these functional foods can alter the composition of the colonic microbiota, reduce inflammatory processes in the gut mucosa, and have the potential to induce disease remission. More work is needed to understand the effects of prebiotics and synbiotics on microbial communities in the gut, and their interactions with the host's immune system.},

Furthermore, pH and water activity values were determined for each sample. Although no viable MAP cells could be cultured, 4.2% of the raw milk cheese samples tested positive with the F57-based real-time PCR system, providing evidence for the presence of MAP in the raw material.

Abundant literature is devoted to mechanisms by which curcumin may mediate this activity. These insights have prompted investigations in which curcumin as lead molecule serves as a scaffold for synthetic chemical attempts to optimize pharmacological potency. Among the published analogues with notable efficacy are dimethylcurcumin, 1,5-bis(3-pyridyl)-1,4-pentadien-3-one and 3,5-bis-(2-fluorobenzylidene)-piperidinium-4-one acetate. Results of a small number of clinical pilot studies conducted with curcumin at doses of up to 12 g suggest tentatively that it is safe in humans. Prevention of adenoma recurrence constitutes a clinical paradigm worthy of further investigation for curcumin. Future clinical study should include measurement of mechanism-based pharmacodynamic parameters.},

   abstract = {Crohn's disease (CD) is an inflammatory disease characterized by the activation of the immune system in the gut. Since tumor necrosis factor (TNF-alpha) plays an important role in the initiation and perpetuation of intestinal inflammation in CD, we investigated whether TX 527 [19-nor-14,20-bisepi-23-yne-1,25(OH)(2)D(3)], a Vitamin D analogue, could affect peripheral blood mononuclear cells (PBMC) proliferation and exert an immunosuppressive effect on TNF-alpha production in CD patients, and whether this immunosuppressive action could be mediated by NF-kappaB down-regulation. TX 527 significantly decreased cell proliferation and TNF-alpha levels. On activation, NF-kappaB, rapidly released from its cytoplasmatic inhibitor (IKB-alpha), transmigrates into the nucleus and binds to DNA response elements in gene promoter regions. The activation of NF-kappaB, stimulated by TNF-alpha, and its nuclear translocation together with the degradation of IKB-alpha were blocked by TX 527. At the same time, NF-kappaB protein levels present in cytoplasmic extracts decreased in the presence of TNF-alpha and increased when PBMC were incubated with TX 527. The results of our studies indicate that TX 527 inhibits TNF-alpha mediated effects on PBMC and the activation of NF-kappaB and that its action is mediated by Vitamin D receptor (VDR), which is activated when the cells are stimulated with TX 527.},

   abstract = {BACKGROUND: Ghrelin, a potent orexigenic peptide produced by the stomach, may be affected by circulating inflammatory mediators. AIM: To assess the effect of an anti-TNFalpha antibody on ghrelin in patients with Crohn's disease (CD). METHODS: Fifteen patients with Crohn's receiving infliximab were studied before and 1 week after infusion. Following an overnight fast, blood was sampled before a meal and then every 20 min for 2 h. Total ghrelin and CRP were measured using ELISA. Acylated ghrelin and TNFalpha, IFNgamma, IL-1beta and IL-6 were measured with bioplex. Harvey Bradshaw Activity Index was assessed. RESULTS: Median (95% CI) 2-h integrated plasma total ghrelin increased from 162 (99-311) before infliximab to 200 (128-387) pg/mL h, (P = 0.02) after. Following infliximab, 20 min postmeal, median acylated ghrelin decreased from 50.3 (24-64) to 38.6 (26-82) pg/mL, (P = 0.04) thus reverting to a traditional meal related ghrelin curve. Median (range) disease activity decreased from 5 (2-28) before to 3 (0-22), (P = 0.0001) and Median (95% CI) TNFalpha decreased from 2.8 (1.89-4.48) to 1.31 (0.73-2.06) pg/mL (P = 0.002). CONCLUSIONS: Infliximab increases circulating total ghrelin by 25% in CD and restores the postprandial response of acylated ghrelin to food intake. Acylated and de-sacyl ghrelin remain unchanged, suggesting that an alternate isoform could be affected by infliximab.},

Antibodies to casein and ovalbumin, anti-Saccharomyces cerevisiae antibodies (ASCA), and antibodies to I2 from Pseudomonas fluorescens (anti-I2) were also examined. RESULTS: Thirty-eight percent (39/104) of the CD patients expressed anti-PPA antibodies, and this percentage was significantly higher as compared with the control group (5%, 4/83) and the UC group (9%, 8/85) (P < 0.001). A significantly higher level of anti-PPA antibodies was detected in patients with "small bowel disease-dominant" CD than in those with "colitis-dominant" CD (P < 0.05). Antibodies to casein and ovalbumin were not specifically expressed in CD patients. As ASCA was detected in 33% and anti-I2 in 46% of the CD patients, 72% of the CD patients were found positive for at least one of the three antibodies including anti-PPA antibodies. CONCLUSIONS: CD patients showed a specific antibody response to PPA, as compared with UC patients and controls. There was a significantly higher level of anti-PPA antibody in patients with "small bowel disease-dominant" CD, suggesting that dietary proteins could play a role in the inflammatory response in CD patients with small bowel disease. Anti-PPA antibodies combined with ASCA/anti-I2 may be useful for the diagnosis of CD.},

Food products, especially milk obtained from animals infected with paratuberculosis, may be a potential vector of MAP to humans, yet the detection of this pathogen poses a number of difficulties. This study was aimed at comparing the effectiveness of MAP isolation from milk samples. Mycobacteria were detected by means of two methods: direct isolation of DNA using a QIAamp DNA Mini Kit by Qiagen, and a culture method with the use of HEYM culture medium. Analyses were carried out on 87 samples of udder cow milk originating from a herd that exhibited seropositive and serodoubtful reactions against paratuberculosis. The presence of an insertion sequence IS-900 was detected in 18 samples of udder milk analyzed with the method of direct DNA isolation and in two samples analyzed by means of the culture method.},

   abstract = {BACKGROUND/AIM: Quality of life (QOL) of the patients and medical costs are important in current medical treatments, especially those for chronic diseases. We have reported the effectiveness of 'half elemental diet (ED)' as maintenance therapy for patients with Crohn's disease (CD). The aim of this study was to evaluate the QOL of CD patients and medical costs of half-ED. METHODS: Fifty-one CD patients in remission were randomly assigned to a half-ED group (n=26) or a free diet group (n=25). The primary outcome measure was the occurrence of relapse during a 2-year period. This time, we investigated the QOL of the patients and medical costs of half-ED, as secondary outcomes. QOL was evaluated using the Japanese version of the IBDQ scoring system, and medical costs were calculated monthly from the receipts. RESULTS: IBDQ score was not significantly different between the two groups at 1 and 13 months after the start of maintenance treatment. Medical costs were not significantly different between them either. This study showed that half-ED therapy did not affect the treatment of CD patients, neither regarding their QOL nor medical costs. CONCLUSION: This study has confirmed this half-ED therapy is beneficial for patients with Crohn's disease.},

Although drug therapy with agents such as corticosteroids and azathiopurine is useful, the long-term side effects of these drugs are problematic. The advent of infliximab has recently brought a change in treatment, but the long-term side effects of this agent remain uncertain. In contrast, nutritional therapy produces no drug-induced side effects and is effective in inducing and maintaining remission. However, sufficient efficacy cannot be expected in patients in whom compliance with nutritional regimens gradually decreases owing to unpalatability. In these cases, combination therapy with agents such as immunosuppressors and infliximab may be useful.},

A 1-year prospective study of 76 patients with Crohn disease was conducted. The criterion for eligibility was a Crohn Disease Activity Index score of 150 or lower for at least 1 month. The primary end point was defined as the relapse-free interval from the baseline until the first relapse. Fat intake was assessed using a validated diet history questionnaire. The degree of dietary temperance was assessed using a single-item nominal scale. The Cox proportional hazards model was used to evaluate the influence of diet. Crohn disease relapse was seen in 25 patients (33%), and 47 patients (62%) remained in continuous remission. A decreased ratio of n-6 polyunsaturated fatty acid (PUFA) to n-3PUFA (odds ratio = .38; p = .005) was associated with a poor prognosis. Dietary temperance also was significantly associated with prognosis (p = .014). More moderate dietary temperance decreased the risk of relapse (odds ratio = .22; p = .006). Effective prevention of relapse for Crohn disease patients might be achieved through moderate dietary temperance, particularly when the disease condition is unstable.},

Mycobacterial heat shock proteins are associated with a multitude of "autoimmune" diseases, including Type 1 diabetes mellitus (T1DM) and the initiating events of atherosclerosis. These heat shock proteins may come from MAP; this article postulates a causal role for MAP in multiple inflammatory and "autoimmune" diseases.},

   abstract = {Orofacial granulomatosis (OFG) is considered as an uncommon disease and nomenclature of the disease was subjected to debate for a long time. Although various aetiological agents such as food substances, food additives, dental materials and various microbiological agents have been implicated in the disease process its precise pathogenesis is yet to be elucidated. Delayed type of hypersensitivity reaction appears to play a significant role, although the exact antigen inducing the immunological reaction varies in individual patients. However, evidence for the role of genetic predisposition to the disease is sparse. The underlying immunological mechanism appears to show some similarities between OFG and Crohn's disease, emphasizing the need for more comparative studies of the two entities. Therefore, we propose the term idiopathic OFG as a better term for those cases restricted to oral region without any identifiable known granulomatous disease and the diagnosis should not be changed until the patient develops systemic manifestations of a specific granulomatous condition. This review attempts to discuss the role of different aetiological agents and certain aspects of pathogenesis of OFG.},

The immune response and inflammation are mediated by polyunsaturated fatty acids and influenced by dietary fats and lipid metabolism. This study examined the qualitative and quantitative fat intake of IBD patients and healthy controls on plasma phospholipid and erythrocyte membrane phospholipid (EMP) fatty acid content. Measurement of the fatty acid composition of plasma phospholipid and EMP were performed in 29 UC patients, 20 CD patients, and 31 healthy controls. Anthropometric characteristics and data on dietary intake were also collected. We observed significantly lower lipid intake in UC and CD patients vs controls. The UC and CD patients had significantly higher levels of linoleic acid in their EMP than did controls. There were no significant differences in the levels of n-3 polyunsaturated fatty acids, but there were significantly higher levels of the n-6 in the EMP of UC and CD patients compared with controls. The significant differences persisted after the data were adjusted for potential confounders and lipid intake. Higher levels of linoleic acids and n-6 fatty acids, which are involved in production of proinflammatory mediators, were found in IBD patients compared with controls, thereby implicating n-6 fatty acids in the pathophysiology of the disease.},

   abstract = {OBJECTIVE: This prospective, controlled, and multicentric study evaluated nutritional status, body composition, muscle strength, and quality of life in patients with inflammatory bowel disease in clinical remission. In addition, possible effects of gender, malnutrition, inflammation, and previous prednisolone therapy were investigated. METHODS: Nutritional status (subjective global assessment [SGA], body mass index, albumin, trace elements), body composition (bioelectrical impedance analysis, anthropometry), handgrip strength, and quality of life were assessed in 94 patients with Crohn's disease (CD; 61 female and 33 male, Crohn's Disease Activity Index 71 +/- 47), 50 patients with ulcerative colitis (UC; 33 female and 17 male, Ulcerative Colitis Activity Index 3.1 +/- 1.5), and 61 healthy control subjects (41 female and 20 male) from centers in Berlin, Vienna, and Bari. For further analysis of body composition, 47 well-nourished patients with inflammatory bowel disease were pair-matched by body mass index, sex, and age to healthy controls. Data are presented as median (25th-75th percentile). RESULTS: Most patients with inflammatory bowel disease (74%) were well nourished according to the SGA, body mass index, and serum albumin. However, body composition analysis demonstrated a decrease in body cell mass (BCM) in patients with CD (23.1 kg, 20.8-28.7, P = 0.021) and UC (22.6 kg, 21.0-28.0, P = 0.041) compared with controls (25.0 kg, 22.0-32.5). Handgrip strength correlated with BCM (r = 0.703, P = 0.001) and was decreased in patients with CD (32.8 kg, 26.0-41.1, P = 0.005) and UC (31.0 kg, 27.3-37.8, P = 0.001) compared with controls (36.0 kg, 31.0-52.0). The alterations were seen even in patients classified as well nourished. BCM was lower in patients with moderately increased serum C-reactive protein levels compared with patients with normal levels. CONCLUSION: In CD and UC, selected micronutrient deficits and loss of BCM and muscle strength are frequent in remission and cannot be detected by standard malnutrition screening.},

METHODS: Seventy patients with CD were enrolled prior to elective ileo-caecal resection and randomly assigned after surgery to daily treatment with either Lactobacillus johnsonii, LA1, Nestle (1010 colony-forming units, CFU) (group A, n = 34) or placebo (group B, n = 36) for 12 weeks. The primary objective was to assess the effect of LAl on the endoscopic recurrence rate at 12 weeks. Stratification was performed according to smoking status at randomization. RESULTS: Seven and 14 patients were excluded in the LA1 and placebo groups, respectively. In intention-to-treat analysis, the mean endoscopic score was not significantly different between the two treatment groups at 3 months (LA1 versus placebo: 1.50 +/- 1.32 versus 1.22+/-1.37, treatment effect: P = 0.48, smoke effect: P = 0.72). The percentage of patients with severe recurrence (i3 + i4) was 21% and 15% in the LAl and placebo groups, respectively (P = 0.33). Using a per-protocol (PP) analysis, the mean endoscopic score was not significantly different between the two treatment groups (LAl versus placebo groups: 1.44 +/-1.31 versus 1.05 +/- 1.21, P = 0.32). The percentage of patients with severe recurrence (i3 + i4) was 19% and 9% in the LAl and placebo groups, respectively (P = 0.054). Clinical relapse rate (CDAI [CD activity index] > 150, with an increase of CDAI > 70 points or greater from baseline) in the LAl and placebo groups was 15% (4/27) and 13.5% (3/22), respectively (PP analysis: chi-square test, P = 0.91 and log-rank test: P = 0.79). CONCLUSION: Oral administration of the probiotic LA1 in patients with CD failed to prevent early endoscopic recurrence at 12 weeks after ileo-caecal resection.},

We analyzed and compared the MAB in noninflamed and inflamed ileal mucosa of Crohn's disease patients (n = 22). METHODS: Tissue samples from the inflamed ileal mucosa and from the adjacent noninflamed ileal mucosa were taken from surgical resection specimens. The MAB were investigated using fluorescence in situ hybridization with 7 group-specific probes and temporal temperature gradient gel electrophoresis (TTGE). RESULTS: Samples from both noninflamed and inflamed mucosa were obtained from 15 patients. The distribution of the bacterial populations was not different between noninflamed and inflamed mucosa. The Bacteroidetes phylum was dominant and accounted for 29% of MAB (0%-74%) in noninflamed tissues and 32% (0%-70%) in inflamed areas. The gamma Proteobacteria represented 12% (0%-70%) of MAB both in noninflamed and inflamed areas. The Clostridium coccoides group (Firmicutes phylum) represented 15% of MAB in noninflamed tissues versus 7% in inflamed areas. For most of the patients the similarity index between TTGE paired profiles was very high. CONCLUSION: The dominant MAB do not differ between noninflamed and inflamed ileal mucosa in Crohn's disease. This argues against a localized dysbiosis to explain the patchy distribution of mucosal lesions.},

   abstract = {INTRODUCTION: Crohn's disease is a long-term chronic condition of the gastrointestinal tract. It is characterised by transmural, granulomatous inflammation that occurs in a discontinuous pattern, with a tendency to form fistulae. The cause is unknown but may depend on interactions between genetic predisposition, environmental triggers, and mucosal immunity. METHODS AND OUTCOMES: We conducted a systematic review and aimed to answer the following clinical questions: What are the effects of medical treatments in adults to induce remission in Crohn's disease? What are the effects of lifestyle interventions in adults with Crohn's disease to maintain remission? What are the effects of surgical interventions in adults with small-bowel Crohn's disease to induce remission? What are the effects of surgical interventions in adults with colonic Crohn's disease to induce remission? What are the effects of medical interventions to maintain remission in adults with Crohn's disease; and to maintain remission following surgery? We searched: Medline, Embase, The Cochrane Library and other important databases up to March 2006 (Clinical Evidence reviews are updated periodically, please check our website for the most up-to-date version of this review). We included harms alerts from relevant organisations such as the US Food and Drug Administration (FDA) and the UK Medicines and Healthcare products Regulatory Agency (MHRA). RESULTS: We found 60 systematic reviews, RCTs, or observational studies that met our inclusion criteria. CONCLUSIONS: In this systematic review we present information relating to the effectiveness and safety of the following interventions: aminosalicylates, antibiotics, azathioprine/mercaptopurine, ciclosporin, corticosteroids (oral), enteral nutrition, fish oil, infliximab, methotrexate, probiotics, resection, segmental colectomy, smoking cessation, and strictureplasty.},

   abstract = {BACKGROUND: The zoonotic potential of Mycobacterium avium ssp. paratuberculosis (MAP) has been debated for almost a century because of similarities between Johne's Disease (JD) in cattle and Crohn's disease (CD) in humans. Our objective was to evaluate scientific literature investigating the potential association between these two diseases (MAP and CD) and the presence of MAP in retail milk or dairy products using a qualitative systematic review. METHOD: The search strategy included 19 bibliographic databases, 8 conference proceedings, reference lists of 15 articles and contacting 28 topic-related scientists. Two independent reviewers performed relevance screening, quality assessment and data extraction stages of the review. RESULTS: Seventy-five articles were included. Among 60 case-control studies that investigated the association between MAP and CD, 37 were of acceptable quality. Twenty-three studies reported significant positive associations, 23 reported non-significant associations, and 14 did not detect MAP in any sample. Different laboratory tests, test protocols, types of samples and source populations were used in these studies resulting in large variability among studies. Seven studies investigated the association between CD and JD, two challenge trials reported contradictory results, one cross-sectional study did not support the association, and four descriptive studies suggested that isolated MAP is often closely related to cattle isolates. MAP detection in raw and pasteurized milk was reported in several studies. CONCLUSIONS: Evidence for the zoonotic potential of MAP is not strong, but should not be ignored. Interdisciplinary collaboration among medical, veterinary and other public health officials may contribute to a better understanding of the potential routes of human exposure to MAP.},

   abstract = {In 1988, Greenberg and colleagues published a large randomized controlled trial to address whether bowel rest could lead to improved disease activity in patients with active Crohn's disease. The results of this study provide substantial evidence that bowel rest is not necessary to achieve remission in patients with active Crohn's disease receiving nutrition support. Before this study, great controversy existed about the use of nutrition support and bowel rest in the treatment of active Crohn's disease because of a limited number of conflicting studies providing evidence for and against its application. The results of the publication by Greenberg et al are fundamental because they helped to settle this important argument. Furthermore, this pivotal paper changed the clinical guidelines for the use of nutrition support in the management of active Crohn's disease. Since the publication of this pivotal article, many developments in the field of nutrition and in the treatment of Crohn's disease have helped validate and further its results. Subsequent studies and debate center on the use of enteral nutrition as primary treatment in patients with active Crohn's disease. Data regarding the efficacy, composition, and overall role of adult enteral nutrition in the management of Crohn's disease are presented. This article revisits the Greenberg paper and discusses some of these innovations in nutrition.},

   abstract = {Crohn's disease is a chronic inflammatory condition with a relapsing-remitting disease course. Treatment often requires both induction and maintenance strategies. The management of mild to moderate Crohn's disease is challenging because the natural history of mild disease is not known and effective treatment options are limited. In this article, our objective is to provide a brief overview of the evidence supporting current therapies in the treatment of mild to moderate luminal Crohn's disease and to explore a few of the newer therapeutic options. As induction agents for mild to moderately active Crohn's disease, there is reasonable evidence to support the use of budesonide for terminal ileal and right colonic disease, and sulfasalazine for colonic disease. Although budesonide can be used in the short term (3-6 months) for maintenance of quiescent disease, there are no effective therapies for the long-term maintenance of mild to moderate Crohn's disease. Mesalazine appears to have no role in either the treatment of active or quiescent disease. Currently, there is insufficient data to draw conclusions on the potential role of antibacterials, probiotics or prebiotics.},

The aim of this prospective study was to investigate the impacts of long-term enteral nutrition on clinical and endoscopic disease activities and mucosal tissue cytokines in patients with quiescent CD. METHODS: Forty patients with CD who achieved clinical remission were included. Of these, 20 received continuous elemental diet (Elental) infusion during the nighttime and a low-fat diet during the daytime (EN group) and 20 received neither nutritional therapy nor food restriction (non-EN group). With these regimens, all 40 patients were monitored for 1 year. Further, ileocolonoscopy was performed at entry, at 6 and 12 months, and mucosal biopsies were taken for cytokine assays. RESULTS: On an intention-to-treat basis, 5 patients (25%) in the EN group and 13 (65%) in the non-EN group had a clinical relapse during the 1-year observation (P = 0.03). The mean endoscopic inflammation (EI) scores were not significantly different between the groups at both entry and 6 months, but at 12 months EI scores were significantly higher in the non-EN group than in the EN group (P = 0.04). Additionally, the mucosal tissue interleukin (IL)-1beta, IL-6, and tumor necrosis factor (TNF)-alpha levels significantly increased with time in the non-EN group (entry versus 12 months, IL-1beta, P = 0.02; IL-6, P = 0.002; TNF-alpha, P = 0.001). In the EN group these cytokines did not show a significant increase. CONCLUSIONS: Long-term enteral nutrition in patients with quiescent CD has a clear suppressive effect on clinical and endoscopic disease activities and the mucosal inflammatory cytokine levels.},

AIM: To investigate the impact of enteral nutrition using an elemental diet on clinical and endoscopic recurrence after resection for Crohn's disease. METHODS: Forty consecutive patients who underwent resection for ileal or ileocolonic Crohn's disease were studied. After operation, 20 patients continuously received enteral nutritional therapy (EN group), and 20 had neither nutritional therapy nor food restriction (non-EN group). In the EN group, enteral formula (Elental) was infused through a nasogastric tube in the night-time, and low fat foods were taken in the daytime. All patients were followed up regularly for 1 year after operation. Ileocolonoscopy was performed at 6 and 12 months after operation. RESULTS: One patient (5%) in the EN group and seven (35%) in the non-EN group developed clinical recurrence during 1-year follow-up (P = 0.048). Six months after operation, five patients (25%) in the EN group and eight (40%) in the non-EN group developed endoscopic recurrence (P = 0.50). Twelve months after operation, endoscopic recurrence was observed in six patients (30%) in the EN group and 14 (70%) in the non-EN group (P = 0.027).

The former is the most immediate line of response to immunologic challenges presented by bacteria, viruses, and fungi. The mucosal immune system has evolved to balance the need to respond to pathogens while co-existing with commensal bacteria and food antigens. In inflammatory bowel disease (IBD), this hyporesponsiveness or tolerance breaks down and inflammation supervenes driven by the intestinal microbial flora. Bacteria contain compounds and are recognized by a variety of receptors, including Toll-like receptors (TLRs) and NODs (a family of intracellular bacterial sensors) and are potent stimuli of innate immune responses. Several mutations in these receptors have been associated with development of IBD.},

   abstract = {BACKGROUND: The role of enteral nutrition in Crohn's disease is controversial. Increasing research on the mechanisms by which nutritional therapy improves the clinical well being of patients with Crohn's disease has led to novel formula design and trials comparing two different forms of enteral nutrition. This meta-analysis aims to provide an update on the existing effectiveness data for both corticosteroids versus enteral nutrition and for one form of enteral nutrition versus another for inducing remission of active Crohn's disease. OBJECTIVES: To evaluate the effectiveness of exclusive enteral nutrition (EN) as primary therapy to induce remission in Crohn's disease and to examine the importance of formula composition on effectiveness. SEARCH STRATEGY: Studies were selected using a computer-assisted search of the on-line bibliographic databases MEDLINE (1966-2006) and EMBASE (1984-2006), as well as the Science Citation Index on Web of Science. Additional citations were sought by manual search of references of articles retrieved from the computerized search, abstracts submitted to major gastroenterologic meetings and published in the journals: American Journal of Gastroenterology, Gut, Gastroenterology, Journal of Pediatric Gastroenterology and Nutrition, and Journal of Parenteral and Enteral Nutrition, and from the reviewers' personal files or contact with leaders in the field. SELECTION CRITERIA: All randomized and quasi-randomized controlled trials involving patients with active Crohn's disease defined by a clinical disease activity index were considered for review. Studies evaluating the administration of one type of enteral nutrition to one group of patients and another type of enteral nutrition or conventional corticosteroids to the other group were selected for review. DATA COLLECTION AND ANALYSIS: Data were extracted independently by two authors and any discrepancies were resolved by rereading and discussion. For the dichotomous variable, achievement of remission, individual and pooled trial statistics were calculated as odds ratios (OR) with 95% confidence intervals (CI); both fixed and random effect models were used. The results for each analysis were tested for heterogeneity using the chi square statistic. The studies were separated into two groups: A. one form of enteral nutrition compared with another form of enteral nutrition and B. one form of enteral nutrition compared with corticosteroids. Subgroup analyses were conducted on the basis of clinical or disease criteria and formula composition. Sensitivity analyses were conducted on the basis of the inclusion of abstract publications, methodologic quality and by random or fixed effects models. MAIN RESULTS: In part A, of the 15 included eligible trials (one abstract) comparing different formulations of EN for the treatment of active CD, 11 compared one (or more) elemental formula to a non-elemental one, three compared enteral diets of similar protein composition but different fat composition, and one compared non-elemental diets differing only in glutamine enrichment. Meta-analysis of ten trials comprising 334 patients demonstrated no difference in the efficacy of elemental versus non-elemental formulas (OR 1.10; 95% CI 0.69 to 1.75). Subgroup analyses performed to evaluate the different types of elemental and non-elemental diets (elemental, semi-elemental and polymeric) showed no statistically significant differences. Further analysis of seven trials including 209 patients treated with EN formulas of differing fat content (low fat: < 20 g/1000 kCal versus high fat: > 20 g/1000 kCal) demonstrated no statistically significant difference in efficacy (OR 1.13; 95% CI 0.63 to 2.01). Similarly, the effect of very low fat content (< 3 g/1000 kCal) or type of fat (long chain triglycerides) were investigated, but did not demonstrate a difference in efficacy in the treatment of active CD, although a non significant trend was demonstrated favoring very low fat and very low long chain triglyceride content. This result should be interpreted with caution due to statistically significant heterogeneity and small sample size. Sensitivity analyses had no significant effects on the results. The role of specific fatty acids or disease characteristics on response to therapy could not be evaluated. In part B, eight trials (including two abstracts) comparing enteral nutrition to steroid therapy met the inclusion criteria for review. Meta-analysis of six trials that included 192 patients treated with enteral nutrition and 160 treated with steroids yielded a pooled OR of 0.33 favouring steroid therapy (95% CI 0.21 to 0.53). A sensitivity analysis including the abstracts resulted in an increase in the number of participants to 212 in the enteral nutrition group and 179 in the steroid group but the meta-analysis yielded a similar result (OR 0.36; 95% CI 0.23 to 0.56). There were inadequate data from full publications to perform further subgroup analyses by age, disease duration and disease location. AUTHORS' CONCLUSIONS: Corticosteroid therapy is more effective than enteral nutrition for inducing remission of active Crohn's disease as was found in previous systematic reviews. Protein composition does not influence the effectiveness of EN in the treatment of active CD. A non significant trend favouring very low fat and/or very low long chain triglyceride content exists but larger trials are required to explore the significance of this finding.},

   abstract = {AIM: As healthcare providers for Crohn's disease, we assume that we have a good understanding of the disease progression and its symptoms. The aim of this study was to gather information about what patients with Crohn's disease think are relevant to their symptoms and what helps them cope with this lifelong benign disease. MATERIALS AND METHODS: A questionnaire was sent to all patients with a diagnosis of Crohn's disease seen in the Digestive Disease Center in the last 5 years. The returned forms were downloaded into a database and sent for analysis. RESULTS: Sixty-two percent of respondents were female. One third were between the ages of 35 and 50 years. Seventy percent were married. Thirty-eight percent had a graduate degree, 19% were unemployed. Fifty percent still smoked, half of them less than one pack a day. Sixty-eight percent said that their symptoms affected work, and one fourth changed jobs due to this. Foods worsened symptoms in 60%, with a decrease in symptoms while on low fiber foods and white meats. Lifestyle change worsened symptoms in 66%. A change in the caregiver was not a significant stressor. More than half used Remicade, with one third stating that it was helpful. Eight percent had never used steroids. Alcohol increased symptoms in 40%. Factors that did not cause a significant change were children at any age, pregnancy, menopause, and hormone replacement therapy. Surgery caused half the patients to improve for many years, although one third felt a lowered self-esteem postoperatively. CONCLUSION: Patients with Crohn's disease should be managed in a more comprehensive manner to provide optimal care. Thus, a team approach that includes a dietician and counselor should be considered as an integral part of this team. This will allow patients to have enhanced skills to cope with changes in their symptoms, whether they are due to the disease itself or the changes in their routine.},
