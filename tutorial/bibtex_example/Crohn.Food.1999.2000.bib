   abstract = {BACKGROUND: Glutamine is traditionally considered a nonessential amino acid but may be conditionally essential in patients with catabolic conditions. Glutamine-supplemented foods in these patients have been shown to prevent deterioration of gut permeability, protect against the development of intestinal mucosal atrophy, and improve nitrogen balance. Animal models of inflammatory bowel disease suggest that glutamine-enriched enteral diets may lead to less severe intestinal damage, less weight loss, improved nitrogen balance, and reduced disease activity. The purpose of the current study was to compare the efficacy of a glutamine-enriched polymeric diet with a standard low-glutamine polymeric diet in the treatment of active Crohn's disease. METHODS: Eighteen children with active Crohn's disease were randomly assigned to receive a 4-week course of either a standard polymeric diet with a low glutamine content (4% of amino acid composition; group S) or a glutamine-enriched polymeric diet (42% of amino acid composition; Group G). The two diets were isocaloric and isonitrogenous with an identical essential amino acid profile. Remission rates were analysed on an intent-to-treat basis. Changes in clinical and laboratory parameters of disease activity were also compared after 4 weeks of nutritional treatment. RESULTS: Two of the children, both in group G, were withdrawn from the trial because of nontolerance of the diet. There was no difference between the two groups in proportion of patients achieving remission (intent-to-treat basis): 5 (55.5%) of 9 in group S versus 4 (44.4%) of 9 in group G (p = 0.5). Improvement in mean paediatric Crohn's disease activity index (PCDAI) was significantly more in group S (p = 0.002) but changes in orosomucoid level, platelet count, and weight were not different between the groups. CONCLUSIONS: The findings suggest that a glutamine-enriched polymeric diet offers no advantage over a standard low-glutamine polymeric diet in the treatment of active Crohn's disease. Rather, it appears to be less effective in improving PCDAI. The reported beneficial effects of glutamine seen in many catabolic states must be viewed with caution when extrapolating to the management of Crohn's disease.},

   abstract = {BACKGROUND: Focus group meetings were held with two groups, each containing 12 children with Crohn's disease aged 8 to 12 and 12 to 17 years. The children were asked broad questions about how Crohn's disease and its treatment affected their lives. To explore these areas in more detail, an 88-item questionnaire was developed and read to an additional 16 of 20 children with Crohn's disease selected at random from outpatients. At first, many of the children denied that Crohn's disease affected their lives at all, but it soon became apparent that many were frustrated or angry about physical symptoms, lack of understanding about Crohn's disease, unpleasant investigations, treatment, and hospitalisation. METHODS: The questionnaire covered six domains of health-related quality of life including symptoms and treatment, social, emotional, family, educational, and future aspects. RESULTS: Elemental diet was the preferred treatment, although surgery was more effective in controlling symptoms. Children receiving steroids had more depressive symptoms. Absenteeism from school and inability to engage in school sports, swimming, and running were frequent problems. There were also difficulties with taking holidays and staying at friends' houses. Worry was reported in 14 of 16 children, anger and frustration and feeling fed up in 12 of 16. CONCLUSIONS: In addition to being a symptomatically disabling condition, Crohn's disease has a great impact on the health-related quality of life of affected children. Future studies of treatment in children with inflammatory bowel disease should include an attempt to assess the impact on the child's health-related quality of life.},

This study was designed to evaluate diet-induced thermogenesis and substrate oxidation in patients with Crohn's disease. Twenty-three patients (17 women, 6 men; age 34 +/- 2 y) and 17 healthy control subjects (13 women, 4 men; age 36 +/- 3 y) were studied. Resting energy expenditure and fasting substrate oxidation were measured by indirect calorimetry in the morning after an overnight fast. After a standard homogenized test meal (10 kcal/kg), indirect calorimetry was performed every 30 min for 3 h to measure the diet-induced thermogenesis and the postprandial substrate oxidation. In the fasting state, resting energy expenditure was significantly higher in patients than in control subjects (1433 +/- 43 versus 1279 +/- 53 kcal/24 h). Lipid oxidation was higher in patients with Crohn's disease than in control subjects (1.17 +/- 0. 07 versus 0.61 +/- 0.11 mg. kg(-1). min(-1), P < 0.01). Postprandially, diet-induced thermogenesis was significantly lower in patients with Crohn's disease than in control subjects (4.6% +/- 0.5 versus 6.3% +/- 0.5 of energy intake, P < 0.01). Lipid oxidation was significantly higher in patients with Crohn's disease than in control subjects (0.78 +/- 0.05 versus 0.56 +/- 0.08 mg. kg(-1). min(-1), P < 0.05), and glucose oxidation was lower in patients with Crohn's disease than in control subjects. In patients with Crohn's disease, lipid oxidation positively correlates with the disease activity evaluated by the Crohn's Disease Activity Index (r = 0.48, P150), fasting and postprandial lipid oxidation was significantly higher than in patients with inactive Crohn's disease (P < 0.05). In conclusion, patients with Crohn's disease have increased fat oxidation, which correlates with disease activity and this may explain the reduced fat stores in patients with Crohn's disease.},

   abstract = {Crohn's disease in childhood is a chronic relapsing condition with a high morbidity. Growth failure is common. The aim of therapy is to induce and then maintain disease remission and thereby promote well-being and normal growth and development. Enteral nutrition (either polymeric or elemental) is effective and used as initial therapy. This is employed as sole therapy over a 6- to 8-week period followed by a period of controlled food reintroduction. The relapse rate is high and further courses of enteral nutrition or alternative therapies are frequently required. Corticosteroids are also effective as initial therapy and are required in difficult cases but there are problems with their long term use, particularly their adverse effects on growth. Many patients develop either corticosteroid-dependent or corticosteroid-resistant disease. In this instance, additional immunosuppression, such as azathioprine, can be used. Surgery is required for those patients with disease resistant to medical therapy and this will result in remission; however, the relapse rate with surgery is high. There are many areas for future research. Very little is known about why enteral nutrition works, how long it should be given or its role as maintenance therapy. Newer immunosuppressive strategies based on cytokine modulation may be helpful in children once more experience is gained from their use in adults.},

The first evidence of the importance of dietary intake of n-3 polyunsaturated fatty acids was derived from epidemiologic observations of the low incidence of inflammatory bowel disease in Eskimos. The aim of this paper was to briefly review the literature on the use of n-3 fatty acids in inflammatory bowel disease (ulcerative colitis and Crohn disease), the results of which are controversial. The discrepancies between studies may reside in the different study designs used as well as in the various formulations and dosages used, some of which may lead to a high incidence of side effects. Choosing a formulation that lowers the incidence of side effects, selecting patients carefully, and paying strict attention to experimental design are critical when investigating further the therapeutic potential of these lipids in inflammatory bowel disease.},

   abstract = {There have frequently been doubts as to the relevance of food allergy, in particular as far as the involvement of the intestinal tract is concerned. Several studies, however, have confirmed the existence of allergic reactions in the gut, with an estimated prevalence of about 1-2% in adults. Clinical symptoms are unspecific and include nausea, vomiting, abdominal pain, cramping and diarrhea. Intestinal mast cells, as well as intestinal eosinophils, have been shown to be involved in the pathogenesis of food-allergy-related enteropathy. In addition to classical IgE-dependent degranulation, further agonists have been demonstrated for mast cell activation, for example IL-4. The methods used to confirm the diagnosis of intestinal allergy are still insufficient. Until now, blinded oral challenge procedures with food antigens have been accepted as the 'gold standard' in diagnosing food allergy, although these tests have practical problems. Therefore, new test systems have been developed, such as endoscopic provocation tests, that may improve diagnostic procedures. Elimination diet still presents the main basis of therapy. Aspects to be focused on in the future are the role fo IgE-independent allergic mechanisms in intestinal allergy, the impact of cross-reactivity with other allergens and the relationship to other inflammatory bowel diseases such as Crohn's disease, ulcerative colitis, celiac disease and irritable bowel syndrome.},

   abstract = {BACKGROUND: Antisecretory factor (AF), a 41 kDa cloned and sequenced protein, suppresses intestinal inflammation and hypersecretion in animals. Endogenous AF production can be induced by dietary modifications in several animal species, and this feed has been shown to reduce the incidence of diarrhoeal disease in weaning piglets. The role of AF in intestinal disease in humans is not known. AIMS: To study the effects of hydrothermally processed cereals, optimised for AF induction in animals, added to the diet of patients with longstanding symptoms of inflammatory bowel disease (IBD). PATIENTS: Fifty three patients with IBD (ulcerative colitis and Crohn's disease) were entered into the study, and 50 completed follow up. The experimental group consisted of 16 females (mean age 50 (SEM 5) years) and 10 males (41 (4) years) and the placebo group of 12 women (41 (4) years old) and 12 men (51 (5) years). METHODS: Patients were randomised to receive either hydrothermally processed cereals (active treatment) or the same amount of ordinary cereals (placebo treatment) for four weeks in a double blind study design. Baseline diet and medications remained unchanged. Bowel symptoms, plasma levels of AF, and colonic biopsies were evaluated before and after treatment. RESULTS: The active treatment significantly improved subjective ratings of clinical symptoms and increased plasma AF levels compared with placebo. Plasma lipid levels were unaffected. CONCLUSION: Hydrothermally processed cereals can induce AF production in human IBD. This increase in endogenous AF activity is associated with clinical improvement. Further studies are warranted to clarify the exact role of AF in human intestinal disease.},

Thirty-two retail health food stores were surveyed on the nature of the information provided by their staff. A research assistant visited the stores and presented as the mother of a child in whom Crohn's disease had been diagnosed. Seventy-two per cent (23 of 32) of store employees offered advice, such as to take nutritional and herbal supplements. Of the 23 stores where recommendations were made, 15 (65%) based their recommendation on a source of information. Fourteen of the 15 stores using information sources used the same reference book. This had a significant impact on the recommendations; the use of nutritional supplements was favoured. In conclusion, retail health food stores are not as inconsistent as hypothesized, although there are many variances in the types of supplements recommended for the same chronic disease.},

STUDY DESIGN: A case-control study. SUBJECTS: Forty CD patients with inactive disease were randomly divided into two groups. Group A (10 men; aged 33.9+/-7.2 years; BMI, 21.8+/-1.7 kg/m2) received a conventional polymeric enteral diet, while group B (10 men; aged 35.6+/-6.8 years; BMI, 21.4+/-1.8 kg/m2) was administered a soy-rich and lactose-free polymeric diet, over a 4-week period. METHODS: All the patients had a clinical and laboratory examination. Body composition was assessed by isotopic dilution and resting metabolic rate (RMR), and substrate oxidation rates were measured by indirect calorimetry. RESULTS: Body weight significantly increased after treatment in both groups (A, P<0.05; and B, P<0.01), as well as fat-free mass (A, P<0.05; and B, P<0.05) and fat mass (A, P<0.05; and B, P<0.01). RMR slightly increased, although it did not reach statistical significance. Treatment did not influence substrate oxidation rates. Group B lactose-intolerant patients reported a greater compliance-to-treatment than those in group A. CONCLUSIONS: This study showed that a polymeric enteral diet rich in vegetable protein and not containing milk protein, eaten at home, with no need for positioning a nasogastric tube, significantly improved body composition in inactive and lactose-intolerant CD patients, with no effect on energy metabolism, suggesting that it could be useful in improving nutritional status in these patients.},

However, performing gastrointestinal manometry in these subjects without a previous exhaustive diagnostic evaluation is unjustified. Twelve children (median age: 7.0 years; range: 8 months-13 years), with clinical and x-ray features suggesting chronic intestinal pseudoobstruction, were referred to our unit for gastrointestinal manometry. The latter was performed with a perfused catheter for 5 hr in the fasting state and for 90 min after feeding. Data were compared with those recorded in eight age-matched controls. In all patients and controls, interdigestive motor complexes with propagated phases III were detected; a regular postprandial antroduodenal motor activity was also recorded. Patients and controls did not differ for fed antral and duodenal motility indexes, fed antroduodenal coordination, and length of duodenal phase III. Most of the patients showed short or prolonged bursts of nonpropagated activity in the fasting and/or fed states; in four cases fasting and/or fed sustained phasic activity was recorded. Manometric evidence of migrating motor complexes and postfeeding activity did not support the diagnosis of intestinal pseudoobstruction and suggested redirecting the diagnostic evaluation. Final diagnoses were: Munchausen syndrome-by-proxy (four cases), celiac disease (two cases), intestinal malrotation (two cases), Crohn's disease (two cases), multiple food intolerance (one case), and congenital chloride-losing diarrhea (one case). It is concluded that in children with suspected chronic intestinal pseudoobstruction manometric evidence of migrating motor complexes and fed motor activity excludes an enteric neuromuscular disorder and suggests a reassessment of the diagnostic work-up. Furthermore, if gastrointestinal manometry shows migrating motor complexes and postfeeding motor activity, qualitative abnormalities of the manometric tracings do not indicate an underlying enteric neuromuscular disorder and must not be overemphasized. Patients referred for gastrointestinal manometry should previously undergo an extensive diagnostic investigation to exclude disorders mimicking chronic intestinal pseudoobstruction.},

   abstract = {Slow release oral mesalazine (Pentasa) contains microgranules covered by a semipermeable ethylcellulose membrane. The microgranules continuously release their content from duodenum to ileum in a pH- and time-dependent way. About 75% of the microgranules pass into the colon, where further release is slower. This release pattern does not appear to be affected by food, diarrhoea or the simultaneous use of H2 antagonists. Rectal forms of mesalazine deliver active drug directly to the rectum and left colon. Plasma concentrations of mesalazine and its metabolite acetyl-5-aminosalicylic acid after oral or local administration are the result of systemic absorption and hepatic metabolism by N-acetyltransferase. Most studies report maximal plasma concentrations of less than 1 mg/L after oral administration of slow release mesalazine, much lower than those observed after uncoated mesalazine but generally higher than after azo-bound drugs such as sulfasalazine. Urinary recovery is an indicator of absorption and metabolism, and is lower after rectal administration (10 to 30%) than after oral administration (30 to 40%). Faecal recovery after oral administration of slow or delayed release mesalazine is lower than with azo-bound drugs. Mesalazine acts locally after absorption by colonic and ileal mucosa. Mean steady-state concentrations of 25.7+/-2.2 microg/kg wet weight are found in ileocolonic biopsy specimens from patients with irritable bowel syndrome treated for 1 week with slow release mesalazine 1.5 g/day. Intramucosal concentrations after slow release mesalazine differ little between healthy individuals and patients with inflammatory bowel disease. Although significant differences are found between the various aminosalicylates in release patterns and the resulting pharmacokinetic parameters, no differences in therapeutic effects have been found in comparative studies. High doses of oral mesalazine (2 to 4 g/day) are more effective than lower doses in the treatment of patients with mild to moderate active ulcerative colitis. High doses (4 g/day) are also effective in the treatment of Crohn's disease, predominantly in patients with ileitis. In contrast, no dose ranging effects were demonstrated with local treatment forms: mesalazine 1g enema seems sufficient for patients with distal colitis. Higher serum concentrations and urinary recoveries after the administration of slow or delayed release mesalazine compared with azo-bound drugs suggest a higher risk for renal adverse effects, although the reported occurrence is extremely low. Although preliminary data support an association between mucosal concentrations of mesalazine and its clinical activity, further studies are needed to correlate the effects of this drug with its pharmacokinetic parameters.},

   abstract = {BACKGROUND: Anisakis simplex is a parasite of fish, and in the case of human infestation, it should be considered as a possible cause of gastrointestinal disease, especially in countries where raw or undercooked fish is a frequent food. Clinical features of anisakiasis may simulate acute abdominal pain, such as that found in patients with gastric ulcers, appendicitis, and Crohn's disease. Furthermore, many cases of anisakiasis are diagnosed as eosinophilic gastroenteritis, which is a broad term for a specific disease. OBJECTIVE: The purpose of this study was to investigate the immunopathogenesis of human gastrointestinal infestation by A simplex. METHODS: Thirteen intestinal biopsy specimens from patients with anisakiasis were analyzed for the presence of messenger (m)RNA for different cytokines and inflammatory mediators by RT-PCR. Specific IgE, eosinophil cationic protein, eosinophil protein X, and tryptase levels were measured in each patient's serum. Also, cell cultures were set up with lymphocytes from some patients and stimulated in vitro with Anisakis and Ascaris antigens. RESULTS: We performed immunologic phenotyping in 13 patients. All patients underwent biopsy after emergency surgery caused by episodes of acute abdominal pain. In all cases inflammatory infiltrate composed of eosinophils and lymphocytes was found in the intestinal wall. We demonstrated that after infestation, a T(H2)-type immune response occurred. Also, major basic protein, nitric oxide, and eotaxin were found in the tissue, and eosinophil cationic protein and eosinophil protein X levels were elevated in sera. CONCLUSION: These data and in vitro lymphocyte cultures indicate that a T(H2) mechanism plays an important role in the inflammatory infiltrate produced by the anchorage of parasites in the gastrointestinal wall.},

   abstract = {Human breast milk is rich in nutrients, hormones, growth factors and immunoactive molecules, which influence the growth, development and immune status of the newborn infant. Although several of these factors are also present in bovine milk, the greater susceptibility of the formula-fed infant to infection and disease and the development of allergy is often attributed to the reduced level of protective factors in milk formulas. Nevertheless, modifying manufacturing processes may preserve the biological activity of some bioactive molecules in end products. Transforming growth factor (TGF)-beta is one such molecule. TGF-beta is a polypeptide, which has been described in both human and bovine milk. It is implicated in many processes, including epithelial cell growth and differentiation, development, carcinogenesis and immune regulation. The present article discusses the biological activity of TGF-beta2 that has been preserved and activated in a cow's milk-based product. More specifically, it addresses possible mechanisms of action in the intestinal lumen and speculates on how milk products containing naturally occurring TGF-beta2 could be exploited in functional foods for the infant or as therapies for specific intestinal diseases.},

Specific infectious agents or antigens inducing or perpetuating inflammation, however, are not known. Recent results in contrast support the hypothesis, that the normal intestinal flora plays a central role in the pathogenesis of both diseases. Studies performed with E. coli Nissle 1917 demonstrated that this bacterium can positively affect the course of disease in UC and CD patients. The clinical efficacy of probiotics can yield valuable information about disease pathogenesis and, as a modification of current standard therapy, opens new and interesting therapeutic alternatives.},

   abstract = {BACKGROUND: Although enteral nutrition is a recognized form of treatment for intestinal Crohn's disease, there are persisting problems with feed palatability and only limited data as to its mode of action. AIM: To assess the effects of a specific oral polymeric diet (CT3211; Nestle, Vevey, Switzerland), which is rich in transforming growth factor beta2, on the mucosal inflammatory process. METHODS: Twenty-nine consecutive children with active intestinal Crohn's disease were treated with CT3211 as the sole source of nutrition for 8 weeks. Patients were assessed clinically, and endoscopically, whilst cytokine mRNA was measured in mucosal biopsies before and after treatment by quantitative reverse transcriptase polymerase chain reaction. RESULTS: After 8 weeks 79% of children were in complete clinical remission. Macroscopic and histological healing in the terminal ileum and colon was associated with a decline in ileal and colonic interleukin-1beta mRNA (pre-treatment to post-treatment ratio 0.008 and 0.06: P < 0.001, P = 0.006). In the ileum there was also a fall in interferon gamma mRNA (ratio 0.15, P < 0.001) with a rise in transforming growth factor beta1 mRNA (ratio 10, P = 0.04), whilst in the colon interleukin-8 mRNA fell with treatment (ratio 0.06, P < 0.05). CONCLUSIONS: The clinical response to oral polymeric diet CT3211 is associated with mucosal healing and a down regulation of mucosal pro-inflammatory cytokine mRNA in both the terminal ileum and colon. In the ileum there was also an increase in transforming growth factor beta1 mRNA.},

In general, the majority of the patients with ulcerative colitis and uncomplicated Crohn's disease can ingest a normal diet that is well balanced and without any restrictions. The intolerance to specific foods is rare in Crohn's disease and the application of exclusion diets in a routine manner is not indicated. When the nutritional status cannot be adequately maintained with normal ingestion, the use of artificial nutrition is indicated. Enteral nutrition is the first choice nutritional support system if the gastrointestinal tract is accessible and at least partially functional. In Crohn's disease enteral nutrition could have a specific anti-inflammatory effect ("primary treatment"), and it has been suggested that this could be effective to induce the clinical remission of the activity bouts of the disease. Some types of dietary fiber could be effective in the treatment of ulcerative colitis. Initial studies suggest their usefulness in maintaining the remission of the disease.},

Because colonic fermentation of Plantago ovata seeds (dietary fiber) yields butyrate, the aim of this study was to assess the efficacy and safety of Plantago ovata seeds as compared with mesalamine in maintaining remission in ulcerative colitis. METHODS: An open label, parallel-group, multicenter, randomized clinical trial was conducted. A total of 105 patients with ulcerative colitis who were in remission were randomized into groups to receive oral treatment with Plantago ovata seeds (10 g b.i.d.), mesalamine (500 mg t.i.d.), and Plantago ovata seeds plus mesalamine at the same doses. The primary efficacy outcome was maintenance of remission for 12 months. RESULTS: Of the 105 patients, 102 were included in the final analysis. After 12 months, treatment failure rate was 40% (14 of 35 patients) in the Plantago ovata seed group, 35% (13 of 37) in the mesalamine group, and 30% (nine of 30) in the Plantago ovata plus mesalamine group. Probability of continued remission was similar (Mantel-Cox test, p = 0.67; intent-to-treat analysis). Therapy effects remained unchanged after adjusting for potential confounding variables with a Cox's proportional hazards survival analysis. Three patients were withdrawn because of the development of adverse events consisting of constipation and/or flatulence (Plantago ovata seed group = 1 and Plantago ovata seed plus mesalamine group = 2). A significant increase in fecal butyrate levels (p = 0.018) was observed after Plantago ovata seed administration. CONCLUSIONS: Plantago ovata seeds (dietary fiber) might be as effective as mesalamine to maintain remission in ulcerative colitis.},

Knowledge of the nutritional status in patients with recently diagnosed IBD is limited. The aim of this study was to establish a comprehensive picture of the nutritional status in recently diagnosed IBD patients. SUBJECTS: Sixty-nine IBD patients (23 Crohn's disease (CD) and 46 with ulcerative colitis (UC)) within 6 months of diagnosis and 69 age- and sex-matched population controls were included in the study. METHODS: The nutritional status was assessed by: (1) body composition (anthropometry and dual-energy X-ray absorptiometry); (2) dietary intake (dietary history); (3) biochemical indexes of nutrition; and (4) muscle strength (isokinetic dynamometer). RESULTS: Body weight and body mass index were significantly lower in UC patients compared with controls. The mean daily intake of carbohydrates was significantly higher in CD patients and the intakes of protein, calcium, phosphorus, and riboflavin were significantly lower in UC patients compared with controls, respectively. Serum concentrations of several nutrients (beta-carotene, magnesium, selenium and zinc) were significantly lower in UC patients compared with controls. Serum vitamin B12 concentration was significantly lower in CD patients. Muscle strength did not significantly differ between IBD patients and controls. CONCLUSIONS: This study showed that the nutritional status of IBD patients was already affected negatively at time of diagnosis. It needs to be elucidated whether nutritional supplementation in recently diagnosed IBD patients may improve the clinical course of the disease.},

   abstract = {BACKGROUND: Inflammatory bowel disease (IBD) is a chronic inflammatory process, the aetiology of which remains unknown. Nutrition may play an important role in the pathogenesis and treatment of IBD. The evidence regarding the role of specific dietary components in the pathogenesis of IBD is still inconclusive. Many studies have been subject to methodological limitations; studies of better design are necessary to confirm the hypothesis that nutritional factors may indeed play a role in the development of IBD. Several studies have reported nutritional and functional deficiencies in IBD patients, especially in Crohn's disease. It is, however, hard to discriminate between disease-induced and malnutrition-induced changes in nutritional parameters. Maintaining adequate nutritional status has been suggested to be beneficial to the course of the disease in IBD. Studies have provided further insight into the possible beneficial effects of nutritional supplementation as primary and adjunctive therapy in IBD. The effects of specific nutritional therapy may be caused by alterations in intestinal flora and hence in the production of intraluminal proinflammatory substances. Immunonutrients such as n-3 fatty acids and antioxidants may also play a role in the treatment of IBD. In this paper, the relation between nutritional aetiological factors, nutritional status and nutritional therapy is discussed in detail.},

   abstract = {OBJECTIVES: Fatty acid metabolism is involved in the immune response and inflammation processes in patients with Crohn's disease (CD). Fatty acid changes may be relevant to the clinical course of the disease. The aim of this study was to compare the qualitative and quantitative fat intake and fatty acid composition of plasma phospholipids and adipose tissue in a defined population of CD patients with those in matched controls. METHODS: Dietary fat intake and fatty acid profile of plasma phospholipids and adipose tissue were assessed in two patient populations: 20 patients with recently diagnosed CD and 32 patients with longstanding (> 10 yr) CD clinically in remission, matched for age and gender with healthy controls. RESULTS: We observed no significant differences in quantitative or qualitative fat intake between CD patients and controls. Percentages of linoleic acid and alpha-linolenic acid in plasma phospholipids or adipose tissue were not significantly different between patients and controls. However, we observed a significantly (p < 0.05) lower percentage of the sum of the n-3 fatty acids, with significantly (p < 0.01) higher levels of clupanodonic acid (22:5n-3) and significantly (p < 0.05) lower levels of docosahexaenoic (22:6n-3) and arachidonic acid (20:4n-6). The aberrant fatty acid profile was more evident in patients with longstanding CD than in patients with recently diagnosed CD. CONCLUSION: The aberrant fatty acid profile found in these CD patients is a result of altered metabolism rather than of essential fatty acid malabsorption. The reported findings may be important in the pathophysiology of CD and hence in the choice of fatty acids to be used when therapeutic supplementation is considered in CD patients.},

   abstract = {BACKGROUND: Lactobacillus GG is a safe probiotic bacterium known to transiently colonize the human intestine. It has been found to be useful in treatment of several gastrointestinal conditions characterized by increased gut permeability. In the current study, the efficacy of Lactobacillus GG was investigated in children with Crohn's disease. METHODS: In this open-label pilot evaluation viewed as a necessary preliminary step for a possible subsequent randomized placebo-controlled trial, four children with mildly to moderately active Crohn's disease were given Lactobacillus GG (10(10) colony-forming units [CFU]) in enterocoated tablets twice a day for 6 months. Changes in intestinal permeability were measured by a double sugar permeability test. Clinical activity was determined by measuring the pediatric Crohn's disease activity index. RESULTS: There was a significant improvement in clinical activity 1 week after starting Lactobacillus GG, which was sustained throughout the study period. Median pediatric Crohn's disease activity index scores at 4 weeks were 73% lower than baseline. Intestinal permeability improved in an almost parallel fashion. CONCLUSIONS: Findings in this pilot study show that Lactobacillus GG may improve gut barrier function and clinical status in children with mildly to moderately active, stable Crohn's disease. Randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled trials are warranted for a final assessment of the efficacy of Lactobacillus GG in Crohn's disease.},

Clinical relapses as assessed by CDAI values were observed in 37.5% of patients receiving mesalamine alone and in 6.25% of patients in the group treated with mesalamine plus the probiotic agent. Our results suggest that Saccharomyces boulardii may represent a useful tool in the maintenance treatment of Crohn's disease.

Other developments of interest include more evolutionary (in contrast to revolutionary) clinical data regarding aminosalicylates, antibiotics, and steroids as inductive agents and use of immunomodulatory agents as maintenance therapies. Comparative trials continue to demonstrate that steroids, including budesonide, have a greater acute benefit than aminosalicylates, but this benefit does not translate into long-term efficacy. Azathioprine and 6-mercaptopurine are the standard maintenance therapies for steroid-dependent Crohn's disease, and long-term safety data continue to accumulate regarding these agents in adults and children. Several novel approaches have been reported in preliminary fashion that will require much more extensive clinical experience and controlled-trial evidence.},

   abstract = {The treatment of Crohn's disease depends on disease location and disease activity. It can be divided into medical and surgical treatment. While surgery is reserved for complications such as abscesses or failure of pharmacological treatment (fistulae, perianal disease, or strictures) medical treatment aims at induction and maintenance of remission. In order to achieve these goals supportive and therapeutic strategies must be used. Supportive measures include substitution of vitamins, particularly fat-soluble vitamins, and minerals in deficiencies due to resection or disease involvement of the small bowel. All patients on long-term steroids should receive calcium and vitamin D in order to prevent osteoporosis. Therapeutic options include drug treatment (corticosteroids, antibiotics, salicylates, and immunosuppressives), nutrition (parenteral or enteral), and endoscopy (dilatation of strictures). Depending on disease location different pharmacologic preparations of salicylates or corticosteroids should be used, e.g., enemas for distal colitis. The most potent drugs for long-term control are immunosuppressive agents, particularly azathioprine. It is the most widely investigated immunosuppressive agent in Crohn's disease and should be the first line treatment for patients with steroid refractory, chronic steroid dependent, fistulating, and stenosing courses. In the future, more potent drugs and better risk stratification criteria should improve the treatment of Crohn's disease.},

There has been interest in a mycobacterial involvement in Crohn's disease since its earliest description. It is not recognized that Mycobacterium avium subspecies paratuberculosis, a proven but uncommon cause of human disease, is widespread in the human food chain especially in dairy products and beef. M. paratuberculosis has been identified in tissues from a higher proportion of Crohn's disease patients than controls, suggesting that it may be one of the causes of Crohn's disease. We review the large number of antibiotic trials in Crohn's disease. Although studies have been performed with many different protocols and variations in the definition of success, preliminary reports of multiple drug therapies are encouraging. Nevertheless, large-well designed preferably placebo-controlled studies are needed before one could recommend such therapy.},

However, no method has been available to localize this type of organisms in tissue sections. We developed an in situ hybridization method for the demonstration of Mycobacterium paratuberculosis spheroplasts (cell wall deficient forms) in paraffin embedded tissue sections.M. paratuberculosis spheroplasts were prepared by treatment with glycine and lysozyme. Pieces of beef were injected with the prepared spheroplasts. The samples were fixed in buffered formalin and paraffin embedded. A M. paratuberculosis-specific probe derived from the IS900 gene was used. Specificity was controlled by using an irrelevant probe and by hybridizing sections with spheroplasts from other bacteria. Beef samples injected with M. paratuberculosis spheroplasts were the only samples that hybridized with the probe. Beef samples containing acid-fast or spheroplast forms of M. smegmatis and M. tuberculosis as well as the acid-fast forms of M. paratuberculosis did not hybridize with the probe. Unrelated bacterial controls, i.e. Helicobacter pylori and Escherichia coli were also negative in the assay. In situ hybridization with the IS900 probe provides a specific way to localize M. paratuberculosis spheroplasts in tissue sections and may be useful for studies of the connection between M. paratuberculosis and Crohn's disease and sarcoidosis. The assay may also be valuable for studies on Johne's diseased animals.},

   abstract = {M. avium subsp. paratuberculosis (M. paratuberculosis) is the causative agent of Johne's disease (JD) in ruminants leading to enormous economical losses in dairy and meat industries worldwide. During the subclinical stage of the disease, the infected animals are difficult if not impossible to detect by the available diagnostic tests including the PCR based ones. Although only considered an animal pathogen, cell wall deficient (CWD) forms of M. paratuberculosis have been isolated from patients with sarcoidosis and Crohn's disease (idiopathic diseases) in humans. Hence, the CWD form of this organism has been suspected to play a role in the pathogenesis of these diseases by persisting in the affected tissues and triggering a localized immune response and pathology. Differentiating between the CWD and acid-fast forms of this organism may lead to the determination of whether the CWD form is the pathogenic form in the subclinical cases of JD in animals and/or the etiologic agent for the above human diseases. To localize such organisms in tissue sections, CWD forms of mycobacteria were prepared in vitro and injected into beef cubes which were then formalin fixed and paraffin embedded. An in situ hybridization (ISH) technique, combined with the IS900 M. paratuberculosis-specific probe labeled with digoxigenin, was developed for the detection of nucleic acids specifically from the CWD forms but not their acid-fast forms in tissue sections. Specificity was confirmed by the negative finding with an irrelevant probe and with control tissue preparations containing CWD cells of related mycobacteria and unrelated organisms. This ISH procedure provides a way to distinguish between the acid-fast and CWD forms of M. paratuberculosis and to localize them in tissue sections. ISH may prove useful to evaluate the significance of CWD forms of M. paratuberculosis in the pathogenesis of JD, Crohn's disease and sarcoidosis.},

We examined the effect of preoperative nutritional therapy with elemental diet on the interval until and the outcome after surgical treatment in patients with Crohn's disease. METHODOLOGY: We reviewed the records for 73 patients with Crohn's disease who underwent intestinal resection in our department between January 1, 1974 and December 31, 1996. Thirty-two of them had not received elemental diet (No ED group) and 41 had received elemental diet therapy (ED group) before the first resection. RESULTS: The median interval between the onset and first resection was 19.3 months for the NoED group and 67.5 months for the ED group (P = 0.0005). All patients received ED therapy after the first resection. The incidence of second resection was significantly different between the ED and the NoED group after the first operation. (P = 0.045). CONCLUSIONS: Elemental diet therapy is effective in prolonging the interval between the onset and first resection and in reducing the incidence of second resection. The initial introduction of elemental diet therapy is useful in the management of the clinical course of Crohn's disease minimizing surgical intervention.},

   abstract = {Anecdotally, people with inflammatory bowel disease (IBD) report that some foods make them feel better and some foods make them feel worse. This paper reports about the relationship between food habits and reactions to foods in people with IBD. A database was designed to incorporate the date of data collection, the IBD disease, food habits, the quantity consumed and a response rating of the subjects' reactions to each food. For each of 122 foods, subjects were asked simultaneously about these five categories. Thirty three subjects with Crohn's disease and 27 with ulcerative colitis completed the questionnaire in two seasons. The focus of the examination was directed to the upper and lower limit of reactions to foods. Foods that affect people negatively and foods that affect people positively were identified in relation to habits of consumption. Foods that affect people negatively were among those never consumed while foods that affect people positively were among the regularly consumed foods. Findings included an increased number of foods that caused problems for people with Crohn's disease when compared with people with ulcerative colitis. Problems with chocolate, dairy products, fats and artificial sweeteners were documented in both groups of IBD. A standard food list generated without the input of individuals with a chronic illness may be inadequate to collect data about their consumption since many of the foods on the list were reportedly never consumed and there may be other foods not on the list that are consumed by this chronically ill population.},

A database was created to capture the season of data collection, the disease, the food, and the subject's reaction to each food. A 122-item food list was used. Sixty patients with IBD (n = 33 persons with Crohn's disease, n = 27 persons with ulcerative colitis) completed the questionnaire about foods and their reactions to the foods in the fall and spring representing summer and winter consumption. Foods that made the subjects feel better and worse were identified. Although the original purpose of the study was to assess people with IBD as a group, it became apparent that reactions to foods were different according to whether a subject had Crohn's disease or ulcerative colitis. Failure to distinguish between the two diseases and use only the pooled data made the data meaningless. The importance of this finding and themes related to foods that had a positive or negative effect on the subjects is discussed in this article.},

   abstract = {To assess the clinical use of the breath hydrogen test in a large community hospital using a <10 ppm cutoff, we reviewed 222 tests performed over a 5-year period to evaluate patients for disaccharidase deficiency or bacterial overgrowth of the small intestine. Of these, the vast majority (195) were for lactose malabsorption, although fructose (17), sucrose (8) and lactulose (2) were also occasionally administered. One hundred eleven tests (50 percent) were positive, with an increase of at least 10 ppm hydrogen above the fasting level and a maximum value most commonly observed (42.3 percent of the time) at 3 hours post-administration. Only 34 patients (15.3 percent) had symptoms noted during the test, as compared with 185 (83.3 percent) who had experienced persistent intestinal problems prior to the test. Recent conditions which may have caused intestinal distress, such as transient disaccharidase deficiency, infections, surgery or other disorders like Crohn's disease, ulcerative colitis or food poisoning, were recorded in only 14 cases. Patterns consistent with bacterial overgrowth of the small intestine were observed in only 3 cases. Of 111 positives, 9 cases had increases between 10 and 20 ppm hydrogen and 7 showed the increase in the 3-hour sample, possibly reflecting a delayed transit through the intestine. Final diagnoses in 6 of these where information was available were for conditions other than malabsorption. We conclude that using a rise of 10 ppm to interpret a positive test does not contribute significantly to an increased frequency of false positives, but that patients with increases between 10 and 20 ppm probably are not lactase deficient.},

Since there is considerable interest in this kind of treatment among patients with Crohn's disease, an international working group has summarized the presently available information about efficacy, side effects and possible problems of this treatment. Studies show that Remicade is effective in the treatment of active Crohn's disease, maintaining remission and fistulae. The working group does not see Infliximab as a first-line treatment for Crohn's disease. It may be used in active phase recurrent disease, chronic active disease and fistulae if standard treatment was not successful. For the surveillance special attention has to be given to the unknown malignancy rate of Infliximab. Infusion should be performed in an institution, routinely performing intravenous infusions and a two-hour surveillance of the patients should be guaranteed to recognize anaphylactic reactions or acute side effects. There is presently no information indication that the combination with immunosuppressants might increase risks or side effects of this treatment. Due to the limited information available the working group would prefer to use Remicade in studies only and recommends central collection and documentation of all data on efficacy and side effects for the next year.},

   abstract = {Because of the large liver stores (about 5 mg), low turnover rate (0.143%) and small daily requirement (3 micrograms), vitamin B12 deficiency does not occur under normal circumstances. This is not the case in individuals with chronic inflammatory or trophic changes at vitamin B12 absorption sites. Without supplementation, vitamin B12 deficiency can be expected within 5 years of gastrectomy. Characteristic features of type A gastritis are hyposecretion and mucosal atrophy in the fundus and body of the stomach, with absent intrinsic factor. In the small intestine, active and/or passive absorption is impaired by extensive ileal resection, exocrine pancreatic insufficiency and chronic inflammatory disorders such as Crohn's disease. Definitive plasma concentrations cannot be quoted for vitamin B12 deficiency. Dietary habits, subjective symptoms, hematological laboratory results, function tests and gastrointestinal endoscopic and histological findings must all be taken into account in the diagnosis. Modern diagnostic parameters, such as methylmalonic acid and homocysteine serum assays, are useful for achieving early diagnosis and hence optimal treatment. With their assured availability, parenteral vitamin B12 preparations remain the treatment of choice. Results from vitamin B12 bioavailability studies in healthy subjects suggest that > 300 micrograms probably suffices as an oral maintenance dose after parenteral loading. Further well-documented cases are needed in order to establish whether these doses are adequate in malabsorption syndromes and gastrointestinal diseases. Various case reports indicate the value of prophylactic and therapeutic oral vitamin B12 administration, especially in disorders of homocysteine metabolism, a substance postulated as a further important risk factor for atherosclerosis.},

Here we examined if mast cells contribute to the IL-5 production in human intestinal mucosa. The number of IL-5-positive lamina propria cells was substantially higher in patients with intestinal inflammatory diseases (5.3 +/- 4.6%, n = 17) compared to healthy controls (0.5 +/- 0.9%, n = 8, p < 0.01). In patients, the IL-5-positive cells were eosinophils (70 +/- 13%) and mast cells (29 +/- 14%), whereas in controls all IL-5-positive cells were eosinophils. IL-5-positive T cells were not detected, likely because they do not store IL-5. In vitro studies with isolated human intestinal mast cells and eosinophils showed that mast cells do not produce IL-5 constitutively, but release high amounts of IL-5 (315 +/- 115 pg/10(6) cells) following IgE receptor cross-linking, compared to activated eosinophils (24 +/- 5 pg/10(6) cells). Inhibitor studies suggest a regulation of IL-5 production at the transcriptional level. In conclusion our data demonstrate that activated mast cells are a potent source of IL-5 in the human intestinal mucosa.},

   abstract = {Parenteral nutrition corrects for or prevents malnutrition in patients with acute or chronic bowel disease. Whether acute (a few days to a few weeks) or chronic (a few weeks to several years), there are two pathophysiological mechanisms of bowel disease leading to malnutrition: motricity disorders and defective absorption. Total parenteral nutrition has to be prescribed in three situations: occlusive intestinal stenosis, pseudo-obstruction with complete food intolerance, clinically or endoscopically severe colitis. The indication for total parenteral nutrition to allow the intestine to "rest" is indicated in case of digestive fistulae with a high flow and for inflammatory bowel disease (Crohn's disease, irradiated bowel disease). In other cases, parenteral nutrition can be used as a complement to poorly tolerated or quantitatively insufficient oral or enteral nutrition to maintain the patient's nutritional status or correct for malnutrition. Peripheral (<3 weeks) or central (>3 weeks) parenteral nutrition, like all types of nutritional support, must be complete and conducted according to a rigorous written protocol specific for each indication, particularly acute versus chronic intestinal disease, in order to avoid iatrogenic and metabolic risks. This goal can be best achieved by developing a nutritional team within each hospital. Two other important goals are to enhance the efficacy of the nutritional support and to avoid inappropriate prescriptions, notably for parenteral administration. Such an approach allows a better risk/benefit ratio evaluated with nutritional standards. These are the prerequisites for nutritional therapy to be recognized as a major discipline in medicine.},

   abstract = {In our ongoing studies on the chemoprevention of cancer we have a particular interest in the health benefits of the Mediterranean diet, of which olive oil is a major component. Recent studies have shown that extravirgin olive oil contains an abundance of phenolic antioxidants including simple phenols (hydroxytyrosol, tyrosol), aldehydic secoiridoids, flavonoids and lignans (acetoxypinoresinol, pinoresinol). All of these phenolic substances are potent inhibitors of reactive oxygen species attack on, e.g. salicylic acid, 2-deoxyguanosine. Currently there is growing evidence that reactive oxygen species are involved in the aetiology of fat-related neoplasms such as cancer of the breast and colorectum. A plausible mechanism is a high intake of omega-6 polyunsaturated fatty acids which are especially prone to lipid peroxidation initiated and propagated by reactive oxygen species, leading to the formation (via alpha,beta-unsaturated aldehydes such as trans-4-hydroxy-2-nonenal) of highly pro-mutagenic exocyclic DNA adducts. Previous studies have shown that the colonic mucosa of cancer patients and those suffering from predisposing inflammatory conditions such as ulcerative colitis and Crohn's disease generates appreciably higher quantities of reactive oxygen species compared with normal tissue. We have extended these studies by developing accurate high performance liquid chromatography (HPLC) methods for the quantitation of reactive oxygen species generated by the faecal matrix. The data shows that the faecal matrix supports the generation of reactive oxygen species in abundance. As yet, there is a dearth of evidence linking this capacity to actual components of the diet which may influence the colorectal milieu. However, using the newly developed methodology we can demonstrate that the antioxidant phenolic compounds present in olive oil are potent inhibitors of free radical generation by the faecal matrix. This indicates that the study of the inter-relation between reactive oxygen species and dietary antioxidants is an area of great promise for elucidating mechanisms of colorectal carcinogenesis and possible future chemopreventive strategies.},

   abstract = {Human milk lipids contain preformed LCPUFA in considerable amounts, which serve as precursors for the formation of prostaglandins, prostacyclins, and other lipid mediators, as well as essential components in membrane-rich tissues (such as the brain and the retina), thus affecting functional outcomes. Besides a balanced nutrient composition and a number of conditionally essential nutrients, human milk provides different types and classes of bioactive factors, such as enzymes, hormones, and growth factors, many of which appear to have a role in supporting infantile growth and development. The bioactive agents include antimicrobial factors (e.g., secretory IgA, oligosaccharides, FA); anti-inflammatory agents; transporters (e.g., lactoferrin); and digestive enzymes (e.g., BSSL). Several nonpeptide hormones (thyroid hormones, cortisol, progesterone, pregnanediol, estrogens, and artificial contraceptive) and peptide hormones and growth factors (erythropoietin, hHG, gonadotropin-releasing hormone, epidermal growth factor insulin, insulin-like growth factor-I, nerve growth factor, transforming growth factor-alpha, gastrointestinal regulatory peptides and thyroid-parathyroid hormones) have been isolated and quantitated in human milk. Some of these components are also involved in the maturation of the gastrointestinal tract of the infant. In addition to the passive benefits provided by human milk, several data support the hypothesis that breastfeeding promotes the development of the infant's own immune system, which might confer long-term benefits for the newborn infant. The risk of IDDM, Crohn's disease, and atopic disease is lower in individuals who had been breastfed during infancy. Areas of major interest in human milk research include the study of human milk synthesis and the contributions of dietary composition and maternal metabolism to human milk composition, infantile utilization of human milk components, and the study of bioactive components, such as oligosaccharides, proteins and peptides, and lipids and their in vivo fate and biologic effects in the recipient infant.},

Biotechnology agents including a chimeric monoclonal anti-TNF antibody (infliximab), a humanized monoclonal anti-TNF antibody (CDP571), and a recombinant TNF receptor fusion protein (etanercept) have been used to inhibit TNFalpha activity. Controlled trials have demonstrated efficacy for infliximab in moderately to severely active Crohn's disease (CD) and fistulizing CD sufficient to justify recent U.S. Food and Drug Administration (FDA) approval. Additional trials have been completed in rheumatoid arthritis (RA). Similarly, preliminary controlled trials have suggested efficacy for CDP571 in active CD and RA. Larger controlled trials have demonstrated efficacy for etanercept in RA patients who have failed disease modifying antirheumatic drug (DMARD) therapy leading to FDA approval for RA. Toxicities observed with anti-TNF therapies have included formation of human antichimeric antibodies (HACA) with associated acute and delayed hypersensitivity infusion reactions, human antihuman antibodies (HAHAs), and formation of autoantibodies with rare instances of drug-induced lupus. Several cases of non-Hodgkin's lymphoma also has been described. Future studies should evaluate optimal timing and duration of anti-TNF therapy, the utility of adjuvant medical treatments during anti-TNF therapy, and evaluate long-term safety and efficacy of the various anti-TNF agents.},

   abstract = {Most conventional forms of drug therapy suppress or modify the host immunoinflammatory response and neglect the other contributor to disease pathogenesis-the environmental microflora. Probiotics are live microbial food ingredients that alter the enteric microflora and have a beneficial effect on health. The rationale for using probiotics in IBD is mainly based on evidence from human studies and experimental animal models implicating intestinal bacteria in the pathogenesis of these disorders. The relationship between bacteria and intestinal inflammation is complex and does not appear to reflect a simple cause and effect. Similarly, the field of probiotics is complex and in need of rigorous research. Until the indigenous flora are better characterized and mechanisms of probiotic action defined, the promise of probiotics in IBD is unlikely to be fulfilled. Because of strain-specific variability and clinical and therapeutic heterogeneity within Crohn's disease and ulcerative colitis, it cannot be assumed that a given probiotic is equally suitable for all individuals. Although preliminary results of probiotic therapy in animal models and humans with ulcerative colitis and pouchitis have been encouraging, their efficacy in treatment or maintenance of remission of Crohn's disease remains to be clarified. However, the circumstantial evidence for some form of biotherapeutic modification of the enteric flora in Crohn's disease seems compelling. In the future, probiotics may offer a simple adjunct to conventional therapy with the emphasis on diet shifting from one of nutritional replenishment alone to a more functional role.},

   abstract = {Human beings evolved consuming a diet that contained about equal amounts of n-3 and n-6 essential fatty acids. Over the past 100-150 y there has been an enormous increase in the consumption of n-6 fatty acids due to the increased intake of vegetable oils from corn, sunflower seeds, safflower seeds, cottonseed, and soybeans. Today, in Western diets, the ratio of n-6 to n-3 fatty acids ranges from approximately 20-30:1 instead of the traditional range of 1-2:1. Studies indicate that a high intake of n-6 fatty acids shifts the physiologic state to one that is prothrombotic and proaggregatory, characterized by increases in blood viscosity, vasospasm, and vasoconstriction and decreases in bleeding time. n-3 Fatty acids, however, have antiinflammatory, antithrombotic, antiarrhythmic, hypolipidemic, and vasodilatory properties. These beneficial effects of n-3 fatty acids have been shown in the secondary prevention of coronary heart disease, hypertension, type 2 diabetes, and, in some patients with renal disease, rheumatoid arthritis, ulcerative colitis, Crohn disease, and chronic obstructive pulmonary disease. Most of the studies were carried out with fish oils [eicosapentaenoic acid (EPA) and docosahexaenoic acid (DHA)]. However, alpha-linolenic acid, found in green leafy vegetables, flaxseed, rapeseed, and walnuts, desaturates and elongates in the human body to EPA and DHA and by itself may have beneficial effects in health and in the control of chronic diseases.},

   abstract = {BACKGROUND: Crohn's disease is a chronic inflammatory disorder of the bowel. In a preliminary study, we evaluated whether the administration of growth hormone (somatropin) as well as a high-protein diet would ameliorate the symptoms of the disease. METHODS: We randomly assigned 37 adults with moderate-to-severe active Crohn's disease to four months of self-administered injections of growth hormone (loading dose, 5 mg per day subcutaneously for one week, followed by a maintenance dose of 1.5 mg per day) or placebo. We instructed all patients to increase their protein intake to at least 2 g per kilogram of body weight per day. Patients continued to be treated by their usual physicians and to receive other medications for Crohn's disease. The primary end point was the change in scores on the Crohn's Disease Activity Index from base line to month 4. Scores can range from 0 to 600, with higher scores indicating more disease activity. RESULTS: At base line, the mean (+/-SD) score on the Crohn's Disease Activity Index was somewhat higher among the 19 patients in the growth hormone group than among the 18 patients in the placebo group (287+/-134 vs. 213+/-120, P=0.09). Three patients in the placebo group withdrew before their first follow-up visit and were not included in the data analysis. At four months, the Crohn's Disease Activity Index score had decreased by a mean of 143+/-144 points in the growth hormone group, as compared with a decrease of 19+/-63 points in the placebo group (P=0.004). Side effects in the growth hormone group included edema (in 10 patients) and headache (in 5) and usually resolved within the first month of treatment. CONCLUSIONS: Our preliminary study suggests that growth hormone may be a beneficial treatment for patients with Crohn's disease.},

The mode of transmission is unclear; however, some evidence suggests that humans may become infected via contaminated milk. Currently, it is not known whether commercial pasteurization effectively kills M. paratuberculosis in contaminated raw milk. Using a laboratory-scale pasteurizer unit designed to simulate the high-temperature, short-time method (72 degrees C, 15 sec) currently used by commercial dairies, we previously demonstrated that treatment of raw milk inoculated with 10(4) to 10(6) cfu of M. paratuberculosis/ml reduced numbers to an undetectable level. However, M. paratuberculosis is an intracellular pathogen that resides within the macrophages of the host and evades destruction. We subsequently performed further experiments examining heat treatment of milk inoculated with mammary gland macrophages containing ingested M. paratuberculosis. Heat treatment of these samples under high-temperature, short-time conditions demonstrated that the macrophage does not protect the organism because we were unable to recover any viable M. paratuberculosis from the samples. Conversely, other researchers have demonstrated that a residual population of M. paratuberculosis may survive heat treatment of milk. In addition, a recent news report stated that viable M. paratuberculosis organisms have been cultured from retail-ready milk in Ireland. A summary of past and current studies concerning this issue along with a discussion of methodologies used to recover M. paratuberculosis from experimentally inoculated milk will be presented in this paper.},

To answer questions about the effects on ONS on body weight and structure, spontaneous food intake and body function, a critical systematic review was undertaken (Stratton & Elia, 1999a). Eighty-four trials were reviewed (forty-five randomized, thirty-nine non-randomized: 2,570 patients; diagnoses including chronic obstructive pulmonary disease, Crohn's disease, cystic fibrosis, human immunodeficiency virus and acquired immune deficiency syndrome and cancer). Most studies (83 %) were conducted in patients living at home. The supplements were typically mixed macronutrients in liquid form, providing < 0.42-10.5 MJ/d for 1 week-2 years. The studies reviewed in patients with predominantly chronic conditions living in the community suggested that: (1) ONS produce demonstrable clinical (including functional) benefits, but the nature and extent of these benefits varies with the underlying chronic condition; (2) ONS increase total energy intake with > 50 % of the energy from ONS typically additional to that from habitual food intake; (3) improvements in body weight, total energy intake and body function following ONS appear to occur more frequently in individuals with a BMI < 20 kg/m2 than in those with a BMI > 20 kg/m2.},

   abstract = {OBJECTIVE: Our aim was to investigate the prevalence of antineutrophil cytoplasmic antibodies (ANCA) in Japanese patients with ulcerative colitis (UC) and Crohn's disease (CD), and the putative antigens recognized by perinuclear staining pattern ANCA (p-ANCA)-positive sera. METHODS: Sera from UC (n = 52) and CD (n = 43) patients, and from healthy controls (n = 74) were studied. The indirect immunofluorescence (IIF) method was used for the detection of ANCA and its binding pattern. p-ANCA-positive sera were studied further for putative antigens. ELISAs using lactoferrin (Lf), myeloperoxidase (MPO), and cathepsin G (Cat G) as antigens were performed. RESULTS: ANCA was positive in 40 of the 52 (76.9%) UC (p-ANCA in 33) and in 32 of the 43 (74.4%) CD (p-ANCA in 31) patients. UC and CD patients showed significantly higher titers of p-ANCA than controls; however, no significant difference was observed between UC and CD. In UC, 23, 17, and nine of the 33 patients with p-ANCA-positive sera showed reactivity with Lf, MPO, and Cat-G, respectively. In CD, 21, 20, and 11 of the 31 patients with p-ANCA-positive sera showed reactivity with Lf, MPO, and Cat-G, respectively. Fourteen of the UC and six of the CD patients showed reactivity with two different antigens, and seven of the UC and 11 of the CD patients showed reactivity with all three antigens. The presence of anti-Lf and anti-MPO antibodies was further confirmed by Western blotting. CONCLUSIONS: ANCA is useful in distinguishing patients with IBD from normal subjects but is not sufficient for the differential diagnosis of CD and UC. p-ANCA reactivity might be derived from the recognition of heterogeneous neutrophil-associated antigens.},

In the case of their woman patient the carcinoid was identified with the examination of the resected ileoascendent part of the bowel resulting of the complication of the Crohn's disease. 10 similar association is known in the literature but none of the patients had the signs of the carcinoid syndrome. Subsequent adrenerg syndrome after an alimentary hypoglycemia (increased evacuation of the cathecolamines and their metabolites in the urine), food allergy (increased IgE type antibody to milk protein) or gastroenteropancreatic (GEP) neuroendocrine tumor (based on the result of the 111In-octreoscan and the increased 5-hydroxyindolaceticaciduria) equally suspected of the symptoms (palpitation, flush) manifested after the operation. They look for the connection between the genesis of the intestinal carcinoid and the Crohn's disease with working up the bibliography. Summing up the references with a view of the latest it can be stated that the carcinoid of the appendix occurs more than orders of magnitude in the samples from inflamed surrounding than the samples from autopsy (0.24%--820/338,000 inflamed appendix and 0.03%--19/53,430 appendix from autopsy). Consequently the inflammation create favourable condition for the development of the carcinoid of the appendix.},

   abstract = {INTRODUCTION: Magnesium is an oligo-element which has an important effect on the myocardial function and peripheral vascular system. MATERIAL AND METHODS: The experiences of other authors as well as other papers have been analyzed. RESULTS: Magnesium participates in over 300 enzymatic reactions in the human organism. It may be found in drinking water and food through which it is substituted. According to WHO, there is a good correlation between Ca++/Mg++ ratio in drinking water and frequency of cardiac events. Higher Mg++ quantity reduces coronary disease. Decreased Mg++ quantity in plasma has been registered in patients with acute myocardial infarction (AMI), coronary patients and patients with heart failure. Various rhythm disturbances, particularly Torsade de points are related to hypomagnesemia. Diuretics and some cytostatics, and antibiotics decrease Mg++ in plasma, erythrocytes and muscles. Decreased Mg++ have been found in alcoholics, diabetics and Crohn disease, which are in certain cases related to existing heart rhythm disturbances. In cardiology it is proved that Mg++ are beneficial in AMI, protection during open heart surgery and treatment and prevention of heart surgery and heart rhythm disturbances. The use of Mg++ in vasospastic angina pectoris, Raynaud's disease and cardiomyopathies due to cytostatics is still in the process of investigation. It is still a matter of discussion whether Mg++ should be administered in these conditions or only when its quantities are reduced. Do Mg++ values in plasma indicate its total presence in the organism? Where should Mg++ be administered as therapy, in which doses and how rapidly? Should preventive addition of Mg++ in drinking water reduce heart disease and prolong life? There are neither many answers nor real conclusions on Mg++ significance in cardiology. However, some encouraging results about its use indicate the significance of further investigations. DISCUSSION: It has been accepted by the authors all over the world that the role of magnesium is of great importance in prevention and treatment of cardiac patients. CONCLUSION: Our first experiences are in accordance with other studies.},

   abstract = {OBJECTIVE: Enteral feeding is now an established primary therapy for active Crohn's disease. This first-double blind randomized trial was designed to compare the therapeutic efficacy of a polymeric diet (PD) with an elemental diet (ED). METHODS: Patients with active Crohn's disease (Crohn's disease activity index [CDAI] > 150, increased bowel uptake of Tc-HMPAO-labeled leukocytes, and abnormal C-reactive protein [CRP]), were randomized to receive either an ED or a PD. The two preparations were identical except for the nitrogen source, which was amino acid based in ED and intact protein in PD. Enteral feeding was considered successful if clinical remission was achieved as defined by a final CDAI of < or = 150, a reduction in the CDAI by at least 100 points from baseline level, and a normal CRP. RESULTS: Twenty-one patients were enrolled of whom 11 were randomized to PD and 10 to ED. The two groups were comparable at entry. Clinical remission was obtained in eight (80%) patients receiving ED and six (55%) patients receiving PD, p = 0.1. The treatment failed in three and two patients in the PD and ED groups, respectively. Another two patients were intolerant to the feed (PD). Reduction in the CDAI after treatment with ED (359 +/- 67 to 112 +/- 19) was similar to that seen with PD (303 +/- 27 to 97 +/- 11). Similar changes in the CRP were also observed (16 +/- 5 to 4 +/- 1.6) and (62 +/- 20 to 9 +/- 6), respectively. Overall, enteral feeding was successful in 14 patients (63%). CONCLUSIONS: Enteral nutrition is effective in treatment of active Crohn's disease. Differences in nitrogen sources of enteral feeds are not relevant to their therapeutic efficacy, as polymeric and elemental diets are equally effective.},

   abstract = {BACKGROUND: Enteral feeding with either elemental or polymeric diets is an established primary therapy for active Crohn's disease. However, the role of supplementing normal food with elemental diet in the long-term management of Crohn's disease has hitherto not been explored. PATIENTS AND METHODS: A series of 39 consecutive patients with Crohn's disease in clinical remission were studied. Of these, 21 patients (Group 1) received oral nutritional supplementation, taken in addition to their normal diet. Their outcome (relapse rate, Crohn's disease activity index, inflammatory markers) was compared with that of 18 patients (Group 2), who were maintained on a normal unrestricted diet over an observation period of 12 months. RESULTS: A total of 17 patients (81%) tolerated the nutritional supplementation. On an intention-to-treat basis, 10 patients (48%) remained in remission for 12 months, compared to 4/18 (22%) patients in Group 2, p<0.0003. Their Crohn's disease activity index and CRP remained stable while their weight and body mass index improved during the period of nutrition therapy Seven patients in Group 1 and 14 in Group 2 relapsed at a mean of 7.4+/-0.9 and 6.2+/-0.4 months, respectively. The response to nutrition supplement was independent of age, sex, disease duration or location. Four patients (19%) were intolerant to enteral feeding. CONCLUSIONS: Nutritional supplementation is safe, well tolerated and effective in the long-term management of patients with quiescent Crohn's disease.},

   abstract = {We present a 28-year-old women with a 3 yr history of duodenal ulcers. Following four treatment attempts to eradicate helicobacter pylori she was admitted because of gastric outlet obstruction and a weight loss of 20 kg within the last two years. Endoscopy and x-ray showed a circular inflammatory stenosis of the proximal duodenum extending over 8 cm. Additionally, chest x-ray showed a circumscript infiltrate in the third segment of the right lung. Mycobacterial infection could be excluded. Ileocolonoscopy and small intestinal follow-through beyond the duodenum were unremarkable, and Zollinger-Ellison-syndrome was ruled out. Bronchopulmonary histology showed intramucosal epithelioid-cell granulomas and bronchiolitis obliterans. Because the patient did not improve under conservative therapy a Billroth-II-resection was carried out. Histologically the resected specimen showed Crohn-like lesions. Postoperatively, severe peripheral arthritis was treated by steroids over 6 weeks. At follow-up the patient regained 20 kg and was free of symptoms without any medication. The pulmonary infiltrate had subsided almost completely. In summary, this extremely rare coincidence of isolated stenosing duodenal Crohn's disease and pulmonary involvement was successfully treated by Billroth-II-resection. This course of disease is compatible with the hypothesis that Crohn's disease may be maintained by antigens derived from ingested food.},
