   abstract = {The Food and Drug Administration (FDA or we) is issuing a final rule to define the term "gluten-free'' for voluntary use in the labeling of foods. The final rule defines the term "gluten-free'' to mean that the food bearing the claim does not contain an ingredient that is a gluten-containing grain (e.g., spelt wheat); an ingredient that is derived from a gluten-containing grain and that has not been processed to remove gluten (e.g., wheat flour); or an ingredient that is derived from a gluten-containing grain and that has been processed to remove gluten (e.g., wheat starch), if the use of that ingredient results in the presence of 20 parts per million (ppm) or more gluten in the food (i.e., 20 milligrams (mg) or more gluten per kilogram (kg) of food); or inherently does not contain gluten; and that any unavoidable presence of gluten in the food is below 20 ppm gluten (i.e., below 20 mg gluten per kg of food). A food that bears the claim "no gluten,'' "free of gluten,'' or "without gluten'' in its labeling and fails to meet the requirements for a "gluten-free'' claim will be deemed to be misbranded. In addition, a food whose labeling includes the term "wheat'' in the ingredient list or in a separate "Contains wheat'' statement as required by a section of the Federal Food, Drug, and Cosmetic Act (the FD&C Act) and also bears the claim "gluten-free'' will be deemed to be misbranded unless its labeling also bears additional language clarifying that the wheat has been processed to allow the food to meet FDA requirements for a "gluten-free'' claim. Establishing a definition of the term "gluten-free'' and uniform conditions for its use in food labeling will help ensure that individuals with celiac disease are not misled and are provided with truthful and accurate information with respect to foods so labeled. We are issuing the final rule under the Food Allergen Labeling and Consumer Protection Act of 2004 (FALCPA).},

   abstract = {In celiac disease, enhanced permeability to gliadin peptides can result from their apico-basal transport by secretory immunoglobulin A1 (SIgA1) binding to the CD71 receptor ectopically expressed at the gut epithelial surface. Herein, we have established a mouse model in which there is apico-basal transport of the model antigen ovalbumin (OVA) by specific SIgA1 and have analyzed local T-cell activation. Transgenic DO11.10 mice were grafted with a hybridoma-secreting OVA-specific humanized IgA1, which could bind mouse CD71 and which were released in the intestinal lumen as SIgA. CD71 expression was induced at the gut apical surface by treating the mice with tyrphostin A8. Following gavage of the mice with OVA, OVA-specific CD4(+) T cells isolated from the mesenteric lymph nodes displayed higher expression of the activation marker CD69 and produced more interferon gamma in mice bearing the hybridoma-secreting OVA-specific IgA1, than in ungrafted mice or in mice grafted with an irrelevant hybridoma. These results indicate that the protective role of SIgA1 might be jeopardized in human pathological conditions associated with ectopic expression of CD71 at the gut surface.},

   abstract = {Non-alcoholic fatty liver disease (NAFLD) is a common disease of unknown origin characterized by histological features similar to alcoholic-like liver injury but in the absence of significant alcohol intake. Non-alcoholic fatty liver disease refers to a spectrum of diseases of the liver ranging from simple steatosis (i.e., fatty infiltration of the liver) to nonalcoholic steatohepatitis (i.e., steatosis with inflammation and hepatocyte necrosis) to cirrhosis. Non-alcoholic fatty liver disease is frequently associated with disorders such as insulin resistance, obesity, type 2 diabetes mellitus, hyperlipidemia and protein-calorie malnutrition. However, in a subgroup of NAFLD patients, the true relevant cause remains undetermined. Celiac disease (CD) is a common immune-mediated disorder and develops in genetically susceptible subjects after the ingestion of gluten proteins. Celiac disease has been found in about 10% of patients with unexplained abnormal liver tests, and in about 3.5% of patients with NAFLD as the only manifestation of the disease. The frequency of subclinical or silent presentations in older children and adults highlights the importance of CD screening in patients with unexplained chronic abnormal liver function tests and NAFLD without any specific etiology. The pathogenesis of liver steatosis in CD is uncertain. The aims of this review are to describe the possible mechanisms involved in the occurrence and progression of liver steatosis in CD patients.},

Celiac disease (CD) is a permanent immunological intolerance to gluten proteins in genetically predisposed individuals. CD has been reported in 4-13 % of the cases with steatohepatitis, although the pathogenesis of the liver steatosis in CD patients is unclear. Based on the literature data, it can be concluded that the inclusion of serological markers of CD should be a part of the general workup in the patients with steatosis when other causes of the liver disease are excluded and in the patients with NAFLD when metabolic risk factors are not evident.},

   abstract = {The interplay between diet and immune parameters which could affect type 1 diabetes (T1D) pathogenesis is not sufficiently clarified. Intestinal up-regulation of the activating receptor natural killer group 2D (NKG2D) (CD314) and its ligands is a hallmark of coeliac disease. However, the direct effect of gluten on NKG2D expression is not known. We studied, by fluorescence activated cell sorter (lymphoid tissues) and reverse transcription-quantitative polymerase chain reaction (intestine and pancreatic islets), if a gluten-free diet (GF diet) from 4 weeks of age or a gluten-free diet introduced in breeding pairs (SGF diet), induced changes in NKG2D expression on DX5(+) (CD49b) natural killer (NK) cells, CD8(+) T cells and in intestinal and islet levels of NKG2D and ligands in BALB/c and non-obese diabetic (NOD) mice. Gluten-free NOD mice had lower insulitis (P < 0.0001); reduced expression of NKG2D on DX5(+) NK cells in spleen and auricular lymph nodes (P < 0.05); and on CD8(+) T cells in pancreas-associated lymph nodes (P = 0.04). Moreover, the level of CD71 on DX5(+) NK cells and CD8(+) T cells (P < 0.005) was markedly reduced. GF and SGF mice had reduced expression of NKG2D and DX5 mRNA in intestine (P < 0.05). Differences in intestinal mRNA expression were found in mice at 8, 13 and 20 weeks. Intestinal expression of NKG2D ligands was reduced in SGF mice with lower expression of all ligands. In isolated islets, a SGF diet induced a higher expression of specific NKG2D ligands. Our data show that a gluten-free diet reduces the level of NKG2D and the expression of NKG2D ligands. These immunological changes may contribute to the lower T1D incidence associated with a gluten-free diet.},

   abstract = {BACKGROUND: Enterocyte damage is the hallmark of coeliac disease (CD) resulting in malabsorption. Little is known about the recovery of enterocyte damage and its clinical consequences. Serum intestinal fatty acid binding protein (I-FABP) is a sensitive marker to study enterocyte damage. AIMS: To evaluate the severity of enterocyte damage in adult-onset CD and its course upon a gluten-free diet (GFD). Furthermore, the correlation among enterocyte damage, CD autoantibodies and histological abnormalities during the course of disease is studied. METHODS: Serum I-FABP levels were determined in 96 biopsy-proven adult CD patients and in 69 patients repeatedly upon a GFD. A total of 141 individuals with normal antitissue transglutaminase antibody (IgA-tTG) levels served as controls. I-FABP levels were related to the degree of villous atrophy (Marsh grade) and IgA-tTG. RESULTS: I-FABP levels were elevated in untreated CD (median 691 pg/mL) compared with controls (median 178 pg/mL, P < 0.001) and correlated with Marsh grade (r = 0.265, P < 0.05) and IgA-tTG (r = 0.403, P < 0.01). Upon a GFD serum levels decreased significantly, however, not within the range observed in controls, despite the common observed normalisation of IgA-tTG levels and Marsh grade. CD patients with elevated I-FABP levels nonresponding to GFD showed persistent histological abnormalities. CONCLUSIONS: Enterocyte damage assessed by serum I-FABP correlates with the severity of villous atrophy in coeliac disease at the time of diagnosis. Although enterocyte damage improves upon treatment, substantial enterocyte damage persists despite absence of villous atrophy and low IgA-tTG levels in the majority of cases. Elevated I-FABP levels nonresponding to gluten-free diet are indicative of histological abnormalities and warrant further evaluation.},

   abstract = {Complementary food is needed when human milk (or infant formula) alone is no longer sufficient for nutritional reasons. The timing of introduction needs to be determined on an individual basis although 6 months of exclusive breastfeeding can be recommended for most healthy term infants. Solid foods are intended to 'complement' ongoing breastfeeding with those dietary items whose intake has become marginal or insufficient. Both breastfeeding and complementary feeding can have direct or later consequences on health. Possible short-term health effects concern growth velocity and infections while possible long-term effects may relate to obesity, cardiovascular disease, autoimmunity (celiac disease and type 1 diabetes) and atopic disorders. For most of these it is impossible on the basis of the available evidence to conclude on the age when risks related to the start of complementary feeding are lowest or highest, with the possible exception of infections and early growth velocity. For undesirable health consequences, whilst potential mechanisms are recognized, the evidence from mostly observational studies is insufficient and requires more and prospective research. While the 6-month goal is desirable, introduction of suitable complementary food after 4 completed months with ongoing breastfeeding can be considered without adverse health consequences for infants living in affluent countries. Even less evidence on the consequences of the timing of complementary food introduction is available for formula-fed infants.},

The objective of this paper was to evaluate the quality of gluten-free bread formulated with different tiger nut-derived products in order to substitute soya flour (which is an allergen ingredient) and, at the same time, increase the use of tiger nut-derived products. Four gluten-free formulations based on corn starch and containing tiger nut milk, tiger nut milk by-product, tiger nut flour, or soya flour (as reference formulation) were studied. Tiger nut milk increased G' of gluten-free batter and rendered breads with the softest crumb (502.46 g +/- 102.05), the highest loaf-specific volume (3.35 cm(3)/g +/- 0.25), and it was mostly preferred by consumers (61.02%). Breads elaborated with tiger nut flour had similar characteristics than soya flour breads (except in color and crumb structure). The addition of tiger nut milk by-product resulted in a hard (1047.64 g +/- 145.74) and dark (L(*) = 70.02 +/- 3.38) crumb bread, which was the least preferred by consumers. Results showed that tiger nut is a promising ingredient to formulate gluten-free baked products.},

   abstract = {BACKGROUND: Anti-transglutaminase (tTG) or anti-deamidated gliadin peptides (DGP) serum determination is the first step in diagnosing celiac disease (CD). Our aims were to: compare the performance of novel chemiluminescent tool in the detection of tTG and DGP (Q-Flash(R), Inova) with that of the established ELISA (Q-Lite(R), Inova) methods; identify the more reliable index for making a sound diagnosis and monitoring therapy. METHODS: Using Q-Flash(R) and Q-Lite(R), IgA and IgG class tTG and DGP were measured in the sera of 155 CD pediatric patients and 166 healthy age-matched controls. Forty-two of the patients had a follow-up one year after starting gluten free diet (GFD). RESULTS: Q-Flash(R) IgA tTG, the more accurate (intra-assay CV for low, intermediate and high values: 2.2%, 1.6%, and 1.1%; inter-assay CV: 2.8%, 4%, and 3%), sensitive (96.1%) and specific (97%) test for diagnosing CD, was the only variable to be significantly correlated with CD at binary logistic regression analysis (r=0.263, p<0.0001, Exp(B)=1.0506, 95% CI=1.0286-1.0731). Q-Flash(R) IgA tTG or DGP screen were more accurate than Q-Lite(R) IgA tTG in monitoring CD patients on GFD (p=0.003). CONCLUSION: Q- Flash(R) IgA tTG measurement is an extremely precise, sensitive and specific index for not only diagnosing CD, but also monitoring therapy.},

   abstract = {BACKGROUND: Celiac disease (CD) is an immune mediated condition that leads to small bowel atrophy and improve with a gluten free diet (GFD). Extra-intestinal manifestations of CD include hypertransaminasemia. In this study, the effects of a GFD on hypertransaminasemia in patients with newly diagnosed CD were studied. METHODS: Ninety eight new diagnosed consecutive patients with CD 40 males and 58 females) with mean age of 32 +/- 17.1 were studied. All patients with CD were treated with a GFD. Patients with hypertransaminasemia, at diagnosis, had a cirrhosis screen performed. Patients with a negative cirrhosis screen were reviewed, 6 months after the introduction of a GFD, and serum levels of liver transaminases were measured again. RESULTS: Nine patients had hypertransaminasemia. One patient was Hepatitis B surface antigen positive and was excluded from this study. The 8 remaining patients had no obvious cause for the hypertransaminasemia. Mean (+/- SD) of baseline aspartate aminotransferase (AST) and alanine aminotransferase (ALT) levels were 42.6 +/- 16.5 IU/L (range: 16-66 IU/L) and 69.3 +/- 9.3 IU/L (range: 52-81 IU/L). Six months after treatment with a GFD, mean AST and ALT levels decreased to 24.5 +/- 5.1 IU/L (range: 18-31 IU/L) (P: 0.04) and 24.6 +/- 6 IU/L (range: 17-32 IU/L) (P: 0.01), respectively. In 7 patients the hypertransaminasemia, at diagnosis had resolved. CONCLUSIONS: This study provides further evidence that some patients with CD have a reversible hypertransaminasemia that resolves with a GFD.},

   abstract = {BACKGROUND: Liver involvement in celiac disease (CD) varies from asymptomatic mild non-specific hepatitis to liver failure. Here we report the first child with liver failure due to a sclerosing cholangitis associated with CD. CASE REPORT: An 11 year old girl presented with fatigability for 1 year and jaundice and abdominal distension for 3 weeks. On examination, the growth parameters were below 3rd percentile; she had splenomegaly and severe ascites. Liver function tests revealed elevated liver enzymes (ALT 84 U/L, total bilirubin 98.7 mumol/L, and direct 58.3 mumol/L, gamma-glutamyltransferase 111 U/L, INR 2.7, and albumin 16 g/L). Extensive investigations excluded infectious, metabolic, structural, and endocrine causes of chronic liver disease. Because of the short stature and anemia, CD was suspected, and serological evaluation revealed increased IgA antibodies to tissue transglutaminase (385 units; normal, 0-20 units). Histopathological examination of small intestinal biopsies showed total villous atrophy consistent with celiac disease. Liver biopsy showed bridging fibrosis, portal tract expansion by lymphocytes, plasma cells, and neutrophils, bile ductular proliferation, and periductular fibrosis. Magnetic resonance cholangiography revealed beading and narrowing appearance of intra- and extrahepatic bile ducts. The histopathological and imaging findings are diagnostic of sclerosing cholangitis. The child was initiated on ursodeoxycholic acid, gluten free diet for life, and steroid that was tapered over 3 months. At 3 month follow up, liver function tests completely normalized. CONCLUSION: CD is a potentially treatable cause of liver failure. All patients with severe unexplained liver disease should undergo serological screening for CD.},

   abstract = {BACKGROUND: Celiac disease (CD) is a chronic inflammatory disease of the small intestine triggered by gluten ingestion. The objective of this study is to describe our experience with CD children in Kuwait. METHODS: The records of children with CD seen in the pediatric gastroenterology unit between February 1998 and December 2010 were retrospectively reviewed. Patients were referred because of symptoms or positive CD antibody screening of a high-risk group (type 1 diabetes and Down syndrome). RESULTS: Forty-seven patients were diagnosed: 53% were symptomatic and 47% were identified by screening. The median age at diagnosis was 66 (range 7-189) months. All cases were biopsy-proven except one. The symptomatic patients were significantly younger than those identified following screening (P<0.004). In the whole group, 66% were females and 77% were Kuwaitis; 9% had a positive family history of CD. The estimated cumulative incidence was 6.9/10(5). The median duration of symptoms before diagnosis was 8.5 (range 2-54) months. Failure to thrive was the most common presenting complaint (72%) followed by diarrhea (64%) and abdominal distension (56%). Atypical manifestations were seen in 60% of patients. Underweight and short stature were confirmed in 19% and 17% of patients, respectively. Overweight and obesity were detected in 14% and 6%, respectively. CD serology was based on a combination of antiendomysial and antigliadin antibodies. The median follow up was 24 (range 12-144) months. All patients were commenced on a gluten free diet, but good compliance was only achieved in 78%. CONCLUSION: The low frequency of childhood CD in Kuwait could probably be attributed to either an underestimation of the atypical presentations or failure of proper screening. Also, adherence to a gluten free diet is a major problem in our population.},

However, gluten is the main structure-forming protein responsible for the development of structure in baked products. Therefore, it is a challenge to produce high-quality gluten-free products. Transglutaminase addition is a relatively common application used in the production of gluten-free baked goods. The objective of this study was to investigate the combination of buckwheat flour with rice and corn flour at different levels in gluten-free cookie formulations and the impact of transglutaminase on the quality of cookies. Quality parameters evaluated were proximal chemical composition, spread ratio, color, and textural parameters (hardness and fracturability). Spread ratio, protein, crude fiber, ash content, and also b* and hardness values were significantly (p < 0.05) affected by flour combinations. Further, addition of transglutaminase resulted in increased moisture content, spread ratio, and fracturability but decreased hardness values.},

   abstract = {BACKGROUND: Celiac Disease (CD) is an increasingly common autoimmune disorder. It requires a strict lifelong adherence to a gluten-free diet (GFD) which can influence health-related quality of life (HRQOL). This study assesses HRQOL in children and adolescents with CD and explores how several demographic and clinical characteristics and GFD adherence affect their perceived health status. METHODS: We recruited 140 consecutive children and adolescents with CD confirmed by small bowel biopsy. HRQOL was assessed using the SF-12 questionnaire plus some CD-specific questions exploring wellbeing and lifestyle. Patients, aged 10 to 18 years, were identified by pediatric gastroenterologists and guided in filling out the questionnaire by trained psychologists. Parametric or non-parametric tests were applied to analyze continuous variables and frequencies as appropriate. RESULTS: The SF-12 mean mental component summary score (MCS12) was lower than in the general Italian population (p < 0.001), whereas differences in terms of physical health were not significant (p = 0.220). More than one third of those interviewed reported feeling angry "always" or "most of the time" about having to follow the GFD, and nearly 20% reported feeling different from others and misunderstood because of CD "always" or "most of the time". CONCLUSIONS: Our findings highlight the need for health professionals to identify adolescents with major disease-related problems. The food industry should improve its range of gluten-free food products and public bodies and institutions should promote informative campaigns and help promote the overall quality of life of children and adolescents with CD.},

A culture medium, in which gliadins were the sole source of nitrogen, was developed for screening for microorganisms with gliadinase activity. The problem of gliadin insolubility was solved by mild acid treatment, which renders an acid-hydrolysed gliadin/peptide mixture (AHG). This medium provided a sensitive and reliable means of detecting proteases, compared to the classical spectrophotometric method involving azocasein. When a sample of fermented wheat (a source of bacteria) was plated on an AHG-based culture medium, strains with gliadinase activity were isolated. These strains' gliadinase profiles were determined using an AHG-based substrate in zymographic analyses.},

CLINICAL FEATURES: A 28-year-old man had muscle fasciculations of 2 years. The fasciculations began in his eye and progressed to the lips and lower extremities. In addition, he had gastrointestinal distress and fatigue. The patient was previously diagnosed as having wheat allergy at the age of 24 but was not compliant with a gluten-free diet at that time. Food sensitivity testing revealed immunoglobulin G-based sensitivity to multiple foods, including many different grains and dairy products. The working diagnosis was gluten neuropathy. INTERVENTION AND OUTCOME: Within 6 months of complying with dietary restrictions based on the sensitivity testing, the patient's muscle fasciculations completely resolved. The other complaints of brain fog, fatigue, and gastrointestinal distress also improved. CONCLUSIONS: This report describes improvement in chronic, widespread muscle fasciculations and various other systemic symptoms with dietary changes. There is strong suspicion that this case represents one of gluten neuropathy, although testing for celiac disease specifically was not performed.},

   abstract = {AIM: The aim of this paper to report the main clinical and immunopathological findings of our case series of 159 patients with dermatitis herpetiformis (DH). METHODS: All DH patients that were diagnosed from 1995 to 2012 at the Section of Dermatology of the University of Florence were included in the study. Clinical data were collected for each patient. Moreover, histopathological examination on both the skin and the small bowel, direct immunofluorescence on perilesional skin as well as the search for anti-endomysium and anti-tissue transglutaminsase antibodies (tTG) were performed. RESULTS: A total of 159 patients with a male predominance were enrolled. About 36% of the patients were below the age of 20. The most frequent clinical features seen in our DH patients were represented by figurate erythema, wheals, papules and scratching lesions, while the knees, elbows and buttocks were the most commonly involved sites. All the 22 patients that underwent a bowel biopsy showed the typical alterations found in celiac disease. Moreover, 100% of the patients showed granular IgA deposits at the papillary tips. Finally, anti-endomysium and anti-tTG antibodies were present in 90% and 96% of the patients, respectively. CONCLUSION: We reported one of the largest case series of patients with DH from a single center. Our study confirmed most of the data from the Literature, and in particular the association of DH to histologically proven CD in all the biopsied cases. Another interesting finding of our study is the high prevalence of DH within pediatric patients, that is usually underreported.},

   abstract = {Gluten proteins differ from other cereal proteins as they are partly resistant to enzymatic processing in the intestine, resulting in a continuous exposure of the proteins to the intestinal immune system. In addition to being a disease-initiating factor in coeliac disease (CD), gluten intake might affect type 1 diabetes development. Studies in animal models of type 1 diabetes have documented that the pathogenesis is influenced by diet. Thus, a gluten-free diet largely prevents diabetes in NOD mice while a cereal-based diet promotes diabetes development. In infants, amount, timing and mode of introduction have been shown to affect the diabetogenic potential of gluten, and some studies now suggest that a gluten-free diet may preserve beta cell function. Other studies have not found this effect. There is evidence that the intestinal immune system plays a primary role in the pathogenesis of type 1 diabetes, as diabetogenic T cells are initially primed in the gut, islet-infiltrating T cells express gut-associated homing receptors, and mesenteric lymphocytes transfer diabetes from NOD mice to NOD/severe combined immunodeficiency (SCID) mice. Thus, gluten may affect diabetes development by influencing proportional changes in immune cell populations or by modifying the cytokine/chemokine pattern towards an inflammatory profile. This supports an important role for gluten intake in the pathogenesis of type 1 diabetes and further studies should be initiated to clarify whether a gluten-free diet could prevent disease in susceptible individuals or be used with newly diagnosed patients to stop disease progression.},

   abstract = {Coeliac disease (CD) is a common chronic inflammatory disorder of the small bowel induced in genetically susceptible people by the exposure to gliadin gluten. Even though several tests are available to assist the diagnosis, CD remains a biopsy-defined disorder, thus any non-invasive or less invasive diagnostic tool may be beneficial. The analysis of volatile metabolites in exhaled breath, given its non-invasive nature, is particularly promising as a screening tool of disease in symptomatic or non-symptomatic patients. In this preliminary study the proton transfer reaction time of flight mass spectrometry coupled to a buffered end-tidal on-line sampler to investigate metabolites in the exhaled breath of patients affected by coeliac disease under a gluten free diet was applied. Both H3O(+) or NO(+) were used as precursor ions. In our investigation no differences were found in the exhaled breath of CD patients compared to healthy controls. In this study, 33 subjects were enrolled: 16 patients with CD, all adhering a gluten free diet, and 17 healthy controls. CD patients did not show any symptom of the disease at the time of breath analysis; thus the absence of discrimination from healthy controls was not surprising.},

   abstract = {Coeliac disease (CD), a T-cell-mediated gluten sensitive enteropathy, affects approximately 1% of the UK population and can present with wide ranging clinical features, often being mistaken for Irritable Bowel Syndrome (IBS). Heightened clinical awareness and serological screening identifies those with potential coeliac disease; the diagnosis is confirmed with duodenal biopsies, and symptom improvement with a gluten-free diet. Limitations to diagnosis are false negative serology and reluctance to undergo biopsy. The gut microbiome is altered in several gastrointestinal disorders, causing altered gut fermentation patterns recognisable by volatile organic compounds (VOC) analysis in urine, breath and faeces. We aimed to determine if CD alters the urinary VOC pattern, distinguishing it from IBS. 47 patients were recruited, 27 with established CD, on gluten free diets, and 20 with diarrhoea-predominant IBS (D-IBS). Collected urine was stored frozen in 10 ml aliquots. For assay, the specimens were heated to 40 +/- 0.1 degrees C and the headspace analysed by Field Asymmetric Ion Mobility Spectrometry (FAIMS). Machine learning algorithms were used for statistical evaluation. Samples were also analysed using Gas chromatography and mass spectroscopy (GC-MS). Sparse logistic regression showed that FAIMS distinguishes VOCs in CD vs D-IBS with ROC curve AUC of 0.91 (0.83-0.99), sensitivity and specificity of 85% respectively. GCMS showed a unique peak at 4'67 found only in CD, not D-IBS, which correlated with the compound 1,3,5,7 cyclooctatetraene. This study suggests that FAIMS offers a novel, non-invasive approach to identify those with possible CD, and distinguishes from D-IBS. It offers the potential for monitoring compliance with a gluten-free diet at home. The presence of cyclooctatetraene in CD specimens will need further validation.},

   abstract = {Knowledge about celiac disease continues to grow and amaze those who investigate, seek and treat this condition. Gone are the days when it was considered just a rare child's digestive disease. It is now recognized as a highly prevalent autoimmune condition that affects children and adults with digestive and extra-digestive symptoms of diverse intensity, disorder that may be either mono, oligo or asymptomatic from a digestive point of view. Today, it is an underdiagnosed condition, not actively considered, and often mistakes are made regarding its diagnosis, treatment and gluten-free diet monitoring. This article reviews the current definition of the disease, clinical presentations, potential patients, how to search for the disease, how the diagnosis is made and characteristics of the treatment and monitoring of celiac patients, all based on internationally agreed standards, and emphasizing those aspects that have proven to be useful in other countries regarding the management of the disease.},

The condition is characterized by both gastrointestinal and extra-intestinal symptoms that respond to gluten withdrawal. Most of the symptoms are subjective and for many years such patients remain in a diagnostic dilemma. Although symptomalogy is similar to irritable bowel syndrome (IBS), NCGS is now regarded as a distinct clinical entity. However, the disease pathology is not well elucidated and our knowledge of NCGS is still very rudimentary. This review highlights the importance of this new clinical entity, outlines its pathological mechanisms and suggests a diagnostic algorithm for its management.},

The major environmental factor associated with the risk of developing celiac-related complications is persistent exposure to dietary gluten. The aim of this study was to determine the prevalence of lower limb enthesopathy in CD patients at first diagnosis compared with CD patients on a gluten-free diet (GFD). Fifty-five untreated CD patients (group A) and 55 CD patients on a GFD from at least 1 year (group B), matched for age and sex, attending gastroenterology outpatient clinic of the University Federico II of Naples, were enrolled in this study. All patients underwent clinical and ultrasonography examination. Among group A, 27 (49.8 %) patients presented at least one entheseal alteration as compared with 15 patients (27.2 %) of group B (prevalence rate ratio 1.83, I.C. 95 % = 0.48-7.01; p < 0.001). The Glasgow ultrasound enthesitis scoring system (GUESS) was significantly higher in patients of group A than in patients of group B. In conclusion, our study shows that enthesopathy is more frequent in untreated CD subjects with positive anti-tissue transglutaminase antibodies title, as compared to those on GFD and absence of serum anti-tissue transglutaminase antibodies title.},

   abstract = {OBJECTIVES: Potential celiac disease (CD) is defined by the presence of serum anti-tissue-transglutaminase (anti-TG2) antibodies and normal duodenal mucosa. The major clinical problem is the management of asymptomatic patients and how to predict the development of villous atrophy. This prospective longitudinal cohort study describes the natural history of potential CD up to 9 years and explores risk factors associated with the development of mucosal damage. METHODS: Two hundred and ten potential CD children were eligible for the study; 175/210 asymptomatic children were left on a gluten-containing diet. Antibodies and clinical symptoms were checked every 6 months, and a small bowel biopsy was taken every 2 years to evaluate histological, immunohistochemical, and anti-TG2 deposits. Patients were genotyped for HLA and a set of non-HLA CD-associated genes. RESULTS: Forty-three percent of patients showed persistently elevated anti-TG2 level, 20% became negative during follow-up, and 37% showed a fluctuant anti-TG2 course with transiently negative values. At 3 years of follow-up, 86% of cases remained potential; 73 and 67% still had normal duodenal architecture at 6 and 9 years, respectively. Male sex, slight mucosal inflammation at time 0, and a peculiar genetic profile delineate a cohort of individuals who were prone to develop mucosal damage during time. CONCLUSIONS: A sizeable proportion of asymptomatic potential celiac patients showed fluctuation or negativization of antibody production, and many of these, with persistently positive anti-TG2, did not develop mucosal damage after 9 years of follow-up. Celiac population is a multivariate aggregate of individuals with different genetic and phenotypic profiles. Caution is required before prescribing a gluten-free diet for life to asymptomatic individuals with potential CD.},

   abstract = {BACKGROUND: Thoracic endovascular aortic repair (TEVAR) has emerged as a safe and effective alternative to open surgery for treatment of thoracic aortic aneurysms. It has recently been reported that stent-graft coverage of the celiac artery (CA) during TEVAR is associated with a low risk of acute mesenteric ischemia. However, the long-term effect of CA coverage on foregut perfusion is unknown. Here, we report the case of a patient who underwent TEVAR with partial coverage of the CA and subsequently developed symptoms of chronic mesenteric ischemia (CMI). She was successfully treated with CA stent placement. METHODS: Preoperative imaging included computed tomography (CT) angiography of the abdomen and conventional aortogram of a redo-TEVAR, revealing near complete coverage of the CA orifice. Endovascular repair was done using a 7 mm x 20 mm biliary balloon-expandable stent (Cook Medical Inc, Bloomington, IN). A review of the current literature for this rare problem was performed. RESULTS: Completion arteriography demonstrated successful revascularization of the CA without evidence of endoleak. Postoperatively, the abdominal pain was alleviated with early improved diet tolerance and weight gain. Follow-up CT at 6 month demonstrated widely patent CA. A PubMed review showed no reported cases of CMI secondary to CA coverage during TEVAR in the literature. CONCLUSIONS: CMI may develop with coverage of the CA during TEVAR. When other causes of abdominal pain and weight loss have been ruled out, revascularization of the CA can help alleviate the symptoms.},

   abstract = {BACKGROUND AND OBJECTIVES: In view of the increasing popularity of a gluten-free diet, we sought to determine whether there has been a change in awareness of gluten-related disorders (GRD) among the general public and chefs. MATERIALS AND METHODS: A face-to-face questionnaire on coeliac disease (CD) and gluten sensitivity (GS) was performed on the general public and chefs based in Sheffield, UK. The assessment was first carried out in 2003 and repeated in 2013. RESULTS: In total, 513 public members in 2003 (mean age 49.2 years, 62% women) were compared with 575 public members in 2013 (mean age 37.8 years, 57% women). There was a significant increase in the public's awareness of GRD from the years 2003 to 2013, CD [44.2% to 74.4%, adjusted odds ratio (AOR) 3.9; 95% confidence interval (CI) 3.0-5.19] and GS (58.3% to 89%, AOR 7.1; 95% CI 5.0-9.98; P<0.001). Also, 322 chefs in 2003 (mean age 37.6 years, 15% women) were compared with 265 chefs in 2013 (mean age 27.1 years, 38% women). There was a significant increase in chefs' awareness of GRD from the years 2003 to 2013, CD (17.1% to 78.1%, AOR 12.5; 95% CI 7.9-19.6) and GS (9.3% to 87.5%, AOR 65.7; 95% CI 35.4-122; P<0.001). Whereas in 2003 the public were significantly more aware of GRD than chefs, by 2013, this had reached a similar prevalence in both groups. In addition, the correct recognition of the gluten-free symbol was 44% for the public and 40% for chefs (P=0.28). Gluten-free products were sold by 41% of restaurants and 27% of takeaways (P=0.07). CONCLUSION: There has been a marked increase in both the public's and chefs' awareness of GRD. Such findings may ease the social phobia that individuals with GRD have traditionally been accustomed to.},

   abstract = {BACKGROUND: Reports suggest that gluten sensitivity (GS) exists in the absence of coeliac disease (CD). This clinical entity has been termed noncoeliac gluten sensitivity (NCGS). OBJECTIVES: To determine the population prevalence of self-reported GS and referral characteristics to secondary care. PATIENTS AND METHODS: A UK population-based questionnaire screened for GS and related symptoms. Diagnostic outcomes were also analyzed in patients referred to secondary care with GS. CD diagnosis entailed a positive coeliac serology (endomysial and/or tissue transglutaminase antibodies) plus Marsh 1-3 on duodenal biopsies. NCGS diagnosis was based on exclusion of CD. Clinical comparisons were made between NCGS and CD. RESULTS: A total of 1002 adults in the population (female 55%, mean age 39 years). The self-reported prevalence for GS was 13% (female 79%, mean age 39.5 years, P<0.0001), with 3.7% consuming a gluten-free diet and 0.8% known to have a doctor diagnosis of CD. Individuals with GS had an increased prevalence of fulfilling the Rome III criteria for irritable bowel syndrome, in comparison with those without GS (20 vs. 3.89%, odds ratio 6.23, P<0.0001).In secondary care 200 GS patients (female 84%, mean age 39.6 years) were investigated, in whom 7% were found to have CD and 93% to have NCGS. All CD patients were human leucocyte antigen DQ2 or DQ8 positive compared with 53% of NCGS cases (P=0.0003). Nutritional deficiencies (P</=0.003), autoimmune disorders (23.1 vs. 9.7%, P=0.0001) and a lower mean BMI (23.7 vs. 25.8, P=0.001) were significantly associated with CD compared with NCGS. CONCLUSION: GS is commonly self-reported with symptoms suggesting an association with irritable bowel syndrome. The majority of patients have NCGS, an entity which demonstrates clinical and immunologic difference to CD.},

   abstract = {The objective of the present paper is to evaluate the post-prandial response to some varieties of gluten free (GF) pasta that are commonly consumed in Italy. The glycaemic responses were compared with a glucose standard in healthy subjects and gluten-free diet celiac subjects. Subjects were served portions of the test foods and a standard food (glucose), on separate occasions, each containing 50 g available carbohydrates. Capillary blood glucose was measured from finger-prick samples in fasted subjects and at 15, 30, 45, 60, 90 and 120 minutes after the consumption of each test food. For each type of pasta, the glycaemic index (GI) was calculated by expressing the incremental area under the blood glucose curve as a percentage of each subject's average incremental area under the blood glucose curve (AUC) for the standard food. Gluten free pasta exhibited a range of GI values from 46 to 66. The glycaemic load (GL) and glycaemic profile (GP) were also calculated. A higher GI value was observed in pasta containing rice flour as the main ingredient. Lower values were observed in pasta obtained using corn or a mixture of corn and rice flour as the main ingredients. The results were confirmed in celiac subjects. The information presented in this paper may be useful in helping celiac people to select low-GI pasta.},

   abstract = {AIMS: Type 1 diabetes mellitus and coeliac disease are two chronic illnesses associated with each other. Both diseases and their treatments can seriously impair quality of life. The objective of the present study was to investigate health-related quality of life in adult patients diagnosed with both Type 1 diabetes and coeliac disease and compare this with healthy control subjects and control subjects who have Type 1 diabetes only. METHODS: A generic measure of health-related quality of life (RAND-36) and a measure of diabetes-specific quality of life (DQOL) questionnaires were sent to patients diagnosed with both Type 1 diabetes and coeliac disease. The control group consisted of patients with Type 1 diabetes without coeliac disease matched for age, gender and socio-economic status. Generic quality of life scores were compared with data from healthy Dutch control subjects. RESULTS: Fifty-seven patients with Type 1 diabetes and coeliac disease were included and no associations between clinical characteristics and quality of life were observed. Women reported a lower quality of life in social functioning, vitality and mental health than men (all P < 0.05). A lower diabetes-specific quality of life was observed regarding diabetes-related worries and social worries in patients with Type 1 diabetes and coeliac disease compared with patients with Type 1 diabetes. Compared with healthy control subjects, quality of life in patients with Type 1 diabetes and coeliac disease was significantly lower, particularly social functioning (Cohen's d = 0.76) and general health perception (Cohen's d = 0.86). CONCLUSIONS: The additional diagnosis of coeliac disease and treatment by gluten-free diet in adult patients with Type 1 diabetes has a considerable, negative impact on quality of life and diabetes-specific quality of life. Women are particularly affected and social functioning and general health perception is compromised.},

   abstract = {BACKGROUND AND AIMS: Advanced glycation end (AGE) products play a role in the progression of diabetic complications. Gluten-free diet (GFD) might affect AGE levels in patients who adhere to a GFD because of coeliac disease (CD). The aim of our study was to compare skin AGE levels and soluble receptor AGE levels (sRAGE) in patients with type 1 diabetes (T1DM) with (T1DM + CD) and without CD (T1DM - CD) and healthy controls. METHODS AND RESULTS: We recruited 25 T1DM + CD and 25 T1DM - CD patients, matched for age, gender, diabetes duration, and glycaemic control alongside 25 healthy controls. We collected demographic, clinical and biochemical characteristics, including skin autofluorescence (AF), sRAGE and hs-CRP levels. The duration of T1DM in patients was 30 +/- 14 (+CD) and 29 +/- 14 years (-CD), whereas CD duration in T1DM + CD patients was 14 +/- 10 years. Skin AF levels in T1DM patients were higher compared to healthy controls (2.5 +/- 0.6 versus 1.9 +/- 0.4, p < 0.01) and skin AF was independently associated with age (r = 0.72, p < 0.01). sRAGE levels were higher in T1DM - CD patients compared to healthy controls (1554 +/- 449 versus 1309 +/- 400, p = 0.049) and independently associated with creatinine levels (r = 0.32, p < 0.01). CONCLUSION: Our study demonstrates that skin AGE and sRAGE levels are elevated in T1DM patients compared with healthy controls. No difference in skin AF or sRAGE levels between T1DM patients with or without CD were observed. The present study suggests that differences in microvascular complications between T1DM and T1DM + CD patients are not due to differences in skin AF or sRAGE levels.},

Objective of the study is to investigate (1) the course of glycemic control at CD diagnosis and after the initiation of a gluten-free diet (GFD) in T1DM patients; (2) the prevalence of diabetic complications in T1DM patients with adult onset of CD. In 20 hospitals in the Netherlands, we identified T1DM patients diagnosed with CD at adult age. We retrospectively collected glycated hemoglobin (HbA1c) levels before CD diagnosis, at CD diagnosis, and the most recent HbA1c levels as well as the presence of nephropathy and retinopathy. The control group consisted of patients with T1DM and negative CD serology matched for age, gender, T1DM duration, and HbA1c levels. Thirty-one patients were eligible with a median duration of T1DM and CD of 27 years (IQR 14-37) and 3 years (IQR 1-8), respectively. The matched control group consisted of 46 patients. HbA1c levels at the moment of CD diagnosis were 7.5 % (IQR 7.1-8) [58 mmol/mol] and at the most recent visit 7.4 % (IQR 6.9-7.9, P = 0.15) [57 mmol/mol] indicating no difference. Prevalence of retinopathy was lower in T1DM + CD group compared with controls, (38.7 vs 67.4 %, P < 0.05), whereas no difference in the prevalence of nephropathy was found between the groups (P = 0.09). In conclusion, T1DM + CD patients have less retinopathy compared to T1DM patients without CD. A GFD possibly favorable affects the development of vascular complications in T1DM patients.},

   abstract = {Gustatory and visceral stimulation from food regulates digestion and nutrient use. Free L-glutamate (Glu) release from digested protein is responsible for umami taste perception in the gut. Moreover, monosodium Glu (MSG) is widely used as a flavor enhancer to add umami taste in various cuisines. Recent studies indicate that dietary Glu sensors and their signal transduction system exist in both gut mucosa and taste cells. Oral Glu sensing has been well studied. In this review, we focus on the role of Glu on digestion and absorption of food. Infusion of Glu into the stomach and intestine increase afferent nerve activity of the gastric and the celiac branches of the vagus nerve, respectively. Luminal Glu also evokes efferent nerve activation of the abdominal vagus nerve branches simultaneously. Additionally, intragastric infusion of Glu activates the insular cortex, limbic system, hypothalamus, nucleus tractus solitaries, and amygdala, as determined by functional magnetic resonance imaging, and is able to induce flavor-preference learning as a result of postingestive effects in rats. These results indicate that Glu signaling via gustatory and visceral pathways plays an important role in the processes of digestion, absorption, metabolism, and other physiological functions via activation of the brain.},

   abstract = {OBJECTIVES: Assessment of treatment response in children with celiac disease (CD) after commencing a strict gluten-free diet (GFD) is generally based on the resolution of clinical features and normalization of serology. Recent adult studies have shown that serologic markers do not correlate with mucosal recovery. We aimed (i) to determine whether anti-tissue transglutaminase immunoglobulin (Ig)A (tTG) and anti-deamidated gliadin peptide IgG (DGP) antibodies are sensitive and specific markers of mucosal recovery in children with CD on a GFD for at least 12 months, and (ii) to determine whether a validated dietary questionnaire of compliance can identify patients with mucosal recovery. METHODS: A total of 150 children with biopsy-proven CD were prospectively evaluated with duodenal biopsies at >/=12 months on GFD, paired with repeat tTG and DGP serology. The biopsies were reviewed in a blinded manner by two histopathologists and graded by Marsh criteria. A validated questionnaire of dietary compliance was also administered. RESULTS: Of 150 children recruited, 27 (18%) had positive serology, 97 (65%) had negative serology, and 26 (17%) had equivocal serology. Of the 97 children with negative serology, none had Marsh type 3 enteropathy. Of the 27 patients with positive serology, only 6 had Marsh type 3 changes. The sensitivity and specificity of serology as a marker of significant mucosal pathology was 75 and 85%, respectively, with a positive predictive value of 22% but a negative predictive value of 98%. Of the 129 (86%) questionnaires completed, 88% reported good or excellent compliance with a GFD (negative predictive value 97%). CONCLUSIONS: This study suggests that follow-up using two serological tests in children with CD on a GFD may obviate the need for repeat mucosal biopsy in the majority of patients. A standardized dietary questionnaire may be useful in identifying patients who require further evaluation.},

   abstract = {BACKGROUND: Celiac disease (CD) is an immune-mediated enteropathy triggered by the ingestion of gluten in genetically susceptible subjects. Although the small intestinal mucosa is the main site of the gut's involvement in CD, other mucosal surfaces belonging to the gastrointestinal tract and the gut-associated lymphoid tissue are known to be affected. AIM: Assuming that the oral mucosa could reflect the histopathological inflammatory alterations of the intestine in CD patients, this study wishes to assess the pattern of T-cell subsets in the oral mucosa of young adults with CD. METHODS: A group of 37 patients (age range 20-38 years; female: male ratio 28:9) with CD were enrolled. Out of 37 patients, 19 patients (group A) followed a gluten free diet (GFD) -2 patients from less than one year; 6 patients between 1 and 5 years; 11 patients more than 5 years- while 18 patients (group B) were still untreated. Fifteen healthy volunteers (age range 18-35 years, female: Male ratio 11:4) served as controls for the CD patients. Ethical approval for the research was granted by the Ethics Committee. Biopsy specimens were taken from normal looking oral mucosa. The immunohistochemical investigation was performed with monoclonal antibodies to CD3, CD4, CD8, and gamma/delta-chains T cell receptor (TCR). RESULTS: The T-lymphocytic inflammatory infiltrate was significantly (p < 0.0001) increased in group B (both compared with group A and with the control group). CONCLUSION: This study confirms the oral cavity to be a site of involvement of CD and its possible diagnostic potentiality in this disease.},

   abstract = {BACKGROUND: Follow-up of celiac disease (CD) patients is recommended for gluten-free diet (GFD) adherence monitoring and complication detection. We recently showed that 35% of children with CD were lost to follow-up (LTFU). We aimed to characterize LTFU population, and thus identify compliance barriers to GFD and follow-up. METHODS: 50 LTFU patients were investigated using a telephone questionnaire, regarding frequency of follow-up, serology testing, and adherence to GFD (using the validated Biagi score). Fifty two regular follow-up patients served as controls. RESULTS: LTFU patients had poor adherence to GFD (average Biagi score of 2.0 +/- 1.4) compared to controls (3.0 +/- 1.0, p < 0.001). Only 22% of LTFU performed periodic celiac serology testing compared to 82% of controls (p < 0.001). LTFU had higher prevalence of positive celiac serology tests (50% compared to 25% of controls, p = 0.01). Fewer LTFU were National Celiac Association members (24%) compared with controls (44%, p = 0.05). Regression analysis showed positive relationships between LTFU and poor adherence to GFD (R(2) = 0.26737, p = 0.001), older age at diagnosis (R(2) = 0.30046, p = 0.03), and non-membership in a celiac association (R(2) = 0.18591, p = 0.0001). CONCLUSION: LTFU is associated with non-adherence to GFD and positive serology. Risk factors for LFTU should be identified and addressed in order to improve patient care.},

   abstract = {BACKGROUND & AIM: There is a paucity of data reflecting the symptomatic responses to dietary gluten (SRDG) in patients with Coeliac Disease (CD). We aimed to determine the type, timing and severity of SRDG with reference to a range of disease-related factors. METHODS: Postal survey of 224 biopsy-proven patients including gluten-free diet (GFD) adherence, symptom checklist, ROME II criteria and The Hospital Anxiety & Depression Scale. Case-note review was also conducted. RESULTS: 26% of respondents were male. Full GFD adherence: n=159 (70%). Irritable bowel syndrome (IBS): n=50 (22%). Anxiety: n=30 (13%); Depression: n=33 (14%); Anxiety & Depression: n=72 (32%). Pruritus, fatigue and bloating were a more common SRDG in the partial/none GFD adherent group (p=ns). Co-existing IBS was associated with a greater prevalence of nausea and fatigue in response to gluten (p=<0.05). Fully GFD adherent patients are more likely to have SRDG <1hr than partial/none adherent (OR 4.8; p=0.004), as are a third of patients with co-existing IBS (OR 1.5; p=0.027) and those patients at risk of both anxiety and depression (OR 1.9; p=0.04). Inadvertent exposure to dietary gluten in the fully GFD adherent group is more likely to result in a severe SRDG in comparison to symptoms arising prior to consistent GFD adherence (OR 2.3; p=0.01). IBS sufferers are also more likely to rate their SRDG as severe in nature (OR 1.4; p=0.038). CONCLUSION: Patients with consistent GFD adherence experience a SRDG faster and more severe in comparison to prior gluten exposure possibly demonstrating an adept immunological response. Anxiety and depression also enhance the speed of symptom onset and co-existing visceral hypersensitivity is a risk factor for severe reactions to dietary gluten.},

   abstract = {This article summarizes recent findings on the role of microRNAs (miRNAs) in biological processes associated with the regulation of chronic inflammation and autoimmunity. miRNAs are small non-coding RNA molecules that have been recently emerged as a new class of modulators of gene expression at the post-transcriptional level. MiRNAs bind to complementary sequences of specific targets of messengers RNA, which can interfere with protein synthesis. We reviewed studies that evaluated the expression patterns of miRNAs in different autoimmune diseases, especially in celiac disease (CD). CD is a chronic enteropathy triggered by gluten proteins, characterized by altered immune responses in genetically susceptible individuals that results in damage to the bowel mucosa. CD has a high prevalence and an effective treatment by a specific diet ("gluten free diet"). Genetic factors confer susceptibility but do not explain the whole disease, suggesting that environmental factors do play a relevant role in the development of the condition.The evaluation of the potential role of miRNA is of particular interest in CD given that these epigenetic mechanisms in the pathogenesis of autoimmune and inflammatory diseases have been recently described. Improving our understanding of miRNAs in CD will contribute to clarify the role of altered epigenetic regulation in the development and course of this disease.},

The presence of AEA and CBR in the gastrointestinal tract highlighted their pathophysiological role in several gut diseases, including celiac disease. Here, we aimed to investigate the expression of CBR at transcriptional and translational levels in the duodenal mucosa of untreated celiac patients, celiac patients on a gluten-free diet for at least 12 months and control subjects. Also biopsies from treated celiac patients cultured ex vivo with peptic-tryptic digest of gliadin were investigated. Our data show higher levels of both CB1 and CB2 receptors during active disease and normal CBR levels in treated celiac patients. In conclusion, we demonstrate an up-regulation of CB1 and CB2 mRNA and protein expression, that points to the therapeutic potential of targeting CBR in patients with celiac disease.},

BEF figured as a potential source of dietary fiber (70.53 g 100 g(-1)), especially of insoluble fiber (67.50 g 100 g(-1)), and gluten-free whole cookies showed increased dietary fiber content by adding 5, 10, 15 and 20% BEF (8.58 to 20.02 g 100 g(-1)) when compared to control cookie (6.91 g 100 g(-1)). The addition of BEF affected diameter, spread ratio, color and texture of cookies. All cookies added with BEF were darker, harder and presented smaller diameter and smaller spread ratio than the control cookie. These difference increased proportionally to level of substitution of BRFSC by BEF. Gluten-free whole cookies with up to 15% BEF were well accepted by consumers. Therefore, the use of BEF in cookies may increase the availability of functional ingredients source of dietary fiber for celiac consumers, add economic value to buriti processing by-products and decrease environmental impacts due to the high amounts of waste generated by buriti processing industries.},

   abstract = {PURPOSE: To elucidate the relative role of the immune system and intestinal epithelium in the ethiopatogenesis of Celiac disease (CD). METHODS: A patient with childhood CD who underwent allogeneic bone marrow transplantation (BMT) for chronic myelogenous leukemia was followed for 5 years after resumption of gluten containing diet. Immunological memory to gliadin epitopes was assessed in the index patient and in 5 newly diagnosed CD patients by standard serology testing and by CFSE-based proliferation assays of peripheral blood CD4+ cells and of intestinal LPL towards gliadin-TTG antigens. Intestinal lymphocytes' origin was determined by combined immuno-histochemistry and fluorescent in-situ hybridiazation (FISH). RESULTS: Over 5 years of follow-up after receiving BMT from a HLA-matched woman and cessation of gluten-free diet, the patient has remained well, with negative periodic antibodies assays and unremarkable serial duodenal biopsies. In vitro proliferation assays showed lack of a memory response of the patient's peripheral blood and lamina propria CD4+ T-cells towards TTG, gliadin or TTG-treated gliadin, whereas memory responses were evident in the newly diagnosed CD patients. Immuno-FISH of post-BMT duodenal mucosa showed that the chromosomal phenotype of all the epithelial cells was XY. In contrast, CD45+ lymphocytic lineage cells were all donor-derived XX cells, presumably originating in the transplanted bone marrow and re-populating the intestinal wall. CONCLUSIONS: CD resolution following allogeneic BMT is associated with absent gliadin-specific memory response, and with a dichotomous lymphocyte-epithelial chimeric intestine. These observations suggest that the pathogenesis of CD is critically dependent upon the immune system rather than the epithelial compartment.},

   abstract = {AIM: To determine the diagnostic accuracy of a new point-of-care assay detecting anti-deamidated gliadin peptides in celiac disease (CD) patients. METHODS: One-hundred-and-twelve patients (age range: 1.8-79.2 years old) with clinical symptoms suggestive of CD and/or first-degree relatives (FDR) of CD patients (n = 66), and confirmed CD on a gluten-free diet (GFD) (n = 46), were prospectively enrolled in the study at Gastroenterology outpatient clinics for adult patients and from the Gastroenterology Consultation Ward at the Pediatric Department of the University Hospital of Geneva. Written informed consent was obtained from all subjects enrolled. The study received approval from the local ethics committee. The original CD diagnosis had been based on serum-positive IgA anti-tissue transglutaminase enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay (ELISA) (QuantaLite, Inova Diagnostics, San Diego, CA, United States) and on biopsy results. Serum samples from all study participants were tested by the new CD lateral flow immunochromatographic assay (CD-LFIA) device, Simtomax(R) Blood Drop (Augurix SA, BioArk, Monthey, Switzerland) to detect immunoglobulin (Ig)A and IgG antibodies against deamidated gliadin peptides. The diagnostic performance was evaluated using receiver operating characteristic curves with 95%CIs. A cut-off of 2 on the Rann colorimetric scale was used to calculate the device's sensitivity and specificity. RESULTS: CD-LFIA was highly accurate in detecting untreated celiac patients. In the group of patients with CD symptoms and/or FDR, eight new cases of CD were detected by ELISA and biopsy. All of these new cases were also correctly identified by CD-LFIA. The test yielded four false positive and four false negative results. The false positive results were all within the groups with clinical symptoms suggestive of CD and/or FDR, whereas the false negative results were all within the GFD group. The test yeld a sensitivity of 78.9% (95%CI: 54.4-93.9) and specificity of 95.7% (95%CI: 89.4-98.8), and the area under the curve reached 0.893 (95%CI: 0.798-0.988). The Kappa coefficient, calculated according to the values obtained by two readers from the same device, was of 0.96 (SE: 0.06). When the GFD patients were excluded from the analysis, the area under the curve reached 0.989 (95%CI: 0.971-1.000) and the Kappa coefficient, calculated according to the values obtained by two readers from the same device, became 0.96 (SE: 0.07). Furthermore, using the Rann scale cut-off of 2 without the GFD patients, sensitivity was 100% and specificity was 93.1% (95%CI: 83.3-98.1). CONCLUSION: The new CD-LFIA rapid screening test shows good diagnostic accuracy, sensitivity and specificity, and may rule out CD in patients with CD-related symptoms.},

   abstract = {BACKGROUND: Nondiarrheal celiac disease (NDCD) is being increasingly reported but data from India is limited. AIM: We undertook this study to compare the clinical spectrum of NDCD with that of diarrheal/classical celiac disease (CCD). METHOD: This facility-based retrospective observational study included consecutive patients diagnosed with celiac disease (CD) (as per modified ESPGHAN criteria) from October 2009 to August 2011. RESULTS: A total of 381 patients were diagnosed with CD during the study period. NDCD was present in 192 (51.8 %). NDCD had higher mean age at presentation (5.8 +/- 2.8 vs. 6.9 +/- 2.9 years respectively; p = 0.003) and longer duration of symptoms prior to diagnosis (2.9 +/- 1.7 years vs. 3.6 +/- 2.2 years; p = 0.02) as compared to CCD. In the NDCD group, the most frequent gastrointestinal (GI) symptoms were recurrent abdominal pain [122 (63.5 %)] and abdominal distension [102 (53.1 %)] followed by constipation [48 (25 %)], vomiting [76 (39.6 %)] and recurrent oral ulcers [89 (46.4 %)]. Vomiting and constipation were more frequently seen in NDCD as compared to CCD (p < 0.001 in both). Commonly enumerated extraintestinal manifestations in NDCD included failure to thrive [109 (56.8 %)], isolated short stature [36 (18.8 %)], persistent anemia [83 (43.2 %)] and hepatomegaly/splenomegaly or both [56 (29.2 %)]. Associated comorbidities included autoimmune thyroiditis [11 (5.7 %)], type 1 diabetes mellitus [8 (4.2 %)], bronchial asthma [23 (11.9 %)], idiopathic pulmonary hemosiderosis [4 (2.1 %)], Down's syndrome [3 (1.6 %)], alopecia areata [6 (3.1 %)], polyarthritis [2 (1.0 %)], dermatitis herpetiformis [6 (3.1 %)] and chronic liver disease [6 (3.1 %)]. The number of patients with a Marsh score IIIb and above of duodenal biopsy was significantly more in the CCD group (p < 0.001). CONCLUSIONS: NDCD is not uncommon in India. Long-term follow up is needed to evaluate the impact of the disease and of treatment in these children.},

Gluten avoidance, which is the only available treatment for CD, could impact on quality of life of children with CD. We present the results of a qualitative study on the emotional impact of gluten free diet (GFD) on the everyday life of children affected with CD. We investigated 76 celiac patients aged 2-18 years (average age: 9.5 years). By using the Critical Incident Technique (CIT), we defined emotions related to difficulties and awkward situations experienced by the patients. Written answers to open-ended questions from either children (older than 8 years) and parents (children younger than 8 years) were analyzed qualitatively. We found 80 dilemmas experienced in three different arenas (food situations at school, meals at home, meals outside) and characterized lived experiences of children with CD in everyday life (specific emotions, difficulties in relationships and in management of daily life). Children with CD experience strong emotions related to the GFD, permeating several aspects of everyday life. These dilemmas may be missed by a conventional, questionnaire-based approach to the psycho-social consequences of CD treatment.},

   abstract = {BACKGROUND: Coeliac disease is a common enteropathy characterized by an increased mortality mainly due to its complications. The natural history of complicated coeliac disease is characterised by two different types of course: patients with a new diagnosis of coeliac disease that do not improve despite a strict gluten-free diet (type A cases) and previously diagnosed coeliac patients that initially improved on a gluten-free diet but then relapsed despite a strict diet (type B cases). Our aim was to study the prognosis and survival of A and B cases. METHODS: Clinical and laboratory data from coeliac patients who later developed complications (A and B cases) and sex- and age-matched coeliac patients who normally responded to a gluten-free diet (controls) were collected among 11 Italian centres. RESULTS: 87 cases and 136 controls were enrolled. Complications tended to occur rapidly after the diagnosis of coeliac disease and cumulative survival dropped in the first months after diagnosis of complicated coeliac disease. Thirty-seven cases died (30/59 in group A, 7/28 in group B). Type B cases presented an increased survival rate compared to A cases. CONCLUSIONS: Complicated coeliac disease is an extremely serious condition with a high mortality and a short survival. Survival depends on the type of natural history.},

   abstract = {OBJECTIVE: Potential celiac disease (PCD) is a form of CD characterized by positive endomysial/tissue transglutaminase antibodies and a preserved duodenal mucosa despite a gluten-containing diet (GCD); it can evolve into flat, active CD. This evolution is, however, not certain. Our aim was to retrospectively study the prevalence and the natural history of adult patients with PCD. METHODS: The clinical notes of all 47 patients with PCD attending our clinic between September 1999 and October 2011 were retrospectively reevaluated. To study their clinical features, patients with active CD, randomly selected and matched for sex and date of birth, served as controls. Symptoms, associated diseases, familiarity, and laboratory data at diagnosis were compared. RESULTS: Prevalence of PCD among all celiac patients directly diagnosed in our center was 42/187, (1/4.4, 18.3%, 95% confidence interval (CI) 13.3-23.4%). Age at diagnosis, laboratory data, prevalence of symptoms, associated diseases, and familiarity for CD did not differ between patients with PCD and those with active CD. Some patients with PCD maintained a normal duodenal mucosa for many years and their symptoms spontaneously improved despite maintaining a GCD. CONCLUSIONS: PCD is not a rare form of CD. Having found no difference at all in age at diagnosis and clinical features between PCD and active CD could suggest that PCD is not a prodrome of CD but is a separate entity that can only subsequently evolve into active CD.},

   abstract = {INTRODUCTION: Coeliac disease is a chronic enteropathy requiring a close follow-up. However, the best way to follow up coeliac patients has not yet been established. In the last 14 years, we have been offering patients a thorough series of periodical examinations including a histological re-evaluation at 12-18 months. PATIENTS AND METHODS: The notes of all coeliac patients attending our clinic between September 1999 and March 2013 were examined. RESULTS: Data from 317 adult patients were collected. Duodenal biopsy showed a lack of satisfactory histological response in 25/317 patients; endomysial antibodies were still positive in 76, and diet adherence and clinical response were unsatisfactory in 58 and 97, respectively. Correlations of serological data, clinical response, and diet adherence with histological findings were evaluated. Although the P values showed statistically significant differences, sensitivity and specificity were disappointing: 64% and 80% for serological response, 48% and 71% for clinical response, 56% and 85% for diet adherence. CONCLUSIONS: After 12-18 months on a gluten-free diet, 8% of the patients do not present a satisfactory histological response; only some of them could have been identified with a serological and/or clinical re-evaluation. Therefore, a duodenal biopsy seems to be the only tool that could identify patients with unsatisfactory histological response.},

   abstract = {The avoidance of wheat- and gluten-containing products is a worldwide phenomenon. While celiac disease is a well-established entity, the evidence base for gluten as a trigger of symptoms in patients without celiac disease (so-called 'non-celiac gluten sensitivity' or NCGS) is limited. The problems lie in the complexity of wheat and the ability of its carbohydrate as well as protein components to trigger gastrointestinal symptoms, the potentially false assumption that response to a gluten-free diet equates to an effect of gluten withdrawal, and diagnostic criteria for coeliac disease. Recent randomized controlled re-challenge trials have suggested that gluten may worsen gastrointestinal symptoms, but failed to confirm patients with self-perceived NCGS have specific gluten sensitivity. Furthermore, mechanisms by which gluten triggers symptoms have yet to be identified. This review discusses the most recent scientific evidence and our current understanding of NCGS.},

   abstract = {Background: Nonceliac gluten sensitivity (NCGS), occurring in patients without celiac disease yet whose gastrointestinal symptoms improve on a gluten-free diet (GFD), is largely a self-reported diagnosis and would appear to be very common. The aims of this study were to characterize patients who believe they have NCGS. Materials and Methods: Advertising was directed toward adults who believed they had NCGS and were willing to participate in a clinical trial. Respondents were asked to complete a questionnaire about symptoms, diet, and celiac investigation. Results: Of 248 respondents, 147 completed the survey. Mean age was 43.5 years, and 130 were women. Seventy-two percent did not meet the description of NCGS due to inadequate exclusion of celiac disease (62%), uncontrolled symptoms despite gluten restriction (24%), and not following a GFD (27%), alone or in combination. The GFD was self-initiated in 44% of respondents; in other respondents it was prescribed by alternative health professionals (21%), dietitians (19%), and general practitioners (16%). No celiac investigations had been performed in 15% of respondents. Of 75 respondents who had duodenal biopsies, 29% had no or inadequate gluten intake at the time of endoscopy. Inadequate celiac investigation was common if the GFD was initiated by self (69%), alternative health professionals (70%), general practitioners (46%), or dietitians (43%). In 40 respondents who fulfilled the criteria for NCGS, their knowledge of and adherence to the GFD were excellent, and 65% identified other food intolerances. Conclusions: Just over 1 in 4 respondents self-reporting as NCGS fulfill criteria for its diagnosis. Initiation of a GFD without adequate exclusion of celiac disease is common. In 1 of 4 respondents, symptoms are poorly controlled despite gluten avoidance.},

We investigated the specific effects of gluten after dietary reduction of fermentable, poorly absorbed, short-chain carbohydrates (fermentable, oligo-, di-, monosaccharides, and polyols [FODMAPs]) in subjects believed to have NCGS. METHODS: We performed a double-blind cross-over trial of 37 subjects (aged 24-61 y, 6 men) with NCGS and irritable bowel syndrome (based on Rome III criteria), but not celiac disease. Participants were randomly assigned to groups given a 2-week diet of reduced FODMAPs, and were then placed on high-gluten (16 g gluten/d), low-gluten (2 g gluten/d and 14 g whey protein/d), or control (16 g whey protein/d) diets for 1 week, followed by a washout period of at least 2 weeks. We assessed serum and fecal markers of intestinal inflammation/injury and immune activation, and indices of fatigue. Twenty-two participants then crossed over to groups given gluten (16 g/d), whey (16 g/d), or control (no additional protein) diets for 3 days. Symptoms were evaluated by visual analogue scales. RESULTS: In all participants, gastrointestinal symptoms consistently and significantly improved during reduced FODMAP intake, but significantly worsened to a similar degree when their diets included gluten or whey protein. Gluten-specific effects were observed in only 8% of participants. There were no diet-specific changes in any biomarker. During the 3-day rechallenge, participants' symptoms increased by similar levels among groups. Gluten-specific gastrointestinal effects were not reproduced. An order effect was observed. CONCLUSIONS: In a placebo-controlled, cross-over rechallenge study, we found no evidence of specific or dose-dependent effects of gluten in patients with NCGS placed diets low in FODMAPs.},

   abstract = {Data are accumulating that emphasize the important role of the intestinal barrier and intestinal permeability for health and disease. However, these terms are poorly defined, their assessment is a matter of debate, and their clinical significance is not clearly established. In the present review, current knowledge on mucosal barrier and its role in disease prevention and therapy is summarized. First, the relevant terms 'intestinal barrier' and 'intestinal permeability' are defined. Secondly, the key element of the intestinal barrier affecting permeability are described. This barrier represents a huge mucosal surface, where billions of bacteria face the largest immune system of our body. On the one hand, an intact intestinal barrier protects the human organism against invasion of microorganisms and toxins, on the other hand, this barrier must be open to absorb essential fluids and nutrients. Such opposing goals are achieved by a complex anatomical and functional structure the intestinal barrier consists of, the functional status of which is described by 'intestinal permeability'. Third, the regulation of intestinal permeability by diet and bacteria is depicted. In particular, potential barrier disruptors such as hypoperfusion of the gut, infections and toxins, but also selected over-dosed nutrients, drugs, and other lifestyle factors have to be considered. In the fourth part, the means to assess intestinal permeability are presented and critically discussed. The means vary enormously and probably assess different functional components of the barrier. The barrier assessments are further hindered by the natural variability of this functional entity depending on species and genes as well as on diet and other environmental factors. In the final part, we discuss selected diseases associated with increased intestinal permeability such as critically illness, inflammatory bowel diseases, celiac disease, food allergy, irritable bowel syndrome, and--more recently recognized--obesity and metabolic diseases. All these diseases are characterized by inflammation that might be triggered by the translocation of luminal components into the host. In summary, intestinal permeability, which is a feature of intestinal barrier function, is increasingly recognized as being of relevance for health and disease, and therefore, this topic warrants more attention.},

   abstract = {Food intolerance is a common complaint amongst patients with functional gastrointestinal (GI) disorders (FGIDs), including those with irritable bowel syndrome (IBS), functional dyspepsia, as well as gastroesophageal reflux disease. Although there has been a longstanding interest in the possible role of food allergy in IBS, there are limited data supporting the association. However, the prevalence of food allergy is sufficiently high that patients with FGID may also have food allergies or hypersensitivities. Food intolerances or sensitivities are reactions to foods, which are not due to immunological mechanisms. Lactose intolerance is common in the general population and can mimic symptoms of FGID or coexist with FGID. As discussed in other articles in this series, other carbohydrate intolerances may be responsible for symptom generation in patients with IBS and perhaps other FGIDs. There is a great interest in the role of a major dietary protein, gluten, in the production of symptoms that are very similar to those of patients with celiac disease without the enteropathy that characterizes celiac disease. Emerging research into a syndrome known as nonceliac gluten sensitivity suggests a heterogeneous condition with some features of celiac disease but often categorized as FGIDs, including IBS. This article summarizes the role of dietary proteins in the symptoms and pathophysiology of FGIDs.},

   abstract = {BACKGROUND: Dermatitis herpetiformis (DH) is a rare gluten-sensitive blistering itchy skin disease, strictly related to coeliac disease (CD). Direct immunofluorescence, demonstrating IgA granular deposits localized either in the dermal papillae or along the dermo-epidermal junction, is currently the gold standard for diagnosis of DH. It has been shown that DH immunocomplexes contain epidermal transglutaminase (eTG) and that sera from patients with DH contain antibodies specifically directed against eTG. OBJECTIVES: We studied the usefulness of serum eTG antibodies in discriminating between DH, CD and other gastrointestinal and dermatologic diseases. METHODS: eTG antibodies were tested in 308 adult patients' sera: 44 patients with untreated dermatitis herpetiformis (UDH), 99 patients with untreated coeliac disease (UCD), 70 dermatological controls and 95 gastrointestinal controls. RESULTS: In UDH eTG antibody levels were significantly higher than in DH patients on gluten-free diet, UCD, gastrointestinal controls and dermatological controls. In UCD eTG antibodies strongly correlated with tissue transglutaminase (tTG) antibodies, whereas in UDH no significant correlation was observed. CONCLUSION: Serum IgA eTG antibody determination can efficiently distinguish UDH from other dermatological itchy diseases and is highly sensitive to gluten-free diet.},

   abstract = {UNLABELLED: Thrombosis events may occur in celiac disease. Thrombophilic risk factors have been reported. INTRODUCTION: To report two cases of cerebral venous thrombosis in celiac disease patients and to determine associated thrombophilic factors. Case 1: a 63-year-old woman was admitted for cerebral venous thrombosis. Her past history included celiac disease which was untreated for the last 10 years. Biological data showed moderate hyperhomocysteinemia and positive reaction for antiphospholipid antibodies. Case 2: a 19-year-old girl was hospitalized for seizures and impaired consciousness. MRA demonstrated longitudinal sinus thrombosis with parietal infarction. Biological findings showed: protein S deficiency and positive reaction for antiendomysium and antigliadin antibodies. Gastroesophageal endoscopy with biopsy showed villous atrophy. Both patients improved under anticoagulant treatment. CONCLUSION: The sites of associated venous thrombosis are generally unusual in celiac disease, yet the cerebral localization is only exceptionally reported. It is essential to search for risk factors. Gluten-free diet remains the mainstay treatment for patients with celiac disease.},

   abstract = {The clinical spectrum for celiac disease (CD) is broad and includes cases with either typical (intestinal) or atypical (extraintestinal) features, often making the diagnosis of CD very difficult.We describe the case of a girl presenting with stunted growth and malnourishment. She was evaluated at 14 months for decreased growth rate without any signs of gastrointestinal, renal or endocrine disorders. She was evaluated for CD, but resulted negative for anti-tTG antibodies.At the age of 4.1 years, she exhibited basal dental enamel hypoplasia, iron deficiency anaemia despite repeated iron supplementation, with persistent reduced height (-2.79 SDS), BMI (-0.76 SDS), growth velocity (-1.79 SDS) and delayed bone age (1.5 year). The CD screening was repeated and very high anti-tTG-IgA (128 IU/ml, normal values < 7 IU/ml) and anti-tTG-IgG (77 IU/ml, normal values < 7 IU/ml) values were found. HLA genotyping revealed an HLA DQ2 haplotype. A duodenal biopsy revealed severe villous atrophy with crypt hyperplasia and increased intraepithelial lymphocytes (> 40 IELs/100 epithelial cells) confirming the diagnosis of CD. A gluten-free diet was started and after only four months, her growth velocity increased from 4.83 cm/year (-1.79 SDS) to 6.53 cm/year (-0.15 SDS).In conclusion, we report the development of a positive serology for CD in an asymptomatic child with growth retardation, who previously was investigated for CD and resulted negative. Therefore, when faced with retarded growth in young patients, after excluding other malabsorption conditions and even when CD serological markers are negative, the paediatric endocrinologist should request HLA genotyping, before the intestinal biopsy, in order to check for the presence of risk alleles.},

   abstract = {BACKGROUND AND AIM: Studies of adults and children with celiac disease (CD) performed mostly in tertiary care centers have reported an increased risk of overweight during gluten-free diet (GFD). We measured body mass index (BMI) of CD children followed by family pediatricians in order to estimate prevalence of underweight and overweight at diagnosis and to describe BMI changes during GFD. METHODS AND RESULTS: We compared 150 CD children (age range 2-16 yrs) under GFD from a median (IQR) time of 4.4 (4.2) years with 288 healthy children matched for gender and age. We also evaluated retrospectively BMI changes between CD diagnosis and the current evaluation. The median (IQR) BMI of CD patients was significantly lower than that of controls [-0.38 (1.46) vs. 0.09 (1.18) SDS, p < 0.0001, Italian reference data]. Using the International Obesity Task Force classifications, CD children were less frequently overweight or obese (12% vs. 23.3%, p = 0.014) and more frequently underweight (16% vs. 4.5%, p < 0.001) than controls. During GFD, there was a marked decrease of number of underweight subjects (13 vs. 27) and a minimal increase of number of overweight subjects (9 vs. 6) (p < 0.001). CONCLUSIONS: The frequency of overweight and obesity at diagnosis of CD and during GFD in children followed by family pediatricians is substantially lower than that reported in tertiary care centers. On the other hand, the high frequency of underweight at diagnosis confirms the need of careful personalized nutritional management.},

   abstract = {Mycotoxins are low molecular weight secondary metabolites produced by certain strains of filamentous fungi such as Aspergillus, Penicillium and Fusarium, which attack crops in the field, and grow on foods also during storage under favorable conditions of temperature and humidity. Foods mainly contributing to the intake of mycotoxins with diet are cereals, maize being the most risky commodity due to the potential co-occurrence of more than one mycotoxin, this can be of particular concern especially for vulnerable group of population such as celiac patients that show increased maize-based products consumption. In this study the exposure of celiac patients to fumonisins (FBs) and zearalenone (ZON) has been assessed. The higher exposures, for all the matrices and for both the selected mycotoxins, were for children age group. The lower and upper bound exposure ranged between 348-582 ng/kg bw/day for FBs and 22-83 ng/kg bw/day for ZON; these values result well below the TDI for the selected mycotoxins, representing the 17-29% and 9-33% of the TDI set for FBs and ZON, respectively. Even considering the worst scenario the exposure values reported for children were lower, namely 1385 ng/kg bw/day for FBs and 237 ng/kg bw/day for ZON, than the corresponding toxicological thresholds.},

   abstract = {OBJECTIVES: In celiac disease (CD), gluten induces both adaptive and innate immune responses. Non-celiac gluten sensitivity (NCGS) is another form of gluten intolerance where the immune response is less characterized. The aim of our study was to explore and compare the early mucosal immunological events in CD and NCGS. METHODS: We challenged 30 HLA-DQ2(+) NCGS and 15 CD patients, all on a gluten-free diet, with four slices of gluten-containing bread daily for 3 days. Duodenal biopsy specimens were collected before and after challenge. The specimens were examined for cytokine mRNA by quantitative reverse transcriptase-PCR and for MxA-expression and CD3(+) intraepithelial lymphocytes (IELs) by immunohistochemistry and compared with specimens from untreated CD patients and disease controls. RESULTS: In CD patients, tumor necrosis factor alpha (P=0.02) and interleukin 8 (P=0.002) mRNA increased after in vivo gluten challenge. The interferon gamma (IFN-gamma) level of treated CD patients was high both before and after challenge and did not increase significantly (P=0.06). Four IFN-gamma-related genes increased significantly. Treated and untreated CD patients had comparable levels of IFN-gamma. Increased expression of MxA in treated CD patients after challenge suggested that IFN-alpha was activated on gluten challenge. In NCGS patients only IFN-gamma increased significantly (P=0.03). mRNA for heat shock protein (Hsp) 27 or Hsp70 did not change in any of the groups. Importantly, we found that the density of IELs was higher in NCGS patients compared with disease controls, independent of challenge, although lower than the level for treated CD patients. CONCLUSIONS: CD patients mounted a concomitant innate and adaptive immune response to gluten challenge. NCGS patients had increased density of intraepithelial CD3(+) T cells before challenge compared with disease controls and increased IFN-gamma mRNA after challenge. Our results warrant further search for the pathogenic mechanisms for NCGS.},

   abstract = {The aim of this review was to identify, evaluate and summarize all relevant studies reporting on the clinical response to gluten challenge by adult or pediatric patients with suspected or diagnosed coeliac disease (CD) on a gluten-free diet. We evaluated the effect of gluten challenge on changes in symptoms, intestinal mucosa histology, and serum antibodies. A systematic electronic search was performed for studies published as of 1966 using PubMed and Scopus databases. In the reviewed studies, doses ranged from 0.2 to 30 g/day of wheat gluten or comprised a gluten-containing diet. The onset of symptoms upon gluten intake varied largely from days to months and did not parallel serum antibody or histological changes. Within 3 months of gluten challenge, 70%-100% of pediatric CD patients became positive for AGA-IgA and EMA-IgA antibodies and 50%-70% for AGA-IgG. A limited number of trials suggest that no more than half of adult patients developed positive AGA-IgA, EMA-IgA, tTG-IgA or DGP-IgA/IgG titers. Approximately 50%-100% of pediatric and adult patients experienced mucosal relapse of gluten provocation within 3 months, which was preceded by increased mucosal intra-epithelial lymphocytes within several days of challenge. A 3-month high-dose gluten challenge should be suitable to diagnose the majority of CD patients. In some cases prolonged challenge may be needed to verify diagnosis. Combination testing for antibodies and mucosal histology may fasten the diagnosis.},

   abstract = {BACKGROUND & AIMS: Nonceliac gluten-sensitive (NCGS) patients report intestinal and extra-intestinal symptoms shortly after ingesting gluten; these symptoms disappear on gluten-free diets, although these patients have no serologic markers of celiac disease or intestinal damage. In fact, there is no evidence for mucosal or serologic modifications in those individuals. We investigated immunologic responses of duodenal mucosa samples and peripheral blood basophils, isolated from NCGS patients, after exposure to gliadin. METHODS: Participants underwent a complete clinical evaluation to exclude celiac disease while on a gluten-containing diet, a skin prick test to exclude wheat allergy, and upper endoscopy (n = 119) at 2 tertiary medical centers in Italy. Patients were considered to have NCGS based on their symptoms and the current definition of the disorder. Subjects were assigned to the following groups: patients with celiac disease on gluten-free diets (n = 34), untreated patients with celiac disease (n = 35), patients with NCGS (n = 16), or controls (n = 34). Duodenal biopsy samples collected during endoscopy were incubated with gliadin peptides, and levels of inflammatory markers were assessed. Peripheral blood basophils were extracted and incubated with gliadin peptides or a mix of wheat proteins; activation was assessed based on levels of CD203c, CD63, and CD45. RESULTS: Duodenal mucosa samples collected from 69 patients with celiac disease showed markers of inflammation after incubation with gliadin. Some, but not all, markers of inflammation were detected weakly in biopsy samples from 3 controls and 3 NCGS patients (P = .00 for all markers). There were no significant increases in the levels of CD63 and CD203c in NCGS patients. CONCLUSIONS: Unlike the duodenal mucosa from patients with celiac disease, upon incubation with gliadin, mucosa from patients with NCGS does not express markers of inflammation, and their basophils are not activated by gliadin. The in vitro gliadin challenge therefore should not be used to diagnose NCGS.},

Currently, the treatment is dietary withdrawal of gluten, but commercial gluten-free bread presents some undesirable properties. The objective of this study has been to assess the ability of the enzyme caricain (from papaya latex) to detoxify gliadin in whole wheat flour and develop bread suitable for coeliacs and gluten intolerant individuals. Ion exchange chromatography was used to enrich the caricain in papaya latex and an enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay test kit was used for the analysis of gliadin residues in the baked bread. The partially purified enzyme was found to be more effective in reducing gliadin content than the crude papain and the resultant loaves had acceptable crumb and crust characteristics. Caricain appears to be capable of detoxifying gliadin and has the potential to mitigate the problems confronting coeliacs.},

   abstract = {BACKGROUND: Autism is now a common condition with a prevalence of 1 in 88 children. There is no known etiology. Speculation about possible treatments for autism or autism spectrum disorders (ASD) has included the use of various dietary interventions, including a gluten-free diet. OBJECTIVE: The goal of this article was to review the literature available evaluating the use of gluten-free diets in patients with autism to determine if diet should be instituted as a treatment. METHODS: A literature review was performed, identifying previously published studies in which a gluten-free diet was instituted as an autism treatment. These studies were not limited to randomized controlled trials because only 1 article was available that used a double-blind crossover design. Most publish reports were unblinded, observational studies. RESULTS: In the only double-blind, crossover study, no benefit of a gluten-free diet was identified. Several other studies did report benefit from gluten-free diet. Controlling for observer bias and what may have represented unrelated progress over time in these studies is not possible. There are many barriers to evaluating treatment benefits for patients with autism. Gluten sensitivity may present in a variety of ways, including gastrointestinal and neurologic symptoms. Although making a diagnosis of celiac disease is easier with new serology and genetic testing, a large number of gluten-sensitive patients do not have celiac disease. Testing to confirm non-celiac gluten sensitivity is not available. CONCLUSIONS: A variety of symptoms may be present with gluten sensitivity. Currently, there is insufficient evidence to support instituting a gluten-free diet as a treatment for autism. There may be a subgroup of patients who might benefit from a gluten-free diet, but the symptom or testing profile of these candidates remains unclear.},

Clinically, collagenous sprue is characterized by persistent diarrhoea, severe malabsorption, multiple nutrient deficiencies and progressive weight loss. Differential diagnosis includes celiac disease, which is mandatory to rule out because of their frequent association. Glutenfree diet is the first therapeutic step, but it usually is not effective. However, recent studies show high success rates with immunomodulators, mainly corticosteroids. We report the case of a patient presenting with chronic diarrhea and severe malabsorption who was diagnosed with collagenous sprue, with no response to gluten free diet, but with excellent response to budesonida.},

The induction of Treg activity by probiotics might be effective for promoting tolerance towards food allergens. Nasal cytology is useful in patients with rhinitis for diagnosing chronic non-allergic non-infectious diseases. Atopic eczema is associated both with an aberrant skin matrix and impaired systemic immune response. Therefore, isolated topical treatment may have suboptimal effect. Diagnostic work-up of exercise-induced anaphylaxis, including exercise challenge test, is necessary to reach a diagnosis. Studies may support a role for nutrition on prevention of asthma and cardiovascular diseases. Clinicians need to early identify adolescent menstrual abnormalities to minimize sequelae, and to promote health information. In Multiple Endocrine Neoplasia type 2B investigations include acetylcholinesterase study of rectal mucosa followed by the molecular analysis of RET mutation. Low adherence to gluten-free diet and osteopenia are common problems in children with diabetes mellitus type 1 and celiac disease. In infantile colic, laboratory tests are usually unnecessary and the treatment is based on reassurance. Prevalence of obesity and stunting is elucidated by several studies. Evidences are growing that dietetic measures are needed to prevent obesity in children with acute leukemia. Treatment studies for infectious diseases show promise for probiotics along with standard triple therapy in children with Helicobacter pilori infection, while zinc has no effect on pneumonia. Educational programs about the proper management of the febrile child are warranted. A new hour-specific total serum bilirubin nomogram has been shown to be able to predict newborns without hyperbilirubinemia after 48 to 72 hours of life. Newborns with hypoxic-ischemic encephalopathy present ECG and cardiac enzymes alterations leading to reduced neonatal survival. Rehabilitation programs including sensory integration therapy and motor performance, may improve activities of daily life in children with developmental coordination disorder. Aerobic exercise training in addition to chest physiotherapy might be useful in children with cystic fibrosis. Studies on effectiveness of leukotriene receptor antagonists, alone or with other drugs in preschool wheezing are needed.},

There are no established laboratory markers for non-celiac gluten sensitivity, although a high prevalence of first generation anti-gliadin antibodies of IgG class has been reported in this condition. This study was designed to characterize the effect of the gluten-free diet on anti-gliadin antibodies of IgG class in patients with non-celiac gluten sensitivity. METHODS: Anti-gliadin antibodies of both IgG and IgA classes were assayed by ELISA in 44 non-celiac gluten sensitivity and 40 celiac disease patients after 6 months of gluten-free diet. RESULTS: The majority of non-celiac gluten sensitivity patients (93.2%) showed the disappearance of anti-gliadin antibodies of IgG class after 6 months of gluten-free diet; in contrast, 16/40 (40%) of celiac patients displayed the persistence of these antibodies after gluten withdrawal. In non-celiac gluten sensitivity patients anti-gliadin antibodies IgG persistence after gluten withdrawal was significantly correlated with the low compliance to gluten-free diet and a mild clinical response. CONCLUSIONS: Anti-gliadin antibodies of the IgG class disappear in patients with non-celiac gluten sensitivity reflecting a strict compliance to the gluten-free diet and a good clinical response to gluten withdrawal.},

   abstract = {Gluten, a common component in the human diet, is capable of triggering coeliac disease pathogenesis in genetically predisposed individuals. Although the function of human digestive proteases in gluten proteins is quite well known, the role of intestinal microbiota in the metabolism of proteins is frequently underestimated. The aim of this study was the isolation and characterisation of the human gut bacteria involved in the metabolism of gluten proteins. Twenty-two human faecal samples were cultured with gluten as the principal nitrogen source, and 144 strains belonging to 35 bacterial species that may be involved in gluten metabolism in the human gut were isolated. Interestingly, 94 strains were able to metabolise gluten, 61 strains showed an extracellular proteolytic activity against gluten proteins, and several strains showed a peptidasic activity towards the 33-mer peptide, an immunogenic peptide in patients with coeliac disease. Most of the strains were classified within the phyla Firmicutes and Actinobacteria, mainly from the genera Lactobacillus, Streptococcus, Staphylococcus, Clostridium and Bifidobacterium. In conclusion, the human intestine exhibits a large variety of bacteria capable of utilising gluten proteins and peptides as nutrients. These bacteria could have an important role in gluten metabolism and could offer promising new treatment modalities for coeliac disease.},

   abstract = {Dietary olive oil supplementation and more recently, olive oil phenols have been recommended as important therapeutic interventions in preventive medicine. Ole has several pharmacological properties, including antioxidant, anti-inflammatory, antiatherogenic, anticancer, antimicrobial, and antiviral and for these reasons, is becoming an important subject of study in recent years. The aim of this study was to investigate the effects of Ole aglycone on the modulation of the secondary events in mice subjected to intestinal IRI. This was induced in mice by clamping the superior mesenteric artery and the celiac trunk for 30 min, followed by release of the clamp, allowing reperfusion for 1 h. After 60 min of reperfusion, animals were killed for histological examination of the ileum tissue and immunohistochemical localization of proinflammatory cytokines (TNF-alpha and IL-1beta) and adhesion molecules (ICAM-1 and P-sel); moreover, by Western blot analysis, we investigated the activation of NF-kappaB and IkappaBalpha. In addition, we evaluated the apoptosis process, as shown by TUNEL staining and Bax/Bcl-2 expressions. The results obtained by the histological and molecular examinations showed in Ole aglycone-treated mice, a decrease of inflammation and apoptosis pathway versus SAO-shocked mice. In conclusion, we propose that the olive oil compounds, in particular, the Ole aglycone, could represent a possible treatment against secondary events of intestinal IRI.},

Thus, two sub-objectives were considered: (1) to assess the occurrence of AFs in food marketed in Catalonia, and (2) to assess the consumption of those foods susceptible to AFs contamination by Catalonian population. AFs were analysed in a total of 603 samples considering special commodities as free-gluten, ethnic or baby foods. Analytical method consisted of an extraction and clean-up of aflatoxins step using immunoaffinity columns, and determination by HPLC with post-column photochemical derivatization and fluorescence detection. Food dietary intake was assessed using a food frequency questionnaire, administered to 1387 individuals by trained interviewers. Contamination and consumption raw datasets were combined by means of a direct method and a stochastic method, building the pseudo-parametric bootstrap confidence intervals of the main outputs. Margins of exposure (MoE) and cancer incidence were estimated for the different collectives. The highest percentages of positive samples were found in red pepper, pistachios and peanuts. Considering our results, the most exposed group was the celiac sufferer collective followed by the adolescents; however health concern should not be expected in the population groups.},

   abstract = {Celiac Disease (CD) is a chronic inflammatory enteropathy, triggered in genetically susceptible individuals by dietary gluten. Gluten is able to elicit proliferation of specific T cells and secretion of inflammatory cytokines in the small intestine. In this study we investigated the possibility that p10-mer, a decapeptide from durum wheat (QQPQDAVQPF), which was previously shown to prevent the activation of celiac peripheral lymphocytes, may exert an inhibitory effect on peptic-tryptic digested gliadin (PT-Gly)-stimulated intestinal carcinoma CACO-2 cells. In these cells, incubated with PT-Gly or p31-43 alpha-gliadin derived peptide in the presence or in the absence of p10-mer, IRAK1 activation and NF-kB, ERK1/2 and p38 MAPK phosphorylation were measured by immunoblotting, Cyclooxigenase 2 (COX-2) activity by PGE-2 release assay, and production of cytokines in the cell supernatants by ELISA. Our results showed that pre-treatment of CACO-2 cells with p10-mer significantly inhibited IRAK1 activation and NF-kB, ERK1/2 and p38 MAPK phosphorylation, as well as COX-2 activity (i.e. PGE-2 release) and production of the IL-6 and IL-8 pro-inflammatory cytokines, induced by gliadin peptides. These findings demonstrate the inhibitory effect of the p10-mer peptide on inflammatory response in CACO-2 cells. The results of the present study show that this p10-mer peptide can modulate "in vitro" the inflammatory response induced by gliadin peptides, allowing to move towards new therapeutic strategies. Turning off the inflammatory response, may in fact represent a key target in the immunotherapy of celiac disease.},

To satisfy the increasing demand for healthier products, this research focused on the effects of the supplementation of Psyllium (P) and sugar beet fibre (SB) on the mixing and leavening behaviour of gluten-free doughs. Four doughs, having different consistencies that made them suitable to be poured into moulds or to be shaped, and their corresponding breads were evaluated. The results obtained suggested that a lower consistency is preferred to assure good dough performances during leavening, in particular when ingredients having a high water affinity are included into the recipe. Both P and SB improved the workability of the doughs, but P played a central role on GF bread development, thanks to its film forming ability, and evidenced a more effective antistaling effect, thanks to its high water binding capacity.},

ITFs can provide structure and gas retention during baking, thus improving GFB quality by yielding better specific volume, softer crumb, improved crust and crumb browning with enhanced sensory acceptance. During baking, approximately one-third of the ITFs was lost. The addition of 12% ITFs to the basic formulation is required in order to obtain GFB enriched with 8% ITFs (4 g of fructans per 50 g bread serving size), levels that can provide health benefits. 12% ITFs-addition level decreased GFB glycemic index (from 71 to 48) and glycemic load (from 12 to 8). Prebiotic ITFs are a promising improver for GFB that can provide nutritional (11% dietary fiber content, low glycemic response) and functional benefits to patients with celiac disease, since ITFs are prebiotic ingredients that can also increase calcium absorption.},

METHODS: Cellular activity of COLOSTRO NONI has been tested in an in vitro model of intestinal epithelium based on Caco-2 cell line. We tested the ability of COLOSTRO NONI to stimulate cellular turnover evaluating cell growth rate with WST-1 proliferation assay. We also tested the ability of COLOSTRO NONI to increase the gene expression of Interleukin-8 (IL-8) with a Real Time PCR assay. IL-8 is a fundamental chemotactic factor involved in inflammatory phenomena and in the control of tissue homeostasis. RESULTS: COLOSTRO NONI is able to stimulate cell turnover in the proposed in vitro model and demonstrates active in increasing the gene expression of IL-8. Both aspects observed are fundamental for the establishment of mechanisms to repair tissue damage. CONCLUSION: Obtained results indicate that COLOSTRO NONI could find clinical application in treatment of gastrointestinal disorders characterized by impairment of proper intestinal permeability, in inflammatory bowel diseases, in dysenteric diseases, in gastritis and in forms of pathological alteration of the mucous layer as celiac disease and gluten sensitivity.},

The aims of our study were to: 1) evaluate the frequency of FH in patients with irritable bowel syndrome (IBS)-like clinical presentation; and 2) compare the diagnostic accuracy of two different methods of in vitro basophil activation tests. METHODS: Three hundred and five patients (235 females, age range 18-66 years) were included and underwent a diagnostic elimination diet and successive double-blind placebo-controlled (DBPC) challenges. Two different methods of in vitro basophil activation tests (BAT) (CD63 expression after in vitro wheat or cow's milk proteins stimulation) were evaluated: one was performed on separated leukocytes, and the other on whole blood. RESULTS: Ninety patients of the 305 studied (29.5%) were positive to the challenges and were diagnosed as suffering from FH. BAT on separate leukocytes showed a sensitivity of 86% and a specificity of 91% in FH diagnosis. BAT on whole blood showed a sensitivity of 15%-20% and a specificity of 73% in FH diagnosis (p<0.0001 compared to the other method). CONCLUSIONS: About one third of the IBS patients included in the study were suffering from FH and were cured on the elimination diet. The BAT based on CD63 detection on whole blood samples did not work in FH diagnosis and showed a significantly lower sensitivity, specificity and diagnostic accuracy than the assay based on separated leukocytes.},

   abstract = {OBJECTIVES: Non-celiac wheat sensitivity (NCWS) is a newly described clinical entity characterized by symptoms, which can involve the gastrointestinal tract, the nervous system, the skin, and other organs. There is little data on the pathogenesis of NCWS and it is probable that different pathogenic mechanisms are involved in the different clinical manifestations of the disease. The only common denominator of NCWS "syndrome" is wheat consumption: the symptoms disappear on exclusion of wheat from the diet, and reappear on wheat consumption. The objective of this study was to review our prior data regarding NCWS and to review relevant medical literature regarding NCWS, with particular attention to the hypothesis that NCWS patients could suffer from non-immunoglobulin E (IgE)-mediated wheat allergy. METHODS: We reviewed our data on 276 patients diagnosed with NCWS by means of double-blind placebo-controlled (DBPC) wheat challenge. The data indicating a possible wheat allergy diagnosis were examined and other data in the literature were reviewed; we review the role of serum immunoglobulin G antibodies and the basophil activation assay in food allergy, and the histology findings in the food allergy diagnosis. RESULTS: The comparison between patients suffering from NCWS and presenting with irritable bowel syndrome (IBS) and controls with IBS not due to NCWS showed that NCWS was characterized by: a personal history of food allergy in the pediatric age (0.01), coexistent atopic diseases (0.0001), positive serum anti-gliadin (0.0001) and anti-betalactoglobulin (0.001) antibodies, positive cytofluorimetric assay revealing in vitro basophil activation by food antigens (0.0001), and a presence of eosinophils in the intestinal mucosa biopsies (0.0001). CONCLUSIONS: Patients with NCWS and multiple food sensitivity show several clinical, laboratory, and histological characteristics that suggest they might be suffering from non-IgE-mediated food allergy. However, other pathogenic mechanisms need to be considered.},

   abstract = {BACKGROUND: Non-celiac gluten sensitivity (NCGS) or 'wheat sensitivity' (NCWS) is included in the spectrum of gluten-related disorders. No data are available on the prevalence of low bone mass density (BMD) in NCWS. Our study aims to evaluate the prevalence of low BMD in NCWS patients and search for correlations with other clinical characteristics. METHODS: This prospective observation study included 75 NCWS patients (63 women; median age 36 years) with irritable bowel syndrome (IBS)-like symptoms, 65 IBS and 50 celiac controls. Patients were recruited at two Internal Medicine Departments. Elimination diet and double-blind placebo controlled (DBPC) wheat challenge proved the NCWS diagnosis. All subjects underwent BMD assessment by Dual Energy X-Ray Absorptiometry (DXA), duodenal histology, HLA DQ typing, body mass index (BMI) evaluation and assessment for daily calcium intake. RESULTS: DBPC cow's milk proteins challenge showed that 30 of the 75 NCWS patients suffered from multiple food sensitivity. Osteopenia and osteoporosis frequency increased from IBS to NCWS and to celiac disease (CD) (P <0.0001). Thirty-five NCWS patients (46.6%) showed osteopenia or osteoporosis. Low BMD was related to low BMI and multiple food sensitivity. Values of daily dietary calcium intake in NCWS patients were significantly lower than in IBS controls. CONCLUSIONS: An elevated frequency of bone mass loss in NCWS patients was found; this was related to low BMI and was more frequent in patients with NCWS associated with other food sensitivity.

   abstract = {BACKGROUND: Since celiac disease-associated mucosal lesions are patchy, the diagnosis of the disease requires histological evaluation of multiple duodenal biopsies. AIM: To examine whether adequate biopsy sampling in either the bulb or distal duodenum is sufficient to diagnose celiac disease. METHODS: Twenty-five patients with positive celiac disease-specific serology and 17 patients with negative serology, who were on a gluten-containing diet, and 13 celiac disease patients on a gluten-free diet were consecutively and prospectively enrolled. Mucosal damage, anti-transglutaminase-2 IgA deposits, interferon-gamma, interleukin-17A and interleukin-15 transcripts were evaluated in bulb and distal duodenal biopsies. RESULTS: All patients with positive celiac disease-specific serology exhibited villous atrophy in both duodenal sites. In this group, mucosal anti-transglutaminase-2 IgA deposits were found in 24/25 (96%) bulb samples and 22/25 (88%) distal duodenal samples. No villous atrophy was documented in patients with negative serology. Interferon-gamma and interleukin-17A were over-expressed in both duodenal sites of patients with villous atrophy, unlike patients with normal duodenal morphology (p<0.001). Among treated celiac disease patients, 2 (15.4%) had villous atrophy exclusively in the bulb and 6 (46.2%) had minimal histological abnormalities at both sites. CONCLUSION: Sampling in the bulb and distal duodenum could be sufficient to diagnose/exclude celiac disease.},

   abstract = {RCD [refractory CD (coeliac disease)] is characterized by severe symptoms/signs of malabsorption and mucosal damage unresponsive to a GFD (gluten-free diet). The pathogenesis of RCD is not fully understood. In the present paper, we have characterized the mucosal profile of effector cytokines in RCD. Duodenal biopsies were taken from patients with RCD, patients with active CD and normal controls and were analysed for inflammatory cytokines by real-time PCR and ELISA. IFN (interferon)-gamma and IL (interleukin)-21 transcripts were increased in active CD patients but not in RCD patients as compared with normal controls, whereas IL-17A RNA was up-regulated in both active CD and RCD. No significant increase in IL-15 transcripts was observed in both active CD and RCD, whereas IL-15 protein was increased in active CD. IL-6 and TNF (tumour necrosis factor)-alpha were up-regulated only in RCD. As a proof, we present the case of a woman affected by RCD who responded to anti-TNF-alpha treatment with improvement of malabsorptive symptoms/signs but no healing of mucosal lesions. The findings indicate that the profile of mucosal effector cytokines differs between RCD and active CD and suggest that TNF-alpha, IL-6 and IL-17A, but not Th1-type cytokines, could drive the detrimental response in this condition.},

   abstract = {Reduced levels of iron, folate, vitamin B12, vitamin D, zinc, and magnesium are common in untreated celiac disease (CD) patients probably due to loss of brush border proteins and enzymes needed for the absorption of these nutrients. In the majority of patients, removal of gluten from the diet leads to histological recovery and normalization of iron, vitamin, and mineral levels. Iron deficiency anemia is the most common extra-intestinal sign of CD and usually resolves with adherence to a gluten-free diet. However, deficiencies of both folate and vitamin B12 may persist in some patients on a gluten-free diet, thus requiring vitamin supplementation to improve subjective health status. Similarly, exclusion of gluten from the diet does not always normalize bone mineral density; in these cases, supplementation of vitamin D and calcium is recommended. Resolution of mucosal inflammation may not be sufficient to abrogate magnesium deficiency. Since gluten-free cereal products have a lower magnesium content as compared with gluten-containing counterparts, a magnesium-enriched diet should be encouraged in CD patients. In this article we discuss the frequency and clinical relevance of nutrient deficiency in CD and whether and when nutrient supplementation is needed.},

   abstract = {Gluten can cause extraintestinal manifestations with or without gastrointestinal symptoms and elevated antitissue transglutaminase 2 (tTG2) autoantibodies. Organ-specific gluten reaction involves immune response toward other transglutaminase (TG) isoforms including tTG3 (expressed in the skin, leading to dermatitis herpetiformis) and tTG6 (expressed in the brain, causing gluten ataxia). This analysis focuses on tTG6 antibodies, which have never been studied before in schizophrenia (SZ) and its relationships to tTG2 and to antigliadin antibodies. We previously showed an increased prevalence of tTG2 antibodies in gluten sensitive SZ patients compared with healthy controls (HC) that was not paralleled by an increased prevalence of antiendomysial antibody. To elucidate this discrepancy, we examined those tTG2 positive SZ patients for the presence of tTG6 antibody. We also searched for tTG6 antibodies in our sample of antigliadin (AGA) positive and AGA and tTG2 negative SZ patients. Seventy-four tTG2 positive SZ patients were compared with 148 age and gender-matched HC. Of the 74 tTG2 positive SZ patients, 16 were positive for tTG6 IgA for a prevalence of 22%. Only 4 HC were positive for tTG6 IgA for a prevalence of 2.7%. Among the AGA positive SZ patients, the prevalence of tTG6 IgA was 21.3% while 13.1% of the AGA and tTG2 negative SZ patients were positive for tTG6 IgA. The HC had a prevalence of 6%. Our results indicate a higher prevalence of tTG6 antibodies in SZ that may represent a biomarker useful to identify SZ patients who would benefit from a gluten-free diet.},

   abstract = {PURPOSE: Celiac disease (CD) is an immuno-mediated small bowel disease characterized by chronic inflammation due to a permanent intolerance to gliadin. Several neurological complications have been described, including epilepsy, whose evolution might often improve by adopting gluten-free diet (GFD). We studied a population of adult patients affected by posterior drug-resistant epilepsy of unknown cause by performing an accurate screening for CD. In the selected patients presenting the association of epilepsy and CD, we characterized the related electro-clinical features. MATERIALS AND METHODS: We consecutively identified 211 adult subjects affected by drug-resistant cryptogenic focal epilepsy with posterior seizures. All these patients underwent serological screening for CD. In 10 subjects positive serological tests allowed to perform a CD diagnosis (confirmed by duodenal biopsy). For each patient clinical and EEG data, neuroimaging studies, serological and histological findings were revised, as well as response to GFD, defined as an improvement in seizure outcome. RESULTS: A significant delay between diagnosis of epilepsy and CD was documented. Visual ictal manifestations were reported in half of subjects. In all cases, interictal EEG showed slow and epileptiform abnormalities over parietal-occipital and temporal regions; in three cases, FOS phenomenon was observed. Four patients had familiar history of CD and six cases showed clinical signs/symptoms of malabsorption. GFD led to a reduction of seizure frequency in half of patients. CONCLUSIONS: "Posterior" ictal semiology, peculiar EEG patterns and drug-resistance emerge as the most interesting characteristics. CD screening should be performed in epilepsy patients presenting such features.},

To investigate the cause and prevalence of altered liver function tests in coeliac patients, basally and after 1 year of gluten-free diet. PATIENTS AND METHODS: Data from 245 untreated CD patients (196 women and 49 men, age range 15-80 years) were retrospectively analysed and the liver function tests before and after diet, as well as associated liver pathologies, were assessed. RESULTS: Overall, 43/245 (17.5%) patients had elevated values of one or both aminotransferases; the elevation was mild (<5 times the upper reference limit) in 41 (95%) and marked (>10 times the upper reference limit) in the remaining 2 (5%) patients. After 1 year of gluten-free diet, aminotransferase levels normalized in all but four patients with HCV infection or primary biliary cirrhosis. CONCLUSIONS: In coeliac patients, hypertransaminaseaemia at diagnosis and the lack of normalization of liver enzymes after 12 months of diet suggest coexisting liver disease. In such instance, further evaluation is recommended to exclude the liver disease. Early recognition and treatment of coeliac disease in patients affected by liver disease are important to improve the liver function and prevent complications.},

   abstract = {INTRODUCTION: celiac disease is a chronic condition that requires continued treatment, with the resultant impact on health-related quality of life (HRQOL) of people who suffer it. Most studies in this field have used generic questionnaires to measure HRQOL in celiac patients. It was therefore decided to conduct a study to translate into Spanish and validate a specific questionnaire for celiac disease, the Celiac Disease Quality Of Life Survey (CD-QOL). OBJECTIVES: to translate and validate in Spanish the specific celiac disease questionnaire CD-QOL. METHODS: a multicenter, prospective, observational study was designed consisting of two phases: In the first phase, the questionnaire was translated and adapted into Spanish using the translation/back translation procedure and an understandability study. In the second phase, internal consistency of the translated questionnaire was analyzed. For this, results of the CD-QOL were compared to those of EuroQol and the Daily Fatigue Impact Scale (D-FIS). Understandability of the translated and adapted questionnaire was tested in six patients, and the validation study was done in 298 celiac patients (201 treated with a gluten-free diet and 97 at diagnosis). RESULTS: in both celiac groups, Cronbach s alpha coefficient was high (0.90), feasibility was excellent (99.2 % of patients completed all questions), and there were no ceiling and floor effects. Spearman correlation to EuroQol and D-FIS was statistically significant (p < 0.05). CD-QOL score was different depending on whether state of health was good, fair, or poor based on the EuroQol score. CONCLUSION: the Spanish version of the CD-QOL is a valid tool for measuring HRQOL in celiac patients.},

When non-classical symptoms are present, the diagnosis is not easy and it becomes even more difficult when CD is associated with endometriosis, representing a diagnostic challenge for medical practitioners and gynecologists. CASE REPORT: A 34-year-old patient presented to the authors' observation with primary infertility. Formerly she was treated for endometriosis and the diagnosis of CD was delayed. A favorable clinical and serological response following a gluten-free-diet (GFD) was achieved and a successful pregnancy was obtained. DISCUSSION: This case report emphasizes the role of the CD in women's infertility and the possible association between CD and endometriosis. Even if the relationship between these two diseases is still unclear and further studies to address this issue are required, more attention from gynecologists is needed, considering that the later this association is diagnosed, the greater the probability of adverse outcomes of health developing.},

   abstract = {Celiac disease is an autoimmune enteropathy caused by gluten in genetically predisposed individuals. In celiac disease, adaptive and innate immune activation results in intestinal damage and a wide range of clinical manifestations. In the past, celiac disease was thought to result in signs and symptoms solely related to the gastrointestinal tract. Now, more than half of the adult population presents with extra-intestinal manifestations that can also be expected to improve on a gluten-free diet. For this reason, it is recommended that physicians have a low threshold of suspicion for celiac disease. Current knowledge of the immune pathogenesis of this autoimmune disease has served as a catalyst for the development of novel diagnostic tools and therapeutics. Over the years, highly sensitive and specific serological assays, in addition to genetic markers, have been found to target specific steps in the cascade pathway of celiac disease. Also the advent of the gluten challenge has enabled experts to design diagnostic algorithms and monitor clinical responses in clinical trials. The gluten challenge has provided substantial benefit in the advance of novel therapeutics as an adjuvant treatment to the gluten free diet. Generally, a strict gluten-free diet is highly burdensome to patients and can be limited in its efficacy. Alternative therapies-including gluten modification, modulation of intestinal permeability and immune response-could be central to the future treatment of celiac disease.},

   abstract = {Non Celiac Gluten sensitivity (NCGS) was originally described in the 1980s and recently a "re-discovered" disorder characterized by intestinal and extra-intestinal symptoms related to the ingestion of gluten-containing food, in subjects that are not affected with either celiac disease (CD) or wheat allergy (WA). Although NCGS frequency is still unclear, epidemiological data have been generated that can help establishing the magnitude of the problem. Clinical studies further defined the identity of NCGS and its implications in human disease. An overlap between the irritable bowel syndrome (IBS) and NCGS has been detected, requiring even more stringent diagnostic criteria. Several studies suggested a relationship between NCGS and neuropsychiatric disorders, particularly autism and schizophrenia. The first case reports of NCGS in children have been described. Lack of biomarkers is still a major limitation of clinical studies, making it difficult to differentiate NCGS from other gluten related disorders. Recent studies raised the possibility that, beside gluten, wheat amylase-trypsin inhibitors and low-fermentable, poorly-absorbed, short-chain carbohydrates can contribute to symptoms (at least those related to IBS) experienced by NCGS patients. In this paper we report the major advances and current trends on NCGS.},

   abstract = {The prevalence of celiac disease (CD) varies greatly, but several reports have shown that CD is increasing in frequency in different geographic areas. The increase in prevalence can be partially attributed to the improvement in diagnostic techniques and disease awareness; however the equally well documented rise in incidence in the last 30-40 years cannot be so easily explained. The new epidemiology of CD is now characterized by an increase of new cases in the historical CD areas (northern Europe and the United States) and more interestingly in a spread of the disease in new regions (Asian countries). A significant change in diet habits, particularly in gluten consumption as well as in infant feeding patterns are probably the main factors that can account for these new trends in CD epidemiology.},

SETTINGS: Department of Gynecology and Obstetrics and Faculty Hospital, Charles University, Pilsen. MATERIAL AND METHODS: Sera from 442 infertile patients aged 23-47 years and 86 healthy fertile controls aged 22-38 years were examined by commercial ELISA sets for the presence (absence) of antibodies against gliadin IgG, IgA and tissue transglutaminase in IgG and IgA. RESULTS: We found a statistically significant difference between the control group and patients with decreased fertility. They have a positive values in anti-tissue transglutaminase IgA (p = 0.0096). Frequent, very low positive reaction of antigliadin IgG was also found in the control group of women. CONCLUSION: Patients with unexplained repeated miscarriages and repeated unsuccessful IVF with IgA positive tissue transglutaminase have new complement of other tests for autoimmunity and examination of a total IgA, and gastroenterological examination. Eleven patients with significant positive anti-tissue transglutaminase IgA were successfully conceived only under strict gluten-free diet.},

Since celiac disease (CD) is often associated with T1D, a retrospective study was performed to analyze the sera of a cohort of pediatric subjects: i) patients with CD at onset (n=100); ii) patients with potential CD (n=45); iii) patients with CD associated with other auto-immune diseases (n=17); and iv) patients with eosinophilic esophagitis (n=15). Among the patients with CD, 49 were also analyzed after six months on a gluten-free diet, while data were also available for 13 patients after one year on a gluten-free diet. No significant differences were found in the circulating levels of TRAIL between the patients with CD and the patients with either eosinophilic esophagitis or potential CD. Patients with CD associated with other auto-immune diseases showed significantly lower levels of TRAIL when compared with patients with CD alone. The gluten-free diet did not significantly modify the levels of circulating TRAIL at 6 or 12 months. Thus, although T1D and CD share common immunological features, the circulating levels of TRAIL show a significant difference between the two pathologies, and do not appear to be modulated in CD.},

The present study aimed to record compliance rates and investigate the connection between dietary compliance and demographics, disease-related factors and parental knowledge. SUBJECTS/METHODS: Parents of 90 Greek children diagnosed with coeliac disease were recruited from the outpatient gastroenterology clinic of a children's hospital in Athens, Greece. Dietary compliance and a range of demographic and clinical data were obtained from parents through a specially constructed questionnaire. Further data included parental perceived and actual knowledge about coeliac disease and GFD. Compliant and noncompliant groups were compared for measured factors and a multivariate approach was followed to elicit independent effects of compliance determinants. RESULTS: Overall, 44.4% of children with coeliac disease were reported to be compliant to a strict GFD. A 1-year increase in the age of the child was associated with 15% lower odds of adhering to a strict diet after adjusting for other variables (odds ratio (OR)=0.85, 95% CI: 0.75-0.96). Parental perceived knowledge was also independently and significantly associated with dietary compliance (OR=3.3, 95% CI=1.1-9.8). No statistically significant correlation emerged between dietary compliance and other clinical or demographic variables. DISCUSSION: Low compliance rates to GFD were observed in children with coeliac disease. Information based on children's age and perceived parental knowledge can be used to develop risk profiles that health care professionals can utilise to identify children likely to be noncompliant and thus adjust their counselling strategy accordingly.},

   abstract = {BACKGROUND: Celiac disease (CD) is an autoimmune disorder of the small intestine which is triggered by dietary gluten in genetically predisposed (HLA-DQ2/DQ8 positive) individuals. Only a fraction of HLA-DQ2/DQ8 positive individuals develop CD indicating that other factors have a role in the disorder. Several studies have addressed intestinal microbiota aberrancies in pediatric CD, but the results are inconsistent. Previously, we demonstrated that pediatric CD patients have lower duodenal expression of TLR2 and higher expression of TLR9 as compared to healthy controls (HC) indicating that microbiota may have a role in CD. METHODS: We used bacterial phylogenetic microarray to comprehensively profile the microbiota in duodenal biopsies of CD (n = 10) and HC (n = 9) children. The expression of selected mucosa-associated genes was assessed by qRT-PCR in CD and HC children and in treated CD adults (T-CD, n = 6) on gluten free diet. RESULTS: The overall composition, diversity and the estimated microbe associated molecular pattern (MAMP) content of microbiota were comparable between CD and HC, but a sub-population profile comprising eight genus-like bacterial groups was found to differ significantly between HC and CD. In HC, increased TLR2 expression was positively correlated with the expression of tight junction protein ZO-1. In CD and T-CD, the expression of IL-10, IFN-g and CXCR6 were higher as compared to HC. CONCLUSIONS: The results suggest that microbiota and altered expression of mucosal receptors have a role in CD. In CD subjects, the increased expression of IL-10 and IFN-g may have partly resulted from the increased TLR9 expression and signaling.},

   abstract = {Celiac disease (CD) is an immune-mediated disease of considerable incidence, which negatively influences the quality of life of affected individuals and their families. The only currently available treatment is a lifelong gluten-free diet. Possible prevention strategies for CD focus on early infant feeding practices, namely breastfeeding and the time and mode of gluten introduction into the infant's diet. A systematic review of available data suggested that the risk of developing CD may be decreased by breastfeeding and breastfeeding at the time of gluten introduction. It is not clear whether this strategy prevents the disease or only delays the onset of symptoms. Gluten introduction should not be done earlier than at 4 months of age and not later than 7 months of age since both early and late introduction of gluten have been shown to increase the risk of CD. A large randomized controlled trial is being conducted in 10 European countries to clarify whether breastfeeding and early gluten introduction are effective in preventing CD in genetically susceptible individuals.},

   abstract = {Gliadin from wheat is a common food allergen that can induce baker's asthma, wheat-dependent exercise-induced anaphylaxis, atopic dermatitis, and celiac disease. This gliadin assay focuses on rapidly screen and check for gluten contamination in raw materials and in the gluten-free food production process, not only for wheat-sensitive patients but also for the industries producing gluten-free foodstuffs. The developed assay incorporates the use of anti-gliadin antibody-conjugated immunomagnetic beads (IMBs) to capture the gliadin in samples and fluorescent dyes-loaded immunoliposomal nanovesicles (IMLNs) to produce and enhance the detection signal. Hence, a sandwich complex is formed as "IMBs-gliadin-IMLNs". Experimental results indicate that this detection platform exhibits good sensitivity for gliadin with a detection limit as low as 0.6 mug mL(-1) of gliadin; as the polyclonal antibody showed slight cross-reactions with barley and rye. Excellent recovery rates were found ranging from 83.5 to 102.6% as testing the spiked samples. Moreover, the CV (%) of intra- and inter-assay of this developed assay are 4.8-10.6% and 3.5-9.9%, respectively. Based on a parallel analysis of twenty food samples, the results of this developed assay provide a good consistency with those of an AOAC-approved ELISA kit without any false-negative results. The proposed assay method is thus a highly promising alternative method for detecting the contamination of gliadin in the food industry.},

   abstract = {In this work, bioengineering methods that can be used to quantitatively analyze videocapsule endoscopy images that have been acquired from celiac patients versus controls are described. For videocapsule endoscopic analysis, each patient swallows a capsule which contains an imaging device and light source. In celiac and control patients, images are acquired and analyzed at the level of the small intestine. The data used for videocapsule analysis consisted of high resolution images of dimension 576 x 576 pixels, acquired twice per second. The goal of the quantitative analysis is to detect abnormality in celiac patient images as compared with controls. Several types of abnormality can exist at the level of the small intestine in celiac patients. In untreated patients, and often even after treatment with a gluten-free diet, there can be villous atrophy, as well as presence of fissures and a mottled appearance. To detect and discern these abnormalities, several methods of statistical and structural feature extraction and selection are described. It was found that there is a significantly greater variation in image texture and average brightness level in celiac patients as compared with controls (p < 0.05). Celiac patients have a longer dominant period as compared with controls, averaging 6.4 +/- 2.6 seconds versus 4.7 +/- 1.6 seconds in controls (p = 0.001). This suggests that overall motility is slower in the celiac patients. Furthermore, the mean number of villous protrusions per image was found to be 402.2 +/- 15.0 in celiac patients versus 420.8 +/- 24.0 in control patients (p < 0.001). The average protrusion width was 14.66 +/- 1.04 pixels in celiacs versus 13.91 +/- 1.47 pixels in controls (p = 0.01). The mean protrusion height was 3.10 +/- 0.26 grayscale levels for celiacs versus 2.70 +/- 0.43 grayscale levels for controls (p < 0.001). Thus celiac patients tended to have fewer protrusions, and these were more varied in shape, tending to be blunted, as compared with controls, which more often had fine, uniform protrusions. A variety of computerized methods are now available to quantitate videocapsule images for comparison of celiac versus control patients. Since these methods are based on computer algorithms, they can be automated and there is no variation in the results due to observer bias. These methods readily lend themselves to automation, so that it may be possible to map the entire small intestine for presence of abnormality in real-time. It is also possible to develop an automated, quantitative clinical score which can be displayed with real-time update during the procedure. This would be useful to determine progress in celiac patients on a gluten-free diet, and to better understand the properties of the healing process in these patients.},

   abstract = {We report on 2 patients affected by both celiac disease (CD) and beta-thalassemia major who underwent successful myeloablative allogeneic hematopoietic stem cell transplantation (HSCT) for the latter condition. After HSCT, the introduction of a gluten-containing diet did not cause the reappearance of clinical, serological, and histological markers of CD in up to 5 years of follow-up. After transplantation, in both patients, dendritic cells and regulatory FoxP3T cells showed a recovery of normal values and no proliferative T-cell response upon gliadin stimulation was found. These data suggest that allogeneic HSCT may lead to induction of gluten tolerance in patients with CD.},

   abstract = {BACKGROUND AIMS: Celiac disease is caused by a dysregulated immune response toward dietary gluten, whose only treatment is a lifelong gluten-free diet. We investigated the effects of mesenchymal stromal cells (MSCs) on gliadin-specific T cells, which are known to induce intestinal lesions, in view of a possible use as new therapy. METHODS: Bone marrow-derived MSCs and gliadin-specific T-cell lines were obtained from allogeneic donors and mucosal specimens of celiac patients, respectively. The immunosuppressant effect of MSCs was evaluated in terms of proliferative response and interferon (IFN)-gamma production upon gliadin stimulation of long-term T-cell lines; the immunomodulant effect was assessed in terms of apoptotic rate, immunophenotype and cytokine profile of short-term T-cell lines generated in the presence of MSCs. Different MSC:T-cell ratios were applied, and statistics were performed as appropriate. RESULTS: MSCs inhibited both proliferative response and IFN-gamma production of long-term T-cell lines in a dose-dependent manner while limiting the expansion of short-term T-cell lines by increasing the apoptotic rate. Moreover, a reduction of the CD4(+) population and expansion of the regulatory FoxP3+ subset were found in T-cell lines cultured with MSCs, in which a significant decrease of interleukin (IL)-21, IFN-gamma and IL-10 paralleled by an upregulation of transforming growth factor-beta1, IL-6 and IL-8 were observed. Finally, an increase of the indoleamine 2,3-dioxygenase activity was found, possibly playing a key role in mediating these effects. CONCLUSIONS: MSCs exert potent immunomodulant effects on gliadin-specific T cells, which may be exploited for future therapeutic application in celiac disease.},

   abstract = {Despite the growing understanding of its pathogenesis, the treatment of coeliac disease is still based on a lifelong gluten-free diet that, although efficacious, is troublesome for affected patients, and a definitive cure is still an unmet need. In this regard, the development of new chemical- and biological-derived agents has often resulted in unsatisfactory effects when tested in vivo, probably because of their ability to target only a single pathway, whilst the immunological cascade responsible for tissue injury is complex and redundant. The advent of cellular therapies, mainly based on the use of stem cells, is an emerging area of interest since it has the advantage of a multi-target strategy. Both haematopoietic and mesenchymal stem cells have been employed in the treatment of refractory patients suffering from autoimmune diseases, with promising results. However, the lack of immunogenicity makes mesenchymal stem cells more suitable than their haematopoietic counterpart, since their transplantation may be performed in the absence of a myeloablative conditioning regimen. In addition, mesenchymal stem cells have been shown to harbour strong modulatory effects on almost all cells involved in immune response, together with a potent regenerative action. It is therefore conceivable that over the next few years their therapeutic use will increase as their biological interactions with injured tissues become clearer.},

Hartnup disease is an autosomal recessive disorder caused by increased urinary excretion of neutral amino acids. Co-occurrence of Hartnup disease and CD is extremely rare with only a single case reported. CASE PRESENTATION: We report a 3-year girl with chronic diarrhea, Hypoalbuminemia and exfoliative erythema. She was diagnosed with celiac disease, which did not improve on gluten free diet. Hartnup disease was suspected and was confirmed by neutral aminoaciduria. Niacin was started and followed by dramatic improvement. CONCLUSION: Presence of Celiac and Hartnup disease in single individual is very rare. Complete nutritional assessment of refractory celiac patient can reveal underlying nutritional deficiency.},

   abstract = {OBJECTIVES: The aim of this study was to establish the prevalence of celiac disease (CD) in patients with erosive and reticular form of oral lichen planus (OLP) compared to healthy controls. MATERIALS AND METHODS: Tissue transglutaminase antibodies (anti-tTG) and antibodies against gliadin (AGA) were measured in the sera from 56 OLP patients and 57 healthy controls, who also underwent human leukocyte antigen (HLA) typing. The duodenal biopsy was performed in patients with positive serology, and a gluten-free diet was recommended if CD was confirmed. RESULTS: CD was diagnosed in eight OLP patients (14.29 %). Six OLP patients (10.71 %) were positive for immunoglobulin A (IgA) tTG. A statistically significant difference among the forms of oral lichen was observed for the IgA tTG (p = 0.03) and immunoglobulin G (IgG) tTG (p = 0.01). Higher frequencies of HLA-DQ2 and HLA-DQ8 were found in OLP patients compared to the control group. CONCLUSION: The prevalence of CD was higher in patients with OLP than in the control group. Therefore, increased efforts aimed at the early detection and dietary treatment of CD, among antibody-positive OLP patients, are advisable. CLINICAL RELEVANCE: Our study confirmed the increased frequency of CD among OLP patients. CD screening should be considered in OLP patients, since untreated CD can present many complications and reduce a patient's quality of life.},

Exposure to gluten is the starting point of an inflammatory cascade capable of forming autoantibodies that are brought to the skin, where they are deposited, culminating in the formation of skin lesions. These lesions are vesico-bullous, pruritic, and localized especially on elbows, knees and buttocks, although atypical presentations can occur. Immunofluorescence of perilesional area is considered the gold standard for diagnosis, but serological tests help in cases where it is negative. Patients who follow gluten-free diets have better control of symptoms on the skin and intestine, as well as lower risks of progression to lymphoma. Dapsone remains the main drug for treatment, but it requires monitoring of possible side effects, some potentially lethal.},

   abstract = {BACKGROUND AND AIMS: Increasingly, people start a gluten-free diet (GFD) without a clear celiac disease (CD) diagnosis. Human leukocyte antigen (HLA) genotyping is useful in ruling out CD in patients with equivocal results of serologic testing or small-bowel biopsy (SBB), but its utility and the clinical features of patients on self-treated GFD (ST-GFD) are largely unknown. METHODS: Retrospective study of single tertiary care center cohort compared 137 patients on ST-GFD and 443 patients with well-defined CD. We compared HLA genotype, symptoms, serologic and SBB results, and response to GFD between the 2 groups. Analysis used univariate logistic regression modeling, adjusted for age and sex. RESULTS: Patients with ST-GFD presented more often with diarrhea (P<0.001), abdominal distention (P<0.001), flatulence (P=0.002), cramping (P=0.02), itchy skin (P=0.02), oral inflammation (P=0.04), and constipation (P=0.01) and less often with anemia (P<0.001) or malaise (P=0.02) than CD patients. In addition, 41% did not carry DQ2.5 and DQ8 versus 6% of CD patients (P<0.001). Only 2% of ST-GFD patients had SBB clearly consistent with CD. Family history of CD showed no difference between groups (P=0.77). Although CD patients had a statistically higher rate of GFD benefit, both groups had a high responsiveness rate (98% vs. 94%; P=0.03). CONCLUSIONS: HLA genotyping is useful in evaluating patients on an ST-GFD. Although confirmed CD is rare in self-treated patients, most still report benefit from GFD regardless of DQ2 and DQ8 status. Nonceliac gluten sensitivity may play a role.},

Classic intestinal symptoms of CD may not be present in T1D leading to the recommendation for active case finding in this higher risk group. Screening is done with sensitive and specific serologies including tissue transglutaminase (tTG) IgA and deaminated gliadin peptide (DGP) IgA and IgG. Positive serologies are confirmed by the presence of villous atrophy and increased intraepithelial lymphocytes on duodenal biopsy. A strict gluten free diet is recommended, although this can pose challenges for T1D patients who already have dietary restrictions. In aggregate, it appears as if the gluten free diet may help T1D management. T1D and CD have overlapping genetic and environmental risk factors. Among these, non-HLA genetic factors and the gut microbiome are among recent developments that will be discussed in this review.},

   abstract = {A strict gluten-free diet (GFD) is the only currently available therapeutic treatment for patients with celiac disease, an autoimmune disorder of the small intestine associated with a permanent intolerance to gluten proteins. The complete elimination of gluten proteins contained in cereals from the diet is the key to celiac disease management. However, this generates numerous social and economic repercussions due to the ubiquity of gluten in foods. The research presented in this review focuses on the current status of alternative cereals and pseudocereals and their derivatives obtained by natural selection, breeding programs and transgenic or enzymatic technology, potential tolerated by celiac people. Finally, we describe several strategies for detoxification of dietary gluten. These included enzymatic cleavage of gliadin fragment by Prolyl endopeptidases (PEPs) from different organisms, degradation of toxic peptides by germinating cereal enzymes and transamidation of cereal flours. This information can be used to search for and develop cereals with the baking and nutritional qualities of toxic cereals, but which do not exacerbate this condition.},

   abstract = {BACKGROUND: Cereals used for beer manufacturing contain gluten, which is immunotoxic for celiac patients. The gluten remaining after processes of malting and brewing is mostly hydrolyzed, which makes practical evaluation of the immunotoxicity of the gluten pools challenging. RESULTS: We analyzed the presence of gluten peptides equivalent to the major immunotoxic protease-resistant gliadin 33-mer in 100 Belgium beers, using monoclonal antibodies (G12/A1). Immunochromatographic strips and enzyme-linked immonosorbent assay G12/A1 methods estimated at least 20 ppm gluten equivalents in 90 beers and gluten-free in 10 beers. The G12/A1 reactivity of beer high-performance liquid chromatographic fractions correlated to the presence of T-cell-reactive epitopes identified by peptide sequencing. CONCLUSION: The determination of equivalent gliadin 33-mer epitopes in beers has been shown to be practical, specific, and sensitive for the measurement of potential immunotoxicity for celiac patients.},

   abstract = {UNLABELLED: The coeliac disease is an immune-mediated enteropathy triggered by an ingestion of gluten in genetically susceptible individuals. Like some other systemic diseases (Crohn's disease, Sjogren's syndrome) the celiac disease is able to alter the oral ecosystem and the composition of the saliva. AIM: The aim of this retrospective study has been to examine the incidence of coeliac disease (CD) in paediatric population and to search the presence of anti-transglutaminase auto-antibodies (anti-tTG) in saliva, comparing and quantifying the concentration regard to the serum values of the anti-tTG auto-antibodies, before and after six months from the beginning of the free gluten diet. MATERIALS AND METHODS: 105 children (G0), aged between 5 and 13 years, belonging to the Paediatric Gastroenterology-Endoscopy Unit of PTV Hospital, University of Rome "Tor Vergata", have been examined for a diagnosis of suspected CD. RESULTS: Of a total of 105 pediatric patients (G0), only the 16.2% (G1) has showed to be positive. About the evaluation of the anti-tTG auto-antibodies in the serum, obtained from the second blood sample (T1), we can observe that 10 (G2) out of 17 children (G1) show positivity and for this reason they have been subjected to a sampling of intestinal villi to confirm the diagnosis of CD; in addition the 6.7% has been resulted positive at the first sampling of serum (T0), but negative to the second one (T1). The incidence of the CD has been resulted to be equal to 9.5%. About the evaluation of anti-tTG in the G1, we can observe that 58.8% of children are "definitely positive" to the salivary anti-tTG, while 11.8% appear to be weakly positive. About the correspondence of serum and salivary anti-tTG in Group G1, we can observe, that children positive to the anti-tTG in the serum have also the anti-tTG in the salivary fluid (sensibility 100%, specificity 71.4%). The results show that the anti-tTG salivary are present in children with CD, even though they have continued to follow the gluten free diet for 6 months. CONCLUSIONS: The presence of anti-tTG in the saliva may be considered, an additional and useful diagnostic dental marker for an initial, reproducible, non invasive, inexpensive and highly sensitive screening of CD having a predictive and precocious value compared to anti-tTG contained in the serum, as it has been already demonstrated.},

   abstract = {Coeliac disease is a gluten-sensitive enteropathy that develops in genetically susceptible individuals. The disease exhibits many features of an autoimmune disorder. These include the production of highly specific anti-endomysial autoantibodies directed against the enzyme tissue transglutaminase. It is well accepted that wheat-, barley- and rye-based foods should be excluded in the gluten-free diet. Although several studies report that oats ingestion is safe in this diet, the potential toxicity of oats remains controversial. In the current study, 46 coeliac patients ingested oats for 1 year and were investigated for a potential immunogenic or toxic effect. Stringent clinical monitoring of these patients was performed and none experienced adverse effects, despite ingestion of a mean of 286 g of oats each week. Routine histological analysis of intestinal biopsies showed improvement or no change in 95% of the samples examined. Furthermore, tissue transglutaminase expression in biopsy samples, determined quantitatively using the IN Cell Analyzer, was unchanged. Employing immunohistochemistry, oats ingestion was not associated with changes in intraepithelial lymphocyte numbers or with enterocyte proliferation as assessed by Ki-67 staining. Finally, despite the potential for tissue transglutaminase to interact with oats, neither endomysial nor tissue transglutaminase antibodies were generated in any of the patients throughout the study. To conclude, this study reaffirms the lack of oats immunogenicity and toxicity to coeliac patients. It also suggests that the antigenic stimulus caused by wheat exposure differs fundamentally from that caused by oats.},

Celiac disease is associated with an increased risk of autoimmune diseases (type 1 diabetes, thyroiditis), and cancer (upper digestive tract, hepatocellular carcinoma, lymphoma). The main digestive complications are microscopic colitis and refractory sprue, which are resistant to gluten-free diet. It can be associated with a monoclonal proliferation of intraepithelial lymphocytes (type 2 refractory sprue), which may be considered as a cryptic lymphoma and can lead to invasive T lymphoma, which occurs in one celiac patient in 1000. Gluten-free diet protects from the occurrence of most complications and correct the over-mortality related to these complications.},

   abstract = {We recently completed clinical trials in people with diet-treated celiac disease who were purposefully infected with the ubiquitous human hookworm, Necator americanus. Hookworm infection elicited not only parasite-specific immunity but also modified the host's immune response to gluten. After infection, mucosal IL-1beta and IL-22 responses were enhanced, but IFNgamma and IL-17A levels and circulating regulatory T cells following gluten challenge were suppressed, and the adaptive response to gluten acquired a helper T cell type-2 profile. In this review, we briefly, (i) highlight the utility celiac disease offers autoimmune research, (ii) discuss safety and personal experience with N. americanus, (iii) summarise the direct and bystander impact that hookworm infection has on mucosal immunity to the parasite and gluten, respectively, and (iv) speculate why this hookworm's success depends on healing its host and how this might impact on a propensity to autoimmunity.},

   abstract = {BACKGROUND: Celiac disease (CeD) is a common gluten-sensitive autoimmune enteropathy. A gluten-free diet is an effective treatment, but compliance is demanding; hence, new treatment strategies for CeD are required. OBJECTIVE: Parasitic helminths hold promise for treating inflammatory disorders, so we examined the influence of experimental hookworm infection on the predicted outcomes of escalating gluten challenges in CeD subjects. METHODS: A 52-week study was conducted involving 12 adults with diet-managed CeD. Subjects were inoculated with 20 Necator americanus larvae, and escalating gluten challenges consumed as pasta were subsequently administered: (1) 10 to 50 mg for 12 weeks (microchallenge); (2) 25 mg daily + 1 g twice weekly for 12 weeks (GC-1g); and (3) 3 g daily (60-75 straws of spaghetti) for 2 weeks (GC-3g). Symptomatic, serologic, and histological outcomes evaluated gluten toxicity. Regulatory and inflammatory T cell populations in blood and mucosa were examined. RESULTS: Two gluten-intolerant subjects were withdrawn after microchallenge. Ten completed GC-1g, 8 of whom enrolled in and completed GC-3g. PRIMARY OUTCOMES: median villous height-to-crypt depth ratios (2.60-2.63; P = .98) did not decrease as predicted after GC-1g, and the mean IgA-tissue transglutaminase titers declined, contrary to the predicted rise after GC-3g. SECONDARY OUTCOMES: quality of life scores improved (46.3-40.6; P = .05); celiac symptom indices (24.3-24.3; P = .53), intra-epithelial lymphocyte percentages (32.5-35.0; P = .47), and Marsh scores were unchanged by gluten challenge. Intestinal T cells expressing IFNgamma were reduced following hookworm infection (23.9%-11.5%; P = .04), with corresponding increases in CD4(+) Foxp3(+) regulatory T cells (0.19%-1.12%; P = .001). CONCLUSIONS: Necator americanus and gluten microchallenge promoted tolerance and stabilized or improved all tested indices of gluten toxicity in CeD subjects.},

In the last few years, however, several study results have been published that have proved that gluten intolerance can also affect people who do not suffer from any of the above mentioned diseases. The new syndrome has been named non-celiac gluten sensitivity (NCGS) or gluten sensitivity (GS). It has been included in the new list of gluten-related disorders published in 2012. Researchers believe that NCGS is the most common syndrome of gluten intolerance. This review discusses many aspects of NCGS epidemiology, pathophysiology, clinical spectrum, and treatment and current tools to identify patients suffering from CD, WA, and NCGS.},

   abstract = {OBJECTIVES: To investigate three pairs of twins with celiac disease (CD) concerning clinical presentation, diagnostic procedures, and long-follow-up, besides screening CD in their first-degree relatives. PATIENTS/METHODS: CD was diagnosed in childhood by endoscopic duodenal biopsy in two monozygotic (MZ) female pairs (A1 and A2, B1 and B2) and one dizygotic (DZ) pair, in which the male (C1) had CD and the female (C2) was negative. The patients had periodic evaluations after a gluten-free diet (GFD) for 16 to 21 years. Nine first-degree relatives were screened by serological tests and when positive, referred for intestinal biopsies. RESULTS: At diagnosis, all CD patients had the classic presentation. A1/A2: scalloped duodenal mucosa with atrophic areas, Marsh III-b, after 16 years of GFD was antiendomysium antibody (EmA) negative, normal mucosa. B1/B2 at diagnosis: mucosal atrophy, Marsh III-b, after 21 years was EmA negative, decreased folds. Patient C1: decreased folds, Marsh III-b, after 16 years was EmA positive, decreased folds, admitted to gluten ingestion. A1, A2, and B1 presented dermatitis herpetiformis. The father of A1/A2 and the mother of C1/C2 were celiac. CONCLUSIONS: The long-term follow-up of the patients allowed some observations such as the concordance for CD in MZ twins, both in relation to the time of onset and the severity of the disease. Also, the findings of serological, endoscopic, and histological analyses were similar. Dermatitis herpetiformis was present in patients with CD, with partial concordance in MZ twins.},

   abstract = {The aim of this study was to dissect the autoantibody response in celiac disease (CD) that remains largely unknown, with the goal of identifying the disease-specific autoantigenic protein pattern or the so called epitome. Sera from CD patients were used to select immunoreactive antigens from a cDNA phage-display library. Candidate genes were identified, the corresponding proteins produced and their immunoreactivity validated with sera from CD patients and controls. Thirteen CD-specific antigens were identified and further validated by protein microarray. The specificity for 6 of these antigens was confirmed by ELISA. Furthermore we showed that this antibody response was not abolished on a gluten free diet and was not shared with other autoimmune diseases. These antigens appear to be CD specific and independent of gluten induction. The utility of this panel extends beyond its diagnostic value and it may drive the attention to new targets for unbiased screens in autoimmunity research.},

   abstract = {Tropical sprue (TS) is a chronic diarrheal disease of unknown etiology characterized by malabsorption and small bowel mucosal abnormalities. TS affects residents of, and visitors to, endemic tropical regions. Rarely the disease may remain latent for several years, and to date, few cases of latent TS have been reported in Europe or North America. However, in our increasingly multicultural communities and in a 'global village' where travel is common, clinicians must maintain a high index of suspicion for TS in patients presenting with diarrhea and malabsorption who have traveled to endemic regions. TS may mimic common diarrheal diseases that are seen in developed nations, including celiac disease, Crohn's disease, bacterial overgrowth, and other infectious etiologies. Accordingly, once these more common etiologies have been ruled out, TS must be considered in patients presenting with diarrhea after travel to endemic regions. We present a unique Canadian case of latent TS, with a brief review of the diagnostic approach and treatment.},

   abstract = {Celiac disease is a gluten or prolamine-induced immunological disorder primarily affecting the intestines. Celiac disease is often missed since not only are clinical findings 'not typical' but also because many cases are asymptomatic. The diagnosis is based on a constellation of clinical, serological and histological findings in a duodenal biopsy, in addition to HLA genotype.and response to a gluten-free diet.Although some guidelines suggest that histology may not mandatory in every case, by and large changes in mucosal biopsies of the duodenum still remain an important diagnostic tool. The evaluation of a duodenal biopsy requires a properly oriented and satisfactory hematoxylin & eosin stained paraffin section. A poorly oriented and technically suboptimal biopsy is not uncommonly the reason for erroneous interpretation. An increase in intraepithelial lymphocytes [IELs] and an alteration of the crypt: villus ratio forms the basis of diagnosis. These are semiquantitavely classified. Despite varying opinions related to the cut-off values of IELs and findings that recommend appropriate site, number and size of the biopsy specimens, the sensitivity of biopsies vary from 90%-100%. Interpretation of histological findings require correlation with other evidences since the changes in duodenal biopsy may be similar to those seen in a host of other diseases including tropical sprue. It must also be mentioned that in the Indian subcontinent is that reference values for normal duodenal biopsies are lacking, making interpretation difficult especially when changes are mild. Histological changes in the duodenal mucosa often take months to normalize after clinical remission. This is a review of various aspects related to the histological changes in duodenal mucosal biopsies that aid in the diagnosis and follow-up of cases of celiac disease.},

   abstract = {BACKGROUND: Maize, one of the suitable grains for coeliac consumption, is, together with rice, the most cultivated cereal in the world. However, the inclusion of maize flour in gluten-free bread is a minority and studies are scarce. This paper analyses the influence of different maize flour types and their particle sizes on the quality of two types of bread without gluten (80% and 110% water in the formulation) obtained from them. We also analysed the microstructure of the dough and its behaviour during the fermentation. RESULTS: Finer flours had a lower dough development during fermentation in all cases. Among the different types of flour, those whose microstructure revealed compact particles were those which had higher specific bread volume, especially when the particle size was greater. Among the formulations, the dough with more water gave breads with higher specific volume, an effect that was more important in more compact flours. The higher volume breads had lower values of hardness and resilience. CONCLUSION: The type of corn flour and mainly its particle size influence significantly the dough development of gluten-free bread during fermentation and therefore the final volume and texture of the breads obtained. The flours having coarser particle size are the most suitable for making gluten-free maize bread.},

   abstract = {PURPOSE: Immune system of some autistic patients could be abnormally triggered by gluten/casein assumption. The prevalence of antibodies to gliadin and milk proteins in autistic children with paired/impaired intestinal permeability and under dietary regimen either regular or restricted is reported. METHODS: 162 ASDs and 44 healthy children were investigated for intestinal permeability, tissue-transglutaminase (tTG), anti-endomysium antibodies (EMA)-IgA, and total mucosal IgA to exclude celiac disease; HLA-DQ2/-DQ8 haplotypes; total systemic antibodies (IgA, IgG, and IgE); specific systemic antibodies: alpha-gliadin (AGA-IgA and IgG), deamidated-gliadin-peptide (DGP-IgA and IgG), total specific gliadin IgG (all fractions: alpha, beta, gamma, and omega), beta-lactoglobulin IgG, alpha-lactalbumin IgG, casein IgG; and milk IgE, casein IgE, gluten IgE,-lactoglobulin IgE, and alpha-lactalbumin IgE. RESULTS: AGA-IgG and DPG-IgG titers resulted to be higher in ASDs compared to controls and are only partially influenced by diet regimen. Casein IgG titers resulted to be more frequently and significantly higher in ASDs than in controls. Intestinal permeability was increased in 25.6% of ASDs compared to 2.3% of healthy children. Systemic antibodies production was not influenced by paired/impaired intestinal permeability. CONCLUSIONS: Immune system of a subgroup of ASDs is triggered by gluten and casein; this could be related either to AGA, DPG, and Casein IgG elevated production or to impaired intestinal barrier function.},

   abstract = {BACKGROUND: Accelerated progression of atherosclerosis and increased cardiovascular risk have been described in immune-mediated disorders, but few data are available in coeliac disease. AIM: To evaluate instrumental and biochemical signs of atherosclerosis risk in 20 adults at first diagnosis of coeliac disease and after 6-8 months of gluten-free diet with mucosal recovery. METHODS: We analysed total, high-density lipoprotein (HDL) and low-density lipoprotein (LDL) cholesterol, triglycerides, homocysteine, C-reactive protein, folate and vitamin B12; ultrasound measurement of carotid intima-media thickness (IMT) and endothelium-dependent dilatation were both carried on at diagnosis and after gluten withdrawal. Twenty-two healthy members of the hospital staff served as matched controls for vascular examinations. RESULTS: At baseline, mean total and HDL-cholesterol (HDL-C) were both within normal range, while mean LDL-cholesterol concentration was slightly increased; diet was associated with an increment in total and HDL-C (68.2 +/- 17.4 vs. 51.4 +/- 18.6 mg/dL; P < 0.001) and a significant improvement in total/HDL-C ratio (3.05 +/- 0.71 vs. 3.77 +/- 0.92; P < 0.02). Mean plasma homocysteine was elevated and not influenced by diet. C-reactive protein significantly decreased with diet (1.073 +/- 0.51 vs. 1.92 +/- 1.38 mg/dL; P < 0.05). At baseline, in coeliacs, IMT was increased (0.082 +/- 0.011 vs. 0.058 +/- 0.012 cm; P < 0.005), while endothelium-dependent dilatation was decreased (9.3 +/- 1.3 vs. 11.2 +/- 1.2%; P < 0.05). Both parameters improved after gluten abstinence. CONCLUSIONS: Adults with coeliac disease seem to be at potentially increased risk of early atherosclerosis as suggested by vascular impairment and unfavourable biochemical risk pattern. Chronic inflammation might play a determining role. Gluten abstinence with mucosal normalisation reverts to normal the observed alterations.},

   abstract = {The link between the gluten component of wheat and celiac disease (CD) was discovered in 1952 by a team of physicians from Birmingham, England. Villous atrophy was described by John W. Paulley in 1954. During the 1960s, other features of CD were elucidated; its hereditary nature was recognized in 1965, and in 1966, dermatitis herpetiformis was linked to gluten sensitivity. Following the discovery of a link between gluten and CD, it was demonstrated that gliadin, one of the two principal protein groups comprising gluten, plays a critical role in CD. It has since become clear that the different and crucial roles of gliadin in CD result from its ability to activate multiple signaling pathways that modulate CD pathology. Most of these pathways involve the host innate and adaptive immune responses, but some pathways are activated when gliadin interacts with the intestinal cellular compartment. This review covers the current knowledge of the role of gliadin peptides in CD disorders that are characterized by intraepithelial T-cells infiltration (IEL), production of autoantibodies, endosomal trafficking, alteration of intestinal barrier function and intestinal cell proliferation. In addition, it examines the ability of these characteristics to determine the main clinicopathological features of gluten sensitivity for the purpose of identifying new strategies, other than maintaining a gluten-free diet, to improve the management of CD patients in the future.},

To date, the only therapy for CD is the complete exclusion of dietary sources of grains and any food containing gluten. It has been hypothesized that the intestinal microbiota is somehow involved in CD. For this reason, probiotics are appearing as an interesting adjuvant in the dietetic management of CD. This review aims to discuss the characteristics of the microbiota in CD subjects and the use of probiotics as a novel therapy for CD. Comparisons between children with CD and controls show that their microbiota profiles differ; the former have fewer lactobacilli and bifidobacteria. Specific probiotics have been found to digest or alter gluten polypeptides. It has also been demonstrated that some bacterial species belonging to the genera Lactobacillus and Bifidobacterium exert protective properties on epithelial cells from damage caused by gliadin.},

Vitamin D deficiency due to malabsorption syndromes may cause osteomalacia. This is a case of a patient with a 6-year history of seronegative spondyloarthropathy associated with Crohn's disease who was admitted to our outpatient clinic with symptoms of osteomalacia. INTRODUCTION: Osteomalacia is a metabolic bone disease characterized by an impaired mineralization of the bone matrix, frequently caused by disorders in vitamin D or phosphate metabolism. Vitamin D deficiency due to malabsorption syndromes (e.g., Crohn's disease, ulcerative colitis, celiac disease, and jejuno-ileal bypass for obesity) may cause osteomalacia. CASE REPORT: A 43-year-old male presented with fatigue, low back pain, and morning stiffness. He had a 6-year history of seronegative spondyloarthropathy associated with Crohn's disease. Laboratory findings revealed low serum calcium, low 25-hydroxy vitamin D3, normal phosphorus, elevated parathyroid hormone, and alkaline phosphatase levels. Radiographs revealed grade IV sacroiliitis and Looser zones. He was diagnosed with osteomalacia due to the malabsorption of vitamin D. His symptoms and signs were relieved with supplements of vitamin D and calcium. CONCLUSIONS: Osteomalacia should be considered in differential diagnosis when assessing low back pain in the patients with chronic inflammatory bowel disease. Vitamin D deficiency should be treated with vitamin D supplementation in patients with Crohn's disease to prevent osteomalacia.},

   abstract = {BACKGROUND/AIMS: Prolactin (PRL) is produced by the anterior pituitary gland. It exerts its role on the breast gland but also plays a modulatory role in autoimmune mechanisms. Celiac disease (CD) is a gluten-sensitive autoimmune enteropathy sometimes associated with autoimmune endocrinopathies. No data on PRL levels in CD patients are available at diagnosis, and no conclusive data are reported. METHODS: We aimed to evaluate PRL secretion in newly diagnosed CD pediatric patients and, in the case of hyperprolactinemia, any changes in its levels while the patients were on a gluten-free diet (GFD). We recruited 67 patients and 39 healthy controls. RESULTS: PRL was statistically higher in the CD patients (13.5+/-9.2 ng/ml) than in the controls (8.5+/-5.0 ng/ml). In the CD group, PRL was inversely correlated with the age at diagnosis (r=-0.326; p=0.007). In patients with hyperprolactinemia at diagnosis, PRL decreased after 6 months of GFD. CONCLUSION: This paper confirms that PRL may be increased at diagnosis of CD and shows, for the first time, that it decreases after a short course of GFD. Changes in the levels of inflammatory cytokines in CD may account for changes in PRL levels. Younger patients seem more prone to develop hyperprolactinemia than older ones.},

   abstract = {BACKGROUND: Celiac disease (CD) is an autoimmune disorder that occurs in genetically predisposed people and is caused by a reaction to the gluten protein found in wheat, which leads to intestinal villous atrophy. Currently there is no drug for treatment of CD. The only known treatment is lifelong gluten-free diet. The main aim of this work is to develop a mathematical model of the immune response in CD patients and to predict the efficacy of a transglutaminase-2 (TG-2) inhibitor as a potential drug for treatment of CD. RESULTS: A thorough analysis of the developed model provided the following results:1. TG-2 inhibitor treatment leads to insignificant decrease in antibody levels, and hence remains higher than in healthy individuals.2. TG-2 inhibitor treatment does not lead to any significant increase in villous area.3. The model predicts that the most effective treatment of CD would be the use of gluten peptide analogs that antagonize the binding of immunogenic gluten peptides to APC. The model predicts that the treatment of CD by such gluten peptide analogs can lead to a decrease in antibody levels to those of normal healthy people, and to a significant increase in villous area. CONCLUSIONS: The developed mathematical model of immune response in CD allows prediction of the efficacy of TG-2 inhibitors and other possible drugs for the treatment of CD: their influence on the intestinal villous area and on the antibody levels. The model also allows to understand what processes in the immune response have the strongest influence on the efficacy of different drugs. This model could be applied in the pharmaceutical R&D arena for the design of drugs against autoimmune small intestine disorders and on the design of their corresponding clinical trials.},

   abstract = {Celiac disease is an immune-mediated disease triggered in genetically susceptible individuals by ingested gluten from wheat, rye, barley, and other closely related cereal grains. The current treatment for celiac disease is life-long adherence to a strict gluten-exclusion diet. The replacement of gluten presents a significant technological challenge, as it is an essential structure-building protein, which is necessary for formulating high-quality baked goods. A major limitation in the production of gluten-free products is the lack of protein functionality in non-wheat cereals. Additionally, commercial gluten-free mixes usually contain only carbohydrates, which may significantly limit the amount of protein in the diet. In the recent past, various approaches are attempted to incorporate protein-based ingredients and to modify the functional properties for gluten-free product development. This review aims to the highlight functionality of the alternative protein-based ingredients, which can be utilized for gluten-free product development both functionally as well as nutritionally.},

   abstract = {AIM: The moments that follow the diagnosis of celiac disease and the early stages of the gluten-free diet are extremely difficult and complex for parents and child, because they face an important change punctuated by self-denial and deprivation. The main objective of this research is to assess the impact of celiac disease on quality of life in subjects in developmental age, taking into account the perceptions of parents about the child's illness, with the aim to highlight the effect of disease on the child and the entire family. METHODS: The study included both parents of 45 children aged between 2 and 10 years, with established celiac disease. To evaluate the effect of celiac disease on the lifestyle of affected children and their families has been used, after having adapted to the Italian context, the Impact Scale of Childhood Diseases of Hoare and Russell (1995). This study shows that celiac disease is a condition that has a significant impact on both the child and his family. RESULTS AND CONCLUSION: The results obtained by administration of Impact Scale of Childhood Diseases to parents showed that subjects in developmental age with celiac disease could have difficulty on emotional level that affect child development and the whole family context. Acceptance of the illness by the child depends mainly by how much and how this has been accepted by parents.},

   abstract = {OBJECTIVES: Several immune-mediated gastrointestinal disorders, including celiac disease (CD), are associated with neuroendocrine cell hyperplasia. However, neuroendocrine cells have never been explored in refractory CD (RCD). METHODS: Serial duodenal sections from 17 patients with RCD (6 type 1 and 11 type 2), 16 uncomplicated CD patients before and after gluten-free diet, 14 patients with potential CD, 27 patients with non-CD villous atrophy, i.e., common variable immunodeficiency (n=12), Whipple's disease (n=10) and giardiasis (n=5), and 16 healthy subjects were processed for the immunohistochemical detection of chromogranin A (CgA), serotonin, and somatostatin. Mucosal tryptophan hydroxylase (TpH)-1 and serotonin-selective reuptake transporter (SERT) transcripts were measured by quantitative reverse transcription-PCR. Serum CgA and 24-h urine 5-hydroxyindoleacetic acid (5-HIAA) were assessed. Biopsies from treated CD patients were cultured with serotonin or peptic tryptic digest of gliadin (PT-gliadin), and interferon (IFN)-gamma was detected by ELISA in culture supernatants. RESULTS: Epithelial cells positive for CgA and serotonin, but not somatostatin, were significantly increased in RCD. Raised mucosal transcripts of TpH-1, but not SERT, were found in RCD. On biopsies from treated CD patients, serotonin upregulated IFN-gamma production at levels comparable to those induced by PT-gliadin. Serum CgA, but not urine 5-HIAA, was increased in RCD. No significant difference was found between RCD type 1 and type 2 in terms of neuroendocrine cells, mucosal TpH-1 transcripts, and serum CgA. CONCLUSIONS: Serotonin-producing neuroendocrine cells are increased in RCD mucosa. IFN-gamma upregulation induced by serotonin suggests that this monoamine may have a role in sustaining the local inflammatory response in CD.},

A slight increase of fracture risk is evident in this condition, particularly in those with overt malabsorption and in postmenopausal state. The adoption of a correct gluten-free diet (GFD) improves bone derangement, but is not able to normalize bone mass in all the patients. Biomarkers effective in the prediction of bone response to gluten-free diet are not yet available and the indications of guidelines are still imperfect and debated. In this review, the pathophysiology of bone loss is correlated to clinical aspects, defining an alternative proposal of management for this condition.},

   abstract = {UNLABELLED: Celiac disease (CD) is an immune-mediated enteropathy triggered by the ingestion of gluten in genetically susceptible individuals and neurologic manifestations may be one of the presentations form. The aim of this study was to report the incidence of neurologic manifestations in children with CD. MATERIAL AND METHODS: Between 2000-2010, 48 children aged 2-18 years diagnosed with CD have been monitored. The diagnosis of CD was made by serological tests and intestinal biopsy. The study protocol included: measurement of weight and height, biological and immunological tests, histological examination, questionnaires filled out by parents about their child motor development and some neurologic signs, psychological exam, electroencephalogram, and brain CT-scan. RESULTS: 16 of the 48 children presented one or more neurologic symptoms as the onset manifestation of CD. The neurologic signs in order of frequency were: headache/migraine, attention-deficit/hyperactivity disorder, epileptic seizures, mental retardation, cerebellar ataxia and behavior disorders. Brain CT-scan showed cerebral calcifications in 3 patients with epilepsy, and atrophy in 2 cases with cerebellar ataxia. All children received gluten free diet, but a favorable course was noticed only in the children with migraine and epilepsy, in the other patients this diet having no influence on neurologic symptoms. CONCLUSIONS: This study proved the variety of neurologic symptoms that can be included in the clinical signs of celiac disease in pediatric patients. That is why in the presence of different neurologic symptoms of unknown etiology and resistant to treatment, celiac disease must be taken into account and laboratory investigations have to include intestinal biopsy and immunological test.},

The prevalence of atypical presentations of celiac disease has increased over the past 2 decades. Several studies in adults and children with celiac disease indicate that obesity/overweight at disease onset is not unusual. In addition, there is a trend towards the development of overweight/obesity in celiac patients who strictly comply with a gluten-free diet. However, the pathogenesis and clinical implications of the coexistence of classic malabsorption (e.g., celiac disease) and overweight/obesity remain unclear. This review investigated the causes and main clinical factors associated with overweight/obesity at the diagnosis of celiac disease and clarified whether gluten withdrawal affects the current trends of the nutritional status of celiac disease patients.},

   abstract = {OBJECTIVE: To explore the diagnosis and treatment of gluten-related disorders (GRD). METHODS: Anti-gliadin antibodies(AGA), anti-tissue transglutaminase (tTG) antibody, deamidated gliadin peptides (DGP) antibody and serum specific IgG antibodies of 14 kinds of intolerable food were tested in people who developed chronic diarrhea after the intake of gluten diet. HLA-DQ2, HLA-DQ8 and intestinal endoscopic multiple biopsies would be performed further in patients with positive coeliac disease (CD)-specific serology. Gluten free diet was given to patients with positive CD-specific serology.One patient received prednisone (30 mg/d and diminished 5 mg/w). RESULTS: Nine patients were confirmed with celiac disease (CD) and four cases were suspected non-coeliac gluten sensitivity (NCGS) in 13 patients with positive serologic tests. Twelve cases received effective therapy. In CD group, 6 cases were accompanied with comorbidities mainly autoimmune diseases and osteoporosis. The positive rates of AGA and tTG antibody were 9/9 and 2/9 respectively in the CD group, while tTG antibody in the NCGS group were both negative.Endoscopic intestinal biopsy was performed in all 13 cases. Plasma cell proliferation and lymphocyte infiltration in the lamina propria without villus atrophy were identified in 4 cases, representing chronic inflammation of the small intestine. Villus atrophy was detected in 9 cases. Two patients with NCGS ingested gluten after 4 and 6 months of gluten-free diet respectively, and the number of bowel movements increased 1-2 times per day. CONCLUSIONS: The diagnosis of CD is mainly based on serologic tests and characteristic of histological features. CD may be companied by other autoimmune diseases or metabolic disease of bone. Lifelong adherence to a gluten free diet is the most basic and effective therapy.},

   abstract = {OBJECTIVES: Clinical inference suggests the prevalence of non-celiac gluten sensitivity is substantially higher than that of celiac disease in the USA. Unfortunately, there are currently no data supporting these claims. The authors analyzed nationally representative data to estimate the prevalence of adherence to a gluten-free diet among participants without celiac disease and also to characterize the demographics and general health status of these participants. STUDY DESIGN AND SETTING: The Continuous National Health and Nutrition Examination Survey (NHANES) 2009-2010 enrolled 7762 individuals representing the civilian, non-institutionalized, US population free of celiac disease. Participants responded to interviewer administered questionnaires regarding current adherence to a gluten-free diet. Prevalence estimates were computed using SAS survey procedures. RESULTS: There were 49 individuals who reported current adherence to a gluten-free diet reflecting a weighted prevalence of 0.548% (95% CI 0.206-0.889). The prevalence of a gluten-free diet was higher in females (0.58%) than males (0.37%), although this was not statistically significant (p = 0.34). Participants reporting a gluten-free diet were older (46.6 vs. 40.5 years, p = 0.005), had higher high-density lipoprotein, lower iron and lower body mass index. CONCLUSIONS: The estimated national prevalence of non-celiac gluten sensitivity is 0.548%, approximately half that of celiac disease. Future studies are merited in order to better understand the population burden of non-celiac gluten sensitivity.},

   abstract = {OBJECTIVE: To assess the prevalence of headache in clinic and support group patients with celiac disease and inflammatory bowel disease (IBD) compared with a sample of healthy controls. BACKGROUND: European studies have demonstrated increased prevalence of headache of patients with celiac disease compared with controls. METHODS: Subjects took a self-administered survey containing clinical, demographic, and dietary data, as well as questions about headache type and frequency. The ID-Migraine screening tool and the Headache Impact Test (HIT-6) were also used. RESULTS: Five hundred and two subjects who met exclusion criteria were analyzed - 188 with celiac disease, 111 with IBD, 25 with gluten sensitivity (GS), and 178 controls (C). Chronic headaches were reported by 30% of celiac disease, 56% of GS, 23% of IBD, and 14% of control subjects (P<.0001). On multivariate logistic regression, celiac disease (odds ratio [OR] 3.79, 95% confidence interval [CI] 1.78-8.10), GS (OR 9.53, 95%CI 3.24-28.09), and IBD (OR 2.66, 95%CI 1.08-6.54) subjects all had significantly higher prevalence of migraine headaches compared with controls. Female sex (P=.01), depression, and anxiety (P=.0059) were independent predictors of migraine headaches, whereas age >65 was protective (P=.0345). Seventy-two percent of celiac disease subjects graded their migraine as severe in impact, compared with 30% of IBD, 60% of GS, and 50% of C subjects (P=.0919). There was no correlation between years on gluten-free diet and migraine severity. CONCLUSIONS: Migraine was more prevalent in celiac disease and IBD subjects than in controls. Future studies should include screening migraine patients for celiac disease and assessing the effects of gluten-free diet on migraines in celiac disease.},

   abstract = {Celiac disease is a complex disorder characterized by digestive symptoms as well as extraintestinal manifestations, sometimes difficult to diagnose. Commonly described as a disease of childhood, adult celiac disease is a well known entity that should be taken into the differential diagnosis of a chronic diarrhea or of a malabsorption syndrome. The pathogenesis encompasses an autoimmune pathway that acts on a genetic background. The mucosa of the small intestine became damaged in reponse to foods that contain gluten in subjects with genetic susceptibility. The clinical presentation is variable, ranging from typical gastrointestinal symptoms to extradigestive and systemic manifestations. The simple withdrawal of the dietary gluten results in clinical improvement and healing of the intestinal mucosa. We report the case of an young women diagnosed with celiac disease after 7 years of iron deficiency anemia without a clear etiology.},

A survey was used to collect information. Descriptive analysis, chi(2) tests and Multiple Logistic Regressions were conducted. Ninety-one questionnaires were analyzed. Limited variety and availability, the high price of products and the social restrictions imposed by the diet were the factors that caused the most dissatisfaction and difficulty. A total of 71% of the participants confirmed having moderate to high difficulty finding GF products. The logistic regression identified a significant relationship between dissatisfaction, texture and variety (p < 0.05) and between variety and difficulty of finding GF products (p < 0.05). The sensory characteristics were the most important variables considered for actual purchases. Bread was the most desired product. The participants were dissatisfaction with GF products. The desire for bread with better sensory characteristics reinforces the challenge to develop higher quality baking products.},

We retrospectively reviewed the charts of 6 children (5 boys, 1 girl; mean age 8 years) with increased intracranial pressure and low serum vitamin A levels (mean 16.0 +/- 8.8 microg/dL). The etiology of the vitamin A deficiency was a restricted diet (2 children), intestinal malabsorption caused by celiac disease (2 children), and undetermined cause (2 children). Only 1 child had ocular signs of xerosis. Poor visual acuity at presentation and lower serum vitamin A levels were associated with a poor visual outcome and development of optic atrophy. In conclusion, pseudotumor cerebri in children can be associated with vitamin A deficiency even when other manifestations of xerophthalmia do not exist. Early recognition of this condition and appropriate therapy can prevent blindness.},

   abstract = {BACKGROUND: Currently , the only treatment for coeliac disease is life long adherence to a strict gluten-free diet. Strict adherence to a gluten-free diet is challenging, with recent reports suggesting that adherence rates range from 42% to 91%. The present study aimed to: (i) identify motives for adhering to a gluten-free diet and (ii) explore factors implicated in adherence and non-adherence behaviour in terms of accidental and purposeful gluten consumption among adults with coeliac disease. METHODS: Two hundred and three adults with coeliac disease completed an online questionnaire. Using a qualitative design, relationships were examined between reported adherence and motivation to follow a gluten-free diet, as well as the onset, duration and severity of symptoms. RESULTS: Feelings of desperation ('hitting rock bottom') and needing to gain or lose weight were associated with the strictest adherence to a gluten-free diet. Participants who accidentally consumed gluten over the past week developed symptoms the most quickly and reported the most pain over the past 6 months. Participants who consumed gluten on purpose over the past week reported a shorter duration of symptoms and less pain over the past 6 months. CONCLUSIONS: Hitting rock bottom and needing to gain or lose weight were factors associated with the strictest adherence, when considered in the context of both accidental and purposeful gluten consumption. Future research is warranted to develop resources to help people with coeliac disease follow a strict gluten-free diet.},

   abstract = {A 64-year-old male with a history of hypertension presented with worsening diarrhea and 25-pound weight loss over the preceding three months. Prior screening colonoscopy was unremarkable, and the patient failed conservative management. On presentation, the patient had orthostatic hypotension associated with prerenal azotemia for which olmesartan (40 mg/day) was held. Initial workup for chronic diarrhea was essentially unremarkable. Then, EGD was performed with small bowel biopsy, which showed a moderate villous blunting and an intraepithelial lymphocyte infiltration. Celiac disease was excluded by negative conventional serology tests and the absence of clinical response to a gluten-free diet. In the interim, diarrhea became resolving without any other interventions, and clinical response was achieved even with gluten-containing diet. Two months later, he achieved a complete resolution of diarrhea and regained 20-pound weight. Spruelike enteropathy is a clinical entity manifested by chronic diarrhea and intestinal villous atrophy. Spruelike enteropathy associated with olmesartan as a cause of drug-induced diarrhea is rare, and it has been reported only in a case series to date. This case highlighted the importance for clinicians to maintain a high index of suspicion for olmesartan as a precipitant of spruelike enteropathy.},

   abstract = {AIM: Identify and characterize bacteria from the proximal gastrointestinal tract of pigs capable of degrading immunogenic gluten peptides. METHODS AND RESULTS: Bacteria were cultured from the small intestine of pigs fed a 20% gluten diet and from an enrichment media with the 18-mer peptide LQLQPFPQPQLPYPQPQL. Isolates were screened for the production of specialized proteolytic enzymes and the ability to degrade and remove metastable peptides from alpha-gliadin (16-mer and 33-mer) and omega-gliadin (17-mer), with established roles in the aetiology of coeliac disease. Degradation was determined by ELISA and mass spectrometry (UHPLC-MS/MS in MRM mode), and hydrolysis fragments were characterized by LC-MS/MS. Four strains from the species Lactobacillus ruminis, Lactobacillus johnsonii, Lactobacillus amylovorus and Lactobacillus salivarius showed the highest peptide-degrading activities. Strains displayed different degradation rates and cleavage patterns that resulted in reduction but not complete removal of immunotoxic epitopes. CONCLUSIONS: We employed a unique enrichment process to select for bacteria adapted to the conditions of the proximal gastrointestinal tract with the ability to partially detoxify well-characterized peptides involved in coeliac disease. SIGNIFICANCE AND IMPACT OF THE STUDY: This study provides a basis for the selection of Lactobacillus strains for probiotic applications aimed to reduce epitope-containing gluten peptides before reaching the epithelium of the small intestine of patients with coeliac disease.},

   abstract = {Coeliac disease is a chronic small intestinal immune-mediated enteropathy precipitated by exposure to dietary gluten in genetically predisposed individuals. The only current therapy is a lifelong gluten free diet. While much work has focused on the gliadin-specific adaptive immune response in coeliac disease, little is understood about the involvement of the innate immune system. Here we used multi-colour flow cytometry to determine the number and frequency of gammadelta T cells (Vdelta1, Vdelta2 and Vdelta3 subsets), natural killer cells, CD56(+) T cells, invariant NKT cells, and mucosal associated invariant T cells, in blood and duodenum from adults and children with coeliac disease and healthy matched controls. All circulating innate lymphocyte populations were significantly decreased in adult, but not paediatric coeliac donors, when compared with healthy controls. Within the normal small intestine, we noted that Vdelta3 cells were the most abundant gammadelta T cell type in the adult epithelium and lamina propria, and in the paediatric lamina propria. In contrast, patients with coeliac disease showed skewing toward a predominant Vdelta1 profile, observed for both adult and paediatric coeliac disease cohorts, particularly within the gut epithelium. This was concurrent with decreases in all other gut lymphocyte subsets, suggesting a specific involvement of Vdelta1 cells in coeliac disease pathogenesis. Further analysis showed that gammadelta T cells isolated from the coeliac gut display an activated, effector memory phenotype, and retain the ability to rapidly respond to in vitro stimulation. A profound loss of CD56 expression in all lymphocyte populations was noted in the coeliac gut. These findings demonstrate a sustained aberrant innate lymphocyte profile in coeliac disease patients of all ages, persisting even after elimination of gluten from the diet. This may lead to impaired immunity, and could potentially account for the increased incidence of autoimmune co-morbidity.},

   abstract = {CD is defined as T-lymphocyte-mediated gluten sensitivity. Although CD is known to affect the small intestine, it is nonetheless a multisystem disorder. Liver involvement in CD may vary from isolated hypertransaminasemia to cirrhosis. Because CD is an inappropriate immune response to gluten proteins, strict gluten-free diet is the principal therapy, along with management of liver dysfunction. In patients who fail to respond to a gluten-free diet, immunosuppressive drugs may improve intestinal inflammatory activity in untreated CD. The present case report is of a 25-yr-old woman with diarrhea lasting several weeks. The patient had received a liver transplant 13 yr earlier, and presented with cryptogenic cirrhosis diagnosed as CD. This appears to be the first case of its kind in which a pediatric long-term liver transplant patient presents with diarrhea eventually diagnosed as CD whose diet included gluten, and who was treated by an immunosuppressive drug regimen. Because of the normalization of CD-related antibodies in the post-transplantation period without gluten restriction, CD should be part of a list of diagnostic possibilities in liver transplant patients presenting with diarrhea of unknown etiology.},

   abstract = {On the basis of strong evidence, gastrointestinal symptoms and failure to thrive are classic presentations of celiac disease, but atypical, nongastrointestinal symptoms are also extremely common, particularly in the older child and adolescent. (3)(4)(8). On the basis of some research evidence and consensus, guidelines recommend celiac testing in symptomatic children with typical and atypical symptoms and consideration of testing in those with associated conditions and first-degree relatives of those with celiac disease. (3)(9). On the basis of strong research evidence, measurement of tTG IgA and total serum IgA level has been reported to be the most cost-effective and accurate means of serologic testing for celiac disease and is the test of choice unless the child is younger than 2 years or IgA deficient. (9). On the basis of strong research evidence, children with elevated titers of celiac antibodies or strong clinical suspicion for celiac disease should be referred to a gastroenterologist for upper endoscopy and biopsy. Until this procedure is performed, the child should continue on a diet with ingestion of gluten. (3)(9). On the basis of strong research evidence, all those with a confirmed diagnosis of celiac disease should follow a strict gluten-free diet for life, with avoidance of all foods that contain wheat, barley, and rye ingredients. (3)(4). Referral to a health care professional with specialized knowledge of celiac disease and the gluten-free diet is critical because of the numerous ways, often hidden, in which gluten may be present in the diet and environment.},

   abstract = {The aim of this study was to investigate the relation between Celiac disease (CD) and unexplained dysfunctional uterine bleeding (DUB) in celiac women. The celiac patients were selected from women who were referred to celiac department. Controls were selected from those women without any signs of celiac disease and matched with age. Meanwhile, a trained physician was ready to explain the study, and then in case of their allowance, a questionnaire was completed by the physician. 24 % of celiac women reported a past history of at least one menstrual cycle disorder vs 10 % of controls reported these problems (p=0.038) and higher percentage of unexplained DUB has been observed in celiac women. All celiac patients were undertaking gluten free diet for at least 3 months and the celiac patients who reported the history of DUB were again interviewed for any signs of unexplained DUB. From 12 celiac women with DUB, 10 patients reported no more unexplained DUB after getting gluten-free diet (83.3 %). The occurrence of a significant correlation between CD and DUB suggests the possibility of considering CD as one of the potential causes of abnormal uterine bleeding. Therefore, celiac disease must be seriously considered in the screening of patients with reproductive disorders (Tab. 2,Ref. 23).},

   abstract = {Celiac disease (CD) is regarded as the most common autoimmune enteropathy in western countries. Epidemiological studies indicate that approximately 1:100 individuals may present with histologically proven CD. CD develops in genetically predisposed subjects after gluten ingestion. It usually subsides after gluten is withdrawn from their diet. Gluten is the only known environmental factor that affects the progression/regression of the intestinal villous atrophy, which is the hallmark of this disease. CD generally follows a benign course after gluten elimination. However, it is also associated with the development of other autoimmune disorders or of intestinal malignancies. The issue of whether such complications, sometimes of significant clinical and prognostic impact, are or are not the result of ongoing gluten ingestion, is an important one that has been investigated over the recent years with conflicting results. In terms of practical implications, the presence of a positive correlation between gluten intake and the development of severe complications would lead to the need for early diagnosis and mass screening. The lack of such correlation would instead suggest a less aggressive diagnostic strategy. This review aims at critically summarizing the evidence supporting either hypothesis.},

   abstract = {A 14-year-old boy was referred to a paediatric clinic after a recent diagnosis of coeliac disease, which was well controlled on a gluten-free diet. During the consultation, the mother raised concerns regarding marks that had developed over her son's back over the past 6 months. On examination, a number of horizontal, coloured bruise-like marks were noted over the lower back. The appearance was suspicious of bruising and possible non-accidental injury, although a history of trauma or injury was denied. Blood tests including a coagulation screen were arranged which were normal and the patient was followed up twice during a 6-month period. He remained well but the bruising was persistent. It was concluded that these were striae associated with pubertal growth. This case summarises the importance of careful surveillance of bruising in children and illustrates the association between striae and pubertal growth which may be confused with non-accidental injury.},

   abstract = {Patients with coeliac disease and myocardial infarction have a more favourable atherosclerotic risk factor profile than controls with myocardial infarction (MI). Therefore, MI prognosis and treatment may differ according to coeliac status. This paper reports on the study of Swedish MI patients with and without coeliac disease (equal to villous atrophy; Marsh histopathology stage 3) based on duodenal or jejunal biopsy data. We used the Swedish Quality Register (SWEDEHEART) to identify individuals with a record of MI from 2005 to 2008 and to obtain data on medication, coronary interventions, and clinical and laboratory parameters at 6-10 weeks and one year after first MI. One-year mortality and coronary interventions were assessed for 430 coeliac patients and 1988 controls. For other outcome variables, we compared 42 coeliac patients with MI and 201 general population controls with MI. Odds ratios (ORs) were calculated by logistic regression. The results showed that compared with controls with MI, coeliac individuals with MI had significantly higher one-year all-cause mortality (OR = 1.43; 95% confidence interval (CI) = 1.04-1.95) but less often underwent a percutaneous coronary intervention (OR = 0.77; 95% CI = 0.61-0.96). Coeliac patients were more often prescribed warfarin but less often aspirin and statins. The readmission rate due to cardiac events in coeliac patients was 15.2% vs. 12.6% in controls (p-value = 0.69). Other clinical and laboratory parameters were similar. We conclude that the follow up of MI does not seem to differ between coeliac patients and controls, and is unlikely to explain the excess mortality from cardiovascular disease noted in Swedish patients with CD.},

The aim of this study was to explore the diet compliance and depression and anxiety levels of pediatric celiac children and their families after a gluten-free diet. MATERIALS AND METHODS: A total of 30 celiac pediatric patients (17 children [57%] and 13 adolescents [43%]) were enrolled in the study, and 20 healthy controls (11 children [55%] and 9 adolescents [45%]) were studied as controls. Depression was assessed with the Children's Depression Inventory (CDI) form, and anxiety was assessed with the Screen for Child Anxiety Related Disorders (SCARED) form. Diet compliance was measured with a diet compliance form, and the families were asked to complete the Beck Depression Measurement (BDI) form for depression and the State-Trait Anxiety Inventory I-II (STAI-I and STAI-II) forms for anxiety. RESULTS: There was no significant difference in depression and anxiety between pediatric celiac patients consuming a gluten-free diet and the healthy control group. We observed no difference in depression and anxiety in the Celiac CD group patients. Diet compliance was 73.3% in the study group. CONCLUSION: The depression and anxiety levels of pediatric celiac patients and their parents did not differ from those in the healthy group.},

   abstract = {Recently, increasing attention has been paid to the pathologic role of food in irritable bowel syndrome (IBS). Nevertheless, healthcare providers often avoid addressing diet with their patients because of a lack of training, guideline consensus, and high-quality data. Recent literature supports the existence of a subgroup of IBS patients with undiagnosed nonceliac gluten sensitivity (NCGS), a term that is used to describe individuals who experience gastrointestinal and extraintestinal symptoms as a result of immunologic, morphologic, or symptomatic abnormalities that are precipitated by the ingestion of gluten. NCGS represents an important subgroup of patients with IBS who are highly treatable via dietary modification. Gluten may influence gastrointestinal symptoms through immune activation or alteration of intestinal permeability, but the true role of food in functional gastrointestinal symptomatology remains unclear. For example, gluten is just 1 component of the complex milieu of nutrients found in wheat and related grains, and NCGS likely represents only the tip of the iceberg as it pertains to the role of food in IBS.},

   abstract = {Celiac disease (CD) is a chronic disease causing the inflammation of the proximal small intestine, in genetically predisposed individuals. This is triggered by the consumption of the gluten protein and the side effects of the disease are mitigated by a lifelong gluten-free diet (GFD) treatment. The predominant consequence of CD is malnutrition due to malabsorption (with diarrhea, weight loss, nutritional deficiencies, and altered blood parameters), especially in patients who do not show strict adherence to GFD treatment. Recent evidence shows that, despite a lifelong GFD, some functional disorders persist, such as compromised gallbladder function and motility, exocrine pancreatic insufficiency, increased gut permeability, small-intestinal bowel overgrowth, nonalcoholic fatty liver disease (NAFLD), lactose intolerance, and milk allergy. These abnormalities may predispose to the occurrence of overweight and obesity even in CD patients. This review focuses on the principal functional and metabolic disorders in both treated and untreated CD, ranging from alterations of the gastrointestinal system to impaired glucose and lipid metabolism and insulin secretion with the aim of providing new implications beyond a GFD, for an ad hoc nutrition treatment in these patients.},

   abstract = {BACKGROUND & AIMS: An increase in CD3+TCRgammadelta+ and a decrease in CD3- intraepithelial lymphocytes (IEL) is a characteristic flow cytometric pattern of celiac disease (CD) with atrophy. The aim was to evaluate the usefulness of both CD IEL cytometric pattern and anti-TG2 IgA subepithelial deposit analysis (CD IF pattern) for diagnosing lymphocytic enteritis due to CD. METHODS: Two-hundred and five patients (144 females) who underwent duodenal biopsy for clinical suspicion of CD and positive celiac genetics were prospectively included. Fifty had villous atrophy, 70 lymphocytic enteritis, and 85 normal histology. Eight patients with non-celiac atrophy and 15 with lymphocytic enteritis secondary to Helicobacter pylori acted as control group. Duodenal biopsies were obtained to assess both CD IEL flow cytometric (complete or incomplete) and IF patterns. RESULTS: Sensitivity of IF, and complete and incomplete cytometric patterns for CD diagnosis in patients with positive serology (Marsh 1+3) was 92%, 85 and 97% respectively, but only the complete cytometric pattern had 100% specificity. Twelve seropositive and 8 seronegative Marsh 1 patients had a CD diagnosis at inclusion or after gluten free-diet, respectively. CD cytometric pattern showed a better diagnostic performance than both IF pattern and serology for CD diagnosis in lymphocytic enteritis at baseline (95% vs 60% vs 60%, p = 0.039). CONCLUSIONS: Analysis of the IEL flow cytometric pattern is a fast, accurate method for identifying CD in the initial diagnostic biopsy of patients presenting with lymphocytic enteritis, even in seronegative patients, and seems to be better than anti-TG2 intestinal deposits.},

   abstract = {Coeliac disease is characterized by intestinal inflammation caused by gluten, proteins which are widely contained in the Western diet. Mammalian digestive enzymes are only partly capable of cleaving gluten, and fragments remain that induce toxic responses in patients with coeliac disease. We found that the oral microbiome is a novel and rich source of gluten-degrading organisms. Here we report on the isolation and characterization of the cultivable resident oral microbes that are capable of cleaving gluten, with special emphasis on the immunogenic domains. Bacteria were obtained by a selective culturing approach and enzyme activities were characterized by: (i) hydrolysis of paranitroanilide-derivatized gliadin-derived tripeptide substrates; (ii) gliadin degradation in-gel (gliadin zymography); (iii) gliadin degradation in solution; (iv) proteolysis of the highly immunogenic alpha-gliadin-derived 33-mer peptide. For selected strains pH activity profiles were determined. The culturing strategy yielded 87 aerobic and 63 anaerobic strains. Species with activity in at least two of the four assays were typed as: Rothia mucilaginosa HOT-681, Rothia aeria HOT-188, Actinomyces odontolyticus HOT-701, Streptococcus mitis HOT-677, Streptococcus sp. HOT-071, Neisseria mucosa HOT-682 and Capnocytophaga sputigena HOT-775, with Rothia species being active in all four assays. Cleavage specificities and substrate preferences differed among the strains identified. The approximate molecular weights of the enzymes were ~75 kD (Rothia spp.), ~60 kD (A. odontolyticus) and ~150 kD (Streptococcus spp.). In conclusion, this study identified new gluten-degrading microorganisms in the upper gastrointestinal tract. A cocktail of the most active oral bacteria, or their isolated enzymes, may offer promising new treatment modalities for coeliac disease.},

   abstract = {Although a range of neurological and psychiatric disorders are widely reported to be associated with coeliac patients, their pathogenesis remains unclear. Some such disorders are believed to be secondary to vitamin deficiency due to malabsorption, others to immune mechanisms. We hypothesise that hyperhomocysteinemia might, by damaging the blood-brain barrier, expose neuronal tissue to all neuro-irritative metabolites, such as homocysteine itself, a neurotoxic excitatory and proconvulsant amino acid. Neurons respond to these stimuli through hyperexcitability, thereby predisposing subjects to neurological disorders such as epilepsy and headache. Furthermore, persisting endothelial damage may cause blood extravasation and subsequent deposition of calcium salts. We suggest that this might be the pathogenesis of the CEC syndrome, which is characterized by the association of coeliac disease, epilepsy and cerebral calcifications. Indeed, homocysteine plays a well-known role in cardiovascular endothelial dysfunction, with high serum and cerebrospinal fluid levels often being reported in coeliac patients. Moreover, data in the literature show a strong, growing association of homocysteine with epilepsy and migraine in non-coeliac subjects. Despite these findings, homocysteine has never been held directly responsible for neuronal functional features (neuronal hyperexcitability underlying epilepsy and migraine) and structural brain damage (expressed as cerebral calcification) in coeliac patients. Damage to the blood-brain barrier might also facilitate immune reactions against neuronal tissue to a considerable extent. This hypothesis combines the two afore-mentioned theories (vitamin deficiency due to malabsorption and immune mechanisms). We also wish to point out that no studies have yet investigated the prevalence of neuronal hyperexcitability and subclinical electroencephalic abnormalities in children and adults with newly-diagnosed coeliac disease before the introduction of a gluten-free diet, and in particular any changes following the introduction of the diet. We believe that the onset of clinical symptoms such as migraine and convulsions is preceded by a period in which damage is expressed exclusively by subclinical electroencephalic abnormalities; persisting damage to neuronal tissue subsequently leads to clinical manifestations. We propose two types of investigations: the first is to determine whether newly-diagnosed coeliac patients with hyperhomocysteinemia are a subgroup at risk for neurological features (clinical and subclinical); the second is to determine whether appropriate treatment of hyperhomocysteinemia and vitamin B status deficiency improves neurological abnormalities and reduces the risk of cerebral calcifications. The aim of these investigations is to develop new therapeutic strategies designed to prevent neuronal damage and increase the quality of life in children affected by such disorders.},

   abstract = {OBJECTIVES: Due to the similarity in the clinical presentation, morphology, and course, celiac disease (CD) may be mixed up with other immunological disorders, such as multiple sclerosis (MS). CASE REPORT: In a 43-year-old Caucasian male with a history of diarrhea and colics since young age, progressive sensory disturbances developed since age 18 years. At age 34, he was diagnosed as relapsing-remitting MS upon an inflammatory CSF-syndrome and non-specific white matter lesions and treated with interferon beta-1b during the next 8 years without effect. At age 35, axonal polyneuropathy and ataxia were diagnosed. Despite normal anti-gliadin, endomysial, and transglutaminase antibodies, CD was diagnosed at age 41, based upon the history, polyneuropathy, positivity for HLA-DQ2 and HLA-DQ8, the white matter lesions, and a beneficial response of the gastrointestinal problems and polyneuropathy to gluten-free diet. CONCLUSIONS: CD may mimic MS and may be present despite the absence of anti-gliadin, endomysial or transglutaminase antibodies. CD should be considered if there is a gastrointestinal problem, polyneuropathy, and ataxia, even if CSF and MRI findings are suggestive of MS.},

   abstract = {BACKGROUND: Celiac disease (CD) is a chronic autoimmune illness of the small intestine triggered by gluten consumption in genetically predisposed individuals. CD presentation is not limited to the gastrointestinal tract and it is still under-diagnosed. Complete resolution of clinical manifestations follows if a gluten-free diet is adopted. In western countries, CD prevalence is approximately 1%. Age of onset is often between 6 months and 7 years.We assessed the approach to diagnosis and management of celiac patients by the paediatricians in Puglia Region, Italy. METHODS: We conducted a cross-sectional survey among the 589 Apulian Family Paediatricians (FPs) during January 2011-January 2012 using a self-administered web-based standardized questionnaire including self-assessment of their knowledge, diagnostic path and type of management they would follow for CD, clinical information on their celiac patients. We assessed associations among the explored variables by defining double-entry contingency tables and calculating Odds Ratio (OR) with 95% Confidence Intervals (CIs). RESULTS: The 218 (37%) FPs participating in the study reported 1,020 CD patients (representing approximately 1% of the child population covered by the enrolled FPs). Of them, 55% were female; 45% were aged 5-10 years. Weight loss and stunting were the main reported symptoms at diagnosis (41%). The majority (98%) of FPs requested anti-transglutaminase antibody (tTG-Ab) titres for CD diagnosis. Approximately 78% of FPs recommended gluten introduction in the diet of infants at the age of 6 months; 12% and 8% recommended introduction of gluten before and after 6 months of age respectively.The degree of knowledge for either CD diagnosis making process or CD related diseases was medium/high in 97% and 82% of the participating FPs respectively. FPs (83%) who had a medium or high degree of knowledge of CD patients' diet were more likely to experience low or no difficulty in providing their patients with dietary advices (OR:5.5; 95%CI:1.7-17.5). CONCLUSIONS: Apulian FPs report a good degree of knowledge of CD, its diagnosis and its management. We will diffuse results and recommendations to all paediatricians in the Region. Actions aiming to continued education on CD in medical under and postgraduate trainings are crucial to prevent under-diagnosis.},

   abstract = {The sympathetic nervous system plays an important role in some forms of human hypertension as well as the Dahl salt-sensitive rat model of hypertension; however, the sympathetic targets involved remain unclear. To address this, we examined the role of the renal and splanchnic sympathetic nerves in Dahl hypertension by performing sham surgery (n=10) or targeted sympathetic ablation of the renal nerves (renal denervation, n=11), the splanchnic nerves (celiac ganglionectomy, n=11), or both renal and splanchnic nerves (n=11) in hypertensive Dahl rats. Mean arterial pressure increased from approximately 120 mm Hg, while on a 0.1% sodium chloride diet, to approximately 140 mm Hg after being fed a 4.0% sodium chloride diet for 3 weeks. At that point, rats underwent sham or targeted sympathetic ablation. Four weeks after treatment, mean arterial pressure was lower in renal denervated (150.4+/-10.4) and celiac ganglionectomized (147.0+/-6.1) rats compared with sham rats (165.0+/-3.7) and even lower in rats that underwent both ablations (128.4+/-6.6). There were no differences in heart rate or fluid balance between sham and renal denervated rats; however, rats that underwent either celiac ganglionectomy or both ablations exhibited marked tachycardia as well as sodium and water retention after treatment. These data suggest that targeted sympathetic ablation is an effective treatment for established hypertension in the Dahl rat and that the kidneys and the splanchnic vascular bed are both independently important targets of the sympathetic nervous system in this model.},

   abstract = {Gluten-free diet (GFD) is the cornerstone treatment for celiac disease (CD). This diet excludes the protein gluten a protein forum in in grains such as wheat, barley, rye and triticale. Gluten causes small intestines inflammation in patients with CD and eating a GFD helps these patients in controlling signs and symptoms and prevent complications. Following a GFD may be frustrating, however, it is important to know that plenty of foods are naturally gluten-free and nowadays is relatively easy to find substitutes for gluten-containing foods. Certain grains, such as oats, are generally safe but can be contaminated with wheat during growing and processing stages of production. For this reason, it is generally recommended avoiding oats unless they are specifically labelled gluten-free. Other products that may contain gluten include food additives, such as malt flavouring, modified food starch and some supplement and/or vitamins that use gluten as a binding agent. Cross-contamination occurs when gluten-free foods come into contact with foods that contain gluten. It can happen during the manufacturing process or if the same equipment is used to make a variety of products. Cross-contamination can also occur at home if foods are prepared on common surfaces or with utensils that have not been cleaned after being used to prepare gluten-containing foods (using a toaster for gluten-free and regular bread). Although safe and effective, the GFD is not ideal: it is expensive, of limited nutritional value, and not readily available in many countries. Consequently, a need exists for novel, non-dietary therapies for celiac disease. Advances in understanding the immunopathogenesis of CD have suggested several types of therapeutic strategies alternative to the GFD. Some of these strategies attempt to decrease the immunogenicity of gluten-containing grains by manipulating the grain itself or by using oral enzymes to break down immunogenic peptides that normally remain intact during digestion. Other strategies focus on preventing the absorption of these peptides, preventing tissue transglutaminase from rendering gluten peptides more immunogenic, or inhibiting their binding to CD-specific antigen-presenting molecules. Strategies that limit T cell migration to the small intestine or that re-establish mucosal homeostasis and tolerance to gluten antigens are also being explored.},

   abstract = {This study aimed to investigate the salivary microbiota and metabolome of 13 children with celiac disease (CD) under a gluten-free diet (treated celiac disease [T-CD]). The same number of healthy children (HC) was used as controls. The salivary microbiota was analyzed by an integrated approach using culture-dependent and -independent methods. Metabolome analysis was carried out by gas chromatography-mass spectrometry-solid-phase microextraction. Compared to HC, the number of some cultivable bacterial groups (e.g., total anaerobes) significantly (P < 0.05) differed in the saliva samples of the T-CD children. As shown by community-level catabolic profiles, the highest Shannon's diversity and substrate richness were found in HC. Pyrosequencing data showed the highest richness estimator and diversity index values for HC. Levels of Lachnospiraceae, Gemellaceae, and Streptococcus sanguinis were highest for the T-CD children. Streptococcus thermophilus levels were markedly decreased in T-CD children. The saliva of T-CD children showed the largest amount of Bacteroidetes (e.g., Porphyromonas sp., Porphyromonas endodontalis, and Prevotella nanceiensis), together with the smallest amount of Actinobacteria. T-CD children were also characterized by decreased levels of some Actinomyces species, Atopobium species, and Corynebacterium durum. Rothia mucilaginosa was the only Actinobacteria species found at the highest level in T-CD children. As shown by multivariate statistical analyses, the levels of organic volatile compounds markedly differentiated T-CD children. Some compounds (e.g., ethyl-acetate, nonanal, and 2-hexanone) were found to be associated with T-CD children. Correlations (false discovery rate [FDR], <0.05) were found between the relative abundances of bacteria and some volatile organic compounds (VOCs). The findings of this study indicated that CD is associated with oral dysbiosis that could affect the oral metabolome.},

Compliance, however, is difficult and gluten-free food products are costly, and, sometimes very inconvenient. A number of potential alternative measures have been proposed to either replace or supplement gluten-free diet therapy. In the past, non-dietary forms of treatment were used (e.g., corticosteroids) by some clinicians, often to supplement a gluten-free diet in patients that appeared to be poorly responsive to a gluten-free diet. Some of new and novel non-dietary measures have already advanced to a clinical trial phase. There are still some difficulties even if initial studies suggest a particularly exciting and novel form of non-dietary treatment. In particular, precise monitoring of the response to these agents will become critical. Symptom or laboratory improvement may be important, but it will be critical to ensure that ongoing inflammatory change and mucosal injury are not present. Therapeutic trials will be made more difficult because there is already an effective treatment regimen.},

   abstract = {INTRODUCTION: Celiac disease is an immune-mediated gluten-dependent disorder, primarily affecting the small intestine in genetically predisposed individuals. The disorder has a very heterogeneous clinical and histopathological spectrum. Current treatment with a gluten-free diet is very effective, but the diet is difficult to maintain and remains costly. AREAS COVERED: Alternatives to the gluten-free diet have been proposed to either replace this current treatment, or at least, to supplement use of the gluten-free diet. Studies in the published English language literature relevant to this review were examined for this report. EXPERT OPINION: Most recent published double-blind, placebo-controlled clinical trials have focused on an orally administered recombinant glutenase (ALV003) showing significant but limited benefit to celiac disease patients already compliant with a gluten-free diet. Other studies have addressed other immune mechanisms that may play a role in its pathogenesis and have not been so positive. Added investigations, particularly over the long-term, in other larger and more heterogeneous populations are needed.},

   abstract = {UNLABELLED: The current treatment for celiac disease is strict gluten-free diet. Technical processing may render gluten-containing foods safe for consumption by celiac patients, but so far in vivo safety testing can only be performed on patients. We modified a celiac disease mouse model to test antigenicity and inflammatory effects of germinated rye sourdough, a food product characterized by extensive prolamin hydrolysis. Lymphopenic Rag1-/- or nude mice were injected with splenic CD4+CD62L-CD44high-memory T cells from gliadin- or secalin-immunized wild-type donor mice. We found that: 1) Rag1-/- recipients challenged with wheat or rye gluten lost more body weight and developed more severe histological duodenitis than mice on gluten-free diet. This correlated with increased secretion of IFNgamma, IL-2, and IL-17 by secalin-restimulated splenocytes. 2) In vitro gluten testing using competitive R5 ELISA demonstrated extensive degradation of the gluten R5 epitope in germinated rye sourdough. 3) However, in nude recipients challenged with germinated rye sourdough (vs. native rye sourdough), serum anti-secalin IgG/CD4+ T helper 1-associated IgG2c titers were only reduced, but not eliminated. In addition, there were no reductions in body weight loss, histological duodenitis, or T cell cytokine secretion in Rag1-/- recipients challenged accordingly. IN CONCLUSION: 1) prolamin-primed CD4+CD62L-CD44high-memory T cells induce gluten-sensitive enteropathy in Rag1-/- mice. 2) Hydrolysis of secalins in germinated rye sourdough remains incomplete. Secalin peptides retain B and T cell stimulatory capacity and remain harmful to the intestinal mucosa in this celiac disease model. 3) Current antibody-based prolamin detection methods may fail to detect antigenic gluten fragments in processed cereal food products.},

   abstract = {The introduction of cereals in human nutrition 10 000 years ago caused the occurrence of gluten induced diseases. This protein complex is involved in pathogenesis of wheat allergy, celiac disease, and gluten sensitivity. Wheat allergy and celiac disease are mediated by the system of adaptive immunity. Gluten sensitivity is a recently defined entity induced by innate immune mechanisms. These subjects present various intestinal and particularly extraintestinal symptoms. The differences between celiac disease and gluten intolerance include permeability of the intestinal mucosal barrier, histology of duodenal biopsy, and mucosal gene expression. The symptoms of gluten sensitivity may also have another genetic background of food intolerance independent of the HLADQ2, - DQ8 system and tissue transglutaminase (eg. in some psychiatric disorders). At present, there is no specific bio-marker of gluten sensitivity. The diagnosis is possible only by exclusion of other causes of symptoms and improvement on a glutenfree diet applied in a doubleblind placebo controlled manner with optional sequence of both stages to exclude the placebo effect due to nutritional intervention.},

   abstract = {BACKGROUND: A lactose breath test (LBT) is usually used to diagnose lactase deficiency, and a lactose quick test (LQT) has been proposed as a new test on duodenal biopsies to detect this disorder. GOALS: We aimed to assess the diagnostic accuracy of LBT and LQT and their ability to predict the clinical response to a lactose-free diet in patients with self-reported lactose intolerance. STUDY: Fifty-five patients (age 47 +/- 14 y; M/F 15/36) underwent upper gastrointestinal endoscopy and 25g-LBT. Two duodenal biopsies were taken to determine lactase deficiency (normal, mild, or severe) by LQT and to rule out other causes of secondary lactose malabsorption. Patients with a positive LBT and normal LQT also underwent a glucose breath test to exclude small intestinal bacterial overgrowth as a cause of the former result. The severity of gastrointestinal symptoms was measured with a GSS questionnaire, under basal condition and 1 month after a lactose-free diet. RESULTS: Lactose malabsorption was detected in 31/51 patients with LBT and in 37/51 patients with LQT (P = NS). Celiac disease was found in 2 patients. Two LBT+ patients showed a positive glucose breath test for small intestinal bacterial overgrowth. Eight patients had a mild hypolactasia by LQT and a negative LBT, but they had a significant improvement of symptoms after diet. LQT and LBT were concordant in 83% of cases and predicted the response to a lactose-free diet in 98% and 81% of the cases, respectively (P = 0.03). CONCLUSIONS: LQT is as sensitive as LBT in detecting lactase deficiency; however, it seems to be more accurate than LBT in predicting the clinical response to a lactose-free diet.},

   abstract = {AIM: Celiac disease (CD) is a multifactorial autoimmune disease induced by ingestion of gluten in genetically predisposed individuals. Despite technological progress, the diagnosis of CD is still based on duodenal biopsy as it was 50 years ago. In this study we analysed the expression of CD-associated genes in small bowel biopsies of patients and controls in order to explore the multivariate pathway of the expression profile of CD patients. Then, using multivariant discriminant analysis, we evaluated whether the expression profiles of these genes in peripheral blood monocytes (PBMs) differed between patients and controls. PARTICIPANTS: Thirty-seven patients with active and 11 with treated CD, 40 healthy controls and 9 disease controls (Crohn's disease patients) were enrolled. RESULTS: Several genes were differentially expressed in CD patients versus controls, but the analysis of each single gene did not provided a comprehensive picture. A multivariate discriminant analysis showed that the expression of 5 genes in intestinal mucosa accounted for 93% of the difference between CD patients and controls. We then applied the same approach to PBMs, on a training set of 20 samples. The discriminant equation obtained was validated on a testing cohort of 10 additional cases and controls, and we obtained a correct classification of all CD cases and of 91% of the control samples. We applied this equation to treated CD patients and to disease controls and obtained a discrimination of 100%. CONCLUSIONS: The combined expression of 4 genes allows one to discriminate between CD patients and controls, and between CD patients on a gluten-free diet and disease controls. Our results contribute to the understanding of the complex interactions among CD-associated genes, and they may represent a starting point for the development of a molecular diagnosis of celiac disease.},

   abstract = {Immediately following birth, the gastrointestinal tract is colonized with a complex community of bacteria, which helps shape the immune system. Under conditions of health, the immune system is able to differentiate between innocuous antigens, including food protein and commensals, and harmful antigens such as pathogens. However, patients with celiac disease (CD) develop an intolerance to gluten proteins which results in a pro-inflammatory T-cell mediated immune response with production of anti-gluten and anti-tissue transglutaminase antibodies. This adaptive immune response, in conjunction with activation of innate inflammatory cells, lead to destruction of the small intestinal mucosa. Overall 30% of the global population has genetic risk to develop CD. However, only a small proportion develop CD, suggesting that additional environmental factors must play a role in disease pathogenesis. Alterations in small intestinal microbial composition have recently been associated with active CD, indicating a possible role for the microbiota in CD. However, studies demonstrating causality are lacking. This review will highlight the recent data on the potential role of the microbiota in CD pathogenesis, the potential mechanisms, and discuss future research directions.},

   abstract = {OBJECTIVES: Elafin, an endogenous serine protease inhibitor, modulates colonic inflammation. We investigated the role of elafin in celiac disease (CD) using human small intestinal tissues and in vitro assays of gliadin deamidation. We also investigated the potential beneficial effects of elafin in a mouse model of gluten sensitivity. METHODS: Epithelial elafin expression in the small intestine of patients with active CD, treated CD, and controls without CD was determined by immunofluorescence. Interaction of elafin with human tissue transglutaminase-2 (TG-2) was investigated in vitro. The 33-mer peptide, a highly immunogenic gliadin peptide, was incubated with TG-2 and elafin at different concentrations. The degree of deamidation of the 33-mer peptide was analyzed by liquid chromatography-mass spectrometry. Elafin was delivered to the intestine of gluten-sensitive mice using a recombinant Lactococcus lactis vector. Small intestinal barrier function, inflammation, proteolytic activity, and zonula occludens-1 (ZO-1) expression were assessed. RESULTS: Elafin expression in the small intestinal epithelium was lower in patients with active CD compared with control patients. In vitro, elafin significantly slowed the kinetics of the deamidation of the 33-mer peptide to its more immunogenic form. Treatment of gluten-sensitive mice with elafin delivered by the L. lactis vector normalized inflammation, improved permeability, and maintained ZO-1 expression. CONCLUSIONS: The decreased elafin expression in the small intestine of patients with active CD, the reduction of 33-mer peptide deamidation by elafin, coupled to the barrier enhancing and anti-inflammatory effects observed in gluten-sensitive mice, suggest that this molecule may have pathophysiological and therapeutic importance in gluten-related disorders.},

   abstract = {The human gut microbiome impacts human brain health in numerous ways: (1) Structural bacterial components such as lipopolysaccharides provide low-grade tonic stimulation of the innate immune system. Excessive stimulation due to bacterial dysbiosis, small intestinal bacterial overgrowth, or increased intestinal permeability may produce systemic and/or central nervous system inflammation. (2) Bacterial proteins may cross-react with human antigens to stimulate dysfunctional responses of the adaptive immune system. (3) Bacterial enzymes may produce neurotoxic metabolites such as D-lactic acid and ammonia. Even beneficial metabolites such as short-chain fatty acids may exert neurotoxicity. (4) Gut microbes can produce hormones and neurotransmitters that are identical to those produced by humans. Bacterial receptors for these hormones influence microbial growth and virulence. (5) Gut bacteria directly stimulate afferent neurons of the enteric nervous system to send signals to the brain via the vagus nerve. Through these varied mechanisms, gut microbes shape the architecture of sleep and stress reactivity of the hypothalamic-pituitary-adrenal axis. They influence memory, mood, and cognition and are clinically and therapeutically relevant to a range of disorders, including alcoholism, chronic fatigue syndrome, fibromyalgia, and restless legs syndrome. Their role in multiple sclerosis and the neurologic manifestations of celiac disease is being studied. Nutritional tools for altering the gut microbiome therapeutically include changes in diet, probiotics, and prebiotics.},

   abstract = {BACKGROUND: Adequate gluten-free diet (GFD) is the only treatment for coeliac disease (CD). However, no agreement has been reached on either how and when to assess patient adherence to GFD or its effectiveness on villous atrophy. AIM: To assess, in a prospective study, patient adherence to and efficacy of GFD on histological recovery after 1-year of GFD. METHODS: Between 2009 and 2012, we enrolled 65 consecutive newly-diagnosed adult patients (median age 38 years, 18-70) with biopsy-proven atrophic CD. Patients were re-evaluated after 1 year of GFD with duodenal histology, serological assays, symptoms and a dietary interview based on a validated questionnaire. Complete histological recovery was defined as the absence of villous atrophy and </=30/100 intraepithelial lymphocytes. RESULTS: Overall, 81.5% of patients had adequate adherence (ADA) to GFD, whereas 18.5% had an inadequate adherence (IADA); 66% of ADA patients and no IADA patients achieved complete histological recovery (P < 0.00001). Among ADA patients, antibody seroconversion and symptoms were not significantly different between patients who achieved complete histological recovery and those who achieved partial histological recovery with P = 0.309 and P = 0.197, respectively. Multivariate analysis showed that Marsh 3C was a risk factor for incomplete histological recovery in ADA patients (OR 8.74, 95% CI: 1.87-40.83). CONCLUSIONS: This study shows that complete histological recovery after 1-year of GFD in adult patients, who are assessed as adherent to the GFD, can be obtained in 66% of patients. Patients with severe histological damage at diagnosis are at risk for incomplete histological recovery 1 year later.},

   abstract = {Aim. To identify the predictors of compliance to gluten free diet in children with celiac disease. Methods. 134 children in the study group were assessed for dietary compliance followed by a questionnaire based interview. Psychosocial parameters were assessed by standard Pediatric Symptom Checklist (PSC). Dietary compliant and noncompliant groups were compared and assessed for factors affecting the dietary compliance. Predictability of all of these factors was assessed using binary logistic regression analysis with backward elimination to find out the best predictors of compliance. Results. In the study group, 88 (65.67%) were found to be strictly compliant. Factors that were found to be significantly associated with compliance were age at presentation, nuclear families, mother's education, and parents having better knowledge of celiac disease. Parents' and child's attitude towards his having to follow a restrictive diet and child's feelings were also shown to be significantly associated with compliance. Binary logistic regression analysis with backward elimination demonstrated that age at presentation, family type, child's attitude, and child's behaviour made a significant contribution to prediction. Conclusions. These results will contribute to the current body of research by providing health care practitioners with a framework for better dietary instruction to ensure maximum adherence to GFD.},

   abstract = {Celiac disease (CD) is an immune-mediated systemic disorder elicited by gluten and related prolamines in genetically susceptible individuals and is characterized by the presence of a variable combination of gluten-dependent clinical manifestations, CD-specific antibodies, HLA-DQ2 or HLA-DQ8 haplotypes and enteropathy. CD is triggered by wheat gluten and related prolamines in barley and rye. Worldwide, the disease affects approximately 1 % of the general population. Clinical features of CD vary considerably. Intestinal symptoms are more common in young children. In older children extra intestinal manifestations affecting almost all organs are seen. IgA tTG antibody, upper GI endoscopy with histological analysis of multiple biopsies of the duodenum and in selected cases HLA DQ2 and DQ8 positivity and endomysial antibodies (EMA) are needed for diagnosis. Currently, the only treatment for CD is a life-long gluten-free diet (GFD). Strict avoidance of wheat, rye, barley and their derivatives will result in intestinal healing and relief of symptoms for the majority of individuals with CD. The GFD is simple in principle, however, completely eliminating all foods and ingredients containing wheat, rye, barley, and most commercial oats can be very challenging. Newly diagnosed CD children should undergo testing and treatment for micronutrient deficiencies specially iron, folic acid, vitamin D, and vitamin B12. Long-term monitoring and follow up of patients with CD is necessary.},

   abstract = {Celiac disease (CD) is a chronic inflammatory enteropathy caused by the ingestion of gluten. A safe and efficient but unpleasant treatment exists for CD in form of a strict gluten-free diet. Thus, there is a need for new treatment strategies, which are based on the improved and advanced understanding of the pathophysiology of CD. The first strategy consists in reducing or even eliminating major antigenic motifs in gluten, responsible for the inflammatory reaction. The use of less immunogenic wheat was suggested but this seems rather difficult to realize. However, a complete digestion of the immunogenic parts of gluten looks very promising. This can be obtained by the use of polymers, capable to sequester gluten proteins or even better via the exogenous administration of propyl-endopeptidases, with two different enzymes under development. Another approach could be the use of inhibitors of tissue transglutaminase, a strategy which is under clinical investigation. Alternatively, inhibition of the site of liaison of immunostimulatory peptides with HLA molecules was suggested and is also under investigation in vivo. For patients suffering from refractory sprue, the inhibition of IL15 might be of therapeutic interest with the hope to improve the fatal outcome of many of these patients. However, the ultimate treatment approach is in form of prevention and the role of infectious agents, such as Rotavirus, in disease onset has to be considered.},

   abstract = {Throughout the world, cereals have always been recognized as a fundamental food. Human evolution, through the development of cooking, led to the production of food rich in gluten, in order to take full advantage of the nutritional properties of this food. The result has been that gluten intolerance has arisen only in those populations that developed the art of cooking wheat. It is also recognized that wheat, one of the central elements of the Mediterranean diet, cannot be tolerated in some individuals. Among the wheat-related pathologies, coeliac disease is the best known: it is a chronic inflammatory condition affecting the gastrointestinal tract, which develops in genetically predisposed individuals. The most common manifestation is the malabsorption of nutrients. Recently, another wheat-related disease has appeared: non-coeliac gluten sensitivity, defined as the onset of a variety of manifestations related to wheat, rye and barley ingestion, in patients in whom coeliac disease and wheat allergy have been excluded. In this paper we will explore the damaging power of wheat, analysing the harmful process by which it realizes the onset of clinical manifestations associated with wheat-related disorders.},

   abstract = {The celiac disease is an ancient pathology, present since the introduction of the wheat in the diet, of which the first description of the compatible clinical symptoms and signs goes back to 250 A.D. Today it is known that the expression of this pathology is multifaceted, ranging from clinical features indicative of bowel disease and malabsorption, until symptoms once unexpected, because of their extra-digestive clinical features. With our work, we wanted to retrace the history of this disease, correlating it with the intake of gluten present in wheat after cooking , ever since mankind has increased the cultivation of cereals. Re-evaluating the clinical and instrumental methods for the diagnosis of Celiac Disease, and benefitting from the most modern techniques for the morphological, biochemical and genetic study of the patients, we sought to understand whether the incidence of the disease is actually increased or if has been considered less frequent for the lower valuation of the signs once deemed more atypical, but currently considered preliminary indicative of the pathology, for its association with other autoimmune diseases, and for the study of some genetic and familiar characteristics. Each of these factors has led the modern medicine to increase epidemiological studies and expand the research potential carriers of celiac disease with safer diagnostic tests.},

   abstract = {A gluten-free diet (GFD) is currently the only available treatment for patients with celiac disease (CD). Several clinical trials have demonstrated that most celiac patients can tolerate a medium-high quantity of oats without any negative clinical effects; however, the inclusion of oats in GFD is still a matter of debate. In this study, Italian children with CD were enrolled in a 15-month, randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled multicenter trial. Participants were randomized in two groups following either A-B treatment (6 months of diet "A", 3 months of standard GFD, 6 months of diet "B"), or B-A treatment (6 months of diet "B", 3 months of standard GFD, 6 months of diet "A"). A and B diets included gluten-free (GF) products (flour, pasta, biscuits, cakes and crisp toasts) with either purified oats or placebo. Clinical data (Gastrointestinal Symptoms Rate Scale [GSRS] score) and intestinal permeability tests (IPT), were measured through the study period. Although the study is still blinded, no significant differences were found in GSRS score or the urinary lactulose/mannitol (L/M) ratio between the two groups after 6 months of treatment. These preliminary results suggest that the addition of non-contaminated oats from selected varieties in the treatment of children with CD does not determine changes in intestinal permeability and gastrointestinal symptoms.},

Diagnosis of cystic fibrosis was made on the basis of changes in pulmonogram and three positive sweat tests with the malabsorption managed. Celiac disease was demonstrated through immunological tests (serological test of anti-transglutaminase antibodies of IgA class), histological tests (altered duodenal mucosa) and the therapeutic effect of a gluten-free diet. This case is the first ever reported case of a child with concomitant cystic fibrosis and celiac disease in Bulgaria. The case suggests the need for targeted screening for celiac disease in children with cystic fibrosis.},

Although ipilimumab-induced enterocolitis is a well-reported complication, there have been no reported cases of celiac disease with ipilimumab therapy, to our knowledge. We suspect that ipilimumab may have amplified the symptomatic presentation of previously unrecognized celiac disease or perhaps even triggered the disease itself. With ipilimumab being used more commonly in the treatment of melanoma and prostate cancer, we believe that physicians should be aware of this potential adverse outcome when evaluating a patient who experiences persistent diarrhea during or after ipilimumab treatment.},

   abstract = {There has been increasing recognition in the medical community and the general public of the widespread prevalence of gluten sensitivity. Celiac disease (CD) was initially believed to be the sole source of this phenomenon. Signs and symptoms indicative of nonceliac gluten sensitivity (NCGS), in which classical serum and intestinal findings of CD may be absent, have been frequently reported of late. Clinical manifestations in patients with NCGS are characteristically triggered by gluten and are ameliorated or resolved within days to weeks of commencing a gluten-free diet. Emerging scientific literature contains several reports linking gluten sensitivity states with neuropsychiatric manifestations including autism, schizophrenia, and ataxia. A clinical review of gluten sensitivity is presented alongside a case illustrating the life-changing difference achieved by gluten elimination in a patient with a longstanding history of auditory and visual hallucinations. Physicians in clinical practice should routinely consider sensitivity issues as an etiological determinant of otherwise inexplicable symptoms. Pathophysiologic mechanisms to explain the multisystem symptomatology with gluten sensitivity are considered.},

We aimed to assess the rate of mucosal healing and indications for repeat small bowel (SB) biopsy in children with CD. METHODS: We retrospectively reviewed records of children (ages 1-18 years) with CD who underwent a second SB biopsy. All of the children were seen at Mayo Clinic (Rochester, MN) from January 1997 through June 2013. RESULTS: Forty children were identified (14 boys); average age at diagnosis was 8.5 years. Indications for second SB biopsy were abdominal pain (n = 20), diarrhea (n = 7), constipation (n = 5), non-celiac-related concern (n = 2), follow-up (n = 5), and persistent serology (n = 1). Average time between biopsies was 24 months (range 4-120 months). Histology on the second biopsy showed complete healing (n = 25), intraepithelial lymphocytes (n = 9), and persistent villous atrophy (n = 6). Of these, 3 patients had partial villous atrophy and 3 had with complete villous atrophy. Persistent villous atrophy was observed in 2 of 20 patients with abdominal pain and 1 of 7 with diarrhea. All of the patients with persistent constipation (n = 5) had complete resolution. CONCLUSIONS: Mucosal healing in children with CD may not be complete as previously assumed. Abdominal pain was the most common indication for repeating the SB biopsy. Persistence of abdominal pain, diarrhea, and constipation was poorly associated with persistence of mucosal injury.},

In patients with Del22 gastrointestinal (GI) alterations, including feeding disorders and congenital abnormalities have been often reported, mostly in the first year of life. MATERIAL AND METHODS. Aim of this monocentric study is to better define the GI involvement in a cohort of 26 patients affected with Del22 syndrome. Anamnestic information was retrospectively collected for each patient. Weight and height parameters at the time of the screening were recorded. Plasma levels of hemoglobin, iron, ferritin, albumin, total protein, calcium, phosphorus, transaminase levels, antigliadin (AGA) IgA and IgG, and antitissue transglutaminase (anti-TGase) titers were measured. RESULTS. A GI involvement was identified in the 58% of patients. The prominent problems were abdominal pain, vomiting, gastroesophageal reflux and chronic constipation. Weight deficiency, short stature and failure to thrive were reported in 54, 42, and 30% of the patients, respectively. The evidence of sideropenic anemia, in keeping with hypoproteinemia, impaired acid steatocrit or cellobiose/mannitol test suggested an abnormal intestinal permeability. In this cohort, a high prevalence of AGA IgA and IgG positivity was observed. Celiac disease (CD) was suspected in three patients, and in one of them confirmed by histology. In this patient, a long-lasting gluten-free diet failed to restore the intestinal architecture. CONCLUSIONS. In conclusion, GI involvement is a very common feature in Del22 patients. A better characterization of GI involvement would be very useful to improve the management of these patients.},

   abstract = {BACKGROUND: In patients with treated celiac disease (CD), the ingestion of gluten traces contained in gluten-free (GF) wheat substitutes (eg, GF bread, flour, and pasta) could cause persisting intestinal mucosal damage. OBJECTIVE: The objective was to evaluate the proportion of CD patients at risk of mucosal damage due to the consumption of GF products in 4 European countries (Italy, Spain, Germany, and Norway). DESIGN: A probabilistic modeling approach was used to assess the risk of gluten intake at the population level. The input variables were 1) consumption of GF products, 2) concentration of gluten traces in GF products determined by the sandwich R5 ELISA method, and 3) the gluten threshold for mucosal damage of 10 to 50 mg/d. Different population and product availability scenarios were examined for risk assessment. RESULTS: The gluten content of 205 commercially available GF products ranged between <5 and 27.8 mg/kg. Overall, 99.5% of the analyzed samples had a gluten concentration <20 mg/kg. Most (94%) had a gluten concentration below the limit of quantification (5 mg/kg). The mean percentage of the CD European population at risk of mucosal damage resulting from consumption of GF products ranged between 0.01 (Germany) and 0.15 (Italy) and remained very low, even in the worst-case scenario (<1%). CONCLUSIONS: The adoption of a single gluten threshold (20 mg/kg) for gluten contamination is suggested. GF products in Europe constitute a very safe option for patients with CD. The dietary follow-up of CD patients should focus on other potential sources of gluten contamination.},

   abstract = {Wheat flour cannot be tolerated by those who suffer allergies to gluten. Human pathologies associated with grain proteins have increased worldwide in recent years, and the only effective treatment available is a lifelong gluten-free diet, which is complicated to follow and detrimental to gut health. This manuscript describes the development of wheat bread potentially suitable for celiac patients and other gluten-intolerant individuals. We have made bread using wheat flour with very low content of the specific gluten proteins (near gliadin-free) that are the causal agents for pathologies such as celiac disease. Loaves were compared with normal wheat breads and rice bread. Organoleptic, nutritional, and immunotoxic properties were studied. The reduced-gliadin breads showed baking and sensory properties, and overall acceptance, similar to those of normal flour, but with up to 97% lower gliadin content. Moreover, the low-gliadin flour has improved nutritional properties since its lysine content is significantly higher than that of normal flour. Conservative estimates indicate that celiac patients could safely consume 67 grams of bread per day that is made with low-gliadin flour. However, additional studies, such as feeding trials with gluten-intolerant patients, are still needed in order to determine whether or not the product can be consumed by the general celiac population, as well as the actual tolerated amount that can be safely ingested. The results presented here offer a major opportunity to improve the quality of life for millions of sufferers of gluten intolerance throughout the world.},

   abstract = {Celiac disease is a food-sensitive enteropathy triggered by the ingestion of wheat gluten proteins and related proteins from barley, rye, and some varieties of oat. There are no interventional therapies and the only solution is a lifelong gluten-free diet. The down-regulation of gliadins by RNAi provides wheat lines with all the gliadin fractions strongly down-regulated (low-gliadin). The technological properties of doughs prepared from the low-gliadin lines indicated a general weakening effect, although some of the lines displayed similar properties to that of the wild-type lines. In contrast, the stability was increased significantly in some of the transgenic lines, indicating better tolerance to over-mixing. Results reported here are the first analyses of the mixing and bread-making quality of the wheat lines with all gliadin fractions strongly down-regulated. Flour from these lines may be an important breakthrough in the development of new products for the celiac community. These lines might be used directly or blended with other non-toxic cereals, as raw material for developing food products that can be safely tolerated by CD patients and others with gluten intolerance or gluten sensitivity, incrementing the range of available food products and enhancing their diet.},

   abstract = {BACKGROUND AND OBJECTIVES: alcohol use disorders are associated with a greater incidence of certain comorbidities in patients with celiac disease. Currently there is no available information about the impact that these disorders may have on length of hospital stays, overexpenditures during hospital stays, and excess mortality in these patients. METHODS: a case-control study was conducted with a selection of patients 18 years and older hospitalized during 2008-2010 in 87 hospitals in Spain. Estimations of excess length of stays, costs, and attributable mortality were calculated using a multivariate analysis of covariance, which included age, gender, hospital group, alcohol use disorders, tobacco related disease and 30 other comorbidities. RESULTS: patients who had both celiac disease and alcohol use disorders had an increased length of hospital stay, an average of 3.1 days longer in women, and 1.7 days longer in men. Excess costs per stay ranged from 838.7 euros in female patients, to 389.1 euros in male patients. Excess attributable mortality was 15.1 % in women, 12.2 % in men. CONCLUSIONS: apart from a gluten-free diet and other medical measures, the prevention of alcohol abuse is indicated in these patients. Patients hospitalized who present these disorders should receive specialized attention after leaving the hospital. Early detection and treatment should be used to prevent the appearance of organic lesions and should not be solely focused on male patients.},

   abstract = {BACKGROUND: Although pasta is one of the most widely demanded products among gluten-intolerant people, few studies have focused on the sensory analysis and acceptability of these products. Spaghetti was made from Andean corn (Zea mays var. amylacea), capia and cully varieties from northern Argentina, and the flash profile technique was applied by semi-trained assessors to compare the sensory profile of this type of spaghetti with those made with rice and wheat flours. Acceptability of capia corn spaghetti was studied in celiac and non-celiac consumer groups using a 9-point hedonic scale and check-all-that-apply (CATA) questions. RESULTS: Two Andean corn spaghetti samples were described by assessors as rough, odd-smelling and odd-tasting. These terms were also used by non-celiac consumers to describe the capia corn spaghetti sample, which explained its low acceptability scores. However, celiac consumers assigned high acceptability scores to the same sample and described it as tasty, smooth, tender, novel, having a pleasant flavor and good quality, and as a product that can be consumed every day and by the whole family. CONCLUSIONS: The results of this study suggest that Andean corn flours are a suitable and acceptable product for celiac consumers and can be used in the production of spaghetti for celiac consumers but should be reformulated for non-celiac consumers.},

   abstract = {Celiac disease (CD) is a small intestinal enteropathy, triggered in susceptible individuals by the ingestion of dietary gluten. Dendritic cells (DC) are instrumental in the generation and regulation of immune responses and oversee intestinal immune homeostasis promoting and maintaining oral tolerance to food antigens. The aim of this study was to monitor the effect of peptic-tryptic digest of gliadin (PT-gliadin) on the maturation of human monocyte-derived DC and the impact of pDAV and pRPQ decapeptides in the modulation of PT-gliadin-induced phenotypic and functional DC maturation. Immature DC (iDC) were challenged in vitro with PT-gliadin. In some experiments iDC were pre-treated with pDAV or pRPQ and after 2h PT-gliadin was added to the cultures. We found that PT-gliadin up-regulates the expression of the maturation markers HLA-DR, CD83, CD80 and CD86. The functional consequence of PT-gliadin treatment of iDC is a significant increase in IL-12, TNF-alpha production as well as in their T cell stimulatory capacity. On the contrary, the digest of zein had no effect on DC maturation. Interestingly, we found that pre-treatment of iDC with pDAV or pRPQ decapeptides significantly prevents the functional maturation of DC induced by PT-gliadin. On the other hand, pDAV and pRPQ did not revert the PT-gliadin-induced phenotypic maturation of DC. Here we report, for the first time, that naturally occurring peptides are able to prevent the gliadin-dependent DC maturation. This finding could have implication for CD, raising the perspective of a potential therapeutic strategy alternative to a gluten free diet.},

   abstract = {Sourdough fermentation is one of the oldest food biotechnologies, which has been studied and recently rediscovered for its effect on the sensory, structural, nutritional and shelf life properties of leavened baked goods. Acidification, proteolysis and activation of a number of enzymes as well as the synthesis of microbial metabolites cause several changes during sourdough fermentation, which affect the dough and baked good matrix, and influence the nutritional/functional quality. Currently, the literature is particularly rich of results, which show how the sourdough fermentation may affect the functional features of leavened baked goods. In the form of pre-treating raw materials, fermentation through sourdough may stabilize or to increase the functional value of bran fractions and wheat germ. Sourdough fermentation may decrease the glycaemic response of baked goods, improve the properties and bioavailability of dietary fibre complex and phytochemicals, and may increase the uptake of minerals. Microbial metabolism during sourdough fermentation may also produce new nutritionally active compounds, such as peptides and amino acid derivatives (e.g., gamma-amino butyric acid) with various functionalities, and potentially prebiotic exo-polysaccharides. The wheat flour digested via fungal proteases and selected sourdough lactobacilli has been demonstrated to be probably safe for celiac patients.},

   abstract = {CONTEXT: The ingestion of gluten is responsible for the symptoms of Celiac disease, but other environmental factors can also influence. Strains of the Bifidobacterium genus have been shown to afford protection against the inflammatory response and mucosal damage caused by gliadin peptides in vitro. OBJECTIVES: This study was designed to compare the concentration of fecal bifidobacteria and pH of patients with celiac disease on gluten-free diet and control subjects in order to identify if the imbalance on fecal microbiota still remain during the treatment of celiac disease and identify the necessity of dietary supplementation with pre- or probiotics. METHODS: It was analyzed the feces of 42 healthy subjects and 14 celiac patients. The bifidobacteria count in feces was done in selective medium BIM-25. Microscopic analysis of the colonies was performed by Gram stain. The identification of the genus Bifidobacterium was performed by determination of fructose-6-phosphate phosphoketolase. Fecal pH was measured using a pH meter. RESULTS: The concentration of bifidobacteria per gram of feces was significantly higher in healthy subjects (controls) (1.5 +/- 0.63 x108 CFU/g) when compared to celiac patients (2.5 +/- 1.5 x107 CFU/g). The fecal pH was not different between celiac patients (7.19 +/- 0.521) and controls (7.18 +/- 0.522). CONCLUSIONS: These results suggest that with lower levels of bifidobacteria, celiac patients have an imbalance in the intestinal microbiota, regardless of pH, even while on a gluten-free diet. This fact could favor the pathological process of the disorder.},

   abstract = {OBJECTIVE: To assess the prevalence of and explanations for wheat avoidance, including reported symptoms, diagnoses and information sources influencing the decision to avoid wheat, and to investigate potential psychological predictors of this behaviour. DESIGN: Cross-sectional population survey. SETTING: The study was conducted in Australia, using a nationwide postal omnibus survey. SUBJECTS: Adults aged 18 years and over (n 1184; 52.9% female) selected at random from the Australian Electoral Roll. RESULTS: With cases of stated and suspected coeliac disease (1.2%) excluded, 7.3% of the sample reported adverse physiological effects, predominantly gastrointestinal, that they associated with wheat consumption. Few among this group (5.7%) claimed a formally diagnosed intolerance or allergy requiring avoidance of wheat-based foods. Symptomatic wheat avoidance was highly correlated with dairy avoidance and predicted by gender (female), lesser receptiveness to conventional medicine and greater receptiveness to complementary medicine, but not by neuroticism, reasoning style or tendency to worry about illness. CONCLUSIONS: The data indicate that many adult Australians are consciously avoiding consumption of wheat foods, predominantly without any formal diagnosis. Reported symptoms suggest a physiological but not allergenic basis to this behaviour. Questions to be answered concern whether symptoms are attributed correctly to wheat, the agents (wheat components, dietary factors or additives) and physiological mechanism(s) involved, the nutritional adequacy of avoiders' diets, and the clinical and psychosocial processes that lead a substantial number of adults to avoid consuming wheat (or any other dietary factor) apparently independently of a medical diagnosis.},

RESEARCH DESIGN: Twenty-four children with type 1 diabetes and biopsy-proven CD, on a gluten-free diet for at least 1 yr, were recruited from a single paediatric diabetes clinic alongside 55 children with type 1 diabetes but without CD matched for age, gender, duration of diabetes, and glycaemic control. RESULTS: Despite comparable diabetes exposure, glycaemic control and nutritional status, children with type 1 diabetes and CD had a lower urinary albumin creatinine ratio than in diabetic subjects without CD (0.9 +/- 0.3 mg/mmol vs. 1.6 +/- 0.3 mg/mmol; p = 0.01). Participants with CD also showed slower progression in albuminuria over 5-yr of follow-up while a small but significant increase was observed in the children with diabetes alone (1.6 +/- 0.3 mg/mmol; follow-up 2.4 +/- 0.5 mg/mmol; p = 0.02). CONCLUSIONS: As urinary albumin excretion is continuously associated with the risk of kidney disease, it is possible to speculate that CD or its management confers a degree of renoprotection. Larger studies are required to test this hypothesis.},

   abstract = {BACKGROUND & AIMS: In most cases celiac disease (CD) is successfully treated with a gluten-free diet (GFD). However, some patients become refractory to the GFD. Refractory CD (RCD) patients have an increased risk for developing enteropathy associated T-cell lymphoma and early diagnosis is therefore of importance. Currently, RCD diagnosis relies on endoscopy and adequate serological markers are lacking. Antibodies against glycoprotein-2 (GP2A) were described in Crohn's disease (CrD) and active CD but not in ulcerative colitis (UC), suggesting this is a specific marker for small intestinal lesions. METHODS: Sera obtained from patients visiting our outpatient clinic for routine serological tests for diagnosis and/or follow-up of inflammatory bowel disease (n=78), active CD (n=45), GFD (n=34) and RCD (n=15) were analysed for GP2A titres. RESULTS: Increased GP2A-IgA levels in CrD and active CD as compared to controls (p<0.001) and lack thereof in UC was confirmed. However, we could not confirm the association with small bowel localization within the CrD patient group. Within CD patients, we demonstrated a significant decrease of GP2A-IgA titres upon a GFD and increased levels in RCD patients as compared to patients on a GFD. Although GP2A-IgA was not associated with the degree of villous atrophy, GP2A-IgA levels were able to distinguish RCD patients from GFD patients (ROC AUC=0.79, p=0.002). CONCLUSION: Follow-up of GP2A-IgA titres in CD patients on a GFD may help to identify patients at risk for developing RCD.},

   abstract = {A small fraction of coeliac disease (CD) patients have persistent villous atrophy despite strict adherence to a gluten-free diet. Some of these refractory CD (RCD) patients develop a clonal expansion of lymphocytes with an aberrant phenotype, referred to as RCD type II (RCDII). Pathogenesis of active CD (ACD) has been shown to be related to gluten-specific immunity whereas the disease is no longer gluten driven in RCD. We therefore hypothesized that the immune response is differentially regulated by cytokines in ACD versus RCDII and investigated mucosal cytokine release after polyclonal stimulation of isolated mucosal lymphocytes. Secretion of the T(H)2 cytokine IL-13 was significantly higher in lamina propria leukocytes (LPLs) isolated from RCDII patients as compared to LPL from ACD patients (P = 0.05). In patients successfully treated with a gluten-free diet LPL-derived IL-13 production was also higher as compared to ACD patients (P = 0.02). IL-13 secretion correlated with other T(H)2 as well as T(H)1 cytokines but not with IL-10 secretion. Overall, the cytokine production pattern of LPL in RCDII showed more similarities with LPL isolated from GFD patients than from ACD patients. Our data suggest that different immunological processes are involved in RCDII and ACD with a potential role for IL-13.},

   abstract = {Triggered by the ingestion of gluten in genetically predisposed individuals, celiac disease is the most common genetically based food intolerance in the world, with a prevalence among approximately 1% of the general population. This enteropathy may appear at any age and is characterized by a wide variety of clinical signs and symptoms that go well beyond the gastrointestinal tract. In young children, gastrointestinal presentations are common and include chronic diarrhea, failure to thrive, and abdominal distention; however, extraintestinal manifestations are becoming increasingly more common. They include numerous conditions such as dermatitis herpetiformis, anemia, dental enamel hypoplasia, recurrent oral aphthae, short stature, osteoporosis, arthritis, neurologic problems, unexplained elevation of transaminase levels, and female infertility. Therefore, diagnosing celiac disease requires a high degree of suspicion, followed by correct screening and a confirmatory test with an intestinal biopsy. After diagnosis, a strict gluten-free diet must be followed, which in most cases will bring a marked improvement of symptoms. However, there are important compliance and quality-of-life problems, especially in adolescents.},

   abstract = {OBJECTIVE: Although it is well known that celiac disease (CD) is associated with neurologic disorders, association with psychiatric problems is not well defined. In this report, we aimed to detect CD prevalence in patients with attention-deficit hyperactivity disorder (ADHD). METHODS: A total of 362 patients between the ages 5 and 15 years with the diagnosis of ADHD according to the Diagnostic and Statistical Manual of Mental Disorders, Fourth Edition, Text Revision (DSM-IV-TR) diagnostic criteria and 390 sex- and age-matched healthy children were included in the present study. Serum levels of tissue transglutaminase (tTg) immunoglobulin (Ig) A and IgG were studied in both groups. Serum IgA levels were also studied in patients with positive tTG IgG for the exclusion of selective IgA deficiency. Endoscopic duodenal biopsy was provided in seropositive patients, whose parents approved the procedure. Biopsy samples were evaluated according to Marsh-Oberhuber classification. RESULTS: tTg IgA was positive in 4 patients with ADHD (1.1%). Endoscopic duodenal biopsy was suggestive of CD in one of them (0.27%). tTg IgA was positive in 3 of control group patients (0.8%). Duodenal biopsy of the only patient from control group, who underwent upper gastrointestinal endoscopy, revealed normal intestinal mucosa. CONCLUSIONS: The seropositivity rates for CD were found similar in ADHD and control groups. Thus, neither routine screening for CD nor empirical recommendation of gluten-free diet seems necessary in children with ADHD.},

   abstract = {OBJECTIVES: The previous finding of an immunologic response primarily directed against transglutaminase (TG)6 in patients with gluten ataxia (GA) led us to investigate the role of TG6 antibodies in diagnosing GA. METHODS: This was a prospective cohort study. We recruited patients from the ataxia, gluten/neurology, celiac disease (CD), and movement disorder clinics based at Royal Hallamshire Hospital (Sheffield, UK) and the CD clinic, Tampere University Hospital (Tampere, Finland). The groups included patients with idiopathic sporadic ataxia, GA, and CD, and neurology and healthy controls. All were tested for TG6 antibodies. Duodenal biopsies were performed in patients with positive serology. In addition, biopsies from 15 consecutive patients with idiopathic sporadic ataxia and negative serology for gluten-related disorders were analyzed for immunoglobulin A deposits against TG. RESULTS: The prevalence of TG6 antibodies was 21 of 65 (32%) in idiopathic sporadic ataxia, 35 of 48 (73%) in GA, 16 of 50 (32%) in CD, 4 of 82 (5%) in neurology controls, and 2 of 57 (4%) in healthy controls. Forty-two percent of patients with GA had enteropathy as did 51% of patients with ataxia and TG6 antibodies. Five of 15 consecutive patients with idiopathic sporadic ataxia had immunoglobulin A deposits against TG2, 4 of which subsequently tested positive for TG6 antibodies. After 1 year of gluten-free diet, TG6 antibody titers were significantly reduced or undetectable. CONCLUSIONS: Antibodies against TG6 are gluten-dependent and appear to be a sensitive and specific marker of GA.},

   abstract = {At an incidence of 1:500, celiac disease (formerly sprue) is an important differential diagnosis in patients with malabsorption, abdominal discomfort, diarrhea and food intolerances. Celiac disease can induce a broad spectrum of both gastrointestinal and extraintestinal symptoms, e.g. dermatitis herpetiformis (Duhring's disease). A variety of oligo- and asymptomatic courses (e.g. anemia, osteoporosis, depression) through to refractory collagenic celiac disease are seen. In HLA-DQ2 and -8 predisposed individuals, celiac disease is provoked by contact with wheat gliadin fractions through a predominantly Th1 immune response and an accompanying Th2 response, which can eventually lead to villous atrophy. Using appropriate serological tests (IgA antibodies against tissue-transglutaminase, endomysium and deamidated gliadin peptides) under sufficient gluten ingestion, the diagnosis can be made more reliably today than previously. The same IgG-based serological tests should be used in the case of IgA deficiency. Diagnosis can either be made in children and adolescents with anti-transglutaminase titers exceeding ten times the standard for two of the above-mentioned serological markers and HLA conformity or it is made by endoscopy and histological Marsh classification in adults and in cases of inconclusive serology. If clinically tolerated, gluten challenges are indicated in patients that already have reduced gluten intake, in borderline serological results, discordance between serological and histological results or in suspected food allergy. The diagnosis of celiac disease needs to be definitive and robust before establishing a gluten-free diet, since lifelong abstention from gluten (gliadin < 20 mg/kg foodstuffs), cereal products (wheat, rye, barley and spelt) as well as from preparations and beverages containing gluten, is necessary. With effective elimination of gluten, the prognosis regarding complete resolution of small bowel inflammation is good. Refractory courses are seen only in rare cases, accompanied by enteropathy-associated T-cell lymphoma.},

   abstract = {OBJECTIVE: To assess the prevalence of celiac disease in adult patients with type 1 diabetes mellitus (T1DM). Influence the new started treatment of celiac disease on glycemic control and body mass index (BMI) of the patients. Prevail the anti-transglutaminase antibody (atTG) positivity one year after commencement of the therapy. METHODS: A retrospective assessment of celiac disease targeted screening in 465 adult T1DM patients at Diabetes Center, 1st Medical Department, University Hospital in Pilsen (80 % of all T1DM patients) from 1. 1. 2007 until 1. 7. 2011. Enterobiopsy was indicated in case of atTG-A (or atTG-G) positivity. In patients with newly started gluten-free diet, HbA1c and BMI within a year after diagnosis of celiac disease were compared to a year period six months after treatment commencement (3-4 visits), atTG was evaluated one year after treatment beginning. Paired T-test was used for statistical evaluation. RESULTS: The prevalence of all forms of celiac disease in the studied group was 10.5 %. Celiac disease diagnosed in childhood was found in 1.1 % patients (5/465). Positivity of atTG was newly observed in 9.5 % (44/465) patients. Three patients with atTG > 300 kIU/l refused the enterobiopsy examination. Celiac disease is highly plausible. The influence of gluten-free diet on BMI and HbA1c could not be evaluated due to the lack of compliance. 22 patients had a potential form of celiac disease (negative histology). Positive enterobiopsy was found in 19 patients (4.1 %). Another 3 patients had to be excluded from the subgroup of 22 patients (newly indicated gluten-free diet) as the HbA1c values and BMI were affected by the primary diagnosis of T1DM. Subgroup characteristics: 9 women and 7 men, mean age 38 +/- 12 years, diabetes duration 21 +/- 13 years, celiac disease diagnosed 20.7 +/- 13 years since first diagnosis of T1DM. No statistically significant change in HbA1c (67 +/- 11.4 vs 69 +/- 13.9 mmol/mol) was observed in the studied period, however and a significant change of BMI from 25.4 +/- 4.2 to 25.9 +/- 4.3 (p < 0.01) was found. The atTG positivity prevailed in 47 % (9/19) of patients after one year. CONCLUSION: A total prevalence of the celiac disease in the group of adult T1DM patients was 10.5 %. No significant change in HbA1c occurred following treatment, a significant change of BMI was observed. The atTG positivity prevailed in 47 % of patients after one year.},

Duodenal biopsies showed villous atrophy and 50 intraepithelial lymphocytes per 100 enterocytes, but antibody testing for celiac disease was negative. TREATMENT AND COURSE: The diarrhea resolved within 2 weeks after withdrawing olmesartan, which she had received for hypertension for 5 years, without a gluten-free diet. 6 months later the histological abnormalities in the duodenum regressed markedly. A diagnosis of sprue-like enteropathy associated with olmesartan was made. CONCLUSION: The syndrome is probably rare and was first described in 2012. It should be suspected in patients on olmesartan treatment who have clinical and histological findings, but not serological markers of celiac disease.},

This study aimed to determine the rates of intentional and inadvertent non-adherence in adult coeliac disease and to examine the factors associated with both. A self-completion questionnaire was mailed to adult coeliac patients identified from the computer records of 31 family practices within the North East of England. We received 287 responses after one reminder. Intentional gluten consumption was reported by 115 (40%) of respondents. 155 (54%) had made at least one known mistaken lapse over the same period and 82 (29%) reported neither intentional nor mistaken gluten consumption. Using logistic regression analysis, low self-efficacy, perceptions of tolerance to gluten and intention were found to be independently predictive of intentional gluten consumption. A statistical model predicted 71.8% of cases reporting intentional lapses. Intentional non-adherence to the GFD was found to be common but not as frequent as inadvertent lapses. Distinguishing the factors influencing both intentional and inadvertent non-adherence is useful in understanding dietary self-management in coeliac disease.},

METHODS: Healthy normal-weight subjects (11 subjects in the 100-kcal test and 10 subjects in the 300-kcal test) participated in two trials: a rapid-eating trial and a slow-eating trial. The meal duration and the number of chews were recorded. DIT was calculated from oxygen uptake and body mass, and splanchnic BF was calculated from the diameters of and blood velocities in the celiac artery and superior mesenteric artery, which were recorded until 90 min after consuming the food samples. RESULTS: For the 100-kcal and 300-kcal food samples, DIT and postprandial splanchnic BF in both the celiac artery and superior mesenteric artery were significantly larger in the slow-eating trial than in the rapid-eating trial. There were significant correlations among meal duration, the number of chews, DIT, and postprandial splanchnic BF, with the exception of the relationship between DIT and splanchnic BF in the 300-kcal trial. CONCLUSIONS: These results suggest that fewer chews and/or shorter meal duration decreases DIT and the postprandial splanchnic BF, and that the increased DIT is at least partially due to the postprandial splanchnic circulation.},

   abstract = {Celiac disease is an intestinal autoimmune disease driven by dietary gluten and gluten-specific CD4(+) T-cell responses. In celiac patients on a gluten-free diet, exposure to gluten induces the appearance of gluten-specific CD4(+) T cells with gut-homing potential in the peripheral blood. Here we show that gluten exposure also induces the appearance of activated, gut-homing CD8(+) alphabeta and gammadelta T cells in the peripheral blood. Single-cell T-cell receptor sequence analysis indicates that both of these cell populations have highly focused T-cell receptor repertoires, indicating that their induction is antigen-driven. These results reveal a previously unappreciated role of antigen in the induction of CD8(+) alphabeta and gammadelta T cells in celiac disease and demonstrate a coordinated response by all three of the major types of T cells. More broadly, these responses may parallel adaptive immune responses to viral pathogens and other systemic autoimmune diseases.},

METHODS: 20 male Wistar rats were divided into normal control and high-fat supplement (OB) groups (n= 10 for each group). The rats were sacrificed after 10 weeks feeding and thoracic aorta was dissected and cut into four rings of 3 mm length, the response to acethylcholine (Ach) and sodium nitroprusside (SNP) were examined in organ bath containing Krebs-Henseleit (K-H) solution. In order to study the direct effects of Ex-4 on obese rats vascular function, the aortic rings obtained from obese rats were incubated with K-H solution (OB-C group, n = 10),or with K-H solution plus Ex-4 (OB-Ex group, n = 10). Aortic rings obtained from normal control group (n = 10) were incubated with K-H solution. After 1 hour of incubation, the aortic rings were precontracted with norepinephrine (0.1 gmol/L), then the rings were exposed to cumulative concentration of Ach (10(9)-10(4) mol/L) or sodium SNP (10(9)-10 6(-6) mol/L) to test the endothelial dependent (EDV) and independent vasodilation (EIV). The blood plasma of the rats was collected for biochemical test and celiac fat and body mass data were also obtained. RESULTS: The levels of serum triglyceride, total cholesterol, and free fat acid were elevated in the obese group compared with that of normal control group (P < 0.01). The ratio of celiac fat and body mass in the obese rats was also higher than the control (P < 0.05). Ach caused a concentration dependent vascular relaxation in all pre-constricted aortic rings. Compared to the control group, maximal endothelium dependent relaxation in the obese group was impaired (P < 0.05). The EIV values were comparable between two groups. Pre-incubation of obese rat's vessels with Ex-4 significantly increased cumulative relaxation to Ach (P < 0.05). SNP induced vessels relaxation had no statistical significance each groups (P > 0.05). CONCLUSION: Endothelial function was impaired in obese rats. Ex-4 directly mitigates impaired endothelial-dependent vasorelaxation of isolated obese rat's aortas.},

Milder abnormalities such as Marsh I-II (microscopic enteritis) and Marsh IIIa are not specific for coeliac disease and could occur in other conditions like those listed in the discussion.

Currently, a life-long gluten-free diet is the only available treatment for patients with celiac disease. However, adherence to gluten-free diet is difficult due to the widespread use of wheat-derived gluten in the food industry. Therefore, there is a pressing need for the development of novel non-dietary therapies. In this article, we will review several promising strategies focusing on reducing gluten immunogenicity or sequestering to gluten prevent its uptake by the intestinal epithelium. Other possible treatment strategies that will be reviewed include the suppression of the adaptive immune response, permeability modulation and the use of systemic T-cell or cytokine blockers.},

   abstract = {There has been recently increased interest in sorghum to substitute the gluten containing cereals in the diet of people suffering from celiac disease. The response surface methodology was used to determine the influence of malting parameters (degree of steeping, germination temperature and time) on sorghum (Sorghum bicolor (L.) Moench). Each parameter was varied at three levels. Malting attributes, considered important to produce high quality malt for the production of lactic acid fermented beverages, were analyzed. The optimized conditions were: degree of steeping 41%, germination temperature 27 after 7 days of germination. Under these conditions, the following values of the studied attributes can be obtained: alpha-amylase 139 U/g, beta-amylase 60 U/g, extract 83.8%, free amino nitrogen 117.8 mg/100 g, Kolbach index 26.6%, water-extractable arabinoxylan 0.3 g/L and vitamin B2 114.9 microg/L. Among the tested parameters, the germination time had the highest effect on malting attributes. Although the activity of amylolytic enzymes alpha- and beta-amylase were low, the value of extract was high and comparable to that of barley malt. The obtained results showed that sorghum malt is a promising raw material for the production of lactic acid fermented beverages.},

Certain immunogenic gluten domains are resistant to degradation by mammalian digestive enzymes. Enzymes with the ability to target such domains are potentially of clinical use. Of particular interest are gluten-degrading enzymes that would be naturally present in the human body, e.g. associated with resident microbial species. This manuscript describes a selective gluten agar approach and four enzyme activity assays, including a gliadin zymogram assay, designed for the selection and discovery of novel gluten-degrading microorganisms from human biological samples. Resident and harmless bacteria and/or their derived enzymes could potentially find novel applications in the treatment of celiac disease, in the form of a probiotic agent or as a dietary enzyme supplement.},

   abstract = {BACKGROUND: Maintaining a gluten-free diet (GFD) without an underlying diagnosis of celiac disease has enjoyed widespread acceptance in the Unites States. METHODS: We performed a cross-sectional study using a GFD questionnaire in 1647 patients with inflammatory bowel diseases (IBD) participating in the CCFA Partners longitudinal Internet-based cohort. RESULTS: A diagnosis of celiac disease and non-celiac gluten sensitivity were reported by 10 (0.6%) and 81 (4.9%) respondents, respectively. Three hundred fourteen (19.1%) participants reported having previously tried a GFD and 135 (8.2%) reported current use of GFD. Overall 65.6% of all patients, who attempted a GFD, described an improvement of their gastrointestinal symptoms and 38.3% reported fewer or less severe IBD flares. In patients currently attempting a GFD, excellent adherence was associated with significant improvement of fatigue (P < 0.03). CONCLUSIONS: In this large group of patients with IBD, a substantial number had attempted a GFD, of whom the majority had some form of improvement in gastrointestinal symptoms. Testing a GFD in clinical practice in patients with significant intestinal symptoms, which are not solely explained by the degree of intestinal inflammation, has the potential to be a safe and highly efficient therapeutic approach. Further prospective studies into mechanisms of gluten sensitivity in IBD are warranted.},

   abstract = {UNLABELLED: Celiac crisis is a life-threatening presentation of celiac disease which is described in the context of classic gastrointestinal (GI) symptoms of diarrhea, leading to dehydration and electrolyte imbalance. Neurologic manifestations are atypical symptoms of celiac crisis. To the best of our knowledge, there is no published report on seizure or encephalopathy as the presenting manifestation of celiac crisis. We describe a 2-year-old boy presenting with acute status epilepticus and lethargy. Prior to presentation, he had mild abdominal distention and intermittent diarrhea. Laboratory analysis revealed hyponatremia, anemia, hypocalcemia, transaminitis, and hyperglycemia. Electroencephalography revealed severe diffuse encephalopathy, and complete infectious work-up was negative. Initial brain magnetic resonance imaging was normal; however, repeat imaging showed osmotic demyelination syndrome. Given the history of GI symptoms and hyperglycemia, celiac serology was obtained revealing elevated tissue transglutaminase, and a diagnosis was confirmed by Marsh 3c lesions in the duodenum. He significantly improved with steroid therapy in addition to adequate nutrition, fluids, and initiation of a gluten-free diet. CONCLUSION: We report herein on the first case of celiac crisis presenting with status epilepticus and encephalopathy in the absence of profound GI symptoms. Our case suggests that celiac crisis should be considered in the differential of seizures and encephalopathy in children.},

   abstract = {Food allergy is defined as an adverse immune response towards food proteins or as a form of a food intolerance associated with a hypersensitive immune response. It should also be reproducible by a double-blind placebo-controlled food challenge. Many reported that food reactions are not allergic but are intolerances. Food allergy often presents to clinicians as a symptom complex. This review focuses on the clinical spectrum and manifestations of various forms of food allergies. According to clinical presentations and allergy testing, there are three types of food allergy: IgE mediated, mixed (IgE/Non-IgE), and non-IgE mediated (cellular, delayed type hypersensitivity). Recent advances in food allergy in early childhood have highlighted increasing recognition of a spectrum of delayed-onset non-IgE-mediated manifestation of food allergy. Common presentations of food allergy in infancy including atopic eczema, infantile colic, and gastroesophageal reflux. These clinical observations are frequently associated with food hypersensitivity and respond to dietary elimination. Non-IgE-mediated food allergy includes a wide range of diseases, from atopic dermatitis to food protein-induced enterocolitis and from eosinophilic esophagitis to celiac disease. The most common food allergies in children include milk, egg, soy, wheat, peanut, treenut, fish, and shellfish. Milk and egg allergies are usually outgrown, but peanut and treenut allergy tends to persist. The prevalence of food allergy in infancy is increasing and may affect up to 15-20 % of infants. The alarming rate of increase calls for a public health approach in the prevention and treatment of food allergy in children.},

Osteoporosis or osteopenia are typically present in untreated adult symptomatic celiac disease with an overt malabsorption syndrome, but is found in about 50 % in suboptimally treated celiac patients, subclinical patients and asymptomatic adult celiac patients, too. Etiology of pathologic bone alteration in celiac disease is multifactorial; however, two main mechanisms are involved: intestinal malabsorption and chronic inflammation. The evaluation of bone mineral metabolism (total calcium/albumin, 25-OH vitamin D3 and parathormone levels in serum) and bone mineral density (densitometry) is recommended in the clinical management of celiac patients. Many studies have demonstrated that bone mineral density values in adults show a good improvement in the first period after the institution of gluten-free diet, the improvement is then unsatisfactory and treatment with a mineral-active drug should probably be considered.},

However, the levels of cCK-18 (P<0.01) and I-FABP (P<0.01) in CLD-GFD were higher when compared with controls. Interestingly, elevated levels of cCK-18 and I-FABP were found in T2D and T1D (P<0.001), and T1D/INS (P<0.01, P<0.001). Twenty-two out of 43 CLD patients were seropositive for cCK-18, 19/43 for I-FABP and 11/43 for sCD14; 9/30 of T2D patients were positive for cCK-18 and 5/20 of T1D/INS for sCD14, while in controls only 3/41 were positive for cCK-18, 3/41 for I-FABP and 1/41 for sCD14. We documented for the first time seropositivity for sCD14 in CLD and potential usefulness of serum cCK-18 and I-FABP as markers of gut damage in CLD, CLD-GFD, and diabetes.},

This study aimed to examine if the presence of autoantibodies in newly diagnosed T1DM differs between patients with celiac disease and those with transient celiac serology. METHODS: Forty children were identified who had been diagnosed with T1DM between 2003 and 2009 and who had elevated serum IgA-TTG antibody levels at diagnosis. Blood samples were collected for measurement of insulin (IA-2A) antibodies, islet cell antigen (ICA) antibodies, glutamic acid decarboxylase (GAD) antibodies, thyroglobulin (TgAb) antibodies, and thyroid peroxidase (TPO) antibodies. Children diagnosed with celiac disease (CD; group 1, n=23) and children in whom TTG antibody levels spontaneously normalized over time (group 2, n=17) were compared. RESULTS: No significant differences in positivity rates between groups 1 and 2 were found for any of the autoantibodies tested. The respective findings were as follows: IA-2A 50% and 47.1% (p=0.855); ICA 77.3% and 76.5% (p=0.953); GAD 27.3% and 52.9% (p=0.102). Thyroid antibodies were found positive in a limited number of patients: TgAb 4.5% and 11.8%; TPO 4.5% and 11.8%. In addition, antibody titer levels did not differ significantly for all autoantibodies. Difference in occurrence of clinical or subclinical thyroid disease did not reach significance (4.3% vs. 29.4%; p=0.07). Age was positively correlated with the presence of thyroglobulin and thyroid peroxidase antibodies, and negatively correlated with the presence of insulin antibody. CONCLUSION: Neither the number of concomitant autoantibodies nor their titers in newly diagnosed T1DM differed between patients with proven CD and those with transient TTG serology.},

   abstract = {INTRODUCTION: Celiac disease screening is commonly based on detection of IgA anti-tissue transglutaminase (TTGA). IgA deficiency (IgAD) is associated with celiac disease and must be identified to enable use of IgG based assays in these patients. The BioPlex(R) 2200 Celiac IgA and IgG kits use Luminex methodology to provide a method of simultaneously measuring TTG and deamidated gliadin peptide (DGP) antibody levels using a fully automated random access analyzer based on Luminex(R) technology. Separate kits are available for IgA (TTGA and DGPA) and IgG (TTGG and DGPG) isotypes. The IgA based kit includes a novel "IgA Verification Bead" (AVB) to check for IgAD (at <0.07g/L) to ensure that these patients are identified and tested using the IgG based kit. AIM: To perform a clinical and technical evaluation of the BioPlex(R) 2200 Celiac IgA and IgG kits. METHODS: 116 sera from 116 biopsy proven celiac disease patients were tested (58 new presentations on a gluten containing diet and 58 known TTGA positive patients on a gluten free diet but with suspected poor compliance). IgAD was present in 5 patients. Ability to flag IgAD sera was assessed by analysis of 29 IgAD and 200 non-IgAD sera. Specificity was calculated from 124 unselected consecutive disease control sera. RESULTS: Sensitivity and specificity for IgAD were 100%. Screening with TTGA and adding TTGG when IgAD was identified, gave clinical sensitivity of 100% for celiac disease. Specificity was 100% for TTGA and TTGG, and 98% and 97% for DGPA and DGPG respectively. CONCLUSION: Use of the BioPlex(R) 2200 Celiac IgA and Celiac IgG kits in a standard protocol gave excellent sensitivity and specificity with highly effective detection of IgAD, no false positive IgAD flags and little evidence of interference from high IgA levels. The ability to detect IgAD without pre-screening with a separate IgA assay should have a significant beneficial impact on laboratory workflow by identifying those patients requiring IgG based testing and IgA measurement to confirm IgAD.},

   abstract = {BACKGROUND: Patients with persistent symptoms and/or villous atrophy despite strict adherence to a gluten-free diet (GFD) have non-responsive celiac disease (NRCD). A subset of these patients has refractory celiac disease (RCD), yet some NRCD patients may simply be reacting to gluten cross-contamination. Here we describe the effects of a 3-6 month diet of whole, unprocessed foods, termed the Gluten Contamination Elimination Diet (GCED), on NRCD. We aim to demonstrate that this diet reclassifies the majority of patients thought to have RCD type 1 (RCD1). METHODS: We reviewed the records of all GFD-adherent NRCD patients cared for in our celiac center from 2005-2011 who were documented to have started the GCED. Response to the GCED was defined as being asymptomatic after the diet, with normal villous architecture on repeat biopsy, if performed. RESULTS: Prior to the GCED, all patients were interviewed by an experienced dietitian and no sources of hidden gluten ingestion were identified. 17 patients completed the GCED; 15 were female (88%). Median age at start of the GCED was 42 years (range 6-73). Fourteen patients (82%) responded to the GCED. Six patients met criteria for RCD prior to the GCED; 5 (83%) were asymptomatic after the GCED and no longer meet RCD criteria. Of the 14 patients who responded to the GCED, 11 (79%) successfully returned to a traditional GFD without resurgence of symptoms. CONCLUSIONS: The GCED may be an effective therapeutic option for GFD-adherent NRCD patients. Response to this diet identifies a subgroup of patients, previously classified as RCD1, that is not truly refractory to dietary treatment. Preventing an inaccurate diagnosis of RCD1 avoids immunotherapy. Most patients are able to return to a traditional GFD without return of symptoms.},

   abstract = {BACKGROUND/AIMS: Celiac disease is a chronic enteropathy caused by hypersensitivity to gluten. An increased prevalence of celiac disease has been found in children with diabetes mellitus type 1. The large differences in the frequency of celiac disease in different countries show a great regional variability. Our aim was to detect the prevalence of celiac disease in diabetes mellitus type 1 children among southern Iranians. MATERIALS AND METHODS: A prospective study was conducted on 83 diabetes mellitus type 1 children from the south of Iran. They were tested for the presence of anti-tissue transglutaminase immunoglobulin A antibody and total immunoglobulin A level. The patients testing immunoglobulin A anti-tissue transglutaminase-positive were offered small bowel biopsy. RESULTS: Eighty-three children with diabetes mellitus type 1 (49 females, 34 males) aged 10.38+/-4.7 years were enrolled. None of the patients was immunoglobulin A deficient. Twelve diabetic children had a high titer of anti-tissue transglutaminase immunoglobulin A (14.4%). In four patients, biopsy was in favor of celiac disease (4.8%). CONCLUSIONS: Our study showed that the prevalence of celiac disease in diabetes mellitus type 1 children in Iran is more than in America and Europe but similar to that observed in Turkey. The age of the patient and duration of disease had an effect on this prevalence, and more studies should be done to determine the effects of ethnic, genetic and environmental factors such as diet to identify the reasons for these differences.},

   abstract = {Coeliac disease (CD) affects about 1 % of the general population. Information concerning gluten intake in the general population is scarce. In particular, variation in gluten intake during the complementary feeding period may be an independent risk factor in CD pathogenesis. We determined the intake of gluten from wheat, barley, rye and oats in a cross-sectional National Danish Survey of Dietary Habits among Infants and Young Children (2006-2007). The study population comprised a random sample of 1743 children aged 6-36 months, recruited from the National Danish Civil Registry. The protein contents from wheat, rye, barley and oats were found in the National Danish Food Composition Table, and multiplied with the amounts in the recipes. The amounts of gluten were calculated as the amount of cereal protein x 0.80 for wheat and oats, x0.65 for rye and x0.50 for barley. Dietary intake was recorded daily for seven consecutive days in pre-coded food records supplemented with open-answer possibilities. Gluten intake increased with age (P < 0.0001). Oats were introduced first, rapidly outpaced by wheat, the intake of which continued to increase with age, whereas oats started to decrease at 12 months. Boys had a higher intake of energy (P </= 0.0001) and all types of gluten, except for barley (P </= 0.87). In 8-10-month-old (P < 0.0001) and 10-12-month-old (P = 0.007), but not in 6-8-month-old infants (P = 0.331), non-breast-fed infants had higher total gluten intake than partially breast-fed infants. In conclusion, this study presents representative population-based data on gluten intake in Danish infants and young children.},

   abstract = {Gastric leptin elicits its cardiovascular and splanchnic sympathoinhibitory responses via a vagal afferent mechanism, however the latter are blunted/abolished in animals fed a medium high fat diet (MHFD). In a diet-induced obesity model we sought to determine whether the renal sympathetic nerve discharge (RSND) and regional vasodilator responses to gastric leptin are also affected by diet and/or obesity. The diet induced obesity model was used in 2 separate studies. After 13 weeks on a MHFD the animals were classified as either obesity prone (OP) or obesity resistant (OR) depending on their weight gain. Control animals were fed a low fat diet for an equivalent period. Arterial pressure (AP) and heart rate (HR) were monitored in isoflurane-anaesthetised, artificially ventilated animals and RSND or regional vascular responses to leptin (15 mug/kg) administered close to the coeliac artery were evaluated. OP rats had higher baseline AP compared to control/OR rats (P<0.05). Close arterial leptin inhibited RSND in control animals but this response was abolished in OR and OP animals (P<0.01 for both). Leptin administration increased renal vascular conductance in control animals but this response was significantly attenuated only in OP animals (P<0.05). The vasodilator response in the superior mesenteric artery was not significantly different in any of the groups (P>0.05). Together these results suggest that, while the renal sympathoinhibitory responses to gastric leptin are affected by diet, the vasodilator responses to leptin in the renal vascular bed are only affected in OP animals. These changes may impact on cardiovascular homeostatic mechanisms in obesity.},

   abstract = {OBJECTIVE: To study the spectrum of clinical presentation of coeliac disease and the role of IgA anti-tissue transglutaminase antibodies titer in the diagnosis and effect of gluten-free diet on such titers in children. METHODS: The prospective study was conducted in the paediatric department of Combined Military Hospital, Kharian from Sep 2011 to Sep 2012. Children of 1-12 years of age presenting with chronic diarrhoea, malnutrition and failure to thrive were included regardless of gender, socioeconomic status, ethnicity and geographical distribution. Anti-tissue transglutaminase angibodies titers were done on enrolment. Patients with levels more than 30 u/ml were enrolled. They were advised strict gluten-free diet for six months. These titers were repeated after six months to document the effect of gluten-free diet on these titers. Paediatric endoscopy and duodenal biopsy facilities were not available at the study site, so the response was monitored through titers. Data was analysed using SPSS-20. RESULTS: Out of 61 patients with IgA levels more than 10 u/ml, 52 (85.24%) were found to have a positive (> 30u/ml) anti-tissue transglutaminase antibodies titers with a mean value of 42.67 +/- 7.60 U/ml. These 52 patients were then put on a trial of gluten-free diet for six months after which significant reduction in titer was noticed, with a mean value of 13.25 +/- 2.59 U/ml. This reduction in titer was associated with marked clinical improvement and regression of symptoms. Frequency of different clinical features in descending order revealed that chronic diarrhoea, abdominal distension, iron deficiency anaemia, failure to thrive, pallor and rickets were present in 38 (73.1%), 30 (57.7%), 29 (55.8%), 29 (53.8%), 28 (53.8%) patients respectively. CONCLUSION: Chronic diarrhoea, failure to thrive, pallor, abdominal distention and iron deficiency anaemia were common modes of presentation. The antibodies were strongly positive in most of the cases. All children showed significant improvement in clinical features and reduction in antibody titers after six-month trial of gluten free diet.},

The prevalence of celiac disease has been estimated to be ~1% in Europe and the USA, but it is rarer and/or underdiagnosed in Asia. We report a case of celiac disease in a predisposed patient, with a HLA-DQ2 heterodimer, and Graves' disease that was treated successfully with a gluten-free diet. A 47-year-old woman complained of persistent chronic diarrhea and weight loss over a 9 month period. Results of all serological tests and stool exams were negative. However, the patient was found to carry the HLA DQ2 heterodimer. Symptoms improved after a gluten-free diet was initiated. The patient has been followed and has suffered no recurrence of symptoms while on the gluten-free diet. An overall diagnosis of celiac disease was made in a genetically predisposed patient (HLA-DQ2 heterodimer) with Graves' disease.},

Aim of this study was to evaluate the prevalence and severity of joint involvement in paediatric patients with CD using musculoskeletal ultrasound (US). METHODS: Consecutive paediatric CD patients were enrolled and underwent US evaluations at level of knees, hips and ankles. The presence of joint effusion (JE), synovial hypertrophy, power Doppler signal and structural damage lesions (bone irregularities and erosions) was registered. Inflammatory abnormalities were scored on a semi-quantitative scale (0-3), and structural damage lesions on a dichotomous scale (0-1). RESULTS: Seventy-four CD children (mean age: 7.6 years; range: 1-14.2; M/F 24/50) were enrolled. Thirty-eight were on a gluten-containing diet (GCD) and 36 on a gluten-free diet (GFD). US showed the presence of abnormalities in 23 patients overall (31.1%); JE was the most frequently observed change (23/23). US abnormalities were observed in 19 patients (50.0%) of GCD group and in 4 of GFD group (11.1%, p=0.007). Interestingly, 12/23 (52.2%) patients with US-detected changes were asymptomatic. CONCLUSIONS: This is the first US study demonstrating joint involvement in children with CD. JE, the most frequent manifestation, was present also in asymptomatic patients and was reduced in those on GFD. These findings may indicate that, also at joint level, an inflammatory response represented by the appearance of JE may be induced by exposure to gluten.},

   abstract = {BACKGROUND: Chromo-zoom endoscopy has been demonstrated to be valuable in assessing the degree of intestinal villous atrophy in patients with suspected celiac disease. OBJECTIVE: To evaluate the diagnostic accuracy of chromo-zoom endoscopy in patients with difficult diagnosis because of nonconcordant test results and/or the confounding of a gluten-free diet initiated before an appropriate diagnosis of celiac disease and to compare the findings to a recent reference standard, the in vitro gliadin challenge test. DESIGN: Prospective, case-control study. SETTING: Tertiary-care referral hospital. PATIENTS: Patients without celiac disease (negative control group, n = 9), patients with celiac disease (positive control group, n = 41), and patients with difficult diagnosis (n = 27). INTERVENTION: Chromo-endoscopy with indigo carmine and endoscopic zoom-magnification were performed. Duodenal fragments were collected for the in vitro gliadin challenge test. The area under the receiver operating characteristic curve (ROC) was used for statistical analyses on accuracy. MAIN OUTCOME MEASUREMENTS: Diagnostic accuracy of chromo-zoom endoscopy for detection of mucosal abnormalities in patients with difficult diagnosis. RESULTS: Chromo-zoom endoscopy had a high accuracy for celiac disease diagnosis in analyses on negative controls and positive controls (area under roc = 0.99). In the difficult diagnosis group, the accuracy of chromo-zoom endoscopy was lower (area under roc = 0.83), but it increased after exclusion of patients with celiac disease on gluten-free diet (area under roc = 0.88). LIMITATIONS: There was a 4% failure rate in the ability to cultivate biopsies. Also, the study was done at an academic medical center. CONCLUSION: Chromo-zoom endoscopy has high accuracy for cases of difficult diagnosis of celiac disease but only in untreated patients with celiac disease.},

   abstract = {BACKGROUND AND AIM: To evaluate presence of sero-negative spondyloarthritis (SpA) in celiac disease (CD) patients, and whether compliance with a gluten free diet (GFD) improved arthritis manifestations in these patients. METHODS: We undertook a prospective, questionnaire based, cross-sectional cohort study to evaluate the presence or absence of SpA simultaneously in both CD and non-CD cohorts. RESULTS: 356/590 (60.3%) patients with CD participated in this study. 99% had diagnosis confirmed by a diagnostic test (79% small bowel biopsy, 19.8% blood test, 3.9% stool test). Approximately 131 (37%) cases of arthritis were reported in CD patients. Of the 6/356 CD patients with seronegative spondyloarthritides, four had sacroiliitis, two ankylosing spondylitis, and one psoriatic arthritis, compared to one ankylosing spondylitis and five psoriatic arthritis in non-CD. Osteoarthritis (89 vs 59, P = 0.93) was the most common diagnosis reported by respondents. More CD patients with diarrhea (94%) and anemia (81%) improved on GFD, compared to arthritis symptoms (30%). Autoimmune thyroiditis (10.6% vs 0.4%), insulin dependent diabetes mellitus (IDDM) (2.2% vs 1.7%), systemic Lupus erythematosus (SLE) (1.1% vs 0), and psoriasis (12.9% vs 5.5%) occurred more frequently in CD patients. The prevalence of Crohn's disease, ulcerative colitis, Sjogren's syndrome, primary biliary cirrhosis, and primary sclerosing cholangitis was around 1% each. Univariate Logistic regression analysis showed </= high school education (odds ratio [OR] 2.01, P < 0.003), age >/= 60 years (OR 4.13, P < 0.001), and osteoporosis (OR 2.78, P < 0.001) to be significantly associated with report of arthritis in CD patients. CONCLUSION: We did not find a high rate of SpA in CD patients. In contrast, increased rates of autoimmune thyroiditis, SLE, IDDM, and psoriasis were seen in CD.},

   abstract = {Celiac disease is a chronic, immune-mediated enteropathy caused by a permanent sensitivity to ingested gluten cereals that develops in genetically susceptible individuals. The classic presentation of celiac disease includes symptoms of malabsorption but has long been associated with cognitive, emotional, and behavioral disorders. We describe an 8-year-old patient with non-scarring alopecia and diagnosed with trichotillomania. Furthermore, she presented with a 3-year history of poor appetite and two or three annual episodes of mushy, fatty stools. Laboratory investigations showed a normal hemoglobin concentration and a low ferritin level. Serologic studies showed an elevated tissue immunoglobulin G anti-tissue transglutaminase level. A duodenal biopsy showed subtotal villous atrophy and crypt hyperplasia, and a large gastric trichobezoar was found in the stomach. Immediately after beginning a gluten-free diet, complete relief of trichotillomania and trichophagia was achieved. In this report, we describe a behavioral disorder as a primary phenomenon of celiac disease, irrespective of nutritional status.},

   abstract = {Fibromyalgia (FM) syndrome is a disabling clinical condition of unknown cause, and only symptomatic treatment with limited benefit is available. Gluten sensitivity that does not fulfill the diagnostic criteria for celiac disease (CD) is increasingly recognized as a frequent and treatable condition with a wide spectrum of manifestations that overlap with the manifestations of FM, including chronic musculoskeletal pain, asthenia, and irritable bowel syndrome. The aim of this report was to describe 20 selected patients with FM without CD who improved when placed on a gluten-free diet. An anti-transglutaminase assay, duodenal biopsy, and HLA typing were performed in all cases. CD was ruled out by negative anti-transglutaminase assay results and absence of villous atrophy in the duodenal biopsy. All patients had intraepithelial lymphocytosis without villous atrophy. Clinical response was defined as achieving at least one of the following scenarios: remission of FM pain criteria, return to work, return to normal life, or the discontinuation of opioids. The mean follow-up period was 16 months (range 5-31). This observation supports the hypothesis that non-celiac gluten sensitivity may be an underlying cause of FM syndrome.},

   abstract = {OBJECTIVES: Between 1984 and 1996, Sweden experienced an "epidemic" of clinical celiac disease in children <2 years of age, attributed partly to changes in infant feeding. Whether infant feeding affects disease occurrence and/or the clinical presentation remains unknown. We investigated and compared the total prevalence of celiac disease in 2 birth cohorts of 12-year-olds and related the findings to each cohort's ascertained infant feeding. METHODS: A 2-phase cross-sectional screening study was performed in which 13 279 children from 2 birth cohorts participated: children born during the epidemic (1993) and children born after the epidemic (1997). Previously diagnosed cases were reported and confirmed. Blood samples were analyzed for serological markers and children with positive values were referred for small intestinal biopsy. Infant feeding practices in the cohorts were ascertained via questionnaires. Prevalence comparisons were expressed as prevalence ratios. RESULTS: The total prevalence of celiac disease was 29 in 1000 and 22 in 1000 for the 1993 and 1997 cohorts, respectively. Children born in 1997 had a significantly lower risk of having celiac disease compared with those born in 1993 (prevalence ratio: 0.75; 95% confidence interval: 0.60-0.93; P = .01). The cohorts differed in infant feeding (specifically, in the proportion of infants introduced to dietary gluten in small amounts during ongoing breastfeeding). CONCLUSIONS: A significantly reduced prevalence of celiac disease in 12-year-olds indicates an option for disease prevention. Our findings suggest that the present infant feeding recommendation to gradually introduce gluten-containing foods from 4 months of age, preferably during ongoing breastfeeding, is favorable.},

Several autoimmune disorders are associated with this condition and may vary in their presentation. It is essential that clinicians are aware of the uncommon presenting features of neuromyelitis optica and associated autoimmune conditions. OBSERVATIONS: A 53-year-old woman presented with nausea and vomiting and was noted to have an asymptomatic elevated creatinine kinase level, which improved with conservative management. She had a history of iron-deficiency anemia due to long-standing celiac disease that was managed with a gluten-free diet. She then presented with recurrent transverse myelitis and a vesicobullous rash over her arms and feet that was pruritic and excoriating. Skin biopsy results confirmed a clinical diagnosis of dermatitis herpetiformis and antibody test findings against aquaporin-4 were positive, leading to a diagnosis of neuromyelitis optica spectrum disorder. She was treated with methylprednisolone sodium succinate, plasma exchange, and azathioprine and has remained in remission. CONCLUSIONS AND RELEVANCE: This report highlights the association of neuromyelitis optica with dermatitis herpetiformis, which can present even without clinical features of celiac disease. Nausea, vomiting, and asymptomatic hyperCKemia should be recognized as rare presenting features of neuromyelitis optica.},

Additionally, we examined symptoms within the schizophrenia group and found that while positive symptoms are significantly lower in people who have elevated antigliadin antibodies (AGA; 4.11 +/- 1.36 vs. 6.39 +/- 2.99, p = 0.020), no robust clinical profile differentiates between positive and negative antibody groups.

   abstract = {BACKGROUND: Short-chain fatty acids (SCFAs), particularly propionic and butyric acids, have been shown to have many positive health effects. The amount and type of SCFAs formed from dietary fibre by the colonic microbiota depends on the substrate available and is reflected in blood. The total intake and type of dietary fibre in people with gastrointestinal diseases differs considerably from healthy subjects. OBJECTIVE: To compare fasting SCFA concentrations in subjects with microscopic colitis (MC), celiac disease and controls without these diseases. SCFAs were also analysed over 6.5 h in young healthy subjects, who had eaten a fibre-rich breakfast, to identify a possible peak concentration of SCFAs after a meal. METHODS: SCFAs in serum were pre-concentrated using hollow fibre-supported liquid membrane extraction and gas chromatography. RESULTS: The MC group had a higher concentration of valeric acid than the control group (p < 0.01). No significant differences in other SCFA concentrations were seen between groups, but the control group tended to have higher concentration of acetic acid (p = 0.1). Furthermore, males had higher concentrations of SCFAs (with the exception of valeric acid) than females (p < 0.05), which were independent of groups. The peaks for acetic, propionic and butyric acids came approximately 5 h, 6.5 h and 2-3 h, respectively, after breakfast. CONCLUSION: The fasting concentrations of SCFAs were quite similar, although the fibre intake had probably been quite different for a long time. The results might have been different if SCFAs had been recorded over a longer period.},

   abstract = {BACKGROUND: Celiac disease (CD) has emerged as a common, but largely undiagnosed health problem. Numerous studies examined the influence of infant nutrition on the development of diagnosed CD. However, results are still inconsistent. In addition, the effect of infant feeding practices on the development of potential forms of CD might be different. OBJECTIVE: The objective was to examine whether the timing of gluten introduction and breastfeeding duration are associated with CD autoimmunity (CDA) in children at the age of 6 y. DESIGN: This study was embedded in the Generation R Study, a population-based prospective cohort study. Participants included 1679 Dutch children who were positive for human leukocyte antigen (HLA) DQ2/DQ8. Data on the timing of gluten introduction (<6 mo compared with >/=6 mo) and duration of breastfeeding (<6 mo compared with >/=6 mo) were obtained by questionnaire. Serum samples were analyzed for anti-tissue transglutaminase (anti-tTG) concentrations at age 6 y. Anti-tTG concentrations were categorized into negative (<7 U/mL) and positive (>/=7 U/mL) values. Positive anti-tTG concentrations were further categorized based on >/=10 times the upper limit of normal (ULN) values of the test kit (>/=7-70 and >/=70 U/mL). Multivariable logistic regression analyses were performed. RESULTS: Positive anti-tTG concentrations were found in 43 children, 26 of whom had concentrations >/=10 times the ULN (>/=70 IU/mL). The introduction of gluten from the age of 6 mo onward and breastfeeding for >/=6 mo were not significantly associated with positive anti-tTG concentrations. In addition, the timing of gluten introduction and duration of breastfeeding were not significantly associated with positive anti-tTG concentrations below or above 10 times the ULN. CONCLUSIONS: Delayed introduction of gluten beyond the age of 6 mo does not increase the risk of CDA. In addition, breastfeeding for >/=6 mo does not decrease the risk of CDA in children at 6 y of age.},

METHODS: The expression levels of 23 genes related to tight junctions were studied in biopsies from 16 patients with active CD and compared with biopsies from the same patients taken after 2 years on gluten-free diet (GFD) and with 16 non-CD controls. RESULTS: Nine genes showed altered expression levels in patients with active disease (CLDN2, PARD6A, ZAK, SYMPK, MYH14, and ACTB were upregulated, whereas MAGI1, TJP1, and PPP2R3A were downregulated). Alterations were reversible after 2 years on treatment, except for PPP2R3A, implicated in the negative control of cell growth and division. At the biological network level, important dysfunctions in several processes within the pathway were observed, including intestinal permeability, apicobasal polarity, and cell proliferation. CONCLUSIONS: Our work confirms the involvement of tight junction genes related to permeability, polarity, and cell proliferation in the epithelial destruction observed in CD. Coexpression patterns of several genes support the idea of a common regulatory mechanism that seems to be altered in active CD. In general, GFD normalization confirms the reversibility of the process, except for the constitutive downregulation of PPP2R3A suggestive of a genetic implication. Further studies in proteins and cells or tissues are necessary to confirm these findings.},

   abstract = {OBJECTIVE: Given the social constraints imposed by a gluten-free diet, it can be hypothesized that children with celiac disease (CD) living in the United States have a reduced health-related quality of life (HRQOL); however, there is no validated CD-specific HRQOL instrument for children living in the United States. The goals of this study were to develop and validate a CD-specific HRQOL instrument for children 8 to 18 years of age with CD and to report HRQOL in these children using both generic- and disease-specific instruments. METHODS: This was a prospective study using focus group methodology to develop a CD-specific HRQOL instrument that was then administered to children 8 to 18 years of age with CD living throughout the United States. Instrument validation methods included construct, convergent, and divergent validities. RESULTS: Two instruments were developed: CD-specific pediatric HRQOL instrument (CDPQOL) 8 to 12 and CDPQOL 13 to 18. A total of 181 children with CD completed the CDPQOL as well as a comparator generic instrument. Exploratory factor analysis restructured the CDPQOL and reduced the total number of items. The CDPQOL showed a moderate agreement with the Psychosocial dimensions of the generic instrument confirming convergent validity and low-to-moderate agreement with the Physical Health Summary dimension of the generic instrument confirming divergent validity. CONCLUSIONS: The CDPQOL, consisting of 13 to 17 questions, is a validated instrument for the measurement of HRQOL in children 8 to 18 years of age with CD living in the United States.},

   abstract = {UNLABELLED: Neurologic manifestations are present in a reasonable proportion of adult celiac patients and can be the first sign of gluten sensitivity. In children, the risk of neurological complications is lower, and gluten sensitivity with neurological presentation seems to be rare. We report a case of gluten sensitivity with severe neurological presentation in a 3-year-old girl. In the absence of gastrointestinal symptoms, the presence of white matter lesions in cerebral magnetic resonance imaging suggested an acute disseminated encephalomyelitis. Recurrence of neurologic symptoms and cerebral lesions over a long period of time made the authors consider an autoimmune/inflammatory systemic disease. IgA anti-transglutaminase (TG) 2 was elevated and duodenal biopsy confirmed the presence of enteropathy. A gluten-free diet led to complete resolution of neurological manifestations and arrest of white matter lesions progression. CONCLUSION: In children with unclear neurologic manifestations with probable autoimmune etiology, anti-TG2 autoantibody titers should be determined considering the possibility of gluten sensitivity. Gluten-free diet remains the only effective treatment reported to date and, therefore, should be recommended to all patients with gluten sensitivity despite the type of manifestations. More studies, focusing on neurological manifestations and its response to gluten-free diet, are needed.},

   abstract = {OBJECTIVES: Differentiating between celiac disease (CD) and non-celiac gluten sensitivity (NCGS) is important for appropriate management but is often challenging. METHODS: We retrospectively reviewed records from 238 patients who presented for the evaluation of symptoms responsive to gluten restriction without prior diagnosis or exclusion of CD. Demographics, presenting symptoms, serologic, genetic, and histologic data, nutrient deficiencies, personal history of autoimmune diseases, and family history of CD were recorded. NCGS was defined as symptoms responsive to a gluten-free diet (GFD) in the setting of negative celiac serology and duodenal biopsies while on a gluten-containing diet or negative human leukocyte antigen (HLA) DQ2/DQ8 testing. RESULTS: Of the 238 study subjects, 101 had CD, 125 had NCGS, 9 had non-celiac enteropathy, and 3 had indeterminate diagnosis. CD subjects presented with symptoms of malabsorption 67.3% of the time compared with 24.8% of the NCGS subjects (P<0.0001). In addition, CD subjects were significantly more likely to have a family history of CD (P=0.004), personal history of autoimmune diseases (P=0.002), or nutrient deficiencies (P<0.0001). The positive likelihood ratio for diagnosis of CD of a >2x upper limit of normal IgA trans-glutaminase antibody (tTG) or IgA/IgG deaminated gliadan peptide antibody (DGP) with clinical response to GFD was 130 (confidence interval (CI): 18.5-918.3). The positive likelihood ratio of the combination of gluten-responsive symptoms and negative IgA tTG or IgA/IgG DGP on a regular diet for NCGS was 9.6 (CI: 5.5-16.9). When individuals with negative IgA tTG or IgA/IgG DGP also lacked symptoms of malabsorption (weight loss, diarrhea, and nutrient deficiencies) and CD risk factors (personal history of autoimmune diseases and family history of CD), the positive likelihood ratio for NCGS increased to 80.9. CONCLUSIONS: On the basis of our findings, we have developed a diagnostic algorithm to differentiate CD from NCGS. Subjects with negative celiac serologies (IgA tTG or IgA/IgG DGP) on a regular diet are unlikely to have CD. Those with negative serology who also lack clinical evidence of malabsorption and CD risk factors are highly likely to have NCGS and may not require further testing. Those with equivocal serology should undergo HLA typing to determine the need for biopsy.},

   abstract = {BACKGROUND: Failure to thrive and hematochezia in children may be alarm signs warranting endoscopy. In contrast, vascular malformations of the small intestine are uncommon in this age group. We report on a female toddler in whom various imaging techniques revealed an unusually large segmental vascular malformation of the ileum as the cause of the child's main clinical symptoms. CASE PRESENTATION: A 19 months old girl presented with severe anemia (Hb 3 mmol/l), failure to thrive and chronic diarrhea. Diagnostics for intestinal blood loss and pathogens were negative. The child had duodenoscopy, also for histological diagnosis of celiac disease, with negative results. A dietary protocol was suggestive for inadequate iron intake and she was supplemented. After symptomless four-months the child presented again, now with mild abdominal pain and, for the first time, hematochezia. An orienting abdominal ultrasound (US) study showed a suspicious tumorous bowel condition. A subsequent detailed abdominal US supplemented by a saline enema during investigation (i.e., "hydrocolon", to improve outlining of the formation's localization) revealed a large circumferential cystiform vascular mass of the ileum causing segmental ileal obstruction.Complementing preoperative abdominal hydro-MRI, planned based on the findings of the US study, confirmed the suspected vascular malformation of the ileum and exquisitely outlined the extent, location and anatomy.The patient was successfully operated laparoscopically, the affected ileum segment with the mass was completely removed as proven by histology, and the child recovered well. CONCLUSIONS: The huge segmental vascular malformation of the distal ileum described here is an extreme rarity in young children. Although the reported child's presenting symptoms malabsorption and malnutrition could have been responsible for its severe anemia, this was obviously caused by blood losses from the ileal vascular malformation. It was due to incipient abdominal pain rather than hematochezia that abdominal US was performed and proved crucial for correctly diagnosing this rare malformation. Even in this extensive case detailed imaging work-up including adapted MRI added all information necessary for minimal invasive laparoscopic en bloc resection.},

The markers were correlated with conventional serological tests Anti-tissue transglutaminase (Anti-TTG) used for diagnosis and follow up of the disease; wherever possible. METHODS: Thirty newly diagnosed cases of CD (on the basis of histopathology and serology) not on GFD were enrolled as Group 1 of the study. Thirty age and sex matched controls from the Pediatric Surgery OPD formed Group 2. Thirty cases of CD on GFD for at least 2 y (Group 3) were also enrolled in the study. Upper G.I. endoscopy was performed in all Group 1 patients and cytokine levels assayed by ELISA on serum obtained from all patients in Groups 1, 2, 3. RESULTS: Mean sIL-2R level in Group 1(1498.1+/-1234.31 pg/ml) and Group 3 (488.78+/-396.18 pg/ml) were significantly higher than the controls (336.27+/-218.67 pg/ml p < 0.05). Among the patients with CD, mean serum levels in Group 1 were higher than in Group 3 (p < 0.05). sIL-2R levels showed good correlation with tTg levels in Group 1 patients (p < 0.000, r = 0.69). Mean IL-6 levels in Group 1 were significantly higher (28.43+/-28.32 pg/ml) than Group 2(15.03+/-7.72 pg/ml p < 0.05) and Group 3(11.26+/-5.13 pg/ml p < 0.05). IL-6 levels were comparable between Groups 2 and 3 (p > 0.05).IL-6 levels showed good correlation with tTg levels in Group 1(p < 0.008, r = 0.471). Mean TNFalpha levels in Group 1(179.66+/-102.93 pg/ml), Group 2 (153.16+/-27.02 pg/ml) and Group 3 (166.67+/-28.95 pg/ml) were comparable (p > 0.05). TNFalpha levels showed poor correlation with tTg levels in Group 1 patients (p > 0.604, r = -0.099). CONCLUSIONS: sIL-2R and IL-6 levels have a good correlation with CD activity and can be used as reliable markers for detecting minimal transgression from GFD.},

METHODS: The project consists of two parts: (i) a pilot study of preschool children aged 2-6 years to test the feasibility and diagnostic accuracy of community-based screening and (ii) a CD prevalence study, by random clustered sampling and proportionate stratification of various geographical areas in Greece. Trained nonmedical staff performed a rapid immunochromatographic test to detect IgA antibodies to tTG-IgA and IgA deficiency. Toddlers with positive results were referred to a paediatric gastroenterologist for further assessment with serum anti-tTG IgA and EMA-IgA. Children with positive serum anti-tTG and anti-EMA underwent upper gastrointestinal tract endoscopy and small bowel biopsy and were subsequently in gluten-free diet. RESULTS: In this project participated 1136 toddlers, who were tested at school. The prevalence of positive rapid anti-tTG screening was 1:154, of IgA deficiency 1:120 and of biopsy-proven CD 1:154. The prevalence of CD from this pilot study served as expected prevalence value for sample size calculation for the main prevalence study. CONCLUSION: This protocol using rapid immunochromatographic test for the detection of both IgA deficiency and CD is easy to be performed by nonmedical staff in a community setting, enabling the accurate identification of new CD cases among asymptomatic population.},

   abstract = {Heat shock proteins (Hsp) are highly conserved immunomodulatory molecules upregulated when cells are exposed to stressful stimuli, such as inflammation. Their involvement in various autoimmune diseases, including autoimmune bullous diseases and celiac disease, has been increasingly recognized. To further study the role of Hsp in autoimmune bullous diseases, we have investigated for the first time the humoral autoimmune response to Hsp40, Hsp60, Hsp70, and Hsp90 in patients with dermatitis herpetiformis (DH; n = 26), bullous pemphigoid (BP; n = 23), and pemphigus vulgaris (PV; n = 16), the first representing a cutaneous manifestation of celiac disease. While in patients with active BP and PV, serum levels of autoantibodies against these Hsp did not differ from the corresponding age- and gender-matched healthy controls (n = 9-14); circulating autoantibodies against Hsp60, Hsp70, and Hsp90 were found to be increased at the active disease stage of DH. Further analysis of this latter patient subgroup showed that these anti-Hsp autoantibodies decreased in parallel with serum autoantibodies against epidermal and tissue transglutaminase during remission of skin lesions following a gluten-free diet, revealing significantly positive correlations. Although further studies on larger groups of patients will be needed to confirm the present data, our results support the notion that autoantibodies against Hsp60, Hsp70, and Hsp90 deserve attention in the study of the mechanisms that promote the development and maintenance of DH and possibly also the underlying celiac disease as well as potential novel disease biomarkers.},

This was evaluated in the present study, focusing on small-bowel mucosal histology and gastrointestinal symptoms in celiac adults maintaining a strict gluten-free diet with or without oats. Altogether 106 long-term treated celiac adults were enrolled for this cross-sectional follow-up study. Daily consumption of oats and fiber was assessed, and small-bowel mucosal morphology and densities of CD3+, alphabeta+ and gammasigma+ intraepithelial lymphocytes determined. Gastrointestinal symptoms were assessed by a validated Gastrointestinal Symptom Rating Scale questionnaire. Seventy (66%) out of the 106 treated celiac disease patients had consumed a median of 20 g of oats (range 1-100 g) per day for up to eight years; all consumed oat products bought from general stores. Daily intake and long-term consumption of oats did not result in small-bowel mucosal villous damage, inflammation, or gastrointestinal symptoms. Oat-consumers had a significantly higher daily intake of fiber than those who did not use oats. Two thirds of celiac disease patients preferred to use oats in their daily diet. Even long-term ingestion of oats had no harmful effects.},

The environmental trigger (gluten derived from wheat, rye and barley), the genetic predisposition conferred by the HLA-DQ2 and HLA-DQ8 haplotypes and many steps in the disease pathogenesis are known. This knowledge has enabled researchers to suggest novel alternative treatments or adjunctive therapies to the gluten-free diet, which is currently the only available and effective treatment for the condition. This Review focuses on emerging and potential treatment strategies that are based on the current concept of the disease pathophysiology. The search for novel future treatment modes, including nonpharmacological and pharmacological approaches, is also outlined. The potential pitfalls associated with the various research avenues are also discussed.},

   abstract = {BACKGROUND: Food habits, nutrient needs and intakes differ between males and females, although few nutritional studies on patients with coeliac disease (CD) have reported results stratified by gender. OBJECTIVES: To compare energy and nutrient intakes among 13-year olds diagnosed with CD in early childhood with those of a non-coeliac (NC) age- and gender-matched control group, and also with estimated average requirements (EAR). METHODS: A case-control study was conducted in Sweden 2006-2007 within the coeliac screening study ETICS (Exploring The Iceberg of Coeliacs in Sweden). Dietary intake was assessed among 37 adolescents (23 girls) diagnosed with CD at median age 1.7 years (CD group) and 805 (430 girls) NC controls (NC group) using a food-frequency questionnaire covering 4 weeks. Reported energy intake was validated by comparison with the calculated physical activity level (PAL). RESULTS: Regardless of CD status, most adolescents reported an intake above EAR for most nutrients. However, both groups had a low intake of vitamin C, with 13% in the CD-group and 25% in the NC-group below EAR, and 21% of boys in the CD-group below EAR for thiamine. The intake of fatty acids was unbalanced, with a high intake of saturated and a low intake of unsaturated fats. Girls and boys in the CD-group had an overall lower nutrient density in reported food intake compared to girls and boys in the NC-group. CONCLUSIONS: Nutrient intake of adolescent girls and boys with CD was mostly comparable to intakes of NC controls. Dietitians should take the opportunity to reinforce a generally healthy diet when providing information about the gluten-free diet.},

   abstract = {A dietary survey was performed during a large screening study in Sweden among 13-year-old adolescents. The aim was to study how the intake of food groups was affected by a screening-detected diagnosis of coeliac disease (CD) and its gluten-free (GF) treatment. Food intake was reported using a FFQ, and intake reported by the adolescents who were diagnosed with CD was compared with the intake of two same-aged referent groups: (i) adolescents diagnosed with CD prior to screening; and (ii) adolescents without CD. The food intake groups were measured at baseline before the screening-detected cases were aware of their CD, and 12-18 months later. The results showed that food intakes were affected by screen-detected CD and its dietary treatment. Many flour-based foods were reduced such as pizza, fish fingers and pastries. The results also indicated that bread intake was lower before the screened diagnosis compared with the other studied groups, but increased afterwards. Specially manufactured GF products (for example, pasta and bread) were frequently used in the screened CD group after changing to a GF diet. The present results suggest that changing to a GF diet reduces the intake of some popular foods, and the ingredients on the plate are altered, but this do not necessarily include a change of food groups. The availability of manufactured GF replacement products makes it possible for adolescents to keep many of their old food habits when diagnosed with CD in Sweden.},

The prevalence of CD in Indian patients with nutritional anemia is not known. PATIENTS AND METHODS: Adolescent and adult patients presenting with nutritional anemia were prospectively screened for CD using IgA anti-tissue transglutaminase antibody (anti-tTG Ab) followed, if positive, by upper gastrointestinal endoscopy and duodenal biopsy. RESULTS: Ninety-six patients [mean +/- SD age 32.1 +/- 13.1 years and median duration of anemia 11 months (range 1 to 144 months)] were screened. Of these patients, 80 had iron deficiency anemia, 11 had megaloblastic anemia, and 5 had dimorphic anemia. Seventy-three patients were on hematinics and 36.4 % had received blood transfusions. Nineteen had a history of chronic diarrhea and the mean +/- SD duration of diarrhea in them was 9.7 +/- 35.8 months. IgA anti-tTG Ab was positive in 13 patients, of whom 12 agreed to undergo duodenal biopsy. Ten patients had villous atrophy (Marsh grade 3a in three, 3b in one, and 3c in six) and two did not. Thus, 10 patients with nutritional anemia (iron deficiency 9, vitamin B12 deficiency 1) were diagnosed to have CD. On multivariate logistic regression, age, duration of symptoms, and presence of diarrhea were found to be the predictors of CD. All the patients with CD were put on gluten-free diet and with iron and vitamin supplementations and showed a significant improvement in hemoglobin concentration. CONCLUSIONS: CD screening should be included in the work up of otherwise unexplained nutritional anemia.},

   abstract = {BACKGROUND: Coeliac disease, an autoimmune disorder triggered by gluten ingestion, is managed by a gluten-free diet (GFD), which is difficult for many patients. Larazotide acetate is a first-in-class oral peptide that prevents tight junction opening, and may reduce gluten uptake and associated sequelae. AIM: To evaluate the efficacy and tolerability of larazotide acetate during gluten challenge. METHODS: This exploratory, double-blind, randomised, placebo-controlled study included 184 patients maintaining a GFD before and during the study. After a GFD run-in, patients were randomised to larazotide acetate (1, 4, or 8 mg three times daily) or placebo and received 2.7 grams of gluten daily for 6 weeks. Outcomes included an experimental biomarker of intestinal permeability, the lactulose-to-mannitol (LAMA) ratio and clinical symptoms assessed by Gastrointestinal Symptom Rating Scale (GSRS) and anti-transglutaminase antibody levels. RESULTS: No significant differences in LAMA ratios were observed between larazotide acetate and placebo groups. Larazotide acetate 1-mg limited gluten-induced symptoms measured by GSRS (P = 0.002 vs. placebo). Mean ratio of anti-tissue transglutaminase IgA levels over baseline was 19.0 in the placebo group compared with 5.78 (P = 0.010), 3.88 (P = 0.005) and 7.72 (P = 0.025) in the larazotide acetate 1-, 4-, and 8-mg groups, respectively. Adverse event rates were similar between larazotide acetate and placebo groups. CONCLUSIONS: Larazotide acetate reduced gluten-induced immune reactivity and symptoms in patients with coeliac disease undergoing gluten challenge and was generally well tolerated; however, no significant difference in LAMA ratios between larazotide acetate and placebo was observed. Results and design of this exploratory study can inform the design of future studies of pharmacological interventions in patients with coeliac disease.},

It is characterised by chronic inflammation of the small-intestinal mucosa and triggered by eating gluten. It is challenging to diagnose be-cause of the many and varied ways in which it may present. OBJECTIVE: To present up-to-date information on CD as we now understand it, with recommendations on whom to test and how to test them, and how to manage patients once they are diagnosed. DISCUSSION: Primary care practitioners have a crucial role in improving rates of CD diagnosis, and in the ongoing care of patients with CD. A blood test for coeliac-specific antibodies will identify most patients who need to undergo duodenal biopsy to make the diagnosis. Management encompasses supporting patients with adherence to the gluten-free diet and conducting a CD-focused clinical review every 1-2 years.},

   abstract = {BACKGROUND: Psoriasis is a common, chronic, disfiguring, inflammatory and proliferative condition of skin manifested by red, scaly, sharply demarcated, indurated plaques present particularly over the extensor surfaces and scalp. The disease has been found to be associated with celiac disease related antibodies with variable frequencies in different populations of the world. The subset of patients showing this association have a higher psoriasis severity and also respond well to cost effective way of gluten free diet. There is a need to work out the frequency of these antibodies in our local psoriatic patients. METHODS: The study was carried out in Department of Dermatology, Military Hospital Rawalpindi from 4th June to 4th December, 2008. A total of 80 patients of both gender, aged more than 15 with a clinical diagnosis of psoriasis attending dermatology outpatient department were selected. Relevant history and thorough physical examination was performed and disease characteristics like previous treatments received and history of arthropathy were obtained. Coeliac disease related antibodies were assessed on serum by indirect immunofluorescence and data was analysed using software SPSS-13. RESULTS: From the study of 80 patients, celiac disease related antibodies were found in none of the cases. All the severe and mild to moderate patients of psoriasis were negative for IgA antigliadin antibodies, IgG antigliadin antibodies and IgA anti-reticulin antibody. CONCLUSION: This study concludes that celiac disease related antibodies are not present in psoriatic patients irrespective of severity of disease in our local population.},

   abstract = {Vitiligo is a common pigmentary skin condition with a profound impact. Despite a number of therapeutic modalities, few have been demonstrated to result in significant repigmentation within a brief period of time. Reported dietary interventions are sparse. Following exclusion of gluten in the diet, early and extensive repigmentation of facial lesions were noted in a young female adult of Asian ethnicity with acrofacial vitiligo. The majority of the benefits occurred within the first month and stabilized at 4 months. Previous topical and phototherapy had not been found to be effective. The patient was maintained on the previously prescribed dapsone therapy. Dietary elimination can potentially be a disease-modifying intervention for vitiligo and should be considered even in patients without concomitant celiac disease.},

   abstract = {BACKGROUND: The need for an early and accurate diagnosis in celiac disease (CD) has focused attention on new diagnostic approaches, based on the efficiency of serological markers and the high negative predictive value of human leukocyte antigen (HLA) non-DQ2/8. METHODS: We performed a retrospective review of all of the patients suspected of having CD who had undergone a small bowel biopsy in our gastroenterology unit. All symptomatic children with serological marker at time of biopsy (immunoglobulin A-tissue transglutaminase antibody, endomysial antibody, and HLA genotype) were included. The triple test (TT) was positive if immunoglobulin A-tissue transglutaminase antibody was 10 times the upper limit of normal, plus positive endomysial antibody plus human leukocyte antigen-DQ2/DQ8. RESULTS: A total of 150 patients met the inclusion criteria and were enrolled in the study. One hundred sixteen were positive for the TT; 113 of 116 (97.4%) had a Marsh 2/3 histological lesion and had been considered to have CD. Thus, positive predictive value of the TT was 97.4%. The other 3 cases (2.6%) had Marsh 0/1 lesion, so we consider them to be false-positives for the TT; however, on follow-up, all 3 children developed histological damage after a gluten challenge. Finally, the positive predictive value of the TT was 100%. Thirty-four patients were negative for the TT: 22 patients are celiac, 3 are celiac but challenge gluten diet is pending, and the 9 patients left have other gastrointestinal disorder. CONCLUSIONS: Our study supports the view that in selected children who are symptomatic and positive for the TT, CD diagnosis could be established independent of histological findings.},

   abstract = {A large national investigation into the extent of gluten cross-contamination of naturally gluten-free ingredients (flours and starches) sold in Canada was performed. Samples (n = 640) were purchased from eight Canadian cities and via the internet during the period 2010-2012 and analysed for gluten contamination. The results showed that 61 of the 640 (9.5%) samples were contaminated above the Codex-recommended maximum level for gluten-free products (20 mg kg(-)(1)) with a range of 5-7995 mg kg(-)(1). For the ingredients that were labelled gluten-free the contamination range (5-141 mg kg(-)(1)) and number of samples were lower (3 of 268). This picture was consistent over time, with approximately the same percentage of samples above 20 mg kg(-)(1) in both the initial set and the subsequent lot. Looking at the total mean (composite) contamination for specific ingredients the largest and most consistent contaminations come from higher fibre ingredients such as soy (902 mg kg(-)(1)), millet (272 mg kg(-)(1)) and buckwheat (153 mg kg(-)(1)). Of the naturally gluten-free flours and starches tested that do not contain a gluten-free label, the higher fibre ingredients would constitute the greatest probability of being contaminated with gluten above 20 mg kg(-)(1).},

   abstract = {PURPOSE: Computer simulations are utilized during pharmaceutical development in order to design appropriate formulation based on the absorption, distribution, metabolism, and excretion (ADME) and physicochemical properties of target compounds, so that adequate prescriptions are offered to patients. Oro-cecal transit time (OCTT) is an important factor affecting these simulations because the absorption of drug that administered orally and the resultant pharmacokinetic profile are expressed as a function of time. Given the large intra- and inter-individual variance in OCTT, it is unsurprising that an accurate model has not yet been proposed. METHODS: We conducted a meta-analysis using subject-level data to construct a statistical model that predicted OCTT. Literature that utilized lactulose to measure OCTT was identified and analyzed using a mixed-effects model. RESULTS: The OCTTs of fasting healthy subjects were expressed using a linear model, with the amount of lactulose as the single significant explanatory factor. We found that this model could statistically distinguish the OCTTs of subjects with altered physical status from those of healthy people. Specifically, cystic fibrosis and celiac disease most significantly affected OCTT. CONCLUSION: The OCTT models developed herein incorporate inter-subject variations and can contribute to providing more accurate predictions of drug pharmacokinetic profiles.},

Recently, large efforts were also invested in the development of mouse models in order to explore pathogenic hypotheses, and also with the goal to design pretherapeutic models that could be used to test innovative therapies. Yet, modeling this complex multifactorial disease has been a very challenging task. Herein, we review how approaches in rodents have provided insight into celiac disease pathophysiology and also highlight the difficulties met to fully recapitulate the human disease.},

   abstract = {BACKGROUND & AIMS: CD4(+) T cells specific for dietary gluten and interleukin 15 (IL15) contribute to the pathogenesis of celiac disease. We investigated whether and how they interact to damage the intestine using mice that overexpress human IL15 in the intestinal epithelium and have CD4(+) T cells specific for ovalbumin, a dietary antigen. METHODS: We crossed mice with CD4(+) T cells specific for ovalbumin (OTII) with mice that overexpress human IL15 under an intestine-specific promoter (B6 x IL15Tge). The offspring (OTII x IL15Tge mice) received control or ovalbumin-containing diets until 3 months of age. Enteropathy was monitored by weight, ratio of villous:crypt length, and the number of intestinal lymphocytes. Phenotype, cytokine production, and degranulation of mucosal and spleen lymphocytes were analyzed by multicolor flow cytometry or enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay. Regulatory T-cell function and CD8(+) T-cell activation were analyzed in co-culture assays. RESULTS: Exposure to ovalbumin reduced growth and led to enteropathy in OTII x IL15Tge mice but not in control OTII x B6 littermates. Enteropathy was associated with expansion of mucosal granzyme B(+) CD8(+) T cells, and developed despite increased frequency of functional ovalbumin-specific regulatory T cells. Ovalbumin-activated CD4(+) T cells secreted IL2, which along with IL15 stimulated expansion of noncognate intestinal cytotoxic CD8(+) T cells, which did not respond to regulatory T cells and induced epithelial damage. CONCLUSIONS: We observed that in mice given food antigen, cooperation between IL15 and CD4(+) T cells is necessary and sufficient to activate CD8(+) T cells and damage the small intestine. We propose that this process is involved in the development of celiac disease.},

   abstract = {Celiac disease (CD) is triggered by the consumption of gluten-containing cereals to which patients mount a T-lymphocyte and antibody response in both immunoglobulin A and immunoglobulin G classes coupled with autoantibody production against self-proteins, predominantly type-2 (tissue) transglutaminase (TG2). TG2 autoantibodies are biologically active and bind to their target protein in the patients' tissues, including the gut and extraintestinal tissues. This peculiar systemic anti-TG2 reaction is dependent on the presence of dietary gluten and stops after its elimination. As both anti-TG2 and anti-gliadin antibodies are activity markers, their detection is valuable for the disease recognition and therapy monitoring. High concentrations of serum anti-TG2 antibody positivity supported by highly specific positivity for endomysial antibodies became the critical component of celiac disease diagnosis, although serum antibodies as indirect markers have limitations and are not able to replace histology analysis in all cases. Studies focusing on tissue-bound antibodies may further improve our understanding of their role.},

The etiology of pathologic bone alterations in CD is multifactorial; however, two main mechanisms are involved: intestinal malabsorption and chronic inflammation. A strict gluten-free diet (GFD) is thought to be the only effective treatment for CD; but treating bone complications related to CD remains complex. The objective of this review is to elucidate the bones problems related to CD and to increase awareness of osteoporosis development, considered as a sign of atypical CD presentation. Currently, a question of whether GFD alone is an effective treatment to correct the bone alterations in patients with CD is under debate. This review presents factors contributing to pathologic bone derangement, recent research on the epidemiology of low BMD, osteoporosis, and fractures, and the treatment of bone problems in patients with CD. The roles of calcium and transport mechanisms are additionally presented.},

Sensitivity to nutritional elements, for example gluten, has been suggested, but a serological screening has not been performed yet. METHODS: A gluten-containing diet was offered to 24 animals, followed by a gluten-free diet. During these diets, serum IgA antibodies to gliadin (AGA), tissue transglutaminase (tTG), deamidated gliadin (ADGA), and glycoprotein 2 (AGP2A) were determined. Body weight, diarrhea, and other clinical symptoms were recorded. RESULTS: Gluten increased AGA, tTG, and AGP2A concentrations in 13 of 24 animals. A significant decline of AGA and AGP2A was seen on gluten withdrawal. Positive (AGA, tTG) animals presented diarrhea more frequently on gluten-containing diet and showed significantly increased body weight on gluten-free diet compared to negative animals. CONCLUSION: Gluten ingestion caused gastrointestinal symptoms in common marmosets, which disappeared on gluten withdrawal. Considering the immunological response to both diets, gluten sensitivity seems to be most likely.},

   abstract = {BACKGROUND & OBJECTIVES: The symptoms of celiac disease (CD) are varied and metabolic bone disease (MBD) is less recognized amongst all manifestations in CD patients. Bone disease in CD is attributed to secondary hyperparathyroidism, which in turn is associated with increased bone remodelling. Improvement in bone mineral density (BMD) with gluten free diet (GFD) is known, but the data on efficacy of bisphosphonates in CD patients are limited. Bisphosphonates being a potent inhibitor of bone resorption may be useful in patients with CD having low BMD. The aim of the present investigation was to study the effect of zoledronic acid on BMD in CD patients. METHODS: A total of 28 CD patients were randomized to receive GFD, calcium and cholecalciferol (group A), and zoledronic acid (group B). Baseline biochemical tests and T-score by dual energy x-ray absorptiometer were done and repeated after 12 months. RESULTS: The T-score showed improvement in the control arm (group A) from -3.31 +/- 1.46 to -2.12 +/- 1.44, a gain of 35.9 per cent (P<0.05) and in drug arm (group B) -2.82 +/- 1.27 to -1.06 +/- 1.84, registering a gain of 62.4 per cent (P<0.001). However, there was no difference in improvement of T-score in zoledronic acid group as compared to the control group. INTERPRETATION & CONCLUSIONS: Administration of zoledronic acid was not found to be better than GFD alone in increasing BMD in CD patients with low BMD in this pilot study.},

   abstract = {INTRODUCTION: Gluten is the main trigger for celiac disease, and the current treatment is based on its elimination from the diet. Although the symptoms usually disappear during the diet, it is restrictive and difficult to maintain. Further, despite a strict treatment the small-bowel mucosal damage does now always heal. Consequently, adherence is often poor and new treatment approaches are needed. With an increased understanding of the disease pathogenesis, several novel treatments have been suggested, and some of them have already entered Phase II clinical trials. AREAS COVERED: This article reviews the latest status of the drugs in development for celiac disease. The article focuses mainly on synthetic drugs currently entering in clinical trials. EXPERT OPINION: It is anticipated that some of the treatments under investigation will soon enter Phase III clinical trials, although challenges remain. For instance, histological studies are problematic in wide-scale clinical studies. On the other hand, the existing non-invasive serological methods and clinical outcome measures might be too insensitive for monitoring responses to the possible drug candidates. There is also no animal model which would accurately reflect celiac disease. Well-conducted basic and clinical research is required to develop better non-invasive surrogate markers and patient-related outcomes for future pharmacological studies.},

   abstract = {BACKGROUND & AIMS: We investigated whether screen-detected and apparently asymptomatic adults with endomysial antibodies (EmA) benefit from a gluten-free diet (GFD). METHODS: We performed a prospective trial of 3031 individuals at risk for celiac disease based on screens for EmA. Of 148 seropositive individuals, 40 fulfilled inclusion criteria and were assigned randomly to groups placed on a GFD or gluten-containing diets. We evaluated ratios of small-bowel mucosal villous height:crypt depth, serology and laboratory test results, gastrointestinal symptom scores, physiologic well-being, perception of health by a visual analog scale, bone mineral density, and body composition at baseline and after 1 year. Thereafter, the group on the gluten-containing diet started a GFD and was evaluated a third time; subjects in the GFD group remained on this diet. RESULTS: After 1 year on the GFD, the mean mucosal villous height:crypt depth values increased (P < .001), levels of celiac-associated antibodies decreased (P < .003), and gastrointestinal symptoms improved to a greater extent than in patients on gluten-containing diets (P = .003). The GFD group also had reduced indigestion (P = .006), reflux (P = .05), and anxiety (P = .025), and better health, based on the visual analog scale (P = .017), than the gluten-containing diet group. Only social function scores improved more in the gluten-containing diet group than in the GFD group (P = .031). There were no differences between groups in laboratory test results, bone mineral density, or body composition. Most measured parameters improved when patients in the gluten-containing diet group were placed on GFDs. No subjects considered their experience to be negative and most expected to remain on GFDs. CONCLUSIONS: GFDs benefit asymptomatic EmA-positive patients. The results support active screening of patients at risk for celiac disease. Clinicaltrials.gov no: NCT01116505.},

   abstract = {Avoiding exposure to gluten is currently the only effective treatment for celiac disease. However, the evidence suggests that for most affected individuals, exposure to less than 10 mg/day is unlikely to cause histological changes to the intestinal mucosa. The daily diet of people with celiac disease does not rely solely on gluten-free pre-packaged foods, but also on naturally gluten-free grains (e.g., rice, buckwheat, ...) and foods with grain-derived ingredients (i.e., flour and starches) used for cooking and baking at home. The objective of this study was to estimate the level of incidental gluten potentially present in gluten-free diets from a Canadian perspective. We have conducted gluten exposure estimations from grain-containing foods and foods with grain-derived ingredients, taking into consideration the various rates of food consumption by different sex and age groups. These estimates have concluded that if gluten was present at levels not exceeding 20 ppm, exposure to gluten would remain below 10 mg per day for all age groups studied. However, in reality the level of gluten found in naturally gluten-free ingredients is not static and there may be some concerns related to the flours made from naturally gluten-free cereal grains. It was found that those containing a higher level of fiber and that are frequently used to prepare daily foods by individuals with celiac disease could be a concern. For this category of products, only the flours and starches labelled "gluten-free" should be used for home-made preparations.},

   abstract = {BACKGROUND: Refractory celiac disease is defined by persisting malabsorptive symptoms in spite of a strict gluten free diet for at least 6 to 12 months. Alternatives to gluten free diet seem to be still controversial. AIM: To describe the clinical and epidemiologic aspects of refractory celiac disease, and to identify therapeutic options in this condition. METHODS: Systematic review and critical analysis of observational studies, clinical trials and case reports that focused on diagnosis and management of refractory celiac disease. RESULTS: Refractory celiac disease can be classified as type 1 or type 2 according to the phenotype of intraepithelial lymphocytes. Great complications such as enteropathy-associated T-cell lymphoma may occur in a subgroup of these patients mainly in refractory celiac disease type 2. Curative therapies are still lacking. CONCLUSION: Refractory celiac disease remains a diagnosis of exclusion. Its prognosis remains still dismal by the absence yet of curative therapies. However, some new treatments seem to hold promise during few cohort-studies.},

   abstract = {BACKGROUND & AIMS: Gluten ingestion leads to small intestinal mucosal injury in patients with celiac disease, necessitating strict life-long exclusion of dietary gluten. Despite adherence to a gluten-free diet, many patients remain symptomatic and still have small intestinal inflammation. In this case, nondietary therapies are needed. We investigated the ability of ALV003, a mixture of 2 recombinant gluten-specific proteases given orally, to protect patients with celiac disease from gluten-induced mucosal injury in a phase 2 trial. METHODS: We established the optimal daily dose of gluten to be used in a 6-week challenge study. Then, in the intervention study, adults with biopsy-proven celiac disease were randomly assigned to groups given ALV003 (n = 20) or placebo (n = 21) together with the daily gluten challenge. Duodenal biopsies were collected at baseline and after gluten challenge. The ratio of villus height to crypt depth and densities of intraepithelial lymphocytes were the primary end points. RESULTS: A daily dose of 2 g gluten was selected for the intervention study. Sixteen patients given ALV003 and 18 given placebo were eligible for efficacy evaluation. Biopsies from subjects in the placebo group showed evidence of mucosal injury after gluten challenge (mean villus height to crypt depth ratio changed from 2.8 before challenge to 2.0 afterward; P = .0007; density of CD3(+) intraepithelial lymphocytes changed from 61 to 91 cells/mm after challenge; P = .0003). However, no significant mucosal deterioration was observed in biopsies from the ALV003 group. Between groups, morphologic changes and CD3(+) intraepithelial lymphocyte counts differed significantly from baseline to week 6 (P = .0133 and P = .0123, respectively). There were no statistically significant differences in symptoms between groups. CONCLUSIONS: Based on a phase 2 trial, the glutenase ALV003 appears to attenuate gluten-induced small intestinal mucosal injury in patients with celiac disease in the context of an everyday gluten-free diet containing daily up to 2 g gluten.

   abstract = {OBJECTIVE: The aim was to investigate the mucosal activation of a broad range of genes associated with the T-helper 17 cell (Th17) signaling pathway in children at different stages of celiac disease (CD), including children with increased risk for CD and children with untreated and gluten-free diet (GFD)-treated CD. MATERIAL AND METHODS: Small intestinal biopsies were taken from children with untreated and GFD-treated CD, transglutaminase antibody (TGA)-positive children with potential CD, and reference children. Real-time polymerase chain reaction (PCR) arrays were used to study the gene expression pattern of Th17-related genes, and quantitative PCR was used to study the interleukin (IL)-17A expression. RESULTS: The mucosal expression of CD8A was elevated at all stages of CD. Children with untreated CD had diminished levels of IL-17RE, IL-23R, RORc, STAT6, CCL22, NFATC2, IL-18, CD4, CD247, and matrix metalloproteinase (MMP)9 but had elevated levels of MMP3, IL-17, interferon-gamma (IFN-gamma) and CD8A, compared to references. The majority of the aforementioned genes, being differentially expressed in untreated CD, displayed similar expression in GFD-treated children and references. Children with untreated and GFD-treated CD had elevated expression of IFN-gamma but had reduced expression of CD247. Interestingly, children with potential CD displayed reduced FOXP3, IL-21, and IL-17A levels. CONCLUSION: Mucosal upregulation of Th17 immunity occurs at the late stage of disease and is downregulated with dietary treatment, thus indicating that IL-17 immunity is not a fundamental feature of CD as Th1 immunity, which is not fully downregulated by GFD.},

In recent years, the impressive rise of Celiac Disease incidence, dramatically prompted changes in the dietary habit of an increasingly large population, with a rise in demand of gluten-free products. The formulation of gluten-free bakery products presents a formidable challenge to cereal technologists. As wheat gluten contributes to the formation of a strong protein network, that confers visco-elasticity to the dough and allows the wheat flour to be processed into a wide range of products, the preparation of cereal-based gluten-free products is a somehow difficult process. This review focuses on nutritional and technological quality of products made with gluten-free cereals available on the market. The possibility of using flour from naturally low toxic ancient wheat species or detoxified wheat for the diet of celiacs is also discussed.},

Patients may present with typical symptoms of enteropathy with diarrhoea and failure to thrive, but atypical symptoms, or even silent forms are more often recognized since serologic markers are available.

The prevalence is comparable from a country to another, around 0,7 to 2%. There is a progression with time from latent to silent form, and then to the active disease. The exclusion of the gluten from the diet leads to the regression from the active to the latent form of the disease.},

   abstract = {CONTEXT: Celiac disease is an autoimmune disorder of the small intestine associated with several extra-intestinal features, such as reproductive disorders. The relationship between celiac disease and infertility has been previously assessed, with conflicting results. OBJECTIVES: We seek to determine the relationship between celiac disease and infertility. METHODS: Data was extracted from case-control or cohort design studies from 1966 to December 2013 using the MEDLINE-Pubmed, EMBASE, LILACS and Cochrane Library databases. We analyzed two kinds of trials: those assessing the risk of infertility in subjects with already diagnosed celiac disease, and those evaluating the prevalence of undiagnosed celiac disease in subjects with a diagnosis of infertility. RESULTS: The search yielded 413 potentially relevant studies for revision, 12 of which were finally included for analysis. A significant association was found between women with a diagnosis of infertility and undiagnosed celiac disease [OR 3.09 (95% CI 1.74-5.49)]. When considering those studies assessing the occurrence of infertility in subjects with already-diagnosed celiac disease, no difference was found between celiac disease patients and control subjects [OR 0.99 (0.86-1.13)]. CONCLUSIONS: Undiagnosed celiac disease is a risk factor for infertility. Women seeking medical advice for this particular condition should be screened for celiac disease. Adoption of a gluten-free diet could have a positive impact on fertility in this group of patients.},

   abstract = {BACKGROUND: Celiac disease (CD) is an autoimmune disorder caused by an inappropriate immunological response to gluten ingestion in genetically susceptible individuals. IgA anti-tissue transglutaminase (tTG) antibodies have been widely employed as a specific biochemical marker for CD. Recent studies have also shown its usefulness in evaluating patient compliance with a gluten-free diet. METHODS: A group of 28 subjects with CD was selected for the study. Each fulfilled the requirement of a gluten-free diet for more than one year. IgA anti-tTG determination was performed every two months for half a year. These data were used to estimate the biological variation (BV) of IgA anti-tTG in celiac patients and to calculate the reference change value (RCV). RESULTS: The within-subject biological variation (CVI) and between-subject biological variation (CV(G)) were 19.2% and 75.6%, respectively, and the index of individuality was 0.25. The RCV calculated using these data together with our analytical imprecision (5.7%) was 55.5% for a 95% level of significance. CONCLUSIONS: We have determined for the first time the BV and the RCV for IgA anti-tTG in a celiac population. This value and the probability curve generated from our data could be a valuable tool for monitoring patients' adherence to dietary treatment.},

   abstract = {Celiac disease (CD) is frequently accompanied by a variety of extradigestive manifestations, thus making it a systemic disease rather than a disease limited to the gastrointestinal tract. This is primarily explained by the fact that CD belongs to the group of autoimmune diseases. The only one with a known etiology is related to a permanent intolerance to gluten. Remarkable breakthroughs have been achieved in the last decades, due to a greater interest in the diagnosis of atypical and asymptomatic patients, which are more frequent in adults. The known presence of several associated diseases provides guidance in the search of oligosymptomatic cases as well as studies performed in relatives of patients with CD. The causes for the onset and manifestation of associated diseases are diverse; some share a similar genetic base, like type 1 diabetes mellitus (T1D); others share pathogenic mechanisms, and yet, others are of unknown nature. General practitioners and other specialists must remember that CD may debut with extraintestinal manifestations, and associated illnesses may appear both at the time of diagnosis and throughout the evolution of the disease. The implementation of a gluten-free diet (GFD) improves the overall clinical course and influences the evolution of the associated diseases. In some cases, such as iron deficiency anemia, the GFD contributes to its disappearance. In other disorders, like T1D, this allows a better control of the disease. In several other complications and/or associated diseases, an adequate adherence to a GFD may slow down their evolution, especially if implemented during an early stage.},

   abstract = {BACKGROUND: Coeliac disease (CD), characterised by the presence of villous atrophy (VA) in the small intestine, is associated with increased mortality, but it is unknown if mortality is influenced by mucosal recovery. AIMS: To determine whether persistent VA is associated with mortality in CD. METHODS: Through biopsy reports from all pathology departments (n = 28) in Sweden, we identified 7648 individuals with CD (defined as VA) who had undergone a follow-up biopsy within 5 years following diagnosis. We used Cox regression to examine mortality according to follow-up biopsy. RESULTS: The mean age of CD diagnosis was 28.4; 63% were female; and the median follow-up after diagnosis was 11.5 years. The overall mortality rate of patients who underwent follow-up biopsy was lower than that of those who did not undergo follow-up biopsy (Hazard Ratio 0.88, 95% CI: 0.80-0.96). Of the 7648 patients who underwent follow-up biopsy, persistent VA was present in 3317 (43%). There were 606 (8%) deaths. Patients with persistent VA were not at increased risk of death compared with those with mucosal healing (HR: 1.01; 95% CI: 0.86-1.19). Mortality was not increased in children with persistent VA (HR: 1.09 95% CI: 0.37-3.16) or adults (HR 1.00 95% CI: 0.85-1.18), including adults older than age 50 years (HR: 0.96 95% CI: 0.80-1.14). CONCLUSIONS: Persistent villous atrophy is not associated with increased mortality in coeliac disease. While a follow-up biopsy will allow detection of refractory disease in symptomatic patients, in the select population of patients who undergo repeat biopsy, persistent villous atrophy is not useful in predicting future mortality.},

   abstract = {BACKGROUND: Celiac disease (CD) is associated with an increased risk for lymphoproliferative malignancy (LPM). Whether this risk is affected by the results of follow-up intestinal biopsy, performed to document mucosal healing, is unknown. OBJECTIVE: To examine the association between mucosal healing in CD and subsequent LPM. DESIGN: Population-based cohort study. SETTING: 28 pathology departments in Sweden. PATIENTS: 7625 patients with CD who had follow-up biopsy after initial diagnosis. MEASUREMENTS: The risk for LPM was compared with that of the general population by using expected rates. The rate of LPM in patients with persistent villous atrophy was compared with that of those with mucosal healing by using Cox regression. RESULTS: Among 7625 patients with CD and follow-up biopsy, 3308 (43%) had persistent villous atrophy. The overall risk for LPM was higher than that in the general population (standardized incidence ratio [SIR], 2.81 [95% CI, 2.10 to 3.67]) and was greater among patients with persistent villous atrophy (SIR, 3.78 [CI, 2.71 to 5.12]) than among those with mucosal healing (SIR, 1.50 [CI, 0.77 to 2.62]). Persistent villous atrophy compared with mucosal healing was associated with an increased risk for LPM (hazard ratio [HR], 2.26 [CI, 1.18 to 4.34]). The risk for T-cell lymphoma was increased (HR, 3.51 [CI, 0.75 to 16.34]) but not for B-cell lymphoma (HR, 0.97 [CI, 0.21 to 4.49]). LIMITATION: No data on dietary adherence. CONCLUSION: Increased risk for LPM in CD is associated with the follow-up biopsy results, with a higher risk among patients with persistent villous atrophy. Follow-up biopsy may effectively stratify patients with CD by risk for subsequent LPM.},

   abstract = {BACKGROUND: Villous atrophy (VA) with intraepithelial lymphocytosis is the histological hallmark of coeliac disease (CD), but reported rates of mucosal recovery are variable. AIM: To determine the impact of age and other demographic variables on the probability of persistent VA on follow-up biopsy. METHODS: We identified patients with VA on duodenal histology at all 28 Swedish pathology departments during the years spanning 1969-2008. We examined age, gender, calendar period, duration of disease and educational attainment to determine predictors of persistent VA. RESULTS: Of 7648 patients with CD who underwent follow-up biopsy, persistent VA was present in 3317 (43%; 95% CI 42-44%). The effect of age on persistent VA varied according to time period; among those biopsied in the years spanning 2000-2008, the prevalence of persistent VA was 31%, and increasing age was associated with increasing rates of persistent VA (17% among those younger than 2 years compared to 56% among those >/=70 years). In contrast, persistent VA did not vary widely by age in earlier years. On multivariate analysis (restricted to the calendar period 2000-2008, 2-5 years after CD diagnosis), persistent VA was more common among males (OR 1.43; 95% CI 1.07-1.90) and less common among patients with higher educational attainment (OR for college degree vs. <2 years of high school 0.52, 95% CI 0.35-0.78). CONCLUSIONS: The prevalence of persistent villous atrophy has changed over time, with greater rates of healing in recent years. Social differences in persistent villous atrophy suggest that access and/or education regarding the gluten-free diet impact mucosal healing.},

   abstract = {BACKGROUND AND AIM: Isotretinoin, a vitamin A analogue, can promote a pro-inflammatory milieu in the small intestine in response to dietary antigens. We hypothesized that oral isotretinoin exposure would increase the risk of celiac disease (CD). METHODS: We contacted all 28 pathology departments in Sweden, and through biopsy reports identified 26,739 individuals with CD. We then compared the prevalence of ever using oral isotretinoin to the prevalence in 134,277 matched controls through conditional logistic regression. Data on isotretinoin exposure were obtained from the national Swedish Prescribed Drug Registry. As the only indication for isotretinoin use in Sweden is acne, we also examined its relationship to CD. Data on acne were obtained from the Swedish Patient Registry. RESULTS: Ninety-three individuals with CD (0.35 %) and 378 matched controls (0.28 %) had a prescription of isotretinoin. This corresponded to an odds ratio (OR) of 1.22 [95 % confidence interval (CI) 0.97-1.54]. Risk estimates were similar in men and women, and when we restricted our data to individuals diagnosed after the start of the Prescribed Drug Registry. Restricting our analyses to individuals diagnosed aged 12-45 years did not influence the risk estimates (OR 1.38, 95 % CI 0.97-1.97). Meanwhile, having a diagnosis of acne was positively associated with CD (OR 1.34, 95 % CI 1.20-1.51). CONCLUSIONS: This study found no association between isotretinoin use and CD, but a small excess risk of CD in patients with a diagnosis of acne.},

   abstract = {OBJECTIVE: Coeliac disease is defined by gluten responsiveness, yet there are few data on gluten challenge (GC) in adults on a gluten-free diet. Lack of data regarding the kinetics of responses to gluten is a limitation in clinical practice and research when GC is performed. DESIGN: 20 adults with biopsy-proven coeliac disease participated. The study included two run-in visits followed by a 14-day GC at a randomly assigned dose of 3 or 7.5 g of gluten/day. Study visits occurred 3, 7, 14 and 28 days after starting GC. Duodenal biopsy was performed during the run-in and at days 3 and 14 of GC. Villous height to crypt depth ratio (Vh:Cd) and intraepithelial lymphocyte (IEL) count/100 enterocytes were measured by two pathologists. Antibodies to tissue transglutaminase and deamidated gliadin peptides, lactulose to mannitol ratio (LAMA) and symptoms were assessed at each visit. RESULTS: Significant reduction in Vh:Cd (2.2-1.1, p<0.001) and increase in IELs (32.6-51.8, p<0.001) were seen from baseline to day 14. Antibody titres increased slightly from baseline to day 14 of GC but markedly by day 28. LAMA did not change significantly. Gastrointestinal symptoms increased significantly by day 3 and returned to baseline by day 28. No differences were seen between the two gluten doses. CONCLUSIONS: 14 day GC at >/= 3 g of gluten/day induces histological and serological changes in the majority of adults with coeliac disease. These data permit accurate design of clinical trials and indicate that many individuals will meet coeliac diagnostic criteria after a 2-week GC.},

Studies concerning adverse reaction to foods are mentioned and the possible role of food allergy and food intolerances, especially pseudoallergic reactions to biogenes amines, in symptom provocation is discussed. The known effects of lactose deficiency and fructose malabsorption are reviewed. The FODMAP concept (fermentable oligo-, di-, monosaccharides and polyols) is presented in more detail and recent studies on pathophysiological effects of FODMAP constituents and of therapeutic effects of a low FODMAP diet on symptoms in patients with irritable bowel syndrome are discussed. Finally, studies on the new disorder non-celiac gluten sensitivity (NCGS) are summarized and the state of the discussion whether wheat intolerance is due to gluten or the grains is given.},

   abstract = {The association between coeliac disease and type 1 diabetes has long been established. The combination of genetic susceptibility along with a potential role for gluten in the pathogenesis of autoimmunity makes defining gluten's role in type 1 diabetes extremely important. Evidence supporting the role of a gluten-free diet to improve complications associated with type 1 diabetes is not robust. However there is evidence to support improved growth, bone density and potentially the prevention of additional autoimmune diseases in patients with coeliac disease and type 1 diabetes. The gluten free diet is expensive and challenging to adhere to in people already on a modified diet. Early identification of those who have coeliac disease and would benefit from a gluten-free diet is of utmost importance to prevent complications associated with type 1 diabetes and coeliac disease.},

   abstract = {The incidence of allergy and autoimmune disease in the US and other industrialized nations is increasing, and gluten-related disorders are no exception. The US has documented a profound rise in celiac disease that cannot be fully explained by improved serological techniques or better recognition by physicians. Non-celiac gluten sensitivity, a condition only recently recognized by the medical community, has become a commonly diagnosed entity. Proteins, including gluten are increasingly being identified as a source of wheat allergy. Although the gluten free diet represents a safe and effective treatment for these conditions, there is still much to be learned about the development of gluten-related disorders and the apparent increase in incidence within the US. In this article, we present a review of current knowledge on the epidemiology of gluten-related disorders within a global context, with a focus on diagnostic trends and the evaluation of potential risk factors.},

   abstract = {Celiac disease is a chronic immune-mediated condition that develops in genetically predisposed individuals. It is characterized by the presence of circulating auto-antibodies in addition to an enteropathy and at times, other extra-intestinal manifestations triggered by exposure to the gliadin fraction of gluten, a family of proteins found in wheat, barley, and rye. There seems to be a rise in reported adverse reactions to gluten, an entity currently termed non-celiac gluten (or perhaps more accurately, wheat) sensitivity, where neither the enteropathy nor the auto-antibodies are present. Celiac disease has protean extra-intestinal manifestations, and an accurate diagnosis should be sought in people suffering from seemingly unrelated complaints, such as fatigue, anorexia, delayed puberty, short stature, decreased bone density, unusual skin rashes, unexplained iron deficiency, and infertility. The presence of an enteropathy, in conjunction with the positive serology, is considered the diagnostic gold standard for making the diagnosis of celiac disease. It is important to stress that the elimination of gluten, even in asymptomatic patients, brings about health benefits, particularly in relation to bone health, as well as a decrease in the incidence of small bowel malignancy, especially lymphoma. Better understanding of the pathophysiology of celiac disease and the molecular mechanisms involved in antigen recognition and processing has provided the impetus for the development of pharmacologic agents that might block the recognition of gluten and its conversion to a toxic antigenic target. Inhibition of tight junction dysregulation could also prevent or minimize the damage triggered by gluten. Work on genetically modified wheat cultivars has progressed, and the possibility of a vaccine to block the immune mediated trigger is being actively investigated. Education and guidance by a knowledgeable nutritionist or registered dietitian can go a long way in minimizing the stress and facilitating the acceptance of the diet and the life-style changes that it represents.},

   abstract = {BACKGROUND: Mild impairments of cognition or 'Brain fog' are often reported by patients with coeliac disease but the nature of these impairments has not been systematically investigated. AIM: This longitudinal pilot study investigated relationships between cognitive function and mucosal healing in people with newly diagnosed coeliac disease commencing a gluten-free diet. METHODS: Eleven patients (8 females, 3 males), mean age 30 (range 22-39) years, were tested with a battery of cognitive tests at weeks 0, 12 and 52. Information processing efficacy, memory, visuospatial ability, motoric function and attention were tested. Small bowel biopsies were collected via routine gastroscopy at weeks 12 and 52 and were compared to baseline Marsh scores. Cognitive performance was compared to serum concentrations of tissue transglutaminase antibodies, biopsy outcomes and other biological markers. RESULTS: All patients had excellent adherence to the diet. Marsh scores improved significantly (P = 0.001, Friedman's test) and tissue transglutaminase antibody concentrations decreased from a mean of 58.4 at baseline to 16.8 U/mL at week 52 (P = 0.025). Four of the cognitive tests assessing verbal fluency, attention and motoric function showed significant improvement over the 12 months and strongly correlated with the Marsh scores and tissue transglutaminase antibody levels (r = 0.377-0.735; all P < 0.05). However, no meaningful patterns of correlations were found for nutritional or biochemical markers, or markers of intestinal permeability. CONCLUSIONS: In newly diagnosed coeliac disease, cognitive performance improves with adherence to the gluten-free diet in parallel to mucosal healing. Suboptimal levels of cognition in untreated coeliac disease may affect the performance of everyday tasks.},

   abstract = {BACKGROUND: The relationship between the risk of celiac disease and both the age at which gluten is introduced to a child's diet and a child's early dietary pattern is unclear. METHODS: We randomly assigned 832 newborns who had a first-degree relative with celiac disease to the introduction of dietary gluten at 6 months (group A) or 12 months (group B). The HLA genotype was determined at 15 months of age, and serologic screening for celiac disease was evaluated at 15, 24, and 36 months and at 5, 8, and 10 years. Patients with positive serologic findings underwent intestinal biopsies. The primary outcome was the prevalence of celiac disease autoimmunity and of overt celiac disease among the children at 5 years of age. RESULTS: Of the 707 participants who remained in the trial at 36 months, 553 had a standard-risk or high-risk HLA genotype and completed the study. At 2 years of age, significantly higher proportions of children in group A than in group B had celiac disease autoimmunity (16% vs. 7%, P=0.002) and overt celiac disease (12% vs. 5%, P=0.01). At 5 years of age, the between-group differences were no longer significant for autoimmunity (21% in group A and 20% in group B, P=0.59) or overt disease (16% and 16%, P=0.78 by the log-rank test). At 10 years, the risk of celiac disease autoimmunity was far higher among children with high-risk HLA than among those with standard-risk HLA (38% vs. 19%, P=0.001), as was the risk of overt celiac disease (26% vs. 16%, P=0.05). Other variables, including breast-feeding, were not associated with the development of celiac disease. CONCLUSIONS: Neither the delayed introduction of gluten nor breast-feeding modified the risk of celiac disease among at-risk infants, although the later introduction of gluten was associated with a delayed onset of disease. A high-risk HLA genotype was an important predictor of disease. (Funded by the Fondazione Celiachia of the Italian Society for Celiac Disease; CELIPREV ClinicalTrials.gov number, NCT00639444.).},

   abstract = {Celiac disease is an immune-mediated disorder triggered by gluten in genetically susceptible persons. Despite its detrimental effects on human health, it has not disappeared over time. The current evolutionary theory is that celiac disease is more common in areas reached later by agricultural revolution than in countries that started consumption of wheat earlier, due to negative selection caused by celiac disease. We reviewed data on worldwide prevalence of celiac disease, wheat consumption, and frequencies of HLA-celiac-disease-predisposing-genotypes to investigate their mutual relationship. Studies assessing prevalence of celiac disease were identified through a MEDLINE search. Wheat consumption and frequencies of HLA-DQ2-DQ8 were obtained from Food and Agriculture Organization of the United Nations and allelefrequencies.net database. Correlations between celiac disease, wheat consumption, and HLA were analyzed by linear regression. We observed a significant correlation between wheat consumption and HLA DQ2 (p=0.01) and the sum of DQ2 and DQ8 (p=0.01) frequencies. Wheat consumption and HLA-DQ2 tend to co-localize in different continents. The correlation between the prevalence of celiac disease and either DQ2 and/or DQ8, or the product of DQ2+DQ8*wheat consumption was not statistically significant. Co-localization of gluten consumption and HLA-celiac-disease-predisposing-genotypes can be explained by positive selection of HLA-DQ2 genes in wheat-consuming areas, and "demic diffusion" of Middle East farmers into Europe.},

   abstract = {Adherence to a gluten-free diet (GFD) for nonceliac athletes (NCA) has become increasingly popular despite a paucity of supportive medical or ergogenic evidence. This study aimed to quantify the demographics of NCA and determine associated experiences, perceptions, and sources of information related to GFD. Athletes (n = 910, female = 528, no gender selected = 5) completed a 17-question online survey. Forty-one percent of NCA respondents, including 18-world and/or Olympic medalists, follow a GFD 50-100% of the time (GFD > 50): only 13% for treatment of reported medical conditions with 57% self-diagnosing their gluten sensitivity. The GFD > 50 group characteristics included predominantly endurance sport athletes (70.0%) at the recreationally competitive level (32.3%), between 31 and 40 years of age (29.1%). Those who follow a GFD > 50 reported experiencing, abdominal/gastrointestinal (GI) symptoms alone (16.7%) or in conjunction with two (30.7%) or three (35.7%) additional symptoms (e.g., fatigue) believed to be triggered by gluten. Eighty-four percent of GFD > 50 indicated symptom improvement with gluten-removal. Symptom-based and non-symptom-based self-diagnosed gluten-sensitivity (56.7%) was the primary reason for adopting a GFD. Leading sources of GFD information were online (28.7%), trainer/coach (26.2%) and other athletes (17.4%). Although 5-10% of the general population is estimated to benefit clinically from a GFD a higher prevalence of GFD adherence was found in NCA (41.2%). Prescription of a GFD among many athletes does not result from evidence-based practice suggesting that adoption of a GFD in the majority of cases was not based on medical rationale and may be driven by perception that gluten removal provides health benefits and an ergogenic edge in NCA.},

   abstract = {Small bowel intraepithelial lymphocytosis (IL) may depend from different causes, including celiac disease (CD). Demonstration of increased number of duodenal T cell receptor gamma-delta (TCRgammadelta) positive intraepithelial lymphocytes (IELs) has been used to support CD diagnosis on frozen material. This work evaluates a new commercially available anti-TCRgamma antibody on formalin-fixed paraffin embedded (FFPE) small bowel biopsies. Anti-CD3 and anti-TCR CgammaM1 (clone gamma3.20) from Thermo Scientific were applied by immunohistochemistry on 59 FFPE biopsies from 18 cases of CD with mild/severe atrophy, 19 cases of IL in CD patients on gluten-free diet (IL-GFD), 14 cases of IL (6/14 with positive CD-related serology), and 8 controls (CTR) with mild duodenitis and negative CD serology and genotyping. IELs/100 epithelial cells were counted in at least six high power fields. CD3+ and TCRgamma+ IELs were significantly higher in CD, IL-GFD, and IL compared with CTR, but in contrast to CD3+ IELs, TCRgamma+ IELs were significantly increased in CD and IL-GFD compared with IL. Furthermore, TCRgamma+ IELs discriminated between IL with negative and positive CD-related serology (p = 0.02). TCRgamma+ IELs can be identified on FFPE samples and their evaluation adds useful information for the work-up of small bowel biopsies in CD diagnosis. In fact, TCRgamma staining coupled with CD3, may represent an additional tool to recognize cases of latent/potential CD when serology and clinical data are not conclusive or when the histological diagnosis remains equivocal.},

   abstract = {BACKGROUND: Overexpression of autologous proteins can lead to the formation of autoantibodies and autoimmune diseases. MHC class I polypeptide-related sequence A (MICA) is highly expressed in the enterocytes of patients with celiac disease, which arises in response to gluten. The aim of this study was to investigate anti-MICA antibody formation in patients with celiac disease and its association with other autoimmune processes. METHODS: We tested serum samples from 383 patients with celiac disease, obtained before they took up a gluten-free diet, 428 patients with diverse autoimmune diseases, and 200 controls for anti-MICA antibodies. All samples were also tested for anti-endomysium and anti-transglutaminase antibodies. RESULTS: Antibodies against MICA were detected in samples from 41.7% of patients with celiac disease but in only 3.5% of those from controls (P <0.0001) and 8.2% from patients with autoimmune disease (P <0.0001). These antibodies disappeared after the instauration of a gluten-free diet. Anti-MICA antibodies were significantly prevalent in younger patients (P <0.01). Fifty-eight patients with celiac disease (15.1%) presented a concomitant autoimmune disease. Anti-MICA-positive patients had a higher risk of autoimmune disease than MICA antibody-negative patients (P <0.0001; odds ratio = 6.11). The risk was even higher when we also controlled for age (odds ratio = 11.69). Finally, we found that the associated risk of developing additional autoimmune diseases was 16 and 10 times as high in pediatric patients and adults with anti-MICA, respectively, as in those without. CONCLUSIONS: The development of anti-MICA antibodies could be related to a gluten-containing diet, and seems to be involved in the development of autoimmune diseases in patients with celiac disease, especially younger ones.},

   abstract = {BACKGROUND/AIMS: Non-celiac gluten sensitivity has been increasingly recognized as a predisposing factor for irritable bowel syndrome (IBS)-like symptoms in Western populations where celiac disease (CD) is relatively common. In Asia where CD is rare, we wish to de-termine the prevalence of gluten protein associated serology in IBS patients, which has not been formally studied, and its rela-tion to histological and human leukocyte antigen (HLA) markers. METHODS: We reviewed a consecutive cohort of Asian patients with IBS, who had undergone serologic testing for IgA against deamidated gliadin peptide antibodies (IgA DGP) and IgA anti-endomysium antibodies, and who also had duodenal biopsies during clinical workup. In addition, a subset of Chinese patients with positive serology was further tested for HLA-DQ2 and HLA-DQ8. RESULTS: Of 186 patients, 34 (18%) were positive for IgA DGP; bloating, abdominal pain, belching and diarrhea were the most com-monly reported symptoms but diarrhea as the most bothersome symptom was significantly more common in IgA DGP positive patients. Mildly increased intra-epithelial lymphocytes on duodenal biopsy was also more common (29% vs. 9%, P = 0.001). Nine of 21 Chinese patients tested as IgA DGP positive undertook HLA-DQ2/DQ8 testing, with only 2 being positive for HLA-DQ8. All patients with positive IgA DGP reported symptom improvement with gluten withdrawal. CONCLUSIONS: We have described a series of Asian, mainly Chinese, patients with IBS who were tested positive for IgA DGP, and improved on a gluten exclusion diet. We believe this is the first report of non-celiac gluten sensitivity in Asia, a region where CD is uncommon.},

   abstract = {BACKGROUND: The relationship between eosinophilic oesophagitis (EoE) and coeliac disease (CD) remains controversial, with studies yielding varied results. AIM: To systematically review the evidence of a possible association between both diseases. METHODS: Electronic searches were performed with keywords relating to EoE and CD in the MEDLINE, EMBASE and SCOPUS databases. Summary estimates were calculated. A random-effects model was used depending on heterogeneity (I(2) ). Publication bias was assessed with the aid of funnel plot analysis, along with the Begg-Mazumdar, Harbord and Egger tests. RESULTS: The search yielded 197 references; 30 were included in the quantitative summary, with most of these presenting methodological inconsistencies. Significant publication bias in favour of short studies reporting positive associations between both diseases was documented. The prevalence of EoE in CD ranged from 0% to 10.7% (I(2) = 78.9%). Prevalence of CD in EoE varied between 0.16% and 57.1% (I(2) = 89%). One high-quality, prospective, randomly selected, population-based study documented a 1.1% prevalence of CD, with no patients presenting EoE. Clinical and methodological heterogeneity hindered the performance of quantitative summaries for prevalence data. A gluten-free diet was effective in achieving histological remission of EoE in 32.1% of coeliac patients (95% confidence interval, 14.9-52.2%; I(2) = 52.2%), which was similar to that expected for wheat elimination in EoE patients. CONCLUSIONS: While a lack of valid studies prevents us from completely ruling out a true association between EoE and CD, currently available evidence does not support this hypothesis. Indeed, the only epidemiological study with sufficient validity points to the independence of both diseases.},

   abstract = {INTRODUCTION AND OBJECTIVES: coeliac disease (CD) affects around 1-2 % of the world population. Most patients are now diagnosed when adults, suffering the consequences of an impaired bone mineralization. This review aims to provide an updated discussion on the relationship between low bone mineral density (BMD), osteopenia and osteoporosis, and CD. METHODS: a PubMed search restricted to the last 15 years was conducted. Sources cited in the results were also reviewed to identify potential sources of information. RESULTS: low BMD affects up to 75 % of celiac patients, and can be found at any age, independently of positive serological markers and presence of digestive symptoms. The prevalence of CD among osteoporotic patients is also significantly increased. Two theories try to explain this origin of low BMD: Micronutrients malabsorption (including calcium and vitamin D) determined by villous atrophy has been related to secondary hyperparathyroidism and incapacity to achieve the potential bone mass peak; chronic inflammation was also related with RANKL secretion, osteoclasts activation and increased bone resorption. As a consequence, celiac patients have a risk for bone fractures that exceed 40 % that of matched non-affected population. Treatment of low BMD in CD comprises gluten-free diet, calcium and vitamin D supplementation, and biphosphonates, although its effects on CD have not been specifically assessed. CONCLUSIONS: up to 75 % of celiac patients and 40 % of that diagnosed in adulthood present a low BMD and a variable increase in the risk of bone fractures. Epidemiological changes in CD make bone density scans more relevant for adult coeliacs.},

   abstract = {OBJECTIVE: The literature suggests a lack of consensus on the use of terms related to coeliac disease (CD) and gluten. DESIGN: A multidisciplinary task force of 16 physicians from seven countries used the electronic database PubMed to review the literature for CD-related terms up to January 2011. Teams of physicians then suggested a definition for each term, followed by feedback of these definitions through a web survey on definitions, discussions during a meeting in Oslo and phone conferences. In addition to 'CD', the following descriptors of CD were evaluated (in alphabetical order): asymptomatic, atypical, classical, latent, non-classical, overt, paediatric classical, potential, refractory, silent, subclinical, symptomatic, typical, CD serology, CD autoimmunity, genetically at risk of CD, dermatitis herpetiformis, gluten, gluten ataxia, gluten intolerance, gluten sensitivity and gliadin-specific antibodies. RESULTS: CD was defined as 'a chronic small intestinal immune-mediated enteropathy precipitated by exposure to dietary gluten in genetically predisposed individuals'. Classical CD was defined as 'CD presenting with signs and symptoms of malabsorption. Diarrhoea, steatorrhoea, weight loss or growth failure is required.' 'Gluten-related disorders' is the suggested umbrella term for all diseases triggered by gluten and the term gluten intolerance should not to be used. Other definitions are presented in the paper. CONCLUSION: This paper presents the Oslo definitions for CD-related terms.},

The term non-celiac gluten sensitivity has been widely adopted to describe a clinical entity characterized by symptoms induced by gluten without the diagnostic criteria found in other gluten-related disorders. However, it has not been shown that gluten per se is involved, and it can be debated if the condition is a disease. Nevertheless, a large number of individuals go gluten-free, avoiding wheat, rye and barley, even without a defined medical cause. In a study in BMC Medicine, Volta and colleagues from Italy report on a large, multicenter attempt to enumerate the prevalence of non-celiac gluten sensitivity in secondary gastroenterology care. They found that approximately 3% of their more than 12,000 patients fulfilled their criteria for non-celiac gluten sensitivity. However, we are still challenged with finding stricter clinical criteria for the condition, developing a usable clinical approach for gluten challenge in these individuals, and understanding the pathogenesis of the condition.},

   abstract = {PURPOSE OF REVIEW: To summarize the recent advances in coeliac disease. RECENT FINDINGS: Details of the polygenic nature of coeliac disease with the human leukocyte antigen (HLA) locus as the dominating genetic element have been uncovered. The existence of a large number of non-HLA coeliac disease genes, only partly shared by each individual patient, suggests the genetic heterogeneity of the disease. The critical role for HLA-DQ-restricted CD4 T cells recognizing antigenic gluten peptides is further substantiated. Involvement of CD8 T cells has received new attention. Other components of wheat than gluten, in particular the amylase trypsin inhibitors, may also play a role. The disease is becoming more prevalent. New guidelines state that coeliac disease diagnosis in children can be made on the basis of clinical signs, serology and genetics without the need of biopsy. The clinical entity 'noncoeliac gluten sensitivity' has received much attention, but diagnostic and pathophysiological definitions are still elusive. The risk for mortality and morbidity in coeliac disease is less than previously thought. SUMMARY: Our understanding of the basic and clinical aspects of coeliac disease increases. Coeliac disease stands out as a major health problem of almost global occurrence. Case finding, distinguishing coeliac disease from other gluten-sensitive conditions, better care and balanced use of resources are the current challenges.},

Among the atrophic gastritides, there are two forms caused by autoimmune processes and long-term Helicobacter pylori persistence, whose treatment is an effective measure in refractory anemia.

   abstract = {BACKGROUND: The deamidated gliadin peptides (DGP) cross linked to human tissue transglutaminase (tTg) comprises a novel neo-epitope structure (Neo-tTg) for serological screening of celiac disease (CD). Our aim is to verify anti-Neo-tTg IgA and IgG in adults with dermatitis herpetiformis (DH). METHODS: Multi-centric retrospective evaluation of the IgA/G autoantibodies in sera of DH patients on a regular diet (n=40) and a gluten restricted diet (GRD, n=53) and control adults with autoimmune skin diseases (n=107) by ELISA. RESULTS: The sensitivities of Celicheck Neo IgA/G (76%, 95% CI 67-84%) and the Neo tTg-A (85%, 95% CI 70-97%) ELISA were significantly greater than that of tTg-A (56%, 95% CI 46-67%), eTg-A (62%, 95% CI 52-72%), DGP-A (55%, 95% CI 55-65%), DGP-G (61%, 95% CI 51-71%), Glia-A (55%, 95% CI 45-65%) and Glia-G (56%, 95% CI 46-66%) ELISA. The specificities of all 8 ELISA were in the range of 90-100%. The area under the curve (AUC) of receiver operator characteristic curve (ROC) for the two Neo-tTg ELISA (0.863 and 0.949) were higher than the AUCs for ROCs of tTg, DGP and eTG ELISA (range between 0.657 and 0.783). The autoantibody levels of DH patients on a normal diet were significantly higher than those on GRD in the Celicheck Neo IgA/IgG, NeotTg-A; tTg-A and the eTg-A; ELISA (p<0.01) and of no significance in the DGP and Gliadin ELISA. CONCLUSION: Neo-epitope IgA autoantibodies represent a new and sensitive serological marker of DH.},

   abstract = {Celiac disease (CD) is an immune-mediated systemic condition triggered by dietary gluten occurring in genetically susceptible individuals. Our understanding of its numerous and varied clinical presentations has evolved over time, which has contributed to the incidence of CD increasing. In most cases, the diagnosis is readily established and patients promptly improve after commencing a gluten-free diet (GFD). However, in some, the diagnosis is not straightforward and presents a challenge to clinicians. Potential dilemmas include those with positive serology but normal histology, negative serology but abnormal duodenal mucosal histology, failure to respond to a GFD or response to a GFD without evidence of CD. In recent years, development of new assays and modifications to existing diagnostic algorithms for CD has also challenged the traditional role of small-bowel histology as critical in CD diagnosis.},

   abstract = {BACKGROUND: The treatment of celiac disease is a strict, life-long gluten-free (GF) diet. This diet is complex and can be challenging. Factors affecting adherence to the GF diet are important to identify for improving adherence. OBJECTIVE: To identify factors that inhibit or improve adherence to a GF diet in children with celiac disease. METHODS: Patients (<18 years of age) with biopsy-confirmed celiac disease followed by the gastroenterology service at a tertiary care paediatric institution were surveyed using a mailed questionnaire. Factors influencing adherence to a GF diet were scored from 1 to 10 based on how often they were problematic (1 = never, 10 = always). Parents of patients <13 years of age were instructed to complete the survey with their child. Adolescents >/=13 years of age were asked to complete the survey themselves. RESULTS: Of 253 subjects, 126 completed the survey; the median age was 12 years (range two to 18 years). Forty percent were adolescents. Overall, participants reported good adherence at home and school, but lower adherence at social events. Adolescents reported lower adherence compared with parents. Availability of GF foods and cost were the most significant barriers. Other factors identified to help with a GF diet included education for schools/restaurants and improved government support. CONCLUSIONS: Availability, cost and product labelling are major barriers to adherence to a GF diet. Better awareness, improved labelling and income support are needed to help patients.},

   abstract = {BACKGROUND: The consequences of subclinical coeliac disease (CD) in Type 1 diabetes mellitus (T1DM) remain unclear. We looked at growth, anthropometry and disease management in children with dual diagnosis (T1DM + CD) before and after CD diagnosis. METHODS: Anthropometry, glycated haemoglobin (HbA1c) and IgA tissue transglutaminase (tTg) were collected prior to, and following CD diagnosis in 23 children with T1DM + CD. This group was matched for demographics, T1DM duration, age at CD diagnosis and at T1DM onset with 23 CD and 44 T1DM controls. RESULTS: No differences in growth or anthropometry were found between children with T1DM + CD and controls at any time point. Children with T1DM + CD, had higher BMI z-score two years prior to, than at CD diagnosis (p < 0.001). BMI z-score change one year prior to CD diagnosis was lower in the T1DM + CD than the T1DM group (p = 0.009). At two years, height velocity and change in BMI z-scores were similar in all groups. No differences were observed in HbA1c between the T1DM + CD and T1DM groups before or after CD diagnosis. More children with T1DM + CD had raised tTg levels one year after CD diagnosis than CD controls (CDx to CDx + 1 yr; T1DM + CD: 100% to 71%, p = 0.180 and CD: 100% to 45%, p < 0.001); by two years there was no difference. CONCLUSIONS: No major nutrition or growth deficits were observed in children with T1DM + CD. CD diagnosis does not impact on T1DM glycaemic control. CD specific serology was comparable to children with single CD, but those with dual diagnosis may need more time to adjust to gluten free diet.},

We surveyed patients with CD to determine if dietitian use is associated with quality of life, symptom severity, or GFD adherence. The survey utilized three validated CD-specific instruments: the CD quality of life (CD-QOL), CD symptom index (CSI) and CD adherence test (CDAT). Four hundred and thirteen patients with biopsy-proven CD were eligible for inclusion. The majority (77%) were female and mean BMI was 24.1. Over three-quarters of patients (326, 79%) had seen a dietitian, however, 161 (39%) had seen a dietitian only once. Age, sex, and education level were not associated with dietitian use; nor was BMI (24.6 vs. 24.0, p = 0.45). On multivariate analysis, adjusting for age gender, education, duration of disease, and body mass index, dietitian use was not associated with CD-QOL, CSI, or CDAT scores. Our survey did not show an association between dietitian use and symptom severity, adherence, or quality of life. Delay in diagnosis was associated with poorer outcomes. This is a preliminary study with several limitations, and further prospective analysis is needed to evaluate the benefits and cost-effectiveness of dietitian-referral in the care of celiac disease patients.},

Herein we report and discuss the first case of patient who presented simultaneously with these two rare diseases. It is a 54-year-old man who stopped gluten-free diet after 15 years history of celiac disease. The diagnosis was based on the histological examination of duodenal biopsy and the diagnosis of primary sclerosing cholangitis was made on liver biopsy, as well as the magnetic resonance cholangiogram. The treatment of EATL is mainly based on chemotherapy in addition to the optimal management of complications and adverse events that impact on the response to treatment and clinical outcomes, although the prognosis remains remarkably very poor.},

   abstract = {At present, strict and lifelong gluten-free diet is the only effective treatment for celiac disease. Even small amounts of gluten (50 mg/day) can be immunogenic; therefore all food and food items and drugs that contain gluten and its derivatives must be eliminated completely from the diet. While prescribing gluten-free diet is easy; the key to the success is the dietary counseling by a nutrition specialist and maintenance of adherence to GFD by the patient. In recent times, a number of targets to halt the process of immunological injury have been explored to find out alternative treatment for celiac disease. These targets include exploration of ancient wheat if they are less immunogenic, intra-luminal digestion of gluten using prolylendopeptidases, pretreatment of whole gluten with bacterial-derived peptidase before ingestion; prevention of passage of immunogenic peptides through the tight junctions such as zonulin antagonists, Blocking of HLA-DQ2 to prevent binding of immunogenic peptides, inhibition of transglutaminase 2, immune-modulation, and induction of tolerance to gluten using gluten tolerizing vaccines, use of gluten-sequestering polymers, use of anti-inflammatory drugs (glucocorticoids, budesonides) and anti-cytokines such as anti TNF-alpha, and anti-interleukin-15. While many of these targets are still in the pre-clinical phase, some of them including zonulin antagonist and endopeptidases have already reached phase II and phase III clinical trials. Furthermore, while these targets appear very exciting; they at best are likely to be used as adjunctive therapy rather than a complete replacement for gluten-free diet.},

In many Asian nations, CD is still considered to be either nonexistent or very rare. In recognition of such heterogeneity of knowledge and awareness, the World Gastroenterology Organization and the Asian Pacific Association of Gastroenterology commissioned a working party to address the key issues in emergence of CD in Asia. METHODS: A working group consisting of members from Asia-Pacific region, Europe, North America, and South America reviewed relevant existing literature with focus on those issues specific to Asia-Pacific region both in terms of what exists and what needs to be done. RESULTS: The working group identified the gaps in epidemiology, diagnosis, and management of CD in Asian-Pacific region and recommended the following: to establish prevalence of CD across region, increase in awareness about CD among physicians and patients, and recognition of atypical manifestations of CD. The challenges such as variability in performance of serological tests, lack of population-specific cut-offs values for a positive test, need for expert dietitians for proper counseling and supervision of patients, need for gluten-free infrastructure in food supply and creation of patient advocacy organizations were also emphasized. CONCLUSIONS: Although absolute number of patients with CD at present is not very large, this number is expected to increase over the next few years or decades. It is thus appropriate that medical community across the Asia-Pacific region define extent of problem and get prepared to handle impending epidemic of CD.},

On the diet, the small intestinal mucosal injury heals and gluten-induced symptoms and signs disappear. The mucosal healing is a prerequisite for sustaining health and is also obtained with a diet containing oats and trace amounts of gluten, industrially purified wheat starch-based gluten-free products. The small intestinal mucosa does not heal in noncompliant people, nor when a patient is inadvertently ingesting gluten. Development of adjunctive or alternative therapies is on its way. There are several novel treatment pipelines within academy and industry. Examples are the ideas of using glutenases as a drug to degrade the ingested gluten, polymers to bind and sequester the gluten to the feces, and also vaccine development for an immunotherapy to induce tolerance towards gluten. Clinical drug trials are to be foreseen in CD, soon also in children.},

Celiac disease is extremely various and anaemia, oral aphthous stomatis, amenorrhea or articular symptoms may be the only revealing symptoms. Diagnosis releases on evidence of histological villous atrophy in proximal small bowel and presence of specific serum antibodies. Treatment relies on eviction of gluten. Gluten free diet allows prevention of malignant complications such as small bowel adenocarcinoma and lymphoma and osteopenia. The main cause of resistance to gluten free diet is its bad observance. On the contrary, serious complications of celiac disease, such as clonal refractory celiac sprue and intestinal T-cell lymphoma need to be screen.},

RECENT FINDINGS: RCD has been subdivided into two subgroups according to the normal [type I RCD (RCDI)] or abnormal phenotype of intraepithelial lymphocytes [type II RCD (RCDII)]. RCDII is considered as a low-grade intraepithelial lymphoma and has a very poor prognosis, leading to intractable ulcerative jejunitis, gastrointestinal and extra-intestinal dissemination of the abnormal intraepithelial lymphocytes, and to their frequent transformation into a high-grade invasive lymphoma. SUMMARY: Herein, we review here the distinctive diagnostic features of RCDI and RCDII, the risk of developing overt lymphoma and different therapeutic approaches.},

   abstract = {BACKGROUND: A significant percentage of the general population report problems caused by wheat and/or gluten ingestion, even though they do not have celiac disease (CD) or wheat allergy (WA), because they test negative both for CD-specific serology and histopathology and for immunoglobulin E (IgE)-mediated assays. Most patients report both gastrointestinal and nongastrointestinal symptoms, and all report improvement of symptoms on a gluten-free diet. This clinical condition has been named non-celiac gluten sensitivity (NCGS). AIM: We attempt to define the current pathogenic, clinical, and diagnostic criteria of this "new" disease, to provide a practical view that might be useful to evaluate, diagnose, and manage NCGS patients. METHODS: We reviewed the international literature through PubMed and Medline, using the search terms "wheat (hyper)sensitivity," "wheat allergy," "wheat intolerance," "gluten (hyper)sensitivity," and "gluten intolerance," and we discuss current knowledge about NCGS. RESULTS: It has been demonstrated that patients suffering from NCGS are a heterogeneous group, composed of several subgroups, each characterized by different pathogenesis, clinical history, and, probably, clinical course. NCGS diagnosis can be reached only by excluding CD and WA. Recent evidence shows that a personal history of food allergy in infancy, coexistent atopy, positive for immunoglobulin G (IgG) antigliadin antibodies and flow cytometric basophil activation test, with wheat and duodenal and/or ileum-colon intraepithelial and lamina propria eosinophil counts, could be useful to identify NCGS patients. CONCLUSIONS: Future research should aim to identify reliable biomarkers for NCGS diagnosis and to better define the different NCGS subgroups. Key teaching points: * Most patients report both gastrointestinal and nongastrointestinal symptoms, and all agree that there is an improvement of symptoms on a gluten-free diet. * NCGS diagnosis can be reached only by excluding celiac disease and wheat allergy. * Patients suffering from NCGS are a heterogeneous group, composed of several subgroups, each characterized by different pathogenesis, clinical history, and, probably, clinical course. * A personal history of food allergy in infancy, coexistent atopy, positive IgG antigliadin antibodies (AGA) and flow cytometric basophil activation test, with wheat and duodenal and/or ileum-colon intraepithelial and lamina propria eosinophil counts, could be useful to identify NCGS patients. * Future research should aim to identify reliable biomarkers for NCGS diagnosis and to better define the different NCGS subgroup.},

   abstract = {BACKGROUND: The clinical presentation of organic and functional intestinal disorders can overlap and clinicians often rely on invasive and time-consuming procedures to make a final diagnosis. Regenerating islet-derived 3-alpha (Reg3alpha) is detectable in the circulation of patients with intestinal graft-versus host disease and patients with inflammatory bowel disease (IBD). AIM: To determine whether serum Reg3alpha testing is useful for discriminating mucosal enteropathies from functional intestinal disorders. METHODS: We prospectively included 47 patients with active coeliac disease (ACD), 13 patients with refractory coeliac disease (RCD), seven patients with common variable immunodeficiency (CVID), 72 patients with active Crohn's disease, 22 patients with active ulcerative colitis (UC) and 28 patients with irritable bowel syndrome (IBS)-related diarrhoea. Sera were also taken from 10 CD patients before and after 6-12 months of a gluten-free diet (GFD) and from 14 patients with IBD before and after induction therapy with Infliximab (IFX). Sera of 119 healthy volunteers were used to determine the cut-off value. Reg3alpha levels were measured by a commercial ELISA kit. RESULTS: Levels of Reg3alpha exceeded the cut-off value of the assay in 43/47(91%) ACD patients, 13/13(100%) RCD patients, 7/7(100%) CVID patients, 65/72(90%) Crohn's disease patients, 17/22(77%) UC patients and one patient with IBS(4%). Reg3alpha levels distinguished mucosal enteropathies from IBS with a sensitivity of 90% and a specificity of 96%. Reg3alpha levels significantly decreased in CD patients following a GFD and in IBD patients after treatment with IFX. CONCLUSION: Reg3alpha is a serum biomarker of intestinal damage that, combined with clinical data, identifies patients who should undergo invasive tests for diagnosing enteropathies.},

   abstract = {BACKGROUND: Coeliac disease (CD) is a chronic condition requiring a gluten-free diet, which is a very demanding diet to maintain on a life-long basis. For this reason it is a condition that can have serious repercussions on the quality of life (QOL). Therefore the need to elaborate a questionnaire on QOL specifically for patients with CD (CDQ): its original language is German, and the translation/validation process represents a considerable challenge involving not only a translation into Italian but also an adaptation to the country's specific cultural differences. METHODS: The questionnaire has been translated according to a "German --> Italian --> Italian --> German" algorithm with reconciliation of the differences. Scores for CDQ are computed overall and over four areas of four items each: emotion, gastrointestinal symptoms, gastrointestinal worries, social problems. RESULTS: CDQ was administered to 171 coeliacs (F 132, mean age 38 yrs +/- 14). Completeness was optimal. Item internal consistency was satisfied for 100% and 97% of patients for the specific and generic part, respectively. Cronbach's alpha coefficient was 0.7 for all scales. The general CDQ was higher in patients reporting subjective well-being (discriminant validity). CONCLUSIONS: The Italian translation of CDQ sounds natural, is easy to understand and reduces possible cultural biases to a minimum. A field test gave results comparable to the original validation, supporting the use of CDQ in cross-national surveys.},

Rare cases of primary, small intestinal CD4+ T-cell lymphomas with indolent behavior have been described, but are not well characterized. We describe morphologic, phenotypic, genomic and clinical features of 3 cases of indolent primary small intestinal CD4+ T-cell lymphomas. All patients presented with diarrhea and weight loss and were diagnosed with celiac disease refractory to a gluten free diet at referring institutions. Small intestinal biopsies showed crypt hyperplasia, villous atrophy and a dense lamina propria infiltrate of small-sized CD4+ T-cells often with CD7 downregulation or loss. Gastric and colonic involvement was also detected (n = 2 each). Persistent, clonal TCRbeta gene rearrangement products were detected at multiple sites. SNP array analysis showed relative genomic stability, early in disease course, and non-recurrent genetic abnormalities, but complex changes were seen at disease transformation (n = 1). Two patients are alive with persistent disease (4.6 and 2.5 years post-diagnosis), despite immunomodulatory therapy; one died due to bowel perforation related to large cell transformation 11 years post-diagnosis. Unique pathobiologic features warrant designation of indolent small intestinal CD4+ T-cell lymphoma as a distinct entity, greater awareness of which would avoid misdiagnosis as EATL or an inflammatory disorder, especially celiac disease.},

Although the disease may manifest itself at any age, it occurs mostly in either early childhood or in the third or fourth decade of life. Malabsorption syndrome as a typical clinical feature is commonly absent. Patients may exhibit minor gastrointestinal complaints, as well as numerous extraintestinal manifestations. We report a 43-year-old female patient with mi gratory arthralgias as the leading symptom, fatigue, sideropenic anemia and mild intermittent diarrhoea, who was diagnosed with gluten-sensitive enteropathy. Four months after introduction of gluten-free diet the patient reported no arthralgias, and complete clinical response was achieved. The aim of our case-report was to show that migratory arthralgias can be an extraintestinal manifestation of gluten-sensitive enteropathy. Unexplained articular complaints should raise clinical suspicion of celiac disease.},

   abstract = {BACKGROUND: Currently, the only treatment for celiac disease (CD) is a lifelong gluten-free diet (GFD). Research has been carried out in various countries into the nutritional adequacy of the GFD in terms of macro- and micronutrients, mostly presenting conflicting results. However, no data for Germany are available to date. AIM: To elucidate the nutritional composition of a GFD and to compare it with non-GFD in a representative German non-CD population. METHODS AND PATIENTS: A total of 1,000 patients who were members of the German Celiac Society (DZG) were invited to fill out a prospective 7-day food diary and a questionnaire. Data from 88 patients aged 14-80 years were analyzed and compared to the DACH reference values and to data from the German National Diet and Nutrition Survey (NVS II). RESULTS: No significant difference was observed for the intake of energy and macronutrients in male celiac patients compared to the NVS II. Only the fiber intake of male patients was significantly lower than that of the general population. Female patients, however, showed a significantly higher fat intake, but lower carbohydrate consumption. The average daily micronutrient intake of male and female patients, specifically of vitamin B1, B2, B6, folic acid, magnesium and iron, was significantly lower in celiac patients compared to the NVS II. CONCLUSION: This study reveals inadequate nutrient intake by male and female celiac patients in Germany. Based on our findings, regular (laboratory) monitoring of celiac patients should be recommended.},

   abstract = {BACKGROUND: Coeliac disease is an autoimmune disorder that is considered to affect approximately one in 100 people. In the UK, gluten-free (GF) foods can be prescribed by general practitioners (GPs) to treat this condition and there are national guidelines on the quantities of GF food an individual should receive on prescription. Information on actual prescribing behaviour by GPs, and how this compares with guideline recommendations, is scarce. The present study aimed to describe GPs prescribing practice of GF foods, within one locality in the UK, comparing this with national guidelines. METHODS: A retrospective evaluation of GP electronic medical records for all patients with a gluten-sensitive enteropathy diagnosis and/or those prescribed GF food between April 2010 and March 2011 was carried out in 16 GP practices in the west of Scotland, serving a total of 85 667 patients. RESULTS: Of 175 (0.18% of the total practice population) patients, 152 were identified with coeliac disease, eight with dermatitis herpetiformis and six with both conditions. A further nine patients received GF foods on prescriptions with no recorded diagnosis. There was a positive association between adherence to the prescribing guidelines and female sex (P < 0.0001) and (for those with a recorded diagnosis) increasing age (P = 0.001). There was no significant association between either socio-economic deprivation or co-morbidities and adherence to the prescribing guidelines. CONCLUSIONS: There was significant under prescribing of GF foods in those identified. Further research is required to establish whether these results are representative of wider practice in the UK.},

The patients underwent nutritional assessment and then started a gluten-free diet; they were reassessed 6 months later. Quantitative variables are expressed as the median and 25th-75th percentiles. RESULTS: We included 21 patients, 17 women and 4 mena, with a mean age of 43 years (31-47). The results of histological analysis were compatible with Marsh I lesions in 6 patients, Marsh IIIa in 6 and Marsh IIIb in 9. At baseline, 8 patients showed severe psychological distress, 4 showed moderate distress and 9 showed no distress. The GSRS score was 34 (17-43) and the PGWBI was 64 (48-87), with a significant correlation between the 2 indexes (rho=-.58, P=.006). At 6 months, 3 patients had severe psychological distress, 5 had moderate distress, 9 showed no distress and 4 showed psychological well-being. The GSRS score at 6 months was 13 (8-17) and the PGWBI was 83 (68-95) (P<.05 compared with baseline data for the 3 indicators). The 6 axes of the PGWBI showed significant improvement. At 6 months, no correlation was found between the GSRS and PGWBI. CONCLUSIONS: Patients with celiac disease have psychological alterations whose intensity is related to gastrointestinal symptoms. These symptoms improve after the start of a gluten-free diet.},

   abstract = {Escherichia coli (E. coli), and particularly the adherent invasive E. coli (AIEC) pathotype, has been increasingly implicated in the ethiopathogenesis of Crohn's disease (CD). E. coli strains with similar pathogenic features to AIEC have been associated with other intestinal disorders such as ulcerative colitis, colorectal cancer, and coeliac disease, but AIEC prevalence in these diseases remains largely unexplored. Since AIEC was described one decade ago, substantial progress has been made in deciphering its mechanisms of pathogenicity. However, the molecular bases that characterize the phenotypic properties of this pathotype are still not well resolved. A review of studies focused on E. coli populations in inflammatory bowel disease (IBD) is presented here and we discuss about the putative role of this species on each IBD subtype. Given the relevance of AIEC in CD pathogenesis, we present the latest research findings concerning AIEC host-microbe interactions and pathogenicity. We also review the existing data regarding the prevalence and abundance of AIEC in CD and its association with other intestinal diseases from humans and animals, in order to discuss the AIEC disease- and host-specificity. Finally, we highlight the fact that dietary components frequently found in industrialized countries may enhance AIEC colonization in the gut, which merits further investigation and the implementation of preventative measures.},

   abstract = {INTRODUCTION: The habits of introducing gluten and the implementation of the ESPGHAN-2008 recommendations are evaluated. MATERIALS AND METHODS: A retrospective cohort study was conducted in 2011 using a questionnaire containing various epidemiological variables and supplementary feeding that was completed by the parents of children between 12-18 months who were seen by the pediatrician. Central tendency measures were calculated for the quantitative variables, and non-parametric tests used for comparison of means (Mann-Whitney and Kruskal-Wallis). The Chi-squared or exact tests were used for analyzing the qualitative variables, analysis of frequencies and comparisons. Multivariate adjustment techniques were used for the significant variables. RESULTS: A total of 46 primary care pediatricians, who collected 1,015 questionnaires, collaborated. The mean age of the introduction of gluten was 6.99 months (standard deviation 1.46, median 7). Only 45.1% (95% confidence interval [CI 95%]: 41.8-48.3) introduced it between 4-6 months, 0.2% before 4 months, and 54.7% after 7 months. Only 13.9% (CI 95% 11.6-16.1) introduced gluten between 4-6 months with breastfeeding. Multivariate analysis showed that the variables linked to lower compliance with the introduction between 4-6 months are mothers of 35 years of age or older (adjusted Odds ratio (aOR 1.44; CI95%: 1.11-1.88), celiac family (aOR 2.04; CI 95%: 1.11-3.72) and breastfeeding (aOR 1.55; CI 95%: 1.06-2.26), and for the introduction between 4-6 months coinciding with breastfeeding, breastfeeding and mothers who had studied at university (aOR 1.72; CI 95%: 1.17-2.53). CONCLUSIONS: The ESPGHAN recommendation on the introduction of gluten among pediatricians in our sector has not yet been sufficiently implemented.},

METHODS: A total 60 suspected cases of adult celiac disease, both males and females were screened out from Liaquat University of Medical and Health Sciences hospital and private clinics at Sadar Hyderabad Sind by non probability purposive sampling during a period from July 2011 to December 2012.Age ranged between 18 to 55 Years. A detailed history and clinical examination was done. Patients already on gluten free diet, age <12years, tuberculosis or cancer of intestine/colon and patients of diabetes and thyroid disorder were excluded, while patients having positive ant tTG (value >15 iu/ml detected by ELISA) were included. The biochemical profile including serum albumin, calcium ,ferritin, SGPT, Alkaline phosphatase and Haemoglobin were estimated in central Diagnostic laboratory LUMHS by taking 10 cc centrifuged blood sample. The data was plotted on SPSS 16, mean and percentages were calculated. RESULTS: All patients were divided in to three groups according to age. The most common group was 18-30 years; (mean, 23.5+/-5.6) comprised 56.6%. The commonest clinical presentation was diarrhoea in 50%, menstrual irregularity in 21%, walking problems 21%, undue fatigue in 15% and edema in 15%. P values calculated in quantitative variable of males and females. The p value was significant in between serum calcium (p 0.004), haemoglobin (p 0,004), serum ferritin (<0.005) and alkaline phosphatise (<0.005). CONCLUSION: This study showed that Adult celiac disease was present with entirely different clinical and biochemical profile in patients in this region.},

   abstract = {Celiac disease (CD) is an immune-mediated enteropathy triggered by the ingestion of gluten-containing grains that affects ~1% of the white ethnic population. In the last decades, a rise in prevalence of CD has been observed that cannot be fully explained by improved diagnostics. Genetic predisposition greatly influences the susceptibility of individuals towards CD, though environmental factors also play a role. With no pharmacological treatments available, the only option to keep CD in remission is a strict and permanent exclusion of dietary gluten. Such a gluten-free diet is difficult to maintain because of gluten's omnipresence in food (e.g., additive in processed food). The development of adjuvant therapies which would permit the intake of small amounts of gluten would be desirable to improve the quality of life of patients on a gluten-free diet. Such therapies include gluten-degrading enzymes, polymeric binders, desensitizing vaccines, anti-inflammatory drugs, transglutaminase 2 inhibitors, and HLA-DQ2 blockers. However, many of these approaches pose pharmaceutical challenges with respect to drug formulation and stability, or application route and dosing interval. This perspective article discusses how pharmaceutical scientists may deal with these challenges and contribute to the implementation of novel therapeutic options for patients with CD.},

   abstract = {In the last decade the development of gluten-free foodstuffs has attracted great attention as a result of better diagnoses of coeliac disease and a greater knowledge of the relationship between gluten-free products and health. The increasing interest has prompted extensive research into the development of gluten-free foodstuffs that resemble gluten-containing foods. This review aims to provide some insights on dough functionality and process conditions regarding bread quality and to point out recent research dealing with the nutritional composition of those products. Gluten-free dough results from the combination of different ingredients, additives, and the processing aids required for building up network structures responsible for bread quality. Some relationships between dough rheology and bread characteristics were established to identify possible predictor parameters. Regarding bread-making processes, the impact of mixing, dough treatment and baking is stated. Nutritional quality is an important asset when developing gluten-free breads, and different strategies for improving it are reviewed. Gluten-free bread quality is dependent on ingredients and additives combination, but also processing can provide a way to improve bread quality. Nutritive value of the gluten-free breads must be always in mind when setting up recipes, for obtaining nutritionally balanced bread with adequate glycaemic index.},

   abstract = {OBJECTIVES: Prevalence of celiac disease in children is approximately 1%, but most patients remain unrecognized by reason of variable clinical presentation. Undetected patients may have an increased burden of illness and use of health care services because of nonspecific complaints. We investigated these issues prospectively in newly detected patients with celiac disease before and after diagnosis in a large nationwide cohort of children. METHODS: A validated questionnaire was sent to consecutive families whose children had been diagnosed as having celiac disease within 1 year. The survey contained questions about the use of medical consultations, on-demand drugs, vitamins and herbal products, children's absenteeism from day care or school and, parents' work absenteeism. A follow-up questionnaire was sent after 1 year of receiving a gluten-free diet. RESULTS: A total of 132 families responded. A total of 44 children were diagnosed because of gastrointestinal and 88 because of extraintestinal symptoms or by risk-group screening. On treatment, outpatient visits to primary health care decreased from a mean of 3.0 to 1.3 visits per year (P < 0.001), the number of hospitalizations from 0.2 to 0.1 (P = 0.008), and antibiotic prescriptions from 1.0 to 0.5/year (P < 0.001). Visits to secondary and tertiary health care increased from 0.6 to 1.4 (P < 0.001), mostly for celiac surveillance. Use of vitamins, micronutrients, and herbal products increased from 7.3 to 10.2 pills per month (P = 0.028). CONCLUSIONS: Implementation of a gluten-free diet resulted in reduced use of health care services and antibiotic prescriptions in children. Our findings support active case-finding and risk-group screening for celiac disease.},

   abstract = {BACKGROUND: Celiac disease (CD) is an immune-mediated disorder caused by the ingestion of wheat gluten. A lifelong, gluten-free diet is required to normalize the intestinal mucosa. We previously found that transamidation by microbial transglutaminase (mTGase) suppressed the gliadin-specific immune response in intestinal T-cell lines from CD patients and in models of gluten sensitivity. METHODS: SDS-PAGE, Western blot, ELISA, tissue transglutaminase (tTGase) assay and nano-HPLC-ESI-MS/MS experiments were used to analyze prolamins isolated from treated wheat flour. RESULTS: Gliadin and glutenin yields decreased to 7.6+/-0.5% and 7.5+/-0.3%, respectively, after a two-step transamidation reaction that produced a water-soluble protein fraction (spf). SDS-PAGE, Western blot and ELISA analyses confirmed the loss of immune cross-reactivity with anti-native gliadin antibodies in residual transamidated gliadins (K-gliadins) and spf as well as the occurrence of neo-epitopes. Nano-HPLC-ESI-MS/MS experiments identified some native and transamidated forms of celiacogenic peptides including p31-49 and confirmed that mTGase had similar stereo-specificity of tTGase. Those peptides resulted to be 100% and 57% modified in spf and K-gliadins, respectively. In particular, following transamidation p31-49 lost its ability to increase tTGase activity in Caco-2 cells. Finally, bread manufactured with transamidated flour had only minor changes in baking characteristics. CONCLUSIONS: The two-step transamidation reaction modified the analyzed gliadin peptides, which are known to trigger CD, without influencing main technological properties. GENERAL SIGNIFICANCE: Our data shed further light on a detoxification strategy alternative to the gluten free diet and may have important implications for the management of CD patients.},

Subjects performed individually six sensory tests, two for each product in different days separated by a week. In the test day, children had to evaluate the liking of the same type of product but of different four brands, before and after tasting them with a 5-point facial rating scale. Overall, the results showed that the majority of children appreciated more the appearance than the taste of all the GF products analysed. The present study provides the first and useful indications on the hedonic perceptions of celiac children about some commercial GF products.},

DESIGN: The database was built using the nutritional composition of the products, taking into consideration both the composition of the ingredients and the nutritional information reported on the product label. SETTING: The nutrient composition of each ingredient was obtained from two Italian databases (European Institute of Oncology and the National Institute for Food and Nutrition). SUBJECTS: The study developed a food composition database including a total of sixty foods representative of different categories of gluten-free products sold on the Italian market. The composition of the products included in the database is given in terms of quantity of macro- and micronutrients per 100 g of product as sold, and includes the full range of nutrient data present in traditional databases of gluten-containing foods. RESULTS: As expected, most of the products had a high content of carbohydrates and some of them can be labelled as a source of fibre (>3 g/100 g). Regarding micronutrients, among the products considered, breads, pizzas and snacks were especially very high in Na content (>400-500 mg/100 g). CONCLUSIONS: This database provides an initial useful tool for future nutritional surveys on the dietary habits of coeliac people.},

   abstract = {Celiac disease (CD) is an autoimmune disorder in individuals that carry DQ2 or DQ8 MHC class II haplotypes, triggered by the ingestion of gluten. There is no current treatment other than a gluten-free diet (GFD). We have previously shown that the BL-7010 copolymer poly(hydroxyethyl methacrylate-co-styrene sulfonate) (P(HEMA-co-SS)) binds with higher efficiency to gliadin than to other proteins present in the small intestine, ameliorating gliadin-induced pathology in the HLA-HCD4/DQ8 model of gluten sensitivity. The aim of this study was to investigate the efficiency of two batches of BL-7010 to interact with gliadin, essential vitamins and digestive enzymes not previously tested, and to assess the ability of the copolymer to reduce gluten-associated pathology using the NOD-DQ8 mouse model, which exhibits more significant small intestinal damage when challenged with gluten than HCD4/DQ8 mice. In addition, the safety and systemic exposure of BL-7010 was evaluated in vivo (in rats) and in vitro (genetic toxicity studies). In vitro binding data showed that BL-7010 interacted with high affinity with gliadin and that BL-7010 had no interaction with the tested vitamins and digestive enzymes. BL-7010 was effective at preventing gluten-induced decreases in villus-to-crypt ratios, intraepithelial lymphocytosis and alterations in paracellular permeability and putative anion transporter-1 mRNA expression in the small intestine. In rats, BL-7010 was well-tolerated and safe following 14 days of daily repeated administration of 3000 mg/kg. BL-7010 did not exhibit any mutagenic effect in the genetic toxicity studies. Using complementary animal models and chronic gluten exposure the results demonstrate that administration of BL-7010 is effective and safe and that it is able to decrease pathology associated with gliadin sensitization warranting the progression to Phase I trials in humans.},

   abstract = {For many years irritable bowel syndrome (IBS) and celiac disease (CD) have been considered 2 completely separate entities, with CD being clearly related to a permanent gluten intolerance and IBS having no relation with gluten ingestion. However IBS and CD symptoms may be indistinguishable, especially when diarrhea, bloating or abdominal pain predominate. In the last decade several studies have shown that the separation between CD and IBS is not so clear. Thus, some patients who have been diagnosed of IBS suffer in fact from CD. In addition, it seems that there is a group of patients who, without having CD, suffer gluten intolerance that cause them digestive symptoms similar to those of IBS. Gluten sensitivity is defined as the spectrum of morphological, immunological and functional abnormalities that respond to a gluten-free diet. This concept includes histological, immunological and clinical manifestations in the absence of evident morphological abnormalities. Therefore, it is mandatory to establish in a scientific way in which patients a gluten-free diet will be beneficial as well as when this is not justified.},

   abstract = {About two-thirds of irritable bowel syndrome (IBS) patients associate their symptoms with certain foods. We reviewed food-related factors putatively associated with manifestations of IBS. Soluble fiber may improve constipation but frequently increases bloating and abdominal pain. Carbohydrate malabsorption seems to be more frequent in IBS. A low FODMAP (fermentable oligosaccharides, disaccharides, monosaccharides and polyols) diet significantly reduces IBS symptoms and has been suggested as a therapeutic option. Serological screening for celiac disease should be done in patients without constipation. Moreover, non-celiac disease gluten sensitivity, defined as gluten intolerance once celiac disease and wheat allergy have been ruled out, should be considered in these patients. There is no specific diet for IBS patients but small and frequent meals, avoiding greasy foods, dairy products, many carbohydrates, caffeine and alcohol, is recommended.},

   abstract = {This article discusses the most interesting studies on functional and motility gastrointestinal disorders presented in Digestive Diseases Week (DDW) in 2013. New data were reported on the clinical importance of functional gastrointestinal disorders (FGID) and on how they can produce numerous disturbances such as inflammatory bowel disease. These disturbances are associated with somatic functional disease and particularly with fatigue. In addition, new data have emerged on the physiopathology of these disorders, with some studies reporting that environmental factors and events in early infancy can favor their development. Data were also presented on how bile acids can increase susceptibility to diarrhea in patients with irritable bowel syndrome (IBS) and on how the type of food intake can favor the development of symptoms. More data are available on the presence of underlying celiac disease in patients with IBS, which should prompt us to investigate this disease in our patients. Likewise, indiscriminate application of a gluten-free diet in patients with IBS has been shown not to produce a clear improvement. Regarding the physiopathology of functional dyspepsia (FD), results have been presented on how psychological factors can modify gastric accommodation and how this is in turn related to visceral hypersensitivity and gastric emptying. Regarding therapy, mirtazapine can improve symptoms and lead to weight gain in patients with severe FD and substantial weight loss. Results were presented on new drugs for IBS such as ibodutant and on old drugs with new applications such as mesalazine and ebastine. The antinociceptive effect of linaclotide is now better understood and a meta-analysis has shown its effectiveness in IBS with constipation as the main symptom. In patients with constipation, pelvic floor dysynergy can be diagnosed by a simple clinical interview and rectal touch. More data are available on the efficacy of prucalopride (which has been shown to accelerate colon transit time) and data were provided on plecanatide, a potential new drug that could be useful in constipation. Finally, results were presented on the use of botulinum toxin injection in patients with spastic motility disorders of the esophagus. Also worthy of mention is a study confirming a higher frequency of esophageal cancer patients with achalasia who receive treatment.},

   abstract = {Wheat prolamins, commonly known as "gluten", are a complex mixture of 71-78 proteins, which constitute ~80% of the proteins in the wheat grains and supply 50% of the global dietary protein demand. Prolamins are also responsible for numerous gluten-induced disorders and determine the unique visco-elastic properties of the wheat dough. These properties necessitate the reliable determination of the prolamin composition in wheat grains and their derived products. Therefore, this study examined the impact of HPLC conditions, including column type, column temperature, flow rate, and the gradient of polar and non-polar solvents in the mobile phase, to improve the analytical resolution of prolamins. The following conditions were found optimal for analyses: column temperature 60 degrees C, flow rate 1.0 mL/min and an elution gradient of 20%-60% of 0.1% trifluoroacetic acid + acetonitrile in 60 min. For further improvement of resolution, gliadin and glutenin extracts were analyzed using MALDI-TOF-MS in combination with HPLC fractionation. Two semi-quantitative methods, densitometry of stained polyacrylamide gels and HPLC, were used to determine relative prolamin quantities and the correspondence between the methods was established. The combinatorial gluten analyses approach developed during the present study was used to analyze prolamin profiles of wheat transformants expressing DEMETER silencing artificial microRNA, and the results are discussed.},

It is an IgA-mediated cutaneous disease, with immunoglobulin A deposits appearing in a granular pattern at the top of the dermal papilla in the sublamina densa area of the basement membrane, which is present both in affected skin and healthy skin. The same protein IgA1 with J chain is found in the small intestinal mucosa in patients with adult celiac disease, suggesting a strong association with DH. Specific antibodies such as antiendomysium, antireticulina, antigliadin and, recently identified, the epidermal and tissue transglutaminase subtypes, as well as increased zonulin production, are common to both conditions, along with gluten-sensitive enteropathy and DH. Autoimmune diseases present higher levels of prevalence, such as thyroid (5-11%), pernicious anemia (1-3%), type 1 diabetes (1-2%) and collagen tissue disease. The chosen treatment is dapsone and a gluten-free diet.},

We report the case of a 23-year-old woman referred to our centre because of jaundice and diarrhoea, who was diagnosed with CD in childhood. She complied with a gluten-free diet until puberty. Laboratory tests and liver biopsy were performed to establish the diagnosis of autoimmune hepatitis. Her thyroid- specific peroxides levels and thyroid gland function tests were altered as well, indicating the presence of an autoimmune disorder of the thyroid gland. Immunosuppressive treatment led to normalization of transaminases levels and bilirubin. In conclusion, other autoimmune diseases should be ruled out in patients with CD.},

   abstract = {The gluten-free (GF) products market represents one of the most prosperous markets in the field of food and beverages in the immediate future. Historically, counselling for celiac disease has focused on the absence of gluten in foods, however the nutritional quality of GF foodstuffs is an important aspect to consider. The aim of the present work was to compare the nutritional composition of the 206 GF rendered products most consumed in Spain, against the composition of 289 equivalent foods with gluten, and to make a comparison between the diet including GF products and the same diet with equivalent products with gluten in a 58 adult celiac population. The results of the present collaborative study pointed out differences in calorie, macronutrient, fiber, sodium, salt and cholesterol content between GF rendered and gluten-containing foodstuffs. Thus, calorie and nutrient intake in a GF diet is different when compared to its equivalent diet with gluten. Following a diet based on GF products could suppose a nutritional imbalance for celiac patients as well as for non-celiacs who follow a diet that includes many GF rendered foodstuffs.},

   abstract = {Non-celiac gluten sensitivity (NCGS) is an emerging disorder characterized by intestinal and extra-intestinal symptoms related to the ingestion of gluten-containing food in non-celiac patients. Its prevalence has been estimated to be six to ten-times higher than that of celiac disease (CD). A gluten-free diet is the most widely recommended therapy, but the causative agent remains unknown and there are no consensus diagnostic criteria. Recent studies on NCGS have included patients with possibly overlooked minor CD and diarrhea-predominant irritable bowel syndrome without self-reported gluten intolerance, but showing a response to a gluten-free diet. Furthermore, FODMAPs (Fermentable Oligosaccharides, Disaccharides, Monosaccharides And Polyols) have recently been postulated as the culprit component for NCGS in wheat, instead of gluten. This review updates evidence on the pathophysiology of NCGS and the efficacy of different dietary interventions in its treatment, stressing the need for proper screening for CD before a diagnosis of NCGS is made.},

Villous atrophy and diffuse immature lymphocytes were observed at histology. Tissue transglutaminase mRNA mucosal levels showed a 6-fold increase. The patient was treated with a gluten-free diet (GFD) and six months later the symptoms had disappeared, the villous architecture was restored and mucosal tissue transglutaminase mRNA was comparable to that of healthy subjects.

   abstract = {Celiac disease (CD) is caused by intolerance to gluten. Oral supplementation with enzymes like Aspergillus niger propyl-endoprotease (AN-PEP), which can hydrolyse gluten, has been proposed to prevent the harmful effects of ingestion of gluten. The influence of meal composition on AN-PEP activity was investigated using an in vitro model that simulates stomach-like conditions. AN-PEP optimal dosage was 20 proline protease units (PPU)/g gluten. The addition of a carbonated drink strongly enhanced AN-PEP activity because of its acidifying effect. While fat did not affect gluten degradation by AN-PEP, the presence of food proteins slowed down gluten detoxification. Moreover, raw gluten was degraded more efficiently by AN-PEP than baked gluten. We conclude that the meal composition influences the amount of AN-PEP needed for gluten elimination. Therefore, AN-PEP should not be used to replace a gluten free diet, but rather to support digestion of occasional and/or inadvertent gluten consumption.},

   abstract = {BACKGROUND: There has been increasing interest in the entity of Non-Celiac Gluten Sensitivity (NCGS) in recent years; however, it still remains a controversial topic and its pathogenesis is not well understood. Celiac Disease, in contrast, is a well-studied condition that has become increasingly recognized as a prevalent condition arising from a heightened immunological response to gluten. Wheat allergy is an IgE-mediated condition capable of causing a variety of gastrointestinal symptoms. However, the number of patients who have neither celiac disease nor wheat allergy, but appear to derive benefit from a gluten-free diet, is also increasing substantially. The use of the term NCGS as a way of describing this condition has become increasingly prevalent in recent years. PURPOSE: In this review, we will focus on gastrointestinal manifestations of NCGS and discuss the evidence for the condition and its putative pathogenesis. We will discuss areas of controversy and areas for potential future research.},

   abstract = {INTRODUCTION: Coeliac disease is an autoimmune gluten sensitive enteropathy and is now known to affect 1% of the adult population. A gluten-free diet (GFD) should be curative; however, up to 30% of patients have persistent symptoms and many patients find the diet difficult to fully adhere to. Currently, there are no licensed therapeutic options for patients with coeliac disease outside of a GFD. AREAS COVERED: This review will outline the case for alternative treatments and discuss the potential therapeutic targets. The products in the most advanced stage of development will be discussed in detail. EXPERT OPINION: There is clearly an unmet need for alternatives to a GFD for the treatment of coeliac disease. Oral glutenase supplements to improve the degradation of gluten into non-toxic peptides appear to be the most likely to provide a breakthrough in the treatment of coeliac disease; however, other modalities such as a therapeutic vaccine or zonulin inhibitors to reduce intestinal permeability have shown promising results.},

   abstract = {INTRODUCTION: Coeliac disease is an autoimmune condition resulting from an abnormal reaction to dietary gluten leading to small bowel villous atrophy. International prevalence studies suggest that coeliac disease affects 1% of the adult population. However, despite its high prevalence, large numbers of patients go undiagnosed. One method of increasing detection rates would be to introduce a quick screening test in the form of a finger-prick blood test. AREAS COVERED: There are currently four available point-of-care tests (POCTs) available for use by health professionals. This diagnostic evaluation will review the evidence for the use of POCTs in coeliac disease including Simtomax a novel test for deamidated gliadin peptides and total IgA level. EXPERT OPINION: An accurate POCT has the potential to increase the rates of diagnosis of coeliac disease if used effectively as part of a case finding approach in primary or secondary care. Evidence for the use of Simtomax is currently fairly limited only drawing comparison with laboratory serology rather than the gold standard of histology and it has only been trialled in high-risk populations. However, results to date are encouraging and further research into this area is required.},

   abstract = {"Gluten free" exploded onto the American foodscape in recent years: as of January 2013, 30 percent of U.S. adults reported reducing or eliminating gluten in their diets. How do individuals participate in the expansion of gluten-free dieting, and what are the implications of that expansion? This article is based on 31 in-depth, semi-structured interviews conducted between May and October 2012 with gluten-free and -restricted persons. I identify three interrelated factors contributing to the expansion of gluten-free dieting among non-celiacs. Participants broaden the lay understanding of gluten-related disorders, undermine biomedical authority, and diagnose others. Such participant-driven change, termed self-ascriptive looping, is one factor in the diet's rapid popularization. I show how participants question the doctor-patient relationship and increase social contestability for other dieters. My findings challenge previous work on contested illness and suggest food intolerances may require a reconceptualization of contested illness experience.},

   abstract = {Celiac disease (CD) is a genetically determined autoimmune condition, with an estimated worldwide prevalence of 1%. CD may be diagnosed or undiagnosed, but is usually identified through tests of specific antibodies and duodenal endoscopy. Treatment is the elimination of gluten from the diet. This article reviews six studies examining the relationship between CD and preterm (PTB) and/or low birth weight (LBW) births. Women previously identified with CD had pregnancy outcomes similar to women without CD. Undiagnosed CD, however, was associated with LBW in four of the six studies, and PTB in two studies. No increase in PTB or LBW birth was found in two studies. In these review of the literature, undiagnosed CD was most likely to result in increased risk of PTB or LBW. Nurses, nurse midwives, and nurse practitioners can play an important role in identifying and educating women with CD in the preconception and prenatal periods as well as during well woman health visits to potentially reduce PTB and LBW births in women with CD.},

   abstract = {OBJECTIVES: Histological examination of duodenal biopsies is the gold standard for assessing intestinal damage in celiac disease (CD). A noninvasive marker of disease status is necessary, because obtaining duodenal biopsies is invasive and not suitable for routine monitoring of CD patients. As the small intestine is a major site of cytochrome P450 3A4 (CYP3A4) activity and also the location of the celiac lesion, we investigated whether patients with active CD display abnormal pharmacokinetics of an orally administered CYP3A4 substrate, simvastatin (SV), which could potentially be used for noninvasive assessment of their small intestinal health. METHODS: Preclinical experiments were performed in CYP3A4-humanized mice to examine the feasibility of the test. Subsequently, a clinical trial was undertaken with 11 healthy volunteers, 18 newly diagnosed patients with CD, and 25 celiac patients who had followed a gluten-free diet (GFD) for more than 1 year. The maximum concentration (Cmax) of orally administered SV plus its major non-CYP3A4-derived metabolite SV acid (SV equivalent (SVeq)) was measured, and compared with clinical, histological, and serological parameters. RESULTS: In CYP3A4-humanized mice, a marked decrease in SV metabolism was observed in response to enteropathy. In the clinical setting, untreated celiac patients displayed a significantly higher SVeq Cmax (46+/-24 nM) compared with treated patients (21+/-16 nM, P<0.001) or healthy subjects (19+/-11 nM, P<0.005). SVeq Cmax correctly predicted the diagnosis in 16/18 untreated celiac patients, and also the recovery status of all follow-up patients that exhibited normal or near-normal biopsies (Marsh 0-2). All patients with abnormal SVeq Cmax showed a reduction in the value after 1 year of following a GFD. CONCLUSIONS: SVeq Cmax is a promising noninvasive marker for assessment of small intestinal health. Further studies are warranted to establish its clinical utility for assessing gut status of patients with CD.},

The spectrum of gluten-related disorders in the early 1980s was simple: CD and dermatitis herpetiformis. In the last few years, wheat allergy, gluten ataxia and noncoeliac gluten sensitivity have become new gluten-related topics. Adherence to GFDs in CD is limited and factors influencing adherence are poorly understood. Noncoeliac gluten sensitivity has stimulated the GFD food industry not only in Australia but all over the world. This article provides an overview of GFD in daily practice.},

   abstract = {Celiac disease (CD) may affect up to 1% of the Western population. It is a disease whose diagnosis has been made mainly in childhood, but now the profile has changed, with one out of five newly diagnosed individuals being over 65 years old. The only treatment for this population is a gluten-free diet. Therefore, the objective of this study was to analyse the occurrence of arsenic (As) in gluten-free products, basically those rice-based, intended for celiac adult consumers. The current study demonstrated that these rice-based products contained important contents of total arsenic (t-As) (up to 120 mug kg(-1)) and inorganic arsenic (i-As) (up to 85.8 mug kg(-1)). It was estimated that the contents of t-As and i-As in rice used as the main ingredient of these foods were as high as 235 and 198 mug kg(-1), respectively. The estimated daily intake of i-As was 0.46 and 0.45 mug kg(-1) bw in women and men of 58 and 75 kg of body weight (bw), respectively. These values indicate that a health risk to these consumers cannot be excluded. Finally, legislation is needed to delimit the safety intake by health agencies and to improve the labelling of these special rice-based foods for celiac adult consumers. The label should include information about percentage, geographical origin and cultivar of the rice used; besides and if companies want to clearly prove the safety of their products, the exact content of i-As should also be included.},

   abstract = {Celiac disease is an autoimmune disease that affects the villi of the small intestine causing abdominal pain, gas, diarrhea, or bad absorption due to gluten intolerance. The only treatment for this disease consists of a lifelong gluten free diet; this is, celiac people cannot consume products containing gluten, such as wheat, barley, and rye, but they can use rice and corn. Thus, rice flour is mainly used for the manufacturing of the basic products of this population. Unfortunately, rice can contain high contents of total (t-As) and inorganic (i-As) arsenic. The current study demonstrated that products for celiac children with a high percentage of rice contained high concentrations of arsenic (256 and 128 mug kg(-)(1)). The daily intake of i-As ranged from 0.61 to 0.78 mug kg(-)(1) body weight (bw) in children up to 5 y of age; these values were below the maximum value established by the EFSA Panel (8.0 mug kg(-)(1) bw per day), but it should be considered typical of populations with a high exposure to this pollutant. Finally, legislation is needed to improve the labeling of these special rice-based foods for celiac children; label should include information about percentage, geographical origin, and cultivar of the used rice.},

   abstract = {Celiac disease (CD) is a frequent inflammatory intestinal disease, with a genetic background, caused by gliadin-containing food. Undigested gliadin peptides P31-43 and P57-68 induce innate and adaptive T cell-mediated immune responses, respectively. Alterations in the cell shape and actin cytoskeleton are present in celiac enterocytes, and gliadin peptides induce actin rearrangements in both the CD mucosa and cell lines. Cell shape is maintained by the actin cytoskeleton and focal adhesions, sites of membrane attachment to the extracellular matrix. The locus of the human Lipoma Preferred Partner (LPP) gene was identified as strongly associated with CD using genome-wide association studies (GWAS). The LPP protein plays an important role in focal adhesion architecture and acts as a transcription factor in the nucleus. In this study, we examined the hypothesis that a constitutive alteration of the cell shape and the cytoskeleton, involving LPP, occurs in a cell compartment far from the main inflammation site in CD fibroblasts from skin explants. We analyzed the cell shape, actin organization, focal adhesion number, focal adhesion proteins, LPP sub-cellular distribution and adhesion to fibronectin of fibroblasts obtained from CD patients on a Gluten-Free Diet (GFD) and controls, without and with treatment with A-gliadin peptide P31-43. We observed a "CD cellular phenotype" in these fibroblasts, characterized by an altered cell shape and actin organization, increased number of focal adhesions, and altered intracellular LPP protein distribution. The treatment of controls fibroblasts with gliadin peptide P31-43 mimics the CD cellular phenotype regarding the cell shape, adhesion capacity, focal adhesion number and LPP sub-cellular distribution, suggesting a close association between these alterations and CD pathogenesis.},

The aim of the present study was to analyze the features and the long-term response to immunosuppressive treatment in children with autoimmune hepatitis (AIH) associated with CD. METHODS: Retrospective and prospective evaluation of patients followed at a single center. RESULTS: Among 79 patients with AIH, 15 (19%) had CD (9 type 1, 3 type 2, 3 seronegative). In the group of patients with AIH and CD, female sex was significantly more represented than in the group of patients with AIH alone; also, in the former group, diagnosis was made significantly earlier (P < 0.05). All of the 15 patients on a gluten-free diet achieved sustained remission when treated with prednisone and azathioprine or cyclosporine. The mean period of follow-up was 73 months; discontinuation of therapy was attempted in 9 patients while in remission: 4 patients relapsed, 5 (33%) could definitively stop immunosuppressive treatment with a mean period of treatment-free sustained remission of 89 months (range 26-174). In the same period, treatment discontinuation, attempted in 24 of 64 patients with AIH without CD, was successful in 5 patients (8%; P < 0.05). CONCLUSIONS: Patients with AIH coexisting with CD achieve treatment-free sustained remission in a significantly higher proportion, when compared with patients with AIH without CD, suggesting a possible long-term adjuvant effect of a gluten-free diet.},

Identifying CD in schoolchildren to characterize CD iceberg and evaluate the effect of diagnosis in screening-detected children. METHODS: A total of 7377 5- to 8-year-old children were invited to participate. A total of 5733 salivary samples were collected and tested for anti-transglutaminase antibodies (tTGAb), using a fluid-phase radioimmunoassay. Salivary tTGAb-positive children were analyzed for serum antibodies (anti-endomysium antibodies, radioimmunoassay, and enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay tTGAb). Positive children underwent endoscopy and then started gluten-free diet (GFD) and periodical follow-up. RESULTS: Forty-six subjects were found salivary tTGAb-positive and 16 border-line. Forty-five of 46 and 5 of 15 of them were also serum antibody-positive. Forty-two children showed duodenal villous atrophy and 1 had only type 1 lesions. Three children started GFD without performing endoscopy. CD prevalence (including 23 previously diagnosed children with CD) was 1.2%. Considering all 65 celiacs in our sample, a silent CD was found in 64%, typical in 28%, atypical in 7%, and potential in 1%. All patients showed strict adherence to GFD, weight and stature increase, and well-being improvement. Eighty-five percent and all but 2 screening-detected children with CD had Italian parents. CONCLUSIONS: Our sample size, representative of primary schoolchildren of our region, demonstrated that CD prevalence is growing in Italy, with a modified clinical spectrum and iceberg deepness.},

There is limited evidence and guidance on the effective management of these patients. We describe a case of severe RCD in our hospital, with symptoms controlled effectively only by total parenteral nutrition (TPN). This 68-year-old woman initially presented to the clinic with persistent non-bloody diarrhoea and vomiting. A diagnosis of coeliac disease was confirmed with a positive tissue transglutaminase assay and histology. A strict gluten-free diet was ineffective and she represented 6 months later with 13 kg weight loss (16.7%), ongoing abdominal pain and diarrhoea, with bowels opening 16 times a day. She was oedematous, had an albumin of 12 g/l and required hospital admission. She was treated for pancreatic insufficiency and presumptively for small bowel bacterial overgrowth with no resolution of symptoms. We ruled out infectious causes and investigated for small bowel malignancy; all results were negative. Small bowel enteroscopy showed ulcerative jejunitis. She was given 5 days of TPN, following which her symptoms improved and albumin normalised. This was sustained with symptom resolution and weight gain seen at follow-up. TPN successfully and rapidly induced remission in this case. Thus, a short period of TPN should be considered as a potential component of management in patients with severe RCD.},

Clinically, patients present with diarrhea, abdominal pain, malabsorption, and weight loss. Gluten intolerance is the most common cause of villous blunting in the duodenum; however, in a recent case series by the Mayo Clinic, it has been reported that olmesartan can have a similar effect. In this case report, a 62-year-old female with a history of hypothyroidism and hypertension managed for several years with olmesartan presented with abdominal pain, weight loss, and nausea. Despite compliance to a gluten-free diet, the patient's symptoms worsened, losing 20 pounds in 3 wk. Endoscopy showed thickening, scalloping, and mosaiform changes of the duodenal mucosa. The biopsy showed CS characterized by complete villous atrophy, lymphocytosis, and thickened sub-epithelial collagen table. After 2 mo cessation of olmesartan, the patient's symptoms improved, and follow-up endoscopy was normal with complete villous regeneration. These findings suggest that olmesartan was a contributing factor in the etiology of this patient's CS. Clinicians should be aware of the possibility of drug-induced CS and potential reversibility after discontinuation of medication.},

Over the past several years, the concept of non-celiac gluten sensitivity (NCGS) has gained significant interest from the scientific community and mass media and the number of individuals embracing a gluten-free diet is rapidly growing. This condition is characterized by gastrointestinal or extraintestinal symptoms that respond to gluten withdrawal without evidence for underlying celiac disease or wheat allergy. Symptoms display significant overlap with the irritable bowel syndrome. Many important factors regarding this relatively novel condition remain to be elucidated; no discriminative markers to support a diagnosis of gluten sensitivity have been identified yet and its pathogenesis remains obscure.

Recently, a novel gluten-related disorder has gained significant interest from the scientific community and mass media. This condition, known as non-coeliac gluten sensitivity, is characterised by gastrointestinal or extra-intestinal symptoms that respond to gluten withdrawal without evidence of underlying coeliac disease. Its symptoms overlap considerably with those of irritable bowel syndrome and the number of individuals embracing a gluten-free diet is rapidly growing. No discriminative markers to support a diagnosis of gluten sensitivity have been identified; the perceived response to a gluten-free diet after exclusion of coeliac disease is currently the best diagnostic and therapeutic marker. Its pathogenesis remains obscure but may be related to non-gliadin molecules in grains that stimulate the innate immune system of the intestine. Here, we summarise the current knowledge on this novel condition.},

When other causes of villous atrophy have been excluded, these patients are referred to as refractory celiac disease (RCD) patients. RCD can be divided in two types based on the absence (type I) or presence (type II) of an, usually clonal, intraepithelial lymphocyte population with aberrant phenotype. RCDI usually runs a benign course and may be difficult to be differentiated from uncomplicated, slow responding CD. In contrast, RCDII can be defined as low-grade intraepithelial lymphoma and frequently transforms into an aggressive enteropathy associated T-cell lymphoma with dismal prognosis. This paper describes the clinical characteristics of RCDI and RCDII, diagnostic approach, and the latest insights in treatment options.},

This study reports on the prevalence of various diseases in a cohort of CD patients in northern India.

The mean age was 19 years. Seventy-one percent of patients presented with typical diarrheal disease, while 29 % presented with atypical nondiarrheal disease. One or more associated diseases were noted in 70 (19.2 %) patients. Liver diseases were the most common association. Portal hypertension was present in 33 (9 %) patients; chronic liver disease was the underlying cause in 17 patients, while noncirrhotic causes were noted in 16 patients. Type 1 diabetes was seen in 13 and hypothyroidism in 11 patients. Other unreported or rarely reported associated diseases were also found in some of the patients. Associated comorbid diseases are common, and may need to be actively screened, in Indian CD patients.},

   abstract = {BACKGROUND: Celiac disease (CD) is a chronic disorder in genetically predisposed individuals in which a small intestinal immune-mediated enteropathy is precipitated by dietary gluten. It can be difficult to diagnose because signs and symptoms may be absent, subtle, or not recognized as CD related and therefore not prompt testing within routine clinical practice. Thus, most people with CD are undiagnosed and a public health intervention, which involves screening the general population, is an option to find those with unrecognized CD. However, how these screening-detected individuals experience the diagnosis and treatment (gluten-free diet) is not fully understood. The aim of this study is to investigate the health-related quality of life (HRQoL) of adolescents with screening-detected CD before and one year after diagnosis and treatment. METHODS: A prospective nested case-referent study was done involving Swedish adolescents who had participated in a CD screening study when they were in the sixth grade and about 12 years old. Screening-detected adolescents (n = 103) and referents without CD who participated in the same screening (n = 483) answered questionnaires at the time of the screening and approximately one year after the screening-detected adolescents had received their diagnosis that included the EQ-5D instrument used to measure health status and report HRQoL. RESULTS: The HRQoL for the adolescents with screening-detected CD is similar to the referents, both before and one year after diagnosis and initiation of the gluten-free diet, except in the dimension of pain at follow-up. In the pain dimension at follow-up, fewer cases reported problems than referents (12.6% and 21.9% respectively, Adjusted OR 0.50, 95% CI 0.27-0.94). However, a sex stratified analysis revealed that the significant difference was for boys at follow-up, where fewer screening-detected boys reported problems (4.3%) compared to referent boys (18.8%) (Adjusted OR 0.17, 95% CI 0.04-0.73). CONCLUSIONS: The findings of this study suggest that adolescents with unrecognized CD experience similar HRQoL as their peers without CD, both before and one year after diagnosis and initiation of gluten-free diet, except for boys in the dimension of pain at follow-up.},

   abstract = {BACKGROUND: Mass screening could identify those with unrecognized celiac disease (CD), but the experience of being detected through screening and living with screening-detected CD should be explored before considering this as acceptable intervention. For this study we invited screening-detected adolescents to describe their experience living with screening-detected CD five years after diagnosis with the aim to explore how their perceptions, practices, and beliefs evolved. METHODS: Adolescents who were diagnosed through a population-based CD screening were invited to write narratives after being diagnosed. Of 153 adolescents who were eventually diagnosed through the screening, 91 wrote narratives one year after diagnosis and 72 five years after diagnosis. A qualitative content analysis resulted in a theme and categories that describe the experience living with screening-detected CD five years after diagnosis. RESULTS: The overall theme--Internalizing the threat of risk--illustrates that being detected through screening and the internalized threat of future health complications have impacted how these adolescents felt about the diagnosis, coped with the gluten-free diet (GFD), and thought about CD screening. This theme is supported by four categories: maintaining an imposed disease identity describes how they continued to define their diagnosis in relation to the screening. They also expressed moving from forced food changes to adapted diet routines by describing habits, routines, coping strategies, and the financial burden of the GFD. They had enduring beliefs of being spared negative consequences, however, even after five years, some doubted they had CD and worried that being detected and eating a GFD might not be beneficial, i.e. continuing to fear it is "all in vain". CONCLUSIONS: There was maintenance and evolution in the perceptions, practices, and beliefs of the adolescents after five years. Some have adjusted to the disease and adapted new habits and coping strategies to deal with the GFD, while others still doubt they have CD or that being detected was beneficial. The transition to adapting to the disease and GFD is ongoing, illustrating the importance of providing ongoing support for those with screening-detected CD as they adjust to this chronic disease and the GFD.},

METHODS: This cross-sectional multicenter study was performed at Schneider Children's Medical Center of Israel (Petach Tiqva, Israel), and San Paolo Hospital (Milan, Italy). We enrolled 114 CD children in serologic remission, who were on a GFD for at least one year. At enrollment, anthropometric measurements, blood lipids and glucose were assessed, and compared to values at diagnosis. The homeostasis model assessment-estimated insulin resistance was calculated as a measure of insulin resistance. RESULTS: Three or more concomitant CVD risk factors [body mass index, waist circumference, low density lipoprotein (LDL) cholesterol, triglycerides, blood pressure and insulin resistance] were identified in 14% of CD subjects on a GFD. The most common CVD risk factors were high fasting triglycerides (34.8%), elevated blood pressure (29.4%), and high concentrations of calculated LDL cholesterol (24.1%). On a GFD, four children (3.5%) had insulin resistance. Fasting insulin and HOMA-IR were significantly higher in the Italian cohort compared to the Israeli cohort (P < 0.001). Children on a GFD had an increased prevalence of borderline LDL cholesterol (24%) when compared to values (10%) at diagnosis (P = 0.090). Trends towards increases in overweight (from 8.8% to 11.5%) and obesity (from 5.3% to 8.8%) were seen on a GFD. CONCLUSION: This report of insulin resistance and CVD risk factors in celiac children highlights the importance of CVD screening, and the need for dietary counseling targeting CVD prevention.},

   abstract = {BACKGROUND AND AIM: The pathogenesis of short stature in celiac disease (CD) is unknown. Obese children are generally taller than their non-obese peers; however, the role of adiposity on stature in CD is unclear. Our aim was to determine the association between adiposity and stature in CD. SUBJECTS AND METHODS: We compared the anthropometric characteristics of prepubertal children of ages 3-12 years, with biopsy-proven CD (n=40) and who were not on gluten-free diet, to same aged, prepubertal non-CD children (n=50). Body mass index (BMI) was calculated using the formula weight/height(2). Sex-adjusted midparental target height (MPTH) standard deviation score (SDS) was calculated using National Children Health Statistics data for 18-year-old adults. Data were expressed as mean +/- standard deviation. RESULTS: CD subjects had significantly lower BMI SDS than controls (0.61 +/- 1.22 vs. 1.28 +/- 1.60, p=0.027) but were not significantly shorter than the controls (-0.05 +/- 1.21 vs. 0.21 +/- 1.71, p=0.41). When the patients were subdivided into the normal-weight and overweight/obese groups, the normal-weight CD patients were of similar height as the normal-weight controls (p=0.76) but were significantly shorter than both the overweight/obese controls (p<0.001) and overweight/obese CD children (p<0.001). Interestingly, the overweight/obese CD children were significantly taller than the normal-weight controls (p=0.003). The MPTH SDS did not differ between the groups. CONCLUSIONS: Overweight/obese prepubertal children with CD were taller than both their normal-weight CD peers and the normal-weight controls, but were of similar height as the overweight/obese control subjects.},

   abstract = {PURPOSE: To investigate whether breast-milk composition and microbiota differ in healthy mothers and mothers with celiac disease (CD) to ultimately contribute to identify additional factors determining CD risk. METHODS: Breast-milk samples from healthy mothers (n = 12) and mothers with CD (n = 12) were collected. Cytokines and secretory immunoglobulin A (sIgA) were analyzed by bead-arrays and flow cytometry and human milk oligosaccharides (HMOs) were assessed by capillary electrophoresis with laser-induced fluorescence (CE-LIF) detection. Breast-milk microbiota composition was analyzed by conventional and quantitative real-time PCR. RESULT: Breast milk from CD mothers showed significantly lower levels of interleukin (IL) 12p70 (P < 0.042), transforming growth factor (TGF)-beta1 (P < 0.018) and sIgA (P < 0.003) and almost significantly lower levels of interferon (IFN)-gamma (P < 0.058). Six mothers in each group belonged to the secretor Le(a-b+) type, one to the secretor Le(a-b-) type and five to the non-secretor Le(a+b-) type. CD mothers of non-secretor Le(a+b-) type showed increased Lacto-N-tetraose content (P < 0.042) compared with healthy mothers. CD mothers' milk showed reduced gene copy numbers of Bifidobacterium spp. (P < 0.026) and B. fragilis group (P < 0.044). CONCLUSION: CD mothers' breast milk is characterized by a reduced abundance of immunoprotective compounds (TGF-beta1 and sIgA) and bifidobacteria. The reduction in these components could theoretically diminish the protective effects of breast-feeding on the child's future risk of developing CD.},

A double-blind, randomised, placebo-controlled trial was conducted in thirty-three children who received a capsule containing either B. longum CECT 7347 (10(9) colony-forming units) or placebo (excipients) daily for 3 months together with a gluten-free diet (GFD). Outcome measures (baseline and post-intervention) included immune phenotype of peripheral blood cells, serum cytokine concentration, faecal secretory IgA (sIgA) content, anthropometric parameters and intestinal microbiota composition. Comparisons between the groups revealed greater height percentile increases (P= 0.048) in the B. longum CECT 7347 group than in the placebo group, as well as decreased peripheral CD3(+) T lymphocytes (P= 0.004) and slightly reduced TNF-alpha concentration (P= 0.067). Within-group comparisons of baseline and final values did not reveal any differences in T lymphocytes and cytokines in the placebo group, while decreased CD3(+) (P =0.013) and human leucocyte antigen (HLA)-DR(+) T lymphocytes (P =0.029) and slightly reduced TNF-alpha concentration (P= 0.085) were detected in the B. longum CECT 7347 group. Comparison between the groups showed that the administration of B. longum CECT 7347 reduced the numbers of the Bacteroides fragilis group (P= 0.020) and the content of sIgA in stools (P= 0.011) compared with the administration of placebo. Although this is a first exploratory intervention with limitations, the findings suggest that B. longum CECT 7347 could help improve the health status of CD patients who tend to show alterations in gut microbiota composition and a biased immune response even on a GFD.},

   abstract = {T cell cytokine release assays are used to diagnose infectious diseases, but not autoimmune or allergic disease. Coeliac disease (CD) is a common T cell-mediated disease diagnosed by the presence of gluten-dependent intestinal inflammation and serology. Many patients cannot be diagnosed with CD because they reduce dietary gluten before medical workup. Oral gluten challenge in CD patients treated with gluten-free diet (GFD) mobilizes gluten-reactive T cells measurable by interferon (IFN)-gamma enzyme-linked immunospot (ELISPOT) or major histocompatibility complex (MHC) class II tetramers. Immunodominant peptides are quite consistent in the 90% of patients who possess HLA-DQ2.5. We aimed to develop whole blood assays to detect gluten-specific T cells. Blood was collected before and after gluten challenge from GFD donors confirmed to have CD (n = 27, all HLA-DQ2.5(+) ), GFD donors confirmed not to have CD (n = 6 HLA-DQ2.5(+) , 11 HLA-DQ2.5(-) ) and donors with CD not following GFD (n = 4, all HLA-DQ2.5(+) ). Plasma IFN-gamma and IFN-gamma inducible protein-10 (IP-10) were measured by enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay (ELISA) after whole blood incubation with peptides or gliadin, and correlated with IFN-gamma ELISPOT. No T cell assay could distinguish between CD patients and controls prior to gluten challenge, but after gluten challenge the whole blood IFN-gamma ELISA and the ELISPOT were both 85% sensitive and 100% specific for HLA-DQ2.5(+) CD patients; the whole blood IP-10 ELISA was 94% sensitive and 100% specific. We conclude that whole blood cytokine release assays are sensitive and specific for detection of gluten-reactive T cells in CD; further clinical studies addressing the utility of these tests in patients with an uncertain diagnosis of CD is warranted.},

   abstract = {Celiac disease (CD) is an autoimmune-mediated enteropathy triggered by dietary gluten in genetically prone individuals. The current treatment for CD is a strict lifelong gluten-free diet. However, in some CD patients following a strict gluten-free diet, the symptoms do not remit. These cases may be refractory CD or due to gluten contamination; however, the lack of response could be related to other dietary ingredients, such as maize, which is one of the most common alternatives to wheat used in the gluten-free diet. In some CD patients, as a rare event, peptides from maize prolamins could induce a celiac-like immune response by similar or alternative pathogenic mechanisms to those used by wheat gluten peptides. This is supported by several shared features between wheat and maize prolamins and by some experimental results. Given that gluten peptides induce an immune response of the intestinal mucosa both in vivo and in vitro, peptides from maize prolamins could also be tested to determine whether they also induce a cellular immune response. Hypothetically, maize prolamins could be harmful for a very limited subgroup of CD patients, especially those that are non-responsive, and if it is confirmed, they should follow, in addition to a gluten-free, a maize-free diet.},

   abstract = {Celiac disease (CD) is widespread and is often under diagnosed. It can affect a variety of genetically susceptible people from the young to the old. Presently, the only treatment for celiac patients is lifelong avoidance of any food, drink, sauce, or dressing containing gluten. Scientists and technologists continue in their quest to improve the quality of gluten-free products. Their main goal is to create a product of a similar standard to the gluten-containing products, currently on the market. However, the quality of these products still tends to be poor. Bread products have a low volume, pale crust, crumbly texture, bland flavor and a high rate of staling. Other gluten-free products contain minimal nutrition and substandard product characteristics, for example, pasta having an inferior texture, sauces which separate more easily. The main focus of this review is to discuss the most recent advances in gluten-free research which have arisen between the years 2011 and 2013. In particular, the manuscript focuses on ingredients and processing methods which have been documented to develop or improve the processing characteristics and nutritional properties of gluten-free products.},

Fruit by-products are know from literature to contain a high level of dietary fibre which could improve the bread properties and fibre contents of gluten-free bread. Therefore, a mathematical design was created; three variables were identified from preliminary tests (water (85-100% flour weight, OP 0-8% flour weight and proofing time 35-100 min) as being crucial in the development of acceptable bread. Results illustrated longer proofing times (p<0.05) and lower orange pomace levels (OP) (p<0.001) produced a bread with a greater specific volume. OP had the most significant (p<0.0001) effect on hardness at 2h and 24h post-baking. The optimised formulation was calculated to contain 5.5% OP, 94.6% water and a proofing time of 49 min. Total fibre content of the control bread (2.1%) was successfully increased t o 3.9% in the OP containing bread. Substituting gluten-free flours with orange pomace flour can help improve the total dietary intake of a coeliac while not negating on the quality properties of the bread.},

The aim of this study, the first such study in Iraq, was to assess the serological and histological recovery profiles of coeliac patients, in both children and adults groups after commencing a gluten-free diet (GFD) for at least 1 year +/- 1 month. MATERIAL AND METHODS: The study group comprised 78 proved coeliac patients (46 children and 32 adults, median age: 15 years, range: 1-66 years) who all agreed to undergo endoscopy in addition to serological assessment before and after treatment. The duodenal biopsies were interpreted histologically according to modified Marsh criteria and the sera were tested for anti-gliadin antibody (AGA), endomysium antibody (EMA) and anti-tissue transglutaminase antibody (tTG). RESULTS: Complete histological remission was seen in 29 (63.1%) of 46 treated children CD patients, while only 5 (10.9%) showed Marsh IIIa changes compared with 11 (24%) before GFD. Similarly none of the 32 adults after GFD showed Marsh IIIb and Marsh IIIc compared with 46.9% and 28.1% before treatment respectively (p = 001). Meanwhile, there was strongly significant reduction in AGA, EMA, and tTG antibodies levels (p = 0.00001) following GFD. CONCLUSIONS: Repeating the duodenal biopsy 1 year +/-1 month after diagnosis and starting a GFD supports the routine measurement of using histological findings as a gold standard test to confirm recovery of Iraqi CD patients along with using known coeliac serology antibodies.},

(1) The immunoglobulin A tissue transglutaminase is the single best serologic test to use for the detection of CD. (2) CD can be recognized endoscopically, and water immersion enhances villi detection, although a normal endoscopic appearance does not preclude the diagnosis. (3) It is recommended that 4 biopsies be taken from the second part of the duodenum and 2 bulb biopsies be taken at the 9 o'clock and 12 o'clock positions to maximize the sensitivity for histologic confirmation of CD. (4) Consider serologic testing of first-degree relatives, patients with type 1 diabetes mellitus, Down's, Turner's, and Williams' syndromes, as well as those with premature osteoporosis, iron deficiency, abnormal liver biochemistries, and other manifestations of CD. (5) Patients already on a prolonged gluten-free diet (GFD) should be tested for the presence of HLA DQ2 or DQ8, thereby avoiding the need for further evaluation of CD in non-allelic carriers. (6) The basic treatment of CD is a strict, lifelong GFD, enabled by an expert dietitian. (7) Newly diagnosed adults with CD should be assessed for micronutrient deficiencies (iron, B12, folate, zinc, copper), fat soluble vitamin deficiencies (vitamin D), and bone densitometry. (8) All patients diagnosed with CD should have clinical follow-up to ensure response and adherence to a GFD. (9) In those with persistent or relapsing symptoms, the robustness of the original diagnosis should be reviewed, gluten exposure sought, and a systematic evaluation for alternative and associated diseases performed. (10) Evaluate those with refractory disease for malignant transformation.},

   abstract = {BACKGROUND: Evidence suggests that many coeliac disease patients suffer from persistent clinical symptoms and reduced health-related quality of life despite a strict gluten-free diet. We aimed to find predictors for these continuous health concerns in long-term treated adult coeliac patients. METHODS: In a nationwide study, 596 patients filled validated Gastrointestinal Symptom Rating Scale and Psychological General Well-Being questionnaires and were interviewed regarding demographic data, clinical presentation and treatment of coeliac disease, time and place of diagnosis and presence of coeliac disease-associated or other co-morbidities. Dietary adherence was assessed by a combination of self-reported adherence and serological tests. Odds ratios and 95% confidence intervals were calculated by binary logistic regression. RESULTS: Diagnosis at working age, long duration and severity of symptoms before diagnosis and presence of thyroidal disease, non-coeliac food intolerance or gastrointestinal co-morbidity increased the risk of persistent symptoms. Patients with extraintestinal presentation at diagnosis had fewer current symptoms than subjects with gastrointestinal manifestations. Impaired quality of life was seen in patients with long duration of symptoms before diagnosis and in those with psychiatric, neurologic or gastrointestinal co-morbidities. Patients with persistent symptoms were more likely to have reduced quality of life. CONCLUSIONS: There were a variety of factors predisposing to increased symptoms and impaired quality of life in coeliac disease. Based on our results, early diagnosis of the condition and consideration of co-morbidities may help in resolving long-lasting health problems in coeliac disease.},

   abstract = {BACKGROUND: Negative predictive value (NPV) of celiac disease (CD)-related human leukocyte antigens (HLA) DQ2 and DQ8 approaches 100 % in individual patients. However, studies evaluating its exclusionary utility in patient groups are lacking. AIM: We aim to assess the performance of HLA testing when applied to patient groups with varying characteristics and propose evidence-based recommendations for its clinical use. METHODS: Demographic and clinical information was recorded in patients undergoing HLA testing. Using predetermined criteria, patients were classified as CD, non-CD, or indeterminate. Diagnostic yield of HLA testing was defined as the percentage of patients in whom CD could be excluded based on negative HLA test. RESULTS: Two hundred and fifty-six patients underwent testing for CD-related HLA DQ2 and DQ8. 102 (100 non-CD, 2 CD) patients tested HLA negative for a 98 % NPV and 39 % diagnostic yield. Diagnostic yield was highest (60 %) in patients with intraepithelial lymphocytosis plus normal IgA tissue transglutaminase antibody (IgA-tTG) and lowest in patients with positive IgA-tTG plus villous atrophy (0 %). CD was diagnosed in two HLA-negative patients, who carried half of DQ2.5 trans genotype. CONCLUSIONS: Diagnostic yield of CD-related HLA testing varies widely depending on clinical indication. HLA testing is a practical and valuable test for most patients in whom initial evaluation for CD is inconclusive. A negative HLA result usually obviates the need for further celiac testing including endoscopy and gluten challenge. Rarely, in patients reported as HLA negative, half of HLA DQ2.5 (cis or trans) is sufficient for development of CD.},

   abstract = {Atypical or silent celiac disease may go undiagnosed for many years and can frequently lead to loss of bone mineral density, with evolution to osteopenia or osteoporosis. The prevalence of the latter conditions, in case of new diagnosis of celiac disease, has been evaluated in many studies but, due to the variability of epidemiologic data and patient features, the results are contradictory. The aim of this study was to evaluate bone mineral density by dual-energy X-ray absorptiometry in 175 consecutive celiac patients at time of diagnosis (169 per-protocol, 23 males, 146 females; average age 38.9 years). Dual-energy X-ray absorptiometry was repeated after 1 year of gluten-free diet in those with T-score value <-1 at diagnosis. Stratification of patients according to sex and age showed a higher prevalence of low bone mineral density in men older than 30 years and in women of all ages. A 1-year gluten-free diet led to a significant improvement in lumbar spine and femoral neck mean T-score value. We propose that dual-energy X-ray absorptiometry should be performed at diagnosis of celiac disease in all women and in male aged >30 years, taking into account each risk factor in single patients.},

   abstract = {BACKGROUND: Celiac disease is an inflammatory condition of the small intestine that affects genetically predisposed individuals after dietary wheat gliadin ingestion. Type 2-transglutaminase (TG2) activity seems to be responsible for a strong autoimmune response in celiac disease, TG2 being the main autoantigen. Several studies support the concept that celiac anti-TG2 antibodies may contribute to disease pathogenesis. Our recent findings on the ability of anti-TG2 antibodies to induce a rapid intracellular mobilization of calcium ions, as well as extracellular signal-regulated kinase phosphorylation, suggest that they potentially act as signaling molecules. In line with this concept, we have investigated whether anti-TG2 antibodies can induce phosphoproteome modification in an intestinal epithelial cell line. METHODS AND PRINCIPAL FINDINGS: We studied phosphoproteome modification in Caco-2 cells treated with recombinant celiac anti-TG2 antibodies. We performed a two-dimensional electrophoresis followed by specific staining of phosphoproteins and mass spectrometry analysis of differentially phosphorylated proteins. Of 14 identified proteins (excluding two uncharacterized proteins), three were hypophosphorylated and nine were hyperphosphorylated. Bioinformatics analyses confirmed the presence of phosphorylation sites in all the identified proteins and highlighted their involvement in several fundamental biological processes, such as cell cycle progression, cell stress response, cytoskeletal organization and apoptosis. CONCLUSIONS: Identification of differentially phosphorylated proteins downstream of TG2-antibody stimulation suggests that in Caco-2 cells these antibodies perturb cell homeostasis by behaving as signaling molecules. We hypothesize that anti-TG2 autoantibodies may destabilize the integrity of the intestinal mucosa in celiac individuals, thus contributing to celiac disease establishment and progression. Since several proteins here identified in this study were already known as TG2 substrates, we can also suppose that transamidating activity and differential phosphorylation of the same targets may represent a novel regulatory mechanism whose relevance in celiac disease pathogenesis is still unexplored.},

   abstract = {BACKGROUND: Previous research indicated that coeliac disease (CD) is associated with type 1 diabetes mellitus (T1DM). However, the gut-brain axis peptide hormones secretion has not been evaluated so far in patients with CD prior to treatment initiation or under treatment, irrespective of patients having concomitant T1DM or not. The aim of the study was therefore to evaluate these gut hormones at the preprandial levels of patients with CD before and under treatment. METHODS: Of forty-seven CD children, 12 untreated (UCD), 22 treated with gluten-free diet (TCD) and 13 treated CD with coexisting T1DM (DCD), and 18 healthy controls (HC) were enrolled. Preprandial glucagon-like-peptide-1 (GLP-1), glucose-dependent-insulinotropic-polypeptide (GIP), active amylin, acylated ghrelin (AG), leptin, pancreatic polypeptide (PP) and peptide-tyrosine-tyrosine (PYY) were determined with hormone-map-array technology. RESULTS: We found in patients with CD compared with HC that the concentration of (i) GLP-1 was reduced remarkably in all patients with CD (P = 0.008), (ii) GIP was lower in patients with UCD (P = 0.008), (iii) amylin was remarkably reduced (P < 0.01) in all patients with CD, (iv) AG was significantly decreased in patients with DCD (P < 0.01), while (v) leptin, PP and PYY were not significantly different. GIP, GLP-1 and amylin levels correlated positively with insulin concentrations (P < 0.001, P = 0.004 and P < 0.01, respectively) in all patients. Amylin and GIP levels were strongly associated with triglycerides concentrations (P < 0.001, for both peptides) in children with CD. CONCLUSIONS: Our study revealed a different secretion pattern of gut-brain axis hormones in children with CD compared with HC. The alterations in the axis were more pronounced in children with both CD and T1DM.},

Some gluten-sensitive subjects may have symptoms of GCD, but lack its characteristic changes in the small bowel mucosa (SBM) and a gluten-free diet results in the disappearance of clinical symptoms of GCD. If there is no gluten allergy, the concept "gluten intolerance (GI) unassociated with celiac disease" is applicable in these cases. There is an increase in the prevalence of GCD and GI, which is associated with the use of gluten in food industry to improve the taste and energy density of foods and with the damaging effect of viruses and bacteria on enterocyte membranes, thereby facilitating the penetration of gluten through SBM. The paper gives an update on progress in the diagnosis of GCD and GI and on prospects for designing gluten-free cereals.},

METHODS: We consecutively enrolled 19 children with a new biopsy-proven celiac disease (CD) diagnosis. At CD diagnosis and after 6 months of GFD, each patient underwent a general and neurological examination, an electroencephalogram, a questionnaire about neurological features, and a validated questionnaire about SDB: OSA (obstructive sleep apnea) scores<0 predict normality; values>0 predict OSA. RESULTS: At CD diagnosis, 37% of patients complained headache that affected daily activities and 32% showed positive OSA score. The EEG examinations revealed abnormal finding in 48% of children. After 6 months of GFD headache disappeared in 72% of children and EEG abnormalities in 78%; all children showed negative OSA score. CONCLUSION: According to our preliminary data, in the presence of unexplained EEG abnormalities and/or other neurological disorders/SDB an atypical or silent CD should also be taken into account.},

   abstract = {OBJECTIVE: The occurrence of celiac disease (CD), electroencephalographic (EEG) abnormalities (with "subtle" seizures or even without any clinical seizures), and neurological disorders has been reported since the 1980s, though there has been no definitive consensus about the possible causal relationship. This topic is further complicated by the occurrence in infancy of 'clinical-EEG pictures' called 'benign epilepsy of infancy'. METHODS AND RESULTS: Here, we report a 4-year follow-up on two siblings with newly diagnosed biopsy-proven celiac disease showing EEG abnormalities not responsive to a gluten-free diet. CONCLUSIONS: This family report indicates that in patients with neurologically asymptomatic CD and EEG abnormalities, it is advisable to make a differential diagnosis between EEG abnormalities associated with CD and an incidental association with cortical hyperexcitability, with "subtle" seizures or even without any clinical seizures. PRACTICE IMPLICATIONS: A long follow-up may sometimes be required, as it was in the family described here, to clarify the etiopathogenetic and therapeutic relationships between clinical and EEG features in CD.},

Methods. Celiac patients and controls completed a dietary interview and the Binge Eating Staircases, Eating Disorder Inventory (EDI-2), Eating Attitudes Test, Zung Self-Rating Depression Scale, State Trait Anxiety Inventory Forma Y (STAI-Y1 and STAI-Y2), and Symptom Check List (SCL-90). Results. One hundred celiac adults and 100 controls were not statistically different for gender, age, and physical activity. STAI-Y1 and STAI-Y2, Somatization, Interpersonal, Sensitivity, and Anxiety scores of the SLC-90 were higher in CD patients than controls. EDI-2 was different in pulse thinness, social insecurity, perfectionism, inadequacy, ascetisms, and interpersonal diffidence between CD and HC women, whilst only in interceptive awareness between CD and HC men. A higher EAT-26 score was associated with the CD group dependently with gastrointestinal symptoms. The EAT26 demonstrated association between indices of diet-related disorders in both CD and the feminine gender after controlling for anxiety and depression. Conclusion. CD itself and not gastrointestinal related symptoms or psychological factors may contribute pathological eating behavior in celiac adults. Eating disorders appear to be more frequent in young celiac women than in CD men and in HC.},

   abstract = {Coeliac disease (CD) is an immune-mediated systemic disorder elicited by the ingestion of gluten (found in wheat, rye, and barley) in genetically susceptible individuals. It affects around 1% of children and leads to proximal small bowel enteropathy, although many cases may remain undiagnosed. CD classically presents with gastrointestinal symptoms of diarrhoea, abdominal pain and weight loss, although other symptoms such as iron deficiency anaemia, faltering growth, dental enamel defects, short stature, liver disease, arthropathy, mouth ulcers, etc may be the presenting feature. Breastfeeding is considered to have a beneficial role in preventing CD or at least delays onset. Community practitioners should remain aware of the classical gastrointestinal and other features of CD and make an early referral to medical professionals. Suspicion of CD should lead to antibody screening tests and the diagnosis is confirmed by an intestinal biopsy. A gluten-free diet (GFD) should always be started by paediatric dietitians and they play a vital role in educating and supporting families. Strict adherence to a GFD is essential to maintain good health and to prevent development of long-term complications.},

Strict adherence to a GFD is essential to maintain good health and to prevent long-term complications.},

OBJECTIVE: To translate and adapt CCHS questionnaire to be used by the Spanish-speaking population since it is a specific questionnaire for celiac disease. METHOD: To adapt the CCHS, which consists of 76 items divided into 11 different sections, was performed using translation-back-translation method and after being reviewed and agreed proceeded to conduct a pilot test with 25 people with celiac disease, individually and a member of the research group to assess the understanding of the items and their sections. The contributions were introduced, setting the final questionnaire. RESULTS: The greatest difficulty in the translation in question occurred where there were active and trade names of drugs, opting for it to those marketed nationwide. On the other hand, for the pilot study questionnaire showed a good value of the naturalness of understanding with values between 8.4 and 10.0. CONCLUSIONS: The specific tool CHCS allow the use of a questionnaire that can be used by the Spanish speaking population studies, clinical trials or health professional practice everyday, allowing a better understanding of the health of celiacs.},

   abstract = {Celiac disease is an autoimmune disorder of the gastrointestinal tract. It is triggered by exposure to dietary gluten in genetically susceptible individuals. Gluten is a storage protein in wheat, rye, and barley, which are staples in many American diets. Celiac disease is characterized by chronic inflammation of the small intestinal mucosa, which leads to atrophy of the small intestinal villi and subsequent malabsorption. The condition may develop at any age. Intestinal manifestations include diarrhea and weight loss. Common extraintestinal manifestations include iron deficiency anemia, decreased bone mineral density, and neuropathy. Most cases of celiac disease are diagnosed in persons with extraintestinal manifestations. The presence of dermatitis herpetiformis is pathognomonic for celiac disease. Diagnosis is supported by a positive tissue transglutaminase serologic test but, in general, should be confirmed by a small bowel biopsy showing the characteristic histology associated with celiac disease. The presence of human leukocyte antigen alleles DQ2, DQ8, or both is essential for the development of celiac disease, and can be a useful genetic test in select instances. Treatment of celiac disease is a gluten-free diet. Dietary education should focus on identifying hidden sources of gluten, planning balanced meals, reading labels, food shopping, dining out, and dining during travel. About 5% of patients with celiac disease are refractory to a gluten-free diet. These patients should be referred to a gastroenterologist for reconsideration of the diagnosis or for aggressive treatment of refractory celiac disease, which may involve corticosteroids and immunomodulators.},

   abstract = {Gluten-free diet (GFD) is the cornerstone treatment for celiac disease (CD). GFD implies a strict and lifelong elimination from the diet of gluten, the storage protein found in wheat, barley, rye and hybrids of these grains, such as kamut and triticale. The absence of gluten in natural and processed foods, despite being the key aspect of GFD, may lead to nutritional consequences, such as deficits and imbalances. The nutritional adequacy of GFD is particularly important in children, this the age being of maximal energy and nutrient requirements for growth, development and activity. In recent years, attention has focused on the nutritional quality of gluten-free products (GFPs) available in the market. It is well recognized that GFPs are considered of lower quality and poorer nutritional value compared to the gluten-containing counterparts. The present review focuses on the nutritional adequacy of GFD at the pediatric age, with the aim being to increase awareness of the potential complications associated with this diet, to identify strategies in order to avoid them and to promote a healthier diet and lifestyle in children with CD.},

Pseudocereals are receiving considerable attention as interesting alternatives for the formulation of gluten-free products, and quinoa grains arise as nutritive substitutes of conventional cereals. The aim of this study was the characterization of different quinoa samples corresponding to 11 quinoa varieties, using polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis in the presence of sodium dodecyl sulfate (SDS-PAGE) and immunoblotting techniques to assess their suitability for celiac subjects. Some of these varieties were grown in Italy to assess if the reproduction in a new habitat can guarantee the retention of the "safe" protein pattern. None of the quinoa varieties studied presented protein bands with electrophoretic mobility comparable with those of wheat gliadins, the toxic protein for celiac subjects. All the quinoa samples showed a low binding affinity for both specific anti-gliadin antibodies and IgAs from celiac subjects, confirming that quinoa can be considered as a safe ingredient for celiac patients. However, reliable varieties should be previously selected since the immuno cross-reactivity with anti-gliadin antibodies can vary significantly.},

   abstract = {AIM: To determine the long-term outcomes of patients in whom no initial cause for their anaemia is established. METHOD: Six hundred and thirty-nine patients presenting to an iron deficiency anaemia pathway were prospectively entered onto a database. Initial assessment included haematological review, coeliac screen, oesophagogastroduodenoscopy and colonic imaging as per British Society of Gastroenterology guidelines. A 5-year audit of outcomes was undertaken using patient medical records and hospital laboratory databases. RESULTS: A diagnosis was found initially in 266 (42%) patients, with 124 (19%) having a gastrointestinal (GI) luminal neoplasm, 54 (8%) of which were malignant. Twelve patients had a nonluminal or non-GI malignancy. Eighty-eight (14%) had benign upper GI bleeding and 23 (4%) had coeliac disease. One hundred and forty-three (22%) did not have confirmed iron deficiency anaemia on review of haematinics. Complete records were available for 595 (93%) patients at 5 years. Of the 373 patients in whom a cause was not initially diagnosed, 6 (2%) were ultimately diagnosed with a GI luminal malignancy and 18 (5%) with a nonluminal or non-GI malignancy. There was no difference in the incidence of malignancies between those with or without confirmed iron deficiency. CONCLUSIONS: Most patients in whom no cause was found at initial investigation resolve on oral iron supplements. Patients with normal ferritin values had as high an incidence of GI malignancies as those with low values and should be investigated. In the over 50s if the anaemia remains after a course of iron further investigation is recommended as there is a significant incidence of both GI and non-GI pathology.},

   abstract = {INTRODUCTION: Celiac disease (CD) may initially present as a neurological disorder or may be complicated by neurological changes. To date, neurophysiological studies aiming to an objective evaluation of the potential central nervous system involvement in CD are lacking. OBJECTIVE: To assess the profile of cortical excitability to Transcranial Magnetic Stimulation (TMS) in a group of de novo CD patients. MATERIALS AND METHODS: Twenty CD patients underwent a screening for cognitive and neuropsychiatric symptoms by means of the Mini Mental State Examination and the Structured Clinical Interview for DSM-IV Axis I Disorders, respectively. Instrumental exams, including electroencephalography and brain computed tomography, were also performed. Cortico-spinal excitability was assessed by means of single and paired-pulse TMS using the first dorsal interosseus muscle of the dominant hand. TMS measures consisted of resting motor threshold, motor evoked potentials, cortical silent period (CSP), intracortical inhibition (ICI) and facilitation (ICF). None of the CD was on gluten-free diet. A group of 20 age-matched healthy controls was used for comparisons. RESULTS: CD showed a significantly shorter CSP (78.0 vs 125.0 ms, p<0.025), a reduced ICI (0.3 vs 0.2, p<0.045) and an enhanced ICF (1.1 vs 0.7, p<0.042) compared to controls. A dysthymic disorder was identified in five patients. The effect size between dysthymic and non-dysthymic CD patients indicated a low probability of interference with the CSP (Cohen's d -0.414), ICI (-0.278) and ICF (-0.292) measurements. CONCLUSION: A pattern of cortical excitability characterized by "disinhibition" and "hyperfacilitation" was found in CD patients. Immune system dysregulation might play a central role in triggering changes of the motor cortex excitability.},

   abstract = {BACKGROUND AND AIMS: The association of celiac disease with colorectal neoplasia is controversial. The aim of this study was to determine the risk of colorectal neoplasia among patients with celiac disease. METHODS: We carried out a multicenter, retrospective case-control study, within four community hospitals. Celiac disease patients with a complete colonoscopy were regarded as cases and those without celiac disease as controls. For each case, two controls matched for age, sex, indication for colonoscopy and colorectal cancer family history, were randomly selected. The main outcome evaluated was risk of colorectal polyps, adenomas, advanced neoplastic lesions and cancer. RESULTS: We identified 118 patients with celiac disease and 236 controls. The risk of polyps, adenomas and advanced neoplastic lesions was similar in both groups (OR 1.25, CI 0.71-2.18, p=0.40; OR 1.39, CI 0.73-2.63, p=0.31; and OR 1.00, CI 0.26-3.72, p=1.00, respectively). On multivariate analysis, age >75 years old, and first-grade CRC family history were associated with adenomas (OR 2.68 CI 1.03-6.98, OR 6.68 CI 1.03-47.98 respectively) and advanced neoplastic lesions (OR 15.03, CI 2.88-78.3; OR 6.46 CI 1.23-33.79, respectively). With respect to celiac disease characteristic, a low adherence to a gluten free diet was independently associated with the presence of adenomas (OR 6.78 CI 1.39-33.20 p=0.01). CONCLUSIONS: Celiac disease was not associated with an increased risk of colorectal neoplasia. Nonadherence to a strict gluten free diet was associated with the presence of adenomas. Further studies addressing celiac disease characteristics are needed to confirm this observation.},

   abstract = {BACKGROUND: Current evidence suggests that many patients with self-reported non-coeliac gluten sensitivity (NCGS) retain gastrointestinal symptoms on a gluten-free diet (GFD) but continue to restrict gluten as they report 'feeling better'. AIM: To investigate the notion that a major effect of gluten in those with NCGS is on mental state and not necessarily on gastrointestinal symptoms. METHODS: Twenty-two subjects (24-62 years, five male) with irritable bowel syndrome who had coeliac disease excluded but were symptomatically controlled on a GFD, undertook a double-blind cross-over study. Participants randomly received one of three dietary challenges for 3 days, followed by a minimum 3-day washout before crossing over to the next diet. Challenge gluten-free food was supplemented with gluten (16 g/day), whey (16 g/day) or not supplemented (placebo). End-points included mental state as assessed by the Spielberger State Trait Personality Inventory (STPI), cortisol secretion and gastrointestinal symptoms. RESULTS: Gluten ingestion was associated with higher overall STPI state depression scores compared to placebo [M = 2.03, 95% CI (0.55-3.51), P = 0.010] but not whey [M = 1.48, 95% CI (-0.14 to 3.10), P = 0.07]. No differences were found for other STPI state indices or for any STPI trait measures. No difference in cortisol secretion was identified between challenges. Gastrointestinal symptoms were induced similarly across all dietary challenges. CONCLUSIONS: Short-term exposure to gluten specifically induced current feelings of depression with no effect on other indices or on emotional disposition. Gluten-specific induction of gastrointestinal symptoms was not identified. Such findings might explain why patients with non-coeliac gluten sensitivity feel better on a gluten-free diet despite the continuation of gastrointestinal symptoms.},

   abstract = {Celiac disease is a T cell-mediated disease induced by dietary gluten, a component of which is gliadin. 95% of individuals with celiac disease carry the HLA (human leukocyte antigen)-DQ2 locus. Here we determined the T-cell receptor (TCR) usage and fine specificity of patient-derived T-cell clones specific for two epitopes from wheat gliadin, DQ2.5-glia-alpha1a and DQ2.5-glia-alpha2. We determined the ternary structures of four distinct biased TCRs specific for those epitopes. All three TCRs specific for DQ2.5-glia-alpha2 docked centrally above HLA-DQ2, which together with mutagenesis and affinity measurements provided a basis for the biased TCR usage. A non-germline encoded arginine residue within the CDR3beta loop acted as the lynchpin within this common docking footprint. Although the TCRs specific for DQ2.5-glia-alpha1a and DQ2.5-glia-alpha2 docked similarly, their interactions with the respective gliadin determinants differed markedly, thereby providing a basis for epitope specificity.},

   abstract = {The prevalence of dyspepsia is up to 40% in population-based study. Functional dyspepsia is an exclusion diagnosis and it is classified as a chronic abdominal pain-related functional disorder, characterized by the presence of persistent or recurrent pain or discomfort centered in the upper abdomen, neither relief by defecation, nor association with the onset of a change in stool frequency or form. Celiac disease (CD) is a common autoimmune enteropathy, with a prevalence around 1% in the general population. Its diagnosis includes a serological screening and an upper gastrointestinal endoscopy with multiple biopsies. Gluten-free diet is the only effective treatment. CD diagnosis is often delayed in asymptomatic patients or in individuals with less clinical gastrointestinal symptoms. Several studies performed coeliac disease screening in patients with symptoms suggestive of dyspepsia, showing a biopsy-proved prevalence that ranged from 0.5% to 2%. The typical endoscopic markers of villous atrophy are not sufficiently sensitive, so some endoscopic techniques, such as "water immersion" and confocal endomicroscopy were proposed to improve the diagnostic sensitivity and target biopsies. A recent meta-analysis estimated that the prevalence of CD was higher in patients with dyspepsia, but not in a statistically significant way. However this assumption should be confirmed further larger studies.},

   abstract = {AIMS: There are conflicting data on microvascular complications in coexisting Type 1 diabetes and coeliac disease. We compared complications rates in youth with or without coeliac disease and examined the association between gluten-free diet adherence and complications. METHODS: This was a comparative study of adolescents (2510 without coeliac disease, 129 with coeliac disease); 60 (47%) did not adhere to a gluten-free diet--defined as elevated anti-tissue transglutaminase or endomysial immunoglobulin A titres. Retinopathy was detected using 7-field fundal photography and albumin excretion rate by timed overnight urine collections, with early elevation defined as albumin excretion rate >/= 7.5 mug/min. Logistic regression was used to examine the association between complications and explanatory variables, including coeliac disease vs. no coeliac disease, gluten-free diet adherence vs. non-adherence, diabetes duration and HbA1c . RESULTS: Median age at last assessment was 16.5 years. Those with coeliac disease vs. those without were younger at diabetes diagnosis (7.1 vs. 8.6 years, P < 0.001) and had longer diabetes duration (9.3 vs. 7.2 years, P < 0.001). HbA1c was lower in those with coeliac disease vs. those without (67 vs. 70 mmol/mol, 8.3 vs. 8.6%, P = 0.04) and adherence to a gluten-free diet vs. non-adherence (66 vs. 72 mmol/mol, 8.2 vs. 8.7%, P = 0.003). There were no differences in complication rates between those with coeliac disease vs. those without (retinopathy 22 vs. 23%, elevated albumin excretion rate 31 vs. 28%). Non-adherence to a gluten-free diet was associated with elevated albumin excretion rate (40 vs. 23%, P = 0.04). In multivariable logistic regression, elevated albumin excretion rate was associated with non-adherence to a gluten-free diet (odds ratio 2.37, 95% CI 1.04-5.40, P = 0.04) and diabetes duration (odds ratio 1.13, 95% CI 1.02-1.25, P = 0.03), but not HbA1c . CONCLUSIONS: While glycaemic control is better in patients with coeliac disease, non-adherence to a gluten-free diet is associated with elevated albumin excretion rate. The possible protection of a gluten-free diet on complications warrants further investigation.},

   abstract = {INTRODUCTION: Celiac disease (CD) is an autoimmune disorder triggered by the ingestion of gluten. Serology and organ culture system can support CD diagnosis, despite histology being the gold standard. AIM: We wanted to test the uniformity of application of Marsh-Oberhuber criteria by five different histologists. We also compared histological and serological data with cultural results to consider new possible strategies in CD diagnosis. METHODS: We studied 114 patients, who were divided in two groups. Group A was composed of 66 patients on a gluten-containing diet, with gluten-related signs and symptoms, showing positive serological anti-endomysial antibodies (EMA) and anti-tissue transglutaminase (anti- tTG). Group B was composed of 48 disease-control patients, presenting serological EMA and anti-tTG negative results. All patients studied underwent esophagogastroduodenoscopy with duodenal biopsy and duodenal mucosa organ culture. All histological samples were evaluated by five different histologists according to an appropriate questionnaire following Marsh-Oberhuber classification. Cohen kappa inter-test was used for evaluating the agreement between histologists regarding group A. RESULTS: Strength of agreement was fair/moderate for villous:crypt ratio, moderate/good for villous height and crypt depth, and poor for intraepithelial lymphocytosis. Patients belonging to group A presented positive serological as well as cultural results in 100% of cases. None of the patients belonging to group B presented serological or cultural positive results. DISCUSSION: Our study stresses the limits of histological interpretation due to the lack of uniformity in the use of Marsh-Oberhuber classification. These findings could cast doubt on the role of histology as CD gold standard and could open a debate on the most appropriate CD diagnostic procedure.},

   abstract = {PURPOSE: Celiac disease (CD), a systemic autoimmune disorder that typically involves duodenal mucosa, can also affect other intestinal areas. Duodenal and oral mucosa organ culture has already been demonstrated as a reliable procedure to identify CD. The present study investigated gluten-dependent immunological activation of colonic mucosa in CD patients. We took advantage of the numerous colonoscopies performed for various clinical conditions or only for defensive medicine. METHODS: Forty-four patients with gastrointestinal symptoms or in need of colorectal cancer screening were divided into patients with serum anti-endomysium (EMA) and anti-tissue transglutaminase (anti-tTG) antibody positive results (Group A), patients with serum antibody negative results (Group B), and patients with inflammatory bowel disease (IBD) (Group C). The autoantibodies EMA and anti-tTG were evaluated in supernatants of cultured sigmoid and duodenal biopsies from patients on a gluten-containing diet. RESULTS: In Group A, EMA and anti-tTG resulted positive in all duodenal culture supernatants. In sigmoid culture supernatants, EMA and anti-tTG were detected in 12/16 (75 %) and 13/16 (81.3 %) patients, respectively. In Group B, none of the 17 patients showed EMA and anti-tTG positive results in both duodenal and sigmoid cultures. In Group C, all 11 patients presented EMA negative results in sigmoid cultures. Only in one patient, anti-tTG were detectable in the sigmoid culture supernatant, as expected in cases of IBD. CONCLUSIONS: Data confirm that the gluten-dependent immunological activation affects more intestinal tracts with different degrees of involvement, suggesting that the organ culture of colonic biopsies could represent a new tool to opportunistically detect CD.},

   abstract = {The existence of mild forms of celiac disease (CD) can make the histology-based diagnosis difficult to reach. Since anti-endomysium (EMA) and anti-tissue transglutaminase (anti-tTG) are detectable in culture supernatants of duodenal biopsies from CD patients, our aim was to assess if this system can support the histology in the diagnostic work-up. A total of 559 suspected CD patients underwent serum EMA/anti-tTG detection, upper endoscopy with duodenal biopsy sampling, histologic analysis, and organ culture to detect EMA/anti-tTG in supernatants. A subgroup of 30 patients with organ culture positive results were put on a gluten-free diet (GFD). Their gluten-dependency was evaluated by the psychological general well-being and beck depression inventory indexes. Statistical analysis was performed by Cohen k inter-test, Friedman test, and Dunn multiple comparison. Two hundred forty-one out of 559 (43.1%) patients showed intestinal villous atrophy, whereas serum and organ culture EMA/anti-tTG were positive in 293/559 (52.4%) and 334/559 (59.7%) patients, respectively. The strength of agreement resulted good for serology vs histology (k = 0.730), good for organ culture vs histology (k = 0.662), and very good for serology vs organ culture (k = 0.852). After 12 months of GFD, psychological general well-being index significantly increased, and beck depression inventory index significantly decreased (P < 0.001 for each one). Data highlight the organ culture system as a useful tool to assist the histology in diagnosing CD, mainly in cases without villous atrophy or in seronegative patients. The marked improvement in quality of life after a GFD further supports the reliability of this system in diagnosing CD.},

   abstract = {Celiac disease is an immune-mediated enteropathy triggered by the ingestion of gluten. The only effective treatment consists in a lifelong gluten-free diet, requiring the food industry to tightly control the gluten contents of their products. To date, several gluten quantification approaches using antibodies are available and recommended by the legal authorities, such as Codex Alimentarius. However, whilst these antibody-based tests exhibit high sensitivity and specificity, the production of antibodies inherently requires the killing of host animals and is time-consuming and relatively expensive. Aptamers are structured single-stranded nucleic acid ligands that bind with high affinity and specificity to their cognate target, and aiming for a cost-effective viable alternative to the use of antibodies. Herein, we report the systematic evolution of ligands by exponential enrichment (SELEX)-based selection of a DNA aptamer against gliadin from a combinatorial DNA library and its application in a novel detection assay. Taking into account the hydrophobic nature of the gliadin target, a microtitre plate format was exploited for SELEX, where the target was immobilised via hydrophobic interactions, thus exposing aptatopes accessible for interaction with the DNA library. Evolution was followed using surface plasmon resonance, and following eight rounds of SELEX, the enriched DNA pool was cloned, sequenced and a clear consensus motif was identified. An apta-PCR assay was developed where competition for the aptamer takes place between the surface-immobilised gliadin and gliadin in the target sample, akin to an ELISA competitive format where the more target present in the sample, the less aptamer will bind to the immobilised gliadin. Following competition, any aptamer bound to the immobilised gliadin was heat-eluted and quantitatively amplified using real-time PCR, achieving a detection limit of approx. 2 nM (100 ng mL(-1)). The specificity of the selected aptamer was demonstrated and no cross-reactivity was observed with streptavidin, bovine serum albumin or anti-gliadin IgG.},

   abstract = {Stem cells (SCs) are the key to tissue genesis and regeneration. Given their central role in homeostasis, dysfunctions of the SC compartment play a pivotal role in the development of cancers, degenerative disorders, chronic inflammatory pathologies and organ failure. The gastrointestinal tract is constantly exposed to harsh mechanical and chemical conditions and most of the epithelial cells are replaced every 3 to 5 d. According to the so-called Unitarian hypothesis, this renewal is driven by a common intestinal stem cell (ISC) residing within the crypt base at the origin of the crypt-to-villus hierarchical migratory pattern. Celiac disease (CD) can be defined as a chronic immune-mediated disease that is triggered and maintained by dietary proteins (gluten) in genetically predisposed individuals. Many advances have been achieved over the last years in understanding of the pathogenic interactions among genetic, immunological and environmental factors in CD, with a particular emphasis on intestinal barrier and gut microbiota. Conversely, little is known about ISC modulation and deregulation in active celiac disease and upon a gluten-free diet. Nonetheless, bone marrow-derived SC transplantation has become an option for celiac patients with complicated or refractory disease. This manuscript summarizes the "state of the art" regarding CD and ISCs, their niche and potential role in the development and treatment of the disease.},

   abstract = {INTRODUCTION: Selected IgA deficiency (IgAD) and common variable immune deficiency (CVID) are humoral immunity deficiencies frequent in children. In both these types of immunodeficiency, autoimmune diseases are present in 20-30% of patients, but the disease profiles are different between adults and children. Autoimmune diseases of the gastrointestinal tract (IBD) and celiac disease are typical for children with IgAD and CVID. Diagnosis is based on clinical symptoms, histology of jejunum and antibodies often preceding the onset of disease. However, the diagnosis of IBD and celiac disease is difficult in immune deficiency patients due to weaker or absent production of antibodies, and different jejunum histology, particular in CVID patients. AIM: Detection of antibodies for autoimmune diseases in children with diagnosis of CVID and IgAD. MATERIAL AND METHODS: The study included 43 children with CVID and 63 children with IgAD diagnosis. Antibodies typical for celiac disease (for endomysium, tissue transglutaminase and gliadin) were tested in IgA class (CVID patients), IgG class (IgAD, CVID patients) and found in 16 patients (3 - CVID, 13 - IgAD). RESULTS: Antibodies for IBD (for Saccharomyces cerevisiae antigen - ASCA, goblet cells - Gab, neutrophil's cytoplasm - ANCA, pancreatic cells - Pab) were noted in 17 patients (7 - CVID, 10 - IgAD). Celiac disease was diagnosed in two children with mild and unspecific clinical symptoms followed by introduction of a gluten-free diet. The remaining children with present antibodies but without clinical symptoms involving the gastrointestinal tract are under careful clinical observation with antibody assay every 6 months. CONCLUSIONS: The antibodies are produced despite impaired humoral immunity but the level might be low so the lower limit of positive results is postulated.},

DH is characterized by subepidermal bullae on hematoxylin and eosin staining and granular immunoglobulin A deposits in the dermal papillae using the direct immunofluorescence method. Antibodies to tissue transglutaminase and epidermal transgulatminase can be measured serologically, although biopsy is still required for definitive diagnosis of DH. Gluten free diet (GFD) is the first-line therapeutic approach that can alleviate both cutaneous and intestinal manifestations of this condition, while dapsone and sulfones target the skin eruption only. Combined therapy with GFD and dapsone is an initial treatment of choice to control the cutaneous manifestations of DH.

   abstract = {Differences between children and adults in celiac disease (CD) presentation and epidemiology are reviewed here. Clinical manifestations, histological changes, serology, and response to gluten-free diet are similar. Differences exist in epidemiology, type of clinical presentations, coexisting diseases, complications, and association with obesity. CD is two to five times more common in children than in adults. Classical CD with gastrointestinal symptoms is more common in children whereas nonclassical CD dominates in adults. A gene dose phenomenon (double-dose HLA-DQB1 02 allele) is postulated to be responsible for this difference. Coexisting autoimmune diseases like diabetes mellitus type 1, Sjogren's syndrome, and dermatitis herpetiformis are more common in adults than in children (42 % vs. 5 %). The association of overweight/obesity and CD is stronger in adults than in children (22.5 % vs. 14 %). Besides poor compliance, pancreatic insufficiency, bacterial overgrowth, lactose intolerance, irritable bowel syndrome, lymphocytic colitis, and microscopic colitis are considered responsible for nonresponsive CD in adults but not in children. Complications like refractory sprue and small intestinal neoplasms are seen exclusively in adults. Existing diagnostic criteria (modified ESPGHAN) are not suitable for diagnosing CD in adults as the majority of cases are either nonclassical or subclinical CD.},

   abstract = {AIM: As there is no report of toddler's diarrhea (TD) from the developing world, we have analyzed our experience of 191 children (<5 years) with chronic diarrhea over 7 years. METHODS: Clinical details, investigations and outcome were retrieved and recorded in a proforma. TD was ascribed in those who had normal growth and no evidence of malabsorption or enteric infections. RESULTS: The etiology of chronic diarrhea was TD 16%, celiac disease (CD) 37%, cow's milk protein allergy (CMPA) 35% and others 12%. The mean age of 30 children with TD was 2.7 +/- 1.2 years (22 boys). While comparing TD with CD and CMPA, weight z score (>-2.2) and hemoglobin (>10 or 10.9 g/dL for CD and CMPA, respectively) were independent variables to discriminate TD from CD and CMPA. CONCLUSIONS: TD is common in developing countries like India too. Anthropometry and hemoglobin can differentiate it from CD and CMPA.},

   abstract = {BACKGROUND: The cavitating mesenteric lymph node syndrome (CMLNS) is a rare manifestation of celiac disease, with an estimated mortality rate of 50%. Specific infections and malignant lymphoma may complicate its clinical course and contribute to its poor prognosis. Diagnosing the underlying cause of CMLNS can be challenging. This is the first report on contrast enhanced ultrasound (CEUS) findings in enteropathy associated T-cell lymphoma (EATL) complicating CMLNS in a gluten-free compliant patient with persistent symptoms and poor outcome. CASE PRESENTATION: We present the case of a 51-year old Caucasian male patient, diagnosed with celiac disease and CMLNS. Despite his compliance to the gluten-free diet the symptoms persisted and we eventually considered the possible development of malignancy. No mucosal changes suggestive of lymphoma were identified with capsule endoscopy. Low attenuation mesenteric lymphadenopathy, without enlarged small bowel segments were seen on computed tomography. CEUS revealed arterial rim enhancement around the necrotic mesenteric lymph nodes, without venous wash-out. No malignant cells were identified on laparoscopic mesenteric lymph nodes biopsies. The patient died due to fulminant liver failure 14 months later; the histopathological examination revealed CD3/CD30-positive atypical T-cell lymphocytes in the liver, mesenteric tissue, spleen, gastric wall, kidney, lung and bone marrow samples; no malignant cells were present in the small bowel samples. CONCLUSIONS: CEUS findings in EATL complicating CMLNS include arterial rim enhancement of the mesenteric tissue around the cavitating lymph nodes, without venous wash-out. This vascular pattern is not suggestive for neoangiogenesis, as arteriovenous shunts from malignant tissues are responsible for rapid venous wash-out of the contrast agent. CEUS failed to provide a diagnosis in this case.},

   abstract = {Wheat (Triticum spp. L.), rye (Secale cereal L.), and barley (Hordeum vulgare L.) seeds contain peptides toxic to celiac patients. Maize (Zea mays L.) and rice (Oryza sativa L.) are distant relatives of wheat as well as sorghum (Sorghum bicolor (L.) Moench) and are known to be safe for celiacs. Both immunochemical studies and in vitro and in vivo challenge of wheat-free sorghum food products support this conclusion, although molecular evidence is missing. The goal of the present study was to provide biochemical and genetic evidence that sorghum is safe for celiac patients. In silico analysis of the recently published sorghum genome predicts that sorghum does not contain peptides that are toxic for celiac patients. Aqueous/alcohol-soluble prolamins (kafirins) from different sorghum varieties, including pure lines and hybrids, were evaluated by SDS-PAGE and HPLC analyses as well as an established enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay (ELISA) based on the R5 antibody. These analyses provide molecular evidence for the absence of toxic gliadin-like peptides in sorghum, confirming that sorghum can be definitively considered safe for consumption by people with celiac disease.},

   abstract = {BACKGROUND: Celiac disease (CD) is an immune-mediated intolerance to dietary gluten, affecting genetically predisposed individuals. ELISA-based serological tests help to decide if further duodenal biopsy is necessary, for this the diagnostic kits have to be accurate, specific, and sensible. In this study, we investigate the performance of an ELISA that uses the purified cross-linked complex of tissue transglutaminase and gliadin, referred as the "neoepitope" (AESKULISA(R) tTG New Generation), as antigen. METHODS: We evaluated 41 newly diagnosed celiac patients, 18 celiac patients on gluten-free diet, and 169 controls, comprising healthy subjects, patients affected by other autoimmune diseases, and patients affected by several non-autoimmune diseases. RESULTS AND CONCLUSION: The assay has an excellent performance. Due to its high level of diagnostic accuracy, this assay constitutes a new approach for the screening of celiac patients not only for the diagnosis of CD, but also for monitoring patients on gluten-free diet and their compliance. Moreover, cases of neoepitope-positive subjects who were tested negative with "classical" serological markers could have a predictive value for this pathology. This aspect will require further studies of elaboration.},

   abstract = {AIM: To establish how clinicians in New Zealand (NZ) approach screening for and management of coeliac disease (CD) in type 1 diabetes mellitus (T1DM) in their paediatric patients. METHODS: All clinicians caring for children under 15 years with T1DM in NZ in 2010 were asked to complete an online survey detailing their personal and departmental approach to diagnosing and managing patients with CD and T1DM. RESULTS: Thirty-four from 37 clinicians responded to the survey. Most clinicians in NZ have a protocol for screening for CD in T1DM, and 25/34 respondents will screen for CD at diagnosis of T1DM. Those who do not screen will use symptoms, growth and hypoglycaemia as indicators to test. All use anti-tissue transglutaminase to screen for CD, and 32/34 use biopsy-proven CD as a criterion for commencing gluten-free diet (GFD). Nearly all consultants will still advise a GFD in symptom-free CD and will try to encourage the patients to adopt a GFD if they initially decline. CONCLUSIONS: Most clinicians in NZ screen for CD, but there is a wide variation in practice.},

   abstract = {BACKGROUND AND OBJECTIVE: Celiac disease (CD) is a common chronic autoimmune disorder. Both the manifestations of the disease and the burden of the compulsory life-long gluten-free diet (GFD) have been shown to be associated with impairment of health-related quality of life. The objectives of this study were to provide a cross-cultural adaptation of the specific quality of life "Celiac Disease Questionnaire" (CDQ) and to analyze its psychometric properties. MATERIALS AND METHODS: A cross-cultural French adaptation of the CDQ (F-CDQ) was obtained according to the revised international guidelines. The questionnaire was administered at baseline to 211 patients with biopsy proven CD followed-up in a single tertiary referral centre. The questionnaire was also administered after 7 days and 6 months. Reliability (intraclass correlation coefficients (ICC), Cronbach's alpha and Bland and Altman graphical analysis), validity (factorial structure and Rasch analysis, convergent validity), and responsiveness (effect size) of the F-CDQ were studied. RESULTS: The reliability of the F-CDQ was excellent with ICC and Cronbach's alpha coefficients being between 0.79 and 0.94 for the four subscales and the total score. The factorial structure and the Rasch analysis showed that the four dimensions of the original instrument were retained. Correlations with external measures (a generic measure of quality of life, an anxiety and depression instrument, a self-assessed disease severity, and clinical manifestations) were all in the expected direction confirming the validity of the instrument. Responsiveness was studied and effect sizes >/= 0.20 were demonstrated for most of the subscales for patients who reported improvement or deterioration after 6 months. CONCLUSION: The F-CDQ retains the psychometric properties of the original instrument and should be useful in cross-national surveys and to assess outcome in clinical trials involving patients with CD.},

   abstract = {INTRODUCTION: Celiac disease (CD) is an autoimmunological gluten sensitive enteropathy occuring to genetically predisposed individuals. Active CD is accompanied by presence of multiple antibodies. Anti alpha enolase antibodies were reported in several autoimmunological disorders like rheumatoid arthritis, primary sclerosing cholangitis. Data about its presence and role in CD is avaricious. AIM: The aim of this study was to determine presence of anti alpha enolase antibodies in CD, correlation with gluten exposure, presence of anti tranglutaminase antibodies and Marsh scale. METHODS: Sera from 31 patients with CD (21 females, 10 males) and 6 healthy subjects were collected. Evaluation of CD activity and adherence to gluten free diet were obtained by serology tests (presence of endomyslum antibodies and/or anti transglutamineses in IgA or IgG classes) and histological hallmarks. Anti alpha enolase antibodies were identified in sera using ELISA kit. Titres of anti alpha enolase antibodies were identified among patients with newly diagnosed CD, CD patients non adhering to gluten free diet (GFD), adhering to GFD and among healthy subjects. RESULTS: Mean titre of anti alpha enolase antibodies was higher in CD patients (both treated and non treated) in comparison to control group, respectively 1.1 ng/mL, and 0.795 ngl mL. Among CD patients non adhering to gluten free diet mean titre was 1.4 ng/mL. CONCLUSIONS: Higher anti alpha enolase antibodies titres in non treated CD suggest usefulness of its measurement. These antibodies might be a novel marker of chronic inflammation among CD patients non adhering to GFD.},

The treatment of celiac disease involves a gluten-free diet, which is complex and challenging. OBJECTIVE: To evaluate clinical features and symptom recovery on a gluten-free diet in a Canadian adult celiac population. METHODS: All adult members (n=10,693) of the two national celiac support organizations, the Canadian Celiac Association and Fondation quebecoise de la maladie coeliaque, were surveyed using a questionnaire. RESULTS: A total of 5912 individuals (>/=18 years of age) with biopsy-confirmed celiac disease andor dermatitis herpetiformis completed the survey. The female to male ratio was 3:1, and mean (+/- SD) age at diagnosis was 45.2 +/- 16.4 years. Mean time to diagnosis after onset of symptoms was 12.0 +/- 14.4 years. Abdominal pain and bloating (84.9%), extreme weaknesstiredness (74.2%), diarrhea (71.7%) and anemia (67.8%) were the most commonly reported symptoms at the time of diagnosis. Many respondents continued to experience symptoms after being on a gluten-free diet for >5 years. Sex differences were reported in clinical features before diagnosis, recovery after being on gluten-free diet and perceived quality of life, with women experiencing more difficulties than men. CONCLUSIONS: Delays in diagnosis of celiac disease in Canada remain unacceptably long despite wider availability of serological screening tests. Many patients report continuing symptoms despite adhering to a gluten-free diet for >5 years, with women experiencing more symptoms and a lower recovery rate than men. Awareness of celiac disease needs improvement, and follow-up with a physician and a dietitian is essential for all patients with celiac disease.},

   abstract = {CD4(+) T cells that recognize dietary gluten antigens presented by the disease-associated HLA-DQ2 or DQ8 molecules are central players in coeliac disease. Unbiased sequencing of the human TCRalpha variable (TRAV) and humanTCRbeta variable (TRBV) genes of 68 HLA-DQ2.5-glia-alpha2-specific T cells from coeliac disease patients confirmed previous reports of over-usage of the TRBV7-2 gene segment, a conserved Arg residue in the complementarity-determining region (CDR) 3beta loop and prevalent usage of the canonical ASSxRxTDTQY CDR3beta loop among T cells with this specificity. In 30 clones that had the canonical TCRbeta chain, we found a strict usage of the TRAV26-1 gene segment in the TCRalpha chain. There was variable usage of the TRAJ genes and diverse CDR3alpha sequences with no apparent conserved motifs. This study extends previous reports on biased TCR usage in both HLA-DQ2.5- and DQ8-restricted gluten-specific TCRs and provides data for further studies on TRAV and TRBV pairing.},

   abstract = {BACKGROUND: The present study aimed to determine whether psychological well-being and weight-teasing history of young adults with bowel conditions (i.e. coeliac disease, inflammatory bowel diseases and irritable bowel syndrome) differed from those without bowel conditions. METHODS: Young adults (aged 18-26 years) completed an online survey that collected demographic information and assessed psychological well-being (mentally and physically unhealthy days, self-esteem, and depression, anxiety and obsessive compulsive disorder severity) and weight-teasing history (Perception of Teasing Scale). Each bowel condition participant (cases = 135) was matched to four healthy participants (controls = 504) based on sex and body mass index (BMI) (+/-0.50 BMI units). Conditional logistic regression analyses were conducted and odds ratios (OR) and 95% confidence intervals (CI) were presented for all measures and demographics. RESULTS: Cases were significantly more likely to have poorer overall psychological well-being. Specifically, cases were significantly (P </= 0.05) more likely to have more mentally and physical unhealthy days, depression, anxiety, and obsessive compulsive disorder symptoms than controls. Cases were also significantly more likely to recall being weight teased as a child (P = 0.02, OR = 1.26, 95% CI = 1.04-1.53) and being more upset from the weight-teasing insults (P = 0.006, OR = 1.19, 95% CI = 1.05-1.35) than controls. Cases were also more than 1.5 times more likely to be made fun of (P = 0.03, OR = 1.63, 95% CI = 1.09-2.43) or laughed at (P = 0.01, OR = 1.77, 95% CI = 1.15-2.73) because of their weight than controls. CONCLUSIONS: The findings of the present study suggest that healthcare providers should monitor the psychological well-being of young adults with bowel conditions and incorporate opportunities for them to develop skills and strategies for coping.},

Although it remains unclear whether the prevalence of eating disorders is higher in those with DRCHCs compared with the general population, overall findings suggest that young people with DRCHCs may be at risk of endorsing disordered eating behaviors that may lead to diagnosis of an eating disorder and other health problems over the course of their treatment. Thus, health care providers should be aware that young people with DRCHCs may be at risk of eating disorders and carefully monitor psychological changes and the use of unhealthy weight control methods. It is also important to develop and evaluate theory-based interventions and disease-specific eating disorder risk screening tools that are effective in halting the progression of eating disorders and negative health outcomes in young people with chronic health conditions.},

It is characterized by polygenic predisposition, high prevalence (1%), widely heterogeneous expression and frequent association with other autoimmune diseases, selective deficit of IgA and Down, Turner and Williams syndrome. The basis of the disease and the key finding in its diagnostics is symptomatic or asymptomatic inflammation of the small intestinal mucosa which resolves by gluten-free diet. Therefore, the basis of the treatment involves elimination diet, so that the disorder, if timely recognized and adequately treated, also characterizes excellent prognosis.},

The current communication presents a review of published studies in recent years on the topic and looks at possible future trends in the improved nutritional and health qualities which have been applied in the bakery industry, directing it further to the formulation design and production of functional breads. The results show that many beneficial ingredients such as dietary fibers, phenolic antioxidants, marine ingredients, and n-3 fatty acids can be used in the bread industry to increase its functionality and result in healthy products, low in calories, cholesterol and celiac disease. Moreover, the use of psyllium seed, amaranth seed, chestnut flour and prebiotics in gluten-free bread (GFB) baking may be the promising frontier to improve overall appearance, quality, sensory properties, and shelf-life of GFB.},

   abstract = {BACKGROUND: Celiac disease (CD) an immune-mediated disorder associates with accumulation of dendritic cell (DC) in duodenal mucosa. Autophagy has recently been implicated in autoantigen formation. However, its role in CD is still unknown. AIM: To examine role of autophagic protein LC3 expressed by activated DC in CD. MATERIALS AND METHODS: Thirty CD patients were analyzed at initial presentation and after 6 months of gluten-free diet (GFD). Duodenal biopsies were studied for histological changes and CD11c, CD86, and MAP1LC3A expressions by double immunohistochemistry (IHC). Masson's trichrome (MT) staining was used to assess basement membrane (BM) thickness and Oil Red O (ORO) staining for mucosal lipid deposit. Polymerase chain reaction (PCR) was performed for HLA-DQ system. Statistical analysis was done using paired and unpaired t test, chi-square test, Fisher's exact test, and McNemar-Bowker test. A P-value <0.05 was considered statistically significant. RESULTS: HLA-DQ2 and HLA-DQ8 alleles were present in all studied patients. Increased BM thickness was observed in 63% and 73% had ORO-positive lipid in surface lining epithelium. Pre-treatment biopsies showed increased DCs expressing LC3, which were significantly less in follow-up biopsies. The follow-up biopsies had shown significant reduction in BM thickness and ORO. CONCLUSION: Histological improvement in duodenal biopsies was associated with reduction in activated DCs expressing autophagic protein, which probably play important role in pathogenesis of an autoimmune disorder like CD.},

   abstract = {OBJECTIVE: To assess patient and parent satisfaction with a primarily nurse- and dietitian-led celiac disease clinic in a tertiary pediatric centre. METHODS: An online survey was sent to families and patients attending the Stollery Children's Hospital's Multidisciplinary Pediatric Celiac Clinic (Edmonton, Alberta) since 2007. The survey focused on clinic attendance, satisfaction with clinic structure, processes, and education and preference for alternatives to the current process. Respondents were asked to rank satisfaction or preference on a five-point Likert scale, with 1 being lowest and 5 being highest. RESULTS: Most satisfaction related to follow-up with serology (4.6) and with a dietitian (4.3). The most preferred changes included either meeting the entire multidisciplinary team after the biopsy (4.7), or meeting with only the dietitian and nurse after the biopsy (4.4). The preferred education resources were the Internet (4.3) and the dietitian (4.2). The mean overall satisfaction score of the Multidisciplinary Pediatric Celiac Clinic was 4.0. CONCLUSIONS: Results of the present survey suggested that patients and families value a multidisciplinary follow-up clinic for children with celiac disease. In particular, feedback based on repeat blood work and regular contact with a dietitian were highly valued. The present survey, outlining the most valued aspects of the clinic, may be useful for service delivery in other regions. In addition, it provides information on how to better support pediatric patients with celiac disease.},

While there is a large pool of patients with celiac disease in India, until now, only a fraction of them have been diagnosed. With increasing awareness about celiac disease amongst health care providers and the general population, a massive increase in the number of patients with celiac disease is expected now and in the subsequent decade in India. While the number of patients with celiac disease is increasing, the country's preparedness towards the emerging epidemic of this disease is minimal. There are a number of issues, which requires urgent attention. Some of the key issues include increased awareness amongst health care professionals and the general public about the disease and its management, team-based management of patients with celiac disease, proper counseling and supervision of patients, training of dietitians in the management of patients with celiac disease, industrial production of reliable and affordable gluten-free food, and food labeling for gluten contents.},

   abstract = {Hydrogen breath tests are widely used to explore pathophysiology of functional gastrointestinal (GI) disorders. Small intestinal bacterial overgrowth (SIBO) and carbohydrate malabsorption are disorders detected by these tests that have been proposed to be of great importance for symptoms of GI diseases. Glucose hydrogen breath test is more acceptable for diagnosis of SIBO whereas lactose and fructose hydrogen breath tests are used for detection of lactose and fructose maldigestion respectively. Lactulose hydrogen breath test is also used widely to measure the orocecal transit time for GI motility. These methods are noninvasive and inexpensive. Many patients with functional gut disorders are unaware of the relationship between diet and GI symptoms they present. In particular, patients with chronic symptoms may regard their condition as normal and may not be aware that their symptoms can be effectively managed following a proper diagnosis. Patients with symptoms of abdominal pain, bloating, flatulence and altered bowel movements (diarrhea and constipation), or with a medical diagnosis of irritable bowel syndrome or celiac disease, may have undiagnosed carbohydrate malabsorption or SIBO. Hydrogen breath tests are specific and sensitive diagnostic tests that can be used to either confirm or eliminate the possibility of carbohydrate malabsorption or SIBO in such patients. Breath tests, though valuable tools, are underutilized in evaluating dyspepsia and functional bloating and diarrhea as well as suspected malabsorption. However, because of their simplicity, reproducibility and safety of procedure they are now being substituted to more uncomfortable and expensive techniques that were traditionally used in gastroenterology.},

It is believed that consumption of oats possesses various health benefits such as hypocholesterolaemic and anticancerous properties. Oats have also recently been considered suitable in the diet of celiac patients. Owing to their high nutritional value, oat-based food products like breads, biscuits, cookies, probiotic drinks, breakfast cereals, flakes and infant food are gaining increasing consideration. Research and development on oat and its products may be helpful in combating various diseases known to mankind. This paper provides an overview of the nutritional and health benefits provided by oats as whole grains and its value added products. It is designed to provide an insight on the processing of oats and its effect on their functional properties.

   abstract = {PURPOSE: Celiac disease is an autoimmune-mediated enteropathy characterized by adaptive and innate immune responses to dietary gluten in wheat, rye and barley in genetically susceptible individuals. Gluten-derived gliadin peptides are deamidated by transglutaminase 2 (TG2), leading to an immune response in the small-intestinal mucosa. TG2 inhibitors have therefore been suggested as putative drugs for celiac disease. In this proof-of-concept study we investigated whether two TG2 inhibitors, cell-impermeable R281 and cell-permeable R283, can prevent the toxic effects of gliadin in vitro and ex vivo. METHODS: Intestinal epithelial Caco-2 cells were treated with peptic-tryptic-digested gliadin (PT-gliadin) with or without TG2 inhibitors and thereafter direct toxic effects (transepithelial resistance, cytoskeletal rearrangement, junction protein expression and phoshorylation of extracellular-signal-regulated kinase 1/2) were determined. In an organ culture of celiac-patient-derived small-intestinal biopsies we measured secretion of TG2-autoantibodies into the culture medium and the densities of CD25- and interleukin (IL) 15-positive cells, forkhead box P3 (FOXP3)-positive regulatory T cells (Tregs) and Ki-67-positive proliferating crypt cells. RESULTS: Both TG2 inhibitors evinced protective effects against gliadin-induced detrimental effects in Caco-2 cells but the cell-impermeable R281 seemed slightly more potent. In addition, TG2 inhibitor R281 modified the gluten-induced increase in CD25- and IL15-positive cells, Tregs and crypt cell proliferation, but had no effect on antibody secretion in celiac-patient-derived biopsies. CONCLUSIONS: Our results suggest that TG2 inhibitors are able to reduce certain gliadin-induced effects related to responses in vitro and ex vivo.},

   abstract = {Peripheral nervous system disease is a common and often debilitating feature of many systemic rheumatologic disorders. Such involvement takes many forms, reflecting the variety of underlying pathophysiology, though most patients present with painful multifocal neuropathy (usually vasculitic) or a distal sensory more than motor peripheral neuropathy (sometimes vasculitic and nearly always axonal). The presence of peripheral nervous system involvement is often an early signal of the generalization of inflammatory disease in blood vessels or extravascular tissues, though peripheral neuropathy is not itself an independent predictor of mortality. Nonetheless, progressive multifocal neuropathy, motor neuropathy, small fiber neuropathy, and sensory neuronopathy should be treated early and aggressively with immunosuppression (or the gluten-free diet in appropriate situations) to limit morbidity. Given the rapidly evolving therapeutic landscape, partnership with a rheumatologist is essential. Treatment is usually sustained for 1 to 2 years, and remission is possible in many cases within 6 to 12 months, with variable rates of relapse and treatment resistance. Patients should be meticulously monitored for relapse with serial laboratory testing, electrodiagnostic studies, and clinical examination. Functional rating scores, such as the neuropathy impairment scale and the total neuropathy score are useful for longitudinal assessment.},

MATERIAL AND METHODS: The study included a cohort of 25 individuals aged 20-54. Nutrient intakes were assessed based on a 24-hour diet recall interview and an original questionnaire prepared by the authors specifically for this study. Anthropometric measurements were recorded in order to assess the nutritional status of the patients. RESULTS AND DISCUSSION: A low energy intake and an excessive share of fat were observed in daily food rations of coeliac disease patients. Uptake of most minerals with the diet was too low, while that of vitamins too high. Most participants declared the administration of supplements, which greatly contributed to the coverage of requirements for these nutrients. CONCLUSIONS: It was observed that the administered supplementation was frequently unjustified, which led to the allowances being considerably exceeded for many vitamins and minerals.},

   abstract = {OBJECTIVES: An association between adult celiac disease (CD) and intussusceptions (ISs) has been described. Although more common among children, intussusception has not been linked with childhood CD aside from isolated case reports. Our aim was to investigate the frequency of IS among children with CD. METHODS: A patient database containing children with biopsy-proven CD was reviewed, in addition to radiology records contained in a hospital-maintained clinical data repository. RESULTS: Of 254 children with biopsy-proven CD and complete records available for review, abdominal imaging was performed in 21%, mainly because of abdominal pain. Among children with CD, 1.2% experienced an IS <9 months before their diagnosis with CD. Among children seen at our institution in the same time period, 0.07% experienced an IS. The majority of those children with CD who were found to have IS had no evidence of nutritional deficit at the time of IS. IS was not identified in any children with CD who had been treated with a gluten-free diet. CONCLUSIONS: IS was far more common among children in our cohort with untreated CD than in the general pediatric population simultaneously seen at our center. The diagnosis of CD should be considered in children with IS, even in the absence of signs of nutritional compromise.},

   abstract = {Coeliac disease (CD) patients may exhibit a pro-inflammatory profile and fatty acids (FA) can influence inflammation through a variety of cellular pathways in them. The aims of the present study were to (1) evaluate the FA composition of erythrocytes obtained from newly diagnosed CD patients by lipidomic analysis and compare it with that in healthy subjects and (2) determine the effects of 1-year gluten-free diet (GFD) intervention. A total of twenty CD patients (five men and fifteen women; mean age 34.0 (sem 1.7) years) were evaluated at diagnosis and after 1 year of GFD intervention. A total of twenty healthy subjects (seven men and thirteen women; mean age 40.2 (sem 2.5) years) served as controls. CD patients on an unrestricted diet exhibited a significant 2.08-fold higher concentration of arachidic acid when compared with healthy subjects, suggesting that it can be considered as a putative marker of CD. Besides, the arachidonic acid (AA):dihomo-gamma-linolenic acid ratio was 2.01-fold significantly lower in CD patients than in healthy subjects (P< 0.01), underlying an inefficient synthesis of PUFA from their precursors in terms of desaturase activity. In addition, mainly due to lower concentrations of docosahexaenoic acid, the inflammation marker AA:docosahexaenoic acid ratio was 1.40-fold significantly higher in CD patients than in healthy subjects. After 1 year of GFD intervention, FA concentrations in CD patients were still different from those observed in healthy subjects. The lipidomic analysis of erythrocyte membranes confirmed the presence of an altered FA composition in CD patients and the GFD's ability to modify FA profile, even if 1-year GFD intervention seems to be not sufficient to restore FA concentrations to normality. This procedure, being easier and non-invasive compared with the evaluation of the FA pattern of the intestinal mucosa, could offer more potentiality for also evaluating therapeutic interventions in CD patients by using FA supplementation.},

   abstract = {OBJECTIVE: To provide clinicians with an update on the diagnosis of celiac disease (CD) and to make recommendations on the indications to screen for CD in patients presenting with low bone mineral density (BMD) or fragility fractures. QUALITY OF EVIDENCE: A multidisciplinary task force developed clinically relevant questions related to the diagnosis of CD as the basis for a literature search of the MEDLINE, EMBASE, and CENTRAL databases (January 2000 to January 2009) using the key words celiac disease, osteoporosis, osteopenia, low bone mass, and fracture. The existing literature consists of level I and II studies. MAIN MESSAGE: The estimated prevalence of asymptomatic CD is 2% to 3% in individuals with low BMD. Routine screening for CD is not justified in patients with low BMD. However, targeted screening for CD is recommended for patients who have T-scores of -1.0 or less at the spine or hip, or a history of fragility fractures in association with any CD-related symptoms or conditions; family history of CD; or low urinary calcium levels, vitamin D insufficiency, and raised parathyroid hormone levels despite adequate intake of calcium and vitamin D. Celiac disease testing should be performed while the subject is consuming a gluten-containing diet; initial screening should be performed with human recombinant immunoglobulin (Ig) A tissue transglutaminase or other IgA tissue transglutaminase assays, in association with IgA endomysial antibody immunofluorescence. Duodenal biopsy is necessary to confirm the diagnosis of CD. Human leukocyte antigen typing might assist in confirming or ruling out the diagnosis of CD in cases where serology and histology are discordant. Definitive diagnosis is based on clinical, serologic, and histologic features, combined with a positive response to a gluten-free diet. CONCLUSION: Current evidence does not support routine screening for CD in all patients with low BMD. A targeted case-finding approach is appropriate for patients who are at higher risk of CD.},

   abstract = {Celiac disease, with a prevalence around 1% of the general population, is the most common genetically-induced food intolerance in the world. Triggered by the ingestion of gluten in genetically predisposed individuals, this enteropathy may appear at any age, and is characterized by a wide variety of clinical signs and symptoms. Among them, gastrointestinal presentations include chronic diarrhea, abdominal pain, weight loss or failure to thrive in children; but extra-intestinal manifestations are also common, and actually appear to be on the rise. They include a large variety of ailments, such as dermatitis Herpetiformis, anemia, short stature, osteoporosis, arthritis, neurologic problems, unexplained elevation of transaminases, and even female infertility. For the clinician interested in oral diseases, celiac disease can lead to delayed tooth eruption, dental enamel hypoplasia, recurrent oral aphthae. Diagnosing celiac disease requires therefore a high degree of suspicion followed by a very sensitive screening test: serum levels of the autoantibody anti-tissue transglutaminase. A positive subject will then be confirmed by an intestinal biopsy, and will then be put on a strict gluten-free diet, that in most cases will bring a marked improvement of symptoms. Newer forms of treatment which in the future will probably be available to the non-responsive patients are currently being actively pursued.},

To assess the effectiveness of a Gluten-Free Diet (GFD) in seven adult female screening-detected CD subjects, categorized as severe IBS and FMS patients. METHODS: All subjects showed villous atrophy in duodenal biopsies, were HLA-DQ2/DQ8-positive, and fulfilled the Rome III and ACR 1990 criteria respectively for IBS and FMS classification. GFD effectiveness was assessed at baseline and after 1 year, examining the score changes in the Tender Points (TPs) test, Fibromyalgia Impact Questionnaire (FIQ), Health Assessment Questionnaire (HAQ), Short Form Health Survey (SF-36), Visual Analogue Scales (VAS) for gastrointestinal complaints, pain and tiredness, drug prescriptions and tissue-Trans-Glutaminase (tTG) serum levels. RESULTS: At baseline, all patients had poor Quality of Life and VAS scores, a high number of TPs and drug prescriptions, and increased tTG levels. After 1 year of GFD, all outcome measures significantly improved, with a decrease of 51-60% in TPs, FIQ, HAQ, and VAS scales, and in the number of prescribed drugs, accompanied by an increase of 48-60% in SF-36 Physical and Mental Component Summary scores, and a decrease of tTG to normal values. CONCLUSION: Results of this pilot study show that the adherence to a GFD by CD-related IBS/FMS patients can simultaneously improve CD and IBS/FMS symptoms, and indicate the merit of further research on a larger cohort.},

   abstract = {INTRODUCTION: Irritable bowel syndrome (IBS) and fibromyalgia syndrome (FMS) are two common central sensitization disorders frequently associated in the same patient, and some of these patients with IBS plus FMS (IBS/FMS) could actually be undiagnosed of coeliac disease (CD). The present study was an active case finding for CD in two IBS cohorts, one constituted by IBS/FMS subjects and the other by people with isolated IBS. METHODS: A total of 104 patients (89.4% females) fulfilling the 1990 ACR criteria for FMS and the Rome III criteria for IBS classification and 125 unrelated age- and sex-matched IBS patients without FMS underwent the following studies: haematological, coagulation and biochemistry tests, serological and genetic markers for CD (i.e., tissue transglutaminase 2 (tTG-2) and major histocompatibility complex HLA-DQ2/HLA-DQ8), multiple gastric and duodenal biopsies, FMS tender points (TPs), Fibromyalgia Impact Questionnaire (FIQ), Health Assessment Questionnaire (HAQ), 36-Item Short Form Health Survey (SF-36) and Visual Analogue Scales (VASs) for tiredness and gastrointestinal complaints. RESULTS: As a whole, IBS/FMS patients scored much worse in quality of life and VAS scores than those with isolated IBS (P < 0.001). Seven subjects (6.7%) from the IBS/FMS group displayed HLA-DQ2/HLA-DQ8 positivity, high tTG-2 serum levels and duodenal villous atrophy, concordant with CD. Interestingly enough, these seven patients were started on a gluten-free diet (GFD), showing a remarkable improvement in their digestive and systemic symptoms on follow-up. CONCLUSIONS: The findings of this screening indicate that a non-negligible percentage of IBS/FMS patients are CD patients, whose symptoms can improve and in whom long-term CD-related complications might possibly be prevented with a strict lifelong GFD.},

   abstract = {Iron deficiency anemia is the most common type of anemia and can cause asthenia, cognitive and functional impairment, and decompensation of underlying diseases. Iron deficiency anemia is not a disease but is the result of a potentially serious medical problem. Consequently, patients should always undergo investigation of the underlying cause. In men and postmenopausal women, the condition is caused by gastrointestinal loss and malabsorption of iron. In this group, recommended procedures are gastroscopy, colonoscopy and serological testing for celiac disease. If the results of these tests are negative, repeat examinations and iron therapy should be considered. In treatment-refractory or recurrent anemia, the small intestine should be investigated. In this case, the procedure of choice is capsule endoscopy. Iron deficiency anemia should always be treated until iron deposits have returned to normal levels. A wide variety of preparations are available, in both oral and parental formulations.},

   abstract = {The aim of this research was to explore how women with celiac disease experience everyday life. It is important that healthcare professionals understand what it is like to live with a chronic illness, and also the factors that affect the lives of women who have celiac disease. The study has a qualitative approach and the data were collected using interviews with 16 women. A conventional content analysis was used for the subjective interpretation of the qualitative interviews. Three main themes emerged in the analysis: illness trajectory and treatment, socializing with others, and feelings of loneliness and worry. The findings indicate that living with celiac disease affects the person's entire life from the past, in the present, and into the future, especially when daily routines must be altered. The women expressed a sense of loneliness and invisibility, especially when socializing with others. The diet could be a friend, enemy, obstacle, or opportunity in terms of enjoying a good life. Supporting women diagnosed with celiac disease appears to be a major task for healthcare professionals. Such professionals need to pay attention to women's symptoms, worries, and their feeling of being invisible.},

   abstract = {CONTEXT: Clinical presentation of celiac disease is extremely variable and the diagnosis relies on serologic tests, mucosal intestinal biopsy and clinic and serologic response to a gluten-free diet. OBJECTIVES: To correlate the endoscopic and histological aspects of adult patients with suspicion of celiac disease and to evaluate the interobserver histological agreement. METHODS: Endoscopic aspects of 80 adult patients were evaluated and correlated with the histological features according the Marsh-Oberhuber classification system. The interobserver histological agreement was based on kappa values. RESULTS: The symptoms of the patients varied largely, with prominence for chronic diarrhea, present in 48 (60%) patients. The endoscopic aspects related with the duodenal villous atrophy had been observed in 32 (40%) patients. There were confirmed 46 cases of celiac disease, with prevalence of 57.5%. The sensitivity, specificity, positive predictive value and negative predictive value of the endoscopic markers for celiac disease diagnosis were of 60.9%, 88.2%, 87.5% and 62.5%. There was moderate interobserver histological agreement (kappa = 0.46). CONCLUSIONS: The endoscopic markers of villous atrophy, although not diagnostic, had assisted in the suspicion and indication of the duodenal biopsies for diagnosis proposal. Histology is sometimes contradictory and new biopsies or opinion of another professional can provide greater diagnostic agreement.},

   abstract = {BACKGROUND: Coeliac disease can be controlled only through adherence to a gluten-free diet. This diet is highly restrictive and can be challenging to maintain. It has been linked with elevated levels of psychological distress, including depression, anxiety and social phobia. METHODS: Narratives on living with coeliac disease were written by 130 adult members of Coeliac UK (mean age 52.7 years; mean time since diagnosis 10.2 years; 67% sample female; 28% male). Qualitative analysis using grounded theory methods identified five key categories: living with widespread ignorance; social invisibility; creating a coeliac community; a changed identity; grief - and accepting the trade-off. RESULTS: A psychosocial model of living with coeliac disease was constructed from the findings, the central category of which was the changed identity of those diagnosed with the condition. Grief was experienced in relation to a loss of the former diet, changed personal and social identities, loss of social confidence and loss of social activities. Grief was generally mitigated over time as adjustments were made to changes in identity and lifestyle. Creating (or becoming part of) a coeliac community was a strategy enabling those with coeliac disease to re-establish their identities and increase social recognition and acceptance of the condition. CONCLUSIONS: Gluten-free living entails a substantial restriction of food choice. The losses and changes entailed impact on the personal and social identities of those living with coeliac disease, and on the behaviour of others towards them. Psychosocial interventions focussed on facilitating coping and adjustment may benefit those experiencing difficulties.},

   abstract = {CONTEXT: Celiac disease (CD) is defined as a permanent intolerance to ingested gluten. The intolerance to gluten results in immune-mediated damage of small intestine mucosa manifested by villous atrophy and crypt hyperplasia. These abnormalities resolve with initiationa gluten-free diet. EVIDENCE ACQUISITION: PubMed, Ovid, and Google were searched for full text articles published between 1963 and 2012. The associated keywords were used, and papers described particularly the impact of celiac disease on severity of liver disorder were identified. RESULTS: Recently evidence has emerged revealingthat celiac disease not only is associated with small intestine abnormalities and malabsorption, but is also a multisystem disorder affecting other systems outside gastrointestinal tract, including musculo-skeletal, cardiovascular and nervous systems. Some correlations have been assumed between celiac and liver diseases. In particular, celiac disease is associated with changes in liver biochemistry and linked to alter the prognosis of other disorders. This review will concentrate on the effect of celiac disease and gluten-free diets on the severity of liver disorders. CONCLUSIONS: Although GFD effect on the progression of CD associated liver diseases is not well defined, it seems that GFD improves liver function tests in patients with a hypertransaminasemia.},

   abstract = {Screening studies using high-sensitivity and specificity markers indicate a prevalence of celiac disease of up to 1% in European and North-American populations. Celiac disease is a frequent condition that has become an important public health issue. Yet the majority of cases remain undiagnosed due to the polymorphism of its clinical manifestations. The new insight in the pathogenesis of celiac disease has lead to the development of new diagnostic tools. Early screening of symptomatic patients and pre-identified at-risk groups significantly improves the quality of life while reducing morbidity and mortality. However, prophylactic benefits of early diagnosis by assessing the general population have not been shown in any study. French and Northern American scientific societies have introduced serological testing in their newly revised strategies to diagnose celiac disease. Older markers judged insufficiently accurate like anti-gliadin and anti-reticulin antibodies have recently been withdrawn from the list of reimbursed medical expenses in France. Anti-endomysium and tissue transglutaminase IgA antibodies have proven to be at this day the most sensitive and specific markers for the diagnosis and follow-up of patients on gluten-free diet, at the exception of IgA-deficient patients. Assays testing for IgG antibodies are recommended upon IgA-deficiency. Although very accurate, a better standardisation of current assays may enable serological testing to replace in a near future histological confirmation brought by small bowel biopsies which remains today the gold standard test to diagnose celiac disease. Indeed, serological testing represents and attractive alternative as it is less invasive, less expansive, laboursaving and more objective in interpretation.},

   abstract = {Increased immunoglobulin G (IgG) response to dietary antigens can be associated with gastrointestinal dysfunction and autoimmunity. The underlying processes contributing to these adverse reactions remain largely unknown, and it is likely that genetic factors play a role. Here, we estimate heritability and attempt to localize genetic factors influencing IgG antibody levels against food-derived antigens using an integrative genomics approach. IgG antibody levels were determined by ELISA in >1,300 Mexican Americans for the following food antigens: wheat gliadin; bovine casein; and two forms of bovine serum albumin (BSA-a and BSA-b). Pedigree-based variance components methods were used to estimate additive genetic heritability (h(2) ), perform genome-wide association analyses, and identify transcriptional signatures (based on 19,858 transcripts from peripheral blood lymphocytes). Heritability estimates were significant for all traits (0.15-0.53), and shared environment (based on shared residency among study participants) was significant for casein (0.09) and BSA-a (0.33). Genome-wide significant evidence of association was obtained only for antibody to gliadin (P = 8.57 x 10(-8) ), mapping to the human leukocyte antigen II region, with HLA-DRA and BTNL2 as the best candidate genes. Lack of association of known celiac disease risk alleles HLA-DQ2.5 and -DQ8 with antigliadin antibodies in the studied population suggests a separate genetic etiology. Significant transcriptional signatures were found for all IgG levels except BSA-b. These results demonstrate that individual genetic differences contribute to food antigen antibody measures in this population. Further investigations may elucidate the underlying immunological processes involved.},

   abstract = {This guideline presents recommendations for the diagnosis and management of patients with celiac disease. Celiac disease is an immune-based reaction to dietary gluten (storage protein for wheat, barley, and rye) that primarily affects the small intestine in those with a genetic predisposition and resolves with exclusion of gluten from the diet. There has been a substantial increase in the prevalence of celiac disease over the last 50 years and an increase in the rate of diagnosis in the last 10 years. Celiac disease can present with many symptoms, including typical gastrointestinal symptoms (e.g., diarrhea, steatorrhea, weight loss, bloating, flatulence, abdominal pain) and also non-gastrointestinal abnormalities (e.g., abnormal liver function tests, iron deficiency anemia, bone disease, skin disorders, and many other protean manifestations). Indeed, many individuals with celiac disease may have no symptoms at all. Celiac disease is usually detected by serologic testing of celiac-specific antibodies. The diagnosis is confirmed by duodenal mucosal biopsies. Both serology and biopsy should be performed on a gluten-containing diet. The treatment for celiac disease is primarily a gluten-free diet (GFD), which requires significant patient education, motivation, and follow-up. Non-responsive celiac disease occurs frequently, particularly in those diagnosed in adulthood. Persistent or recurring symptoms should lead to a review of the patient's original diagnosis to exclude alternative diagnoses, a review of the GFD to ensure there is no obvious gluten contamination, and serologic testing to confirm adherence with the GFD. In addition, evaluation for disorders associated with celiac disease that could cause persistent symptoms, such as microscopic colitis, pancreatic exocrine dysfunction, and complications of celiac disease, such as enteropathy-associated lymphoma or refractory celiac disease, should be entertained. Newer therapeutic modalities are being studied in clinical trials, but are not yet approved for use in practice. Given the incomplete response of many patients to a GFD-free diet as well as the difficulty of adherence to the GFD over the long term, development of new effective therapies for symptom control and reversal of inflammation and organ damage are needed. The prevalence of celiac disease is increasing worldwide and many patients with celiac disease remain undiagnosed, highlighting the need for improved strategies in the future for the optimal detection of patients.},

   abstract = {OBJECTIVE. The role of adipokines such as resistin, leptin, and adiponectin could be pivotal in the molecular crosstalk between the inflamed intestine and the surrounding mesenteric adipose tissue. Our aims were to a) evaluate their circulating concentrations in patients with active celiac disease (ACD) and compare them to those in patients with diarrhea-predominant irritable bowel syndrome (IBS-d) and healthy subjects; b) establish the impact of genetic variability in resistin; and c) evaluate whether a 1-year gluten-free diet (GFD) modifies circulating concentrations of resistin, leptin, and adiponectin in celiac patients. MATERIAL AND METHODS. The study included 34 ACD patients, 29 IBS-d patients, and 27 healthy controls. Circulating concentrations of resistin, leptin, adiponectin, IL-6, and IL-8 were evaluated at the time of enrollment. Resistin +299 G/A polymorphism was also analysed. In CD patients, biochemical measurements were repeated after a 1-year GFD. RESULTS. Along with higher IL-6 and IL-8 plasma levels, higher resistin and adiponectin concentrations were found in ACD and IBS-d patients compared with controls (p: 0.0351 and p: 0.0020, respectively). Resistin values proved to be predictable from a linear combination of IL-8 and +299 polymorphism. GFD affected resistin (p: 0.0009), but not leptin and adiponectin concentrations. CONCLUSIONS. Our data suggest that these adipokines are involved in modulating inflammatory processes in both CD and IBS-d patients. Alterations in the adipokine profile as well as the higher prevalence of the resistin +299 G/A SNP A allele compared to controls support the hypothesis that, at least in well-defined cases of IBS, a genetic component may also be supposed.},

   abstract = {AIM: To elaborate recommendations for rehabilitation of patients with gluten-sensitivity celiac disease (GCD) on the basis of a long-term follow-up. SUBJECTS AND METHODS: Eighty-seven patients with GCD were followed up for as long as 31 years. Of those, 72.4% of the patients kept strictly to their gluten-free diet (GFD) throughout the follow-up; 9.2% did not follow the diet periodically; and 18.4% did not at all. The sera from 71 patients were tested for IgA and IgG anti-gliadin antibodies (AGAb) and anti-tissue transglutaminase antibodies (ATTGAb) at as long as 19-year follow-up. AGAb and ATTGAb were estimated by enzyme immunoassay (IMMCO Diagnostics). All the patients underwent endoscopic and histological examinations of the small bowel mucosa (SBM). RESULTS: To support the validity of keeping to the GFD, the time course of clinical, laboratory, and morphological changes were analyzed in 63 and 24 GFD followers and non-followers, respectively. The GFD non-followers were more frequently found to have diarrheic syndrome, symptoms of malabsorption syndrome, lower serum concentrations of hemoglobin, total protein, iron, and calcium; no SBM structural recovery was seen in any patient. When the GFD was long adhered to, there was also a reduction in detection rates and AGAb and ATTGAb concentrations. CONCLUSION: The adherence to the GFD was ascertained to contribute to fuller rehabilitation in the patients. However, even the patients who had strictly kept to their GFD showed periods of an exacerbation and incomplete SBM structural recovery. Therefore, the rehabilitation system for patients with GCD must involve diagnostic, therapeutic, and organizational measures that promote not only rapid clinical recovery, but also better quality of life in these patients.},

SUBJECTS AND METHODS: One hundred and twenty-four patients treated at the Department of Intestinal Pathology, Central Research Institute of Gastroenterology, were examined. Enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay (ELISA) was employed to determine Abs to tissue transglutaminase (tTG) and DGP of the IgA and IgG classes in the sera of all the patients. The diagnosis of celiac disease was verified by the histological examination of small bowel mucosa biopsy specimens. RESULTS: The examinees were divided into 3 groups: 1) 27 patients first diagnosed with celiac disease; 2) 40 patients keeping a gluten-free diet (GFD); 3) 57 patients with other gastrointestinal diseases (a comparison group). In the patients first diagnosed with celiac disease, the detection rate of elevated titers of anti-tTG and anti-DGP Abs in the IgA class was equal and constituted 92.5%; that in the IgG class was 96.2 and 55.5%, respectively. The comparison group showed an increase in the DGP levels in the IgA and IgG classes in 4 (7%) patients and a rise in tTG concentrations in the IgA and IgG classes was seen in only 2 (3.5%) patients. CONCLUSION: In the patents first diagnosed with celiac disease, the detection rate of elevated levels of anti-DGP Abs in the IgA and IgG classes is 92.5 and 96.2%, respectively, and significantly indifferent from that of IgA and IgG anti-tTG Abs. The patients keeping GFD displayed a reduction in anti-DGP Abs. The high detection rate of IgA anti-DGP Abs in the patients first diagnosed with celiac disease allows this method to be recommended for immunological diagnosis of this disease in adults.},

   abstract = {BACKGROUND & AIMS: Patients with celiac disease (CD) often report symptoms compatible with irritable bowel syndrome (IBS). However, the prevalence of these symptoms in patients with CD and their relation to adherence to a gluten-free diet (GFD) have not been assessed systematically. METHODS: We searched MEDLINE, EMBASE, and EMBASE Classic (through July 2012) to identify cross-sectional surveys or case-control studies reporting prevalence of IBS-type symptoms in adult patients (>/= 16 years old) with established CD. The number of individuals with symptoms meeting criteria for IBS was extracted for each study, according to case or control status and adherence to a GFD. Pooled prevalence and odds ratios (ORs), with 95% confidence intervals (CIs), were calculated. We analyzed data from 7 studies with 3383 participants. RESULTS: The pooled prevalence of IBS-type symptoms in all patients with CD was 38.0% (95% CI, 27.0%-50.0%). The pooled OR for IBS-type symptoms was higher in patients with CD than in controls (5.60; 95% CI, 3.23-9.70). In patients who were nonadherent with a GFD, the pooled OR for IBS-type symptoms, compared with those who were strictly adherent, was 2.69 (95% CI, 0.75-9.56). There was also a trend toward a higher OR for IBS-type symptoms among patients who did not adhere to the GFD, compared with controls (12.42; 95% CI, 6.84-11.75), compared with that observed for adherent CD patients vs controls (4.28; 95% CI, 1.56-11.75). CONCLUSIONS: IBS-type symptoms occur frequently in patients with CD and are more common than among controls. Adherence to a GFD might be associated with a reduction in symptoms.},

   abstract = {This study examined the potential role of psychological symptoms in limiting the translation of positive intention into strict gluten free diet (GFD) adherence in coeliac disease (CD) within a theory of planned behaviour (TPB) framework. It was hypothesised that participants with more symptomatic psychological profiles would exhibit poorer adherence, primarily in the context of positive intentions. Coeliac disease participants (N=390) completed online measures of gluten free diet adherence, psychological symptoms, coping behaviour, and TPB items. Intention and behaviour were moderately correlated, confirming the existence of the intention-behaviour gap. Psychological symptoms accounted for additional variance over and above TPB variables in GFD adherence but not intention. Participants who failed to act on their positive intentions displayed more psychological symptoms and greater reliance on maladaptive coping strategies than those with consistent intention-behaviour relationships (p<.01). The heightened incidence of psychological symptoms in CD has a small but significant negative impact on the ability to translate positive intentions into strict adherence. Directions for future research including interventions to improve GFD adherence are discussed.},

METHODS: A Randomized controlled trial was conducted. A total of 189 adults with biopsy-confirmed celiac disease were recruited and randomized to receive the intervention (n=101) or to a waitlist control condition (n=88). Post-intervention data was available for 70 intervention and 64 waitlist participants. Three month follow-up data was obtained for 46/50 completers from the intervention group. The primary outcome measure was gluten-free diet adherence. Secondary outcomes were gluten-free diet knowledge, quality of life and psychological symptoms. RESULTS: Results were based on intention-to-treat analyses. The intervention group evidenced significantly improved gluten-free diet adherence, and gluten-free diet knowledge following the treatment period relative to the waitlist control group. The change in knowledge did not contribute to the change in adherence. These improvements were maintained at 3-month' follow-up. CONCLUSIONS: The online program was effective in improving adherence and represents a promising resource for individuals with celiac disease who are struggling to achieve or maintain adequate gluten free diet adherence.},

The purpose of this paper was to compare the relative impacts of psychological symptoms and coping to the known negative impacts of gastrointestinal symptoms and adherence to the gluten free diet (GFD) on QOL. METHODS: In study 1 (N=390), participants completed measures of QOL, psychological symptoms, coping, several indices of symptom severity, and adherence. Correlations and regression analyses were used to determine the relationships between QOL and the measured variables. Study 2 (N=189) replicated the findings using a validated measure of current gastrointestinal symptom severity and a more comprehensive measure of coping. RESULTS: Across both studies, poorer QOL was correlated with a higher incidence of psychological and gastrointestinal symptoms, greater reliance on maladaptive coping strategies, and poorer GFD adherence. The relationship between psychological symptoms (particularly depression) and QOL persisted when controlling for past (study 1) and current (study 2) gastrointestinal symptom severity. Psychological symptoms and GFD adherence were more strongly related to reduced QOL than gastrointestinal symptoms. CONCLUSION: The negative impact of psychological symptoms on QOL and adherence suggests that management in CD should include the provision of psychological coping skills, as well as purely dietetic-based strategies to minimise gastrointestinal symptoms.},

   abstract = {INTRODUCTION: The gluten-free diet has traditionally been accepted as a healthy diet, but there are articles advocating that it may have some nutritional deficiencies. The current study assesses whether there was any change in the contributions of calories, essential elements, proportion of fatty acids, vitamins, minerals and fiber in children who were diagnosed with celiac diseases, comparing the diet with gluten prior one year after diagnosis with the diet without gluten to the year of diagnosis. The level of clinical or analytical impact that nutritional deficits could have was also assessed. MATERIAL AND METHODS: A prospective,descriptive, observational study in which information was collected from a dietary survey, anthropometric and analytical data at pre-diagnosis of celiac disease and following a gluten diet and one year after celiac disease diagnosis, under gluten-free diet. RESULTS: A total of 37 patients meet the study criteria. A decrease in the intake of saturated fatty acids was found, with an increase of monounsaturated fatty acids and an increase in the intake of phosphorus in the diet without gluten. A deficient intake of vitamin D was found in both diets. Clinically, at year of gluten-free diet there was an improvement in weight and size. Analytically, there was an improvement in hemoglobin, ferritin, vitamin D, and parathyroid hormone in plasma. CONCLUSION: The gluten-free diet has minimal deficiencies, similar to those present in the diet with gluten, with an improvement in the lipid profile by increasing the proportion of monounsaturated fatty acids to the detriment of saturated fatty acids.},

   abstract = {Dermatitis herpetiformis (DH) is an extraintestinal manifestation of coeliac disease. Untreated coeliac disease patients are known to have transglutaminase 2 (TG2)-targeted IgA deposits in the small bowel mucosa. To evaluate whether similar intestinal IgA deposits are also present in DH and whether the deposits disappear with gluten-free diet, 47 untreated and 27 treated DH patients were studied. Seventy-nine percent of untreated and 41% of the treated DH patients had TG2-specific IgA deposits in the small bowel, and the presence of the deposits showed a significant association with the degree of small bowel villous atrophy (p < 0.001). Other coeliac-disease related inflammatory markers were also investigated, and the density of small bowel mucosal intraepithelial gammadelta(+) T cells was increased in 91% of untreated and 73% of treated DH patients. The results show that the majority of untreated DH patients have similar gluten-dependent TG2-specific IgA deposits the small bowel mucosa as coeliac disease patients.},

   abstract = {BACKGROUND: We studied the expression of sulphated glycosaminoglycans (GAGs) in coeliac disease (CD) mucosa, as they are critical determinants of tissue volume, which increases in active disease. We also examined mucosal expression of IL-6, which stimulates excess GAG synthesis in disorders such as Grave's ophthalmopathy. METHODS: We stained archival jejunal biopsies from 5 children with CD at diagnosis, on gluten-free diet and challenge for sulphated GAGs. We then examined duodenal biopsies from 9 children with CD compared to 9 histological normal controls, staining for sulphated GAGs, heparan sulphate proteoglycans (HSPG), short-chain HSPG (Delta-HSPG) and the proteoglycan syndecan-1 (CD138), which is expressed on epithelium and plasma cells. We confirmed findings with a second monoclonal in another 12 coeliac children. We determined mucosal IL-6 expression by immunohistochemistry and PCR in 9 further cases and controls, and used quantitative real time PCR for other Th17 pathway cytokines in an additional 10 cases and controls. RESULTS: In CD, HSPG expression was lost in the epithelial compartment but contrastingly maintained within an expanded lamina propria. Within the upper lamina propria, clusters of syndecan-1(+) plasma cells formed extensive syncytial sheets, comprising adherent plasma cells, lysed cells with punctate cytoplasmic staining and shed syndecan ectodomains. A dense infiltrate of IL-6(+) mononuclear cells was detected in active coeliac disease, also localised to the upper lamina propria, with significantly increased mRNA expression of IL-6 and IL-17A but not IL-23 p19. CONCLUSIONS: Matrix expansion, through syndecan-1(+) cell recruitment and lamina propria GAG increase, underpins villous atrophy in coeliac disease. The syndecan-1(+) cell syncytia and excess GAG production recapitulate elements of the invertebrate encapsulation reaction, itself dependent on insect transglutaminase and glutaminated early response proteins. As in other matrix expansion disorders, IL-6 is upregulated and represents a logical target for immunotherapy in patients with coeliac disease refractory to gluten-free diet.},

   abstract = {Celiac disease has become extensively studied. What could be the cause? Increasing the accuracy of diagnostic tests for celiac disease has led to more discovered cases. Serological diagnosis of celiac disease has undergone important changes in recent years. Application of serological tests has reflected the diagnostic performance of tissue transglutaminase antibody and endomysial antibody as screening tests for celiac disease but also the progress of new serological tests as the antibodies against synthetic deamidated gliadin peptides. Serological tests are largely responsible for the recognition that celiac disease is not a rare disease. The Consensus in celiac disease from 2008 conducted under the aegis of the European Society of Pediatric Gastroenterology, Hepatology and Nutrition jointly with North American Society of Pediatric Gastroenterology, Hepatology and Nutrition which agreed that "Celiac disease is an immune-mediated enteropathy that can affect any system or organ and that can present itself with a wide range of clinical manifestations of variable severity" was confirmed. But increasing prevalence of this disease has led to the need for new methods of treatment among patients with celiac disease. Studies on quality of life of patients with celiac disease have questioned the gluten-free diet. As such new therapies, like TG2 inhibitors, the copolymer P (HEMA-co-SS) and other new experimental therapies, have emerged in celiac disease. The new therapies in celiac disease are based on new investigations in gluten toxicity screening, like K562(S)-cell agglutination, A1 and G12 monoclonal antibodies and proteomics. In this paper we want to present the investigative developments in celiac disease. We also want to find whether a new treatment in celiac disease is necessary.},

   abstract = {Many recent studies overshadow the effects of gluten-free diet. Gluten-free diet positive effects were observed in celiac disease patients: increase in body mass index, higher energy intakes, reducing adiposity gain, moderates the risk of the associated complications. However, adhering to a gluten-free diet is difficult for many people. A new solution is needed for quality of life of celiac disease patients, not for celiac disease treatment. Health education on gluten-free diet at home and in society seems to be the solution. The aim of our study is to evaluate the recent research on gluten-free diet as a nutritional therapy for patients with celiac disease. To achieve this purpose we have analyzed the published studies from 2008 to the present on nutrition in celiac disease.},

The incidence of disorders related to gluten, including the EC, is increasing, even pathologies far from an etiology or treatment with GF D. AIMS: Review the scientific literature related to the ingestion of gluten and pathogenesis of different diseases. METHODS: A literature search in major scientific database. RESULTS: We obtained from the following diseases, gluten ataxia, multiple sclerosis, autism spectrum disorder, schizophrenia, attention deficit hyperactivity disorder, depressive disorders, headaches, irritable bowel syndrome, fibromyalgia, dermatitis herpetiformis and epilepsy, studies in which either a determination of gliadin was refered or a treatment, with/without gluten, was applied and evaluated. CONCLUSION: The ingestion of gluten seems to be related to disease, when there is no EC, SGNC or wheat allergy. Suspicions about the benefit of GF D as a complementary treatment is borne in semi-clinical trials and cohorts, either as a causal factor in the pathogenesis, or improvement of symptoms.},

   abstract = {Celiac disease (CD) is an immune-mediated enteropathy triggered by the ingestion of cereal gluten proteins. This disorder is associated with imbalances in the gut microbiota composition that could be involved in the pathogenesis of CD. The aim of this study was to characterize the composition and diversity of the cultivable duodenal mucosa-associated bacteria of CD patients and control children. Duodenal biopsy specimens from patients with active disease on a gluten-containing diet (n = 32), patients with nonactive disease after adherence to a gluten-free diet (n = 17), and controls (n = 8) were homogenized and plated on plate count agar, Wilkins-Chalgren agar, brain heart agar, or yeast, Casitone, and fatty acid agar. The isolates were identified by partial 16S rRNA gene sequencing. Renyi diversity profiles showed the highest diversity values for active CD patients, followed by nonactive CD patients and control individuals. Members of the phylum Proteobacteria were more abundant in patients with active CD than in the other child groups, while those of the phylum Firmicutes were less abundant. Members of the families Enterobacteriaceae and Staphylococcaceae, particularly the species Klebsiella oxytoca, Staphylococcus epidermidis, and Staphylococcus pasteuri, were more abundant in patients with active disease than in controls. In contrast, members of the family Streptococcaceae were less abundant in patients with active CD than in controls. Furthermore, isolates of the Streptococcus anginosus and Streptococcus mutans groups were more abundant in controls than in both CD patient groups, regardless of inflammatory status. The findings indicated that the disease is associated with the overgrowth of possible pathobionts that exclude symbionts or commensals that are characteristic of the healthy small intestinal microbiota.},

   abstract = {Irritable bowel syndrome (IBS) is the commonest cause of recurrent abdominal pain (RAP) in children in both more developed and developing parts of the world. It is defined by the Rome III criteria for functional gastrointestinal disorders. It is characterized by abdominal pain that is improved by defecation and whose onset is associated with a change in stool form and or frequency and is not explained by structural or biochemical abnormalities. It is estimated that 10%-15% of older children and adolescents suffer from IBS. IBS can be considered to be a brain-gut disorder possibly due to complex interaction between environmental and hereditary factors. The diagnosis of IBS is made based on the Rome III criteria together with ruling out organic causes of RAP in children such as inflammatory bowel disease and celiac disease. Once the diagnosis of IBS is made, it is important to explain to the parents (and children) that there is no serious underlying disease. This reassurance may be effective treatment in a large number of cases. Lifestyle modifications, stress management, dietary interventions and probiotics may be beneficial in some cases. Although there is limited evidence for efficacy of pharmacological therapies such as antispasmodics and antidiarrheals; these have a role in severe cases. Biopsychosocial therapies have shown encouraging results in initial trials but are beset by limited availability. Further research is necessary to understand the pathophysiology and provide specific focused therapies.},

   abstract = {Strategies to prevent or reduce the risk of allergic diseases are needed. The time of exclusive breastfeeding and introduction of solid foods is a key factor that may influence the development of allergy. For this reason, the aim of this review was to examine the association between exposure to solid foods in the infant's diet and the development of allergic diseases in children. Classical prophylactic feeding guidelines recommended a delayed introduction of solids for the prevention of atopic diseases. Is it really true that a delayed introduction of solids (after the 4th or 6th month) is protective against the development of eczema, asthma, allergic rhinitis and food or inhalant sensitisation? In recent years, many authors have found that there is no statistically significant association between delayed introduction of solids and protection for the development of allergic diseases. Furthermore, late introduction of solid foods could be associated with increased risk of allergic sensitisation to foods, inhalant allergens and celiac disease in children. Tolerance may be driven by the contact of the mucosal immune system with the allergen at the right time of life; the protective effects seem to be enhanced by the practice of the breastfeeding at the same time when weaning is started. Therefore, recent guidelines propose a "window" approach for weaning practice starting at the 17th week and introducing almost all foods within the 27th week of life to reduce the risk of chronic diseases such as allergic ones and the celiac disease. Guidelines emphasize the role of breastfeeding during the weaning practice.},

Current data suggest that patients with mild enteropathy may be present with gluten-sensitive symptoms and complications. AIM: To investigate the prevalence of GSE, including mild enteropathy, in patients with dysmotility-like dyspepsia symptoms. METHODS: We retrospectively studied 142 patients who presented dysmotility-like dyspepsia symptoms and normal upper gastrointestinal endoscopy. Endoscopic duodenal biopsies were taken and processed using hematoxylin-eosin staining and CD3 immunophenotyping. In patients with enteropathy (number of intraepithelial lymphocytes greater than 25 per 100 enterocytes) we also performed coeliac serology (anti-tissue transglutaminase IgA) and HLA-DQ2/DQ8 genotyping. A gluten-free diet was offered if one of these markers was positive. The final GSE diagnosis was established based on clinical and histopathological response to the gluten-free diet after 18 months of follow-up. RESULTS: Fifty-one patients (35.9%) had enteropathy; 4 (2.8%) Marsh type 3b, 24 (16.9%) Marsh type 3a, 3 (2.1%) Marsh type 2, and 20 (14.1%) Marsh type 1. A positive serology result was extremely low (6.7%) in mild enteropathy (Marsh type 1-3a) in contrast with Marsh type 3b patients (50%). Most patients with enteropathy had positive HLA DQ2 or -DQ8 genotyping (84.1%). Out of the 37 patients who started a gluten-free diet, 34 (91.9%) improved their symptoms, and 28 of 32 (87.5%) had a histopathological or serological response. A final GSE diagnosis was established in 28 of the 142 patients (19.7%). CONCLUSION: Gluten-sensitive enteropathy can be a frequent and unsuspected cause of dysmotility-like dyspepsia.},

   abstract = {INTRODUCTION: Lymphocytic duodenosis (LD) is a characteristic lesion in the initial phases of celiac disease (CD) but can be associated with many other entities. The aim of this study was to evaluate the prevalence of distinct causes of LD and possible differences in clinical presentation according to etiology. METHODS: A retrospective study was performed that included 194 patients diagnosed with LD (more than 25 intraepithelial lymphocytes per 100 epithelial cells). A preestablished strategy to evaluate the cause of the disease was followed that included celiac serology (antitransglutaminase antibodies), HLA-DQ2/DQ8 genotypes, diagnosis of Helicobacter pylori and small intestinal bacterial overgrowth (SIBO). Diagnosis of CD was established on the basis of clinical and histological response to a gluten-free diet in patients with positive serology or compatible findings on HLA-DQ2 (at least one of the alleles) or -DQ8 (both alleles) study. RESULTS: The most frequent cause of LD was CD (39%), followed by SBBO (22%), H.pylori (14%), CD and SIBO (12%), and other causes (13%). Most of the patients (83%) had a compatible HLA-DQ2 or -DQ8 genotype. In these patients, the most frequent diagnosis was CD (46%), while in the absence of HLA-DQ2/DQ8, the most frequent diagnoses were SIBO (44%) and H. pylori (22%). CD was the most frequent diagnosis in patients referred for dyspepsia, diarrhea and anemia, while H. pylori was the most frequent diagnosis in patients with abdominal pain. CONCLUSIONS: The most common causes of LD in our environment are CD, followed by SIBO and H. pylori infection.},

   abstract = {BACKGROUND AND AIMS: To systemically evaluate the efficacy of adjuvant vitamin E on the outcomes of nonalcoholic fatty liver disease (NAFLD) and/or nonalcoholic steatohepatitis (NASH) in children. MATERIALS AND METHODS: We searched MEDLINE, PUBMED, EMBASE, the Cochrane Central Register Controlled Trials, and the Cochrane Database of Systematic Reviews over the period between January 1980 and September 2012 for the studies that examined the role of adjuvant vitamin E given at any dose or duration, alone or in combination with other interventions, on the outcome of pediatric NAFLD. The outcomes are alanine aminotransferase (ALT) normalization and histological improvement. RESULTS: Five randomized trials were eligible to be included in our analysis, with a total of 270 participants. There was no statistically significant difference in the effect of adjuvant vitamin E on normalizing serum ALT [risk ratio (RR) =1.18, confidence interval (CI) =0.92-1.53, P = 0.77 for heterogeneity, I2 = 0%]. Sensitivity analysis showed that using higher doses of vitamin E, a longer duration of therapy or adding vitamin C did not change the effect on the measured outcome. Only two studies looked at histological changes as an outcome. We observed substantial heterogeneity between the two studies. CONCLUSIONS: Our meta-analysis did not find a significant effect of adjuvant vitamin E over placebo in normalizing serum ALT. Data on the long-term effect of adjuvant vitamin E on histological improvements in NAFLD patients are still lacking. Larger, well-designed randomized controlled trials (RCTs) in children with histological endpoints are still needed to answer this question.},

   abstract = {BACKGROUND: Cortical myoclonus with ataxia has only rarely been reported in association with Coeliac Disease (CD). Such reports also suggested that it is unresponsive to gluten-free diet. We present detailed electro-clinical characteristics of a new syndrome of progressive cortical hyperexcitability with ataxia and refractory CD. At our gluten/neurology clinic we have assessed and regularly follow up over 600 patients with neurological manifestations due to gluten sensitivity. We have identified 9 patients with this syndrome. RESULTS: All 9 patients (6 male, 3 female) experienced asymmetrical irregular myoclonus involving one or more limbs and sometimes face. This was often stimulus sensitive and became more widespread over time. Three patients had a history of Jacksonian march and five had at least one secondarily generalised seizure. Electrophysiology showed evidence of cortical myoclonus. Three had a phenotype of epilepsia partialis continua at onset. There was clinical, imaging and/or pathological evidence of cerebellar involvement in all cases. All patients adhered to a strict gluten-free diet with elimination of gluten-related antibodies in most. However, there was still evidence of enteropathy in all, suggestive of refractory celiac disease. Two died from enteropathy-associated lymphoma and one from status epilepticus. Five patients were treated with mycophenolate and one in addition with rituximab and IV immunoglobulins. Their ataxia and enteropathy improved but myoclonus remained the most disabling feature of their illness. CONCLUSIONS: This syndrome may well be the commonest neurological manifestation of refractory CD. The clinical involvement, apart from ataxia, covers the whole clinical spectrum of cortical myoclonus.},

   abstract = {PURPOSE: To systematically review evidence concerning disordered eating practices in dietary-controlled gastrointestinal conditions. Three key questions were examined: a) are disordered eating practices a feature of GI disorders?; b) what abnormal eating practices are present in those with GI disorders?; and c) what factors are associated with the presence of disordered eating in those with GI disorders? By exploring these questions, we aim to develop a conceptual model of disordered eating development in GI disease. METHODS: Five key databases, Web of Science with Conference Proceedings (1900-2014) and MEDLINE (1950-2014), PubMed, PsycINFO (1967-2014) and Google Scholar, were searched for papers relating to disordered eating practices in those with GI disorders. All papers were quality assessed before being included in the review. RESULTS: Nine papers were included in the review. The majority of papers reported that the prevalence of disordered eating behaviours is greater in populations with GI disorders than in populations of healthy controls. Disordered eating patterns in dietary-controlled GI disorders may be associated with both anxiety and GI symptoms. Evidence concerning the correlates of disordered eating was limited. CONCLUSIONS: The presence of disordered eating behaviours is greater in populations with GI disorders than in populations of healthy controls, but the direction of the relationship is not clear. Implications for further research are discussed.},

After a diagnosis of celiac disease is confirmed by small bowel biopsy, patients are advised to commence a gluten-free diet (GFD). This dietary restriction may be particularly difficult for the child with diabetes, but in Europe (and in Italy) many food stores have targeted this section of the market with better labeling of products and more availability of specific GFD products. Treatment with a GFD in symptomatic patients has been shown to improve the symptoms, signs and complications of celiac disease. However, the effects of a GFD on diabetic control are less well established. Initial reports of improved hypoglycemic control were based on children who were diagnosed with celiac disease associated with malabsorption, but there have subsequently been reports of improvement in patients with type 1 diabetes with subclinical celiac disease. There are other studies reporting no effect, improved control and an improvement of hypoglycemic episodes. Moreover, in this review we wish to focus on low glycemic index foods, often suggested in people with type 1 diabetes, since they might reduce postprandial glycemic excursion and enhance long-term glycemic control. In contrast, GFD may be rich in high glycemic index foods that can increase the risk of obesity, insulin resistance and cardiovascular disease, worsening the metabolic control of the child with diabetes. Hence, it is important to evaluate the impact of a GFD on metabolic control, growth and nutritional status in children with type 1 diabetes.},

   abstract = {New guidelines for celiac disease (CD) diagnosis from the European Society for Paediatric Gastroenterology, Hepatology, and Nutrition (ESPGHAN) propose the option to omit the duodenal biopsy in the diagnosis of CD. For this option, all four of the following criteria have to apply in children and adolescents: signs and symptoms suggestive of CD, anti-transglutaminase type 2 antibody (anti-TG2) levels more than 10 times the upper limit of normal, positive confirmation tests of anti-endomysium-IgA antibodies (EMA), and at-risk HLA-DQ2 or HLA-DQ8. Here, we report the case of a female patient, 2 years old, with chronic diarrhea that started after an acute viral gastroenteritis. The patient had anti-TG2 levels of more than 10 times the upper limit of normal, positivity for EMA, antigliadin IgA, and IgG (AGA-IgA, AGA-IgG, respectively), and the at-risk HLA-DRB1*0301, DQB1*0201/DRB1*10, DQB1*0501 genotype, thus fulfilling all criteria for the diagnosis of CD. Although the diarrhea disappeared after about 5 weeks, anti-TG2, EMA, and AGA-IgG remained positive. Therefore, a duodenal biopsy was performed and evidenced a normal mucosa (Marsh 0). After about 18 months, the antibody titer for AGA-IgG, anti-TG2, and EMA became negative. The patient was all the time on a normal, gluten-containing diet. This clinical case represents an exception to the new ESPGHAN guidelines for CD diagnosis. During 5 weeks, the new ESPGHAN criteria were all fulfilled, allowing to propose for this patient the diagnosis of CD without performing a duodenal biopsy. Therefore, a prudent approach is suggested when the pediatric gastroenterologist makes a diagnosis of CD without duodenal biopsy.},

A marked expansion of intraepithelial lymphocytes (IEL) lacking surface TCR/CD3 expression characterizes the RCD subtype II. In up to 50% of RCDII patients these so-called aberrant IEL (a-IEL) develop into lymphoma and can disseminate into other tissues. Elevated levels of Interleukin-15 (IL-15) in the intestine of CD and RCD patients likely contribute to the expansion of a-IEL. Here, we investigated if interactions with other cells might also influence a-IEL expansion. Similar to IL-15, cells from the monocyte lineage, particularly mature dendritic cells (DCs), promoted proliferation, prevented apoptosis and induced IFNgamma secretion of a-IEL derived from RCDII biopsies (RCDII cell lines), which in turn induced CXCL10. In contrast to IL-15, mature DCs did not induce proliferation of regular TCR(+)IEL lines, generated from CD biopsies and IL-15-blocking antibodies did not inhibit DC-induced proliferation of RCDII cell lines. Furthermore, proliferation was dependent on cell-cell contact, but independent of the HLA-genotype of the stimulating cells. Our results suggest that contact with DC, either in the epithelium or upon dissemination, contributes to uncontrolled expansion of a-IEL in RCDII, independent of HLA-genotype and IL-15.},

Its symptoms arise in response to gluten consumption by genetically predisposed persons (HLA-DQ2/8). The autoantigen tissue transglutaminase (TG2) plays an important role in the pathogenesis of celiac disease. METHOD: Selective review of pertinent literature, including guidelines from Germany and abroad. RESULTS: Celiac disease can present at any age with gastrointestinal or extraintestinal manifestations (e.g., malabsorption or Duhring's dermatitis herpetiformis); it can also be found in association with other (auto-)immune diseases, such as type 1 diabetes. Most cases are oligosymptomatic. The wide differential diagnosis includes food intolerances, intestinal infections, and irritable bowel syndrome, among other conditions. The definitive diagnosis requires the demonstration of celiac disease-specific autoantibody to TG2 (endomysium), which is over 90% sensitive and far over 90% specific, and the characteristic histologic lesions of the small-bowel mucosa and remission on a gluten-free diet. CONCLUSION: An understanding of celiac disease ought to inform everyday clinical practice in all medical disciplines, because this is a common condition with diverse manifestations that can be effectively diagnosed and easily treated for the prevention of both acute and long-term complications. Patients should follow a strictly gluten-free diet for life.},

In the last 10 years, the method has been extended to the pathological investigation. Stable isotope analysis to better understand a diet-related disease: celiac disease in ancient human bones was carried out. To do this, we analyzed the nitrogen and carbon isotopic composition of human (n = 37) and faunal (n = 8) bone remains from the archaeological site of Cosa at Ansedonia, on the Tyrrhenian coast near Orbetello (Tuscany), including the skeletal remains of a young woman (late 1st century-early 2nd century Common Era [CE]) with morphological and genetic features suggestive of celiac disease. We compared the young woman's isotopic data with those of other individuals recovered at the same site but from two later time periods (6th century CE; 11-12th century CE) and with literature data from other Italian archaeological sites dating to the same period. Her collagen delta(13) C and delta(15) N values differed from those of the samples at the same site, and from most but not all of the contemporary sites. Although the woman's diet appears distinct, chronic malnutrition resulting from severe malabsorption of essential nutrients due to celiac disease may have affected the isotopic composition of her bone collagen.},

   abstract = {AIM: To examine the possible ameliorative effect of breastfeeding and the uptake of human colostrum against coeliac disease in autistic rats. METHODS: Female rats were fed a standard diet and received a single intraperitoneal injection of 600 mg/kg sodium valproate on day 12.5 after conception. In study 1, neonatal rats were randomly subjected to blood tests to investigate autism. In study 2, the 1(st) group was fed by the mother after an injection of interferon-gamma (IFN-gamma) and administration of gliadin. The pups in the 2(nd) group were prevented from accessing maternal milk, injected IFN-gamma, administered gliadin, and hand-fed human colostrum. The normal littermates fed by the table mothers were injected with physiological saline and served as normal controls in this study. RESULTS: The protein concentration was higher in group 2 than in group 1 in the duodenum (161.6 +/- 9 and 135.4 +/- 7 mg/g of tissue, respectively, P < 0.01). A significant increase (P < 0.001) in body weight was detected in human colostrum-treated pups on post natal day (PND) 7 and 21 vs suckling pups in group 1. A delay in eye opening was noticed in the treated rats in group 1 on PND 13 compared with the control group and group 2. Administration of a single intraperitoneal injection of 600 mg/kg sodium valproate on day 12.5 after conception resulted in significantly reduced calcium and vitamin D levels in study 1 compared with the control groups (P < 0.001). However, human colostrum uptake inhibited increases in the level of transglutaminase antibody in autistic pups with coeliac disease. CONCLUSION: The effects of early-life nutrition and human colostrum on the functional maturation of the duodenal villi in autistic rats with coeliac disease that might limit or prevent the coeliac risk with autism.},

   abstract = {BACKGROUND AND GOALS: Growth retardation is one of the most important signs of childhood celiac disease (CD); however, it is not very well known whether craniofacial growth is also affected. We aimed to carry out a detailed craniofacial morphological study to derive a conclusion on the craniofacial features of children with CD. PARTICIPANTS AND METHODS: Eighty-four 2-16-year-old children with biopsy-proven CD and 84 age-matched and sex-matched healthy children were included. Of these, 37 children (44.0%) had been newly diagnosed and 47 (56.0%) were on a gluten-free diet. Anteroposterior and lateral photographs were evaluated using the Scion Image software program for the measurements of the distances between reference points on the face. RESULTS: Except for nasofrontal angle (nfa), nasolabial angle (nla), pronasale height (prnh), nasal dorsum height (ndh), and nasal radix height (nrh), all measurements were significantly greater in patients compared with controls. In celiac children, all facial proportions except forehead/face height (t-gl/t-gn) and nose length/face height (n-ns/t-gn) were significantly different from those of controls. Except for nla, prnh, ndh, nrh, t-gl/t-gn, face height to total face height ratio (sn-gn/t-gn), n-sn/t-gn, ear length to face height ratio (s-sba/t-gn), and face width to face height ratio (z-z/t-gn), all measurements were statistically different in those on a gluten-free diet and newly diagnosed children. CONCLUSION: Most of the facial measurements and proportions of celiac children were different from those of controls. Our data confirm those of a previous study reporting that the forehead proportion is not altered in childhood CD. Pathophysiological mechanisms underlying these alterations are not clear but disruptions of growth during certain critical periods may be responsible.},

   abstract = {Autoimmunity, gastrointestinal (GI) disorders and schizophrenia have been associated with one another for a long time. This paper reviews these connections and provides a context by which multiple risk factors for schizophrenia may be related. Epidemiological studies strongly link schizophrenia with autoimmune disorders including enteropathic celiac disease. Exposure to wheat gluten and bovine milk casein also contribute to non-celiac food sensitivities in susceptible individuals. Co-morbid GI inflammation accompanies humoral immunity to food antigens, occurs early during the course of schizophrenia and appears to be independent from antipsychotic-generated motility effects. This inflammation impacts endothelial barrier permeability and can precipitate translocation of gut bacteria into systemic circulation. Infection by the neurotropic gut pathogen, Toxoplasma gondii, will elicit an inflammatory GI environment. Such processes trigger innate immunity, including activation of complement C1q, which also functions at synapses in the brain. The emerging field of microbiome research lies at the center of these interactions with evidence that the abundance and diversity of resident gut microbiota contribute to digestion, inflammation, gut permeability and behavior. Dietary modifications of core bacterial compositions may explain inefficient gluten digestion and how immigrant status in certain situations is a risk factor for schizophrenia. Gut microbiome research in schizophrenia is in its infancy, but data in related fields suggest disease-associated altered phylogenetic compositions. In summary, this review surveys associative and experimental data linking autoimmunity, GI activity and schizophrenia, and proposes that understanding of disrupted biological pathways outside of the brain can lend valuable information regarding pathogeneses of complex, polygenic brain disorders.},

   abstract = {OBJECTIVES: The only treatment for celiac disease (CD) is life-long adherence to a gluten-free diet (GFD). Noncompliance is associated with signs and symptoms of CD, yet long-term adherence rates are poor. It is not known how the burden of the GFD compares with other medical treatments, and there are limited data on the socioeconomic factors influencing treatment adherence. In this study, we compared treatment burden and health state in CD compared with other chronic illnesses and evaluated the relationship between treatment burden and adherence. METHODS: Survey was mailed to participants with CD, gastroesophageal reflux disease (GERD), irritable bowel syndrome, inflammatory bowel disease, hypertension (HTN), diabetes mellitus (DM), congestive heart failure, and end-stage renal disease (ESRD) on dialysis. Surveys included demographic information and visual analog scales measuring treatment burden, importance of treatment, disease-specific health status, and overall health status. RESULTS: We collected surveys from 341 celiac and 368 non-celiac participants. Celiac participants reported high treatment burden, greater than participants with GERD or HTN and comparable to ESRD. Conversely, patients with CD reported the highest health state of all groups. Factors associated with high treatment burden in CD included poor adherence, concern regarding food cost, eating outside the home, higher income, lack of college education, and time limitations in preparing food. Poor adherence in CD was associated with increased symptoms, income, and low perceived importance of treatment. CONCLUSIONS: Participants with CD have high treatment burden but also excellent overall health status in comparison with other chronic medical conditions. The significant burden of dietary therapy for CD argues for the need for safe adjuvant treatment, as well as interventions designed to lower the perceived burden of the GFD.},

   abstract = {BACKGROUND: Vitiligo is an acquired, idiopathic disorder characterized by circumscribed depigmented macules and patches. The exact etiology and pathogenesis of vitiligo is not clear. Many theories have been presented regarding this subject among them aautoimmune theory is the most important one. The association of vitiligo with other autoimmune disorders has been reported, but the relationship between vitiligo and celiac disease is controversial. The aim of this study was to study the frequency of celiac autoantibodies in a group of vitiligo patients compared with control. METHODS: This was a cross sectional case control study that involved 128 individuals, 64 vitiligo patients and 64 individuals as control group. The means age of participants was 30.3 +/- 14.4 years. IgA anti Endomysial antibody and IgA anti-glutaminase antibody were measured by ELISA method in the serum of all participants. Data were analyzed by SPSS software version 15. RESULTS: The serum of two vitiligo patients (3.1%) was positive for antibodies. All control groups were seronegative for these antibodies (P < 0.05). There was no significant effect of sex and job on seropositivity. CONCLUSION: There may be a relationship between celiac disease and vitiligo. This may indicate a common basic autoimmune mechanism that is an explanation for few case reports that gluten free diets were effective in the treatment of vitiligo patients. Both T test and exact fisher test showed no effect of age, sex and job on seropositivity of these patients (P = 0.56 and P = 0.74, respectively).},

   abstract = {BACKGROUND: The majority of deleterious health consequences of coeliac disease (CD) are most likely to be secondary to intestinal inflammation; hence, mucosal recovery is a desirable goal of therapy. Follow-up in CD is controversial and serological response is often used as a surrogate for histological recovery. AIMS: To inform the clinical management of CD using comparative serological and histological data from a biopsy-driven pathway of care. METHODS: A retrospective analysis of the Cambridge Coeliac Clinic database of 595 patients routinely followed up by biopsy and serology. RESULTS: Paired biopsy results were available for 391 patients (15% seronegative). Persisting villous atrophy (VA) occurred in 182 patients (47%). The sensitivity of anti-tissue transglutaminase (TTG) antibody for ongoing VA was only 43.6%. Information on dietetic management and further biopsy to assess response was available for 94 initially unresponsive patients, in whom targeted dietetic intervention by removal of identified gluten sources or avoidance of trace amounts of gluten led to resolution of persistent VA in 50%. The effects of institution of a formal care pathway are analysed in 298 patients. Discharge to primary care and clinical management was facilitated by the information derived from repeat biopsy. CONCLUSIONS: Serology appears to be a poor surrogate marker for mucosal recovery on a gluten-free diet; dietary assessment fails to identify a potential gluten source in many patients with ongoing villous atrophy. The benefits of re-biopsy on diet include stratification of patients with coeliac disease suitable for early discharge from secondary care or those requiring more intensive clinical management.},

METHODS: We retrospectively reviewed the case records of 233 consecutive patients with celiac disease who were diagnosed at 12-18 years or >18 years of age. The diagnosis of celiac disease was made on the basis of the modified European Society of Pediatric Gastroenterology, Hepatology and Nutrition criteria. RESULTS: The diagnosis of celiac disease was made after 18 years of age in 153 (65.7%) patients. Median duration of symptoms at the diagnosis was 54 months (range 1 month to 29 years). In all, 103 (44.2%) patients with atypical manifestations were referred by other departments for evaluation. Chronic diarrhea (48.5%), short stature (27.0%) and chronic anemia (9.0%) were the common modes of presentation. Elevated level of aminotransaminase were present in 50 (24.3%) patients. Chronic diarrhea, hypocalcemia and hypoalbuminemia were present in significantly higher number of adult than adolescent patients. In all, 227 (97.4%) patients responded to a 6-month gluten-free diet and six non-responders were non-compliant. CONCLUSIONS: More than 40% of the patients with celiac disease present to clinicians other than gastroenterologists or internists with atypical manifestations. A high index of suspicion is required for diagnosing its variant forms.},

   abstract = {BACKGROUND: Life-long gluten-free diet (GFD) is the only recognised treatment for coeliac disease (CD). The present study aimed to determine the nutritional adequacy of the 'no detectable gluten' diet. METHODS: Seven-day prospective food intake was assessed in 55 patients who were adherent to a GFD for more than 2 years and in 50 newly-diagnosed age- and sex-matched patients (18-71 years, 24% male) studied prospectively over 12 months on GFD. Historical precoeliac intake was also assessed in the latter group. Intake was compared with Australian Nutritional Recommendations and the Australian population data. RESULTS: Nutritional intake was similar between groups. Of macronutrients, only starch intake fell over 12 months (26% to 23%, P = 0.04). Fibre intake was inadequate for all except in diet-experienced men. More than one in 10 of both newly-diagnosed and experienced women had inadequate thiamin, folate, vitamin A, magnesium, calcium and iron intakes. More than one in 10 newly-diagnosed men had inadequate thiamin, folate, magnesium, calcium and zinc intakes. Inadequate intake did not relate to nutrient density of the GFD. Inadequacies of folate, calcium, iron and zinc occurred more frequently than in the Australian population. The frequency of inadequacies was similar pre- and post-diagnosis, except for thiamin and vitamin A, where inadequacies were more common after GFD implementation. CONCLUSIONS: Dietary intake patterns at 12 months on a GFD are similar to longer-term intake. Dietary inadequacies are common and may relate to habitual poor food choices in addition to inherent deficiencies in the GFD. Dietary education should also address the achievement of adequate micronutrient intake. Fortification of GF foods also need to be considered.},

   abstract = {AIM: To examine beliefs about irritable bowel syndrome (IBS) management among primary care physicians. BACKGROUND: There have been considerable advances in evidence synthesis concerning management of IBS in the last five years, with guidelines for its management in primary care published by the National Institute for Health and Care Excellence (NICE). METHODS: This was a cross-sectional web-based questionnaire survey of 275 primary care physicians. We emailed a link to a SurveyMonkey questionnaire, containing 18 items, to all eligible primary care physicians registered with three clinical commissioning groups in Leeds, UK. Participants were given one month to respond, with a reminder sent out after two weeks. FINDINGS: One-hundred and two (37.1%) primary care physicians responded. Among responders, 70% believed IBS was a diagnosis of exclusion, and >80% checked coeliac serology often or always in suspected IBS. Between >50% and >70% believed soluble fibre, antispasmodics, peppermint oil, and psychological therapies were potentially efficacious therapies. The respondents were less convinced that antidepressants or probiotics were effective. Despite perceived efficacy of psychological therapies, 80% stated these were not easily available. Levels of use of soluble fibre, antispasmodics, and peppermint oil were in the range of 40% to >50%. Most primary care physicians obtained up-to-date evidence about IBS management from NICE guidelines. Most primary care physicians still believe IBS is a diagnosis of exclusion, and many are reluctant to use antidepressants or probiotics to treat IBS. More research studies addressing diagnosis and treatment of IBS based in primary are required.},

   abstract = {OBJECTIVES: Small bowel intraepithelial lymphocytosis (IELs) with normal villous architecture is a relatively common finding, often of uncertain significance. The aims of our study were to determine the prevalence of this finding, its clinical associations, its specificity for celiac disease (CD), and whether histologic clues exist that increase the specificity for CD in this setting, all in the pediatric population. METHODS: The Mayo Clinic electronic pathology database was searched between January 1, 2000 and December 31, 2009 for patients younger than 18 years who had the terms "normal villi" and "increased intraepithelial lymphocytes" in their small bowel biopsy reports. All of the slides were reviewed to confirm the histologic findings. Demographic, serologic, pathologic, and clinical informations were obtained. RESULTS: Among 1290 duodenal biopsies obtained from children during the years 2000 and 2009, 56 (4.3%) were noted to have "normal villous architecture with increased intraepithelial lymphocytes." In the 54 patients not known to have CD before biopsy, 48 (89%) had serologic testing for CD. Of these 48 patients, 9 were labeled with CD, although only 5 of 9 met the definite criteria for the diagnosis, based on a combination of serologic markers, human leukocyte antigen haplotyping, and response to gluten-free diet. No clinical features pointed to a diagnosis of CD. There was no correlation between CD and number of IELs, but patients with newly diagnosed CD were more likely to have a tip-heavy lymphocyte distribution. Other diagnoses made during the study period and in follow-up were inflammatory bowel disease (5), Helicobacter pylori infection (3), medication-related injury (10), and systemic autoimmune disorders (2). CONCLUSIONS: Increased IELs with normal villous architecture in small bowel biopsies are clinically important in children, and are associated with a new definite diagnosis of CD in 9% of pediatric patients. Even at this low sensitivity, clinical work-up for CD is mandated in all of the patients with this finding.},

   abstract = {BACKGROUND: Patients with celiac disease (CD) have a wide variety of symptoms, from being asymptomatic to having chronic diarrhea, abdominal pain, and extraintestinal symptoms. In the oral cavity, enamel defects and recurrent aphthous stomatitis are the most common symptoms. The aim of the study was to assess oral health, bacterial colonization and salivary buffering capacity of patients with CD at diagnosis were compared with patients with CD receiving a gluten-free diet (GFD) and healthy children. METHODS: Three groups were prospectively investigated: newly diagnosed CD, CD treated with GFD, and a control group. All of the children were examined by pediatric dentists, and saliva samples were collected for bacterial and pH analysis. RESULTS: Ninety children were enrolled in the study, 30 in each group. A higher prevalence of enamel hypoplasia (66%) was found in children with CD. Plaque index was significantly lower in the celiac-treated group, which correlated with oral health behavior: teeth brushing and frequency of eating between meals. Children receiving GFD brushed their teeth and used fluoride significantly more often than other children in the study. No difference between groups was found in snack consumption, mutans streptococci and lactobacilli counts in saliva, as well as pH and buffer capacity. CONCLUSIONS: A lower degree of plaque was found in children with CD receiving GFD. This finding could not be explained by salivary properties or bacteria, but rather by better oral hygiene. The results should raise the awareness of pediatric gastroenterologists toward oral health-related issues in children with CD.},

   abstract = {BACKGROUND: Celiac disease can present in children and adults with a variety of manifestations including a rare complication known as ulcerative jejunitis. The latter has been associated with refractory celiac disease in adult onset patients. The objective of this case report is to describe the first pediatric case of ulcerative jejunitis in celiac disease, diagnosed by capsule endoscopy, which was not associated with refractory celiac disease. CASE PRESENTATION: The 9 year old girl presented with a history of abdominal pain and vomiting. Laboratory investigations revealed a slightly elevated IgA tissue transglutaminase antibody level in the setting of serum IgA deficiency. Initial upper endoscopy with biopsies was not conclusive for celiac disease. Further investigations included positive IgA anti-endomysium antibody, and positive HLA DQ2 typing. Video capsule endoscopy showed delayed appearance of villi until the proximal to mid jejunum and jejunal mucosal ulcerations. Push enteroscopy with biopsies subsequently confirmed the diagnosis of celiac disease and ulcerative jejunitis. Immunohistochemical studies of the intraepithelial lymphocytes and PCR amplification revealed surface expression of CD3 and CD8 and oligoclonal T cell populations. A repeat capsule study and upper endoscopy, 1 year and 4 years following a strict gluten free diet showed endoscopic and histological normalization of the small bowel. CONCLUSION: Ulcerative jejunitis in association with celiac disease has never previously been described in children. Capsule endoscopy was essential to both the diagnosis of celiac disease and its associated ulcerative jejunitis. The repeat capsule endoscopy findings, one year following institution of a gluten free diet, also suggest that ulcerative jejunitis is not always associated with refractory celiac disease and does not necessarily dictate a poor outcome.},

   abstract = {PURPOSE: Celiac disease (CD) is an autoimmune enteropathy, triggered by dietary gluten. The only treatment is a strict gluten-free diet. Oats are included in the list of gluten-free ingredients by European Regulation, but the safety of oats in CD is still a matter of debate. The present study examined the capability of different oat cultivars of activating the gliadin-induced transglutaminase-2 (TG2)-dependent events in some in vitro models of CD. In addition, we compared this capability with the electrophoresis pattern of peptic-tryptic digests of the proteins of the oat cultivars. METHODS: K562(S) cells agglutination, transepithelial electrical resistance of T84-cell monolayers, intracellular levels of TG2 and phosphorylated form of protein 42-44 in T84 cells were the early gliadin-dependent events studied. RESULTS: The results showed that the Nave oat cultivar elicited these events, whereas Irina and Potenza varieties did not. The ability of a cultivar to activate the above-described events was associated with the electrophoretic pattern of oat proteins and their reactivity to anti-gliadin antibodies. CONCLUSION: We found significant differences among oat cultivars in eliciting the TG2-mediated events of CD inflammation. Therefore, the safety of an oat cultivar in CD might be screened in vitro by means of biochemical and biological assays, before starting a clinical trial to definitely assess its safety.},

   abstract = {OBJECTIVE: The purpose of this study was to investigate screening practices for celiac disease in patients with type 1 diabetes across North America. The research question investigated was whether diabetes centers screen for celiac disease in type 1 diabetes more frequently than other facilities. RESEARCH DESIGN AND METHODS: A survey with 27 questions on screening practices for celiac disease in patients with type 1 diabetes was designed by experts in celiac disease and diabetes. Surveys were sent by email to diabetes educators and dietitians throughout the United States and Canada between December 2010 and May 2011. RESULTS: There were 514 respondents from 484 endocrine clinics, diabetes clinics, private practices, community nutrition centers, and inpatient centers. Thirty-five percent of work locations screened for celiac disease, with endocrine clinics reporting screening at the highest frequency (80%). Tissue transglutaminase was the most common screening test used. The most frequently recommended treatment of confirmed celiac disease was a gluten-free diet. However, only 71% of respondents recommended biopsy in patients with positive serologies. Most respondents (55.3%) reported that the gluten-free diet resulted in symptom improvement in the majority of patients. CONCLUSIONS: Staff at endocrine clinics were more likely to suggest screening for celiac disease in patients with type 1 diabetes. Both low screening frequency as well as inconsistency in management of positive celiac disease serological tests indicated an increase in education regarding celiac disease in patients with type 1 diabetes is required. In addition uniform guidelines should be developed.},

The diagnosis of celiac disease was made on the basis of the modified European Society of Pediatric Gastroenterology, Hepatology, and Nutrition criteria. Of 25 patients (nine males; mean age 28.8 +/- 16.6 years) with celiac disease and cirrhosis, 17 patients presented predominantly with cirrhosis, while 8 presented primarily with celiac disease. Five patients had known cause of cirrhosis (autoimmune hepatitis, three; PBC, one; hepatic venous outflow tract obstruction, one); the remaining 20 were cryptogenic. Gluten-free diet led to improvement in diarrhea and anemia and to a better control of ascites and other features of liver failure. Some patients with cryptogenic cirrhosis have coexistent celiac disease, and they show response to gluten-free diet. Patients with cryptogenic cirrhosis should be screened for celiac disease.},

   abstract = {Idiopathic Pulmonary Hemosiderosis (IPH) is characterized by the triad of iron deficiency anemia, pulmonary infiltrates and haemoptysis with no recognizable cause. Since the first description of its association with Celiac Disease (CD) by Lane and Hamilton in 1971, only a few isolated cases have been reported in literature. Although it has been considered an uncommon association of two disease entities, recent reports indicate that prevalence of celiac disease is as high as one percent. Further, individually both celiac disease and IPH are known to present as refractory anemia only. We are reporting a young adult with Lane Hamilton Syndrome, who realized that he was having significant gastrointestinal complaints only when they disappeared on gluten free diet (GFD). This case report reiterates the fact that celiac disease should be considered in all patients of IPH because of the therapeutic implications. Further on review of literature, we believe that covert hemoptysis may be responsible for disproportionately severe anemia in patients of celiac disease. Thus, prevalence of this association may be more than currently believed. Further research in this regard may improve our understanding of pathogenesis of celiac disease.},

   abstract = {Metabolomics is the emerging science of measurement and analysis of metabolome--the complete set of low molecular weight compounds in a cell, tissue, organ or whole organism. One of the aims of metabolomics is to research the response of an organism to a pathophysiological insult by measuring the concentrations of small molecule metabolites in biofluids and tissues and its dynamics. Intestinal microbiota is most probably involved in the development and maintenance of autoimmune inflammation in ulcerative colitis and celiac disease. Gas chromatography-mass spectrometry (GC - MS) of serum generates comprehensive metabolic profiles, reflecting integrated human (systemic) and gut microbial metabolism which may be altered in disease states. The aim of this study was to investigate GC - MS-based serum metabolomic profiles in UC and CD patients. Serum metabolic profiles were collected from 75 individuals: 20 patients with mild-moderate active UC, 35 CD patients, and 20 healthy controls (HC). We characterized 84 serum metabolites by use GC-MS. 18 metabolites at least have a combined (human + microbial) origin. In serum of UC patients, phenylacetic acid (PAA), 4-hydroxyphenylacetic acid (4-HPAA), 3-indolylacetic acid (IAA), succinic acid (SA) and fumaric acid (FA) were the metabolites most prominently increased, whereas 3-phenylpropionic acid (PPA) was significantly decreased. Serum of CD patients showed significant increases in IAA, 3-indolepropionic acid (IPA), SA and FA. Increased serum levels of succinic acid suggest its possible damaging effect on intestinal mucosa especially in ulcerative colitis. Orally administered butyrate + inulin as supplement to mesalazine in UC or gluten free diet in CD was effective in reducing disease activity with a marked improvement of serum metabolomic profiles (including SA reduction) and gut microbiota in both diseases. There were no any adverse events.},

   abstract = {OBJECTIVES: Life-long, strict gluten-free diet (GFD) is the only treatment for celiac disease (CD). Because there is still uncertainty regarding the safety of oats for CD patients, the aim was to investigate whether dietary oats influence the immune status of their intestinal mucosa. METHODS: Paired small intestinal biopsies, before and after >11 months on a GFD, were collected from children with CD who were enrolled in a randomized, double-blind intervention trial to either of two diets: standard GFD (GFD-std; n=13) and noncontaminated oat-containing GFD (GFD-oats; n=15). Expression levels of mRNAs for 22 different immune effector molecules and tight junction proteins were determined by quantitative reverse transcriptase (RT)-PCR. RESULTS: The number of mRNAs that remained elevated was higher in the GFD-oats group (P=0.05). In particular, mRNAs for the regulatory T cell (Treg) signature molecules interleukin-10 (IL-10) and transforming growth factor-beta1 (TGF-beta1), the cytotoxicity-activating natural killer (NK) receptors KLRC2/NKG2C and KLRC3/NKG2E, and the tight junction protein claudin-4 remained elevated. Between the two groups, most significant differences were seen for claudin-4 (P=0.003) and KLRC3/NKG2E (P=0.04). CONCLUSIONS: A substantial fraction of pediatric CD patients seem to not tolerate oats. In these patients, dietary oats influence the immune status of the intestinal mucosa with an mRNA profile suggesting presence of activated cytotoxic lymphocytes and Tregs and a stressed epithelium with affected tight junctions. Assessment of changes in levels of mRNA for claudin-4 and KLC3/NKG2E from onset to after a year on oats containing GFD shows promise to identify these CD patients.},

   abstract = {A hallmark of active celiac disease (CD), an inflammatory small-bowel enteropathy caused by permanent intolerance to gluten, is cytokine production by intestinal T lymphocytes. Prerequisites for contracting CD are that the individual carries the MHC class II alleles HLA-DQ2 and/or HLA-DQ8 and is exposed to gluten in the diet. Dysbiosis in the resident microbiota has been suggested to be another risk factor for CD. In fact, rod shaped bacteria adhering to the small intestinal mucosa were frequently seen in patients with CD during the "Swedish CD epidemic" and bacterial candidates could later be isolated from patients born during the epidemic suggesting long-lasting changes in the gut microbiota. Interleukin-17A (IL-17A) plays a role in both inflammation and anti-bacterial responses. In active CD IL-17A was produced by both CD8(+) T cells (Tc17) and CD4(+) T cells (Th17), with intraepithelial Tc17 cells being the dominant producers. Gluten peptides as well as CD associated bacteria induced IL-17A responses in ex vivo challenged biopsies from patients with inactive CD. The IL-17A response was suppressed in patients born during the epidemic when a mixture of CD associated bacteria was added to gluten, while the reverse was the case in patients born after the epidemic. Under these conditions Th17 cells were the dominant producers. Thus Tc17 and Th17 responses to gluten and bacteria seem to pave the way for the chronic disease with interferon-gamma-production by intraepithelial Tc1 cells and lamina propria Th1 cells. The CD associated bacteria and the dysbiosis they might cause in the resident microbiota may be a risk factor for CD either by directly influencing the immune responses in the mucosa or by enhancing inflammatory responses to gluten.},

   abstract = {PURPOSE: Celiac disease (CD) is a chronic inflammatory disease requiring constant management with a gluten-free diet (GFD). Little is known about how CD impacts on health-related quality of life (HRQOL) in children and adolescents, and how they feel about and cope with CD and GFD. This qualitative study explores the impact of CD and GFD on HRQOL in everyday living of children and adolescents. METHODS: In focus group interviews, we investigated HRQOL in children and adolescents with CD in order to identify patient concerns in living with CD and on a GFD. Seven focus groups were formed with 23 children/adolescents and 3 parents. Interviews were transcribed verbatim. Grounded theory approach was applied to analyse the interviews. RESULTS: CD had varying impact on the children and adolescents HRQOL. Two major categories emerged with importance for HRQOL in children and adolescents with CD, having CD (constructed from the six subcategories: symptoms, the diagnosis-process, self-perception, awareness of CD, social and emotional impact of CD, and thoughts about the future) and coping with CD (constructed from the two subcategories: coping with food and coping with social situations). The complexity of coping with CD in social situations that involve food is presented in a flowchart. CONCLUSIONS: Children and adolescents showed large diversity in how much impact CD has on their HRQOL. Different ways of coping with CD and GFD were identified. Findings will be used to generate a patient-driven disease-specific questionnaire to measure HRQOL in children and adolescents with CD.},

   abstract = {Fibromyalgia syndrome is characterized by chronic generalized pain accompanied by a broad symptomatologic spectrum. Besides chronic fatigue, sleep disturbances, headaches and cognitive dysfunction that are extensively described in the literature, a considerable proportion of patients with fibromyalgia experience gastrointestinal symptoms that are commonly overlooked in the studies that are not specifically dedicated to evaluate these manifestations. Nevertheless, various attempts were undertaken to explore the gastrointestinal dimension of fibromyalgia. Several studies have demonstrated an elevated comorbidity of irritable bowel syndrome (IBS) among patients with fibromyalgia. Other studies have investigated the frequency of presentation of gastrointestinal symptoms in fibromyalgia in a nonspecific approach describing several gastrointestinal complaints frequently reported by these patients such as abdominal pain, dyspepsia and bowel changes, among others. Several underlying mechanisms that require further investigation could serve as potential explanatory hypotheses for the appearance of such manifestations. These include sensitivity to dietary constituents such as gluten, lactose or FODMAPs or alterations in the brain-gut axis as a result of small intestinal bacterial overgrowth or subclinical enteric infections such as giardiasis. The gastrointestinal component of fibromyalgia constitutes a relevant element of the multidisciplinary pathophysiologic mechanisms underlying fibromyalgia that need to be unveiled, as this would contribute to the adequate designation of relevant treatment alternatives corresponding to these manifestations.},

   abstract = {BACKGROUND: Fibromyalgia is a chronic musculoskeletal pain syndrome characterized by a broad spectrum of manifestations. Patients with fibromyalgia frequently suffer from manifestations similar to those experienced by patients with gluten-related disorders raising the possibility that some patients with fibromyalgia could suffer from underlying gluten sensitivity. OBJECTIVE: This study aims to assess whether avoiding gluten among patients with fibromyalgia and gluten sensitivity is beneficial. METHODS: Adult patients with fibromyalgia presenting gluten sensitivity symptoms are randomly allocated to receive gluten-free diet or hypocaloric diet for 24 weeks. The primary outcome measure is the mean change in the number of experienced gluten sensitivity symptoms. Secondary outcome measures include the mean changes in the body mass index, Revised Fibromyalgia Impact Questionnaire, Pittsburgh Sleep Quality Index, Brief Pain Inventory, Beck Depression Inventory-II, State-Trait Anxiety Inventory, Short-Form Health Survey and Patient Global Impression Scale of Severity. Other secondary outcome measures include the frequency of potential adverse events and the proportion of responders according to the Patient Global Impression Scale of Improvement. DISCUSSION: Previous studies assessing dietary interventions in fibromyalgia primarily evaluated their effects on the severity and impact of fibromyalgia symptoms and pain. The current study is the first to evaluate the effects of gluten-free diet on the gluten sensitivity symptoms experienced by patients with fibromyalgia. The results of this study will contribute to a better understanding of the potential role of gluten sensitivity in fibromyalgia.},

   abstract = {BACKGROUND/AIMS: The aim of this exploratory trial was to establish if the probiotic Bifidobacterium natren life start (NLS) strain strain may affect the clinical course and pathophysiological features of patients with untreated celiac disease (CD). Positive findings would be helpful in directing future studies. METHODS: Twenty-two adult patients having 2 positives CD-specific tests were enrolled. Patients were randomized to receive 2 capsules before meals for 3 weeks of either Bifidobacterium infantis natren life start strain super strain (Lifestart 2) (2x10(9) colony-forming units per capsule) (n = 12) or placebo (n = 10), whereas they also consumed at least 12 g of gluten/day. A biopsy at the end of the trial confirmed CD in all cases. The primary outcome was intestinal permeability changes. Secondary endpoints were changes in symptoms and the Gastrointestinal Symptom Rating Scale, and in immunologic indicators of inflammation. RESULTS: The abnormal baseline intestinal permeability was not significantly affected by either treatment. In contrast to patients on placebo, those randomized to B. infantis experienced a significant improvement in Gastrointestinal Symptom Rating Scale (P = 0.0035 for indigestion; P = 0.0483 for constipation; P = 0.0586 for reflux). Final/baseline IgA tTG and IgA DGP antibody concentration ratios were lower in the B. infantis arm (P = 0.055 for IgA tTG and P = 0.181 for IgA DGP). Final serum macrophage inflammatory protein-1beta increased significantly (P < 0.04) only in patients receiving B. infantis. The administration of B. infantis was safe. CONCLUSIONS: The study suggests that B. infantis may alleviate symptoms in untreated CD. The probiotic produced some immunologic changes but did not modify abnormal intestinal permeability. Further studies are necessary to confirm and/or expand these observations.},

   abstract = {Gluten exclusion (protein complex present in many cereals) has been proposed as an option for the prevention of diseases other than coeliac disease. However, the effects of gluten-free diets on obesity and its mechanisms of action have not been studied. Thus, our objective was to assess whether gluten exclusion can prevent adipose tissue expansion and its consequences. C57BL/6 mice were fed a high-fat diet containing 4.5% gluten (Control) or no gluten (GF). Body weight and adiposity gains, leukocyte rolling and adhesion, macrophage infiltration and cytokine production in adipose tissue were assessed. Blood lipid profiles, glycaemia, insulin resistance and adipokines were measured. Expression of the PPAR-alpha and gamma, lipoprotein lipase (LPL), hormone sensitive lipase (HSL), carnitine palmitoyl acyltransferase-1 (CPT-1), insulin receptor, GLUT-4 and adipokines were assessed in epidydimal fat. Gluten-free animals showed a reduction in body weight gain and adiposity, without changes in food intake or lipid excretion. These results were associated with up-regulation of PPAR-alpha, LPL, HSL and CPT-1, which are related to lipolysis and fatty acid oxidation. There was an improvement in glucose homeostasis and pro-inflammatory profile-related overexpression of PPAR-gamma. Moreover, intravital microscopy showed a lower number of adhered cells in the adipose tissue microvasculature. The overexpression of PPAR-gamma is related to the increase of adiponectin and GLUT-4. Our data support the beneficial effects of gluten-free diets in reducing adiposity gain, inflammation and insulin resistance. The data suggests that diet gluten exclusion should be tested as a new dietary approach to prevent the development of obesity and metabolic disorders.},

It is characterised by abnormal subepithelial collagen deposition and is typically associated with malabsorption, diarrhoea and weight loss. The clinical features of collagenous sprue often resemble those of coeliac disease and together with frequent histological findings like mucosal thinning and intraepithelial lymphocytosis the diagnosis may be hard to reach without awareness of this condition. While coeliac disease is treated using gluten restriction, collagenous sprue is, however, not improved by this intervention. In cases of diet-refractory 'coeliac disease' it is therefore essential to consider collagenous sprue to initiate treatment at an early stage to prevent the fibrotic progression. Here, we report a case of a 78-year-old man with collagenous sprue and present the clinical and histological manifestations as well as the successful treatment course that he underwent.},

Strikingly, however, continuous exposure to the exogenous dietary antigen gluten and gluten-specific adaptive immunity are required to maintain immunopathology. These observations challenge the notion that autoimmunity requires adaptive immune activation towards self antigens. Using coeliac disease as an example, we propose that other exogenous factors might be identified as drivers of autoimmune processes, in particular when evidence for T cells with specificity for self antigens driving the disease is lacking.},

   abstract = {OBJECTIVE: Late diagnosis of celiac disease (CD) is increasingly common, the implications of which are largely unknown. Although short stature is a common sign of childhood CD, the data on the height of adult CD patients is conflicting. This study investigates the final height of men and women diagnosed with CD in adulthood and attempts to identify influencing factors. PATIENTS AND METHODS: We performed a cross-sectional study of 585 adults at the Celiac Disease Center at Columbia University, comparing their height with the control population (NHANES). Patients were included if they were older than 18 years of age at diagnosis and if baseline height and weight were available. In addition, we examined for differences in demographic and physical features, mode of presentation, and concomitant illnesses in shorter versus taller celiac patients. RESULTS: Men (n=162) with CD diagnosed in adulthood were shorter than men in the general population (CD: 169.3 +/- 10.5 vs. 177.3 +/- 7.0 cm, P<0.01) whereas women (n=423) were not (CD: 166.3 +/- 9.4 vs. 163.2 +/- 6.7 cm). There were no statistically significant differences in age at diagnosis, BMI, concomitant autoimmune illnesses (hypothyroidism, type I diabetes, dermatitis herpetiformis), or mode of presentation in shorter versus taller CD patients of either sex. Hemoglobin was associated with short stature in CD men (short: 13.9 g/dl, tall: 14.6 g/dl; P=0.01), but not women (short: 12.9 g/dl, tall: 13.0 g/dl, P=0.41). CONCLUSION: Short stature is a well described phenomenon in pediatric CD with the potential for 'catch-up growth' on a gluten-free diet. However, among adults with CD who had attained final height before diagnosis, we found that men, not women, are shorter relative to the general population.},

   abstract = {BACKGROUND: Celiac disease (CD) is an autoimmune enteropathy induced by dietary wheat gluten that can have serious consequences if not diagnosed and treated early. It is important to be familiar with other alterations associated with gluten ingestion due to the multiplicity of clinical presentations. OBJECTIVES: To describe the most common CD presentation patterns and alterations associated with gluten in children from the northwest region of Mexico, with an incipient knowledge of its prevalence. PATIENTS AND METHODS: Age, sex, family history, and gastrointestinal and extraintestinal symptoms were recorded in 24 patients within the time frame of 2006 to 2010. Biochemical and hematologic data were collected. Anti-gliadin and anti-transglutaminase antibodies were analyzed in all the cases, and haplotypes (HLA-DQ2/DQ8) and duodenal biopsy were evaluated in some of the cases. RESULTS: Of the 24 patients (14 girls and 10 boys), 13 presented with typical CD with symptoms of poor gastrointestinal absorption; 7 patients with a mean age of 5 years presented with atypical CD; 2 had disease onset with gastrointestinal and extraintestinal (neurologic) problems; and 2 with other gluten-related disorders. All of the patients had positive serology; 11/15 presented with HLA-DQ2/DQ8 and 4 with at least one allele; damaged mucosa was observed in the 6 biopsies taken. A third of the patients were anemic, 6 presented with an albumin value of<3.5g/dL, and 4 with mineral deficiencies. A total of 83% of the patients improved with a gluten-free diet. CONCLUSIONS: The presentation patterns were: 1) typical CD, 2) atypical CD, 3) CD with gastrointestinal and extraintestinal (neurologic) symptoms, and 4) gluten-related disorders other than CD.},

   abstract = {BACKGROUND: Histologically nonresponsive coeliac disease (NRCD) is a potentially serious condition diagnosed during the follow-up of coeliac disease (CD) when patients have persistent villous atrophy despite following a gluten-free diet (GFD). AIM: As current assessments of recovery are limited to invasive and costly serial duodenal biopsies, we sought to identify antibody biomarkers for CD patients that do not respond to traditional therapy. METHODS: Bacterial display peptide libraries were screened by flow cytometry to identify epitopes specifically recognised by antibodies from patients with NRCD, but not by antibodies from responsive CD patients. Deamidated gliadin was confirmed to be the antigen mimicked by library peptides using ELISA with sera from NRCD (n = 15) and responsive CD (n = 45) patients on a strict GFD for at least 1 year. RESULTS: The dominant consensus epitope sequence identified by unbiased library screening QPxx(A/P)FP(E/D) was highly similar to reported deamidated gliadin peptide (dGP) B-cell epitopes. Measurement of anti-dGP IgG titre by ELISA discriminated between NRCD and responsive CD patients with 87% sensitivity and 89% specificity. Importantly, dGP antibody titre correlated with the severity of mucosal damage indicating that IgG dGP titres may be useful to monitor small intestinal mucosal recovery on a GFD. CONCLUSIONS: The finding of increased levels of anti-dGP IgG antibodies in CD patients on strict GFDs effectively identifies patients with NRCD. Finally, anti-dGP IgG assays may be useful to monitor mucosal damage and histological improvement in CD patients on a strict GFD.},

   abstract = {BACKGROUND & AIMS: Celiac disease shares features of other disorders. It can be diagnosed conclusively only based on duodenal histology analysis, which is not practical for screening purposes. Serologic analysis might be used to identify candidates for biopsy analysis. We aimed to develop a simple diagnostic approach that all clinicians could follow to increase the percentage of patients accurately diagnosed with celiac disease at initial presentation. METHODS: We performed a retrospective analysis of data from 752 patients (88 with celiac disease, none were IgA deficient) who attended a UK district general hospital from January 2007 through December 2008 and underwent biopsy analysis and serologic tests to measure endomyseal antibodies and IgA antibodies against tissue transglutaminase (tTG). Patients avoiding gluten in their diet were excluded. Patients were assigned to 1 of 4 groups: high-risk (based on presence of anemia, chronic diarrhea, unintentional weight loss, or dermatitis herpetiformis), low-risk (based on such factors as dyspepsia, abnormal liver function, ataxia, or chronic cough), nutrient deficiency (based on levels of iron, vitamins B12 and D, or folate), or screening (because they had type 1 diabetes or a family history of celiac disease). Patients with celiac disease were identified using the modified Marsh criteria (grades 1-3) for interpreting duodenal histology. We compared clinical category, serology profiles, and biopsy results between patients with and without celiac disease. RESULTS: Celiac disease was diagnosed in 64 of 565 patients in the high-risk group (11%), 14 of 156 patients in the low-risk group (9%; P = .47 compared with high-risk group), 7 of 28 patients in the nutrient-deficiency group, and 3 of 3 patients in the screening group. Among 71 patients who tested positive for both antibodies (tTG and endomyseal antibodies), the positive predictive value for celiac disease was 97%; a negative test result for tTG had a negative predictive value of 98%. Among 708 patients with normal-looking biopsy samples, only 62 had celiac disease (9%). Among 44 patients with abnormal biopsy samples, 26 had celiac disease (59%). CONCLUSIONS: Based on a retrospective analysis, patients with and without celiac disease cannot be distinguished based on clinical features. Patients who present with symptoms of celiac disease should be tested for tTG, to identify candidates for duodenal biopsy analysis.},

   abstract = {Celiac disease (CD) is an inflammatory affliction of the small bowel caused by an immunological hypersensitivity to ingested wheat antigens affecting almost 1 % of the population. The gliadin fraction of wheat has been shown to contain the pathogenic antigens which react with antibodies and T cells. However, there is only limited knowledge regarding the precise nature of the wheat antigens recognized by IgA antibodies from CD patients and diagnostic tests based on the gliadin fraction have been demonstrated to give frequently false positive results. The aim of this study was the characterization of wheat antigens specifically recognized by IgA antibodies of CD patients. We developed a combined biochemical, biophysical, and immunological approach for the identification of celiac disease-specific wheat antigens. It is based on sub-fractionation of the wheat gliadin fraction using two ion exchange chromatography steps, the localization of CD-specific antigens by immunoblotting with IgA antibodies from CD patients, subsequent digestion followed by electro spray ionization-liquid chromatography/mass spectrometry (LC-ESI-MS/MS) and N-terminal sequencing by Edman degradation. Through the sub-fractionation procedure it was possible to separate CD-specific IgA-reactive wheat antigens from other wheat antigens which were also recognized by IgA antibodies of individuals without CD or by CD patients on gluten-free diet. Analysis by LC-ESI-MS/MS and N-terminal sequencing of the sub-fractions and the proteins specifically recognized by CD patients identified certain gamma-gliadins with molecular mass of 37,000 and 45,000 as CD-specific wheat antigens. The CD-specific gamma-gliadins with the molecular mass of 37,000 and 45,000 should be useful to study pathomechanisms of the disease and to improve the specificity of diagnostic tests for CD.},

   abstract = {Coeliac disease (CD) is one of the most common diseases worldwide, resulting from a combination of environmental (gluten) and genetic (human leucocyte antigen (HLA) and non-HLA genes) factors. Depending on the geographical location, the prevalence of CD has been estimated to approximate 0.5-1%. The only treatment currently available for CD is a gluten-free diet (GFD) excluding gluten-containing cereals such as wheat, rye, and barley, and other foodstuffs with natural or added gluten. However, adherence rates and patient acceptance are often poor. Moreover, even in fully adherent patients, the diet may fail to induce clinical or histological improvement. Hence, it is unsurprising that studies show CD patients to be highly interested in non-dietary alternatives. The following review focuses on current pathophysiological concepts of CD, spotlighting those pathways which may serve as new possible, non-dietary therapeutic targets in the treatment of CD.},

   abstract = {OBJECTIVES: Undernourishment is common in children with cerebral palsy (CP), but the reasons are unknown. We previously reported elevated levels of immunoglobulin (Ig) A and IgG antibodies against gliadin (AGA) and tissue transglutaminase (tTG) in 99 children and young adults with CP without characteristic findings of gluten enteropathy in small bowel biopsies. Our aim was to perform a case-control study of IgG antibodies against other dietary antigens, AGA, anti-tTG, and IgE antibodies against wheat and gluten. METHODS: Sera from 99 cases with CP and 99 healthy, age- and sex-matched controls were analysed with fluorescence enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay for detection of IgG antibodies against beta-lactoglobulin, casein, egg white, IgG- and IgA-AGA, IgA-anti-tTG, and IgE antibodies against gluten and wheat. RESULTS: Compared with controls, the odds ratio in cases with CP for having elevated levels of IgG antibodies against beta-lactoglobulin was 17.0 (95% confidence interval [CI] 2.3-128), against casein 11.0 (95% CI 2.6-46.8), and against egg white 7.0 (95% CI 1.6-30.8). The IgE responses for wheat/gluten were generally low. The tetraplegic and dyskinetic CP subtypes had significantly higher frequencies of elevated levels for all of the tested antibodies except IgG against egg white, and IgA-anti-tTG. A significantly lower weight was seen in cases with CP with positive versus negative serology. CONCLUSIONS: Elevated levels of IgG against dietary antigens were more frequent in the CP group compared with controls, and particularly in the tetraplegic and dyskinetic CP subtypes with the most severe neurologic handicap and undernourishment. Hypothetically, malnourishment may cause increased intestinal permeability and thus immunization against dietary antigens.},

   abstract = {BACKGROUND & AIMS: The aim of our study was to determine whether the use of iron supplements during pregnancy affects the risk for celiac disease in children. METHODS: We assessed data from the prospective Norwegian Mother and Child cohort study, in which individuals with celiac disease were identified by answers on questionnaires and linkage to the Norwegian Patient Register. Complete data were available for 78,846 children (mean age 5.9 years, range 2-12 years); 314 children were identified with celiac disease. Questionnaires were given to pregnant women to collect information on use of iron-containing supplements, diet, anemia, and levels of hemoglobin. RESULTS: Celiac disease was diagnosed in 4.65 of 1000 children whose mothers took iron supplements while they were pregnant, compared with 3.15 of 1000 children whose mothers did not. After adjusting for children's age, sex, and age of gluten introduction, and the presence of celiac disease in mothers, iron supplementation during pregnancy remained significantly associated with celiac disease in children (odds ratio [OR], 1.33; 95% confidence interval [CI], 1.05-1.68; P = .019). However, celiac disease was not associated with the mothers' intake of iron from foods (adjusted OR, 1.00; 95% CI, 0.97-1.03). Anemia before or during the early stages of pregnancy was not significantly associated with the risk of celiac disease in children (adjusted OR, 1.24; 95% CI, 0.84-2.00; P = .24). The use of iron supplements during pregnancy remained significantly associated with celiac disease in children after adjusting for children who were given iron supplements before 18 months of age, which itself was associated with celiac disease. CONCLUSIONS: In a prospective Norwegian Mother and Child cohort study, we found an increased risk of celiac disease in children whose mothers used iron supplements during pregnancy; this association does not appear to arise from maternal anemia.},

   abstract = {INTRODUCTION: Currently, the only treatment for celiac disease is a gluten-free diet, and there is an increased desire for alternative therapies. In vitro and in vivo models of celiac disease have been generated in order to better understand the pathogenesis of celiac disease, and this review will discuss these models as well as the testing of alternative therapies using these models. AREAS COVERED: The research discussed describes the different in vitro and in vivo models of celiac disease that currently exist and how they have contributed to our understanding of how gluten can stimulate both innate and adaptive immune responses in celiac patients. We also provide a summary on the alternative therapies that have been tested with these models and discuss whether subsequent clinical trials were done based on these tests done with these models of celiac disease. EXPERT OPINION: Only a few of the alternative therapies that have been tested with animal models have gone on to clinical trials; however, those that did go on to clinical trial have provided promising results from a safety standpoint. Further trials are required to determine if some of these therapies may serve as an effective adjunct to a gluten-free diet to alleviate the adverse affects associated with accidental gluten exposure. A "magic-bullet" approach may not be the answer to celiac disease, but possibly a future cocktail of these different therapeutics may allow celiac patients to consume an unrestricted diet.},

   abstract = {Celiac disease is an autoimmune disorder resulting from gluten intolerance and is based on a genetically predisposition. Symptoms occur upon exposure to prolamin from wheat, rye, barley and related grain. The pathogenesis of celiac disease has not yet been sufficiently elucidated but is being considered as an autoimmune process. At its core are the deamidation of prolamin fragments, the building of specific antibodies and the activation of cytotoxic T-cells. The immunological inflammatory process is accompanied by structural damages of the enterocytes (villous atrophy, colonization and crypt hyperplasia). The symptoms and their extent depend on the type of the celiac disease; classic and non-classic forms are being distinguished (atypical, oligosymptomatic, latent and silent celiac disease). Characteristics of the classic presentation are malabsorption syndrome and intestinal symptoms such as mushy diarrhea and abdominal distension. The diagnosis of celiac disease is based on four pillars: Anamnesis and clinical presentation, serological evidence of coeliac specific antibodies (IgA-t-TG; IgA-EmA), small intestine biopsy and improvement of symptoms after institution of a gluten-free diet. The basis of the therapy is a lifelong gluten-free diet, i. e. wheat, rye, barley, spelt, green-core, faro-wheat, kamuth and conventional oats as well as food items obtained therefrom. Small amounts of up to 50 mg gluten per day are usually tolerated by most patients; amounts of > or = 100 mg/day lead mostly to symptoms. Gluten-free foods contain < or = 20 ppm or 20 mg/kg (Sign: symbol of the 'crossed ear' or label 'gluten-free'). At the beginning of the therapy the fat and lactose intake may need to be reduced; also the supplementation of single micronutrients (fat-soluble vitamins, folic acid, B12, iron, and calcium) may be required. Alternative therapies are being developed but have not yet been clinically tested.},

   abstract = {INTRODUCTION: The only current treatment for celiac disease is a strict gluten-free diet. The ubiquitous presence of gluten in groceries, however, makes the diet burdensome and difficult to maintain, and alternative treatment options are thus needed. Here, the important role of transglutaminase 2 (TG2) in the pathogenesis of celiac disease makes it an attractive target for drug development. AREAS COVERED: The present paper gives an overview of TG2 and addresses its significance in the pathogenesis of celiac disease. Moreover, the article summarizes preclinical studies performed with TG2 inhibitors and scrutinizes issues related to this therapeutic approach. EXPERT OPINION: Activation of TG2 in the intestinal mucosa is central in celiac disease pathogenesis and researchers have therefore suggested TG2 inhibitors as a potential therapeutic approach. However, a prerequisite for such a drug is that it should be specific for TG2 and not affect the activity of other members of the transglutaminase family. Such compounds have already been introduced and tested in vitro, but a major obstacle to further development is the lack of a well-defined animal model for celiac disease. Nonetheless, with encouraging results in preclinical studies clinical trials with TG2 inhibitors are eagerly awaited.},

   abstract = {BACKGROUND & AIMS: Coeliac disease is a chronic small intestinal immune-mediated enteropathy triggered by dietary gluten in genetically predisposed individuals. Since it is unknown if all wheat varieties are equally toxic to coeliac patients seven Triticum accessions showing different origin (ancient/modern) and ploidy (di-, tetra- hexaploid) were studied. MATERIALS AND METHODS: Selected strains of wheat were ancient Triticum monococcum precoce (AA genome) and Triticum speltoides (BB genome), accessions of Triticum turgidum durum (AABB genome) including two ancient (Graziella Ra and Kamut) and two modern (Senatore Cappelli and Svevo) durum strains of wheat and Triticum aestivum compactum (AABBDD genome). Small intestinal gluten-specific T-cell lines generated from 13 coeliac patients were tested with wheat accessions by proliferation assays. RESULTS: All strains of wheat independent of ploidy or ancient/modern origin triggered heterogeneous responses covering wide ranges of stimulation indices. CONCLUSION: Ancient strains of wheat, although previously suggested to be low or devoid of coeliac toxicity, should be tested for immunogenicity using gluten-specific T-cell lines from multiple coeliac patients rather than gluten-specific clones to assess their potential toxicity. Our findings provide further evidence for the need for a strict gluten-free diet in coeliac patients, including avoidance of ancient strains of wheat.},

Very few large series of lymphocytic colitis of childhood occurrence are available in the medical literature. Ten cases each of lymphocytic colitis and of colonic lymphocytosis of other diagnosis, all with duodenal disaccharidases analysis data, were collected from the files of our institution. The electronic medical records were reviewed and multiple variables were analyzed. The ten patients with lymphocytic colitis presented with diarrhea. Of these, three had abdominal pain. The age range was 2-18 years. Nearly all patients were Caucasian (90%) and 70% were female. Endoscopically, most had normal appearing colonic mucosa. Significant past medical history, family medical history and associated comorbidities included celiac disease, Down syndrome, juvenile arthritis and other autoimmune diseases. Interestingly, the most revealing observation was that the majority of cases (80%) were associated with lactase deficiency and, for the most part, gastrointestinal symptoms improved simply by treatment with Lactaid or avoidance of dairy products. This association is statistically significant. Our clinicopathological study indicates that the typical pediatric patient is a female Caucasian. A large of portion of the patients had associated lactase deficiency and improved on Lactaid supplement alone.},

   abstract = {BACKGROUND: Celiac disease is a chronic gluten intolerance which can cause small intestinal inflammatory lesions of different intensity, scope and distribution. OBJECTIVES: The aim of the study was to assess the distribution and scope of lesions revealed by endoscopy in the small intestine of children and adolescents with untreated celiac disease. MATERIAL AND METHODS: A total of nine patients aged from 15 to 18 years (average age: 16 years) were enrolled in the study, including seven girls and two boys who had been diagnosed with histologically confirmed celiac disease. Following a bowel cleansing all the patients were subjected to examination of the small intestine using an endoscopic capsule (EndoCapsule EC, Olympus, Tokyo, Japan). RESULTS: The examination was complete in eight of the patients. In six patients the capsule endoscopy revealed continuous lesions in the duodenum and the proximal small intestine. In one child continuous lesions occurred only in a short section of the bowel, within the duodenum. In one patient the abnormalities were located in the proximal small intestine without any lesions in duodenum. In one case, segmental lesions were observed in the distal small intestine, without any lesions in the duodenum or in the proximal part of the bowel. The results for the endoscopic markers of celiac disease were as follows: in all the patients a significant shortening or complete lack of villous structure was noted; in six patients scalloping was observed at the peaks of the circular folds; in three patients granulation was observed; and in three patients a mosaic mucosal pattern was noted. CONCLUSIONS: The most frequent type of lesions revealed by capsule endoscopy in pediatric patients with untreated celiac disease seems to be continuous lesions in the duodenum and the proximal small intestine. Some patients can develop macroscopic lesions (and probably microscopic ones as well) that are beyond the reach of traditional endoscopy. In such cases, capsule endoscopy can help to determine and diagnose celiac disease and to establish the need for lifelong dietary treatment.},

   abstract = {Celiac disease (CD) is a chronic autoimmune enteropathy caused by exposure to dietary gluten in genetically predisposed individuals. The transcription factor peroxisome proliferator-activated receptor gamma (PPARgamma) was shown to exert protective effects in several immune-mediated disorders. Activation of PPARgamma suppressed the expression of thymic stromal lymphopoietin (TSLP), an inducer of proinflammatory cytokines. Since the role of TSLP in gluten-sensitive enteropathy is completely unknown, we investigated the involvement of TSLP and its regulator PPARgamma in childhood CD. We collected duodenal biopsy specimens from 19 children with newly diagnosed CD, 6 children with treated CD (gluten-free diet, GFD), and 10 controls. Expression of mRNA and protein levels of PPARgamma, TSLP, and TSLP receptor were determined by real-time RT-PCR and Western blot, respectively. Duodenal localization of PPARgamma and TSLP was studied by immunohistochemistry. In duodenal mucosa of children with CD, the amount of PPARgamma was significantly lower and simultaneously that of TSLP significantly higher compared to controls (p < 0.05). In GFD-treated patients, the levels of PPARgamma mRNA and protein were significantly higher while that of TSLP markedly lower compared to newly diagnosed CD (p < 0.05). Immunohistochemistry revealed PPARgamma and TSLP expression in lamina propria immune cells and in enterocytes. Low expression of PPARgamma and high expression of TSLP in the duodenal mucosa of children with newly diagnosed CD suggest that they are involved in the pathophysiology of CD. We hypothesize that PPARgamma may be an inhibitory regulator of TSLP-stimulated inflammatory processes in CD.},

   abstract = {Gluten-sensitive enteropathy, also known as coeliac disease (CD), is an autoimmune disorder occurring in genetically susceptible individuals that damages the small intestine and interferes with the absorption of other nutrients. As it is triggered by dietary gluten and related prolamins present in wheat, rye and barley, the accepted treatment for CD is a strict gluten-free diet. However, a complete exclusion of gluten-containing cereals from the diet is often difficult, and new therapeutic strategies are urgently needed. A class of proteins that have already emerged as drug targets for other autoimmune diseases are the heat shock proteins (HSPs), which are highly conserved stress-induced chaperones that protect cells against harmful extracellular factors. HSPs are expressed in several tissues, including the gastrointestinal tract, and their levels are significantly increased under stress circumstances. HSPs exert immunomodulatory effects, and also play a crucial role in the maintenance of epithelial cell structure and function, as they are responsible for adequate protein folding, influence the degradation of proteins and cell repair processes after damage, and modulate cell signalling, cell proliferation and apoptosis. The present review discusses the involvement of HSPs in the pathophysiology of CD. Furthermore, HSPs may represent a useful therapeutic target for the treatment of CD due to the cytoprotective, immunomodulatory, and anti-apoptotic effects in the intestinal mucosal barrier.},

   abstract = {AIM: To assesses the safety and efficacy of Aspergillus niger prolyl endoprotease (AN-PEP) to mitigate the immunogenic effects of gluten in celiac patients. METHODS: Patients with initial diagnosis of celiac disease as confirmed by positive serology with subtotal or total villous atrophy on duodenal biopsies who adhere to a strict gluten-free diet (GFD) resulting in normalised antibodies and mucosal healing classified as Marsh 0 or I were included. In a randomised double-blind placebo-controlled pilot study, patients consumed toast (approximately 7 g/d gluten) with AN-PEP for 2 wk (safety phase). After a 2-wk washout period with adherence of the usual GFD, 14 patients were randomised to gluten intake with either AN-PEP or placebo for 2 wk (efficacy phase). Measurements at baseline included complaints, quality-of-life, serum antibodies, immunophenotyping of T-cells and duodenal mucosa immunohistology. Furthermore, serum and quality of life questionnaires were collected during and after the safety, washout and efficacy phase. Duodenal biopsies were collected after the safety phase and after the efficacy phase. A change in histological evaluation according to the modified Marsh classification was the primary endpoint. RESULTS: In total, 16 adults were enrolled in the study. No serious adverse events occurred during the trial and no patients withdrew during the trial. The mean score for the gastrointestinal subcategory of the celiac disease quality (CDQ) was relatively high throughout the study, indicating that AN-PEP was well tolerated. In the efficacy phase, the CDQ scores of patients consuming gluten with placebo or gluten with AN-PEP did not significantly deteriorate and moreover no differences between the groups were observed. During the efficacy phase, neither the placebo nor the AN-PEP group developed significant antibody titers. The IgA-EM concentrations remained negative in both groups. Two patients were excluded from entering the efficacy phase as their mucosa showed an increase of two Marsh steps after the safety phase, yet with undetectable serum antibodies, while 14 patients were considered histologically stable on gluten with AN-PEP. Also after the efficacy phase, no significant deterioration was observed regarding immunohistological and flow cytometric evaluation in the group consuming placebo compared to the group receiving AN-PEP. Furthermore, IgA-tTG deposit staining increased after 2 wk of gluten compared to baseline in four out of seven patients on placebo. In the seven patients receiving AN-PEP, one patient showed increased and one showed decreased IgA-tTG deposits. CONCLUSION: AN-PEP appears to be well tolerated. However, the primary endpoint was not met due to lack of clinical deterioration upon placebo, impeding an effect of AN-PEP.},

Osteomalacia complicating celiac disease had become more and more rare. We describe here a case of osteomalacia secondary to a longstanding untreated celiac disease. This patient complained about progressive bone and muscular pain, weakness, fractures and skeletal deformities. Radiological and laboratory findings were all in favor of severe osteomalacia. Improvement of patient's weakness and laboratory abnormalities was obvious after treatment with gluten free diet, vitamin D, calcium and iron.

   abstract = {BACKGROUND: Coeliacs require a life-long gluten-free diet supported by accurate measurement of gluten (hordein) in gluten-free food. The gluten-free food industry, with a value in excess of $6 billion in 2011, currently depends on two ELISA protocols calibrated against standards that may not be representative of the sample being assayed. AIM: The factors affecting the accuracy of ELISA analysis of hordeins in beer were examined. RESULTS: A simple alcohol-dithiothreitol extraction protocol successfully extracts the majority of hordeins from barley flour and malt. Primary hordein standards were purified by FPLC. ELISA detected different classes of purified hordeins with vastly different sensitivity. The dissociation constant (Kd) for a given ELISA reaction with different hordeins varied by three orders of magnitude. The Kd of the same hordein determined by ELISA using different antibodies varied by up to two orders of magnitude. The choice of either ELISA kit or hordein standard may bias the results and confound interpretation. CONCLUSIONS: Accurate determination of hordein requires that the hordein standard used to calibrate the ELISA reaction be identical in composition to the hordeins present in the test substance. In practice it is not feasible to isolate a representative hordein standard from each test food. We suggest that mass spectrometry is more reliable than ELISA, as ELISA enumerates only the concentration of particular amino-acid epitopes which may vary between different hordeins and may not be related to the absolute hordein concentration. MS quantification is undertaken using peptides that are specific and unique enabling the quantification of individual hordein isoforms.},

   abstract = {OBJECTIVE: Prior studies have shown that dietary gluten avoidance (DGA) is relatively common in children without previously diagnosed celiac disease (CD), and several clinical predictors of DGA have been found. However, available data on predictors of DGA in adults without diagnosed CD are limited. The aim of this study was to determine the independent predictors of DGA in this population. METHODS: We performed a structured medical record review of 376 patients, ages >/= 20 y, who had never been formally diagnosed with CD, presenting for an initial CD evaluation (ICD-9-CM 579.0) between January 2000 and December 2010 at two large Boston teaching hospitals. We collected data including demographic characteristics, medical history, history of CD serology before referral, and self-reported DGA. Predictors of DGA were determined using multivariable logistic regression. RESULTS: Mean age was 47 (SD = 17) years. We found that 41 patients (10.9%; 95% confidence interval [CI], 7.9-14.5) had avoided gluten at some time in their lives. Most patients had subjective abdominal complaints or bowel movement changes. History of CD seropositivity before referral was noted in 14%. Independent predictors of DGA (P < 0.05) were lactose intolerance (odds ratio [OR], 2.8; 95% CI, 1.1-7.5), food allergy (OR, 3.8; 95% CI, 1.04-13.7), and history of positive serology of less-specific CD markers before the referral (OR, 3.2; 95% CI, 1.3-7.9). CONCLUSIONS: Gluten avoidance is common in a clinic population of adults without prior CD diagnosis. The recognized predictors suggest that DGA may associate with conditions presenting with nonspecific gastrointestinal complaints and perhaps with the perceived benefits of DGA among patients with prior history of positive CD serology.},

CD is a condition with dysregulated systemic and intestinal mucosal immune responses to dietary gluten proteins among genetically predisposed individuals. We recently described spring birth as a novel risk factor for CD in children. We believe that the association between season of birth and CD is due to seasonal differences in sunlight exposure and subsequent vitamin D status. Concomitant with global increases in CD prevalence, vitamin D deficiency also is increasingly recognized in children worldwide. Recent studies have shown that vitamin D deficiency can cause improper immune responses, abnormal intestinal mucosal integrity and impaired local defence to pathogenic microbial agents. In conjunction with other potential aetiological factors, we propose a hypothesis model of early-life vitamin D deficiency in the pathogenesis of childhood-onset CD.},

   abstract = {OBJECTIVE: Oats are accepted in the gluten-free diet (GFD) for children with celiac disease (CD). Some reports have indicated, however, that not all celiac patients tolerate oats. We have previously shown that some children still have high levels of urinary nitric oxide (NO) metabolites as markers of intestinal inflammation after 1 year on GFD with oats. In this study, we measured urinary NO metabolites in CD children who had been consuming oats-containing GFD for an extended, 2-6-year period, also taking into consideration ordinary consumption of nitrite/nitrate-rich foods close to the urine sampling. MATERIALS AND METHODS: Morning urinary nitrite/nitrate concentrations were measured in 188 pediatric CD patients. A questionnaire was used to elucidate factors possibly affecting the urinary levels, for example, dietary factors, asthma, or urinary tract infection. RESULTS: Oats were consumed by 89.4% of the patients for a median time of 3 years. The median nitrite/nitrate level was 980 muM. The majority (70.2%) who consumed oats had low levels of urinary nitrite/nitrate, that is, <1400 muM, while 29.8% demonstrated high levels, that is, >1400 muM. Nitrite/nitrate-rich foods did not significantly influence the urinary concentrations. CONCLUSION: The urinary levels of NO metabolites revealed two subpopulations, one with high and one with low levels. The high levels could be possibly due to poor adherence to the GFD, sensitivity to oats, or some unknown factor(s). Nitrate-rich foods, asthma, or urinary tract infection did not affect the result. The elevated levels of NO metabolites could indicate mucosal inflammation and pinpoint the need of careful follow-up of children on oats-containing GFD.},

   abstract = {The only known treatment for celiac disease is a gluten-free diet (GFD), which initially meant abstention from wheat, rye, barley, and oats. Recently, oats free from contamination with wheat have been accepted in the GFD. Yet, reports indicate that all celiac disease patients may not tolerate oats. We hypothesized that celiac children comply well with a GFD and that most have included oats in their diet. A food questionnaire was used to check our patients; 316 questionnaires were returned. Mean time on the GFD was 6.9 years, and 96.8% of the children reported that they were trying to keep a strict GFD. However, accidental transgressions occurred in 263 children (83.2%). In 2 of 3 cases, mistakes took place when the patients were not at home. Symptoms after incidental gluten intake were experienced by 162 (61.6%) patients, mostly (87.5%) from the gastrointestinal tract. Small amounts of gluten (<4 g) caused symptoms in 38% of the cases, and 68% reported symptoms during the first 3 hours after gluten consumption. Oats were included in the diet of 89.4% of the children for a mean of 3.4 years. Most (81.9%) ate purified oats, and 45.3% consumed oats less than once a week. Among those who did not consume oats, only 5.9% refrained because of symptoms. General compliance with the GFD was good. Only the duration of the GFD appeared to influence adherence to the diet. Most patients did not report adverse effects after long-term consumption of oats.},

   abstract = {BACKGROUND: Most adult-onset sporadic ataxias are unexplained, and the claim that many of these may be a result of gluten sensitivity has led to uncertainty as to whether to test for anti-gliadin antibodies (alphaGAb) and, if present, whether to recommend a gluten-free diet or continue searching for other causes of ataxia. This uncertainty arises in part from the frequency of alphaGAb in the population (about 1 in 10), but recent work delineating transglutaminase 6 as the target antigen in gluten ataxia has clarified the situation somewhat. Our aim was to determine whether there is molecular mimicry between cerebellar Purkinje cell antigens and gluten in subjects selected for recent diagnosis of CD rather than for ataxia. RESULTS: High titre alphaGAb sera from 11 newly-diagnosed CD patients and normal sera from 10 healthy controls were used to detect cross-reacting antibodies to cerebellar and cerebral cortex antigens in mouse, monkey and human tissue. None of the CD patients displayed ataxia. Mouse and human cerebellar and cerebral cortex extracts were analysed by Western blot probed with CD and control sera. Immunofluorescence microscopy was used on mouse and monkey cerebellar sections immunostained with CD and control sera to detect cross-reacting IgG antibodies. Western blot analysis of cerebellar and cerebral cortex extracts probed with CD sera did not demonstrate any specific immunoreactivity unique to the cerebellum. An identical twin pair with CD produced different patterns of reactivity. Immunofluorescence staining of mouse and monkey cerebellar sections showed most control and CD sera reacted non-specifically, with the exception of two CD and one control sera, each having a unique staining pattern. CONCLUSIONS: CD patient sera with high titre alphaGAb do not detect a common Purkinje cell or cerebellar-specific epitope. The pattern of reactivity is not solely dependent on genetic background.},

Patients who avoid wheat and/or gluten (PWAWG) are a heterogeneous group and predominantly self-diagnosed prior to presenting for clinical evaluation. SPECIFIC AIM: We characterized PWAWGs seen at a tertiary care referral center and compared them to patients with celiac disease (CD) and subjects in the National Health and Nutrition examination survey (NHANES). METHODS: This was a cross-sectional study evaluating patients seen by four gastroenterologists at a CD referral center. Baseline characteristics, laboratory values, and medical comorbidities were compared to CD patients who presented at the same center and subjects enrolled in NHANES. RESULTS: Eighty-four PWAWGs were identified and compared to 585 CD patients and 2,686 NHANES patients. Thirty-two alternative diagnoses were made in 25 (30%) PWAWGs, including small intestinal bacterial overgrowth and fructose/lactose intolerance. When compared to patients with CD, PWAWGs had similar body mass index (BMI, 23.1 vs. 23.5, p = 0.54) and mean hemoglobin value (13.4 vs. 13.3, p = 0.6). When compared to male and female patients in NHANES, BMI, folate, and mean hemoglobin values were lower in PWAWGs. Both male and female PWAWGs had a lower prevalence of hypertension. CONCLUSION: While there are similarities between CD and PWAWGs that could possibly be due to shared HLA haplotypes or an effect of the gluten-free diet, alternative diagnoses are common in these patients. PWAWGs have a similar cardiovascular profile as CD patients in terms of lower BMI and lower prevalence of hypertension.},

   abstract = {BACKGROUND: Coeliac disease (CD) is an under-diagnosed and often misunderstood disease, yet is one of the most common food intolerance disorders. The only treatment available to prevent the health impacts of CD is a lifelong, strict gluten-free diet (GFD). There are few studies that explore the experiences of diagnosis and the everyday experiences of living with this chronic condition. METHODS: Utilising a qualitative study design, and purposive sampling, the present study describes the experiences of 10 women with coeliac disease in Victoria, Australia. Individual interviews were conducted with women aged between 31 and 60 years who had been diagnosed with CD for at least 2 years. RESULTS: A thematic analysis of the interview transcripts highlighted a number of issues for those living with the disease. Reactions to diagnosis, transition to a GFD and the changes needed to live with CD are discussed. CONCLUSIONS: A range of recommendations including the need to increase CD awareness and education and further research on the impacts of living with the disease are made.},

   abstract = {OBJECTIVES: A gluten-free diet is the treatment for celiac disease, but pharmaceutical agents are being developed. The level of interest amongst patients in using a medication to treat celiac disease is unknown. This study examined the level of interest amongst patients in medication to treat celiac disease. METHODS: A questionnaire was distributed to celiac disease patients and data were collected on demographics, presentation, and interest in medication. Three validated celiac disease-specific instruments were incorporated: Celiac Disease Associated Quality of Life, the Celiac Symptom Index, and the Celiac Dietary Adherence Test. RESULTS: Responses were received from 365 individuals with biopsy-proven celiac disease. Respondents were 78% (n = 276) female, 48% (n = 170) over 50 years of age, and experienced a classical (diarrhea predominant) presentation in 44% (n = 154). Of the 339 individuals answering the question regarding use of a medication to treat celiac disease, 66% were interested. Interest was greatest in older individuals (71% >50 years of age versus 60% <50 years of age, p = 0.0415), men (78% men versus 62% women, p = 0.0083), frequent restaurant customers (76% versus 58%, p = 0.0006), those dissatisfied with their weight (73% versus 51%, p = 0.0003) and those concerned with the cost of a gluten-free diet (77% versus 64%, p = 0.0176). Length of time since diagnosis, education, presentation, and symptoms with gluten exposure did not demonstrate any effect. Interest in medication was associated with a worse quality of life (CD-QOL 69.4 versus 80.1, p < 0.0001). CONCLUSIONS: Most individuals with celiac disease are interested in using a medication. Interest was highest among men, older individuals, frequent restaurant customers, individuals dissatisfied with their weight or concerned with the cost of a gluten-free diet, and those with a worse quality of life.},

   abstract = {AIM: To screen for neurological and behavioural disorders in a paediatric cohort of patients with coeliac disease (CD) in order to detect possible differences related to compliance with gluten-free diet (GFD). METHODS: We recruited a cohort of 139 patients divided into three groups: A (40 patients with newly diagnosed CD), B (54 patients with CD in remission after GFD) and C (45 patients with potential CD). Patients first underwent a screening neurological visit, detecting signs associated with CD, and then were evaluated with Pediatric Symptom Checklist (PSC), a psychosocial screen for cognitive, emotional and behavioural problems. RESULTS: In the group B as compared to group A, there was a statistically significant decrease (p < 0.05) in the incidence of chronic fatigue, headache and inattention. The same applied to patients compliant to GFD vs. non-compliant. Potential coeliacs turning into overt CD had a higher incidence of headache and inattention compared with potential coeliacs showing normal mucosa. The PSC mean score in group A was statistically higher than in group B. CONCLUSION: Gluten-free diet had a positive impact on neuropsychiatric symptoms. We suggest the use of PSC in the routine follow-up of coeliacs in order to allow an early detection of psychosocial problems.},

   abstract = {BACKGROUND: An increased risk of reproductive failures in women with celiac disease (CD) has been shown by several studies but a comprehensive evaluation of this risk is lacking. Furthermore, the pathogenic mechanisms responsible for obstetric complications occurring in CD have not been unraveled. METHODS: To better define the risk of CD in patients with reproductive disorders as well as the risk in known CD patients of developing obstetric complications, we performed an extensive literature search of Medline and Embase databases. Odds ratio (OR) and relative risk (RR) with 95% confidence intervals (95% CI) were used in order to combine data from case-control and cohort studies, respectively. All data were analyzed using Review Manager software. In addition, we summarized and discussed the current hypotheses of pathogenic mechanisms potentially responsible for obstetric complications occurring in CD. RESULTS: Patients with unexplained infertility, recurrent miscarriage or intrauterine growth restriction (IUGR) were found to have a significantly higher risk of CD than the general population. The OR for CD was 5.06 (95% CI 2.13-11.35) in patients with unexplained infertility, 5.82 (95% CI 2.30-14.74) in women experiencing recurrent miscarriage and 8.73 (95% CI 3.23-23.58) in patients with IUGR. We did not observe an increased risk of CD in women delivering small-for-gestational age or preterm babies. Furthermore, we found that in celiac patients, the risk of miscarriage, IUGR, low birthweight (LBW) and preterm delivery is significantly higher with an RR of 1.39 (95% CI 1.15-1.67), 1.54 (95% CI 1.22-1.95), 1.75 (95% CI 1.23-2.49) and 1.37 (95% CI 1.19-1.57), respectively. In addition, we observed that the risk for IUGR, LBW and preterm delivery was significantly higher in untreated patients than in treated patients. No increased risk of recurrent miscarriage, unexplained stillbirth or pre-eclampsia was found in celiac patients. In vitro studies have provided two main pathogenic models of placental damage at the feto-maternal interface. On the embryonic side of the placenta, a direct binding of anti-transglutaminase (-TG) antibodies to trophoblast cells and, thus, invasiveness reduction via an apoptotic damage, has been proposed. Anti-TG antibodies may also be detrimental to endometrial angiogenesis as shown in vitro in human endometrial endothelial cells (cultures and in vivo in a murine model). The angiogenesis inhibition seems to be the final effect of anti-TG antibody-mediated cytoskeletal damage in endometrial endothelial cells. CONCLUSIONS: Physicians should investigate women with unexplained infertility, recurrent miscarriage or IUGR for undiagnosed CD. Women with CD show an increased risk of miscarriage, IUGR, LBW and preterm delivery. However, the risk is significantly reduced by a gluten-free diet. These patients should therefore be made aware of the potential negative effects of active CD also in terms of reproductive performances, and of the importance of a strict diet to ameliorate their health condition and reproductive health. Different mechanisms seem to be involved in determining placental tissue damage in CD patients.},

   abstract = {Celiac disease is a chronic small intestinal immune-mediated enteropathy precipitated by exposure to dietary gluten in genetically predisposed individuals and represents a major health issue. The immune mediated response results in villous atrophy of the small intestine with subsequent malabsorption. The classic mode of presentation is that of a malabsorption syndrome resulting in deficiencies of macro and micronutrients. The gluten-free diet is the only treatment currently available for this disorder. The aim of this special report is to elucidate and explain the various nutritional deficiencies seen in newly diagnosed patients with celiac disease and while on the gluten-free diet. Though initiation of the gluten-free diet results in improvement of symptoms and most deficiencies, certain nutritional limitations are associated with the gluten-free diet.},

   abstract = {Whole-grain foods such as oats may protect against colorectal cancer and have benefits on inflammatory bowel disease and coeliac disease. The present study aimed to systematically review the literature describing intervention studies that investigated the effects of oats or oat bran on risk factors for bowel disease. A literature search was conducted using Embase, Medline and the Cochrane library, which identified 654 potential articles. Thirty-eight articles describing twenty-nine studies met the inclusion criteria. Two studies carried out in participants with a history of colorectal adenomas found no effects of increased oat-bran intake on indirect risk makers for colorectal cancer. One of two interventions with oat bran in patients with ulcerative colitis showed small improvements in the patients' conditions. Most of the eleven studies carried out in adults with coeliac disease showed no negative effects of uncontaminated oat consumption. The fourteen studies carried out in volunteers with no history of bowel disease suggest that oats or oat bran can significantly increase stool weight and decrease constipation, but there is a lack of evidence to support a specific effect of oats on bowel function compared with other cereals. A long-term dietary intake of oats or oat bran could benefit inflammatory bowel disorders, but this remains to be proven. A protective effect on colorectal adenoma and cancer incidence has not yet been convincingly shown. The majority of patients with coeliac disease could consume up to 100 g/d of uncontaminated oats, which would increase the acceptability of, and adherence to, a gluten-free diet.},

The following two themes associated with health risks were covered: (1) the impact of age and diet on the gut microbiota and (2) the gut microbiota's interaction with the host. The strong influence of the maternal gut microbiota on neonatal colonisation was reported, as well as rapid changes in the gut microbiome of older people who move from community living to residential care. The effects of dietary changes on gut metabolism were described and the potential influence of inter-individual microbiota differences was noted, in particular the presence/absence of keystone species involved in butyrate metabolism. Several speakers highlighted the association between certain metabolic disorders and imbalanced or less diverse microbiota. Data from metagenomic analyses and novel techniques (including an ex vivo human mucosa model) provided new insights into the microbiota's influence on coeliac, obesity-related and inflammatory diseases, as well as the potential of probiotics. Akkermansia muciniphila and Faecalibacterium prausnitzii were suggested as targets for intervention. Host-microbiota interactions were explored in the context of gut barrier function, pathogenic bacteria recognition, and the ability of the immune system to induce either tolerogenic or inflammatory responses. There was speculation that the gut microbiota should be considered a separate organ, and whether analysis of an individual's microbiota could be useful in identifying their disease risk and/or therapy; however, more research is needed into specific diseases, different population groups and microbial interventions including probiotics.},

   abstract = {OBJECTIVE: Recent work indicates that the gut microflora is altered in patients with coeliac disease (CD). Faecal short-chain fatty acids (SCFAs) are produced by the gut microflora. We have previously reported a high SCFA output in children with symptomatic and asymptomatic CD at presentation, as well as in CD children on a gluten-free diet (GFD) for less than 1 year, indicating deviant gut microfloral function. In this report, we focus on faecal SCFA production in coeliacs on GFD for more than 1 year. MATERIALS AND METHODS: Faecal samples were collected from 53 children with CD at presentation, 74 coeliac children on GFD for less than 1 year, and 25 individuals diagnosed with CD in childhood and on GFD for more than 1 year. The control group comprised 54 healthy children (HC). The faecal samples were analysed to show the SCFA pattern taken as a marker of gut microflora function. We applied a new fermentation index, reflecting the inflammatory activity of the SCFAs (amount of acetic acid minus propionic acid and n-butyric acid, together divided by the total amount of SCFAs). RESULTS: In coeliacs on GFD for more than 1 year, the individual SCFAs, total SCFA, and fermentation index did not differ significantly from the findings in controls. In contrast, the faecal SCFA level was clearly higher in coeliacs treated with GFD for less than 1 year compared to those more than 1 year. CONCLUSIONS: This is the first study on SCFA patterns in faecal samples from individuals with CD on GFD for more than 1 year. Our study indicates that the disturbed gut microflora function in children with CD at presentation and after less than 1 year of GFD, previously demonstrated by us, is normalised on GFD for more than 1 year.},

   abstract = {BACKGROUND: Faecal short chain fatty acids (SCFAs) are produced by the gut microflora. We have previously reported high faecal SCFA levels in children with coeliac disease (CD), indicating alteration in gut microfloral metabolism. Data accumulated over recent decades by us and others suggest that wheat-free oats can safely be included in a gluten-free diet (GFD). However, concerns have been raised with respect to the safety of oats in a subset of coeliacs. AIM: To describe faecal SCFA patterns in children with newly diagnosed CD treated for 1 year with a GFD with or without oats. METHODS: This report is part of a randomised, double-blind study on the effect of a GFD containing oats (GFD-oats) vs. a standard GFD (GFD-std). Faecal samples were received from 34 children in the GFD-oats group and 37 in the GFD-std group at initial diagnosis and/or after 1 year on a GFD. Faecal SCFAs were analysed. RESULTS: The GFD-std group had a significantly lower total faecal SCFA concentration at 12 months compared with 0 months (P < 0.05). In contrast, total SCFA in the GFD-oats group remained high after 1 year on the GFD. The children in the GFD-oats group had significantly higher acetic acid (P < 0.05), n-butyric acid (P < 0.05) and total SCFA concentration (P < 0.01) after 1-year diet treatment compared to the GFD-std group. CONCLUSIONS: Our results indicate that oats do affect the gut microflora function, and that some coeliac children receiving oats may develop gut mucosal inflammation, that may present a risk for future complications.},

This host-microbiota interaction may influence the development of CD and possibly other diseases with autoimmune components. We examined duodenal biopsies from a total of 30 children, of which 10 had both celiac disease (CD) and type 1 diabetes (T1D); 10 had CD alone; and 10 were suspected of having gastrointestinal disease, but had normal duodenal histology (non-CD controls). Patients with both CD and T1D were examined before and after remission following a gluten-free diet. We performed lectin histochemistry using peanut agglutinin (PNA) and Ulex europaeus agglutinin (UEA) staining for Gal-beta(1,3)-GalNAc and Fucalpha1-2Gal-R, respectively, of the glycocalyx/mucous layer. The staining was scored based on dissemination of stained structures on a scale from 0 to 3. Evaluation of the scores revealed no difference between biopsies obtained before and after remission in the group of children with both CD and T1D. A comparison of this pre-remission group with the children who had CD alone or the non-CD controls also showed no significant differences. Based on our material, we found no indication that the presence of Gal-beta(1,3)-GalNAc or Fucalpha1-2Gal-R is involved in the susceptibility to CD, or that the disease process affects the expression of these carbohydrates.},

   abstract = {BACKGROUND: A subset of celiac patients shows a high risk for small bowel malignancies. AIMS: To select celiac patients considered at risk and evaluate the diagnostic yield of enteroscopy in this context. METHODS: Celiac patients were enrolled from a tertiary referral centre during the period June 2011-June 2013, based on the following criteria: (i) patients diagnosed when aged 50+ and with poor response to gluten-free dieting; (ii) low dietary compliance; (iii) alarm symptoms. The patients underwent small bowel capsule endoscopy and/or double-balloon enteroscopy. Control populations were represented by the 165 non-celiac patients undergoing capsule endoscopy for obscure gastrointestinal bleeding, and the 815,362-strong population of the Italian province of Varese as a registered cohort. RESULTS: Fifty-three patients (19% males, mean age 43.6+/-17.4 years) were evaluated. Two jejunal adenocarcinomas and one ileal neuro-endocrine tumour were diagnosed by enteroscopy (the diagnostic yield for malignancies in the selected population being 5.7%). In the non-celiac controls the detection rate of small bowel tumours by capsule endoscopy was 0.6% (P=0.04). When compared to the registered population, the relative risk for intestinal malignancy was 1282 (95% CI, 407-4033; P<0.0001). CONCLUSIONS: Capsule endoscopy and double-balloon enteroscopy can be considered for early disease management of a subset of celiac patients.},

   abstract = {AIM: Little information exists regarding parental knowledge of CD at diagnosis. We aimed for assessment of parental information at disease diagnosis to help us develop a tailored coeliac information package. METHODS: Children and teenagers referred for endoscopy and duodenal biopsy, with the sole indication for the diagnosis of CD, were prospectively recruited to the study. Parents were asked information and concerns regarding use of GFD. RESULTS: Sixty-three children (median 6.9 yrs (IQR 3.71-10.94)) and families were prospectively recruited in the study. The parents were very knowledgeable with an impressive 98% of the parents understanding that GFD is the treatment of CD; 95% knowing that this treatment is for life. However, specific dietary information was lacking with one-third correctly identifying all the Gluten containing foods. Internet (70.6%) was the most common source of information. Knowing someone with CD (p = 0.038), particularly in the same household in the family (p = 0.013) and researching about the disease (p = 0.001) rather than level of parental education (p = ns) was predictive of better parental knowledge. CONCLUSION: Internet is a major influence to parental knowledge in today's age but there is a continued need for hospitals regarding provision of accurate information and alleviating anxieties regarding use of GFD.},

   abstract = {Celiac disease is a complex disorder, the development of which is controlled by a combination of genetic (HLA alleles) and environmental (gluten ingestion) factors. New diagnostic guidelines developed by ESPGHAN emphasize the crucial role of serological tests in the diagnostic process of symptomatic subjects, and of the detection of HLA DQ2/DQ8 alleles in defining a diagnosis in asymptomatic subjects belonging to at-risk groups. The serological diagnosis of CD is based on the detection of class IgA anti-tissue transglutaminase (anti-tTG) and anti-endomysial antibodies. In patients with IgA deficiency, anti-tTG or anti-deamidated gliadin peptide antibody assays of the IgG class are used. When anti-tTG antibody levels are very high, antibody specificity is absolute and CD can be diagnosed without performing a duodenum biopsy. Non-celiac gluten sensitivity is a gluten reaction in which both allergic and autoimmune mechanisms have been ruled out. Diagnostic criteria include the presence of symptoms similar to those of celiac or allergic patients; negative allergological tests and absence of anti-tTG and EMA antibodies; normal duodenal histology; evidence of disappearance of the symptoms with a gluten-free diet; relapse of the symptoms when gluten is reintroduced.},

   abstract = {It has always been known that anti-tissue transglutaminase 2 (anti-TG2) antibodies are produced in the small intestine. Their serum titres correlate with mucosal damage degree and decrease on a gluten-free diet (GFD). We aimed to correlate intestinal anti-TG2 antibodies levels with degree of mucosal damage and GFD duration. Thirty-four active, 71 potential and 24 CD patients on GFD for at least 2 years were enrolled. Anti-TG2 deposits were detected in intestinal biopsies by double immunofluorescence. Biopsies were cultured for 24 h with medium, and with gliadin peptic tryptic digest (PTG) or A-gliadin peptide 31-43 (P31-43). Anti-TG2 antibodies secreted into supernatants were measured by enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay (ELISA). All active CD patients secreted high titres of anti-TG2 antibodies into culture medium that increased with the worsening of mucosal injury (Spearman's r = 0.71; P < 0.0001). Seventy of 71 potential CD patients and 15 of 24 treated CD patients secreted low titres of anti-TG2 antibodies into supernatants, eight of nine negative treated patients being on GFD for more than 10 years. An inverse correlation between antibody titres and duration of GFD was found, (Spearman's r = -0.52; P < 0.01). All active, 53 of 71 potential and six of 24 treated, CD patients showed anti-TG2 mucosal deposits. Five of six positive treated CD patients had been on GFD for fewer than 6 years and were also positive for secreted anti-TG2. In treated patients, PTG/P31-43 was not able to induce secretion of anti-TG2 antibodies into culture medium. Measurement of anti-TG2 antibodies in biopsy supernatants proved to be more sensitive than detection by immunofluorescence to reveal their intestinal production. Intestinal antiTG2 antibodies titres correlated positively with the degree of mucosal damage and inversely with the duration of GFD.},

RECENT FINDINGS: New clues to the pathogenesis of celiac disease continue to emerge that may implicate the role of microbiome changes, antirotavirus VP7 antibodies, and the Parkinson's disease seven gene in celiac disease. Updated guidelines in pediatrics no longer support biopsies in all patients with celiac disease who have been identified by serology, clinical signs, and genetics. Serology screening of total immunoglobulin A in all patients may not be necessary in select patients. Prevalence and additional diseases associated with celiac disease continue to be elucidated. SUMMARY: Our knowledge of celiac disease continues to grow with increasing evidence of the pathogenesis, genetics, diagnosis, and risk factors of the disease. Major changes have been made with respect to the guidelines for pediatric celiac disease, and potential improvements to simplify the algorithms for diagnosis and elimination of unessential testing have been proposed by new studies.},

Aim. Evaluation of anti-endomysium (EmA) and anti-tissue transglutaminase IgA (tTG-A) antibodies in CD diagnosis, GFD monitoring, and first degree relatives screening in CD adult patients. Methods. 70 newly diagnosed Greek adult patients, 70 controls, and 47 first degree relatives were tested for the presence of EmA and tTG-A. The CD patients were monitored during a 3-year period. Results. EmA predictive ability for CD diagnosis was slightly better compared to tTG-A (P = 0.043). EmA could assess compliance with GFD already from the beginning of the diet, while both EmA and tTG-A had an equal ability to discriminate between strictly and partially compliant patients after the first semester and so on. Screening of first degree relatives resulted in the identification of 2 undiagnosed CD cases. Conclusions. Both EmA and tTG-A are suitable markers in the CD diagnosis, in the screening of CD among first degree relatives, having also an equal performance in the long term monitoring.},

   abstract = {Dietary interventions like gluten-free and casein-free diets have been reported to improve intestinal, autoimmune and neurological symptoms in patients with a variety of conditions; however, the underlying mechanism of benefit for such diets remains unclear. Epigenetic programming, including CpG methylation and histone modifications, occurring during early postnatal development can influence the risk of disease in later life, and such programming may be modulated by nutritional factors such as milk and wheat, especially during the transition from a solely milk-based diet to one that includes other forms of nutrition. The hydrolytic digestion of casein (a major milk protein) and gliadin (a wheat-derived protein) releases peptides with opioid activity, and in the present study, we demonstrate that these food-derived proline-rich opioid peptides modulate cysteine uptake in cultured human neuronal and gastrointestinal (GI) epithelial cells via activation of opioid receptors. Decreases in cysteine uptake were associated with changes in the intracellular antioxidant glutathione and the methyl donor S-adenosylmethionine. Bovine and human casein-derived opioid peptides increased genome-wide DNA methylation in the transcription start site region with a potency order similar to their inhibition of cysteine uptake. Altered expression of genes involved in redox and methylation homeostasis was also observed. These results illustrate the potential of milk- and wheat-derived peptides to exert antioxidant and epigenetic changes that may be particularly important during the postnatal transition from placental to GI nutrition. Differences between peptides derived from human and bovine milk may contribute to developmental differences between breastfed and formula-fed infants. Restricted antioxidant capacity, caused by wheat- and milk-derived opioid peptides, may predispose susceptible individuals to inflammation and systemic oxidation, partly explaining the benefits of gluten-free or casein-free diets.},

   abstract = {Celiac disease (CD) has a multifactorial etiology with complex genetics and frequently occurs in association with other autoimmune disorders. Even though triggered by a dietary antigen, it shows many autoimmune features, the most peculiar being the presence of high titers of anti-tissue transglutaminase 2 autoantibodies, produced in the small intestinal mucosa since the early stages of the disease. More than 60% of CD-associated susceptibility loci are shared with at least another autoimmune condition, suggesting common pathogenic mechanisms. In particular, recognition of peptides by HLA molecules, posttranslational modifications required for optimal peptide binding and immune mechanisms leading to tissue damage have been found in CD as well as in other autoimmune diseases. This review briefly summarizes the main autoimmune features of CD, underlining the similarities with other autoimmune disorders, in particular with type 1 diabetes mellitus. Furthermore, the role of gluten and microbiome in driving autoimmunity is discussed.},

   abstract = {BACKGROUND: Coeliac disease is a condition characterized by a wide spectrum of clinical manifestations. Any organ can be affected and, among others, dental enamel defects have been described. Our aims were to study the prevalence of dental enamel defects in adults with coeliac disease and to investigate a correlation between the grade of teeth lesion and clinical parameters present at the time of diagnosis of coeliac disease. METHODS: A dental examination was performed in 54 coeliac disease patients (41 F, mean age 37 +/- 13 years, mean age at diagnosis 31 +/- 14 years). Symptoms leading to diagnosis were diarrhoea/weight loss (32 pts.), anaemia (19 pts.), familiarity (3 pts.); none of the patients was diagnosed because of enamel defects. At the time of evaluation, they were all on a gluten-free diet. Enamel defects were classified from grade 0 to 4 according to its severity. RESULTS: Enamel defects were observed in 46/54 patients (85.2%): grade 1 defects were seen in 18 patients (33.3%) grade 2 in 16 (29.6%), grade 3 in 8 (14.8%), and grade 4 in 4 (7.4%). We also observed that grades 3 and 4 were more frequent in patients diagnosed with classical rather than non-classical coeliac disease (10/32 vs. 2/20). However, this was not statistically significant. CONCLUSION: This study confirms that enamel defects are common in adult coeliac disease. Observation of enamel defects is an opportunity to diagnose coeliac disease.},

   abstract = {BACKGROUND/OBJECTIVES: In the era of modern multidisciplinary clinical management, very little is known about the prevalence and presentation of malnutrition in children with gastrointestinal disorders (GastroD) particularly employing composite, global measures of nutritional status. SUBJECTS/METHODS: Anthropometry, body composition, dietary intake, eating habits and grip strength were assessed with bedside methods in 168 patients from outpatient gastroenterology clinics (n, median (IQR) years; Crohn's disease (CD): n=53, 14.2 (11.6:15.4); ulcerative colitis (UC): n=27, 12.2 (10.7:14.2); coeliac disease: n=31, 9.3 (7.5:13.6); other GastroD: n=57, 9.8 (7.2:13.8)) and compared with 62 contemporary healthy controls (n, median (IQR): 9.8 (6.9:13.8)) and the results of the recent UK, National Diet and Nutritional Survey (NDNS). RESULTS: Children with CD had lower BMI z-scores than controls (median (IQR): -0.3 (-0.9:0.4) vs 0.3 (-0.6:1.4); P=0.02) but only 2% were classified as thin (BMI z-score <-2 s.d.). The prevalence of obesity in children with UC was 19%, 6% in CD, 11% in children with other GastroD and 15% in controls. No difference was found in grip strength measurement between groups. Except for CD children, the proportion of patients with suboptimal micronutrient intake was similar to that of controls and the cohort of children from the latest NDNS. A higher proportion of children with CD had suboptimal intake for riboflavin, vitamin B6 and calcium and consumed significantly more meat products, juices (including carbonated drinks), spreads/jams and crisps and savoury snacks and significantly fewer portions of dairy, fish, fruits and vegetables compared with healthy controls. CONCLUSIONS: GastroD affect children's body composition, growth, strength, dietary intake and eating habits, particularly CD, but to a lesser extent than expected.},

The diagnosis of DH is often challenging because of its wide spectrum of clinical presentations. We here report 2 patients with DH in whom finger petechiae represented the initial and leading manifestation of the disease, and the confirmed diagnosis critically relied on immunopathological studies. Therefore, besides the classic causes, clinicians should also consider DH in the differential diagnosis of acral purpura, even in patients only presenting with discrete acral petechial lesions. We also review the recent literature regarding the rare cases of petechiae in adult DH patients.},

Some studies suggest that a gluten-free diet is effective in treating the depression, anxiety, and neurological complications associated with celiac disease. METHOD: The article describes the case of a patient suffering from chronic, treatment-resistant symptoms of depression and anxiety. The diagnosis of celiac disease and introduction of an elimination diet caused a significant improvement in mental state and everyday functioning in the presenting patient. CONCLUSION: The presence of persistent anxiety and depressive symptoms, with a poor reaction to pharmacological treatment, indicates a need to identify somatic reasons for the underlying condition. It is important to remember that celiac disease can occur at any age, not only in childhood. The presence of this somatic cause of persistent depressive and anxiety symptoms should be considered in the diagnostic process in adults.},

   abstract = {BACKGROUND: The mechanisms underlying bowel disturbances in coeliac disease are still relatively unclear. Past reports suggested that small bowel motor abnormalities may be involved in this pathological condition; there are no studies addressing small bowel transit in coeliac disease before and after a gluten-free diet. AIM: The objective of this study was to determine whether capsule endoscopy (CE) could serve as a test for measurement of gastric and small bowel transit times in a group of symptomatic or asymptomatic coeliac patients at the time of diagnosis with respect to a control group. PATIENTS AND METHODS: Thirty coeliac untreated patients and 30 age-, sex- and BMI-matched healthy controls underwent CE assessment of whole gut transit times. RESULTS: All subjects completed the study per protocol and experienced natural passage of the pill. No statistical significant differences between gastric emptying and small bowel transit times both in coeliac and control group were found (p = 0.1842 and p = 0.7134; C.I. 95%, respectively). No correlation was found in coeliac patients and control group between transit times and age, sex and BMI. By using the Pearson's correlation test, significant correlation emerged between gastric emptying time and small bowel transit times in coeliac disease (r = 0.1706). CONCLUSIONS: CE reveals unrecognized gender differences and may be a novel outpatient technique for gut transit times' assessment without exposure to radiation and for the evaluation of upper gut dysfunction in healthy patients suffering from constipation without evidence of intestinal malabsorption. Nevertheless, CE does not seem to be the most suitable method for studying gut transit times in untreated coeliac patients; this might be ascribed to the fact that CE consists of inert (non-digestible, non-absorbable) substances.},

   abstract = {AIM: The purpose of the study was to determine the characteristics of endogenous intoxication parameters, biochemical protection and reveal their interaction in children with celiac disease. MATERIALS AND METHODS: 81 children aged from 1 to 16 years with celiac disease were examined in acute and remission periods. In erythrocytes, blood serum and urine we determined low and moderate molecular weight substances (LMMWS), oligopeptides OP); in erythrocytes--the value of erythrocyte mechanical hemolysis (MH), malondialdehyde (MDA) content, the activity of glutathione reductase GR) and superoxide dismutase (SOD); in blood serum--ceruloplasmin (CP) level, alcohol dehydrogenase (ADH) activity; in erythrocytes and blood serum--glutathione transferase (GT), and calculated intoxication index (II). RESULTS: In children with celiac disease in acute and remission periods LMMWS, OP, II levels in blood were statistically significantly high, while LMMWS level in urine was low. In both periods MH activity was high (p < 0.001), and GSR (p < 0.001) and SOD (p < 0.01) levels were low. We revealed the correlation between MDA and II (r = 0.67; p = 0.006), erythrocyte LMMWS and SOD (r = -0.61; p = 0.015), erythrocyte LMMWS and ADH (r = 0.62; p = 0.006), between GT and OP in urine (r = -0.31; p = 0.026), GTand MDA (r = 0.68; p = 0.000), GT and MH (r = -0.46; p = 0.004), between MDA and CP (r = 0.57; p = 0.002) that made it possible to develop the models of dependence of the parameters in relation to each other. CONCLUSION: In celiac disease there is endogenous intoxication. The changes of the first and the second phases of biotransformation, antioxidant protection is an essential factor of the disease pathogenesis, since they have an effect on endogenous intoxication formation that should be taken into consideration in therapy.},

PATIENTS AND METHODS: The study included 35 children (age median 8.0 years) with previously diagnosed CD, among them 15 - on a strict GFD and 20 - on a semistrict GFD. 32 patients (age median 7.5 years) with functional abdominal pain were recruited as controls. Nitrites (NO(2)), nitrates (NO(3)), total content of nitrites and nitrates (NOx) in serum were determined using the Griess reaction. CD patients underwent small intestine morphometry and absorption D-xylose test. RESULTS: Compared to the controls, the CD patients on a strict GFD had no significant differences in NO(2), NO(3), NOx content, while in patients violating GFD these parameters were significantly higher. In comparison with the patients on a strict GFD, the patients on a semistrict GFD had higher median values of NO(3) (p = 0.002) and NOx (p = 0.0000). Serum NOx correlated negatively with the height of villi (p = 0.0001), D-xylose excretion (p = 0.0063), and correlated positively with the depth of crypts (p = 0.0082) and cellular density of villi stroma (p = 0.0067). CONCLUSION: CD patients not keeping to a strict GFD have an increased level of nitric oxide metabolites in serum. NOx content is associated with morphometric parameters of the small intestine that proves the participation of NO in the pathogenesis of histological changes in CD (Tab. 3, Ref. 39).},

METHODS: 71 children (47 girls and 24 boys) aged 2.5 to 16.5 (median age=10.6) with coeliac disease diagnosed according to the previously revised ESPGHAN criteria were included in the study. The patients were divided into three groups: 1 - on strict GFD, 2 - on semistrict GFD, 3 - not on GFD. Quantitative morphometric data on biopsies of duodenal mucosa in each group were compared with each other. RESULTS: As compared with group 1, patients from group 2 had a lower villous height (Vh)/crypt depth (Cd) ratio, but a higher Cd, total cell density of lamina propria, plasma cells density in the villi and fibroblasts density in the space between the crypts. In patients from group 3, as compared with group 1, we found a significant reduction in Vh and Vh/Cd ratio, and a significant decrease in the number of goblet cells. At the same time they yielded an increase in Cd, number of intraepithelial lymphocytes (IEL), total cell density and plasma cells density throughout the lamina propria depth, number of macrophages and neutrophils in the villous lamina propria, and number of fibroblasts in the space between crypts. The differences were statistically significant. CONCLUSION: Quantitative morphometric parameters of small intestine mucosa allow revealing statistically significant differences between the groups of children with coeliac disease in response to varied compliance with GFD. This enables us to assess the dynamics of the pathological process and enhance our understanding of its nature, which is very important for improving the therapy and prognosis (Ref. 40).},

METHODS: Sixty three patients with celiac disease (CD) formed the study group. They were divided into two subgroups according to their dietary compliance. Bone mineral density (BMD) values of the patients at two and five years of gluten-free diet (GFD) were determined. Findings : The relationship between BMD and compliance to GFD was found to be statistically significant (P<0.01). BMD z-scores were increased (0.12+/-0.15 and 0.10+/-0.14 units respectively) (P<0.01). The patients in group 1 and 2 had mean -1.18+/-0.83 and -2.06+/-0.73 z-scores in the first DXA. In the second DXA, these values were -1.10+/-0.73 and-1.94+/-0.93 respectively. CONCLUSION: Dietary compliance is important for bone health, and the time needed to normalize the BMD is not known. Patients with positive anti-endomysium antibody (EMA), poor dietary history and history of bone pain should be evaluated with DXA during follow-up.},

   abstract = {Emerging evidence suggests an association between food sensitivity and gut microbiota in children with nephrotic syndrome. Diminished proteinuria resulted from eliminating cow's milk and the use of an oligoantigenic diet which excluded gluten, especially in patients with immune-related conditions, i.e., celiac disease and nephrotic syndrome. The mechanisms underlying the association of diet, gut microbiota, and dysregulation of the immune system are unknown. Gut microbiota is influenced by a number of factors including diet composition and other environmental epigenetic exposures. The imbalance in gut microbiota may be ameliorated by gluten-free and dairy-free diets. Gluten-free diet increased the number of unhealthy bacteria while reducing bacterial-induced cytokine production of IL-10. Thus, gluten-free diet may influence the composition and immune function of gut microbiota and should be considered a possible environmental factor associated with immune-related disease, including nephrotic syndrome. Furthermore, the imbalance of gut microbiota may be related to the development of cow's milk protein allergy. Investigations are needed to fill the gaps in our knowledge concerning the associations between the gut microbiome, environmental exposures, epigenetics, racial influences, and the propensity for immune dysregulation with its inherent risk to the developing individual.},

This study aims to conduct a systematic review and meta-analysis to evaluate the prevalence of CD in children with cryptogenic persistent hypertransaminasemia (HTS) or autoimmune hepatitis (AIH), and vice versa. METHODS: We searched MEDLINE/PubMed, the Cochrane Library, Web of Science, and MD Consult from 1977 to May 2012 for studies reporting either CD and HTS or AIH. Pooled prevalences with 95% confidence intervals (CI) and relative risk (RR) were calculated. RESULTS: Nine studies (2046 patients) were identified. Pooled prevalences of CD in children with mild, nonspecific cryptogenic persistent HTS and vice versa were 12.0% (95% CI 4.17-29.96) and 36.0% (95% CI 32.15-40.11), respectively. A gluten-free diet normalized transaminase levels in 77% to 100% of patients with CD within 4 to 8 months. Pooled prevalences of CD in children with AIH and vice versa were 6.3% (95% CI 3.87-11.73) and 1.4% (95% CI 0.84-2.15), respectively. The RR of HTS in children with CD versus the general population, and of CD in children with HTS was 6.55 (95% CI 5.65-7.60) and 11.59 (95% CI 3.80-35.33), respectively. The corresponding RR of AIH in children with CD was 188.54 (95% CI 92.23-385.43). The RR of CD in children with AIH was 6.63 (95% CI 3.86-11.40). CONCLUSIONS: CD is associated with elevated transaminase levels in about one-third of newly diagnosed children. Cryptogenic persistent HTS may signal gluten-dependent nonspecific mild hepatitis (12.0% of cases) or more rarely (6.3%) severe CD-related autoimmune hepatopathy. RRs confirm these trends in the considered associations.},

   abstract = {Non-celiac gluten sensitivity (NCGS) is still an undefined syndrome whose triggering mechanisms remain unsettled. This study aimed to clarify how cultured peripheral blood mononucleated cells (PBMC) obtained from NCGS patients responded to contact with wheat proteins. Results demonstrated that wheat protein induced an overactivation of the proinflammatory chemokine CXCL10 in PBMC from NCGS patients, and that the overactivation level depends on the cereal source from which proteins are obtained. CXCL10 is able to decrease the transepithelial resistance of monolayers of normal colonocytes (NCM 460) by diminishing the mRNA expression of cadherin-1 (CDH1) and tight junction protein 2 (TJP2), two primary components of the tight junction strands. Thus, CXCL10 overactivation is one of the mechanisms triggered by wheat proteins in PBMC obtained from NCGS patients. This mechanism is activated to a greater extent by proteins from modern with respect to those extracted from ancient wheat genotypes.},

   abstract = {Autoimmune enteropathy (AIE) is a rare cause of small bowel villous atrophy, characterized by malabsorption, unresponsiveness to dietary restriction, circulating autoantibodies to enterocytes, and an overall predisposition to autoimmunity. Albeit mainly regarded as a disease of early childhood, several adult-onset AIE cases have been identified. This report describes for the first time the life-threatening clinical presentation and the management of overlapping AIE in a compliant-to-diet young celiac girl. A 13-year-old celiac girl was admitted because of vomiting, weight loss, diarrhea, hypoproteinemia, and neurological disturbances such as head tremors, vertical nystagmus, and lower limb hyperesthesia. Before this, she had always been compliant on a strict gluten-free diet and her medical history was unremarkable. The diagnosis of AIE was established on histologic findings and on the presence of antienterocyte antibodies. She was initially treated with high-dose Methylprednisolone and Azathioprine. However, only Infliximab proved itself as a highly effective tool for achieving clinical remission and restoring small bowel villous architecture.},

   abstract = {We studied whether celiac disease (CD) patients produce antibodies against a novel gliadin peptide specifically generated in the duodenum of CD patients by a previously described pattern of CD-specific duodenal proteases. Fingerprinting and ion-trap mass spectrometry of CD-specific duodenal gliadin-degrading protease pattern revealed a new 8-mer gliadin-derived peptide. An ELISA against synthetic deamidated 8-mer peptides (DGP 8-mer) was used to study the presence of IgA anti-DGP 8-mer antibodies in plasma samples from 81 children (31 active CD patients (aCD), 17 CD patients on a gluten-free diet (GFD), 10 healthy controls (C) and 23 patients with other gastrointestinal pathology (GP)) and 101 adults (16 aCD, 12 GFD, 27 C and 46 GP-patients). Deamidation of the 8-mer peptide significantly increased the reactivity of the IgA antibodies from CD patients against the peptide. Significant IgA anti-DGP 8-mer antibodies levels were detected in 93.5% of aCD-, 11.8% of GFD- and 4.3% of GP-patients in children. In adults, antibodies were detected in 81.3% of aCD-patients and 8.3% of GFD-patients while were absent in 100% of C- and GP-patients. Duodenal CD-specific gliadin degrading proteases release an 8-mer gliadin peptide that once deamidated is an antigen for specific IgA antibodies in CD patients which may provide a new accurate diagnostic tool in CD.},

Coeliac disease heads the list but medication-induced villous atrophy should also be taken into consideration. CASE DESCRIPTION: We report the case of a 63-year-old man presenting with recurrent secretory diarrhoea, acute renal failure and metabolic acidosis. Initial work-up revealed total villous atrophy (Marsh stage IIIC) with intraepithelial lymphocytosis. A gluten-free diet did not have any effect on the diarrhoea. During several periods of hospitalization antihypertensive medications were temporarily stopped due to dehydration; this resulted in reduction of his symptoms. Eventually an association between the enteropathy and the antihypertensive olmesartan was suspected. Indeed, permanent withdrawal of olmesartan resulted in permanent clinical improvement. CONCLUSION: Olmesartan is frequently prescribed in the Netherlands and it should be included in the differential diagnosis of diarrhoea accompanying villous atrophy.},

A number of interventions have been used to treat chylothorax including the treatment of the underlying disease. Lymphoma is found in 70% of cases with nontraumatic malignant aetiology. Although patients usually have advanced lymphoma, supradiaphragmatic disease is not always present. We discuss the case of a 63-year-old woman presenting with progressive respiratory symptoms due to chylothorax. She was diagnosed with a stage IIE retroperitoneal grade 1 follicular lymphoma extending from the coeliac trunk towards the pelvic inlet. Despite thoracocentesis and medium-chain triglycerides (MCT), diet chylothorax reoccurred. After low dose radiotherapy (2 x 2 Gy) to the abdominal lymphoma there was a marked decrease in lymphadenopathy at the coeliac trunk and a complete regression of the pleural fluid. In this case, radiotherapy was shown to be an effective nontoxic treatment option for lymphoma-associated chylothorax with long-term remission of pleural effusion.},

   abstract = {Objectives. Studies have suggested a correlation between untreated celiac disease and risk for other autoimmune diseases. We investigated the prevalence of thyroid autoimmunity in 12-year-old children (i) with symptomatic celiac disease diagnosed and treated with a gluten-free diet, (ii) with screening-detected untreated celiac disease, and (iii) without celiac disease. Methods. Blood samples from 12632 children were collected. All celiac disease cases, previously diagnosed and newly screening-detected, were identified. Per case, 4 referents were matched. Blood samples were analyzed for autoantibodies against thyroid peroxidase (TPOAb). The cut-off value for TPO positivity was set to 100 U/mL. Results. Altogether, 335 celiac disease cases were found. In the entire celiac disease group, 7.2% (24/335) had elevated titers of TPOAb compared to 2.8% (48/1695) of the referents. Among the previously diagnosed celiac disease cases, 7.5% (7/93, OR 2.8, 95% CI 1.2-6.4) was TPOAb positive and among screening-detected cases, 7.0% (17/242, OR 2.6, 95% CI 1.5-4.6) was TPOAb positive. Conclusion. Children with celiac disease showed a higher prevalence of thyroid autoimmunity. We could not confirm the hypothesis that untreated celiac disease is associated with increased risk of developing thyroid autoimmunity. Early initiation of celiac disease treatment might not lower the risk for other autoimmune diseases.},

We investigated whether dietary intake and serum levels of the essential n-3 polyunsaturated fatty acids (PUFA) eicosapentaenoic acid (EPA) and docosahexanoic acid (DHA) found in fatty fish play a role in this association. METHODS: Cross-sectional study in 71 adult CD patients and 31 healthy volunteers, matched on age, gender and level of education, who were not using n-3 PUFA supplements. Dietary intake, as assessed using a 203-item food frequency questionnaire, and serum levels of EPA and DHA were compared in analyses of covariance, adjusting for potential confounders. Serum PUFA were determined using gas chromatography. RESULTS: Mean serum DHA was significantly higher in CD patients (1.72 mass%) than controls (1.28 mass%) after multivariable adjustment (mean diff. 0.45 mass%; 95% CI: 0.22-0.68; p = 0.001). The mean intake of EPA plus DHA did not differ between CD patients and controls after multivariable adjustment (0.15 and 0.22 g/d, respectively; p = 0.10). There were no significant differences in intake or serum levels of EPA and DHA between any of the CD patient groups (never depressed, current MDD, minor/partially remitted MDD, remitted MDD) and controls. CONCLUSIONS: Patients on a long term gluten-free diet had similar intakes of EPA plus DHA compared to controls. Contrary to expectations, DHA serum levels were significantly higher in CD patients compared to healthy controls and were unrelated to MDD status.},

METHODS: A cross-sectional survey was performed in 2265 adult CD patients recruited through the Dutch Coeliac Association. Self-reported diet adherence was compared among groups based on self-reported depressive symptoms (categorized into current [1-month], remitted, and never). RESULTS: The life-time prevalence rate of self-reported depressive symptoms was 39.0% (n=883), of whom 270 (11.9%) suffered from current depressive symptoms. Adherence to gluten-free diet was strict in 50.2% of patients, sufficient in 46.3%, and insufficient in 3.6%. Insufficient adherence was not associated with current depressive symptoms (odds ratio [OR] 0.95; 95% confidence interval [CI]: 0.48-1.92). Keeping a gluten-free diet for longer than five years was associated with lower OR of current depressive symptoms compared to being on a diet for less than two years (OR 0.69; 95% CI: 0.50-0.95). CONCLUSIONS: Lifetime depressive symptoms may be present in one third of the CD patients who adhere to gluten-free diet. Long-term adherence to the gluten-free diet may reduce the risk of current depressive symptoms.},

   abstract = {BACKGROUND: Celiac disease (CD) is an intestinal inflammation driven by gluten-reactive CD4(+) T cells. Due to lack of selective markers it has not been determined whether defects in inducible regulatory T cell (Treg) differentiation are associated with CD. This is of importance as changes in numbers of induced Treg could be indicative of defects in mucosal tolerance development in CD. Recently, we have shown that, after encounter of retinoic acid during differentiation, circulating gut-imprinted T cells express CD62L(neg)CD38(+). Using this new phenotype, we now determined whether alterations occur in the frequency of natural CD62L(+)Foxp3(+) Treg or mucosally-imprinted CD62L(neg)CD38(+)Foxp3(+) Treg in peripheral blood of CD patients. In particular, we compared pediatric CD, aiming to select for disease at onset, with adult CD. METHODS: Cell surface markers, intracellular Foxp3 and Helios were determined by flow cytometry. Foxp3 expression was also detected by immunohistochemistry in duodenal tissue of CD patients. RESULTS: In children, the percentages of peripheral blood CD4(+)Foxp3(+) Treg were comparable between CD patients and healthy age-matched controls. Differentiation between natural and mucosally-imprinted Treg on the basis of CD62L and CD38 did not uncover differences in Foxp3. In adult patients on gluten-free diet and in refractory CD increased percentages of circulating natural CD62L(+)Foxp3(+) Treg, but normal mucosally-imprinted CD62L(neg)CD38(+)Foxp3(+) Treg frequencies were observed. CONCLUSIONS: Our data exclude that significant numeric deficiency of mucosally-imprinted or natural Foxp3(+) Treg explains exuberant effector responses in CD. Changes in natural Foxp3(+) Treg occur in a subset of adult patients on a gluten-free diet and in refractory CD patients.},

   abstract = {Celiac disease (CD) is caused by inflammatory CD4(+) T-cell responses to dietary gluten. It is unclear whether interleukin (IL)-21 and IL-17A contribute to CD onset and lesion severity; therefore, we investigated IL-21 and IL-17A expression in biopsies from pediatric CD patients with different histopathological scores. High numbers of IL-21-producing cells were observed in pediatric CD lesions, even Marsh 1-2 lesions, whereas increased numbers of IL-17 secreting cells were not observed. Intraepithelial lymphocytes, CD4(+) T cells and also neutrophils secreted IL-21. Flow cytometry of lamina propria cells revealed a large population of IL-21- and interferon-gamma (IFN-gamma)-secreting CD3(+) T cells that did not secrete IL-17A. Adult CD patient biopsies also contained high numbers of IL-21-positive cells; however, enhanced numbers of IL-17-positive cells were observed in a small subgroup of patients with severe lesions. As duodenal tissue damage increases contact with microbe-associated molecular patterns, we hypothesized that microbial sensing by Toll-like receptors (TLRs) modulates T cell-derived cytokine secretion. Costimulation with TLR3 ligands during polyclonal T-cell activation significantly increased IL-21 secretion, whereas TLR2 ligands selectively enhanced IL-17A. These results demonstrate that an IL-17A-independent increase in IL-21 production by CD4(+) T cells is characteristic of pediatric CD. We hypothesize that incidental IL-17 secretion is caused by tissue damage rather than gluten-specific responses.},

   abstract = {GOALS AND BACKGROUND: Discriminating between patients with nonresponsive but otherwise uncomplicated celiac disease (CD) and patients with refractory celiac disease (RCD) and/or lymphoma is difficult, especially as many abnormalities encountered in complicated CD are not within reach of conventional gastroduodenoscopy. We aimed to describe video capsule endoscopy (VCE) findings in patients with CD and persisting or relapsing symptoms despite a gluten-free diet and to identify VCE findings associated with poor prognosis. METHODS: We retrospectively analyzed 48 VCE studies performed in adult patients with CD because of persisting or relapsing symptoms despite adherence to a gluten-free diet. Patients with either uncomplicated CD or RCD type I were considered to have a good prognosis, whereas patients with either RCD type II or enteropathy-associated T-cell lymphoma were considered to have a poor prognosis. Multivariate analysis was performed to identify VCE findings independently associated with either good or poor prognosis. RESULTS: Proximal focal erythema (odds ratio, 6.7; 95% confidence interval, 1.2-38.7; P=0.033) and absence of progression of the capsule to the distal intestine (odds ratio, 16.5; 95% confidence interval, 1.2-224.9; P=0.035) were independently associated with poor prognosis. Of the 28 patients with none of these 2 features, none died during follow-up, compared with 2 (13.3%) of the 15 patients with one of both features, and 4 (80.0%) of the 5 patients with both the features. CONCLUSIONS: VCE is a minimally invasive endoscopic modality that could be of use in identifying patients with nonresponsive CD who are at risk of poor prognosis.},

   abstract = {Celiac disease, which mainly affects the small intestine, is the only systemic autoimmune disorder with an identified environmental trigger which is dietary gluten. Lifelong adherence to a strict gluten free diet (GFD) is currently the only accepted treatment. Celiac disease is increasingly diagnosed and the GFD is known to be associated with a large treatment burden. Furthermore, a substantial number of celiac disease patients show an incomplete clinical response to the GFD. These factors have led to demands for the development and testing of novel, non-dietary, therapeutic agents that are both safe and effective. Celiac disease pathogenesis is well elucidated which has greatly aided targeted drug development. Compounds currently being tested in phase II clinical trials include glutenase enzymes (to detoxify gluten) and a tight junction modulator (to reduce access of gluten peptides to lamina propria antigen presenting cells). Other promising approaches include inhibition of the transglutaminase 2 enzyme, blocking antigen presentation by HLA-DQ2 or HLA-DQ8, induction of tolerance, and modulation of the inflammatory response. It is hoped that non-dietary therapy for celiac disease will become available in the coming years and can both reduce the burden of treatment of celiac disease and help patients whose symptoms do not respond completely to the GFD.},

   abstract = {BACKGROUND: Serological markers of coeliac disease (CD) lack diagnostic value to identify mild histopathological lesions mainly in adults at risk of CD. AIMS: The aim of this study was to evaluate the usefulness of human leukocyte antigen (HLA)-DQ2/8 genotyping, followed by duodenal biopsy for the detection of CD in adult first-degree relatives (FDRs) of patients with CD. MATERIALS AND METHODS: Ninety-two adult DQ2/8 positive FDRs were consecutively included. A duodenal biopsy was offered irrespective of the serology result or associated symptoms. The clinical features, associated autoimmune diseases and biochemical parameters were recorded. RESULTS: Sixty-seven FDRs (mean age 34 years) underwent a duodenal biopsy. Histopathological alterations were found in 32 (48%) and showed the following stages: 12 Marsh I (18%), one Marsh II (1.5%), four Marsh IIIA (6%), five Marsh IIIB (7.5%) and 10 Marsh IIIC (15%). Positive serological markers were present in 17/67 (25%), with only one showing Marsh I and the remainder presenting some degree of duodenal atrophy (Marsh III). In addition, 33/67 (54%) had gastrointestinal symptoms, with dyspepsia being the most prevalent. The distribution of symptoms, anaemia and autoimmune disease was independent of the duodenal histopathological stage. Serology-based screening would diagnose 50% of the cases showing any degree of CD spectrum and miss 6% of the cases with mucosal atrophy. CONCLUSION: Adult FDRs of patients with CD can benefit from a screening strategy on the basis of HLA-DQ genotyping, followed by a duodenal biopsy. Gastrointestinal symptoms and lymphocytic enteritis are common findings that may benefit from a gluten-free diet.},

The authors present a case of a 43-year-old woman with long-standing NSAID use for autoimmune polyarthropathy and positive coeliac antibodies. However, distal duodenal biopsies revealed a thickened band of subepithelial collagen with villous atrophic appearances consistent with collagenous sprue. The patient was treated with a gluten-free diet and her NSAIDs were discontinued. After 6 months, her gastrointestinal symptoms had resolved with complete histological resolution of the collagenous subepithelial bands and villous atrophy on duodenal biopsy.},

   abstract = {BACKGROUND: In diagnosing celiac disease (CD), serological tests are highly valuable. However, their role in following up children with CD after prescription of a gluten-free diet is unclear. This study aimed to compare the performance of antibody tests in predicting small-intestinal mucosal status in diagnosis vs. follow-up of pediatric CD. METHODS: We conducted a prospective cohort study at a tertiary-care center. 148 children underwent esophohagogastroduodenoscopy with biopsies either for symptoms +/- positive CD antibodies (group A; n = 95) or following up CD diagnosed >/= 1 year before study enrollment (group B; n = 53). Using biopsy (Marsh >/= 2) as the criterion standard, areas under ROC curves (AUCs) and likelihood-ratios were calculated to estimate the performance of antibody tests against tissue transglutaminase (TG2), deamidated gliadin peptide (DGP) and endomysium (EMA). RESULTS: AUCs were higher when tests were used for CD diagnosis vs. follow-up: 1 vs. 0.86 (P = 0.100) for TG2-IgA, 0.85 vs. 0.74 (P = 0.421) for TG2-IgG, 0.97 vs. 0.61 (P = 0.004) for DPG-IgA, and 0.99 vs. 0.88 (P = 0.053) for DPG-IgG, respectively. Empirical power was 85% for the DPG-IgA comparison, and on average 33% (range 13-43) for the non-significant comparisons. Among group B children, 88.7% showed mucosal healing (median 2.2 years after primary diagnosis). Only the negative likelihood-ratio of EMA was low enough (0.097) to effectively rule out persistent mucosal injury. However, out of 12 EMA-positive children with mucosal healing, 9 subsequently turned EMA-negative. CONCLUSIONS: Among the CD antibodies examined, negative EMA most reliably predict mucosal healing. In general, however, antibody tests, especially DPG-IgA, are of limited value in predicting the mucosal status in the early years post-diagnosis but may be sufficient after a longer period of time.},

This article examines how dietary restrictions are treated by patients and their families. Data from recorded mealtime conversations of seven Dutch families with children suffering from coeliac disease were analysed using discursive psychology. We found two main discursive strategies by which patients and their families manage the diet during mealtime interactions. A reference to pleasure is used to manage the tension between the child's agency and parental responsibility in the face of health requirements and, by softening the denial of food, the diet is normalised and treated as a shared family practice. The analysis shows that the gluten-free diet is demedicalised and treated as a matter of choice rather than prescription. We conclude with the practical implications of these findings.},

   abstract = {OBJECTIVES: Gastrointestinal manifestations are frequent in patients with common variable immunodeficiency (CVID), and some of the patients present with celiac-like features. Diagnosing celiac disease (CD) in CVID however is challenging, as autoantibody detection and histopathology of the small intestine cannot reliably discriminate between classic CD and a celiac-like disease in these individuals. For the development of classic gluten-sensitive CD a certain HLA haplotype involving the loci DQA1* and DQB1* and encoding two different HLA DQ heterodimers is the prerequisite. We aimed to determine the frequency of these haplotypes in CVID patients with suspected CD. Furthermore, we report on autoimmune manifestations and the lymphocyte phenotype in these patients. METHODS: By retrospective analysis data on gastrointestinal symptoms, diet, concurrent autoimmune diseases, and routine laboratory values were collected. CVID patients were classified according to their B-cell phenotype. Expression of HLA-DQA1* and HLA-DQB1* alleles were determined by genetic analysis. RESULTS: Twenty out of 250 CVID patients presented with a clinical phenotype resembling celiac disease. Four (20%) out of these CVID patients carried the CD-associated HLA DQ2.5 or DQ8 heterodimer, while HLA DQ2.5 was present in 100% of a CD control cohort. Gluten-free diet (GFD) resulted in a clinical and histological response in two out of four patients with HLA high-risk alleles for CD. The response could not be assessed in the remaining two patients, as these patients did not adhere sufficiently long to GFD. The percentage of autoimmune manifestations other than CD was high (50%) in CVID patients presenting with a CD-like enteropathy, and most of these patients had an expansion of B-cells with low expression of CD21 (CD21low B-cells). CONCLUSIONS: In CVID patients with suspected celiac disease typing of the HLA loci DQA1 and DQB1 can help to identify those that have a genetic susceptibility for CD. In CVID patients with a celiac-like phenotype but negative for CD-associated HLA-DQ markers, an autoimmune enteropathy (AIE) as part of an extended autoimmune dysregulation needs to be considered. This has important implications for further diagnostics and therapy of these patients.},

The diagnosis requires serologic testing and a duodenal biopsy that shows the characteristic findings of intraepithelial lymphocytosis, crypt hyperplasia and villous atrophy, and a positive response to a gluten-free diet. In most patients, the histological diagnosis is easily established. Pitfalls in the pathological diagnosis include a poorly orientated biopsy specimen, either an inadequate biopsy sampling in patients with patchy villous atrophy and the other causes of villous atrophy. A non-response to the gluten-free diet needs to reassess first, the initial diagnosis, second to be sure of the gluten-free diet adherence, and third, to exclude malignant complications such as refractory celiac disease or enteropathy-associated T-cell lymphoma.},

   abstract = {BACKGROUND & AIMS: Osteopenia and increased risk for fractures in IBD result from several factors. AIM OF THE STUDY: To investigate the dietary intake of calcium in IBD patients. METHODS: A 22-item quantitative validated frequency food questionnaire was used for quantifying dietary calcium in relation to gender and age, in 187 IBD patients, 420 normal- and 276 diseased controls. STATISTICAL ANALYSIS: Mann-Whitney, chi-square- and T-tests. RESULTS: The mean calcium intake was 991.0 +/- 536.0 (105.8% Recommended Daily Allowances) and 867.6 +/- 562.7 SD mg/day (93.8% RDA) in healthy and diseased controls, and 837.8 +/- 482.0 SD mg/day (92.7% RDA) in IBD, P<0.001. Calcium intake was high in celiac disease (1165.7 +/- 798.8 SD mg/day, 120% RDA), and non-significantly lower in ulcerative colitis than in Crohn's disease (798.7 +/- 544.1 SD mg/day vs 881.9 +/- 433.0). CD and UC females, but not males, had a mean calcium intake well under RDA. In all study groups the intake was lower in patients believing that consumption of lactose-containing food induced symptoms, versus those who did not (105.8% vs 114.3% RDA in normal controls; 100.4% vs 87.6% RDA in IBD). CONCLUSIONS: Diet in IBD patients contained significantly less calcium than in healthy controls. Gender and age, more than diagnosis, are central in determining inadequate calcium intake, more so in IBD. Self-reported lactose intolerance, leading to dietary restrictions, is the single major determinant of low calcium intake. Inadequate calcium intake is present in one third of IBD patients and represents a reversible risk factor for osteoporosis, suggesting the need for tailored nutritional advice in IBD.},

   abstract = {BACKGROUND: Individuals with coeliac disease (CD) and those with noncoeliac gluten sensitivity (GS) have reported difficulty following a gluten-free diet (GFD); however, few studies have explored the link between the food label, gluten-free (GF) claims and the difficulty associated with following a GFD. METHODS: The present study surveyed adults with CD (n = 1,583) and adults with GS (n = 797) about their reported difficulty following a GFD, including assessing the role of food labels and GF claims, as well as other factors known to contribute to this difficulty. A two-sample t-test and chi-squared tests for equality of means or proportions were used for the descriptive data and ordinal logistic regression (OLR) was used to model associations. RESULTS: On average, individuals with GS reported slightly more difficulty following the GFD than did participants with CD. According to the OLR results, reading the food label often was significantly associated with less reported difficulty following a GFD, whereas consuming packaged processed foods and looking for GF claims more often were significantly associated with more reported difficulty for both respondent groups. CONCLUSIONS: Individuals with GS may rely more heavily on the GF claim for information about a product's gluten content. Individuals with CD, on the other hand, may be more experienced food label readers and may rely more on the ingredient list for finding GF foods. More studies are needed aiming to understand the role of the food label in facilitating consumers' ability to follow a GFD.},

   abstract = {Steady advances in our knowledge of the composition and function of the human microbiome at multiple body sites including the gut, skin and airways will likely contribute to our understanding of mechanisms of probiotic action by beneficial microbes. Microbe:microbe and microbe:human interactions are important considerations as we select probiotics for pediatric patients in the future. Although our knowledge about the composition of the microbiome is progressing rapidly, many gaps exist about the functional capacity and metabolic machinery of the human microbiome. Based on a limited amount of data, probiotics appear capable of altering the composition and function of the microbiome. Probiotics may be part of dietary strategies that combine ways to enhance microbiome function with nutrients that may be converted to active compounds promoting human health. Probiotics have yielded beneficial effects in numerous studies in the context of different diseases in pediatric gastroenterology. These disease states include necrotizing enterocolitis, antibiotic-associated diarrhea and colitis, acute gastroenteritis and irritable bowel syndrome. In the skin and airways, it is unclear if probiotics can affect the function of the microbiome to reduce the impact of diseases such as asthma and atopic dermatitis. An enhanced understanding of the effects of probiotics on the microbiome should facilitate selection of optimal probiotic strains for specific diseases in the future.},

   abstract = {BACKGROUND AND GOALS: Seroreactivity against the Saccharomyces cerevisiae (ASCA), Pseudomonas fluorescens-associated sequence (I2), and Bacteroides caccae TonB-linked outer membrane protein (OmpW) has been detected in celiac disease patients with small-bowel mucosal atrophy. Levels of these antibodies decrease during a gluten-free diet, but their functions and time of appearance in celiac disease are not known. We aimed to search for evidence of possible microbial targets of the immune responses in the early-stage celiac disease patients who showed normal small-bowel mucosal architecture at the time of the first investigations, but later on a gluten-containing diet developed mucosal atrophy. MATERIALS AND METHODS: Forty-four cases with proven early-stage celiac disease and normal mucosal morphology were enrolled. Patients' sera were tested for celiac disease antibodies against tissue transglutaminase (tTG-ab), endomysium, and for microbial antibodies against I2, OmpW, and ASCA IgG and IgA isotypes in both at the time of diagnosis and while on a gluten-free diet. RESULTS: Thirty-four (77%) of 44 patients with early-stage celiac disease had elevated serum antibodies to one or more of the antibodies ASCA, I2, and OmpW. Furthermore, 5 of 6 cases negative for both tTG-ab and endomysium showed positivity for the microbial markers. Seroreactivity to ASCA IgA, ASCA IgG, and OmpW decreased significantly during gluten-free diet. CONCLUSIONS: Seroreactivity to different microbial antigens is evident already in patients with early-stage celiac disease. ASCA antibodies seem to be gluten-dependent. The results indicate that the microbial targets might have a role in the early development of celiac disease.},

Before looking for hepatic or genetic rare diseases, it is worth considering hypertransaminasemia as a clue for muscular disease, particularly in paediatric settings, and creatine phosphokinase is a specific marker. Then, patient history, examination and appropriate biologic requests can permit the identification of less frequent disorders where isolated hypertransaminasemia is possibly the unique marker of the disease for a long while: hemochromatosis, celiac disease, autoimmune hepatitis, Wilson's disease, alpha1-anti-trypsine deficiency, thyroid dysfunctions, Addison's disease. Liver biopsy should be performed only in patients with aspartate aminotransferases upper the normal range or alanine aminotransferases higher than twice the normal range after 6 months delay with dietetic corrections.},

   abstract = {Celiac disease (CD) is an autoimmune disorder, which damages the small intestine and is caused by ingestion of gluten in genetically susceptible individuals. The only known effective treatment is a lifelong gluten-free diet. Genetic risk factors have been identified and nearly all patients are HLA-DQ2 and/or HLA-DQ8 positive. Specific autoantibodies, IgA antitissue transglutaminase-2, antiendomysium, and antideaminated forms of gliadin peptide antibodies, are widely used as diagnostic aids in celiac patients. However, the discovery of new biomarkers may help in the diagnosis and follow-up of the disease. Recently, the molecule REG Ialpha, involved in tissue regeneration, has been proposed as a new biomarker of CD. REG Ialpha expression is increased in the target tissue and in the sera of celiac patients during damage and inflammation, decreasing after gluten-free diet. In this article we review the main biomarkers for diagnosis and monitoring of CD, focusing on the immune response-related mechanisms.},

Drainage of the mesenteric blood supply to the portal vein permits absorbed and/or translocated nutrients, toxins, bacterial elements, cytokines, and immunocytes to gain hepatic access. Liver problems in digestive disorders may range from nonspecific hepatocellular enzyme elevations to significant pathologic processes that may progress to end-stage liver disease. Hepatobiliary manifestations of primary GI diseases in childhood and adolescence are not uncommon and include several well-described associations, such as sclerosing cholangitis with inflammatory bowel disease. Liver damage may also result from the effects of drugs used to treat GI diseases, for example, the hepatotoxicity of immunomodulatory therapies. This review highlights the important features of the hepatic and biliary abnormalities associated with 3 common pediatric GI conditions: inflammatory bowel disease, celiac disease, and cystic fibrosis.},

   abstract = {Celiac disease (CD) and nonceliac gluten sensitivity (NCGS) are two distinct conditions triggered by the ingestion of gliadin. Although symptoms of nonceliac gluten sensitivity may resemble those of celiac disease, due to the lack of objective diagnostic tests, NCGS is associated with overlapping symptomatologies of autoimmunities and Crohn's disease. Furthermore, a gluten-free diet is only recommended for those who meet the criteria for a diagnosis of CD. Unfortunately, that leaves many nonceliac gluten-sensitive people suffering unnecessarily from very serious symptoms that put them at risk for complications of autoimmune disorders that might be resolved with a gluten-free diet. Thus, a new paradigm is needed for aid in diagnosing and distinguishing among various gut-related diseases, including CD, NCGS (also known as silent celiac disease), and gut-related autoimmunities. Herein, we report three different cases: the first, an elderly patient with celiac disease which was diagnosed based on signs and symptoms of malabsorption and by a proper lab test; second, a case of NCGS which was initially misdiagnosed as lupus but was detected as NCGS by a proper lab test with its associated autoimmunities, including gluten ataxia and neuromyelitis optica; third, a patient with NCGS overlapping with Crohn's disease. The symptomatologies of all three patients improved significantly after 12 months of gluten-free diet plus other modalities.},

We carried out a prospective survey on NCGS in Italian centers for the diagnosis of gluten-related disorders, with the aim of defining the clinical picture of this new syndrome and to establish roughly its prevalence compared with celiac disease. METHODS: From November 2012 to October 2013, 38 Italian centers (27 adult gastroenterology, 5 internal medicine, 4 pediatrics, and 2 allergy) participated in this prospective survey. A questionnaire was used in order to allow uniform and accurate collection of clinical, biochemical, and instrumental data. RESULTS: In total, 486 patients with suspected NCGS were identified in this 1-year period. The female/male ratio was 5.4 to 1, and the mean age was 38 years (range 3-81). The clinical picture was characterized by combined gastrointestinal (abdominal pain, bloating, diarrhea and/or constipation, nausea, epigastric pain, gastroesophageal reflux, aphthous stomatitis) and systemic manifestations (tiredness, headache, fibromyalgia-like joint/muscle pain, leg or arm numbness, 'foggy mind,' dermatitis or skin rash, depression, anxiety, and anemia). In the large majority of patients, the time lapse between gluten ingestion and the appearance of symptoms varied from a few hours to 1 day. The most frequent associated disorders were irritable bowel syndrome (47%), food intolerance (35%) and IgE-mediated allergy (22%). An associated autoimmune disease was detected in 14% of cases. Regarding family history, 18% of our patients had a relative with celiac disease, but no correlation was found between NCGS and positivity for HLA-DQ2/-DQ8. IgG anti-gliadin antibodies were detected in 25% of the patients tested. Only a proportion of patients underwent duodenal biopsy; for those that did, the biopsies showed normal intestinal mucosa (69%) or mild increase in intraepithelial lymphocytes (31%). The ratio between suspected NCGS and new CD diagnoses, assessed in 28 of the participating centers, was 1.15 to 1. CONCLUSIONS: This prospective survey shows that NCGS has a strong correlation with female gender and adult age. Based on our results, the prevalence of NCGS seems to be only slightly higher than that of celiac disease.},

   abstract = {BACKGROUND: Celiac disease is a multiform, challenging condition characterized by extremely variable features. Our goal was to define clinical, serological and histopathological findings in a large cohort of celiacs diagnosed in a single referral center. METHODS: From January 1998 to December 2012, 770 patients (599 females, median age 36 years, range 18-78 years) were diagnosed as celiacs at St. Orsola-Malpighi Hospital (Bologna, Italy). The clinical phenotypes were classified as: 1) classical (malabsorption syndrome); 2) non-classical (extraintestinal and/or gastrointestinal symptoms other than diarrhea); 3) subclinical. Serology, duodenal histology, comorbidities, response to gluten-free diet and complications were evaluated. RESULTS: Disease onset was symptomatic in 610 patients (79%), while 160 celiacs showed a subclinical phenotype. In the symptomatic group the non-classical prevailed over the classical phenotype (66% vs 34%). Diarrhea was found in 27%, while other gastrointestinal manifestations were bloating (20%), aphthous stomatitis (18%), alternating bowel habit (15%), constipation (13%) and gastroesophageal reflux disease (12%). Extraintestinal manifestations included osteopenia/osteoporosis (52%), anemia (34%), cryptogenic hypertransaminasemia (29%) and recurrent miscarriages (12%). Positivity for IgA tissue transglutaminase antibodies was detected in 97%. Villous atrophy was found in 87%, while 13% had minor lesions consistent with potential celiac disease. A large proportion of patients showed autoimmune disorders, i.e. autoimmune thyroiditis (26.3%), dermatitis herpetiformis (4%) and diabetes mellitus type 1 (3%). Complicated celiac disease was very rare. CONCLUSIONS: Our study demonstrates that the clinical profile of celiac disease changed over time with an increasing rate of non-classical and subclinical phenotypes.},

   abstract = {Recently, the increasing number of patients worldwide who are sensitive to dietary gluten without evidence of celiac disease or wheat allergy has contributed to the identification of a new gluten-related syndrome defined as non-celiac gluten sensitivity. Our knowledge regarding this syndrome is still lacking, and many aspects of this syndrome remain unknown. Its pathogenesis is heterogeneous, with a recognized pivotal role for innate immunity; many other factors also contribute, including low-grade intestinal inflammation, increased intestinal barrier function and changes in the intestinal microbiota. Gluten and other wheat proteins, such as amylase trypsin inhibitors, are the primary triggers of this syndrome, but it has also been hypothesized that a diet rich in fermentable monosaccharides and polyols may elicit its functional gastrointestinal symptoms. The epidemiology of this condition is far from established; its prevalence in the general population is highly variable, ranging from 0.63% to 6%. From a clinical point of view, non-celiac gluten sensitivity is characterized by a wide array of gastrointestinal and extraintestinal symptoms that occur shortly after the ingestion of gluten and improve or disappear when gluten is withdrawn from the diet. These symptoms recur when gluten is reintroduced. Because diagnostic biomarkers have not yet been identified, a double-blind placebo-controlled gluten challenge is currently the diagnostic method with the highest accuracy. Future research is needed to generate more knowledge regarding non-celiac gluten sensitivity, a condition that has global acceptance but has only a few certainties and many unresolved issues.},

This condition can also affect many extraintestinal tissues, including the liver. We report a patient presenting with a marked increase of transaminases at diagnosis of CD. The immune markers for autoimmune hepatitis (AIH) were negative. Following a few months of a strict gluten-free diet (GFD), aminotransferase levels decreased significantly (< 2.5x U/L). The response to GFD suggested that the liver damage was due to a gluten-dependent celiac hepatitis, the most common liver abnormality in CD. Despite the fact that the patient never stopped the GFD, yet, in a few months, the aminotransferase levels raise again to high values (> 50x U/L). At this time, the liver autoantibodies turned to be positive thus confirming the development of a type 1 AIH. The hepatic damage progressed to a late onset liver failure requiring liver transplantation.},

   abstract = {OBJECTIVE: Celiac disease (CD) has strongly been established as associated with some site-specific gastrointestinal malignancies. On the contrary, according to the few reports available, the risk of colon carcinoma in CD patients has been described similar to that of general population. In this cohort study, we describe the risk of colon carcinoma in a group of Italian celiac patients. MATERIALS AND METHODS: The study population included all CD patients diagnosed at the Collaborating Centers of the Italian Registry of CD between 1st January 1982 and 31st December 2006. Upon diagnosis of CD and upon at every subsequent clinical control, the Collaborating Centers filled in a validated form for each CD patient reporting information about demographic data, possible occurrence of a neoplasm and adherence to a gluten-free diet. RESULTS: Out of 1757 celiac patients enrolled, 6 developed a colon carcinoma during the follow-up period (mean: 18.1 years). The standardized incidence ratio (SIR) resulted 0.29 (95% CI=0.07-0.45). Stratifying the risk for the dietary gluten intake, the SIR dropped to 0.07 (95% CI=0.009-0.27) for CD patients with a strict adherence to a gluten-free diet. CONCLUSION: We confirm the previous finding that there is low risk to develop a colon cancer in celiac patients.},

   abstract = {Recently, it has been suggested that the gene called Parkinson's disease 7 (PARK7) might be an upstream activator of hypoxia-inducible factor (HIF)-1alpha, which plays a major role in sustaining intestinal barrier integrity. Furthermore, PARK7 has been proposed to participate in the Toll-like receptor (TLR)-dependent regulation of the innate immune system. Our aim was to investigate the involvement of PARK7 in the pathogenesis of coeliac disease (CD). Duodenal biopsy specimens were collected from 19 children with untreated CD, five children with treated CD (maintained on gluten-free diet), and ten children with histologically normal duodenal biopsies. PARK7 mRNA expression and protein level were determined by real-time polymerase chain reaction (PCR) and Western blot, respectively. Localization of PARK7 was visualized by immunofluorescence staining. Protein level of PARK7 increased in the duodenal mucosa of children with untreated CD compared to children with treated CD or to control biopsies (p <0.03). We detected intensive PARK7 staining in the epithelial cells and lamina propria of the duodenal mucosa of children with untreated CD compared with that in control biopsies. Our finding that mucosal expression of PARK7 is increased suggests that PARK7 is involved in the pathogenesis of gastrointestinal diseases, notably CD. Our results suggest that PARK7 may alter processes mediated by HIF-1alpha and TLR4, which supports a role for PARK7 in the maintenance of epithelial barrier integrity, immune homeostasis, or apoptosis.},

   abstract = {BACKGROUND: A window of opportunity has been suggested for reducing the risk of celiac disease by introducing gluten to infants at 4 to 6 months of age. METHODS: We performed a multicenter, randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled dietary-intervention study involving 944 children who were positive for HLA-DQ2 or HLA-DQ8 and had at least one first-degree relative with celiac disease. From 16 to 24 weeks of age, 475 participants received 100 mg of immunologically active gluten daily, and 469 received placebo. Anti-transglutaminase type 2 and antigliadin antibodies were periodically measured. The primary outcome was the frequency of biopsy-confirmed celiac disease at 3 years of age. RESULTS: Celiac disease was confirmed by means of biopsies in 77 children. To avoid underestimation of the frequency of celiac disease, 3 additional children who received a diagnosis of celiac disease according to the 2012 European Society for Pediatric Gastroenterology, Hepatology, and Nutrition diagnostic criteria (without having undergone biopsies) were included in the analyses (80 children; median age, 2.8 years; 59% were girls). The cumulative incidence of celiac disease among patients 3 years of age was 5.2% (95% confidence interval [CI], 3.6 to 6.8), with similar rates in the gluten group and the placebo group (5.9% [95% CI, 3.7 to 8.1] and 4.5% [95% CI, 2.5 to 6.5], respectively; hazard ratio in the gluten group, 1.23; 95% CI, 0.79 to 1.91). Rates of elevated levels of anti-transglutaminase type 2 and antigliadin antibodies were also similar in the two study groups (7.0% [95% CI, 4.7 to 9.4] in the gluten group and 5.7% [95% CI, 3.5 to 7.9] in the placebo group; hazard ratio, 1.14; 95% CI, 0.76 to 1.73). Breast-feeding, regardless of whether it was exclusive or whether it was ongoing during gluten introduction, did not significantly influence the development of celiac disease or the effect of the intervention. CONCLUSIONS: As compared with placebo, the introduction of small quantities of gluten at 16 to 24 weeks of age did not reduce the risk of celiac disease by 3 years of age in this group of high-risk children.

   abstract = {In a recently published article in Pediatrics on the Swedish coeliac disease 'epidemic', it is suggested that the gradual introduction of gluten-containing foods from 4 months of age, preferably while breastfeeding is still ongoing, is favourable for the prevention of coeliac disease. This stirred up the discussion about the timing of introduction of gluten to the diet of infants in the Netherlands, where gluten-containing foods are mostly introduced from 6 months of age onwards. The retrospective character of data collection, however, has to be taken into account when interpreting the Swedish study. Future results of prospective studies on gluten introduction and coeliac disease, such as the PreventCD family study (www.preventcd.com), should provide the information necessary for deciding on a change in the Dutch guidelines for the introduction of gluten to the diet of young children.},

   abstract = {OBJECTIVES: A significant fraction of celiac disease patients suffer from persistent symptoms despite a long-term gluten-free diet (GFD) and normalized small bowel mucosa. The commonly suggested reasons, such as inadvertent gluten-intake or presence of other gastrointestinal disease, do not explain the symptoms in all these patients. Recently, alterations in intestinal microbiota have been associated with autoimmune disorders, including celiac disease. This led us to test a hypothesis that abnormal intestinal microbiota may be associated with persisting gastrointestinal symptoms in treated celiac disease patients. METHODS: Duodenal microbiota was analyzed in 18 GFD-treated patients suffering from persistent symptoms and 18 treated patients without symptoms by 16S rRNA gene pyrosequencing. The celiac disease patients had been following a strict GFD for several years and had restored small bowel mucosa and negative celiac autoantibodies. Their symptoms on GFD were assessed with Gastrointestinal Symptom Rating Scale. RESULTS: The results of several clustering methods showed that the treated celiac disease patients with persistent symptoms were colonized by different duodenal microbiota in comparison with patients without symptoms. The treated patients with persistent symptoms had a higher relative abundance of Proteobacteria (P=0.04) and a lower abundance of Bacteroidetes (P=0.01) and Firmicutes (P=0.05). Moreover, their microbial richness was reduced. The results indicated intestinal dysbiosis in patients with persistent symptoms even while adhering to a strict GFD. CONCLUSIONS: Our findings indicate that dysbiosis of microbiota is associated with persistent gastrointestinal symptoms in treated celiac disease patients and open new possibilities to treat this subgroup of patients.},

Our aim was (1) to estimate the prevalence of CD in cirrhosis, (2) to characterize cirrhotic patients with abnormal celiac serology and normal small bowel biopsy and (3) to evaluate the effect of a GFD on the liver. METHODS: A total of 204 consecutive patients with biopsy proven cirrhosis scheduled for an upper endoscopy (EGD) to assess and treat gastro-esophageal varices (GEV) at the Cleveland Clinic between 5/1/2008 and 5/30/2010 were enrolled in the study and followed for 2 years. RESULTS: CD affects 2.5% of cirrhotic patients and more than twice the prevalence in the general population. Abnormal EMA >1/10 and high hTTG levels >20 IU can be used to diagnose CD in cirrhosis. Sensitivities and specificities are 100% for EMA and 80% and 94% for hTTG, respectively. After a GFD, patients with CD showed a return to normal levels of their celiac serology, small bowel biopsy and liver enzyme abnormalities. CONCLUSIONS: CD is at least twice more common in cirrhotic patients than in the general population and GFD improves liver tests. CD can occur coincidentally with other liver disorders and screening may be warranted during the evaluation of patients with cirrhosis. Abnormal EMA and high hTTG levels can be used to diagnose CD in cirrhosis.},

   abstract = {The paradigm of disease burden in the developed world has changed drastically in the last few decades from predominately infections to immune-mediated diseases (autoimmunity and allergy) because of alterations in the Western lifestyle (improved sanitation, immunizations, antibiotic usage and altered dietary intake). A diverse balanced microbiota is necessary for the development of an appropriate innate and adaptive immune response. There is strong evidence that disruption of the normal colonization process can lead to alterations in the important symbiotic relationship that is necessary for immune homeostasis. For example, infants born by cesarean section or receiving excessive perinatal antibiotics have inadequate initial colonization and aberrant mucosal immune function. As a result, later in childhood, they express an increased incidence in asthma and autoimmune diseases (e.g. celiac disease). An important component of initial colonization is the infant's diet. Breast milk contains a variety of nondigestible oligosaccharides which function as prebiotics preferentially stimulating proliferation of Bifidobacteria and Lactobacilli, important health-promoting bacteria, and cause fermentation of the oligosaccharides into short-chain fatty acids. In the absence of breastfeeding for the first 6 months of life, formula containing pre- and probiotics may overcome an initial inadequate colonization process and help establish a normal mucosal immune system.},

   abstract = {OBJECTIVE: To screen the prevalence of celiac disease with serologic markers in the central Chinese population, specifically in patients with chronic diarrhea-predominant irritable bowel syndrome (D-IBS). METHODS: A total of 282 adult patients with D-IBS were selected based on ROME III criteria with 296 age and sex matched consecutive healthy individuals as controls. A gluten-free diet (GFD) was advised in subjects positive for IgA/IgG anti-htTG/DGP antibodies and the serologic antibodies were retested after the GFD. RESULTS: Among the 578 study subjects, five D-IBS patients (5/282, 1.77%) and two healthy controls (2/296, 0.68%) were positive for anti-htTG/DGP antibodies. Among the seven positive cases, one was lost to follow-up and only four were evaluated during GFD therapy for an average of 5.2 months with clinical and/or serological manifestations improved. CONCLUSIONS: The prevalence of celiac disease may not be uncommon in China. Compared with the healthy population, patients with D-IBS tend to be affected more. Thus, it is significantly important to conduct routine screening for celiac disease in patients with D-IBS.},

   abstract = {PURPOSE: Selective immunoglobulin A deficiency is the most common primary immunodeficiency disorder that is strongly overrepresented among patients with celiac disease (CD). IgG antibodies against tissue transglutaminase (tTG) and deamidated gliadin peptides (DGP) serve as serological markers for CD in IgA deficient individuals, although the diagnostic value remains uncertain. The aim of this study was to investigate the prevalence of these markers in a large cohort of IgA deficient adults with confirmed or suspected CD and relate the findings to gluten free diet. METHODS: Sera from 488,156 individuals were screened for CD in seven Swedish clinical immunology laboratories between 1998 and 2012. In total, 356 out of 1,414 identified IgA deficient adults agreed to participate in this study and were resampled. Forty-seven IgA deficient blood donors served as controls. Analyses of IgG antibodies against tTG and DGP as well as HLA typing were performed and a questionnaire was used to investigate adherence to gluten free diet. Available biopsy results were collected. RESULTS: Out of the 356 IgA deficient resampled adults, 67 (18.8%) were positive for IgG anti-tTG and 79 (22.2%) for IgG anti-DGP, 54 had biopsy confirmed CD. Among the 47 IgA deficient blood donors, 4 (9%) were positive for IgG anti-tTG and 8 (17%) for anti-DGP. Four were diagnosed with biopsy verified CD, however, 2 of the patients were negative for all markers. Sixty-eight of 69 individuals with positive IgG anti-tTG were HLA-DQ2/DQ8 positive whereas 7 (18.9%) of the 37 individuals positive for IgG anti-DGP alone were not. CONCLUSIONS: IgG anti-tTG seems to be a more reliable marker for CD in IgA deficient adults whereas the diagnostic specificity of anti-DGP appears to be lower. High levels of IgG antibodies against tTG and DGP were frequently found in IgA deficient adults despite adhering to gluten free diet.},

Here, we investigated the gastrointestinal site(s) of action which controls meal size (MS) (normal rat chow) and intermeal interval length (IMI) by the mammalian homologues of Bn gastrin releasing peptides (GRP-10, GRP-27 and GRP-29, 0.01, 0.05, 0.1, 0.2 and 0.5 nmol/kg) infused in the CA, the cranial mesenteric artery (CMA, supplying the small and large intestine), the femoral artery (FA, control) and the portal vein (PV, draining the gastrointestinal tract, control) in freely fed rats immediately prior to the onset of the dark cycle. We found that (1) GRP-29 (0.05, 0.1, 0.2 and 0.5 nmol/kg) and GRP-27 (0.2 and 0.5 nmol/kg) in the CA and GRP-29 (0.5 nmol/kg) in the CMA reduced the MS relative to saline, (2) GRP-29 (0.1, 0.2 and 0.5 nmol/kg) and GRP-27 (0.2 and 0.5 nmol/kg) in the CA prolonged the IMI, (3) GRP-29 (0.1, 0.2 and 0.5 nmol/kg) in the CA and GRP-29 (0.5 nmol/kg) in the CMA increased the satiety ratio (SR, IMI/MS - the amount of food consumed per a given unit of time) and (4) neither peptide nor route showed any effect on the second MS. These results support an upper gastrointestinal site of action for MS and IMI length by GRP-27 and GRP-29, which is most likely the stomach and/or the duodenum.},

   abstract = {BACKGROUND: Although the incidence of inflammatory bowel diseases (IBD) in Japan has increased, the prevalence of celiac disease is considered very low with the lowest genetic disposition. IBD is reported as the most common comorbidity because of the high positive rate of serological celiac markers. The aim of this study was to examine the current incidence of celiac disease, especially in IBD patients in Japan, where both wheat consumption and incidence of IBD have increased. METHODS: A total of 172 patients with IBD and 190 controls in Japan were screened for serum antibody of tissue transglutaminase and deaminated gliadin peptide. In sero-positive patients, HLA testing and upper gastrointestinal endoscopy with duodenal biopsy was performed. Some of the sero-positive patients started a gluten-restricted or unrestricted diet, and serological change was determined. RESULTS: The positivity of both serum antibodies was significantly higher in IBD and correlated with disease activity. However, no biopsy-defined or HLA-defined true celiac disease was found. A decrease in serum antibody titers was observed with a gluten-restricted diet. CONCLUSIONS: Despite the increased incidence of IBD and high positivity for serum celiac antibody in Japanese IBD patients, no true-positive celiac disease was noted, suggesting the presence of gluten intolerance in these populations.},

   abstract = {OBJECTIVES: To establish the incidence of childhood coeliac disease (CD) in Scotland between 1 September 2009 and 31 August 2010, to determine clinical features at presentation and reasons for diagnosis, and to identify any differences in incidence and practice between regions. DESIGN: Prospective data collection through the Scottish Paediatric Surveillance Unit (SPSU). Strategic contacts in each tertiary gastrointestinal region (East, West and North) were emailed monthly to report new cases of CD (<16 years). A clinical questionnaire was completed for each case. Additionally, regional laboratories were asked to report the number of diagnostic antibody tests for CD performed over the year. SETTING: This national study looked at the total cases within Scotland. Scotland has a population of 5.2 million, with the mid-year estimate in 2009 of 912 144 children under the age of 16. RESULTS: 91 new cases were reported, giving an overall adjusted incidence of 10.0/100 000/year. Incidence in the East was 16.3/100 000/year, West 8.1/100 000/year and North 7.7/100 000/year. Cases diagnosed due to active screening in the East (4.6/100 000/year) were more than twice the number observed in the West (2.0/100 000/year) and North (1.3/100 000/year), as was the incidence of classic cases. The most frequent symptoms reported were abdominal pain (50/91; 54.9%), failure to thrive (29/91; 31.9%), fatigue (29/91; 31.9%), diarrhoea (27/91; 29.7%) and bloating (19/91; 20.9%). Twenty-two children (24.2%) were diagnosed due to active screening, of which 14 had associated type 1 diabetes mellitus, one Down syndrome and seven had family history. Fifty-five per cent (12/22) of the patients diagnosed through active screening were asymptomatic. Significantly more CD diagnostic antibody tests were performed per head of population in the East compared with the West (OR 1.65, 95% CI 1.57 to 1.73) and North (OR 1.81, 95% CI 1.70 to 1.92). CONCLUSIONS: Approximately double the incidence of paediatric CD was observed in the East of Scotland. Evidence of more actively screened cases diagnosed and more antibody tests performed in the region suggests a lower threshold to test. An environmental influence cannot be dismissed since more classic cases were also captured. Further research is needed to highlight the role of any exogenous factors.},

   abstract = {Autism spectrum disorders represent a diverse and heterogeneous array of conditions unified by the variable presence of specific behaviours impacting social and communicative functions (social affect) alongside other presentation. Common overt characteristics may come about as a consequence of several different genetic and biological processes differentially manifesting across different people or groups. The concept of plural 'autisms' is evolving, strengthened by an increasingly important evidence base detailing different developmental trajectories across the autism spectrum and the appearance of comorbidity variably interacting with core symptoms and onwards influencing quality of life. Reports that dietary intervention, specifically the removal of foods containing gluten and/or casein from the diet, may impact on the presentation of autism for some, complement this plural view of autism. Evidence suggestive of differing responses to the use of a gluten- and casein-free diet, defined as best- and non-response, has combined with some progress on determining the underlying genetic and biological correlates potentially related to such dietary elements. The preliminary suggestion of a possible diet-related autism phenotype is the result. This review will highlight several pertinent aspects onwards to an effect of food in some cases of autism including research on the pharmacological activity of food metabolites, immune response, issues with gut barrier function and some contribution from the gut microbiota. These represent promising areas in need of far greater research inspection in order to potentially define such a diet-related subgroup on the autism spectrum.},

   abstract = {Malabsorption, weight loss and vitamin/mineral-deficiencies characterize classical celiac disease (CD). This study aimed to assess the nutritional and vitamin/mineral status of current "early diagnosed" untreated adult CD-patients in the Netherlands. Newly diagnosed adult CD-patients were included (n = 80, 42.8 +/- 15.1 years) and a comparable sample of 24 healthy Dutch subjects was added to compare vitamin concentrations. Nutritional status and serum concentrations of folic acid, vitamin A, B(6), B(1)(2), and (25-hydroxy) D, zinc, haemoglobin (Hb) and ferritin were determined (before prescribing gluten free diet). Almost all CD-patients (87%) had at least one value below the lower limit of reference. Specifically, for vitamin A, 7.5% of patients showed deficient levels, for vitamin B(6) 14.5%, folic acid 20%, and vitamin B(1)(2) 19%. Likewise, zinc deficiency was observed in 67% of the CD-patients, 46% had decreased iron storage, and 32% had anaemia. Overall, 17% were malnourished (>10% undesired weight loss), 22% of the women were underweight (Body Mass Index (BMI) < 18.5), and 29% of the patients were overweight (BMI > 25). Vitamin deficiencies were barely seen in healthy controls, with the exception of vitamin B(1)(2). Vitamin/mineral deficiencies were counter-intuitively not associated with a (higher) grade of histological intestinal damage or (impaired) nutritional status. In conclusion, vitamin/mineral deficiencies are still common in newly "early diagnosed" CD-patients, even though the prevalence of obesity at initial diagnosis is rising. Extensive nutritional assessments seem warranted to guide nutritional advices and follow-up in CD treatment.},

We analysed the 10 ULN criterion and investigated multiple antibody-assays. Serum was collected from 1071 children with duodenal biopsy (376 CD patients, 695 disease-controls). IgA-antibodies to tissue transglutaminase (IgA-aTTG), IgG-antibodies to deamidated gliadin peptides (IgG-aDGL) and IgA-endomysium antibodies (IgA-EMA) were measured centrally. We considered 3 outcomes for antibody test procedures utilizing IgA-aTTG and/or IgG-aDGL: positive (>/=10 ULN, recommend gluten-free diet), negative (<1 ULN, no gluten-free diet) or unclear (perform biopsy). Positive (PPV) and negative (NPV) predictive values were based on clear test results. We required that they and their lower confidence bounds (LCB) be simultaneously very high (LCB >90% and PPV/NPV >95%). These stringent conditions were met for appropriate antibody-procedures over a prevalence range of 9-57%. By combining IgG-aDGL with IgA-aTTG, one could do without assaying total IgA. The PPV of IgG-aDGL was estimated to be extremely high, although more studies are necessary to narrow down the LCB. The proportion of patients requiring a biopsy was <11%. The procedures were either equivalent or even better in children <2 years compared to older children. All 310 of the IgA-aTTG positive children were also IgA-EMA positive. Antibody-assays could render biopsies unnecessary in most children, if experienced paediatric gastroenterologists evaluate the case. This suggestion only applies to the kits used here and should be verified for other available assays. Confirming IgA-aTTG positivity (>/=10 ULN) by EMA-testing is unnecessary if performed on the same blood sample. Prospective studies are needed.},

   abstract = {Free fatty acids receptor 3 (FFA3, GPR41) and 2 (FFA2, GPR43), for which the short-chain fatty acids (SCFAs) acetate and propionate are agonist, have emerged as important G-protein-coupled receptors influenced by diet and gut flora composition. A recent study (Kimura et al., 2011) demonstrated functional expression of FFA3 in the rodent sympathetic nervous system (SNS) providing a potential link between nutritional status and autonomic function. However, little is known of the source of endogenous ligands, signaling pathways, or effectors in sympathetic neurons. In this study, we found that FFA3 and FFA2 are unevenly expressed in the rat SNS with higher transcript levels in prevertebral (e.g., celiac-superior mesenteric and major pelvic) versus paravertebral (e.g., superior cervical and stellate) ganglia. FFA3, whether heterologously or natively expressed, coupled via PTX-sensitive G-proteins to produce voltage-dependent inhibition of N-type Ca(2+) channels (Cav2.2) in sympathetic neurons. In addition to acetate and propionate, we show that beta-hydroxybutyrate (BHB), a metabolite produced during ketogenic conditions, is also an FFA3 agonist. This contrasts with previous interpretations of BHB as an antagonist at FFA3. Together, these results indicate that endogenous BHB levels, especially when elevated under certain conditions, such as starvation, diabetic ketoacidosis, and ketogenic diets, play a potentially important role in regulating the activity of the SNS through FFA3.},

   abstract = {A significant proportion of patients with coeliac disease are 'nonresponsive' to gluten withdrawal. Most cases of nonresponsive coeliac disease are due to persisting gluten ingestion. Refractory coeliac disease (RCD) is currently defined by persistent symptoms and signs of malabsorption after gluten exclusion for 12 months with ongoing intestinal villous atrophy. Primary (without initial response to diet) and secondary (relapse following response to diet) RCD is recognized. RCD is further classified as type I or type II based on the absence or presence of a population of aberrant intestinal lymphocytes. Quality of dietetic advice and support is fundamental, and lack of objective corroboration of gluten exclusion may result in over-identification of RCD I, particularly in those cases with persisting antibody responses. Over-reliance on lymphocyte clonality similarly may result in over-diagnosis of RCD II which requires careful quantification of aberrant lymphocyte populations. Management of RCD should be undertaken in specialist centres. It requires initial intensive dietary supervision, strict gluten exclusion and subsequent re-evaluation. There is currently insufficient evidence to recommend specific treatments. Steroids are often used in both RCD I and II (albeit with little objective evidence of benefit in RCD II), and azathioprine as steroid-sparing therapy in RCD I. There is growing evidence for the use of cladribine in RCD II with autologous stem cell transplantation in nonresponders, but this requires further multicentre evaluation. There remains considerable controversy regarding the diagnosis, treatment and surveillance of RCD: international consensus in these areas is urgently required to facilitate future therapeutic advances.},

   abstract = {Celiac disease is a common autoimmune gastrointestinal disorder affecting multiple organs, precipitated in genetically vulnerable persons by the ingestion of gluten. Gluten is poorly digested and is presented to the intestinal mucosa as a large polypeptide. Binding to human leukocyte antigen-DQ2 and human leukocyte antigen-DQ8 molecules on antigen-presenting cells stimulates cellular and humeral immune reactions. Although common serological tests are available to diagnose celiac disease, the diagnosis of celiac disease is often delayed or missed because of lack of recognition as the disease presentation in adults is highly variable and may be asymptomatic. Celiac disease is a common secondary cause of metabolic bone disease and delayed treatment with gluten-free diet affects bone mineral density and fracture risk, so it is crucial to diagnose and treat celiac disease promptly. In this article, we will review recent studies of celiac disease in adults and provide practical, easily accessible information for busy clinicians.},

   abstract = {Celiac disease (CD) is an autoimmune disorder caused by intolerance to dietary gluten. The interleukin (IL)-17 and IL-22 function as innate regulators of mucosal integrity. Impaired but not well-understood kinetics of the IL-17/22 secretion was described in celiac patients. Here, the IL-17 and IL-22-producing intestinal cells were studied upon their in vitro stimulation with mitogens in class II major histocompatibility complex-defined, gluten-sensitive rhesus macaques. Pediatric biopsies were collected from distal duodenum during the stages of disease remission and relapse. Regardless of dietary gluten content, IL-17 and IL-22-producing cells consisted of CD4+ and CD8+ T lymphocytes as well as of lineage-negative (Lin-) cells. Upon introduction of dietary gluten, capability of intestinal T cells to secrete IL-17/22 started to decline (p<0.05), which was paralleled with gradual disruption of epithelial integrity. These data indicate that IL-17/22-producing cells play an important role in maintenance of intestinal mucosa in gluten-sensitive primates.},

   abstract = {Celiac disease (CD) is an immune-mediated, inflammatory disorder of the small intestines with a defined genetic etiological component associated with the expression of HLA-DQ2 and/or HLA-DQ8 haplotypes. The dietary consumption of gluten-rich cereals triggers a gluten-specific immune response in genetically susceptible individuals leading to a spectrum of clinical manifestations ranging from an inapparent subclinical disease, to overt enteropathy that can in some individuals progress to enteropathy-associated T cell lymphoma (EATL). The tissue-destructive pathologic process of CD is driven by activated NK-like intraepithelial CD8(+) lymphocytes and the proinflammatory cytokine IL-15 has emerged to be pivotal in orchestrating this perpetual tissue destruction and inflammation. Moreover, transgenic mice that over-express human IL-15 from an enterocyte-specific promoter (T3(b)-hIL-15 Tg) recapitulate many of the disease-defining T and B cell-mediated pathologic features of CD, further supporting the evolving consensus that IL-15 represents a valuable target in devising therapeutic interventions against the form of the disease that is especially refractory to gluten-free diet. In the present study, we evaluated the potential efficacy of tofacitinib, a pan-JAK inhibitor that abrogates IL-15 signaling, as a therapeutic modality against CD using T3(b)-hIL-15 Tg mice. We demonstrate that tofacitinib therapy leads to a lasting reversal of pathologic manifestations in the treated mice, thereby highlighting the potential value of tofacitininb as a therapeutic modality against refractory CD for which no effective therapy exists currently. Additionally, the visceral adiposity observed in the tofacitinib-treated mice underscores the importance of continued evaluation of the drug's impact on the lipid metabolism.},

   abstract = {Dermatitis herpetiformis (DH) is an autoimmune bullous disease, which represents the cutaneous manifestation of gluten sensitivity, in the setting of celiac disease. Although classical DH is characterized clinically by grouped, vesicles on an erythematous base, primary lesions often are absent owing to the intense, associated pruritus. Instead, many cases present only with erythematous erosions with numerous overlying excoriations. As in celiac disease, the core pathogenic mechanisms of DH are likely mediated by immunoglobulin A class autoantibodies against one of several transglutaminase enzymes. As the production of these autoantibodies is directly correlated with gastrointestinal exposure to gliadin, which is an alcohol-soluble fraction of gluten, a gluten-free diet represents the cornerstone of a DH management regimen. In cases refractory to dietary management alone, dapsone is the first-line agent for the treatment of DH, although many other agents have been anecdotally reported as effective.},

The rapid test results were compared with those of the conventional ELISA assay and with dietary compliance reported by patients' interview. CONCLUSIONS: The authors showed that anti-tTG rapid test is reliable and easy to perform in the ambulatory setting to evaluate dietary compliance. Moreover, they proved that celiacs' interview is more sensitive than serology in identifying patients who transgress.},

   abstract = {BACKGROUND & AIMS: Patients with celiac disease have varying degrees of damage to the small intestinal mucosa, ranging from lymphocytic duodenosis with normal villous structure to severe villous atrophy. We assessed whether the severity of mucosal lesions was associated with clinical and laboratory features of celiac disease. METHODS: We compared demographic, clinical, and laboratory characteristics among patients with celiac disease who were classified based on the severity of duodenal lesions. We analyzed data from 1408 adult patients seen consecutively at a tertiary referral center since 1990. Patients were classified as having villous atrophy (n = 1249) or as having mild enteropathy (n = 159) in the presence or absence of villous atrophy. RESULTS: Similar percentages of patients with villous atrophy, vs mild enteropathy, experienced weight loss (17% vs 17%), gastrointestinal manifestations (70% vs 70%), extraintestinal manifestations (66% vs 57%), and other associated conditions (19% vs 23%). More patients with villous atrophy than patients with mild enteropathy developed osteopenia or osteoporosis (22% vs 5%; P = .0005). Greater percentages of patients with villous atrophy than those with mild enteropathy also had anemia (42% vs 29%; P = .002), folate deficiency (75% vs 64%; P = .02), hypocholesterolemia (7% vs 2%; P = .02), hypocalcemia (26% vs 13%; P = .004), or hyperparathyroidism (45% vs 29%; P = .004). CONCLUSIONS: Although osteopenia, osteoporosis, and alterations in laboratory parameters are prevalent among patients with celiac disease with mild enteropathy, they are more prevalent and severe in those with villous atrophy. The prevalence of associated conditions is similar between these groups. These results indicate that celiac disease with mild enteropathy is not mild disease, but requires treatment with a gluten-free diet.},

AIMS: To assess changes of multiple cardiovascular risk factors in coeliac patients evaluated before and during a gluten-free diet. METHODS: Retrospective analysis of the effects of 1-5 years of gluten-free diet on indicators of cardiovascular risk and on distribution in cardiovascular risk categories in 715 coeliac patients. RESULTS: Compared to baseline, significant increases were found in body mass index (21.4+/-3.4 vs. 22.5+/-3.5; p<0.0001), total cholesterol (171.2+/-37.4mg/dL vs. 181.4+/-35.1mg/dL; p<0.0001), and gamma-glutamyl transpeptidase (16.5+/-14.9 vs. 19.5+/-19.2U/L; p<0.0001). Significant reductions were found in serum triglycerides (87.9+/-49.5 vs. 80.2+/-42.8mg/dL; p<0.0001) and homocysteine (16.9+/-9.6 vs. 13.3+/-8.0mumol/L; p=0.018) during gluten-free diet. The proportion of patients included in an arbitrarily defined category of "lowest cardiovascular risk profile" decreased from 58% at baseline to 47% during gluten-free diet. CONCLUSIONS: A gluten-free diet significantly affects cardiovascular risk factors in coeliac patients, but changes do not consistently point towards worse or better risk profiles, thus suggesting that the diet is unlikely to be atherogenic.},

   abstract = {BACKGROUND: Cereals of baking quality with absent or reduced toxicity are actively sought as alternative therapy to a gluten-free diet (GFD) for patients with coeliac disease (CD). Triticum monococcum, an ancient wheat, is a potential candidate having no toxicity in in-vitro and ex-vivo studies. The aim of our study was to investigate on the safety of administration of a single dose of gluten of Tm in patients with CD on GFD. METHODS: We performed a single blind, cross-over study involving 12 CD patients who had been on a GFD for at least 12 months, challenged on day 0, 14 and 28 with a single fixed dose of 2.5 grams of the following (random order): Tm, rice (as reference atoxic protein) and Amygluten (as reference toxic protein) dispersed in a gluten-free pudding. The primary end-point of the study was the change in intestinal permeability, as assessed by changes in the urinary lactulose/rhamnose ratio (L/R ratio) measured by High Pressure Liquid Chromatography. We also assessed the occurrence of adverse gastrointestinal events, graded for intensity and duration according to the WHO scale. Variables were expressed as mean +/- SD; paired t-test and chi(2) test were used as appropriate. RESULTS: The urinary L/R ratio did not change significantly upon challenge with the 3 cereals, and was 0.055 +/- 0.026 for Tm Vs 0.058 +/- 0.035 for rice (p = 0.6736) and Vs 0.063 +/- 0.054 with Amygluten (p = 0.6071). Adverse gastrointestinal events were 8 for Tm, Vs 11 for rice (p = 0.6321) and Vs 31 for Amygluten p = 0.0016), and, in all cases events were graded as "mild" or "moderate" with TM and rice, and as "severe" or "disabling" in 4 cases during Amygluten. CONCLUSIONS: No definite conclusion can be drawn on the safety of Tm, based on no change in urinary L/R because even Amygluten, a toxic wheat protein, did not cause a significant change in urinary L/R indicating low sensitivity of this methodology in studies on acute toxicity. Tm was, however, well tolerated by all patients providing the rationale for further investigation on the safety of this cereal for CD patients. TRIAL REGISTRATION: EudraCT-AIFA n2008-000697-20.},

   abstract = {Western countries are finding health care costs to be a continuously increasing financial burden in excess of previous budgetary allocations. Medical nutrition therapies (MNT) have proven to be an efficient cost minimising tool whilst concurrently improving the patient's quality of life. These MNTs are defined as specially processed or formulated foods that are used for the dietary management of patients. Among the medical foods, low-protein/protein-free (LP/PF) foods have been shown to improve the physical manifestation of metabolic disorders in patients with amino acid or protein-related diseases, such as Phenylketonuria, Tyrosinaemia type I, as well as chronic kidney, and coeliac. Most of the cereal-based LP/PF foods currently marketed are a blend of refined or chemically-based food ingredients with unpalatable frequently artificial flavours, having excessive sweetness to mask the chemical taste of ingredients (drug-like approach). However, the adoption of an alternative to convention, such as a food-like approach to developing medical foods, it is a surprisingly complex process. This is specifically true when the technological aspects of LP/PF foods and, in particular, protein-free cereal foods are considered. The primary processing issues arise while trying to replace gluten in baked cereal products. This represents a significant technological challenge, since gluten is an essential structural network-building protein necessary for baked goods. In this article, the suitable food technology challenges and strategies for developing LP/PF cereal foods able to overcome the significant limitations of a food-like approach will be addressed.},

   abstract = {OBJECTIVE: Strict adherence to a gluten-free diet is the only treatment for coeliac disease. The gluten-free diet is complex, costly and impacts on all activities involving food, making it difficult to maintain for a lifetime. The purpose of this cross-sectional study was to evaluate the difficulties experienced, the strategies used and the emotional impact of following a gluten-free diet among Canadians with coeliac disease. METHODS: A questionnaire was mailed to all members (n = 10 693) of both the Canadian Celiac Association and the Fondation quebecoise de la maladie coeliaque in 2008. RESULTS: The overall response rate was 72%. Results are presented for the 5912 respondents (>/=18 years) reporting biopsy-confirmed coeliac disease and/or dermatitis herpetiformis. Two-thirds never intentionally consumed gluten. Women reported significantly greater emotional responses to a gluten-free diet but, with time, were more accepting of it than men. Difficulties and negative emotions were experienced less frequently by those on the diet for >5 years, although food labelling and eating away from home remained very problematic. Frustration and isolation because of the diet were the most common negative emotions experienced. CONCLUSIONS: The present study quantifies the difficulties experienced, the strategies used and the emotional impact of following a gluten-free diet. It highlights the need to improve the training and education of dietitians, other health providers and the food service industry workers about coeliac disease and a gluten-free diet, with the aim of better helping individuals improve their adherence to a gluten-free diet and their quality of life.},

   abstract = {OBJECTIVES: Celiac disease is an enteropathy triggered by dietary gluten found in wheat, rye, and barley. Treatment involves a strict gluten-free diet (GFD). Quinoa is a highly nutritive plant from the Andes that has been recommended as part of a GFD. However, in-vitro data suggested that quinoa prolamins can stimulate innate and adaptive immune responses in celiac patients. Therefore, we aimed to evaluate the in-vivo effects of eating quinoa in adult celiac patients. METHODS: Nineteen treated celiac patients consumed 50 g of quinoa every day for 6 weeks as part of their usual GFD. We evaluated diet, serology, and gastrointestinal parameters. Furthermore, we carried out detail histological assessment of 10 patients before and after eating quinoa. RESULTS: Gastrointestinal parameters were normal. The ratio of villus height to crypt depth improved from slightly below normal values (2.8:1) to normal levels (3:1), surface-enterocyte cell height improved from 28.76 to 29.77 mum and the number of intra-epithelial lymphocytes per 100 enterocytes decreased from 30.3 to 29.7. Median values for all the blood tests remained within normal ranges, although total cholesterol (n=19) decreased from 4.6 to 4.3 mmol/l, low-density lipoprotein decreased from 2.46 to 2.45 mmol/l, high-density lipoprotein decreased from 1.8 to 1.68 mmol/l and triglycerides decreased from 0.80 to 0.79 mmol/l. CONCLUSIONS: Addition of quinoa to the GFD of celiac patients was well tolerated and did not exacerbate the condition. There was a positive trend toward improved histological and serological parameters, particularly a mild hypocholesterolemic effect. Overall, this is the first clinical data suggesting that daily 50 g of quinoa for 6 weeks can be safely tolerated by celiac patients. However, further studies are needed to determine the long-term effects of quinoa consumption.},

   abstract = {Some reports have demonstrated an inadequate response to hepatitis B vaccination in patients affected by celiac disease. The aim of our study was to evaluate hepatitis B vaccination response in relation to gluten exposure status in patients with celiac disease. To measure the gluten exposure status at the time of vaccination, we considered three groups: group A (exposed to gluten), including patients vaccinated as 12-year-old adolescents (the celiac disease diagnosis was established after vaccination); group B (not exposed to gluten), including patients vaccinated as 12-year-old adolescents on a gluten-free diet at the time of vaccination; and group C (infants), including patients vaccinated at birth. The response of celiac patients to hepatitis B vaccination was compared to that of healthy subjects, i.e., those in the control group (group D). This study included 163 celiac patients (group A, 57 patients; group B, 46 patients; and group C, 60 patients) and 48 controls (group D). An inadequate response to hepatitis B immunization was present in 43.9% of patients in group A, 34.8% of patients in group B, 58.3% of patients in group C, and 8.3% of patients in group D (group A versus group D, P < 0.001; group B versus group D, P = 0.002; group C versus group D, P = 0.001) (no significant difference for group A versus group B and group A versus group C was evident). Our data suggest that gluten exposure does not influence the response to hepatitis B immunization and that the human leukocyte antigen probably plays the main immunological role in poor responses to hepatitis B-vaccinated celiac patients.},

   abstract = {BACKGROUND: A recently devised tool, the celiac disease-specific quality of life scale has been proposed to assess specifically quality of life in celiac patients. AIM: To assess the validity and reliability of the Italian translation of the celiac disease-specific quality of life scale. METHODS: The celiac disease-specific quality of life scale underwent forward/backward translation. Adults patients on gluten free diet by at least one year, consecutively recruited, completed SF36 questionnaire, the Italian version of celiac disease-specific quality of life scale, the health related quality of life question and an abdominal pain scale. The study fulfilled criteria for acceptable psychometric assessment according to the International Quality of Life Assessment project. RESULTS: Two-hundred-thirty celiac patients were recruited after about nine years from diagnosis. Factor analysis indicates that there are some similarities and discrepancies between the English and the Italian questionnaires. Despite this, the Italian celiac disease-specific quality of life scale was able to identify the same four factors characterizing the patients' answers (dysphoria, limitations, health concerns, inadequate treatment). CONCLUSION: The celiac disease-specific quality of life scale is useful for assessing celiac disease-related quality of life. A wide use of the Italian celiac disease-specific quality of life scale may be of help in obtaining comparable data on QOL in different setting and countries.},

   abstract = {BACKGROUND: Celiac disease (CD) is a chronic gluten-sensitive enteropathy. Life-long gluten-free diet (GFD) is the only therapeutic option; however, it may contribute to the consumption of an unbalanced diet. The present study aimed to evaluate the dietary intake of CD affected children on a GFD and compare it with non-celiac children and with Italian nutritional intakes recommendations, as well as evaluate the contribution of commercially available gluten-free products (GFPs). METHODS: Eighteen celiac children, median age 7.6 years, median GFD duration 4.2 years, and 18 non-celiac controls, were enrolled in a cross-sectional age-matched study. Dietary intakes of both groups were collected using a food frequency questionnaire and a 24-hour dietary recall. Nutritional intakes were compared between the group and controls and with Italian dietary reference values. The contribution of GFPs to energy and macronutrient intakes was evaluated. RESULTS: Median energy intake was significantly higher in CD patients than in controls (8961.8 and 5761.0 kJ day(-1); P < 0.001). CD subjects showed higher carbohydrate intakes and lower fat intakes compared to controls. Protein-derived energy did not differ. By contrast to control subjects, energy derived from carbohydrate intakes in CD children met the Italian recommendations. Both children groups showed higher protein and fat intakes than recommended in Italy. GFPs consumption accounted for 36.3% of daily total energy intake. CONCLUSIONS: Intakes of simple sugars, fats and protein exceeded the National recommendations for health. Children with CD had significantly higher energy intakes than controls, although body mass index was comparable across the groups. Lack of nutritional information for GFPs prevented complete dietary analysis of subfractions of fat and micronutrient intakes. This aspect need to be addressed if studies in this field are to be meaningful in the future.},
