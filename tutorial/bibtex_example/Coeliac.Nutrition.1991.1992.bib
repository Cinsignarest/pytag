   abstract = {Motor fibers of the accessory celiac and celiac vagal branches are derived from the lateral columns of the dorsal motor nucleus of the vagus nerve. These branches also contain sensory fibers that terminate within the nucleus of the tractus solitarii. This study traces the innervation of the intestines by using the tracer cholera toxin-horseradish peroxidase. In 53 rats, the tracer was injected into either the stomach, duodenum, jejunum, terminal ileum, cecum, or ascending colon. With all cecal injections, prominent retrograde labeling of cell bodies occurred bilaterally in the lateral columns of the dorsal motor nucleus of the vagus nerve above, at, and below the level of the area postrema. Dendrites of laterally positioned neurons projected medially and rostrocaudally within the dorsal motor nucleus of the vagus nerve and dorsomedially into both the medial subnucleus and parts of the commissural subnucleus of the nucleus of the tractus solitarii. Sensory terminal labeling occurred in the dorsolateral commissural subnucleus at the level of the rostral area postrema and the medial commissural subnucleus caudal to the area postrema. Additionally, there was sensory terminal labeling within a small confined area of the dorsomedial zone of the nucleus of the tractus solitarii immediately adjacent to the fourth ventricle at a level just anterior to the area postrema. Stomach injections labeled motoneurons of the medial column of the entire rostrocaudal extent of the dorsal motor nucleus of the vagus nerve and a sensory terminal field primarily in the subnucleus gelatinosus, with less intense labeling extending caudally into the medial and ventral commissural subnuclei. Dendrites of gastric motoneurons project rostrocaudally and mediolaterally within the dorsal motor nucleus of the vagus nerve and dorsolaterally within the nucleus of the tractus solitarii. They are most pronounced at the level of the rostral area postrema where many dendrites course dorsolaterally terminating primarily within the subnucleus gelatinosus. Injections of the duodenum labeled a small number of the cells within the medial aspects of the dorsal motor nucleus of the vagus nerve. Jejunal, ileal, and ascending colon injections labeled cells sparsely within the lateral aspects of the dorsal motor nucleus of the vagus nerve bilaterally. No afferent terminal labeling was evident after injection of these areas of the bowel.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 400 WORDS)},

A gluten-free diet would normally restore mucosal morphology within months. The dapsone medication required to suppress the skin lesions could be gradually reduced and/or finally discontinued in most patients if they constantly adhere to the diet. The immunological reactions may also be reduced. The gluten-free diet could thus be successful both concerning manifestations from the skin and the gut. Although well known in dermatological literature, diet therapy in DH has attracted little interest in journals of nutrition. A survey of this causal diet therapy for the disease therefore seems appropriate.},

Of these, 83% were less than 2 years old at the time of their first duodenal biopsy and 74% of them have so far been verified according to the criteria of the European Society for Gastroenterology and Nutrition (ESPGAN). The cumulative incidence at 2 years of age/1000 liveborn infants increased significantly from 0.31 in the first birth cohort to 2.93 in the last. This increase could only partly be explained by improvements in detection. Weight for age at diagnosis was generally considerably below the reference value, but was slightly less affected towards the end of the period. The increase in incidence of coeliac disease is the first reported since the middle 1970s and makes the disease one of the most common chronic diseases among Swedish children.},

   abstract = {Between 1979 and 1986 a prospective study was performed on 15 gastrectomized (Billroth II) patients, who were above 65 years old, with evidence of clinical malnutrition as defined by anthropometric criteria. Gastrectomy had been performed between 2 and 55 years before the study (29 +/- 12.87 years). In twelve patients weight loss was observed ranging from 5.85 and 11.91 kg in a mean period of 12.7 months immediately prior to admission. In 8 cases the initial diagnosis was of malignancy, in 2 cases of severe anemia, and in 1 case of severe malnutrition. Intestinal malabsorption (IMB) was observed in 5 cases and intestinal bacterial overgrowth (IBO) in 2 cases, and both diagnosis in 4 cases using stool fat test and D-xylose test for the diagnosis of IMB and urine determination of Urican for the diagnosis of IBO. In two patients the test were normal and they could not be performed in two other. In 3 patients malignancy could not be observed however one of them presented IMB and the other IMB and IBO. We conclude that gastrectomy when performed in earlier ages can cause malnutrition at an older age, provoking a sudden malnutrition suggestive of malignancy. Most of these patients present IMB and/or IBO. Since IBO can cause irreversible mucosal damage, it is discussed whether this could be the cause of this clinical picture.},

   abstract = {Forty-three coeliac children, ranging from 1 year and 3 months to 14 years and 9 months, were studied. Twenty-eight patients were in an active phase of the disease, and 15 were in remission. The criteria of coeliac disease (CD) activity were established according to the results of IgA anti-endomysial antibodies (IgA-AEm). Interleukin 2 receptor (IL-2R) and CD4 and CD8 antigens were measured in serum samples by an ELISA technique using two noncompetitive monoclonal antibodies. Antigliadin antibodies of IgG (IgG-AGA) and IgA (IgA-AGA) classes were also measured. The AEm-positive coeliac patient group showed values of 1,860 +/- 948 U/ml for IL-2R, 430 +/- 228 U/ml for CD8, and 36.8 +/- 25.1 U/ml for CD4. AEm-negative patients showed values of 980 +/- 436 U/ml, 350 +/- 243 U/ml, and 24.1 +/- 20 U/ml, respectively. IL-2R levels were the only ones significantly elevated (p < 0.005) in the active coeliac group. On the other hand, IgG-AGA and IgA-AGA were both clearly increased (p < 0.001). IL-2R levels in active coeliac patients correlated with CD4 levels (p < 0.05), but not with CD8, IgG-AGA, and IgA-AGA levels. We also found a surprising negative correlation between AEm antibodies of IgA2 class with both IL-2R (r = 0.471; p < 0.05) and CD8 (r = 0.616; p < 0.05). The results show that in CD there is a lymphocyte activation affecting mainly CD4+ cells and not correlated with serum AGA levels, suggesting an independence of both immunological phenomena and probably with different locations of origin.},

Mean weight in females was 7.31 kg (P less than 0.001) and in males 11.98 kg (P less than 0.001) lower than in the reference population, with corresponding differences in BMI. No significant differences between age-weighted mean height, weight or BMI were found between a group of subjects who had experienced abdominal symptoms and were untreated in childhood compared to a group of subjects without such symptoms. Thus, coeliac disease, which has a well-documented retarding effect on growth during childhood, does not influence the final, attained height.},

   abstract = {It is generally accepted that celiac disease (CD) must always be taken into consideration when dealing with children manifesting growth failure. It is therefore important to have laboratory tests capable of detecting patients who should undergo intestinal biopsy. Auxological and endocrine parameters, bone age, some nutritional indices (hemoglobin, serum iron, calcium, total protein, and albumin), and anti-gliadin antibodies (AGA) IgA and IgG and 1-h blood xylose levels were evaluated in 49 children of short stature. On the basis of the intestinal biopsy, 29 (59.1%) patients affected by CD were found. When patients with atrophic and normal intestinal mucosa were compared, significant differences in the frequency of pathological values of hemoglobinemia, serum iron, AGA, and 1-h blood xylose levels were found, whereas no difference was observed in the levels of serum calcium, total protein, and albumin. Bone age was delayed in 81% of the celiac patients and in 47% of the controls. In particular, AGAs were found in 27 of 29 celiac patients and in three control subjects who showed a low level of one of the two antibodies. The results of our study demonstrate that AGA (IgA and IgG), together with 1-h blood xylose, hemoglobinemia, serum iron, and family history of CD determination, are extremely useful for screening patients of short stature. This type of screening cannot, however, replace the intestinal biopsy because such tests cannot be completely sensitive and specific.},

   abstract = {The growth spurt of adolescence, during which body weight nearly doubles and height increases by 16%, demands an increased delivery of nutrients by the gastrointestinal tract. Chronic disorders of digestion and absorption at this age, therefore have a potentially profound effect upon growth, skeletal maturation and sexual development. Moreover, the emotional climate of adolescence, which requires affiliation with peer groups, and a distancing from authority figures such as doctors and parents, is often associated with a deterioration in drug and dietary compliance and with erratic clinic attendance. Nutritional problems in adolescent patients with Crohn's disease, cystic fibrosis and coeliac disease are the most common. About one third of adolescents with Crohn's disease experience growth failure and delayed sexual development, probably as a consequence of long-term undernutrition. There is a strong argument for the care of these patients being in the hands of paediatric gastroenterologists. Enteral nutrition, often administered overnight, is successful in inducing catch-up growth, and reducing steroid dosage, although resection of diseased gut is often followed by good growth, and surgery should not be overlooked. Cystic fibrosis in adolescence is commonly complicated by protein-energy malnutrition. Pathogenesis includes anorexia, maldigestion and an increase in resting energy expenditure. Malnutrition has been treated by a number of enteral regimens. In general, there is no place for repeated, short-term interventions of less than 6 months. Long-term studies have all shown good nutritional repletion and growth, but results with respect to improved respiratory function are conflicting. More prospective control trials are needed before the precise indications for enteral nutrition in cystic fibrosis can be accurately defined. Once started it is difficult to stop, although preoperative treatment of patients awaiting heart-lung transplantation seems entirely appropriate. The major problem in the management of coeliac disease in adolescence is dietary compliance. Even those patients who claim to have good dietary compliance often have jejunal biopsy evidence of gluten ingestion and tend to be underweight. This is particularly worrying, as after 5 years adherence to a gluten free diet, the increased risk of gastrointestinal malignancy appears to return to normal.},

Large doses of non-EC enzymes are associated with increased serum urate (SU) and urinary uric acid (UUA) but data are unavailable for EC enzymes. This study compared the effectiveness and safety of a relatively large dose (patient's usual dose) versus a small dose (1/4 usual dose) of EC enzymes in nine nourished children with CF, regarding decreasing fecal fat and stool nitrogen losses and maintaining normal SU and UUA concentrations. A crossover study design randomly assigned large or small doses to two consecutive 7 day treatment periods within each child. Large doses of EC enzymes reduced steatorrhea and increased SU and UUA. SU was normal with both treatments and UUA was normal, i.e., 17 of 18 values were between the 10th and 95th percentiles for healthy children eating a normal diet. When fat excretion was greater than 10% with small doses of EC enzymes, large doses resulted in reduced fat excretion and normal UUA. These data suggest that large doses of EC enzymes reduce steatorrhea and are safe in patients who have malabsorbtion with small doses.},

The exact pathogenesis of CD is still obscure, but it is considered to be immunologically mediated. We have previously shown elevated prostaglandin E2 (PGE2) and thromboxane B2 (TxB2) content in small intestinal mucosa obtained from active celiac children. In the present study, we found significantly elevated PGE2, leukotriene B4 (LTB4), and leukotrienes C4, D4, and E4 (LTC4D4E4) content in small bowel mucosa from children suffering from CD on a gluten-containing diet in comparison to control subjects. PGE2 was 25,278 +/- 7,761 vs. 4,478 +/- 426 pg/mg of protein (mean +/- SEM), respectively. LTB4 was 8,807 +/- 3,706 vs. 403 +/- 63 pg/mg of protein (mean +/- SEM), respectively. LTC4D4E4 was 15,369 +/- 4,085 vs. 2,998 +/- 279 pg/mg of protein (mean +/- SEM), respectively. We conclude that the elevated content of arachidonic acid metabolic products via cyclooxygenase and lipoxygenase pathways may contribute to the diarrhea and may be involved in the pathogenesis of mucosal injury.},

We carried out a long-term prospective study in an attempt to clarify the effectiveness of the associated use of famotidine to enzymatic supplementation on fat absorption and nutritional parameters of patients with pancreatic insufficiency due to cystic fibrosis. We studied 10 patients, mean age 12.5 years, with persistent steatorrhea on enzymatic supplementation. A double-blind crossover design was used and famotidine (1 mg/kg/day) or placebo was given as adjuvant to enzymatic preparations for either of two six-month periods. A statistically significative reduction in fecal wet weight (P less than 0.0001), an improvement in the coefficient of fat absorption (P less than 0.01) and in the steatocrit values (P less than 0.028) were found on famotidine. Moreover, the weight and the height increases were greater after famotidine than after placebo period (respectively, P less than 0.012 and P less than 0.01); also the serum calcium and triglycerides levels were higher after the period on famotidine (respectively, P less than 0.0025 and P less than 0.025). No adverse effects of famotidine were noted. These data suggest that famotidine is a useful adjuvant to pancreatic enzyme therapy in patients with severe pancreatic insufficiency and persistent maldigestion on large doses of pancreatic supplements; in fact, famotidine improves not only fat absorption but the nutritional status of the patients.},

   abstract = {A new high pressure liquid chromatography (HPLC) method has been used to measure urinary sugar levels for the intestinal permeability test with cellobiose and mannitol (C/M test). Urinary specimens have been prepared by simple filtration through a Millipore membrane. The method is highly sensitive (minimal detectable concentration of urinary sugars = 0.01 mg/ml) and reproducible (coefficient variation between samples = 0.47% for cellobiose and 0.25% for mannitol). By this method a C/M test has been performed in a large series of gastroenterological patients. High values of mean urinary C/M percentage recovery ratio (C/M%) were found in 30 children with active gluten-sensitive enteropathy compared with controls (0.42 +/- 0.66 versus 0.014 +/- 0.005). In 44 treated celiacs and 34 children with chronic nonspecific diarrhea the mean C/M%s were 0.027 +/- 0.018 and 0.021 +/- 0.012, respectively. The results of this study confirm that the C/M test is a valuable investigation in the diagnostic studies of children with chronic diarrhea. The simple HPLC method described for the determination of urinary sugar levels should allow a wider diffusion of this test.},

A majority (75%) of patients in both groups belonged to Tamil Nadu and 90% had never consumed cassava. Whereas TCP occurred in young subjects of both sexes, ACP patients were all males and presented at an older age. The frequency of pain, diabetes, and pancreatic calcification was similar in the two groups. Patients in both groups were lean, but signs of severe malnutrition were rare. Prediabetic patients had normal body mass index. There were striking differences in radiological appearance of pancreatic calculi in TCP and ACP. Malignancy of the pancreas was present in three patients with TCP. Benign bile duct stenosis was seen in three patients with ACP but not in TCP. Compared to ACP seen in the West, our ACP patients had a shorter duration of symptoms in spite of having advanced disease. TCP and ACP have distinct clinical profiles and it is possible that some environmental factors may hasten the progress of ACP in the tropics.},

He received central parenteral nutrition beginning at three months of age after a poor response to a semielemental diet and peripheral parenteral nutrition. He was totally dependent on central parenteral nutrition thereafter. Although diarrhea disappeared with strict bowel rest, intolerance to minimal enteral feedings persisted throughout his 2 years 4 months of life. Investigations including stool examinations and repeated cultures, immune function studies, radiologic studies of the small bowel and screening for galactosemia and cystic fibrosis could not demonstrate a specific cause for the diarrhea. Repeated small intestinal biopsies at 1 month, 4 months and 1 year 5 months of age showed persistent villous atrophy with crypt hypoplasia and a low crypt mitotic index. Electron microscopic examination revealed normal-appearing microvilli. This child may have had a congenital enteropathy due to an inborn crypt regeneration defect causing lifelong intolerance to enteral feedings.},

Subjects were studied on the first, second, and fourth days of life. The median peak systolic velocities in the superior mesenteric artery were between 20 and 51% lower in the at-risk group than in the term control group on all 3 days of measurement (p less than 0.05-p less than 0.002). The ratio of peak systolic velocity in the coeliac axis to that in superior mesenteric artery, an index of relative downstream vascular resistance in the superior mesenteric artery, was 42-65% greater in the at-risk group compared with the other two groups on days 1 and 2 (p less than 0.05-p less than 0.001) and significantly greater than the term group on day 4 (73%, p less than 0.002). These data demonstrate that neonates at risk of developing necrotising enterocolitis have abnormal gut blood flow velocities. Furthermore, they provide evidence that an alteration in the splanchnic circulation may be an important factor in the final common pathway that links diverse risk factors for necrotising enterocolitis with clinical disease.},

There was a significant increase in fasting peak systolic velocity in the superior mesenteric artery between days 1 and 2 with a further upward trend until day 5; no such changes were seen in the coeliac axis. Fasting velocities were 20% lower in breast-fed babies than bottle-fed babies. Following feeds, there was a significant increase in velocity in the superior mesenteric artery that was 35% greater in the bottle-fed than breast-fed babies. Changes in the coeliac axis were qualitatively similar but substantially smaller. The peak velocity in both vessels occurred 50 min after a feed. We conclude that Doppler ultrasound can be readily used to measure gut blood flow velocities in the human newborn. It provides a noninvasive technique for investigating adaptive postnatal changes in the splanchnic circulation, and, in particular, the response to feeds.},

   abstract = {PIP: In view of the significant and articulate minority view among pediatricians that breast feeding is not "worth the bother" in developed countries, this review of the literature delves into the evidence from both developed and developing countries for the advantages of breastfeeding, both in infants and for long-term health. Infants in developed settings experience twice the hospitalization rate and more severe illness from lower respiratory tract infection, primarily respiratory syncytial virus. In developing countries the mortality risk is 4-fold. for otitis media, the relative risks were 3.3-4.3 for Finnish infants. Bacterial meningitis and/or bacteremia had a 4-fold risk for hospitalization in a Connecticut study, and a 3-fold relative risk in 2 developing country studies. Human milk was the best preventative for bacteremia and necrotizing enterocolitis in prematures in British neonatal units. A 20-fold reduction in neonatal deaths occurred in Philippine study of breastfeeding, especially in low birth weight babies. Diarrhea causes the most infant mortality in developing nations, where bottle-feeding raises rates 14-fold. In the U.S. estimated relative risks is 3.7 for diarrheal mortality. Sudden infant death is about 1/5 less common in U.S. breast fed babies than in bottle fed. There is evidence for better long-term health after breast feeding in disorders such as celiac disease, Crohn disease, ulcerative colitis, insulin-dependent diabetes mellitus, thyroid disease, malignant lymphoma, chronic liver disease, atopic dermatitis, and food allergies. The design of good studies of protection conferred by breast feeding, and the possible modes of action of breast milk are discussed.

Evaluation of iron status included hematological indices, serum ferritin, and transferrin saturation. Iron absorption was assessed by the increment of serum iron after an oral iron load. Iron deficiency was common among patients affected by malabsorptive states, such as celiac disease (84%), cow's milk intolerance (76%), Crohn's disease (72%), and giardiasis (64%), whereas it was less common among patients with postinfectious enteritis (41%) and chronic nonspecific diarrhea (11%). Intestinal blood loss was seen only in patients with Crohn's disease and cow's milk intolerance, irrespective of iron nutritional status. On the other hand, iron malabsorption was very common, affecting 85-95% of the iron-deficient patients in all diagnostic groups, except in chronic nonspecific diarrhea. Iron malabsorption was less common among patients with adequate iron nutritional status than in those with iron deficiency. Iron malabsorption appears to play a major role in the pathogenesis of iron deficiency in patients with malabsorption. The iron absorption test shows greater sensitivity as a screening test for upper intestinal malabsorption than the D-xylose absorption test.},

   abstract = {The coeliac disease (CD) or gluten-sensitive enteropathy (GSE) is a permanent intolerance to wheat gliadin and to correlated proteins inducing malabsorption and typical damages of the jejunal mucosa (total or subtotal villous atrophy = SVA) in genetically-predisposed individuals ("DQW2"). A large amount of research has been devoted to CD pathogenesis: the most recent studies, thanks to sophisticated and experimental methods, support the pathogenetic immunological theory and the one of direct cytotoxicity. The correct diagnostic procedure for CD, established in 1970 by the European Society for Pediatric Gastroenterology and Nutrition (ESPGAN), suggested three small bowel mucosal biopsies. In the last years, because of the difficulties of such a practice, the necessity of non-invasive diagnostic approaches has developed; such approaches have been verified in absorption tests (one-hour blood xylose, intestinal permeability methods) and in immunogenetic tests (antibodies antigliadin, anti-reticulin, anti-endomysium, anti 90 KD glycoprotein, anti-human jejunum, HLA I/II antigens). The specific MHC antigens establish CD's incidence in several population and in particular situations, as in first-degree relatives and in diseases associated with CD (dermatitis herpetiformis (DH), insulin dependent diabetes mellitus (IDDM) and other auto-immune syndromes). The specific serum antibodies singly used as first level screening if estimated in combination with absorption tests, reach the highest levels of specificity and sensibility in CD diagnosis. It's anyway fundamental the comparison with at least a typical CD histological feature, caused by a challenge with a sufficient gluten to be carried in dubious cases and in non high auxological risk age (ESPGAN 1989). Adolescence is a period of frequent non compliance with a gluten-free diet and of particular psychological and physical problems: the apparent "gluten insensitivity", typical of teen-agers and adults, recalls the definitions of silent CD and latent CD (iceberg like). In the first case the jejunal mucosa is abnormal and the symptomatology isn't evident. In latent CD, genetically restricted, the mucosa is normal but there are minimal markers of inappropriate immunity to gliadin (at intestinal humoral immunity level) and a possible worsening of histological lesions to the third stage under environmental stimuli. This represents a two-stage model CD. That's why CD is still under-evaluated despite recent statistics reporting an increasing incidence (late and atypical forms). Prevalence rates between 1:300 and 1:4,000 and more are quoted in literature. The necessity of a strict gluten-free diet is confirmed by the evident frequency of lymphoma and by the increased risk of malignancy in untreated CD.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 400 WORDS)},

   abstract = {Poly arteritis nodosa (PAN) is a systemic vasculitis with a male: female ratio of 2:1 and a peak incidence in the fifth decade. Small to medium-sized arteries are involved by focal transmural inflammatory necrosis. Aneurysms with inflammatory destruction of the media also occur. The most frequently involved organs are the kidney, heart, lung, liver, and gastrointestinal tract. There are few reported cases of ischemic necrosis of the intestine and even fewer survivors. A 22-year-old woman was transferred to St. Thomas Hospital (Nashville, TN) after resection of 80 per cent of the small bowel for ischemic necrosis. She had a history of juvenile onset diabetes mellitus, recurrent abdominal pain, and splinter hemorrhages. Emergency aortogram and selective mesenteric arteriogram were performed. The celiac artery was not visualized and small aneurysms were present in the mesenteric and renal arteries. The patient was successfully resuscitated from a cardiac arrest in x ray from a cardiac tamponade. Laparotomy was performed to determine the viability of the bowel. The celiac, hepatic, and splenic arteries were found to be chronically occluded. Pathology of these arteries revealed a nonspecific arteritis. At a third operation, several more inches of small bowel were removed. Characteristic changes of PAN were present on all small bowel specimens. She was treated with high-dose cyclophosphamide and steroids for 6 months and has continued on low-dose cyclophosphamide. She is now 36 months from her original operation and is doing well on oral nutrition. Intestinal hemorrhage from aneurysm rupture or gangrene with perforation are gastrointestinal complications of PAN that the surgeon may be called upon to treat.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS)},

Determinations of BAs were made by radioimmunoassays after an overnight fasting and for 4 h postprandially after intake of a standardized test meal. In untreated celiac disease presenting with subtotal villous atrophy, peak concentrations of primary BAs were significantly delayed and serum levels were significantly higher than in controls. Small but significant abnormalities persisted after a period of gluten-free diet despite a normalization of mucosal morphology. Slightly pathological standard liver function tests in five patients were related to increased fasting levels but not to the postprandial pattern of BAs, indicating that the observed abnormalities postprandially were not related to liver disease. Further studies simultaneously focusing on deconjugation mechanisms, absorption, and pool sizes of BAs are required to explain the postprandial BA pattern under the course of celiac disease.},

The permeability test involved administering an oral solution containing a mixture of lactulose (10 g) mannitol (5 g and 0.5 microCi) and (51)Cr-EDTA (30 microCi), and collecting urine samples before, and between 0-6, 6-12 and 12-24 h after dosing. The excretion of the markers was compared with the results obtained from 24 normal or control subjects and 15 patients with coeliac disease. None of the markers were excreted in significantly different amounts in the infected patients compared to the control subjects. In contrast, the coeliac patients excreted (0-6 h) four-fold more lactulose, three-fold more (51)Cr-EDTA and two-fold less mannitol than the normal subjects. The ratio of lactulose: mannitol and (51)Cr-EDTA: mannitol were therefore six- to eight-fold greater in the coeliac patients than in the normal subjects. The results confirm the sensitivity of the test for detecting the presence of an enteropathy but provide no evidence of a change in intestinal permeability in systemic infections studied under the stated conditions.},

Doppler indices of flow velocity from the superior mesenteric and coeliac arteries were measured immediately before, and at postprandial time intervals up to 60 minutes after, a first feed of 1 ml of milk given through a nasogastric tube. There were no significant differences between the preprandial and postprandial values of blood pressure, heart rate, oxygen and carbon dioxide tensions, and pH. The median peak systolic velocity (PSV) (55.9 cm/sec) and time average mean velocity (TAV) (10.6 cm/sec) before the feed at the superior mesenteric artery rose progressively and significantly to postprandial peaks of 88.5 cm/sec and 20.5 cm/sec at 45 minutes, respectively. Significant postprandial rises in the median PSV and TAV values at the coeliac artery were also observed, with a peak at 45 minutes. There were no significant correlations between blood flow velocity indices (preprandial or postprandial) and gestational age, postnatal age, conceptional age, or birth weight. We conclude that the first exposure of preterm babies to a small volume of milk feed is associated with postprandial changes in blood flow velocity consistent with an increase in blood flow in the superior mesenteric and coeliac arteries, although the mechanism of this response is uncertain.},

Intestinal permeability was studied by measuring the urinary excretion of two sugars, lactulose and L-rhamnose, before and six hours after the ingestion of five palatable biscuits made with 50 g of gluten powder. The patients with coeliac disease had been on a gluten free diet during the previous two years. After the gluten load lactulose and L-rhamnose urinary excretion changed significantly in patients, and a significant increase in the lactulose: L-rhamnose ratio was also observed. No significant changes were observed in the controls. In view of the modification of the three biopsies diagnostic protocol made by the European Society for Paediatric Gastroenterology and Nutrition, permeability tests associated with single gluten challenges may be an added contribution to the accuracy of the diagnosis in childhood.},

Aiming to assess the reliability of this method and its usefulness in the diagnosis of intestinal enteropathies, we measured the steatocrit in 747 healthy children and 442 children with diarrhea grouped according to diagnosis. The steatocrit was found to correlate strictly (r = 0.93) with the chemical measurement of fecal fat. Reference values and ranges were established. The maximal steatocrit was observed in neonates; afterwards, it progressively decreased to an undetectable level in children older than 2 years of age. A steatocrit abnormally high for age was found in 20% of patients with acute diarrhea and in 53% of those with chronic diarrhea. All celiac patients with a gluten-containing diet showed a marked increase of steatocrit. We conclude that the steatocrit is a reliable and easy-to-perform test, which quickly provides valuable information in the diagnostic workup of the child with diarrhea.},

The natural killer and large granular lymphocytes cells were characterised by either immunohistochemical or phase contrast microscopical procedures on the initial biopsies from 15 children with coeliac disease. They were compared with seven individuals with partial villus atrophy and eight with normal villous morphology. Although the histological findings were similar in the initial biopsies of all patients with coeliac disease, the patients with permanent coeliac disease had a significantly lower number (0.41(0.61)cells/mm2) of large granular lymphocytes and natural killer cells compared with those patients with abortive coeliac disease (11.93 (6.23) cells/mm2). Those in the permanent group developed a significantly more pronounced flat mucosa after gluten challenge or provocation compared with the abortive group and had to remain on a strict gluten free diet in contrast with those in the abortive group. Thus, the occurrence of intraepithelial large granular lymphocytes and natural killer cells characterises two distinctly different coeliac diseases. Based on our results neither the histological evaluation of the biopsy nor the utilisation of the revised European Society for Paediatric Gastroenterology and Nutrition (ESPGAN) Criteria are adequate in diagnosing the two types of coeliac disease.},

"Baby foods" include complete meals sold in jars, soups, desserts and puddings, fruit juices, nectars, and vegetable juices. "Cereal-based weaning foods" are composed of one or more cereals either alone, or with the addition of vegetables, fruits, milk and milk products, egg, or other ingredients. Weaning food labelling should include information if sugars, salt, iron, vitamins minerals and trace elements have been added and if the product is free from gluten, cow's milk and egg protein, and lactose.},

This observation may be linked to the malabsorption that occurs in these patients; however, the underlying mechanism remains unknown. To better understand this phenomenon, we have studied the growth patterns of 153 patients with coeliac disease for 2-9 years. Gastro-intestinal biopsies were performed before and after gluten exclusion. In a second group of 79 children, somatostatin levels and binding properties in the plasma and jejunal mucosa were measured. In a third group of 40 patients we measured insulin-like growth factor I (IGF-I) and IGF-binding protein 3 (IGF-BP3) levels. We found that in children diagnosed before 2 years of age weight was the most affected growth parameter. In children diagnosed after this age, height was more affected. Suppression of gluten intake induced an acceleration of growth velocity. Although plasma levels of somatostatin were not significantly altered, somatostatin concentrations in the jejunal mucosa of patients in the active phase of the disease were significantly elevated (p < 0.05). Children with coeliac disease exhibited significantly lower levels of IGF-BP3 when compared to patients with normal stature and growth velocities. In contrast, these patients showed an increase in IGF-BP3 levels after gluten exclusion from the diet.},

In six celiac children on a strict gluten-free diet and with a normal small intestinal biopsy, the FAB12 performed in the fasting patient averaged 30% (23-40%). After gluten challenge for a mean of 2 months (range 1-4), when mucosal damage was demonstrated by biopsy, the average fasting FAB12 in these patients decreased to 10% (0-17%) (p less than 0.05). However, when the FAB12 test was repeated by means of stimulation by a B12-free meal 1-3 weeks later, while the patients were still on a diet containing gluten, a significant increase was observed (mean 21%, range 14-27%) (p less than 0.05). In four of the six patients the B12 absorption was further evaluated by repeating the FAB12 test by means of intravenous cholecystokinin (CCK) stimulation (n = 3) or by administration of exocrine pancreas enzyme supplementation (EPES) (n = 2) or cobinamide (n = 1). These tests all showed FAB12 values within the range of the meal-stimulated FAB12. Moreover, in eight gluten-free celiac children with normal biopsies, no difference was found between fasting and meal-stimulated FAB12 values. Therefore, it is likely that the early-onset B12 malabsorption observed in the gluten-challenged celiac child with upper-small-intestinal mucosal damage is in part due to an insufficient stimulation of the exocrine pancreas when using the standard fasting B12 absorption test.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS)},

   abstract = {The steatocrit test, a simple semiquantitative method for determining fat content in stool, was performed after a standard fatty meal to detect malabsorption in patients with celiac disease. Thirty-seven children (mean age 2.6 +/- 2.1 years) with total atrophy of the intestinal villi and 79 controls (mean age 3.5 +/- 2.8 years) were studied. All subjects underwent a small-bowel biopsy, a D-xylose absorption test, a rapid triglyceride absorption test, and a steatocrit determination first on an uncontrolled diet and then again after a standard fatty meal. The steatocrit test after a fatty meal did not detect any false-positive or false-negative results, while the D-xylose test showed two false-negative and four false-positive results, and the rapid triglyceride absorption test found two false-negative and 23 false-positive results. We conclude that the determination of steatocrit after a standard fatty meal is a useful, simple, and noninvasive test to identify patients with total intestinal villous atrophy.},

On 3 consecutive days, two physiologic-dose tests of 2000-2400 retinol equivalents (RE) and one pharmacologic-dose test (84,000 RE) were administered. The physiologic doses were given as an oil-soluble or a water-miscible preparation. In gastrointestinal-disease patients the physiologic-dose test was highly correlated with the pharmacologic-dose test for the oil-soluble preparation as determined by peak rise (r = 0.50, P less than 0.05) and area under the curve (r = 0.56, P less than 0.01), suggesting that the physiologic dose is valid for investigating vitamin A absorption. Intestinal-disease or resection patients absorbed preparations poorly. Pancreatic-disease patients absorbed the oil-soluble preparation poorly. Physiologic rather than pharmacologic doses of vitamin A can be used to study vitamin A absorption.},

Elevated (greater than 0.30 units) gluten IgA antibody levels (0.82 +/- 0.22 units) were detected in five children (aged 8.5 +/- 1.6 years, height standard deviation score -2.14 +/- 0.26). They had probable celiac disease based on villus atrophy at duodenal biopsy, in vitro toxicity of wheat gluten, and disappearance of serum gluten antibodies after gluten withdrawal from the diet. Three of these children had elevated IgG antibody levels (greater than 0.25 units). Elevated IgG antibody levels with normal IgA levels were demonstrated in 11 short children who had normal duodenal biopsy results. It is concluded that measurement of gluten antibodies, especially of the IgA type, should be included in the diagnostic evaluation of children with short stature.},

   abstract = {Pain management, nutritional support, and psychosocial support are fundamental services that enhance patients' ability to cope with their cancer and its therapy. The common goal of symptom prevention mandates that each of these supportive services be provided to all patients throughout their cancer experience. Comprehensive cancer pain management begins with identifying the origin of all of the patient's pains and treating each one specifically. Pain prevention can be achieved through around-the-clock opioid administration with as-needed supplements for breakthrough pain and dose titration. Common narcotic side effects such as constipation and nausea also must be prevented. Successful opioid analgesia requires that patient and family concerns regarding addiction and tolerance be dispelled at the outset. Cancer pain prevention can be further optimized with the use of appropriate coanalgesics in response to the pathophysiology of the patient's pains. Cognitive and behavioral therapies may also be useful adjuncts to reduce both pain and suffering. Procedure-oriented pain control should be considered when systemic pharmacologic therapy does not provide adequate pain relief or is associated with intolerable side effects. The only absolute contraindications for pain-relieving procedures are untreatable coagulopathy and a decrease in mental status not related to medical pain management. Useful neurodestructive techniques include radiofrequency lesioning, cryoanalgesia, and chemical neurolysis with agents such as phenol, alcohol, and hypertonic saline. The most beneficial pain-relieving procedures and percutaneous cordotomy, spinal narcotics, celiac and hypogastric plexus ablation, spinal neurolysis, and epidural injection of steroids and hypertonic saline. Procedure selection depends on the cause of the pain and the patient's prognosis. Common indications for pain-relieving procedures include unilateral pain below the shoulder, upper abdominal visceral pains, pelvic visceral pain, perineal pain, vertebral body metastasis, discogenic pain, and spinal stenosis. As results of well-conducted scientific trials begin to appear in the literature, the indications for these procedures will be better understood, resulting in their more appropriate use. Principles of nutritional support in patients with cancer include an awareness of the problem of malnutrition and its impact on performance status, quality of life, prognosis, and treatment; identification of those patients at risk; prophylactic versus therapeutic intervention; and analysis and management of the specific impediment(s) to adequate nutrient intake and absorption. The primary goals for nutritional support in cancer patients are prevention of weight loss and maintenance of adequate protein status. Appreciation of practical issues of nutritional support will enable the practicing physician to achieve these goals using primarily oral nutrition options.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 400 WORDS)},

According to criteria by European Society of Paediatric Gastroenterology and Nutrition, the conclusive diagnosis of celiac disease in children depends on the demonstration of histological relapse of the mucosa after reintroduction of gluten in the diet, as this syndrome is a permanent condition of gluten intolerance. Under these diseased conditions, the structure of the intestinal villi has been studied by light microscopy; morphological alterations were revealed only when the gluten challenge induced a clinical relapse. Scanning electron microscopy analyses of the intestinal mucosa in celiac diseased patients showed a strikingly uniform destruction of the villi with changes in their dimensions and arrangement. At high magnification the enterocytes were irregular in size and shape with a decrease and disruption of the glycocalyx. Reductions in length and density of microvilli were also clearly identified. Although these scanning electron microscopy findings could not demonstrate a relationship between the degrees of mucosal atrophy and the duration of the gluten challenge, they nevertheless revealed early stages of fine villous alterations that cannot be detected by the presently employed low resolution light microscopic techniques.},

   abstract = {Permeability test with sugars (PTS) as a non-invasive diagnostic tool is of special interest in pediatric patients. This study evaluated the relationship between PTS and antigliadin antibodies (AA) with the intestinal biopsy and studied whether an altered expired hydrogen test (EHT) could interfere in this relation in celiac patients. Thirty children (13 girls, 17 boys) with diagnosis of celiac disease (ESPGAN criteria) were divided into three groups according to this histopathology: Group A (n = 23) normal biopsy; Group B (n = 7) biopsy grade III or IV; Group C (n = 25) controls. The intestinal permeability test showed significative differences (p < 0.01) of Group B (0.159 +/- 0.03) with Group A (0.048 +/- 0.005) and with the control Group C (0.039 +/- 0.002). The cut-off for the Youden maximum index (0.75) was 0.092 and ROC SE 0.87 +/- 0.7. The results of the AA were related to those of the PTS. The variance analysis showed that the results of the expired hydrogen test do not interfere statistically on the good correlation of PTS with the histology. The PTS is a good indicator of the status of intestinal mucosa. There is a good correlation between PTS and AA in celiac children. A pathological expired hydrogen test seems not to interfere with the correlation found between PTS and histological damage in our series.},

DESIGN: Clinical assessment and laboratory analysis of patients with suspected coeliac disease. SETTING: Gastroenterology department of teaching hospital. PATIENTS: 96 adults with suspected coeliac disease attending for jejunal biopsy. MAIN OUTCOME MEASURES: Diagnosis of coeliac disease with the revised criteria of the European Society of Paediatric Gastroenterology and Nutrition in patients with and without antibodies associated with coeliac disease. RESULTS: 28 patients had a clinical diagnosis of coeliac disease, seven of other gastrointestinal diseases, and 12 of miscellaneous diseases; 49 had no diagnosis. Gliadin IgA detected by ELISA was found in all patients with coeliac disease and none of those without, giving a sensitivity, specificity, positive and negative predictive values, and predictive efficiency of 100% for diagnosing coeliac disease within the group. Endomysial IgA was found in 25 (89%) patients with coeliac disease and jejunal IgA in 21 (75%); neither IgA was found in patients without coeliac disease. CONCLUSION: Detection of gliadin IgA by ELISA and to a lesser extent the endomysial IgA should allow better selection of patients for jejunal biopsy and thus make diagnosing coeliac disease simpler and more efficient.},

During the first 2 d mild symptoms of intolerance developed in 63% of patients on whole milk, 37% on acidified milk, and 54% on LFD whereas severe intolerance, necessitating withdrawal, was encountered in 22% receiving whole milk and none receiving LFD. Stool weights and fat excretion on day 3 were greater (P less than 0.02) in the remaining milk-fed patients whereas nitrogen balance remained strongly positive in all three groups. Eighty-seven percent of patients were methane producers, and high excretion rates were associated with better milk tolerance. The results suggest that although undiluted cow milk will not form a suitable tube feed for malnourished African patients, products such as acidified milk may prove cost effective.},

Such an analysis revealed that only AGA was useful to discriminate between patients with a gluten-free diet (second biopsy negative) and patients receiving a gluten-containing diet (third biopsy positive).},

Enriched samples of IgA and IgG AGA were obtained by means of protein A chromatography after immunoaffinity purification of pooled sera from untreated celiac patients. No cross-reactivity with other food antigens (beta-lactalbumin, soya proteins, ovalbumin) was detected. The quantitative evaluation of protein content in IgA and IgG AGA samples obtained by immunoaffinity chromatography, was performed by means of ELISA sandwich method using a reference curve obtained with pure standard human immunoglobulins. Scalar concentrations of purified IgA and IgG were then used to obtain a reference standard curve by means of an ELISA method. Such standard curve was utilized for titrating AGA in 214 sample sera. The minimal detectable concentration of IgA and IgG AGA was 0.02 micrograms/ml. The reproducibility of within- and between-assay resulted very good for IgA-AGA and acceptable for IgG-AGA. The method here described seems to be satisfactory not only for quantitative diagnostic purposes in routine screenings but also in epidemiological studies. Moreover, it can constitute a suitable way to solve practical problems of quality control of AGA ELISA assay.},

   abstract = {60 patients suffering from coeliac disease were continuously cared for during a longer period. In these patients the diagnosis was established on the basis of the commonly used ESPGAN criteria in their childhood. Another biopsy was performed in adolescence and early adulthood. In 26 patients the diagnosis coeliac disease was confirmed. These patients are recommended to carry on keeping to a strict diet. 4 patients show a normal mucosa (type I) while following normal nutrition for more than 2 up to 5 years in adulthood although in their childhood the diagnosis of coeliac disease was established. While being put an a diet or following a short lasting normal nutrition, respectively, 17 patients have a morphologically intact mucosa of the small intestine, which is, however, in nearly all cases functionally damaged. In these patients the diagnosis is to be clarified definitely by means of a final biopsy of the small intestine after an at least 2-year-lasting exposition to gluten. 13 patients refused a biopsy in adulthood.},

   abstract = {Patients with cystic fibrosis may still have a significant degree of steatorrhea despite adequate pancreatic enzyme supplementation. Taurine is a conditionally essential amino acid that possibly improves the micellar phase of fat digestion. Thirteen children with cystic fibrosis and a significant degree of steatorrhea (> 13 g/d) were enrolled in a randomized double-blind crossover study of taurine (30 mg/kg per day) in contrast to placebo for two successive 4-month periods. No difference was noted in height and weight velocity, lung function, vitamin A level, and essential fatty acid status. Twelve of the 13 patients showed a decrease in fecal fatty acid excretion (26.5 +/- 2.6 g/24 h vs 15.4 +/- 2.5 g/24 h), affecting mainly saturates and monounsaturates, and a decrease in total sterol excretion (1492.6 +/- 303 mg/24 h vs 1211.7 +/- 213.8 mg/24 h) while ingesting taurine. Taurine may be a useful adjunct in patients with cystic fibrosis and severe steatorrhea.},

In the first 24-h faeces, the F-Chym concentration, calculated as a mean of three random samples, did not significantly differ from a single value obtained after homogenization. In known pancreatic disease, a F-Chym concentration less than 3.0 U/g wet faeces distinguished well between steatorrhoic patients (n = 12) and nonsteatorrhoic (n = 13) (positive predictive value (PV), 91%; negative PV, 86%) but was less suitable as a screening test for pancreatic steatorrhoea in the unselected patient group (positive PV, 61%; negative PV, 98%). Although the estimation of 72-h F-Chym output could differentiate between various subgroups of patients to a certain extent, the positive PV for discovery of pancreatic steatorrhoea in a single patient was low. Four patients had excessively high F-Chym output and increased bile acid excretion after ileal resection (n = 3) and radiation ileitis (n = 1), respectively, possibly indicating the removal of an inhibitory mechanism of pancreatic and biliary secretion in these conditions.},

Barium studies and upper endoscopy revealed gastric outlet obstruction with prepyloric ulcerations. Endoscopic biopsies were consistent with chronic gastritis. The patient did not respond to intensive medical management, including total parenteral nutrition, intravenous cimetidine, and nasogastric suctioning. At the time of surgery, large celiac lymph nodes were noted surrounding the pylorus and the first portion of the duodenum. Biopsies of the wall of the stomach and lymph nodes demonstrated necrotizing granulomas. Cultures for acid-fast bacilli subsequently grew Mycobacterium tuberculosis. A search for foci outside the gastrointestinal tract was negative. Primary gastric tuberculosis remains an extremely uncommon clinical entity; the definitive diagnosis is made by biopsy and positive culture for the organism.},

   abstract = {Serum anti-gliadin antibodies (AGAs) of the IgG and IgA isotypes were determined in 17 children (mean age of 5.6 years) by means of an enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay (ELISA). All children were suspected of celiac disease. They had been on dietary treatment for at least 10 months before they were challenged with gluten. Based on jejunal biopsy findings, 10 of the 17 children had to be considered positive. The sensitivity of the measurement of AGA at 6 weeks after gluten challenge was found to be 90% for IgG, 100% for IgA, and 100% for IgG/IgA combined. The specificity for IgG, IgA, and the IgG/IgA combination was 100, 71, and 100%, respectively. Twelve weeks after gluten challenge, the sensitivity as well as the specificity of AGA determination for IgG, IgA, and IgG/IgA were 100%. It is concluded that testing both IgG AGA and IgA AGA in children suspected of celiac disease is valuable in monitoring the course of the diagnostic provocation protocol and that jejunal biopsies can be abolished. This inexpensive tool can be useful in reducing the number of intestinal biopsies.},

This incidence rate by birth is the lowest described in an epidemiological study in contrast with rates of 0.33 to 8 per 1000 live births found in other western countries. This difference may be explained by the different diagnostic criteria used for coeliac disease. Another contributing factor may be a late and gradual introduction of gluten-containing cereals into the diet of Danish infants.},

METHODS: We looked for IgA anti-endomysial antibodies (IgA-EmA) in 103 sera of 90 children (age: 2 months-13.9 years) using an indirect immunofluorescence method on monkey oesophagus sections. In 44 patients, the diagnosis of coeliac disease was confirmed fulfilling new criteria of the European Society of Pediatric Gastroenterology and Nutrition. RESULTS: All 24 coeliac disease patients with an initial flat mucosa had IgA-EmA (sensitivity 100%). In 36% of coeliac disease patients adhering to a gluten-free diet we found IgA-EmA. None of 46 patients in whom coeliac disease had been excluded by jejunal biopsy had IgA-EmA (specificity 100%). The sera of 102 blood-donors were used as controls and showed a test specificity of 99%. In coeliac disease patients, the titer of IgA-EmA declined during gluten-free diet by 0.66 steps/month on average, and rose 1.76 steps/month during gluten challenge. CONCLUSIONS: These results confirm the diagnostic significance of IgA-EmA for patients with suspected coeliac disease and their value for monitoring treatment even in young children (below 2 years).},

The area of gastric erosions and TBA-reactive substances in gastric mucosa were significantly increased after 30 and 60 min of reperfusion. The serum alpha-tocopherol-cholesterol ratio and gastric mucosal alpha-tocopherol were significantly decreased after 30 and 60 min of reperfusion. On the other hand, in vitamin E-deficient rats, gastric mucosal injury induced by ischemia-reperfusion was more severe than that in vitamin E-nondeficient rats. These results indicate that vitamin E is consumed in the process of lipid peroxidation induced by oxygen radicals in ischemia-reperfusion to prevent the development of tissue damage.},
