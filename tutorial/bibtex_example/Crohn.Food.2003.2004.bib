   abstract = {InKine Pharmaceutical Co. is developing an oral compound, CBP 1011, for the treatment of immune thrombocytopenic purpura (ITP) [Hematrol] and for the treatment of inflammatory bowel disorders, ulcerative colitis and Crohn's disease (Colirest). This profile has been selected from R&D Insight, a pharmaceutical intelligence database produced by Adis International Ltd. CBP 1011 or medroxyprogesterone, is a progesterone agonist and inhibits pro-inflammatory mediators such as interleukin-6 and tumour necrosis factor (TNF). CBP 1011 was originally developed by CorBec Pharmaceuticals, which in 1997 was aquired by Panax and then intergrated into InKine Pharmaceuticals. According to a company spokesperson, InKline is pursuing outlicensing opportunities for Hematrol since the company's current commercial focus is on gastrointestinal products. In June 2000, InKine announced the completion of a study comparing the bioavailability of a commercially viable tablet formulation of CBP 1011 to the original capsule formulation that is currently being used in the company's phase III studies in patients with idiopathic thrombocytopenic purpura. Preliminary results from this study indicate that the bioavailability of the tablet formulation does not differ significantly from that of the capsule formulation. The trial enrolled ITP patients (i) who are HIV positive, (ii) who are chronic ITP sufferers despite having had a splenectomy, (iii) who are older, or (iv) who have less severe thrombocytopenia. In preclinical trials, CBP 1011 was shown to decrease lymphocyte infiltration into the bowel compared with the control. Studies also show that it possibly offers safety benefits over steroid therapies. In June 2001, InKine commenced enrolment for a pivotal phase III trial in the treatment of Crohn's disease. This randomised, double-blind trial will enrol approximately 250 patients and will compare two doses of CBP 1011 (400 and 1000mg) with placebo. In April 2003, the US Patent and Trademark Office granted InKine Pharmaceutical a 'Notice of Allowance' for the 'Method of Treating Inflammatory Conditions with Progesterone or Progesterone Analogs'. This patent for medroxyprogesterone (Colirest) provides InKine patent protection for the use of Colirest in treating patients with Crohn's disease, ulcerative colitis, proctitis, microscopic colitis, allergic eosinophilic gastroenteritis, food allergies, drug-induced oesophagitis, coeliac disease, recurrent polyps and haemorrhoids. The patent protection also covers Colirest in a variety of delivery forms such as tablet, enema, suppository, foam, gel, ointment and suspension.},

   abstract = {Natural resistance-associated macrophage protein 1 (Nramp1) is a proton/divalent cation antiporter exclusively expressed in monocyte/macrophage cells with a unique role in innate resistance to intraphagosomal pathogens. In humans, it is linked to several infectious diseases, including leprosy, pulmonary tuberculosis, visceral leishmaniasis, meningococcal meningitis, and human immunodeficiency virus as well as to autoimmune diseases such as rheumatoid arthritis and Crohn's disease. Here we demonstrate that the restricted expression of Nramp1 is mediated by the macrophage-specific transcription factor IRF-8. This factor exerts its activity via protein-protein interaction, which facilitates its binding to target DNA. Using yeast two-hybrid screen we identified Myc Interacting Zinc finger protein 1 (Miz-1) as new interacting partner. This interaction is restricted to immune cells and takes place on the promoter Nramp1 in association with PU.1, a transcription factor essential for myelopoiesis. Consistent with these data, IRF-8 knockout mice are sensitive to a repertoire of intracellular pathogens. Accordingly, IRF-8-/- mice express low levels of Nramp1 that can not be induced any further. Thus, our results explain in molecular terms the role of IRF-8 in conferring innate resistance to intracellular pathogens and point to its possible involvement in autoimmune diseases.},

The newest therapies for these inflammatory conditions include the TNF biologic response modifiers infliximab, etanercept, and adalimumab. Adalimumab is a human recombinant immunoglobulin G1 anti-TNF monoclonal antibody. As monotherapy, or in combination with methotrexate or other traditional disease-modifying antirheumatic drugs, adalimumab can produce improvements in the signs and symptoms associated with rheumatoid arthritis and can slow progression of the joint destruction. The adverse effect profile of adalimumab seems to be comparable to that of etanercept. Adalimumab also seems to be useful in the treatment of psoriasis, psoriatic arthritis, and Crohn's disease; however, none of these indications are approved by the US Food and Drug Administration, and the optimal dosing regimen for these indications has not been established.},

We have designed the first randomized, controlled trial for elemental diets containing different fat percentages in patients with active Crohn's disease. METHODS: Each patient was randomized to receive one of three dose levels of fat in an elemental diet (Elental) for 4 weeks: 10 patients received low fat (3.06 g/day), 10 patients received medium fat (16.56 g/day) and eight patients received high fat (30.06 g/day). The additional fat was composed of long-chain fatty acids. All patients were evaluated using the International Organization of Inflammatory Bowel Disease rating, plus C-reactive protein level and erythrocyte sedimentation rate, which were measured at weekly intervals. RESULTS: Although the International Organization of Inflammatory Bowel Disease rating, C-reactive protein level and erythrocyte sedimentation rate in the low-fat group decreased, the values in the medium- and high-fat groups fluctuated during the study. The remission rate after 4 weeks in each group was 80%, 40% and 25% for patients in the low-, medium- and high-fat groups, respectively. CONCLUSIONS: When the fat consisted of long-chain triglycerides, a high amount of this fat in the elemental diet formula decreased its therapeutic effect against active Crohn's disease.},

   abstract = {Johne's disease, a chronic inflammatory disease caused by infection with Mycobacterium avium subspecies paratuberculosis (M. paratuberculosis), is one of the most prevalent and costly diseases of dairy cattle worldwide. This ruminant pathogen is closely related to the ubiquitous animal and human pathogen Mycobacterium avium subspecies avium (M. avium), confounding the development of specific diagnostic reagents. Exacerbating this problem further is that most existing microbiological, serological, and immunologic assays for the identification of infected animals are inadequate. This is primarily because of the slow-growing nature of the organism, genetic intractability and the previous lack of information on M. paratuberculosis subspecies-specific genes or proteins that may enable the development of specific and sensitive assays. New detection tools are critically needed to definitively answer questions surrounding M. paratuberculosis as a foodborne pathogen as well as aid in determining if it is a contributing factor in Crohn's disease. Thus, the recent characterization of the complete genome sequence of M. paratuberculosis in our laboratories has been a major step forward in meeting this need. We have performed studies that utilize genomic information for the identification of specific DNA sequences and protein antigens in M. paratuberculosis. Based on a preliminary in silico comparison of the M. paratuberculosis genome sequence with that of M. avium, we have now identified at least 35 novel coding sequences that are unique to M. paratuberculosis. These in silico data were then confirmed and expanded by PCR amplification analysis with DNA from several species and isolates of mycobacteria. Finally, these unique sequences have been incorporated into an antigen discovery project that may allow reliable detection of the bacterium in antigen-based diagnostic tests. Application of these new tools in addressing foodborne related issues of M. paratuberculosis is discussed.},

This review will discuss the mechanisms of biologicals (antibodies against pro-inflammatory cytokines, T cell antibodies, anti-inflammtory cytokines, adhesion molecule blockers, growth factors, hormones, colony stimulating factors, fusion proteins, anti-sense oligonucleotides, trefoil peptides, immunostimulatory [ISS] DNA) used in the treatment of inflammatory bowel disease and summarizes the available data on established biologic therapies as well as investigational agents and briefly touch on probiotics.

   abstract = {There is renewed enthusiasm for exploring the possibility that Mycobacterium paratuberculosis may be causative in Crohn's disease (CD). We aimed to determine whether CD subjects are more likely to be M. paratuberculosis seropositive than controls. Using our population-based University of Manitoba Inflammatory Bowel Disease Research Registry, we recruited CD and ulcerative colitis (UC) subjects between 18 and 50 years of age for a study involving detailed questionnaires and venipuncture. We accessed the population-based databases of Manitoba Health (single provincial health insurer) to get age-, gender-, and geography-matched controls to our inflammatory bowel disease (IBD) population. We asked enrolling IBD subjects for potential nonaffected sibling controls. We used an enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay (ELISA) for serum antibodies to M. paratuberculosis initially developed for cattle but adapted for human use. The rate of positive ELISA results, based on previously published interpretation criteria, was significantly higher for all study groups. There was no difference in M. paratuberculosis seropositivity rate among CD patients (37.8%; n = 283), UC patients (34.7%; n = 144), healthy controls (33.6%; n = 402), and nonaffected siblings (34.1%; n = 138). For siblings, there was no correlation between M. paratuberculosis serological status and that of the corresponding IBD affected sibling. None of the demographic or questionnaire variables studied were predictive of M. paratuberculosis status. Subjects with CD and UC were less likely to have ingested unpasteurized milk and less likely to have had a non-tap water source as a primary water source. In conclusion, in this population-based case control study, the M. paratuberculosis seropositivity rate was approximately 35% for all groups and there was no difference in rates between CD patients, UC patients, healthy controls, or nonaffected siblings. The much higher rate of seropositivity for subjects from Manitoba, Canada, than for those from Denmark or Wisconsin cannot be obviously explained. While these data seem to refute any association of CD with M. paratuberculosis, the high seroprevalence in Manitobans raises the possibility that the high rates of CD in Manitoba could be related to high exposure rates for M. paratuberculosis. Hence, the possibility of an association between M. paratuberculosis and CD remains inconclusive.},

There has been considerable interest in the past in determining whether Mycobacterium avium subsp. paratuberculosis (M. avium) might be the etiologic agent in Crohn's disease since it causes a disease in cattle that is similar to Crohn's disease in humans. We aimed to determine if there was an association between Crohn's disease and infection with M. avium or other zoonotic agents and compared the findings with those for patients with ulcerative colitis, unaffected siblings of Crohn's disease patients, or population-based controls without inflammatory bowel disease. Patients under age 50 years with Crohn's disease or ulcerative colitis, unaffected siblings of patients, or healthy controls drawn from a population-based age- and gender-matched registry were enrolled in a study in which subjects submitted to a questionnaire survey and venipuncture. A nested cohort underwent colonoscopy plus biopsy. Samples were batched and submitted to PCR for the detection of M. avium and other zoonotic agents known to cause predominately intestinal disease in cattle, sheep, or swine. Only one patient with ulcerative colitis, no patients with Crohn's disease, and none of the sibling controls were positive for M. avium, whereas 6 of 19 healthy controls were positive for M. avium. Since the control subjects were significantly older than the case patients, we studied another 11 patients with inflammatory bowel disease who were older than age 50 years, and another single subject with ulcerative colitis was positive for M. avium. One other subject older than age 50 years with ulcerative colitis was positive for circovirus, a swine-borne agent of infection. In conclusion, by performing PCR with mucosal samples from patients with Crohn's disease and controls, no association between Crohn's disease and infection with M. avium or any of the other six zoonotic agents studied could be found.},

   abstract = {BACKGROUND: Rheumatic joint pain is a common extra-intestinal complication of inflammatory bowel disease (IBD). Because the high ratio of n-6 to n-3 fatty acids (FAs) of the Western diet might promote rheumatic disorders, we sought to compare the effects of short-term duodenal administration of n-3-rich seal oil and n-6-rich soy oil on IBD-related joint pain. METHODS: Nineteen patients with IBD-related joint pain were included in the study; 9 had Crohn disease and 10 had ulcerative colitis. Ten millilitres seal oil (n = 10) or soy oil (n = 9) was self-administered through a nasoduodenal feeding tube 3 times daily for 10 days. RESULTS: Compared with soy oil treatment, seal oil significantly reduced the duration of morning stiffness (P = 0.024), number of tender joints (P = 0.035), intensity of pain (P = 0.025) and the doctor's scoring of rheumatic disease activity (P = 0.025) at the end of the 10-day treatment period. Analysis of the effects as area under the curve (area between the curve and baseline, zero) for the entire period from start of treatment until 6 months' post-treatment suggested a long-lasting beneficial effect of seal oil administration on joint pain, whereas soy oil tended (not significantly) to aggravate the condition. Consistently, the serum ratios of n-6 to n-3 FAs (P < 0.01) and arachidonic acid to eicosapentaenoic acid (P < 0.01) were reduced after treatment with seal oil. CONCLUSION: The results suggest distinctive, differential prolonged effects on IBD-related joint pain of short-term duodenal administration of n-3-rich seal oil (significant improvement) and n-6-rich soy oil (tendency to exacerbation).},

   abstract = {BACKGROUND: Pathogenic adherent-invasive Escherichia coli have been isolated from ileal lesions of Crohn's disease. AIM: : To investigate the non-pathogenic E. coli strain Nissle 1917 (Mutaflor) as possible maintenance therapy in inflammatory bowel disease by testing its ability to prevent adherent-invasive E. coli strains from adhering to and invading human intestinal epithelial cells in vitro. METHODS: Bacterial adhesion to and invasion of intestinal epithelial cells (Intestine-407) were assessed by counting the colony-forming units. The inhibitory effect of E. coli Nissle 1917 was determined after co-incubation with adherent-invasive E. coli strains or after pre-incubation of the intestinal epithelial cells with this probiotic strain prior to infection with adherent-invasive E. coli strains. RESULTS: Strain Nissle 1917 exhibited dose- and time-dependent adherence to intestinal epithelial cells and inhibited the adhesion and invasion of various adherent-invasive E. coli strains. In co-infection experiments, the inhibitory effect on adherent-invasive E. coli adhesion reached 78-99.9%. Pre-incubation of intestinal epithelial cells with strain Nissle 1917 reduced adherent-invasive E. coli adhesion by 97.2-99.9%. The inhibitory effect on adherent-invasive E. coli invasion paralleled that on adhesion. CONCLUSION: As strong and significant inhibitory effects on adherent-invasive E. coli adhesion and invasion were observed in co-infection and pre-infection experiments, E. coli Nissle 1917 could be efficient for preventive or curative probiotic therapy in patients with Crohn's disease.},

   abstract = {BACKGROUND: Although it is widely recognized that the intake of so-called probiotic microorganisms is beneficial in chronic mucosal inflammation and topical allergic disease, the immunologic details explaining how such bacteria can exert these effects remain obscure. OBJECTIVE: We determined whether Lactobacillus rhamnosus can modulate T cell responses in vitro and in vivo. DESIGN: In vitro, human monocyte-derived dendritic cells (DCs) matured in the presence of L. rhamnosus were used to instruct naive CD4+ T cells; subsequently, the T cell response was assessed with the use of CD3/CD28 and interleukin (IL) 2. Cytokine production by ex vivo-stimulated naive cells and memory T cells was measured before and after oral supplementation with L. rhamnosus in 6 healthy volunteers and 6 patients with Crohn disease. RESULTS: A decreased T cell proliferation and cytokine production, especially of IL-2, IL-4, and IL-10, was observed in CD3/CD28-stimulated T cells derived from L. rhamnosus-matured DCs. This T cell hyporesponsiveness was associated with enhanced DC-T cell interaction and normal responsiveness of T cells for IL-2. In vivo oral supplementation of L. rhamnosus for 2 wk induced a similar T cell hyporesponsiveness, including impaired ex vivo T helper subsets 1 and 2 responses without up-regulation of immunoregulatory cytokines in cohorts of both healthy volunteers and patients with Crohn disease. CONCLUSIONS: We propose that L. rhamnosus modulates DC function to induce a novel form of T cell hyporesponsiveness; this mechanism might be an explanation for the observed beneficial effects of probiotic treatment in clinical disease.},

They have been used for centuries in the form of dairy-based fermented products, but the potential use of probiotics as a form of medical nutrition therapy has not received formal recognition. A detailed literature review (from 1950 through February 2004) of English-language articles was undertaken to find articles showing a relationship between probiotic use and medical conditions. Medical conditions that have been reportedly treated or have the potential to be treated with probiotics include diarrhea, gastroenteritis, irritable bowel syndrome, and inflammatory bowel disease (Crohn's disease and ulcerative colitis), cancer, depressed immune function, inadequate lactase digestion, infant allergies, failure-to-thrive, hyperlipidemia, hepatic diseases, Helicobacter pylori infections, genitourinary tract infections, and others. The use of probiotics should be further investigated for possible benefits and side-effects in patients affected by these medical conditions.},

   abstract = {Several lines of evidence link inflammatory bowel diseases to modifications of intestinal microflora. Epidemiologic and clinical data suggest a triggering role for select agents in ulcerative colitis and in Crohn disease. Experimental evidence indicates that intestinal microorganisms are needed for developing intestinal inflammation in IL-10 knockout mice, and this is associated with an increased number of adherent clostridia and a decrease of lactobacilli and bifidobacteria. It may be hypothesized that a host-agent-specific relationship leads to an abnormal immune response, which may be genetically driven in select inflammatory bowel diseases. However, different from adults, the pattern of intestinal microflora undergoes profound changes during the early stage of life, contributing to the development of the immune system. A close relationship exists between microbiologic and immunologic imprinting. The microbiologic imprinting in neonates may be modified using bacterial probiotics that colonize the intestine, modify the immune response, and decrease the risk for atopy. Probiotics may decrease the recurrences of inflammatory bowel diseases. Preliminary evidence of intestinal antiinflammatory effects has been detected in children with cystic fibrosis. Overall these data provide the rationale to investigate the interaction between intestinal microflora and the local and general immune response in children with, or at risk for, inflammatory bowel diseases. This approach may be a key for understanding the pathophysiology of intestinal inflammation and may disclose novel strategies to educate better the immune system, particularly during its developmental stage.},

   abstract = {PURPOSE OF REVIEW: This article describes the clinical papers published in 2002 and early 2003 on nutritional and metabolic derangement in inflammatory bowel disease. RECENT FINDINGS: Insulin-like growth factor 1 and Insulin-like growth factor binding protein 3 are decreased in inflammatory bowel disease, and disease therapy hardly reverses this situation. There are promising data on recombinant human growth hormone therapy in paediatric inflammatory bowel disease. Several papers have added some fuel to the debate on the prevalence and pathogenesis of metabolic bone disease in inflammatory bowel disease. Articles have been published investigating the role of dietary fat in the therapeutic action of enteral feeding in Crohn's disease. Low-fat diets are particularly useful, and adding medium-chain triglycerides does not impair the effectiveness of these diets. Balanced amounts of saturated, monounsaturated and polyunsaturated fat should probably be used. Relevant contributions on the usefulness of probiotic preparations (VSL#3) in the treatment and prevention of pouchitis have been published. Other papers deal with the effects of medical and surgical therapy on body composition and metabolism in the inflammatory bowel disease, the treatment of oxidative stress of these patients, and the possible role of some vitamin deficiencies on thrombotic risk in the condition. SUMMARY: Inflammatory bowel disease therapy hardly reverses growth hormone-insulin-like growth factor 1 disturbances of patients. The role of inflammation and steroid therapy of metabolic bone disease in inflammatory bowel disease is still controversial. Low-fat diets, with added amounts of medium-chain triglycerides, are useful in decreasing gut inflammation in the condition. The search for the optimal dietary fatty acid composition deserves further investigations. The use of probiotics and prebiotics opens new therapeutic perspectives for the disease.},

   abstract = {Gut-associated lymphoid tissue (GALT) is the largest lymphoid organ in the body. This is not surprising considering the huge load of antigens (Ags) from food and commensal bacteria with which it interacts on a daily basis. Gut-associated lymphoid tissue has to recognise and allow the transfer of beneficial Ags whilst concurrently dealing with and successfully removing putative and overtly harmful Ags. This distinctive biological feature of GALT is believed to be crucial to good health. Deregulation or dysfunction of GALT is thought to predispose to inflammatory bowel diseases (IBD) such as ulcerative colitis and Crohn's disease. The exact mechanism(s) underlying the pathogenesis of IBD is (are) poorly understood and the immunological defects in GALT are poorly documented. Advances in immunology have highlighted the importance of dendritic cells (DCs), which are the key Ag presenting cells in tissues and lymphoid compartments. Their crucial role in GALT, in health and disease is discussed in this review. Interaction of DCs with T cells in the gut produces a subset of T lymphocytes, which have immunosuppressive function. Inappropriate Ag uptake and presentation to naive T cells in mesenteric lymph nodes may lead to T cell tolerance in GALT. These various complex factors in the gut are discussed and their possible relevance to IBD evaluated.},

   abstract = {The precise cause(s) of Crohn's disease and ulcerative colitis are unknown. From animal models and human studies it is well established that gut bacterial flora are essential for inducing the bowel inflammation. Animal models, when kept in a germ-free environment, do not develop colitis until the gut flora is reconstituted. It is not clear whether the bacterial antigens (Ags) from the normal flora or some other pathogenic bacterial Ags induce/propagate the inflammatory process in inflammatory bowel disease (IBD). Despite extensive research it has not been possible to identify any specific bacteria or virus as a credible cause of IBD. Recent understanding of quorum sensing molecules (QSMs) secreted by bacteria helps to explain the community behaviour in bacterial species. When QSMs reach a defined concentration, they activate bacterial proliferation and a number of virulence genes. Also, these molecules have been found to modulate the immune system to the advantage of the gut bacteria. They have not been well studied, however, in the gut. Inappropriate secretion of QSMs may alter the gut-associated lymphoid tissue (GALT) and, thereby, deregulate the immune tolerance normally present. Usefulness of probiotics and their immune modulating effects are being increasingly reported. Probiotics are also being used in the treatment of IBD. The interaction between the epithelial cells and the gut flora is very important as this is the first line of contact; this interaction may determine the induction of tolerance and mucosal integrity or immune activity, tissue inflammation and abnormal permeability. The latter is documented in patients with IBD and their healthy relatives. This may be an important factor in disruption of mucosal integrity and GALT dysfunction.},

   abstract = {Probiotics and prebiotics are the sort of therapy that most patients with inflammatory bowel disease (IBD) wish for. They are without significant side effects, except possibly an increase in gas with prebiotics, and so far, appear to be entirely safe. However, are they effective? More than a dozen studies using probiotics in IBD have now been reported, and there is dear benefit in pouchitis and possibly also in Crohn's, although there are so many clinical types of this condition that a clear indication has yet to emerge. For ulcerative colitis (UC) more studies are needed. The use of prebiotics in IBD is only just starting, although significant effects on both the luminal and mucosa-associated flora have been demonstrated in healthy subjects. Antibiotics offer more certain hope in IBD treatment, although with a much greater risk of unwanted effects. Their efficacy in clinical studies varies, with Crohn's disease and pouchitis reporting more benefit than ulcerative colitis. However, the ideal combination of antibiotics, and rationale for their use has not been determined.},

   abstract = {OBJECTIVES: The use of complementary and alternative medicines (CAM) appears increasingly prevalent in children and adolescents. Individuals with chronic illness may have patterns of greater usage. This questionnaire-based study aimed to ascertain the frequency of use by a group of children with proven inflammatory bowel disease (IBD) and to consider the reasons for their use. METHODS: A questionnaire was sent by mail to the parents of patients currently attending a paediatric IBD clinic. Parents were asked to describe their child's usage of alternative and probiotic therapies and to comment on a number of aspects of such therapies. RESULTS: Forty-six (77%) of 60 mailed questionnaires were returned. The mean age of the children was 10.9 (+/- 4.1) years and they were taking an average of 1.7 (+/- 0.8) prescribed medications. Thirty-three (72%) of the children were said by their parents to be having CAM, with four having five or more such therapies (average 2.4 +/- 1.3 agents per child). The most commonly used agents were probiotics (78%) and fish oils (56%). A minority (12%) of respondents reported that their child's CAM was very effective, although many (50%) noted partial benefits. The 13 children who had never used any CAM therapies ('non-users') did not differ from the 'users' in terms of gender, age, disease or duration of disease. As expected, non-users expressed greater concerns about use of CAM and described different attitudes towards such therapies. CONCLUSION: Complementary and alternative medicines, especially probiotic therapies, frequently are administered to children and adolescents with inflammatory bowel disease. Often this appears to be due to parental frustration with managing their child's chronic illness. Practitioners caring for children and adolescents with IBD need to be aware that their patients may be using alternative therapies and adopt an open attitude in this situation.},

   abstract = {BACKGROUND: There is a high prevalence of osteopenia among patients with Crohn's disease (CD). There is some evidence that a deficiency of certain bone-active nutrients (including vitamins K and D) may have a partial role in this bone loss. AIMS: To compare the intake and the status of vitamin K in CD patients, currently in remission, with age- and sex-matched controls, and furthermore to investigate the relationship between vitamin K status and bone turnover in these patients. SUBJECTS: CD patients (n = 44; mean age: 36.9 yr) and matched controls (n = 44) were recruited from the Cork University Hospital and Cork City area, respectively. METHODS: Bloods were analyzed for the total and undercarboxylated (Glu)-osteocalcin and urine analyzed for cross-linked N-telopeptides of type I collagen (NTx). Vitamin K(1) intake was estimated by food frequency questionnaire. RESULTS: Vitamin K(1) intake in CD patients tended to be lower than that of controls (mean (SD), 117 (82) vs 148 (80) mug/d, respectively; p= 0.059). Glu and NTx concentrations in CD patients were higher than controls (mean (SD), 5.1 (3.1) vs 3.9 (2.1) ng/ml, respectively; p= 0.03 for Glu; and 49 (41) vs 25.8 (19.5) nM BCE/mM creatinine, respectively; p= 0.001 for NTx). In CD patients, Glu was significantly correlated with NTx (r= 0.488; p < 0.001), even after controlling for age, gender, vitamin D status, calcium intake, and corticosteroid use. CONCLUSION: Vitamin K status of CD patients was lower than that of the healthy controls. Furthermore, the rate of bone resorption in the CD was inversely correlated with vitamin K status, suggesting that it might be another etiological factor for CD-related osteopenia.},

Regarding DNA damage leading to cancer development in the absence of human milk protection, a comparison between infants fed human milk and cow's milk has been performed. Each group consisted of 35 infants, whose ages ranged from 9 to 12 months. The level of DNA damage in the peripheral blood lymphocytes of infants has been studied by the comet assay. A significant increase has been found in the number of limited DNA-damaged (p < 0.001) and extensive DNA-damaged (p < 0.001) cells of infants fed cow's milk. To our knowledge, this is the first study using the comet assay on infants not breast-fed. Supporting our previous SCE study, these results suggest that there is some level of DNA damage in the lymphocytes of infants not breast-fed and this may lead to malignancy in childhood or later in life.},

   abstract = {This overview summarises available pharmacokinetic data on budesonide capsules (Entocort EC), approved for the treatment of mild-to-moderate active Crohn's disease involving the ileum and/or ascending colon and for prolongation of symptom control. Budesonide is a locally-acting glucocorticosteroid with an extensive, primarily hepatic, metabolism after oral administration. It is rapidly absorbed and biotransformed by cytochrome P450 (CYP) 3A to metabolites with negligible glucocorticoid activity. Entocort EC, a pH- and time-dependent oral formulation of budesonide, was developed to optimise drug delivery to the ileum and throughout the colon. Pharmaco-scintigraphic studies have confirmed that the Entocort EC formulation delays budesonide absorption and prolongs the rate of elimination but maintains complete absorption. This improves the delivery of budesonide to the intestinal lumen relative to a plain formulation. A low systemic availability of 9-21% indicates extensive first-pass elimination. Food appears to have little impact on the absorption of budesonide from Entocort EC capsules and the pharmacokinetics are dose-proportional between 3 and 15 mg. On average, systemic availability was 2.5-fold higher in patients with cirrhosis compared with healthy controls; however, mild liver impairment had little effect on systemic exposure. Pharmacokinetics appear unaffected by gender and age, although this has not been tested in younger children. Renal impairment is not expected to have an impact on the kinetics of Entocort EC. Budesonide is unlikely to inhibit the metabolism of other drugs, including CYP3A4 substrates, mainly because of the very low plasma concentrations obtained with the compound even after high doses of Entocort trade mark EC capsules. Strong CYP3A4 inhibitors, such as ketoconazole, will inhibit the metabolism of budesonide, resulting in several-fold increases in the area under the concentration-time curve of budesonide. Also, grapefruit juice intake may increase systemic availability of budesonide, probably by inhibition of intestinal CYP3A4 activity. Unlike prednisolone, oral contraceptives do not alter plasma budesonide concentrations. An increased pH obtained by gastric acid inhibitory drugs, such as omeprazole, does not affect the pharmacokinetics of budesonide. In summary, budesonide capsules (Entocort EC) possess many pharmacological features that make the formulation well adapted for a targeted treatment of inflammatory disorders, such as Crohn's disease involving the ileum and ascending colon.},

There has been a special focus on dietary factors, as well as on other exposures introduced on a population-based level, including fast food, cola drinks, toothpaste, antibiotics and oral contraceptives. The aim of this review is to critically assess the results from the different observational studies that have investigated these hypotheses, and also to propose research agendas that should be pursued in the future. The conclusion is that infectious exposures and early bacterial colonization, which are associated with better hygiene early in life and that influence immune function, and possibly oral contraceptives, remain the only exposures of interest for future research into the aetiology of ulcerative colitis and Crohn's disease.},

   abstract = {BACKGROUND: Iron deficiency anaemia is a frequent complication of Crohn disease. Treatment with ferrous iron (Fe2-) compounds is often unsatisfactory and is associated with gastrointestinal side effects. Theoretically, oral iron supplementation may even be harmful, because iron may reinforce intestinal inflammation by catalysing production of reactive oxygen species. We investigated the effect of ferrous iron on disease activity and plasma antioxidant status in patients with active Crohn disease. METHODS: Ten patients with Crohn disease and iron deficiency and 10 healthy controls were given ferrous fumarate 120 mg for 7 days. The Crohn Disease Activity Index, gastrointestinal complaints and blood samples for antioxidant status, anaemia, inflammation and iron absorption were investigated on day 1 and day 8. RESULTS: During 1 week of ferrous fumarate supplementation, the Crohn Disease Activity Index tended to increase (P = 0.071). Patients experienced aggravation of diarrhoea, abdominal pain and nausea. Plasma-reduced cysteine was lower (P = 0.038) in patients than it was in controls. One week of ferrous iron supplementation further decreased reduced cysteine (P < 0.001) and significantly decreased plasma-reduced glutathione (P = 0.004) in the patients. Serum iron increased significantly in patients after an oral iron load test (from 5.8 +/- 3.2 micromol/L to 30.9 +/- 13.1 micromol/L). CONCLUSIONS: Treatment of iron deficiency with ferrous fumarate deteriorated plasma antioxidant status and increased specific clinical symptoms in patients with active Crohn disease. Plasma reduced cysteine may be a sensitive indicator for oxidative stress in the intestine.},

   abstract = {Inflammatory bowel disease, such as ulcerative colitis and Crohn's disease, results from an interaction between susceptibility genes, the host's bacterial environment, gut barrier defects, and immunological factors. New management approaches have been evolved from advances in our understanding of the pathobiology of this common gut disorder In particular, the therapeutic manipulation of the bacterial microenvironment in the gut seems to offer an innovative tool for the treatment of those patients. Since the gut is a highly sensitizing organ that contributes to the systemic immune response, potent treatments need to be developed to reduce gut inflammation in this disorder. Recent studies have demonstrated that probiotic lactobacilli, and also immunostimulatory DNA sequences from those same bacteria have an important anti-inflammatory potential in this context. Future research should better define among patients with inflammatory bowel disease the various clinical phenotypes with the greatest potential of response to probiotic treatment. Identification of the genes leading to the disease and a rather better understanding of the underlying immunoregulatory abnormalities will be crucial steps to define the different profiles of interaction between endogenous digestive bacterial flora and the immune system in each individual patient. Such advances will probably lead to targeting of effective treatments, including bacteriotherapy with probiotic lactobacilli, to subsets of patients with inflammatory bowel disease.},

   abstract = {The demonstration that immune and epithelial cells can discriminate between different microbial species has extended our understanding of the actions of probiotics beyond simple barrier and antimicrobial concepts. Several probiotic mechanisms of action, relative to inflammatory bowel disease, have been elucidated: (1) competitive exclusion, whereby probiotics compete with microbial pathogens for a limited number of receptors present on the surface epithelium; (2) immunomodulation and/or stimulation of an immune response of gut-associated lymphoid and epithelial cells; (3) antimicrobial activity and suppression of pathogen growth; (4) enhancement of barrier function; and (5) induction of T cell apoptosis in the mucosal immune compartment. The unraveling of these mechanisms of action has led to new support for the use of probiotics in the management of clinical inflammatory bowel disease. Though level 1 evidence now supports the therapeutic use of probiotics in the treatment of postoperative pouchitis, only levels 2 and 3 evidence is currently available in support of the use of probiotics in the treatment of ulcerative colitis and Crohn's disease. Nevertheless, one significant and consistent finding has emerged during the course of research in the past year: not all probiotic bacteria have similar therapeutic effects. Rigorously designed, controlled clinical trials are vital to investigate the unresolved issues related to efficacy, dose, duration of use, single or multi-strain formulation, and the concomitant use of probiotics, synbiotics, or antibiotics.},

   abstract = {This comprehensive review promotes the novel concept that a defensin deficiency, i.e. lack of mucosal peptide antibiotics, may play a pivotal role in the aetiopathogenesis of Crohn's disease. Such an impaired function of this chemical barrier is consistent with the epidemiological relationship of good domestic hygiene with the incidence of inflammatory bowel diseases. The disregulated adaptive immune system, formerly believed to be the major cause in the development of Crohn's disease, may reflect only the primary break of the mucosal defence since the immune response is mostly directed against lumenal bacteria. Recent work has identified five different defensins expressed in colonic mucosa. In contrast to ulcerative colitis, Crohn's disease is characterised by an impaired induction of human beta defensins 2 and 3. This deficient induction may be due to changes in the intracellular transcription by NFkappaB and the intracellular peptidoglycan receptor NOD2, mutated in Crohn's disease. These findings are consistent with the mucosal attachment of lumenal bacteria in inflammatory bowel diseases and the frequent occurrence of other infectious agents. The hypothesis of an impaired mucosal antibacterial activity is also consistent with the benefit from antibiotic or probiotic treatment in certain inflammatory bowel disease states.},

Their major role in preventing and treating gastrointestinal disease appears to be from their effect on the immune process, protection against abnormal invasive bacteria, and in the production of short-chain fatty acids from starch and non-starch polysaccharides. Probiotic microorganisms are administered in food supplements and yogurts. They are also now sold in the form of capsules and powders. There is great variation in the microorganisms in the various supplements. It is important to understand that all probiotic products are different. Some contain a single organism and others contain multiple organisms. Therapeutic results have been achieved with various probiotics in different diseases. In the treatment of inflammatory bowel diseases (IBD), success has been reported with Escherichia coli Nissle strain in ulcerative colitis, and with a multiple organism product, VSL#3 (VSL Pharmaceuticals, Fort Lauderdale, FL), in Crohn's disease and pouchitis. Initial reports in irritable bowel syndrome (IBS) have resulted in encouraging results with the use of E. coli Nissle strain, and recently with multiple organism probiotic supplements. However, caution must still apply to the use of probiotics in IBD and IBS because the reports and the number of patients treated are limited.},

   abstract = {Nutrients may be involved in the modulation of the immune response through at least three different mechanisms. First, the intestinal ecosystem plays a pivotal role in the pathogenesis of inflammatory bowel disease, triggering the uncontrolled inflammatory response in genetically predisposed individuals. Nutrients, together with bacteria, are major components of, and can therefore influence, the intestinal environment. Second, as components of cell membranes, nutrients can mediate the expression of proteins involved in the immune response, such as cytokines, adhesion molecules and nitric oxide synthase. The composition of lipids in the cell membrane is modified by dietary changes and can influence cellular responses. Indeed, various epidemiological, experimental and clinical data suggest that the immune response may be sensitive to changes in dietary composition. Finally, suboptimal levels of micronutrients are often found in both children and adults with inflammatory bowel disease, although, with the exception of iron and folate, it is unusual to discover symptoms attributable to these deficits. However, subclinical deficits may have a pathophysiological significance, as they may favour the self-perpetuation of the disease (due to defects in the mechanisms of tissue repair), cause defective defence against damage produced by oxygen free radicals and facilitate lipid peroxidation. These events can occur even in clinically inactive or mildly active disease, as well as in the development of dysplasia in the intestinal mucosa. Some dietary manipulations have been attempted as primary treatment for rheumatoid arthritis, and specially formulated diets for enteral nutrition have proved to be an effective treatment for Crohn's disease. Most trials, although lacking sufficient patient numbers, have demonstrated a role for dietary manipulation as primary therapy for inflammatory disease. Dietary lipids are one of the most active nutritional substrates modulating the immune response. Recently, it has been demonstrated that lipids may be a key factor explaining the therapeutic effect of clinical nutrition in Crohn's disease.},

   abstract = {BACKGROUND: In the short bowel syndromes (SBS) it is often difficult to grant a correct and sufficient alimentary supply only by ordinary natural nutrition. In the present research, we will study the prospective possibilities of integrating the nutritional supply making resort to artificial nutrition techniques in patients with SBS. METHODS: We have treated 7 patients with SBS, 6 males and 1 female, whose age was ranging from 29 and 70 years. They all underwent wide intestinal resection, 2 of them for massive infarct, 4 for Crohn's disease, 1 for bowel volvolus. An evaluation of nutritional and immunological conditions was performed on all of them, determining: albumin, transferrin, C-reactive protein, prealbumin, leukocyte count, skin test. In a second time, a protocol was implemented, based on total parenteral nutrition for the first 5 days, with scalar calorie supply up to a total of 35 kcal/kg/die; on day 6 after the operation, the parenteral caloric supply was reduced of 500 kcal/die, being compensated by the introduction of an equal caloric ration by nasointestinal tube with peristaltic pump having a flow of 20 mL/h. In the following days, the parenteral caloric supply was reduced of 500 cal each 48 hours, being substituted with an equal enteral supply in order to progressively reach a complete abandonment of parenteral nutrition. RESULTS: All the patients have a follow-up of 2 to 5 years; today they follow a high-calorie hyperglycidic, hypolipidic diet; no signs of malnutrition are shown by clinical and laboratory analysis. CONCLUSIONS: In the light of the data in our possession, it can be understood that nutritional therapy is the main treatment for SBS; parenteral subministration has to be abandoned during the postoperatory course to give way to enteral nutrition, in order to create a physiological stimulus able to make the digestive system rapidly adapt to the new situation.},

   abstract = {The ability to target and neutralize macrophage-derived inflammatory cytokines, particularly tumor necrosis factor-alpha (TNF-alpha), has emerged in recent years as one of the most important advances in the treatment of rheumatoid arthritis, Crohn's disease, and several other systemic inflammatory diseases. In rheumatoid arthritis, for example, these biological agents rapidly reduce signs and symptoms of joint inflammation and profoundly slow the progression of joint damage. However, data that have emerged following Food and Drug Administration approval of these agents have alerted clinicians to an increased likelihood of opportunistic infections in patients treated with these agents, particularly tuberculosis. The effect of TNF inhibition on the frequency of infection with more common bacterial pathogens is less clear. Animal models of tuberculosis and other opportunistic infections have demonstrated the importance of TNF-alpha in controlling and containing intracellular pathogens. The spectrum of infections reported to date in the setting of anti-TNF-alpha treatment is reviewed here. In addition, relevant animal data illustrating potential mechanistic roles for TNF-alpha in host responses to infection are also reviewed.},

   abstract = {Major advances in the understanding of the aetio-pathogenesis and genetics of inflammatory bowel disease have been accompanied by an escalation in the sophistication of immunomodulatory inflammatory bowel disease therapeutics. However, the basic 'triple' therapy (5-aminosalicylates, corticosteroids, azathioprine) and nutrition have maintained their central role in the management of patients with inflammatory bowel disease over recent decades. This review provides an overview of the supportive and therapeutic perspectives of nutrition in adult inflammatory bowel disease. The objective of supportive nutrition is to correct malnutrition in terms of calorie intake or specific macro- or micronutrients. Of particular clinical relevance is deficiency in calcium, vitamin D, folate, vitamin B12 and zinc. There is justifiably a growing sense of unease amongst clinicians and patients with regard to the long-term use of corticosteroids in inflammatory bowel disease. This, rather than arguments about efficacy, should be the catalyst for revisiting the use of enteral nutrition as primary treatment in Crohn's disease. Treatment failure is usually related to a failure to comply with enteral nutrition. Potential factors that militate against successful completion of enteral nutrition are feed palatability, inability to stay on a solid-free diet for weeks, social inconvenience and transient feed-related adverse reactions. Actions that can be taken to improve treatment outcome include the provision of good support from dietitians and clinicians for the duration of treatment and the subsequent 'weaning' period. There is evidence to support a gradual return to a normal diet through exclusion-re-introduction or other dietary regimen following the completion of enteral nutrition to increase remission rates. We also review the evidence for emerging therapies, such as glutamine, growth factors and short-chain fatty acids. The future may see the evolution of enteral nutrition into an important therapeutic strategy, and the design of a 'Crohn's disease-specific formulation' that is individually tailored, acceptable to patients, cost-effective, free from adverse side-effects and combines enteral nutrition with novel pre- and pro-biotics and other factors.},

   abstract = {The management of gastro-oesophageal reflux disease (GERD) continues to garner vast amounts of attention among physicians who care for adults. However, there is an increasing awareness of the fact that this disease, as well as several other lifelong digestive diseases (i.e. Crohn's disease) may actually have their origins in childhood. Paediatric gastro-oesophageal reflux (GER) is likely to share a similar pathophysiology to adult GER, and mounting evidence from published preliminary data suggests a genetic susceptibility to GERD. However, further studies will be necessary to confirm this hypothesis. In children, GER has a distinct presentation from that in adults, with the diagnostic work-up based upon the patient's age as well as their presenting signs and symptoms. Like their adult counterparts, the early detection and treatment of GER in children may result in a better long-term outcome, improved quality-of-life, and a reduction in overall healthcare burden. While the treatment of GER in infants tends to be conservative (i.e. positioning during feeding, smaller feedings), its management in older children parallels that of adults and includes lifestyle changes and pharmacological therapy. However, with persistent symptoms, acid suppression is the mainstay of GERD management in both children and adults. Several studies in children have verified that acid suppression with a proton pump inhibitor is superior to histamine-2 receptor antagonists. Among the proton pump inhibitors, both lansoprazole and omeprazole have been the subject of published adult and paediatric studies demonstrating their short and long-term safety, in addition to their efficacy in a variety of oesophageal and supra-oesophageal GERD related conditions. These two proton pump inhibitors are manufactured as capsules containing enteric-coated granules that can be emptied into soft foods or liquids without compromising their pharmacological effects or pharmacokinetic properties. Lansoprazole is also available as a strawberry-flavoured suspension that is acceptable to children and as an oral disintegrating tablet.},

   abstract = {Nowadays. there is a growing interest in probiotics as a safe way of changing the intestinal bacterial flora. Probiotics may have potential in several gastroenterological conditions, especially when the intestinal flora has been disturbed. Most scientific evidence is available for diarrhoea patients treated with Lactobacillus GG, Lactobacillus reuteri or Saccharomyces boulardii. Meta-analyses have shown an overall reduction in the risk of antibiotic-associated diarrhoea during treatment with probiotics, and benefits have also been demonstrated for patients with rota-virus-associated diarrhoea. Patients with inflammatory bowel disease, an inflammatory disorder characterized by a change in the intestinal flora, are another important target group for which probiotics may be beneficial. It has been claimed that in ulcerative colitis and Crohn disease patients, lactobacilli, S. boulardii and Escherichia coli reduce relapses. but most studies were not placebo-controlled. A reduction in relapses has also been demonstrated in pouchitis patients treated with a multispecies probiotic. Irritable bowel syndrome might be another clinical indication for probiotic therapy, but results of clinical trials performed in these patients are inconsistent. Additionally, probiotics may improve lactose absorption. Helicobacter pylori eradication and constipation. Finally, in animal models of colorectal cancer, treatment with probiotics reduces the prevalence of this disease, and in humans the amount of genotoxic substances in faeces has been reduced. In conclusion, the results of studies on the effects of probiotics in gastrointestinal conditions are encouraging. but well-designed placebo-controlled studies are warranted before recommendations for therapeutic or preventive use can be given. Many issues still have to be resolved, including optimal dose and duration of treatment, selection of and differences between the several available probiotic strains, and, importantly, their mechanisms of actions have to be elucidated.},

   abstract = {Enteral nutrition is effective in inducing remission in active Crohn's disease. Speculation on the underlying mechanism of action has moved away from the presentation of nitrogen and towards the fat content of the various enteral feeds. Evidence is accumulating that additional long-chain triglyceride in such feeds impairs the response rate in active Crohn's disease, whereas no deleterious effects of additional medium-chain triglyceride have been identified. It has been proposed that long-chain triglycerides composed from n-6 fatty acids may be the most harmful, since such fatty acids are substrates for inflammatory eicosanoid production. However, recent studies comparing different enteral feeds are not consistent in identifying which additional fatty acids impair response rates to the greatest extent. Despite meta-analyses concluding that polymeric diets (typically containing large amounts of fat) are as effective as elemental diets, it would seem sensible to use enteral feeds with minimal fat content when treating active Crohn's disease.},

   abstract = {PURPOSE: Proctocolectomy with ileal pouch-anal anastomosis is the operation of choice for patients with refractory or fulminant ulcerative colitis. The most common long-term complication in these patients is pouchitis. This study was designed to investigate the efficacy of probiotic Lactobacillus rhamnosus GG in long-term delaying the first onset of pouchitis. METHODS: Between 1989 and 2001, a consecutive series of 127 patients presenting with ulcerative colitis underwent an ileal pouch-anal anastomosis at the Erasmus Medical Center in Rotterdam. Histopathologic investigation of the resected specimens revealed unsuspected Crohn's disease in five patients. Postoperative complications resulted in pouch excision in five patients. The remaining 117 patients were included in this study. All episodes of pouchitis occurring in this group were analyzed. Pouchitis was diagnosed on the basis of clinical symptoms and endoscopic and histologic features. The 39 patients, who underwent an ileal pouch-anal anastomosis between 1996 and 2001, started immediately after the operation with the daily intake of L. rhamnosus GG in a fermented product. The 78 patients, in whom an ileal pouch-anal anastomosis was performed between 1989 and 1996, received no L. rhamnosus GG. RESULTS: Except for the duration of follow-up, the patient characteristics, indications for proctocolectomy, number of postoperative complications, and functional outcome were similar in both groups. First episodes of pouchitis were observed less frequently in patients with a daily intake of L. rhamnosus GG (cumulative risk at 3 years: 7 vs. 29 percent; P = 0.011). CONCLUSIONS: Daily intake of fermented products containing L. rhamnosus GG provides significant clinical benefit, without side effects. Based on the results of this study, we recommend a daily intake of Lactobacillus rhamnosus GG (dose 1-2 x 10(10) bacteria) to delay the first onset of pouchitis.},

In a previous report, the non-pathogenic yeast Saccharomyces boulardii was found to be beneficial in the maintenance treatment of Crohn's disease. The aim of this study was to assess the efficacy of S. boulardii in ulcerative colitis patients. METHODS: A group of 25 patients with a mild to moderate clinical flare-up of ulcerative colitis received additional treatment with S. boulardii 250 mg three times a day for 4 weeks during maintenance treatment with mesalazine. These patients were unsuitable for steroid therapy. Before and after treatment, Rachmilewitz's clinical activity index was calculated. The probiotic treatment was considered a therapeutic success only when the final score was lower than 6. RESULTS: Of the 24 patients who completed the study, 17 attained clinical remission; this was confirmed endoscopically. CONCLUSIONS: Our preliminary results suggest that S. boulardii can be effective in the treatment of ulcerative colitis. Controlled studies with this probiotic agent are warranted.},

The introduction of infliximab has paved the way for additional anti-TNF strategies that have the potential to build on that drug's efficacy and safety profile. However, the anti-TNF strategies might not have identical efficacy and safety profiles and might differ in dosing compared with therapy for rheumatoid arthritis. Most recently, adalimumab has been approved by the US Food and Drug Administration for the treatment of rheumatoid arthritis and is undergoing evaluation in Crohn's disease, with promising initial results. This review discusses the results of controlled clinical trials of anti-TNF agents for Crohn's disease.},

   abstract = {The gut flora plays a fundamental role in maintaining normal intestinal function. A disturbance of this flora, or the host response to this flora, has been clearly demonstrated to play a role in the pathogenesis of inflammatory bowel disease (IBD). This has led to attempts to modify the bacterial flora with "live non-pathogenic organisms that confer health benefits by improving the microbial balance," otherwise known as probiotics. Recent attention has focused on this potential strategy to treat or prevent IBD. The potential therapeutic benefit is enhanced by the natural and apparently safe approach that probiotics offer. Animal models of colitis have provided the proof of principle that probiotics can prevent and treat established intestinal inflammation. Controlled clinical studies have demonstrated the efficacy of probiotics in the maintenance of remission of pouchitis, prophylaxis of pouchitis after the formation of an ileoanal reservoir, maintenance of remission of ulcerative colitis, and treatment of Crohn's disease. However, large controlled trials are needed to definitively establish the place for probiotics in the treatment of IBD and resolve issues such as the dose, duration, frequency of treatment, and use of single or multiple strains. Research is focusing on establishing the mechanism of action, so that treatments with individually tailored properties are developed and innovative approaches are explored.},

We examined the effects of postoperative nutritional therapy in patients with perforating type and non-perforating type Crohn's disease. METHODOLOGY: We retrospectively reviewed the records for 218 patients who underwent surgical interventions for Crohn's disease in our hospital between January 1, 1974 and September 30, 2001. They were divided into four groups: 92 patients in the non-perforating type (NP type) + Elemental Diet (ED) group had received ED therapy and nutritional education, 22 patients in the NP type + NoED group had not received ED therapy or nutritional education, 88 patients in the perforating type (P type) + ED group and 16 patients in P type + NoED group. We evaluated the incidence of reoperation rate for each group. RESULTS: Patients with a postoperative ED therapy demonstrated a significant decrease in the incidence of second resection. The incidence of second resection in the NP type + ED group was significantly lower than that of the other groups. The NP type + NoED group and the P type + ED group followed similar courses. CONCLUSIONS: In patients with Crohn's disease postoperative ED therapy and nutritional education is effective in reducing the incidence of second resection. It appears that postoperative ED therapy and nutritional education is more important in patients with P type Crohn's disease.},

   abstract = {Inflammatory bowel syndrome (IBS) mainly includes ulcerative colitis (UC) and Crohn's disease (CD). UC and CD are chronic and recurrent conditions, with a tendency to exacerbations and remissions. The incidence of diseases worldwide has increased over the last years. Although the etiology of inflammatory bowel syndrome has been studied intensively it still remains unclear. The development and persistence of inflammation is an effect of numerous factors: proinflammatory (aggressive), regulating bowel mucosa homeostasis and protective factors. Proinflammatory factors include intestinal bacteria, bile acids, digestive enzymes, lipopolysaccharides and peptidoglycans. Protective mechanisms are impermeability of mucosa barrier, presence of intestinal mucus, activity of secretive immunoglobulins, some prostaglandins and interleukins, glutamine, somatostatin, cortisol and short-chain fatty acids. Factors modifying intestinal mucosa homeostasis consist of genetically determined immunoregulators and activity of intestinal mucosa barrier and some environmental factors (diet, smoking, infections, stress, antibiotics and others). Environmental factors are jointly responsible for IBS occurrence in case of genetically determined dysregulation leading to proinflammatory cytokines overproduction or disturbances in synthesis of cytokines regulating intestinal mucosa homeostasis.},

   abstract = {The clinical management of Crohn's disease can be considered in relation to the treatment of acute disease and the maintenance of remission. The medication used to achieve these two goals may or may not be the same. Some patients with mildly active disease may respond to high-dose (4 g/day) mesalazine (mesalamine), and 5-aminosalicylic acid may also be helpful in weaning a patient off steroids after treatment for a flare-up. However, the value of 5-aminosalicylic acid in maintaining remission in Crohn's disease remains controversial. Subgroups of patients may be helped: for example, patients with Crohn's disease who have experienced a relapse within the last 2 years may benefit. Steroids form the first-line therapy for acute episodes of inflammation but do not maintain remission. Azathioprine and mercaptopurine are the first-line drugs for the maintenance of remission in moderate to severe Crohn's disease, and by titrating the dose up from 2 mg/kg daily, some previously resistant patients will be brought into remission. One-half of patients who do not tolerate azathioprine will tolerate mercaptopurine. Methotrexate is effective in inducing and maintaining remission, and is useful for patients who fail azathioprine treatment. Thalidomide is not proven in controlled studies, but two open studies have demonstrated its efficacy. The optimal dose, however, remains to be defined. Purified liquid diets with food exclusion can induce remission in patients with active disease, but food exclusion is difficult to maintain long term. Infliximab can induce and maintain remission in patients resistant to other therapies, with two-thirds of patients initially responding to treatment. One-third go into remission and, of those who respond to a single treatment, approximately one-half maintain remission when treated regularly for a year. Infliximab is, however, associated with an increased risk of infection, and its effect on cancer incidence is uncertain. The development of antibodies against the drug is associated with a loss of effect and allergic infusion reactions. In summary, simple proven therapies should be used first, because of their safety and benefit in some patients. However, aggressive therapy should be used when needed.},

(b) The available data regarding pouchitis are limited, but the therapeutic effect seems to be excellent. (c) In the case of Crohn's disease, the role of probiotics is not clearly defined, thus the results of new trials have to be awaited before probiotic therapy is recommended. (d) Further indications such as antibiotic-associated diarrhea, acute pancreatitis or irritable bowel syndrome have been reported recently. The results of these clinical trials have been encouraging, but they often included only a small number of patients and therefore a clear-cut assessment seems difficult at the moment.},

A proportion of CD patients develop antibodies against the yeast Saccharomyces cerevisiae (ASCA), but little is known about the cellular immune reactivity against food antigens in antibody-positive and -negative patients. METHODS: Lymphocytes from patients with CD, ulcerative colitis, and healthy controls were tested for their proliferative response after stimulation with the yeast antigen mannan and ovalbumin. The cellular phenotypes and activation markers were analyzed via FACS. Cytokine concentrations and antibody titers were determined by ELISA. RESULTS: Only lymphocytes of ASCA-positive patients with CD proliferated after stimulation with mannan. These lymphocytes expressed increased activation markers (CD25, CD69). Activation of T cells was mediated by antigen-presenting cells and was associated with increased tumor necrosis factor-alpha (TNF-alpha) levels. The immune reactivity to ovalbumin was predominantly found in CD patients. It was weaker compared with mannan, independent of ASCA status, and also present in healthy controls. CONCLUSIONS: A disturbed humoral and cellular response to the yeast antigen mannan is specifically seen in a subgroup of CD patients. This phenomenon may be due to a loss of tolerance toward yeast and is possibly genetically determined.},

   abstract = {Treatment with antibiotics in inflammatory bowel disease has a long tradition and is widely used. The indications for antibiotic therapy are wide ranging, from specific situations such as abscesses or fistulae, to patients with severe disease (as an unspecific 'protective' measure), and to address the hypothesis that the enteric flora as a whole, or specific microorganisms such as mycobacteria, are involved in the pathogenesis of inflammatory bowel disease. The best-studied single antibiotic compound is metronidazole. However, overall, the scientific basis for the use of antibiotics is limited, which may reflect a lack of interest from sponsors within the pharmaceutical industry. Despite this weak evidence base, antibiotics are a globally established therapeutic tool in inflammatory bowel disease. Growing evidence from human and animal studies points towards a pivotal pathogenetic role of intestinal bacteria in inflammatory bowel disease. In view of these experimental findings, clinical trials have been undertaken to elucidate the therapeutic effects of probiotics in inflammatory bowel disease. Probiotics are viable nonpathogenic microorganisms which confer health benefits to the host by improving the microbial balance of the indigenous microflora. So far, of the many candidates, one specific strain (Escherichia coli Nissle 1917) and a mixture of eight different bacteria have demonstrated convincing therapeutic efficacy in controlled studies. Maintenance therapy in ulcerative colitis and prevention therapy, as well as the treatment of pouchitis, have emerged as areas in which probiotic therapy offers a valid therapeutic alternative to current treatments. Further investigations may detect additional clinically effective probiotics and other clinical indications.},

Of the 38 patients with new-onset heart failure, 19 (50%) had no identifiable risk factors. Ten patients younger than 50 years of age developed new-onset heart failure after receiving TNF antagonists. After TNF antagonist therapy was discontinued and heart failure therapy was started in these 10 patients, 3 had complete resolution of heart failure, 6 improved, and 1 died. CONCLUSION: In a fraction of patients, TNF antagonists might induce new-onset heart failure or exacerbate existing disease.},

Eight patients with varying extents of intestinal resections due to Crohn's disease and six healthy controls participated. All subjects received 54 g SPC daily for 2 weeks. Plasma AF activity was determined before, during and after the treatment period. Baseline diet and medications were kept unchanged. The patients registered the daily number of bowel movements. The SPC diet increased AF activity in all controls. In the patients there was a significant correlation between the length of the remaining small intestine and AF induction (r=0.94, p<0.01) and only those patients with a remaining small intestine of about 3 m reached AF values comparable to those in healthy subjects. It is concluded that small bowel length is related to the ability of humans to induce AF activity by dietary means.},

AIM: The authors evaluated the efficacy of prefeeding Dunaliella bardawil, rich in beta-carotene, to ameliorate acid-induced enteritis in a rat model. METHODS: Enteritis was induced in female Sprague-Dawley rats by injection of 2 mL acetic acid (0.67 mol/L) to a ligated duodenal loop following 10 weeks of feeding diets containing beta-carotene and compared with various controls. The effects of beta-carotene were evaluated by changes in myeloperoxidase activity, histology, and histomorphometry. RESULTS: Feeding beta-carotene resulted in suppressed mucosal myeloperoxidase activity, both basal and that induced by acetic acid injection. Acetic acid treatment induced major histopathologic changes in the duodenal mucosa, including small, irregular, and distorted villi; damage to the epithelium; edema of the lamina propria; accumulation of inflammatory cells; and hemorrhage. Beta-carotene treatment prevented these acid-induced histopathologic changes, and this was confirmed by histomorphometry of the villi. CONCLUSIONS: These results demonstrate the effectiveness of beta-carotene in a rat model as a prophylactic dietary measure in reducing the effects of acid-induced enteritis and raise the possibility that patients with Crohn's disease may benefit from the consumption of natural beta-carotene.},

The possibilities of the therapeutic use of probiotics, in particular for cases of Crohn's disease, viral gastroenteritis and travelers' diarrhea are discussed. The conclusion is made that the effectiveness of the use of probiotics has not yet been proved due to the fact that in clinical trials of these preparations many uncontrolled variables are not taken into consideration. For this reason at the present moment the prophylactic and curative use of probiotics is an idea whose constructive character has yet to be proved.},

   abstract = {Recent controlled and uncontrolled trial data in inflammatory bowel disease have suggested several new avenues of possible therapies and refined our understanding of the uses and selectiveness of anti-tumor necrosis factor (TNF)-based therapies. Infliximab remains the only proven effective anti-TNF therapy, whereas others have proven ineffective (etanercept, CDP-571) or of limited utility (thalidomide, CDP-870). A Crohn's disease Clinical trial Evaluating infliximab in a New long-term Treatment regimen (ACCENT I) and ACCENT II trials supported the strategy of using 5 to 10 mg/kg of infliximab on an every 8-week basis for maintenance of remission, although in clinical practice many physicians take variable approaches to maintenance of remission dosing schedules. On the other hand, no controlled trial data to date have supported the use of infliximab in ulcerative colitis. Therapies utilizing novel mechanistic approaches, such as hematopoietic growth factors, mitogen-activated protein (MAP)-kinase inhibition, and peroxisome proliferator activated receptor gamma ligand receptor binding have shown promise in small uncontrolled trials and await confirmation of their utility in randomized, placebo-controlled trials. Newer biologic (natalizumab) or cytokine-based therapies (monoclonal antibody to interleukin-6) have shown preliminary evidence of efficacy in controlled trials, but neither have yet been approved by the US Food and Drug Administration and, therefore, have not been commercialized. However, tacrolimus, a potent calcineurin inhibitor and inhibitor of interleukin-2 expression, has shown efficacy in Crohn's disease, albeit at the cost of substantial potential toxicity.},

   abstract = {Dietary microparticles are non-biological, bacterial-sized particles. Endogenous sources are derived from intestinal Ca and phosphate secretion. Exogenous sources are mainly titanium dioxide (TiO2) and mixed silicates (Psil); they are resistant to degradation and accumulate in human Peyer's patch macrophages and there is some evidence that they exacerbate inflammation in Crohn's disease (CD). However, whether their intake differs between those with and without CD has not been studied. We aimed to identify dietary microparticle sources and intakes in subjects with and without CD. Patients with inactive CD and matched general practice-based controls (ninety-one per group) completed 7 d food diaries. Intake data for dietary fibre and sucrose were compared as positive controls. All foods, pharmaceuticals and toothpastes were examined for microparticle content, and intakes of Ca and exogenous microparticles were compared between the two groups. Dietary intakes were significantly different between cases and controls for dietary fibre (12 (SD 5) v. 14 (SD 5) g/d; P=0.001) and sucrose (52 (SD 27) v. 45 (SD 18) g/d; P=0.04) but not for Ca. Estimated median TiO2 and Psil intakes (2.5 and 35 mg/individual per d respectively, totalling 10(12)-10(13) microparticles/individual per d) were broadly similar to per capita estimates and while there was wide variation in intakes between individuals there was no significant difference between subjects with CD and controls. Hence, if exposure to microparticles is associated with the inflammation of CD, then the present study rules out excess intake as the problem. Nonetheless, microparticle-containing foods have now been identified which allows a low-microparticle diet to be further assessed in CD.},

   abstract = {Patients with Crohn's disease (CD) often experience Fe deficiency (ID) and frequently alter their diet to relieve abdominal symptoms. The present study set out to assess whether patients with CD have dietary habits that lead to low Fe intakes and/or reduced bioavailable Fe compared with control subjects. Patients with asymptomatic CD were matched to controls (n 91/group). Dietary intakes of Fe and contributions from different food groups were compared using a 7 d food diary. Promoters and inhibitors of non-haem Fe absorption were investigated and a recently published algorithm was applied to assess bioavailable Fe. Fewer patients than controls met the reference nutrient intake for Fe (32% CD patients v. 42% controls). Overall, patients had significantly lower mean Fe intakes (by 2.3 mg/d) and Fe density (by 0.26 mg/MJ (1.1 mg/1000 kcal)) compared with controls (both P<0.001). Differences were mainly due to a preference among CD patients for low-fibre non-Fe fortified cereals, particularly breakfast cereals. In particular, control subjects had higher Fe intakes than matched CD subjects for men (P<0.001) and women less than 50 years (P=0.03). Intakes of both ascorbic acid (P<0.001) and phytic acid (P<0.01), but not animal tissue (P=1.0), were lower in patients with CD, but these had no overall effect on the predicted percentage of bioavailable Fe. Thus total bioavailable Fe was reduced in patients with CD due to lower intakes (P<0.01). Dietary Fe intakes are low in CD patients, which may contribute to an increased risk of ID and anaemia. Changing dietary advice may compromise perceived symptoms of the disease so the need for Fe supplementation should be carefully considered.},

   abstract = {AIM: To compare the efficacy and safety of an elemental and a polymeric diet as the primary therapy for active Crohn's disease in children. METHODS: In a randomized, non-blind, multicentre, controlled trial in Sweden, 16 children with Crohn's disease received Elemental 028 Extra (E028E) and 17 Nutrison Standard (NuS). Remission rates (Paediatric Crohn's Disease Activity Index (PCDAI) < 10 or a PCDAI decrease of 40% or 15 points of initial level) were compared at 6 wk. RESULTS: There was no significant difference between the two groups in remission rate at 6 wk (intent-to-treat analysis): E028E 11/16 (69%) and NuS 14/17 (82%) (p = 0.438). There was no difference in the decrease in PCDAI and CDAI between patients treated with E028E and those treated with NuS from 0 to 6 wk. Patients treated with NuS gained significantly more weight than patients treated with E028E (+2.5 kg; 95% CI 0.9, 4.1; p = 0.004), this difference remained when adjusting for maximum caloric intake per kilogram bodyweight (+2.9 kg; 95% CI 1.4, 4.5; p = 0.001). Concomitant disease, complications and side effects were seen in 5/33 patients (pyelonephritis, pneumonia, intraabdominal abscess, perianal abscess and borborygmi). CONCLUSION: E028E and NuS did not differ in terms of remission rate. Patients treated with NuS gained more weight than patients with E028E. Polymeric diet may be superior to elemental diet in the treatment of paediatric Crohn's disease where the primary aim is to increase the patient's weight.},

The normal intestinal host-microbial interactions are not well understood, but the relationship is generally believed to be either mutually beneficial or beneficial to one without disadvantage to the other. Animal model and clinical studies suggest that IBD (inflammatory bowel disease) may develop in a susceptible individual when the normal host-bacterial relationship is dysregulated. In addition to rodent models, this article reviews studies that have investigated the cellular and molecular mechanisms of interactions between intestinal mucosal cells and the resident luminal bacteria in healthy individuals and patients with ulcerative colitis and Crohn's disease. Mechanisms by which the intestinal mucosa is able to avoid pro-inflammatory responses to commensal bacteria (and their products) but able to respond appropriately to luminal pathogens is currently an area of active investigation. Such studies are beginning to provide important clues regarding possible alterations in the mucosa that lead to the development of pro-inflammatory responses to resident bacteria in patients with IBD. Approaches to alter the intestinal microflora for therapeutic purposes and their potential mechanisms of action are also discussed.},

There has been much debate regarding whether Crohn's disease and ulcerative colitis are distinct entities or if they exist along a continuum of the same disease process. In this article, the pathogenic mechanisms and clinical manifestations of inflammatory bowel disease are reviewed, as well as treatment options. Because Crohn's disease and ulcerative colitis are chronic diseases, they have an important economic effect on our healthcare system and the United States as a whole. Some newer and more expensive treatment options may provide overall cost savings in select patient populations because of decreased use of healthcare resources.},

   abstract = {BACKGROUND: Thalidomide is best known as a major teratogen that caused birth defects in up to 12,000 children in the 1960s. More recently, this agent has been approved by the US Food and Drug Administration for the treatment of erythema nodosum leprosum (ENL) through a restricted-use program. Its immunomodulatory, anti-inflammatory, and antiangiogenic properties are currently under study in a number of clinical conditions. OBJECTIVE: This article reviews the pharmacology of thalidomide; its approved and off-label uses in dermatologic, oncologic, and gastrointestinal conditions; and adverse events associated with its use. METHODS: Relevant articles were identified through searches of MEDLINE (1966-June 2002), International Pharmaceutical Abstracts (1970-June 2002), and EMBASE (1990-June 2002). Search terms included but were not limited to thalidomide, pharmacokinetics, pharmacology, therapeutic use, and teratogenicity, as well as terms for specific disease states and adverse events. Further publications were identified from the reference lists of the reviewed articles. Abstracts of recent symposia were obtained from the American Society of Clinical Oncology Web site. RESULTS: Thalidomide is thought to exert its therapeutic effect through the modulation of cytokines, particularly tumor necrosis factor-alpha. In addition to its approved indication for ENL, thalidomide has been studied in various other conditions, including graft-versus-host disease, discoid lupus erythematosus, sarcoidosis, relapsed/refractory multiple myeloma, Waldenstrom's macroglobulinemia, myelodysplastic syndromes, acute myeloid leukemia, myelofibrosis with myeloid metaplasia, renal cell carcinoma, malignant gliomas, prostate cancer, Kaposi's sarcoma, colorectal carcinoma, oral aphthous ulcers, Behcet's disease, Crohn's disease, and HIV/AIDS-associated wasting. Adverse events most frequently associated with its use include somnolence, constipation, rash, peripheral neuropathy, and thromboembolism. CONCLUSIONS: Use of thalidomide is limited by toxicity, limited efficacy data, and restricted access. Evidence of its efficacy in conditions other than ENL awaits the results of controlled clinical trials.},

   abstract = {BACKGROUND: Prophylactic efficacy against colitis following lactobacillus consumption in interleukin 10 (IL-10) knockout (KO) mice has been reported. Whether this applies equally to other probiotic strains is unknown, and the mechanism is unclear. AIMS: (1) To compare the effect of feeding Lactobacillus salivarius subspecies salivarius 433118 and Bifidobacterium infantis 35624 against placebo on enterocolitis, the intestinal microflora, and (2) to compare the systemic immunological response to in vitro microbial challenge in probiotic fed and control IL-10 KO mice. METHODS: Three groups of 10 IL-10 KO mice were fed fermented milk products containing Lb salivarius 433118 at 10(9) CFU/ml, B infantis 35624 at 10(8) CFU/ml, and unmodified milk, respectively, for 19 weeks. Faecal samples were taken at regular intervals to confirm gut transit, recovery of fed probiotics, and to assess the impact on the microflora. At sacrifice, the bowels were histologically scored. Cytokine production from Peyers' patches and splenocytes was measured in vitro by ELISA. RESULTS: Faecal recovery of probiotics was confirmed in all probiotic fed mice but not in controls. Colonic and caecal inflammatory scores were significantly decreased in both groups of probiotic fed mice (p<0.05). Proinflammatory cytokine production by Peyers' patches and splenocytes was significantly reduced in probiotic fed animals whereas transforming growth factor beta (TGF-beta) levels were maintained. CONCLUSION: Both Lactobacillus salivarius 433118 and Bifidobacterium infantis 35624 significantly attenuate colitis in this murine model. Attenuation of colitis is associated with a reduced ability to produce Th1-type cytokines systemically and mucosally, while levels of TGF-beta are maintained.},

Multiplex PCR of IS900 integration loci (MPIL) and amplified fragment length polymorphism (AFLP) analyses were used to fingerprint M. avium subsp. paratuberculosis isolates recovered from animals (n = 203) and patients with Crohn's disease (n = 7) from diverse geographic localities. Six hundred bacterial cultures, including M. avium subsp. paratuberculosis (n = 303), non-M. avium subsp. paratuberculosis mycobacteria (n = 129), and other nonmycobacterial species (n = 168), were analyzed to evaluate the specificity of two IS900 integration loci and a newly described M. avium subsp. paratuberculosis-specific sequence (locus 251) as potential targets for the diagnosis of M. avium subsp. paratuberculosis. MPIL fingerprint analysis revealed that 78% of bovine origin M. avium subsp. paratuberculosis isolates clustered together into a major node, whereas isolates from human and ovine sources showed greater genetic diversity. MPIL analysis also showed that the M. avium subsp. paratuberculosis isolates from ovine and bovine sources from the same state were more closely associated than were isolates from different geographic regions, suggesting that some of the strains are shared between these ruminant species. AFLP fingerprinting revealed a similar pattern, with most isolates from bovine sources clustering into two major nodes, while those recovered from sheep or humans were clustered on distinct branches. Overall, this study identified a high degree of genetic similarity between M. avium subsp. paratuberculosis strains recovered from cows regardless of geographic origin. Further, the results of our analyses reveal a relatively higher degree of genetic heterogeneity among M. avium subsp. paratuberculosis isolates recovered from human and ovine sources.},

   abstract = {BACKGROUND & AIMS: Reports of tuberculosis (TB) in patients administered infliximab prompted the Food and Drug Administration to recommend that all patients being considered for this therapy be evaluated for the risk for latent TB infection by means of a tuberculin skin test (TST). The aim of this study is to evaluate the utility of a TST as an adequate screen for TB exposure in patients with inflammatory bowel disease (IBD). METHODS: Eighty-two consecutive patients with IBD (Crohn's disease, 70 patients; ulcerative colitis, 4 patients; indeterminate colitis, 8 patients) seen at Cedars-Sinai Medical Center IBD Center (Los Angeles, CA) being treated with or considered for infliximab therapy underwent a standard intradermal purified protein derivative (PPD) TST before or between infusions of infliximab. One or more control antigens (Candida, tetanus, and/or mumps) were concurrently placed on 69 of these patients. Skin tests were read for induration at 48-72 hours after placement, and results were recorded. RESULTS: None of 82 patients had a positive PPD TST result. Overall, 71% of patients (49 of 69 patients) with controls placed failed to react to any antigen. Eighty-three percent of patients (40 of 48 patients) who were administered corticosteroids and/or immunosuppressive medications, not including infliximab, for at least 1 month were anergic compared with 43% of patients (9 of 21 patients; P < 0.002) who were not administered those medications. CONCLUSIONS: Given the high prevalence of anergy, a negative TST result in patients with IBD administered infliximab is an unreliable indicator for TB exposure. Evaluation for TB risks should include not only a TST, but also a detailed history of travel, TB exposures, and such symptoms as chronic cough and weight loss, and a chest radiograph should be considered.},

   abstract = {The intestinal immune system discriminates between invasive pathogens and antigens that are harmless, such as food proteins and commensal bacteria. The latter groups of antigens normally induce tolerance and a breakdown in this homeostatic process can lead to diseases such as coeliac disease or Crohn's disease. The nature ofthe intestinal immune response depends on how antigen is presented to CD4+ T cells by dendritic cells (DCs). Both oral tolerance and priming are influenced by the numbers and activation status of DCs in the gut and its draining lymphoid tissues, and our current work indicates that dietary proteins are taken up preferentially by DCs in the lamina propria of the small intestine. These then migrate to interact with antigen-specific CD4+ T cells in the mesenteric lymph node. In vivo and in vitro studies using purified lamina propria DCs suggest these may play a unique role in the regulation of intestinal immune responses. We propose that local DCs are the gatekeepers of the mucosal immune system, inducing tolerance under physiological conditions, but being sufficiently responsive to inflammatory stimuli to allow T cell priming and protective immunity when necessary. In addition, we will discuss evidence that adjuvant vectors such as ISCOMS may be effective mucosal vaccines due to an ability to activate intestinal DCs.},

However, patients with food allergy-related enteropathy pose a diagnostic challenge to physicians because the clinical features are variable, unspecific, occur in other gastrointestinal disorders, and specific diagnostic tools are missing. Several recent studies and reviews have focused on the function of eosinophilic granulocytes in GI disease. The role of eosinophils in the pathophysiology of GI hypersensitivity reactions is poorly defined. However, some findings have been reported that imply an involvement of eosinophils in allergic reactions of the gut. The presumptive histology of allergy-associated colitis in colonic and ileal biopsies is based on prominent pure eosinophilic infiltration of a normal lamina propria, submucosa and epithelium with variable degrees of degranulation. An immunoperoxidase stain for eosinophilic peroxidase is supportive in establishing the diagnosis if suspected. Neutrophils or mononuclear infiltrates are not significantly increased and damage to the intestinal tissue is not prominent. Despite characteristic histologic changes in colonic biopsy specimens, a final diagnosis depends on careful clinical examination and exclusion of several differential diagnoses.},

   abstract = {Ulcerative colitis (UC) and Crohn's disease are inflammatory disorders of unknown cause and difficult to treat, though some synthetic chemicals, including ligands for peroxisome proliferator-activated receptors (PPARs), are anticipated to be useful drugs. In contrast, few food phytochemicals have been reported to suppress colitis in animal models. The present study was undertaken to explore the suppressive efficacy of zerumbone (ZER), a sesquiterpenoid present in the rhizome of Zingiber zerumbet Smith that is used as a condiment in Southeast Asian countries and known to be a potent suppressant of cyclooxygenase (COX)-2 and inducible nitric oxide synthase expression in cell culture systems. Acute colitis was induced by exposing female ICR mice to 5% DSS in drinking water for 1 week. One week prior to DSS administration, the experimental mice were fed ZER alone, nimesulide (NIM, a selective COX-2 inhibitor) alone, or both in combination (1000 ppm each) for a total of 2 weeks. Inflammatory biomarkers, i.e. interleukin (IL)-1alpha and IL-1beta, tumor necrosis factor (TNF)-alpha, and prostaglandin (PG)E(2) and PGF(2alpha) in colonic mucosa were quantified by an enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay in conjunction with histological alterations. Oral feeding of ZER significantly lowered the levels of IL-1beta [inhibitory rate (IR)=34%], TNF-alpha (IR=29%), and PGE(2) (IR=73%) and suppressed DSS-induced colitis, whereas NIM suppressed the histological changes induced by DSS without affecting inflammatory biomarkers. However, their treatment in combination was most effective for suppressing these biomarkers. Our results suggest that ZER is a novel food factor for mitigating experimental UC and that use of a combination of agents, with different modes of actions, may be an effective anti-inflammatory strategy.},

The role of Mycobacterium avium subspecies paratuberculosis (MAP) in Crohn's disease is controversial. METHODS: We tested for MAP by PCR and culture in buffy coat preparations from 28 individuals with Crohn's disease, nine with ulcerative colitis, and 15 without inflammatory bowel disease. FINDINGS: MAP DNA in uncultured buffy coats was identified by PCR in 13 (46%) individuals with Crohn's disease, four (45%) with ulcerative colitis, and three (20%) without inflammatory bowel disease. Viable MAP was cultured from the blood of 14 (50%) patients with Crohn's disease, two (22%) with ulcerative colitis, and none of the individuals without inflammatory bowel disease. Current use of immunosuppressive medication did not correlate with a positive MAP culture. Sequencing of PCR products from MAP cultures confirmed the presence of the MAP-specific IS900 fragment. Among 11 MAP isolates assessed, we identified nine strains that were not identical. INTERPRETATION: We detected viable MAP in peripheral blood in a higher proportion of individuals with Crohn's disease than in controls. These data contribute to the evidence that MAP might be a cause of Crohn's disease.},

   abstract = {Thalidomide, administered as a sedative and antiemetic decades ago, was considered responsible for numerous devastating cases of birth defects and consequently was banned from markets worldwide. However, the drug remarkably has resurfaced with promise of immunomodulatory benefit in a wide array of immunologic disorders for which available treatments were limited. It is approved by the Food and Drug Administration for erythema nodosum leprosum (ENL). Although the relative paucity of leprosy and ENL worldwide may perceivably limit interest in and knowledge about thalidomide, increasing numbers of new and potential uses expand its applicability widely beyond ENL. Thalidomide, an inhibitor of tumor necrosis factor a, is the best known agent for short-term treatment of ENL skin manifestations, as well as postremission maintenance therapy to prevent recurrence. For this indication, it is effective as monotherapy and as part of combination therapy with corticosteroids. Studies of thalidomide in chronic graft-versus-host disease showed benefit in children and adults as treatment, but not as prophylaxis. The agent has been administered successfully for treatment of cachexia related to cancer, tuberculosis, and human immunodeficiency virus infection, although evidence of efficacy is inconclusive. Thalidomide monotherapy effectively induced objective response in trials in patients with both newly diagnosed and advanced or refractory multiple myeloma. Combination therapy with thalidomide and corticosteroids was also effective in these patients, as well as in treatment of aphthous and genital ulcers. Limited evidence supports the drug's benefit in treatment of Kaposi's sarcoma. Other thalidomide applications include Crohn's disease, rheumatoid arthritis, and multiple sclerosis. Somnolence, constipation, and rash were the most frequently cited adverse effects in studies, but thalidomide-induced neuropathy and idiopathic thromboembolism were critical causes for drug discontinuation. Thalidomide is still contraindicated in pregnant women, women of childbearing age, and sexually active men not using contraception. Clinicians should be conversant with thalidomide in ENL (its primary application) in the natural course of leprosy, as well as in the agent's other applications.},

Infliximab has also been Food and Drug Administration-approved in the treatment of Crohn disease; etanercept is now FDA-approved for juvenile chronic arthritis and psoriatic arthritis. Favorable initial clinical trials have been reported in other rheumatic diseases, including ankylosing spondylitis and adult Still disease.

The TNF alpha blockers have had relatively infrequent serious side effects, especially compared with the immunosuppressive and cytotoxic agents otherwise employed to treat these diseases. Further studies of optimal dosing, combination with other therapies, and long-term benefits and side effects will emerge from future trials.},

   abstract = {Overwhelming gram-negative bacterial infection and life-threatening systemic inflammation are widespread problems in critically ill emergency department patients. Currently, the treatment of these patients is largely supportive, focusing on antibiotics, fluids, hemodynamic and ventilatory support, and intensive monitoring. The only Food and Drug Administration-approved pharmaceutical agent for the treatment of sepsis is activated protein C, with its use largely relegated to the intensive care unit. The subject thus remains an active area of exploration for emergency medicine research. During sepsis and inflammation, innate immune cells release excessive amounts of proinflammatory cytokines such as tumor necrosis factor (TNF) and interleukin-1beta. If delivered early enough, anti-TNF antibodies can be an effective therapy in experimental models of septic shock. Anti-TNF antibodies have been developed for clinical use in rheumatoid arthritis and Crohn's disease. However, anti-TNF treatment for sepsis has been difficult to achieve in the clinical setting, perhaps because TNF's early release and transient appearance in the serum create a narrow therapeutic window. An alternative strategy would be to identify "late" mediators that may be clinically more accessible. High mobility group box 1 (HMGB1), a protein previously known only as a nuclear transcription factor, is now implicated as a late mediator of sepsis. Targeting late mediators of lethal systemic inflammation represents a novel approach that may widen the therapeutic window and lead to new strategies for inhibiting the deleterious effects of the inflammatory cascade. Here the authors review the studies that led to the discovery of HMGB1 as a late mediator of systemic inflammation and discuss the possibility of HMGB1 as a therapeutic target for septic patients in the emergency department.},

   abstract = {Crohn's disease, ulcerative colitis, and pouchitis are caused by overly aggressive immune responses to a subset of commensal (nonpathogenic) enteric bacteria in genetically predisposed individuals. Clinical and experimental studies suggest that the relative balance of aggressive and protective bacterial species is altered in these disorders. Antibiotics can selectively decrease tissue invasion and eliminate aggressive bacterial species or globally decrease luminal and mucosal bacterial concentrations, depending on their spectrum of activity. Alternatively, administration of beneficial bacterial species (probiotics), poorly absorbed dietary oligosaccharides (prebiotics), or combined probiotics and prebiotics (synbiotics) can restore a predominance of beneficial Lactobacillus and Bifidobacterium species. Current clinical trials do not fulfill evidence-based criteria for using these agents in inflammatory bowel diseases (IBD), but multiple nonrigorous studies and widespread clinical experience suggest that metronidazole and/or ciprofloxacin can treat Crohn's colitis and ileocolitis (but not isolated ileal disease), perianal fistulae and pouchitis, whereas selected probiotic preparations prevent relapse of quiescent ulcerative colitis and relapsing pouchitis. These physiologic approaches offer considerable promise for treating IBD, but must be supported by rigorous controlled therapeutic trials that consider clinical disease before their widespread clinical acceptance. These agents likely will become an integral component of treating IBD in combination with traditional anti-inflammatory and immunosuppressive agents.},

However, the best ways in which to identify at-risk patients, the epidemiology of fractures and an evidence-based rational prevention strategy remain to be established. The overall prevalence of IBD-associated osteoporosis is 15%, with higher rates seen in older and underweight subjects. The incidence of fractures is about 1 per 100 patient years, with fracture rates dramatically increasing with age. While old age is a significant risk factor, disease type (Crohn's disease or ulcerative colitis) is not related to osteoporosis risk. Corticosteroid use is a major variable influencing IBD-associated bone loss; however, it is difficult to separate the effects of corticosteroids from those of disease activity. The recommendations in inflammatory bowel disease are similar to those for postmenopausal osteoporosis, with emphasis on lifestyle modification, vitamin D (400-800 IE daily) and calcium (1000-1500 mg daily) supplementation and hormone replacement therapy (oestrogens/selective oestrogen receptor modulators in women, testosterone in hypogonadal men). Bisphosphonates have been approved for patients with osteoporosis (T-score < 2.5), osteoporotic fragility fractures and patients receiving continuous steroid medication. Data on the recently Food and Drug Administration-approved osteoanabolic substance parathyroid hormone and on osteoprotegerin are promising in terms of both steroid-induced and inflammation-mediated osteoporosis, the key elements of inflammatory bowel disease-associated bone disease.},

   abstract = {Inflammatory bowel diseases (IBD), commonly referred to as Crohn's disease and ulcerative colitis are chronic aggressive disorders which share many similarities concerning pathomechanism and clinical course, but have very distinct features. Both entities are mainly located in areas with high bacterial concentrations, such as the terminal ileum and cecum in Crohn's disease and the rectum in ulcerative colitis. In recent years, overwhelming evidence accumulated, supporting the hypothesis that IBD are characterized by a genetically determined, overly aggressive immune response towards ubiquitous luminal antigens, especially commensal bacteria and their products. Trials in both human IBD and experimental colitis have demonstrated that broad-spectrum antibiotics may influence the course of ulcerative colitis and Crohn's disease and antibiotics with narrow activity against the anaerobic fraction of the flora can prevent relapse in Crohn's disease after surgically induced remission. Since relevant antibiotic strategies can be associated with some side effects, the ongoing research recently focused on alternative methods to modify the intestinal flora in patients with IBD. Clinical observations including few controlled trials, basic research, and animal studies have suggested a potential role for probiotic bacteria within the treatment regimens for IBD. However, the mode of action of these organisms is still largely unclear and in vitro studies are inconclusive. This review summarizes recent in vitro and in vivo data regarding the role of the intestinal microflora in the pathogenesis of chronic intestinal inflammation and possible therapeutic mechanisms of probiotic bacteria relevant to IBD. Furthermore, we will review clinical trials examining the efficacy of antibiotic and probiotic treatment strategies in IBD.},

Alteration of the intestinal microflora by antibiotic or probiotic therapy may induce and maintain remission. The aim of this randomized, placebo-controlled trial was to determine the effect of oral Lactobacillus GG (L. GG) to induce or maintain medically induced remission. METHODS: Eleven patients with moderate to active Crohn's disease were enrolled in this trial to receive either L. GG (2 x 10(9) CFU/day) or placebo for six months. All patients were started on a tapering steroid regime and received antibiotics for the week before the probiotic/placebo medication was initiated. The primary end point was sustained remission, defined as freedom from relapse at the 6 months follow-up visit. Relapse was defined as an increase in CDAI of >100 points. RESULTS: 5/11 patients finished the study, with 2 patients in each group in sustained remission. The median time to relapse was 16 +/- 4 weeks in the L. GG group and 12 +/- 4.3 weeks in the placebo group (p = 0.5). CONCLUSION: In this study we could not demonstrate a benefit of L. GG in inducing or maintaining medically induced remission in CD.},

   abstract = {BACKGROUND: An increased intake of sucrose has been reported in patients with Crohn's disease (CD). Since subclinical zinc deficiency reduces taste perception for sweet, we investigated taste perception, sucrose intake and plasma zinc levels as well as dental status in CD patients. METHODS: Carbohydrate intake and plasma zinc levels were assessed in 24 CD patients and 24 age-matched controls (Con). Taste threshold for sucrose, oral hygiene and caries prevalence were evaluated. RESULTS: In CD a higher sucrose intake (CD 107.1 +/- 27.7 vs. Con 71.9 +/- 13.7 g/day; p < 0.001), a higher taste threshold for sweet (CD 7.31 vs. Con 2.91 g/l; p < 0.001) and lower plasma zinc levels (CD 11.5 +/- 1.5 vs. Con 13.5 +/- 2.0 micromol/l; p < 0.001) were found. API was poor (CD 85.4 +/- 23.6, Con 31.8 +/- 24.1, p < 0.001) and correlated with sucrose intake (p < 0.01). Caries prevalence was increased in patients with longer disease (>3 years) (DMFT index: >3 years 15.6 +/- 5.7 vs. <3 years 9.5 +/- 4.3; p < 0.05). CONCLUSION: Dental status in CD patients is poor. Both increased sugar consumption and insufficient oral hygiene seem to cause the higher caries prevalence. Obviously, patients with CD belong to a high-risk group, and preventive measures should be taken early in the course of the disease.},

The following three bins were employed: in Case I, only recycled compost was composted; in Case II, food wastes with recycled compost; and in Case III, food wastes with recycled compost and vermiculite. In the experiment performed for 30 days, it was confirmed that the supplementary addition of vermiculite to the composting mixture did not significantly improve the weight loss rate and the decomposition rate of food wastes. Due to dilution through the use of inorganic vermiculite, the vermiculite addition reduced the organic matter concentration of the composting mixtures. Vermiculite addition did not raise the pH value. Weight losses of roughly 70% were observed based on calculating moisture loss as well as dry food waste loss and not considering additives, while dry food waste loss was 29.4% and 35.8% with and without the addition of vermiculite, respectively. For these experiments, the major portion of the weight loss was the loss of water. The results indicate a need to differentiate between weight loss percentages and decomposition percentages, and a need to indicate if either of these percentages includes or excludes the mass of additives.},

However, there are large gaps in the knowledge of the normal flora and of the optimal use of probiotic products. At present, there is no reliable in vitro predictor of in vivo efficacy of putative probiotics. Indeed, probiotic performance should be defined in the context of the disease indication for which it is intended. This will require rigorous prospective clinical trials. In addition, guidelines for routine clinical use of probiotics are confounded by insufficient data on optimum strain selection, dose, delivery vehicle and monitoring. Before the promise can be fulfilled, problems and potential pitfalls with probiotic therapy need resolution.},

Despite its widespread acceptance, dysplasia and cancer surveillance is unproven in terms of reducing mortality or morbidity and there is a remarkable lack of uniformity in the manner in which it is practised.

   abstract = {In humans, intestinal defences develop during gestation and, at full term, have the capacity to respond in an appropriate manner to infectious agents and foreign antigens. Before an active protective response can occur, however, the gut must first be exposed to colonizing bacteria. Colonization with diverse intestinal microbes is necessary for the development of important gut defenses such as the synthesis and secretion of polymeric immunoglobulin A and the generation of a balanced T helper (Th) cell response. Insights into normal immune physiological development of the gut have been made by studying the germ-free animal and intestinal defenses. These studies have provided insights into the physiology of immune responses. Two important immunological functions are the secretion of polymeric immunoglobulin A to protect the intestinal surface against harmful stimuli and inhibition of the systemic response to commensal bacteria and food proteins (eg, oral tolerance) to prevent chronic inflammation. Neither function exists in the germ-free state, but rapidly develops after conventionalization (colonization) of the germ-free animal. In the present review, the importance of bacterial colonization on the appearance of normal mucosal immune function and to the clinical consequences of inadequate colonization to the development of disease will be discussed. For example, excessive Th2 activity can lead to atopy, whereas Th1 predominance is found in conditions such as Helicobacter pylori gastritis and Crohn's disease. With the eradication of infectious diseases in developed countries in the past three decades, the incidence of atopic and autoimmune diseases has increased. This epidemiological observation has been explained by the 'hygiene hypothesis', which suggests that a reduction in microbial burden by public health measures has contributed to an immunological imbalance in the intestine. A family of pattern recognition receptors (Toll-like receptors) on gut lymphoid and epithelial cells mediates innate immune responses to bacterial molecular patterns and, thereby, orchestrates acquired immunity. As the role of bacterial communication within the gut (bacterial-epithelial cross-talk) is clarified, physicians should be able to modulate gut immune responses, for example, by the use of probiotics.},

DESIGN: Nonrandomized, comparative, retrospective analysis of a prospective database. SETTING: University hospital tertiary care center for inflammatory bowel disease. PATIENTS: Forty patients, 20 in the laparoscopic group (group A) and 20 in the conventional group (group B). INTERVENTION: From July 1, 1996, to June 30, 2001, we collected data on the following demographic clinical end points: age, sex, duration of disease, preoperative medical treatment, previous abdominal surgery, procedure performed, conversions to open surgery, operating time, number of trocars used, size of incision, blood loss, time to resolution of ileus, time to starting solid food diet, duration of hospital stay, hospital charges, morbidity, and mortality. MAIN OUTCOME MEASURES: Surgical results, length of hospital stay, hospital charges, and recurrences. RESULTS: The mean age of the patients was 34.7 years (range, 20-68 years) in group A vs 40.0 years (range, 18-75 years) in group B. The male-female ratio was 1:2 in group A vs 1:1 in group B. The morbidity was 5% in group B. There was no mortality. Operating time was longer in group A (mean, 145.0 minutes; range, 45-270 minutes) compared with group B (mean, 133.5 minutes; range, 98-177 minutes) (P =.36). Blood loss was significantly higher in group B (mean, 265.5 mL; range, 100-400 mL) compared with group A (77.2 mL; range, 25-350 mL) (P<.001). Also, the size of the incision was significantly longer in group B (mean, 13.5 cm; range, 8-18 cm) compared with group A (mean, 5.5 cm; range, 3-12 cm) (P<.001). Bowel function returned more quickly in the laparoscopic group vs the conventional group in terms of return of bowel movements (1.70 vs 2.63 days) (P<.001) and resumption of a regular diet (1.35 vs 2.73 days) (P<.001). The mean length of stay was significantly shorter in the laparoscopic group (4.25 days) vs the conventional group (8.25 days) (P<.001). The mean hospital charges were US $9614 in group A vs US $17 079 in group B (P<.05). The mean follow-up was 17.2 months in group A (range, 2.3-59.9 months) vs 18.7 months in group B (range, 1.0-37.5 months). CONCLUSIONS: Laparoscopic-assisted ileocolectomy for primary Crohn disease of the terminal ileum and/or cecum is safe and successful in most cases. Laparoscopic surgery for Crohn disease should be considered as the preferred operative approach for primary resections.},

This microorganism is shed by infected animals primarily in the feces but is also shed in the milk at much lower levels. Therefore, dairy products from infected animals may be one mode of transmission of this animal pathogen. This study was designed to evaluate the effectiveness of the holder and high-temperature short-time pasteurization standards on the destruction of M. paratuberculosis. One hundred eighty experiments were conducted in this study using a slug-flow pasteurizer unit and a laboratory scale pasteurizer unit. Ultrahigh-temperature milk was inoculated at two concentrations, 10(8) and 10(5) CFU/ml, with three different field strains of M. paratuberculosis. Five different time-temperature combinations were evaluated: 62.7 degrees C for 30 min, 65.5 degrees C for 16 s, 71.7 degrees C for 15 s, 71.7 degrees C for 20 s, and 74.4 degrees C for 15 s. Three replicates of each experiment were run for the pasteurizer unit, time-temperature combination, and strain of M. paratuberculosis. Treatment of milk regardless of bacterial strain or pasteurizer unit resulted in an average 5.0- and 7.7-log kill for the low and high concentrations of inoculum, respectively. Milk treated for cheese production (65.5 degrees C for 16 s) resulted in a much lower and more variable kill. Results from this study indicate that the current U.S. minimum standards for batch and high-temperature short-time pasteurization of grade A milk significantly reduced the survivability of M. paratuberculosis, but some bacteria survived subpasteurization heat treatment of milk used for cheese manufacture.},

   abstract = {Intestinal bacteria play a key role in inflammatory bowel disease. Probiotics attempt to modify disease by favourably altering bacterial composition, immune status, and inflammation. Until recently, probiotic therapy was considered 'folk' medicine, but there now is emerging interest on the part of the general public and scientific communities in the use of probiotics in human disease. This practical, evidence-based review examines probiotics as therapy for inflammatory bowel disease in humans. There are very few such published randomized clinical trials, but some data exist that possibly show an efficacy of probiotics as maintenance therapy in chronic relapsing pouchitis. Obstacles to providing probiotic therapy include selection of appropriate strains, poorly regulated probiotic quality standardization, processing and human biologic factors which impair probiotic viability, difficulty in maintaining new bacterial populations in the gut, and local product unavailability. Studies have focused on specific inflammatory bowel disease subgroups, limiting general applicability for the practitioner. Basic research highlights the importance of bacteria in these conditions, and the possibility that probiotics will modify physiological parameters. Well-designed, randomized clinical studies are still required to define the role of probiotics as therapeutic agents in inflammatory bowel disease.},

Although symptoms of eosinophilic gastroenteritis at age 8 could mimic those of Crohn's disease, laboratory, radiographic and histologically studies are clearly different. Peripheral blood eosinophilia (7,476 cells per mm3), high serum IgE level (1,050 kU/l) and normal C-reactive protein and erythrocyte sedimentation rate are common in eosinophilic gastroenteritis and uncommon in Crohn's disease. Eosinophilic gastroenteritis was due to bovine serum albumin (BSA) hypersensitivity, confirmed with skin tests, serum levels to specific IgE and a SDS-PAGE IgE-immunoblotting. A strict meat-free diet was started, with progressive relief of symptoms and decrease of eosinophil count twelve months later; the patient became fully symptom-free and eosinophil count was normal.},

   abstract = {BACKGROUND: Crohn disease (CD) is associated with osteoporosis and other extraintestinal manifestations that might be mediated by cytokines from circulating (peripheral blood) mononuclear cells (PBMCs). Fish oil rich in eicosapentaenoic acid (EPA) and docosahexaenoic acid (DHA) reduces disease activity in patients with CD with raised laboratory markers of inflammation and in healthy subjects alters PBMC function. OBJECTIVE: We investigated the effect of fish oil plus antioxidants on cytokine production by PBMCs from patients with CD with raised C-reactive protein concentrations (>/=6.9 mg/L) or erythrocyte sedimentation rates (>/=18 mm/h). DESIGN: A randomized placebo-controlled trial of fish oil (2.7 g EPA and DHA/d; n = 31) or placebo (olive oil; n = 31) for 24 wk was conducted in patients with CD. The fish-oil group additionally received an antioxidant preparation (vitamins A, C, and E and selenium). Exclusion criteria included corticosteroid use. Fatty acid composition was measured by gas chromatography. Production of tumor necrosis factor alpha, interferon gamma (IFN-gamma), and prostaglandin E(2) (PGE(2)) was measured by enzyme-linked immunosorbent assays after stimulation with mitogen and endotoxin (lipopolysaccharide). RESULTS: Fish-oil plus antioxidant dietary supplementation was associated with higher EPA and DHA incorporation into PBMCs (P < 0.001) and lower arachidonic acid (P = 0.006) and lower production of IFN-gamma by mitogen-stimulated PBMCs (P = 0.012) and of PGE(2) by lipopolysaccharide-stimulated PBMCs (P = 0.047). CONCLUSION: Dietary supplementation with fish oil plus antioxidants is associated with modified PBMC composition and lower production of PGE(2) and IFN-gamma by circulating monocytes or macrophages. The response of extraintestinal manifestations of CD should be investigated in a randomized controlled trial.},

   abstract = {BACKGROUND & AIMS: Crohn's disease (CD) is associated with nutritional deficiencies, altered plasma concentrations of polyunsaturated fatty acids (PUFA) and an anti-inflammatory response to fish oil that contains n-3 PUFA. This suggests that, in CD, immune cells may have altered n-3 PUFA composition with functional consequences. The aim of this study is to investigate n-3 and n-6 PUFA composition and synthetic function of peripheral blood mononuclear cells (PBMC) in the basal state. METHODS: A case control study of 52 adult CD patients and healthy, age- and sex-matched controls. Composition of PBMC and plasma phospholipids were measured by gas chromatography and production of tumour necrosis factor-alpha, prostaglandin E2 (PGE2) and interferon-gamma (IFN-gamma) by PBMC were measured by ELISA. RESULTS: CD was associated with higher concentrations of eicosapentaenoic acid and other n-3 PUFA, and lower arachidonic acid (AA) (n-6 PUFA) in PBMC. This was not explained by differences in dietary fat intake. Lower rates of production of PGE2 and IFN-gamma by PBMC were noted in quiescent and active CD, respectively, compared to controls. CONCLUSIONS: CD is associated with a greater availability, and not a deficiency, of n-3 PUFA in PBMC, but lower concentrations of AA, and lower rates of production of PGE2 and IFN-gamma, compared to healthy controls.},

   abstract = {OBJECTIVE: Although the pathogenesis of Crohn's disease remains unclear, dietary fat is thought to exacerbate intestinal inflammation. Chitosan is a water-insoluble dietary fiber, and a chitosan and ascorbic acid mixture has been shown in rats to increase fecal fat excretion without affecting protein digestibility. However, it remains unclear whether a chitosan and ascorbic acid mixture is safe and effective for patients with Crohn's disease. We designed a pilot trial to investigate the tolerability and amount of fat excretion after the oral administration of a chitosan and ascorbic mixture for inactive Crohn's disease. METHODS: Eleven outpatients were given seven tablets daily of a chitosan and ascorbic mixture (chitosan was given at 1.05 g/d) for 8 wk. Patients did not interrupt their respective therapies for Crohn's disease. RESULTS: The bowel movements of most patients increased slightly during the study. Nutritional and inflammatory markers in patients did not differ before and after treatment. The chitosan and ascorbic acid mixture significantly increased the fat concentration in the feces during treatment. CONCLUSIONS: These results indicated that oral administration of a chitosan and ascorbic acid mixture in patients with Crohn's disease is tolerable and increases fecal fat excretion without affecting disease activity.},

For that purpose, an in vitro model of the colon was inoculated with fresh feces of six healthy individuals and eight inflammatory bowel disease patients. Samples were taken from the model over time to analyze metabolites from both saccharolytic and proteolytic fermentation. Microbiotas from inflammatory bowel disease patients produced significantly more short-chain fatty acids and ammonia than microbiotas from healthy individuals. Furthermore, the branched-chain fatty acid production was 25% higher after inoculation with microbiotas from patients than after inoculation with microbiotas from healthy individuals. Phenolic compounds were produced by all microbiotas, with large interindividual variation. The production of (potentially toxic) metabolites may play a role in the onset or chronicity of inflammatory bowel disease, because they were produced in higher amounts by microbiotas from these patients than by microbiotas from healthy individuals.},

   abstract = {Osteoporosis is a frequent complication in the course of various gastrointestinal disorders. Since its pathogenesis is complex, and incompletely understood in comparison to the well-known pathomechanism of postmenopausal osteoporosis, adequate management is difficult. We first summarize those therapeutic options which have strong evidence in postmenopausal osteoporosis and, thereafter, we review those in the context of different gastrointestinal diseases. Treatment of the underlying intestinal disorder seems to be most important to normalise altered bone metabolism and to prevent osteoporosis in patients with coeliac disease. In patients with osteoporosis associated with Crohn's disease, various treatment strategies (such as vitamin D, sodium fluoride, bisphosphonates) are discussed. In contrast to postmenopausal osteoporosis, interventional studies in secondary osteoporosis are often limited by the small study population and data about the efficacy of any treatment in prevention of fractures are therefore lacking. Well-conducted, controlled studies with the endpoint of preventing fractures are therefore required to optimise the treatment of osteoporosis in these patients.},

Possible causes for this clinical presentation and a brief review of the literature are offered. CLINICAL FEATURES: A 9-year-old female had a history of headaches, stomach ache, foulsmelling soft stools, canker and cold sores, dry skin, stuffy nose with postnasal drip, difficulty concentrating in school, mood swings and growing pains with leg cramps. She also had a trace of fecal blood. A Urine OrganiX Profile and the Food Antibody Assessment was ordered demonstrating metabolic changes and food sensitivities. INTERVENTION AND OUTCOME: In this case, following a clinical laboratory assessment, treatment was initiated using nutrients and dietary changes. Fourteen months after consultation, the patient was symptom-free and her final laboratory assessment was essentially negative. She learned to work with her diet and the consequences resulting from breaking it. CONCLUSIONS: There is the need for a conservative approach to evaluation and treatment of inflammatory bowel disease before considering other more aggressive and potentially hazardous approaches. The patient's signs and symptoms responded to a unique method of evaluation and conservative management when other approaches had failed.},
