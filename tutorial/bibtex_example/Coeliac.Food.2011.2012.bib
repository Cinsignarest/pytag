   abstract = {Inappropriate food labeling and unwillingness of food companies to officially register their own gluten-free products in the Greek National Food Intolerance Database (NFID) result in a limited range of processed food products available for persons with celiac disease (CDP). The objective of the study was to evaluate the feasibility of developing a gluten-free food product database based on the assessment of the gluten content in processed foods available for CDP. Gluten was assessed in 41 processed food products available for CDP. Group A consisted of 26 products for CDP included in the NFID, and group B contained 15 food products for CDP not registered in the NFID but listed in the safe lists of the local Celiac Association (CA). High-sensitivity omega-gliadin enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay (ELISA) was used for analysis. Gluten was lower than 20 ppm in 37 of 41 analyzed products (90.2%): in 24 of 26 (92.3%) products in group A and in 13 of 15 (86.7%) products in group B (P = .61). No significant difference was found between the 2 groups regarding gluten content. No product in either group contained gluten in excess of 100 ppm. Most of the analyzed products included in the Greek NFID or listed in the lists of the local CA, even those not officially labeled "gluten free," can be safely consumed by CDP. The use of commercially available omega-gliadin ELISA is able to identify those products that contain inappropriate levels of gluten, making feasible it to develop an integrated gluten-free processed food database.},

   abstract = {OBJECTIVES: The clinical presentations of celiac crisis and refeeding syndrome in celiac disease are almost similar, but information about refeeding syndrome is scarce. We are reporting for the first time 5 cases of refeeding syndrome in children with celiac disease that could have otherwise been labeled as celiac crisis. METHODS: From January to December 2010, a chart review of hospital records of all celiac disease cases was performed, and refeeding syndrome was ascribed in those celiac patients who deteriorated clinically after initiation of a gluten-free diet and had biochemical parameters suggestive of refeeding syndrome such as hypophosphatemia, hypokalemia, hypocalcemia, and hypoalbuminemia. RESULTS: Of the total 35 celiac disease patients, 5 (median age 6.5 [range 2.2-10] years, 3 boys) were identified as having refeeding syndrome. All 5 children were severely malnourished (body mass index <14 kg/m) and all of them had anemia, hypophosphatemia, hypokalemia, hypoalbuminemia, and hypocalcemia, meaning that they had the perfect setting for developing refeeding syndrome. At the same time, their clinical features fulfilled the criteria for celiac crisis except that their symptoms have worsened after the introduction of a gluten-free diet. Nevertheless, instead of using steroids, they were managed as refeeding syndrome in terms of correction of electrolytes and gradual feeding, and that led to a successful outcome in all of them. CONCLUSIONS: Severely malnourished patients with celiac disease are at risk of developing potentially life-threatening refeeding syndrome, which may mimic celiac crisis, especially in developing countries. Early recognition and appropriate treatment are the keys to a successful outcome.},

   abstract = {Eosinophilic esophagitis (EE) is a recently recognized form of pan-esophagitis, which is characterized by the presence of at least 15 eosinophils per high power field on esophageal histology. EE is closely associated with atopic disorders and occurs predominantly in male patients. Young children are more likely to be sensitized to food allergens whilst aeroallergen sensitization predominates in older children and adults--a pattern reminiscent of the "atopic march". EE presents with a diverse range of gastrointestinal symptoms, including regurgitation, vomiting, feeding difficulties or refusal in infancy, in addition to dysphagia and food bolus impaction in older children and adults. The diagnosis may also be ascertained incidentally in patients undergoing gastroscopy for other suspected gastrointestinal conditions, such as gastroesophageal reflux disease or celiac disease. Complications mainly relate to subepithelial remodeling and fibrosis which may result in dysmotility, dysphagia and esophageal strictures. The proportion of EE patients at risk of these complications is unknown due to a paucity of data on the natural history of EE. There are only few randomized controlled trials assessing the efficacy of treatment modalities for EE, which currently either involve food allergen elimination or use of swallowed aerosolized corticosteroids. This article aims to discuss the complex issues of the diagnosis and long-term management that confront clinicians who care for children with EE.},

   abstract = {UNLABELLED: Coeliac disease is an important clinical disorder affecting the human gastrointestinal tract leading to multiple signs and symptoms in different body organs. This disease was the subject of a cross sectional descriptive-analytic study conducted in the Gaza Strip during 2010. Objectives were oriented to identify and verify several variables and attributes affecting the prognosis of coeliac disease in the patients. Ninety five children out of 113 patients were arranged into two groups according to age from 2 to 11 years and from 12 to 18 years old. Results showed the poor interest of health professionals regarding coeliac disease in the Gaza Strip. The mean age of study population was 5.47 years for males and 8.93 years for females. The lifestyle of coeliac patients was directly proportional with better nutritional indictors. Poor recognition of the emblem illustrating gluten in foods implicates effective health awareness or promotion. The more knowledgeable patients or mothers (P = 0.036) were the more compliant. The compliance to giving gluten free foods outside home was statistically significant (P = 0.037). Similarly, cautious approach when buying foods or detergents (P = 0.011). According to BMI 74.4%, 23.4% and 3.2% of all patients were normal, underweight and overweight respectively. Albumin blood level was normal in 32.6% and low in 67.4%. Meanwhile, blood calcium level was normal in 76.8%, low in 21.1% and high in 2.1% of all patients. CONCLUSION: The study showed that recreation and social activities for coeliac patients are substantially missing in the Gaza Strip. Moreover, the study proved that AEI is a reliable centre for care of coeliac disease patients and conducting relevant studies. RECOMMENDATION: There is a need for thorough and continuous community and institutional mobilization regarding coeliac disease in the Gaza Strip and in Palestine.},

Adherence and obedience to a gluten-free diet requires self-determination on the part of the person with Coeliac disease, as well as their family members. The objective of this research is to identify the main difficulties noted by people with Coeliac disease in their eating habits, the frequency of consumption and their satisfaction with gluten-free products. We employed an adapted already validated questionnaire, with open, closed, and multiple choice questions. Of the 105 participants with Coeliac disease, 90.38% of them followed, where possible, a gluten-free diet; 67.12% consumed food with gluten inadvertently or because of a lack of alternatives and/or information in food found in public places. Seventy percent affirmed that their diet provided all the energy and nutrients they need; 77.67% of the Coeliac participants prepared their meals by themselves or this task was assumed by their caregivers; 77.14% read the manufacturers labels on products, and, 74.49% expressed dissatisfaction regarding the price and availability of gluten-free products. The data show an association only between the energy and nutrients needed for good health and gluten-free dietary tracking (p=0.0315). That is, people with Coeliac disease who avoided gluten consumed more calories and were more likely to have adequate nutrients in their diet.},

   abstract = {Celiac disease (CD) is an immune-mediated disease, triggered in genetically susceptible individuals by ingesting gluten from wheat, rye, barley, and other closely related cereal grains. Currently, the estimated prevalence of CD is around 1 % of the population in the western world and medical nutritional therapy (MNT) is the only accepted treatment for celiac disease. To date, the replacement of gluten in bread presents a significant technological challenge for the cereal scientist due to the low baking performance of gluten free products (GF). The increasing demand by the consumer for high quality gluten-free (GF) bread, clean labels and natural products is rising. Sourdough has been used since ancient times for the production of rye and wheat bread, its universal usage can be attributed to the improved quality, nutritional properties and shelf life of sourdough based breads. Consequently, the exploitation of sourdough for the production of GF breads appears tempting. This review will highlight how sourdough LAB can be an efficient cell factory for delivering functional biomolecules and food ingredients to enhance the quality of gluten free bread.},

   abstract = {PURPOSE OF REVIEW: This article critically summarizes the recent scientific and clinical advances in coeliac disease. RECENT FINDINGS: Epidemiological studies have shown that coeliac disease is as common in parts of Asia, Africa and Eastern Europe as in the western world. Genome-wide association studies continue to identify genetic susceptibilities that are both unique to coeliac disease and overlap with other autoimmune diseases. Human leukocyte antigen genotyping offers additional sensitivity in detecting coeliac disease in individuals who have self-prescribed gluten-free diets (GFD) or have atypical presentations. Immunological advances have highlighted the potential proinflammatory pitfalls of vitamin A supplementation in active coeliac disease and have enabled identification of oat and barley subsets that may be safely incorporated into coeliac diets. Large population-based studies have expanded our knowledge of the long-term risks of coeliac disease, in addition to excluding infertility as a cause for concern once a GFD has been established. SUMMARY: The long-term implications of active coeliac disease emphasize the need for early detection and strict adherence to GFD, which remains the cornerstone of management. Technological advances in food modulation and immuno-therapies offer promise, but remain in the translational phases of clinical trials at present.},

   abstract = {BACKGROUND: We report the results of our single center series of patients with chronic mesenteric ischemia (CMI) to determine the role of stenting in the management of patients. PATIENTS AND METHODS: We retrospectively reviewed all patients with CMI treated endovascularly with stent revascularisation from January 2008 to January 2011.CMI diagnosis was made according to clinical symptoms, including postprandial abdominal pain, food fear, and weight loss. Additionally, the diagnosis was confirmed by duplex ultrasonography and/or computed tomography angiography and/or contrast-enhanced magnetic resonance angiography. RESULTS: All 45 patients presented with typical CMI symptoms: 45/45 (100 %) had postprandial pain, 31/45 (68.8 %) had a weight loss of more than 10 kilograms, and 11/45 (24.4 %) suffered from ischemic colitis combined with lower gastrointestinal bleeding. In three patients occlusion could not be crossed, therefore considered as technical failure. A total of 55 arteries were stented in the remaining 42 patients. Nineteen patients underwent SMA stenting alone, eight underwent celiac stenting, alone and three patients underwent stenting of inferior mesenteric artery (IMA) alone. We performed combined stenting of the celiac artery and superior mesenteric artery in ten patients, and one patient underwent a combined stenting of the celiac artery and the IMA. All three mesenteric arteries were stented in only one patient. Primary technical success was achieved in 42/45 (94.8 %) patients. Clinical symptom relief was achieved in 39/45 (86.6 %) patients with abdominal pain. Increased body weight was observed in 28/31 (90.3 %) patients with an average weight gain of 8.8 kilograms (5 - 12 kilograms), and 10/11 (90.9 %) patients recovered from ischaemic colitis/lower gastrointestinal bleeding. CONCLUSIONS: Stent revascularisation can be considered as the first-line therapy for patients with chronic mesenteric ischemia.},

   abstract = {Iron is necessary for the normal development of multiple vital processes. Iron deficiency (ID) may be caused by several diseases, even by physiological situations that increase requirements for this mineral. One of its possible causes is a poor dietary iron intake, which is infrequent in developed countries, but quite common in developing areas. In these countries, dietary ID is highly prevalent and comprises a real public health problem and a challenge for health authorities. ID, with or without anemia, can cause important symptoms that are not only physical, but can also include a decreased intellectual performance. All this, together with a high prevalence, can even have negative implications for a community's economic and social development. Treatment consists of iron supplements. Prevention of ID obviously lies in increasing the dietary intake of iron, which can be difficult in developing countries. In these regions, foods with greater iron content are scarce, and attempts are made to compensate this by fortifying staple foods with iron. The effectiveness of this strategy is endorsed by multiple studies. On the other hand, in developed countries, ID with or without anemia is nearly always associated with diseases that trigger a negative balance between iron absorption and loss. Its management will be based on the treatment of underlying diseases, as well as on oral iron supplements, although these latter are limited by their tolerance and low potency, which on occasions may compel a change to intravenous administration. Iron deficiency has a series of peculiarities in pediatric patients, in the elderly, in pregnant women, and in patients with dietary restrictions, such as celiac disease.},

   abstract = {Tight junctions (TJs) are structures between cells where cells appear in the closest possible contact. They are responsible for sealing compartments when epithelial sheets are generated. They regulate the permeability of ions, (macro) molecules and cells via the paracellular pathway. Their structure at the electron microscopic level has been well known since the 1970s; however, only recently has their macromolecular composition been revealed. This review first examines the major macromolecular components of the TJs (occludin, claudins, junctional adhesion molecule and tricellulin) and then the associated macromolecules at the intracellular plaque [zonula occludens (ZO)-1, ZO-2, ZO-3, AF-6, cingulin, 7H6]. Emphasis is given to their interactions in order to begin to understand the mode of assembly of TJs. The functional significance of TJs is detailed and several mechanisms and factors involved are discussed briefly. Emphasis is given to the role of intestinal TJs and the alterations observed or speculated in diverse disease states. Specifically, intestinal TJs may exert a pathogenetic role in intestinal (inflammatory bowel disease, celiac disease) and extraintestinal diseases (diabetes type 1, food allergies, autoimmune diseases). Additionally, intestinal TJs may be secondarily disrupted during the course of diverse diseases, subsequently allowing the bacterial translocation phenomenon and promoting the systemic inflammatory response, which is often associated with clinical deterioration. The major questions in the field are highlighted.},

   abstract = {OBJECTIVE: To determine the frequency of clinical features of Celiac disease (CD) and Celiac crisis in children. STUDY DESIGN: Case series. PLACE AND DURATION OF STUDY: Paediatrics Unit, Sheikh Zayed Medical College and Hospital, Rahim Yar Khan, from September 2009 to September 2010. METHODOLOGY: Forty children aged between 4 to 13 years of either gender, presenting with complaints of recurrent diarrhea, abdominal distention, severe emaciation and dehydration were included. The information about breast feeding, weaning diets, age of introduction of wheat diets, onset of diarrhea, characteristics and frequency of stools, growth, vaccination status, symptoms in 1st degree relatives, restriction of Gluten diet in the past and anthropometric measures were recorded. Serological tests against anti-Tissue Transglultaminase (anti-tTG) antibodies were obtained in all cases. Upper gastrointestinal endoscopies were performed and multiple biopsies were taken from distal parts of duodenum. RESULTS: Among the forty children, twenty four (60%) were females and 16 were males (40%). The mean age was 6.35 +/- 2.83 years. Thirty five (87.5%) parents were cousins. Breast feeding was not exclusively given and the Gluten containing weaning diets were given as early as 3.5 months of age. Thirty (75%) children presented with typical sign and symptoms of CD. Celiac crisis presented with profuse diarrhea, severe dehydration; abdominal distention; pedal edema, carpopedal spasm due to tetany; wasted muscles; head drop and inability to stand. The serum TtG antibodies in thirty-eight cases (95%) were above the cut off level of 7 u/ml ranging from 35-99 u/ml. The histopathology of specimens from distal duodenum revealed lesions of M3 type in thirteen (32.5%) and M2 type in eighteen cases (45%). All cases recovered and improved on follow-up after strict adherence to gluten-free diet (GFD). CONCLUSION: Majority of children with Celiac disease presented with typical symptom, while Celiac crisis was characterized by severe dehydration, weakness and calcium deficiency signs. Most were the product of consanguineous marriages and were given Gluten-containing weaning foods as early as the 4th month of life.},

   abstract = {OBJECTIVE: The gut environment modulates the pathogenesis of type 1 diabetes (T1D), but how it affects autoimmunity toward pancreatic beta-cells, a self-tissue located outside the intestine, is still unclear. In the small intestine, lamina propria dendritic cells (LPDCs) induce peripheral differentiation of FoxP3(+) regulatory T (Treg) cells. We tested the hypothesis that the intestinal milieu impinges on human T1D by affecting differentiation of FoxP3(+) Treg cells. RESEARCH DESIGN AND METHODS: We collected duodenal biopsies of 10 T1D patients, 16 healthy subjects, and 20 celiac individuals and performed a fluorescent-activated cell sorter analysis to measure percentages of various immune cell subsets, including CD4(+) and CD8(+) T cells, NK cells, gammadelta T cells, CD103(+)CD11c(+) LPDCs, and CD4(+)CD25(+)FoxP3(+)CD127(-) Treg cells. In parallel, we assessed the tolerogenic function (i.e., capacity to induce differentiation of FoxP3(+) Treg cells) by LPDCs of T1D patients and control subjects. RESULTS: Our analysis revealed a significant reduction in the percentage of intestinal CD4(+)CD25(+)FoxP3(+)CD127(-) Treg cells in T1D patients compared with healthy subjects (P = 0.03) and celiac individuals (P = 0.003). In addition, we found that LPDCs from T1D patients completely lacked their tolerogenic function; they were unable to convert CD4(+)CD25(-) T cells into CD4(+)CD25(+)FoxP3(+)CD127(-) Treg cells. CONCLUSIONS: Our data indicate that T1D patients have a reduced number of intestinal FoxP3(+) Treg cells as a result of their defective differentiation in the gut. These findings suggest that intestinal immune regulation is not only calibrated to tolerate commensal bacteria and food components but also is instrumental in maintaining immune tolerance toward pancreatic beta-cells and preventing T1D.},

   abstract = {Celiac disease is a food intolerance triggered by the ingestion of gluten-containing cereals; the only therapy is a strict gluten-free diet for life. In recent years, amaranth flour has received considerable attention as an interesting source for the formulation of gluten-free products due to its high nutritional value and low content of prolamins, the toxic proteins for celiacs. The aim of this study was to characterize 40 amaranth varieties using both SDS-PAGE/immunoblotting and ELISA to assess their possible tolerance by celiac subjects. All of the amaranth samples studied showed similar binding affinities for both specific anti-gliadin antibodies and human IgAs. In most amaranth grains, the content of gluten-like proteins measured by ELISA was <20 ppm. The molecular characterization of amaranth proteins suggests that amaranth is safe for celiacs to consume. It is recommended that the most suitable amaranth varieties are those having the lowest content of proteins cross-reacting with anti-gliadin antibodies.},

   abstract = {BACKGROUND AND OBJECTIVES: Damage to intestinal mucosa in celiac disease (CD) is mediated both by inflammation due to adaptive and innate immune responses, with IL-15 as a major mediator of the innate immune response, and by proliferation of crypt enterocytes as an early alteration of CD mucosa causing crypts hyperplasia. We have previously shown that gliadin peptide P31-43 induces proliferation of cell lines and celiac enterocytes by delaying degradation of the active epidermal growth factor receptor (EGFR) due to delayed maturation of endocytic vesicles. IL-15 is increased in the intestine of patients affected by CD and has pleiotropic activity that ultimately results in immunoregulatory cross-talk between cells belonging to the innate and adaptive branches of the immune response. Aims of this study were to investigate the role of P31-43 in the induction of cellular proliferation and innate immune activation. METHODS/PRINCIPAL FINDINGS: Cell proliferation was evaluated by bromodeoxyuridine (BrdU) incorporation both in CaCo-2 cells and in biopsies from active CD cases and controls. We used real-time PCR to evaluate IL-15 mRNA levels and FACS as well as ELISA and Western Blot (WB) analysis to measure protein levels and distribution in CaCo-2 cells. Gliadin and P31-43 induce a proliferation of both CaCo-2 cells and CD crypt enterocytes that is dependent on both EGFR and IL-15 activity. In CaCo-2 cells, P31-43 increased IL-15 levels on the cell surface by altering intracellular trafficking. The increased IL-15 protein was bound to IL15 receptor (IL-15R) alpha, did not require new protein synthesis and functioned as a growth factor. CONCLUSION: In this study, we have shown that P31-43 induces both increase of the trans-presented IL-15/IL5R alpha complex on cell surfaces by altering the trafficking of the vesicular compartments as well as proliferation of crypt enterocytes with consequent remodelling of CD mucosa due to a cooperation of IL-15 and EGFR.},

   abstract = {Miscarriage concerns approximately 15% of pregnancies and recurrent fetal loss (RFL) constitute a particular situation concerning approximately 1% of women. The etiologic inquiry is often disappointing. Nutritional factors represent a promising aspect, insufficiently investigated even if numerous studies underline their impact on fertility, gametogenesis, embryonic development and pregnancies outcome. Obesity is considered as an independent risk factor for miscarriage, involved in oocyte and embryo quality, but also in endometrial receptivity. The male part involved in miscarriage was for a long time underestimated, neglecting the role of sperm in embryo development. If conventional sperm analysis remains essential, new investigations have to be considered such as sperm DNA or oxidant stress evaluation. It is particularly important to take into account nutritional factors as favoring miscarriage because they represent a flexible factor on which intervention is possible to improve pregnancy outcome, with toxics eviction and recommendations for diversified and well-balanced food. At last, effects of nutritional complements for miscarriage prevention remain controversial.},

   abstract = {SCOPE: The involvement of oxidative stress in gluten-induced toxicity has been evidenced in vitro and in clinical studies but has never been examined in vivo. We recently demonstrated the protective activity of conjugated linoleic acid (CLA), which functions by the activation of nuclear factor erythroid 2-related factor2 (Nrf2), a key transcription factor for the synthesis of antioxidant and detoxifying enzymes (phase 2). Here, we evaluate the involvement of nuclear factor erythroid 2-related factor2 in gliadin-mediated toxicity in human Caco-2 intestinal cells and in gliadin-sensitive human leukocyte antigen-DQ8 transgenic mice (DQ8) and the protective activity of CLA. METHODS AND RESULTS: Gliadin effects in differentiated Caco-2 cells and in DQ8 mice, fed with a gliadin-containing diet with or without CLA supplementation, were evaluated by combining enzymatic, immunochemical, immunohistochemical, and quantitative real-time PCR (qRT-PCR) assays. Gliadin toxicity was accompanied by downregulation of phase 2 and elevates proteasome-acylpeptide hydrolase activities in vitro and in vivo. Notably, gliadin was unable to generate severe oxidative stress extent or pathological consequences in DQ8 mice intestine comparable to those found in celiac patients and the alterations produced were hampered by CLA. CONCLUSION: The beneficial effects of CLA against the depletion of crucial intestinal cytoprotective defenses indicates a novel nutritional approach for the treatment of intestinal disease associated with altered redox homeostasis.},

Adhering to a GFD is practically difficult and not only affects dietary patterns, but also can affect many other aspects of daily life. The present study aimed to investigate the effect of CD and a GFD on dietary habits and quality of life of a cohort of adult biopsy diagnosed coeliac patients who reside in England. METHODS: The cohort was composed of 146 adult biopsy-diagnosed CD patients, who were all members of the Coeliac UK charity. Participants responded to a self-administered questionnaire considering dietary habits and quality of life. A food frequency questionnaire (FFQ) was used to assess dietary compliance. RESULTS: Generally, English CD patients reported to be in good physical and emotional health, although there were reports of anxiety and depression as a result of CD, most likely as a result of exclusion from social and leisure activities. The cohort reported high levels of dietary compliance (96%) which was supported by FFQ responses. However, there were reports of intentional gluten intake during social situations and when eating take-away foods. The FFQ revealed further examples of gluten ingestion, presumably unintentional, particularly through the consumption of breakfast cereals and starch-based sauces such as cheese sauce, custard and ketchup. CONCLUSIONS: The present study revealed that CD affects a wide range of daily activities and that gluten consumption may be more common than anticipated with possible consequences on health.},

Nutritional intakes were obtained during training using weighed-food records and during the race via dietary recall and the weighing of foods pre- and post-race. As simple substitution of gluten-containing foods for gluten-free foods leads to increased energy intake, alternatives need to be considered. During the race, insufficient energy was consumed to meet the nutritional guidelines for endurance performance. This was probably due to the nature of the course, racing conditions, the consistency of gluten-free food, and, toward the end of the race, sensory-specific satiety.},

   abstract = {An experimental design has been developed to improve gluten-free bread formulation, on the basis of rice flour and hydroxypropylmethylcellulose (HPMC) as alternative baking ingredients. In order to improve the quality of gluten-free bread, several levels of acidic food additives (acetic acid, lactic acid, citric acid and monosodium phosphate) have been tested. The influence of these compounds on the dough and on bread properties has been determined, including a hedonic sensory test of appearance, odour, taste and texture of bread. Results suggest that monosodium phosphate yields bread producing better texture scores, associated with the highest volumes of the loaf. Discussions are made on the basis of CO2 transport pathway across the HPMC network and simultaneous interactions with acidic food additives present. Chemical properties of the acids justify the bread's alveolus size and the preservative effects of acetic acid in the dough.},

   abstract = {Tolerable gluten thresholds in gluten free products have long been debated together with issues of cross contamination of gluten free cereals during the milling process. It is well established that a totally gluten free diet is virtually impossible owing to the presence of traces of gluten. It is estimated that daily consumption of gluten from contaminated gluten free foods is in the range of 5 to 50 mg. We believe evidence is mounting that it may be possible for some coeliac patients to tolerate gluten above the limits considered permissible at threshold levels. Conversely, it seems there is evidence that some patients might have a much lower threshold for gluten. Whatever would be the individual threshold, GFD may be of benefit to any symptomatic patients even those with milder enteropathy like microscopic enteritis.},

   abstract = {OBJECTIVE: The extent of the digestive/absorptive involvement in atypical presentation of celiac disease (CD) is not always clear. The aim of the study was to assess nutritional status of iron (Fe), copper (Cu), and zinc (Zn) in patients with typical CD (TCD) and atypical CD (ACD). PATIENTS AND METHODS: A cross-sectional study was done in patients with TCD, ACD, and healthy controls (HC). Hemoglobin, serum ferritin, free erythrocyte protoporphyrin, Fe, Cu, ceruloplasmin, Zn, anti-endomysial antibodies, and anti-tissue transglutaminase antibodies were measured. Data were analyzed by Kruskal-Wallis, principal component analysis, and linear discriminant analysis. RESULTS: : One hundred nine individuals were studied (54 TCD, 19 ACD, 36 HC); mean age +/- standard deviation was 23 +/- 15.8 (range 1.6-75.4) years. Median and range of hemoglobin were 12.8 g/dL (8.1-17.6) in TCD, 12.4 g/dL (10.5-14.5) in ACD, and 13.6 g/dL (11.1-16.7) in HC (P < 0.0001); serum ferritin was 17.7 mug/L (2.9-157), 10.8 mug/L (2.7-39.8), and 28.7 mug/L (4.5-127.2), respectively (P < 0.01). Cu was 105 mug/dL (60-185), 97.5 mug/dL (40-130), and 125 mug/dL (80-205), respectively (P < 0.05). Ceruloplasmin was 21.6 mg/dL (14.2-73.2), 22.6 mg/dL (0.9-34.3), and 32.1 mg/dL (5.8-72.6), respectively (P < 0.01). There were no differences in Fe, free erythrocyte protoporphyrin, and Zn. Principal component analysis showed that 58% of observed variability was explained by Fe and Cu indicators. Linear discriminant analysis revealed differences between CD and HC (P < 0.0001), with high values of correct classification for TCD (73%) and HC (72%), but not ACD (16%), which were mostly classified as TCD (79%). CONCLUSIONS: Deficiency of micronutrients was found both in typical as well as in atypical cases.},

Data about incidence of gluten enteropathy is different in different countries around the World and depend on is it or is it not the right diagnosis for enteric disorder. Sometimes, this disease is unrecognized because of unspecific clinical signs. This disease is happening in every moment of a lifetime, most common during the childhood when the children try to eat any food which contains gluten. Anyway, if children had no symptoms it doesn't centt mean that disease not exists, and that centis because we have to do diagnostic tests to confirm gluten enteropathy. Gluten intolerance is chronic disease and demand use of the specific non gluten food during the lifetime. Early diagnosis is right way to prevent unregularly growth. Aim of this study was to show the influence of early diagnostic about growth. For each patient we had a permission of parents and we showed our original results for three month we investigated.},

   abstract = {OBJECTIVES: Investigation of uncertain celiac disease (CD) in patients already on a gluten-free diet (GFD) is difficult. We evaluated HLA-DQ2-gliadin tetramers for detection of gluten-specific T cells in peripheral blood and histological changes in the duodenum after a short gluten challenge as a diagnostic tool. METHODS: HLA-DQ2+ individuals on a GFD for at least 4 weeks were investigated; 35 with uncertain diagnosis, 13 CD patients, and 2 disease controls. All participants had a challenge with four slices of gluten-containing white bread, daily for 3 days (d1-d3). An esophagogastroduodenoscopy with biopsy sampling was done on d0 and d4. Biopsies were scored according to revised Marsh criteria. Peripheral blood CD4+ T cells were isolated, stained with HLA-DQ2-gliadin peptide tetramers, and analyzed by flow cytometry on d0 and d6. RESULTS: After challenge, a positive tetramer test was seen in 11/13 CD patients. Four of these subjects also showed typical histological changes on challenge. Of the 35 patients with uncertain diagnosis, 3 were diagnosed with CD. Two of these three patients had both positive tetramer staining and histological changes in biopsies after challenge. CONCLUSIONS: Tetramer staining for gluten-specific T cells is a sensitive method in detecting an immune response in CD patients after a short gluten challenge. The prevalence of CD in the group with self-prescribed GFD was about 10%.},

As a result, patients with gluten sensitivity experience delayed diagnosis and continuing symptoms if they consume gluten. This emerging medical problem may involve human genetics, plant genetic modifications, gluten as a food additive, environmental toxins, hormonal influences, intestinal infections and autoimmune diseases. The treatment is similar to that for celiac disease - a gluten-free diet. The use of a gluten-free diet or an elimination diet is encouraged in assisting people to determine whether or not they are gluten sensitive. It is time to not only recognize, but to treat and further research gluten sensitivity, as unconfirmed environmental factors continue to spread this problem further into the general population.},

   abstract = {The gastrointestinal (GI) microbiota is the collection of microbes which reside in the GI tract and represents the largest source of non-self antigens in the human body. The GI tract functions as a major immunological organ as it must maintain tolerance to commensal and dietary antigens while remaining responsive to pathogenic stimuli. If this balance is disrupted, inappropriate inflammatory processes can result, leading to host cell damage and/or autoimmunity. Evidence suggests that the composition of the intestinal microbiota can influence susceptibility to chronic disease of the intestinal tract including ulcerative colitis, Crohn's disease, celiac disease and irritable bowel syndrome, as well as more systemic diseases such as obesity, type 1 diabetes and type 2 diabetes. Interestingly, a considerable shift in diet has coincided with increased incidence of many of these inflammatory diseases. It was originally believed that the composition of the intestinal microbiota was relatively stable from early childhood; however, recent evidence suggests that diet can cause dysbiosis, an alteration in the composition of the microbiota, which could lead to aberrant immune responses. The role of the microbiota and the potential for diet-induced dysbiosis in inflammatory conditions of the GI tract and systemic diseases will be discussed.},

   abstract = {Celiac disease and wheat allergy are the most common adverse reactions triggered by cereal proteins, mainly gluten, which is one of the 14 allergenic food ingredients that must be labeled on food products in the European Union (EU). To meet the requirements of this regulation, reliable analytical methodology for proper quantification of gluten is necessary. However, validation of presently used methods (ELISA and lateral flow device) is limited partly due to the lack of reference methods and incurred reference materials. To solve this problem, the goal of our work was to develop an incurred reference material for the quantification of gluten under the auspices of EU-FP6 funded Network of Excellence MoniQA. During this work, we produced a processed model product (cookie) containing gliadin (major allergenic fraction of gluten) in a defined amount. This paper addresses the development process of this material together with the associated problems (insufficient homogeneity and low recovery) and their solutions. As a result, an incurred food matrix was produced on a laboratory-scale with a potential use as a reference material. The model product was tested by an ELISA method followed by a comparative study of commercially available ELISA kits to investigate the applicability of the product. Preliminary results of this study are also presented.},

   abstract = {UNLABELLED: It seems there is a positive correlation between rice content and arsenic level in foods. This is of extraordinary importance for infants below 1 y of age because their diet is very limited and in some cases is highly dependent on rice-based products; this is particularly true for infants with the celiac disease because they have no other option than consume gluten-free products, such as rice or corn. Arsenic contents were significantly higher (P < 0.001) in gluten-free infant rice (0.057 mg kg(-)(1)) than in products with gluten, based on a mixture of cereals (0.024 mg kg(-)(1)). Besides, especial precaution must be taken when preparing rice-based products at home, because arsenic content in Spanish rice was high, with levels being above 0.3 mg kg(-)(1) in some cases. PRACTICAL APPLICATION: From the data presented in this manuscript, it seems imperative that legislation on maximum residues of arsenic in food should be available as soon as possible to protect consumers worldwide. Research is needed to identify or breed rice cultivars with low accumulation of arsenic in the grain; otherwise the rice percentage in infant foods should be reduced.},

   abstract = {BACKGROUND: Effectiveness of medical therapies in chronic pancreatitis has been described in small studies of selected patients. AIM: To describe frequency and perceived effectiveness of non-analgesic medical therapies in chronic pancreatitis patients evaluated at US referral centres. METHODS: Using data on 516 chronic pancreatitis patients enrolled prospectively in the NAPS2 Study, we evaluated how often medical therapies [pancreatic enzyme replacement therapy (PERT), vitamins/antioxidants (AO), octreotide, coeliac plexus block (CPB)] were utilized and considered useful by physicians. RESULTS: Oral PERT was commonly used (70%), more frequently in the presence of exocrine insufficiency (EI) (88% vs. 61%, P < 0.001) and pain (74% vs. 59%, P < 0.002). On multivariable analyses, predictors of PERT usage were EI (OR 5.14, 95% CI 2.87-9.18), constant (OR 3.42, 95% CI 1.93-6.04) or intermittent pain (OR 1.98, 95% CI 1.14-3.45). Efficacy of PERT was predicted only by EI (OR 2.16, 95% CI 1.36-3.42). AO were tried less often (14%) and were more effective in idiopathic and obstructive vs. alcoholic chronic pancreatitis (25% vs. 4%, P = 0.03). Other therapies were infrequently used (CPB - 5%, octreotide - 7%) with efficacy generally <50%. CONCLUSIONS: Pancreatic enzyme replacement therapy is commonly utilized, but is considered useful in only subsets of chronic pancreatitis patients. Other medical therapies are used infrequently and have limited efficacy.},

   abstract = {OBJECTIVES: Coeliac disease has emerged as an increasingly recognised public health problem over the last half-century, and is now coming to be seen as a global phenomenon, despite a profound lack of globally representative epidemiological data. Since children with coeliac disease commonly present with chronic diarrhoea and malnutrition, diagnosis is often overlooked, particularly in poorer settings where children often fail to thrive and water-borne infectious diarrhoeas are common. This is the first attempt to make global estimates of the burden of coeliac disease in childhood. METHODS: We built a relatively crude model of childhood coeliac disease, incorporating estimates of population prevalence, probability of non-diagnosis, and likelihood of mortality among the undiagnosed across all countries from 1970 to 2010, based around the few available data. All our assumptions are stated in the paper and the model is available as a supplementary file. FINDINGS: Our model suggests that in 2010 there were around 2.2 million children under 5 years of age living with coeliac disease. Among these children there could be 42,000 deaths related to coeliac disease annually. In 2008, deaths related to coeliac disease probably accounted for approximately 4% of all childhood diarrhoeal mortality. CONCLUSIONS: Although coeliac disease may only account for a small proportion of diarrhoeal mortality, these deaths are not preventable by applying normal diarrhoea treatment guidelines, which may even involve gluten-based food supplements. As other causes of diarrhoeal mortality decline, coeliac disease will become a proportionately increasing problem unless consideration is given to trying gluten-free diets for children with chronic diarrhoea and malnutrition.},

In this study, the celiac IgA-immunoreactivity to zeins from raw or nixtamalized grains, before and after peptic/tryptic digestion was evaluated and their possible immunogenicity was investigated by in silico methods.IgA from some celiac patients with HLA-DQ2 or DQ8 haplotypes recognized two alpha-zeins even after peptic/ tryptic proteolysis. However, digestion affected zeins after denaturation, reduction, and alkylation, used for identification of prolamins as alpha-zein A20 and A30 by MS/MS sequencing. An in silico analysis indicated that other zeins contain similar sequences, or sequences that may bind even better to the HLA-DQ2/DQ8 molecules compared to the already identified ones. Results concur to indicate that relative abundance of these zeins, along with factors affecting their resistance to proteolysis, may be of paramount clinical relevance, and the use of maize in the formulation and preparation of gluten-free foods must be reevaluated in some cases of celiac disease.},

   abstract = {PURPOSE: This study aimed at investigating the effect of corn, rice and amaranth gluten-free (GF) sourdoughs on the release of nitric oxide (NO) and synthesis of pro-inflammatory cytokines by duodenal mucosa biopsies of eight coeliac disease (CD) patients. METHODS: Selected lactic acid bacteria were used as starters for the manufacture of corn, rice or amaranth sourdoughs. Chemically acidified doughs, without bacterial starters, and doughs started with baker's yeast alone were also manufactured from the same GF matrices. Pepsin-trypsin (PT) digests were produced from all sourdoughs and doughs, and used to assay the rate of recovery of biopsy specimens from eight CD patients at diagnosis. The release of NO and the synthesis of pro-inflammatory cytokines interferon-gamma (IFN-gamma) were assayed. RESULTS: During fermentation, lactic acid bacteria acidified and grew well (ca. log 9.0 CFU/g) on all GF matrices, showing intense proteolysis. Duodenal biopsy specimens still released NO and IFN-gamma when subjected to treatments with basal medium (control), PT-digest from chemically acidified doughs and PT-digest from doughs fermented with baker's yeast alone. On the contrary, the treatment of all the biopsy specimens with PT-digests from all GF matrices subjected to sourdough fermentation significantly decreased the release of NO and the synthesis of IFN-gamma. CONCLUSIONS: During manufacture of GF baked goods, the use of sourdough fermentation could be considered as an adjuvant to enhance the recovery from intestinal inflammation of coeliac patients at the early stage of the gluten-free diet.},

   abstract = {Celiac disease is a common and lifelong food intolerance, affecting approximately 1% of the population. Because of a mechanism not completely understood, the ingestion of wheat gluten, and of homologue proteins of barley and rye, induces in genetically predisposed individuals pronounced inflammatory reactions mainly at the site of small intestine. Gluten, the triggering factor, is a complex protein mixture highly resistant to the gastrointestinal enzymatic proteolysis, and this results in the presence of large, and potentially immunogenic, peptides at the intestinal mucosa surface. During the last decade, several studies have defined gluten peptides able to stimulate adaptive T cells, of either CD4 or CD8 phenotype, and to activate innate (non T) immune cells. This review examines the complete repertoire of gluten peptides recognized by celiac T cells and discusses the several translational implications that the identification of these epitopes opens.},

   abstract = {It has been reported that interferon (IFN)-gamma-secreting T cells reactive to gluten can be detected in the peripheral blood of individuals with treated coeliac disease (CD) after a short consumption of wheat-containing food. By contrast, very little is known about the reproducibility of this in-vivo procedure in the same patient cohort which underwent two, or more, gluten consumptions. Fourteen coeliac patients in remission consumed wheat bread for 3 days; 13 underwent a second gluten challenge after a wash-out of 3-10 months on a strict gluten-free diet. Immune reactivity to gluten was analysed in peripheral blood by detecting IFN-gamma before and 6 days after commencing a gluten diet. Gliadin-specific IFN-gamma-secreting CD4(+) T cells increased significantly on day 6 of the first challenge. These cells resulted as prevalently human leucocyte antigen (HLA)-DQ restricted and with a phenotype of gut homing, as suggested by the expression of beta7-integrin. Similarly, reactiveness to gliadin was observed after the second wheat consumption, although with an individual variability of responses at each challenge. Our findings confirmed that the short wheat challenge is a non-invasive approach to investigate the gluten-related immune response in peripheral blood of subjects intolerant to gluten. Furthermore, we demonstrated that the in-vivo procedure can be reproduced in the same subject cohort after a gluten wash-out of at least 3 months. Our study has important implications for the application of this procedure to clinical practice.},

   abstract = {Celiac Disease (CD) occurs in patients with Type 1 Diabetes (T1D) ranging the prevalence of 4.4-11.1% versus 0.5% of the general population. The mechanism of association of these two diseases involves a shared genetic background: HLA genotype DR3-DQ2 and DR4-DQ8 are strongly associated with T1D, DR3-DQ2 with CD. The classical severe presentation of CD rarely occurs in T1D patients, but more often patients have few/mild symptoms of CD or are completely asymptomatic (silent CD). In fact diagnosis of CD is regularly performed by means of the screening in T1D patients. The effects of gluten-free diet (GFD) on the growth and T1D metabolic control in CD/T1D patient are controversial. Regarding of the GFD composition, there is a debate on the higher glycaemic index of gluten-free foods respect to gluten-containing foods; furthermore GFD could be poorer of fibers and richer of fat. The adherence to GFD by children with CD-T1D has been reported generally below 50%, lower respect to the 73% of CD patients, a lower compliance being more frequent among asymptomatic patients. The more severe problems of GFD adherence usually occur during adolescence when in GFD non compliant subjects the lowest quality of life is reported. A psychological and educational support should be provided for these patients.},

   abstract = {Dietary olive oil supplementation and more recently, olive oil phenols have been recommended as important therapeutic interventions in preventive medicine. Ole has several pharmacological properties, including antioxidant, anti-inflammatory, antiatherogenic, anticancer, antimicrobial, and antiviral and for these reasons, is becoming an important subject of study in recent years. The aim of this study was to investigate the effects of Ole aglycone on the modulation of the secondary events in mice subjected to intestinal IRI. This was induced in mice by clamping the superior mesenteric artery and the celiac trunk for 30 min, followed by release of the clamp, allowing reperfusion for 1 h. After 60 min of reperfusion, animals were killed for histological examination of the ileum tissue and immunohistochemical localization of proinflammatory cytokines (TNF-alpha and IL-1beta) and adhesion molecules (ICAM-1 and P-sel); moreover, by Western blot analysis, we investigated the activation of NF-kappaB and IkappaBalpha. In addition, we evaluated the apoptosis process, as shown by TUNEL staining and Bax/Bcl-2 expressions. The results obtained by the histological and molecular examinations showed in Ole aglycone-treated mice, a decrease of inflammation and apoptosis pathway versus SAO-shocked mice. In conclusion, we propose that the olive oil compounds, in particular, the Ole aglycone, could represent a possible treatment against secondary events of intestinal IRI.},

The objectives of this study were to (1) study the occurrence of fumonisins in Catalonia (north-eastern region of Spain) and (2) assess the exposure of the Catalonian population to these mycotoxins. Contamination data was provided by a wide survey where 928 individual samples were pooled to analyse 370 composite samples. Fumonisins were extracted and purified using immunoaffinity columns and determined by HPLC with fluorescence detection. The raw consumption data came from a nutritional study specifically designed to assess the dietary intake of the main foodstuffs related to fumonisin contamination for all population age groups. In addition, two specific groups were selected with respect to maize consumption: immigrants and celiac sufferers. Contamination and consumption data were combined by simulation using an essentially parametric-parametric (P-P) method. The P-P method draws sampling values from distribution functions fitted to consumption and contamination datasets. Moreover, to quantify the accuracy and reliability of the statistical estimates, we built related confidence intervals using a Pseudo-Parametric bootstrap method. The results of this study show that fumonisins are commonly found in some commodities on the Catalonian market, such as beer, corn snacks and ethnic foods; however, the values were well below the permitted maximum EU levels. The most exposed group were infants followed by immigrants but, in all cases, they were below the TDI of 2 microg/kg bw/day.},

AFs were analysed in a total of 603 samples considering special commodities as free-gluten, ethnic or baby foods. Analytical method consisted of an extraction and clean-up of aflatoxins step using immunoaffinity columns, and determination by HPLC with post-column photochemical derivatization and fluorescence detection. Food dietary intake was assessed using a food frequency questionnaire, administered to 1387 individuals by trained interviewers. Contamination and consumption raw datasets were combined by means of a direct method and a stochastic method, building the pseudo-parametric bootstrap confidence intervals of the main outputs. Margins of exposure (MoE) and cancer incidence were estimated for the different collectives. The highest percentages of positive samples were found in red pepper, pistachios and peanuts. Considering our results, the most exposed group was the celiac sufferer collective followed by the adolescents; however health concern should not be expected in the population groups.},

During baking, approximately one-third of the ITFs was lost. The addition of 12% ITFs to the basic formulation is required in order to obtain GFB enriched with 8% ITFs (4 g of fructans per 50 g bread serving size), levels that can provide health benefits. 12% ITFs-addition level decreased GFB glycemic index (from 71 to 48) and glycemic load (from 12 to 8). Prebiotic ITFs are a promising improver for GFB that can provide nutritional (11% dietary fiber content, low glycemic response) and functional benefits to patients with celiac disease, since ITFs are prebiotic ingredients that can also increase calcium absorption.},

   abstract = {Spanish gluten-free rice, cereals with gluten, and pureed baby foods were analysed for total (t-As) and inorganic As (i-As) using ICP-MS and HPLC-ICP-MS, respectively. Besides, pure infant rice from China, USA, UK and Spain were also analysed. The i-As contents were significantly higher in gluten-free rice than in cereals mixtures with gluten, placing infants with celiac disease at high risk. All rice-based products displayed a high i-As content, with values being above 60% of the t-As content and the remainder being dimethylarsinic acid (DMA). Approximately 77% of the pure infant rice samples showed contents below 150 mug kg(-1) (Chinese limit). When daily intake of i-As by infants (4-12 months) was estimated and expressed on a bodyweight basis (mug d(-1) kg(-1)), it was higher in all infants aged 8-12 months than drinking water maximum exposures predicted for adults (assuming 1 L consumption per day for a 10 mug L(-1) standard).},

   abstract = {OBJECTIVES: Non-celiac wheat sensitivity (WS) is considered a new clinical entity. An increasing percentage of the general population avoids gluten ingestion. However, the real existence of this condition is debated and specific markers are lacking. Our aim was thus to demonstrate the existence of WS and define its clinical, serologic, and histological markers. METHODS: We reviewed the clinical charts of all subjects with an irritable bowel syndrome (IBS)-like presentation who had been diagnosed with WS using a double-blind placebo-controlled (DBPC) challenge in the years 2001-2011. One hundred celiac disease (CD) patients and fifty IBS patients served as controls. RESULTS: Two hundred and seventy-six patients with WS, as diagnosed by DBPC challenge, were included. Two groups showing distinct clinical characteristics were identified: WS alone (group 1) and WS associated with multiple food hypersensitivity (group 2). As a whole group, the WS patients showed a higher frequency of anemia, weight loss, self-reported wheat intolerance, coexistent atopy, and food allergy in infancy than the IBS controls. There was also a higher frequency of positive serum assays for IgG/IgA anti-gliadin and cytometric basophil activation in "in vitro" assay. The main histology characteristic of WS patients was eosinophil infiltration of the duodenal and colon mucosa. Patients with WS alone were characterized by clinical features very similar to those found in CD patients. Patients with multiple food sensitivity were characterized by clinical features similar to those found in allergic patients. CONCLUSIONS: Our data confirm the existence of non-celiac WS as a distinct clinical condition. We also suggest the existence of two distinct populations of subjects with WS: one with characteristics more similar to CD and the other with characteristics pointing to food allergy.},

   abstract = {The intestinal epithelial monolayer constitutes a physical and functional barrier between the organism and the external environment. It regulates nutrients absorption, water and ion fluxes, and represents the first defensive barrier against toxins and enteric pathogens. Epithelial cells are linked together at the apical junctional complex by tight junctions that reduce the extracellular space and the passage of charge entities while forming a physical barrier to lipophilic molecules. Cultured intestinal epithelial cells have been extensively used to study intestinal absorption of newly synthesized drugs and the regulation of tight junctions structure and function. In vitro mild irritants, proinflammatory cytokines, toxins and pathogens, and adverse environmental conditions open tight junctions and increase paracellular permeability, an effect often accompanied by immune activation of the enterocytes. Conversely, inhibition of proinflammatory cytokines, exposure to growth factors and probiotics, among others, exert a protective effect. Impaired barrier function results from activation of signalling pathways that lead to alteration of junctional proteins expression and/or distribution. In vivo, intestinal barrier dysfunction is associated with various intestinal and non-intestinal disorders including inflammatory bowel disease, celiac disease, and diarrhoeal infection. This review will describe the current knowledge of the mechanisms regulating tight junctions and intestinal permeability, how these findings have lead to a better understanding of barrier alteration in human intestinal disorders, and what the emerging therapies to treat these pathologies are.},

   abstract = {BACKGROUND: This study explores how a child's coeliac disease (CD) influences the daily life of families because such knowledge can enhance the understanding of how to support family adjustment to a gluten-free diet (GFD). METHODS: We used an interpretative phenomenological approach, interviewing 20 parents of 14 children diagnosed with CD about their individual thoughts and beliefs. RESULTS: Once parents know, especially when their children are young, they seem to have the capacity to rapidly adapt to GFD, mainly because they notice how quickly their children recover. Parents may have problems controlling how staff at daycare and at school complies with their information about a GFD. CONCLUSIONS: To ensure that children with CD are given a GFD at daycare and school, it is necessary for municipalities to educate staff about the disease and to give them the prerequisites for serving a GFD. There is also a need of early identification of children who may have CD. When parents express their worries, not just at the hospital but also at the well-baby clinic and primary care units, supporting treatment could prevent children from suffering from inappropriate food.},

Some physical, chemical, rheological, mechanical and fluidity properties, as well as the color of these mixtures for a period of conservation of 90 days were evaluated. At the end of the storage, the sweet mixture turned out to be of "little flow" and the dessert mixture changed from "little flow" to "easy flow". Viscosity for the dessert mixture, with its two types of dilutions, water and milk, presented a behavior of pseudoplastic fluid. It was possible to guess that the time of shelf life of the mixtures would be of 9 months before achieving the rancidity limit (10 mEq of oxigen/kg of fat, which would disqualify the product for consumption). The CIEL*a*b* color coordinates did not show significant differences keeping the colour in "a beige" tonality.},

A number of human pathologies fall into this category, and a great deal of research has been conducted to learn more about their characteristics and underlying mechanisms. In many cases, a genetic component has been identified, but also external factors like food, smoke, or environmental pollutants can significantly contribute to worsen their symptoms. Accumulated evidence clearly shows that chronic inflammatory diseases are subjected to a redox control. Here, we shall review the identity, source, regulation, and biological activity of redox molecules, to put in a better perspective their key-role in cancer, diabetes, cardiovascular diseases, atherosclerosis, chronic obstructive pulmonary diseases, and inflammatory bowel diseases. In addition, the impact of redox species on autoimmune disorders (rheumatoid arthritis, systemic lupus erythematosus, psoriasis, and celiac disease) and neurodegenerative diseases (Alzheimer's disease, Parkinson's disease, amyotrophic lateral sclerosis, and multiple sclerosis) will be discussed, along with their potential therapeutic implications as novel drugs to combat chronic inflammatory disorders.},

A higher sensitivity was obtained by applying 25 nm gold nanoparticles (AuNPs) to the surface of a bare QCM electrode. Subsequently, chicken anti-gliadin antibodies (IgY) were immobilized directly on the AuNP-modified surface by cross-linking amine groups in IgY with glutaraldehyde. Experimental results revealed that the change in frequency exhibited when 2 ppm gliadin was bound to the AuNP-modified electrode was 35 Hz (48%) greater than that of the bare gold electrode. The linear dynamic range in 60% ethanol was from 1 x 10(1) to 2 x 10(5) ppb gliadin, and the calculated limit of detection (LOD) was 8 ppb. The entire detection process was completed in 40 min and was highly repeatable. Additionally, the AuNP-modified QCM system generated results in the detection of gliadin in 10 commercial food products that were consistent with those obtained using an AOAC-approved gliadin kit. In conclusion, the QCM platform provides a potential alternative means of ensuring that people with wheat allergies and celiac patients have access to gliadin-free food.},

   abstract = {SCOPE: The only treatment available for coeliac disease (CD) is a strict diet in which the intake of wheat, barley, rye, or oats is avoided. Barley is a major cereal crop, grown mainly for its use in brewing, and it has high nutritional value. The identification of varieties with a reduced toxicity profile may contribute to improve the diet, the quality of life and health of CD patients. METHODS AND RESULTS: Searching for harmless barleys, we investigated accessions of malting and wild barley, used for developing new cultivated cereals. The CD toxicity profile of barleys was screened using G12 antibody and cell proliferation and IFN-gamma release from peripheral blood mononuclear cells and intestinal biopsies from CD patients. We found a direct correlation between the reactivity with G12 and the immunogenicity of the different barleys. CONCLUSION: The malting barleys were less immunogenic, with reduced levels of toxic gluten, and were possibly less harmful to CD patients. Our findings could raise the prospect of breeding barley species with low levels of harmful gluten, and the attractive goal of developing nontoxic barley cultivars, always taking into account the Codex standard for foods for special dietary use for persons intolerant to gluten.},

The gluten remaining after processes of malting and brewing is mostly hydrolyzed, which makes practical evaluation of the immunotoxicity of the gluten pools challenging. RESULTS: We analyzed the presence of gluten peptides equivalent to the major immunotoxic protease-resistant gliadin 33-mer in 100 Belgium beers, using monoclonal antibodies (G12/A1). Immunochromatographic strips and enzyme-linked immonosorbent assay G12/A1 methods estimated at least 20 ppm gluten equivalents in 90 beers and gluten-free in 10 beers. The G12/A1 reactivity of beer high-performance liquid chromatographic fractions correlated to the presence of T-cell-reactive epitopes identified by peptide sequencing. CONCLUSION: The determination of equivalent gliadin 33-mer epitopes in beers has been shown to be practical, specific, and sensitive for the measurement of potential immunotoxicity for celiac patients.},

RECENT FINDINGS: In the past number of years, the composition of the microorganisms present in our small intestines has been the subject of greater scrutiny than ever before. These investigations have been possible as a consequence of the development and utilization of new molecular tools which have revolutionized the field of microbial ecology and have focused predominantly on the small intestinal microbiota associated with pediatric celiac disease, inflammatory bowel disease, irritable bowel syndrome and pouchitis. The impact of invasive procedures, such as small bowel transplant, ileostomy and ileal pouch anal anastomosis, on the ileal microbiota has also been investigated. SUMMARY: The ever greater appreciation of the link between the small intestinal microbiota and the health status of the host has the potential to lead to the development of new strategies to alter this microbiota in a targeted way to prevent or treat specific disorders.},

   abstract = {Quinoa fermentation by lactic acid bacteria (LAB) is an interesting alternative to produce new bakery products with high nutritional value; furthermore, they are suitable for celiac patients because this pseudo-cereal contains no gluten. Growth and lactic acid production during slurry fermentations by Lactobacillus plantarum CRL 778 were greater in quinoa (9.8 log cfu/mL, 23.1 g/L) than in wheat (8.9 log cfu/mL, 13.9 g/L). Lactic fermentation indirectly stimulated flour protein hydrolysis by endogenous proteases of both slurries. However, quinoa protein hydrolysis was faster, reaching 40-100% at 8 h of incubation, while wheat protein hydrolysis was only 0-20%. In addition, higher amounts of peptides (24) and free amino acids (5 g/L) were determined in quinoa compared to wheat. Consequently, greater concentrations (approx. 2.6-fold) of the antifungal compounds (phenyllactic and hydroxyphenyllactic acids) were synthesized from Phe and Tyr in quinoa by L. plantarum CRL 778, an antifungal strain. These promising results suggest that this LAB strain could be used in the formulation of quinoa sourdough to obtain baked goods with improved nutritional quality and shelf life, suitable for celiac patients.},

   abstract = {SCOPE: The main objectives of this study were to estimate dietary fumonisin exposure and nutrient intake in a group of patients diagnosed with celiac disease compared to non-celiac subjects. METHODS AND RESULTS: The fumonisin level in 118 frequently consumed corn-based products was determined and dietary habits were recorded using a 7-day weighed food record. Data were then compared to those obtained for a control group. The fumonisin intake in the celiac patients was significantly higher than in controls, with mean values (+/- SE) of 0.395 +/- 0.049 and 0.029 +/- 0.006 mug/kg body weight per day, respectively. With regard to nutritional habits, celiac patients showed a preference for a high fat diet, coupled with a high intake of sweets and soft drinks and a low intake of vegetables, iron, calcium and folate. CONCLUSION: These findings may have serious health implications for the celiac population due to the widespread occurrence of fumonisins in most of the widely consumed gluten-free products, leading to continuous exposure to this particular mycotoxin. Moreover, the recorded nutritional quality of the celiac patient's diet raises concerns regarding its long-term adequacy and its potential impact on chronic conditions such as type 2 diabetes and cardiovascular diseases.},

   abstract = {Coeliac disease (CD) is a very common food-sensitive enteropathy, which is triggered by gluten ingestion and is mediated by CD4(+) T cells. In addition, alterations in the intestinal microbiota that is normally involved in the homeostasis of GALT (gut-associated lymphoid tissue) seem to play a role in CD. In accordance with these findings, we previously reported that Lactobacillus casei can induce a strong enhancement of the T cell-mediated response to gliadin without inducing enteropathy. In this study, we analysed the effects of L. casei administration in a mouse model of gliadin-induced villous damage that was recently developed and involves the inhibition of cyclo-oxygenase (COX) activities in gliadin-sensitized HLA-DQ8 transgenic mice. To address the issue, we assessed the weight loss, the intestinal cytokine pattern, the density of CD25(+) cells and morphometry of the gut mucosa. We confirmed that COX inhibition in sensitized mice caused villus blunting, dysregulated expression of tumour necrosis factor (TNF)-alpha and reduced gliadin-specific IL-2 production. Notably, the administration of probiotic strain induced a complete recovery of villus blunting. This finding was associated with a delay in weight decrease and a recovery of basal TNF-alpha levels, whereas the numbers of CD25(+) cells and the levels of IL-2 remained unchanged. In conclusion, our data suggest that the administration of L. casei can be effective in rescuing the normal mucosal architecture and GALT homeostasis in a mouse model of gliadin-induced enteropathy.},

   abstract = {BACKGROUND: Maize, one of the suitable grains for coeliac consumption, is, together with rice, the most cultivated cereal in the world. However, the inclusion of maize flour in gluten-free bread is a minority and studies are scarce. This paper analyses the influence of different maize flour types and their particle sizes on the quality of two types of bread without gluten (80% and 110% water in the formulation) obtained from them. We also analysed the microstructure of the dough and its behaviour during the fermentation. RESULTS: Finer flours had a lower dough development during fermentation in all cases. Among the different types of flour, those whose microstructure revealed compact particles were those which had higher specific bread volume, especially when the particle size was greater. Among the formulations, the dough with more water gave breads with higher specific volume, an effect that was more important in more compact flours. The higher volume breads had lower values of hardness and resilience. CONCLUSION: The type of corn flour and mainly its particle size influence significantly the dough development of gluten-free bread during fermentation and therefore the final volume and texture of the breads obtained. The flours having coarser particle size are the most suitable for making gluten-free maize bread.},

   abstract = {DC maturation and functions are influenced by microbial and environmental stimuli, which could contribute to immune dysfunction. Here, we have investigated the role of enterobacteria (Escherichia coli CBL2 and Shigella CBD8) isolated from CD patients, bifidobacteria (Bifidobacterium longum CECT 7347 and Bifidobacterium bifidum CECT 7365), and gliadins on phenotypic and functional features of MDDCs and in coculture with Caco-2 cells. The ultimate goal of our study is to understand the roles played by specific components of the gut microbiota in CD. Enterobacteria induced marked alterations in MDDC morphology, inducing podosome dissolution and dendrites, and activated MDDC adhesion and spreading. Enterobacteria also induced inflammatory cytokine production (IFN-gamma, TNF-alpha, and IL-12), partially resembling the gliadin-induced Th1-type cytokine profile. B. longum CECT 7347 and B. bifidum CECT 7365 induced minor MDDC morphological changes and activated adhesion and spreading and inflammatory cytokine production to a lesser extent compared with enterobacteria. B. longum CECT 7347 also induced lower CD86 and CD40 expression on MDDCs than the two enterobacteria. The aforementioned bifidobacterial strain also reduced gliadin-induced IFN-gamma production and increased IL-10 secretion when both stimuli were combined. Similar trends were detected for MDDCs cocultured with Caco-2 cells. B. longum CECT 7347 reversed the gliadin-reduced ZO-1 expression in Caco-2 cells. Thus, our results suggest that specific components of the gut microbiota may influence phenotypic and functional maturation of DCs differently and their interactions with epithelial cells. This could ultimately define the role of DCs in CD progression.},

This group includes approximately 80 disorders, some of which can at times be associated in a single patient. In psoriasis, Crohn's disease may be observed slightly more frequently, but ulcerative colitis and celiac disease are also an issue. The underlying relations between these disorders comprise: i) genetic data obtained by genome-wide association studies that show the involvement of shared predisposing loci and/or genes, for example, in innate immunity; ii) immunological data: these disorders share inflammation effector mechanisms, particularly the activation pathway of Th17 lymphocytes, which explains the efficacy of anti-TNF antibodies and anti-IL-12/23; and iii) environmental co-factors such as smoking, possibly certain food proteins (gliadin, etc.), and bacterial infections that are probably decisive elements in the genesis of these diseases.},

The aim of this study was to verify the incidence of gliadin prick test response in patients affected by MD. STUDY DESIGN: Prospective individual case-control study. METHODS: There were 58 adult patients with definite MD, 25 healthy volunteers, and 25 patients with grass pollen rhinoconjunctivitis tested with skin prick test to gliadin. RESULTS: A total of 33 MD patients (56.9%) proved to be sensitive to gliadin, eight of whom were positive to prick test after 20 minutes, 13 after 6 hours, 11 after 12 hours, and one after 24 hours. CONCLUSIONS: This is the first report of gliadin skin test response in MD. Further studies are needed to define the relationship between immune response to wheat proteins and MD symptoms.},

Although the clinical value of this concept is under debate, the prevalence of nonceliac gluten sensitivity in the general population is supposed to be many times higher than that of celiac disease. The lack of an unambiguous definition of nonceliac gluten sensitivity, a major pitfall, is primarily related to the heterogeneous cause of this condition, whose symptoms are presumed to be caused by different mechanisms. If nonceliac gluten sensitivity is an etiologically heterogeneous syndrome, then management options should vary according to the predominant or concomitant underlying pathogenic pathways.},

   abstract = {Gluten is a commonly used cereal derivative found in bakery products, among other items. In some susceptible individuals, however, it triggers immune responses of different kinds; there is, to a lesser extent, the wheat allergy that is immunoglobulin E (IgE)-mediated and leads to histamine release and typical allergic symptoms. In this case, other water-soluble proteins, like albumins, are also involved. On the other hand, there is, more frequently, celiac disease (CD), where the gluten causes immune reactions in the intestines of certain individuals, leading to degeneration of villi, which typically leads to malabsorption of nutrients and, consequently, malnutrition. The only currently effective health strategy for affected consumers is avoidance of gluten-containing products, based on clear labeling rules. However, despite unanimously accepted Codex definitions by all member jurisdictions, the national implementation of equivalent laws shows significant differences. In the context of CD and in support of the gluten-free statement, regulatory enforcement, as well as manufacturers' quality controls are mostly based on analytical results. However, numerous methods are available, some of which have been validated better than others, and many provide different results on identical samples. Reasons include detection of different gluten components and variability in extraction efficiency due to different buffer compositions, especially from processed foods. Last but not least, the lack of reference materials is hindering the process of generating comparable data across different ELISA kits, as well as other methods. How can such data still be used to support a gluten-free claim? New methodologies, in particular mass spectrometric analysis of gluten derived peptides, are being introduced in numerous laboratories. This methodology is not only capable of detecting gluten derived peptides but can also differentiate between and quantitate wheat, barley, rye, and oat. This paper presents analytical limitations, as well as promising new approaches in support of industry and enforcement activities to ensure compliance with the gluten-free claim under the current regulatory framework.},

   abstract = {Ahipa roots' chemical composition and physiological parameters were characterised; ahipa flour preparation procedures were selected and the chemical composition and functional properties of these products were studied. Ahipa roots and flour can be considered alternative food sources of gluten-free starch, with a considerable contribution of protein, fibre and minerals, such as potassium, calcium and iron. The grating process for ahipa flour production required a pressing step (AFGP) and the recovery of the starch leached. The slicing procedure (AFS) was simpler and the resulting product showed higher contents of potassium, magnesium, calcium and protein than did AFGP, which showed lower sodium and higher acid detergent fibre contents, together with lower gelatinisation temperature. Both flours differed in terms of alpha-amylase activity and swelling power, characteristics that may condition their specific applications, such as the incorporation of these flours as gluten-free functional food ingredients.},

   abstract = {BACKGROUND: Chronic mesenteric ischemia (CMI) is a rare diagnosis for patients in their third decade of life. Other conditions can mimic the signs and symptoms of CMI, including median arcuate ligament syndrome (MALS), primary arteritides, and congenital anomalies. Here, we present the case of a 26-year-old man who presented with CMI and multivessel mesenteric occlusive disease. METHODS: A 26-year-old man presented with a 6-month history of 40-pound weight loss, postprandial abdominal pain, and food fear. His physical examination showed a scaphoid abdomen with no tenderness. Findings from laboratory evaluation were normal. Computed tomography angiogram revealed celiac artery (CA) occlusion and >80% superior mesenteric artery (SMA) stenosis, with a large marginal artery of Drummond supplying collateral circulation. RESULTS: A retroperitoneal exposure of the perivisceral aorta was performed. Surgical exposure revealed compression of both CA and SMA by the MAL. The total distance of caudal arterial displacement was >3 cm. Both the CA and SMA were chronically stenotic/occluded secondary to this compression. After division of the MAL, a retrograde aortoceliac and aortomesenteric bypass was performed for mesenteric revascularization. The patient recovered uneventfully and was discharged home on the third day after surgery tolerating a full diet. CONCLUSIONS: MALS is a pathologic entity that can affect more than the CA. This case demonstrates multivessel, mesenteric arterial insufficiency secondary to MALS sufficient to promote IMA collateralization of the SMA circulation. In young patients with CMI, multivessel MALS must be considered. In addition to MAL release, arterial revascularization may be necessary owing to stenoses from chronic compression.},

   abstract = {BACKGROUND & AIMS: Patients with celiac disease have permanent intolerance to gluten. Because of the high frequency of this disorder (approximately 1 in 100 individuals), we investigated whether oral tolerance to gluten differs from that to other food proteins. METHODS: Using transgenic mice that express human HLA-DQ2 and a gliadin-specific, humanized T-cell receptor, we compared gluten-specific T-cell responses with tolerogenic mucosal T-cell responses to the model food protein ovalbumin. RESULTS: Consistent with previous findings, the ovalbumin-specific response occurred in the mesenteric lymph nodes and induced Foxp3(+) regulatory T cells. In contrast, ingestion of deamidated gliadin induced T-cell proliferation predominantly in the spleen but little in mesenteric lymph nodes. The gliadin-reactive T cells had an effector-like phenotype and secreted large amounts of interferon gamma but also secreted interleukin-10. Despite their effector-like phenotype, gliadin-reactive T cells had regulatory functions, because transfer of the cells suppressed a gliadin-induced, delayed-type hypersensitivity response. CONCLUSIONS: Ingestion of deamidated gliadin induces differentiation of tolerogenic, type 1 regulatory T cells in spleens of HLA-DQ2 transgenic mice. These data indicate that under homeostatic conditions, the T-cell response to deamidated gliadin is tolerance, which is not conditioned by the mucosal immune system but instead requires interleukin-10 induction by antigen presentation in the spleen.},

   abstract = {The term oral (or mucosal) tolerance has been classically defined as the suppression of T- and B-cell responses to an antigen by prior administration of the antigen by the oral route. In recent years, it has become clear that both innate and acquired regulatory immune responses are essential for the development of oral tolerance. As such, mucosal microenvironmental factors such as transforming growth factor- beta, prostaglandins but also dietary vitamin A create conditioning of an adaptive regulatory T-cell response that suppresses subsequent antigen-specific responses. Particular resident subsets of antigen presenting dendritic cells are pivotal to convey conditioning signals next to the presentation of antigen. This review discusses the primary mechanisms of adaptive regulatory T-cell induction to ingested soluble protein antigen. However, we also discuss the limitations of our knowledge with respect to understanding the very common food hypersensitivity Celiac disease caused by an aberrant adaptive immune response to the food protein gluten.},

   abstract = {BACKGROUND: Wheat flour is one of the world's major food ingredients, in part because of the unique end-use qualities conferred by the abundant glutamine- and proline-rich gluten proteins. Many wheat flour proteins also present dietary problems for consumers with celiac disease or wheat allergies. Despite the importance of these proteins it has been particularly challenging to use MS/MS to distinguish the many proteins in a flour sample and relate them to gene sequences. RESULTS: Grain from the extensively characterized spring wheat cultivar Triticum aestivum 'Butte 86' was milled to white flour from which proteins were extracted, then separated and quantified by 2-DE. Protein spots were identified by separate digestions with three proteases, followed by tandem mass spectrometry analysis of the peptides. The spectra were used to interrogate an improved protein sequence database and results were integrated using the Scaffold program. Inclusion of cultivar specific sequences in the database greatly improved the results, and 233 spots were identified, accounting for 93.1% of normalized spot volume. Identified proteins were assigned to 157 wheat sequences, many for proteins unique to wheat and nearly 40% from Butte 86. Alpha-gliadins accounted for 20.4% of flour protein, low molecular weight glutenin subunits 18.0%, high molecular weight glutenin subunits 17.1%, gamma-gliadins 12.2%, omega-gliadins 10.5%, amylase/protease inhibitors 4.1%, triticins 1.6%, serpins 1.6%, purinins 0.9%, farinins 0.8%, beta-amylase 0.5%, globulins 0.4%, other enzymes and factors 1.9%, and all other 3%. CONCLUSIONS: This is the first successful effort to identify the majority of abundant flour proteins for a single wheat cultivar, relate them to individual gene sequences and estimate their relative levels. Many genes for wheat flour proteins are not expressed, so this study represents further progress in describing the expressed wheat genome. Use of cultivar-specific contigs helped to overcome the difficulties of matching peptides to gene sequences for members of highly similar, rapidly evolving storage protein families. Prospects for simplifying this process for routine analyses are discussed. The ability to measure expression levels for individual flour protein genes complements information gained from efforts to sequence the wheat genome and is essential for studies of effects of environment on gene expression.},

   abstract = {BACKGROUND: Celiac disease (CD) is an autoimmune disease characterized by immunemediated inflammatory damage of the small intestinal mucosa, precipitated by the ingestion of gluten-containing foods. Since human leucocyte antigen DQ2 (HLA-DQ2) is a marker of nonresponsiveness to hepatits B virus (HBV) vaccine, CD may also be associated with this nonresponsiveness. OBJECTIVES: The aim of this study was to compare the responses to HBV vaccine between children with CD and healthy children. We also investigated the relationship between the patients' responses to hepatitis B vaccine, the clinical presentation of CD, and dietary compliance in the patients. PATIENTS AND METHODS: We recruited 52 children with CD and 20 age- and sex-matched healthy children who received HBV vaccination according to the standard immunization schedule. The production of specific antihepatitis B surface antigen (HBsAg) antibodies was evaluated in all patients and control participants. Subjects with less than 10 IU/L anti-HBs were consided nonresponders to the vaccination. RESULTS: 31 of the 52 patients (59.6%) were female and 21 (40.4%) were male. The mean age of the CD patients was 10.7 +/- 4 years (range, 4-18 years). Anti-HBs titers were positive in 32 (61.5%) patients and negative in 20 (38.5%) patients, while they were positive in 18 (90%) of the children in the control group (P < 0.05). We found statistically significant differences between negative anti-HBs titers, clinical presentation of CD, and dietary compliance in patients with CD (P < 0.05). CONCLUSIONS: Nonresponsiveness to hepatitis B vaccination was more frequently found in children with CD than in the control group. Therefore, the response to HBV vaccination should be investigated in children with CD, and a different immunization schedule may need to be developed. Further, compliance to the prescribed gluten-free diet (GFD) may improve the immune response to HBV vaccination in children with CD.},

   abstract = {OBJECTIVE: The aim of this study was to evaluate eating habits and nutritional behaviors of women in the perimenopausal period with celiac disease diagnosed within the last 4 years. MATERIAL AND METHOD: The study covered a group of 26 women, at the age of 51-54 years, with celiac disease diagnosed in the last 4 years and staying on a gluten-free diet for 6 months to 4 years and agreed to participate in this studies. Information of nutrition were collected from the women, who, after an appropriate instruction, recorded the timing, type and amount of food consumed in the three days a week, selected at random. The amount of consumed portions was defined on the basis of the "Book of portions, products and dishes". The menus (78) were recorded in April and May. Collected data were prepared, based on a computer program Dietetyk 2009 Prof. RESULTS: The analysis of results achieved in this study enabled concluding that--from the viewpoint of the diagnosed disease--the nutritional patterns of the women were very appropriate. However, it failed to meet basic nutritional guidelines, which was reflected in, among other things, unsatisfactory intake of vegetables, fruits, oils and water, and in excessive intake of protein of animal origin. In addition, it did not cover demands resulting from the perimenopausal period the surveyed women were in, which is likely to facilitate, e.g. disorders in lipid metabolism and water-mineral balance, as well as development of osteoporosis. CONCLUSIONS: The general picture of behaviors, including the nutritional ones, pointed to a strong predominance of the diagnosed disease but also to the need of compensating for the resultant restrictions, with the latter being perceived by the surveyed women as health-promoting actions.},

Previous studies have shown that sympathetic innervation of the gut is necessary for duodenal infusions of fat to induce satiety, suggesting that sympathetic activity may engage small-intestinal satiety signals such as OEA and NPPE. In the present study, we show that surgical resection of the sympathetic celiac-superior mesenteric ganglion complex, which sends projections to the upper gut, abolishes feeding-induced OEA production in rat small-intestinal cells. These effects are accounted for by suppression of OEA biosynthesis, and are mimicked by administration of the selective beta2-adrenergic receptor antagonist ICI-118,551. We further show that sympathetic ganglionectomy or pharmacological blockade of beta2-adrenergic receptors prevents NPPE release into the circulation. In addition, sympathetic ganglionectomy increases meal frequency and lowers satiety ratio, and these effects are corrected by pharmacological administration of OEA. The results suggest that sympathetic activity controls fat-induced satiety by enabling the coordinated production of local (OEA) and systemic (NPPE) satiety signals in the small intestine.},

   abstract = {The aim of the study was to show patients suffering from the coeliac disease, their real gliadin daily intake, offer them very useful information concerning their diet and to find random possible mistakes. The monitoring was carried out within the context of their routine everyday diet regimen. The daily intake of gliadin in the diet was quantified on the basis of gliadin determination in their current daily food. The gluten-free diet was followed for 30 days. The patients were taking regular daily meals, drinks, and sometimes medicines or food supplements. The patients were provided with instructions, survey forms, digital scales, polyethylen bottles and sacks. The patients took out the stipulated amount, which served as a sample of each of their daily meals. The samples included both homemade meals as well as commercial products. The content of gliadin in daily meal was determined by the sandwich ELISA method. The daily gliadin intake was calculated on the base of the reported amount of meals ingested. 1,900 food samples were analyzed within the framework of this study. Several contaminated commercial foods were found; nevertheless this fact did not influence the otherwise satisfactory overall picture of the daily gliadin intake by the patients followed. The results in 14 patients revealed a satisfactory adherence to the gluten-free diet. It was proved that conscientiousness and awareness on the part of coeliac patients, or those taking care of them, is of paramount importance in determining the choice of foods comprising a gluten-free diet.},

   abstract = {Celiac disease (CD) is a primarily digestive systemic disease triggered and maintained by the ingestion of gluten in the diet. Its has a wide clinical spectrum of manifestations, particularly varied in adult patients, in whom, because of their frequent negative serology and mild, nonspecific symptoms, there is a considerable delay in diagnosis. The intestinal lesion caused by CD leads to various deficiencies of nutrients, vitamins, and dietary minerals, with ferropenia, vitamin B12, folic acid, and fat-soluble vitamin deficiencies being especially frequent. The deficiencies, together with dairy intolerance, cause low bone density and an increased risk of fractures. Treatment using a gluten-free diet (GFD) does involve certain complications, since gluten is found in up to 70% of manufactured food products and manufacturing regulations are not standard in all countries. In addition, certain nutrient deficiencies require specific management. This article reviews the nutritional aspects of CD and provides practical guidelines to correct these deficiencies and to ensure optimum GFD compliance.},

   abstract = {The demand for gluten-free foods is certainly increasing. Interest in teff has increased noticeably due to its very attractive nutritional profile and gluten-free nature of the grain, making it a suitable substitute for wheat and other cereals in their food applications as well as foods for people with celiac disease. The main objective of this article is to review researches on teff, evaluate its suitability for different food applications, and give direction for further research on its applications for health food market. Teff is a tropical low risk cereal that grows in a wider ecology and can tolerate harsh environmental conditions where most other cereals are less viable. It has an excellent balance of amino acid composition (including all 8 essential amino acids for humans) making it an excellent material for malting and brewing. Because of its small size, teff is made into whole-grain flour (bran and germ included), resulting in a very high fiber content and high nutrient content in general. Teff is useful to improve the haemoglobin level in human body and helps to prevent malaria, incidence of anaemia and diabetes. The nutrient composition of teff grain indicates that it has a good potential to be used in foods and beverages worldwide. The high levels of simple sugars and alpha-amino acids as a result of breakdown of starch and protein, respectively, are essential for fermentation and beer making.},

   abstract = {BACKGROUND: Research is intense to find wheat of low or null toxicity for patients with celiac disease (CD). Among candidates, there are diploid wheat species. OBJECTIVE: We compared the immunological properties of 2 lines of diploid monococcum wheat (Triticum monococcum ssp. monococcum), Monlis and ID331, with those of common wheat (Triticum aestivum). DESIGN: Interferon-gamma production and the proliferation of intestinal gliadin-specific T cell lines and clones were measured as evidence of T cell activation by peptic and tryptic (PT) digests of gliadins from 2 monococcum lines. Furthermore, organ cultures of jejunal biopsies from 28 CD patients were set up to assess the effects of PT gliadin on innate and adaptive immune response by using immunohistochemistry. RESULTS: Monlis and ID331 induced interferon-gamma production and proliferation in celiac mucosal T cells. In organ cultures, Monlis PT digest induced a significant increase of IL-15 epithelial expression and crypt enterocyte proliferation, whereas ID331 had no effect. Both monococcum lines caused intraepithelial T cell infiltration and lamina propria T cell activation. CONCLUSIONS: Our data show that the monococcum lines Monlis and ID331 activate the CD T cell response and suggest that these lines are toxic for celiac patients. However, ID331 is likely to be less effective in inducing CD because of its inability to activate the innate immune pathways.},

   abstract = {BACKGROUND: In patients with treated celiac disease (CD), the ingestion of gluten traces contained in gluten-free (GF) wheat substitutes (eg, GF bread, flour, and pasta) could cause persisting intestinal mucosal damage. OBJECTIVE: The objective was to evaluate the proportion of CD patients at risk of mucosal damage due to the consumption of GF products in 4 European countries (Italy, Spain, Germany, and Norway). DESIGN: A probabilistic modeling approach was used to assess the risk of gluten intake at the population level. The input variables were 1) consumption of GF products, 2) concentration of gluten traces in GF products determined by the sandwich R5 ELISA method, and 3) the gluten threshold for mucosal damage of 10 to 50 mg/d. Different population and product availability scenarios were examined for risk assessment. RESULTS: The gluten content of 205 commercially available GF products ranged between <5 and 27.8 mg/kg. Overall, 99.5% of the analyzed samples had a gluten concentration <20 mg/kg. Most (94%) had a gluten concentration below the limit of quantification (5 mg/kg). The mean percentage of the CD European population at risk of mucosal damage resulting from consumption of GF products ranged between 0.01 (Germany) and 0.15 (Italy) and remained very low, even in the worst-case scenario (<1%). CONCLUSIONS: The adoption of a single gluten threshold (20 mg/kg) for gluten contamination is suggested. GF products in Europe constitute a very safe option for patients with CD. The dietary follow-up of CD patients should focus on other potential sources of gluten contamination.},

   abstract = {Recognition of food components that induce functional gut symptoms in patient's functional bowel disorders (FBD) has been challenging. Food directly or indirectly provides considerable afferent input into the enteric nervous system. There is an altered relationship between the afferent input and perception/efferent response in FBD. Defining the nature of food-related stimuli may provide a means of minimizing such an input and gut symptoms. Using this premise, reducing the intake of FODMAPs (fermentable oligo-, di-, and mono-saccharides and polyols)--poorly absorbed short-chain carbohydrates that, by virtue of their small molecular size and rapid fermentability, will distend the intestinal lumen with liquid and gas--improves symptoms in the majority of patients. Well-developed methodologies to deliver the diet via dietician-led education are available. Another abundant source of afferent input is natural and added food chemicals (such as salicylates, amines, and glutamates). Studies are needed to assess the efficacy of the low food chemical dietary approach. A recent placebo-controlled trial of FODMAP-poor gluten provided the first valid evidence that non-celiac gluten intolerance might actually exist, but its prevalence and underlying mechanisms require elucidation. Food choice via the low FODMAP and potentially other dietary strategies is now a realistic and efficacious therapeutic approach for functional gut symptoms.},

METHODS: Consecutive patients with RAP (Apley criteria), age 4-16 years, referred to a secondary medical centre were evaluated by a standardized history, physical examination and laboratory tests. The tests encompassed Helicobacter pylori (Hp), gastrointestinal bacterial infections, protozoa, coeliac disease, carbohydrate malabsorption, food intolerance, abdominal ultrasound and plain abdominal X-ray. More investigations were obtained if indicated. Patient characteristics were compared with surgical patients without abdominal pain (control group). RESULTS: A total of 220 consecutive patients were included (92 M, mean age 8.8 years [4.1-16.0 years]). In 88% of the patients, abnormalities were found that refer to possible causes. Especially, protozoa were present in 33% of the patients, mostly Dientamoeba fragilis, Yersinia enterocolitica in 12% and endoscopically proven infection with Hp in 11%. In 36%, a plain abdominal X-ray raised suspicion of constipation. CONCLUSION: In 220 consecutive patients with RAP, referred to secondary care, a standardized work-up yielded abnormal results in a high percentage. The clinical significance of these findings remains to be established.},

   abstract = {BACKGROUND & AIMS: Celiac disease (CD) is characterized by an inflammatory response to wheat gluten, rye, and barley proteins. Fermentation of wheat flour with sourdough lactobacilli and fungal proteases decreases the concentration of gluten. We evaluated the safety of daily administration of baked goods made from this hydrolyzed form of wheat flour to patients with CD. METHODS: Patients were randomly assigned to consumption of 200 g per day of natural flour baked goods (NFBG) (80,127 ppm gluten; n = 6), extensively hydrolyzed flour baked goods (S1BG) (2480 ppm residual gluten; n = 2), or fully hydrolyzed baked goods (S2BG) (8 ppm residual gluten; n = 5) for 60 days. RESULTS: Two of the 6 patients who consumed NFBG discontinued the challenge because of symptoms; all had increased levels of anti-tissue transglutaminase (tTG) antibodies and small bowel deterioration. The 2 patients who ate the S1BG goods had no clinical complaints but developed subtotal atrophy. The 5 patients who ate the S2BG had no clinical complaints; their levels of anti-tTG antibodies did not increase, and their Marsh grades of small intestinal mucosa did not change. CONCLUSIONS: A 60-day diet of baked goods made from hydrolyzed wheat flour, manufactured with sourdough lactobacilli and fungal proteases, was not toxic to patients with CD. A combined analysis of serologic, morphometric, and immunohistochemical parameters is the most accurate method to assess new therapies for this disorder.},

   abstract = {AIM: To estimate the burden of undiagnosed celiac disease (CD) in the Mediterranean area in terms of morbidity, mortality and health cost. METHODS: For statistics regarding the population of each country in the Mediterranean area, we accessed authoritative international sources (World Bank, World Health Organization and United Nations). The prevalence of CD was obtained for most countries from published reports. An overall prevalence rate of 1% cases/total population was finally estimated to represent the frequency of the disease in the area, since none of the available confidence intervals of the reported rates significantly excluded this rate. The distribution of symptoms and complications was obtained from reliable reports in the same cohort. A standardized mortality rate of 1.8 was obtained from recent reports. Crude health cost was estimated for the years between symptoms and diagnosis for adults and children, and was standardized for purchasing power parity to account for the different economic profiles amongst Mediterranean countries. RESULTS: In the next 10 years, the Mediterranean area will have about half a billion inhabitants, of which 120 million will be children. The projected number of CD diagnoses in 2020 is 5 million cases (1 million celiac children), with a relative increase of 11% compared to 2010. Based on the 2010 rate, there will be about 550,000 symptomatic adults and about 240,000 sick children: 85% of the symptomatic patients will suffer from gastrointestinal complaints, 40% are likely to have anemia, 30% will likely have osteopenia, 20% of children will have short stature, and 10% will have abnormal liver enzymes. The estimated standardized medical costs for symptomatic celiac patients during the delay between symptom onset and diagnosis (mean 6 years for adults, 2 years for children) will be about euro4 billion (euro387 million for children) over the next 10 years. A delay in diagnosis is expected to increase mortality: about 600,000 celiac patients will die in the next 10 years, with an excess of 44.4% vs age- and sex-matched controls. CONCLUSION: In the near future, the burden of CD will increase tremendously. Few Mediterranean countries are able to face this expanding epidemic alone.},

   abstract = {Adverse reactions to foods are extremely common, and generally they are attributed to allergy. However, clinical manifestations of various degrees of severity related to ingestion of foods can arise as a result of a number of disorders, only some of which can be defined as allergic, implying an immune mechanism. Recent epidemiological data in North America showed that the prevalence of food allergy in children has increased. The most common food allergens in the United States include egg, milk, peanut, tree nuts, wheat, crustacean shellfish, and soy. This review examines the various forms of food intolerances (immunoglobulin E [IgE] and non-IgE mediated), including celiac disease and gluten sensitivity. Immune mediated reactions can be either IgE mediated or non-IgE mediated. Among the first group, Immediate GI hypersensitivity and oral allergy syndrome are the best described. Often, but not always, IgE-mediated food allergies are entities such as eosinophilic esophagitis and eosinophilic gastroenteropathy. Non IgE-mediated immune mediated food reactions include celiac disease and gluten sensitivity, two increasingly recognized disorders. Finally, non-immune mediated reactions encompass different categories such as disorders of digestion and absorption, inborn errors of metabolism, as well as pharmacological and toxic reactions.},

   abstract = {UNLABELLED: The microstructural, physical, and sensory properties of low-fat sauces made with different starches, soy protein, and inulin as a fat replacer were analyzed. Gluten-free waxy starches-rice and corn-were selected as well as soy protein to obtain sauces suitable for celiac and lactose intolerant consumers. Light microscopy was used to visualize the swollen starch granules dispersed in a protein-amylopectin-inulin phase. Inulin seemed to limit protein network development, which was related with a higher dispersion of starch granules within the sauce matrix. Therefore, the sauces made with inulin had a lower apparent viscosity (eta(app)) values (P < 0.05) in comparison with oil sauces. The sauces made with rice starches also exhibited a lower viscosity (P < 0.05) since these granules did not swell as corn granules do. All the sauces had a remarkable physical stability since there were no syneresis phenomena and color did not change significantly (P < 0.05) after 15 d of refrigeration storage (4 degrees C). Finally, the sensory test suggests that oil could be substituted by inulin in the preparation of low-fat sauces since no significant differences (P < 0.05) in texture and flavor were found. These results encourage further research to optimize the formulations of these types of alternative white sauces. PRACTICAL APPLICATION: Nowadays there is a great demand of ready-to-eat products due to new consumptions habits. In this context, it would be interesting to develop low-fat sauces with inulin that could be used in this type of products improving their nutritional profile. The requirement of processed food for specific groups of population, such as celiac and lactose intolerant consumers, makes it necessary to use gluten free starches and soy protein in the formulation of sauces. The characterization of structural, physical and sensory properties is required to understand the product acceptability and its behavior during its shelf life.},

   abstract = {Chicken egg yolk immunoglobulin Y (IgY) is a promising alternative for the prevention of enteric gliadin absorption, the predisposing factor of celiac disease (CD). IgY antibody was produced from the egg yolk of Single Comb White Leghorn chickens during the immunization period for the development of an oral immunotherapeutic agent. Here, we report the potential use of spray dried IgY antibody formulation using sugar protectants (mannitol, sorbitol, or microcrystalline cellulose powder (MCCP)). The long-term stability of the spray dried egg yolk powder formulated with 37.5% mannitol (EYP-M) preserved IgY antibody activity at 99.9%, which was significantly higher than that with other protectants (p < 0.05). In a dissolution test, the EYP-M shows 82.4% IgY activity after 2 h in simulated gastric fluid (SGF). A competitive ELISA at 50% inhibition (IC(50)) shows that 1.6 mg/mL EYP-M bound to 7.6 mg/mL and 10.5 mg/mL gliadin in SGF without and with food matrix conditions, respectively, whereas in simulated intestinal fluid, the formulation bound to 10 mg/mL gliadin, regardless of a food matrix. In-vivo study: BALB/c mice fed with EYP-M and gliadin at a ratio of 1:5 (w/w) demonstrated that gliadin absorption in the gastrointestinal tract was minimal at <1%. Thus, EYP-M containing IgY antibody may be used in CD patients to eliminate the effects of ingested toxic gliadin.},

   abstract = {There is growing evidence that many aspects of our lifestyle and the environment we now live in contribute to the development of disease. The luminal digestive tract is a clear target of the influence of dietary components, alcohol, microbial organisms, and other ingested materials. External factors including obesity, lack of physical exercise, and tobacco consumption also impact diseases of the luminal gastrointestinal (GI) tract. A growing understanding of the microbiome which forms an integral part of the human organism indicates that this is another important external force that impacts human health and disease. The luminal GI tract conditions that arise, at least in part, from these external factors range from malignancies (squamous cell esophageal cancer, Barrett's esophagus and associated esophageal adenocarcinoma, gastric cancer, and colorectal cancer), idiopathic inflammatory disorders such as inflammatory bowel diseases, and post-infectious syndromes including post-infectious irritable bowel syndrome, post-infectious dyspepsia and other functional GI disorders. Of particular interest, given their increase in prevalence in much of the world, are immune-mediated conditions in which food antigens are the driving force behind disease development. These entities include celiac disease, eosinophilic esophagitis, and food allergies. Celiac disease is a prime example of a condition mediated by dietary factors whose pathogenesis has only recently been determined, providing opportunities for developing treatment options beyond the gluten-free diet. While a genetic basis for this disease clearly exists, it is believed that environmental factors such as an increase in gluten in the human diet account for its rising prevalence, now roughly 1% of genetically susceptible populations in all continents. Proposed therapeutic strategies span from preventing disease by modulating the time of gluten introduction in infants, to reducing exposure to gluten by developing strains of wheat with lower levels of gluten, degrading ingested gluten peptides within the intestinal lumen via endopeptidases or modulating uptake of these peptides across intestinal tight junctions. Other novel treatments in development focus on interfering with the immune events that lead to disease once gluten accesses the lamina propria including altering the immune milieu from a Th1-predominant response via hookworm infection, inhibiting tissue transglutaminase, and blocking antigen presentation and/or T-cell responses to gluten peptides. While new treatment options for celiac disease reflect the complex interaction of diet, genetic factors and the host immune response, the implications for treatment of many conditions of the large and small intestine that arise from environmental and lifestyle are as basic as ensuring adequate nutrition, regular exercise and cessation of tobacco use. Much more needs to be learned about the microbiome, dietary and other factors and their interaction with the human host in order to develop potential new treatment strategies for diseases that result from the environment and lifestyle.},

Besides food products that are naturally gluten-free, "very low gluten" and "gluten-free" bakery products have become available. The availability of immunochemical and other analytical methods to determine gluten markers in foods is of utmost importance to ensure the well being of gluten-sensitive individuals. The aim of this review was to evaluate if currently available methodologies are suitable to meet the requirements of food labeling standards for individual gluten source declaration, in order to achieve policy objectives. Codex Alimentarius and European Union (EU) legislation and gluten detection methodologies applicable at present have been summarized and compared. In 2009, the European Commission issued Regulation No. 41/2009 concerning the composition and labeling of foodstuffs suitable for people intolerant to gluten. This review constitutes a basis to investigate the possibility to develop a proteomic-based method for the specific detection of gluten-containing cereals in food products, especially at or around the limits specified in EU legislation.},

   abstract = {The aqueous alcohol-soluble fraction of wheat gluten is gliadin. This component has been implicated as the causative principle in celiac disease, which is a physiological condition experienced by some infants and adults. The outcome of the ingestion of whole wheat products by susceptible individuals is malabsorption of nutrients resulting from loss of intestinal vili, the nutrient absorption regions of the digestive system. This leads to incessant diarrhea and weight loss in these individuals. Only recently has this health condition been properly recognized and accurately diagnosed in this country. The culprit gliadin is characterized by preponderant glutamine side-chain residues on the protein surface. Gliadin is commercially available as a wheat gluten extract, and in our search for new biobased and environmentally friendly products from renewable agricultural substrates, we have exploited the availability of the glutamine residues of gliadin as synthons to produce novel elastomeric nonfood products dubbed "milkglyde", "saliglyde", and soyglyde from milkweed, salicornia and soybean oils. The reaction is an amidolysis of the oxirane groups of derivatized milkweed, salicornia, and soybean oils under neat reaction conditions with the primary amide functionalties of glutamine to give the corresponding amidohyroxy gliadinyl triglycerides, respectively. The differential scanning calorimetry, thermogravimetric analyses, and rheological data from a study of these products indicate properties similar to those of synthetic rubber.},

We investigated whether synthetic peptides with high affinity to wheat gliadin could be selected with a phage display technique and whether complexes between such peptides and gliadin could sustain gastric and pancreatic digestion. Two synthetic peptides, P61 and P64, were selected because of their high affinity to immobilized gliadin. They were allowed to form complexes with gliadin, whereafter the complexes were subjected to in vitro digestion with gastric and pancreatic enzymes. The digestion products were analyzed with Western blot and RP HPLC. The results showed that both peptides formed stable complexes with intact gliadin and that complexes between gliadin and peptide P64 partly resisted gastrointestinal digestion. The two peptides reduced the binding of serum anti-gliadin IgA antibodies by 12%, and 11.5%, respectively, and the binding of anti-gliadin antibodies of the IgG isotype by 13% and 10%. Thus peptides produced by a phage display technique could interact stably with gliadin partly masking epitopes for antibody binding. A combination of peptides of this kind may be used to block gliadin-immune system interactions.},

Development and validation of such an instrument (FQ-gluten4) was the aim of the present study. METHODS: The FQ-gluten was adapted according to age-related food consumption. The results of this FQ-gluten4 were compared with the results of a 2-day food record. RESULTS: Seventy-one parents filled in both instruments. The mean amount of gluten consumption calculated from the FQ-gluten4 was comparable with that of the food record, but significant differences were found in the amount of gluten intake in 1- to 2-year-old children and in the percentage of gluten from porridge among the 1- to 3-year-olds. The Blant-Altman limits of agreement with standard deviation of 2600 mg were -5118 to 5630 mg. CONCLUSIONS: The new, short, standardized, validated, and easy-to-use FQ-gluten4 may be a useful instrument in the assessment of gluten intake in young children. Using this standardized method provides opportunity for better comparison of the results of gluten consumption in studies throughout the world. Furthermore, such an instrument can be used to quantify the gluten intake in individuals suspected to have celiac disease but in whom the diagnoses cannot be confirmed.},

We sought to determine whether these effects are altered in animals that developed obesity in response to a medium high-fat diet (MHFD). Male Sprague-Dawley rats were placed on a low-fat diet (LFD; n = 8) or a MHFD (n = 24) for 13 wk, after which the animals were anesthetized and artificially ventilated. Arterial pressure was monitored and blood was collected for the determination of plasma leptin and CCK. SSND responses to leptin (15 mug/kg) and CCK (2 mug/kg) administered close to the coeliac artery were evaluated. Collectively, MHFD animals had significantly higher plasma leptin but lower plasma CCK levels than LFD rats (P < 0.05), and this corresponded to attenuated or reversed SSND responses to CCK (LFD, -21 +/- 2%; and MHFD, -12 +/- 2%; P < 0.05) and leptin (LFD, -6 +/- 2%; and MHFD, 4 +/- 1%; P < 0.001). Alternatively, animals on the MHFD were stratified into obesity-prone (OP; n = 8) or obesity-resistant (OR; n = 8) groups according to their weight gain falling within the upper or lower tertile, respectively. OP rats had significantly higher resting arterial pressure, adiposity, and plasma leptin but lower plasma CCK compared with LFD rats (P < 0.05). The SSND responses to CCK or leptin were not significantly different between OP and OR animals. These results demonstrate that a high-fat diet is associated with blunted splanchnic sympathoinhibitory responses to gastric leptin and CCK and may impact on sympathetic vasomotor mechanisms involved in circulatory control.},

RESEARCH DESIGN AND METHODS: A total of 150 infants with a first-degree family history of type 1 diabetes and a risk HLA genotype were randomly assigned to a first gluten exposure at age 6 months (control group) or 12 months (late-exposure group) and were followed 3 monthly until the age of 3 years and yearly thereafter for safety (for growth and autoantibodies to transglutaminase C [TGCAs]), islet autoantibodies to insulin, GAD, insulinoma-associated protein 2, and type 1 diabetes. RESULTS: Adherence to the dietary-intervention protocol was reported from 70% of families. During the first 3 years, weight and height were similar in children in the control and late-exposure groups, as was the probability of developing TGCAs (14 vs. 4%; P = 0.1). Eleven children in the control group and 13 children in the late-exposure group developed islet autoantibodies (3-year risk: 12 vs. 13%; P = 0.6). Seven children developed diabetes, including four in the late-exposure group. No significant differences were observed when children were analyzed as per protocol on the basis of the reported first gluten exposure of the children. CONCLUSIONS: Delaying gluten exposure until the age of 12 months is safe but does not substantially reduce the risk for islet autoimmunity in genetically at-risk children.},

   abstract = {Laparosocpy-assisted pylorus-preserving gastrectomy (LAPPG) is a widely accepted surgical procedure for the treatment of early gastric cancer in the middle third of the stomach. We have been performing this operation since 2007. Compared with traditional distal gastrectomy, LAPPG has postoperative nutritional benefits for patients. However, this procedure preserves only the pyloric branch of the vagus nerve and not the celiac branch. We found that patients retain a large amount of residual food in the gastric remnant, which interferes with the detection of secondary cancer on endoscopic follow-up. To improve the pyloric function and postoperative gastrointestinal motility, we changed our procedure during 2009 to preserve both the pyloric and celiac branches of the vagus nerve, and we named this new procedure laparoscopy-assisted vagus nerve and pylorus-preserving gastrectomy (LAVNPPG). From 2009 to 2011, 11 patients underwent LAVNPPG at our hospital. Retrospective comparison of the safety of operation, postoperative complications, and condition of the gastric remnant between LAPPG (n = 13) and LAVNPPG (n = 11) found that the occurrence of postprandial stasis and food residue in the gastric remnant tended to be lower following LAVNPPG, though the differences were not significant. These findings indicate that LAVNPPG may be an operative procedure that could replace LAPPG.},

   abstract = {AIMS AND OBJECTIVES: To investigate current nutrition counselling practices, knowledge of nutrition and the need for nutrition education by nurses in mother and child health clinics. BACKGROUND: Nutrition counselling of young families offers a tangible means to implement preventive measures for lifestyle-related chronic diseases. Nurses in health clinics are at prime position to execute this preventive work, which demands knowledge of current nutrition research as well as skill in counselling. Knowledge is limited regarding the current nutrition counselling practices of nurses and their needs in improving counselling. DESIGN: Descriptive questionnaire survey. METHODS: A questionnaire was formulated and sent to nurses in mother and child health clinics (n=650) nationwide via e-mail links using a computerised program. Non-respondents were re-contacted twice, the final response rate being 50% (n=327). RESULTS: Nurses considered nutrition counselling an important but challenging task in the clinics. In addition to promotion of health, they had counselled clients in the management of various disorders ranging from constipation to coeliac disease. Variability was noted in the extent to which nurses had adopted nutrition guidelines. As means to improve counselling, better collaboration with both families and healthcare professionals and an increase in resources, including time available for counselling, up-to-date educational material and clinical guidelines, as well as increased education in nutrition were suggested. CONCLUSIONS: The results demonstrated a need and a readiness amongst nurses to develop nutrition counselling in health clinics. Given the health benefits presumably deriving from nutrition counselling, investments in operational counselling, comprising advancement of both knowledge and skills in the health clinics, are clearly warranted. RELEVANCE TO CLINICAL PRACTICES: The findings provide important insights into the current clinical practice in health clinics and can be exploited in designing nutrition counselling and in-service training.},

Twenty laboratories investigated 12 blind-coded samples, spiked and naturally contaminated, to show the possibility of determining traces of gliadin in heat-treated or nonheat-treated foods by ELISA. It was shown that very small amounts of gliadin (below 100 ppm) could be detected by ELISA with a reproducibility RSD(R) (37%) and a repeatability RSD, (27%) common for ELISA under these conditions. The recovery of gliadin from the spiked samples was between 84 and 109%, based on the results of all laboratories, including those with poor performance. No false positives were found by the method (P < or =0.05), but one negative sample was contaminated during the bakery process. It is recommended that the method be accepted by AOAC as Official First Action.},

   abstract = {Celiac Disease (CD) is an immune-mediated disease dependent on gluten (a protein present in wheat, rye or barley) that occurs in about 1% of the population and is generally characterized by gastrointestinal complaints. More recently the understanding and knowledge of gluten sensitivity (GS), has emerged as an illness distinct from celiac disease with an estimated prevalence 6 times that of CD. Gluten sensitive people do not have villous atrophy or antibodies that are present in celiac disease, but rather they can test positive for antibodies to gliadin. Both CD and GS may present with a variety of neurologic and psychiatric co-morbidities, however, extraintestinal symptoms may be the prime presentation in those with GS. However, gluten sensitivity remains undertreated and underrecognized as a contributing factor to psychiatric and neurologic manifestations. This review focuses on neurologic and psychiatric manifestations implicated with gluten sensitivity, reviews the emergence of gluten sensitivity distinct from celiac disease, and summarizes the potential mechanisms related to this immune reaction.},

Using the Brachypodium genome sequence, a workflow has been developed to identify potentially harmful proteins which may cause either celiac disease or wheat allergy-related symptoms. Seed tissue-specific expression of the potential allergens has been determined, and intact epitopes following an in silico digestion with several endopeptidases have been identified. Molecular function of allergen proteins has been evaluated using Gene Ontology terms. Biologically overrepresented proteins and potentially allergen protein families have been identified.},

   abstract = {BACKGROUND: Constipation is a frequent cause of seeking paediatric advice and concerns up to 15% of the child population. AIM OF THE STUDY: Estimation of the role of allergy in the etiology of constipation in children during the fi rst three years of life. MATERIAL AND METHODS: Retrospective analysis was performed in 9489 children treated in 2nd Department of Pediatrics and Allergology of the Polish Mother's Memorial Hospital in Lodz in the years 1998- 2008. Among them there was a group of children with constipation diagnosed according to the Rome III Criteria. Anamnesis, course of disease and physical examination performed of each child guided further differential diagnosis Confirmation of food allergy diagnosis was positive result of provocation-elimination challenge with harmful food, and in case of some children additionally increased serum concentrations of allergenspecific IgE antibodies. In children with food allergy elimination diet was implemented. RESULTS: Chronic constipation was diagnosed in 136 children (1.43%). The most frequent cause of constipation in the examined children was allergy to cow's milk proteins, (n=99; 72.8%). The others were: psychogenic factors (n=10; 7.3%), dysbacteriosis of digestive system (n=7; 5.1%), anatomical defects of digestive tract (n=6; 4.4%), disorders of nervous system (n=6; 4.4%), overdose of Vit. D3 (n=3; 2.2%), Down Syndrome (n=2; 1.4%), celiac disease (n=1; 0.7%), abdominal tumour (neuroblastoma) (n=1; 0.7%) and cystic fibrosis (n=1; 0.7%). Clinical improvement after introduction of the elimination diet was observed in all children with food allergy. CONCLUSIONS: 1. In the fi rst three years of life cow milk allergy was the most frequent cause of constipation; 2. Incidence of food allergy as the reason of constipation decreased with age of the examined children.},

   abstract = {PURPOSE: To report off-label use of approved off-the-shelf endografts with no modification to the devices for the management of thoracoabdominal aneurysms (TAAA). TECHNIQUE: The parallel endograft octopus technique is demonstrated in a 68-year-old woman with a past history of open TAAA repair with a patch reimplant of the visceral vessels who now presented with back pain. Non-contrast computed tomography revealed a 6.8-cm aneurysm of the visceral segment involving the celiac trunk, superior mesenteric artery (SMA), and right renal artery. As she was at high risk for redo surgery due to significant pulmonary dysfunction, she was an ideal candidate for a branched graft, but she could not travel to an investigational site for a custom graft. At surgery, 4 sheaths were introduced, 2 retrograde (18-F DrySeal) and 2 (8-F) antegrade, via the femoral arteries. The 18-F sheaths on both sides were connected to the 8-F sheaths for continued limb perfusion. Via an axillary conduit, a 12-F, 80-cm sheath was introduced into the proximal thoracic aorta over a stiff wire. Subsequently, two 28-mm Excluder endografts were introduced via the bilateral 18-F femoral sheaths and positioned side by side in the descending thoracic aorta such that the lower end of the Excluder limbs were positioned >/=2 cm above the target visceral vessels. Viabahn stent-grafts were then deployed in the celiac axis, SMA, and right renal artery from the axillary conduit. Subsequently, a 23-mm Excluder was deployed within the distal end of the upsized limb and extended to both common iliac arteries. Imaging at 6 months demonstrated no endoleaks, with good flow to all visceral vessels. CONCLUSION: The parallel endograft octopus technique described here, which has been applied successfully in 9 cases thus far, is a relatively simple method using currently available devices with no requirement for device modification or customization. Although this technique shows promise, long-term data will be required to prove efficacy. This technique demonstrates a concept for future development of branched graft technology.},

   abstract = {The gustatory and visceral stimulation from food regulates digestion and nutrient utilization, and free glutamate (Glu) release from food is responsible for the umami taste perception that increases food palatability. The results of recent studies reveal a variety of physiological roles for Glu. For example, luminal applications of Glu into the mouth, stomach, and intestine increase the afferent nerve activities of the glossopharyngeal nerve, the gastric branch of the vagus nerve, and the celiac branch of the vagus nerve, respectively. Additionally, luminal Glu evokes efferent nerve activation of each branch of the abdominal vagus nerve. The intragastric administration of Glu activates several brain areas (e.g., insular cortex, limbic system, and hypothalamus) and has been shown to induce flavor-preference learning in rats. Functional magnetic resonance imaging of rats has shown that the intragastric administration of Glu activates the nucleus tractus solitarius, amygdala, and lateral hypothalamus. In addition, Glu may increase flavor preference as a result of its postingestive effect. Considering these results, we propose that dietary Glu functions as a signal for the regulation of the gastrointestinal tract via the gut-brain axis and contributes to the maintenance of a healthy life.},

This study has confirmed that the commercial oat supply in Canada is heavily contaminated with gluten from other grains. Approximately 88% of the oat samples (n = 133) were contaminated above 20 mg kg(-1) and there were no differences between the oat types tested. Only one gluten-free variety of oats was analysed and it consistently provided negative results in all analyses. It is difficult to determine where the contamination originates, but there are possibilities for cross-contamination in the field, in the transport of the grain, in the storage of the grain, and in the milling and packaging facilities. It is clear from this study that only those products that have been certified 'pure' oats would be appropriate for a gluten-free diet.},

We also presumed that interleukin (IL)-15 and FasL, functionally connected with proliferation and apoptosis of the intraepithelial lymphocytes (IELs), would relate with the increased numbers of IELs present in both CMSE and CD. METHODS: Twenty-three children with CMSE, 20 with untreated CD, and 14 controls were studied for CD3, alpha/beta- and gamma/delta-expressing IELs, and for duodenal and ileal expression of CD23, FasL, and IL-15 by immunohistochemistry, and for serum concentration of sCD23, sFasL, and sIL-15 by enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay. RESULTS: There was a trend for increase in sCD23 serum levels in untreated CMSE and in CD (P = 0.074; P = 0.077). CD23 was expressed in the mucosal germinal centres, but sCD23 was not related to presence of LNH. In CMSE, there was a trend for increase in serum sFasL (P = 0.07) and high levels associated with LNH (P = 0.025) and correlated with the IEL numbers (P < 0.05). Mucosal high endothelial venules adjacent to lymphoid follicles showed an intensive FasL expression. CONCLUSIONS: Serum sCD23 shows a trend of increment in CMSE and CD, and in the latter, sCD23 level may provide information about the severity of villous atrophy. In CMSE, high serum sFasL indicates both LNH and an increase of IELs, suggesting importance of FasL-mediated mechanisms in the pathogenesis of these features characteristic of CMSE. Further studies are necessary to evaluate whether intensive FasL expression in mucosal high endothelial venules presents a regulatory element in mucosal immunity.},

   abstract = {Stress, which is defined as an acute threat to homeostasis, shows both short- and long-term effects on the functions of the gastrointestinal tract. Exposure to stress results in alterations of the brain-gut interactions ("brain-gut axis") ultimately leading to the development of a broad array of gastrointestinal disorders including inflammatory bowel disease (IBD), irritable bowel syndrome (IBS) and other functional gastrointestinal diseases, food antigen-related adverse responses, peptic ulcer and gastroesophageal reflux disease (GERD). The major effects of stress on gut physiology include: 1) alterations in gastrointestinal motility; 2) increase in visceral perception; 3) changes in gastrointestinal secretion; 4) increase in intestinal permeability; 5) negative effects on regenerative capacity of gastrointestinal mucosa and mucosal blood flow; and 6) negative effects on intestinal microbiota. Mast cells (MC) are important effectors of brain-gut axis that translate the stress signals into the release of a wide range of neurotransmitters and proinflammatory cytokines, which may profoundly affect the gastrointestinal physiology. IBS represents the most important gastrointestinal disorder in humans, and is characterized by chronic or recurrent pain associated with altered bowel motility. The diagnostic testing for IBS patients include routine blood tests, stool tests, celiac disease serology, abdominal sonography, breath testing to rule out carbohydrate (lactose, fructose, etc.) intolerance and small intestinal bacterial overgrowth. Colonoscopy is recommended if alarming symptoms are present or to obtain colonic biopsies especially in patients with diarrhoea predominant IBS. The management of IBS is based on a multifactorial approach and includes pharmacotherapy targeted against the predominant symptom, behavioural and psychological treatment, dietary alterations, education, reassurance and effective patient-physician relationship. When evaluating for the stress-induced condition in the upper GI tract, the diagnostic testing includes mainly blood tests and gastroscopy to rule out GERD and peptic ulcer disease. The therapy for these conditions is mainly based on the inhibition of gastric acid by proton pump inhibitors and eradication of Helicobacter pylori-infection. Additionally, melatonin an important mediator of brain gut axis has been shown to exhibit important protective effects against stress-induced lesions in the gastrointestinal tract. Finally, probiotics may profoundly affect the brain-gut interactions ("microbiome-gut-brain axis") and attenuate the development of stress-induced disorders in both the upper and lower gastrointestinal tract. Further studies on the brain-gut axis are needed to open new therapeutic avenues in the future.},

   abstract = {UNLABELLED: Recent research data concerning the risk of coeliac disease confirm that introduction of food containing gluten during breast-feeding not later than 6 months of life is justified. According to ESPGHAN and EFSA introduction of solid foods in the diet of infants between 4-6 months of age is safe. AIM OF STUDY: Evaluation of feeding practices in healthy full-term infants after implementation of the recommendations of coeliac disease prevention. MATERIAL AND METHODS: Conducted analysis concerned 54 healthy full-term infants, living in Warsaw, aged 6 to 12 months. Of these, 27 children were exclusively breastfed for the first 6 months of life and 27 children were non-breastfed. The differences between selected parameters of nutritional status and diets of breastfed and nonbreastfed infants were evaluated by using t-Student test. Relations between quantitative variables were assessed by chi2 test. RESULTS: Products containing gluten were introduced into the breastfed children's diet in the 5th month of life in 22% of studied subgroup, in the 6th month - in 15%, in the 7th or 8th month - in 30%, between 9th and 11th month - in 22% and 11% of these children have not received food containing gluten in the first year of life. In the group of non-breastfed infants 15% received products with gluten before 5th month of life, 15% in 5th month, 11% at age of 6 months, 22% between 7th and 8th month, 15% in 11th month and 22% of children have not received food containing gluten in the first 12 months of life. An average daily intake of foods with varying content of gluten amounted to 55 g in breastfed infants and 70.5 g in non-breastfed infants (p <0.05). CONCLUSIONS: In the pilot study it was found out that nutritional recommendations concerning prophylaxis of coeliac disease were not implemented correctly by the majority of mothers of studied infants. Products containing gluten were introduced to the infant's diet too early or too late and mostly in larger quantities than it was recommended. Due to the small number of studied children it is important to carry out the investigation on a larger sample. At the same time it is necessary to introduce more effective methods of implementing nutritional recommendations concerning prophylaxis of celiac disease.},

MATERIAL AND METHODS: A total of 215 CD patients entered the study (191 females and 24 males) aged under 20 years (n=100), 20 to 50 (n=74) and over 50 years (n=41). The control group consisted of 25 healthy volunteers. Acid-forming function of the stomach, blood serum gastrin level were studied. Bile for biochemical test was obtained at duodenal intubation using 40 ml of 40% glucose solution or 25% magnesium solution as food stimulators, and intravenous injection of cholecystokininpancreosimin. Cholic acid was assayed in bile portions B and C. Two-channel probe was used to obtain duodenal content before meal and after intravenous injection of pancreosimin for tripsin, amylase and lipase assay. Clinical and biochemical blood tests were made as well as puncture biopsy of the liver with histological study of biopsy material. RESULTS: CD patients were found to have high basal and stimulated acid-forming function, high gastrin concentration in the blood. The morphological examination detected lymphocytic gastritis. There were an inert type of pancreatic enzyme secretion, gall-bladder hypokinesia or atony. Gall-bladder contracted only after intravenous injection of cholecystokinin. Changes in the liver were characterized by hypertransaminasemia, steatohepatitis. CONCLUSION: Changes in the stomach in patients with new-onset CD promote formation of ulcer. Decline in excretory pancreatic function, slow enzyme secretion, marked hypokinesia of the gall-bladder, hyperenzymemia and steatohepatitis as manifestations of hepatic pathology result in dramatic disorder of digestion and absorption of food substances.},

   abstract = {The prevalence of chronic autoimmune and inflammatory diseases, such as inflammatory bowel disease, allergies, or rheumatic diseases, is steadily increasing in developed countries. This increase is probably accelerated by environmental factors, such as decrease in infectious burden or changes in food processing. These lifestyle changes then strongly influence the strongest stimulus for the immune system - commensal microbiota. Despite the differences in the affected organ, the immune-mediated diseases have one or more factors in common - microbe either as a trigger or as a protector, mucosal barrier dysfunction, and dysregulation of the immune system. The core questions, which microbes are involved and how these diseases can be cured or even prevented still remain unsolved. Powered by the recent progress in technology, by new insights into the function of immune system, by advances in microbiome research, and extended use of gnotobiological techniques, these mechanisms are now being unravelled and new therapeutic possibilities are emerging. To secure their niche, the microbes devised many ingenious ways, how to dampen the inflammation. Nonpathogenic microorganisms or microbial components isolated from probiotic, commensal or even pathogenic microbes could be, therefore, used to interfere with the pathogenetic mechanisms of immune-mediated diseases.},

   abstract = {Nutritional factors, as sources of luminal antigens, have been thought to be important factors in the immunopathogenesis of numerous gastrointestinal diseases. In some diseases, the role of the nutritional component is causal in the susceptible host. Such diseases include celiac disease, a common heritable chronic inflammatory condition of the small intestine induced by dietary wheat, rye and barley, in susceptible individuals. Specific HLA-DQ2 and HLA-DQ8 risk alleles are necessary, but not sufficient, for disease development. The well-defined role of HLA-DQ heterodimers encoded by these alleles is to present cereal peptides to CD4+ T cells, activating an inflammatory immune response in the intestine. Genome-wide association studies have been performed which identified the IL2-IL21 risk locus and other genes with immune functions and key roles in thymic T-cell selection. Another example for this group is Wilson's disease, an autosomal recessive disorder of copper metabolism caused by mutation of the ATP7B gene, resulting in a defect of biliary copper excretion and toxic accumulation in the body, especially in the liver, brain and cornea, resulting in hepatic and/or neurological symptoms. In other diseases, however, the association is less well established. In such endeavor, epidemiological observations may become a valuable part of the overall investigations aimed at identifying dietary factors, which are involved in the initiation and perpetuation of the specific disease. As an example, relationships between nutrition and colorectal cancer have been hypothesized early on (e.g. folate, calcium, vitamin D, red meat). Similarly, intake of certain diet constituents like fat, refined sugar, fruits, vegetables and fiber was reported to be associated with the expression of inflammatory bowel diseases. In addition, in children with active Crohn's disease, enteral nutrition was found to be equally effective as corticosteroids in induction of remission, with mucosal healing induced by downregulation of mucosal pro-inflammatory cytokine profiles in both the ileum and the colon after enteral nutrition. However, the particular effect of the consumption of each type of food remains questionable in most cases, at least in part because of insufficient data and serious methodological limitations (e.g. recall bias, heterogeneity between collected data, lack of correction for covariates, difficulties in double blinding).},

   abstract = {Various mechanisms detect the presence of dietary triacylglycerols (TAG) in the digestive tract and link TAG ingestion to the regulation of energy homeostasis. We here propose a novel sensing mechanism with the potential to encode dietary TAG-derived energy by translating enterocyte fatty acid oxidation (FAO) into vagal afferent signals controlling eating. Peripheral FAO has long been implicated in the control of eating (141). The prevailing view was that mercaptoacetate (MA) and other FAO inhibitors stimulate eating by modulating vagal afferent signaling from the liver. This concept has been challenged because hepatic parenchymal vagal afferent innervation is scarce and because experimentally induced changes in hepatic FAO often fail to affect eating. Nevertheless, intraperitoneally administered MA acts in the abdomen to stimulate eating because this effect was blocked by subdiaphragmatic vagal deafferentation (21), a surgical technique that eliminates all vagal afferents from the upper gut. These and other data support a role of the small intestine rather than the liver as a FAO sensor that can influence eating. After intrajejunal infusions, MA also stimulated eating in rats through vagal afferent signaling, and after infusion into the superior mesenteric artery, MA increased the activity of celiac vagal afferent fibers originating in the proximal small intestine. Also, pharmacological interference with TAG synthesis targeting the small intestine induced a metabolic profile indicative of increased FAO and inhibited eating in rats on a high-fat diet but not on chow. Finally, cell culture studies indicate that enterocytes oxidize fatty acids, which can be modified pharmacologically. Thus enterocytes may sense dietary TAG-derived fatty acids via FAO and influence eating through changes in intestinal vagal afferent activity. Further studies are necessary to identify the link between enterocyte FAO and vagal afferents and to examine the specificity and potential physiological relevance of such a mechanism.},

   abstract = {Coeliac disease (CD) is an autoimmune disorder triggered by gluten proteins (gliadin) that involves innate and adaptive immunity. In this study, we hypothesise that the administration of Bifidobacterium longum CECT 7347, previously selected for reducing gliadin immunotoxic effects in vitro, could exert protective effects in an animal model of gliadin-induced enteropathy. The effects of this bacterium were evaluated in newborn rats fed gliadin alone or sensitised with interferon (IFN)-gamma and fed gliadin. Jejunal tissue sections were collected for histological, NFkappaB mRNA expression and cytokine production analyses. Leukocyte populations and T-cell subsets were analysed in peripheral blood samples. The possible translocation of the bacterium to different organs was determined by plate counting and the composition of the colonic microbiota was quantified by real-time PCR. Feeding gliadin alone reduced enterocyte height and peripheral CD4+ cells, but increased CD4+/Foxp3+ T and CD8+ cells, while the simultaneous administration of B. longum CECT 7347 exerted opposite effects. Animals sensitised with IFN-gamma and fed gliadin showed high cellular infiltration, reduced villi width and enterocyte height. Sensitised animals also exhibited increased NFkappaB mRNA expression and TNF-alpha production in tissue sections. B. longum CECT 7347 administration increased NFkappaB expression and IL-10, but reduced TNF-alpha, production in the enteropathy model. In sensitised gliadin-fed animals, CD4+, CD4+/Foxp3+ and CD8+ T cells increased, whereas the administration of B. longum CECT 7347 reduced CD4+ and CD4+/Foxp3+ cell populations and increased CD8+ T cell populations. The bifidobacterial strain administered represented between 75-95% of the total bifidobacteria isolated from all treated groups, and translocation to organs was not detected. These findings indicate that B. longum attenuates the production of inflammatory cytokines and the CD4+ T-cell mediated immune response in an animal model of gliadin-induced enteropathy.},

   abstract = {Gliadin is a constituent of the cereal protein gluten, responsible for the intolerance generated in celiac disease. Its detection is of high interest for food safety of celiac patients, since the only treatment known until now is a lifelong avoidance of this protein in the diet. Therefore, it is essential to have an easy and reliable method of analysis to control the contents in gluten-free foods. An electrochemical magneto immunosensor for the quantification of gliadin or small gliadin fragments in natural or pretreated food samples is described for the first time and compared to a novel magneto-ELISA system based on optical detection. The immunological reaction was performed on magnetic beads as solid support by the oriented covalent immobilization, of the protein gliadin on tosyl-activated beads. Direct, as well as indirect competitive immunoassays were optimized, achieving the best analytical performance with the direct competitive format. Excellent detection limits (in the order of mug L(-1)) were achieved, according to the legislation for gluten-free products. The matrix effect, as well as the performance of the assays was successfully evaluated using spiked gluten-free foodstuffs (skimmed milk and beer), obtaining excellent recovery values in the results.},

   abstract = {UNLABELLED: Antioxidant activity (AA) of quinoa (Chenopodium quinoa Willd.) seeds, as well as of durum wheat (Triticum turgidum L. ssp. durum Desf.) and of emmer (T. turgidum L. ssp. dicoccum Schubler) grains, was evaluated by studying hydrophilic (H), lipophilic (L), free-soluble (FSP) and insoluble-bound (IBP) phenolic extracts using the new lipoxygenase/4-nitroso-N,N-dimethylaniline (LOX/RNO) method, able to simultaneously detect different antioxidant mechanisms, as well as using the Oxygen Radical Absorbance Capacity (ORAC) and the Trolox Equivalent Antioxidant Capacity (TEAC) assays, which measure the scavenging activity against peroxyl and ABTS [2,2'-azino-bis-(3-ethylbenzothiazoline-6-sulfonate)] radicals, respectively. The species under study were compared with respect to the sum of AA values of H, L and FSP extracts (AA(H+L+FSP)), containing freely solvent-soluble antioxidants, and AA values of IBP extracts (AA(IBP)), representing the phenolic fraction ester-linked to insoluble cell wall polymers. The LOX/RNO and ORAC methods measured in quinoa flour a remarkable AA(H+L+FSP) higher than durum wheat, although lower than emmer; according to the same assays, the IBP component of quinoa resulted less active than the durum wheat and emmer ones. The TEAC protocol also revealed a high AA(H+L+FSP) for quinoa. Interestingly, the ratio AA(H+L+FSP)/AA(H+L+FSP+IBP), as evaluated by the LOX/RNO and ORAC assays, resulted in quinoa higher than that of both durum wheat and emmer, and much higher than durum wheat, according to the TEAC protocol. This may suggest that antioxidants from quinoa seeds may be more readily accessible with respect to that of both the examined wheat species. PRACTICAL APPLICATIONS: Quinoa seeds may represent an excellent source of natural antioxidant compounds and, in particular, of the free-soluble antioxidant fraction. These compounds may improve nutritive and health-beneficial properties of quinoa-based gluten-free products, thus expanding interest for quinoa utilization from celiac patients to the general population.},

   abstract = {INTRODUCTION: Ingestion of dietary gluten in wheat, rye and barley by celiac patients leads to small-bowel mucosal villous atrophy, crypt hyperplasia and massive inflammation, often coupled with clinical symptoms and signs. Currently, the only effective treatment is a strict life-long gluten-free diet excluding all gluten-containing food products. In view of the extremely restricted nature of the diet, new treatment options would clearly be desirable. AREAS COVERED: The improved understanding of celiac disease pathogenesis has enabled researchers to suggest alternative strategies to treat the disorder. This review covers current approaches toward developing an appropriate drug and discusses the possible problems associated with these approaches. EXPERT OPINION: Phase II clinical trials are already ongoing to test the efficacy of novel alternative treatments for celiac disease. Before any of the candidates can enter Phase III trials, however, researchers must develop novel reliable non-invasive surrogate markers for intestinal injury and disease activity which also accurately reflect patient-related outcomes. Any novel medication for celiac disease should be as effective and safe as the gluten-free diet, and this constitutes a challenge for drug development. It is thus likely that the first medication entering the market will be supplementary to rather than substitute the gluten-free diet.},

   abstract = {In genetically predisposed individuals, dietary gluten in wheat, rye and barley triggers celiac disease, a systemic autoimmune disorder hallmarked by an extensive small-bowel mucosal immune response. The current conception of celiac disease pathogenesis is that it involves components of both innate and adaptive immunity whose activation typically leads to small-bowel villous atrophy with crypt hyperplasia. Currently, the only effective treatment for celiac disease is a strict lifelong gluten-free diet excluding all wheat-, rye- and barley-containing food products. During the diet, the clinical symptoms improve and the small-bowel mucosal damage recovers, while re-introduction of gluten into the diet leads to re-appearance of the symptoms and deterioration of the small-bowel mucosal architecture. In view of the restricted nature of the diet, alternative treatment is warranted. Improved understanding of the molecular basis of celiac disease has enabled researchers to suggest other therapeutic approaches. Although there is no animal model reproducing all features of celiac disease, the use of in vitro approaches including a variety of cell lines and the celiac patient small-bowel mucosal biopsy organ culture has generated knowledge about pathogenesis of celiac disease. In these culture systems, gluten induces different effects that can be quantified, thus also enabling studies concerning the efficacy of candidate therapeutic compounds for celiac disease. This review describes the intestinal epithelial cell models, celiac patient T-cell lines and clones, as well as the small-bowel mucosal organ culture methods widely used in studies of celiac disease, and summarizes the major findings obtained with these systems.},

The objective of this study was to compare the frequency and association rs2305764, rs2305767 and rs1457092 MYO09B polymorphisms in pediatric CD patients from and. PATIENTS AND METHODS: the study was made in 104 CD pediatric patients (Chilean and Argentineans) and 104 controls subjects. MYO9B gene polymorphisms were analyzed by Taqman allelic probes. We evaluated the Hardy-Weinberg equilibrium by means of Chi-square and compared the haplotypes distribution using Fisher test. RESULTS: SNPs rs2305767 and rs1457092 were associated with celiac disease (CD); TT genotype in rs2305767 would be a protective factor (p < 0.000, OR = 0.19 CI 0.1-0.4) and the CT genotype would be a risk factor (p < 0.0001, OR = 4.9 CI 2.2 to 11.3). CC genotype in rs1457092 also showed a protective effect for celiac (p < 0.000, OR = 0.07 CI 0.0 to 0.3). CONCLUSION: our findings suggest that genetic variation MYO9B gene is associated with CD, as a protective or a risk factor depending on the polymorphism studied.},

   abstract = {CD is an immune-mediated enteropathy caused by the ingestion of wheat gluten. The modification of gluten by intestinal tTGase plays a crucial role in CD pathogenesis. In this study, we observed that extensive transamidation of wheat flour with K-C2H5 by mTGase yielded spf and K-gliadins fractions. By Western blot, we found that these modifications were associated with strongly reduced immune cross-reactivity. With the use of DQ8 tg mice as a model of gluten sensitivity, we observed a dramatic reduction in IFNgamma production in gliadin-specific spleen cells challenged with spf and K-gliadins in vitro (n=12; median values: 813 vs. 29 and 99; control vs. spf and K-gliadins, P=0.012 for spf, and P=0.003 for K-gliadins). For spf, we also observed an increase in the IL-10/IFNgamma protein ratio (n=12; median values: 0.3 vs. 4.7; control vs. spf, P=0.005). In intestinal biopsies from CD patients challenged in vitro with gliadins (n=10), we demonstrated further that K-gliadins dramatically reduced the levels of antigen-specific IFNgamma mRNA in all specimens responsive to native gliadins (four of 10; P<0.05). As cytotoxic effects have been described for gliadins, we also studied GST and caspase-3 activities using the enterocytic Caco-2 cell line. We found that neither activities were modified by flour transamidation. Our results indicate that K-C2H5 cross-linking via mTGase specifically affects gliadin immunogenicity, reversing the inducible inflammatory response in models of gluten sensitivity without affecting other aspects of the biological activity of gliadins.},

Many complementary foods contain gluten, but gluten exposure is associated with the risk of developing celiac disease (CD). CD is a disease with considerable morbidity and mortality. Although CD is associated with certain genetic features, carrying the human leukocyte antigen haplotypes DQ2 or DQ8 (a prerequisite for CD development) cannot fully explain who will or who will not develop CD. Potential risk factors for CD include perinatal events and infant feeding practice. With the exception that children who are breastfed at and beyond gluten introduction into the diet probably may be at a lower risk of developing CD, and that heavy gluten load early in life may increase the risk of future CD, data on the impact of infant feeding are inconsistent.},

The study objective was to determine the interrelationships between vitamin K/D status and lifestyle variables on BMD in children and adolescents with CD at diagnosis and after 1 year on the gluten-free diet (GFD). SUBJECTS/METHODS: Children and adolescents aged 3-17 years with biopsy proven CD at diagnosis and after 1 year on the GFD were studied. BMD was measured using dual-energy X-ray absorptiometry. Relevant variables included: anthropometrics, vitamin D/K status, diet, physical activity and sunlight exposure. RESULTS: Whole-body and lumbar-spine BMD-z scores were low (< or = -1) at diagnosis (10-20%) and after 1 year (30-32%) in the children, independent of symptoms. Whole-body BMD-z scores (-0.55+/-0.7 versus 0.72+/-1.5) and serum levels of 25(OH) vitamin D (90.3+/-24.8 versus 70.5+/-19.8 nmol/l) were significantly lower in older children (>10 years) when compared with younger children (< or =10 years) (P<0.001). Forty-three percent had suboptimal vitamin D status (25(OH)-vitamin D <75 nmol/l) at diagnosis; resolving in nearly half after 1 year on the GFD. Twenty-five percent had suboptimal vitamin K status at diagnosis; all resolved after 1 year. CONCLUSIONS: Children and adolescents with CD are at risk for suboptimal bone health at time of diagnosis and after 1 year on GFD; likely due in part to suboptimal vitamin D/K status. Therapeutic strategies aimed at optimizing vitamin K/D intake may contribute to improved BMD in children with CD.},

   abstract = {OBJECTIVE: Most of the recent studies suggest that oats are well tolerated by celiac disease (CD) patients. However, it is still possible that different oat cultivars may display different biological properties relevant for CD pathogenesis. We aimed to investigate biological and immunological properties of two oat varieties, Avena genziana and Avena potenza, in relation to their safety for CD patients. MATERIAL AND METHODS: Phosphorylation of extracellular signal-regulated kinase (ERK) and trans-epithelial electrical resistance (TEER) were evaluated in CaCo-2 cells treated with peptic-tryptic (PT) digests from the two oats and from gliadin (PTG). With the same PT-digests, duodenal biopsies from 22 CD patients were treated in vitro for 24 h and density of CD25+ cells in lamina propria and of intraepithelial CD3+ T cells was measured, as well as crypt cell proliferation and epithelial expression of interleukin 15. Finally, interferon gamma (IFN-gamma) production was measured as evidence of gliadin-specific T-cell activation by PT-digests. RESULTS: In contrast to PTG, oats PT-digests were not able to induce significant increase in ERK phosphorylation and decrease in TEER in CaCo-2 cells. In the organ culture system, oats PT-digests, unlike PTG, did not induce significant increase in crypt enterocyte proliferation, increase in interleukin 15 expression or in lamina propria CD25+ cells. Nevertheless Avena potenza increased intraepithelial T-cell density, while Avena genziana-induced IFN-gamma production in 3/8 CD intestinal T cell lines. CONCLUSIONS: Our data show that Avena genziana and Avena potenza do not display in vitro activities related to CD pathogenesis. Some T-cell reactivity could be below the threshold for clinical relevance.},

AIM: To assess the diagnostic value of intestinal deposits of anti-TG2 IgA for celiac disease in a paediatric population. METHODS: 344 children underwent duodenal biopsy for the suspicion of CD, and were divided into 3 groups: group A, 144 celiac subjects with villous atrophy (Marsh 3b-c); group B, 109 subjects with high serum levels of anti-TG2 but normal intestinal mucosa (Marsh 0-1) (potential celiac disease patients); group C, 91 subjects with normal levels of serum anti-TG2: 70 with Marsh 0-1 and 21 with Marsh 3a mucosa. All duodenal sections were evaluated for the presence of intestinal deposits of anti-TG2 IgA by double immunofluorescence. RESULTS: Deposits of anti-TG2 IgA were present in 96%, 68%, 12% of patients from groups A, B, C, respectively. Diagnostic sensitivity and specificity for celiac disease were 96% and 88% vs. 97% and 100% for serum anti-TG2, respectively. The degree of concordance with serum anti-TG2 was 85%. CONCLUSION: Detection of intestinal deposits of anti-TG2 IgA is a useful diagnostic tool. Further research is needed regarding their ability to predict evolution to villous atrophy in potential celiac disease.},

   abstract = {Owing to its extensive use in the human diet, wheat is among the most common causes of food-related allergies and intolerances. Allergies to wheat are provoked by ingestion, inhalation or contact with either the soluble or the insoluble gluten proteins in wheat. Gluten proteins, and particularly the gliadin fraction, are also the main factor triggering celiac disease, a common enteropathy induced by ingestion of wheat gluten proteins and related prolamins from oat, rye and barley in genetically susceptible individuals. The role of gliadin and of its derived peptides in eliciting the adverse reactions in celiac disease are still far from being completely explained. Owing to its unique pathogenesis, celiac disease is widely investigated as a model immunogenetic disorder. The structural characterization of the injuring agents, the gluten proteins, assumes a particular significance in order to deepen the understanding of the events that trigger this and similar diseases at the molecular level. Recent developments in proteomics have provided an important contribution to the understanding of several basic aspects of wheat protein-related diseases. These include: the identification of gluten fractions and derived peptides involved in wheat allergy and intolerance, including celiac disease, and the elucidation of their mechanism of toxicity; the development and validation of sensitive and specific methods for detecting trace amounts of gluten proteins in gluten-free foods for intolerant patients; and the formulation of completely new substitute foods and ingredients to replace the gluten-based ones. In this article, the main aspects of current and prospective applications of mass spectrometry and proteomic technologies to the structural characterization of gluten proteins and derived peptides are critically presented, with a focus on issues related to their detection, identification and quantification, which are relevant to the biochemical, immunological and toxicological aspects of wheat intolerance.},

   abstract = {The initial development and maintenance of tolerance to dietary antigens is a complex process that, when prevented or interrupted, can lead to human disease. Understanding the mechanisms by which tolerance to specific dietary antigens is attained and maintained is crucial to our understanding of the pathogenesis of diseases related to intolerance of specific dietary antigens. Two diseases that are the result of intolerance to a dietary antigen are celiac disease (CD) and dermatitis herpetiformis (DH). Both of these diseases are dependent upon the ingestion of gluten (the protein fraction of wheat, rye, and barley) and manifest in the gastrointestinal tract and skin, respectively. These gluten-sensitive diseases are two examples of how devastating abnormal immune responses to a ubiquitous food can be. The well-recognized risk genotype for both is conferred by either of the HLA class II molecules DQ2 or DQ8. However, only a minority of individuals who carry these molecules will develop either disease. Also of interest is that the age at diagnosis can range from infancy to 70-80 years of age. This would indicate that intolerance to gluten may potentially be the result of two different phenomena. The first would be that, for various reasons, tolerance to gluten never developed in certain individuals, but that for other individuals, prior tolerance to gluten was lost at some point after childhood. Of recent interest is the concept of non-celiac gluten sensitivity, which manifests as chronic digestive or neurologic symptoms due to gluten, but through mechanisms that remain to be elucidated. This review will address how animal models of gluten-sensitive disorders have substantially contributed to a better understanding of how gluten intolerance can arise and cause disease.},

   abstract = {INTRODUCTION: According to the classification given by Crawford et al. type III thoracoabdominal aortic aneurysm (TAAA) is dilatation of the aorta from the level of the rib 6 to the separation of the aorta below the renal arteries, capturing all the visceral branch of aorta. Visceral hybrid reconstruction of TAAA is a procedure developed in recent years in the world, which involves a combination of conventional, open and endovascular aortic reconstruction surgery at the level of separation of the left subclavian artery to the level of visceral branches of aorta. CASE REPORT: We presented a 75-years-old man, with elective visceral hybrid reconstruc tion of type III TAAA. Computerized scanning (CT) angiography of the patient showed type III TAAA with the maximum transverse diameter of aneurysm of 92 mm. Aneurysm started at the level of the sixth rib, and the end of the aneurysm was 1 cm distal to the level of renal arteries. Aneurysm compressed the esophagus, causing the patient difficulty in swallowing act, especially solid food, and frequent back pain. From the other comorbidity, the patient had been treated for a long time, due to chronic obstructive pulmonary disease and hypertension. In general endotracheal anesthesia with epidural analgesia, the patient underwent visceral hybrid reconstruction of TAAA, which combines classic, open vascular surgery and endovascular procedures. Classic vascular surgery is visceral reconstruction using by-pass procedure from the distal, normal aorta to all visceral branches: celiac trunk, superior mesenteric artery and both renal arteries, with ligature of all arteries very close to the aorta. After that, by synchronous endovascular technique a complete aneurysmal exclusion of thoracoabdominal aneurysm with thoracic stent-graft was performed. The postoperative course was conducted properly and the patient left the Clinic for Vascular Surgery on postoperative day 21. Control CT, performed 3 months after the surgery showed that the patient's vascular status was uneventful with functional visceral by-pass and with good position of a stent-graft without a significant endoleak. CONCLUSION: Visceral hybrid reconstruction represents a complementary surgical technique to that with open reconstruction of TAAA. This approach is far less traumatic to a patient, and is especially important in patients with lot of comorbidities, because there is no need for thoracotomy, and ischemic-reperfusion injury of the body is reduced to a minimum.},

   abstract = {Transglutaminases (TGs, E.C. 2.3.2.13) are related and ubiquitous enzymes which catalyze the cross linking of a glutaminyl residue of a protein/peptide substrate to a lysyl residue of a protein/peptide co-substrate. These enzymes are also capable of catalyzing other reactions which are important for cell life. To date, at least eight different human TGs have been identified. The distribution and the physiological roles of human TGs have been widely studied in numerous cell types and tissues and recently their roles in several diseases have begun to be identified. It has been hypothesized that transglutaminase activity is directly involved in the patho-genetic mechanisms responsible for several human diseases. In particular, TG2, a member of the TG enzyme family, has been shown to be involved in the molecular mechanisms responsible for a very widespread human pathology, Celiac Disease (CD), one of the most common food intolerances described in the western population. The main food agent that provokes the strong and diffuse clinical symptoms has been known for several years to be gliadin, a protein present in a very large number of human foods derived from vegetables. The aim of this review is to summarize the most recent findings concerning the relationships between the biochemical properties of the transglutaminase activity and the basic molecular mechanisms responsible for CD. In addition, we present some clinical associations of CD with other human diseases, with particular reference to neuropsychiatric disorders. Possible molecular links between biochemical activities of transglutaminase enzymes, CD and neuropsychiatric disorders are discussed.},

   abstract = {Celiac disease (CD) is an immune-mediated enteropathy triggered by the ingestion of gluten-containing grains that affects ~1% of the white ethnic population. In the last decades, a rise in prevalence of CD has been observed that cannot be fully explained by improved diagnostics. Genetic predisposition greatly influences the susceptibility of individuals towards CD, though environmental factors also play a role. With no pharmacological treatments available, the only option to keep CD in remission is a strict and permanent exclusion of dietary gluten. Such a gluten-free diet is difficult to maintain because of gluten's omnipresence in food (e.g., additive in processed food). The development of adjuvant therapies which would permit the intake of small amounts of gluten would be desirable to improve the quality of life of patients on a gluten-free diet. Such therapies include gluten-degrading enzymes, polymeric binders, desensitizing vaccines, anti-inflammatory drugs, transglutaminase 2 inhibitors, and HLA-DQ2 blockers. However, many of these approaches pose pharmaceutical challenges with respect to drug formulation and stability, or application route and dosing interval. This perspective article discusses how pharmaceutical scientists may deal with these challenges and contribute to the implementation of novel therapeutic options for patients with CD.},

Geneticists, pathologists, immunologists, food engineers and dieticians share their knowledge and expertise to improve the conditions of CD patients. With new insights in the pathomechanism of gluten processing and antigen presentation in CD, it was possible to improve the diagnostic antigen mimicking the primary epitope in CD. These celiac neo-epitopes are comprised of a complex of gliadin peptides crosslinked with transglutaminase (tTg). They are an early diagnostic marker for CD which occurs up to 6 months earlier than classical markers known to miss a certain amount of CD patients.},

   abstract = {A lifelong gluten-free diet (GFD) is mandatory for celiac disease (CD) but has poor compliance, justifying novel strategies. We found that wheat flour transamidation inhibited IFN-gamma secretion by intestinal T cells from CD patients. Herein, the primary endpoint was to evaluate the ability of transamidated gluten to maintain GFD CD patients in clinical remission. Secondary endpoints were efficacy in prevention of the inflammatory response and safety at the kidney level, where reaction products are metabolized. In a randomized single blinded, controlled 90-day trial, 47 GFD CD patients received 3.7 g/day of gluten from nontransamidated (12) or transamidated (35) flour. On day 15, 75% and 37% of patients in the control and experimental groups, respectively, showed clinical relapse (P = 0.04) whereas intestinal permeability was mainly altered in the control group (50% versus 20%, P = 0.06). On day 90, 0 controls and 14 patients in the experimental group completed the challenge with no variation of antitransglutaminase IgA (P = 0.63), Marsh-Oberhuber grading (P = 0.08), or intestinal IFN-gamma mRNA (P > 0.05). Creatinine clearance did not vary after 90 days of treatment (P = 0.46). In conclusion, transamidated gluten reduced the number of clinical relapses in challenged patients with no changes of baseline values for serological/mucosal CD markers and an unaltered kidney function.},

   abstract = {The only treatment for coeliac disease is to follow a strict, life-long gluten-free diet. It is therefore essential to use a highly sensitive, specific technique for gluten analysis in foods. Nowadays, the usual method for determining gluten content in gluten-free foods, internationally accepted by the Codex Alimentarius Commission, is the R5 antibody-based sandwich ELISA, combined with the cocktail-extraction solution. This technique requires at least two epitopes in the protein, but in hydrolysed foods, proteins are fragmented during food processing and converted into peptides in which only one toxic epitope may appear. Consequently, it was necessary to develop a new competitive immunoassay that, together with a reliable, compatible extraction solution, would provide a complete gluten analysis in any kind of food. We analysed commercial foods and home-made maize breads spiked with a known amount of gliadins using the sandwich R5 ELISA and the new competitive R5 ELISA that has been developed. These foods had previously been extracted with 60% ethanol/water, the cocktail solution or the new extracting solution called UPEX (universal prolamin and glutelin extractant solution). The complementary SDS-PAGE and western blot techniques were also used to confirm the gluten content. The limits of detection and quantification of the competitive R5 ELISA were 0.36 and 1.22 ng/ml of gliadins, respectively. The intra- and inter-assay precisions based on two samples were, respectively, 7.3% and 5.4% for the first sample and 9.9% and 6.3% for the second. This new assay was a better technique than the sandwich R5 ELISA for detecting gliadins quantitatively in hydrolysed foods. Regarding the extraction procedure, we did not find any significant interference from components of the UPEX solution at the concentration used. In addition, the UPEX solution extraction was compatible with the R5 western blot and mass spectrometry techniques. The competitive R5 ELISA we developed, combined with the UPEX solution described here, is a very useful tool for detecting and quantifying gluten in any kind of food samples, including heat-treated and/or hydrolysed ones.},

The keystone of CD pathogenesis is an adaptive immune response orchestrated by the interplay between gluten and MHC class II HLA-DQ2 and DQ8 molecules. Yet, other factors that impair immunoregulatory mechanisms and/or activate the large population of intestinal intraepithelial lymphocytes (IEL) are indispensable for driving tissue damage. Herein, we summarize our current understanding of the mechanisms and consequences of the undesirable immune response initiated by gluten peptides. We show that CD is a model disease to decipher the role of MHC class II molecules in human immunopathology, to analyze the mechanisms that link tolerance to food proteins and autoimmunity, and to investigate how chronic activation of IEL can lead to T cell lymphomagenesis.},

This grain consumption has the potential to generate positive externalities, such as reduced rates of obesity, diabetes and other chronic diseases. Such positive externalities can potentially produce tangible economic benefits in terms of public health. In contrast, newer nutritional research shows that grain consumption may have negative effects on health for certain population groups. Celiac disease is four times as common as it was 50 years ago and is often under-diagnosed. Other population groups exhibit gluten sensitivity which can impact the development of asthma, allergies and neurological difficulties. This survey intends to provide a comprehensive description of both the positive and negative externalities associated with grain consumption and the resulting impact on human health.},

   abstract = {Transport of molecules across the intestinal epithelium takes place through 2 major routes, ie, trans-cellular and paracellular. Assessment of intestinal permeability is performed to assess the overall function of transport through the intestinal epithelial paracellular route. Urinary excretion of disaccharides and monosaccharides and ratio of their excretion is a basis for measurement of intestinal permeability. Lactulose and mannitol ratio is the most commonly used test for assessment of small intestinal permeability and the most reliable method for measurement of concentration of lactulose and mannitol in the urine is high performance liquid chromatography. After the measurement of concentration of probes in the urine; the results are expressed as the ratio of percentage excretion of the ingested dose of lactulose and mannitol in the urine. Testing of intestinal permeability is not required for routine patient care, however it is an important tool to understand the function of the paracellular transport in the research setting. Increase in intestinal permeability has been implicated in the pathogenesis of many autoimmune diseases including celiac disease, Crohn's disease, type I diabetes and food allergy.},

   abstract = {Unexpected, urgent, sometimes painful bowel movements after eating are common complaints among adults. Without a clear etiology, if pain is present and resolves with the movements, this is usually labeled "irritable bowel syndrome-diarrhea" based solely on symptoms. If this symptom-based approach is applied exclusively, it may lead physicians not to consider treatable conditions: celiac disease, or maldigestion due to bile acid malabsorption, pancreatic exocrine insufficiency, or an a-glucosidase (sucrase, glucoamylase, maltase, or isomaltase) deficiency. These conditions can be misdiagnosed as irritable bowel syndrome-diarrhea (or functional diarrhea, if pain is not present). Limited testing is currently available to confirm these conditions (antibody screens for celiac disease; fecal fat as a surrogate marker for pancreatic function). Therefore, empirical treatment with alpha amylase, pancreatic enzymes, or a bile acid-binding agent may simultaneously treat these patients and serve as a surrogate diagnostic test. This review will summarize the current evidence for bile acid malabsorption, and deficiencies of pancreatic enzymes or a-glucosidases as potential causes for postprandial diarrhea, and provide an algorithm for treatment options.},

Gluten-Tec is a competitive ELISA that detects an immunostimulatory epitope of a-gliadin in dietary food for celiacs. Fifteen laboratories, representing 14 different countries, announced their interest in taking part in this study. Of the 12 laboratories that sent the results within the established timeframe, two submitted inappropriate standard curves and were excluded from the statistical analysis. Four different food matrixes (rice-based baby food, maize bread, chocolate cake mix, and beer) were selected for preparing the test samples. Two gliadin extraction procedures were used: the conventional 60% ethanol, and a new method based on the reducing reagent dithiothreitol. The 38 samples (19 blind duplicates) tested in this study were prepared by diluting the different extracts in order to cover a wide range of gliadin levels. Both sample extraction and dilution were performed by EuroProxima; the present interlaboratory study was focused only on testing the ELISA part of the Gluten-Tec kit protocol. Repeatability values (within-laboratory variance), expressed as RSD(r) ranged from 6.2 to 25.7%, while reproducibility values (interlaboratory variance), expressed as RSD(R), ranged from 10.6 to 45.9%. Both statistical parameters were in the acceptable range of ELISAs under these conditions, and the method will be presented to the Codex Alimentarius as a preferred method for gluten analysis.},

   abstract = {INTRODUCTION: Abdominal angina, also known as chronic mesenteric ischemia or intestinal angina, is a rare disease caused by intestinal flow reduction due to stenosis or occlusion of mesenteric arteries. A case of successful treatment of a patient with abdominal angina by percutaneous transuliminal angioplasty of high-grade superior mesenteric artery and coeliac trunk stenosis was presented. CASE OUTLINE: A 77-year-old male patient was admitted at our Clinic for severe postprandial abdominal pains followed by frequent diarrhoeas. Extensive gastrointestinal investigations were performed and all results were normal. Multislice computerized (MSCT) arteriography was indicated which revealed ostial celiac trunk and superior mesenteric artery subocclusion. Percutaneous transluminal angioplasty of the superior mesenteric artery and coeliac trunk was done with two stents implantation. Just a few hours following the intervention, after food ingestion, there were no abdominal pains. Six months later, the patient described a significant feeling of relief after food ingestion and no arduousness at all. CONCLUSION: High-grade visceral arteries stenoses in patients with intestinal ischemia symptoms can be treated by either surgical procedures or percutaneus transluminal angioplasty. In cases when a low operative risk is anticipated, surgical treatment is recommended due to a better anatomical outcome, while percutaneus angioplasty is advised to elderly patients in whom increased operative risks can be expected.},

   abstract = {Celiac disease (CD) is a chronic intestinal disorder of public health concern caused by gluten ingestion in sensitive individuals. Gluten is a protein found not only in gluten-containing food but also as normal component of drugs and dietary supplements. Detection of gluten in dietary supplements is a very important task required for establishing their gluten status, which is highly important for the safety of products consumed by CD and gluten-sensitive patients. In this paper, we investigated the presence of gluten in twenty one common dietary supplements from the national market using the immunochromatographic assay. This visual assay proved to be an efficient rapid tool for gluten screening as an alternative to the ELISA techniques. The results have shown the presence of gluten in 23.8% of the investigated samples (vitamins, minerals, plant extracts, probiotics supplements, lactoferrin, propolis supplements). The results provide information which may contribute to the completion of the existing lists of gluten-free pharmaceuticals. It is known that for CD patients obtaining accurate information about the gluten content of a particular item is a difficult and time-consuming process.},

To unravel the possible role of the interactions between gliadin peptides and specific intestinal bacteria, the response of intestinal epithelial (Caco-2) cells to gliadin subjected to gastrointestinal digestion in the presence or absence of Bifidobacterium longum CECT 7347 has been studied. Changes in the proteome of Caco-2 cells were determined by 2DE and MALDI-TOF. Gliadins digested without B. longum altered the expression of a higher number of proteins than in the presence of the bacterium (21 versus 9), and these proteins were involved in disorganization of cell cytoskeleton, inflammation, and apoptosis. Gliadins digested in the presence of the bacterium influenced the production of proteins involved in calcium homeostasis and cell survival and function. Therefore, B. longum CECT 7347 might ameliorate gliadin toxicity and modify the responses of intestinal epithelial cells to the gliadin challenge.},

   abstract = {Celiac disease is an immune-mediated disorder triggered by gluten proteins of wheat (gliadins) and other cereals. Gliadin-mediated effects on weanling animals, sensitized or not with interferon (IFN)-gamma, were investigated. Also, the influence of the co-administration of Bifidobacterium longum CECT 7347 was studied together with changes in the proteome of jejunal sections, using 2DE and MALDITOF-TOF peptide fingerprinting. Findings were compared to results for control animal groups. In the principal component analysis (PCA) of proteome pattern, two components were extracted accounting for 79.8% of variability in the expression of the identified proteins. PCA analysis clearly discriminated between the proteome of animals fed gliadins alone and those fed gliadins and B. longum simultaneously. However, the proteome patterns from animals sensitized with IFN-gamma and fed gliadins together with B. longum, or alone, could not be discriminated. Gliadin feeding caused inflammatory effects as well as changes in proteins involved in intracellular ionic homeostasis, lipid turnover, cell motility and redox regulation in intestinal sections. After feeding gliadins to animals sensitized with IFN-gamma, changes were also detected in proteins involved in recruitment and function of inmunocompetent cells, trophic effect on the intestine and organization of myofibers reflecting the more marked gliadin-mediated injury in jejunal sections. The administration of the bacterial strain to rats fed gliadins seemed to ameliorate the inflammation caused by gliadin feeding alone, although, in sensitized animals the co-administration of B. longum had less marked effects, which was probably due to the more extensive intestinal mucosal damage. The proteome patterns in animals administered B. longum alone did not reveal any changes reflecting impairment of jejunal functions.},

   abstract = {There is substantial evidence for PGE2 affecting intestinal epithelial proliferation. PGE2 is also reported to be involved in the regulation of growth and differentiation in adult stem cells, both effects mediated by binding to EP-receptors. We have used the Lgr5 as a marker to scrutinize EP-receptor and COX expression in human intestinal epithelial cells with focus on the stem cell area of the crypts. Normal tissue from ileum and colon, but also duodenal biopsies from patients with untreated celiac disease, were investigated by immunohistochemistry and RT-PCR. The combination of fresh flash-frozen tissue and laser microdissection made it possible to isolate RNA from the epithelial cell layer, only. In the small intestine, Lgr5 labels cells are in the +4 position, while in the colon, Lgr5 positive cells are localized to the crypt bottoms. Epithelial crypt cells of normal small intestine expressed neither EP-receptor mRNA nor COX1/2. However, crypt cells in tissue from patients with untreated celiac disease expressed EP2/4 receptor and COX1 mRNA. In the colon, the situation was different. Epithelial crypt cells from normal colon were found to express EP2/4 receptor and COX1/2 transcripts. Thus, there are distinct differences between normal human small intestine and colon with regard to expression of EP2/4 receptors and COX1/2. In normal colon tissue, PGE2-mediated signaling through EP-receptors 2/4 could be involved in regulation of growth and differentiation of the epithelium, while the lack of EP-receptor expression in the small intestinal tissue exclude the possibility of a direct effect of PGE2 on the crypt epithelial cells.},

   abstract = {The prolamin peptides in wheat gluten and in the homologous storage proteins of barley and rye cause painful chronic erasure of microvilli of the small intestine epithelium in celiac patients. If untreated, it can lead to chronic diarrhea, abdominal distension, osteoporosis, weight-loss due to malabsorption of nutrients, and anemia. In addition to congenital cases, life-long exposure to gluten proteins in bread and pasta can also induce development of celiac sprue in adults. To date, the only effective treatment is life-long strict abstinence from the staple food grains. Complete exclusion of dietary gluten is, however, difficult due to use of wheat in many foods, incomplete labeling and social constraints. Thus, finding alternative therapies for this most common foodborne disease remained an active area of research, which has led to many suggestions in last few years. The pros and cons associated with these therapies were reviewed in the present communication. As different celiac patients are immunogenic to different members of the undigestible proline/glutamine rich peptides of ~149 gliadins and low molecular weight glutenin subunits as well as the six high molecular weight glutenin subunits, an exhaustive digestion of the immunogenic peptides in the stomach, duodenum, jejunum, and ileum of celiacs is required. In view of the above, we evaluated the capacity of cereal grains to synthesize and store the enzymes prolyl endopeptidase from Flavobacterium meningosepticum and the barley cysteine endoprotease B2, which in combination are capable of detoxifying immunogenic gluten peptides in a novel treatment of celiac disease.},

   abstract = {UNLABELLED: Celiac disease is one of the most common forms of food intolerance in children, being an autoimmune enteropathy occurring in genetically susceptible individuals. The only treatment of celiac disease consists in a lifelong strict gluten-free diet. After gluten free diet patients with normal weight or growth failure risk become obese on the one hand because of recovery intestinal absorption and, on the other hand, nutritionally unbalanced diet, high in fat and protein. AIM: The aim of this study was to assess the nutritional status and the presence and prevalence of various changes dyslipidemia in gluten free diet. MATERIAL AND METHODS: The trial was formed by 92 patients (mean age at diagnosis 88,5 months) diagnosed with CD between January 2008 - December 2010 in 2nd and 3rd Pediatric Clinics of "Sf. Maria" Hospital Iasi. Patients were divided into two groups: group I included 36 patients younger than 2 years and group II included 52 patients aged over 2 years at time of diagnosis of celiac disease. All patients received gluten free diet. Were evaluated periodically anthropometric indices (weight, height, body mass index and Z scores in children over 2 years and weight and nutritional index in children under 2 years) and lipid profile (total lipids, total cholesterol, HDL cholesterol, triglycerides). Assessing food intake was achieved by interviewing parents and children on dietary habits and daily food ration. RESULTS: Assessment of nutritional status: group I:--after 24 months of gluten free diet 5 cases presented overweight; group II: after 24 months of gluten free diet obesity (BMI > 30) was found in 16.07% of cases (9 patients) and overweight (BMI > 25) was found in 28.57% of cases (16 patients). Food intake: in all cases was observed increased calorie intake by an excess of lipids and carbohydrates in the diet. Investigation of lipid metabolism: in group II high values of cholesterol were found in 12 cases (21,42 of cases). In conclusions, in celiac disease gluten free diet should be balanced caloric, fat and protein to ensure an optimal nutritional status and prevent long-term complications.},

   abstract = {Oral tolerance is the state of local and systemic immune unresponsiveness that is induced by oral administration of innocuous antigen such as food proteins. An analogous but more local process also regulates responses to commensal bacteria in the large intestine and, together, mucosally induced tolerance appears to prevent intestinal disorders such as food allergy, celiac disease, and inflammatory bowel diseases. Here we discuss the anatomical basis of antigen uptake and recognition in oral tolerance and highlight possible mechanisms underlying the immunosuppression. We propose a model of stepwise induction of oral tolerance in which specialized populations of mucosal dendritic cells and the unique microenvironment of draining mesenteric lymph nodes combine to generate regulatory T cells that undergo subsequent expansion in the small intestinal lamina propria. The local and systemic effects of these regulatory T cells prevent potentially dangerous hypersensitivity reactions to harmless antigens derived from the intestine and hence are crucial players in immune homeostasis.},

   abstract = {Interactions between environmental factors and predisposing genes could be involved in the development of coeliac disease (CD). This study has assessed whether milk-feeding type and HLA-genotype influence the intestinal microbiota composition of infants with a family history of CD. The study included 164 healthy newborns, with at least one first-degree relative with CD, classified according to their HLA-DQ genotype by PCR-SSP DQB1 and DQA1 typing. Faecal microbiota was analysed by quantitative PCR at 7 days, and at 1 and 4 months of age. Significant interactions between milk-feeding type and HLA-DQ genotype on bacterial numbers were not detected by applying a linear mixed-model analysis for repeated measures. In the whole population, breast-feeding promoted colonization of C. leptum group, B. longum and B. breve, while formula-feeding promoted that of Bacteroides fragilis group, C. coccoides-E. rectale group, E. coli and B. lactis. Moreover, increased numbers of B. fragilis group and Staphylococcus spp., and reduced numbers of Bifidobacterium spp. and B. longum were detected in infants with increased genetic risk of developing CD. Analyses within subgroups of either breast-fed or formula-fed infants indicated that in both cases increased risk of CD was associated with lower numbers of B. longum and/or Bifidobacterium spp. In addition, in breast-fed infants the increased genetic risk of developing CD was associated with increased C. leptum group numbers, while in formula-fed infants it was associated with increased Staphylococcus and B. fragilis group numbers. Overall, milk-feeding type in conjunction with HLA-DQ genotype play a role in establishing infants' gut microbiota; moreover, breast-feeding reduced the genotype-related differences in microbiota composition, which could partly explain the protective role attributed to breast milk in this disorder.},

   abstract = {Coeliac disease (CD) is a malabsorptive enteropathy resulting from intolerance to gluten. Environmental factors and the microbiota are suggested to have critical roles in the onset of CD. The CD71 IgA receptor on epithelial cells is responsible for abnormal retrotranscytosis of IgA-gluten peptide complexes from the intestinal lumen into the lamina propria, inducing intestinal inflammation. However, understanding the role of gluten in the CD physiopathology has been hindered by the absence of relevant animal models. Here, we generated a mouse model for CD to study the factors controlling its pathogenesis as well as to investigate the influence of oral delivery of probiotics on disease development. Gluten sensitivity was established by feeding three generations of BALB/c mice a gluten-free diet (G-) followed by gluten challenge (G+) for 30 days. The G+ mice developed villous atrophy, crypt hyperplasia and infiltration of T cells and macrophages in the small intestine. Inflammation was associated with an overexpression of CD71 on the apical side of enterocytes and an increase of plasma cells producing IgA, which colocalised with the CD71. Moreover, IgA colocalised with the transglutaminase 2 (TG2), the production of which was increased in the lamina propria of G+ mice. These mice displayed increased production of cyclooxygenase-2 (COX-2), pro-inflammatory cytokines and IL-15, as well as anti-gliadin and anti-TG2 autoantibodies. The commensal flora-isolated presumptive probiotic Saccharomyces boulardii KK1 strain hydrolysed the 28-kDa alpha-gliadin fraction, and its oral delivery in G+ mice improved enteropathy development in association with decrease of epithelial cell CD71 expression and local cytokine production. In conclusion, the G+ BALB/c mouse represents a new mouse model for human CD based on histopathological features and expression of common biomarkers. The selected probiotic treatment reversing disease development will allow the study of the role of probiotics as a new therapeutic approach of CD.},

   abstract = {The global prevalence of celiac disease is of one person per 250 inhabitants. The disease is induced by gluten, a peptide contained in wheat, rye and barley that during small intestinal digestion generates smaller peptides. Some of these are resistant to hydrolysis and cross through the epithelium into the mucosa, inducing a cascade of immune reactions leading to the appearance of the disease in susceptible individuals. Gluten appeared as a consequence of agricultural practices initiated 10000 years ago in the Fertile Crescent of southwest Asia. Celiac disease epidemiology is complicated since consumption of gluten differs depending on the origin of populations. Treatment of celiac disease consists of withdrawing gluten from the diet, a task that becomes difficult in the long term. The concept of gluten-free food has changed along time. This article updates the concept of celiac disease, the history of gluten consumption in the world, the characteristics of a gluten free diet and the difficulties to adhere to it.},

   abstract = {BACKGROUND AND OBJECTIVE: Risk haplotypes have been described in celiac disease (CD), but the influence of native genes on CD in Hispanic Americans is unknown. The aim of the study was to measure the frequency of Amerindian mitochondrial DNA (mtDNA) haplogroups (inherited by the maternal line) in mixed-blood patients with CD from Chile, Argentina, and Uruguay, and to assess the relation between these and human leukocyte antigen (HLA) alleles and haplotypes and clinical presentations. PATIENTS AND METHODS: Clinical history, histological data, and genetic studies were conducted following 2 protocols: a case-control study of 72 Chilean patients with CD and controls, and an assessment of 43 (additional) samples of celiac patients from Chile, 96 from Argentina, and 57 from Uruguay, compared with the mtDNA frequency in the corresponding country. HLA typing was performed by a commercial kit, and mtDNA was determined by means of polymerase chain reaction and restriction fragment length polymorphisms analysis. RESULTS: A total of 73.6% of cases had typical presentations. The most frequent HLA alleles were HLA-DQB*201 and 202. No-DQ2/DQ8 HLA haplotypes were found in 7% of cases. mtDNA frequencies for typical Amerindian haplogroups were found in 71% of cases and 64% of controls (P chi2 = 0.016); in the comparative analysis, mtDNA distribution was not different from the figures reported for the respective general country population. No relation was found between haplotypes or haplogroups and clinical presentations. CONCLUSIONS: mtDNA haplogroups A/B/C/D were frequently found in celiac patients and controls, but no relations appeared between haplogroups, haplotypes, and clinical presentations.},

In this report, we describe screening tests in children coming to the Friuli Venezia Giulia region in Northeastern Italy from non-European Union regions and suspected to have celiac disease, the problems involved in diagnosis of the disease, and the "drawn double nostalgia" of Romanian children for both Italian food and traditional Romanian foods. Of 3150 Western European cases, we found 712 with positive antibodies for IgA/IgG antitransglutaminase, 174 with a positive antiendomysium antibody confirmation test, and 20 with an IgA deficit. Of the children examined, 93% were children native to Western Europe, 4% were immigrants from Eastern Europe, and 1.6% originated from Africa. Among these, four Romanian children with celiac disease brought in their drawings, as requested in a hospital questionnaire. The prevalence of celiac disease is destined to increase among immigrants. Economic problems are common, and the twin nostalgia of immigrant children for foods and tastes that are "cozonac" (from the native country) and "panettone" (Italian cake flavor) represents a problem that will be difficult to resolve. Only some children's hospitals in Italy, ie, Burlo Garofolo and Gaslini, public and private foundations, or volunteer associations would be able to deal with this problem.},

   abstract = {INTRODUCTION: In adult patients, the diagnostic process for celiac disease (CD) is often very late and generates health complications that would be avoided by earlier diagnosis. The diseases of wich these patients were diagnosed before setting the diagnosis of CD were many and diverse. In addition, following a gluten-free diet (GFD) leads to a reduction in the quality of life for patients, who find it difficult to travel, to find accredited restaurants with menus without gluten, to interpretate food labels or to go to friends' houses. OBJECTIVE: To determine the delay in diagnosis, the satisfaction of the information provided by different sources and circumstances related to the quality of life. METHOD: A retrospective cross-sectional observational study in 98 adult celiac through a validated questionnaire for celiac patientes. RESULTS: The average delay in diagnosis was 11 years and the average of doctors consulted prior to confirmation of the CD was 6. Osteoporosis or osteopenia were nearly twice as common among those who took more than five years to be diagnosed. Some 90% say they transgress the dietary pattern, however, 58% show clinical symptoms due to unnoticed consumption of gluten. The impact of GFD on the quality of life is very high. CONCLUSIONS: Long delays in diagnosis suggest the need for greater awareness among physicians about the EC and the use of serological tests in potential patients or risk groups.},

   abstract = {An all-solid-state potentiometric electronic tongue with 36 polymeric membranes has been used for the first time to detect gliadins, which are primarily responsible for gluten intolerance in people suffering from celiac disease. A linear discriminant model, based on the signals of 11 polymeric membranes, selected from the 36 above using a stepwise procedure, was used to semi-quantitatively classify samples of a "Gluten-free" foodstuff (baby milked flour), previously contaminated with known amounts of gliadins (<10, 20-50 or >50mg/kg), as "Gluten-free", "Low-Gluten content" or "Gluten-containing". For this food matrix, the device had sensitivity towards gliadins of 1-2mg/kg and overall sensitivity and specificity of 77% and 78%, respectively. Moreover, the device never identified an ethanolic extract containing gliadins as "Gluten-free". Finally, the system also allowed distinguishing "Gluten-free" and "Gluten-containing" foodstuffs (15 foods, including breads, flours, baby milked flours, cookies and breakfast cereals) with an overall sensitivity and specificity greater than 83%, using the signals of only 4 selected polymeric membranes (selected using a stepwise procedure). Since only one "Gluten-containing" foodstuff was misclassified as "Gluten-free", the device could be used as a preliminary tool for quality control of foods for celiac patients.},

   abstract = {On contact with the skin, nickel may cause allergic contact dermatitis, which can be diagnosed by an epicutaneous patch test. Nickel exposure via the intestinal mucosa can induce diarrhea, abdominal pain, and swelling. The aim of the present study was to investigate the relationship between these symptoms and nickel intake by means of a novel oral mucosa patch test. Eighty-six patients with intestinal symptoms related to ingestion of nickel-containing foods were submitted to epicutaneous and oral mucosa patch tests for nickel. All patients with positive oral mucosa patch test results were subject to a low-nickel diet and monitored over time. Skin lesions were observed in 33 out of 86 (38.4%) patients evaluated by the epicutaneous patch test. Mucosal lesions were seen in 53 out of 86 (61.6%) patients given the oral mucosa patch test. After 2 months of a low-nickel diet, 52 out of 53 (98.1%) patients showed an improvement of their symptoms. There is a significant correlation between response time of the oral mucosa patch test and the latency of symptoms after ingestion of nickel-containing foods. Consequently, the oral mucosa patch test can be used to recognize and study the adverse effects of dietary nickel exposure that could be defined as allergic contact mucositis. A low-nickel diet is also shown to be an effective treatment for this condition.},

   abstract = {BACKGROUND & AIMS: Copolymers of hydroxyethyl methacrylate and styrene sulfonate complex with isolated gliadin (the toxic fraction of gluten) and prevent damage to the intestinal barrier in HLA-HCD4/DQ8 mice. We studied the activity toward gluten and hordein digestion and biologic effects of poly(hydroxyethyl methacrylate-co-styrene sulfonate (P(HEMA-co-SS)). We also investigated the effect of gliadin complex formation in intestinal biopsy specimens from patients with celiac disease. METHODS: We studied the ability of P(HEMA-co-SS) to reduce digestion of wheat gluten and barley hordein into immunotoxic peptides using liquid chromatography-mass spectrometry. The biodistribution and pharmacokinetic profile of orally administered P(HEMA-co-SS) was established in rodents using tritium-labeled polymer. We assessed the capacity of P(HEMA-co-SS) to prevent the immunologic and intestinal effects induced by a gluten-food mixture in gluten-sensitized HLA-HCD4/DQ8 mice after short-term and long-term administration. We measured the effects of gliadin complex formation on cytokine release ex vivo using intestinal biopsy specimens from patients with celiac disease. RESULTS: P(HEMA-co-SS) reduced digestion of wheat gluten and barley hordein in vitro, thereby decreasing formation of toxic peptides associated with celiac disease. After oral administration to rodents, P(HEMA-co-SS) was predominantly excreted in feces, even in the presence of low-grade mucosal inflammation and increased intestinal permeability. In gluten-sensitized mice, P(HEMA-co-SS) reduced paracellular permeability, normalized anti-gliadin immunoglobulin A in intestinal washes, and modulated the systemic immune response to gluten in a food mixture. Furthermore, incubation of P(HEMA-co-SS) with mucosal biopsy specimens from patients with celiac disease showed that secretion of tumor necrosis factor-alpha was reduced in the presence of partially digested gliadin. CONCLUSIONS: The copolymer P(HEMA-co-SS) reduced digestion of wheat gluten and barley hordein and attenuated the immune response to gluten in a food mixture in rodents. It might be developed to prevent or reduce gluten-induced disorders in humans.},

   abstract = {OBJECTIVE: Folate has heterogeneous functions and is involved in several activities in both animal and human body. It is an important constituent of our organism, and its bioavailability is mainly dependent from the correct function of our gastrointestinal tract. Our aim is to describe what happens to folate homeostasis in gastrointestinal health and disease, analyzing the alterations of folate metabolism in some specific conditions of intestinal and liver impairment. DISCUSSION: Folate absorption and metabolization involve the small intestine and the liver; in conditions of gastrointestinal tract disease (i.e. celiac disease, liver disease) folate function may be compromised with important consequences on the whole organism. Moreover, folate deficiency may produce gastrointestinal alterations too. For this reason, the gastrointestinal tract could be the responsible but also the victim of folate deficiency. CONCLUSIONS: The presence of folate deficiency should always be assessed in patients with a gastrointestinal disease. Further studies are needed to assess the role of folates in gastrointestinal tract diseases and in other gynecologic, neurologic, psychiatric, cardiovascular, ophthalmic and neoplastic diseases. Folates supplementation could be considered, in the future, as an effective complimentary therapy in several pathologic conditions.},

   abstract = {PURPOSE: In addition to genetic risk, environmental factors might influence coeliac disease (CD) development. We sought to assess the effect of the interaction between milk-feeding practices and the HLA-DQ genotype on peripheral lymphocyte subsets and their activation markers in infants at familial risk for CD. METHODS: 170 newborns were classified in 3 different genetic risk groups (high risk, HR; intermediate risk, IR; and low risk, LR) after DQB1 and DQA1 typing. Lymphocyte subsets were studied at the age of 4 months by flow cytometry analysis. RESULTS: 79 infants were receiving exclusive breastfeeding (BF) and 91 partial breastfeeding or formula feeding (FF). Regarding genetic risk, 40 infants were classified in HR group, 75 in IR group and 55 in LR group. Two-way ANOVA did not show significant interactions between the type of milk feeding and genetic risk group on the lymphocyte subsets analysed. One-way ANOVA for milk-feeding practice alone showed that the percentage of CD4 + CD25+ cells was significantly higher in BF group than in FF group (BF, 10.92 +/- 2.71; FF, 9.94 +/- 2.96; p = 0.026), and absolute counts of CD4 + CD38+ cells were significantly higher in FF group than in BF group (FF, 2,881.23 +/- 973.48; BF, 2,557.95 +/- 977.06; p = 0.038). One-way ANOVA for genetic risk alone showed that absolute counts of NK cells were significantly higher in IR group than HR and LR groups (IR, 539.24 +/- 340.63; HR, 405.01 +/- 239.53; LR, 419.86 +/- 262.85; p = 0.028). CONCLUSION: Lymphocyte subset profiles in the early stages of life could be modulated by milk-feeding practices and genetic risk separately. Breastfeeding might have a positive immunomodulatory effect on lymphocyte subsets in infants at risk of CD.},

   abstract = {Celiac disease (CD) is an immune-mediated enteropathy, triggered by dietary wheat gluten and similar proteins of barley and rye in genetically susceptible individuals. The etiology of this disorder is complex, involving both environmental and genetic factors. The major genetic risk factor for CD is represented by HLA-DQ genes, which account for approximately 40% of the genetic risk; however, only a small percentage of carriers develop the disease. Gluten is the main environmental factor responsible for the signs and symptoms of the disease, but exposure to gluten does not fully explain the manifestation of CD. Epidemiological and clinical data suggest that environmental factors other than gluten might play a role in disease development, including early feeding practices (e.g., breast milk versus formula and duration of breastfeeding), infections, and alterations in the intestinal microbiota composition. Herein, we review what is known about the influence of dietary factors, exposure to infectious agents, and intestinal microbiota composition, particularly in early life, on the risk of developing CD, as well as the possible dietary strategies to induce or increase gluten tolerance.},

   abstract = {BACKGROUND: Celiac disease (CD) is an autoimmune disease that develops in patients with a genetic predisposition, incurring a susceptibility to gluten-containing foods such as barley, wheat, and rye. The elimination of gluten from the diet is the main therapeutic approach and usually leads to clinical and laboratory improvement. There are no ideal markers that objectively assess dietary compliance in CD patients. MATERIALS AND METHODS: Sixty newly diagnosed CD patients (male/female: 43/17) and 40 healthy subjects (male/female: 23/17) were enrolled in this study. The diagnosis of CD was established by both histological findings of duodenum biopsy (total villous atrophy and lymphocytic infiltration) and positive antibodies against endomysium or gliadin. RESULTS: A significantly higher mean platelet volume (MPV) was observed in the CD group compared with healthy subjects (8.45 +/- 0.96 fL versus 7.93 +/- 0.63 fL; p = 0.004). After introduction of a gluten-free diet, the MPV of CD patients in the dietary adherent group was significantly lower than that of the non-adherent group (8.09 +/- 0.6 fL versus 8.9 +/- 1.08 fL; p = 0.001). Overall dietary adherence rate was 71.6% (43/60 CD patients). In the dietary compliant group, initiation of gluten-free diet was associated with a significant decrease in MPV from base-line values (8.56 fL versus 8.25 fL; p = 0.008). In the non-adherent group, MPV on 3-month follow-up was higher than at base-line (8.05 fL versus 8.91 fL; p = 0.001). CONCLUSION: MPV could be a promising and easily available biomarker for monitoring of dietary adherence in CD patients at a low cost in comparison with other modalities.},

   abstract = {Gluten, a complex protein group in wheat, rye, and barley, causes celiac disease (CD), an autoimmune enteropathy of the small intestine, in genetically susceptible individuals. CD affects about 1% of the general population and causes significant health problems. Adverse inflammatory reactions to gluten are mediated by inappropriate T-cell activation leading to severe damage of the gastrointestinal mucosa, causing atrophy of absorptive surface villi. Gluten peptides bind to the chemokine receptor, CXCR3, and induce release of zonulin, which mediates tight-junction disassembly and subsequent increase in intestinal permeability. Proinflammatory cytokine IL-15 also contributes to the pathology of CD, by driving the expansion of intra-epithelial lymphocytes that damage the epithelium and promote the onset of T-cell lymphomas. There is no cure or treatment for CD, except for avoiding dietary gluten. Current gluten thresholds for food labeling have been established based on the available analytical methods, which show variation in gluten detection and quantification. Also, the clinical heterogeneity of celiac patients poses difficulty in defining clinically acceptable gluten thresholds in gluten-free foods. Presently, there is no bioassay available to measure gluten-induced immunobiological responses. This review focuses on various aspects of CD, and the importance of gluten thresholds and reference material from an immunological perspective.},

   abstract = {Coeliac disease is a permanent inflammatory disorder of the small bowel affecting approximately 1% of the population. The only effective treatment that exists is exclusion of gluten from the diet. The present paper aims to review the literature as to whether oats are safe to eat for people with coeliac disease. Much data exist on the restrictive nature that adhering to a gluten-free diet imposes on an individual. If oats could be eaten, this would help reduce the restrictive nature of the diet. This in turn could lead to an increase in the quality of life. Oats are of high-nutritional value, providing a rich source of fibre, vitamins and minerals. The fibre source contains soluble fibre which is believed to help reduce LDL-cholesterol. A systematic review of the literature was conducted. Earlier studies conducted are difficult to compare as they used different methodologies and it is not known whether samples of oats in the studies were contaminated with gluten from other cereals. Many studies reviewed do not state the strain of oat used. Recent research has suggested that it may only be in certain strains of oats which could produce a toxic response to people with coeliac disease. In conclusion, research suggests that the risk from consuming oats may be less harmful than first thought; however, may vary according to the strain of oat. Handling that risk in clinical practice remains controversial.},

   abstract = {The current 'Darwinian' synthesis of the hygiene (or 'Old Friends') hypothesis suggests that the increase in chronic inflammatory disorders that started in Europe in the mid-19th century and progressed until the late 20th century is at least partly attributable to immunodysregulation resulting from lack of exposure to microorganisms that were tasked by co-evolutionary processes with establishing the 'normal' background levels of immunoregulation, a role that they perform in concert with the normal microbiota. This is an example of 'evolved dependence'. The relevant organisms co-evolved with mammals, already accompanied early hominids in the Paleolithic era and are associated with animals, mud and faeces. These organisms often establish stable carrier states, or are encountered continuously in primitive environments as 'pseudocommensals' from mud and water. These organisms were not lost during the first epidemiological transition, which might even have resulted in increased exposure to them. However, the crucial organisms are lost progressively as populations undergo the second epidemiological transition (modern urban environment). Recently evolved sporadic 'childhood infections' are not likely to have evolved immunoregulatory roles, and epidemiology supports this contention. The consequences of the loss of the Old Friends and distortion of the microbiota are aggravated by other modern environmental changes that also lead to enhanced inflammatory responses (obesity, vitamin D deficiency, pollution (dioxins), etc.). The range of chronic inflammatory disorders affected may be larger than had been assumed (allergies, autoimmunity, inflammatory bowel disease, but also coeliac disease, food allergy, vascular disease, some cancers, and depression/anxiety when accompanied by raised inflammatory cytokines).},

   abstract = {UNLABELLED: In predisposed individuals dietary intake of cereal products may lead to the development of food allergy or celiac disease. These diseases may also coexist with each other. In recent years, a change in the clinical picture of celiac disease has been observed and the incidence of atypical forms has increased. The disease is currently either diagnosed late or often remains undiagnosed. The article presents a case of an underweight 11- year old girl with height deficiency and recurrent respiratory infections, as well as chronic rhinitis, occurring from the age of three. On the basis of complex differential diagnosis, sensitization to tree pollens, and to cow's milk protein and gluten were identified. Despite the detection of antibodies specific for celiac disease, such as the antibodies against smooth muscle endomysium (IgAEMA) and anti-tissue transglutaminase antibodies (IgAtTGAb), the histological confirmation of the diagnosis was not obtained. Implementation of the gluten and milk protein-free - elimination diet and the use of antihistamines resulted in clinical improvement and the disappearance of markers of both food sensitization and celiac disease. The second food provocation test was negative for previously detected markers of food sensitization but showed the presence of IgAEMA and IgAtTGAb and the histological features of intestinal mucosa typical for celiac disease. CONCLUSIONS: The diagnosis of food allergy or other chronic diseases which can cause growth disturbance (short stature and/or impaired weight gain ) should not exempt from the obligation of estimating the markers specific for celiac disease.},

   abstract = {Celiac disease is an autoimmune disorder that is known specifically for causing inflammation of the mucosa in the small intestine. Through multiple diagnostic and screening tools such as small intestinal biopsy sample, serological testing, and human leukocyte antigen testing, healthcare providers can diagnose this disease that contains components related to genetic predisposition and intake of gluten proteins found in wheat, barley, and rye. There are some who believe that having an autoimmune disease may predispose one to acquiring another disease. With patients experiencing mostly diarrhea, abdominal pain, and weight loss, the implementation of a gluten-free diet is the treatment that healthcare providers recommend. Through monitoring gluten intake and providing nutritional supplementation, those diagnosed with celiac disease can lead a relatively normal life without complications. With celiac disease affecting all age ranges in the population, and with a documented higher frequency, there is a growing awareness in society that can be easily seen in grocery stores, restaurants, and food manufacturers.},

CD can manifest with classic symptoms; however, some unusual features like osteomalacia that has become more and more rare, may be the presenting symptom. We describe here a case of osteomalacia secondary to delayed diagnosis of celiac disease. This patient complained about progressive limping, weakness, short stature, and skeletal deformities. Radiological and laboratory findings were all in favor of osteomalacia. Celiac disease was mentioned according to the history of subtle intermittent diarrhea, abdominal discomfort and confirmed with intestinal biopsy and detection of specific autoantibodies. Improvement of patient's weakness and laboratory abnormalities was obvious after treatment with gluten free diet, vitamin D, calcium and other trace elements. In conclusion, this case affirms that chronic celiac disease especially untreated one, can lead to irreversible complications like skeletal deformities and short stature.},

   abstract = {This study examined the potential role of psychological symptoms in limiting the translation of positive intention into strict gluten free diet (GFD) adherence in coeliac disease (CD) within a theory of planned behaviour (TPB) framework. It was hypothesised that participants with more symptomatic psychological profiles would exhibit poorer adherence, primarily in the context of positive intentions. Coeliac disease participants (N=390) completed online measures of gluten free diet adherence, psychological symptoms, coping behaviour, and TPB items. Intention and behaviour were moderately correlated, confirming the existence of the intention-behaviour gap. Psychological symptoms accounted for additional variance over and above TPB variables in GFD adherence but not intention. Participants who failed to act on their positive intentions displayed more psychological symptoms and greater reliance on maladaptive coping strategies than those with consistent intention-behaviour relationships (p<.01). The heightened incidence of psychological symptoms in CD has a small but significant negative impact on the ability to translate positive intentions into strict adherence. Directions for future research including interventions to improve GFD adherence are discussed.},

   abstract = {Gliadins, and primarily alpha-gliadins containing several sequences such as aa 31-49, aa 56-88 (33-mer), aa 57-68, and aa 69-82, are critical in the induction of immune response or toxic reaction leading to the development of celiac disease (CLD). The role of IgA anti-gliadin antibodies (IgA AGA) is unknown. To this end, we prepared several humanized monoclonal IgA AGA using transgenic alpha1KI mice. Employing Pepscan with overlapping decapeptides of alpha-gliadin we observed a robust similarity between the specificity of humanized mouse monoclonal IgA AGA and IgA AGA from patients with florid CLD. The common immunodominant region included several sequential epitopes localized in the N-terminal part of alpha-gliadin (QFQGQQQPFPPQQPYPQPQPFP, aa 29-50, and QPFPSQQPYLQL, aa 47-58). Notably, IgA AGA produced by clones 8D12, 15B9, 9D12, and 18E2 had significant reactivity against sequences localized in the 33-mer, LQLQPFPQPQ (aa 56-65) and PQLPYPQPQPFL (aa 69-80). Humanized mouse monoclonal IgA AGA that have a known specificity are suitable as standard in ELISAs to detect serum IgA AGA of CLD patients and for studying the AGA pathogenic role in CLD, especially for analyzing the translocation of complex of specific IgA antibodies and individual gliadin peptides through enterocyte barrier.},

   abstract = {Celiac disease (CD) is an immune-mediated enteropathy involving genetic and environmental factors whose interaction might influence disease risk. The aim of this study was to determine the effects of milk-feeding practices and the HLA-DQ genotype on intestinal colonization of Bacteroides species in infants at risk of CD development. This study included 75 full-term newborns with at least one first-degree relative suffering from CD. Infants were classified according to milk-feeding practice (breast-feeding or formula feeding) and HLA-DQ genotype (high or low genetic risk). Stools were analyzed at 7 days, 1 month, and 4 months by PCR and denaturing gradient gel electrophoresis (DGGE). The Bacteroides species diversity index was higher in formula-fed infants than in breast-fed infants. Breast-fed infants showed a higher prevalence of Bacteroides uniformis at 1 and 4 months of age, while formula-fed infants had a higher prevalence of B. intestinalis at all sampling times, of B. caccae at 7 days and 4 months, and of B. plebeius at 4 months. Infants with high genetic risk showed a higher prevalence of B. vulgatus, while those with low genetic risk showed a higher prevalence of B. ovatus, B. plebeius, and B. uniformis. Among breast-fed infants, the prevalence of B. uniformis was higher in those with low genetic risk than in those with high genetic risk. Among formula-fed infants, the prevalence of B. ovatus and B. plebeius was increased in those with low genetic risk, while the prevalence of B. vulgatus was higher in those with high genetic risk. The results indicate that both the type of milk feeding and the HLA-DQ genotype influence the colonization process of Bacteroides species, and possibly the disease risk.},

In the present study, possible differences in Bacteroides spp. and their pathogenic features between CD patients and controls were investigated. Bacteroides clones (n = 274) were isolated, identified, and screened for the presence of the virulence genes (bft and mpII) coding for metalloproteases. The proteolytic activity of selected Bacteroides fragilis strains was evaluated by zymography and, after gastrointestinal digestion of gliadin, by high-pressure liquid chromatography/electrospray ionization/tandem mass spectrometry. The effects of B. fragilis strains on Caco-2 cell culture permeability and inflammatory response to digested gliadin were determined. B. fragilis was more frequently identified in CD patients than in healthy controls, in contrast to Bacteroides ovatus. B. fragilis clones carrying virulence genes coding for metalloproteases were more abundant in CD patients than in controls. B. fragilis strains, representing the isolated clones and carrying metalloprotease genes, showed gelatinase activity and exerted the strongest adverse effects on the integrity of the Caco-2 cell monolayer. All B. fragilis strains also showed gliadin-hydrolyzing activity, and some of them generated immunogenic peptides that preserved or increased inflammatory cytokine production (tumor necrosis factor alpha) and showed increased ability to permeate through Caco-2 cell cultures. These findings suggest that increased abundance of B. fragilis strains with metalloprotease activities could play a role in CD pathogenesis, although further in vivo studies are required to support this hypothesis.},

METHODS: 60 children, including active CD (n=20) and non-active CD (n=20) patients and healthy controls (n=20), were studied. Staphylococci were isolated from faeces and identified by PCR and DNA sequencing. The carriage of virulent genes, including adhesion (atlE and fbe), cell aggregation (icaD), global regulatory (agr and sar) and methicillin-resistant (mecA) genes, was analysed by PCR. RESULTS: Staphylococcus epidermidis was more abundant in the microbiota of active and non-active CD patients than in controls. Staphylococcus haemolyticus was more abundant in active CD patients than in control subjects. Staphylococcus aureus was less abundant in active CD patients than in the other child groups. Staphylococcus spp. diversity was higher in active CD patients than in non-active CD patients and controls. The presence of the mecA gene and the simultaneous presence of both the mecA and atlE genes were higher in S. epidermidis clones isolated from CD patients, with active and non-active disease, than in those from control subjects. The individual presence of the other virulent genes was lower in S. epidermidis from active CD patients than in those from the other -child- groups. CONCLUSIONS: Increased abundance of S. epidermidis carrying the mecA gene, in active and non-active CD patients, most likely reflects increased exposure of these subjects to opportunistic pathogens and antimicrobials.},

   abstract = {Historically, it has been reported that patients with undetected celiac disease (CD) may present with irritable bowel syndrome (IBS) type symptoms. This has led to the recommendation by the American College of Gastroenterology Task force that patients presenting with diarrhea predominant IBS type symptoms should be serologically tested for CD. Concurrently speculative media data suggest that the US general public have increased their uptake of a gluten-free diet (GFD) far in excess of the known prevalence of CD. This may suggest that individuals with gastrointestinal symptoms are deriving benefit from a GFD even if they do not have CD. This has led to the scientific community considering the evidence for an emerging concept of non-celiac wheat sensitivity. There is a significant disparity in our views about what this phenomenon may be. There is also confusion about the nomenclature for this entity and indeed whether patients are suffering due to symptoms related to gluten or perhaps other components of wheat, for example fructans. In this month's edition of the American Journal of Gastroenterology, we see evidence to support the clinical concept of wheat sensitivity or intolerance. Irrespective of the nomenclature Carroccio provides a clinically applicable approach that may be adopted internationally by clinicians. This offers a new option in our armamentarium when seeing patients with IBS type symptoms.},

   abstract = {OBJECTIVE: Celiac disease is an intestinal disorder identified by mucus inflammation, villous atrophy and crypt hyperplasia. This disorder can be controlled by elimination of gluten from daily diet. Patients with celiac disease are at greater risk of gastrointestinal malignancy and non-Hodgkin lymphoma than are the general population. This study tries to present the value of gluten patch test for diagnosis of celiac disease. METHODS: In this investigation, the study population was divided into case and control groups. The case group consisted of patients with celiac disease. The control group were patients involved in celiac disease but suffering from other gastrointestinal disorders. Both gluten patch and placebo patch were attached to the skin between the scapulas. The results were read twice: 48 hours and 96 hours after the patch was applied. Patients who showed irritation reactions were withdrawn from this study. The results were analysed by SPSS software, Spearman's test, chi square, and Mann-Whitney tests. FINDINGS: The value obtained from the gluten patch test after 96 hours are as follows: specification at 95%, sensitivity at 8%, positive prediction value at 67%, and negative prediction value at 43%. CONCLUSION: It can be concluded that the gluten patch test is not an efficient test for screening of celiac disease, however, it can be useful for diagnosis of celiac disease if employed and studied with clinical symptoms and serologic and biopsy tests. Furthermore, we should doubt our judgment if the result of gluten patch test for the patient with celiac disease is positive.},

   abstract = {Strategies to prevent or reduce the risk of allergic diseases are needed. The time of exclusive breastfeeding and introduction of solid foods is a key factor that may influence the development of allergy. For this reason, the aim of this review was to examine the association between exposure to solid foods in the infant's diet and the development of allergic diseases in children. Classical prophylactic feeding guidelines recommended a delayed introduction of solids for the prevention of atopic diseases. Is it really true that a delayed introduction of solids (after the 4th or 6th month) is protective against the development of eczema, asthma, allergic rhinitis and food or inhalant sensitisation? In recent years, many authors have found that there is no statistically significant association between delayed introduction of solids and protection for the development of allergic diseases. Furthermore, late introduction of solid foods could be associated with increased risk of allergic sensitisation to foods, inhalant allergens and celiac disease in children. Tolerance may be driven by the contact of the mucosal immune system with the allergen at the right time of life; the protective effects seem to be enhanced by the practice of the breastfeeding at the same time when weaning is started. Therefore, recent guidelines propose a "window" approach for weaning practice starting at the 17th week and introducing almost all foods within the 27th week of life to reduce the risk of chronic diseases such as allergic ones and the celiac disease. Guidelines emphasize the role of breastfeeding during the weaning practice.},

Gluten proteins are responsible for the symptoms of celiac disease, but other environmental factors that influence the intestinal ecosystem, including the milk-feeding type and gastrointestinal infections, may also play a role. Moreover, intestinal dysbiosis, characterized by increased Gram-negative bacteria and reduced bifidobacteria, has been detected in celiac disease patients.

   abstract = {BACKGROUND: Pure oats are safe for most patients with celiac disease, but concerns regarding contamination by other grains limit their consumption. The Canadian Celiac Association recently released guidelines governing the production of pure oats. The objective was to test the safety of a product manufactured under these guidelines. METHODS: Fifteen adults with established, biopsy-confirmed celiac disease of >/= 1 year duration were challenged with 350 g/wk of pure oats for 12 weeks. Symptom scores, weight, hemoglobin, ferritin, albumin, and tissue transglutaminase (tTG) were assessed at weeks 0, 6, and 12. Duodenal biopsies were obtained before and after oat challenge and assessed based on the modified Marsh-Oberhuber score. Compliance with a gluten-free diet was monitored with random food diaries. RESULTS: Fifteen patients completed the study and were analyzed in intention-to-treat and per-protocol analyses. There were no significant changes in symptom scores, weight, hemoglobin, ferritin, or albumin during oat consumption. The tTG remained negative in all patients, and the histology scores did not significantly change during oat challenge. The only relapse occurred in a patient who became noncompliant with her gluten-free diet. CONCLUSION: The findings support the safety of pure, uncontaminated oats manufactured under Canadian Celiac Association guidelines for patients with celiac disease.},

The detection of gluten/wheat traces in foods is important to safeguard the health of wheat-sensitive individuals and comply with food labeling. Many immunoanalytical-based commercial kits are available for the quantification of gliadin/gluten/wheat proteins. We compared the immunoreactivity of wheat fractions with wheat-allergic human serum IgE and antibody conjugates used in six commercial immunoassay kits. Moreover, the performance of the kits was tested using corn flour spiked with gluten (5, 10, 25, and 50 ppm) and wheat flour (50, 100, 250, and 500 ppm). The albumin, globulin, gliadin, and glutenin fractions reacted with IgE from nine, eight, two, and eight patients' sera, respectively, out of nine wheat allergic patients tested. Among the antibodies from commercial kits, those from R-Biopharm, Morinaga, and Romer Labs reacted strongly with the gliadin fraction, whereas those from BioKits, ALLER-TEK, and ELISA Systems reacted strongly with the glutenin fraction. All kits showed minimal or no reactivity with albumin and globulin fractions. All kits detected the gluten and wheat flour in a corn flour matrix at the lowest spiked levels of 5 and 50 ppm, respectively. However, there was wide variation among the kits when comparing the recovery of gluten and wheat flour. The recovery was also dependent on the source material (gluten or wheat flour) used for spiking the corn flour matrix.},

METHODS: Patients with CD and/or inflammatory bowel disease (IBD) were recruited from the gastroenterology clinics at a medical center and local support groups. Control subjects without CD or IBD were recruited from the staff of the medical center as well as relatives and attendees at support groups. Each participant completed a survey that used two validated PN instruments to define and characterize PN. RESULTS: In the CD group, 38.9% met criteria for PN compared with 38.7% in the IBD group (P = 0.97) and 20.5% in the control group (P < 0.001). On multiple logistic regression, the odds of PN after adjusting for age, gender, diabetes, vitamin B12 deficiency, and cancer history were increased for CD (odds ratio, 2.51; 95% confidence interval, 1.82-3.47) and IBD (odds ratio, 2.78; 95% confidence interval, 1.85-4.18). CONCLUSIONS: PN is more often found in patients with CD and/or IBD than in the general population.},

   abstract = {BACKGROUND: Life-long gluten-free diet (GFD) is the only recognised treatment for coeliac disease (CD). The present study aimed to determine the nutritional adequacy of the 'no detectable gluten' diet. METHODS: Seven-day prospective food intake was assessed in 55 patients who were adherent to a GFD for more than 2 years and in 50 newly-diagnosed age- and sex-matched patients (18-71 years, 24% male) studied prospectively over 12 months on GFD. Historical precoeliac intake was also assessed in the latter group. Intake was compared with Australian Nutritional Recommendations and the Australian population data. RESULTS: Nutritional intake was similar between groups. Of macronutrients, only starch intake fell over 12 months (26% to 23%, P = 0.04). Fibre intake was inadequate for all except in diet-experienced men. More than one in 10 of both newly-diagnosed and experienced women had inadequate thiamin, folate, vitamin A, magnesium, calcium and iron intakes. More than one in 10 newly-diagnosed men had inadequate thiamin, folate, magnesium, calcium and zinc intakes. Inadequate intake did not relate to nutrient density of the GFD. Inadequacies of folate, calcium, iron and zinc occurred more frequently than in the Australian population. The frequency of inadequacies was similar pre- and post-diagnosis, except for thiamin and vitamin A, where inadequacies were more common after GFD implementation. CONCLUSIONS: Dietary intake patterns at 12 months on a GFD are similar to longer-term intake. Dietary inadequacies are common and may relate to habitual poor food choices in addition to inherent deficiencies in the GFD. Dietary education should also address the achievement of adequate micronutrient intake. Fortification of GF foods also need to be considered.},

   abstract = {INTRODUCTION: Diversifying food during the first year of life is an extremely important step for the adequate nutritional status of infants and their physical and psychological development, functioning as a means of transition from lactation to feed the family. Despite the introduction of food diversification is a necessary step for human development, some issues still exist today, not only for the initiation but also in relation to the proper sequence for the various types of food, causing different perspectives and ways of acting on part of clinicians. OBJECTIVES: To determine the best time for the start of food diversification and the best time to introduce certain foods. METHODS: Bibliographic search of the literature in English and Portuguese, from January 2004 to May 2010 through Medline / Pubmed sites and Evidence Based Medicine. Twenty-five of fifty-eight articles were selected, given the full availability of publications and relevance to the topic. RESULTS: The food diversification should never start before 17 or after 2 6 weeks. There is no current evidence that delaying the introduction of any antigen after six months reduces the risk of food allergy, asthma, allergic rhinitis and eczema, even if there is family history of allergy. It is prudent to avoid the introduction of both prior (less than four months) and late (more than seven months) of gluten and a gradual introduction will reduce the risk of celiac disease, type 1 diabetes and allergy to it. The introduction of fish at one year of age reduces the risk of allergic diseases at age four at the immunological benefits of its early introduction outweigh the risks of sensitization to its antigens. CONCLUSIONS: It is important that the onset of food diversification and the introduction of antigens is performed within a specified time interval. It is crucial to implement a healthy diet for the whole family, to the extent that children learn by example.},

   abstract = {Recently, wheat gluten has been proposed as technological adjuvant in order to clarify wines. However, the possibility that residual gluten proteins remain in treated wines cannot be excluded, representing a hazard for wheat allergic or celiac disease patients. In this work, commercial wheat glutens, in both partially hydrolyzed (GBS-P51) and nonhydrolyzed (Gluvital 21000) forms, were used as fining agents in red wine at different concentrations. Beside immunoenzymatic analyses using anti-gliadin, anti-prolamin antibodies and pooled sera of wheat allergic patients, a method based on liquid chromatography coupled to mass spectrometry has been proposed to detect residues of gluten proteins. Residual gluten proteins were detected by anti-prolamin antibodies, anti-gliadin antibodies and sera-IgE only in the wine treated with GBS-P51 at concentration 50, 150, and 300 g/hL, respectively, whereas no residual proteins were detected by these systems in the wine treated with Gluvital 21000. In contrast liquid chromatography-mass spectrometry analyses allowed the detection of proteins in red wines fined down to 1 g/hL of Gluvital 21000 and GBS-P51. Our results indicate that MS methods are superior to immunochemical methods in detecting gluten proteins in wines and that adverse reactions against gluten treated wines cannot be excluded.},

   abstract = {BACKGROUND: A gluten-free diet is the only treatment for patients with coeliac disease, although it can be burdensome to follow and result in inadequate nutrient intake. The cost and availability of a gluten-free diet has been cited as a cause of incomplete dietary compliance; however, this has not been extensively investigated. The aim was to investigate the availability and cost of gluten-free foods across a wide range of stores. METHODS: The availability and cost of 20 foods (both wheat-based and everyday foods) was surveyed at 30 different stores across five different store categories. For each of the 20 foods, four products were selected (branded gluten-free, cheapest gluten-free, branded standard, cheapest standard) resulting in sampling of up to 80 products in each of the 30 stores. RESULTS: In general, there was limited availability of gluten-free foods, with an average of 8.2 of the 20 (41%) foods being available in a gluten-free version per store. Regular supermarkets had a greater availability (18.0/20, 90%), whereas budget supermarkets (1.8/20, 9%) and corner shops (1.8/20, 9%) had almost no gluten-free versions (P < 0.001). All 10 gluten-free versions of wheat-based foods were more costly than their standard counterparts (76-518% more expensive; P < 0.001). Some gluten-free versions of everyday foods were also more costly than standard counterparts (2-124%). CONCLUSIONS: There is limited availability of gluten-free foods and they are generally more expensive than their standard counterparts. This may impact on compliance to a gluten-free diet, with potential nutritional and clinical consequences, together with an increased risk of complications.},

   abstract = {BACKGROUND: Patients with psoriasis who had raised IgG and/or IgA antigliadin antibodies showed clinical improvement in a trial with a gluten-free diet. The selection of patients for the diet treatment was based on the presence of specific antibodies, i.e. the result of humoral immunity. OBJECTIVES: As psoriasis is now considered to be a T cell-mediated disease we decided to challenge peripheral blood mononuclear cells (PBMCs) in vitro from randomly selected patients with well-defined wheat proteins/peptides to explore the possibility of identifying a specific antigen with T cell activating properties in a subgroup of patients. METHODS: PBMCs from 37 patients (20 female and 17 male; mean age 49years) and 37 healthy controls (12 female and 25 male; mean age 57years) were included. Not all patients participated in all experiments. The PBMCs were exposed in vitro with the following wheat proteins/peptides in various concentrations: total albumins, 0.28 alpha-amylase inhibitor and the synthetic peptides, p31-43, p57-68 and p62-75, based on coeliac-active sequences of alpha-gliadin. The proliferative response was measured as counts per minute after the cells had been pulsed with methyl-(3) H-thymidine. RESULTS: Albumin, alpha-amylase inhibitor, p31-43 and p57-68 elicited a significant response in both patients and controls but showed no differences between the groups. The response induced by the alpha-amylase inhibitor was higher than that induced by the albumin fraction and the p31-43 and p57-68 peptides. At a concentration of 25mugmL(-1) , five of 36 patients with psoriasis responded positively to the p62-75 peptide and none of the 33 controls, using a stimulation index of 2.4 as the cut-off level (P<0.05). These five patients did not show clinical features that differed from the remaining patients. Among the responding patients the relative number of CD4+ cells increased in some but not all after in vitro challenge with the albumins, 0.28 alpha-amylase inhibitor, and p62-75. These antigens could also induce in vitro the expression of the homing antigen cutaneous lymphocyte antigen (CLA) in a few patients and controls. CONCLUSIONS: The wheat protein antigens, especially the p62-75 peptide, might be of interest in a subgroup of patients with psoriasis.},

   abstract = {Median arcuate ligament syndrome (MALS) is often diagnosed when idiopathic, episodic abdominal pain is associated with dynamic compression of the proximal celiac artery by fibers of the median arcuate ligament. The character of the abdominal pain is often postprandial and associated with gradual weight loss from poor food intake, suggestive of chronic mesenteric ischemia. However, the pathognomonic imaging feature of dynamic, ostial celiac artery compression with expiration does not consistently predict clinical improvement from revascularization. Proposed but unproven pathophysiological mechanisms include neurogenic pain from compression of the splanchnic nerve plexus and intermittent ischemia from compression of the celiac artery. Alterations in blood flow and ganglion compression are both associated with delayed gastric emptying, another physiological correlate of the clinical syndrome. Published reports describe a variable response to revascularization and nerve plexus resection suggest a need for translational research to better characterize this poorly understood clinical entity. We illustrate the current gaps in our knowledge of MALS with the case of a 51-year-old woman with a 4-year history of chronic abdominal pain who responded to a combination of ganglion resection and celiac artery reconstruction.},

   abstract = {Adverse reactions to foods are classified according to the presence or absence of involvement of the immune system, which may or may not include the production of immunoglobulin E (IgE) antibodies. This review focuses on the epidemiology, diagnosis, and management of adverse food reactions, primarily in adults, and excluding celiac disease and lactose intolerance. Reported reactions to foods are often believed to be manifestations of a food allergy; however, IgE-mediated food allergy only affects 1% to 4% of adults, with seafood, tree nuts, peanuts, fruits, and vegetables being the most common triggers. Diagnosis is challenging and most commonly achieved through careful evaluation of clinical history followed by elimination and reintroduction or challenge with the suspected offending food. With acute-onset allergic reactions, estimation of food-specific IgE antibodies is frequently used to confirm or refute the diagnosis. Recent developments, such as single allergen assays, enhance the diagnosis of IgE-mediated food allergy, but the gold standard remains oral food challenge. Despite recent advances in the management of food allergy, including the promotion of oral tolerance, the mainstay of management is still the avoidance of food triggers. Dietary management can be compromised by nutritional inadequacy, accidental exposure, food labeling, and quality of life or adherence issues. It is essential that adults with confirmed food allergy receive optimal nutrition and dietetic support to enable them to manage their condition.},

   abstract = {UNLABELLED: Carob germ proteins have been shown to have functional properties similar to wheat gluten enabling formulation and production of yeast leavened gluten-free baked goods from a true dough rather than a stiff batter. The purpose of this research was to optimize the production of wheat-free bread containing carob germ flour, corn starch, NaCl, sucrose, hydroxypropyl methylcellulose (HPMC), and H(2)O. A key criterion was to formulate viscoelastic dough similar to wheat dough. To that end, response surface methodology (RSM) was used to determine optimal levels of carob germ flour, H(2)O, and HPMC. Components varied as follows: 4.94%-15.05% for carob germ flour, 0.05%-3.75% HPMC, and 65.25%-83.75% H(2)O (percents are on a flour basis, where carob germ flour in combination with maize starch equals 100%). Sucrose, NaCl, and yeast were held constant at 2%. Bread parameters evaluated were specific volume and crumb hardness, where the largest specific volume and the lowest value for crumb hardness were considered most desirable. The optimum formula as determined by RSM consisted of 7% carob germ flour, 93% maize starch, 2% HPMC, and 80% H(2)O with predicted crumb hardness of ~200 g of force and a specific volume of ~3.5 cm(3)/g. When proof time was optimized, a specific volume of ~5.6 ml/g and crumb hardness value of ~156 g of force was observed. Carob germ flour may be used as an alternative to wheat flour in formulating viscoelastic dough and high quality gluten-free bread. PRACTICAL APPLICATION: Celiac disease affects approximately 1% of the world's population. Sufferers of the disease must consume a gluten-free diet. Currently, gluten-free baked products are made from batters and lack the ability to be made from dough based systems which limits the overall processability and product variety. This research is aimed at the utilization of carob germ protein and its ability to form dough to produce an optimal gluten-free bread formulation. This will help to alleviate problems in processability and product variety associated with gluten-free baked goods.},

   abstract = {Gluten exclusion (protein complex present in many cereals) has been proposed as an option for the prevention of diseases other than coeliac disease. However, the effects of gluten-free diets on obesity and its mechanisms of action have not been studied. Thus, our objective was to assess whether gluten exclusion can prevent adipose tissue expansion and its consequences. C57BL/6 mice were fed a high-fat diet containing 4.5% gluten (Control) or no gluten (GF). Body weight and adiposity gains, leukocyte rolling and adhesion, macrophage infiltration and cytokine production in adipose tissue were assessed. Blood lipid profiles, glycaemia, insulin resistance and adipokines were measured. Expression of the PPAR-alpha and gamma, lipoprotein lipase (LPL), hormone sensitive lipase (HSL), carnitine palmitoyl acyltransferase-1 (CPT-1), insulin receptor, GLUT-4 and adipokines were assessed in epidydimal fat. Gluten-free animals showed a reduction in body weight gain and adiposity, without changes in food intake or lipid excretion. These results were associated with up-regulation of PPAR-alpha, LPL, HSL and CPT-1, which are related to lipolysis and fatty acid oxidation. There was an improvement in glucose homeostasis and pro-inflammatory profile-related overexpression of PPAR-gamma. Moreover, intravital microscopy showed a lower number of adhered cells in the adipose tissue microvasculature. The overexpression of PPAR-gamma is related to the increase of adiponectin and GLUT-4. Our data support the beneficial effects of gluten-free diets in reducing adiposity gain, inflammation and insulin resistance. The data suggests that diet gluten exclusion should be tested as a new dietary approach to prevent the development of obesity and metabolic disorders.},

   abstract = {BACKGROUND AND AIM: Potential celiacs have the 'celiac type' HLA, positive anti-transglutaminase antibodies but no damage at small intestinal mucosa. Only a minority of them develops mucosal lesion. More than 40 genes were associated to Celiac Disease (CD) but we still do not know how those pathways transform a genetically predisposed individual into an affected person. The aim of the study is to explore the genetic features of Potential CD individuals. METHODS: 127 'potential' CD patients entered the study because of positive anti-tissue transglutaminase and no mucosal lesions; about 30% of those followed for four years become frankly celiac. They were genotyped for 13 polymorphisms of 'candidate genes' and compared to controls and celiacs. Moreover, 60 biopsy specimens were used for expression studies. RESULTS: Potential CD bear a lighter HLA-related risk, compared to celiac (chi(2) = 48.42; p value = 1x10(-8)). They share most of the polymorphisms of the celiacs, but the frequency of c-REL* G allele was suggestive for a difference compared to celiac (chi(2) = 5.42; p value = 0.02). One marker of the KIAA1109/IL-2/IL-21 candidate region differentiated potentials from celiac (rs4374642: chi2 = 7.17, p value = 0.01). The expression of IL-21 was completely suppressed in potentials compared to celiacs (p value = 0.02) and to controls (p value = 0.02), in contrast IL-2, KIAA1109 and c-REL expression were over-expressed. CONCLUSIONS: Potential CD show genetic features slightly different from celiacs. Genetic and expression markers help to differentiate this condition. Potential CD is a precious biological model of the pathways leading to the small intestinal mucosal damage in genetically predisposed individuals.},

METHODS: A retrospective, nonrandomized, single institution evaluation of the safety and efficacy of physician modification of a currently Food and Drug Administration-approved device (Zenith Flex; Cook Inc, Bloomington, Ind) to preserve branch vessels when used in the treatment of patients with elective, symptomatic, or ruptured juxtarenal aortic aneurysms. RESULTS: Forty-seven consecutive patients underwent fenestrated endovascular repair using PMEG over a 3-year period. Thirty-eight patients (80%) were symptomatic or had rapid aneurysm expansion. Eighty-five percent of patients were American Society of Anesthesiologist category III or IV. Eight-two fenestrations were created for 58 renal arteries, 16 superior mesenteric arteries, three celiac arteries, and the rest accessory vessels. Mean follow-up was 607 days, with a range of 425 to 1460 days. Mean contrast usage and fluoro time were 98 mL and 48 minutes. Technical success rate was 98%, and freedom from aneurysm-related death was 98%. There were six complications (13%). Three (6%) were access related, and three (6%) were procedure related and included one stroke, one case of renal failure, and one branch artery dissection. On follow-up, six patients (13%) had endoleak. There was one type 1 endoleak and five type 2 endoleaks. In-hospital and 30-day mortality was 2%, with one patient expiring due to aspiration on the ward after successful endovascular repair. Two patients died during follow-up; one at 58 days due to cessation of dialysis and one at 485 days due to stent graft migration and occlusion of the superior mesenteric artery. There were two deaths in the first year, one in the second year, and zero in the most recent year of experience. One patient with endoleak (2%) had aneurysm sac expansion at 1 year requiring secondary intervention. CONCLUSIONS: PMEG is a safe and effective alternative for treating patients with juxtarenal aneurysms who have no other alternatives for repair. Longer-term follow-up is needed to assess the durability of repair and potential for device-related complications.},

This study aims to develop hypoallergenic pasta using blends of Triticum durum semolina, 40% of other non-wheat flours and additives. Formulated pasta samples were evaluated for product quality characteristics and also subjected to biochemical analysis. Results showed that cooking loss ranged from 6.9% to 7.4%, which were within the acceptable range of 8%. Color change was low and in vitro protein digestibility of the pasta was found to be insignificant. Pasting characteristics of the hypoallergenic flour showed the increased peak viscosity and decreased gelatinization temperature. The scanning electron microscopy results demonstrated less-affected microstructure of gluten network. Texture profile analysis and descriptive sensory analysis revealed that optimized hypoallergenic pasta with xanthan gum as additive was acceptable and comparable with control. SDS-PAGE pattern showed distinct protein profile and decreased intensity, which was supported by Dot-Blot. In conclusion, the hypoallergenic pasta prepared by replacing T durum flour by 40% of other non-gluten flours could be useful for celiac patients because of its low antigenic activity.},

   abstract = {BACKGROUND: Current World Health Organization guidelines recommend exclusive breastfeeding for the first 6 months of life. Breastfeeding conveys clear benefits to both mother and child. These benefits are likely to be amplified by prolonged feeding. OBJECTIVE: This article outlines the emerging evidence that suggests possible benefits from introducing complementary solids from 4 months of age in developed countries. DISCUSSION: The human gut may have a critical early window during which it has an opportunity to develop immunological tolerance. Introducing complementary solids from 4 months of age may decrease the risk of food allergy and coeliac disease - immunological illnesses that have become a public health priority. The new draft National Health and Medical Research Council guidelines recommend introducing solids at around 6 months (22-26 weeks). However, given recent evidence, it may be appropriate to recommend the introduction of solids from 4 months of age in the Australian context.},

   abstract = {The intestinal epithelial barrier is indispensable to our immune system. Defects in this barrier function have been observed in intestinal disorders such as inflammatory bowel diseases, food allergies, and celiac diseases. Therefore, the modulation of the barrier function is currently viewed as a potentially positive pharmacological outcome. This review describes a unique peptide, Asn-Pro-Trp- Asp-Gln (NPWDQ), which can finely adjust the intestinal barrier. It is obtained by the hydrolysis of casein, a major milk protein, and considerably inhibits the permeation of ovalbumin, one of the food allergens, in Caco-2, a human intestinal cell line. Using DNA microarray, we observed that NPWDQ only up-regulated expression of the occludin gene, whereas the levels of other genes, such as those of the claudin and zonula occludens families, remained unchanged. Increased protein expression of occludin was also observed. The fact that milk-derived peptide(s) can enhance intestinal barrier function gives a new significance to lactation because it plays an important role in promoting the maturation of the intestinal barrier. In this context, it is highly probable and worthy of considerable attention that various bioactive peptides with this type of activity are yet to be observed in the bovine and/or human casein sequence. Moreover, milkderived peptides could be considered as potential candidates for the prevention of certain intestinal disorders.},

   abstract = {OBJECTIVE: Celiac disease (CD) is an autoimmune disease triggered by exposure to gluten-containing foods. IgA autoantibodies to tissue transglutaminase (TTG) are elevated in CD, but little is known about the gastrointestinal state before the appearance of TTG. Antibodies to wheat storage globulin Glo-3A have been studied in type 1 diabetes, and may be a marker of altered mucosal barrier and/or immune function. In the present study, we investigated antibody responses to Glo-3A in CD. PATIENTS AND METHODS: In the Diabetes Autoimmunity Study in the Young, children were studied prospectively from birth for the appearance of TTG and CD. Fifty cases of CD were frequency matched with 50 controls on age (of TTG seroconversion in the case), sex, ethnicity, presence of a first-degree relative with type 1 diabetes mellitus, and human leukocyte antigen -DR3 genotype. In cases and controls, IgG antibodies to Glo-3A were analyzed in a blinded manner in the sample collected at the time of seroconversion to TTG positivity (or the matched sample in controls) and in all of the previous samples since birth (mean 4.5 samples). The association between Glo-3A antibody levels and CD case status was explored using t tests at the TTG-positive visit and when Glo-3A levels were highest, and mixed modeling to describe Glo-3A over time. RESULTS: At the time of first elevated TTG (mean 4.9 years), patients with CD had higher Glo-3A antibody levels than controls (13.3 +/- 17.2 vs 7.6 +/- 11.7, P = 0.005). In both cases and controls, Glo-3A antibodies appear to peak at a mean age of 2.9 years, before mean age of initial TTG seroconversion. The peak Glo-3A antibody levels were higher in cases than controls (25.5 +/- 21.8 vs 14.9 +/- 18.3 P = 0.0007). Using mixed modeling to account for multiple visits per person, cases had higher levels of Glo-3A antibodies than controls at all ages from birth to TTG seroconversion (beta = 0.53, P = 0.002). CONCLUSIONS: Compared with controls, CD cases have higher Glo-3A antibody responses in the beginning years, before initial detection of TTG.},

The only treatment available to prevent the health impacts of CD is a lifelong, strict gluten-free diet (GFD). There are few studies that explore the experiences of diagnosis and the everyday experiences of living with this chronic condition. METHODS: Utilising a qualitative study design, and purposive sampling, the present study describes the experiences of 10 women with coeliac disease in Victoria, Australia. Individual interviews were conducted with women aged between 31 and 60 years who had been diagnosed with CD for at least 2 years. RESULTS: A thematic analysis of the interview transcripts highlighted a number of issues for those living with the disease. Reactions to diagnosis, transition to a GFD and the changes needed to live with CD are discussed. CONCLUSIONS: A range of recommendations including the need to increase CD awareness and education and further research on the impacts of living with the disease are made.},

   abstract = {From the time of Gee's landmark writings, the recent history of celiac disease (CD) can be divided into many ages, each driven by a diagnostic advance and a deeper knowledge of disease pathogenesis. At the same time, these advances were paralleled by the identification of new clinical patterns associated with CD and by a continuous redefinition of the prevalence of the disease in population. In the beginning, CD was considered a chronic indigestion, even if the causative food was not known; later, the disease was proven to depend on an intolerance to wheat gliadin, leading to typical mucosal changes in the gut and to a malabsorption syndrome. This knowledge led to curing the disease with a gluten-free diet. After the identification of antibodies to gluten (AGA) in the serum of patients and the identification of gluten-specific lymphocytes in the mucosa, CD was described as an immune disorder, resembling a chronic "gluten infection". The use of serological testing for AGA allowed identification of the higher prevalence of this disorder, revealing atypical patterns of presentation. More recently, the characterization of autoantibodies to endomysium and to transglutaminase shifted the attention to a complex autoimmune pathogenesis and to the increased risk of developing autoimmune disorders in untreated CD. New diagnostic assays, based on molecular technologies, will introduce new changes, with the promise of better defining the spectrum of gluten reactivity and the real burden of gluten related-disorders in the population. Herein, we describe the different periods of CD experience, and further developments for the next celiac age will be proposed.},

   abstract = {BACKGROUND & AIMS: The presence of celiac disease-associated autoantibodies (antiendomysium and antitissue transglutaminase [anti-TG2]) with normal jejunal mucosa indicate potential celiac disease. We performed a prospective, 3-year cohort study to determine the natural history of potential celiac disease in children. METHODS: The study included 106 children with potential celiac disease, based on serology analysis and normal duodenal architecture. All but 2 carried the HLA-DQ2 and/or DQ8 haplotype. In all children, every 6 months, growth, nutritional parameters, celiac disease serology, and autoimmunity were investigated. In biopsies, gammadelta intraepithelial-, CD3-, and lamina propria CD25-positive cells were counted; duodenal deposits of anti-TG2 immunoglobulin A were detected. Biopsy analysis was repeated after 2 years on patients with persistent positive serology and/or symptoms. RESULTS: Celiac disease was detected primarily in first-degree relatives and patients with autoimmune disorders (40.6%). A gluten-free diet was prescribed to 20/106 patients because of symptoms, which were relieved in only 11. Eighty-nine of the 106 patients entered the follow-up study, with normal daily consumption of gluten. During the follow-up antibodies disappeared in 14.6% and fluctuated in 32.6%. Villous atrophy was observed in 12/39 patients (30.8%) who underwent a repeat biopsy. CONCLUSIONS: Most children with potential celiac disease remain healthy. After 3 years, approximately 33% of patients develop villous atrophy. Intestinal deposits of anti-TG2 IgA identify children at risk for villous atrophy.},

   abstract = {Coeliac disease (CD) is a systemic immune-mediated disorder elicited by gluten in genetically susceptible individuals. The common factor for all patients with CD is the presence of a variable combination of gluten-dependent clinical manifestations, specific autoantibodies (anti-tissue transglutaminase/anti-endomysium), HLA-DQ2 and/or DQ8 haplotypes and different degrees of enteropathy. Recently, gluten sensitivity has received much interest, although the limits and possible overlap between gluten sensitivity and CD remain poorly defined. At present, a number of morphological, functional and immunological disorders that are lacking one or more of the key CD criteria (enteropathy, associated HLA haplotypes and presence of anti-transglutaminase two antibodies) but respond to gluten exclusion are included under the umbrella of gluten sensitivity. The possible immunological mechanisms underlying these conditions are discussed. Emphasis is given to specific autoantibodies as markers of the coeliac spectrum and to the hypothesis that innate epithelial stress can exist independently from adaptive intestinal immunity in gluten sensitivity.},

   abstract = {BACKGROUND: Approximately 1% of the population suffer from coeliac disease. However, the disease is heavily underdiagnosed. Unexplained symptoms may lead to incremented medical consultations and productivity losses. The aim here was to estimate the possible concealed burden of untreated coeliac disease and the effects of a gluten-free diet. METHODS: A nationwide cohort of 700 newly detected adult coeliac patients were prospectively evaluated. Health care service use and sickness absence from work during the year before diagnosis were compared with those in the general population; the data obtained from an earlier study. Additionally, the effect of one year on dietary treatment on the aforementioned parameters and on consumption of pharmaceutical agents was assessed. RESULTS: Untreated coeliac patients used primary health care services more frequently than the general population. On a gluten-free diet, visits to primary care decreased significantly from a mean 3.6 to 2.3. The consumption of medicines for dyspepsia (from 3.7 to 2.4 pills/month) and painkillers (6.8-5.5 pills/month) and the number of antibiotic courses (0.6-0.5 prescriptions/year) was reduced. There were no changes in hospitalizations, outpatient visits to secondary and tertiary care, use of other medical services, or sickness absence, but the consumption of nutritional supplements increased on treatment. CONCLUSIONS: Coeliac disease was associated with excessive health care service use and consumption of drugs before diagnosis. Dietary treatment resulted in a diminished burden to the health care system and lower use of on-demand medicines and antibiotic treatment. The results support an augmented diagnostic approach to reduce underdiagnosis of coeliac disease. TRIAL REGISTRATION: ClinicalTrials.gov NCT01145287.},

   abstract = {BACKGROUND: Equine inflammatory small bowel disease (ISBD) is an idiopathic pathologic condition seeming to increase in prevalence. OBJECTIVE: To investigate the potential role of gluten in equine ISBD. ANIMALS & METHODS: Antibodies known to be important in the diagnosis of human coeliac disease (CD): IgA antibodies to human recombinant and guinea pig tissue-transglutaminase (TGA), native gliadin (AGA), deamidated-gliadin-peptides (DGPA), and primate and equine endomysium (EMA) were assessed in blood samples from three different groups of horses: ISBD affected (n = 12) on a gluten-rich diet and controls either on gluten-rich (n = 22) or gluten-poor (n = 25) diets. Significant differences (p < 0.05) between groups were assessed using the Wilcoxon test. RESULTS: Both ISBD-affected horses and gluten-rich controls had significantly (p < 0.0004) higher hrTGA titers than gluten-poor controls. However, ISBD horses did not show significantly increased levels of any of the CD related antibodies when compared to gluten-rich controls. Nevertheless, markedly increased antibody levels (TGA, EMA and DGPA) were found in one of the ISBD horses. The introduction of a gluten-free ration in this 14-year-old warmblood stallion resulted after 6 months in the reduction of antibody levels and clinical recovery associated with improved duodenal histopathology. CONCLUSION: To the best of our knowledge, this is the first study assessing gluten-related antibodies in horses and results suggest a potential pathogenic role of gluten in at least some cases of equine ISBD. Clinical importance and impact for human medicine: Given serology and concurrent clinical findings, this study warrants further investigations into the immunologic basis of possible gluten-sensitive enteropathy in horses and analogy with human disease.},

   abstract = {Although it is recognised that a gluten-free diet has many social implications for coeliac disease patients, not much is known about how such patients actually manage these implications in their everyday interactions. This article examines how dietary restrictions are treated by patients and their families. Data from recorded mealtime conversations of seven Dutch families with children suffering from coeliac disease were analysed using discursive psychology. We found two main discursive strategies by which patients and their families manage the diet during mealtime interactions. A reference to pleasure is used to manage the tension between the child's agency and parental responsibility in the face of health requirements and, by softening the denial of food, the diet is normalised and treated as a shared family practice. The analysis shows that the gluten-free diet is demedicalised and treated as a matter of choice rather than prescription. We conclude with the practical implications of these findings.},

   abstract = {BACKGROUND & AIMS: The cytosolic phospolypase A(2) (cPLA(2)) - dependent release of arachidonic acid (AA) from the intra-epithelial lymphocytes plays a pivotal role in arming lymphocytes to cytolysis in the immune response of celiac disease. However, little is known about the role of enterocytes in releasing AA. Docosahexaenoic acid (DHA) is a long chain polyunsaturated fatty acid that counteracts many of the proinflammatory effect of AA. The aims of the present work were to evaluate if: 1) intestinal epithelial cells have a role in the celiac inflammation, releasing AA, and 2) if DHA is able to modulate the celiac inflammation, down-regulating the release of AA. METHODS: A human intestinal epithelial cell line (Caco-2) was exposed to gliadin peptides (PT-gl) (500 mug/ml) and DHA (2 mug/ml), both alone and simultaneously up to 24 h. RESULTS: The exposure of those cells to PT-gl alone resulted in an increased AA release, cycloxygenase-2 expression, cPLA(2) activity and prostaglandin E(2) and interleukin-8 release in culture medium, whereas the simultaneous exposure of the cells to DHA and PT-gl prevented the above-mentioned increases. CONCLUSIONS: These results suggest that intestinal epithelial cells sustain the celiac inflammation, releasing AA when stimulated with gliadin and that DHA inhibits the AA release by these cells.},

   abstract = {GOALS: To characterize the serological pattern of gluten sensitivity (GS) and to compare it with that found in celiac disease. BACKGROUND: GS has recently been identified as a new clinical entity included in the spectrum of gluten-related disorders, but it is still lacking of diagnostic markers. STUDY: Sera from 78 patients with GS and 80 patients with celiac disease were retrospectively assessed for immunoglobulin (Ig)G/IgA antigliadin antibodies (AGA), IgG deamidated gliadin peptide antibodies (DGP-AGA), IgA tissue transglutaminase antibodies (tTGA), and IgA endomysial antibodies (EmA). RESULTS: IgG AGA were positive in 56.4% of GS patients and in 81.2% of celiac patients, with high antibody titers in both groups. IgA AGA were detected in 7.7% of GS patients and in 75% of celiac patients, showing lower enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay activities in GS than those found in celiac disease. Only 1 of the 78 patients with GS was positive for IgG DGP-AGA (detected in 88.7% of patients with celiac disease). IgA tTGA and IgA EmA were negative in all GS patients, whereas their positivity in celiac patients was 98.7% and 95%, respectively. Patients with GS displayed a variegated clinical picture with intestinal and extraintestinal symptoms (abdominal pain, bloating, diarrhea, constipation, foggy mind, tiredness, eczema/skin rash, headache, joint/muscle pain, numbness of legs/arms, depression, and anemia) together with normal or mildly abnormal small intestinal mucosa. CONCLUSIONS: The serological pattern of GS is characterized by IgG AGA positivity in more than half of cases associated to IgA AGA in a few patients, but without EmA, tTGA, and DGP-AGA, which are the specific markers of celiac disease.},

   abstract = {Until a few years ago, celiac disease (CD) was thought to be a rare food intolerance that was confined to childhood and characterized by severe malabsorption and flat intestinal mucosa. Currently, CD is regarded as an autoimmune disorder that is common in the general population (affecting 1 in 100 individuals), with possible onset at any age and with many possible presentations. The identification of CD is challenging because it can begin not only with diarrhea and weight loss but also with atypical gastrointestinal (constipation and recurrent abdominal pain) and extra-intestinal symptoms (anemia, raised transaminases, osteoporosis, recurrent miscarriages, aphthous stomatitis and associated autoimmune disorders), or it could be completely symptomless. Over the last 20 years, the diagnostic accuracy of serology for CD has progressively increased with the development of highly reliable tests, such as the detection of IgA tissue transglutaminase and antiendomysial and IgG antideamidated gliadin peptide antibodies. The routine use of antibody markers has allowed researchers to discover a very high number of 'borderline' cases, characterized by positive serology and mild intestinal lesions or normal small intestine architecture, which can be classified as potential CD. Therefore, it is evident that the 'old celiac disease' with flat mucosa is only a part of the spectrum of CD. It is possible that serology could identify CD in its early stages, before the appearance of severe intestinal damage. In cases with a positive serology but with mild or absent intestinal lesions, the detection of HLA-DQ2 and HLA-DQ8 can help reinforce or exclude the diagnosis of gluten sensitivity.},

   abstract = {At upper gastrointestinal endoscopy to investigate unexplained diarrhea and iron deficiency anemia, duodenal biopsies are often taken to exclude a diagnosis of coeliac disease. While histology remains the gold standard for this diagnosis, recent developments in serological testing may overtake this as a first line test and biopsy restricted to confirming the diagnosis. Established coeliac disease on biopsy is straightforward, but early lesions may pose a challenge. Newer endoscopic procedures such as push-pull enteroscopy (balloon enteroscopy) with biopsy allow access to the small bowel beyond the second part of the duodenum. Controversy remains as to what constitutes the normal histology of the duodenum, and small bowel. Lymphocytic duodenosis (increased intraepithelial lymphocytes with normal villous architecture) in patients with negative coeliac serology can be associated with Helicobacter pylori, drugs, autoimmune and other diseases including food allergy. Full thickness small intestinal biopsies can aid in investigation of enteric neuropathies in severe dysmotility disorders. Biopsies are also taken to investigate malabsorption due to suspected infectious and metabolic disorders. Despite highly active anti-retroviral therapy (HAART), immunosuppressed patients may be affected by duodenal pathogens. The histology of duodenal mucosa in acid related disorders reflects the damage seen at endoscopy. Although the prevalence of duodenal ulcer disease is decreasing, drugs causing ulceration remain an important disease entity. Recent observations in functional bowel disorders suggest that the duodenum may be a key site for pathology. In functional dyspepsia, patients with early satiety may have excess eosinophil infiltration, and the mast cell is probably a key player in the irritable syndrome in the small intestine.},

   abstract = {Gliadins were the major components of wheat storage proteins and determine the extensibility properties of gluten dough. In this work, 19 new full-length gamma-gliadin genes were isolated from various Aegilops and Triticum species. Sequence characterization showed that a specific octapeptide and celiac disease (CD)-toxic epitope Gligamma-3 (VQGQGIIQPQQPAQL) were present in the rich glutamine domain and C-terminal non-repetitive domain, respectively. Based on the sequence features of both peptides, a new classification system for gamma-gliadin gene family was established, in which gamma-gliadins were classified into two types (types I and II) with each consisting of two groups. An uneven distribution of different types and groups of gamma-gliadin genes was exhibited among 11 Aegilops and Triticum genomes. Phylogenetic analysis revealed that types I and II genes diverged at about 14 MYA while the divergence of 4 gamma-gliadin group genes occurred at around 10 MYA almost simultaneously. The gamma-gliadin genes from S(l) and B genomes displayed a different transcriptional expression pattern during grain development, and rapid increasing of gliadin mRNA and proteins occurred at 15-20 DPA. In addition, genome-specific variations of CD-toxic epitopes among Aegilops and Triticum genomes were found. The A genome and its related progenitor genomes A(u) and A(m) had fewer CD epitopes than other genomes, suggesting that these genomes might be valuable gene resources to remove CD toxic peptides for wheat quality improvement.},

   abstract = {Wheat supplies about 20% of the total food calories consumed worldwide and is a national staple in many countries. Besides being a key source of plant proteins, it is also a major cause of many diet-induced health issues, especially celiac disease. The only effective treatment for this disease is a total gluten-free diet. The present report describes an effort to develop a natural dietary therapy for this disorder by transcriptional suppression of wheat DEMETER (DME) homeologs using RNA interference. DME encodes a 5-methylcytosine DNA glycosylase responsible for transcriptional derepression of gliadins and low-molecular-weight glutenins (LMWgs) by active demethylation of their promoters in the wheat endosperm. Previous research has demonstrated these proteins to be the major source of immunogenic epitopes. In this research, barley and wheat DME genes were cloned and localized on the syntenous chromosomes. Nucleotide diversity among DME homeologs was studied and used for their virtual transcript profiling. Functional conservation of DME enzyme was confirmed by comparing the motif and domain structure within and across the plant kingdom. Presence and absence of CpG islands in prolamin gene sequences was studied as a hallmark of hypo- and hypermethylation, respectively. Finally the epigenetic influence of DME silencing on accumulation of LMWgs and gliadins was studied using 20 transformants expressing hairpin RNA in their endosperm. These transformants showed up to 85.6% suppression in DME transcript abundance and up to 76.4% reduction in the amount of immunogenic prolamins, demonstrating the possibility of developing wheat varieties compatible for the celiac patients.},

Evidence-based supportive treatments exist to maximize quality of life for any patient, whether receiving chemotherapy or not. This article provides a comprehensive review of symptoms with current treatment recommendations and directions for future development. Celiac plexus neurolysis improves pain in the majority of patients with APC and should be moved earlier in the analgesic paradigm. Malignant bowel obstruction can be palliated quickly with optimal management via gastric decompression, octreotide, parenteral opioids, and standing antiemetics. Recommendations are provided for best treatment of malignant gastroparesis, gastric outlet obstruction, and chemotherapy-induced nausea and vomiting in this population. Malignant ascites can be treated initially with diuretics and sodium-restriction in patients with an exudative process; however, an indwelling catheter is recommended for patients with recurrent ascites, particularly because of carcinomatosis or a refractory process. With exocrine insufficiency contributing to weight loss, pancreatic enzyme replacement is essential to improve nourishment in the majority of patients. Presently, megestrol acetate is the only U.S. Food and Drug Administration (FDA)-approved therapy for the anorexia-cachexia syndrome, although future developments are promising. Finally, patients with advanced pancreatic cancer should be screened and treated early for depression as a common comorbid diagnosis. Early palliative care consultation also helps address the existential and psychosocial concerns of patients facing death from pancreatic cancer in a holistic manner.},

   abstract = {Celiac disease (CD) is an inflammatory disease of the upper small intestine in genetically predisposed individuals caused by glutamine- and proline-rich peptides from cereal storage proteins (gluten) with a minimal length of nine amino acids. Such peptides are insufficiently degraded by gastrointestinal enzymes; they permeate the lymphatic tissue, are bound to celiac-specific, antigen-presenting cells, and stimulate intestinal T-cells. The typical clinical pattern is a flat small intestinal mucosa and malabsorption. Currently, the only therapy is a strict, lifelong gluten-free diet. Recent research has shown that gluten and gluten peptides can be degraded by prolyl endopeptidases from different sources. These peptidases can either be used to produce gluten-free foods from gluten-containing raw materials, or they have been suggested as an oral therapy for CD, in which dietary gluten is hydrolyzed by coingested peptidases already in the stomach, thus preventing CD-specific immune reactions in the small intestine. This would be an alternative for CD patients to the gluten-free diet. Furthermore, microbial transglutaminase could be used to detoxify gluten either by selectively modifying glutamine residues of intact gluten by transamidation with lysine methyl ester or by crosslinking gluten peptides in beverages via isopeptide bonds so that they can be removed by filtration.},

METHODS: A total of 58 paragonimiasis patients were reviewed. They were 42 boys and 16 girls aged 2.0 to 15.3 years. FINDINGS: Among these patients, 20 were diagnosed in the recent 5 years, 46 with a history of raw water or food ingestion. Except 2 patients without any complaint, the most common features involved the systemic (41, 70.7%) and respiratory systems (43, 74.1%), followed by abdominal, cardiac and nervous systems, with rash and mass. Eosinophilia was noted in 46 (79.3%) patients, granulocytosis in 45 (77.6%), anemia in 14 (24.1%), and thrombocytopenia in 3. Imageology showed pneumonia in 26 (44.8%) patients, pleurisy in 28 (48.3%), hydropericardium in 17 (29.3%), ascites in 16 (27.6%), and celiac lymphadenitis in 13 (22.4%). Besides hepatomegaly and splenomegaly, calcification and multiple lamellar low echogenic areas in the liver were noted, each in one patient. Abnormal brain imaging was noted in 4 of 10 patients. Karyocyte hyperplasia with eosinophilia was noted in all the 19 patients who received bone marrow puncture. CONCLUSION: Paragonimiasis should be considered in the differential diagnosis of patients with multiple organs or system lesions, especially those with eosinophilia, serous cavity effusion, respiratory, cardiac, digestive system, nervous system abnormality, and/or mass. Healthy eating habit is helpful for paragonimiasis prevention.},

   abstract = {The demand for gluten-free bread is growing as the recognition of celiac disease and wheat allergy has increased worldwide. In our previous study, reduced glutathione (GSH) was found to improve the gas-retaining properties of rice batter used for gluten-free bread. In this article, oxidized glutathione (GSSG) was shown to have the same effect. Moreover, sensory tests revealed that GSSG bread had a significantly reduced sulfurous odor. Analyses by a gas chromatography-flame photometric detector demonstrated the presence of hydrogen sulfide and methyl mercaptan in the headspace of GSH bread, and also their significant reduction in GSSG bread. The viscoelastic properties and microstructures of GSSG and GSH bread did not noticeably differ. These observations suggest the usefulness of GSSG in making gluten-free rice bread and extend our knowledge of the use of glutathione in food processing. Practical Application: Glutathione, a widely-distributed peptide in cells, improves the bread-making quality of gluten-free rice batter. While both the reduced (GSH) and oxidized (GSSG) glutathione are effective, GSSG-bread has significantly reduced sulfurous odor compared to GSH-bread.},

After several major surgeries, food allergies were determined by serum immunoglobulin E testing, and when he finally went on a gluten-free diet, he stopped forming calculi and has had no surgeries related to kidney calculi since. Hyperoxaluria was not identified in this child by 24-hour urine analysis, unlike most other reports of kidney calculus formation in individuals with gluten intolerance.},

The study was divided into five steps: preparation/selection, chemical, sensory, technological, and statistical analysis. The modified sample presented greater acceptance (84.5% for celiac individuals and 61.2% for nonceliac) than standard samples (53.6% for nonceliac individuals). There was no significant difference between the modified and the standard samples in terms of appearance, aroma, flavor, and overall quality. The modified pastas presented approximately 98% less lipids. Green bananas are considered a subproduct of low commercial value with little industrial use. The possibility of developing gluten-free products with green banana flour can expand the product supply for people with celiac disease and contribute to a more diverse diet.},

Currently, the only therapy able to normalize the clinical and histological manifestation of the disease is a strict and life-long gluten-free (GF) diet. The replacement of gluten presents a significant technological challenge, as it is an essential structure-building protein, which is necessary for formulating high-quality baked goods. The objective of this paper is to review some basics about CD, its current prevalence, and the recent advances in the preparation of high-quality GF breads using GF flours, starches, hydrocolloids, gums, and novel functional ingredients and technologies.},

   abstract = {A gluten-free (GF) diet is recognised as being the only accepted treatment for celiac disease-a permanent autoimmune enteropathy triggered by the ingestion of gluten-containing cereals. The bakery products available in today's gluten-free market are characterised by lower palatability than their conventional counterparts and may lead to nutritional deficiencies of vitamins, minerals and fibre. Thus, the production of high-quality gluten-free products has become a very important socioeconomical issue. Microbial fermentation by means of lactic acid bacteria and yeast is one of the most ecological/economical methods of producing and preserving food. In this review, the role of a fermentation process for improving the quality of GF products and for developing a new concept of GF products with nutraceutical and health-promoting characteristics will be examined.},

   abstract = {OBJECTIVE: Strict adherence to a gluten-free diet is the only treatment for coeliac disease. The gluten-free diet is complex, costly and impacts on all activities involving food, making it difficult to maintain for a lifetime. The purpose of this cross-sectional study was to evaluate the difficulties experienced, the strategies used and the emotional impact of following a gluten-free diet among Canadians with coeliac disease. METHODS: A questionnaire was mailed to all members (n = 10 693) of both the Canadian Celiac Association and the Fondation quebecoise de la maladie coeliaque in 2008. RESULTS: The overall response rate was 72%. Results are presented for the 5912 respondents (>/=18 years) reporting biopsy-confirmed coeliac disease and/or dermatitis herpetiformis. Two-thirds never intentionally consumed gluten. Women reported significantly greater emotional responses to a gluten-free diet but, with time, were more accepting of it than men. Difficulties and negative emotions were experienced less frequently by those on the diet for >5 years, although food labelling and eating away from home remained very problematic. Frustration and isolation because of the diet were the most common negative emotions experienced. CONCLUSIONS: The present study quantifies the difficulties experienced, the strategies used and the emotional impact of following a gluten-free diet. It highlights the need to improve the training and education of dietitians, other health providers and the food service industry workers about coeliac disease and a gluten-free diet, with the aim of better helping individuals improve their adherence to a gluten-free diet and their quality of life.},

   abstract = {BACKGROUND: Celiac disease is an enteropathy triggered by dietary gluten found in wheat, barley, and rye. The current treatment is a strict gluten-free diet. Quinoa is a highly nutritive plant from the Andes, with low concentrations of prolamins, that has been recommended as part of a gluten-free diet; however, few experimental data support this recommendation. OBJECTIVE: We aimed to determine the amount of celiac-toxic prolamin epitopes in quinoa cultivars from different regions of the Andes and the ability of these epitopes to activate immune responses in patients with celiac disease. DESIGN: The concentration of celiac-toxic epitopes was measured by using murine monoclonal antibodies against gliadin and high-molecular-weight glutenin subunits. Immune response was assessed by proliferation assays of celiac small intestinal T cells/interferon-gamma (IFN-gamma) and production of IFN-gamma/IL-15 after organ culture of celiac duodenal biopsy samples. RESULTS: Fifteen quinoa cultivars were tested: 4 cultivars had quantifiable concentrations of celiac-toxic epitopes, but they were below the maximum permitted for a gluten-free food. Cultivars Ayacuchana and Pasankalla stimulated T cell lines at levels similar to those for gliadin and caused secretion of cytokines from cultured biopsy samples at levels comparable with those for gliadin. CONCLUSIONS: Most quinoa cultivars do not possess quantifiable amounts of celiac-toxic epitopes. However, 2 cultivars had celiac-toxic epitopes that could activate the adaptive and innate immune responses in some patients with celiac disease. These findings require further investigation in the form of in vivo studies, because quinoa is an important source of nutrients for patients with celiac disease.},

   abstract = {BACKGROUND: Celiac disease (CD) is a chronic gluten-sensitive enteropathy. Life-long gluten-free diet (GFD) is the only therapeutic option; however, it may contribute to the consumption of an unbalanced diet. The present study aimed to evaluate the dietary intake of CD affected children on a GFD and compare it with non-celiac children and with Italian nutritional intakes recommendations, as well as evaluate the contribution of commercially available gluten-free products (GFPs). METHODS: Eighteen celiac children, median age 7.6 years, median GFD duration 4.2 years, and 18 non-celiac controls, were enrolled in a cross-sectional age-matched study. Dietary intakes of both groups were collected using a food frequency questionnaire and a 24-hour dietary recall. Nutritional intakes were compared between the group and controls and with Italian dietary reference values. The contribution of GFPs to energy and macronutrient intakes was evaluated. RESULTS: Median energy intake was significantly higher in CD patients than in controls (8961.8 and 5761.0 kJ day(-1); P < 0.001). CD subjects showed higher carbohydrate intakes and lower fat intakes compared to controls. Protein-derived energy did not differ. By contrast to control subjects, energy derived from carbohydrate intakes in CD children met the Italian recommendations. Both children groups showed higher protein and fat intakes than recommended in Italy. GFPs consumption accounted for 36.3% of daily total energy intake. CONCLUSIONS: Intakes of simple sugars, fats and protein exceeded the National recommendations for health. Children with CD had significantly higher energy intakes than controls, although body mass index was comparable across the groups. Lack of nutritional information for GFPs prevented complete dietary analysis of subfractions of fat and micronutrient intakes. This aspect need to be addressed if studies in this field are to be meaningful in the future.},
