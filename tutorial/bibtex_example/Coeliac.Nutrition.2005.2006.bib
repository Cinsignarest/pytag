   abstract = {OBJECTIVES: The conformation of tissue transglutaminase might influence the performance of immunoassays to detect autoantibodies from patients with celiac disease. The present study investigated how the exposure of tissue transglutaminase kept in a liquid phase and fixed to a solid support affected the binding of immunoglobulin (Ig)A and IgG autoantibodies in children with untreated and treated celiac disease. METHODS: Included were 73 untreated celiac disease children, 50 controls and 80 children with treated celiac disease. IgA and IgG antitissue transglutaminase were measured with solid phase enzyme-linked immunoassay (ELISA) and liquid phase radioligand binding assays. For IgG antitissue transglutaminase detection with radioligand binding assays antihuman IgG and protein A were used. IgA endomysial autoantibodies were measured by indirect immunofluorescence. RESULTS: Both ELISA and radioligand binding assays detected IgA antitissue transglutaminase in 65 of 73 untreated celiac disease children and in 2 of 50 controls. One additional control child was detected with radioligand binding assays. Endomysial autoantibodies were present in 62 of 73 celiac disease children and in 2 of 50 controls. IgG antitissue transglutaminase was detected with both ELISA and radioligand binding assays in 40 of 73 untreated celiac disease children and in 2 of 50 controls. Radioligand binding assays using protein A detected 20 of 73 additional untreated celiac disease children and one control child with increased IgG antitissue transglutaminase. In treated celiac disease children, 21 of 80 were IgA antitissue transglutaminase positive with radioligand binding assays, 3 of 80 with ELISA, whereas none had endomysial autoantibodies. CONCLUSIONS: No qualitative differences between radioligand binding assays and ELISA in IgA or IgG antitissue transglutaminase binding from untreated celiac disease children was demonstrated. However, discrepancies in the binding of IgA antitissue transglutaminase from a subgroup of treated celiac disease children indicated that alterations of tissue transglutaminase might occur on fixation of the antigen. Protein A used for radioligand binding assays seemed not to assess IgG autoantibodies exclusively. IgA antitissue transglutaminase detection in screening of childhood celiac disease can be performed either by ELISA or radioligand binding assays because the two assays are interchangeable.},

   abstract = {Autoimmune enteropathy (AIE) is a relatively rare condition found most frequently in children. It presents with persistent watery diarrhea and malabsorption and may require total parenteral nutrition for nutritional support. Rare cases have been reported in adults. On histology, the small intestinal villi are flattened but lack the intraepithelial lymphocytosis of celiac disease. In children and rarely in adults, some cases are linked to the IPEX syndrome (Immune dysregulation, Polyendocrinopathy, Enteropathy, X-linked inheritance). We report a 21-year-old man who presented with chronic persistent diarrhea for 4 years. The duodenal biopsies showed villous blunting, chronic inflammation, and decreased to absent goblet cells, Paneth cells, and endocrine cells by histology and electron microscopy. These changes are consistent with an AIE with involvement of non-enterocyte populations. Pathologists must be aware of the possibility of AIE in adults and consider it in the differential diagnosis of duodenitis, intraepithelial lymphocytosis, and small bowel villous flattening.},

The recognition of atypical clinical presentations by active screening of high risk groups is a successful global initiative. In Chile there is little awareness of the enormous changes occurred in this field. Available national information on typical presentation of the disease shows that it is found in 1:1836 live births, figure that is comparable to European societies. Two urgent tasks are required in our country. First, to asses the Chilean population using EMA and/or TTG. Second, to improve the legal aspects that regulate consumer information about gluten content in processed foods. We here review the most relevant aspects to be considered to improve the management of celiac patients and the tasks that require the participation of health authorities for their implementation.},

   abstract = {OBJECTIVES: Enterocyte apoptosis induced by activated intraepithelial lymphocytes (IELs) is increased in celiac disease (CD). A lesser increment in intraepithelial lymphocytes associated with normal villous structure is also characteristic of cow's milk sensitive enteropathy (CMSE), but no information is available about the apoptosis rate of this condition. METHODS: Endoscopic biopsy samples of 21 children with untreated CMSE were compared with samples from 15 children with CD and 18 controls. Apoptosis was analyzed using the TUNEL technique and the M30 antibody from duodenal bulb and mid-duodenum samples. Ki-67 was used to detect the proliferation rate and CD3(+) to count the overall number of T lymphocytes. RESULTS: In the mid-duodenum, CMSE patients showed a significantly increased intraepithelial and lamina propria density of TUNEL(+) cells, but no difference in the density of M30(+) epithelial cells was seen compared with controls. In CD subjects, TUNEL(+) counts in mid-duodenal villous epithelium were increased. CD3(+) intraepithelial lymphocytes were increased in both CMSE and CD and correlated with TUNEL(+) and M30(+) counts among all patients. No increase in proliferation rate was seen in CMSE, and no significant correlations between apoptosis and proliferation rates were detected. CONCLUSIONS: The observed increase in TUNEL(+) counts and the absence of any increase in M30(+) cells suggest that the apoptosis rate of intraepithelial lymphocytes, but not of enterocytes, is increased in the small IELs in CMSE. However, the number of intraepithelial lymphocytes is still elevated in CMSE, indicating that a disturbance of homeostasis of intraepithelial lymphocytes is important in its pathogenesis.},

MATERIAL AND METHODS: Data were obtained on biopsy-proven adult patients with celiac disease from a database of patients seen between 1981 and 2001 in a University-based referral center. Z scores were calculated to adjust for age, ethnicity and gender using the National Health and Nutrition Examination Survey database as controls. RESULTS: The cohort consisted of 323 patients (211 F, 112 M). Men had a shorter duration of symptoms than women (p=0.006). There was no gender difference in the age at diagnosis or mode of presentation. Body mass index (BMI), mean hemoglobin and ferritin values were lower in women than in men, but the Z scores for these values were not significantly different, indicating that the differences are physiological. All lipid values were low (negative Z scores). Men had lower total cholesterol (162.0+/-46.5mg/dl) compared to women (181.0+/-40.0mg/dl), p=0.02 and lower Z scores (-1.10+/-1.1) compared to women (-0.71+/-0.9), p=0.04. Men had lower bone density T scores at the radius (p=0.07). Autoimmune diseases were present in 30.7% with a female to male ratio of 1:1, compared to the general population in which 3.2% have autoimmune diseases with a female predominance. CONCLUSIONS: Most gender differences in celiac disease are physiological. However, men have indirect evidence of greater malabsorption than females and have female-predominant associated diseases when they present with celiac disease.},

The prevalence of CD among Brazilian children with DM1 is not known. This study was conducted to determine the prevalence of CD in Brazilian children and adolescents with DM 1. METHODS: One hundred and four children and adolescents with DM 1 (52 males and 52 females; age range 22 months - 19 years) and 105 age and gender-matched control participants were screened for CD using the IgA anti-endomysial antibody test (IgA-EmA) and total serum IgA. A small bowel biopsy was performed in all patients with positive IgA-EmA. RESULTS: Nine of 104 diabetic patients (8.7%) had a positive IgA-EmA. Biopsies were normal in four patients, two had partial or subtotal villous atrophy with elevated intraepithelial lymphocyte (IEL) counts, and three showed partial villous atrophy but with IEL counts under the maximum limit adopted (40 IEL/100 enterocytes). EmA-IgA positive patients had mild, non-specific gastrointestinal complaints including dyspepsia, abdominal pain, flatulence and constipation. All control participants had negative results for IgA-EmA. CONCLUSION: The prevalence of CD in a group of Brazilian pediatric DM 1 patients was at least 4.8%, a prevalence comparable to European and North American studies. The high prevalence of CD among DM 1 emphasizes the need for routine screening in all countries including Brazil.},

   abstract = {OBJECTIVES: Anti-tissue transglutaminase antibody (anti-tTG) determination using second-generation (human antigen) enzyme-linked immunoassays (ELISAs) is a very accurate test to diagnose celiac disease (CD). In this study, we compared 2 second-generation ELISAs (Celikey tTG; Pharmacia Diagnostics GmbH & Co, Freiburg, Germany, and QuantaLite; Inova Diagnostics, San Diego, CA) and antiendomysial antibodies (EMAs) with a new indirect chemiluminescence immunoassay (LIAISON tTG; DiaSorin S.p.A., Saluggia, Italy) in diagnosing and monitoring CD in children. PATIENTS AND METHODS: Antiendomysial antibodies, anti-tTGs and total immunoglobulin A were measured in the sera of 103 control children, 101 children with histologically proven CD and 31 CD children on gluten-free diet (GFD). RESULTS: Anti-tissue transglutaminase antibody mean levels were significantly higher in CD with respect to control or GFD children. The sensitivity value of EMAs, LIAISON tTG, Celikey tTG and QuantaLite in diagnosing CD was 97.7%, 97.0%, 94.1% and 98.0%, respectively, and the corresponding specificity values were 91.1%, 98.1%, 97.1% and 96.1%, respectively. The degree of mucosal destruction (Marsh criteria) was correlated with EMA semiquantification (P < 0.01) and with the circulating levels of anti-tTGs measured using LIAISON (P < 0.05) or QuantaLite (P < 0.01). Twenty-six CD children were followed up from 5 to 25 months after GFD. The circulating levels of anti-tTGs measured with any of the 3 assays significantly dropped after GFD. CONCLUSIONS: Anti-tissue transglutaminase antibody determination with second-generation ELISAs is as effective as EMAs for CD diagnosis. The novel chemiluminescent method described in the present paper for the detection of anti-tTGs in the diagnosis of CD had the highest sensitivity and specificity values. The anti-tTG test correlates with the degree of mucosal destruction and is suitable for verifying patient compliance to dietary treatment.},

   abstract = {OBJECTIVES: In developed countries, small bowel histology in coeliac disease is a spectrum, ranging from normal with increased intraepithelial lymphocytes to the classic flat mucosa. In developing countries, mild to moderate enteropathies in children with chronic diarrhea and growth failure are assumed to be caused by tropical sprue, persistent infections, or malnutrition with bacterial overgrowth. We report the prevalence and histology of coeliac disease in children with chronic diarrhea at a tertiary referral hospital in North India. METHODS: Two hundred fifty-nine children with symptoms indicating coeliac disease attended the All India Institute of Medical Sciences. Histology was graded after a modified Marsh classification. Serum immunoglobulin A anti-endomysial antibodies (AEA) were assayed using indirect immunofluorescence. Subjects with abnormal histology and positive AEA were put on a gluten free diet (GFD). Coeliac disease was diagnosed on small intestinal biopsy changes and a clinical response to a GFD. RESULTS: Severe enteropathies were present in 63 (24%) subjects, and 58 (92%) responded to a GFD. Sixty-six (25%) had moderate histologic changes, 61 responding to a GFD. AEA was positive in 56 of 63 patients with severe and 65 of 66 with moderate enteropathies. Fifty-seven children had mild enteropathies, and 19 of 20 with positive AEA responded clinically to a GFD. CONCLUSIONS: Coeliac disease is more common than previously believed. It presents a variable histology, and diagnoses may be missed or delayed if based only on severe enteropathies. Serology is a useful adjunct to diagnosis, and diagnostic criteria need to be developed appropriately for coeliac disease in developing countries despite limited facilities.},

   abstract = {OBJECTIVES: The prevalence of celiac disease (CD) among the relatives and the complications of an undiagnosed CD prompted us to identify a useful disease screening strategy. METHODS: We studied 441 first degree relatives of 208 CD patients by immunoglobulin (Ig)A antiendomysium antibodies (EMA) and radioimmunoprecipitation assay (RIA) IgA antitransglutaminase autoantibodies (TGAA). Of these, 364 were typed for human leukocyte antigen-DRB1, -DQA1, and -DQB1 genes by the polymerase chain reaction sequence specific primers method. It was suggested to the autoantibody-positive subjects that they should undergo intestinal biopsy. RESULTS: TGAA were positive in 46 of 439 relatives, EMA in 38; intestinal lesions related to CD were present in 40 subjects. We also found two immunodeficient fathers with duodenal villous atrophy. In three serology-positive subjects, permission for intestinal biopsy was refused; for another three serology-positive cases, duodenal mucosa was normal. Thus, the strict CD prevalence resulted 9.5%, the enlarged prevalence 10.9%. The DQ2/DQ8 heterodimers were carried in 231 of 364 subjects and in 38 of 40 biopsy-proven celiac patients. Three DQ2-positive parents became positive to the serology during a long-lasting follow-up. CONCLUSIONS: On the basis of a carefully conducted study, CD prevalence in our series was seen as very high. These data suggest an accurate algorithm to select candidates for intestinal biopsy among CD high-risk subjects. First, an evaluation of the sensitive RIA TGAA and of total IgA (in IgA deficiency RIA IgG anti-tissue transglutaminase assay) should be performed. Then, an evaluation of the TGAA and the genetic study would be advisable 2 to 3 years later in negative subjects. Those carrying the DQ2/DQ8 heterodimers should continue the serologic follow-up; the others need a clinical follow-up.},

   abstract = {OBJECTIVE: Antiendomysial antibody (EMA) production has been induced in vitro by the small bowel mucosa of celiac disease (CD) patients in clinical remission cultured in the presence of gliadin peptides. The aim of the present study was to use this in vitro system to determine whether it could be used to predict the clinical or histologic relapse to gluten challenge in CD children on a gluten-free diet (GFD). METHODS: Enrolled were 32 CD children and adolescents on GFD (group 1), and 80 controls (group 2) who underwent in vitro gliadin challenge. Subsequently, 24 group 1 CD children underwent in vivo gluten challenge to confirm the diagnosis. Biopsy cultures, with and without gliadin, morphometric analysis, immunoglobulin (Ig)A and IgG1 EMA detection, both in sera and culture supernatants, were performed. RESULTS: Of the 32 group 1 CD patients, 23 were IgA EMA positive in culture supernatants. The other nine were IgG1 EMA positive. All 24 children who had in vivo gluten challenge showed clinical or histologic relapse. All culture supernatants from disease controls belonging to group 2 were both IgA and IgG1 EMA negative, irrespective of gliadin challenge. CONCLUSIONS: Organ culture with in vitro gliadin challenge is able to reproduce the results of in vivo challenge. This system could reduce the need for gluten challenge in celiac children.},

   abstract = {OBJECTIVE: Type1 diabetes mellitus may be associated with celiac disease. The prevalence of celiac disease as determined by screening among adult patients with type 1 diabetes is high with rates of 1.07.8% in Europe and U.S.A. The aims of the study are to determine the prevalence of celiac disease in adults with type 1 diabetes in Tunisia. METHODS: 348 consecutive adult patients with type1 diabetes were investigated prospectively and screened for celiac disease. The mean age was 28.45+/-10.74 years old. There were 176 females and 172 males. For the screening of celiac disease, we used immunoglobulin A (IgA) anti-endomysium (EMA) antibodies determined by an indirect immunofluorescence method. Anti-transglutaminase (tTG) antibodies were determined by an ELISA method. Those patients with positive results for anti EMA and or tTG were proposed for duodenal biopsy. RESULTS: 14 patients were positive for anti EMA and had high or a weak positive level of tTG antibodies. One patient from this group was already known to have celiac disease. Only 8 patients consented to biopsy and morphological changes were consistent with celiac disease in all cases. Prevalence of biopsy-proven celiac disease was 2.3% (95% CI=1.0-4.5%). CONCLUSION: The present study confirms that celiac disease of adults is prevalent in type 1 diabetic patients in Tunisia. Serological screening for celiac disease in type 1 diabetes is important because many patients are asymptomatic and most are detected by the screening.},

   abstract = {BACKGROUND: Mesenteric stenting has not been widely adopted for the treatment of chronic mesenteric ischemia (CMI). The recent availability of embolic protection and low-profile devices with the theoretical ability to decrease perioperative bowel necrosis, led us to begin using mesenteric stenting for patients with CMI. We review our initial experience to examine short-term outcomes. METHODS: We performed a retrospective analysis of all patients who were treated by vascular surgeons with mesenteric stenting for CMI. Patients with acute mesenteric ischemia were excluded. We evaluated perioperative morbidity and mortality, restenosis, recurrent symptoms, and reintervention. Kaplan-Meier methods were used to assess events during follow-up. We also compared these outcomes with a historical control group of patients treated with open surgical revascularization. RESULTS: Fourteen patients underwent mesenteric stenting over the past 3 years. Mean age was 73, and 64% were women. There was no perioperative or 30-day mortality or major morbidity. Early restenosis and recurrent symptoms occurred in 10% and 9% of patients at 6 months. At a mean follow-up of 13 months, 53% of patients underwent reintervention. However, 93% were symptom-free at their last follow-up. Compared with open surgery, stent patients had lower perioperative major morbidity (30% vs 0%, P < .01) and shorter hospital and intensive care unit length of stay (median 10 days vs 2 days, and 3 days vs 0 days, respectively, P < .01 for both). However, stent patients were seven times as likely to develop restenosis (P < .01), four times more likely to develop recurrent symptoms (P < .01), and 15 times more likely to undergo reintervention (P < .01). There was one death 13 months after stenting due to mesenteric infarction in a patient lost to follow-up. One patient was successfully converted to open surgery after a second restenosis. He had regained 20 pounds and was determined to be a better operative candidate than at his initial presentation. There was no perioperative or 30-day mortality or major morbidity with reintervention after mesenteric stenting. CONCLUSION: Mesenteric stenting for CMI can be performed with low perioperative risk. However, stenting is associated with early restenosis and recurrent symptoms requiring secondary procedures. Patients with severe nutritional depletion or high surgical risk may benefit from mesenteric stenting for CMI, but close follow-up is required. Later open surgery can be performed for restenosis if nutritional status and surgical risk are improved, or repeat angioplasty and stenting can be effectively performed if operative risk remains high.},

METHODS AND RESULTS: Determination in 400 Type 1 diabetic patients of serum anti-endomysial and/or anti-transglutaminase auto-antibodies. All subjects with abnormal serology underwent an intestinal biopsy. Ten patients (2.5%) had positive antibodies. Diagnosis of CD was confirmed by an intestinal biopsy. Eight patients were symptom-free, although laboratory findings suggesting malabsorption were prominent in the presence of CD [microcytic anaemia, iron and folate deficiencies, low levels of 25(OH)vitamin D3, calcium and cholesterol]. Other auto-immune conditions, especially vitiligo, were found in patients with CD. CONCLUSIONS: Asymptomatic coeliac disease occurs frequently in adult Type 1 diabetic patients, and is often associated with subclinical malabsorption. Screening should be part of routine evaluation, to implement life-long dietary gluten avoidance.},

This article reviews (1) the impact of the GFD on the quality of life of individuals with CD and their families; (2) the causes of poorly controlled CD; (3) the access to and source and quality of information provided by health professionals and other groups; (4) management strategies, including nutritional assessment and education guidelines; (5) a variety of resources available to individuals and health professionals; (6) innovative educational initiatives and partnerships; and (7) specific recommendations to address the increasing numbers of people with CD and the growing need for gluten-free (GF) foods and further education about CD and the GFD. Successful management of CD requires a team approach, including the person with CD and his or her family, physician, dietitian, and celiac support group; an individualized approach; understanding of quality of life issues; use of evidence-based, current information and resources; and regular follow-up to monitor compliance, nutritional status, and additional information and support. The physician must clearly communicate, with a positive attitude, an overview of CD and strongly emphasize the importance of a GFD for life. It is essential that the physician initiate an immediate referral to a dietitian with expertise in CD for nutritional assessment, diet education, meal planning, and assistance with the adaptation to the challenging new gluten-free lifestyle. Good dietary compliance will reduce the risk of further complications and associated health care costs and improve quality of life in patients with CD.},

It is thought that celiac disease is the result of an inappropriate T cell-mediated immune response against ingested gluten protein. The characteristic lesion of the small intestinal mucosa includes loss of absorptive villi and infiltration of the lamina propria with inflammatory cells. The clinical presentation of celiac disease varies greatly depending on patient's age, duration and extent of the disease, and the presence of extraintestinal manifestations. Unfortunately, most patients with celiac disease have either silent or atypical presentations, thus escaping diagnosis for several years. Medical nutrition therapy with lifelong adherence to a strict gluten-free diet is the only accepted treatment of celiac disease. Individuals at risk for this entity should undergo appropriate serologic testing, but there is no evidence to support mass screening.},

The main technological problem in the production of GFB is obtaining a gluten substitute that is both inexpensive and capable of retaining gas during bread fermentation and baking. The use of gelatinized starch as an alternative for gluten seems promising. In this project, rice bread was made using pregelatinized extruded rice flour as a gluten substitute. Pre-gelatinized rice flours (PRF) were manufactured in a single screw Brabender extruder, varying extrusion temperature (108-192 degrees C) and the moisture of the raw material (19.2 - 24.8%), and were used in a proportion of 10 g for every 100 g of raw rice flour, in the production of gluten-free bread. Results showed that rice flour extruded at a high temperature (180 degrees) and low moisture content (20%), rendered bread with the best technological characteristics, presenting crust and crumb color similar to those of conventional wheat bread, although with volume and texture not as satisfactory in the same comparison.},

   abstract = {Population screening studies have identified that up to two thirds of celiac disease (CD) cases are asymptomatic. The aim of this study was to conduct a systematic review of the expected consequences of testing for CD in the following populations: (1) patients with symptoms suggestive of CD, (2) asymptomatic at-risk populations, and (3) general population. Standard systematic review methodology was used. A comprehensive literature search was conducted in MEDLINE (1996-2003), EMBASE (1974-2003), CAB (1972 forward), PsychINFO (1840-2003), AGRICOLA (1970-2003), and Sociological Abstracts (1963 forward); searches were conducted in December 2003. Pooled summary estimates were not calculated. The majority of the included studies were before-after studies, case control, or retrospective cohorts. The quality of evidence for the before-after studies is weaker. The overall strength of the evidence for this issue was fair to good. This area of research is relatively new, and further high-quality studies are required. The consequences of testing for celiac disease in symptomatic individuals appears to have a positive impact on patient-relevant outcomes. The data are less clear for those with silent CD or those with lower grade histologic lesions in small bowel biopsy. The literature suggests that compliance is less than ideal in these individuals, especially if diagnosed when adults. Long-term outcomes have not been extensively studied in those with silent CD.},

The aim of the present investigation was primarily to evaluate differences in serum concentrations of total carnitine between IDCM patients and patients with IDCM associated with CD and then also to evaluate, in the latter, the effect of a gluten-free diet on serum concentrations of total carnitine. METHOD AND RESULTS: Serum carnitine was determined by enzymatic spectrophotometric assay in three groups of individuals: group A, 10 patients (5 males, 5 females), mean age 46.5+/-10.8 years, presenting isolated IDCM; group B, 3 patients (2 males, 1 female), mean age 34+/-8 years, with IDCM+CD; and group C, 10 healthy subjects (5 males, 5 females), mean age 38.6+/-11.1 years. All patients with IDCM belonged to class NYHA I-II. Mean concentrations of total serum carnitine in the group of patients with isolated IDCM (group A) were found to be lower than in the controls (group C). The concentrations in patients with IDCM associated with CD (group B) were lower than in the control group and also lower than in the isolated IDCM (group A). After 2 years on a gluten-free diet, patients presenting IDCM associated with CD showed a progressive increase in mean serum carnitine levels compared to values observed prior to the diet. CONCLUSIONS: Patients presenting IDCM associated with CD show a greater decrease in serum total carnitine levels than patients presenting the isolated form of IDCM. A gluten-free diet, in these patients, leads to a progressive increase in serum levels of this substance.},

   abstract = {BACKGROUND: Push enteroscopy has not been compared to standard endoscopy in children. OBJECTIVE: The aim of this study was to determine the feasibility of push enteroscopy in children with suspected proximal small bowel disease, and to compare its diagnostic yield and safety with standard endoscopy. DESIGN/SETTING: Database review. PATIENTS: A database analysis was performed on all children who underwent push enteroscopy at The Johns Hopkins Children's Center from 2001 to 2005. Patient demographics, clinical history, and indication for push enteroscopy were all recorded. Clinical utility was qualified based on the influence of PE on therapy. MAIN OUTCOME MEASUREMENTS: Diagnostic yield and safety of push enteroscopy in children. RESULTS: Push enteroscopy was performed on 44 children (27 M; 17 F) with a median age (range) of 10 (2-18) years. The most common indications for push enteroscopy were suspected proximal small bowel disease based on radiological criteria (21), and bleeding (9). Push enteroscopy confirmed the diagnosis of proximal small bowel Crohn's disease (CD) in 23, polyps in 5, eosinophilic gastroenteritis in 4, celiac disease in 1, microvillous inclusion disease in 1, and lymphoproliferative disease in 1 patient. An isolated non-Crohn's related gastric (1) and jejunal ulcer (1) was also identified. Just 9 of these identifiable lesions were within reach by esophagogastroduodenoscopy (EGD). Seven patients had a normal push enteroscopy. The clinical management was modified in 34 patients. Push enteroscopy was not shown to significantly alter the time of procedure when compared to EGD. CONCLUSIONS: Push enteroscopy is a safe diagnostic tool with proven clinical utility in children with suspected proximal small bowel disease. Larger studies are needed to establish the widespread application of push enteroscopy in pediatrics.},

   abstract = {A small proportion of coeliac disease (CD) patients fail to improve after a gluten-free diet (GFD) and may be considered as atypical regarding their outcome (refractory coeliac disease). The aim of this study is to diagnose and manage patients with CD who fail to improve after a GFD. Refractory coeliac disease (RCD) is a malabsorption syndrome defined by persisting villous atrophy with, usually, an increase of intraepithelial lymphocytes (IELs) in the small bowel in spite of a strict GFD and comprises a heterogenous group of diseases. Some of these diseases have to be excluded and can be treated by specific therapies like antibiotics in tropical sprue and giardiasis and immune globulin substitution in common variable immunodeficiency, while other malabsorption syndromes are less well defined and may require immunosuppressive therapy. Standardized treatment, however, has not been evaluated in such patients so far. In a subgroup of patients with RCD, an abnormal intraepithelial lymphocyte (IEL) population may be observed with the lack of surface expression of usual T-cell markers (CD3-CD8 and/or the T-cell receptor (TCR)) on IELs associated with T-cell clonality pattern suggest the presence of an early enteropathy-associated T-cell lymphoma (EATL) in a subgroup of patients with RCD. This hypothesis has been supported by studies, which revealed progression into overt intestinal T-cell lymphomas in a subgroup of RCD. Steroid treatment has been reported effective even in patients with underlying early EATL. However, long-term results are unsatisfactory in most of these patients with RCD and parenteral nutrition has to be applied in some of these cases. First results with more aggressive chemotherapies and use of cytokines are under way. Due to the difficulty of diagnostic and therapeutic regimens patients should be referred to tertiary centres for coeliac disease.},

   abstract = {Cystic fibrosis (CF) was distinguished from celiac disease in 1938. Then, it was a pathologic diagnosis, life expectancy was approximately 6 months, and the autosomal recessive disease was believed to arise from abnormal mucus plugging exocrine ducts. Death often occurred from lung infection. Discovery of the sweat electrolyte defect in 1953 and standardization of the sweat test in 1959 allowed identification of milder cases, and CF was no longer considered only a disorder of mucus. In 1955, establishment of centers with programs of aggressive, comprehensive care initiated striking improvement in longevity. The pillars of care established then (attention to nutrition, airway clearance, treatment of lung infection) remain today. In 1983, chloride transport was identified as the basic physiologic CF defect, accompanied by increased sodium reabsorption. In 1980, we learned that inflammation contributes independently to lung disease and constitutes an independent therapeutic target. In 1989, the discovery of the CF gene demonstrated the basic defect to be in a cAMP-regulated chloride channel. This afforded new diagnostic tests, opportunities for research, and prospects for using the gene as therapy. Since then, substantial advances in basic and clinical research catalyzed therapeutic improvements: median survival age now exceeds 30 years. The Cystic Fibrosis Foundation center network provides not only opportunity to conduct clinical trials but also means to disseminate new therapies. In the future, treatments directed at the basic defect can be expected, with concomitant improvements in morbidity and mortality.},

   abstract = {BACKGROUND: Liver involvement represents an extra-intestinal feature of celiac disease (CD) and shows a clinical spectrum varying from nonspecific reactive hepatitis to cirrhosis. Here we report the association of cirrhosis with CD in 5 children. PATIENTS AND METHODS: The mean age of the patients was 9.4 +/- 2.8 years. Viral, metabolic, and autoimmune etiology of liver disease was ruled out. Intestinal and liver biopsies were performed to confirm the histologic diagnosis in all subjects. RESULTS: Three of the patients had chronic diarrhea and hepatosplenomegaly in whom diagnoses of CD and cirrhosis were established at presentation simultaneously. In the other 2 patients, CD was diagnosed following an initial diagnosis of cirrhosis. At diagnosis, alanine aminotransferase (range, 64-271 IU/L) and aspartate aminotransferase (range, 90-225 IU/L) values were elevated. After 1 to 5 years of a gluten-free diet (GFD), normalization of serum aminotransferase levels and clinical improvement were observed in 3 patients with strict GFD. The other 2 patients without improvement of the liver disease had poor dietary compliance. CONCLUSION: CD may be associated with severe hepatic damage in children and strict GFD may have beneficial effect on the course of liver disease. Serologic screening of CD should be included in differential diagnosis of chronic liver disease of unknown origin.},

   abstract = {OBJECTIVES: The ability of the gliadin fraction of wheat gluten to exacerbate coeliac disease is well documented. We investigated the possible toxicity of high molecular weight glutenin subunits (HMW-GS) in coeliac disease in vitro using gluten-sensitive T cells, and in vivo with challenge studies in patient volunteers. METHODS: A mixture of four HMW-GS was chemically separated from wheat flour and checked for purity by HPLC, SDS-PAGE and ELISA. T-cell lines, grown up from small intestinal biopsies from coeliac patients (n=17), were tested for their reactivity to HMW-GS. Adults with coeliac disease and who were on a gluten-free diet (n=3) underwent in-vivo challenges with HMW-GS. Duodenal biopsies, taken prior to the challenge and at intervals up to 6 h afterwards, were assessed for morphology, intra-epithelial lymphocyte count, and interleukin 15 (IL-15) expression, by immunohistochemistry. RESULTS: T-cell lines from 11 of 17 patients were stimulated by HMW-GS. There was a significant change in small intestinal morphology 4 h after commencing infusions with HMW-GS in all three subjects. For example villus height to crypt depth ratios were reduced in the three patients from 3.0+/-0.5 to 1.29+/-0.2, 2.53+/-0.7 to 0.81+/-0.6 and 3.0+/-0.7 to 1.85+/-0.3, P<0.0001 in all cases. There was increased expression of IL-15 in the small intestine from 2 h after the HMW-GS challenges. CONCLUSION: Mixed HMW-GS stimulate T-cell lines from some coeliac patients and exacerbate coeliac disease in vivo, inducing expression, within 2 h, of IL-15. This suggests an innate immune response to these proteins.},

   abstract = {OBJECTIVES: Our goal was to evaluate the possible correspondence between antitissue transglutaminase of immunoglobulin A class levels and stage of mucosal damage in patients affected by celiac disease. In addition, we assessed clinical use of antitissue transglutaminase values to predict biopsy results. METHODS: One thousand eight hundred eighty-six consecutive patients with symptoms suggestive of celiac disease and 305 healthy controls underwent determination of serum levels of immunoglobulin A and antitissue transglutaminase. An intestinal biopsy was performed in subjects with antitissue transglutaminase levels > or = 4 IU/mL and in subjects with negative antitissue transglutaminase levels but with clinical suspicion of celiac disease. Histologic grading of celiac disease was consistent with the Marsh classification. RESULTS: One hundred eighty-six subjects with positive antitissue transglutaminase levels and 91 patients with negative antitissue transglutaminase levels were submitted to biopsy. In all healthy subjects, antitissue transglutaminase results were negative. Histologic evaluations in patients with positive antitissue transglutaminase levels gave the following results: type 0 in 25 patients, type 1 in 3 patients, type 2 in 4 patients, type 3a in 22 patients, type 3b in 74 patients, and type 3c in 58 patients. None of the patients with negative antitissue transglutaminase levels showed histologic findings suggestive of celiac disease. The mean antitissue transglutaminase values in patients without mucosal atrophy were significantly lower than in patients with mucosal atrophy. Antitissue transglutaminase values > or = 20 IU/mL were found in only 1 patient without mucosal atrophy. CONCLUSIONS: Our study found a strong correspondence between antitissue transglutaminase levels and stage of mucosal injury; antitissue transglutaminase values > 20 IU/mL seemed to be strongly predictive of mucosal atrophy.},

   abstract = {OBJECTIVE: Little is known about the interaction of gliadin with intestinal epithelial cells and the mechanism(s) through which gliadin crosses the intestinal epithelial barrier. We investigated whether gliadin has any immediate effect on zonulin release and signaling. MATERIAL AND METHODS: Both ex vivo human small intestines and intestinal cell monolayers were exposed to gliadin, and zonulin release and changes in paracellular permeability were monitored in the presence and absence of zonulin antagonism. Zonulin binding, cytoskeletal rearrangement, and zonula occludens-1 (ZO-1) redistribution were evaluated by immunofluorescence microscopy. Tight junction occludin and ZO-1 gene expression was evaluated by real-time polymerase chain reaction (PCR). RESULTS: When exposed to gliadin, zonulin receptor-positive IEC6 and Caco2 cells released zonulin in the cell medium with subsequent zonulin binding to the cell surface, rearrangement of the cell cytoskeleton, loss of occludin-ZO1 protein-protein interaction, and increased monolayer permeability. Pretreatment with the zonulin antagonist FZI/0 blocked these changes without affecting zonulin release. When exposed to luminal gliadin, intestinal biopsies from celiac patients in remission expressed a sustained luminal zonulin release and increase in intestinal permeability that was blocked by FZI/0 pretreatment. Conversely, biopsies from non-celiac patients demonstrated a limited, transient zonulin release which was paralleled by an increase in intestinal permeability that never reached the level of permeability seen in celiac disease (CD) tissues. Chronic gliadin exposure caused down-regulation of both ZO-1 and occludin gene expression. CONCLUSIONS: Based on our results, we concluded that gliadin activates zonulin signaling irrespective of the genetic expression of autoimmunity, leading to increased intestinal permeability to macromolecules.},

   abstract = {Gluten enteropathy is a chronic all-life disease, characterized by typical inflammatory changes of the small bowel mucosa. It is the genetically determined autoimmune disease with permanent intolerance to gluten. Its clinical signs are very heterogeneous and also the severity of intestinal changes varies considerably. It frequently presents with atypical symptoms, as many as 80% of adult patients have no gastrointestinal troubles at all. The present estimated prevalence is 1:200 - 1:250. The diagnosis is based on criteria of the European Society of Paediatric Gastroenterology, Hepatology and Nutrition revised in 1990, above all on the detection of serum antibodies to endomysium and tissue transglutaminase. The five forms are distinguished: classic, subclinical, latent, potential and silent. Coeliac disease and dermatitis herpetiformis are considered to be two identical forms of the gluten enteropathy manifestations. Coeliac disease is frequently associated with other autoimmune diseases--diabetes mellitus, autoimmune thyreoiditis, hepatitis, IgA deficiency. Permanent gluten free diet is the cornerstone of the therapy; untreated gluten enteropathy is a serious illness, considered to be a significant precancerosis.},

We describe a female patient with an unclassified enteropathy who experienced several episodes of jejunoileal ulcerations. Several resections of the small bowel segments were necessary. The repetitive ulcerations were either from cytotoxic T cells, the patient developed a T-cell lymphoma, and malignant cells could be detected at the bottom of the ulcers, or from acid-producing cells in areas of gastric metaplasia. Two mechanisms might thus be responsible for the occurrence of repetitive ulceration, and require different treatment strategies. The patient is currently being treated with proton pump inhibitors, oral steroids and parenteral nutrition.},

Between 1968 and 2002, CD patients presenting to the Gastroenterology Unit were evaluated retrospectively. From 2002, newly diagnosed patients were prospectively followed up. Sixty patients (39 female, 21 male) were included in the study. Mean body mass index was 22.2 +/- 5.4 kg/m2. The most common symptoms were diarrhea, weight loss, and flatulence. Most common comorbidities were anemia, osteoporosis, type 1 diabetes mellitus, and steatohepatitis. Six (10.0%) patients had a family history of diabetes mellitus; one (1.7%) patient had a family history of CD. Plasma glucose and serum gamma-glutamyltransferase levels were significantly higher in females than males. Most common histopathological findings were increased lymphocytes in the lamina propria (76.2%) and villus epithelium (59.5%). Over the years, the cumulative frequency of CD increased more in females than males. This is the first study in the literature showing the characteristics of CD in Turkish adults. In our previous recent study, the prevalence of tissue transglutaminase antibody positivity in Turkish healthy blood donors was 1.3%, indicating a high prevalence of CD in our population. In this study, the cumulative frequency of CD increased more in females than males. With the better understanding and increased suspicion of the disease, more patients are being diagnosed in our population.},

   abstract = {OBJECTIVE: Leptin has effects on growth and is also involved in immune regulation. We thought that with its intestinal histopathologic alterations due to immune mechanisms, and subsequent malnutrition and/or growth failure, celiac disease (CD) deserves interest regarding leptin status. METHOD: Serum leptin levels of 19 children with CD on admission and 1 year after gluten-free diet (GFD) and of 16 healthy children were determined. RESULTS: Mean age was 9.7+/-3.3 years. Mean serum leptin level of children with CD on admission and of healthy children were 1.60+/-0.63 ng/mL, and 3.98+/-1.49 ng/mL, respectively (P: 0.0001). Mean serum leptin level under GFD was 4.55+/-1.97 ng/mL. There was a statistical significant difference between serum levels determined before and 1 year after GFD (P: 0.001) and between those of under GFD and healthy children (P: 0.001). Of 19 patients with CD, 10 (52.6%) showed Marsh IIIc, other 9 (47.4%) showed Marsh IIIa histologic lesions. Mean serum leptin level of children with Marsh IIIc and Marsh IIIa were not different (1.70+/-0.73 ng/mL vs. 1.45+/-0.59 ng/mL). Leptin was correlated with body mass index in healthy children, and in CD both before and after GFD (P<0.001). Mean lumbar z score of the patients on admission and after GFD were 2.7+/-1.3 and 1.9+/-0.8, respectively (P: 0.048). Serum leptin level was not correlated with lumbar z score either before or after GFD. CONCLUSIONS: Serum leptin level is affected in childhood CD, it is not directly related to histopathologic findings, and is responsive to GFD. Further studies investigating its level in different clinical and histopathologic presentations might give clear clues about the role of leptin in CD.},

   abstract = {OBJECTIVES: To determine serum nitric oxide levels in pediatric patients with celiac disease and to compare them with the results obtained after 1 year of gluten-free diet. METHODS: We studied serum nitric oxide levels in 41 newly diagnosed patients with celiac disease. Serum levels of nitric oxide were reevaluated after 1 year of gluten-free diet in 23 of them. Mean age was 10.4 +/- 3.4 years (range 2-17 years). RESULTS: The levels of nitric oxide in pretreatment 41 patients with celiac disease and healthy children were detected as 198.33 +/- 20.22 micromol/L and 135.63 +/- 21.17 micromol/L, respectively (P = 0.0001). Serum nitric oxide level, measured in the blood samples 1 year after gluten-free diet, was 148.27 +/- 27.25 micromol/L (P = 0.001). Serum nitric oxide levels were statistically correlated with the degree of histologic changes in celiac disease. In the patients with celiac disease, pretreatment level of nitric oxide was not correlated with the levels of triglyceride, cholesterol, albumin, aspartate aminotransferase, alanine aminotransferase, or creatine kinase. We found correlations with the level of nitric oxide and Hb, mean corpuscular volume, and ferritin. CONCLUSION: Higher serum nitric oxide levels found in children who had not compliance with gluten-free diet suggested the role of serum nitric oxide as an indicator of diet compliance. Because determination of serum nitric oxide is a simple, rapid, cheap, noninvasive, and highly sensitive method for celiac disease, we think that this parameter can be used in the evaluation of diet compliance in children with celiac disease or even instead of gluten challenge, due to more noninvasive property.},

We screened these individuals by ELISA for IgA and IgG tTG antibodies, confirming any positive IgA tTG results with an IgA EMA and looked for evidence of IgA deficiency in those who were IgG tTG positive alone, and performed IgG1 EMA in these individuals. We undertook HLA typing where positive screening was found, and this confirmed a strong prevalence of HLA-DQ2 in the coeliac population. Follow-up small intestinal biopsy was undertaken in cases with positive serological screening, wherever possible. RESULTS: Use of this serological screening algorithm revealed a prevalence of undiagnosed CD in 5%-6% of first degree relatives of probands. CONCLUSION: Our data suggests that first degree relatives of individuals with CD should be screened for this condition.},

Some of these have been hypothesized to share common genetic factors or have a common immunopathogenesis, such as primary biliary cirrhosis, primary sclerosing cholangitis and autoimmune forms of hepatitis or cholangitis. Other hepatic changes in celiac disease may be associated with malnutrition resulting from impaired nutrient absorption, including hepatic steatosis. In addition, celiac disease may be associated with rare hepatic complications, such as hepatic T-cell lymphoma. Finally, pancreatic exocrine function may be impaired in celiac disease and represent a cause of treatment failure.},

   abstract = {BACKGROUND: Several studies have demonstrated changes in the forms of clinical presentation of celiac disease in children and adults, with an increased occurrence of atypical forms. AIM: To determine this fact in Clinical Hospital, Ribeirao Preto, SP, Brazil. METHODS: Celiac patients were studied over two different periods of time, from January 1978 to December 1987 (group 1 = G1) and from January 1988 to December 1997 (group 2 = G2). Time of disease, age at diagnosis and nutritional status and clinical forms were investigated. The typical form was considered to be present if the patient had at least two of the following signs/symptoms: diarrhea, abdominal distention, and weight loss, associated or not with others. RESULTS: Clinical forms (%) - G1: typical 57.14 and atypical 42.85. G2: typical 55.18 and atypical 44.82. Median age at diagnosis: 23 months (G1) and 21 months (G2). Interval between the onset of symptoms and the diagnosis: 13 months (G1) and 11 months (G2). Gomez nutritional status G1: Eutrophy = 23.8, DI = 47.61, DII = 23.8 and DIII = 4.76. G2: Eutrophy = 20.68, DI = 48.27, DII = 27.58 and DIII = 3.44. Waterloo G1: Eutrophy = 23.8, Wasting = 14.28, Stunting = 28.57 and Chronic = 33.33. G2: Eutrophy = 20.68, Wasting = 13.79, Stunting = 34.48 and Chronic = 31.03. No statistically significant differences occurred between the groups for any of these parameters. CONCLUSIONS: No change in the forms of presentation or remaining clinical characteristics of celiac disease occurred in our service. This may be due to the population characteristics or to differences among health services, or to different periods of observation.},

   abstract = {BACKGROUND & AIMS: Increased serotonin levels have been implicated in the pathophysiology of diarrhea associated with celiac and inflammatory diseases. However, the effects of serotonin on Na+ /H+ exchange (NHE) activity in the human intestine have not been investigated fully. The present studies examined the acute effects of 5-hydroxytryptamine (5-HT) on NHE activity using Caco-2 cells as an in vitro model. METHODS: Caco-2 cells were treated with 5-HT (.1 micromol/L, 1 h) and NHE activity was measured as ethyl-isopropyl-amiloride (EIPA)-sensitive 22Na uptake. The effect of 5-HT receptor-specific agonists and antagonists was examined. The role of signaling intermediates in 5-HT-mediated effects on NHE activity was elucidated using pharmacologic inhibitors and immunoblotting. RESULTS: NHE activity was inhibited significantly (approximately 50%-75%, P < .05) by .1 micromol/L 5-HT via inhibition of maximal velocity (Vmax) without any changes in apparent affinity (Km) for the substrate Na+ . NHE inhibition involved a decrease of both NHE2 and NHE3 activities. Studies using specific inhibitors and agonists showed that the effects of 5-HT were mediated by 5-HT4 receptors. 5-HT-mediated inhibition of NHE activity was dependent on phosphorylation of phospholipase C gamma 1 (PLC gamma 1) via activation of src-kinases. Signaling pathways downstream of PLC gamma 1 involved increase of intracellular Ca 2+ levels and subsequent activation of protein kinase C alpha (PKC alpha). The effects of 5-HT on NHE activity were not cell-line specific because T84 cells also showed NHE inhibition. CONCLUSIONS: A better understanding of the regulation of Na+ absorption by 5-HT offers the potential for providing insights into molecular and cellular mechanisms involved in various diarrheal and inflammatory disorders.},

   abstract = {BACKGROUND: Small intestinal malignancies in humans are rare; however, patients with coeliac disease have a relatively high risk for such tumours. Intestinal UDP-glucuronosyltransferases are phase II drug metabolism enzymes also involved in the detoxification of ingested toxins and carcinogens. As many toxins and carcinogens are ingested via food, the human gastrointestinal tract not only has an important role in the uptake of essential nutrients, but also acts as a first barrier against such harmful constituents of the food. Therefore, the gastrointestinal mucosa contains high levels of detoxification enzymes such as cytochromes-P450, glutathione S-transferases and UDP-glucuronosyltransferases. AIM: To compare the UDP-glucuronosyltransferase detoxification capacity in small intestinal mucosa of patients with coeliac disease vs. that in normal controls. METHODS: We assessed UDP-glucuronosyltransferase enzyme activities towards 4-methylumbelliferone in small intestinal biopsies of patients with coeliac disease (n = 22) and age- and sex-matched controls (n = 27). RESULTS: Small intestinal UDP-glucuronosyltransferase enzyme activity in controls was significantly higher than in patients with coeliac disease: 0.55 +/- 0.27 vs. 0.35 +/- 0.16 nmol/min mg protein, respectively (mean +/- s.d., P = 0.005). DISCUSSION: The low small intestinal UDP-glucuronosyltransferase detoxification activity in patients with coeliac disease may result in a deficient detoxification of potential carcinogens, and thus could explain in part the relatively high small intestinal cancer risk in these patients.},

METHODS: Nutritional status was assessed by serum tests and anthropometric measures in 26 subjects (16 to 25 years of age) with biopsy-proven CD and 29 healthy control subjects (16 to 21 years of age) with negative tissue transglutaminase antibodies (16 to 22 years of age); all the subjects were selected from the cohort of 3654 schoolchildren. RESULTS: Compared with control subjects, CD patients had lower median values of whole blood folic acid (91 versus 109 nmol/L; P = 0.01), serum ferritin (14 versus 27 microg/L; P = 0.028) and pre-albumin (0.21 versus 0.28 g/L; P </= 0.001) and higher transferrin receptor (1.3 versus 1.1; P = 0.008) and serum transferrin receptor-ferritin index (1.2 versus 0.7; P = 0.006). Folic acid concentration was subnormal in 31% of the CD subjects (versus 14% of the controls) and iron status (transferrin receptor-ferritin index) was subnormal in 30% (versus 14%). Body mass index was not different in females of the CD and control groups (22 versus 22 kg/m2) or in the males of the respective groups (25 versus 24 kg/m2). Females with CD were shorter than the controls (mean 162 versus 167 cm; P = 0.018), but no difference was found in males. No association was found between the nutritional status and the markers of mucosal injury (villous-crypt measures), but titer of transglutaminase was associated with whole blood folic acid (r = -0.5; P = 0.016) and with transferrin receptor-ferritin index (r = 0.4, P = 0.05). CONCLUSIONS: One third of screen-detected adolescent CD subjects have abnormalities in folate or iron status that call for early diagnosis and dietary treatment of the disease to prevent nutritional deficiencies.},

Of the 72 Down syndrome children, 11 under-went a small intestinal biopsy. RESULTS: Four of 72 children with Down syndrome were diagnosed as having CD and three of them had serum levels of immunoglobulin A tTG antibodies greater than 6 U/mL (668, 147 and 7 U/mL). One Down syndrome child with biopsyproven CD had normal levels of immunoglobulin A tTG. Two Down syndrome children had increased levels of immunoglobulin A tTG (13 and 7 U/mL) but none of these children had an intestinal biopsy performed. Of the 52 CD subjects (median 664 U/mL) one was negative for immunoglobulin A tTG (5 U/mL) and all healthy controls (median 1.2 U/mL) and disease controls (median 0.9 U/mL) had immunoglobulin A tTG antibody levels less than 6 U/mL. Two of four Down syndrome children with CD and 36 of 52 celiac children had increased serum levels of immunoglobulin G tTG antibodies. There was no correlation between the serum levels of tTG and antithyroid autoantibodies. CONCLUSIONS: Although the diagnosis of CD depends on histologic evaluation of intestinal biopsies, detection of anti-tTG antibodies provides a useful complementary diagnostic method for CD in children with Down syndrome.},

It occurs in children and adolescents with gastrointestinal symptoms, dermatitis herpetiformis, dental enamel defects, osteoporosis, short stature, delayed puberty and persistent iron deficiency anemia and in asymptomatic individuals with type 1 diabetes, Down syndrome, Turner syndrome, Williams syndrome, selective immunoglobulin (Ig)A deficiency and first degree relatives of individuals with celiac disease. The Celiac Disease Guideline Committee of the North American Society for Pediatric Gastroenterology, Hepatology and Nutrition has formulated a clinical practice guideline for the diagnosis and treatment of pediatric celiac disease based on an integration of a systematic review of the medical literature combined with expert opinion. The Committee examined the indications for testing, the value of serological tests, human leukocyte antigen (HLA) typing and histopathology and the treatment and monitoring of children with celiac disease. It is recommended that children and adolescents with symptoms of celiac disease or an increased risk for celiac disease have a blood test for antibody to tissue transglutaminase (TTG), that those with an elevated TTG be referred to a pediatric gastroenterologist for an intestinal biopsy and that those with the characteristics of celiac disease on intestinal histopathology be treated with a strict gluten-free diet. This document represents the official recommendations of the North American Society for Pediatric Gastroenterology, Hepatology and Nutrition on the diagnosis and treatment of celiac disease in children and adolescents.},

   abstract = {In spite of modern diagnostic possibilities, the diagnosis of celiac disease is still challenging for the physician. This is due to the great variability of the clinical presentation. Nowadays, the classical symptoms like diarrhea, weight loss and abdominal pain are seen less often. It has become evident that celiac disease is not merely a disease of the intestine but of the entire organism. Furthermore, extraintestinal manifestations can present without any gastrointestinal symptoms. It is likely that in many cases the immune system and not nutrient deficiencies play a major role. In addition, the diagnostic tests are not always unequivocal. There is a great variability of the small intestinal changes which are sometimes in contradiction to the antibody results. Since celiac disease implies a lifelong gluten-free diet, a firm diagnosis should be obtained. Thus, one should not rely on a single test but should rather consider serology, histology and clinical response altogether.},

   abstract = {Celiac disease is a chronic intestinal disease caused by intolerance to gluten. It is characterized by immune-mediated enteropathy, associated with maldigestion and malabsorption of most nutrients and vitamins. In predisposed individuals, the ingestion of gluten-containing food such as wheat and rye induces a flat jejunal mucosa with infiltration of lymphocytes. The main symptoms are: stomach pain, gas, and bloating, diarrhea, weight loss, anemia, edema, bone or joint pain. Prevalence for clinically overt celiac disease varies from 1:270 in Finland to 1:5000 in North America. Since celiac disease can be asymptomatic, most subjects are not diagnosed or they can present with atypical symptoms. Furthermore, severe inflammation of the small bowel can be present without any gastrointestinal symptoms. The diagnosis should be made early since celiac disease causes growth retardation in untreated children and atypical symptoms like infertility or neurological symptoms. Diagnosis requires endoscopy with jejunal biopsy. In addition, tissue-transglutaminase antibodies are important to confirm the diagnosis since there are other diseases which can mimic celiac disease. The exact cause of celiac disease is unknown but is thought to be primarily immune mediated (tissue-transglutaminase autoantigen); often the disease is inherited. Management consists in life long withdrawal of dietary gluten, which leads to significant clinical and histological improvement. However, complete normalization of histology can take years.},

In patients without a prior diagnosis of coeliac disease this is a very rare disorder, and the diagnosis in such cases is often difficult and delayed due to the non-specific nature of the symptoms and a very low index of clinical suspicion. Standard anti-lymphoma therapies have minimal utility in patients with EATL, and their prognosis is poor. An added difficulty is the high risk of intestinal perforation especially with the commencement of treatment due to the multifocal nature of bowel disease and poor underlying nutrition and tissue integrity. To illustrate these problems and provide an example of how these issues may be addressed, we report the case of a patient with EATL who was completely asymptomatic from unsuspected underlying coeliac disease and presented initially with back pain followed by bowel obstruction. He was treated with gut rest with total parenteral nutrition before commencing an intensive chemotherapy regimen [hyper-CVAD (cyclophosphamide, vincristine, doxorubicin, and dexamethasone)] and is currently well in ongoing complete remission 34 months later.},

In The Netherlands, no nutritional information is available. Therefore, we evaluated the nutritional management and nutritional state in young celiac patients. METHODS: The Dutch Celiac Society invited all its members aged 12 to 25 years to complete a food record and a questionnaire. Nutrient intakes were compared with the recommendations and the intake in the general population. Total immunoglobin A, endomysial antibody, tissue transglutaminase and IgA gliadin were determined, and height and weight were assessed. RESULTS: Strict dietary compliance was reported by 75%. The fiber and iron intakes were significantly lower, and the saturated fat intake significantly higher than recommended but comparable with the general population. Most of the patients (61%) found the diet easy to follow. Regular medical controls were reported by 86% but regular dietary controls by only 7% of the patients. Mean and SD scores for height and body mass index were -0.3 +/- 1.1 and -0.3 +/- 0.8, respectively. CONCLUSIONS: The dietary compliance in this group is high, the nutritional state is adequate, but the nutrient intake is not. Better medical and dietary support is necessary to prevent long-term complications and to achieve an ongoing satisfying management in this group of young patients with a chronic disorder.},

RECENT FINDINGS: Despite dropping prevalence rates in developed nations, most new Helicobacter pylori infections are primarily acquired during childhood. Resistance to standard triple therapy and falling eradication rates are increasing problems for clinicians, necessitating the study of alternative treatment strategies. Eosinophilic diseases of the gastrointestinal tract are being increasingly recognized. Although population-based epidemiology and the natural history of eosinophilic diseases are not yet fully characterized, biologic therapies are in development for the treatment of these chronic, often refractory, conditions. A recent US National Institutes of Health celiac disease consensus conference suggested that infants' diet constituents and timing of solid food introduction are potential environmental influences in the development of celiac disease. SUMMARY: New methods of diagnosis and treatment are greatly impacting care of pediatric patients with gastric and duodenal diseases. Less invasive but highly accurate tools for diagnosis are becoming better validated. Early diagnosis and effective intervention in most gastroduodenal disorders of childhood can alter natural history and improve overall quality of life.},

   abstract = {Coeliac disease is an immune-mediated disorder resulting in nutrient malabsorption now thought to have a prevalence of between 1:100 and 1:200 in the UK population. Symptoms can include diarrhoea, steatorrhoea, abdominal bloating, cramps, flatulence, weight loss, weakness and fatigue. In addition to the morbidity associated with presenting symptoms, patients are also at increased risk of metabolic bone disease, enteropathy-associated T-cell lymphoma and other malignancies (gastric, oesophageal, bladder, breast, brain). There appears to be a strong genetic component to this disease. This article provides a short review of the historical, clinical and genetic aspects of this disease and highlights several findings from recent structural and molecular immunology studies. A model of the pathogenesis is proposed where the contributions of innate and adaptive immune systems are delineated and the essential dual roles of gliadin (from ingested gluten) in the initiation and maintenance of this disease are summarised. Finally, potential future therapeutic options based on this new understanding are discussed.},

We investigated the development of transglutaminase antibodies and analysed potential risk factors for coeliac disease autoimmunity in first-degree relatives of patients with type 1 diabetes. METHODS: The study was conducted by prospective observational follow-up from birth of 1,511 children at increased risk of type 1 diabetes or coeliac disease born in Germany between 1989 and 2000. Mean follow-up was to age 7.6 years. Children were tested for transglutaminase and islet autoantibodies. Children were classified as transglutaminase antibody-positive if antibodies were detected by both ELISA and radiobinding assays. RESULTS: The risk of developing transglutaminase antibodies was 4.9% by age 8 years (n=63; 95% CI, 3.7-6.1%). Transglutaminase antibodies developed at an older age than islet autoantibodies (median age, 4.9 vs 2.3 years; p<0.005), and only three children developed both transglutaminase antibodies and islet autoantibodies. Multivariate analysis indicated an increased risk of transglutaminase antibodies in children with the HLA-DRB1*03 allele (hazard ratio for heterozygous DR3, 5.5; 95% CI, 2.9-10.2; hazard ratio for homozygous DR3, 16.2; 95% CI, 6.7-39; p<0.0001) and in children with impaired uterine growth (birth weight < or = 1st percentile, hazard ratio, 3.1; 95% CI, 1.1-7.8, p=0.03). Neither breast-feeding or its duration nor the age of first exposure to gluten was associated with the risk of developing transglutaminase antibodies. CONCLUSIONS/INTERPRETATION: Coeliac disease autoimmunity is initiated later than islet autoimmunity in children who are at risk. An influence of infant nutrition on the development of coeliac disease autoimmunity could not be confirmed in this prospective study.},

   abstract = {OBJECTIVE: Gluten sensitivity is associated with multiple neurological abnormalities including gluten ataxia, motor neuron disease-like neuropathy, small fiber type neuropathy, cognitive impairment, and even parkinsonism. We investigated whether or not gluten sensitivity is involved in Japanese patients with idiopathic cerebellar ataxia with extracerebellar presentation. PATIENTS OR MATERIALS: Fourteen patients with idiopathic cerebellar ataxia with extracerebellar presentation (autonomic instability, parkinsonism, or pyramidal dysfunction in varying combinations) were screened for anti-gliadin antibodies (AGA) to analyze for the presence or absence of gluten sensitivity. Patients with typical MR findings of multiple system atrophy of the cerebellar type were excluded. As disease controls without cerebellar ataxia, 9 patients with Parkinson's disease and 18 patients with amyotrophic lateral sclerosis were screened for AGA. Forty-seven normal controls were also screened for AGA. RESULTS: We found a high prevalence of AGA in 5 (36%) of 14 cerebellar ataxia patients, but in only 1 (4%) of 27 disease controls without cerebellar ataxia (odds ratio, 14.4; 95% CI, 1.41147; p<0.05) and in only 1 (2%) of 47 normal controls (odds ratio, 25.6; 95% CI, 2.66246; p<0.001). Among the cerebellar ataxia patients, atypical features such as sensorimotor neuropathy and/or mild cognitive impairment were more prevalent in the AGA-positive group (60%) than in the AGA-negative group (0%). In one of the ataxic patients with AGA, a gluten-free diet had positive effects on neurological symptoms and nutritional status. CONCLUSION: Gluten sensitivity is involved in at least some of the unexplained neurological symptoms of Japanese patients with adult-onset, sporadic cerebellar ataxia.},

   abstract = {BACKGROUND: Celiac disease (CD) may be missed or diagnosed late in children with chronic diarrhea. In this study the authors estimated the frequency of CD among pediatric patients with chronic diarrhea based on serologic and pathologic examinations. METHODS: During a 6-year period, all patients with chronic diarrhea of more than 6 weeks referred to the authors' department were included. For each patient, an asymptomatic control was enrolled from among the patients referred to our clinic for other reasons. Serologic tests for CD including immunoglobulin A endomysial antibody and immunoglobulin A antigliadin antibody were performed in all patients and controls. If positive, duodenal biopsy was performed to confirm the diagnosis. Patients subsequently diagnosed as CD were placed on a gluten-free diet and reevaluated after 6 months. RESULTS: 825 cases of diarrhea and 825 controls were enrolled. CD was diagnosed in 54 (6.5%) of the diarrhea patients and seven (0.8%) of the controls. After 6 months of gluten-free diet, 48 (88.8%) patients had significant improvement in symptoms and of these 41 (76.1%) were totally asymptomatic. Forty-two patients allowed repeat endoscopy after 6 months of gluten-free diet and 40 (95.2%) showed improvement in histologic findings. CONCLUSION: CD is common among patients labeled as chronic diarrhea. In this subgroup, gluten-free diet may lead to a significant improvement in symptoms. Routine testing for CD may be indicated in all patients being evaluated for chronic diarrhea.},

   abstract = {Celiac disease is a disorder of the small intestine characterized by chronic inflammation of the mucosa and protean clinical manifestations caused by loss of tolerance to dietary antigens. Two strongly associated cofactors have been identified: the presence of HLA-DQ2 or HLA-DQ8 in the host and specific antigenic peptides in the diet that are present in wheat, rye, and barley. Most patients have complete remission after dietary elimination of these foods. Crohn's disease is characterized by chronic, relapsing, recurrent, focal, transmural inflammation of the gastrointestinal tract that can lead to multiple serious problems requiring chronic medical and surgical therapy. Crohn's disease is associated with multiple genetic mutations, at least one of which has been clearly implicated in innate immunity. Multiple lines of evidence suggest that the disease involves abnormal immune responses to gut microbial flora.},

   abstract = {BACKGROUND: In recent years there has been increasing recognition that the pattern of presentation of coeliac disease may be changing. The classic sprue syndrome with diarrhoea and weight loss may be less common than the more subtle presentations of coeliac disease such as an isolated iron deficiency anaemia. As a result, the diagnosis of this treatable condition is often delayed or missed. Recent serologic screening tests allow non-invasive screening to identify most patients with the disease and can be applied in patients with even subtle symptoms indicative of coeliac disease. Both benign and malignant complications of coeliac disease can be avoided by early diagnosis and a strict compliance with a gluten free diet. AIM: The aim of this study is to evaluate the trends in clinical presentation of patients diagnosed with adult coeliac disease. In addition, we studied the biochemical and serological features and the prevalence of associated conditions in patients with adult coeliac disease. METHODS: This is an observational, retrospective, cross-sectional review of the medical notes of 32 adult patients attending the specialist coeliac clinic in a district general hospital. RESULTS: Anaemia was the most common mode of presentation accounting for 66% of patients. Less than half of the patients had any of the classical symptoms of coeliac disease and 25% had none of the classical symptoms at presentation. Anti-gliadin antibodies, anti-endomysial antibody and anti-tissue transglutaminase showed 75%, 68% and 90% sensitivity respectively. In combination, serology results were 100% sensitive as screening tests for adult coeliac disease. Fifty nine percent patients had either osteoporosis or osteopenia. There were no malignant complications observed during the follow up of our patients. CONCLUSION: Most adults with coeliac disease have a sub clinical form of the disease and iron deficiency anaemia may be its sole presenting symptom. Only a minority of adult coeliac disease patients present with classical mal-absorption symptoms of diarrhoea and weight loss. Patients with atypical form of disease often present initially to hospital specialists other than a gastro-enterologist. An awareness of the broad spectrum of presentations of adult coeliac disease, among doctors both in primary care and by the various hospital specialists in secondary care, is necessary to avoid delays in diagnosis. It is important to include serological screening tests for coeliac disease systematically in the evaluation of adult patients with unexplained iron deficiency anaemia or unexplained gastro-intestinal symptoms and in those who are considered to be at increased risk for coeliac disease.},

AIMS: We assessed whether there are differences in the eating habits of coeliac patients when compared to the general public. In addition, we compared chefs' knowledge with the public's knowledge about CD. METHOD: A questionnaire survey about CD was performed on coeliac patients, chefs and the general public from the United Kingdom (UK). RESULTS: Three hundred and nineteen coeliac patients [mean age 53.8 years, 65.8% female], 513 members of the public [49.2 years, 62.6% female] and 322 chefs [37.6 years, 15.2% female] were interviewed. Chefs were less likely to have heard of CD when compared to the public (17.1% (55/322) versus 44.2% (227/513), respectively, P<0.0001). Coeliac patients ate less frequently at a friend's house than the general public (P = 0.003). Coeliac patients ate less frequently from take-away establishments (P<0.0001). However, coeliac patients' ate as frequently in restaurants (P = 0.078). CONCLUSIONS: In the UK, chefs appear to know less about CD than the general public. Patients with CD feel justifiably cautious when eating food not prepared at home. Educating chefs about a gluten-free diet may alleviate the social restrictions on coeliac patients.},

   abstract = {AIMS: Since hyaluronan (HA) metabolism is disturbed in some malignant tumours and in inflammatory diseases, we analysed HA and its receptor CD44 as well as the expression of the Ki67 nuclear protein, a marker of cell proliferation, in histological sections of duodenal biopsies of coeliac disease patients and controls. METHODS AND RESULTS: The study group consisted of 52 patients with coeliac disease in remission, 40 patients with newly diagnosed disease and 10 healthy control subjects. HA was detected with a specific biotinylated probe prepared from cartilage aggrecan and link protein, and CD44 with an antibody recognizing all forms of CD44 and another specific for its v6 variant. For the expression of the nuclear protein, monoclonal antibody MIB-1 was used. The percentage of HA-positive cells in surface epithelium was higher in newly diagnosed patients (13%) compared with patients in remission (11%) and controls (2%). In addition, HA intensity in the lamina propria was decreased in the newly diagnosed patients. In patients with active disease, 22-26% of the surface epithelium was CD44+, whereas the corresponding figure in patients in remission was 5%, and that of controls 1%. The more intensive MIB-1 labelling in the duodenal epithelium of coeliac patients without treatment was normalized after gluten-free diet. CONCLUSIONS: The HA-positive coat on surface epithelium seen even in patients in remission suggests persistent or even permanent changes in the epithelial permeability barrier in coeliac disease.},

   abstract = {Medical nutrition therapy is the only accepted treatment for celiac disease. This paper summarizes a review of scientific studies using the gluten-free diet, nutritional risk factors, controversial elements of the diet, and its implementation in treating celiac disease. Treatment for celiac disease requires elimination of the storage proteins found in wheat, rye, and barley. The inclusion of oats and wheat starch is controversial. Research supports that oats may be acceptable for patients with celiac disease and can improve the nutritional quality of the diet. However, use of oats is not widely recommended in the United States because of concerns of potential contamination of commercial oats. Studies assessing the contamination of commercial oats are limited. Research indicates no differences in patients choosing a strict wheat starch-containing, gluten-free diet vs. a naturally gluten-free diet. Factors other than trace gluten may be the cause of continued villous atrophy in some patients. The impact of nutrient malabsorption caused from untreated celiac disease is well documented. The diet and gluten-free products are often low in B vitamins, calcium, vitamin D, iron, zinc, magnesium, and fiber. Few gluten-free products are enriched or fortified, adding to the risk of nutrient deficiencies. Patients newly diagnosed or inadequately treated have low bone mineral density, imbalanced macronutrients, low fiber intake, and micronutrient deficiencies. Also troubling is the increased incidence of obesity seen in persons with celiac disease following a gluten-free diet. Because of the nutritional risks associated with celiac disease, a registered dietitian must be part of the health care team that monitors the patient's nutritional status and compliance on a regular basis.},

   abstract = {OBJECTIVES: Celiac disease develops gradually from lymphocytosis, crypt hyperplasia and minor villous atrophy to overt villous atrophy. It IS NOT known how such minor mucosal changes predict eventual celiac disease. The aim of this study was to evaluate the role of intraepithelial lymphocytosis and marginally decreased villous height/crypt depth ratio in the development of overt villous atrophy in a long-term follow-up. METHODS: The authors evaluated 980 small bowel biopsies of children who had previously been studied and found to be histologically negative for celiac disease between 1976 and 1992. Villous height/crypt depth ratio and the number of intraepithelial lymphocytes were measured in these initial biopsies. Cases with slight biopsy changes were identified for further study and sex and age matched subjects with normal biopsies from same group were selected as controls. They all were asked to submit serum samples for gliadin, endomysial and tissue transglutaminase antibodies 8 to 28 years after the initial biopsy. Those with positive screening tests were asked to undergo endoscopy and small intestinal biopsy. RESULTS: 236 cases with slight changes were identified, and 236 with normal mucosa served as controls; 76 cases and 68 controls participated in the follow-up study. Ten individuals had positive screening test results. Two new celiac disease patients, one in each group, were found. Four patients in the case group had been diagnosed with celiac disease by routine procedures during the follow-up. Thus, five cases and one control had developed celiac disease. CONCLUSIONS: Small bowel mucosal lymphocytosis or slight reduction in villous height/crypt depth ratio are common findings in patients with suspicion of celiac disease. These findings alone are poor predictors of celiac disease.},

We describe our experience with nine multivisceral harvests reporting our in vivo technique. Multivisceral grafts included stomach, duodenum, pancreas, small bowel, and part of large intestine with or without the liver. After a careful evaluation of the liver and the bowel, we isolated the superior mesenteric artery origin. Then we identified the distal part of the graft isolating the middle colic vein and stapling the transverse colon to its left. After esophagus isolation and stapling, we mobilized the graft, starting from the spleen to the pancreaticoduodenal block, near the celiac trunk. After cross-clamping and cold perfusion, we created an aortic patch including the superior mesenteric artery and celiac trunk as a multivisceral harvest without the liver. A total hepatectomy is added for a liver multivisceral graft. We harvested four multivisceral grafts without the liver and five multivisceral grafts with the liver. We performed seven multivisceral transplants on adult recipients, four without the liver and three with the liver, as well as two liver and one isolated small bowel transplants. Postreperfusion hemostasis was always satisfactory with a mean ischemia time of 6.5 hours. Four recipients died: there was one intraoperative death due to disseminated intravascular coagulopathy. Another patient underwent graftectomy 1 day after transplantation due to vascular thrombosis. In conclusion, our in vivo technique allows a shorter ischemia time with a minimal postreperfusion bleeding and reduced production of lymphatic ascites, without jeopardizing organ function.},

   abstract = {BACKGROUND AND STUDY AIMS: Celiac disease can manifest with nonspecific symptoms, including functional gastrointestinal disorders such as dyspepsia. The aim of our study was to assess the usefulness of duodenal endoscopic markers of villous atrophy for the selection of dyspeptic patients for histological assessment. PATIENTS AND METHODS: Esophagogastroduodenoscopy was performed in dyspeptic patients, in patients considered to be at risk of having celiac disease, and in healthy controls. At least three duodenal biopsies were performed for histological assessment of villous atrophy in all patients and controls. We looked for the following four duodenal endoscopic markers of celiac disease: reduction in the number of folds, scalloping of folds, mosaic-pattern mucosa, and nodular mucosa. RESULTS: A total of 175 people were enrolled (75 patients with dyspepsia; 75 patients who were "at risk" of having celiac disease; and 25 healthy volunteers, or "controls"). Of the dyspeptic patients, four had endoscopic markers of celiac disease with no histologically confirmed villous atrophy, while one patient without endoscopic markers was found to have Marsh type I villous atrophy. Of the patients at risk of having celiac disease, 16 had at least one endoscopic marker and 10/16 were found to have histological villous atrophy. In this group, the sensitivity and specificity of the endoscopic markers were 100 % and 90.8 % respectively. "At-risk" patients with two or more endoscopic markers all had histologically confirmed villous atrophy. Neither endoscopic markers nor villous atrophy were found in any of the control patients. CONCLUSIONS: Additional endoscopic markers are valuable for diagnosis in patients with clinical symptoms suggestive of celiac disease. In contrast, endoscopic markers of villous atrophy are not useful for selecting a subgroup of dyspeptic patients for screening for celiac disease by duodenal histological assessment. These patients should be screened using other protocols.},

Primary (15%) and secondary (85%) forms are known. In the more frequent secondary forms small intestine and the right side of the colon are mainly affected, and the underlying pathology can be gastrointestinal, pulmonary or immunological. The 64 year old male patient reported by the authors showed clinical signs of severe malabsorption (his body weight: 47,5 kg, height: 178 cm, BMI: 15). The intestinal pneumatosis was diagnosed by exploration performed because of suspected perforation (pneumoperitoneum). Due to severe malabsorption the patient was admitted to Gastroenterological Department. Duodenoscopy and small bowel biopsy was performed. Small intestinal histology and presence of anti-gliadin and anti-endomysium antibody confirmed the suspected diagnosis of coeliakia. Parenteral nutrition, special gliadin free diet, hyperbaric oxygen inhalation, steroid, and metronidazole treatment resulted in a gradual improvement in the nutritional and general condition of the patient. After one year the patient is without complaints, he gained 24,5 kg body weight BMI: 22,5). The author's case points to a rare serious complication of non-treated coeliakia. Recognition of intestinal pneumatosis in time could have prevented surgical intervention in the high risk patient.},

   abstract = {Coeliac disease is a lifelong intolerance to the gluten found in wheat, barley and rye, and some patients are also sensitive to oats. The disease is genetically determined, with 10% of the first-degree relatives affected and 75% of monozygotic twins being concordant. Of the patients with coeliac disease 95% are human leucocyte antigen (HLA)-DQ2 or HLA-DQ8 positive. Characteristically, the jejunal mucosa becomes damaged by a T-cell-mediated autoimmune response that is thought to be initiated by a 33-mer peptide fragment in A2 gliadin, and patients with this disorder have raised levels of anti-endomysium and tissue transglutaminase antibodies in their blood. Coeliac disease is the major diagnosable food intolerance and, with the advent of a simple blood test for case finding, prevalence rates are thought to be approximately 1:100. Classically, the condition presented with malabsorption and failure to thrive in infancy, but this picture has now been overtaken by the much more common presentation in adults, usually with non-specific symptoms such as tiredness and anaemia, disturbance in bowel habit or following low-impact bone fractures. Small intestinal biopsy is necessary for diagnosis and shows a characteristically flat appearance with crypt hypoplasia and infiltration of the epithelium with lymphocytes. Diet is the key to management and a gluten-free diet effectively cures the condition. However, this commitment is lifelong and many aisles in the supermarket are effectively closed to individuals with coeliac disease. Compliance can be monitored by measuring antibodies in blood, which revert to negative after 6-9 months. Patients with minor symptoms, who are found incidentally to have coeliac disease, often ask whether it is necessary to adhere to the diet. Current advice is that dietary adherence is necessary to avoid the long-term complications, which are, principally, osteoporosis and small bowel lymphoma. However, risk of these complications diminishes very considerably in patients who are on a gluten-free diet.},

   abstract = {Man ingests food to mitigate hunger (mediated by physiological and biochemical signals), satisfy appetite (subjective sensation) and because of psychosocial reasons. Satiation biomarkers (stop feeding) are gastric distention and hormones (CCK, GLP-1) and satiety biomarkers (induce feeding) are food-induced thermogenesis, body temperature, glycaemia and also hormones (insulin, leptin and ghrelin). Oxidative metabolism/body composition, tryptophan/serotonin and proinflammatory cytokines are also implicated on hunger physiology. At the present time, ghrelin is the only known circulating orexigenic with potential on hunger/body weight regulation. It is a neuropeptide (endogenous ligand for the GH secretagogue) recently isolated from the oxyntic mucosa and synthesized mainly in the stomach. Its blood concentration depends on diet, hyperglucemia and adiposity/leptin. It is secreted 1-2 hours preprandially and its concentration decreases drastically during the postprandium. Ghrelin acts on the lateral hypothalamus and theoretically inhibits proinflammatory cytokine secretion and antagonizes leptin. Ghrelin physiologically increases food intake and stimulates adipogenesis, gastrointestinal motility and gastric acid secretion, and has other hormonal and cardiovascular functions. Ghrelin blood concentration is reduced in massive obesity, non-alcoholic steatohepatitis, polycystic ovary syndrome, acromegaly, hypogonadism, ageing, short bowel syndrome and rheumatoid arthritis; and increased in primary or secondary anorexia, starvation, chronic liver disease and celiac disease. Cerebral and peritoneal ghrelin administration (rats) and systemic administration (rats and healthy volunteers, cancer patients or patients on peritoneal dialysis) promotes food consumption and increases adiposity, of utmost importance in the treatment of patients with anorexia.},

The second one of monozygotic twins does not develop the disease in 100% but only in 20-50%. To unravel these mysteries, literature was searched to determine the disease background and find suggestions for research and prevention. The causal antigen of coeliac disease is gluten of wheat that is neutralised in the intestine by secretory immune globulin A (sIgA). SIgA is secreted by the secondary (lymphoid) immune system that develops in a newborn infant after the primary (central) immune organs thymus and bone marrow have been primed with antigens of the intestine. Predisposed infants are sensitive for development of coeliac disease during the time without sIgA secretion into the intestine. The risk of the disease diminishes when sIgA cycles of gluten neutralisation develop. Peyer's patches (PP) of the secondary immune system play a central role in the cycles and possibly do not function well in the case of coeliac disease. Coeliac disease in predisposed infants may be prevented by delay of bread consumption till the time of normal sIgA secretion and by application of a challenge period with gluten (see Discussion). It is concluded that sIgA secretion into body cavities and malfunction of immune cells in PP should be included in the future research of coeliac disease as well as in more allergic diseases (type 1 diabetes, Crohn disease, asthma, hay fever).},

PATIENTS AND METHODS: The following parameters were measured: plasma CCK in response to a fatty meal and human pancreatic fecal elastase in 24 patients with CD while on gluten-free diet and after gluten provocation and in 12 patients with CMPE at diagnosis and after a 6-month period of cow's milk-free diet. Intestinal mucosa morphology was examined by small bowel biopsy. Sixty-three controls having no organic gastrointestinal problems were investigated once at the time of diagnostic evaluation. RESULTS: Fasting CCK, obtained at a time when patients with CD or CMPE had normal intestinal mucosa, was significantly different from postprandial and comparable to that of the control group. Fasting CCK obtained from patients with villous atrophy was also statistically different, but not significantly, from the postprandial. Fasting and postprandial plasma CCK and fecal pancreatic elastase values from patients having normal intestinal mucosa were significantly higher than those obtained from patients with villous atrophy. Significant correlation of intestinal mucosa morphology and CCK with fecal elastase concentration was documented. CONCLUSION: Exocrine pancreatic dysfunction in individuals having villous atrophy may be the consequence of decreased CCK secretion. Cholecystokinin and pancreatic secretion is restored to normal, with intestinal mucosa regeneration.},

Both conditions are difficult to treat. Here we describe the effects of a nonimmunogenic elemental diet on clinical symptoms and mucosal immunopathology in type 1 RCD. METHODS: Ten CD patients on a strict gluten-free diet were diagnosed with type 1 RCD after extensive clinical evaluation in a tertiary referral hospital. A 4-week amino-acid-based liquid elemental diet regimen was given with no other treatment, except in 1 patient who also received methotrexate. Duodenal biopsy specimens were obtained before and after treatment for histologic assessment, immunophenotyping of intraepithelial lymphocytes, T-cell receptor clonality, mucosal interleukin (IL)-15 expression, flow-cytometric analysis of interferon (IFN)-gamma-secreting T cells, and whole biopsy specimen IFN-gamma messenger RNA determination. RESULTS: Nine patients completed the treatment; however, 1 patient did not tolerate the diet. Histologic improvement and reduced epithelial IL-15 were seen in 8 patients, whereas IFN-gamma-secreting mucosal T cells and IFN-gamma messenger RNA levels decreased in 4 and 7 patients, respectively. Clinical improvement was noted in 6 patients, with 1 patient showing normalization of hypoalbuminemia. Three patients could discontinue their total parenteral nutrition. CONCLUSIONS: Persistent mucosal IFN-gamma and IL-15 production often occurs in type 1 RCD despite conventional treatment. Elemental diet is a therapeutic option that can provide long-term immunopathologic and clinical improvement of this difficult condition.},

   abstract = {INTRODUCTION: There is no information in the literature about surgical outcome of the distal splenorenal shunt (Warren shunt) in those patients with anomalous flow in the left renal vein to the inferior vena cava. OBJECTIVE: The purpose of this manuscript was to evaluate the incidence of thrombosis in the Warren shunt in those patients with anomalous flow in the left renal vein to the inferior vena cava. METHODS: We performed a prospective, descriptive and longitudinal study in those patients who performed a surgical procedure to the treatment of hemorrhagic portal hypertension in a tertiary referral center in Mexico City during a one year period (2002-2003). Before the surgical procedure an arterial and venous angiographic study was done including celiac axis, superior mesenteric artery and splenic artery. The patients were scheduled in the outpatient office the first, third, sixth month and the year after the surgical procedure. We looked in them for gastrointestinal bleeding secondary to portal hypertension. In those patients with Warren shunt an angiographic study was done during the first month after the surgical procedure. RESULTS: Twenty eight patients were included, 17 of them women (60.7%). Median patient age was 48 years old. In 20 patients a Warren shunt were done and in eigth patients a devascularization operation were done. The anomalous flow of the left renal vein was identified in nine patients (28.7%). In seven of them a Warren shunt were done and in two of them a devascularization operation were done. We didn't find gastrointestinal bleeding or thrombosis of the Warren shunt in any of these patients. CONCLUSION: In those cases of patients with anomalous flow in the left renal vein a Warren shunt can be performed. In this study we didn't find thrombosis of the shunt or gastrointestinal bleeding. In this way a surgical decompression of the portal system can be done preventing bleeding episodes.},

   abstract = {Glucagon-like peptide-1 (GLP-1) is released from the gut in response to nutrient ingestion. Intravenous (iv) administration of GLP-1 (50 pmol-20 nmol) elicited dose-dependent increases in the rate of whole-body O2 consumption (VO2), an index of energy expenditure, and heart rate of urethane-anesthetized rats. The body core (colonic) temperature increased up to 0.3 degrees C without accompanying alteration of tail skin temperature. Intracerebroventricular (icv) administration of GLP-1 induced a slower and smaller increase in VO2 than the intravenous administration. The injection of glucagon-like peptide-2 (iv or icv) had no effect on VO2, body temperatures, or heart rate. Decerebration had no effect on the thermogenic responses induced by the iv administration of GLP-1, suggesting that the forebrain is not essential for these responses. However, cervical spinal transection greatly attenuated the responses, suggesting the critical involvement of the lower brainstem. Adrenalectomy or pretreatment with an autonomic ganglion blocker, hexamethonium, or a beta-adrenergic blocker, propranolol, also significantly attenuated the thermogenic response. However, subdiaphragmatic vagotomy or celiac-superior mesenteric ganglionectomy had no effect. Rats made insulin-deficient by pretreatment with streptozotocin also exhibited the normal thermogenic response to GLP-1. These results suggest the involvement of the GLP-1 in postprandial energy expenditure, mediated by the lower brainstem and sympathoadrenal system.},

PATIENTS AND METHODS: In all biopsy samples taken from the duodenum and/or the terminal ileum, 30 were studied for the expression of interferon-gamma, transforming growth factor-beta, chemokine receptor (CCR)-4, CCR-5, IL-2, IL-6, IL-10, IL-12p35, IL-12p40 and IL-18 specific mRNA by real-time quantitative reverse transcriptase-polymerase chain reaction in 26 children ages 3 to 15 years: 10 with untreated delayed-type CMA, 6 with celiac disease (CD) and 10 controls. RESULTS: The children with delayed-type CMA showed lower IL-2 and IL-18 mRNA expression in the duodenum (both P = 0.055) and higher CCR-4 and IL-6 mRNA expression in the terminal ileum (P = 0.055, P = 0.016) compared with the controls. The children with CD exhibited slightly higher expression of interferon-gamma and CCR-4 mRNA (P = 0.054, P = 0.053) and lower expression of IL-18 mRNA (P = 0.004) in the duodenal samples compared with the controls. The mRNA expression levels of regulatory cytokines, transforming growth factor-beta and IL-10 remained similar in all 3 groups. CONCLUSIONS: The children with delayed-type gastrointestinal CMA showed a unique pattern of local intestinal hypersensitivity with Th2 response-related characteristics, a profile differing clearly from the children with CD.},

   abstract = {BACKGROUND: Gastrointestinal hypersensitivity to cow milk (CM) may be more common among school-aged children and young adults than previously thought. OBJECTIVE: The objective was to study various gastrointestinal complaints and the immunologic mechanisms associated with food-related, especially CM-related, gastrointestinal disorders in young adults. DESIGN: Of 827 subjects aged 16-21 y who completed a questionnaire on food-related gastrointestinal symptoms, 49 symptomatic subjects agreed to a clinical examination, including an interview, blood tests, a lactose-maldigestion test, a blinded CM challenge and, in severely symptomatic subjects (n = 12), an endoscopic examination. Twenty-nine subjects served as controls. RESULTS: Approximately 10% of the subjects reported having major gastrointestinal symptoms, mainly food-related (n = 70 of 86), during the preceding year. Specific organic disease was found in 2 symptomatic subjects: 1 case of celiac disease and 1 of colitis. The result of the lactose-maldigestion test was positive in 16 of the remaining 47 symptomatic subjects, but only 4 carried the C/C(-13910) genotype for adult-type hypolactasia. The symptomatic subjects had restricted their consumption of certain foods, particularly CM. However, in a blinded challenge, CM-induced symptoms were rare. The symptomatic subjects had higher plasma soluble intercellular adhesion molecule 1 (P = 0.007) and lower granzyme A (P = 0.001) concentrations than did the control subjects. Duodenal biopsy samples tended to have higher intraepithelial CD3(+) cell counts (P = 0.065) and a higher expression of transforming growth factor beta (P = 0.073) and interleukin 12p35 messenger RNA (P = 0.075) than did the control subjects. CONCLUSIONS: In an unselected cohort of young adults, 8% reported food-related gastrointestinal symptoms. The finding of immunologic activity implied the existence of a food-related gastrointestinal syndrome but not one induced by CM.},

The aim of this study was to investigate local intestinal cytokine secretion in the upper small intestine in children with delayed-type cow's milk allergy (CMA). Duodenal biopsy samples from 31 children with delayed CMA, 14 with celiac disease (CD), and 14 healthy controls were studied for the spontaneous release of IFN-gamma, TNF-alpha, IL-2, IL-4, IL-5, and IL-10, measured by cytometric bead array, and of TGF-beta and IL-6 measured by ELISA. The children with delayed CMA secreted more IFN-gamma than the controls (p = 0.006) and the children with CD (p = 0.006). The children with CD secreted more IL-6 compared to the controls (p = 0.008) and the children with delayed CMA (p = 0.002). The children with delayed CMA who had continuously been exposed to CM secreted less TGF-beta than the children with delayed CMA who avoided CM (p = 0.050), and showed a tendency towards lower secretion compared to the controls (p = 0.078). Secretions of TNF-alpha, IL-2, IL-4, IL-5, and IL-10 were low in general; however, the children with delayed CMA who did not avoid CM secreted more IL-4 and IL-10 than the controls (p = 0.016, 0.059). In conclusion, the children with delayed CMA showed up-regulation of IFN-gamma. Interestingly, TGF-beta secretion was up-regulated in those children with delayed CMA who avoided CM suggesting recovery of regulation mechanisms.},

   abstract = {Anthropometric parameters and catch-up growth were prospectively evaluated in fifty late-diagnosed children with coeliac disease aged 2.25-10 years after 1-4 years of adhering to a strict gluten-free diet (GFD). The anthropometric parameters were expressed as Z scores relative to National Centre for Health Statistics standards using Epi Info 2000 (weight-for-height Z score (WHZ) and height-for-age Z score (HAZ)). Catch-up growth was evaluated by repeated measures. ANOVA, overall significance by an F test and pair-wise comparisons for estimated marginal means using the least significant difference. At the time of enrolment, no significant difference was observed in WHZ and HAZ between children diagnosed before (group 1) or after (group 2) 4 years of age. On follow-up, HAZ was significantly higher in group 1 after the first and third years of the GFD (P=0.04 and 0.02, respectively), with a non-significant increase after completing 4 years of the GFD (P=0.22). Feeding the GFD resulted in an overall significant (F=3.99, P=0.011) increase in HAZ up to 4 years of follow-up. However, the catch-up in height was incomplete, with stunting in sixteen (55.4%) of twenty-nine children after 3 years and in seven (46.6%) of fifteen children after 4 years on the GFD. Pair-wise comparisons demonstrated a linear catch-up growth during the initial follow-up on GFD. Treatment with the GFD did not result in an overall significant increase in WHZ up to 4 years of follow-up (F=1.01, P=0.42). Our results suggest that, in children with late-diagnosed coeliac disease, treatment with a GFD leads to a normalisation of body mass and a significant but incomplete recovery in HAZ during 4 years of follow-up.},

   abstract = {Chronic unexplained hypertransaminasemia is an isolated clinical manifestation of celiac disease (CD) and lacks of a clear physiopathological explanation. Since CD and tropical sprue (TS) have similar intestinal functional and histological pattern of injury and that an increased inflammatory response has been reported to occur in patients with irritable bowel syndrome (IBS), liver involvement might be expected to occur either in TS or IBS. However, according to author's prior observations, the frequency of hypertransaminasemia is significantly higher in CD than in TS and IBS-diarrhea predominant patients (IBS-D). Thus, based on current knowledge, intestinal mucosal damage, increased intestinal permeability and/or an active intestinal inflammatory response do not completely explain liver damage in CD. We hypothesize that other factors, unique to CD not present in TS or IBS-D, like gluten toxicity and the presence of tissular transglutaminase (tTG) an auto-antigen with pro-inflammatory and remodeling properties, act in addition to intestinal mucosal injury and account to hypertransaminasemia in CD. Further research focusing on the mechanisms of gluten and tTG hepatic toxicity, and/or the characterization of the expression, secretion and enteral-hepatic transport of certain pro-inflammatory cytokines is needed, to understand the possible links between intestinal and liver disorders seen in CD.},

   abstract = {Capsule endoscopy has revolutionised the management of digestive tract diseases by providing a new non-invasive way to view the entire small bowel mucosa directly. Obscure gastrointestinal bleeding is the primary and best validated indication to capsule endoscopy, which when used as first-line exploration is the most efficient strategy as regards diagnosis. In these patients, the technique is also helpful for effective decision-making concerning subsequent treatments. There is significant uncertainty regarding the role of capsule endoscopy in patients with Crohn's disease. Although it is clearly more sensitive than conventional imaging modalities, the implications of the lesions identified with this technique are not fully understood. Further prospective studies are required to identify the clinical settings where capsule endoscopy is most effective in these patients. Capsule endoscopy may potentially lead to diagnosis of small bowel tumours earlier in their course; it should be used as first-line surveillance procedure in patients with Peutz-Jeghers syndrome, and it may be of clinical value in selected patients with familial adenomatous polyposis. Although preliminary results are promising, additional research is necessary to determine its role in the diagnosis and management of coeliac disease, as well as for the diagnosis of oesophageal and large bowel disorders. Well-designed studies are also needed to better define the impact of capsule endoscopy on health care use and clinical outcome of patients with intestinal diseases.},

   abstract = {Celiac disease is the only autoimmune condition for which we know the environmental trigger: gluten. Complete removal of gluten from the diet in a patient with celiac disease should result in symptomatic, serologic, and histologic remission. However, compliance with the gluten-free diet, especially in the United States, is extremely challenging. Compliance can be measured both noninvasively, by dietary history and measurement of serum antibodies, and invasively, by using endoscopic and histologic criteria. The advantages and disadvantages of these various modalities are discussed. The highest rates of compliance are reported in patients who are diagnosed as young children, whereas adolescents and those diagnosed via mass serologic screening have the most transgressions. Barriers to compliance include the poor palatability of gluten-free foods, confusing food-labeling practices, and common comorbid psychologic burdens such as anxiety and depression. Because celiac disease is a multisystemic disorder, physicians need to be aware of the potential autoimmune, nutritional, and malignant complications. An algorithm for the follow-up and management of the newly diagnosed celiac disease patient is presented, which includes regular follow-up; measurement of serum antibodies; eliciting a detailed dietary history; and examination for signs and symptoms of nutritional deficiencies, malignancy, and other autoimmune diseases. Ideally, a team approach to the follow-up of the newly diagnosed patient should include regular supervision by an interested physician, medical nutritional counseling by a registered dietician, and access to local and national support groups knowledgeable about this condition.},

   abstract = {OBJECTIVE: This study was designed to prospectively evaluate the clinical features of celiac disease (CD) in a large group of Indian children and to compare them with those from the West. PATIENTS AND METHODS: Over a period of 5 years, a total of 549 children (< or = 14 years) with a clinical suspicion of CD were evaluated. Their detailed clinical features, investigations, and follow-up data were recorded. Complete hemogram, endoscopic duodenal biopsy, and celiac serology were done in all of the cases. Celiac disease was diagnosed on the basis of modified European Society of Paediatric Gastroenterology, Hepatology and Nutrition criteria. RESULTS: Celiac disease was diagnosed in 300 children; 39 were excluded because of lack of follow-up or poor response to gluten-free diet. The remaining 210 had normal villous architecture and served as controls. The mean (+/- standard deviation) age of children with CD was 6.7 +/- 3 years, and the mean duration of symptoms was 3.5 +/- 2.5 years. The majority (84%) presented with diarrhea; other features were failure to thrive in 91%, anemia in 84%, wasting in 87%, and stunting in 60% of cases. Among the serological tests, the best results were obtained with tissue transglutaminase. On follow-up (19.4 +/- 15.5 months), symptoms subsided in all cases of CD with a significant weight and height gain. CONCLUSIONS: Indian children with CD present late, with a significant delay in diagnosis. The majority presents with classic symptoms of diarrhea, failure to thrive, and anemia. There is a need for increasing awareness to pick up the atypical forms of the disease.},

Serological tests were performed in 35 cases. The patients were divided into three age groups <5 years, 5-10 years, and >10 years as per the age of presentation to the hospital. Mean age was 8.7 years with a slight female preponderance. Diarrhea was the commonest presentation in group I and failure to thrive in group III. All patients in group III, had weight for age (w/a) <3rd percentile and majority (83 per cent) had short stature, with delayed puberty in all. All children had significant improvement in symptoms and growth on gluten restriction. None of the patients had been suspected to have celiac disease before, which signifies that in spite of increasing incidence of celiac disease, this disease is grossly under-diagnosed in North India where wheat is the staple diet. It is essential to make an early diagnosis of celiac disease in children to prevent growth delay.},

Unfortunately, the diagnosis of bacterial overgrowth presents several difficulties and limitations, and as yet there is not a widespread agreement on the best diagnostic test. SIBO occurs when there are alterations in intestinal anatomy, gastrointestinal motility, or a lack of gastric acid secretion. The true association between SIBO and irritable bowel syndrome and celiac disease remains uncertain. The treatment usually consists in the eradication of bacterial overgrowth with repeated courses of antimicrobials, nutritional support and when it is possible, the correction of underlying predisposing conditions.},

   abstract = {OBJECTIVE: To investigate clinical and metabolic characteristics of diabetic children with screening detected celiac disease in a multicenter case-control study. METHODS: CASES: 98 diabetic patients were diagnosed as having silent celiac disease by screening with endomysial antibodies and subsequent biopsy. CONTROLS: two controls in the same center were chosen, (stratified by age and age-at-diabetes onset) who were negative for endomysial antibodies (n = 195). Height, weight, HbA1c, insulin dosage and acute complications were documented for at least 1 year of follow up. RESULTS: Mean age of diabetes manifestation was 6.5 +/- 4.1 years and diagnosis of celiac disease was made at 10.0 +/- 5.4 years. Biopsy showed total or subtotal mucosal atrophy in 74 patients. The mean observation period after the diagnosis of celiac disease was 3.3 +/- 1.9 years. Mean HbA1c levels were similar between cases and controls (8.63% +/- 1.45% versus 8.50% +/- 1.39%; P = 0.35). There was also no difference in the frequency of severe hypoglycemia, ketoacidosis and the applied insulin dosage (P = 0.45). Body mass index-standard deviation score at celiac disease diagnosis (0.57 +/- 1.24 versus 0.52 +/- 1.07) and height-standard deviation score (0.14 +/- 1.13 versus 0.30 +/- 0.95) did not differ between cases and controls. After diagnosis of celiac disease, weight gain was diminished in boys with celiac disease compared with their controls (P < 0.05). Female cases also had a lower body mass index than female controls (P = 0.067). CONCLUSION: In a cohort of diabetic children, silent celiac disease had no obvious effect on metabolic control but negatively influenced weight gain.},

   abstract = {OBJECTIVES: We sought to characterize the clinical features at presentation as well as the associated disorders, family history, and evaluation of compliance with a gluten-free diet in children with celiac disease from across Canada. STUDY DESIGN: All members (n = 5240) of the Canadian Celiac Association were surveyed with a questionnaire. Of the 2849 respondents with biopsy-confirmed celiac disease, 168 who were < 16 years old provided the data reported here. RESULTS: The mean age when surveyed was 9.1 +/- 4.1 years, and 58% were female. Median age at diagnosis was 3.0 years with a range of 1 to 15 years. Presenting symptoms included abdominal pain (90%), weight loss (71%), diarrhea (65%), weakness (64%), nausea/vomiting (53%), anemia (40%), mood swings (37%), and constipation (30%). Almost one third of families consulted > or = 2 pediatricians before confirmation of the diagnosis. Before the recognition of celiac disease, other diagnoses received by these children included anemia (15%), irritable bowel syndrome (11%), gastroesophageal reflux (8%), stress (8%), and peptic ulcer disease (4%). A serological test was performed to screen for celiac disease in 70% of those in this population. Eight percent had either type 1 diabetes mellitus or a first-degree relative with celiac disease. Almost all respondents (95%) reported strict adherence to a gluten-free diet, and 89% noted improved health. Reactions after accidental gluten ingestion developed in 54% of the children between 0.5 and 60 hours after ingestion with a median of 2.0 hours. Reactions included abdominal discomfort (87%), diarrhea (64%), bloating (57%), fatigue (37%), headache (24%), and constipation (8%), and most displayed > 1 symptom. Although most adjusted well to their disease and diet, 10% to 20% reported major disruptions in lifestyle. Twenty-three percent felt angry all or most of the time about following a gluten-free diet. Only 15% avoided traveling all or most of the time, and during travel, 83% brought gluten-free food with them all of the time. More than half of the families avoided restaurants all or most of the time. Twenty-eight percent of the respondents found it extremely difficult to locate stores with gluten-free foods, and 27% reported extreme difficulty in finding gluten-free foods or determining if foods were free of gluten. Sixty-three percent of the respondents felt that the information supplied by the Canadian Celiac Association was excellent. Gastroenterologists provided excellent information to 44%, dietitians to 36%, and the family physician to 11.5%. When asked to select 2 items that would improve their quality of life, better labeling of gluten-containing ingredients was selected by 63%, more gluten-free foods in the supermarket by 49%, gluten-free choices on restaurant menus by 49%, earlier diagnosis of celiac disease by 34%, and better dietary counseling by 7%. CONCLUSIONS: In Canada, children with celiac disease present at all ages with a variety of symptoms and associated conditions. Delays in diagnosis are common. Most children are compliant with a gluten-free diet. A minority of these children experience difficulties in modifying their lifestyles, and gluten-free foods remain difficult to obtain.},

The aim of this study was to evaluate whether square-pulse analysis of duodenal biopsies from children can be used to determine electrical tight junction resistance. METHODS: Intestinal biopsies from children with different stages of CD and from patients with CF were studied in a modified Ussing chamber. The epithelium was assumed to act as an electrical circuit consisting of a current generator parallel with a resistance and a capacitance. Subepithelial and epithelial resistances were determined by square-pulse analysis, and the generated current was calculated. RESULTS: Confirming data using permeability probes, reduced epithelial electrical resistance was found both in patients with CF and CD. Only the CF patients had reduced resting current as well. The secretagogues prostaglandin E2, cyclic adenosine monophosphate and acetylcholine increased the current in both control biopsies and biopsies with villous atrophy but had no significant effect on epithelial resistance. CONCLUSIONS: Measurement of electrical resistance in duodenal biopsies can be used as an alternative method of quantifying permeability in pediatric biopsies.},

   abstract = {INTRODUCTION/AIM: In North America and Europe, the prevalence of celiac disease (CD) might be much greater than expected in previous estimates. Until recently, the prevalence of CD in Latin America remained largely unknown. So far, information regarding CD in Mexico is limited, and it is still considered a rare disease. Our aim was to determine the prevalence of tTGA in a large group of apparently healthy blood donors. SUBJECTS AND METHODS: Serum samples from 1009 consecutive blood donors, who attended a third level referral center in Mexico City, were collected between June 2004 and December 2004. Only Mexican Mestizo individuals were included. All sera were tested with a new generation human recombinant protein based tTGA-IgA ELISA commercial kit (Aeskulisa tTG-IgA, Wendelsheim, Germany). The cut-off value provided by the manufacturer was 15 U/mL. RESULTS: The mean age of the blood donors was 34+/-10 years and 68% (n=683) were men. Six hundred fifty two subjects (65%) were born in Mexico City; and from the remaining 357 subjects, at least one was born in each of the 31 different states in our country. Twenty-seven (2.7%) blood donors were positive for tTGA-IgA; all of them with tTGA-IgA values above 30 U/mL (range 36 to 1639). Overall prevalence was 1:37 [27/1009, 95% confidence interval (CI)=1.6-3.7]. The prevalence among women was 1:33 (10/326, 95% CI=1.04-5.09) and for men 1:40 (17/683, 95% CI=1.24-3.73). CONCLUSIONS: On the basis of a well-recognized serologic screening method performed to blood donor samples, we demonstrated an unexpectedly high prevalence of tTGA positivity (2.6%) in the adult Mexican Mestizo population. Thus, the prevalence of CD in Mexico could be higher or similar to that observed in other countries. This observation contributes to increase the awareness for this under diagnosed disease in clinical practice and to consider CD as a global health problem.},

METHODS: Patients were searched for five years in pathology records of our institution. The biopsy material was reassessed using strict histopathological criteria. Clinical data were obtained from medical records. RESULTS: Small-bowel NLH was diagnosed in 18 cases. The female: male ratio was 2:1. The most frequent symptoms were diarrhea (72%), involuntary weight loss (72%) and abdominal pain (61%). Nine patients (50%) had immunodeficiency. Small-bowel bacterial overgrowth was found in three (17%) cases. At small-bowel NLH diagnosis, three (17%) had associated lymphoma: two intestinal and one extra-intestinal lymphomas. In two patients with villous atrophy and anti-endomysial antibodies the diagnosis of celiac disease was established. Giardia lamblia infection was found in only one patient with hypogammaglobulinemia (Herman's syndrome). CONCLUSIONS: NLH is uncommon in adult patients. Associated diseases are immunodeficiency and lymphoid tissue malignancies.},

   abstract = {PURPOSE OF REVIEW: This review discusses the long-term health effects of breast feeding, based on the most relevant publications from the second half of 2004 and 2005. RECENT FINDINGS: The positive effect of breast feeding on later cognitive function continues to be the most consistent and important effect. Also, breast feeding is likely to protect against some immune-related diseases later in life, such as type 1 diabetes, coeliac disease, inflammatory bowel diseases and perhaps cancer. The evidence for an effect on allergic disease continues to be inconclusive. Furthermore, breast feeding seems to be associated with a lower blood pressure and serum cholesterol, but there is no clear association with cardiovascular disease or death. Most new studies and meta-analyses show a protective effect against later obesity, but this seems to be small. A new hypothesis suggests that breast feeding programmes the insulin-like growth factor axis and results in higher growth velocity later in childhood. SUMMARY: Evidence is increasing that breast feeding, beyond its well-established beneficial effects during the breast-feeding period, also confers long-term benefits. These effects are not strong at the individual level, but are likely to be of importance at the population level. Since the majority of the studies are observational, however, it is difficult to prove causality.},

   abstract = {There is increasing evidence that the magnitude and potential of intestinal nutrient absorption (sugars, fatty acids, cholesterol and triglycerides) and intestinal defense function are regulated by metabolic learning phenomena, and are influenced by dietary energy content and exercise. Metabolic overload syndromes, mainly obesity, and chronic malabsorption disorders such as inflammatory bowel disease and celiac disease have been defined as extreme phenotypes. Metabolic learning processes depend on developmental and transcriptional control systems of intestinal epithelial cell differentiation. The physiological differentiation zone of enterocytes is linked to the beta-catenin system, apolipoprotein apoA-IV and the master transcription factors Cdx2, HNF1alpha, and GATA4. In addition to these developmental regulatory transcription factors, nuclear receptors including RXR, LXR, PPAR, PXR, and CAR have been implicated in the generation of more absorptive enterocytes with a more differentiated phenotype on the one hand, and dedifferentiated cells with reduced capacity of detoxification and defense causing loss of junction control and barrier defects on the other. Large-scale analysis of gene expression profiles and identification of key pathways and master regulatory transcription factors will help dissect the role of nutritional and environmental factors as well as pharmacological intervention on mucosal homeostasis and disease, with potential applications for diagnosis and therapy.},

   abstract = {Celiac disease (CD) is an inflammatory small intestinal disorder that can lead to severe villous atrophy, malabsorption, and malignancy. It is triggered by the gluten proteins of wheat, barley, and rye. All patients express the antigen-presenting molecules human leukocyte antigen-DQ2 (HLA-DQ2) and/or HLA-DQ8, which bind gluten peptides and thus activate destructive intestinal T cells. Patients with untreated CD have circulating IgA autoantibodies to the enzyme tissue transglutaminase (tTG), a component of endomysium. Testing for serum IgA tTG has a high predictive value. Therapy of CD is a lifelong gluten-free diet. Counseling by an expert dietitian and association with a celiac support group are important in helping the patient embark on a healthy gluten-free diet. Current research focuses on non-dietary therapies and treatment of refractory (diet-unresponsive) CD.},

   abstract = {Celiac disease (CD) is a chronic disease causing inflammation of the proximal small intestine that occurs in genetically predisposed individuals when they eat gluten, which is the storage protein in wheat, barley, and rye. The disease injury usually resolves when gluten is excluded from the diet. Although the injury will heal, the reaction to gluten is permanent and will recur with the reintroduction of gluten. The condition is surprisingly common, affecting as many as 1% of white populations. The consequences of the disease are predominantly those of malnutrition due to maldigestion and malabsorption, such as diarrhea, weight loss, and anemia. Symptoms caused by inflammation of the small intestine are also common. CD, although it is common and its pathology is well understood, frequently goes undiagnosed, probably because of the nonspecific or vague nature of many of the symptoms that occur. The cornerstone of treatment for CD is elimination of gluten from the diet. In most patients diagnosed with CD, a strict gluten-free diet (GFD) alone should result in complete symptomatic and histologic resolution of the disease and reduce risk of complications. Noncompliance with diet is the leading cause of failure to respond in patients with CD. For these reasons, thorough assessment and counseling at the time of diagnosis and ongoing care are crucial. In this article, we address briefly what is known about the pathogenesis and diagnosis of CD and address its treatment in detail.},

   abstract = {OBJECTIVES: Ghrelin, a gastrointestinal hormone, has effects on nutrient intake and growth. Because celiac disease (CD) has intestinal histopathologic alterations and subsequent malnutrition and/or growth failure, we hypothesized that there would be alterations in serum ghrelin levels of those patients. In this study, we aimed to determine serum ghrelin levels in childhood CD, to observe probable alterations under gluten-free diet (GFD), and to see whether there is a relationship between ghrelin levels and the presentation of the disease and/or diet compliance. METHODS: Thirty-six children with CD and 10 healthy children were included. Serum fasting ghrelin level was measured using radioimmunoassay method. After 6 months under GFD, sera of 19 patients were retested for ghrelin level. RESULTS: Mean serum ghrelin levels in children with CD and in controls were 478.2+/-154.6 and 108.3+/-49.1 pg/mL, respectively (P<0.001). Serum ghrelin level was not different in different clinical presentations. Ghrelin was negatively correlated with body mass index, both in healthy children and in children with CD on admission (P<0.01). Ghrelin level was lower after 6 months under GFDcompared with the level detected on admission (P<0.001), but was still higher compared with that of healthy children (P<0.001). Strict diet compliance lowered ghrelin level, although not statistically. CONCLUSIONS: Ghrelin is increased in childhood CD and is responsive to GFD. Further studies are needed to clarify the mechanism underlying its action in CD.},

   abstract = {BACKGROUND: Celiac disease (CD) is common and, when undiagnosed, may result in increased mortality, suggesting that mass screening could be justified. The authors examined the cost-effectiveness (CE) of such an approach, assuming a higher mortality rate in undiagnosed CD and that adhering to a gluten-free diet (GFD) reduces the mortality rate. METHODS: The authors developed a state transition Markov model, evaluating the CE of screening an entire population at the age of 18. Screening strategies included no screening v. screening by IgA antiendomysial antibodies (EMA), IgA human antitissue transglutaminase antibodies (TTG), and TTG verified by EMA. All strategies were examined with and without evaluation for IgA deficiency, and they all included an intestinal biopsy. Effects of variables were examined using sensitivity analysis. Effectiveness was assessed by life expectancy for each strategy and the incremental average CE ratio for each. RESULTS: Base-case analysis revealed US$49,491 and US$572,616 per life year gained for screening compared to no screening using EMA or TTG, respectively. The CE of screening with EMA was most influenced by the prevalence of CD and the standardized mortality ratio (SMR) for untreated CD patients. Screening was cost-effective in populations with a relatively high prevalence of CD or when the SMR for untreated CD patients was higher than 1.5. The model was insensitive to changes in the cost of serological markers and diagnostic endoscopy. CONCLUSION: Assuming an SMR of 1.5 or higher for untreated CD patients, mass screening for CD is cost-effective in populations with a relatively high prevalence of CD over a wide range of ages at screening. From a CE perspective, EMA is the preferred serological marker for mass screening. Screening for CD would be justified only if the uncertainties regarding the validity of our assumptions are substantiated.},

   abstract = {OBJECTIVE: Celiac disease (CD) is characterized by chronic inflammation of the small intestinal mucosa with disturbed epithelial transport. The fatty acid (FA) composition of intestinal membranes is important for epithelial function, and disturbances may contribute to the pathophysiology of the disease. We aimed to evaluate whether the intestinal mucosal FA status was reflected in serum phospholipids of patients with CD. PATIENTS AND METHODS: Samples were obtained from 7 pediatric patients with active CD showing mucosal atrophy, 6 pediatric patients with CD in remission, and 11 control pediatric patients with morphologically healthy intestinal mucosa. Small intestinal biopsies were obtained using a Watson biopsy capsule under fluoroscopic control. Blood samples were collected on the same morning after an overnight fast. Tissue phospholipids were isolated by high-performance liquid chromatography, and FAs were analyzed by capillary gas-liquid chromatography. RESULTS: Serum phospholipid FA showed marginal differences between the patients with CD and the controls. Significant differences were observed in mucosa with active CD compared with controls. Linoleic acid (18:2n-6) level was decreased, whereas those of its derivatives were elevated, indicating increased transformation of n-6 FA. Mead acid (20:3n-9) level was increased, with an increased ratio of Mead acid to arachidonic acid (20:4n-6) levels, suggesting essential fatty acid deficiency. The n-3 FA levels were not significantly changed. During remission, the FA pattern of the intestinal mucosa was mainly similar to that in controls. CONCLUSIONS: The FA abnormality of intestinal mucosa in patients with active CD was not reflected in serum values. Altered FA content may contribute to the pathophysiology of the disease because FAs are important for enzymes and for the transport and receptor functions of epithelial membranes.},

METHODS: We interviewed 43 informants, aged 20-40 years, using 'The Critical Incident Technique'. Interviews focused on situations that gave rise to confusion or discomfort in relation to disease. The interviews were transcribed verbatim and analysed qualitatively. RESULTS: We found 195 dilemmas, experienced in five arenas: food situation at work, during purchases, when travelling, in relation to meals at home and meals outside the home. Emotions, relationships and the management of daily life were the three main categories of dilemmas that emerged through the analysis. Specific emotions were experienced in relation to the disease, such as isolation, shame, fear of becoming contaminated by gluten and worries about being a bother. In the relationship with other persons the informants experienced a number of complicating dilemmas such as unwanted visibility, neglect, being forgotten, disclosure avoidance and risk taking. Dilemmas related to the management of daily life were restricted product choice, double work and constantly being on call. CONCLUSIONS: The lived experiences of coeliac disease were more varied and profound than expected. It is important to take psychological and social aspects into account in the treatment of patients with coeliac disease.},

This study aims to identify the prevalence of celiac disease in a group of children with diabetes mellitus type 1 undergoing treatment in the pediatric endocrinology division of a university hospital in Minas Gerais, Brazil. METHODS: Immunoglobulin (Ig)A and IgG antigliadin antibodies (enzyme-linked immunoadsorbent assay) were measured in blood collected from 236 children and adolescents with diabetes mellitus type 1. Patients with antigliadin antibodies then had jejunal biopsy and determination of antiendomysial antibodies by indirect immunofluorescence. RESULTS: Twenty-one patients had IgA or IgG antigliadin antibodies. Nineteen underwent jejunal biopsy. Six had mucosal alterations compatible with celiac disease; four had nonspecific histologic changes; nine had normal biopsies. Thirteen antigliadin antibody-positive patients were antiendomysial antibody-negative; one antiendomysial antibody-negative patient had celiac disease. The prevalence of celiac disease was 2.6% among 234 patients. CONCLUSIONS: Measurement of antigliadin antibodies in patients with diabetes mellitus type 1 helped in the selection of patients to undergo jejunal biopsy. Antiendomysial antibodies were highly specific and moderately sensitive in predicting celiac disease. The prevalence of celiac disease was higher in diabetics than in the general population, suggesting the need for regular screening assessment of diabetic children.},

   abstract = {OBJECTIVE: To assess the degree of osteopenia in children with celiac disease (CD) at the time of diagnosis and the effect of a gluten-free diet (GFD). DESIGN: Longitudinal and prospective study. SUBJECTS: In total, 24 children (18 girls, six boys) diagnosed with CD by means of an intestinal biopsy were included in the study. Mean+/-s.d. age was 4.9+/-4.3 years. In all, 16 patients were under (2.20+/-0.82 year) and eight were over the age of 4 years (10.30+/-2.90 year). The time between the first symptoms and diagnosis was 17.30+/-24.70 months (range: 2-109 months). Spine bone mineral content (BMC), area and bone mineral density (BMD) were measured by DXA at baseline and 1.17+/-0.93 years after GFD. RESULTS: Before treatment, mean+/-s.d. BMD was 0.46+/-0.13 g/cm(2), the BMD Z-score was -1.36+/-1.20, and was below -1 s.d. in 14 patients (58%). BMC, area and BMD increased significantly on GFD. BMD increased from 0.46+/-0.13 to 0.55+/-0.13 g/cm(2) (P<0.001). BMD Z-score improved from -1.36+/-1.20 to -0.23+/-1.20 after GFD. However, BMD increased more than 1 s.d. in 15 of the 16 children under the age of 4 years, a similar increase was only observed in four of the eight children aged more than 4 years, some of whom did not follow GFD strictly. Height and weight increased significantly with GFD (P<0.001) and the increase correlated positively with the increase in BMD. CONCLUSIONS: Axial BMD below -1 s.d. was found in 58% of children with celiac disease. Axial bone mass reverted to normal values in most children under the age of 4, who had low bone mass, all of whom followed GFD strictly.},

   abstract = {OBJECTIVE: This survey was conducted to assess nutrient intakes and food consumption patterns of adults with coeliac disease who adhere to a strict gluten-free diet. DESIGN: Three-day estimated self-reported food records were used to assess daily intakes of calories, percent daily calories from carbohydrates, dietary fibre, iron, calcium and grain food servings. SUBJECTS: Volunteers for this survey were recruited through notices placed in coeliac disease support group newsletters, as well as a national magazine for persons with coeliac disease. Forty-seven volunteers met all criteria for participation and returned useable food records. RESULTS: Group mean daily intake of nutrients by gender: Males (n = 8): 2882 calories; 55% carbohydrate; 24.3 g dietary fibre; 14.7 mg iron; 1288.8 mg calcium; 6.6 grain food servings. Females (n = 39): 1900 calories; 52% carbohydrate; 20.2 g dietary fibre; 11.0 mg iron; 884.7 mg calcium; 4.6 grain food servings. Recommended amounts of fibre, iron and calcium were consumed by 46, 44 and 31% of women and 88, 100 and 63% of men, respectively. CONCLUSIONS: Nutrition therapy for coeliac disease has centred around food allowed/not allowed on a gluten-free diet. Emphasis also should be placed on the nutritional quality of the gluten-free diet, particularly as it concerns the iron, calcium and fibre consumption of women. The use of the estimated food record as the dietary survey method may have resulted in the under-reporting of energy intake. Due to the small sample size and possible bias of survey participants, the findings of this survey may not be representative of the larger coeliac community.},

   abstract = {OBJECTIVES: The aim of the study was to investigate the metabolic function of intestinal microflora in children with celiac disease (CD) in order to find out if there is a deviant gut flora in CD patients compared to healthy controls. METHODS: The study group comprised children with CD, consecutively diagnosed according to current criteria given by the European Society for Paediatric Gastroenterology, Hepatology, and Nutrition. Thirty-six children were studied at presentation, i.e., on a normal gluten-containing diet, with clinical symptoms and signs indicative of CD, positive celiac serology markers, and a small bowel biopsy showing severe enteropathy. Forty-seven patients were studied when they had been on a gluten-free diet (GFD) for at least 3 months. For comparison, a group of 42 healthy controls (HC) were studied. The functional status of the intestinal microflora was evaluated by gas-liquid chromatography of short chain fatty acids (SCFAs) in fecal samples. RESULTS: There was a significant difference between untreated CD children and HC as well as between treated CD children and HC regarding acetic, i-butyric, i-valeric acid, and total SCFAs. The propionic and n-valeric acids differed significantly between CD children on GFD and HC. Moreover, there was a strong correlation between i-butyric and i-valeric acids in all study groups. CONCLUSIONS: This is the first study of the SCFA pattern in fecal samples from children with CD. The results indicate that there is a difference in the metabolic activity of intestinal microbial flora in children with CD compared to that in HC. The finding of a different pattern of some SCFAs in celiacs both at presentation and during treatment with GFD indicates that it is a genuine phenomenon of CD not affected by either the diet, the inflammation, or the autoimmune status of the patient.},

   abstract = {We studied dietary risk factors by analysing a questionnaire administered at birth, 1 year and 2(1/2) years of age, as well as the level of glutamic acid decarboxylase autoantibodies (GADA) and tyrosine phosphatase autoantibodies (IA-2A), in 7208 2(1/2)-year-old children from the All Babies in Southeast Sweden cohort, using the 95th percentile cut-off for autoantibodies to identify children at risk of type 1 diabetes. A total of 657 children had either IA-2A (n 360) or GADA (n 335), and thirty-eight children had both GADA and IA-2A. In univariate analysis, male gender and maternal coeliac disease implied a risk of possessing IA-2A. Maternal type 2 diabetes, a high consumption of fresh cows milk at the age of 1 year and a late introduction of gluten were associated with a risk of GADA. Early cessation of breast-feeding (< 2 months of age) was associated with a risk of the simultaneous occurrence of both IA-2A and GADA. In logistic regression analysis, a high consumption of milk at the age of I year (odds ratio 2.6)represented a risk for GADA, and maternal coeliac disease (odds ratio 2.9) represented a risk for IA-2A. The combination of an early introduction of cows milk formula and a late introduction of gluten-containing food gave an odds ratio of 6.0 for positivity for at least one autoantibody at 1 and 21 years of age. The induction of autoantibodies by the age of 2(1/2) years has a male preponderance and is more common in children with maternal type 2 diabetes or maternal coeliac disease. Dietary risk factors for the induction of beta-cell autoantibodies in 21-year-old children are a short duration of breast-feeding, an early introduction of cows milk formula and a late introduction of gluten, as well as a high consumption of milk at the age of I year.},

   abstract = {Celiac disease is a gastrointestinal disorder characterized by inflammation, leading to injury to the mucosal lining of the small intestine. The inflammation occurs when gliadin, a protein found in such gluten-containing foods as wheat, rye, and barley, is ingested by genetically susceptible individuals. The mucosal damage and subsequent malabsorption of nutrients leads to various complications. Researchers estimate that more than 2 million people in the United States have celiac disease-a prevalence that is greater than was previously believed. Approximately 60,000 Americans are diagnosed annually with celiac disease. Until recently, diagnosis has been complicated by the fact that the indicators of celiac disease are nonspecific. However, because of the development of new, easy-to-administer serology tests, diagnosis has become much less complicated. After conducting a review of the literature, the authors recommend a serologic testing sequence for diagnosis of celiac disease and urge that adults and children with an assortment of symptoms be tested for this disease. Common signs and symptoms of celiac disease include anemia, arthralgia, fatigue, infertility, neuropathy, and weight loss, in addition to such gastrointestinal symptomatology as abdominal pain, anorexia, bloating, constipation, and diarrhea. The only treatment for patients with celiac disease remains a gluten-free diet.},

Histological examination of duodenal biopsy specimen showed a protracted infectious duodenitis and a secondary villous flattening of the small bowel. This diagnosis was a life-threatening illness that needed antibiotic treatment. These patients receive parenteral nutrition as long as the villous have not been recovered from the flattening.

   abstract = {UNLABELLED: OBJECTIVE We sought to evaluate the impact of the gluten-free diet on the 5,240 members of the Canadian Celiac Association (CCA). Data are presented on 2,681 adults (>or=16 years) with biopsy-proven celiac disease (CD). METHODS: A mail-out survey was used. Quality of life was evaluated using the 'SF12', and celiac-specific questions. RESULTS: Mean age was 56 years, mean age at diagnosis was 45 years, and 75% were female. The 'SF12' summary scores were similar to normative Canadian data, but were significantly lower for females and newly diagnosed patients. Respondents reported: following a gluten-free (GF) diet (90%), improvement on the diet (83%), and difficulties following the diet (44%), which included: determining if foods were GF (85%), finding GF foods in stores (83%), avoiding restaurants (79%), and avoiding travel (38%). Most common reactions to consumed gluten (among 73%) included pain, diarrhea, bloating, fatigue, nausea, and headache. Excellent information on CD and its treatment was provided by the CCA (64%), gastroenterologists (28%), dietitians (26%) and family doctor (12%). CONCLUSIONS: Quality of life in those with CD could be increased with early diagnosis, increased availability of gluten-free foods, improved food labelling, and better dietary instruction. Education of physicians and dietitians about CD and its treatment is essential.},
