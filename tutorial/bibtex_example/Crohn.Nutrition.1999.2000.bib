   abstract = {BACKGROUND: Glutamine is traditionally considered a nonessential amino acid but may be conditionally essential in patients with catabolic conditions. Glutamine-supplemented foods in these patients have been shown to prevent deterioration of gut permeability, protect against the development of intestinal mucosal atrophy, and improve nitrogen balance. Animal models of inflammatory bowel disease suggest that glutamine-enriched enteral diets may lead to less severe intestinal damage, less weight loss, improved nitrogen balance, and reduced disease activity. The purpose of the current study was to compare the efficacy of a glutamine-enriched polymeric diet with a standard low-glutamine polymeric diet in the treatment of active Crohn's disease. METHODS: Eighteen children with active Crohn's disease were randomly assigned to receive a 4-week course of either a standard polymeric diet with a low glutamine content (4% of amino acid composition; group S) or a glutamine-enriched polymeric diet (42% of amino acid composition; Group G). The two diets were isocaloric and isonitrogenous with an identical essential amino acid profile. Remission rates were analysed on an intent-to-treat basis. Changes in clinical and laboratory parameters of disease activity were also compared after 4 weeks of nutritional treatment. RESULTS: Two of the children, both in group G, were withdrawn from the trial because of nontolerance of the diet. There was no difference between the two groups in proportion of patients achieving remission (intent-to-treat basis): 5 (55.5%) of 9 in group S versus 4 (44.4%) of 9 in group G (p = 0.5). Improvement in mean paediatric Crohn's disease activity index (PCDAI) was significantly more in group S (p = 0.002) but changes in orosomucoid level, platelet count, and weight were not different between the groups. CONCLUSIONS: The findings suggest that a glutamine-enriched polymeric diet offers no advantage over a standard low-glutamine polymeric diet in the treatment of active Crohn's disease. Rather, it appears to be less effective in improving PCDAI. The reported beneficial effects of glutamine seen in many catabolic states must be viewed with caution when extrapolating to the management of Crohn's disease.},

   abstract = {BACKGROUND: Focus group meetings were held with two groups, each containing 12 children with Crohn's disease aged 8 to 12 and 12 to 17 years. The children were asked broad questions about how Crohn's disease and its treatment affected their lives. To explore these areas in more detail, an 88-item questionnaire was developed and read to an additional 16 of 20 children with Crohn's disease selected at random from outpatients. At first, many of the children denied that Crohn's disease affected their lives at all, but it soon became apparent that many were frustrated or angry about physical symptoms, lack of understanding about Crohn's disease, unpleasant investigations, treatment, and hospitalisation. METHODS: The questionnaire covered six domains of health-related quality of life including symptoms and treatment, social, emotional, family, educational, and future aspects. RESULTS: Elemental diet was the preferred treatment, although surgery was more effective in controlling symptoms. Children receiving steroids had more depressive symptoms. Absenteeism from school and inability to engage in school sports, swimming, and running were frequent problems. There were also difficulties with taking holidays and staying at friends' houses. Worry was reported in 14 of 16 children, anger and frustration and feeling fed up in 12 of 16. CONCLUSIONS: In addition to being a symptomatically disabling condition, Crohn's disease has a great impact on the health-related quality of life of affected children. Future studies of treatment in children with inflammatory bowel disease should include an attempt to assess the impact on the child's health-related quality of life.},

   abstract = {Weight loss and malnutrition are common features in patients with Crohn's disease. This study was designed to evaluate diet-induced thermogenesis and substrate oxidation in patients with Crohn's disease. Twenty-three patients (17 women, 6 men; age 34 +/- 2 y) and 17 healthy control subjects (13 women, 4 men; age 36 +/- 3 y) were studied. Resting energy expenditure and fasting substrate oxidation were measured by indirect calorimetry in the morning after an overnight fast. After a standard homogenized test meal (10 kcal/kg), indirect calorimetry was performed every 30 min for 3 h to measure the diet-induced thermogenesis and the postprandial substrate oxidation. In the fasting state, resting energy expenditure was significantly higher in patients than in control subjects (1433 +/- 43 versus 1279 +/- 53 kcal/24 h). Lipid oxidation was higher in patients with Crohn's disease than in control subjects (1.17 +/- 0. 07 versus 0.61 +/- 0.11 mg. kg(-1). min(-1), P < 0.01). Postprandially, diet-induced thermogenesis was significantly lower in patients with Crohn's disease than in control subjects (4.6% +/- 0.5 versus 6.3% +/- 0.5 of energy intake, P < 0.01). Lipid oxidation was significantly higher in patients with Crohn's disease than in control subjects (0.78 +/- 0.05 versus 0.56 +/- 0.08 mg. kg(-1). min(-1), P < 0.05), and glucose oxidation was lower in patients with Crohn's disease than in control subjects. In patients with Crohn's disease, lipid oxidation positively correlates with the disease activity evaluated by the Crohn's Disease Activity Index (r = 0.48, P150), fasting and postprandial lipid oxidation was significantly higher than in patients with inactive Crohn's disease (P < 0.05). In conclusion, patients with Crohn's disease have increased fat oxidation, which correlates with disease activity and this may explain the reduced fat stores in patients with Crohn's disease.},

   abstract = {The primary therapeutic effects of enteral nutrition in patients with Crohn's disease have been reported previously. Although the quantity and type of fat in enteral nutrition are considered to be important, it is unclear how fat modulates mucosal inflammatory responses in the intestine. In the present study, we evaluated the effects of medium-chain and long-chain fatty acids (MCFA and LCFA) on interleukin (IL)-8 secretion in a fetal intestinal epithelial cell line, intestine-407 cells. IL-8 expression was evaluated at the protein and mRNA levels. The activation of nuclear factor-kappaB was assessed with an electrophoretic gel mobility shift assay. The addition of oleic acid (LCFA) micelles, but not octanoic acid (MCFA) micelles, weakly but significantly enhanced basal IL-8 secretion in the intestine-407 cells. The addition of MCFA (5 mmol/L) induced a 40% increase in IL-1beta-induced IL-8 secretion and a 35% increase in tumor necrosis factor (TNF)-alpha-induced IL-8 secretion, respectively. The addition of LCFA (5 mmol/L) induced a 140% increase in IL-1beta-induced IL-8 secretion and a 110% increase in TNF-alpha-induced IL-8 secretion, respectively. These responses were also observed at the mRNA levels. The electrophoretic gel mobility shift assay indicated that both MCFA and LCFA enhanced IL-1beta- and TNF-alpha-induced nuclear factor-kappaB activation. We demonstrated the proinflammatory activities of MCFA and especially LCFA. It is likely that medium-chain triglycerides may be more suitable than long-chain triglycerides as an energy source in enteral diets in the treatment of patients with Crohn's disease.},

DESIGN: A prospective, observational study of patients with Crohn's disease in whom PEG tubes were placed for nutritional support or TEN. SETTING: A specialist nutrition clinic at a gastroenterology tertiary referral centre in Harrow, UK. PARTICIPANTS: Nine patients with Crohn's disease. Seven patients had nutritional failure and were unable to tolerate nasogastric feeding, and two patients were recruited in whom TEN therapy for active disease was indicated. The age range was 21-52 years (median, 30 years). Five patients were female; all had had previous ileo-colonic resections, one had a gastro-enterostomy and one had a non-healing Crohn's-related gastric ulcer. INTERVENTIONS: PEG insertion (Fresenius, Frecka 9 Fr) was performed at endoscopy with intravenous sedation. Follow-up with tubes in situ was for a median of 37 weeks (range, 4-276 weeks), and for a further median of 80 weeks (range, 52-120 weeks) in those whose tubes have been removed. MAIN OUTCOME MEASURES: The level of disease activity, nutritional status/body mass index and any complications associated with PEG tube placement were recorded. RESULTS: PEG was achieved in all patients; the only complication was a minor superficial entry site infection. Five patients continue to use PEG feeding to good effect, including healing of the Crohn's-associated ulcer. One patient now eats normally having regained target weight, and three require parenteral nutrition, having failed to achieve nutritional sufficiency despite an optimal enteral regimen via the PEG. An adverse body image in one of these patients (an opiate abuser with a long psychiatric history) was probably contributory to PEG failure. There was no peristomal or fistulous disease. CONCLUSIONS: Although nutrition via PEG is not always successful, failures are of enteral nutrition, and not of the means. PEG use in selected patients with Crohn's disease appears safe and can prove a useful addition to therapeutic options.},

Recent studies show that apoptosis may play an important role in the regulation of gut-associated lymphoid tissues (GALT). Therefore, this study was performed to clarify apoptosis of lymphocytes in the peripheral blood and colonic mucosa of UC. METHODS: Three-color flow cytometry was used to clarify apoptosis of lymphocytes in the peripheral blood and colonic mucosa of patients with active and inactive UC compared with controls using fluorescence-labeled monoclonal and polyclonal antibodies such as Fas (CD95), Fas ligand, CD4, CD8, CD45RO, etc. RESULTS: The ratio of Fas and CD45RO double-positive cells in the peripheral blood of UC patients was significantly increased in CD8 but not CD4 T cells when compared with controls. The ratio of Fas-positive and CD45RO-negative cells was significantly increased in CD4 and CD8 T cells of UC when compared with controls. There was unbalanced immunoregulation between CD4 and CD8 T cells in the colonic mucosa of UC probably due to apoptosis through Fas-Fas ligand system. CONCLUSIONS: Abnormal GALT system was found in UC probably due to dysregulation of T cells through Fas-Fas ligand system.},

   abstract = {A retrospective survey on home parenteral nutrition (HPN) in Europe was performed from January to December 1997. Data were compared to a similar study performed in 1993. A questionnaire of HPN practice was designed by the members of the ESPEN-HAN group. This involved adult patients (older than 16 years) newly registered in an HPN program between 1 January and 31 December 1997 and included: number of patients, underlying diseases and a 6-12 month outcome. Incidence and prevalence (at 1.1.1998) of adult HPN were calculated according to the estimated total population in 1997 for the countries in which more than 80% of HPN patients were reported.A total of 494 patients were registered in 73 centres from nine countries (Belgium (B), Denmark (D), France (F), Poland (P), Spain (S), Sweden (Sw), United Kingdom (UK), The Netherlands (N) and Germany (G). The underlying diseases for HPN in 494 patients were cancer (39%), Crohn's (19%), vascular diseases (15%), radiation enteritis (7%), AIDS (2%), other diseases with intestinal failure (18%). Incidence (patients/million inhabitants/year) were in N (3), F. (2.9), D. (2.8), B. (2.6), UK (1. 2), S (0.7) and P (0.36), respectively. Prevalence were in D. (12.7). U.K. (3.7), N. (3.7), F (3.6), B (3.0), P (1.1), S (0.65). After this 6-12 months follow-up (n=284), the mortality was respectively 4% in Crohn's disease, 13% in vascular diseases, 16% in others, 21% in radiaton enteritis, 34% in AIDS, 74% in cancer. Incidences and prevalences modestly increased in these seven European countries in 1997 in comparison to 1993. The percentages of underlying diseases in these countries remained similar except for AIDS that significantly decreased (from 7% to 2%). Outcomes did not significantly differ in the 4-year period except for AIDS (34% instead of 88% mortality) and could have been related to newer, more efficacious therapy.},

The aim of therapy is to induce and then maintain disease remission and thereby promote well-being and normal growth and development. Enteral nutrition (either polymeric or elemental) is effective and used as initial therapy. This is employed as sole therapy over a 6- to 8-week period followed by a period of controlled food reintroduction. The relapse rate is high and further courses of enteral nutrition or alternative therapies are frequently required. Corticosteroids are also effective as initial therapy and are required in difficult cases but there are problems with their long term use, particularly their adverse effects on growth. Many patients develop either corticosteroid-dependent or corticosteroid-resistant disease. In this instance, additional immunosuppression, such as azathioprine, can be used. Surgery is required for those patients with disease resistant to medical therapy and this will result in remission; however, the relapse rate with surgery is high. There are many areas for future research. Very little is known about why enteral nutrition works, how long it should be given or its role as maintenance therapy. Newer immunosuppressive strategies based on cytokine modulation may be helpful in children once more experience is gained from their use in adults.},

The first evidence of the importance of dietary intake of n-3 polyunsaturated fatty acids was derived from epidemiologic observations of the low incidence of inflammatory bowel disease in Eskimos. The aim of this paper was to briefly review the literature on the use of n-3 fatty acids in inflammatory bowel disease (ulcerative colitis and Crohn disease), the results of which are controversial. The discrepancies between studies may reside in the different study designs used as well as in the various formulations and dosages used, some of which may lead to a high incidence of side effects. Choosing a formulation that lowers the incidence of side effects, selecting patients carefully, and paying strict attention to experimental design are critical when investigating further the therapeutic potential of these lipids in inflammatory bowel disease.},

   abstract = {OBJECTIVE: We set out to determine the direct costs of hospitalizations of patients with Crohn's disease and ulcerative colitis admitted to a university-affiliated tertiary care hospital and to contrast the costs of medical versus surgical inpatient care, Crohn's disease versus ulcerative colitis, and to identify dominant components of inpatient costs. METHODS: We used a patient-specific case costing system at Saint Boniface General Hospital, Winnipeg, Manitoba, for fiscal years 1994 and 1995. We extracted all inpatients whose hospital discharge abstracts included ICD-9-CM codes 555 (Crohn's disease) and 556 (ulcerative colitis) among the top eight discharge diagnoses, and performed a chart review on all cases to ensure that the hospitalization was for inflammatory bowel disease and the diagnoses were accurate. We analyzed cases based on their disease diagnosis, primary mode of therapy associated with the hospitalization (medical vs surgical), and their major diagnosis-related group (DRG). This study evaluated direct patient care costs only and costs are expressed in Canadian dollars. RESULTS: Of 362 hospital admissions, 325 were eligible and of these admissions 275 belonged to the digestive system DRGs. Seventy-one (37%) were admitted more than once during the 2 yr of the study, accounting for 202 (62%) of the total number of admissions. The mean cost per admission of all cases of Crohn's disease was $3,149 (95% confidence interval [CI], $2,665-$3,634) and for ulcerative colitis was $3,726 (95% CI $3,008-$4,445). Surgical therapy cases accounted for 49.8% of all admissions, 57.8% of all hospital days, and 60.5% of all costs. Patients treated surgically had more costly hospitalizations than those treated medically, particularly when analyzing only nontotal parenteral nutrition (TPN) cases. Surgical treatment admissions were significantly more costly for ulcerative colitis digestive DRG admissions than Crohn's disease. The nondigestive DRG admissions were more costly than the digestive DRGs in all categories although this was only statistically different among medically treated Crohn's disease. Patients treated medically were similarly costly whether they had Crohn's disease or ulcerative colitis. There was no significant difference in cost per admission among cases admitted multiple times, compared with those admitted only once. TPN cases accounted for 9.5% of cases but 27.1% of costs. TPN-associated hospitalizations were more costly than non-TPN-use hospitalizations but these costs were primarily driven by duration of stay rather than TPN use itself. For all cases, the top five cost categories in descending order were nursing unit bed-days, drugs and pharmacy, diagnostic lab tests, operating room, and diagnostic imaging and endoscopy. CONCLUSIONS: Using our system we could determine direct costs for inpatients with inflammatory bowel disease and the factors that determined increased costs. Medical therapy admissions were similarly costly between Crohn's disease and ulcerative colitis; however, surgical therapy admissions were costlier among ulcerative colitis patients. Admissions for nondigestive DRGs were more costly than those for digestive DRGs. TPN use identified a sicker group of patients who remained in the hospital longer than nonusers and, not surprisingly, these were the costliest patients.},

   abstract = {UNLABELLED: The main adverse effects of salazopyrin are usually dose-dependent and mild. Exceptionally, idiosyncratic reactions occur which may be life-threatening. CASE REPORTS: Two 10-year old children were treated for Crohn's disease with salazopyrin. At day 21 and day 10 respectively, pharyngitis, rash, and fever were noted. During the following days, high-grade fever persisted, while jaundice, severe cytolysis and acute liver failure also occurred. Drug hepatotoxicity was suspected and salazopyrin was withdrawn on day 29 and day 24 respectively. Development of hepatic encephalopathy led to urgent liver transplantation in both cases. CONCLUSION: Salazopyrin is a possible cause of fulminant immunoallergic hepatitis. Prompt therapeutic interruption is urgent, but it may not alter the outcome and or preclude the need for liver transplantation. We suggest that salazopyrin therapy be avoided in pediatric inflammatory bowel disease whenever possible, and that the use of pure amino-salicylates be preferred.},

   abstract = {OBJECTIVE: To evaluate the efficacy of oral tacrolimus as an induction agent in steroid-refractory severe colitis. STUDY DESIGN: Open-label, multicenter trial of oral tacrolimus in patients with severe colitis. Patients not responding to conventional therapy received tacrolimus, 0.1 mg/kg/dose given twice a day, and the dosage was adjusted to achieve blood levels between 10 and 15 ng/mL. Response was defined as improvement in a number of clinical parameters (including abdominal pain, diarrhea, rectal bleeding, and cessation of transfusions). Patients who responded by 14 days continued to receive tacrolimus, and 6-mercaptopurine or azathioprine was added as a steroid-sparing agent 4 to 6 weeks after the tacrolimus was instituted. RESULTS: Fourteen patients were enrolled in the study. One patient elected to withdraw after 48 hours. Of the 13 remaining, 9 (69%) responded and were discharged. Tacrolimus was continued for 2 to 3 months in the responders, except for 1 patient who was given tacrolimus for 11 months. After 1 year of follow-up, only 5 (38%) patients were receiving maintenance therapy; the other 4 responders had undergone colectomy. CONCLUSION: Although tacrolimus is effective induction therapy for severe ulcerative or Crohn's colitis, fewer than 50% of patients treated will successfully achieve a long-term remission.},

No infectious etiology has been identified, and CRMO has been associated with a number of autoimmune diseases (including Wegener's granulomatosis and psoriasis). The relationship between CRMO and inflammatory bowel disease is poorly described. Through an internet bulletin board subscribed to by 500 pediatric gastroenterologists, we identified six inflammatory bowel disease patients (two with ulcerative colitis, four with Crohn's colitis) with confirmed CRMO. In all cases, onset of the bony lesions preceded the onset of bowel symptoms by as much as five years. Immunosuppressive therapy for the bowel disease generally resulted in improvement of the bone inflammation. Chronic recurrent multifocal osteomyelitis should be considered in any inflammatory bowel disease patient with unexplained bone pain or areas of uptake on bone scan. CRMO may be a rare extraintestinal manifestation of inflammatory bowel disease; alternatively, certain individuals may be genetically predisposed to the development of both diseases.},

STUDY DESIGN: A case-control study. SUBJECTS: Forty CD patients with inactive disease were randomly divided into two groups. Group A (10 men; aged 33.9+/-7.2 years; BMI, 21.8+/-1.7 kg/m2) received a conventional polymeric enteral diet, while group B (10 men; aged 35.6+/-6.8 years; BMI, 21.4+/-1.8 kg/m2) was administered a soy-rich and lactose-free polymeric diet, over a 4-week period. METHODS: All the patients had a clinical and laboratory examination. Body composition was assessed by isotopic dilution and resting metabolic rate (RMR), and substrate oxidation rates were measured by indirect calorimetry. RESULTS: Body weight significantly increased after treatment in both groups (A, P<0.05; and B, P<0.01), as well as fat-free mass (A, P<0.05; and B, P<0.05) and fat mass (A, P<0.05; and B, P<0.01). RMR slightly increased, although it did not reach statistical significance. Treatment did not influence substrate oxidation rates. Group B lactose-intolerant patients reported a greater compliance-to-treatment than those in group A. CONCLUSIONS: This study showed that a polymeric enteral diet rich in vegetable protein and not containing milk protein, eaten at home, with no need for positioning a nasogastric tube, significantly improved body composition in inactive and lactose-intolerant CD patients, with no effect on energy metabolism, suggesting that it could be useful in improving nutritional status in these patients.},

   abstract = {An impairment of nutritional status up to real malnutrition can frequently be associated to gastrointestinal diseases. The diseases of the gastrointestinal tract can be divided into five groups: those hampering the nutrient physiological transit (especially neoplastic diseases); those affecting the intestinal mucosa (such as chronic inflammatory bowel disease); those determining intraluminal maldigestion; the hepato-biliary diseases and finally, the diseases of the pancreas. In order to correctly evaluate the nutritional status of an individual, besides the determination of the common biochemical parameters, body composition by direct and indirect techniques and energy metabolism by indirect calorimetry should be measured. Patients affected by Crohn's disease showed a lower fat mass content along with higher lipid oxidation compared to patients affected by ulcerative colitis. Patients with coeliac disease at diagnosis had a reduction in both fat and fat-free mass content along with an increased utilisation of carbohydrates as fuel substrate. There are many factors potentially leading to severe malnutrition in pancreatic diseases, especially in the acute form. Due to the primary role played by the liver in the metabolism of energy substrates, an impaired nutritional status might be commonly found in cirrhotic patients. In this connection, our group reported an increased energy expenditure and lipid oxidation, and an insulin-resistant state in compensated liver cirrhotic patients. These alterations seemed to precede and probably to lead to liver-disease-related malnutrition.},

AIMS: To evaluate the influence of a family history on Crohn's disease course and severity. METHODS: 1316 patients followed in the same unit were studied retrospectively. Age at onset, duration of illness, site, and extent of disease were determined in patients with and without a family history. Additionally, disease severity was estimated by the need for medical therapy (steroid and immunosuppressive requirement) and the frequency and extent of excisional surgery. RESULTS: 152 (12%) patients had a family history of inflammatory bowel disease. Duration of follow up was longer in patients with a family history and there were more operations for perforating complications in familial cases. However, the importance of medical therapy, and the incidence and extent of excisional surgery were similar in familial and and sporadic cases. Kaplan-Meier estimated time to prescription of immunosuppressive drugs and first intestinal resection were similar in familial and sporadic cases. When the 152 patients with familial Crohn's disease were paired for sex, location of disease at onset, date of birth, and date of diagnosis with 152 patients sporadic Crohn's disease, the disease severity remained similar in the two groups of paired patients. CONCLUSION: Patients with Crohn's disease and a family history of inflammatory bowel disease do not have a more severe course.},

   abstract = {PURPOSE: The aim of this study was to compare the length of postoperative ileus in patients undergoing colectomy by either laparotomy or laparoscopy. METHODS: A total of 166 patients were studied. These patients were divided into two groups: Group 1, in which colectomy was done laparoscopically, and Group 2, consisting of patients undergoing laparotomy. Both groups contained 83 patients who were matched for disease severity, indications for surgery, and procedure. Indications for surgery included sigmoid diverticulitis in 12 (14 percent) patients, polyps in 22 (27 percent), Crohn's disease in 21 (25 percent), colorectal cancer in 11 (13 percent), stoma reversal in 8 (10 percent), rectal prolapse in 3 (4 percent), and other indications in 6 (7 percent) in each group. Operations were colectomy with anastomosis (42 ileocolic, 26 colorectal, 6 colocolic, 4 ileorectal, and 2 ileal J pouch) or without anastomosis (3 abdominoperineal resections) performed by the same surgeons during the same time period January 1993 to October 1996). The nasogastric tube was removed from all patients immediately after surgery in both groups. All patients received a clear liquid diet on the first postoperative day, followed by a regular diet as tolerated. The nasogastric tube was reinserted if two or more episodes of emesis of more than 200 ml occurred in the absence of bowel movement. Patients were discharged from the hospital when tolerating a regular diet without evidence of ileus. Statistical analysis was performed using unpaired t-test and Fisher's exact probability test. RESULTS: The male-to-female ratio was 38 to 45 in both groups. A total of 10 (12 percent) and 23 (28 percent) patients in Group 1 and Group 2 had emesis (P = 0.02), and the rate of nasogastric tube reinsertion was 5 (6 percent) and 13 (16 percent), respectively (P > 0.05). There were significant differences between Groups 1 and 2 relative to the lengths of ileus (3.5 +/- 1.3 vs. 5.4 +/- 1.7 days, respectively; P < 0.001), hospitalization (6.6 +/- 3.3 vs. 8.1 +/- 2.5 days, respectively; P < 0.002), and operative time (170 +/- 60 vs. 114 +/- 46 minutes, respectively; P < 0.001). The morbidity rate was 16 (19.2 percent) and 18 (21.6 percent) in the laparoscopy and laparotomy groups, respectively. CONCLUSIONS: Although early oral intake is safe and can be tolerated by 84 percent of patients after colectomy by laparotomy, laparoscopic colectomy reduced the lengths of both postoperative ileus and hospitalization.},

   abstract = {OBJECTIVE: inflammatory bowel disease (IBD), total parenteral nutrition (TPN) and immunosuppressive treatment with cyclosporin A (CsA) are well known factors in hepatobiliary disorders. Their association, however, has been little studied. METHOD: we retrospectively analyzed the results of liver function tests (transaminases, AST. ALT), total bilirubin, alkaline phosphatase, and gamma-glutamyltransferase (GGT) in a consecutive series of 50 patients (29 men, 21 women, mean age 32 years, range 16-78 years) hospitalized for a severe attack of IBD between January 1992 and July 1997. Basal laboratory values in all patients were normal. Thirty-eight patients had ulcerative colitis (UC) and 12 had Crohn's disease (CD), which debuted in 28% of the patients. All patients were treated with methylprednisolone (MP) (0.75-1.0 mg/kg daily i.v., and received TPN. 42% (21/50) required additional treatment with CsA (5 mg/kg daily i.v.) at the beginning or during the first week of TPN and during 7-24 days, because on nonresponse to steroid treatment. Two study groups were defined according to treatment: Group I consisted of 29 patients given MP + TPN, and group II comprised 21 patients who received MP + TPN + CsA. The groups were otherwise similar in all other variables analyzed. Liver function tests were done weekly until the end of the study period. RESULTS: 62% of the patients (31/50) showed hepatobiliary dysfunction, defined previously as a 2-fold or greater elevation of two or more parameters. There was no statistically significant difference between the two groups in the incidence of dysfunction (15/29 vs 16/21, n.s.). The parameters that showed the greatest alterations were GGT and ALT; the greatest elevation appeared during the third week of immunosuppressive treatment, and did not exceed 6-fold the normal value. The alterations disappeared once TPN and immunosuppressive treatment were discontinued. CONCLUSIONS: the hepatobiliary dysfunction in patients treated with both TPN and CsA was no more severe than associated with TPN alone.},

   abstract = {BACKGROUND: The transcription factor, interferon regulatory factor (IRF)-1, is stimulated by interferon-gamma and regulates the expression of several genes implicated in the pathogenesis of inflammatory bowel disease, including interleukin-6, major histocompatibility complex class II molecules, and inducible nitric oxide synthase. Interferon regulatory factor-1 also stimulates naive CD4+ T-cells to differentiate into T-helper-1 cells, the T-cell subset that appears to be upregulated in Crohn's disease. The purpose of this study was to examine the expression of IRF-1 in the nuclei of lamina propria mononuclear cells in situ in colonoscopic biopsy specimens from pediatric patients with Crohn's disease, in patients with ulcerative colitis, and in control patients with no histopathologic abnormalities. METHODS: Archival paraffin-embedded tissue sections were obtained from 25 pediatric patients with Crohn's disease, 6 patients with ulcerative colitis, and 12 control patients who had undergone colonoscopy. Tissue sections were stained with polyclonal rabbit anti-human antisera to IRF-1 and horseradish-peroxidase-conjugated, biotinylated, goat anti-rabbit secondary antibody. Slides were scored and scores compared among patient groups using analysis of variance. RESULTS: Patients with Crohn's disease had significantly higher IRF-1 scores (95% confidence interval [CI], 1.70-2.04) than patients with ulcerative colitis (95% CI, 0.92-1.23) or control subjects (95% CI, 1.11-1.52). CONCLUSIONS: Increased expression of IRF-1 in lamina propria mononuclear cells from patients with Crohn's disease may be relevant to the pathogenesis of Crohn's disease.},

   abstract = {OBJECTIVE: The aim of this study was to evaluate the demographics, resource use, and costs associated with hospitalization of Crohn's disease patients. METHODS: All patients hospitalized at our institution from 7/1/96 to 6/30/97 with a primary diagnosis of "Crohn's Disease" were analyzed using a computerized database. Data are presented "per hospitalization." RESULTS: A total of 175 hospitalizations (147 patients) were identified. Mean patient age was 36.5 yr; 61% were female; 82% Caucasian. Payer mix was most commonly contracted (57%), commercial (21%), or Medicare (13%). 57% of hospitalizations had a primary surgical procedure; the remainder were medical. Average length of stay was 8.7 days (surgical, 9.6 days; medical, 7.5 days). The average cost of hospitalization, excluding physician fees, was $12,528 (surgical, $14,409; medical, $10,020), whereas average charges were $35,378 (surgical, $46,354; medical, $20,744), including physician fees, which averaged $7,249 (surgical, $11,217; medical, $1,959). Mean reimbursements were $21,968 (surgical, $28,946; medical, $12,666) with average weighted reimbursement rates of 60.17% of hospital charges, 69.57% of physician fees. The distribution of costs across subcategories was: Surgery (39.6%), Pharmacy (18.6%), Laboratory (3.8%), Radiology (2.1%), Pathology (0.8%), Endoscopy (0.3%), and Other Hospital Costs (34.9%). Of the hospitalizations, 87% included treatment with steroids, 23% with immunomodulators, and 14% with aminosalicylates; 27% included the administration of total parenteral nutrition, which accounted for 63% of the total pharmacy costs. CONCLUSIONS: Surgery accounts for the majority of hospitalizations, nearly 40% of their total costs, and 75% of overall charges and reimbursements. Therapy that decreases the number of surgical hospitalizations should substantially reduce inpatient Crohn's disease costs, as well as overall costs.},

AIM: To assess the factors determining the harmful effect of smoking in individuals with Crohn's disease. METHODS: A total of 622 consecutive patients with Crohn's disease and Crohn's disease activity index <200 were enrolled in a prospective 12-18 month cohort study. Patients were classified as current smokers, former smokers, or non-smokers. Alcohol consumption, oral contraceptive use, body mass index, and blood lipid levels were also recorded. The main outcome measure was the rate of flare-up. RESULTS: A total of 139 current smokers (46%) developed a flare-up, vs. 79 non-smokers (30%) and 13 former smokers (23%). The relative risk of flare-up adjusted for confounding factors was 1.35 (1.03-1.76) in current smokers. This risk was increased in patients with previously inactive disease and in those who had no colonic lesions. It became significant above a threshold of 15 cigarettes per day. Former smokers behaved like non-smokers. Obesity, dyslipidaemia, and alcohol consumption had no significant effect. CONCLUSIONS: Current smoking, particularly heavy smoking, markedly increases the risk of flare-up in Crohn's disease. Former smokers have a risk similar to that of non-smokers.},

AIM: To assess the effect of oral contraceptive use on the clinical course of Crohn's disease. PATIENTS: 331 women, aged 16-50 years, with Crohn's disease and Crohn's disease activity index <200, were enrolled consecutively during a one year period. Patients were classified at inclusion as oral contraceptive users or non-users and smokers or non-smokers. METHODS: A prospective 12-18 month cohort study was used. The main outcome measures were flare up rate and time to flare up. RESULTS: In total, 134 women used oral contraceptives, in most cases low oestrogen formulations. During the study period, 61 oral contraceptive users (46%) developed a flare up, compared with 85 non-users (43%). The hazard ratio for oral contraceptive use was 1.11 (95% confidence interval 0.80 to 1.55). Variables associated with flare up were smoking status, recently active disease, baseline Crohn's disease activity index, and presence of anoperineal lesions. The same results were obtained when the analysis was restricted to patients eligible for a relapse prevention trial. CONCLUSION: Unlike smoking, oral contraceptives have no effect on Crohn's disease activity.},

   abstract = {INTRODUCTION: Innovative surgical and pharmacological therapeutic measures in short-bowel syndrome (SBS) are constantly changing the prognosis of this devastating condition. The aim of this paper is to present our most recent experience in the treatment of this disease, with particular emphasis on the impact of home parenteral nutrition (HPN) and the use of growth hormone (GH). METHODS: A group of 8 patients with severe SBS have been studied for the past 4 years. Intestinal length of less than 25% normal at the time of bowel resection was the criterion for inclusion in this study. RESULTS: Mean age at the time of diagnosis was 2 years (ranging from 1 day to 9 years). The etiology of the SBS was Hirschsprung's disease (n = 3), midgut volvulus (n = 2), gastroschisis (n = 1), omphalocele with ileal atresia and necrotizing enterocolitis (n = 1) and Crohn's disease (n = 1). Length of the residual bowel was 8 and 50 cm with ileocecal valve (ICV) preservation and 23, 27, 30, 50, 70, 100 cm without ICV. Sixty percent of the patients survived. Two patients died due to fulminant gram-negative sepsis and one due to cardiac malformation. Two patients are still on parenteral nutrition (PN) providing 30 and 60% of total calories. Human GH (0.3 U/kg/day) was used in two patients over a period of 28 days. In these patients, an increased tolerance to enteral feeding was observed. HPN was provided in 5 cases, allowing regular school attendance in 3 patients. In 3 cases, discontinuation of the PN was achieved at 24, 25 and 35 months respectively. CONCLUSIONS: Human GH can improve tolerance of enteral feeding. HPN has a beneficial effect on child behaviour. Intestinal transplantation must be considered when no other surgical or medical measures are available.},

   abstract = {BACKGROUND: Labeled leukocyte imaging is a helpful diagnostic tool in the detection of inflammation and sepsis. The technetium Tc 99m hexamethyl propylene amine oxime (99mTc HMPAO)-labeled leukocyte scan has been found to be more sensitive than the Indium-111 labeled leukocyte scan in detecting inflammatory bowel disease, with reported sensitivities of 95% to 100%. Experience with the 99mTc HMPAO-labeled leukocyte scan was examined and its clinical applications evaluated in the immediate treatment of patients with inflammatory bowel disease. METHODS: A retrospective chart review was undertaken that included pediatric patients who underwent 99mTc HMPAO-labeled leukocyte scan at the James Whitcomb Riley Hospital for Children. The disease activity of patients with inflammatory bowel disease was assessed. The leukocyte scan was performed according to the manufacturer's specifications, and images were obtained 30 minutes and 2 hours after administration of the radiopharmaceutical. RESULTS: During the period of July 1996 through November 1997, 41 scans were performed in 35 patients. Twenty-nine patients had histologically proven inflammatory bowel disease: 24 with Crohn's disease, 4 with ulcerative colitis, and 1 with indeterminate colitis. Active inflammatory bowel disease was suspected in 24 patients when the leukocyte scan was performed. Twenty of the 24 patients (83% sensitivity) had abnormal findings in leukocyte scans that prompted more aggressive management in 15 (75%). Six of the 15 who were receiving maximum medical therapy underwent surgical resection of severely affected bowel segments, and medical treatment was intensified in the other 9. The remaining 5 patients were receiving optimal medical therapy, instituted at their recent visit, and did not require further medication adjustments. Four of the 24 patients with active inflammatory bowel disease had normal leukocyte scans (17% false-negative rate), 3 of whom were receiving corticosteroid therapy at the time the scans were performed. All of the 11 patients in whom inflammatory bowel disease was in remission and 6 patients who did not have inflammatory bowel disease had normal findings in leukocyte scans (100% specificity). CONCLUSIONS: Although a tissue diagnosis is still recommended, obtained during upper and lower gastrointestinal endoscopic examinations, and contrast radiography of the small bowel for the initial work-up of patients with suspected inflammatory bowel disease, the 99mTc HMPAO-labeled leukocyte scan is a safe and useful diagnostic adjunct for subsequent evaluation of patients known to have inflammatory bowel disease. The results of 99mTc HMPAO-labeled leukocyte scans directly influenced treatment of 75% of the study patients with active inflammatory bowel disease, which included the decision to refer patients for surgical intervention.},

   abstract = {BACKGROUND: Glutamine is a major fuel and an important nitrogen source for the small intestinal cell. It plays a key role in maintaining mucosal cell integrity and gut barrier function. Increased permeability may be a factor in the pathogenesis of Crohn's disease and may be an interesting parameter in the follow-up of the disease. Therefore, the aim of this study was to examine whether oral glutamine supplements are able to restore an increased intestinal permeability in patients with Crohn's disease. METHODS: The inclusion criteria for the study were Crohn's disease and a disturbed small intestinal permeability for 51Cr-EDTA. Of 38 patients screened, 18 had an increased permeability (6 hours urinary excretion >1.1% of label recovered in urine). Fourteen patients were included in the study and were randomized to receive either oral glutamine (7 g three times per day; n = 7) or placebo (7 g glycine three times per day; n = 7) in addition to their normal treatment during a 4-week period. The study was performed in a double-blind manner. RESULTS: Baseline permeability (mean +/- SD) was 2.32%+/-0.77% dose in the glutamine group and 2.29%+/-0.67% dose in the placebo group. Permeability did not change significantly after glutamine (3.26%+/-2.15% dose) or after placebo (2.27%+/-1.32% dose). There was no significant effect on plasma glutamine, plasma glutamate, plasma ammonium, Crohn's disease activity index, C-reactive protein, or nutritional status. CONCLUSIONS: Oral glutamine supplements, in the dose administered, do not seem to restore impaired permeability in patients with Crohn's disease.},

   abstract = {BACKGROUND: In earlier studies, erythromycin stimulated but octreotide inhibited gastric antral contractions, as each drug induced phase 3-like episodes. METHODS: To assess the effect of erythromycin pretreatment on octreotide-induced changes in antroduodenal motility, 16 patients were studied (mean age, 8.7 +/- 1.5 years, 8 male): 6 with severe gastroesophageal reflux, 4 with cyclic vomiting, 3 with gastroparesis, 2 with chronic intestinal pseudo-obstruction, and 1 with Crohn's disease and unexplained nausea and vomiting. After recording fasting antroduodenal motility for 3 hours, 1 mg/kg intravenous erythromycin was administered over 30 minutes. Sixty minutes after the erythromycin infusion, 0.5 microg/kg subcutaneous octreotide was administered, followed 1 hour later by a meal. RESULTS: Phase 3 occurred spontaneously in 10 patients and after erythromycin in 12 patients. When administered after erythromycin, octreotide immediately induced phase 3s contractions in 15 patients, beginning in the antrum. In 7 children, some of the octreotide-induced phase 3s did not propagate. After the meal, antral contractions continued in all patients. The fed pattern was replaced in 14 patients by alternating phase 3 and phase 1 activities. CONCLUSIONS: Pretreatment with erythromycin prevented octreotide-induced inhibition of antral contractions. Inhibition of antral contractions by octreotide may be mediated through either a direct or indirect suppression of motilin release, because antral contractions persist after pretreatment with the motilin receptor agonist erythromycin.},

   abstract = {Human breast milk is rich in nutrients, hormones, growth factors and immunoactive molecules, which influence the growth, development and immune status of the newborn infant. Although several of these factors are also present in bovine milk, the greater susceptibility of the formula-fed infant to infection and disease and the development of allergy is often attributed to the reduced level of protective factors in milk formulas. Nevertheless, modifying manufacturing processes may preserve the biological activity of some bioactive molecules in end products. Transforming growth factor (TGF)-beta is one such molecule. TGF-beta is a polypeptide, which has been described in both human and bovine milk. It is implicated in many processes, including epithelial cell growth and differentiation, development, carcinogenesis and immune regulation. The present article discusses the biological activity of TGF-beta2 that has been preserved and activated in a cow's milk-based product. More specifically, it addresses possible mechanisms of action in the intestinal lumen and speculates on how milk products containing naturally occurring TGF-beta2 could be exploited in functional foods for the infant or as therapies for specific intestinal diseases.},

More challenging is the search for clinically useful, noninvasive markers for Crohn disease and ulcerative colitis to accurately screen cases with nonspecific and indolent symptoms. Equally required are diagnostic markers that discriminate between these two disorders in cases with indeterminate colitis. Another dilemma for clinicians is that there are no simple measures to observe disease activity and predict relapses. This review describes the recent advances in diagnostic markers that afford the ability to screen for inflammatory bowel disease, discriminate between its types, and monitor disease activity. These include serological, fecal, and tissue markers; permeability tests; and diagnostic imaging using color Doppler ultrasonography.},

   abstract = {BACKGROUND: The distinction between ulcerative colitis and Crohn's disease is important, because treatment options and clinical course may vary. Magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) allows noninvasive transmural assessment of the intestine and may facilitate differentiation of ulcerative colitis from Crohn's disease. The objective of this prospective study was to determine whether MRI differentiates Crohn's disease from ulcerative colitis in children as effectively as colonoscopy with mucosal biopsies. METHODS: Fifteen patients underwent colonoscopy with biopsies followed by abdominal MRI. The MRI diagnosis, determined by two radiologists independently completing a standardized form was compared with the gastroenterologic diagnosis. RESULTS: After colonoscopy and review of histology, Crohn's disease was diagnosed in nine patients, ulcerative colitis in five, and indeterminate colitis in one, who was excluded from study. Agreement of the MRI diagnosis with the gastroenterologic diagnosis was 4 of 4 (100%) for ulcerative colitis, 4 of 10 (40%) for Crohn's disease considering both radiologists, and 5 of 10 (50%) for Crohn's disease for each radiologist individually. Percentage of enhancement by MRI did not correlate with the severity of inflammation determined at endoscopy among the patients with Crohn's disease (r = -0.3, P = 0.366). There was agreement on severity of inflammation in three of four patients with ulcerative colitis. CONCLUSIONS: Current MRI interpretation of inflammatory bowel disease did not adequately recognize Crohn's disease in children. Therefore, colonoscopy with biopsy remains the most accurate tool for determining the type and severity of inflammatory bowel disease in children and adolescents.},

Some aspects of molecular biology are discussed. Furthermore, right and left part of the colon (divided by the Cannon-Boehm point) and the neoplasms of these sections of the colon are different in embryology, function and morphology. The cancers of the right colon develop without polypoid changes, those of the left part in majority via the adenoma-carcinoma sequence. It is possible to demonstrate differences between these two localizations in the DNA-content (diploid tumors on the right side), in the lost of allels (especially distal tumors), in proliferation activity (lower in right side tumors) and in the expression of oncofetal antigens. Besides, there are some histological differences between neoplasms of the right and left colon (production of mucin, "Crohns like lymphoid reaction" histological grading). In our own material of 262 patients with resected colon carcinoma we have investigated the distribution of carcinoma in the right and left colon, furthermore the T-classification, histological grading and the proportion of mucinous carcinoma in the different tumor localizations.},

   abstract = {The aetiology of inflammatory bowel disease remains unclear. Local mediators such as arachidonic acid metabolites and peptide mediators (cytokines) appear to contribute to the disease process. The successful administration of neutralizing antibodies against TNF-alpha has confirmed a pathophysiological role for this cytokine in Crohn's disease. Established therapy of inflammatory bowel disease with 5-aminosalicylic acid compounds has been shown to reduce local leukotriene B4 formation by inhibiting lipoxygenases. This therapeutic mechanism formed one rationale for examining the effect of n-3 fatty acids, which also inhibit leukotriene B4 formation, on the course of these diseases. In the first study, published in 1989, we found no beneficial effects of n-3 fatty acids in patients with Crohn's disease; however, there was clinical improvement, just falling short of significance, in patients with ulcerative colitis. Since then two uncontrolled and five controlled studies have further investigated the therapeutic effect of n-3 fatty acids in patients with ulcerative colitis. The size of the patient population in the controlled studies ranged from 10 to 96 patients in the largest study. Two of these studies showed a significant improvement in clinical activity and a steroid-sparing effect, respectively. Another study found only a trend towards improvement and one trial, which also included a treatment group receiving evening primrose oil, found no beneficial effect in the 16 patients receiving n-3 fatty acids. A large, 2 year trial of n-3 fatty acids in patients with ulcerative colitis off steroids, which was recently completed at the Universities of Munich and Mainz, showed a delay of the first episode of relapse, but no reduction in the cumulative relapse rate at 2 years. Controversial results have been published for Crohn's disease. A new enteric-coated formulation reportedly increased the proportion of patients in remission where as another trial using a conventional preparation found no significant effect.},

   abstract = {BACKGROUND: Although enteral nutrition is a recognized form of treatment for intestinal Crohn's disease, there are persisting problems with feed palatability and only limited data as to its mode of action. AIM: To assess the effects of a specific oral polymeric diet (CT3211; Nestle, Vevey, Switzerland), which is rich in transforming growth factor beta2, on the mucosal inflammatory process. METHODS: Twenty-nine consecutive children with active intestinal Crohn's disease were treated with CT3211 as the sole source of nutrition for 8 weeks. Patients were assessed clinically, and endoscopically, whilst cytokine mRNA was measured in mucosal biopsies before and after treatment by quantitative reverse transcriptase polymerase chain reaction. RESULTS: After 8 weeks 79% of children were in complete clinical remission. Macroscopic and histological healing in the terminal ileum and colon was associated with a decline in ileal and colonic interleukin-1beta mRNA (pre-treatment to post-treatment ratio 0.008 and 0.06: P < 0.001, P = 0.006). In the ileum there was also a fall in interferon gamma mRNA (ratio 0.15, P < 0.001) with a rise in transforming growth factor beta1 mRNA (ratio 10, P = 0.04), whilst in the colon interleukin-8 mRNA fell with treatment (ratio 0.06, P < 0.05). CONCLUSIONS: The clinical response to oral polymeric diet CT3211 is associated with mucosal healing and a down regulation of mucosal pro-inflammatory cytokine mRNA in both the terminal ileum and colon. In the ileum there was also an increase in transforming growth factor beta1 mRNA.},

   abstract = {Energy-protein malnutrition and the sub-clinical deficiencies of vitamins and trace elements, are frequent findings in ulcerative colitis and Crohn's disease, and these may negatively influence the clinical course of these diseases. In general, the majority of the patients with ulcerative colitis and uncomplicated Crohn's disease can ingest a normal diet that is well balanced and without any restrictions. The intolerance to specific foods is rare in Crohn's disease and the application of exclusion diets in a routine manner is not indicated. When the nutritional status cannot be adequately maintained with normal ingestion, the use of artificial nutrition is indicated. Enteral nutrition is the first choice nutritional support system if the gastrointestinal tract is accessible and at least partially functional. In Crohn's disease enteral nutrition could have a specific anti-inflammatory effect ("primary treatment"), and it has been suggested that this could be effective to induce the clinical remission of the activity bouts of the disease. Some types of dietary fiber could be effective in the treatment of ulcerative colitis. Initial studies suggest their usefulness in maintaining the remission of the disease.},

   abstract = {Avascular necrosis (osteonecrosis) occurs in Crohn's disease, but the rate of this particular complication is not known. Over 20 years, 877 patients with Crohn's disease, 492 women (56.1%) and 385 men (43.9%), were evaluated with patient follow-up data available for a mean of 7.8 years. In this group, four men were seen with osteonecrosis. No woman was affected. All patients had typical radiological, magnetic resonance imaging or pathological changes of osteonecrosis involving the femoral heads, while two also had superimposed avascular necrosis involving the humeral heads. Patient ages ranged from 19 to 36 years at the time of diagnosis of their Crohn's disease, and all were white. In one patient, disease was confined to the colon, while three patients had disease involving the terminal ileum and colon. Disease behaviour in two patients was classified as penetrating because of concomitant ischiorectal abscesses, while one patient developed a metastatic colon carcinoma. Ankylosing spondylitis was present in two patients, but no other extraintestinal manifestations developed. Two patients received corticosteroids as well as parenteral nutrition during the course of their disease. Two patients did not receive corticosteroids or parenteral nutrition. Of 877 patients with Crohn's disease, 484 (55. 1%) received corticosteroids during the course of the disease, 196 (22.4%) received at least one course of parenteral nutrition, and 125 (14.3%) received both corticosteroids and parenteral nutrition. A total of 311 patients (35.5%) had at least one small intestinal resection. The overall rate of avascular necrosis in Crohn's disease was less than 0.5% but for men with Crohn's disease was about 1%. In this series, risk of osteonecrosis could not be attributed to corticosteroid use, parenteral nutrition or both forms of therapy administered together. Small intestinal resection with loss of small intestinal absorptive area was not a risk factor for the development of osteonecrosis. Avascular necrosis (or osteonecrosis) is a very rare extraintestinal osseous complication that may occur in Crohn's disease, independent of previously reported risk factors, including corticosteroids or parenteral nutrition with lipid emulsions.},

She had a complex clinical course that required treatment with multiple pharmacological agents, including intravenous, oral and rectal corticosteroids. She also received parenteral nutrition with lipid emulsions. Finally, repeated intestinal resections and drainage of perianal abscesses were required. Her disease was complicated by gallstones, urolithiasis and hip pain. After osteonecrosis was diagnosed, joint replacements were performed. Review of the pathological sections from the resected hip, however, resulted in detection of granulomatous inflammation with multinucleated giant cells - the histological 'footprint' of Crohn's disease in the gastrointestinal tract. Because prior specialized perfusion fixation pathological studies of the intestine in Crohn's disease have shown that granulomas are located in the walls of blood vessels, a possible mechanism for the pathogenesis of osteonecrosis in Crohn's disease is chronic microvascular ischemia of bone.},

Knowledge of the nutritional status in patients with recently diagnosed IBD is limited. The aim of this study was to establish a comprehensive picture of the nutritional status in recently diagnosed IBD patients. SUBJECTS: Sixty-nine IBD patients (23 Crohn's disease (CD) and 46 with ulcerative colitis (UC)) within 6 months of diagnosis and 69 age- and sex-matched population controls were included in the study. METHODS: The nutritional status was assessed by: (1) body composition (anthropometry and dual-energy X-ray absorptiometry); (2) dietary intake (dietary history); (3) biochemical indexes of nutrition; and (4) muscle strength (isokinetic dynamometer). RESULTS: Body weight and body mass index were significantly lower in UC patients compared with controls. The mean daily intake of carbohydrates was significantly higher in CD patients and the intakes of protein, calcium, phosphorus, and riboflavin were significantly lower in UC patients compared with controls, respectively. Serum concentrations of several nutrients (beta-carotene, magnesium, selenium and zinc) were significantly lower in UC patients compared with controls. Serum vitamin B12 concentration was significantly lower in CD patients. Muscle strength did not significantly differ between IBD patients and controls. CONCLUSIONS: This study showed that the nutritional status of IBD patients was already affected negatively at time of diagnosis. It needs to be elucidated whether nutritional supplementation in recently diagnosed IBD patients may improve the clinical course of the disease.},

The aim of this study was to investigate the effects of 3 months of supplementation with a liquid formula containing either antioxidants (AO) or n-3 fatty acids plus AO on the antioxidant status and fatty acid profile of plasma phospholipids and adipose tissue, respectively, in patients with long-standing CD currently in remission. In a randomized, double-blind placebo-controlled study, CD patients received either placebo, AO, or n-3 fatty acids plus AO for 3 months in addition to their regular diet. In all, 25/37 CD patients completed the study. AO status was assessed by blood biochemical parameters. A statistical per-protocol analysis was performed. Serum concentrations of selenium, vitamin C, and vitamin E, the activity of superoxide dismutase and total antioxidant status were significantly (p < 0.05) increased after AO supplementation. Furthermore, compared with controls, serum concentrations of beta-carotene, selenium, and vitamin C and the activity of glutathione peroxidase (GPx) were significantly (p < 0.05) lower before supplementation; however, after AO supplementation these levels were not significantly different from controls (except for GPx). N-3 fatty acids plus AO supplementation significantly (p < 0.05) decreased the proportion of arachidonic acid, and increased the proportion of eicosapentanoic acid and docosahexanoic acid in both plasma phospholipids and adipose tissue. Supplementation with antioxidants improved antioxidant status in patients with CD in remission. In addition, supplementation with n-3 fatty acids plus antioxidants significantly changed the eicosanoid precursor profile, which may lead to the production of eicosanoids with attenuated proinflammatory activity. This study indicates that an immunomodulating formula containing n-3 fatty acids and/or AO may have the potential to play a role in the treatment of CD.},

SUBJECTS: Fifty-two patients with IBD at time of diagnosis (20 patients with Crohn's disease (CD-new) and 32 patients with ulcerative colitis (UC-new)), 40 patients with long-standing CD (CD-long) and 2 matched healthy control groups (n = 52 and n = 40) were recruited for the study. METHODS: Total body water (TBW) and extracellular water (ECW) were measured by deuterium oxide and bromide dilution, respectively. Intracellular water (ICW) was calculated as TBW-ECW. In addition, hydration of fat-free mass (FFM) and the ECW:ICW ratio were calculated. FFM, body fat (BF) and % body fat (%BF) were assessed by dual energy X-ray absorptiometry. RESULTS: In female IBD patients, the ECW:ICW ratio was significantly (P < 0.05) higher than in controls (CD-new: 0.89+/-0.11 vs 0.79+/-0.08, P < 0.01; UC-new: 0.85+/-0.15 vs 0.77+/-0.10, P < 0.05; CD-long: 0.86+/-0.14 vs 0.80+/-0.10, P < 0.05). In these female patients, the ICW:FFM ratio was significantly (P < 0.05) lower than in controls. Fluid shifts were especially pronounced in female patients with recently diagnosed CD. In male patients with recently diagnosed UC and in those with long-standing CD, body weight, body mass index, BF and %BF were significantly (P < 0.05) lower than in controls. No differences in body hydration or body water distribution were observed between male patients and controls. CONCLUSIONS: An altered body water distribution and body hydration was observed in female IBD patients, especially in female patients with recently diagnosed CD.},

   abstract = {BACKGROUND: Inflammatory bowel disease (IBD) is a chronic inflammatory process, the aetiology of which remains unknown. Nutrition may play an important role in the pathogenesis and treatment of IBD. The evidence regarding the role of specific dietary components in the pathogenesis of IBD is still inconclusive. Many studies have been subject to methodological limitations; studies of better design are necessary to confirm the hypothesis that nutritional factors may indeed play a role in the development of IBD. Several studies have reported nutritional and functional deficiencies in IBD patients, especially in Crohn's disease. It is, however, hard to discriminate between disease-induced and malnutrition-induced changes in nutritional parameters. Maintaining adequate nutritional status has been suggested to be beneficial to the course of the disease in IBD. Studies have provided further insight into the possible beneficial effects of nutritional supplementation as primary and adjunctive therapy in IBD. The effects of specific nutritional therapy may be caused by alterations in intestinal flora and hence in the production of intraluminal proinflammatory substances. Immunonutrients such as n-3 fatty acids and antioxidants may also play a role in the treatment of IBD. In this paper, the relation between nutritional aetiological factors, nutritional status and nutritional therapy is discussed in detail.},

DESIGN: Prospective case-control study. SETTING: Clinic of Internal Medicine IV/Department of Gastroenterology and Hepatology, University of Vienna Medical School. SUBJECTS/METHODS: Plasma antioxidant concentrations were determined in patients with Crohn's disease (n = 24) to evaluate the antioxidant capacity compared to healthy controls (n = 33). Additionally, plasma TRAP (total radical-trapping antioxidant potential) was measured in 13 patients and 22 controls. RESULTS: All investigated carotenoids (alpha-carotene, beta-carotene and cryptoxanthin) were significantly decreased in patients with Crohn's disease (10.2 +/- 9.3, 16.2 +/- 12.4 and 7.8 +/- 5.5 microg/dl) compared to controls (13.3 +/- 5.1, 34.7 +/- 18.8 and 48.5 +/- 38.4 microg/dl respectively), whereas gamma-tocopherol and ubiquinone were significantly elevated in patients (0.14 +/- 0.07 microg/dl and 82.3 +/- 41.5 microg/dl, controls: 0.09 +/- 0.04 microg/dl and 60.8 +/- 30.0 microg/dl, respectively). Retinol and alpha-tocopherol did not significantly differ from controls. The total radical-trapping antioxidant potential (TRAP) was significantly lower in patients (1.11 +/- 0.28 micromol/l) compared to controls (1.34 +/- 0.26 micromol/l). Antioxidants were neither related to duration or severity of disease nor to disease activity. CONCLUSIONS: In patients with Crohn's disease several plasma antioxidant parameters are altered and the total radical-trapping antioxidant potential is decreased.},

His vitamin A tolerance test and interest in malabsorption led him to a comprehensive study of sprue, the separation of the tropical and non-tropical forms, and their different etiologies and treatments. Adlersberg's work was complemented by (a) Marshak and Wolf's radiologic examination of the small bowel (especially in sprue and other malabsorption disorders); (b) Gerson s perfusion experiments; and (c) Friedman, Waye and Wolf's motility studies. Lieber and his colleagues explored the deleterious effects of alcohol on the function and structure of the small intestine. Gerson explored the nutrition of patients with Crohn's disease of the small intestine, especially after extensive resection or bypass leading to ascorbic and folic acid deficiencies and hypergastrinemia.},

However, there has been little published regarding PSC in children and no studies investigating the efficacy of UDCA as a treatment for PSC. METHODS: This retrospective study included 10 children who were found to have the diagnosis of PSC during the past 15 years at the Texas Children's Hospital and Herman Hospital, both in Houston, Texas. The male:female ratio was 8:2, the median age of onset was 12 years (range, 1-17 years), and eight patients had coexistent inflammatory bowel disease (IBD; six ulcerative colitis, one Crohn's disease, one unspecified). At the time of diagnosis, five patients were asymptomatic, all of whom had IBD with elevated liver enzymes and three of whom had hepatomegaly. Nine patients were treated with UDCA. The one patient who did not receive UDCA was lost to follow-up soon after diagnosis. The mean dose of UDCA was 17 mg/kg with the doses ranging from 9 to 37 mg/kg. RESULTS: There were no side effects from the medication recorded for any of the patients. These patients showed a significant reduction in alkaline phosphatase, alanine aminotransferase, aspartate aminotransferase, and gamma-glutamyl transferase at 1, 3, 6, 15, and 20 months after treatment. CONCLUSIONS: This study demonstrates that children with PSC treated with UDCA have significant improvements in liver biochemical indices. However, the long-term effect of UDCA on clinical outcome is unknown.},

All of these patients come from the 1996 national registry. The most common indication for home enteral nutrition are neoplasias (39%) followed by neurological alterations (33%). The most common access route is oral (48%), followed by a nasogastric tube in 34%, PEG in 10% and surgical ostomies in 7%. The average treatment duration is 6 months. There is an index of 0.74 complications/patient-year (gastrointestinal 0.28 and mechanical alterations 0.19). At the end of the year 58% of the patients continued to use at home enteral nutrition, with a death rate of 17%. The majority of the treated patients presented a severe social disability (28%) or was bed-ridden (22%). The most common indications for home parenteral nutrition are: neoplasia (42%), Crohn_s disease (10%), and mesenteric ischemia (10%). AIDS (8%), radical enteritis (5%), and motility disorders (5%) are less common. In 42% of the cases tunneled catheters are used, and port-a-cath are used in 53%. The average treatment duration is 6.9 months. 1.06 hospitalizations/patient-year have been registered in relation to the nutritional treatment (mainly catheter sepsis). A mortality of 29% is registered, and there is recovery of the oral route in 7.9% of the cases. 50% of the patients present a severe social disability.},

   abstract = {BACKGROUND: A child- and adolescent-generated IBD quality-of-life index was designed to be descriptive (to be used to assess the overall impact of IBD on individual patients), and evaluative (to be used as an outcome measure in clinical trials). METHODS: Item-generation and item-reduction interviews with 82 patients with IBD aged 8 to 17 years (61 with Crohn's disease, 21 with ulcerative colitis; 36 girls, 45 boys) generated a list of ways in which their lives were affected by IBD. These issues were incorporated into an item-reduction questionnaire, which was administered to 117 patients (87 Crohn's disease, 30 ulcerative colitis). Patients indicated on a visual analog scale how important an item was to them and how often it bothered them. Mean and median importance-plus-frequency scores for each issue were calculated for the entire group and among patients in subgroups according to age and IBD type. RESULTS: Ulcerative colitis and Crohn's disease affect the lives of children and adolescents differently. Bowel symptoms are more troubling and disabling to patients with ulcerative colitis, whereas systemic symptoms and body image concerns are greater for patients with Crohn's disease. The impact of Crohn's disease on ability to function in school and leisure activities is greater. Worries about future health problems and about the effects of IBD on the family are shared. Crohn's disease and ulcerative colitis trigger emotional responses of unfairness and frustration, but anger and embarrassment are more prevalent in ulcerative colitis. Disparities between age groups are fewer and less marked than those between types of IBD. CONCLUSION: In selection of items to be retained in a pediatric IBD quality-of-life measure, the variation in concerns with disease type must be considered. A single index to assess IBD-related quality of life must include items of major importance to one subgroup of patients, even if not important to all. Alternately, a core of common concerns could be supplemented by disease-specific modules, thereby increasing the content validity of the tool for all patients.},

   abstract = {Nitric oxide synthase (NOS) activities are responsible for the enzymatic conversion of L-arginine into NO and L-citrulline. Relatively low amounts of NO are produced in intestinal epithelial cells or are released from nerve endings. The effects of NO production are related to the maintenance of epithelial integrity and permeability. A pathological role of an increased NO production has been suggested to play a role in models of experimental colitis. In humans, NOS activity in colon mucosa from patients with ulcerative colitis is clearly increased when compared with the activity of the control group. In contrast, an increase of NOS activity in the colon mucosa from patients with Crohn's disease remains controversial. In the present work, we have measured NOS activity in colon biopsies originating from the control group (n = 16), from patients with ulcerative colitis (n = 23) and Crohn's disease (n = 17) using the radiochemical method of the conversion of L-[guanido-14C] arginine into radioactive L-citrulline. In the control group, NOS activity was mainly of the inducible type (88% of total NOS activity) since it was characterised by its insensibility to the absence of calcium in the assay medium. In colon biopsies originating from patients with ulcerative colitis, inducible NOS activity was increased 3 fold (p < 0.005) and in patients with Crohn's disease, inducible NOS activity was increased 5 fold (p < 0.005). Correlations between NOS activity in colon biopsies and the intensity parameters of the disease i.e. Truelove index, endoscopic score and histological parameters were evidenced in patients with ulcerative colitis. In contrast, in patients with Crohn's disease, the high inducible NOS activity was not correlated with any intensity parameters of the disease. From these data, we concluded that although inducible NOS activity was increased several fold in colon biopsies originating from patients with both ulcerative colitis and Crohn's disease, a correlation between this activity and the severity of bowel inflammation was not found in either cases.},

   abstract = {BACKGROUND: Lactobacillus GG is a safe probiotic bacterium known to transiently colonize the human intestine. It has been found to be useful in treatment of several gastrointestinal conditions characterized by increased gut permeability. In the current study, the efficacy of Lactobacillus GG was investigated in children with Crohn's disease. METHODS: In this open-label pilot evaluation viewed as a necessary preliminary step for a possible subsequent randomized placebo-controlled trial, four children with mildly to moderately active Crohn's disease were given Lactobacillus GG (10(10) colony-forming units [CFU]) in enterocoated tablets twice a day for 6 months. Changes in intestinal permeability were measured by a double sugar permeability test. Clinical activity was determined by measuring the pediatric Crohn's disease activity index. RESULTS: There was a significant improvement in clinical activity 1 week after starting Lactobacillus GG, which was sustained throughout the study period. Median pediatric Crohn's disease activity index scores at 4 weeks were 73% lower than baseline. Intestinal permeability improved in an almost parallel fashion. CONCLUSIONS: Findings in this pilot study show that Lactobacillus GG may improve gut barrier function and clinical status in children with mildly to moderately active, stable Crohn's disease. Randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled trials are warranted for a final assessment of the efficacy of Lactobacillus GG in Crohn's disease.},

In the beginning of 1997 the enteral nutrition was not longer tolerated for an exacerbation of chronic pancreatitis. There was a weight loss, permanent pain and total parenteral nutrition had to be performed. In this situation a new liquid preparation of pancreatic enzymes which had been tested in the laboratory before, was used for continuous enzyme replacement via gastric tube. In combination with this enzyme preparation, enteral nutrition could successfully be started again.},

We investigated changes in Se levels and glutathione peroxidase (GSH-Px) activity in serum and tissue (red blood cells, RBC) in addition to urinary excretion of Se in patients receiving long-term PN with and without Se supplementation. In patients without Se supplementation, both Se levels and GSH-Px activity in serum decreased with duration of PN. The serum Se levels were below the lower limits of the control values in 19 of 33 patients (58%) who received PN for less than 1 mo. Conversely, RBC GSH-Px activity remained at a sufficient level in 9 of 12 patients (75%) who received PN for 3-6 mo. The RBC Se levels in all of these patients were lower than the control levels. Urinary Se concentrations were significantly correlated with serum Se concentrations by linear regression analysis (r = 0.707, P < 0.05). In patients with Se supplementation, urinary Se concentrations increased exponentially with increases in serum Se levels. These findings indicate that a time lag precedes the decrease in levels of serum Se, RBC Se, serum GSH-Px, and RBC GSH-Px in patients without Se supplementation and the increase in excretion of urinary Se in patients with Se supplementation. The monitoring of not only serum Se levels but also RBC GSH-Px activity and urinary Se levels is required for optimal Se supplementation during long-term PN.},

These agents are designed to disrupt proinflammatory pathways at specific sites. Monoclonal antibodies to tumor necrosis factor-alpha (TNF-alpha) are already transforming the lives of some patients with previously intractable Crohn disease, and further TNF-alpha directed therapies are being developed. Clinical trials are now underway on agents that inhibit adhesion molecules and antiinflammatory cytokines, while attempts are being made to actively immunize against TNF-alpha. Promising data continue to be reported, although long-term safety data are still mostly unavailable. Although these agents are proving to be very effective in the treatment of patients with Crohn disease, their use should continue to be restricted while indications and dose regimens are defined.},

   abstract = {BACKGROUND: Degradation of the extracellular matrix and ulceration of the mucosa are major features of inflammatory bowel disease (IBD). One of the most important enzymes in degrading the matrix and produced in excess by cytokine activated stromal cells, is stromelysin-1. The activity of stromelysin-1 is controlled by tissue inhibitor of metalloproteinase (TIMP-1), its natural inhibitor. In model systems excess stromelysin-1 produces mucosal degradation. METHODS: Quantitative competitive RT-PCR was used to analyse stromelysin-1 and TIMP-1 transcripts; western blotting was used to measure the amount of stromelysin-1 and TIMP-1 protein in biopsy samples from children with IBD. RESULTS: In biopsies from patients with active Crohn's disease (n=24), ulcerative colitis (n=23), and controls (n=16), TIMP-1 transcripts and protein were abundant and unchanged. Stromelysin-1 transcripts and protein were markedly elevated in mucosal biopsies obtained from inflamed sites of patients with active IBD but were not elevated in adjacent endoscopically normal mucosa (n=10). Elevated levels of stromelysin-1 transcripts in active Crohn's disease (n=5) returned to normal levels following treatment with enteral nutrition. CONCLUSIONS: Stromelysin-1 is markedly overexpressed at inflamed sites in patients with IBD whereas TIMP-1 remains unaltered. Excess stromelysin-1 is likely to be responsible for loss of mucosal integrity in IBD.},

   abstract = {BACKGROUND: The optimal treatment of acute Crohn's disease in children remains controversial. In adults, steroid therapy has been shown to be superior to exclusive enteral nutrition. However, enteral nutrition is effective at inducing a remission in many children with acute Crohn's disease. Steroid usage in children has been associated with adverse side effects, particularly with delayed growth and pubertal development. METHODS: Randomized clinical trials comparing exclusive enteral nutrition with corticosteroids were identified. Two independent reviewers extracted data from selected studies. Studies were assessed for heterogeneity and relative risks for remission induction with enteral nutrition were obtained. Sensitivity analyses were performed in partially randomized studies. Estimates were made of the number of studies needed to overturn the current result. Other outcome measures were qualitatively assessed. RESULTS: In five randomized clinical trials comprising 147 patients, enteral nutrition was as effective as corticosteroids at inducing a remission (RR = 0.95 [95% confidence interval 0.67, 1.34]). Addition of two further nonrandomized trials did not significantly alter the result. A minimum of 10 further studies, equal in size and outcome to the largest reported pediatric trial to date (n = 68, RR = 0.84), would be required to demonstrate a significant benefit of steroid therapy over enteral nutrition. CONCLUSIONS: There is no difference in efficacy between enteral nutrition and corticosteroid therapy in the treatment of acute Crohn's disease in children. Improved growth and development, without the side effects of steroid therapy, make enteral nutrition a better choice for first-line therapy in children with active Crohn's disease.},

   abstract = {The treatment of Crohn's disease depends on disease location and disease activity. It can be divided into medical and surgical treatment. While surgery is reserved for complications such as abscesses or failure of pharmacological treatment (fistulae, perianal disease, or strictures) medical treatment aims at induction and maintenance of remission. In order to achieve these goals supportive and therapeutic strategies must be used. Supportive measures include substitution of vitamins, particularly fat-soluble vitamins, and minerals in deficiencies due to resection or disease involvement of the small bowel. All patients on long-term steroids should receive calcium and vitamin D in order to prevent osteoporosis. Therapeutic options include drug treatment (corticosteroids, antibiotics, salicylates, and immunosuppressives), nutrition (parenteral or enteral), and endoscopy (dilatation of strictures). Depending on disease location different pharmacologic preparations of salicylates or corticosteroids should be used, e.g., enemas for distal colitis. The most potent drugs for long-term control are immunosuppressive agents, particularly azathioprine. It is the most widely investigated immunosuppressive agent in Crohn's disease and should be the first line treatment for patients with steroid refractory, chronic steroid dependent, fistulating, and stenosing courses. In the future, more potent drugs and better risk stratification criteria should improve the treatment of Crohn's disease.},

The understanding of the pathogenesis of inflammatory bowel diseases has been greatly advanced by manipulations of the immune system in mice using targeted disruptions of genes that encode specific anti- and proinflammatory cytokines, as well as T-cell subsets. The outcome of these experiments has implicated CD4+ lymphocytes and certain proinflammatory cytokines (tumour necrosis factor-alpha, interleukin-12) as playing a central role in the pathogenesis of mucosal inflammation in Crohn's disease. The present review focuses on these recent important immunological observations, and discusses several newly developed therapeutic strategies that are based either on blocking proinflammatory cytokines or on the administration of anti-inflammatory cytokines.},

   abstract = {We describe the cases of two patients with Crohn's disease affected by severe perineal fistulae resistant to conventional therapies, successfully treated with FK 506, a new immunomodulatory drug. It is well absorbed from diseased bowel and preliminary experiences have indicated its short-term use in complicated Crohn's disease. The first patient was a 24-year-old male with perineal fistula and severe skin ulceration (8 cm of external opening diameter). He had undergone colectomy and ileostomy because of severe pancolitis refractory to medical treatment and had been treated with azathioprine and metronidazole. Two months after starting FK 506, a dramatic improvement made further surgical operation unnecessary. Local and general benefit was observed during the following 26 months, until FK 506 was withdrawn. The second patient was a 28-year-old male with a diagnosis of ulcerative pancolitis changed to Crohn's disease two months after the onset of a perineal fistula, recurring despite drainage procedures, steroid therapy, and total parenteral nutrition. FK 506 was administered for two months with a complete healing of fistula. Successively, it was stopped and corticosteroids (associated to enteral nutrition) were given because of recurrent rectal bleeding. Our experience encourages the use of oral FK 506 in complicated Crohn's disease and suggests the possibility of a long-term primary therapy other than the use as a "bridge" to other treatments.},

A number of studies have examined the prevalence of abnormal bone mineral metabolism in children and adolescents. Studies, conducted over the past decade, indicate a greater likelihood of clinically significant problems in Crohn's disease than in ulcerative colitis. Corticosteroids have been proven to impair bone mineral status. It is increasingly clear that inflammation and other factors play a bigger role than malabsorbtion of minerals or vitamin D in most patients. As the use of the bisphonate class of drugs is limited in pediatric patients, there is a need to emphasize the role of diet and exercise in children and teenagers, particularly in those affected by inflammatory bowel disease.},

Records of pediatric Crohn's patients were retrospectively reviewed for significant perianal disease treated with AZA or 6-MP for > or =6 months. The patient's perianal disease was reviewed and evaluated for fistulas, drainage, induration, and tenderness. In addition, the patients were given a score using the Irvine Perianal Disease Activity Index (PDAI). Patients were retrospectively scored upon initiation of treatment and after six months of therapy. Possible scores ranged from 0-20. Twenty patients met the study criteria. Five patients were considered treatment failures. One patient required a colostomy after 1.5 months of therapy, one developed pancreatitis, and three were noncompliant with therapy. Of the remaining 15 patients who were treated for > or =6 months, 67% had an improvement in drainage, 73% in tenderness, 60% in induration, and 40% in fistula closure. The mean Irvine PDAI was 7.67 +/- 2.19 initially and 4.40 +/- 1.72 after six months of therapy. The improvement was statistically significant (p < 0.001). AZA and 6-MP are effective treatments for healing significant perianal Crohn's disease in pediatrics.},

This paper reports about the relationship between food habits and reactions to foods in people with IBD. A database was designed to incorporate the date of data collection, the IBD disease, food habits, the quantity consumed and a response rating of the subjects' reactions to each food. For each of 122 foods, subjects were asked simultaneously about these five categories. Thirty three subjects with Crohn's disease and 27 with ulcerative colitis completed the questionnaire in two seasons. The focus of the examination was directed to the upper and lower limit of reactions to foods. Foods that affect people negatively and foods that affect people positively were identified in relation to habits of consumption. Foods that affect people negatively were among those never consumed while foods that affect people positively were among the regularly consumed foods. Findings included an increased number of foods that caused problems for people with Crohn's disease when compared with people with ulcerative colitis. Problems with chocolate, dairy products, fats and artificial sweeteners were documented in both groups of IBD. A standard food list generated without the input of individuals with a chronic illness may be inadequate to collect data about their consumption since many of the foods on the list were reportedly never consumed and there may be other foods not on the list that are consumed by this chronically ill population.},

   abstract = {BACKGROUND: The effectiveness of 6-mercaptopurine combined with azathioprine in treating severe ulcerative colitis has been shown in several adult studies. Reported pediatric experiences are rare. The purpose of this study was to investigate the safety and the potential efficacy of 6-mercaptopurine and azathioprine in the treatment of active ulcerative colitis in a pediatric population. METHODS: The medical records of patients with active ulcerative colitis who were under observation at The Children's Hospital of Philadelphia and its satellite clinics from January 1984 through December 1997 were retrospectively reviewed. Patients were included who had received a diagnosis of ulcerative colitis, who met no criteria for Crohn's colitis, and who had received treatment with 6-mercaptopurine and azathioprine. They were then analyzed for the development of side effects, the indication to use 6-mercaptopurine and azathioprine, and the ability to discontinue corticosteroid use in those patients taking 5-acetylsalicylic acid products who were corticosteroid-dependent or whose disease was refractory to treatment. Excluded from the corticosteroid analyses were patients who underwent surgery for their disease and patients treated with 5-acetylsalicylic acid only. Statistical analysis was performed by the Kaplan-Meier survival curve and paired Student's t-test. RESULTS: In a review of 200 medical records of patients with active ulcerative colitis, 20 patients met the criteria. The patients' average age at the initiation of treatment with 6-mercaptopurine and azathioprine was 13.8 years. Sixteen patients (80%) were corticosteroid dependent and 3 (15%) had ulcerative colitis refractory to corticosteroid treatment. One patient had severe colitis treated with 5-acetylsalicylic acid only. Discontinuation of corticosteroid was accomplished in 12 (75%) of 16 patients. The median time to discontinuation of corticosteroid after initiation of 6-mercaptopurine and azathioprine therapy was 8.4 months. Eight patients (67%), observed from 3 months to 65 months, have continued without corticosteroid therapy. Side effects included pancreatitis and shingles that resulted in discontinuation of 5-acetylsalicylic acid, leukopenia corrected by withholding 6-mercaptopurine, and self-resolved hepatitis. CONCLUSIONS: The data support the safety of 6-mercaptopurine and azathioprine use in the treatment of pediatric patients with ulcerative colitis; side effects were minimal and reversible. Eighteen (90%) of 20 patients tolerated the therapy well. The results also show that 12 (75%) of 16 pediatric patients with ulcerative colitis will benefit from the use of 6-mercaptopurine and azathioprine after initial discontinuation of corticosteroid therapy. Although 6-mercaptopurine and azathioprine may not prevent further relapses, medical management of these flares may be less intense and may not require long-term corticosteroid use. Prospective clinical trials in pediatric patients are necessary to delineate further the role of 6-mercaptopurine and azathioprine in pediatric ulcerative colitis.},

The level of thiopurine methyltransferase (TPMT), which metabolizes 6-MP to 6-methylmercaptopurine, may reflect the risk of side effects. We sought to evaluate the relationship between the side effects of these medications and the TPMT level of pediatric patients with IBD. The medical records of our patients who were diagnosed with IBD and who received 6-MP or AZA were reviewed for measured TPMT levels. All red blood cell (RBC) TPMT levels were determined at the Mayo Medical Laboratories, Rochester, MN. The occurrence of leukopenia, elevated aminotransferases, and pancreatitis was evaluated. Twenty-two patients, mean age 13.7 years, received 6-MP or AZA and had TPMT levels measured. The TPMT levels ranged 10.7-27.5 U/mL RBC with a mean of 17.2 +/- 3.2 U/mL RBC. Two children had levels below the accepted norm of 13.8 U/mL RBC. One of these patients (50%) developed both elevation of aminotransferases and leukopenia. Of all, 20 children had normal levels, 3 (15.0%) exhibited side effects: hepatitis (n = 2) and leukopenia (n = 1). We conclude that side effects of 6-MP or AZA occur despite normal TPMT levels.},

   abstract = {Recent progress in laparoscopic techniques has enabled operations for various intestinal disorders to be performed under laparoscopic assistance. This study was conducted to assess the benefits of performing laparoscopic-assisted surgery (LAS) in patients with Crohn's disease. LAS was performed in 24 selected patients with Crohn's disease, most of whom underwent ileocolic resection for ileitis and/or colitis with stenosis. To determine the benefits of LAS, the postoperative inflammatory parameters of these patients were examined and compared with those of 17 patients who underwent conventional open surgery. Despite giving all patients total parenteral nutrition (TPN) for more than 2 weeks preoperatively, two patients with large inflammatory masses involving enteroenteric fistulas required conversion to laparotomy. No laparoscopic procedure was converted for adhesions after previous resection or intraoperative complications. The maximum C-reactive protein values and body temperatures were significantly lower, and the time taken to normalize body temperature and leukocyte counts was significantly shorter in the LAS group than in the laparotomy group. LAS should be performed for patients with Crohn's disease in the inactive phase after appropriate nutritional support. Patients with terminal ileitis without a fistula are considered to have the highest indication for this procedure.},

In superacute conditions also total parenteral nutrition can be used. In the quiescent stage the patient must have an adequate energy intake and a low-residue (low-fibre) diet. As to medication, sulfasalazine which has some side-effects is abandoned and 5-ASA (5-aminosalicylic acid) preparations are used, either by the oral route or in enemas, while 4-ASA is little used in this country and is known as PAS. The administration of corticoids which also have side-effects will be abandoned in favour of so-called rapidly metabolized corticoids (Tixocortol pivalate, beclomethasone, budenoside and fluticasone) by the oral route and in enemas and foams. As antimicrobial treatment ciprofloxacine is used combined with metronidazole. As to immunosuppressive drugs azathioprine, 6-mercaptopurine, cyclosporin A, cyclophosphamide and methotrexate are tested. A hope for the future is so-called biological treatment (anticytokines, monoclonal antibodies against cytokines, against CD4+ TNF, interleukines IL-10 and 11, immunoglobulin; plasmapheresis is also tested). Treatment must be individual and surgery as late as possible, only in case of complications, and should be very sparing, stenoses should be treated by plastic operations of strictures.},

   abstract = {Crohn's disease is a panenteric, transmural inflammatory disease of unknown origin. Although primarily managed medically, 70% to 90% of patients will require surgical intervention. Surgery for small bowel Crohn's is usually necessary for unrelenting stenotic complications of the disease. Fistula, abscess, and perforation can also necessitate surgical intervention. Most patients benefit from resection or strictureplasty with an improved quality of life and remission of disease, but recurrence is common and 33% to 82% of patients will need a second operation, and 22% to 33% will require more than two resections. Short-bowel syndrome is unavoidable in a small percentage of Crohn's patients because of recurrent resection of affected small bowel and inflammatory destruction of the remaining mucosa. Although previously a lethal and unrelenting disease with death caused by malnutrition, patients with short-bowel syndrome today can lead productive lives with maintenance on total parenteral nutrition (TPN). This lifestyle, however, does not come without a price. Severe TPN-related complications, such as sepsis of indwelling central venous catheters and liver failure, do occur. Future developments will focus on more powerful and effective anti-inflammatory medication specifically targeting the immune mechanisms responsible for Crohn's disease. Successful medical management of the disease will alleviate the need for surgical resection and reduce the frequency of short-bowel syndrome. Improving the efficacy of immunosuppression and the understanding of tolerance induction should increase the safety and applicability of small-bowel transplant for those with short gut. Tissue engineering offers the potential to avoid immunosuppression altogether and supplement intestinal length using the patient's own tissues.},

   abstract = {OBJECTIVES: Tumor necrosis factor-alpha plays a central role in chronic intestinal inflammation of Crohn's disease. Targeting this cytokine with the chimeric monoclonal antibody infliximab has emerged as an effective form of therapy in adult Crohn's disease patients. We sought to determine whether infliximab treatment would benefit pediatric patients with medically refractory Crohn's disease. We also assessed the duration of response, comparing children with early disease to children with long-standing (late) Crohn's disease. METHODS: Fifteen consecutive children (mean age 12.8 +/- 3.2 yr) with medically refractory Crohn's disease were enrolled in a prospective, open-label trial of a single, 5-mg/kg infliximab intravenous infusion. Medically refractory disease was defined as an inability to taper steroids, lack of response to immunomodulator therapy over 4 months, and active disease as measured by the Pediatric Crohn's Disease Activity Index (PCDAI). Primary endpoints included measurements of disease activity (PCDAI), steroid use, and duration of clinical response. RESULTS: In all, 14/15 children (94%) improved after infliximab infusion, with a significant decrease of both PCDAI and daily steroid use by 4 wk. Ten patients (67%) achieved complete remission by 10 wk. Among the 14 patients who responded, three of six children (50%) with early disease maintained clinical response through the 12-month trial period, compared to none of eight children with late disease. There were no serious complications associated with the use of infliximab in any of the patients. CONCLUSIONS: Infliximab is safe and effective in the short-term treatment of medically refractory pediatric Crohn's disease. More importantly, there is a remarkably prolonged duration of response after infliximab therapy in children with early compared to late Crohn's disease.},

However, BMD has never been studied in Asia where the demographic and socio-economic status are different from the West. The aim of this study was to investigate the prevalence and mechanisms of osteopenia in newly diagnosed Korean patients with IBD. METHODS: We studied 14 patients with Crohn's disease (CD) and 25 patients with ulcerative colitis (UC), all of whom had never been treated with corticosteroids. Bone mineral density was measured in the lumbar spine and the femoral neck by dual energy X-ray absorptiometry. Biochemical parameters including serum osteocalcin, parathyroid hormone, plasma inactive and active vitamin D, and urinary deoxypyridinoline were measured. RESULTS: The BMD Z score at the lumbar spine was lower both in CD and in UC patients, but there was no significant difference between the two groups. There was no significant difference in nutritional status or biochemical parameters of bone metabolism between patients with a normal BMD and those with a decreased BMD. CONCLUSIONS: Low BMD at the lumbar spine is common in newly diagnosed Korean patients with IBD, a result which is similar to Western studies. The mechanism for low bone mass remains undetermined; however, nutritional status and hormonal parameters of bone metabolism, and ethnic differences are not likely to be an important factor in the pathogenesis of this bone loss.},

   abstract = {BACKGROUND: Growing evidence supports a role for peroxidation in the pathogenesis of Crohn disease (CD). The activation of inflammatory cells, the release of their mediators, and the excessive production of free radicals may affect circulating lipids. OBJECTIVE: We examined the lipid profile, lipoprotein composition, and oxidant-antioxidant status of children with CD. DESIGN: We studied 22 pediatric CD patients and 10 healthy control subjects. RESULTS: The proportion of saturated and monounsaturated fatty acids in plasma of CD patients was higher but that of polyunsaturated fatty acids was lower than in control subjects. This resulted in higher ratios in CD patients of palmitoleic acid to linoleic acid (P < 0. 05) and of eicosatrienoic acid to arachidonic acid (P < 0.04), 2 established indexes of essential fatty acid deficiency. Hypocholesterolemia was noted in CD patients as a result of lower LDL-cholesterol concentrations than in control subjects (P < 0.02). Plasma apolipoproteins B (P < 0.02) and A-I (P < 0.02) were also lower in CD patients, whereas plasma triacylglycerols were higher (P < 0.005). Lipoprotein composition was altered in CD patients, with relative triacylglycerol depletion and protein enrichment in VLDL. In contrast, intermediate-density lipoprotein of CD patients was characterized by an increased percentage of triacylglycerol and protein (P < 0.005) and a reduced proportion of phospholipids (P < 0. 01). Additional abnormalities were observed in the chemical distribution of HDL(2) and HDL(3) moieties. Lipid peroxidation was documented by higher plasma malondialdehyde concentrations in CD patients (P < 0.05), accompanied by lower retinol concentrations (P < 0.02). CONCLUSION: Disturbances in the lipid profile, in lipoprotein concentrations and composition, and in oxidant-antioxidant status occur in CD patients.},

   abstract = {BACKGROUND: A prospective study of inflammatory bowel disease (IBD) in Sweden was performed to investigate whether the incidence and morbidity have changed from 1984 through 1995. METHODS: Children 15 years of age or less with IBD were included--i.e., those with a definite diagnosis of ulcerative colitis (UC) and Crohn's disease (CD) and those classified as having indeterminate colitis (IC) and probable Crohn's disease (PCD). The study covered 56.5% of the pediatric population of Sweden. RESULTS: The diagnosis of IBD was made in 639 children, which corresponds to a mean annual incidence of 5.8 per 100,000. The incidence increased from 4.6 per 100,000 per year from 1984 through 1986 to 7.0 from 1993 through 1995. It reflected an increase in UC from 1.4 to 3.2 per 100,000 per year, which is a significant yearly percentage of increase (8%; confidence interval, 2-14%; P < 0.05). In contrast, no change occurred in the incidence of CD (1.2-1.3 per 100,000). The incidence of IC and PCD also remained fairly stable. The percentages of children who underwent surgery decreased from 17.3% in the first 6 years to 4.6% in the last 6 years (P < 0.001). Surgery was performed in 27.7% of CD and 5.3% of UC cases. The median age at diagnosis was 12.2 years for UC, 13.0 years for CD, 11.2 for IC, and 11.2 for PCD. At diagnosis, 48 children (7.5%) were 5 years of age or less, whereas most of the patients were 11 years of age or more (398 children, 62.3%). CONCLUSIONS: In Sweden, the incidence of UC has increased, whereas that of CD remains the same. A significant number of children were classified with IC and PCD. In most children, IBD was diagnosed when they were 11 years old or more, but some cases were detected even in those below 6 years of age. A decrease in the frequency of surgery occurred during the study.},

More than 60 cases were known to occur worldwide before dosage guidelines were enforced. Predisposing factors were young age, previous intestinal surgery, meconium ileus equivalent, and use of H2 blockers, corticosteroids, and DNase. Abnormal features included foreshortened colon, strictures, marked submucosal fibrosis, ascites, and nodular hyperplasia of the liver. Histologic examination showed eosinophilia, mild cryptitis, epithelial regeneration, and widespread interruption of the muscularis mucosa. These findings are distinct from, but share many of the features of, those of Crohn's's disease and ischemic bowel disease. The pathogenic mechanisms remain unknown.},

   abstract = {Because of the large liver stores (about 5 mg), low turnover rate (0.143%) and small daily requirement (3 micrograms), vitamin B12 deficiency does not occur under normal circumstances. This is not the case in individuals with chronic inflammatory or trophic changes at vitamin B12 absorption sites. Without supplementation, vitamin B12 deficiency can be expected within 5 years of gastrectomy. Characteristic features of type A gastritis are hyposecretion and mucosal atrophy in the fundus and body of the stomach, with absent intrinsic factor. In the small intestine, active and/or passive absorption is impaired by extensive ileal resection, exocrine pancreatic insufficiency and chronic inflammatory disorders such as Crohn's disease. Definitive plasma concentrations cannot be quoted for vitamin B12 deficiency. Dietary habits, subjective symptoms, hematological laboratory results, function tests and gastrointestinal endoscopic and histological findings must all be taken into account in the diagnosis. Modern diagnostic parameters, such as methylmalonic acid and homocysteine serum assays, are useful for achieving early diagnosis and hence optimal treatment. With their assured availability, parenteral vitamin B12 preparations remain the treatment of choice. Results from vitamin B12 bioavailability studies in healthy subjects suggest that > 300 micrograms probably suffices as an oral maintenance dose after parenteral loading. Further well-documented cases are needed in order to establish whether these doses are adequate in malabsorption syndromes and gastrointestinal diseases. Various case reports indicate the value of prophylactic and therapeutic oral vitamin B12 administration, especially in disorders of homocysteine metabolism, a substance postulated as a further important risk factor for atherosclerosis.},

DESIGN: Cross-sectional study by means of validated questionnaires. SUBJECTS: All GP-trainees in training at the eight university departments for vocational training in the Netherlands in September, 1998 (n = 985). MAIN OUTCOME MEASURES: Reliability of determinants of nutrition guidance practices was calculated by means of Crohnbach's alpha. The mechanism of action of determinants was identified by means of linear structural relationship analysis (LISREL) using a model developed for GPs. RESULTS: Crohnbach's alphas for factors ranged from 0.58-0.90. The empirical GP-trainee-data fitted with the corresponding GP-model on the mechanism of action. CONCLUSIONS: The same predisposing factors, driving forces and barriers as found with GPs were identified with GP-trainees. Comparing the GP-and GP-trainee-models, only minor differences were found in the path coefficients between factors. Lack of nutrition training and education proved to be of great influence on the extent of nutrition information given. The GP-trainee-model will be of use in developing computer-based instruction on nutrition. It is expected that GPs may also benefit from this instruction.},

This review highlights the past year's advances concerning epidemiologic studies, new diagnostic considerations, and novel therapeutic approaches. Epidemiologic studies confirmed that Crohn's disease is being increasingly diagnosed in children, whereas the incidence of ulcerative colitis has remained stable. African-American children are as likely to have inflammatory bowel disease as other children. Serologic assays specific for Crohn's disease and ulcerative colitis can assist clinicians in screening for inflammatory bowel disease, as well as discriminating between the two diseases. Studies have revealed that osteopenia and antioxidant vitamin deficiency are common and require screening in pediatric inflammatory bowel disease. Increasing experience with immunosuppressive drugs (6-mercaptopurine, azathioprine) point to their efficacy and generally good toxicity profile in pediatric patients.},

   abstract = {Cytokines are low-molecular-weight mediators of cellular communication produced by multiple cell types in the liver, with the Kupffer cell critically important. Inflammatory cytokines such as tumor necrosis factor, interleukin-1, and interleukin-8, and hepatic acute-phase cytokines such as interleukin-6 play a role in modulating certain metabolic complications in alcoholic liver disease and probably play a role in the liver injury of alcoholic liver disease. Two potential inducers of cytokine production in alcoholic liver disease are endotoxin and reactive oxygen species generated after ethanol metabolism. Cytotoxic cytokines likely induce liver cell death by both necrosis and apoptosis in alcoholic liver disease. Anticytokine therapy has been highly successful in attenuating cell injury/death in a variety of toxin-induced models of liver injury, including alcohol-related liver injury. Anticytokine therapy has been used successfully in humans in disease processes such as Crohn's disease and rheumatoid arthritis. There is an emerging rationale for use of anticytokine therapy in alcoholic liver disease, with the goal of maintaining beneficial effects of cytokines and inhibition of the deleterious effects of these potentially toxic agents.},

   abstract = {The etiology and pathogenesis of inflammatory bowel disease (IBD) remains an area under intense investigation. Cytokine secretion, which is important in the regulation of normal gastrointestinal immune responses, appears to be dysregulated in IBD. In Crohn's disease, there appears to be an excessive T(H)1 T-cell response to an antigenic stimulus, leading to increased levels of proinflammatory cytokines, such as interferon-gamma (IFN-gamma), interleukin (IL)-12, IL-1, IL-6, and tumor necrosis factor-alpha (TNF-alpha). In ulcerative colitis, a T(H)2 T-cell response appears to be the pathological process responsible for the inflammatory disease. New and innovative therapeutic strategies targeting cytokines, such as TNF-alpha, are producing some promising results in animal and human studies. As more is learned about the complex cytokine interactions in IBD, more effective treatments will undoubtedly ensue.},

   abstract = {Parenteral nutrition corrects for or prevents malnutrition in patients with acute or chronic bowel disease. Whether acute (a few days to a few weeks) or chronic (a few weeks to several years), there are two pathophysiological mechanisms of bowel disease leading to malnutrition: motricity disorders and defective absorption. Total parenteral nutrition has to be prescribed in three situations: occlusive intestinal stenosis, pseudo-obstruction with complete food intolerance, clinically or endoscopically severe colitis. The indication for total parenteral nutrition to allow the intestine to "rest" is indicated in case of digestive fistulae with a high flow and for inflammatory bowel disease (Crohn's disease, irradiated bowel disease). In other cases, parenteral nutrition can be used as a complement to poorly tolerated or quantitatively insufficient oral or enteral nutrition to maintain the patient's nutritional status or correct for malnutrition. Peripheral (<3 weeks) or central (>3 weeks) parenteral nutrition, like all types of nutritional support, must be complete and conducted according to a rigorous written protocol specific for each indication, particularly acute versus chronic intestinal disease, in order to avoid iatrogenic and metabolic risks. This goal can be best achieved by developing a nutritional team within each hospital. Two other important goals are to enhance the efficacy of the nutritional support and to avoid inappropriate prescriptions, notably for parenteral administration. Such an approach allows a better risk/benefit ratio evaluated with nutritional standards. These are the prerequisites for nutritional therapy to be recognized as a major discipline in medicine.},

   abstract = {BACKGROUND: Although malnutrition is frequently observed in Crohn disease (CD), its cause is not clear. Regulation of energy metabolism and diet-induced thermogenesis (DIT) have not been adequately studied in CD. OBJECTIVE: The aim was to study DIT and substrate oxidation in patients with inactive ileal CD. DESIGN: After a test meal providing 50.2 kJ/kg body wt, DIT was assessed by indirect calorimetry performed over 360 min in 18 CD patients and 12 healthy volunteers matched for age, sex, weight, and height. Body composition was evaluated with the labeled-water-bolus injection technique. RESULTS: Fat-free mass did not differ significantly between groups, but CD patients had markedly lower fat mass than control subjects (13.8+/-5.63 compared with 19.0+/-3.49 kg; P < 0.001). Nonprotein respiratory quotient was lower in CD patients than control subjects (0.80+/-0.04 compared with 0.86+/-0.03; P < 0.001). Average respiratory quotient between 75 and 150 min after the test meal was 0.85+/-0.03 in CD patients and 0.91+/-0.02 in control subjects (P < 0.001). Lipid oxidation rate was higher in CD patients than in control subjects (2.26+/-1.13 compared with 1.50+/-0.75 kJ/min; P < 0.05). DIT was higher in CD patients than in control subjects (9.89+/-1.93% compared with 5.67+/-0.91% of energy intake; P < 0.001). CONCLUSIONS: Patients with inactive ileal CD had significantly higher DIT and lipid oxidation rate than do healthy volunteers. These results may explain why CD patients have difficulty maintaining adequate nutritional status, and the findings also suggest that a diet relatively rich in fat may attain better energy balance.},

We investigated the glutathione concentration of the colonic mucosa in biopsies from patients with active Crohn's colitis depending on nutritional status. METHODS: Endoscopic biopsies were taken in 10 well-nourished control patients, and 18 patients with active Crohn's disease (11 well-nourished, seven malnourished with a recent weight loss > 10 %). Colonic biopsies were taken from healthy and inflamed mucosa and analysed for total glutathione concentration. RESULTS: Mucosal glutathione concentration (nmol/mg wet tissue) was lower in patients with active colitis both in diseased and healthy mucosa as compared with controls (1.89 +/- 0.39, 2.08 +/- 0.4 and 6.69 +/- 4. 94, respectively, P< 0.05). Mucosal glutathione was lower in healthy mucosa from malnourished versus well-nourished patients: 1.8 +/- 0.2 vs 2.3 +/- 0.37 (P= 0.02). CONCLUSIONS: Mucosal glutathione is markedly lower in active Crohn's colitis, even in healthy mucosa; glutathione depletion tends to be more severe in malnourished patients. Glutathione depletion may be related in part to malnutrition and contribute to a prolonged evolution of disease and could be a target for pharmacological and nutritional support.},

   abstract = {BACKGROUND: Children with Crohn's disease may have an impaired quality of life. METHODS: A validated questionnaire was mailed to the parents of all child members of Crohn's in Childhood Research Association (CICRA) (age range, 5-17 years). It investigated aspects of the quality of life of children with Crohn's disease. Sixty-four questionnaires were returned together with another 35 from those outside the defined age range. Patients in the latter group were not included in the analysis. RESULTS: Of the children investigated, 60% had significant absences from school, with a mean of 3+/-2.8 months' absence in the previous year. Most (53%) thought that their teachers knew nothing about Crohn's disease, and 50% thought that teachers were unsympathetic. Of the 24 who had taken examinations 80% thought they had underachieved because of ill health. Sixty-seven percent of children were unable to participate in sports on a regular basis, 60% felt unable to leave the house, and 50% were unable to play with their friends. Information about Crohn's disease had predominantly come from doctors (89%), information booklets (83%), and nursing staff (42%). The commonest questions asked by the children were: what is Crohn's disease (50%), why me (64%), will it affect my schooling (52%), and will it affect my chances of getting a job (67%). CONCLUSION: Children with Crohn's disease have a significantly impaired quality of life. They fear everyday childhood activities and fear for their future. These children need sympathetic management, and effort should be concentrated on improving their day-to-day existence to enable them to lead as normal a life as possible.},

   abstract = {The indications for initiating total parenteral nutrition (TPN) were prospectively evaluated in 100 consecutive patients at a tertiary referral hospital with a long-standing Nutritional Support Service to illustrate the reasons why the parenteral route was chosen at this unique institution in terms of patient population. Sixty male and 40 female patients, average age 59 +/- 17 years (range 22-86 years), were classified a priori as to the underlying reasons for initiation of TPN. The study was conducted by a Nutrition Support Service at this hospital without pediatric, trauma, or burn services specializing in the care of patients with diabetes mellitus. Of the 100 patients, 63% were from the surgical service; 24% had diabetes mellitus. Their mean weight (118 +/- 29% of ideal), body mass index (25 +/- 6 kg/m(2)), and serum albumin (2.8 +/- 0.7 g/dL) indicated a reasonable body composition with a moderate systemic inflammatory response. Six patients received preoperative TPN for an average of 5 +/- 3 days with a variety of diagnoses including malignancy, Crohn's disease, bowel obstruction, and gastrointestinal bleeding. The underlying reasons for initiating nutritional support were related to three factors that largely determine the need for involuntary feeding: preexisting protein calorie malnutrition, actual or anticipated semistarvation for a prolonged period, and the presence of a systemic inflammatory response. The choice of TPN was based on anticipated or proven intolerance to full enteral feeding. The duration of time before initiation of TPN postoperatively was 6 +/- 5 days, which reflects our policy that initially well-nourished patients who are experiencing a systemic inflammatory response should not undergo more than 5 to 7 days of inadequate feeding. The duration of TPN overall was 11 +/- 10 days, which primarily illustrates the dramatic reduction in length of hospital stay that has occurred throughout the health care system and the willingness to provide TPN in alternative settings including transitional care units, rehabilitation hospitals, and for short-term care, the patient's home. The most common specific reasons identified for initiating TPN rather than enteral nutrition were ileus (25%), an underlying acid-base or electrolyte/mineral disorder (13%) requiring correction, and the convenience of TPN because a central venous catheter was in place (12%). The usual indication for nutritional support at this tertiary referral and specialty hospital was actual or impending protein calorie malnutrition. TPN was chosen for a variety of reasons related to actual or anticipated tolerance to enteral feeding. This audit demonstrates that our TPN practice has evolved in relation to time of initiation and duration of feeding, which reflect a clearer appreciation of the risks and benefits of TPN.},

Gastric involvement in patients with Crohn's disease is common. Enterocutaneous fistulas from the stomach are rare. Percutaneous endoscopic gastrostomy (PEG) insertion and subsequent removal rarely cause problems in patients with Crohn's disease. Endoscopic removal of a PEG is advised in patients with Crohn's disease. Steroids may delay gastric adhesion to the anterior abdominal wall.},

   abstract = {Short bowel syndrome most commonly results after bowel resections for Crohn's disease. The normal human small intestinal length ranges from about 3 to 8 m, thus if the initial small intestinal length is short, a relatively small resection of the intestine may result in the problems of a short bowel. Two types of patient with a short bowel are encountered in clinical practice: those with their jejunum anastomosed to a functioning colon, and those with a jejunostomy. Both types of patient have problems absorbing adequate macronutrients, and both need long-term vitamin B12 therapy. Patients with a jejunostomy also have major problems with large stomal losses of water, sodium, and magnesium. This high-volume jejunostomy output is treated by restricting oral fluids, giving a glucose-saline solution to drink, and using drugs that either reduce gastrointestinal motility (loperamide or codeine phosphate) or secretions (H2 antagonists, proton pump inhibitors, or octreotide). Patients whose jejunal length is less than 100 cm, and whose stomal output is greater than their oral intake, benefit most from antisecretory drugs. In patients with a retained colon, bacterial fermentation of unabsorbed carbohydrate in the colon results in energy being salvaged. However, they have increased oxalate absorption and a 25% chance of developing calcium oxalate renal stones. Thus patients with a colon are advised to eat a high-energy diet rich in carbohydrate but low in oxalate. Patients with a jejunostomy need a high-energy iso-osmolar diet with added salt. Both patient types have a 45% prevalence of gallstones. With current therapy most patients with a short bowel have a normal body mass index and a good quality of life.},

   abstract = {BACKGROUND & AIMS: The Pediatric Crohn's Disease Activity Index (PCDAI) is a multi-item measure that, in contrast to the adult-derived CDAI, includes linear growth and places less emphasis on subjectively reported symptoms but more on laboratory parameters of intestinal inflammation. This study compared the feasibility, validity, and responsiveness of PCDAI vs. CDAI in the assessment of Crohn's disease activity among pediatric patients. METHODS: Eighty-one children and adolescents with Crohn's disease were studied. A gastroenterologist provided a categorical global assessment of disease activity as quiescent, mild, moderate, or severe after interview and physical examination. CDAI and PCDAI scores were calculated by an independent appraiser. RESULTS: Mean values within each category for CDAI and PCDAI differed significantly between strata. PCDAI values were quiescent, 6.8 +/- 6. 6; mild, 18.7 +/- 7.3; moderate, 38.5 +/- 12.9; and severe, 54.2 +/- 14.0. CDAI values were quiescent, 23.5 +/- 53.6; mild, 96.0 +/- 60. 7; moderate, 184.5 +/- 97.0; and severe, 284.4 +/- 85.8. Individual scores showed less overlap between strata for PCDAI than for CDAI. PCDAI showed better correlation with serum orosomucoid and platelet count, laboratory parameters of inflammation not included in either index. CONCLUSIONS: Both PCDAI and CDAI reflect disease activity in pediatric Crohn's disease. PCDAI is better at discriminating between levels of disease activity.},

Social relations and status may influence the course of the disease. Social support, information on the disease and patients higher educational degree have positive effects on the acceptation and compliance of the disease. Surprisingly negatively is the disease influenced by stable partnership and parenthood. Affective symptoms can be managed with the use of psychological methods. We proved it on reconditioning stays with structured programme. Their application led to reduction of neurotic and depressive symptoms, improvement of physical condition, better ability to relax physically and emotionally, the ability to harmonize psychical and physical functions, to cope with stress and the patients have established social contacts with other persons suffering from the same disease with the aim to promote conscious care of one's own health condition. Psycho-educational programme is extraordinary important in new diagnosed patients, for their ability to cope with the disease, and as a help for their future life arrangement. The techniques used to deal with stress can be helpful for prolonging the remission period. It was confirmed that psychological methods may contribute to life quality improvement in Crohn's disease patients. Self-help activities in the form of clubs and reconditioning stays reveal as very useful. Psycho-social intervention should become a part of complex care of patients with Crohn's disease.

Drawing from clinical experience of the treatment of other disorders associated with gastrointestinal inflammation, such as ulcerative colitis and Crohn's disease, a number of therapeutic alternatives may be relevant for the bone marrow transplant patient with significant graft-vs.-host disease (GvHD). Options to consider include therapeutics that alter inflammatory cell migration, anti-inflammatory cytokines, direct neutralization of proinflammatory cytokines, and cytokines that promote epithelial restitution in the gastrointestinal mucosa. In addition, a variety of nutritional and other novel treatments are available, which may improve epithelial function or which have anti-inflammatory actions. Prospective studies of combined nutrient and cytokine-modulating treatments for the bone marrow transplant patient are warranted.},

   abstract = {BACKGROUND AND AIMS: As reactive oxygen has been demonstrated to participate in immune genes transcription, the aim of this study was to examine the relationship between systemic concentrations of several antioxidants and markers of inflammatory and immune activation in patients with Crohn's disease (CD). METHODS: In 26 CD patients and 15 controls we compared plasma selenium and zinc concentrations, erythrocyte glutathione peroxidase (GSHPx) and superoxide dismutase activities, as well as erythrocyte sedimentation rate (ESR), C-reactive protein, tumor necrosis factor-alpha, interleukin-6, blood neopterin and soluble receptors of interleukin-2 (sIL-2R), and examined the link between these parameters. RESULTS: Selenium concentration and GSHPx activity were decreased in CD patients (54.5 +/- 3.2 vs 79 &plusmn 2.2 microg/l, P<< 0.05; 28 +/- 1.6 vs 38 +/- 2.6 IU/g Hb, P<< 0.05) and positively correlated to each other's (r= 0.59, P<< 0.01). TNF-alpha was significantly increased in patients (18 +/- 2.6 vs 5 +/- 0.6 pg/ml;P<< 0.001), negatively correlated to GSHPx activity (r= -0.56, P<< 0.05) and selenium concentration (r= -0.72, P<< 0.001), and positively to neopterin and sIL-2R concentrations. Selenium showed negative correlation with sIL-2R (r= -0.83, P<< 0.0001) and ESR. CONCLUSIONS: In CD patients low selenium concentration may participate in reduced GSHPx activity facilitating inflammatory and immune activation. In these patients, selenium monitoring and, if needed, supplementation may be of therapeutical interest.},

   abstract = {Human milk lipids contain preformed LCPUFA in considerable amounts, which serve as precursors for the formation of prostaglandins, prostacyclins, and other lipid mediators, as well as essential components in membrane-rich tissues (such as the brain and the retina), thus affecting functional outcomes. Besides a balanced nutrient composition and a number of conditionally essential nutrients, human milk provides different types and classes of bioactive factors, such as enzymes, hormones, and growth factors, many of which appear to have a role in supporting infantile growth and development. The bioactive agents include antimicrobial factors (e.g., secretory IgA, oligosaccharides, FA); anti-inflammatory agents; transporters (e.g., lactoferrin); and digestive enzymes (e.g., BSSL). Several nonpeptide hormones (thyroid hormones, cortisol, progesterone, pregnanediol, estrogens, and artificial contraceptive) and peptide hormones and growth factors (erythropoietin, hHG, gonadotropin-releasing hormone, epidermal growth factor insulin, insulin-like growth factor-I, nerve growth factor, transforming growth factor-alpha, gastrointestinal regulatory peptides and thyroid-parathyroid hormones) have been isolated and quantitated in human milk. Some of these components are also involved in the maturation of the gastrointestinal tract of the infant. In addition to the passive benefits provided by human milk, several data support the hypothesis that breastfeeding promotes the development of the infant's own immune system, which might confer long-term benefits for the newborn infant. The risk of IDDM, Crohn's disease, and atopic disease is lower in individuals who had been breastfed during infancy. Areas of major interest in human milk research include the study of human milk synthesis and the contributions of dietary composition and maternal metabolism to human milk composition, infantile utilization of human milk components, and the study of bioactive components, such as oligosaccharides, proteins and peptides, and lipids and their in vivo fate and biologic effects in the recipient infant.},

   abstract = {Structured lipid emulsion, an innovative approach in which both medium-chain and long-chain fatty acids are esterified to the same glycerol backbone, has been recently shown to be a safe and efficient way of providing energy to patients requiring parenteral nutrition. As yet, no assessment has been made of its safety and effect on liver functions during long-term treatment. Twenty-two home parenteral nutrition patients with Crohn's disease or short bowel syndrome were enrolled in a double-blind randomized, cross-over study. Twenty patients who completed the study were treated for 4 wk with a structured lipid emulsion and for 4 wk with long-chain triacylglycerol emulsion. Determined every 1 or 2 wk were blood pressure, body weight, respiratory rate, blood count, liver functions, albumin, transferrin, plasma lipids, free fatty acids (FFAs), and, at the end of each treatment period (weeks 4 and 8), plasma dicarboxylic acids and 3-OH-fatty acids. No differences were observed between the groups or within the groups between the two treatments with respect to either clinical safety and adverse event occurrence or laboratory assessments. Plasma dicarboxylic acids and 3-OH-fatty acids were similar and within normal range. No alteration of liver function occurred in any of the patients treated with the structured lipid emulsion, whereas two of the patients receiving long-chain triaclyglycerol emulsion developed abnormal liver function, which resolved after switching to the structured lipid emulsion. In conclusion, structured triacylyglycerols containing both medium- and long-chain fatty acids appear to be safe and well tolerated on a long-term basis in patients on home parenteral nutrition, and it may be associated with possible reduction in liver dysfunction.},

   abstract = {Crohn's disease (CD) is frequently complicated by various nutritional disturbances. Although it is important to correct these disturbances, the nutritional status of CD patients has been poorly documented, especially concerning vitamin status. The aims of this study were (a) to measure the serum concentrations of vitamin A and six other carotenoids (lutein, zeaxanthin, alpha-, beta-carotene, alpha-, beta-cryptoxanthin) in patients with CD and to compare them with those in healthy controls and (b) to follow the changes of serum carotenoid levels in CD patients during treatment. Twenty-eight patients with CD and 23 healthy persons were included in this study. The results of twelve patients were followed up through one year. The patients were free of any nutritional treatment. The serum concentrations of carotenoids were measured with high-pressure liquid chromatography (HPLC). The serum concentrations of five carotenoids were significantly lower in the patients than in the controls (vitamin A, zeaxanthin: P < 0.001; alpha-, beta-carotene: P < 0.01; lutein: P < 0.05). The carotenoid status of the followed patients advanced to the normal range, but this increase was not significant. These findings suggest that there is a deficiency of vitamin A and its provitamins in Crohn' s disease prior to treatment. However, because we did not evaluate the vitamin intake in this study, we could not conclude which of the factors--poor intake, increased requirement, or malabsorption--was more important in decreasing of carotenoid levels.},

   abstract = {BACKGROUND: The breakdown of glycosaminoglycans is an important consequence of inflammation at mucosal surfaces, and inhibition of metalloprotease activity may be effective in treating chronic inflammation. AIM: To report an alternative approach, using the nutriceutical agent N-acetyl glucosamine (GlcNAc), an amino-sugar directly incorporated into glycosaminoglycans and glycoproteins, as a substrate for tissue repair mechanisms. METHODS: GlcNAc (total daily dose 3-6 g) was administered orally as adjunct therapy to 12 children with severe treatment-resistant inflammatory bowel disease (10 Crohn's disease, 2 ulcerative colitis). Seven of these children suffered from symptomatic strictures. In addition, similar doses were administered rectally as sole therapy in nine children with distal ulcerative colitis or proctitis resistant to steroids and antibiotics. Where pre- and post-treatment biopsies were available (nine cases), histochemical assessment of epithelial and matrix glycosaminoglycans and GlcNAc residues was made. FINDINGS: Eight of the children given oral GlcNAc showed clear improvement, while four required resection. Of the children with symptomatic Crohn's stricture, only 3 of 7 have required surgery over a mean follow-up of > 2.5 years, and endoscopic or radiological improvement was detected in the others. Rectal administration induced remission in two cases, clear improvement in three and no effect in two. In all cases biopsied there was evidence of histological improvement, and a significant increase in epithelial and lamina propria glycosaminoglycans and intracellular GlcNAc. CONCLUSIONS: GlcNAc shows promise as an inexpensive and nontoxic treatment in chronic inflammatory bowel disease, with a mode of action which is distinct from conventional treatments. It may have the potential to be helpful in stricturing disease. However, controlled trials and an assessment of enteric-release preparations are required to confirm its efficacy and establish indications for use.},

The aim of this study was to analyze the perioperative morbidity and mortality in 104 of 138 consecutive patients treated for CD complications using bowel-sparing techniques. We also considered the factors that may be related to the risk of perioperative complications and the long-term outcome. METHODS: One hundred and four patients were treated with SP and/or MR and then included in a prospectively maintained database. The factors claimed to influence perioperative complications were analyzed using Fisher's exact test for categorical observations and the Mann-Whitney U test for continuous variables. A multivariate analysis, using logistic regression, and a long-term time-to-event analysis using the Kaplan-Meier function, were also performed. RESULTS: Perioperative mortality was nil. In relation to the 6 postoperative complications (5.8%), 4 patients underwent minimal bowel resection (MR), 1 a MR with SP, and 1 SP alone. Three of these patients (2.9%) needed reoperation for septic complications, and 3 (2.9%) were treated as outpatients for enterocutaneous fistulas. A correlation (p < 0.05) was found between low serum hemoglobin levels and postoperative complications at univariate and multivariate analyses. The 5-year surgical recurrence-free rate was 75% overall, 73% for patients treated with SP, 78% with MR, and 77% with MR + SP. CONCLUSIONS: Postoperative complications are not related to conservative or miniresective surgery even when active disease is present at the resection margins or the site of SP. The higher risk reported for patients with low serum hemoglobin and hematocrit levels suggests that surgeons should consider using preoperative iron and vitamin support, parenteral nutrition and erythropoietin therapy, when necessary, in those cases. Our postoperative morbidity, mortality and long-term surgical recurrence rate results support the efficacy and safety of SP and MR surgery in the treatment of complicated CD.},

   abstract = {BACKGROUND: The purpose of this study was to evaluate the incidence of dysplasia and the mucosal adaptation patterns of pelvic pouches in children and adolescents who had undergone ileal pouch-anal anastomosis for ulcerative colitis. METHODS: Between 1982 and 1996, 176 pediatric patients with ulcerative colitis underwent ilial pouch-anal anastomosis. Seventy-six patients were followed up after surgery at the Cleveland Clinic. Pouch biopsy specimens were reviewed for dysplasia and to determine mucosal adaptation patterns. Fifty-eight of the 76 patients had an average of three mucosal biopsies during a mean follow-up of 5 years. Demographic and surgical data were abstracted from archives of medical records. All previously obtained pouch biopsy specimens were re-evaluated by a single pathologist to ensure standardized interpretation. RESULTS: No dysplasia was identified in screening specimens of 76 children and adolescents including 5 patients who showed dysplasia in resected colon specimens. The pattern of mucosal adaptation was categorized using previously reported criteria. Type A was defined as normal mucosa or mild villous atrophy with no or mild inflammation. Type B mucosa showed transient atrophy with temporary moderate inflammation followed by normalization of architecture. Type C mucosa was defined as a pattern of persistent atrophy with severe inflammation. In the study cohort, the patterns of mucosal adaptation, type A (56.9%; n = 33), type B (32.8%; n = 19), and type C (10.3%; n = 6), were comparable with those reported in adults. The rate of pouch failure and diagnosis of Crohn's disease were similar in each group and were not related to the specific adaptation pattern. Most of the patients with type C mucosa had clinical symptoms of pouchitis requiring periodic antibiotic therapy. No dysplasia was identified in any biopsy specimen reviewed. CONCLUSIONS: Similar morphologic changes can be seen in ileal pouches in pediatric and adult patients. There seemed to be no increased risk of dysplasia in children and young adults who had undergone ilial pouch-anal anastomosis surgery for ulcerative colitis during a 5 year follow-up. Because the long-term risk of development of dysplasia is unknown, an initial screening should be performed 5 years after the creation of a pelvic pouch in children or when the total disease duration exceeds 7 years. Once identified, patients with Type C mucosa should have annual screening for dysplasia until further data become available.},

In patients with urolithiasis, conservative therapy was effective. An ureteral obstruction was detected on the right side in all 4 of these cases because of the inflamed terminal ileum. In 2 of the 4 cases, the symptoms improved by either preoperative total parenteral nutrition or elemental diet therapy. A resection of the inflamed intestine was necessary in all cases. In patients with urinary fistulas, a resection of the inflamed intestine combined with a reconstruction of the urinary tract was carried out after total parenteral nutrition. In conclusion, conservative therapy with preoperative total parenteral nutrition or elemental diet therapy proved to be effective for a ureteral obstruction since it improved the intestinal inflammation. As a definitive treatment, surgery is still necessary for the management of urinary fistulas and ureteral obstruction. Based on our findings, patients with urolithiasis in Crohn's disease should thus be treated conservatively in the same way as patients without Crohn's disease.},

Puberty is also frequently delayed. Over 50% of patients may have a subnormal height velocity, and approximately 25% will have short stature. The endocrine status is characterized by normal growth hormone secretion and a slightly subnormal serum level of insulin-like growth factor I, which is related to nutritional status. Principal therapeutic options are intestinal resection for localized disease, and enteral nutrition--using a polymeric diet--for more widespread disease, particularly involving the small intestine. Growth responses to both modalities are often excellent and produce considerable psychological benefit. Optimum therapy is achieved by close collaboration between gastroenterologists and endocrinologists, and by the use of auxological methods to document pre- and post-therapeutic management.},

Energy metabolism was evaluated by indirect calorimetry in 32 patients with active Crohn's disease and 19 age- and sex-matched healthy individuals. Measurements were done in the postabsorptive state. Seven out of 32 patients received enteral nutrition via a nasogastric tube. In these patients, resting energy metabolism was determined at d 0 (postabsorptive), 7, 14 (during full enteral nutrition) and 15 (postabsorptive). Resting energy expenditure was not significantly different between patients and controls, whereas the respiratory quotient (RQ) was lower in patients (0.78 +/- 0.05 vs. 0.86 +/- 0.05; P < 0.05). During enteral nutrition in 7 patients with Crohn's disease, the RQ increased on d 7 compared with d 0 and remained high even after cessation of enteral nutrition (d 0, 0.78 +/- 0.03; d 7, 0.91 +/- 0.04; d 15, 0. 84 +/- 0.05; P < 0.05; d 7 and 15 vs. d 0). No effects of enteral nutrition on resting energy expenditure were found. Active Crohn's disease is associated with changes in substrate metabolism that resemble a starvation pattern. These changes appear not to be specific to Crohn's disease but to malnutrition and are readily reversed by enteral nutrition. Enteral nutrition did not affect resting energy expenditure. Wasting is a consequence of malnutrition but not of hypermetabolism in Crohn's disease.},

Activation of nuclear factor kappa B (NFkappaB), which is involved in their gene transcription, is increased in the intestinal mucosa of CD patients. As butyrate enemas may be beneficial in treating colonic inflammation, we investigated if butyrate promotes this effect by acting on proinflammatory cytokine expression. METHODS: Intestinal biopsy specimens, isolated lamina propria cells (LPMC), and peripheral blood mononuclear cells (PBMC) were cultured with or without butyrate for assessment of secretion of tumour necrosis factor (TNF) and mRNA levels. NFkappaB p65 activation was determined by immunofluorescence and gene reporter experiments. Levels of NFkappaB inhibitory protein (IkappaBalpha) were analysed by western blotting. The in vivo efficacy of butyrate was assessed in rats with trinitrobenzene sulphonic acid (TNBS) induced colitis. RESULTS: Butyrate decreased TNF production and proinflammatory cytokine mRNA expression by intestinal biopsies and LPMC from CD patients. Butyrate abolished lipopolysaccharide (LPS) induced expression of cytokines by PBMC and transmigration of NFkappaB from the cytoplasm to the nucleus. LPS induced NFkappaB transcriptional activity was decreased by butyrate while IkappaBalpha levels were stable. Butyrate treatment also improved TNBS induced colitis. CONCLUSIONS: Butyrate decreases proinflammatory cytokine expression via inhibition of NFkappaB activation and IkappaBalpha degradation. These anti-inflammatory properties provide a rationale for assessing butyrate in the treatment of CD.},

   abstract = {OBJECTIVE: Low bone mineral density (BMD) is a recognized complication of Crohn's disease (CD). The aim of this study was to identify the risk factors for low BMD in pediatric patients with CD. STUDY DESIGN: One hundred nineteen subjects with CD ranging in age from 5 to 25 years were enrolled. BMD of the lumbar spine was measured by dual-energy x-ray absorptiometry. Growth parameters were assessed by examination. Disease-specific variables and use of selected medications were determined by chart review. RESULTS: Powerful risk factors for low BMD z-score included hypoalbuminemia, exposure to nasogastric tube feeds, total parenteral nutrition, 6-mercaptopurine, and corticosteroids. Corticosteroid dosing at a level >7.5 mg/d, 5000 mg lifetime cumulative dose, or >12 months of lifetime exposure were significant risk factors for low BMD z-score. Weaker but significant associations with low BMD z-scores included measures of disease severity such as pediatric Crohn's disease activity index, hospital admissions, and length of hospital stay. Site and duration of disease were not predictive. CONCLUSIONS: The presence of several clinically available factors was predictive of poor bone mineral status in this sample of subjects with CD. Hypoalbuminemia, corticosteroid exposure, nasogastric tube feeds, total parenteral nutrition, and 6-mercaptopurine were the most powerful risk factors for low bone mineral status.},

   abstract = {OBJECTIVE: To examine growth, body composition, and nutritional status in a large sample of children, adolescents, and young adults with Crohn's disease (CD). METHODS: One hundred thirty-two subjects (48 females) with CD, aged 5 to 25 years, and 66 healthy control subjects (37 females) of similar age. Growth, nutritional status, and body composition were measured by anthropometry and dual-energy x-ray absorptiometry. Genetic potential of linear growth was predicted using the adjusted heights of Himes et al. Pubertal status and skeletal age were assessed. Average Pediatric Crohn's Disease Activity Index (PCDAI) and lifetime steroid exposure (in milligrams per day) were obtained from medical charts. The variables were examined in relation to gender and measures of disease activity. RESULTS: Males and females with CD did not differ by age, disease duration, or PCDAI. Males with CD had significantly lower values for growth and nutritional status than control subjects (z-scores for weight: -0.66 +/- 1.18 vs. 0.26 +/- 0.95, P = 0.00002; height -0.81 +/- 1.14 vs. 0.28 +/- 0.93, P = 0.00001; adjusted height -1.05 +/- 1.03 vs. 0.40 +/- 1.03, P = 0.00001) and delayed skeletal age of 0.9 +/- 1.6 years. Impaired linear growth in the males was present regardless of pubertal stage. Associations between disease severity indicators and growth parameters were more consistent for females. CONCLUSIONS: Crohn's disease is associated with impaired growth. Despite similarities in disease duration, activity, and lifetime steroid exposure, growth in males was more impaired. Gender may confer risk for impaired growth in CD.},

METHODS: Retrospective chart review of patients who had intestinal resections as clinical management of complications of CD between 1985 and 1996. Pre- and postoperative measurements of weight and height were reviewed. Z-scores were computed for weight-forage (WAZ), height-for-age (HAZ), and weight-for-height (WHZ). Two tailed t tests were used to compare postoperative growth patterns. Significance was defined as p < 0.05. RESULTS: Twenty-five subjects (8 females, mean age 16.2+/-2.8 years with one operation, and 3 males, mean age 15.7 years with multiple operations) were identified. There were significant improvements in the postoperative growth patterns of subjects who had one operation: HAZ (-1.28+/-1.45 versus -0.98+/-1.37, p = 0.041), WAZ (-1.35+/-1.02 versus -0.74+/-0.93, p = 0.0006) and WHZ (-0.64+/-0.95 versus -0.23+/-0.81, p = 0.036). Furthermore, the magnitude of postoperative weight gain directly correlated with the age at CD diagnosis, R2 = 0.16, p = 0.046. Trends towards improved postoperative WAZ (-0.83 versus -0.49) and HAZ (-0.47 versus -0.27) were also observed in the three subjects who had multiple operations. CONCLUSION: The pattern of weight and height growth was improved after intestinal resection for CD. Nonetheless, close monitoring of postoperative growth is necessary especially in children diagnosed with CD at a young age.},

Twenty-two patients with severely and moderately active ulcerative colitis (8 severe and 14 moderate) and 12 patients with Crohn's colitis were analyzed retrospectively. Eleven of 22 patients with ulcerative colitis were treated with TPN and corticosteroids (TPN group). The remaining 11 patients were treated with corticosteroids alone and hospital meals (oral diet group). Both groups were matched regarding disease severity at pretreatment. The clinical characteristics, and the initial and total dosages of corticosteroids for 3 weeks were similar between the two groups. The authors compared the changes in the clinical, inflammatory, and nutritional parameters and short-term outcome between the TPN and the oral diet groups with ulcerative colitis. The same evaluations were also made for 12 patients with Crohn's colitis who received TPN (CD group). The TPN group did not show any significant improvement in the clinical parameter, inflammatory signs, or nutritional state compared with the oral diet group with ulcerative colitis. The remission rate after 3 weeks of therapy and a colectomy rate also showed no significant difference between the two groups. In contrast, TPN resulted in a disappearance of clinical symptoms and an improvement in both the inflammatory and nutritional parameters in the CD group. Only one of the 12 patients with Crohn's colitis underwent colectomy. TPN induced no additional benefit in corticosteroid therapy in an acute attack of ulcerative colitis. In contrast, TPN may have primary effects on Crohn's colitis.},

   abstract = {Most conventional forms of drug therapy suppress or modify the host immunoinflammatory response and neglect the other contributor to disease pathogenesis-the environmental microflora. Probiotics are live microbial food ingredients that alter the enteric microflora and have a beneficial effect on health. The rationale for using probiotics in IBD is mainly based on evidence from human studies and experimental animal models implicating intestinal bacteria in the pathogenesis of these disorders. The relationship between bacteria and intestinal inflammation is complex and does not appear to reflect a simple cause and effect. Similarly, the field of probiotics is complex and in need of rigorous research. Until the indigenous flora are better characterized and mechanisms of probiotic action defined, the promise of probiotics in IBD is unlikely to be fulfilled. Because of strain-specific variability and clinical and therapeutic heterogeneity within Crohn's disease and ulcerative colitis, it cannot be assumed that a given probiotic is equally suitable for all individuals. Although preliminary results of probiotic therapy in animal models and humans with ulcerative colitis and pouchitis have been encouraging, their efficacy in treatment or maintenance of remission of Crohn's disease remains to be clarified. However, the circumstantial evidence for some form of biotherapeutic modification of the enteric flora in Crohn's disease seems compelling. In the future, probiotics may offer a simple adjunct to conventional therapy with the emphasis on diet shifting from one of nutritional replenishment alone to a more functional role.},

   abstract = {Human beings evolved consuming a diet that contained about equal amounts of n-3 and n-6 essential fatty acids. Over the past 100-150 y there has been an enormous increase in the consumption of n-6 fatty acids due to the increased intake of vegetable oils from corn, sunflower seeds, safflower seeds, cottonseed, and soybeans. Today, in Western diets, the ratio of n-6 to n-3 fatty acids ranges from approximately 20-30:1 instead of the traditional range of 1-2:1. Studies indicate that a high intake of n-6 fatty acids shifts the physiologic state to one that is prothrombotic and proaggregatory, characterized by increases in blood viscosity, vasospasm, and vasoconstriction and decreases in bleeding time. n-3 Fatty acids, however, have antiinflammatory, antithrombotic, antiarrhythmic, hypolipidemic, and vasodilatory properties. These beneficial effects of n-3 fatty acids have been shown in the secondary prevention of coronary heart disease, hypertension, type 2 diabetes, and, in some patients with renal disease, rheumatoid arthritis, ulcerative colitis, Crohn disease, and chronic obstructive pulmonary disease. Most of the studies were carried out with fish oils [eicosapentaenoic acid (EPA) and docosahexaenoic acid (DHA)]. However, alpha-linolenic acid, found in green leafy vegetables, flaxseed, rapeseed, and walnuts, desaturates and elongates in the human body to EPA and DHA and by itself may have beneficial effects in health and in the control of chronic diseases.},

MATERIALS AND METHODS: A devised measurement, vessel density, was estimated with color Doppler US. Patients with Crohn disease underwent clinical and laboratory assessment in which the Crohn disease activity index was measured; patients underwent abdominal US the same week. Color Doppler US was performed by using a 7.5-10.0- or 8.0-12.0-MHz transducer, the lowest possible pulse repetition frequency without aliasing, a low wall filter, and high Doppler gain settings. The length and thickness of the affected loops were measured, and the number of color Doppler signals per square centimeter in the bowel loop was counted. Pulsed Doppler US was used to confirm that the signals originated from arteries or veins and not from movement artifacts. RESULTS: Ninety-two patients (aged 7-20 years; mean, 14.85 years; 44 female, 48 male) underwent 119 examinations; 85 were performed in patients with active disease. Affected loops were thicker (10.6 vs 4. 6 mm; P: <.001) and had a higher vessel density with disease (69 of 119 examinations) than during remission (two of 34 examinations; P: <.001). CONCLUSION: Vessel density in affected bowel loops, as estimated with Doppler US, and bowel wall thickness (>5 mm) reflect disease activity in patients with Crohn disease.},

Severe cholestasis developed and copper was removed from the TPN. Although serum ceruloplasmin levels were within normal limits, 8 weeks after copper removal, he developed pancytopenia. Serum copper levels were severely depressed. Bone marrow biopsy was consistent with copper deficiency; cytoplasmic vacuolization of both myeloid and erythroid precursors, megaloblastic erthropoiesis, and marked hypocellularity were observed. IV replacement with copper sulfate resulted in improvement in the patient's anemia, neutropenia, and thrombocytopenia, but the patient died suddenly from cardiac tamponade. Postmortem examination revealed fibrinous and hemorrhagic pericarditis. Despite the rare occurrence of overt copper deficiency, this case emphasizes the need to recognize copper deficiency as an important etiology of iron-resistant anemia in patients receiving TPN. Furthermore, the relative rapidity with which our patient developed pancytopenia suggests that, in view of the established recommendation that copper be removed from TPN in cholestatic conditions, serum copper levels must be measured periodically.},

To answer questions about the effects on ONS on body weight and structure, spontaneous food intake and body function, a critical systematic review was undertaken (Stratton & Elia, 1999a). Eighty-four trials were reviewed (forty-five randomized, thirty-nine non-randomized: 2,570 patients; diagnoses including chronic obstructive pulmonary disease, Crohn's disease, cystic fibrosis, human immunodeficiency virus and acquired immune deficiency syndrome and cancer). Most studies (83 %) were conducted in patients living at home. The supplements were typically mixed macronutrients in liquid form, providing < 0.42-10.5 MJ/d for 1 week-2 years. The studies reviewed in patients with predominantly chronic conditions living in the community suggested that: (1) ONS produce demonstrable clinical (including functional) benefits, but the nature and extent of these benefits varies with the underlying chronic condition; (2) ONS increase total energy intake with > 50 % of the energy from ONS typically additional to that from habitual food intake; (3) improvements in body weight, total energy intake and body function following ONS appear to occur more frequently in individuals with a BMI < 20 kg/m2 than in those with a BMI > 20 kg/m2.},

Complications such as abscess and fistula may arise, and the morbidity of surgery is high. METHODS: Two cases of refractory esophageal Crohn's disease were confirmed by endoscopy and biopsy. Percutaneous endoscopic gastrostomies (PEGs) were inserted and used for enteral nutrition for 9 and 1 month, respectively. RESULTS: The PEGs were well tolerated. Symptoms subsided rapidly, and later gastroscopies confirmed healing of the esophageal ulcers. No complications occurred, and the gastrostomy sites closed quickly after removal of the tubes, with minimal scarring. CONCLUSIONS: Enteral feeding via PEG appears to be safe and well tolerated and may be of great value in the management not only of esophageal Crohn's disease but also of refractory disease at other sites.},

   abstract = {Short bowel syndrome can result from either a single massive intestinal resection or repeated lesser resections, which might have prognostic implications. The aim of this study was to compare patient populations and outcome of short bowel syndrome caused by massive and repeated resection. The records of 95 adult patients with short bowel syndrome evaluated over a 20-year period were reviewed. Massive resection was performed in 72 patients (76%) and repeated lesser resections in 23 patients (24%). Patients undergoing massive resection were more likely to be more than 70 years of age (26% vs. 9%, P <0.05). Mesenteric vascular disease was more prevalent among patients undergoing massive resection (39% vs. 9%, P <0.05), whereas Crohn's disease was less prevalent (1% vs. 35%, P <0. 05). Distribution of remnant length, presence of the ileocecal junction, and presence of a stoma were similar. Patients undergoing massive resection were more likely to require parenteral nutrition after the first year (56% vs. 23%, P <0.05). Patients with very short remnants (<60 cm) were more likely to receive parenteral nutrition after massive resection (95% vs. 60%, P <0.05). Thirty-day mortality was higher after massive resection (24% vs. 4%, P <0.05). However, those surviving 30 days had similar survival rates at 1 year and 5 years after massive and repeated resections. Patients undergoing massive vs. repeated resections are different with respect to age, underlying condition, and nutritional support needs. These factors may influence overall outcome in short bowel syndrome. The better nutritional prognosis of patients undergoing repeated resection given similar intestinal remnants may be related in part to enhanced intestinal adaptation.},

   abstract = {BACKGROUND: The outcome of the short bowel syndrome (SBS) is influenced by several factors including intestinal disease, remnant length and location, the other digestive organs, and intestinal adaptation. Because underlying inflammatory disease might influence several of these, the aim of this study was to evaluate the outcome of SBS in inflammatory conditions. METHODS: A total of 106 adult patients with SBS evaluated over a 20-year period were studied. Thirty (28%) patients had either Crohn's disease (n = 10) or radiation enteritis (n = 20). RESULTS: Multiple resections were more common in the inflammatory group (57% versus 12%, P <0.05.) These patients had longer intestinal remnants but the type of colonic remnant and the presence of an ileal remnant, the ileocecal junction and a stoma was similar in both groups. A similar proportion of patients in both groups required parenteral nutrition (PN) in the first year (73% versus 68%). Patients with inflammatory conditions were less likely to require PN after the first year (33% versus 63%; P<0.05). CONCLUSION: Patients with SBS resulting from inflammatory disease appear to have a better nutritional prognosis after the first year. While they are more likely to have had multiple resections and develop SBS with longer remnant length, inflammatory disease itself is an important prognostic factor. This may be related to resolution of inflammatory disease or a greater adaptive response.},

The aim of this work was to compare the demographic and clinical data at diagnosis and the initial treatments of patients with diffuse jejuno-ileitis of Crohn's disease and to the ones without this localization. PATIENTS AND METHODS: For demographic and clinical studies, 48 (32M/16F) incident cases of diffuse jejuno-ileitis of Crohn's disease diagnosed between 1988 and 1994 in the EPIMAD register were compared with 96 (48M/48F) controls diagnosed the same year. As far as for the therapeutic management, the 48 incident cases were compared with 48 controls. RESULTS: Diffuse jejuno-ileitis constituted 3.3% of the total incident cases. Median age at diagnosis was significantly lower (20 vs 23 years, P = 0.01) and an upper digestive involvement was more frequent (56% vs 34%, P = 0.03) in patients with diffuse jejuno-ileitis. These patients were more often treated by total parenteral nutrition (43.8% vs 19.6%, P = 0.01) or azathioprine (50% vs 20.8%, P = 0.005). Azathioprine was also introduced earlier (20.7 vs 40.3 months, P = 0.009). Surgery for resection was less often required in diffuse jejuno-ileitis than in controls (65.2% vs 99.8%, P = 0.02) while more stricturoplasties were performed (52.9% vs 10%, P = 0.003); overall surgical rates did not significantly differ in the 2 groups. CONCLUSION: Our series suggest that diffuse jejuno-ileitis of Crohn's disease is a subgroup of patients characterized by a young age at diagnosis, with more frequent and earlier requirement for azathioprine.},

The purpose of this study was to verify whether concentrations of eosinophilic cationic protein in gut lavage fluid from children with inflammatory bowel disease correlate with clinical and laboratory indexes of disease activity. METHODS: Twenty-three children with Crohn's disease, 14 with ulcerative colitis, and 22 age-matched control subjects entered the study. Radioimmunoassay and sandwich enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay techniques were used to measure eosinophilic cationic protein, total immunoglobulin G and interleukin-1beta, respectively. RESULTS: Gut lavage eosinophilic cationic protein levels were significantly (p < 0.005) higher in patients with Crohn's disease and ulcerative colitis than in control subjects. Intestinal eosinophilic cationic protein levels decreased in three of four children with Crohn's disease who were fed an elemental diet. There was a significant (p < 0.001) correlation between eosinophilic cationic protein concentrations and immunoglobulin G and interleukin-1beta levels in gut lavage fluid. CONCLUSIONS: Elevated intestinal eosinophilic cationic protein levels in inflammatory bowel disease suggest that eosinophils are involved in the gastrointestinal inflammation in this disease. Intestinal eosinophilic cationic protein concentration is another marker with which to discriminate between active and inactive inflammatory bowel disease.},

We developed an n-3 fatty acid-rich diet and carried out nutritional education specifically for Crohn's disease patients using HEN to facilitate compliance and to improve their nutritional status. After the introduction of this n-3 rich diet, disease activity was not altered, and nutritional status, especially serum n-3 fatty acid levels, improved. The remission periods in patients with poor compliance seemed to be prolonged by the nutritional education. Thus, a n-3 rich diet in combination with nutritional education specific for Crohn's disease patients is very important for the in maintenance of high compliance and for maintaining nutritional balance.},

   abstract = {Short-bowel syndrome is functionally defined as a state of malabsorption following loss of small bowel. Most cases occur in the neonatal period after extensive resection for necrotizing enterocolitis, or due to congenital anomalies of the gastrointestinal tract. A smaller percentage originate later in life from surgical treatment of Crohn's disease, neoplastic disorders, or vascular events. The physiological, morphological and functional intestinal gradient determines the clinical picture leading to better tolerance of jejunal than ileal resections. The subsequent adaptation process requires enteral feeding with a different impact of specific nutrients, and is also influenced by a number of humoral mediators such as enteroglucagon, gastrin, growth factors, prostaglandins and polyamines. Nutritional management starts parenterally via a central venous line covering basic demands, substituting current losses and restoring pre-existing deficiencies. Continuous enteral tube feeding is added as soon as postoperative ileus resolves, beginning with an elemental diet, which is gradually increased first in concentration, then in quantity, and supplemented by small oral meals. Cycling of parenteral nutrition is the next step. As soon as sufficient stability is reached, the child should be discharged home under continued outpatient care. Main long-term problems comprise bacterial overgrowth, fluid and electrolyte disequilibration, nutritional deficiencies, parenteral nutrition-related liver disease, and central venous line complications such as sepsis and thrombosis.},

   abstract = {OBJECTIVE: Enteral feeding is now an established primary therapy for active Crohn's disease. This first-double blind randomized trial was designed to compare the therapeutic efficacy of a polymeric diet (PD) with an elemental diet (ED). METHODS: Patients with active Crohn's disease (Crohn's disease activity index [CDAI] > 150, increased bowel uptake of Tc-HMPAO-labeled leukocytes, and abnormal C-reactive protein [CRP]), were randomized to receive either an ED or a PD. The two preparations were identical except for the nitrogen source, which was amino acid based in ED and intact protein in PD. Enteral feeding was considered successful if clinical remission was achieved as defined by a final CDAI of < or = 150, a reduction in the CDAI by at least 100 points from baseline level, and a normal CRP. RESULTS: Twenty-one patients were enrolled of whom 11 were randomized to PD and 10 to ED. The two groups were comparable at entry. Clinical remission was obtained in eight (80%) patients receiving ED and six (55%) patients receiving PD, p = 0.1. The treatment failed in three and two patients in the PD and ED groups, respectively. Another two patients were intolerant to the feed (PD). Reduction in the CDAI after treatment with ED (359 +/- 67 to 112 +/- 19) was similar to that seen with PD (303 +/- 27 to 97 +/- 11). Similar changes in the CRP were also observed (16 +/- 5 to 4 +/- 1.6) and (62 +/- 20 to 9 +/- 6), respectively. Overall, enteral feeding was successful in 14 patients (63%). CONCLUSIONS: Enteral nutrition is effective in treatment of active Crohn's disease. Differences in nitrogen sources of enteral feeds are not relevant to their therapeutic efficacy, as polymeric and elemental diets are equally effective.},

   abstract = {BACKGROUND: Enteral feeding with either elemental or polymeric diets is an established primary therapy for active Crohn's disease. However, the role of supplementing normal food with elemental diet in the long-term management of Crohn's disease has hitherto not been explored. PATIENTS AND METHODS: A series of 39 consecutive patients with Crohn's disease in clinical remission were studied. Of these, 21 patients (Group 1) received oral nutritional supplementation, taken in addition to their normal diet. Their outcome (relapse rate, Crohn's disease activity index, inflammatory markers) was compared with that of 18 patients (Group 2), who were maintained on a normal unrestricted diet over an observation period of 12 months. RESULTS: A total of 17 patients (81%) tolerated the nutritional supplementation. On an intention-to-treat basis, 10 patients (48%) remained in remission for 12 months, compared to 4/18 (22%) patients in Group 2, p<0.0003. Their Crohn's disease activity index and CRP remained stable while their weight and body mass index improved during the period of nutrition therapy Seven patients in Group 1 and 14 in Group 2 relapsed at a mean of 7.4+/-0.9 and 6.2+/-0.4 months, respectively. The response to nutrition supplement was independent of age, sex, disease duration or location. Four patients (19%) were intolerant to enteral feeding. CONCLUSIONS: Nutritional supplementation is safe, well tolerated and effective in the long-term management of patients with quiescent Crohn's disease.},

   abstract = {Although up to 20% of patients with Crohn's disease have their first flare during childhood or adolescence, there are no or only a few randomized, controlled studies. However, big differences and uncertainty may be observed between the diagnosis and therapy of pediatricians and gastroenterologists specialized for adults. In addition, special problems result from the enormous somatic and psychological evolution during adolescence. The diagnosis is done as in adult patients by enteroclysm and ileocolonoscopy (including multiple biopsies) whereas a deep sedoanalgesia or anesthesia should be performed routinely. Corticosteroids are the gold standard for therapy of Crohn's disease in the adolescence (especially in cases with high inflammatory activity), but also enteral nutrition over 4-12 weeks--or a combination of both. A recent randomized controlled study demonstrates the positive effect of 6-mercaptopurine in newly diagnosed patients with Crohn's disease in the adolescence. 5-aminosalicylates or the probably more effective azathioprine/6-mercaptopurine could be used for prevention of recurrence in Crohn's disease. The therapy of ulcerative colitis is performed as in adults including the very effective local rectal applications. An accompanying psychosomatic therapy is recommended especially in young patients with disturbed separation from the parents and inadequate coping. The indication for surgery is similar to adults. However, a specific indication for earlier surgery is given, if severe malabsorption and delay of growth takes place in spite of adequate therapy, because this delay of growth could be only caught up before puberty. A conservative therapeutic regimen is recommended in young patients with perianal Crohn's disease.},

   abstract = {Till about 3 decades ago, inflammatory bowel disease (IBD) was considered as non-existent in our country. However, since that time several reports of IBD, mainly ulcerative colitis have been published. More recently, Crohn's disease is also being reported from the country. This trend of UC appearing first in a population followed by CD also appears to be true in other developing nations. A substantial increase in the rates of CD over UC in the last few decades is reported from developed nations as well. Of the other epidemiological factors, an increased risk of CD and lower risk of UC in smokers is established in adults. However, it appears that smoking increases the risk of IBD in children. The etiology of IBD remains elusive. Within the triad of genetics, immunity and antigen responsible for the development of IBD, maximum advances have been made in the field of immune aberrations and this is being exploited to treat the disease. It is well established that IBD results from a disordered immune system in the gut, in response to an unidentified antigen in a predisposed individual. The immune response is enhanced and revolves around antigen-presenting cells, CD 4 T-lymphocytes and tumor necrosis factor alpha. CD results from an enhanced Th1 activity. The pathogenesis of UC is less clear but appears to be humoral. Advances in diagnostics include the availability of serology, ultrasound and nuclear scans, none of which have been tried in our setting where infectious diseases and tuberculosis is rampant. Growth failure and the importance of nutrition in IBD, especially CD, cannot be underemphasized. In many situations nutritional interventions have been used solely as a form of therapy for CD. Newer steroid molecules with minimal systemic effects are also being considered. Other treatment options highlighted are the use of immunosuppressive agents, biologic agents and role of surgery.},

   abstract = {BACKGROUND: Patients with Crohn's disease and ulcerative colitis have an increased risk of thromboembolic events. METHODS: Data were collected from 24 patients aged 4.5 to 23 years who had inflammatory bowel disease. Platelet count, antithrombin, fibrinogen, prothrombin fragment F1+2, soluble thrombomodulin, tissue plasminogen activator, D-dimer, and plasminogen activator inhibitor-1 antigen were investigated. In addition the response to activated protein C, the factor V R506Q mutation, protein C, free protein S antigen, and lipoprotein (a) were analyzed. These data were compared with medical treatment, duration, and disease activity, estimated with the Pediatric Crohn's Disease Activity Index or the Clinical Colitis Activity Index. RESULTS: Forty-five percent of our patients showed an increase in fibrinogen, 29% in prothrombin fragment F1+2, and 20% in platelet count, plasminogen activator inhibitor- antigen, and soluble thrombomodulin. Thrombomodulin was higher in active disease than in inactive disease and in Crohn's disease than in ulcerative colitis. Fibrinogen was also higher with Crohn's disease and tended to be higher in active disease than in ulcerative colitis and inactive disease. Plasminogen activator inhibitor-1 antigen was significantly higher in patients with Crohn's disease than in those with ulcerative colitis and was higher in the patient group treated with steroids. CONCLUSION: As has been shown in adults, young patients with active and inactive inflammatory bowel disease were found to have abnormal coagulation and fibrinolysis. The relevance as a thromboembolic risk factor is discussed.},

In fact several studies quoted by Cox (1995) found that the Majority of IBD patients, even the one's who considered themselves "well," experienced some impairment in quality of life. Early detection of IBD is essential in developing patient confidence and providing motivation for cooperation in treatment. Irvine (1997) conducted a study dealing with the quality of life issues with IBD and concluded that despite impairments, most patients with IBD overcame the obstacles imposed by their illness and managed to remain productive members of society. Similar management (with anti-inflammatory drugs) makes differentiating between Crohn's disease and ulcerative colitis during the early stages of the disease, unnecessary. Situations that require differentiation include: right sided pain or tenderness, steatorrhea, nutritional deficiencies, or a palpable mass (Macrae & Bhathal, 1997). Although IBD continues to be of unknown etiology, recent advances and further study in the areas of the immune system, genetics and environmental influences may provide helpful treatment options in the future. For now, the clinician/patient goal must be to maintain adequate nutrition, promote healing, treat complications, and maintain an optimal lifestyle.},

   abstract = {PURPOSE: The aim of this study was to review the long-term outcome of strictureplasty for small-bowel Crohn's disease. METHODS: We reviewed 111 patients who underwent 285 primary strictureplasties (Heineke-Mikulicz, 236; Finney, 49) between 1980 and 1997. RESULTS: Eighty-seven patients (78 percent) had had previous bowel resections. Forty-six patients (41 percent) required synchronous resection for perforating disease (abscess or fistula) or long strictures (>20 cm). The mean number of strictureplasties was three (range, 1-11). There were no operative deaths. Septic complications (fistula or intra-abdominal abscess) related to strictureplasty developed in eight patients (7 percent), of whom two required a proximal ileostomy. Abdominal symptoms were relieved in 95 percent of patients. The majority (95 percent) of patients with preoperative weight loss gained weight (median gain, +2 kg; range, -6 to +22.3 kg). After a median follow-up of 107 months, symptomatic recurrence occurred in 60 patients (54 percent). In 11 patients symptomatic recurrence was successfully managed by medical treatment. Forty-nine patients (44 percent) required reoperation for recurrence: strictureplasty alone in 22 patients, resection alone in 19 patients, strictureplasty and resection in 6 patients, and ileostomy alone in 2 patients. Eighteen patients (16 percent) required a third operation. One patient died from a small-bowel carcinoma which developed in the vicinity of a previous strictureplasty. Two of 19 patients with diffuse jejunoileal disease developed short-bowel syndrome, and were receiving longterm parenteral nutrition. Two other patients were taking corticosteroids for recurrent symptoms. All other patients were asymptomatic, receiving neither medical treatment nor nutritional support. CONCLUSIONS: Strictureplasty is a safe and efficacious procedure for small-bowel Crohn's disease in the long-term.},

Thirty-eight patients (44%) required further surgery for recurrence. Only young age (< or = 37 years) was associated with high incidence of reoperation for recurrence. Preoperative steroid use, nutritional status, synchronous bowel resection, and number, site, or length of strictureplasties did not affect the incidence of septic complications and recurrence requiring reoperation.

   abstract = {BACKGROUND: There have been several reports on strictureplasty for Crohn's disease. However, in most of them the majority of the patients underwent synchronous bowel resections. The efficacy of strictureplasty has been often attributed to the synchronous bowel resection. This study was undertaken to assess the long-term results of strictureplasty alone for jejunoileal Crohn's disease. METHODS: Forty-three patients who underwent 135 primary strictureplasties without synchronous resection for jejunoileal Crohn's disease between 1980 and 1997 were reviewed. Factors affecting reoperation rates were examined by using a multivariate analysis. RESULTS: There were no operative deaths. Intra-abdominal septic complications (abscess/fistula) developed in 4 patients (9%). Abdominal symptoms were relieved in all but two patients, who required further surgery within 6 months after operation. After a median follow-up of 9 years 21 patients (49%) required reoperation for small-bowel recurrence. A multivariate analysis using Cox's proportional hazard model showed that only age at operation (<35 years, hazard ratio 11.1 versus >35 years, P = 0.002) was an independent significant factor affecting the reoperation rate. Sex, duration of symptoms, smoking, previous small-bowel resection, steroids use, preoperative nutritional status, and site, number, or length of strictureplasties did not affect the reoperation rates. At present all the patients are asymptomatic and receiving neither medical treatment nor nutritional support. CONCLUSIONS: Strictureplasty is a safe and efficacious procedure for jejunoileal Crohn's disease in the long term. Only youth was an independent significant risk factor for recurrence requiring surgery.},
