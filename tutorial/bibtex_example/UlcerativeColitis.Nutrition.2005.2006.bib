   abstract = {Ulcerative colitis and Crohn disease may present before the age of 20 years in 25% to 30% of all patients with inflammatory bowel disease. Reported incidence figures vary considerably depending on the collection of data. Multicenter, multinational collaboration is needed when studying pediatric inflammatory bowel disease. The essential first step is uniformity in the work-up and criteria used for diagnosis. The Porto diagnostic criteria presented here provide the tool that is needed. These criteria are the result of consensus reached by the ESPGHAN inflammatory bowel disease working group. Diagnosis of Crohn disease, ulcerative colitis and indeterminate colitis is based on clinical signs and symptoms, endoscopy and histology and radiology. Every child suspected of inflammatory bowel disease should undergo a complete diagnostic program consisting of colonoscopy with ileal intubation, upper gastrointestinal endoscopy and (in all cases except in definite ulcerative colitis) radiologic contrast imaging of the small bowel. Multiple biopsies from all segments of the gastrointestinal tract are needed for a complete histologic evaluation. A diagnosis of indeterminate colitis cannot be made unless a full diagnostic program has been performed.},

   abstract = {Few of the studied genes demonstrate association with inflammatory bowel disease (IBD). Three mutations in the nucleotide-binding oligomerization domain 2 gene have consistently shown to be independent risk factors for Crohn's disease, but none of the alleles exhibited high sensitivity or specificity for IBD. Linkage analysis implicated several loci on various chromosomes, and epistasis has been demonstrated. The etiopathogenesis of IBD remains unknown, and environmental contribution to their pathogenesis is evident from genetic studies that demonstrated incomplete monozygotic twins concordandance rate for both Crohn's and ulcerative colitis. Smoking has shown an opposite effect on disease phenotype, with an adverse effect on disease course for Crohn's disease, but a slight beneficial effect in ulcerative colitis. The contribution of infectious agents to susceptibility to IBD appears to be strong. However, the role of nutrition on the etiology and therapy of IBD is not clear. Inconsistencies in environmental risk factors could be due to gene-environment interactions, making it essential to study the role of genetics and environmental contribution to the etiopathology of IBD. Transgenic or knockout mice, such as interleukin-10(-/-), T-cell receptor alpha(-/-), Galphai(2) (-/-) and N-cadherin(-/-), develop colitis-like inflammation similar to humans. Therefore, animal models must be further studied to explore mechanistic interactions.},

   abstract = {OBJECTIVE: Selenoprotein-P is a selenium-rich serum protein that carries more than 50% of serum selenium. We evaluated changes in serum selenoprotein-P levels in patients with inflammatory bowel disease. METHODS: Serum selenoprotein-P levels were measured by enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay. Twenty healthy individuals (controls), 34 patients with ulcerative colitis, and 37 patients with Crohn's disease (CD) were studied. RESULTS: A highly significant correlation was found between the serum selenium and selenoprotein-P levels. There was no significant difference in serum selenoprotein-P levels between healthy controls (average 3.4+/-0.8 microg/mL, n=20) and patients with ulcerative colitis (3.0+/-1.0 microg/mL, n=34). Serum selenoprotein-P levels were significantly lower in patients with CD (average 1.8+/-0.5 microg/mL, n=37). Serum selenoprotein-P levels were significantly lower in the elemental diet group of patients who had CD (average 1.4+/-0.4 microg/mL, n=17) than in the non-elemental diet group of patients who had CD (average 2.1+/-0.3 microg/mL, n=20). CONCLUSION: We found that the serum selenoprotein-P level is decreased in patients with CD. It may be a useful marker to monitor the systemic selenium status in various disorders.},

   abstract = {BACKGROUND AND AIMS: Resistance to activated protein C (APCR) caused by the Leiden mutation to factor V is the most common cause of inherited thrombosis. Patients with inflammatory bowel disease (IBD) are considered to have an increased risk of thromboembolic complications, and the role of APCR as a cause has previously been investigated. In this study, we investigated if APCR was associated with non-thrombotic morbidities in IBD. PATIENTS/METHODS: Of 951 patients asked to participate, 389 agreed by returning a signed informed consent and filled questionnaire and took the blood test for APCR. Self-reported IBD-related surgery was used as a rough indicator for increased morbidity. RESULTS: APCR was present in 6.6% of patients with Crohn's disease (CD; 10/152) and in 12.7% of ulcerative colitis (UC) patients (30/237). The difference of 6.1% is significant (p=0.039). Among patients with CD and APCR, 9 out of 10 had had surgery, significantly more than among those without APCR (81/142). In patients with UC and APCR, 10 out of 30 had had surgery, still significantly more than in those without APCR (36/207). For the whole group of IBD patients, APCR is associated with a significantly increased risk for thrombosis (p=0.0018), and for the UC group (8/28) p=0.0029, but not for the CD patients alone (2/9), p=0.2323. No other significant differences could be shown for parameters normally related to increased morbidity. CONCLUSIONS: APCR in IBD was associated with an increased frequency of IBD-related surgery, which may warrant screening for APCR in therapy-resistant IBD. In patients with APCR, it may be more difficult and/or important to control inflammation.},

METHODS: A 12-year prospective population-based study was conducted by gastroenterologists and pediatric gastroenterologists of northern France (1,312,141 children <17 years of age). RESULTS: From 1988 to 1999, 509 cases of childhood inflammatory bowel disease were recorded (7.2% of all inflammatory bowel disease cases in Northern France): 367 Crohn disease, 122 ulcerative colitis and 20 indeterminate colitis. The mean standardized incidence was 3.1/10(5) for inflammatory bowel disease as a whole (2.3 for Crohn disease, 0.8 for ulcerative colitis and 0.12 for indeterminate colitis). Crohn disease location at diagnosis was: small bowel and colon (71%), colon only (10%) and small bowel only (19%). Location of initial ulcerative colitis was: proctitis (11%), left colitis (57%) and pancolitis (32%). Although ulcerative colitis incidence remained stable (0.8), Crohn disease incidence increased from 2.1 in 1988 to 1990 to 2.6 in 1997 to 1999 (P = 0.2). CONCLUSIONS: The incidence of Crohn disease in the children of northern France showed an increasing trend (20%; not significant) during the 12-year period while the incidence of ulcerative colitis remained stable. In the entire population(children and adults)the incidence of Crohn disease increased significantly (+23%; P < 0.001), while the incidence of ulcerative colitis decreased (-17%; P < 0.0001).},

We further examined whether these resulted in better selection of the drug dose, improved control of disease, and decreased corticosteroid use in pediatric inflammatory bowel disease (IBD). PATIENTS AND METHODS: This is a retrospective review of 101 pediatric patients with IBD receiving a stable dose of azathioprine (AZA) for 4 months or longer. The study group (n = 64) consisted of patients who received AZA and had metabolite levels measured. The comparison group (n = 37) consisted of patients who were receiving AZA before the availability of metabolite measurement. The TPMT level was measured in study group patients before starting AZA. RESULTS: Patients with normal TPMT level received a higher starting dose of AZA than in patients who were heterozygous for TPMT deficiency (1.7 vs 0.9 mg/[kg x d], P < 0.0001). Study group patients received a higher starting dose (1.6 vs 1.2 mg/[kg x d], P = 0.001) and a higher final dose of AZA (2.4 vs 1.7 mg/[kg x d], P < 0.0001) compared with patients in the comparison group. These patients also had more dose adjustments (0.8 vs 0.4 mg/kg, P < 0.002). The number of disease exacerbations per patient per year was 55% less in the study group (95% CI, 17%-76%, P < 0.0001). The study group patients received less prednisone (P < 0.0001) and had lower disease activity scores (P < 0.05). There was no difference between groups in infliximab use or surgery rate. CONCLUSIONS: Azathioprine dose adjustment using a 6-mercaptopurine metabolite assay was associated with use of higher doses, improved control of disease and decreased corticosteroid use in pediatric patients with IBD.},

   abstract = {It is estimated that of the >1 million individuals in the United States with inflammatory bowel disease (IBD), approximately 100,000 are children. IBD that begins in childhood affects the individual at a critical period of growth and development. Children with Crohn's disease and ulcerative colitis may experience complications such as growth failure, school absence, and depression. In addition, because children with IBD have fewer environmental confounders such as smoking, children may be an excellent population to study microbial and immune interactions. Despite these opportunities, the discipline of pediatric IBD investigation is still in its infancy. In September of 2005, a group of investigators with expertise in pediatric IBD met in Boston (Massachusetts) to review the current status of childhood IBD research and to develop research priorities that warranted funding from the Crohn's and Colitis Foundation of America. The group included pediatricians, internists, basic scientists, clinical investigators, and members of the administrative staff and board of the Crohn's and Colitis Foundation of America. The research needs in respective areas were outlined by the heads of 10 focus groups, each with expertise in their respective fields (genetics, psychosocial issues, epidemiology, microbiology, immunology, quality improvement, pharmacogenomics, nutrition, growth and skeletal health, and clinical trials). Before the conference, heads of the research focus groups developed their proposals with experts in the field. At the end of the conference, members of the focus groups and members of the steering committee rated the proposed areas of study in terms of feasibility and importance. It was recommended that the Crohn's and Colitis Foundation of America focus its initial efforts in pediatric IBD in 5 areas: the effects of inflammation on growth and skeletal development, the genetics of early-onset IBD, the development of quality improvement interventions to standardize and improve clinical care of children with IBD, the immunology of childhood IBD, and the diagnosis and treatment of psychosocial sequelae of childhood IBD. At the conclusion of the meeting, investigators discussed the formation of a multicenter collaborative network to advance clinical and basic research in the field.},

The aim of this prospective study was to analyze the effects of an education program in patients with inflammatory bowel disease. METHODS: 145 patients with inflammatory bowel disease were prospectively included: 73 were educated in four sessions, 72 were educated after the one year evaluation period (control group). The following topics were presented: pathogenesis, diagnostic procedures, course of disease, medical and surgical treatment, nutrition, social problems and support, stress management, and coping with the disease. RESULTS: The repeated measurement two-way analysis of variances showed no effects of the patient education program on disease-related knowledge, depression and quality of life. CONCLUSION: This patient education program was not able to increase disease-related knowledge or psychosocial variables in patients with IBD. However, most of the patients were very satisfied with the education program, since as judged by their own assessment it helped them to act responsibly for themselves and their disease.},

   abstract = {OBJECTIVES: Indeterminate intestinal inflammation may result from a variety of inflammatory conditions in addition to ulcerative colitis and Crohn disease. The primary systemic vasculitides may present with intestinal inflammation and an indeterminate colitis. We set out to describe a series of children with primary systemic vasculitis who initially presented with clinical features suggestive of inflammatory bowel disease (IBD) to establish criteria that might help discriminate between IBD and primary systemic vasculitis. METHODS: Ten children (6 boys, median age at presentation 8.9 years, range 0.9-14.5 years) satisfied inclusion criteria. RESULTS: All had abdominal pain, weight loss, diarrhea (6 of 10 bloody) and laboratory evidence of a severe acute phase response. Extraintestinal clinical features included vasculitic rash, renal impairment, myalgia, testicular pain and polyarthritis. Endoscopy showed vascular changes or other macroscopic findings suggestive of vasculitis in 5 of 10 patients. Gut histology revealed indeterminate chronic inflammatory mucosal changes and one patient with small artery fibrinoid necrosis in the submucosal vessels. Extraintestinal biopsy was performed in 6 patients and had a higher yield for the demonstration of vasculitis than intestinal biopsy. The results of selective visceral angiography was suggestive of vasculitis in all patients, but was normal in 7 cases of treatment-unresponsive classic IBD. Treatment comprised corticosteroid and azathioprine in all patients. Cyclophosphamide was given to 7 of 10 patients. CONCLUSIONS: Extraintestinal manifestations and inflammatory responses that may be disproportionate to the degree of intestinal inflammation provide clues to the presence of an underlying primary systemic vasculitis, and these data suggest that selective visceral angiography plays a key role in the diagnosis of vasculitis in this context. It is important to identify and treat any vasculitic component because failure to do so may result in consequential morbidity or mortality.},

METHODS: All children referred for initial assessment of possible IBD were eligible. Patients with symptoms or signs (right-lower quadrant mass, perianal disease, or hematochezia) mandating a complete work-up for IBD were excluded. All enrolled patients underwent a clinical, laboratory, radiographic, and endoscopic evaluation including biopsy examinations. The immunoglobulin (Ig)G and IgA ASCA, IgG pANCA, FC, IP, and BWUS were tested in all patients at the initial assessment. RESULTS: A final diagnosis of IBD was made in 27 patients: 17 Crohn disease and 10 ulcerative colitis. Eighteen children had other gastrointestinal diagnoses (8 functional bowel disorders, 5 food allergy-mediated diseases, 4 infectious enterocolitis, 1 familial Mediterranean fever). In patients with simultaneous abnormal values of FC, BWUS, and ASCA/pANCA, the estimated probability of having IBD was 99.47%. Patients with negative results on all tests had a 0.69% of probability of IBD. CONCLUSIONS: The incorporation of noninvasive diagnostic tests into the initial diagnostic approach may avoid unnecessary invasive procedures and facilitate clinical decision-making when the diagnosis of IBD in children is initially uncertain.},

   abstract = {BACKGROUND: Indeterminate colitis (IC) is a subgroup of inflammatory bowel disease (IBD) that cannot be characterized as either ulcerative colitis (UC) or Crohn's disease (CD). Our aims are to determine the prevalence of IC in our pediatric patient population and to describe its clinical presentation, natural history,and disease distribution. METHODS: We performed a retrospective database analysis of all children diagnosed with IBD at the Johns Hopkins Children's IBD Center between 1996 and 2001. Patient demographics, including age, sex, and age at disease onset, were tallied. Disease distribution was identified on the basis of a review of all endoscopic, colonoscopic, histopathological, and radiological records. All of the patients were followed up clinically to determine the extent of disease progression on the basis of the initial diagnosis of IC. RESULTS: Among 250 children registered in the database, 127 (50.8%) had a diagnosis of CD, 49 (19.6%) had UC, and 74(29.6%) had IC. Patients with IC had a significantly younger mean +/- SEM age (9.53 +/- 4.8 years) at diagnosis compared with patients with CD (12.4 +/- 3.8 years; P < 0.001) but not compared with patients with UC (7.41 +/- 3.5 years). Among the patients with IC, 59 (79.7%) had a pancolitis at diagnosis, and the remaining 15 had left-sided disease that progressed to a pancolitis within a mean of 6 years. Twenty-five patients (33.7%) with an initial diagnosis of IC were reclassified to either CD or UC after a median follow-up of 1.9 years (range 0.6-4.5 years). Forty-nine patients (66.2%) maintained their diagnosis of IC after a mean follow-up of 7 years (SEM 2.5 years). CONCLUSIONS: IC is a distinct pediatric subgroup of IBD with a prevalence that is higher than that observed in adults. Children with IC have an early age of disease onset and a disease that rapidly progresses to pancolitis. Longitudinal studies are needed to determine the clinical implications of this pediatric IBD subgroup.},

   abstract = {AIM: To determine whether prior appendectomy modifies the phenotype and severity of Crohn's disease. METHODS: Appendectomy status and smoking habits were specified by direct interview in 2838 patients consecutively seen between 1995 and 2004. Occurrence of complications and therapeutic needs were reviewed retrospectively. Additionally, annual disease activity was assessed prospectively between 1995 and 2004 in patients who had not had ileocecal resection and of a matched control group. RESULTS: Compared to 1770 non-appendectomized patients, appendectomized patients more than 5 years before Crohn's disease diagnosis (n=716) were more often females, smokers, with ileal disease. Cox regression showed that prior appendectomy was positively related to the risk of intestinal stricture (adjusted hazard ratio, 1.24; 95% confidence interval, 1.13 to 1.36; P=0.02) and inversely related to the risk of perianal fistulization (adjusted hazard ratio, 0.75; 95% confidence interval, 0.68 to 0.83; P=0.002). No difference was observed between the two groups regarding the therapeutic needs, except for an increased risk of surgery in appendectomized patients, attributable to the increased prevalence of ileal disease. Between 1995 and 2004, Crohn's disease was active during 50% of years in appendectomized patients (1318 out of 2637 patient-years) and 51% in non-appendectomized patients (1454 out of 2841 patient-years; NS). CONCLUSION: Prior appendectomy is associated with a more proximal disease and has an increased risk of stricture and a lesser risk of anal fistulization. However, the severity of the disease is unaffected.},

   abstract = {OBJECTIVES: Inflammatory bowel diseases (IBD) represent an aberrant immune response by the mucosal immune system to luminal bacteria. Because the oral mucosa harbors the first epithelial cells that interact with microorganisms, we assessed the immunologic activity of buccal epithelium in children with IBD and adults with Crohn disease. METHODS: Buccal epithelial cells were obtained from 17 children and 14 adults with Crohn disease, 18 children with ulcerative colitis, and 40 controls. Cells were cultured with and without microbial stimulation. Chemokine levels were determined in culture supernatants by cytometric bead array and enzyme-linked immunoabsorbent assay. CXCL-8 production was studied by immunohistochemical analysis of these cells. CXCL-8 production by lipopolysaccharide stimulated monocyte-derived dendritic cells from these patients was determined. RESULTS: Compared with controls, pediatric ulcerative colitis patients, and adult Crohn disease patients, only in children with Crohn disease did buccal epithelial cells exhibit enhanced production of CXCL-8, CXCL-9, and CXCL-10. In vitro stimulation with lipopolysaccharide or zymosan resulted in a further increase of chemokine levels only in cells from pediatric Crohn disease patients. CXCL-8 production by stimulated monocyte-derived dendritic cells from children with Crohn disease was equal to that of children with ulcerative colitis. CONCLUSIONS: Buccal epithelium of children with Crohn disease is immunologically active, even in the absence of oral lesions. The enhanced chemokine production is associated with pediatric Crohn disease and appears restricted to cells derived from the epithelial barrier. Assessment of chemokine production by buccal epithelial cells may become a new, rapid, noninvasive test for screening and classification of IBD in children.},

   abstract = {OBJECTIVES: The Aim of this retrospective study was to evaluate early experience with laparoscopic restorative proctocolectomy by analyzing the perioperative results of surgical treatment. PATIENTS AND METHODS: Seven major surgeries were performed in six patients with familial adenomatous polyposis and ulcerative colitis. All procedures were performed under laparoscopy at our third-level hospital from June 2003 to October 2004. RESULTS: Mean surgical time was 287.5 +/- 80.7 min, and median blood loss was 300 +/- 249.0 cc. There were no conversions; return of peristalsis began at 32 +/- 12.4 h; average time to first oral intake was 64.0 +/- 32.8 h, and mean duration of hospital stay was 9.3 +/- 1.2 days. There was one case of perineal sepsis due to ileal pouch-anal anastomotic leakage, which was successfully treated with oral intake restriction, parenteral nutrition, and intra-rectal drainage. The most common postoperative complication was postoperative ileus. CONCLUSIONS: We believe that the laparoscopic approach to restorative proctocolectomy may be considerably improved in our center. Particular aspects for improvement include efforts to achieve lower operating and hospitalization times to equate our results with those reported by multicenter studies for laparoscopic colon cancer surgery. In our opinion, learning and further training opportunities should be encouraged to improve surgeon experience in the field of laparoscopy, preferably at centers specializing in restorative proctocolectomy.},

Regulation of colon inflammation by this receptor has been well demonstrated in many experimental models of colitis but also in patients with ulcerative colitis, characterised by impaired expression of PPARgamma confined to their colon epithelial cells. Recent data showing that PPARgamma was the major functional receptor mediating the common aminosalicylate activities in inflammatory bowel diseases (IBD) have also reinforced the roles of this receptor in the control of intestinal inflammation. The aims of this review are to discuss the potential roles of PPARgamma in the physiopathology of IBD, as well as the emerging therapeutic strategies targeting this receptor.},

   abstract = {The inflammatory bowel diseases Crohn's disease and ulcerative colitis are common, chronic disorders that cause abdominal pain, diarrhea, and gastrointestinal bleeding. To identify genetic factors that might contribute to these disorders, we performed a genome-wide association study. We found a highly significant association between Crohn's disease and the IL23R gene on chromosome 1p31, which encodes a subunit of the receptor for the proinflammatory cytokine interleukin-23. An uncommon coding variant (rs11209026, c.1142G>A, p.Arg381Gln) confers strong protection against Crohn's disease, and additional noncoding IL23R variants are independently associated. Replication studies confirmed IL23R associations in independent cohorts of patients with Crohn's disease or ulcerative colitis. These results and previous studies on the proinflammatory role of IL-23 prioritize this signaling pathway as a therapeutic target in inflammatory bowel disease.},

This study evaluates short- and long-term efficacy of infliximab in children with ulcerative colitis. METHODS: All pediatric patients with ulcerative colitis who received infliximab between July 2001 and November 2003 at the Johns Hopkins Children's Center were identified. Short- and long-term outcomes and adverse reactions were evaluated. RESULTS: Twelve pediatric patients with ulcerative colitis received infliximab for treatment of fulminant colitis (3 patients), acute exacerbation of colitis (3), steroid-dependent colitis (5), and steroid-refractory colitis (1). Nine patients had a complete short-term response, and 3 had partial improvement. The mean per patient dose of corticosteroid after the first infliximab infusion decreased from 45 mg/day at the first infusion to 22.2 mg/day at 4 weeks (P = 0.02) and 7.8 mg/day at 8 weeks (P = 0.008). Eight patients were classified as long-term responders with a median follow-up time of 10.4 months. Of the 4 long-term nonresponders, 3 underwent colectomy, and the fourth has ongoing chronic symptoms. Three of 4 long-term nonresponders were steroid-refractory compared with 1 of 8 long-term responders. Patients receiving 6-mercaptopurine had a better response to infliximab. CONCLUSION: Infliximab should be considered in the treatment of children with symptoms of acute moderate to severe ulcerative colitis.},

   abstract = {During the anabolic response associated with inflammation, mucin synthesis and colonic protection may be compromised by the limited availability of specific amino acids. We therefore determined the effect of dietary amino acid supplementation on the microbiota, mucin status, and mucosal damage in dextran sulfate sodium (DSS)-treated rats. From 8 d before to 28 d after colitis induction, male Sprague-Dawley rats (10 mo old, n = 8/group) were fed a control diet supplemented or not with 2 different doses of an amino acid cocktail containing L-threonine, L-serine, L-proline, and L-cysteine. All diets were isonitrogenous (adjusted with L-alanine). The higher dose of amino acids increased the number of Muc2-containing goblet cells in the surface epithelium of the ulcerated area, stimulated mucin production in the colon, and restored the mucin amino acid composition and mucosal content to healthy, control values. The colonic mucin synthesis rate was specifically stimulated by 95%, whereas the protein turnover was unchanged. All bacterial populations, markedly altered by the DSS treatment, were promoted. In conclusion, in inflammatory situations, an increase in threonine, serine, proline, and cysteine dietary supply can promote mucin synthesis, reequilibrate the gut microbiota, and thus favor colonic protection and mucosal healing.},

   abstract = {The chronic idiopathic inflammatory bowel diseases (IBDs), namely Crohn's disease and ulcerative colitis, appear to be derived from an inappropriate reaction towards a luminal agent, most probably driven by the intestinal microflora, which upregulates the synthesis and release of different pro-inflammatory mediators, thus contributing to tissue damage that characterizes these intestinal conditions. Several studies have reported that IBD is associated with impairment in short-chain fatty acid (SCFA) production, mainly acetate, propionate, and butyrate. They are produced in the large bowel by anaerobic bacterial fermentation of undigested dietary carbohydrates and fiber polysaccharides, with butyrate being considered as the major fuel source for colonocytes. These SCFAs have been proposed to play a key role in the maintenance of colonic homeostasis. Therefore, it is reasonable to consider therapeutic approaches that increase colonic SCFA production, as it can be achieved by administration of dietary fiber to IBD patients. Unfortunately, there is quite limited documentation of efficacy of dietary fiber in properly designed trials. This review discusses the rationale, available evidence for the use of dietary fiber and its mechanisms of action in the treatment and prevention of IBDs.},

   abstract = {Undigested carbohydrates reaching the colon can act as competitors for epithelial bacterial receptors, making it difficult for noncommensal bacteria to adhere to them. On the contrary, fermentation of these carbohydrates by anaerobic flora produces - among other substrates - butyrate that is involved in numerous important metabolic processes. These include the provision of energy to the colonocytes, the enhancement of sodium and water absorption and the synthesis of mucus and cell membranes. In addition, butyrate inhibits the nuclear translocation of the transcription factor NFkappaB, which exerts a potent anti-inflammatory activity. Clinical experience with probiotics in inflammatory bowel disease (IBD) is controversial. Whereas some probiotic preparations appear to be useful in ulcerative colitis (UC) and pouchitis, most attempts to use probiotics for treating or preventing recurrence in Crohn's disease have failed. It should be pointed out that - unlike in the small bowel - the colon and ileal pouches are well-established microbiological ecosystems with increasing amounts of a wide variety of bacterial strains. These bacterial strains have a high degree of metabolic interaction with luminal nutrients and a greater probability of developing dysbiosis. With this in mind, the rationale for using pre- and probiotics appears to be stronger for colonic IBD (UC or Crohn's colitis) and pouchitis than for IBD mostly involving the small bowel.},

   abstract = {BACKGROUND: Inflammatory bowel disease (IBD) is increasing in frequency in Australia. General practitioners play an important role in early diagnosis and in a multidisciplinary approach to managing such patients. Keeping abreast of evolving concepts, particularly in treatment, is challenging. OBJECTIVE: This article aims to address key issues in diagnosis and management to better equip general practitioners for their role in multidisciplinary management of patients with IBD. DISCUSSION: Making the diagnosis can be difficult, but is facilitated by appropriate clinical suspicion and sensible judgment as to who undergoes diagnostic tests such as colonoscopy. Treatment of ulcerative colitis has changed little in recent years, except for our improved ability to deliver mesalazine to the large bowel via the recent availability of several oral and rectal preparations. Prevention of relapse using these is an important strategy in the majority of patients. Treatment of Crohn disease is changing due to more realistic concepts of the natural history of the disease and the development of new, powerful anti-inflammatory therapies. Attention to issues other than intestinal inflammation such as nutrition, education and counselling, remain important in achieving optimal management.},

AIM: To compare bone biomarkers in inflammatory bowel disease patients (Crohn's disease: n = 68, and ulcerative colitis: n = 32, separately) with age- and sex-matched healthy controls. SUBJECTS: Patients and controls were recruited from Cork University Hospital and Cork City area, respectively. RESULTS: Relative to that in their respective controls, Crohn's disease (n = 47) and ulcerative colitis (n = 26) patients (i.e. excluding supplement users) had significantly (P < 0.05-0.001) higher serum undercarboxylated osteocalcin (by 27% and 63%, respectively) and bone-specific alkaline phosphatase (by 15% and 21%, respectively) and urinary Type I collagen cross-linked N-telopeptides concentrations (by 87% and 112%, respectively). Relative to that in their respective controls, Crohn's disease and ulcerative colitis patients had significantly (P < 0.01) lower serum total osteocalcin (by 20% and 42%, respectively) and 25-hydroxyvitamin D (by 37% and 42%, respectively), while serum parathyroid hormone levels were similar. In the combined patient group (n = 100), undercarboxylated osteocalcin was positively associated with bone markers. CONCLUSIONS: Both Crohn's disease and ulcerative colitis patients have altered bone turnover relative to that in healthy controls.},

METHODS: Twenty-seven patients with ulcerative colitis (UC) and 17 healthy control subjects were studied. The patients were categorised as severe (n = 9), moderate (n = 10) and mild groups (n = 8) using Truelove and Witts' classification of ulcerative colitis. Microheterogeneity of ACT, AGP and Tf was analysed by crossed immunoaffinity electrophoresis (CIAE) with concanavalin A. In all serum samples standard electrophoresis of serum proteins was performed, iron (Fe) concentration, total iron binding capacity (TIBC) and C-reactive protein (CRP) were also measured. RESULTS: Our patients suffering from ulcerative colitis had significantly higher serum ACT and AGP concentrations and lower serum transferrin concentration in comparison to healthy subjects. Changes in concentrations of acute phase proteins were dependent on the activity of the inflammatory process. The glycosylation patterns of transferrin were related to the inflammation status. We also observed the correlation between ACT and AGP concentrations, patterns of transferrin glycosylation and changes in standard protein electrophoresis or blood cell count. CONCLUSION: The glycosylation patterns of transferrin obtained from patients suffering from ulcerative colitis are highly branched and sialylated compared with those obtained from healthy subjects. In contrast, the glycosylation patterns of transferrin do not differ according to the activity index of ulcerative colitis. The microheterogeneity patterns of AGP and ACT are similar in ulcerative colitis patients and healthy subjects.},

Symbiosis between host and flora can be optimised by prebiotics. Inulin-type fructans have been shown to improve the metabolic functions of the commensal flora. Clinical and experimental data suggest that they also improve the gut mucosal barrier. Furthermore, modulation of the trophic functions of the flora by these prebiotics could help in the prevention of inflammatory bowel diseases. The anti-inflammatory effects of inulin or oligofructose have been assessed in the rat model of distal colitis induced by dextran sodium sulphate, which histologically resembles human ulcerative colitis, and in the trinitrobenzene sulphonic acid model that resembles human Crohn's disease. Both inulin and oligofructose stimulate colonic production of SCFA and favour the growth of indigenous lactobacilli and/or bifidobacteria. These effects are associated with reduced mucosal inflammation and decreased mucosal lesion scores. Inulin has also been tested in a placebo-controlled clinical trial in patients with relapsing pouchitis. Treatment reduced endoscopic and histological parameters of inflammation of the pouch mucosa. Inulin and oligofructose may offer an opportunity to prevent chronic inflammatory intestinal disorders, and this potential should be tested in further clinical studies.},

Initial trials demonstrated a dose response that was compromised by dose-related intolerance. Recognition that the 5-aminosalicylic acid moiety (5-ASA, mesalazine) is the active ingredient of sulfasalazine has allowed the development of sulpha-free formulations of mesalazine and alternative azo-bond derivatives (olsalazine, balsalazide) that substantially reduce the dose-related (and allergic) consequences of the sulfapyridine moiety of sulfasalazine. Dose-ranging studies of mesalazine formulations for induction of remission have demonstrated increased efficacy of oral mesalazine up to 4-4.8 g/day, particularly in patients with more moderate disease activity. Combination therapy with oral and rectal mesalazine provide additional efficacy for patients with both distal and extensive colitis. The mesalazine formulations have dose-related benefits without dose-related side effects. In contrast, the azo-bond formulations are compromised by secretory diarrhoea at doses providing greater than 2-2.4 g/day of mesalazine. There are less data regarding dose-related benefits of aminosalicylates to maintain remissions in UC greater than 1.6 g/day of mesalazine, although the absence of dose-related side effects allows continuation of the same inductive dose through maintenance treatment without dose-related toxicity.},

   abstract = {PURPOSE: The purpose of this study was to assess the safety of subtotal colectomy and outcomes after this procedure in the modern era of immunosuppressive agents and primary pelvic pouch surgery. METHODS: All patients undergoing subtotal colectomy with ileostomy for ulcerative colitis or Crohn's colitis from July 1, 1990 to June 30, 2003 were identified from a prospective database. Only patients who were operated on while hospitalized for disease exacerbation were included in the analysis. Age at colectomy, preoperative days in the hospital, postoperative length of stay, and complications were recorded. The medical records were then reviewed for duration of disease, preoperative diagnosis, use of steroids and immunomodulators, parenteral nutrition, endoscopy findings, albumin level, postoperative diagnosis, and ultimate disposition. RESULTS: One hundred one patients underwent subtotal colectomy for inflammatory bowel disease during the study period. Seventy-four patients met all the inclusion criteria. The mean age was 35.9 (range, 18-86) years. Median duration of disease was 36 (0-240) months, but 28 patients had colitis for less than 1 year, whereas 10 patients had disease of greater than 10 years duration at the time of colectomy. Median preoperative hospital stay was 7 (range, 0-43) days and median postoperative length of stay was 6.5 (range, 4-37) days. Sixty-six patients underwent surgery for refractory exacerbation, 5 for free perforation, 2 for abscess, and 1 patient for hemorrhage. Twenty-seven patients (36.5 percent) had a change in diagnosis after surgery. Complications occurred in 17 patients (23 percent), including 8 cases of central venous catheter-associated thrombosis; 7 of these occurred in patients who had been hospitalized for more than a week before surgery. In the ulcerative colitis patients, 31 of 52 ultimately underwent ileal pouch-anal anastomosis, but 20 (39 percent) chose either completion proctectomy or no further surgery. CONCLUSIONS: Subtotal colectomy with ileostomy remains a safe and effective treatment for patients requiring urgent surgery for severe inflammatory bowel disease. Because of the substantial incidence of change in diagnosis and satisfaction in many patients with an ileostomy, subtotal colectomy with ileostomy may be preferable to primary ileal pouch-anal anastomosis, even when a pouch is considered safe.},

   abstract = {OBJECTIVES: Granulocyte apheresis (GCAP), involving the removal of granulocytes from the blood, may improve clinical symptoms and facilitate a reduction in the dose of steroids in adult patients with ulcerative colitis. As a preliminary trial, GCAP was used to taper the dose of steroids in 4 pediatric patients with ulcerative colitis. METHODS: Three males and 1 female ranging from 11 to 17 years old were treated with GCAP once per week for 5 consecutive weeks/course. The ages of patients at clinical onset ranged from 8 to 12 years and the length of time from the clinical onset to GCAP treatment ranged from 28 to 58 months (median, 38.5 months). RESULTS: In 2 patients, symptoms and signs indicating disease activity improved after 2 courses of GCAP. Laboratory data and endoscopic findings also improved after treatment and the clinical efficacy was judged to be excellent in these patients. In 1 patient, GCAP improved laboratory and endoscopic hallmarks, but bloody stools persisted. Finally, the treatment was ineffective in the fourth patient who eventually underwent surgery. CONCLUSIONS: GCAP is effective in improving clinical symptoms and may play an important role in converting steroid therapy to other treatments in children with steroid-refractory or steroid-dependent ulcerative colitis.},

   abstract = {Because intestinal microflora play a pivotal role in the development of inflammatory bowel disease (IBD), there is currently some interest in alternating the composition of the microflora toward a potentially more remedial community. This paper summarizes the clinical and experimental efficacy of the manipulation of microflora by the use of antibiotics, probiotics, and prebiotics in IBD. Germinated barley foodstuff (GBF) is a prebiotic whose unique characteristics make it highly suitable for applications in IBD. It also helps prolong remission in remissive ulcerative colitis (UC) patients and also attenuates clinical activity in non-remissive UC patients. GBF has shown to be converted into a preferential nutrient, butyrate, for colonocytes through the action of Eubacterium and Bifidobacterium, and this bacterial butyrate can provide anti-inflammatory effects. The probiotic approaches for IBD include VSL#3, Nissle1917, Clostridium butyricum, and Bifidobacterium-fermented milk. In this paper, we summarize the distinctive role of another probiotic, Eubacterium limosum (E. limosum), which is a commensal microorganism that is promoted by GBF administration. The metabolites of E. limosum included butyrate, which can accelerate intestinal epithelial growth and inhibit IL-6 production. This new probiotic approach may be useful as an adjunctive IBD treatment in the future. Although these strategies hold great promise and appear to be useful in some settings, more experimental and clinical studies are needed to firmly establish their relevance.},

   abstract = {BACKGROUND: There is an increased prevalence of gastrointestinal symptoms, peptic ulcer disease, and colon cancer in night-shiftworkers, whose sleep is commonly disrupted. Sleep complaints are an extrapyramidal symptom of irritable bowel syndrome (IBS). Sleep disruption may contribute to increased medical morbidity by weakening the ability of the immune system to protect against endotoxins-this pathway could be of potential importance to the pathogenesis and/or clinical course of inflammatory bowel disease (IBD), a chronic immunoinflammatory gastrointestinal disorder associated with marked reductions in quality of life. This is the first study to comprehensively examine sleep concerns in patients with IBD. METHODS: Sixteen patients with biopsy-proven inactive IBD (8 with Crohn disease and 8 with ulcerative colitis), 9 patients with IBS, and 7 healthy controls completed the Pittsburgh Sleep Quality Index, Epworth Sleepiness Scale, Inflammatory Bowel Disease Questionnaire, SF-12, and a single overnight polysomnogram. Polysomnography and arousals were scored according to standard criteria. Multivariate analyses were used to compare subjective and objective sleep parameters between groups and to identify associations between sleep complaints and quality of life. RESULTS: Patients with IBD did not seem to significantly differ from patients with IBS, who have established sleep complaints. On polysomnography, total sleep time differentiated the 3 groups well, with the IBS and IBD groups appearing numerically similar. Whereas IBS and IBD groups were similar with respect to observed sleep parameters, IBS patients did report the most concerns, consistent with earlier research suggesting that hyperarousal and perceptual differences may contribute to symptom reporting. CONCLUSION: Sleep parameters greatly influenced quality of life in both groups and highlight the need to address sleep concerns as part of IBD management.},

Maintenance treatment is indicated in most of IBD patients. 5-ASA derivates are preferred in UC; in case of failure, azathioprine can be used.

ONS and/or TF in addition to normal food is indicated in undernourished patients with CD or CU to improve nutritional status. In active CD EN is the first line therapy in children and should be used as sole therapy in adults mainly when treatment with corticosteroids is not feasible. No significant differences have been shown in the effects of free amino acid, peptide-based and whole protein formulae for TF. In remission ONS is recommended only in steroid dependent patients in CD. In patients with SBS TF should be introduced in the adaptation phase and should be changed with progressing adaptation to ONS in addition to normal food.},

   abstract = {Ulcerative colitis (UC) is an acute and chronic inflammatory bowel disease of unknown aetiology, although bacterial species belonging to the normal colonic microbiota are known to be involved in its initiation and maintenance. Several organisms have been linked to the disease; however, mucosa-associated bacteria are more likely to be involved than their luminal counterparts, due to their close proximity to the host epithelium. Comparative bacteriological analyses were done on rectal biopsies to investigate differences in mucosal bacteria in patients with UC and healthy controls. Complex bacterial communities were found in both groups, with significant reductions in bifidobacterial numbers in UC, which suggested that they might have a protective role in the disease. Accordingly, a therapy for treating UC was designed, with the aim of modifying the mucosal microbiota to increase bifidobacterial colonisation and reduce inflammation. Ranges of mucosal and faecal bifidobacteria were tested for their substrate preferences and their abilities to survive under a variety of environmental conditions. A synbiotic comprising a probiotic (Bifidobacterium longum) isolated from healthy rectal mucosa combined with a prebiotic (oligofructose-enriched inulin - Synergy 1) was developed. The treatment was used in a randomised controlled trial involving eighteen patients with active UC, for a period of 1 month. Rectal biopsies were collected at the beginning and end of the study. Bacteriological analysis and transcription levels of epithelium-related immune markers were assessed. Results demonstrated that short-term synbiotic treatment resulted in increased bifidobacterial colonisation of the rectal mucosa and induced significant reductions in the expression of molecules that control inflammation in active UC.},

OBJECTIVE: We aimed to synthesize published and unpublished evidence to determine estimates of the effect of n-3 fatty acids on clinical outcomes in IBD and whether n-3 fatty acids modify the effects of or need for treatment with other agents. DESIGN: Computerized databases were searched for studies of n-3 fatty acids in immune-mediated diseases from 1966 to 2003. We also contacted experts in the nutraceutical industry to identify unpublished studies; however, none were identified. RESULTS: Reviewers identified 13 controlled trials that assessed the effects of n-3 fatty acids on clinical, sigmoidoscopic, or histologic scores; rates of induced remission or relapse; or requirements for steroids and other immunosuppressive agents in Crohn disease or ulcerative colitis. Most clinical trials were of good quality. Fewer than 6 were identified that assessed the effects of n-3 fatty acids on any single outcome of clinical, endoscopic, or histologic scores or remission or relapse rates. Consistent across 3 studies was the finding that n-3 fatty acids reduce corticosteroid requirements, although statistical significance was shown in only 1 of these studies. CONCLUSION: The available data are insufficient to draw conclusions about the effects of n-3 fatty acids on clinical, endoscopic, or histologic scores or remission or relapse rates.},

   abstract = {BACKGROUND: The relapsing nature and varying geographical prevalence of ulcerative colitis (UC) implicates environmental factors such as diet in its aetiology. METHODS: In order to determine which foods might be related to disease activity in UC a new method of dietary analysis was developed and applied. Eighty-one UC patients were recruited at all stages of the disease process. Following completion of a 7 d diet diary, clinical assessment including a sigmoidoscopic examination (scale 0 (normal mucosa) to 6 (very active disease)) was conducted. Food weights for each person were adjusted (divided) by the person's calorific intake for the week. Each food consumed was given a food sigmoidoscopy score (FSS) calculated by summing the products of the (adjusted) weight of food consumed and sigmoidoscopy score for each patient and occurrence of food and dividing by the total (adjusted) weight of the food consumed by all 81 patients. Thus, foods eaten in large quantities by patients with very active disease have high FSSs and vice versa. Foods consumed by <10 people or weighing <1 kg for the whole group were excluded, leaving 75 foods. RESULTS: High FSS foods were characterized by high levels of the anti-thiamin additive sulfite (Mann-Whitney, p < 0.001), i.e. bitter, white wine, burgers, soft drinks from concentrates, sausages, lager and red wine. Caffeine also has anti-thiamin properties and decaffeinated coffee was associated with a better clinical state than the caffeine containing version. Beneficial foods (average intake per week) included pork (210 g), breakfast cereals (200 g), lettuce (110 g), apples and pears (390 g), milk (1250 ml), melon (350 g), bananas (350 g), bacon (120 g), beef and beef products (500 g), tomatoes (240 g), soup (700 g), citrus fruits (300 g), fish (290 g), yogurt (410 g), cheese (110 g), potatoes (710 g) and legumes (120 g). CONCLUSIONS: The dietary analysis method described provides a new tool for establishing relationships between diet and disease and indicates a potentially therapeutic diet for UC.},

The sensitivity of anti-Saccharomyces cerevisiae antibody (ASCA) IgG and ASCA IgA in CD is 60%-80%, whereas the specificity is almost 90%. There are no reports of study of ASCA in patients with IT, nor has it ever been used to differentiate CD from IT. Patients with ulcerative colitis (UC; n=25), CD (n=59), and IT (n=30) and 21 healthy controls were included in this study. The location and behavior of CD were classified according to the Modified Montreal classification. Five milliliters of blood was taken from them and serum was stored at -70 degrees C. ASCA antibodies (both IgG and IgA) were estimated using commercially available ELISA kits (AESKU Diagnostics, Germany). Anti-neutrophilic cytoplasmic antibody was measured by indirect immunofluorescence test. ASCA IgA was positive in 4.7%, 28%, 33.9%, and 43.3% and ASCA IgG was positive in 4.7%, 24%, 50.8%, and 46.6% of healthy controls and patients with UC, CD, and IT, respectively. Either ASCA IgG or ASCA IgA was positive in 9.5%, 40%, 61% and 66.6% of healthy controls, UC, CD, and IT, respectively. ANCA was positive in 0%, 32%, 10.1%, and 6.6% of healthy controls, UC, CD, and IT, respectively. ASCA IgG was positive in a significantly higher number of patients with CD (P<0.0001) and IT (P<0.0001) in comparison to healthy controls. ASCA IgA was positive in a significantly higher number of patients with UC (P<0.04), CD (P<0.013), and IT (P<0.006) in comparison to healthy controls. In comparisons between diseases, ASCA IgG was positive in significantly more patients with CD (P<0.001) and IT (P<0.001) in comparison to UC. There was no significant difference in ASCA IgA (33.9% vs. 43.3%), ASCA IgG (50.86% vs. 46.6%), or ANCA (10.7%, 7.4%) in patients with CD and IT, respectively. There was no correlation between ASCA and duration, location and behavior of CD, and IT. We conclude that ASCA IgG and ASCA IgA do not help to differentiate between IT and CD.},

AIM: A novel formulation of mesalazine pellets with delayed and prolonged release characteristics was compared with conventional Eudragit L-coated tablets. Furthermore, the effect of mesalazine dose escalation on nonresponders was evaluated in both treatment groups. METHODS: A total of 233 patients with mild to moderately active ulcerative colitis were randomized to receive either mesalazine (1.5 g/day in three doses) as pellets (n = 115) or tablets (n = 118) for 8 weeks. At insufficient response, the dose was increased to 3.0 g. RESULTS: The clinical remission rate (clinical activity index < or = 4) for pellets was 67% vs. 68% for tablets which statistically proved to be not inferior (significance level alpha = 2.5%). In patients without dose increase, the remission rate was 47% (pellets) vs. 42% (tablets). Endoscopic improvement was observed in 80% (pellets) vs. 83% (tablets), and histological improvement in 48% (pellets) vs. 52% (tablets) of patients. CONCLUSIONS: Mesalazine pellets are as effective as tablets in the treatment of mild to moderately active ulcerative colitis. Dose escalation to 3.0 g/day is a valid option for nonresponders to a starting dose of 1.5 g/day.},

   abstract = {BACKGROUND & AIMS: The disruption of homeostasis between proliferation and apoptosis in the colonic epithelium contributes to the pathogenesis of human ulcerative colitis. Mice lacking the transcriptional corepressor myeloid translocation gene related-1 (Mtgr1) display impaired secretory cell lineage development in the small intestine and an increase in proliferation in the crypts of both the small and large intestines. Despite the increase in proliferating cells, the colons of Mtgr1-null mice have a normal cell lineage distribution and normal architecture. To uncover colonic phenotypes in Mtgr1(-/-) mice, we stressed the colonic epithelium with low-molecular-weight dextran sodium sulfate (DSS), which is a well-studied model of murine ulcerative colitis. METHODS: Mtgr1-null mice were given 3% DSS in their drinking water for 4 days and the colons examined at various times thereafter for ulceration and for changes in proliferation and apoptosis. RESULTS: Treatment with DSS resulted in severe colitis in Mtgr1(-/-) mice, at least partially due to increased epithelial apoptosis rates. Transplantation of wild-type and Mtgr1-null bone marrow into irradiated wild-type mice demonstrated that the severe DSS-induced ulceration seen in Mtgr1-null mice was due to a colonic, rather than a hematologic, defect. Importantly, the epithelium of DSS-treated Mtgr1-null mice failed to completely regenerate, showing changes consistent with chronic colitis, even 10 weeks after a single DSS treatment. CONCLUSIONS: These findings suggest that Mtgr1 has an important role in crypt survival and regeneration after colonic epithelial ulceration.},

   abstract = {BACKGROUND: Pouchitis is a frequent complication after ileal pouch-anal anastamosis (IPAA) for ulcerative colitis (UC). The aim of this study was to determine whether genetic polymorphisms in the innate immune receptors toll-like receptor (TLR)4 and caspase activation and recruitment domain family member 15 (CARD15) genes are associated with pouchitis. METHODS: From a retrospectively ascertained cohort of patients with UC 5 to 12 years after IPAA (n = 101), subjects were classified into 3 groups: no pouchitis (n = 52); 1 to 2 episodes per year (n = 11), and more than 2 episodes per year (n = 38). Single nucleotide polymorphisms in the tlr4 gene (D299G, T399I) were determined by a real-time polymerase chain reaction-based fluorogenic probe technique; and card15 polymorphisms (L1007fsinsC, R702W, G908R) were determined by pyrosequencing. RESULTS: Pouchitis affected 49% (49/101) of the study population. No correlation between pouchitis and the presence of TLR4 polymorphisms was found. The percentage of patients who harbored CARD15 mutations was significantly higher in patients with pouchitis than in patients without pouchitis (18% versus 8%; P < 0.05); 24% of pouchitis patients with more than 2 episodes per year harbored CARD15 mutations (P < 0.01 compared with the no pouchitis group). The CARD15 insertion mutation L1007fsinsC was present in 14% of patients with pouchitis and in 0% without pouchitis (P < 0.05). All patients who carried L1007fsinsC developed more than 2 episodes per year. CONCLUSIONS: CARD15 polymorphisms are seen in greater frequency in patients with pouchitis after IPAA for UC. These findings, if borne out in prospective analyses, suggest that CARD15 mutations, particularly L1007fsinsC, may predispose to the development of pouchitis after IPAA for UC.},

   abstract = {PURPOSE OF REVIEW: This review reports on the recent progress understanding mechanisms of action and clinical applications of probiotics. RECENT FINDINGS: New insights on regulating mechanisms of intestinal commensal bacteria to prevent and treat different gastrointestinal diseases have been reported. Some probiotics, though not all, exert beneficial effects by modulating the mucosal barrier function and immune activity. It seems that a combination of different probiotics is more effective than a single strain. It was demonstrated that not only viable bacteria administered to the intestinal tract but also isolated probiotic DNA is active, even if injected subcutaneously. There is reasonable evidence to recommend probiotics in infectious diarrhoea for prevention and treatment (mainly in children) and to prevent antibiotic-induced gastrointestinal side effects. Furthermore, probiotics are effective in maintaining remission in ulcerative colitis and preventing and treating pouchitis. Promising positive effects were published in major surgery patients (gastric resection, pancreatic resection, liver transplantation) and in severe necrotising acute pancreatitis. SUMMARY: Increasing knowledge on probiotics is exciting, but in the near future it must be defined which probiotics (single strains or a combination) are most effective in specific diseases. Well-designed, randomized clinical trials are still required to further define the role of probiotics as preventive and therapeutic agents.},

   abstract = {OBJECTIVES: Information on the occurrence and frequency of pulmonary involvement in patients with ulcerative colitis (UC) is inconsistent. Some authors reported pulmonary impairment with UC by standard pulmonary function tests (PFTs) and documented a reduced diffusing capacity for carbon monoxide (DLCO) especially in patients with active disease, whereas others could not detect differences in routine PFTs between UC patients and controls. AIM: The aim of this prospective study was to determine the frequency and type of pulmonary dysfunction in patients with UC with respect to disease activity. Furthermore, to evaluate the influence of smoking, nutritional status, sputum cytology and sulphasalazine therapy on PFT parameters. PATIENTS AND METHODS: Twenty-six patients with UC (20 with active disease, 6 inactive) and 16 age and sex matched healthy controls were investigated with respect to the following pulmonary function tests, forced vital capacity (FVC), forced expiratory volume in the 1s (FEV(1)%) and their ratio (FEV(1)/FVC) and forced expiratory flow 25-75% (FEF25-75%) as well as oxygen saturation. For UC patients, colonoscopy and biopsy were done. Disease activity was assessed by Truelove index for UC. Induced sputum was sampled for cytology. Smoking habit, body mass index (BMI) and medications were recorded. RESULTS: Fifteen out of 26 patients with UC (57.6%) exhibited at least one pathological pulmonary function test (<80% of predicted value). Small airway obstruction was reported in the 15 patients, restrictive dysfunction in 30.7% and obstructive dysfunction in 11.5%. The impairment of PFTs was significant and more pronounced in patients with active disease, FVC (-14% of predicted), FEV(1) (-9% of predicted) and FEF25-75% (-32% of predicted), P<0.01, 0.05 and 0.01, respectively. There was no significant influence of smoking and medications on PFTs. CONCLUSIONS: UC patients show significantly decreased lung function tests in comparison to healthy controls. The impairment in active disease exceeded that during the remission. Early recognition is important, as they can be strikingly steroid responsive.},

OBJECTIVE: The objective was to ascertain endogenous amino acid losses from the small bowel in human subjects consuming a protein-free diet or a diet with enzyme-hydrolyzed casein (EHC; MW <5000) as the sole source of nitrogen. DESIGN: The subjects were 8 men and women with terminal ileum ileostomies after ulcerative colitis who consumed the protein-free and EHC-based diets in a crossover design. Each subject received each test diet in single meals followed by 2 consecutive 9-h total collections of digesta. Digesta samples for the EHC treatment were centrifuged and ultrafiltered (10 000 MW cutoff), with the precipitate-plus-retentate fraction (>10 000 MW) providing a measurement of endogenous ileal amino acids. RESULTS: The mean endogenous flows for most of the amino acids and nitrogen were significantly (P < 0.05) higher when determined with the EHC-based diet than with the protein-free diet. Mean (n = 8) endogenous ileal nitrogen flows were 2061 and 4233 mug/g dry matter intake for the protein-free and EHC-based diets, respectively. CONCLUSION: The traditional protein-free method underestimates endogenous ileal amino acid loss in adults.},

The validated acute procedure was then applied using human ileostomates to determine apparent and true ileal amino acid digestibilities of 4 dietary protein sources. The acute method involved feeding ileostomized pigs a single meal containing the test protein as part of a purified diet, with no previous dietary adaptation, followed by an 8-h collection of digesta. Apparent ileal N digestibility did not differ between the acute and conventional (14-d study) procedures. Eight adult human ileostomates each received a single meal of protein-free biscuits and a drink containing sodium caseinate, whey protein concentrate, soy protein isolate, or soy protein concentrate; this meal was followed by a 9-h total digesta collection period. Acid insoluble ash was used as an indigestible marker. True ileal amino acid digestibilities (means +/- SE) ranged from 90.5 +/- 2.74% for cysteine in soy protein concentrate to 105.3 +/- 5.66% for cysteine in sodium caseinate and were markedly higher than their apparent counterparts. True ileal digestibilities for total nitrogen were 101.9 +/- 0.70, 98.3 +/- 0.80, 99.5 +/- 0.80, and 98.5 +/- 1.20% for sodium caseinate, whey protein concentrate, soy protein isolate, and soy protein concentrate, respectively. The 4 protein sources were virtually completely digested in humans by the end of the small intestine.},

METHODS: Two hundred patients (104 wellnourished and 96 malnourished) were assessed according to the Subjective Global Assessment, anthropometric measurements and bioelectrical impedance analysis. Quality of life was determined with the validated Medical Outcomes Study 36-item Short-Form General Health Survey (SF 36). Muscle function was assessed by hand grip strength and peak flow. RESULTS: Body mass index, body cell mass, arm muscle area and hand grip strength were significantly lower in the malnourished patients. Quality of life was generally lower when compared to norm values. Seven out of eight quality of life scales (excluding bodily pain) were significantly reduced in the malnourished patients. Comparing patients with liver cirrhosis and inflammatory bowel disease (IBD), patients with IBD experienced significantly lower values in the perception of bodily pain,social functioning and mental health. Malnourished liver cirrhotics suffered reductions in more scales (six out of eight) than malnourished IBD patients did (four out of eight). CONCLUSION: Quality of life is generally low in benign gastrointestinal disease and is further reduced in patients who are classified as malnourished. It appears that liver cirrhosis patients experience a higher quality of life than IBD patients do, but the impact of malnutrition seems to be greater in liver cirrhosis than in IBD.},

However, human data supporting this assumption are missing. METHODS: A total of 24 consecutive patients with an acute exacerbation of IBD (19 Crohn's disease; five ulcerative colitis) and scheduled for total parenteral nutrition (TPN) (>7 days) were randomised. Parallel to a standardised anti-inflammatory therapy, the patients received either a TPN with 1.5 g/kg body weight of a standard amino acid or an isonitrogenic, isocaloric TPN with 1.2 g/kg body weight of a standard amino acid and 0.3 g/kg L-alanine-L-glutamine. Primary end points were gln plasma concentrations and intestinal permeability assessed by urinary lactulose and D-xylose ratio. RESULTS: Gln plasma levels did not differ significantly in either group throughout the study. Intestinal permeability did not change within 7 days either with or without gln supplementation (Delta-lactulose/xylose ratio: 0.01+/-0.05 (gln+) vs 0.02+/-0.1 (gln-)). The observed changes in inflammatory and nutritional parameters, and also disease activity, length of TPN and hospital stay, were independent of glutamine substitution. Five (41%) patients in the gln+ group and three (25%) patients in the gln- group needed surgical intervention. CONCLUSION: Although limited by the sample size, these results do not support the hypothesis that glutamine substitution has an obvious biochemical or clinical benefit in patients with active IBD scheduled for total parenteral nutrition.},

However, long-term corticosteroid use is associated with serious complications such as osteoporosis, diabetes, and growth retardation. The effect of combination therapy corticosteroid plus leukocytapheresis has been previously reported, but that of leukocytapheresis with no corticosteroid is unknown. We carried out a preliminary study of six patients (two men and four women) with active ulcerative colitis (severe in two, moderately severe in four) who did not respond to 5-aminosalicylate derivatives, but refused corticosteroid use. Centrifugal leukocytapheresis was carried out once per week totaling four sessions per course. Treatment was considered effective when patients experienced clinical remission, which was defined as a frequency of diarrhea of four times or less and absence of visible blood in the stool, after one course. Leukocytapheresis was effective in five of six patients(83%). With cases stratified by severity, both severe cases and three of four moderately severe cases showed effectiveness. Clinical activity scores according to Lichtiger et al. in cases where leukocytapheresis was effective decreased from 9.8 to 6.6 at 1 week (P < 0.0001), declining further 2.4 at the end of the course. No obvious complications of leukocytapheresis were noted except for a decrease in hemoglobin by 1 g/dL. Centrifugal leukocytapheresis without corticosteroid treatment can induce remission in patients with active ulcerative colitis, and might be particularly beneficial for patients in whom adverse effects preclude the use of corticosteroids.},

This role includes the prevention and correction of malnutrition, the prevention of osteoporosis and in children the promotion of optimal growth and development. In active Crohn's disease nutritional therapy (in the form of enteral feeding) is an effective primary therapy for many patients. Corticosteroids, however, are more effective than enteral diet therapy in adults. Enteral diets should be considered as primary therapy in pediatric Crohn's disease, especially in children with poor nutritional status or growth impairment. Enteral nutrition does not have a proven primary therapeutic role in ulcerative colitis. There are many theories that suggest that diet may be implicated in the aetiology of inflammatory bowel disease, however, there are, as yet, no dietary approaches proven to reduce the risk of developing IBD.},

   abstract = {BACKGROUND AND AIMS: Assessment of health-related quality of life (HRQOL) is of increasing importance in the evaluation of new therapies for inflammatory bowel disease (IBD). Available data concerning HRQOL in pediatric patients are sparse and uniformly cross-sectional. The aim of this study was to describe HRQOL and influential factors in newly diagnosed pediatric patients with Crohn's disease and ulcerative colitis during the first 12 months after diagnosis. MATERIALS AND METHODS: Participants were drawn from a large, prospectively derived observational IBD registry of pediatric patients studied through 18 U.S. and Canadian centers. Patients who had completed a baseline IMPACT questionnaire and for whom there were 12 months of follow-up data available were included. In addition to description of cohort, factors that were believed to influence HLQOL were assessed during the course of the year from diagnosis. RESULTS: Two hundred eighteen children met inclusion criteria (77% Crohn's disease, 23 % ulcerative colitis, mean age 12.7 +/- 1.9 years). Mean total IMPACT score at baseline was 154, 181 at 6 months, and 191 at 1 year (possible range 0-238, with increasing scores representing better quality of life). Repeated measures analysis showed that age and disease severity significantly negatively affected the IMPACT scores during the course of the year. CONCLUSIONS: In this large prospective pediatric IBD cohort, significant improvement in HRQOL is noted during the year from diagnosis. Mean IMPACT scores varied significantly depending on the disease severity and also decreased with increasing age.},

CONCLUSION: The height-for-age and the BMI-for-age, as evaluated by z-scores, of children with ulcerative colitis (UC) did not differ from those of normal Danish children, but Crohn's disease (CD) children had significantly lower height and BMI values, both when compared to normal children and children with UC. In contrast to UC, CD is frequently complicated by malnutrition and growth retardation at the time of diagnosis.},

   abstract = {BACKGROUND: Steroid-based intensive medical therapy for severe ulcerative colitis is successful in 60-70% of such patients. Patients with complications or those refractory to medical therapy require emergency colectomy for salvage. Little is known about the impact of timing of surgical intervention and surgical outcomes of such patients undergoing emergency surgery in India where the diagnosis is often delayed or missed in patients who are poor, malnourished and non-compliant to medical treatment. METHODS: The clinical records of all patients undergoing emergency surgery for severe ulcerative colitis or its complication in the Department of GI surgery AIIMS, New Delhi, India, between January 1985 and December 2003 were retrieved and data pertaining to demographic features, duration of intensive medical therapy, presence of complications, time from admission to emergency surgery, surgical procedure, in-hospital morbidity and mortality and follow up status extracted. RESULTS: A total of 72 patients underwent emergency surgery (Subtotal colectomy: 60; ileostomy alone under local anaesthesia: 12). Poor nutritional status was seen in 61% of the patients. Twenty-one patients (29%) underwent emergency surgery for complications of severe ulcerative colitis such as colonic perforation (spontaneous 6, iatrogenic 4), massive lower gastrointestinal haemorrhage (5), toxic megacolon (4) and large bowel obstruction (2). The remaining patients (n = 51) underwent emergency surgery following failed intensive therapy; 17 underwent surgery < or = 5 days (Group I) and 34 were operated > 5 days (Group II) after initiation of intensive therapy. In this group all the post-operative deaths (n = 8) occurred in those who were operated after 5 days. The difference in mortality in these two groups (i.e. surgical intervention < or = or > 5 days) was statistically significant {0/17 (Group I) vs 8/34 (Group II); p = 0.03}. Overall, 12 patients died (in-hospital mortality: 16.7%). The mortality was higher (10/43; 23.3%) in our early experience (i.e. 1985-1995) when compared to our subsequent experience (2/29; 6.9%) (1996-2003). A total of 48 patients (including 3 awaiting a restorative procedure) are alive on follow up (66.7%; 3 patients lost to follow up). A restorative procedure could be successfully completed in 81% of the survivors of the emergency procedure. CONCLUSION: To optimize the outcome, a combined team of physicians and surgeons should be involved in the management of patients with severe ulcerative colitis with focus on nutritional support, correction of metabolic derangements, close clinical monitoring and timely assessment for the need for emergency surgery. This retrospective analysis shows that improved results can be achieved with experience and by following a policy of early surgical intervention within 5 days, especially in patients who have failed intensive medical therapy.},

   abstract = {OBJECTIVES: Previous studies of vitamin D status in pediatric patients with inflammatory bowel disease have revealed conflicting results. We sought to report (1) the prevalence of vitamin D deficiency (serum 25-hydroxy-vitamin D concentration < or = 15 ng/mL) in a large population with inflammatory bowel disease, (2) factors predisposing to this problem, and (3) its relationship to bone health and serum parathyroid hormone concentration. PATIENTS AND METHODS: A total of 130 patients (8-22 years of age) with inflammatory bowel disease, 94 with Crohn disease and 36 with ulcerative colitis, had serum 25-hydroxy-vitamin D, intact parathyroid hormone, and lumbar spine bone mineral density (using dual-energy x-ray absorptiometry) measured at Children's Hospital Boston. RESULTS: The prevalence of vitamin D deficiency was 34.6%. Mean serum 25-hydroxy-vitamin D concentration was similar in patients with Crohn disease and ulcerative colitis, 52.6% lower among patients with dark skin complexion, 33.4% lower during the winter months (December 22 to March 21), and 31.5% higher among patients who were taking vitamin D supplements. Serum 25-hydroxy-vitamin D concentration was positively correlated with weight and BMI z score, disease duration, and serum albumin concentration and negatively correlated with erythrocyte sedimentation rate. Patients with Crohn disease and upper gastrointestinal tract involvement were more likely to be vitamin D deficient than those without it. Serum 25-hydroxy-vitamin concentration was not associated with lumbar spine bone mineral density z score or serum parathyroid hormone concentration. CONCLUSIONS: Vitamin D deficiency is highly prevalent among pediatric patients with inflammatory bowel disease. Factors predisposing to the problem include having a dark-skin complexion, winter season, lack of vitamin D supplementation, early stage of disease, more severe disease, and upper gastrointestinal tract involvement in patients with Crohn disease. The long-term significance of hypovitaminosis D for this population is unknown at present and merits additional study.},

   abstract = {GOALS: Our goals were to answer 2 questions: (1) Is the presentation of early-onset inflammatory bowel disease (IBD) similar to typical adolescent-onset IBD? (2) Is there variability in familial aggregation in childhood IBD? BACKGROUND: The phenotype of IBD in children under 5 years of age (early-onset) is poorly defined. Clinical and genetic studies of IBD, however, generally assume the phenotype to be homogenous throughout childhood. STUDY: We analyzed data from 413 consecutive pediatric IBD outpatients attending our center between 1995 and 2000. Disease type, anatomic distribution, and family history were compared between children presenting before (early-onset) and after the age of five (5 to 15 y). RESULTS: Disease presentation was predominantly colonic in early-onset IBD, most patients presenting with ulcerative colitis (UC). Isolated colonic disease was most frequent in early-onset Crohn disease (colonic 76.5%, ileocolic 24%) compared with ileocolic disease (ileocolic 45.5%, colonic 26%, ileal 19.4%, proximal 6.3%) in the older age group. First-degree family history was highest in early-onset UC 26% versus 11% in the older UC group. CONCLUSIONS: We describe a distinct phenotype of early childhood onset IBD, with a strikingly high familial aggregation in UC and greater tendency to present with colonic disease. As more genetic heterogeneity is identified in IBD, careful definition of phenotype is required to identify further susceptibility genes. The early-onset form of UC presents an ideal group for further genetic analysis. These phenotype differences also suggest that treatment and outcome may vary in early-onset childhood IBD; prospective studies are required to confirm this.},

   abstract = {INTRODUCTION: The association of inflammatory bowel disease (IBD) with decreased bone mineral density is well recognized. In the adult population, up to 50% of IBD patients are reported to have osteopenia, correlating with an increase in the incidence of fractures as compared with controls. The aim of this study was to determine the prevalence of fractures in a pediatric population with IBD as compared with healthy sibling controls (SC). PATIENTS AND METHODS: The families of 209 patients with IBD were sent a questionnaire asking them to compare their children with IBD to a healthy sibling (non-IBD). RESULTS: Surveys were returned by 132 of the 209 families (63%). The sample characteristics of this sample closely resembled the overall clinic population for age (mean 14.3 vs 14.7 years), gender (53% vs 59% male) and diagnosis (58.1 vs 57.8 Crohn disease). Completed surveys described 263 children. Of the 132 with IBD 73 (55%) had Crohn disease, 52 (39%) had ulcerative colitis and 7 (6%) had indeterminate colitis. There were 76/132 males (age range, 4-18 years) with IBD and 64/131 males (age range, 1-26 years) in the sibling controls. Mean ages of the IBD sample 14.3 +/-.3 was compared with 13.9 +/- in SC. Of the total group, 73/263 (28%) reported ever having a fracture, 44 (60%) were siblings (SC), and 29 (40%) had IBD. Of the 29 children with IBD, 17 (59%) reported having a fracture after diagnosis including 2 who had fractures both before and after diagnosis. The total number of fractures reported was 96 (55 SC:41 IBD). CONCLUSION: In this survey, we found no statistically significant difference in the prevalence of fracture in IBD patients compared with their normal siblings.},

METHODS: Diagnostic criteria for CD, ulcerative colitis (UC), and indeterminate colitis (IC) were defined. Medical records provided a source of basic information about the children. A standardized protocol was filled out and sent to the coordinator of the study. All protocols were checked to see whether the data corresponded to the defined criteria and then were processed further. The study was retrospective in character for the years 1990 to 1999 and prospective for the years 2000 and 2001. RESULTS: Diagnostic criteria were met in 470 patients with IBD; 201 of them turned 18 years old during the study period. CD was diagnosed in 223 patients. The incidence of CD in children up to 15 years of age increased from 0.25/100,000 in 1990 to 1.25/100,000 in 2001. Eighty-two percent of children with CD were treated with aminosalicylates in combination with corticosteroids; 29% of patients received azathioprine. Severe growth retardation was recorded in 6.4% of adolescents with CD at the age of 18. UC was diagnosed in 202 patients. Therapy with aminosalicylates only was sufficient for control of the disease in 23% patients; 68% children were treated with corticosteroids, 15 of them (23% of the whole group) received additional azathioprine. Criteria for IC were met in 9.8% of all patients with IBD. CONCLUSION: This study confirmed an increase in incidence of CD in children younger than 15 years in the Czech Republic.},

Treatment options for steroid-refractory UC patients are limited and include cyclosporine and colectomy. Although two recent studies (ACT I/II) demonstrate a benefit from infliximab in outpatients with moderate to severely active UC, the utility of infliximab in severe i.v. steroid-refractory UC is less clear. We report our open-label experience with infliximab in hospitalized UC patients at the University of Pittsburgh Medical Center. All hospitalized UC patients who had received infliximab were identified. Age, sex, extent of UC, duration of disease, concomitant medication, hospital course, and response to infliximab were recorded. Response to infliximab was defined as avoidance of colectomy and cessation of corticosteroids. There were 12 UC inpatients refractory to intravenous corticosteroids and subsequently treated with infliximab. Nine of the 12 patients (75%) failed to respond to infliximab and required a colectomy; median time to colectomy was 3 months. Three patients (25%) did respond to infliximab and were able to withdraw from corticosteroids. In this open-label analysis, infliximab was not effective for the majority of UC patients refractory to intravenous corticosteroids. Whether earlier use of infliximab would prevent the need for hospitalization and colectomy is uncertain.},

   abstract = {OBJECTIVES: The incidence and age of onset of inflammatory bowel disease (IBD) appear to be changing. The aim of this study was to determine whether the prevalence of cigarette smoking differs among patients with Crohn's disease (CD) or ulcerative colitis (UC) at the time of diagnosis compared with the general population and whether smoking history is related to the type and age of IBD onset. METHODS: Prevalence rates of smoking at the time of IBD diagnosis were compared between patients with CD and UC from the IBD Center at the University of Pittsburgh Medical Center versus age-, gender-, and time period-adjusted rates in the Pennsylvania general population. Analyses also were stratified by gender and diagnoses before and after 40 years of age, i.e., early and late onset. RESULTS: There were 263 IBD patients (144 UC patients and 119 CD patients) seen in the IBD center between August 2000 and December 2002. The prevalence of active smoking was significantly higher at diagnosis in CD patients compared with the Pennsylvania general population (33% versus 24%, P = 0.04), particularly in those with CD onset at 40 years of age or later (47% versus 27%, P = 0.005). In contrast, smoking prevalence was significantly lower in UC patients than the general population (9% versus 28%, P < 0.0001), particularly among those with UC onset before the age of 40 years (6% versus 27%, P < 0.0001). Smoking cessation was associated with an approximate, but nonsignificant, 3-fold higher likelihood of late-onset UC compared with CD. CONCLUSIONS: Cigarette smoking is associated with the development of late-onset CD and is protective against developing UC at any age, particularly early onset. Former smoking is associated with a high likelihood of developing late-onset UC, but not CD.},

Physicians choose therapy based on evidence-based data, peer and expert opinion, and personal experience. This article provides treatment guidelines for the induction and maintenance of ulcerative proctitis and left-sided colitis and the management of disease refractory to 5-aminosalicylic acid (5-ASA) compounds and corticosteroids The guidelines are derived from evidence-based data and, when lacking, expert opinion or the authors' experience. The comprehensive review of the literature is presented in the accompanying article, "The Medical Management of Left-Sided Ulcerative Colitis and Ulcerative Proctitis: Critical Evaluation of Therapeutic Trials". Rectally administered 5-ASA and corticosteroid suppositories are effective treatment for most ulcerative proctitis patients. Corticosteroid and 5-ASA enemas, which reach the splenic flexure of the colon, are recommended for patients with left-sided ulcerative colitis. The combination of rectally administered 5-ASA enemas and oral 5-ASA agents may afford better treatment of left-sided colitis and possibly prevent proximal extension of disease. Patients refractory to 5-ASAs and corticosteroids may require an immunomodulator or biological response modifier therapy. Those who have ongoing signs and symptoms of ulcerative proctitis and left-sided ulcerative colitis despite maximal medical therapy require a proctocolectomy.},

   abstract = {BACKGROUND: The goal of this work was to critically evaluate the published studies on the treatment of ulcerative proctitis (UP) and left-sided ulcerative colitis (L-UC). The results of this review provided the content for the accompanying treatment guidelines, Clinical Guidelines for the Medical Management of Left-sided Ulcerative Colitis and Ulcerative Proctitis: Summary Statement. METHODS: All English language articles published between 1995 and September 2005 were identified through a comprehensive literature search using OVID and PubMed. The quality of the data supporting or rejecting the use of specific therapies was categorized by a data quality grading scale. An "A+" grade was assigned to treatment supported by multiple high-quality randomized controlled trials with consistent results, whereas a "D" grade was given to therapy supported only by expert opinion. The therapeutic efficacy of a treatment was defined by its success in treating UP and L-UC compared with placebo. A medication was ranked as "excellent" if it was specifically studied for UP and L-UC and had consistently positive results compared with placebo or another agent. Quality and efficacy scores were agreed on by author consensus. RESULTS: For the acute treatment of UP or L-UC, the rectally administered corticosteroids and mesalazine (5-ASA), either alone or in combination with oral 5-ASAs, are the most effective therapy: evidence quality, A+; efficacy, excellent. Only rectally administered 5-ASA received an A+/excellent rating for maintenance of remission. Infliximab received an A+ grade for induction and maintenance of remission but only a "good" rating because the studies were performed in all UC, not specifically UP or L-UC. CONCLUSIONS: This critical evaluation of treatment provides a "report card" on medications available for the management of patients with UP and L-UC. The guidelines should provide a useful reference and supplement for physicians treating UC patients.},

   abstract = {UC (ulcerative colitis) patients have an increased risk of developing colorectal cancer compared with the normal population. The cause underlying this higher risk is not fully defined but includes nutritional and environmental factors concomitant with genetic alterations. We aimed to evaluate genetic stability in the colonic tissue of UC patients in clinical remission compared with the healthy population, and to establish a possible correlation between nutritional habits and these molecular assessments. UC patients (n 42) and healthy controls (n 37) participated in the study. All participants were histopathologically and medically diagnosed. Participants completed five separate 7 d dietary records, food-frequency questionnaires and validated 24 h recalls for nutritional assessment. The extent of chromosome 17 loss and the calculated chromosome index was determined in colon tissue biopsies by fluorescence in situ hybridisation. Correlations between the molecular and nutritional assessments were performed using Pearson's correlation coefficients. Significant differences in the nutritional intake of total fat (65 (SD 15) v. 89 (SD 25) g), cholesterol (330 (SD 168) v. 464 (SD 177) mg), dietary fibre (32 (SD 4.7) v. 9 (SD 4) g), vitamin A (1009 (SD 209) v. 506 (SD 204) microg), vitamin C (308 (SD 108) v. 72 (SD 53) mg) and folic acid (412 (SD 89 microg) v. 187 (SD 107)) were recorded for UC patients compared with controls. Significant correlations were found for the consumption of different food groups and the chromosome index for chromosome 17. The results of our study suggest that the nutritional habits adopted by UC patients during clinical remission may affect key cellular components of the colonic tissue, inducing a high degree of aneuploidy and genetic instability, and probably affecting the development of colon cancer.},

The patient was diagnosed with inflammatory bowel disease, thought to be consistent with ulcerative colitis, in March 2003, but had no medical history up until this point. Initial treatment with mesalamine was unsuccessful and she subsequently presented with medically resistant fulminant colitis and required an urgent colectomy in June 2003. Her immediate postoperative course was uneventful and she was discharged on tapering doses of prednisone. In August 2003, an ileoscopy revealed inflamed, mildly ulcerated mucosa, and biopsies were consistent with Crohn's disease. Azathioprine was added to the treatment regimen and the patient tapered off prednisone. At this stage the patient continued to do well clinically up until presentation. INVESTIGATIONS: Small bowel series, abdominal CT scan, abdominal ultrasound, exploratory laparotomy. DIAGNOSIS: Acute mesenteric ischemia secondary to superior mesenteric vein thrombosis. MANAGEMENT: Resection of necrotic bowel, antibiotics and systemic anticoagulation.},

In the present clinical study, we aimed to analyze characteristics and clinical course of children with very early onset IBD. We were particularly interested in the relationship between bacterial infections and the use of antibiotics before the onset of IBD. PATIENTS AND METHODS: The IBD database of Necker-Enfants-Malades-Hospital was screened for patients with IBD with disease onset during the first year of life and a follow-up of at least 2.5 years. Ten patients were identified during the period 1996-2002. RESULTS: All patients presented with rectal bleeding and had colonic involvement. Four patients had definitive diagnosis of Crohn disease; ulcerative or indeterminate colitis was seen in 2 and 4 children, respectively. Five of the patients had a positive history of neonatal or early-onset bacterial infection with use of antibiotics before onset of IBD, 4 patients were still breastfed and 3 just weaned when GI symptoms started. Seven patients had a severe onset of disease requiring bowel rest, parenteral nutrition and steroid medication, followed by azathioprine or cyclosporine medication. Surgery was necessary in 3 of 10 patients. Disease relapses were frequent and observed in 8 of 10 children. DISCUSSION: Very early onset IBD may reflect a subgroup of patients characterized by a particular sensitivity to modifications of the intestinal flora. Neonatal IBD was most often severe in presentation and evolution.},

   abstract = {Ulcerative colitis (UC) and Crohn disease (CD) are chronic intestinal inflammatory diseases that can present as bloody diarrhea, abdominal pain, and malnutrition. Collectively, these disorders are referred to as inflammatory bowel disease (IBD). All patients with IBD share a common pathophysiology. However, there are a number of developmental, psychosocial, and physiologic issues that are unique to the approximate, equals 20% of patients that present during childhood or adolescence. These include the possibility of disease-induced delays in linear growth or physical development, differences in drug dosing, and the changes in social and cognitive development that occur as children move from school-age years into adolescence and early adulthood. Gastroenterologists caring for these children must therefore develop an optimal regimen of pharmacologic therapies, nutritional management, psychologic support, and properly timed surgery (when necessary) that will maintain disease remission, minimize disease and drug-induced adverse effects, and optimize growth and development. This article reviews current approaches to the management of patients with UC and CD and highlights issues specific to the treatment of children with IBD. The principal medical therapies used to induce disease remission in patients with UC are aminosalicylates (for mild disease), corticosteroids (for moderate disease), and cyclosporine (ciclosporin) (for severe disease). If a patient responds to the induction regimen, maintenance therapies that are used to prevent disease relapse include aminosalicylates, mercaptopurine, and azathioprine. Colectomy with creation of an ileal pouch anal anastomosis (J pouch) has become the standard of care for patients with severe or refractory colitis and results in an improved quality of life in most patients. Therefore, the risks associated with using increasingly potent immunosuppressant agents must be balanced in each case against a patient's desire to retain their colon and avoid a temporary or potentially permanent ileostomy. Decisions about drug therapy in the management of patients with CD are more complex and depend on both the location (e.g. gastroduodenal vs small intestinal vs colonic), as well as the behavior of the disease (inflammatory/mucosal vs stricturing vs perforating) in a given patient. Induction therapies for CD typically include aminosalicylates and antibiotics (for mild mucosal disease), nutritional therapy (including elemental or polymeric formulas), corticosteroids (for moderate disease), and infliximab (for corticosteroid-resistant or fistulizing disease). Aminosalicylates, mercaptopurine, azathioprine, methotrexate, and infliximab can be used as maintenance therapies. Because surgical treatment of CD is not curative, it is typically reserved for those patients either with persistent symptoms and disease limited to a small section of the intestine (e.g. the terminal ileum and cecum) or for the management of complications of the disease including stricture or abdominal abscess. When surgery is necessary, maintenance medications administered postoperatively will postpone recurrence. Patients with UC and CD are at risk for the development of micronutrient deficiencies (including folate, iron, and vitamin D deficiencies) and require close nutritional monitoring. In addition, patients with UC and CD involving the colon are at increased risk of developing colon cancer, and should be enrolled into a colonoscopy surveillance program after 8-10 years of disease duration.},

   abstract = {A considerable literature has been published on the health benefits of fish, oil-rich fish and fish oils and their constituent long-chain (LC) n-3 PUFA. Evidence from epidemiological studies highlights the cardioprotective attributes of diets rich in fish, especially oil-rich fish. Data from intervention trials are consistent in suggesting that LC n-3 PUFA lower the risk of CVD, probably by the multiple mechanisms of lowering serum triacylglycerols, improving the LDL:HDL ratio, anti-arrhythmic effects on heart muscle, improved plaque stability, anti-thrombotic effects and reduced endothelial activation. Research indicates LC n-3 PUFA provision has an impact during development, and there is preliminary evidence that docosahexaenoic acid supplementation during pregnancy could optimise brain and retina development in the infant. LC n-3 PUFA are also postulated to ameliorate behavioural and mental health disturbances such as depression, schizophrenia, dementia and attention deficit hyperactivity disorder. However, despite some positive evidence in each of these areas, use of LC n-3 PUFA in these conditions remains at the experimental stage. In the case of immune function, there is little doubt that LC n-3 PUFA have a positive effect. Although intervention trials in rheumatoid arthritis show strong evidence of benefit, evidence for efficacy in other inflammatory conditions, including Crohn's disease, ulcerative colitis, psoriasis, lupus, multiple sclerosis, cystic fibrosis and asthma, is inconsistent or inadequate. More promising evidence in some conditions may come from studies which attempt to modify the fetal environment using LC n-3 PUFA supplementation during pregnancy.},

   abstract = {To evaluate the role of dietary factors in the etiology of inflammatory bowel disease (IBD), we conducted a multicenter hospital-based case-control study in a Japanese population. Cases were IBD patients aged 15 to 34 years [ulcerative colitis (UC) 111 patients; Crohn's disease (CD) 128 patients] within 3 years after diagnosis in 13 hospitals. One control subject was recruited for each case who was matched for sex, age, and hospital. A semiquantitative food frequency questionnaire was used to estimate preillness intakes of food groups and nutrients. All the available control subjects (n = 219) were pooled, and unconditional logistic models were applied to calculate odds ratios (ORs). In the food groups, a higher consumption of sweets was positively associated with UC risk [OR for the highest versus lowest quartile, 2.86; 95% confidence interval (CI), 1.24 to 6.57], whereas the consumption of sugars and sweeteners (OR, 2.12; 95% CI, 1.08 to 4.17), sweets (OR, 2.83; 95% CI, 1.38 to 5.83), fats and oils (OR, 2.64; 95% CI, 1.29 to 5.39), and fish and shellfish (OR, 2.41; 95% CI, 1.18-4.89) were positively associated with CD risk. In respect to nutrients, the intake of vitamin C (OR, 0.45; 95% CI, 0.21 to 0.99) was negatively related to UC risk, while the intake of total fat (OR, 2.86; 95% CI, 1.39 to 5.90), monounsaturated fatty acids (OR, 2.49; 95% CI, 1.23 to 5.03) and polyunsaturated fatty acids (OR, 2.31; 95% CI, 1.12 to 4.79), vitamin E (OR, 3.23; 95% CI, 1.45 to 7.17), and n-3 (OR, 3.24; 95% CI, 1.52 to 6.88) and n-6 fatty acids (OR, 2.57; 95% CI, 1.24 to 5.32) was positively associated with CD risk. Although this study suffers from the shortcoming of recall bias, which is inherent in most retrospective studies (prospective studies are warranted to confirm the associations between diet and IBD risk), the present findings suggest the importance of dietary factors for IBD prevention.},

   abstract = {Angiogenesis is an essential component of ulcer healing since it assures delivery of oxygen and nutrients to the healing site. Previous studies demonstrated increased serum and tissue levels of vascular endothelial growth factor (VEGF, the most potent angiogenic growth factor) in patients with active ulcerative colitis (UC) and animal models of UC. However, there is no explanation why the healing of UC-related mucosal injury is impaired despite increased expression of VEGF. Expression of angiogenesis inhibitors, angiostatin and/or endostatin, in UC has not been determined before. We examined expression of VEGF, angiostatin, and endostatin in two models of experimental UC. The results revealed that in addition to increased VEGF, both endostatin and angiostatin levels were markedly (2-3-folds) increased in colonic mucosa at early stage of experimental UC. This is the first demonstration that colitis triggers increase in angiostatin and endostatin levels. The results may explain why mucosal lesions heal slowly despite increased VEGF levels, and may provide a novel and mechanistic insight into UC.},

   abstract = {Anemia associated with long-standing chronic inflammation and iron deficiency, and the increased risk for the development of dysplasia and carcinoma, are two of the most common complications in patients with ulcerative colitis (UC). Because of iron and nutrition deficiency, UC patients are encouraged to consume a high-protein and high-iron diet. The crucial clinical question is the effect of a high-iron diet on inflammation activity and inflammation-driven carcinogenesis. Is a high-iron diet a foe or a feat in UC and UC-associated carcinogenesis? This review updates the progress and information on (1) iron nutrition and iron-deficiency anemia in patients with UC, (2) experimental evidence of the exacerbating effect of a high-iron diet on UC and its associated carcinogenesis and the difference between a high-iron diet and parental iron supplementation, (3) the clinical efficacy of, and concerns about, oral and intravenous iron supplements in patients with inflammatory bowel disease and iron deficiency anemia, and (4) the clinical implications of long-term iron supplements and management of UC. These experimental findings from animal models provide evidence to warrant further consideration and clinical studies of iron nutrition, inflammation activity, and cancer development.},

   abstract = {PURPOSE: To describe the reported health-related quality of life (HRQOL) in children and adolescents with inflammatory bowel disease (IBD) after attending an IBD summer camp. METHODS: A prospective analysis of quality of life was completed at an overnight camp that was exclusively for patients with IBD, which was sponsored by the Crohn's and Colitis Foundation of America. The IMPACT-II questionnaire (Canada and United States) and the State-Trait Anxiety Inventory for Children were administered to the campers at the beginning and at the end of a 1-week camp to assess HRQOL and anxiety. The IMPACT-II questionnaire consists of 35 questions measuring 6 quality-of-life domains (i.e., bowel domain, systemic symptoms, emotional functioning, social functioning, body image, and treatment/interventions). The State-Trait Anxiety Inventory for Children consists of 2 different 20-item sets of questions. One set assesses state anxiety, and the other, trait anxiety. A repeated-measures multivariate analysis of variance was performed to determine the differences between scores attained before and after camp on the IMPACT-II questionnaire and in each of its domains. Paired sample t tests were performed on state and trait anxiety before and after camp. RESULTS: A total of 125 individuals consented to participate, but 61 patients (50 girls and 11 boys; age range, 9 to 16 y) completed the IMPACT-II questionnaire in full. Of those 61 patients, 47 had Crohn's disease and 14 had ulcerative colitis. There was statistically significant improvement between the mean (+/-SD) precamp total score (172.95 +/- 36.61) and the mean postcamp total score (178.71 +/- 40.97; P = 0.035), bowel symptoms scores (P = 0.036), social functioning scores (P = 0.022), and treatment interventions scores (P = 0.012). No difference was found between anxiety scores before and after camp on either the state or trait anxiety inventories (n = 55; P > 0.05). CONCLUSIONS: Overall, HRQOL improved in children after attending IBD summer camp. This exploratory study suggests that contributing factors for these improvements may be an increase in social functioning, a better acceptance of IBD symptoms, and less distress regarding treatment interventions, suggesting that a camp that is specifically designed for children with IBD may normalize the chronic illness experience. However, future research using a multimodal measurement approach is warranted to support these conclusions.},

   abstract = {OBJECTIVE: Children with inflammatory bowel disease (IBD) suffer from malabsorption and malnutrition and therefore may be at risk of developing polyunsaturated fatty acid (PUFA) deficiency. The aim of this study was to investigate PUFA status in children with IBD and the possible relationship to disease activity and nutritional status. MATERIAL AND METHODS: We assessed the fatty acid composition of plasma phospholipids (%wt/wt) of 21 children aged 5.5-18 years with IBD (ulcerative colitis, 15; Crohn's disease, 6) with mild or moderate disease activity. The clinical symptoms and biochemical indices of disease activity and nutritional status (lean and fat body mass, Hb, albumin serum conc.) were also determined. RESULTS: The patients had lower phospholipid PUFAs than 13 healthy, aged-matched controls (25.8+/-5.2 versus 34.2+/-5.7, M+/-SD, p<0.001), mainly due to lower values of linoleic acid (18:2n-6, 14.0+/-3.8 versus 18.3+/-4.3, p<0.01) and its major metabolite arachidonic acid (20:4n-6, 5.3+/-2.0 versus 9.3+/-1.9, p<0.0001). There were also higher values of a-linolenic acid (18:3n-3, 0.3+/-0.4 versus 0.2+/-0.1, p<0.01) while the long-chain n-3 PUFA-eicosapentaenoic and docosahexaenoic acids were normal. Total n-6 PUFA correlated inversely to erythrocyte sedimentation rate (p<0.01), seromucoid (p<0.05) and positively to Hb concentration (p<0.01). CONCLUSIONS: Children with inflammatory bowel disease have a high risk of n-6 PUFA depletion, which is related to disease activity.},

The aim of this study was to identify foods causing intolerance and to determine the nature and severity of reported symptoms. Patients from the Dutch Crohn's and Ulcerative Colitis Association were mailed a survey on food intolerance; 105 (31% men) of 137 patients took part. They all reported intolerance to one or more foods. Common symptoms (scored from 0=absent to 10=severe), included diarrhea (mean score=5.8), fatigue (mean score=5.5), and thirst (mean score=4.6). Spicy foods, cabbage, and citrus fruits (or juice) were most likely to decrease stool consistency, increase stool frequency, or cause perianal irritation. Onions, cabbage, or leeks were reported by 28% of the patients to cause flatulence. The urge to defecate was stronger after a cooked meal (45% within (1/2) hour) than after sandwiches (15% within (1/2) hour). Foods reported to increase stool consistency were potato products, bread, and bananas. This study demonstrates that food intolerance is a common, albeit mild, problem after ileal pouch-anal anastomosis. Food and nutrition professionals should encourage patients to base their food choices on individual tolerance as long as no (patho-) physiological-based evidence to the contrary is available.},

   abstract = {OBJECTIVES: Experimental studies have shown that luminal antigens are involved in chronic intestinal inflammatory disorders. Bifidogenic growth stimulator (BGS) is a prebiotic preparation produced by Propionibacterium freudenreichii isolated from Swiss cheese. Previously BGS was shown to act in the colon as a growth stimulator of Bifidobacteria. This study investigated the efficacy and safety of BGS in the treatment of ulcerative colitis. METHODS: Twelve patients with mildly to moderately active ulcerative colitis received orally 4.5 g of BGS daily for 4 wk in an open-label treatment protocol while the baseline anti-inflammatory therapy was continued. The response to treatment was evaluated clinically and endoscopically. Concentrations of short-chain fatty acids and the composition of commensal bacteria, including Bifidobacteria, Enterobacteria and Bacteroides species, were studied in stool samples. RESULTS: Patients showed improvement in their clinical activity index scores, with a significant decrease in the score from 7.4 +/- 2.8 to 4.7 +/- 1.5 (mean +/- standard error of the mean, P < 0.01). The endoscopic index score decreased from 4.4 +/- 1.7 to 2.8 +/- 1.8 (P < 0.05) with treatment. Patients showed an increase in stool butyrate concentrations after BGS treatment (P < 0.05). There were no significant changes in stool levels of bacteria as a result of BGS treatment. No side effects related to BGS were observed. CONCLUSIONS: Oral BGS therapy may represent a non-toxic way to treat ulcerative colitis. However, controlled studies are needed to demonstrate its efficacy in the treatment of this disorder.},

METHODS: We obtained genomic DNA from 164 subjects, 82 with long-standing IBD aged 8 to 18 years: 46 with Crohn disease (CD) and 36 with ulcerative colitis (UC). Eighty-two healthy children served as the control population. Genotyping was determined by using a restriction enzyme-based assay. TNF-alpha 308 G-->A polymorphism was assessed in terms of inflammatory (C-reactive protein [CRP]) and disease activity. The latter was assessed by the Pediatric Crohn's Disease Activity Index (PCDAI) and the Truelove index for CD and UC, respectively. RESULTS: Significant differences in TNF-alpha 308 A polymorphism were found between the IBD group and controls (P < 0.05) and the UC group and controls (P < 0.001). No differences were noted between TNF-alpha 308 A polymorphism and clinical characteristics in UC. The frequency of the -308 A allele of TNF was not different in CD compared with that in the control group. The frequency of TNF-alpha 308 A genotype was significantly higher in CD patients with predominantly stenosing/penetrating disease compared with patients without complications (P < 0.001) and healthy controls (P < 0.01). In CD patients, those carrying TNF -308 A had a significant increase in CRP (P < 0.05) and the PCDAI (P < 0.05). In CD, CRP levels strongly correlated with the PCDAI (r = 0.6150, P < 0.001). In UC, significant differences among the mean levels of CRP (P < 0.05) and disease activity (P < 0.001) related to TNF-alpha 308 A polymorphism were found. Allele distribution (odds ratio, 12.9; CI, 1.18-140.81, P < 0.001) and CRP serum levels (odds ratio, 1.020; CI, 1.00-1.04, P < 0.001) were independently associated with CD complications. CONCLUSIONS: Although not necessarily dictating IBD initiation, the TNF-alpha 308 A polymorphism may play a role in modifying the CD phenotype. The polymorphism may influence disease activity as well as more intense inflammatory activity in both forms of IBD and may modify the progression of chronic digestive tract inflammation.},

   abstract = {BACKGROUND: Chronic enterocolitis is rare in infancy and accounts for less than 0.5% of all newly diagnosed inflammatory bowel disease (IBD) in the UK. Presentation at this young age is usually indicative of underlying immunodeficiency/immunodysregulation. A group of such infants suffer intractable ulcerating enterocolitis of infancy (IE) in which there is a pan-enteritis with marked oro-anal involvement and deep flask like mucosal ulcers throughout the colon. METHODS: Retrospective review of presenting features, treatment and long-term outcome in a series of 8 children with typical IE. RESULTS: The 8 children were aged between 1 and 4 weeks at onset (median 2 weeks, mean 2.3 weeks), of which 7 were followed up for 2-22 years (median 7.5 years, mean 11 years). All 8 children had an intractable disease course requiring a colectomy for control of symptoms. The median age at colectomy was 1.7 years (range 4 months-4 years). Three children developed a generalised lymphadenopathy due to uncontrolled EBV-related lymphoid proliferations (ages 4, 12, 18). These comprised a monomorphous B-lymphoycte lympho-proliferative disorder, a large pleomorphic follicular lymphoma, and a high grade pleomorphic B cell non-Hodgkin's lymphoma. CONCLUSIONS: Infants with IE have a high risk of developing lymphomatous proliferations that appears to be related to the underlying immunodysregulation. Use of aggressive immunosuppression and acquisition of EBV infection appears to accelerate this process; hence we advocate early colectomy in confirmed cases. In children with IE screening for EBV and vigilance for abnormal lymphoid proliferations is paramount.},

   abstract = {BACKGROUND & AIMS: Colectomy is a potentially life-saving procedure for patients with severe attacks of UC who fail medical therapy. We aimed to systematically review studies that reported the short-term colectomy rate in severe UC or reported variables that could predict treatment failure. METHODS: We conducted a systematic literature search for cohort studies and controlled trials published between 1974-2006. RESULTS: Thirty-two studies met the inclusion criteria; 16 reported short-term outcome and predictors of therapy failure, 13 only outcome, and 3 only predictors. In the pooled analysis, 581 of 1991 patients required colectomy (weighted mean 27; 95% confidence interval [CI], 26%-28%), and 22 died (1%; 95% CI, 0.7%-1.5%). In a heterogeneity-controlled meta-regression, colectomy rate did not change during the last 30 years (R(2) = 0.07, P = .8). Cyclosporine was used in only 100 patients, with a 51% (95% CI, 41%-60%) short-term success rate. A second meta-regression failed to demonstrate a dose-colectomy response of methylprednisolone therapy beyond 60 mg daily (R(2) < 0.01, P = .98). More than 20 variables were identified in 19 studies to predict medical therapy failure, but only a few were consistently reproduced: disease extent, stool frequency, temperature, heart rate, C-reactive protein, albumin, and radiologic assessment. CONCLUSIONS: The short-term colectomy rate in severe UC has remained stable during the last 30 years, despite the introduction of cyclosporine, which was not used frequently. We could not find any support for administering methylprednisolone at a higher dose than 60 mg/day. Variables that predict outcome of corticosteroid therapy could aid in the development of guidelines for introduction of rescue therapies in severe UC.},

   abstract = {Inflammatory bowel disease (IBD) predominantly affects the gastrointestinal system but it is associated with a large number of extraintestinal manifestations (EIM). These extraintestinal disorders can significantly contribute to morbidity and impair the overall life quality. EIM may be diagnosed before, concurrently with, or after the diagnosis of IBD is made. The precise etiology of EIM remains unknown. It currently is believed that mucosa from the underlying bowel disease may provide associated immune responses for the inflammatory process in the extraintestinal sites. The involvement of autoimmune mechanisms has been suggested when the shared and unique epitopes in the human colon, eye, joint and biliary epithelium were detected. Recently, the presence of long-lived populations of memory lymphocytes has been discovered which arise as a consequence of bowel inflammation and express homing receptors that direct their migration not only to the gut but also to the extraintestinal sites. The most common extraintestinal disorders associated with IBD include dermatologic, ophthalmologic, musculoskeletal and hepatobiliary diseases, although virtually every organ system may be involved. If these disorders can be considered as the real extraintestinal manifestations of IBD or represent just association between different syndromes of autoimmune etiology, is still not clear. It is important to acquire knowledge on these extraintestinal manifestations of Crohn's disease and ulcerative colitis to start the respective treatment early.},

CLINICAL CASE: A 25 years old female patient treated with high-dose corticosteroids for 7 months for ulcerative colitis presents with both knees pain and limited hip and knee motility. In a plain X-ray and in nuclear magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) avascular necrosis was observed at these joints. Bone densitometry showed osteopenia at the femoral head and lumbar osteoporosis. DISCUSSION: We present a striking case for its large involvement of the joints (both knees and hips) with simultaneous osteoporosis and osteopenia in a young patient treated with corticosteroids for ulcerative colitis. It is necessary to recommend the judicious use of glucocorticoids, prescribing the minimal necessary dose and for the least amount of time necessary to control the underlying disease.},

   abstract = {BACKGROUND: Children and adolescents suffering from inflammatory bowel disease (IBD) are at risk of developing osteoporosis as a result of treatment with corticosteroids as well as of nonsteroidal factors like inflammation and malnutrition. To study the impact of these factors on development of osteopathy, we compared the rate of osteoporosis in steroid-naive and steroid-treated pediatric IBD patients. METHODS: In 90 patients (50 girls) with IBD (34 steroid-naive, 53 steroid-treated, 3 not known) aged 8.8 to 19.2 (14.4 +/- 2.2) years and 52 controls (27 girls) aged 6.1 to 17.6 (12.9 +/- 3.0) years, bone mineral density (BMD) of the lumbar spine was assessed with dual energy x-ray absorptiometry. Areal BMD values were transformed into volumetric densities called bone mineral apparent density (BMAD) and expressed as standard deviation scores (SDS) on the basis of the BMAD values of the controls. RESULTS: The rate of osteoporotic patients (BMAD-SDS < -2) was 8% in girls and 20% in boys. There was a similar proportion of osteoporosis in steroid-naive (12%) and steroid-treated (11%) patients. SDS of body height showed a significant positive correlation with BMD-SDS but not with BMAD-SDS in almost all patient subgroups, indicating an interfering dependency of BMD from bone size. CONCLUSIONS: The prevalence of osteoporosis in pediatric patients with IBD is approximately the same as in adult patients. Osteoporosis is already present before steroid treatment. Data of dual energy x-ray absorptiometry measurements should be transformed into volumetric parameters to compensate for short stature. Otherwise, a lot of growth-stunted patients may be falsely diagnosed as osteopenic.},

   abstract = {BACKGROUND: Intravenous cyclosporine is active in 60% to 80% of patients with ulcerative colitis (UC) who failed to respond to intravenous corticosteroids. Several studies have suggested that cyclosporine in microemulsion form (Neoral) has some efficacy in this setting, but the optimal dose, blood level, time to response, and remission need to be better defined. The aim of this study was to evaluate the response to Neoral and its toxicity in active corticosteroid-refractory UC. METHODS: Between March 2002 and August 2005, 20 courses of Neoral [initial dose, 2.3 mg/kg (range, 1.8 to 2.8 mg/kg) every 12 hours] were prescribed in 19 consecutive patients for a UC attack that did not respond to intravenous methylprednisolone. All patients received prophylaxis against Pneumocystis carinii. RESULTS: Response was obtained in 17 of 20 attacks (85%) after 3.5 days (range, 1 to 7). Remission was obtained in 15 of 20 attacks (75%) after 13 days (range, 2 to 30 days). Four responders relapsed and underwent colectomy 21 to 900 days after the start of Neoral. Overall, 14 of 19 patients (74%) were colectomy free after a median follow-up of 8 months (range, 1 to 41 months). Cyclosporine blood levels were measured at fasting (C0) and 2 hours after Neoral administration (C2) in a subgroup of 10 responders. The results were 103 ng/mL (range, 32 to 240 ng/mL) for C0 and 761 ng/mL (183 to 1390 ng/mL) for C2. One severe bedridden patient with neonatal encephalopathy died. Main side effects observed were mild transient renal impairment (n = 2), hypertension (n = 1), cytomegalovirus infection (n = 2), and esophageal candidiasis (n = 1). CONCLUSIONS: In active corticosteroid-refractory UC, Neoral seems to have the same efficacy and toxicity as the intravenous form. Trough target cyclosporine blood levels should not exceed 100 ng/mL for C0 and 700 ng/mL for C2.},

METHODS: Data were extracted retrospectively from medical records and obtained by mailed questionnaire. RESULTS: Thirty patients (18 girls) with a median age of 15 years (range, 7-17 years) were identified. Two patients (7%) had the J-pouch removed because of intractable diarrhea. Twenty-seven of 28 patients with preserved J-pouch answered the questionnaire. The median follow-up was 3.7 years (range, 0.3-9.2 years). Surgical complications included eight of 30 patients (27%) with small bowel obstruction, one of 30 (4%) with intra-abdominal abscess and two of 30 (7%) with perforation of the small intestine. The median number of daytime bowel movements was six (range, 3-10) and the median number of nighttime bowel movements was one (range, 0-2). Twelve patients (44%) were completely continent for stool and mucus, 12 patients (44%) leaked now and then and three (12%) leaked often or always. Antibiotic treatment for pouchitis was given in 13 patients (48%). Seventeen patients (63%) were completely satisfied with the operation, nine patients (33%) found the result fairly good and one patient (4%) was not satisfied. Twenty-six patients (96%) reported their health as completely or fairly good. CONCLUSIONS: The majority of patients with an intact J-pouch had an acceptable functional result with respect to defecation frequency, continence and number of pouchitis episodes. Most patients reported being satisfied with the procedure.},

METHODS: Ninety Mexican mestizo patients (45 females) with UC, confirmed by biopsy, were studied. High resolution HLA typing was performed by PCR-SSO reverse dot blot and PCR-SSP. Molecular typing techniques were applied to define HLA-DRB1 alleles. Enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay and immunofluorescence techniques were used to detect p-ANCA. RESULTS: Forty-eight (53%) UC patients were positive for p-ANCA by ELISA and IF. We found that p-ANCA-positive UC patients had a significantly increased frequency of HLA-DR7 compared with p-ANCA-negative controls (22% vs 5.1%; pC=0.02, OR=5.2, CI 95%: 1.06-37.82). Disease activity was scored as severe in 20 patients, moderate in 8, mild in 14 and no activity in the remaining 38 patients according to the Truelove and Witts criteria. Subgroup analysis showed a significantly increased frequency of the HLA-DRB1*07 allele in 15 of 20 UC patients with severe activity of UC and p-ANCA positivity [100% vs 0%; pC=0.0000001; OR=35]. No significant differences were found between p-ANCA positive patients, HLA-DR alleles and other clinical features such as extraintestinal manifestations, proctocolectomy and extension. CONCLUSION: The HLA-DRB1*07 is associated with p-ANCA positive UC Mexican patients.},

This article specifically reviews clinical features, extra-intestinal manifestations, complications, diagnosis and differential diagnosis, and medical treatment of UC. Compared to patients in Western countries, more mild to moderate and left-sided colitis cases were observed in a nation-wide study in China. Complications included anal fistula, anal abscess, anal fissure, severe bleeding, intestinal perforation, intestinal obstruction and colonic carcinoma. The extra-intestinal manifestations were arthritis/arthralgia, eye and skin disorders and oral ulcers. The high specificity of antineutrophil cytoplasmic antibody may useful for distinguishing UC from infectious colitis; in addition, serum levels of anti-saccharomyces cerevisiae antibody may be helpful for distinguishing between UC and CD. Oral sulfasalazine and 5-aminosalicylic acid (ASA) remain the mainstays for the management of mild to moderate UC in China. Corticosteroids and immunosuppressive agents are also widely used in severe or refractory UC.},

MATERIALS AND METHODS: A case-control study was conducted in the Department of Gastroenterology, Kaunas University of Medicine Hospital. A total of 101 patients with ulcerative colitis, 44 with Crohn's disease, and 178 healthy controls were examined with the help of standard self-report questionnaire about daily dietary habits. Healthy controls were evaluated in primary care centers during preventive examinations. Body mass index was calculated for all patients in a standard way. RESULTS: There was no statistically significant difference between patients and controls concerning consumption of coffee, tea, chewing gum, type of fat for meal preparation, white bread, cooked potatoes and sausages, non-carbonated water. Patients with inflammatory bowel diseases statistically significantly less frequently consumed fresh milk, cheese, fish, fried potatoes, and soda drinks. Patients with Crohn's disease statistically significantly less frequently consumed fresh fruits and patients with ulcerative colitis--fresh vegetables as compared to controls. Body mass index of patients with inflammatory bowel diseases was significantly lower compared to controls, and patients with Crohn's disease had significantly lower body mass index than ulcerative colitis patients. CONCLUSIONS: Patients with inflammatory bowel diseases have lower body mass index than healthy controls. Patients consume fresh milk, cheese, canned and fresh vegetables and fruits less frequently; therefore, primary care physicians and patients should be provided with teaching and more information about nutrition issues.},
