   abstract = {INTRODUCTION: Corticoid administration is the usual treatment of Crohns disease (CD) and ulcerative colitis (UC) attacks. However, information available on response rates and their predictive factors is scarce. OBJECTIVE: To establish response to steroidal treatment in an homogeneous group of patients with CD or UC during their first admission to hospital. METHODS: Restrospective analysis of 86 patients who received systemic steroidal treatment for a severe flare-up during their first hospital admission between 1995 and 2000. Patients were treated per protocol with fluid therapy, absolute diet, IV 6-methyl-prednisolone 1 mg/kg/day, and enoxaparin at prophylactic doses. Clinical response at 30 days was considered good in case of complete remission, and poor in case of partial or absent remission. Univariate and multivariate analyses according to non-parametric statistics were performed for sociodemographic and biologic variables. RESULTS: 45 patients with CD and 41 with UC were included. Good response rates were 64.4% for CD and 60.9% for UC. The univariate analysis showed that patients with good response have shorter evolution times and fewer previous flare-ups (p < 0.05) regarding CD. However, the multivariate analysis showed that none of the analyzed variables had predictive value. CONCLUSION: The response rate of severe inflammatory bowel disease attacks to corticoids is around 60% in CD and UC. Data resulting from the current study cannot predict which patients will ultimately respond to therapy.},

This study was designed to evaluate the effects of vitamin E and selenium supplementations on tissue injury and oxidative stress in trinitrobenzenesulfonic acid-induced ulcerative colitis in rats. Trinitrobenzenesulfonic acid administration severely changed the normal architecture of the colon and significantly increased the levels of malondialdehyde, protein carbonyl, and xantine oxidase (P < 0.001) in the colon homogenates of these rats. Supplementation of selenium to the trinitrobenzenesulfonic acid-treated rats neither improved the histopathological findings nor decreased the levels of malondialdehyde and protein carbonyl. Vitamin E supplementation reduced the levels of malondialdehyde and protein carbonyl but did not improve the colonic lesions. Supplementation of vitamin E + selenium significantly reduced both the severity of colonic lesions and the levels of malondialdehyde and protein carbonyl. In conclusion, we suggest that antioxidants and specific micronutrients may have beneficial effects in the treatment of ulcerative colitis.},

   abstract = {The abundance of the oligopeptide transporter (Pept-1) in the brush-border membrane of the intestinal epithelium is the central mechanism for regulation of transport of products of protein digestion (dipeptides and tripeptides) and peptidomimetic drugs (for example, beta-lactam antibiotics). Within the past few years, there has been substantial progress in identifying the factors controlling this regulation and the mechanisms of their actions. The purpose of this report is to review this progress. The studies of individual substrates and hormones in a human intestinal cell line (Caco-2) have shown that dipeptides, certain amino acids, insulin, and leptin increase and epidermal growth factor and triiodothyronine decrease the membrane population of Pept-1. In the case of dipeptides, epidermal growth factor, and thyroid hormone, there are parallel changes in the gene expression brought about by alteration of transcription and/or stability of Pept-1 mRNA. In contrast, the treatment with insulin and leptin does not induce any alteration in the Pept-1 gene expression, and the mechanism of increased protein expression appears to be increased trafficking from a preformed cytoplasmic pool to the apical membrane. In vivo studies in rats have shown modulation of protein and gene expressions of the intestinal oligopeptide transporter during the day and during development and in nutritional and metabolic alterations, such as high-protein diet, fasting, and diabetes. Patients with intestinal diseases, such as ulcerative colitis, Crohn's disease, and short-bowel syndrome, may have induction of the Pept-1 expression in their colon. Finally, pharmacological studies have shown that the expression of Pept-1 can be upregulated by agents such as 5 fluorouracil and downregulated by agents such as cyclosporine. In conclusion, the above studies have produced a wealth of new information on regulation of a key transporter in the intestine. This information may have useful applications in nutritional and pharmacological treatments, for example, in diabetic patients needing enteral nutrition or in ulcerative colitis patients needing the suppression of the intestinal inflammation.},

In the present study, we investigated the effects of the free radical scavenger edaravone, which is used clinically as an anti-stroke agent, in the development of experimental dextran sulfate sodium (DSS)-induced colitis in rats. The rats were fed 4% (w/w of diet) DSS in standard powder chow for 8 days. The edaravone and vehicle saline were injected subcutaneously twice a day. After the experimental period, the wet colonic weight, macroscopic mucosal damaged area, histological damage score, mucosal myeloperoxidase (MPO) activity, mucosal tissue lipid peroxidate and serum interleukin-6 (IL-6) levels were measured. In the DSS-induced colitis model, edaravone treatment (1-20 mg/kg day) significantly reduced the wet colonic weight, macroscopic damaged area, and the histological damage score. Edaravone treatment also reduced mucosal MPO activity, mucosal tissue lipid peroxidate level and serum IL-6 level. In particular, edaravone at a dose of 20 mg/kg day significantly reduced mucosal MPO activity and serum IL-6 level. These results strongly support the involvement of ROS in the pathogenesis of DSS-induced colitis. A clinical effect for edaravone against IBD patients is strongly expected.},

In a previous study, we demonstrated that Clostridium butyricum produces high levels of SCFAs in culture. In addition, a yogurt-based additive effectively masked, completely eliminating the unpleasant odor derived from the SCFAs. We recently reported that the oral administration of both high and low dose diets (50% w/w for 17 days and 5% w/w for 16 months, respectively) of the Clostridium butyricum derivative did not cause pathological abnormalities in rats. In the present study, we evaluated the effects of this product against dextran sulfate sodium (DSS)-induced experimental colitis in rats. Five-week-old male Wistar Hannover GALAS rats were given a mixture of a standard diet containing 3% (w/w) of DSS for 8 days. In the derivative-fed group, Clostridium butyricum derivative (20% w/w) with 0.1% (w/w) additive was also added to their diet. The control-fed group was given tap water (20% w/w) with 0.1% (w/w) additive. After 8 days, a laparotomy was performed, and macroscopic and microscopic inflammation scoring was determined. The Clostridium butyricum derivative effectively prevented bloody diarrhea. In addition, mucosal damage to the derivative-fed group was significantly reduced macroscopically compared to that of the control-fed group. The potential clinical efficacy of the Clostridium butyricum derivative in IBD patients is also discussed.},

   abstract = {BACKGROUND: Rheumatic joint pain is a common extra-intestinal complication of inflammatory bowel disease (IBD). Because the high ratio of n-6 to n-3 fatty acids (FAs) of the Western diet might promote rheumatic disorders, we sought to compare the effects of short-term duodenal administration of n-3-rich seal oil and n-6-rich soy oil on IBD-related joint pain. METHODS: Nineteen patients with IBD-related joint pain were included in the study; 9 had Crohn disease and 10 had ulcerative colitis. Ten millilitres seal oil (n = 10) or soy oil (n = 9) was self-administered through a nasoduodenal feeding tube 3 times daily for 10 days. RESULTS: Compared with soy oil treatment, seal oil significantly reduced the duration of morning stiffness (P = 0.024), number of tender joints (P = 0.035), intensity of pain (P = 0.025) and the doctor's scoring of rheumatic disease activity (P = 0.025) at the end of the 10-day treatment period. Analysis of the effects as area under the curve (area between the curve and baseline, zero) for the entire period from start of treatment until 6 months' post-treatment suggested a long-lasting beneficial effect of seal oil administration on joint pain, whereas soy oil tended (not significantly) to aggravate the condition. Consistently, the serum ratios of n-6 to n-3 FAs (P < 0.01) and arachidonic acid to eicosapentaenoic acid (P < 0.01) were reduced after treatment with seal oil. CONCLUSION: The results suggest distinctive, differential prolonged effects on IBD-related joint pain of short-term duodenal administration of n-3-rich seal oil (significant improvement) and n-6-rich soy oil (tendency to exacerbation).},

   abstract = {Therapeutic interventions in the case of gastrointestinal disease are based on the understanding of the role of different inflammatory mediators. Reactive O2 and N2 metabolites are involved in IBD. Pro-inflammatory cytokines, apoptosis signalling and redox-response transcription factors are depended on free radicals. NO activates COX enzymes. PGE2 negatively modulates induction of NO synthase by interleukins and therefore regulation of gastric mucosal integrity by endogenous NO depends on arachidonic acid cascade. PG-s have pro-inflammatory and anti-inflammatory effects on the immune system. Dietary PUFA-s and eicosanoids have potential effects on the modulation of inflammatory processes and immune cells. The cholesterol level lowering activity of several cytokines and colony stimulating factor can be observed. Therapeutic efficacy of N-3 PUFA is described in cases of patients with chronic gastrointestinal disorders, but N-3 PUFA-s only delay early relapse of ulcerative colitis in remission. TNF is known as a pleiotropic cytokine. Strategies for TNF in IBD is very important part of therapeutical approaches. Therapy with infliximab and related ones are encouraging in critical cases. It is also believed recently, that NF-kappaB also may be a target of IBD treatment. It became known, that oxidized LDL can inhibit LPS-induced binding of the NF-kappaB to DNA and the subsequent expression of TNF-alpha and interleukin-1beta in macrophages as well as oxidized LDL modulates activation of NF-kappaB in mononuclear phagocytes by altering the degradation of I-kappaBs. 15-d-PGJ2 inhibits multiple steps in the NF-kappaB signaling pathway. 15-d-PGJ2 metabolite binds PPAR-gamma promotes adipocyte differentiation. PPAR-gamma ligand inhibits growth of cells through induction of apoptosis. Several nutritional polyphenols (the secondary metabolites of plants) are COX2 and/or LOX inhibitors and iNOS activators. The moderate nutritional customs with natural antioxidants can help restore to normal function of gastrointestinal tract, but the immoderate consumption of vitamins and polyphenol type antioxidant molecules is contraindicated.},

They have been used for centuries in the form of dairy-based fermented products, but the potential use of probiotics as a form of medical nutrition therapy has not received formal recognition. A detailed literature review (from 1950 through February 2004) of English-language articles was undertaken to find articles showing a relationship between probiotic use and medical conditions. Medical conditions that have been reportedly treated or have the potential to be treated with probiotics include diarrhea, gastroenteritis, irritable bowel syndrome, and inflammatory bowel disease (Crohn's disease and ulcerative colitis), cancer, depressed immune function, inadequate lactase digestion, infant allergies, failure-to-thrive, hyperlipidemia, hepatic diseases, Helicobacter pylori infections, genitourinary tract infections, and others. The use of probiotics should be further investigated for possible benefits and side-effects in patients affected by these medical conditions.},

   abstract = {For the past 30 years there has been a steady increase in our knowledge of the sources, uses and physiological effects of resistant starch. However, it has only been in the past decade that the use of ingredients with a high resistant starch content has occurred in foods, initially in Australia but now throughout the world. Foods containing these resistant starch-rich ingredients include not only staple foods, such as bread and breakfast cereals, but also foods designed for those with special physiological or medical needs, such as celiac sensitivity and ulcerative colitis, or for individuals who are seeking to manage energy intake and control weight. Resistant starch has other benefits when compared with traditional sources of dietary fiber in that the preparation and design of foods with additional health benefits have the appearance, taste, and texture characteristics that encourage people to consume these "better for you" foods. As our knowledge of the range of physiological effects that occur through the consumption of resistant starch increases, more applications will be found for their inclusion in an expanding range of foods around the world.},

The interleukin (IL) 2- and beta(2)-microglobulin (beta(2)m)-deficient (IL-2(null) x beta(2)m(null)) mice spontaneously develop colon cancer in the setting of chronic UC. This study investigated the effects of dietary folate on the development of UC-associated colon cancer in the IL-2(null) x beta(2)m(null) mice. Weaning IL-2(null) x beta(2)m(null) mice were randomized to receive 0 (deficient; n = 40), 2 (basal requirement; control; n = 46), or 8 (supplemented; n = 36) mg folate/kg diet for 32 weeks. At necropsy, all macroscopic colonic tumors were identified and histologically classified as dysplasia or adenocarcinoma. The incidence of high-grade lesions (high-grade dysplasia/carcinoma in situ and invasive adenocarcinoma) in the folate-supplemented group was 46% lower than that in the control group (35.3% versus 65.1%, P = 0.009). The incidence of high-grade lesions in the folate-deficient group was also 49% lower than that in the control group (33.3% versus 65.1%, P = 0.007). The higher mortality rate in the folate-deficient group compared with the other two groups (25% versus 6.5% and 5.6%, P < 0.02) partially accounted for the low incidence of high-grade lesions in this group. These data indicate that dietary folate supplementation at 4x the basal dietary requirement significantly suppresses UC-associated colorectal carcinogenesis in the IL-2(null) x beta(2)m(null) mice. These data also suggest that folate deficiency may inhibit colorectal carcinogenesis in chronic UC. However, the high mortality observed in the folate-deficient group precludes a definitive conclusion concerning the effect of folate deficiency on UC-associated colorectal carcinogenesis in this model.},

   abstract = {In the inflammatory bowel diseases (IBD) that affect dogs and cats there appears to be dysregulation of normal mucosal immunity, characterised by polyclonal lymphocytic infiltrates which are presumably specific for luminal antigens. There is an absence of a classical polarisation of either T-helper (Th) 1 or Th2 cytokine responses, although increased expression of mRNA for interleukin (IL) 2 and IL-12p40 and a shift towards mucosal immunoglobulin (Ig) G production are consistent findings, whilst variable responses are seen in tumour necrosis factor-alpha (TNF-alpha), IL-1, IL-4, IL-6, and interferon-gamma (IFN-gamma). Increased mucosal permeability and deranged intestinal motility are common sequelae. Despite obvious similarities with Crohn's disease and ulcerative colitis in humans, important differences exist. Of these, the diffuse superficial nature but with no Th1 or Th2 bias, and the prevalence of proximal small intestinal disease are notable. Potential hypotheses for these disparities include specific differences in the types or locations of agonistic gut flora, diffuse abnormalities in microbial-host interactions, a greater importance of diet, or anatomical or cellular differences in mucosal immune responses. Although specific pathogens and genetic susceptibilities may be involved, quantitative or qualitative changes in the normal flora or abnormal responses to a normal flora are more likely to be involved in the immunopathogenesis. Dietary influences include a large source of antigen, promotion of abnormal microbial growth through Maillard compounds within canned diets, and specific macro- and micronutrient deficiencies. Although dependent on a histopathological diagnosis, limitations of biopsies procured endoscopically, lack of histopathological standardisation and difficulty distinguishing inflammation from neoplasia remain significant problems. Clinician-pathologist dialogue, immunohistochemistry, cytokine profiling and lymphocyte clonality assessment may lead to more accurate diagnoses, a deeper understanding of the immunopathogenesis, and ultimately to new therapies or prevention of disease induction.},

The present study examined the effects of psyllium and fat on the enzymes responsible for sphingomyelin metabolism and apoptosis in the colon. Mice were fed control, psyllium-containing (100 g/kg), high-fat (313 g/kg, 53 % energy as fat) or high-fat plus psyllium diets for 4 weeks. The activities of acid, neutral and alkaline sphingomyelinase (SMase), neutral ceramidase, and caspase 3, 8 and 9 in colonic mucosa were determined. The expressions of alkaline SMase and caspase 3 were examined. The psyllium-containing diet was found to increase significantly the activities of alkaline SMase and caspase 3 and decreased those of acid SMase and neutral ceramidase. The high-fat diet had opposite effects on these enzymes and attenuated the effects of psyllium. Western blotting showed that psyllium increased and high-fat decreased the levels of alkaline SMase and caspase 3 in colonic mucosa. The change in caspase 3 activity was positively correlated with that of alkaline SMase and negatively with acid SMase. No similar changes of acid and alkaline phosphatase activities in the colon or acid and neutral SMase activity in the liver were identified. In conclusion, colonic sphingomyelin metabolism and apoptosis were affected by psyllium and fat in an opposite manner. The results may have implications for colorectal tumourigenesis and inflammation.},

   abstract = {BACKGROUND: Eosinophilic gastritis is related to eosinophilic gastroenteritis, varying only in regards to the extent of disease and small bowel involvement. Common symptoms reported are similar to our patient's including: abdominal pain, epigastric pain, anorexia, bloating, weight loss, diarrhea, ankle edema, dysphagia, melaena and postprandial nausea and vomiting. Microscopic features of eosinophilic infiltration usually occur in the lamina propria or submucosa with perivascular aggregates. The disease is likely mediated by eosinophils activated by various cytokines and chemokines. Therapy centers around the use of immunosuppressive agents and dietary therapy if food allergy is a factor. CASE PRESENTATION: The patient is a 31 year old Caucasian female with a past medical history significant for ulcerative colitis. She presented with recurrent bouts of vomiting, abdominal pain and chest discomfort of 11 months duration. The bouts of vomiting had been reoccurring every 7-10 days, with each episode lasting for 1-3 days. This was associated with extreme weakness and cachexia. Gastric biopsies revealed intense eosinophilic infiltration. The patient responded to glucocorticoids and azathioprine. The differential diagnosis and molecular pathogenesis of eosinophilic gastritis as well as the molecular effects of glucocorticoids in eosinophilic disorders are discussed. CONCLUSIONS: The patient responded to a combination of glucocorticosteroids and azathioprine with decreased eosinophilia and symptoms. It is likely that eosinophil-active cytokines such as interleukin-3 (IL-3), granulocyte macrophage colony stimulating factor (GM-CSF) and IL-5 play pivotal roles in this disease. Chemokines such as eotaxin may be involved in eosinophil recruitment. These mediators are downregulated or inhibited by the use of immunosuppressive medications.},

   abstract = {BACKGROUND: Patients with ulcerative colitis (UC) are at greater risk of developing colorectal cancer (CRC) than the general population. Both duration and extent of UC are important risk factors for CRC, as is the presence of primary sclerosing cholangitis, family history of CRC, and (in some studies) early age at diagnosis of UC. Efforts to reduce this risk have focused on colonoscopic surveillance as the best alternative to the more definitive, but less appealing, approach of prophylactic colectomy. However, spurred on by findings in the sporadic CRC literature, there has been a growing interest in a possible role for chemoprevention of CRC in patients with UC. EMPIRICAL STUDIES: Published evidence to date indicates that 5-aminosalicylic acid agents are protective against the development of dysplasia and CRC. Oral, but not topical, steroids also appear to be chemoprotective, but their chronic use cannot be recommended for this indication. Ursodeoxycholic acid has been shown to reduce the risk of neoplasia in UC patients with primary sclerosing cholangitis. Evidence suggests, but does not prove, that folic acid is chemopreventive in patients with UC. Further studies are needed to fully define the chemoprotective role of these and other agents.},

   abstract = {Environmental factors are essential components of the pathogenesis of inflammatory bowel disease (IBD) and primarily responsible for its growing incidence around the globe. Epidemiological, clinical and experimental evidence support an association between IBD and a large number of seemingly unrelated environmental factors, which include smoking, diet, drugs, geographical and social status, stress, microbial agents, intestinal permeability and appendectomy. Data supporting the involvement of each of these factors in predisposing to, triggering, or modulating the course or outcome of IBD vary from strong to tenuous. Smoking and the enteric bacterial flora are the ones for which the most solid evidence is currently available. Smoking increases the risk of Crohn's disease (CD) and worsens its clinical course, but has a protective effect in ulcerative colitis (UC). Presence of enteric bacteria is indispensable to develop gut inflammation in most animal models of IBD, and modulation of the quantity or quality of the flora can be beneficial in patients with IBD. Surprisingly, evidence for a major role of the diet in inducing or modifying IBD is limited, while that for nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drugs is more convincing than for oral contraceptives. Northern geographic location, and a high social, economical, educational or occupational status increase the risk of IBD, an observation fitting the hygiene hypothesis for allergic and autoimmune diseases. Stress is also associated with IBD, but more as a modifier than an inducing factor, and its contribution is more obvious in IBD animal models than human IBD. Finally, an increased intestinal permeability may increase the risk for developing CD, whereas an appendectomy lowers the risk of developing UC.},

   abstract = {There is increasing evidence that hydrogen sulfide (H2S), produced by intestinal sulfate-reducing bacteria (SRB), may be involved in the etiopathogenesis of chronic diseases such as ulcerative colitis and colorectal cancer. The activity of SRB, and thus H2S production, is likely determined by the availability of sulfur-containing compounds in the intestine. However, little is known about the impact of dietary or inorganic sulfate on intestinal sulfate and SRB-derived H2S concentrations. In this study, the effects of short-term (7 day) and long-term (1 year) inorganic sulfate supplementation of the drinking water on gastrointestinal (GI) sulfate and H2S concentrations (and thus activity of resident SRBs), and the density of large intestinal sulfomucin-containing goblet cells, were examined in C3H/HeJBir mice. Additionally, a PCR-denaturing gradient gel electrophoresis (DGGE)-based molecular ecology technique was used to examine the impact of sulfate-amended drinking water on microbial community structure throughout the GI tract. Average H2S concentrations ranged from 0.1 mM (stomach) to 1 mM (cecum). A sulfate reduction assay demonstrated in situ production of H2S throughout the GI tract, confirming the presence of SRB. However, H2S generation and concentrations were greatest in the cecum and colon. Sulfate supplementation of drinking water did not significantly increase intestinal sulfate or H2S concentrations, suggesting that inorganic sulfate is not an important modulator of intestinal H2S concentrations, although it altered the bacterial profiles of the stomach and distal colon of 1-year-old mice. This change in colonic bacterial profiles may reflect a corresponding increase in the density of sulfomucin-containing goblet cells in sulfate-supplemented compared with control mice.},

   abstract = {A number of neurological symptoms have been described as complications of inflammatory bowel disorders such as coeliac disease, Whipple's disease, Crohn's disease and ulcerative colitis. The neurology of coeliac disease includes disorders of the central nervous system encompassing cerebellar ataxia, epilepsy, myoclonus, dementia and multifocal leukoencephalopathy. Peripheral neuropathies, of axonal and demyelinating types, and myopathies have also been reported. The pathomechanisms are more related to immunological-inflammatory processes than to a malresorptive vitamin deficiencies. While CNS symptoms of coeliac disease show a poor response to gluten restriction, peripheral symptoms may respond to elimination of gluten from the diet. There are few reports of a successful corticosteroid treatment in patients showing inflammatory findings in the CSF or bioptic material. Whipple's disease is caused by the gram-positive bacillus Tropheryma whipplei. Patients with a central nervous system manifestation of Whipple's disease may develop a variety of symptoms including dementia, supranuclear gaze palsy, movement disorders, hypothalamic dysfunction and myorhythmia. The CNS-infection is diagnosed by PCR of the CSF. Long-term antibiotic treatment is required, and relapses may occur after withdrawal of antimicrobial therapy. Crohn's disease and ulcerative colitis are complicated by various forms of polyneuropathies, and arterial and venous cerebrovascular diseases. In most cases with neurological complications of inflammatory gastrointestinal diseases an immune mediated inflammatory process is suspected to be the underlying pathomechanism.},

There has been a special focus on dietary factors, as well as on other exposures introduced on a population-based level, including fast food, cola drinks, toothpaste, antibiotics and oral contraceptives. The aim of this review is to critically assess the results from the different observational studies that have investigated these hypotheses, and also to propose research agendas that should be pursued in the future. The conclusion is that infectious exposures and early bacterial colonization, which are associated with better hygiene early in life and that influence immune function, and possibly oral contraceptives, remain the only exposures of interest for future research into the aetiology of ulcerative colitis and Crohn's disease.},

   abstract = {The physician treating children with inflammatory bowel disease is confronted with a number of specific problems, one of them being the lack of randomized, controlled drug trials in children. In this review, the role of nutritional therapy is discussed with a focus on primary treatment, especially for children with Crohn's disease. Then, the available medical therapies are highlighted, reviewing the evidence of effectiveness and side effects in children, as compared with what is known in adults. Nutritional therapy has proven to be effective in inducing and maintaining remission in Crohn's disease while promoting linear growth. Conventional treatment consists of aminosalicylates and corticosteroids, whereas the early introduction of immunosuppressives (such as azathioprine or 6-mercaptopurine) is advocated as maintenance treatment. If these drugs are not tolerated or are ineffective, methotrexate may serve as an alternative in Crohn's disease. Cyclosporine is an effective rescue therapy in severe ulcerative colitis, but only will postpone surgery. A novel strategy to treat Crohn's disease is offered by infliximab, a monoclonal antibody to the proinflammatory cytokine tumor necrosis factor (TNF)-alpha. Based on the best-available evidence, suggested usage is provided for separate drugs with respect to dosage and monitoring of side effects in children.},

   abstract = {: Right dorsal colitis (RDC) is an ulcerative inflammatory bowel disorder of the horse that has been associated with the administration of non-steroidal anti-inflammatory drugs (NSAIDs), particularly in horses treated when dehydrated or toxaemic. The acute form of RDC may result in profuse diarrhoea, severe colic, dehydration, endotoxic shock and even death; the chronic form may be manifest by mild to moderate intermittent colic, ventral oedema and weight loss with or without diarrhoea. The most consistent laboratory findings are anaemia, hypoproteinaemia, hypoalbuminaemia and hypocalcaemia. Medical management of RDC requires avoidance of NSAIDs, of stressful experiences and of large-volume diets. Specific medications such as sucralfate and metronidazole have been used to treat RDC in the horse. The use of dietary additions such as psyllium and corn oil has been mentioned in the literature.RDC has not been reported previously in Ireland or Britain; here we report that the condition was diagnosed in three horses in Ireland on the bases of a history of phenylbutazone therapy, clinical signs, clinical pathology and ultrasonography. In two of the three horses the diagnosis was confirmed by direct inspection of the affected colon at celiotomy.},

   abstract = {Nutrients may be involved in the modulation of the immune response through at least three different mechanisms. First, the intestinal ecosystem plays a pivotal role in the pathogenesis of inflammatory bowel disease, triggering the uncontrolled inflammatory response in genetically predisposed individuals. Nutrients, together with bacteria, are major components of, and can therefore influence, the intestinal environment. Second, as components of cell membranes, nutrients can mediate the expression of proteins involved in the immune response, such as cytokines, adhesion molecules and nitric oxide synthase. The composition of lipids in the cell membrane is modified by dietary changes and can influence cellular responses. Indeed, various epidemiological, experimental and clinical data suggest that the immune response may be sensitive to changes in dietary composition. Finally, suboptimal levels of micronutrients are often found in both children and adults with inflammatory bowel disease, although, with the exception of iron and folate, it is unusual to discover symptoms attributable to these deficits. However, subclinical deficits may have a pathophysiological significance, as they may favour the self-perpetuation of the disease (due to defects in the mechanisms of tissue repair), cause defective defence against damage produced by oxygen free radicals and facilitate lipid peroxidation. These events can occur even in clinically inactive or mildly active disease, as well as in the development of dysplasia in the intestinal mucosa. Some dietary manipulations have been attempted as primary treatment for rheumatoid arthritis, and specially formulated diets for enteral nutrition have proved to be an effective treatment for Crohn's disease. Most trials, although lacking sufficient patient numbers, have demonstrated a role for dietary manipulation as primary therapy for inflammatory disease. Dietary lipids are one of the most active nutritional substrates modulating the immune response. Recently, it has been demonstrated that lipids may be a key factor explaining the therapeutic effect of clinical nutrition in Crohn's disease.},

METHODS: A prospectively collected electronic database of all colorectal laparoscopic procedures performed between April 2001 and July 2003 has been used to identify surgical outcomes in 14 consecutive patients who have undergone laparoscopic RPC. RESULTS: Fourteen patients (5 male), median BMI 24 kg/m(2) have undergone restorative laparoscopic proctocolectomy over a two year period: 13 (ulcerative colitis, one with cancer) and 1 (FAP). The median operation time was 260 min; time has not decreased with experience. There were no intra-operative surgical complications or deaths. Patient controlled analgesia continued for a median of 36 h. The median time to diet was 48 h and median hospital stay 7 days; three patients required nasogastric aspiration for delayed gastric emptying. Eighteen regional lymph nodes were retrieved local to the carcinoma. There was one anastomotic leak. All covering stomas were closed by 6 months (12 by eight weeks). All 14 patients are fully continent, able to suppress urgency and have a median pouch frequency of 4/24 h. None admit to having problems with potency, orgasm sensation, ejaculation, micturition. One lady reports dysparunia. All are highly satisfied with functional outcome and cosmesis. CONCLUSION: We are encouraged to continue to offer our patients the option of a laparoscopic resection.},

   abstract = {Major advances in the understanding of the aetio-pathogenesis and genetics of inflammatory bowel disease have been accompanied by an escalation in the sophistication of immunomodulatory inflammatory bowel disease therapeutics. However, the basic 'triple' therapy (5-aminosalicylates, corticosteroids, azathioprine) and nutrition have maintained their central role in the management of patients with inflammatory bowel disease over recent decades. This review provides an overview of the supportive and therapeutic perspectives of nutrition in adult inflammatory bowel disease. The objective of supportive nutrition is to correct malnutrition in terms of calorie intake or specific macro- or micronutrients. Of particular clinical relevance is deficiency in calcium, vitamin D, folate, vitamin B12 and zinc. There is justifiably a growing sense of unease amongst clinicians and patients with regard to the long-term use of corticosteroids in inflammatory bowel disease. This, rather than arguments about efficacy, should be the catalyst for revisiting the use of enteral nutrition as primary treatment in Crohn's disease. Treatment failure is usually related to a failure to comply with enteral nutrition. Potential factors that militate against successful completion of enteral nutrition are feed palatability, inability to stay on a solid-free diet for weeks, social inconvenience and transient feed-related adverse reactions. Actions that can be taken to improve treatment outcome include the provision of good support from dietitians and clinicians for the duration of treatment and the subsequent 'weaning' period. There is evidence to support a gradual return to a normal diet through exclusion-re-introduction or other dietary regimen following the completion of enteral nutrition to increase remission rates. We also review the evidence for emerging therapies, such as glutamine, growth factors and short-chain fatty acids. The future may see the evolution of enteral nutrition into an important therapeutic strategy, and the design of a 'Crohn's disease-specific formulation' that is individually tailored, acceptable to patients, cost-effective, free from adverse side-effects and combines enteral nutrition with novel pre- and pro-biotics and other factors.},

   abstract = {Topical butyrate has been shown to be effective in the treatment of ulcerative colitis (UC). Butyrate is derived from colonic fermentation of dietary fiber, and our aim was to study whether UC patients could safely increase the fecal butyrate level by dietary means. We enrolled 22 patients with quiescent UC (mean age, 44 years; 45% women; median time from last relapse, 1 year) in a controlled pilot trial lasting 3 months. The patients were instructed to add 60 g oat bran (corresponding to 20 g dietary fiber) to the daily diet, mainly as bread slices. Fecal short-chain fatty acids (SCFAs) including butyrate, disease activity, and gastrointestinal symptoms were recorded every 4 weeks. During the oat bran intervention the fecal butyrate concentration increased by 36% at 4 weeks (from 11 +/- 2 (mean +/- SEM) to 15 +/- 2 micromol/g feces) (p < 0.01). The mean butyrate concentration over the entire test period was 14 +/- 1 micromol/g feces (p < 0.05). Remaining fecal SCFA levels were unchanged. No patient showed signs of colitis relapse. Unlike controls, the patients showed no increase in gastrointestinal complaints during the trial. Yet patients reporting abdominal pain and reflux complaints at entry showed significant improvement at 12 weeks that returned to baseline 3 months later. This pilot study shows that patients with quiescent UC can safely take a diet rich in oat bran specifically to increase the fecal butyrate level. This may have clinical implications and warrants studies of the long-term benefits of using oat bran in the maintenance therapy in UC.},

GBF has been shown to reduce both clinical activity and mucosal damage in active ulcerative colitis (UC) with mild to moderate activity. However, the efficacy of GBF in patients with UC during the remission stage is unknown. The aim of this study was to investigate the efficacy of GBF as a maintenance therapy in patients with UC while in remission. Fifty-nine patients with UC in remission according to Rachmilewitz's clinical activity index (CAI) score of </=4 were enrolled and divided into two groups, control (n=37) and GBF (n=22). Patients in the control group were given conventional treatment alone for 12 months, while patients in the GBF group received conventional therapy plus 20 g of GBF daily. The response to treatments was assessed by monitoring the CAI and endoscopic score according to Matts. Significantly better CAI values were seen in the GBF group at 3, 6, and 12 months compared with the values in the control group. The cumulative recurrence rate in the GBF group with steroid tapering treatment was significantly lower compared with the value in the control group. No side effects related to GBF were observed. GBF appeared to be effective and safe as a maintenance therapy to taper steroid dose and prolong remission in patients with UC.},

   abstract = {The gut flora plays a fundamental role in maintaining normal intestinal function. A disturbance of this flora, or the host response to this flora, has been clearly demonstrated to play a role in the pathogenesis of inflammatory bowel disease (IBD). This has led to attempts to modify the bacterial flora with "live non-pathogenic organisms that confer health benefits by improving the microbial balance," otherwise known as probiotics. Recent attention has focused on this potential strategy to treat or prevent IBD. The potential therapeutic benefit is enhanced by the natural and apparently safe approach that probiotics offer. Animal models of colitis have provided the proof of principle that probiotics can prevent and treat established intestinal inflammation. Controlled clinical studies have demonstrated the efficacy of probiotics in the maintenance of remission of pouchitis, prophylaxis of pouchitis after the formation of an ileoanal reservoir, maintenance of remission of ulcerative colitis, and treatment of Crohn's disease. However, large controlled trials are needed to definitively establish the place for probiotics in the treatment of IBD and resolve issues such as the dose, duration, frequency of treatment, and use of single or multiple strains. Research is focusing on establishing the mechanism of action, so that treatments with individually tailored properties are developed and innovative approaches are explored.},

Although the exact cause of ulcerative colitis remains undetermined, the condition appears to be related to a combination of genetic and environmental factors.

This article reviews potential unconventional treatments - transdermal nicotine, heparin, melatonin, DHEA, probiotics, fiber, dietary changes, botanicals, essential fatty acids, and other nutrients - that may be considered in conjunction with conventional approaches or as part of a comprehensive alternative treatment protocol. In addition this review addresses risk factors, pathogenesis, nutrient deficiencies, conventional treatment approaches, and extra-intestinal manifestations of the disease.},

Th present study was undertaken to examine the diagnostic accuracy and clinical significance of ASCA determination in Japanese patients with CD or ulcerative colitis (UC). METHODS: Seventy-five serum samples obtained from 68 patients with CD, 34 serum samples obtained from 30 patients with UC, 35 serum samples from 35 patients with liver cirrhosis, and 31 serum samples from 31 healthy controls were examined. The optical density of each sample was measured by an enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay (ELISA) method to quantify ASCA IgA and IgG. RESULTS: The cutoff level, as determined by discriminant analysis of the data, was 0.1502 for ASCA IgA and 0.156 for ASCA IgG. Of the 68 patients with CD, 31 (45.6%) were ASCA-positive, and of the 30 patients with UC, 4 (13.3%) were ASCA-positive according to these cutoff levels. The sensitivity and specificity of ASCA determination for the differential diagnosis of CD from UC were 45.6% and 86.7%, respectively. When the relationship between ASCA and the clinical features of CD was analyzed, ASCA positivity was found to be correlated with duration of illness. CONCLUSIONS: The specificity of ASCA was high; however, the sensitivity was not. ASCA titers were generally low in the Japanese population examined. It would be desirable to determine cutoff levels for ASCA tailored to the Japanese people for the diagnosis of inflammatory bowel disease.},

In isolated cases of diverse autoimmune diseases (scleroderma, APECED [autoimmune polyendocrinopathy, candidiasis, and ectodermal dystrophy], urticaria or urticarial vasculitis, Reiter or Sjogren syndromes, ulcerative colitis or Crohn's disease, multiple sclerosis or Guillain-Barre syndrome) (n = 14), decreased TG was also observed both in the lean and obese subjects (-59%, P < .01 and -57%, P < .01, respectively). Concerning FFA (n = 69), value in lean patients (n = 22) vs that in lean controls (n = 18) was increased (520 +/- 31 vs 299 +/- 30 mcEq/L, +74%, P < .001), whereas value in obese patients (n = 18) vs that in obese control subjects (n = 11) was decreased (542 +/- 34 vs 774 +/- 62, -30%, P < .01). This opposite behavior of FFA in lean and obese patients needs to be confirmed. Data in this study seem to indicate that low TG value may be a precocious marker of autoimmunity or immune system hyperreactivity.},

   abstract = {BACKGROUND: Alterations of intestinal flora, such as reduction in the concentration of bifidobacteria and increase in that of Bacteroides species, are apparently associated with the severity of ulcerative colitis. OBJECTIVE: We conducted a randomised clinical trial of the use of a bifidobacteria-fermented milk (BFM) supplement as a dietary adjunct in the treatment of ulcerative colitis. METHODS: The subjects were randomly divided into two groups: a group with BFM supplementation (BFM group, 11 subjects) and a control group (control group, 10 subjects). The BFM group was given 100 mL/day of BFM for one year. Colonoscopies, general blood markers and examinations of intestinal flora including the analysis of fecal organic acids were performed at the commencement of the study and after one year. RESULTS: Exacerbation of symptoms was seen in 3 out of 11 subjects in the BFM group and in 9 out of 10 in the control group. Log rank statistic analysis of the cumulative exacerbation rates showed a significant reduction in exacerbations for the BFM group (p = 0.0184). The analysis of microflora and the organic acids in the feces showed a significant reduction in the relative proportion of B. vulgatus in Bacteroidaceae and butyrate concentration, respectively, after supplementation with BFM, in comparison with before. CONCLUSION: Supplementation with the BFM product was successful in maintaining remission and had possible preventive effects on the relapse of ulcerative colitis.},

   abstract = {BACKGROUND AND AIMS: The causes of relapses of ulcerative colitis (UC) are unknown. Dietary factors have been implicated in the pathogenesis of UC. The aim of this study was to determine which dietary factors are associated with an increased risk of relapse of UC. METHODS: A prospective cohort study was performed with UC patients in remission, recruited from two district general hospitals, who were followed for one year to determine the effect of habitual diet on relapse. Relapse was defined using a validated disease activity index. Nutrient intake was assessed using a food frequency questionnaire and categorised into tertiles. Adjusted odds ratios for relapse were determined using multivariate logistic regression, controlling for non-dietary factors. RESULTS: A total of 191 patients were recruited and 96% completed the study. Fifty two per cent of patients relapsed. Consumption of meat (odds ratio (OR) 3.2 (95% confidence intervals (CI) 1.3-7.8)), particularly red and processed meat (OR 5.19 (95% CI 2.1-12.9)), protein (OR 3.00 (95% CI 1.25-7.19)), and alcohol (OR 2.71 (95% CI 1.1-6.67)) in the top tertile of intake increased the likelihood of relapse compared with the bottom tertile of intake. High sulphur (OR 2.76 (95% CI 1.19-6.4)) or sulphate (OR 2.6 (95% CI 1.08-6.3)) intakes were also associated with relapse and may offer an explanation for the observed increased likelihood of relapse. CONCLUSIONS: Potentially modifiable dietary factors, such as a high meat or alcoholic beverage intake, have been identified that are associated with an increased likelihood of relapse for UC patients. Further studies are needed to determine if it is the sulphur compounds within these foods that mediates the likelihood of relapse and if reducing their intake would reduce relapse frequency.},

We wished to determine the nature of and reasons for patients' dietary beliefs and their effect on relapse and nutrient intake. METHODS: In a 1-year prospective cohort study, patients' nutrient intake and disease activity were measured with a validated food frequency questionnaire and disease activity index. Food beliefs, demographics and disease characteristics were recorded. The influence of beliefs on the risk of relapse and nutrient intake were examined using chi-squared and Mann-Whitney U-tests. RESULTS: One hundred and eighty-three patients were studied and 52% relapsed. Sixty-eight per cent held dietary beliefs and reported modifying their intake accordingly. The most common reported behaviour was the avoidance of milk and dairy products. Food beliefs were more common amongst those who had received dietary advice. No reported behaviour reduced the risk of relapse, but patients who avoided dairy products had a significantly lower intake of calcium. Folate intake was below UK recommended levels in 13% of patients. CONCLUSIONS: Patients with ulcerative colitis believe that many foods are harmful or helpful to their disease activity. Commonly held beliefs do not modify the risk of relapse, but do adversely affect nutrient intake.},

   abstract = {Inflammatory bowel syndrome (IBS) mainly includes ulcerative colitis (UC) and Crohn's disease (CD). UC and CD are chronic and recurrent conditions, with a tendency to exacerbations and remissions. The incidence of diseases worldwide has increased over the last years. Although the etiology of inflammatory bowel syndrome has been studied intensively it still remains unclear. The development and persistence of inflammation is an effect of numerous factors: proinflammatory (aggressive), regulating bowel mucosa homeostasis and protective factors. Proinflammatory factors include intestinal bacteria, bile acids, digestive enzymes, lipopolysaccharides and peptidoglycans. Protective mechanisms are impermeability of mucosa barrier, presence of intestinal mucus, activity of secretive immunoglobulins, some prostaglandins and interleukins, glutamine, somatostatin, cortisol and short-chain fatty acids. Factors modifying intestinal mucosa homeostasis consist of genetically determined immunoregulators and activity of intestinal mucosa barrier and some environmental factors (diet, smoking, infections, stress, antibiotics and others). Environmental factors are jointly responsible for IBS occurrence in case of genetically determined dysregulation leading to proinflammatory cytokines overproduction or disturbances in synthesis of cytokines regulating intestinal mucosa homeostasis.},

   abstract = {Because the intestinal microflora play an important role in the development of inflammatory bowel disease (IBD), there is currently some interest in the manipulation of the composition of the microflora towards a potentially more remedial community. This review summarizes the clinical and experimental efficacy of the manipulation of microflora by the use of prebiotics, probiotics, synbiotics, and antibiotics in IBD. Prebiotics, defined as nondigestible food ingredients that beneficially affect the host by selectively stimulating the growth or activity of one or a limited number of bacterial species already resident in the colon, can modulate the colonic microbiota by increasing the number of specific bacteria and thus changing the composition of the microbiota. Prebiotics for IBD include lactosucrose, oligofructose, inulin, bran, psyllium, and germinated barley foodstuff (GBF). GBF, which mainly consists of dietary fiber and glutamine-rich protein, is a prebiotic foodstuff for ulcerative colitis. GBF has shown to be converted into a preferential nutrient for colonocytes through Eubacterium and Bifidobacterium and also inactivate nuclear factor kappa B (NFkB). Moreover, it exhibits a potent water-holding capacity and bile-acid binding capacity. Probiotics, which are microbial food supplements that beneficially affect the host by improving the intestinal microbial balance, have been used to change the composition of colonic microbiota. The approaches for IBD include VSL#3, Nissle1917, Clostridium butyricum and Bifidobacterium-fermented milk. Use of Lactococci secreting IL-10 provides excellent results. The combination of prebiotics and probiotics in a synbiotic has not been studied in IBD but is promising. The use of antibiotics continues to be of interest. Although these strategies hold great promise and appear to be useful in some settings, more clinical study is needed to firmly establish the relevance of these therapies.},

In our previous study, we carried out a clinical trial of GBF with mildly to moderately active UC patients and showed that GBF treatment was able to attenuate the symptoms of UC in a relatively short-term. The aim of this study was to investigate the efficacy of long-term administration of GBF in the treatment of UC in a multi-center open trial. Twenty-one patients with mildly to moderately active UC received 20-30 g of GBF for 24 weeks in an open-label protocol while baseline treatments (5-amino-salicyrate compounds and/or steroids) were continued. The response to the GBF treatment was evaluated using a clinical scoring and after 24 weeks of observation, the GBF group showed a significant decrease in clinical activity index (especially, the degree of visible blood in stools and the presence of nocturnal diarrhea) compared with the control group (p<0.05). No side effects related to GBF were observed. In conclusion, GBF can reduce the clinical activity of UC over long-term as well as short-term administration. Nutraceutical GBF therapy may have a place in long-term management of UC, but controlled studies are needed to demonstrate its efficacy in the treatment of this disorder.},

The aim of this study was to evaluate the anti-inflammatory effects of GBF on colitis in terms of the epithelial inflammatory response. METHODS: Mice with dextran sulfate sodium-induced colitis were used. The effects of GBF on the colitis were evaluated by measuring the body weight; disease activity; mucosal damage (histology, mucosal inflammatory parameters, nuclear factor kappa B [NFkB] activation, and signal transducer and activator of transcription 3 [STAT3]); serum interleukin 6 (IL-6) level; cecal short-chain fatty acids (SCFAs); and bile acid contents. RESULTS: GBF significantly prevented disease activity and body weight loss after induction of colitis. Serum IL-6 level and mucosal STAT3 expression were also significantly attenuated, with a conspicuous reduction of mucosal damage; NFkB activity showed the same tendency. Cecal butyrate content was significantly higher and, interestingly, GBF mice had lower bile acid concentrations than the control group. CONCLUSIONS: GBF has the potential to reduce the epithelial inflammatory response by depressing STAT-3 expression and inhibiting NFkB binding activity. These effects may be brought about by an increase of butyrate production and adsorption of bile acids.},

AIM: To conduct a randomized placebo-controlled trial of bifidobacteria-fermented milk supplementation as a dietary adjunct in treating active ulcerative colitis. METHODS: Twenty patients with mild to moderate, active, ulcerative colitis randomly received 100 mL/day of bifidobacteria-fermented milk or placebo for 12 weeks with conventional treatment. RESULTS: Clinical and endoscopic activity indices and histological scores were similar in the two groups before treatment. Although improvements were significant in both groups, the clinical activity index was significantly lower in the bifidobacteria-fermented milk than in the placebo group after treatment. The post-treatment endoscopic activity index and histological score were significantly reduced in the bifidobacteria-fermented milk, but not the placebo group. Increases in faecal butyrate, propionate and short-chain fatty acid concentrations were significant in the bifidobacteria-fermented milk, but not the placebo group. No adverse effects were observed in either group. CONCLUSION: Supplementation with this bifidobacteria-fermented milk product is safe and more effective than conventional treatment alone, suggesting possible beneficial effects in managing active ulcerative colitis. This is a pilot study and further larger studies are required to confirm the result these preliminary results.},

   abstract = {It was initially hypothesized that resistant starches, i.e., starch that enters the colon, would have protective effects on chronic colonic diseases, including reduction of colon cancer risk and in the treatment of ulcerative colitis. Recent studies have confirmed the ability of resistant starch to increase fecal bulk, increase the molar ratio of butyrate in relation to other short-chain fatty acids, and dilute fecal bile acids. However the ability of resistant starch to reduce luminal concentrations of compounds that are damaging to the colonic mucosa, including fecal ammonia, phenols, and N-nitroso compounds, still requires clear demonstration. As such, the effectiveness of resistant starch in preventing or treating colonic diseases remains to be assessed. Nevertheless, there is a fraction of what has been termed resistant (RS1) starch, which enters the colon and acts as slowly digested or lente carbohydrate in the small intestine. Foods in this class are low glycemic index and have been shown to reduce the risk of chronic disease. They have been associated with systemic physiological effects such as reduced postprandial insulin levels and higher HDL cholesterol levels. Consumption of low glycemic index foods has been shown to be related to reductions in risk of coronary heart disease and Type 2 diabetes. Type 2 diabetes has in turn been related to a higher risk of colon cancer. If carbohydrates have a protective role in colon cancer prevention this may lie partly in the systemic effects of low glycemic index foods. The colonic advantages of different carbohydrates, varying in their glycemic index and resistant starch content, therefore, remain to be determined. However, as recent positive research findings continue to mount, there is reason for optimism over the possible health advantages of those resistant starches, which are slowly digested in the small intestine.},

Dietary factors may play a role in modifying the qualitative and quantitative components of the microflora. We evaluated interactions between nutritional factors, fecal and mucosal bacterial flora, and mucosal morphology in patients with a history of pouchitis compared with patients with optimal outcome at least five years after ileal pouch-anal anastomosis for ulcerative colitis. METHODS: Thirty-two patients were enrolled in the study: 11 (7 males; mean age, 49.8 years) with optimal outcome and 21 (11 males; mean age, 47.3 years) with pouchitis history. A seven-day food diary was recorded, endoscopy performed, and biopsies taken from the pouch for histology, mucin staining, and bacterial culture. Fresh fecal samples were quantitatively cultured, and fecal bile acids analyzed by gas-liquid chromatography. RESULTS: No differences existed in mean nutrient intake, composition of fecal bile acids, or microbial tissue biopsy cultures between the groups with and without pouchitis. Those with optimal outcome tended to have more benign disease course of ulcerative colitis than patients with pouchitis. In those patients, fecal concentrations (log10 colony-forming unit/g) of anaerobes and aerobes were significantly higher (P = 0.007). Degree of villous atrophy and colonic metaplasia were both associated with fecal anaerobic flora. Low intake of lactose was associated with sulfomucin predominance. A negative correlation existed between fecal aerobes and dietary lactose consumption. CONCLUSIONS: A higher total load of fecal anaerobic bacterial flora is strongly associated with degree of colonic metaplasia, villous atrophy, and inflammation activity after surgery for ulcerative colitis. An association existed between dietary lactose, fecal bacteria, and pouch morphology. Lactose may have prebiotic properties.},

We evaluated the effects of a dietary anti-oxidant, Antioxidant Biofactor (AOB), a processed grain food, on dextran sulfate sodium (DSS)-induced colitis in mice. Female ICR mice were fed a diet containing 0.1% or 1% AOB for 2 weeks, during which they were given 5% DSS in drinking water for the latter 1 week to induce colitis. A diet containing 1% AOB, but not that with 0.1% AOB, attenuated DSS-induced body weight loss and colon shortening (each, P < 0.05), and dramatically improved colitis histologic scores. In addition, DSS-induced increases in colonic mucosal IL-1beta, but not TNF-alpha, protein levels were significantly abrogated in 1% AOB-fed mice (P < 0.05). Further, 1% dietary AOB abolished the expression of IL-1beta mRNA levels in colonic mucosa (P < 0.01). Our results suggest that AOB is effective for the prevention of DSS-induced colitis in mice.},

   abstract = {The pathogenesis of IBD is only partly understood; various environmental and host (e.g. genetic-, epithelial-, immune and non-immune) factors are involved. It is a multifactorial polygenic disease with probable genetic heterogeneity, some genes are associated with IBD itself, while others increase the risk of ulcerative colitis (UC) or Crohn's disease (CD) or are associated with disease location and/or behaviour. The role of environmental factors, in particular, enteric antigens, smoking and non-steroid anti-inflammatory drug use has been well established. However uptil now no proof of a role of any unique pathogenic bacteria or special dietary and/or psychosocial factor has been identified. In this hypothesis, the disease may develop in a genetically predisposed host as a consequence of disregulated immune response to environmental, in particular, enteric antigens, resulting in a continuous immune-mediated inflammation (in CD predominantly Th-1, in UC a modified Th-2 mechanisms are involved) and not in tolerance. As a consequence, the permeability of mucosa and the antigen challenge increases, in contrast, the disregulated immune response is unable to downregulate the inflammatory process. This will result in a continuous inflammation and tissue damage. The pathogenesis of CD is thought to be mainly an antigen driven, T-lymphocyte dependent process, while in UC the role of epithelial factors and activated granulocytes are essential.},

   abstract = {INTRODUCTION: An epidemiological study of inflammatory bowel disease (IBD) in Veszprem county (located in western part of Hungary) was carried out from 1977 to 2001. METHODS: Both hospital and outpatient records of IBD patients were collected reviewed carefully. Most patients have been followed up regularly. RESULTS: The number of population has decreased during the observed period from 386,000 to 376,000. The county has both industrial and agrarian parts. 560 new ulcerative colitis (UC) cases, 212 Crohn's disease (CD), and 40 indeterminate colitides (IC) were diagnosed in the investigated period. Incidence rate increased from 1.66 (1977-1981) to 11.01 (1997-2001) in UC, and from 0.41 to 4.68 in CD, respectively. The incidence rate in IC rose from 0.26 to 0.74. The M/F ratio in UC was 1.06, in CD: 1.03, respectively, 41 UD patients and 13 CD patients died, the cause of death was disease related in 6 UC and in 6 CD patients. The average age at death in UC was not different from that observed in general population (66.4 years) but in CD (50.1 years) it was much earlier. The disease related mortality was low, 0.06/100,000 both in UC and CD. The prevalence rate at the end of 2001 was 142.6 for UC and 52.9/100,000 inhabitants for CD. Mean age at onset in UC was 38.9 +/- 15.5 years, in CD 31.7 +/- 12.8 years. We observed only one peak onset of the diseases, in UC it was between 30 and 40 years, in CD between 20 and 30 years. People living in towns were more liable to acquire the disease (ORUC = 1.27, ORCD = 1.13). The rate of smokers at the onset was 14.3% (OR = 0.25) in UC and 50.5% (OR = 1.98) in CD. Ex-smokers were 18.4% and 6.4%. Family history of IBD was present in 3.4% in UC and 9.9% in CD. The location of UC (according to the known largest extent) was proctitis in 112 cases, proctosigmoiditis in 162 cases, left sided colitis in 117 and subtotal or pancolitis in 169 cases. The location of CD was only ileal in 68 cases, ileocolonic in 87 cases, colonic in 57 cases. The behaviour of CD was non-stricturing-non-penetrating in 63 cases, stricturing in 54 cases, penetrating in 95 cases. 59.4% of the CD patients had at least one operation, 6.1% had more than 3 operations. CONCLUSION: The incidence and prevalence rates have increased steadily in Veszprem County, now it reaches that of most western European countries. There were no gender differences either in UC or CD. Smoking seemed to be a risk factor for CD, but it was preventive for UC. The rapid increase in incidence supports a role for environmental (e.g. diet, lifestyle changes) risk factors.},

Fifty female 8-wk old Swiss-Webster mice were randomly assigned to 4 groups for a pre-treatment "prevention" study: (1) GSH (1% of diet); (2) CoQ10 (200 mg/kg/d); (3) DSS only (3% of drinking water); (4) control (no treatment). The mice in groups 1 and 2 were fed with GSH or CoQ10 for 21 wks, and the mice in groups 1, 2 and 3 were provided DSS from wk 7 for 4 cycles (1 cycle = 1 wk DSS followed by 2-wk water). Another 50 mice were randomly assigned to 4 groups for a 21-wk "treatment" study where the mice in groups 1, 2, and 3 were administered DSS for 6 cycles (18 wks) to induce colitis. GSH and CoQ10 were added from wk 7 until the completion of the protocol. Loose stools and hemocult positivity were modestly but significantly reduced with GSH or CoQ10 at several periods during the intervention in both the prevention and treatment studies. In contrast, histological evaluation revealed increases in colonic dysplasia and ulceration with GSH or CoQ10. Thus, in this mouse model, GSH and CoQ10 appear to have a beneficial effect on acute signs of IBD, but may have an adverse impact on the chronic pathophysiology of the disease. Further studies using additional animal models are required to determine whether GSH or CoQ10 provide a favorable or unfavorable benefit:risk ratio in the prevention or treatment of IBD.},

As many as 1.4 million persons in the United States and 2.2 million persons in Europe suffer from these diseases. Previously noted racial and ethnic differences seem to be narrowing. Differences in incidence across age, time, and geographic region suggest that environmental factors significantly modify the expression of Crohn's disease and ulcerative colitis. The strongest environmental factors identified are cigarette smoking and appendectomy. Whether other factors such as diet, oral contraceptives, perinatal/childhood infections, or atypical mycobacterial infections play a role in expression of inflammatory bowel disease remains unclear. Additional epidemiologic studies to define better the burden of illness, explore the mechanism of association with environmental factors, and identify new risk factors are needed.},

Doppler sonography is a newer, non-invasive method to assess the hyperdynamic splanchnic blood flow that is characteristic of acute inflammation. Its role in the analysis of disease activity is still limited and its application restricted to specialized units. However, improved spatial resolution by power Doppler ultrasound, with or without the use of contrast agents, allows a very early detection of mucosal and transmural inflammatory lesions. Still more important, the repeated quantification of mesenteric blood flow enables the prediction of relapse at six months after steroid-induced remission. Future studies should clarify whether the combined application of available methods will allow a more calculated and finally more effective therapy.},

DESIGN: LFD period with Nib or Ord meal frequency followed by an HFD diet with Nib or Ord meal frequency in randomized, crossover design. SETTING: Outpatients of ileostomy volunteers were called for an investigation in research word. SUBJECTS: A total of 10 subjects (two female subjects, age 34 and 51 y; eight males, mean age 54.4 y, range 43-65 y) participated in the experiment. All subjects were proctocolectomized for ulcerative colitis (mean 16.0 y, range 8-29 y before the study). INTERVENTION: In total, 10 ileostomy subjects started with LFD for 2 weeks, the first week on either Nib (five subjects) or Ord (five subjects) and the second week on the other meal frequencies, in a crossover design, followed by a wash-out week, and continued with HFD period for 2 weeks in the same meal frequency manner. All foods consumed in both Nib or Ord regimens were identical and a high-fibre rye bread was used in the HFD period and a low-fibre wheat bread in the LFD period. MAIN OUTCOME MEASURES: Day-profiles of blood glucose, insulin and lipids, blood lipids before and after dietary intervention, and excretion of steroids in the effluents and C-peptide in the urine. RESULTS: During the Nib regimen, plasma glucose and insulin peaks were lower at the end of the day with HFD compared with LFD. Urinary C-peptide excretion was significantly higher in the day-time on LFD compared with HFD (LFD-Ord vs HFD-Ord, P < 0.01; LFD-Nib vs HFD-Nib, P < 0.01). Plasma free-cholesterol, total cholesterol, triglycerides and phospholipids were significantly higher (P < 0.05) after LFD than after HFD with the Nib regimen. A higher excretion of energy (P < 0.05) and chenodeoxycholic acid (P < 0.05) were observed with HFD compared with LFD regardless of meal frequency. A higher daily excretion of cholic acid, total bile acids, cholesterol, net cholesterol and net sterols (P < 0.05) was observed on HFD compared with LFD with the Nib regimen. CONCLUSIONS: An HFD decreased insulin secretion measured as a decreased excretion of C-peptide in urine and as decreased plasma insulin peaks at the end of the day during a Nib regimen. The smoother glycaemic responses at the end of the day during a Nib regimen may be a consequence of a second meal phenomenon, possibly related to the nature of dietary fibre complex.},

   abstract = {BACKGROUND/AIMS: Minimally invasive surgery, with its advantages of early return to normal activity and good cosmetic results, is an important goal in the treatment of patients with mucosal ulcerative colitis. The aim of this study was to compare outcomes utilizing a mini-laparotomy approach to total abdominal colectomy for mucosal ulcerative colitis with those of the conventional approach. METHODOLOGY: Eleven patients scheduled to undergo the first (total abdominal colectomy) of a 2 or 3-stage operation for mucosal ulcerative colitis via a mini-laparotomy between 1999 and 2001 were prospectively studied. The mini-laparotomy described here involves total abdominal colectomy performed through a skin incision shorter than 7 cm. Seven similar patients who underwent conventional laparotomy between 1995 and 1998 served as the control group. RESULTS: The mini-laparotomy approach was accomplished in 9 patients (81.8%). Patient characteristics between cases and controls were similar. Postoperative intervals until standing, walking, flatus, urinary catheter removal, and tolerance of solid diet were significantly shorter in the mini-laparotomy group (P = 0.031, P = 0.023, P = 0.0033, P = 0.0093, and P = 0.023, respectively). CONCLUSIONS: A mini-laparotomy approach to total abdominal colectomy appears feasible and safe in selected patient with mucosal ulcerative colitis and poses an attractive alternative to conventional laparotomy in patients similar to those presented here.},

Plasma total homocysteine (tHcy) is a risk factor for vascular disease and has been implicated as a mediator of thromboembolic events in adults with IBD. The authors studied the link between tHcy and IBD in children, in whom associations may be clearer, and investigated associations with plasma von Willebrand factor antigen, a marker of vascular damage. METHODS: This cross-sectional study included 43 patients with IBD (27 Crohn disease, 9 ulcerative colitis, and 7 indeterminate colitis) and 46 control subjects from a pediatric gastroenterology clinic. Plasma tHcy, plasma 5-methyl tetrahydrofolate, red cell folate, plasma vitamin B12, plasma von Willebrand factor antigen, and methylene tetrahydrofolate reductase (MTHFR) genotype (for the C677T mutation) were measured. RESULTS: Plasma tHcy concentrations were higher in children with IBD than in control subjects, when corrected for age (P < 0.05), and plasma tHcy was negatively correlated with plasma 5 methyl tetrahydrofolate (P < 0.0005). Plasma 5 methyl tetrahydrofolate and age were the main predictors of plasma tHcy. Neither MTHFR genotype nor von Willebrand factor showed any association with any other measure, and there were no differences between children with IBD and control subjects. CONCLUSIONS: Elevated plasma tHcy is a consequence of IBD in children, probably mediated by poor folate status associated with diet or the pathophysiology of the disease.},

   abstract = {There is considerable loss of DM during wet heat treatment of vegetables, leading to an increase in dietary fibre. Correction for the loss of DM indicates that the effects on total dietary fibre are minor. There is, however, depolymerization of the dietary fibre polysaccharides. The degradation is related to the severity of the heat treatment. Souring, freezing and mild microwave treatment have no effects. The viscosity is in general related to the extent of polymerisation. Microwave treatment has different effects on various cultivars of green beans, and the addition of salt (NaCl and CaCl2) to the boiling water changes the physico-chemical properties of soluble fibre in carrots, depending on the cation. The higher viscosity of the soluble fibre in raw carrots may partly explain the lower glucose and hormonal responses observed in healthy subjects when compared with blanched and microwave-cooked carrots. In studies on rats the amount of butyric acid in the distal colon has been shown to be higher with dietary components containing high amounts of resistant starch. Further, the fermentability is lower and the butyric acid concentration higher with composite foods than with the corresponding purified fibre fractions. In human studies the faecal concentration of butyric acid has been shown to increase in patients with ulcerative colitis when [beta-glucan-enriched oat bran (20 g fibre) is added to the diet for 12 weeks. Also, an improvement of symptoms was reported.},

   abstract = {Inflammatory bowel disease, notably ulcerative colitis (UC) or Crohn disease (CD), is basically benign, but sometimes develops into serious or fatal cancer. While the primary therapies are medical, such as pharmacotherapy and dietetic modification, intractable, serious, and cancerous cases can require surgical intervention. Surgery represents only one of the treatment options, but prediction of whether UC and CD are likely to progress to serious conditions and determination of when to undertake surgery is essential. Various surgical procedures have been developed over time, and the postoperative results are now generally good. Regarding laparoscopic surgeries, relatively few cases have been accumulated, and addressing the indications and limitations is premature at this point. However, this procedure is likely to fulfill a central role in surgical treatment strategies and represent a major benefit to patients. This paper discusses surgical treatment indications and methods for UC and CD, and explains the practical aspects of laparoscopic surgery, which has made remarkable progress in recent years, for such cases.},

   abstract = {BACKGROUND & AIMS: Dietary fiber has been proven to be beneficial in maintaining remission in human ulcerative colitis, an effect related with an increased luminal production of short-chain fatty acids (SCFA). The aim of the present study was to further investigate the mechanisms involved in the intestinal anti-inflammatory effects of dietary fiber in an experimental model of rat colitis. METHODS: HLA-B27 transgenic rats (8-10 weeks old) were fed a fiber-supplemented diet (5% Plantago ovata seeds) for 13 weeks before evaluation of the colonic inflammatory status, both histologically and biochemically. The luminal colonic production of SCFA was quantified. In vitro studies were also performed to test the interaction between two SCFA (butyrate and propionate) as inhibitors of cytokine production in THP-1 cells. RESULTS: Dietary fiber supplementation ameliorated the development of colonic inflammation in transgenic rats as evidenced by an improvement of intestinal cytoarchitecture. This effect was associated with a decrease in some of the pro-inflammatory mediators involved in the inflammatory process: nitric oxide, leukotriene B(4), tumor necrosis factor alpha (TNFalpha). The intestinal contents from fiber-treated colitic rats showed a significant higher production of SCFA, butyrate and propionate, than non-treated colitic animals. In vitro studies revealed a synergistic inhibitory effect of butyrate and propionate on TNFalpha production. CONCLUSIONS: Dietary fiber supplementation ameliorated colonic damage in HLA-B27 transgenic rats. This effects was associated with an increased production of SCFA, which can act synergistically in inhibiting the production of pro-inflammatory mediators.},

   abstract = {Crohn's disease, ulcerative colitis, and pouchitis are caused by overly aggressive immune responses to a subset of commensal (nonpathogenic) enteric bacteria in genetically predisposed individuals. Clinical and experimental studies suggest that the relative balance of aggressive and protective bacterial species is altered in these disorders. Antibiotics can selectively decrease tissue invasion and eliminate aggressive bacterial species or globally decrease luminal and mucosal bacterial concentrations, depending on their spectrum of activity. Alternatively, administration of beneficial bacterial species (probiotics), poorly absorbed dietary oligosaccharides (prebiotics), or combined probiotics and prebiotics (synbiotics) can restore a predominance of beneficial Lactobacillus and Bifidobacterium species. Current clinical trials do not fulfill evidence-based criteria for using these agents in inflammatory bowel diseases (IBD), but multiple nonrigorous studies and widespread clinical experience suggest that metronidazole and/or ciprofloxacin can treat Crohn's colitis and ileocolitis (but not isolated ileal disease), perianal fistulae and pouchitis, whereas selected probiotic preparations prevent relapse of quiescent ulcerative colitis and relapsing pouchitis. These physiologic approaches offer considerable promise for treating IBD, but must be supported by rigorous controlled therapeutic trials that consider clinical disease before their widespread clinical acceptance. These agents likely will become an integral component of treating IBD in combination with traditional anti-inflammatory and immunosuppressive agents.},

   abstract = {BACKGROUND: There are no published data from Great Britain and Ireland detailing the initial management of children with inflammatory bowel disease (IBD). AIMS: To prospectively record the initial investigation and treatment of children aged less than 16 years with newly diagnosed IBD. METHODS: For 13 months, between June 1998 and June 1999, 3247 paediatricians, adult gastroenterologists, and surgeons across the UK and Ireland were prospectively surveyed each month and asked to report every newly diagnosed case of childhood IBD. Reporters subsequently completed a postal questionnaire about each case. RESULTS: A total of 739 new IBD cases were reported from 172 institutions. Significant variations were observed in the investigation and treatment of these cases, when examined by number of cases reported per institution, or by the specialists providing care. There were wide regional variations in the proportion of children having access to paediatric gastroenterology services. Overall, one third of children received care from an adult service, and a tenth care exclusively from an adult gastroenterologist. Children with Crohn's disease who had some or all of their care from adult services were more likely to receive systemic steroids and less likely to receive dietary therapy; those with ulcerative colitis were more likely to receive rectal steroids and to have surgery. Height and weight were also less likely to be recorded in those whose care involved adult services. CONCLUSION: Current specialist provision, and initial investigation and treatment of IBD, is heterogeneous. Optimisation of care is likely to be achieved by greater access to specialist paediatric gastroenterology services for all those with suspected IBD.},

METHODS: A 33-question questionnaire was sent, by mail, to 74 patients (over 70, between 70 and 50 and under 50 y old). The questionnaire explored 5 parameters of function: systemic symptoms, bowel symptoms, functional impairment, social impairment and emotional impairment. Further questions investigated the need for a nurse or relative to assist with management of the stoma, the frequency of changing the bag and the appliance, diet and the ability of patients to attend their normal daily activity. RESULTS: Thirty-four patients completed the questionnaire. The final quality of life score was similar for all the 3 age groups but elderly patients needed more assistance in the stoma management. The quality of life scores in males patients were significantly better than in females. No statistically significant difference was observed comparing loop ileostomy versus end ileostomy and Crohn's disease versus ulcerative colitis. CONCLUSIONS: Quality of life is not influenced by age, underlying inflammatory disease or type of ileostomy. Males report less impact on quality of life than women.},

   abstract = {The chronic inflammatory bowel disease ulcerative colitis (UC) occurs commonly in the US and other Western countries, but its etiology is unknown. An association between UC and an elevated risk for colorectal cancer is well established. UC-associated colorectal carcinogenesis is probably driven by chronic inflammation, but the mechanism is unclear. The morphological development of UC-associated cancer differs from that of its sporadic counterpart. Similarly, detailed molecular analyses have indicated that whereas many of the genetic alterations observed in sporadic colon cancers also occur in UC-associated neoplasms, the timing and frequency of those changes in the setting of UC are different. These histological and molecular signatures may very well be reflective of an inflammation-driven carcinogenesis process in UC patients. Studies in animal models of UC have helped to shed light on the mechanisms of inflammation-driven colorectal carcinogenesis. The available evidence suggests that DNA damage caused by oxidative stress in the characteristic damage-regeneration cycle is a major contributor to colorectal cancer development in UC patients. Based on this concept, iron over-nutrition is proposed as a risk factor and dietary antioxidants as protective factors for UC and associated carcinogenesis.},

METHODS: Case records of all patients diagnosed as having adult celiac disease in the Gastroenterology unit of this hospital during January 1996 till December 2001 were reviewed. Celiac disease was diagnosed according to the revised ESPGAN criteria. Adult celiac disease was diagnosed if disease manifestations started after 15 years of age. All patients had a minimum of one-year follow up. RESULTS: The mean duration of illness in the 96 patients (mean [SD] age 32.9 [11.4] years; 50 men) diagnosed over the 6-year study period was 7.3 (2.4) years. Diarrhea was present is 67.7% of cases; 18.7% presented with refractory iron-deficiency anemia, and 9.4% with abdominal symptoms like flatulence and distension. Three patients presented with dysphagia and anemia and were diagnosed as having Plummer-Vinson syndrome. Ulcerative colitis, non-alcoholic steatohepatitis, and aphthous ulcers were associated conditions. All patients had significant improvement in symptoms and hematological and biochemical parameters after dietary gluten restriction. CONCLUSION: Adult celiac disease is not rare and usually presents as diarrhea, abdominal distension and flatulence, and refractory anemia.},

METHODS: Functional outcome was determined by questionnaire and telephone interview. Surgical results were determined by retrospective chart review. RESULTS: Data were gathered from 26 patients (mean age at IPAA, 12 years; mean follow-up, 3.7 years). Diagnoses were ulcerative colitis in 18, indeterminate colitis in 4, and familial polyposis in 4. Indications for IPAA included intractability, medication toxicity, growth delay, and cancer prophylaxis. Short-term complications (5 patients; 19%) included partial small bowel obstruction, stomal revision, pouch abscess, and negative exploration. Long-term complications (8 patients; 31%) were chronic pouchitis and anal stricture. The average number of stools per 24 hours was 3.9. No incontinence was reported; dietary restrictions were negligible. Although there were minimal differences from population norms, parental anxiety remained high. Chronic pouchitis correlated negatively with physical summary score. Nocturnal stooling negatively affected psychosocial quality of life. CONCLUSIONS: Pediatric IPAA resulted in excellent bowel health. Quality of life, physical function, mental health, and self-esteem were equivalent to those of healthy children. These data may help families and physicians make informed surgical decisions.},

OBJECTIVE: To describe a patient with documented primary sclerosing cholangitis associated with chronic ulcerative colitis, who developed hepatic toxicity following ingestion of metabisulfite. RESULTS: A placebo-controlled oral challenge suggested metabisulfite hypersensitivity with liver toxicity. He was treated with cobalamin (to prevent sulfite toxicity), low-sulfite diet, steroids, and antibiotics and has had an unusually benign course for 19 years. CONCLUSIONS: The hypersensitivity to oral metabisulfite in our patient appeared to be a significant trigger to flare-ups of his disease. Controlling the response to metabisulfite (along with recurrent antibiotic and steroid therapy) may have contributed significantly to the remarkably good outcome in this patient.},

   abstract = {BACKGROUND: Little is known of the effects on gastric function after ileal J pouch-anal anastomosis (IPAA) for ulcerative colitis. This study aimed to determine whether patients with postoperative high stool frequency after IPAA exhibit impaired gastric function. METHODS: Gastric emptying time (GET) for a solid diet (rice gruel) with the use of a radioisotope method and for a liquid diet (orange juice) with the use of an acetaminophen method were assessed in 36 patients with ulcerative colitis more than 30 months after closure of protective ileostomy. Patients were divided into 2 groups: 18 patients with stool frequency less than 6 per day (group A) and 18 patients with stool frequency more than 7 per day (group B). GET for solid and liquid diets in groups A and B were compared with those in 18 healthy volunteers (group C). We correlated the time of peak blood concentration of acetaminophen (TPBCA) and both individual stool frequency per day and the length of distal ileum removed. RESULTS: GET for the solid diet in groups A and B was not altered by IPAA compared with group C. GET for the liquid diet in groups A and B was slower than in group C (P<.0001). GETs for the liquid diet at 60 minutes or more in group A were slower than in group B (P<.0001); TPBCA was longer in group A than in groups B or C (P<.01). There were inverse correlations between TPBCA and individual stool frequency per day and between TPBCA and length of distal ileum removed (P<.001). CONCLUSIONS: Rapid transit from the stomach of the liquid diet in group B compared with group A may influence high stool frequency after IPAA. Our results suggested that, to obtain an adequate stool frequency after IPAA, the length of distal ileum removal should be less than 15 cm.},
