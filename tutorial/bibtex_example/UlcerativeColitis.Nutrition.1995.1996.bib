DESIGN: The study was performed as a cross-over design. SETTING: The subjects were studied as outpatients except on the sampling days when all subjects were admitted to the research ward and stayed in a nearby patient hotel overnight. SUBJECTS: Six men and two women, all proctocolectomised for ulcerative colitis, volunteered to participate in the study. INTERVENTIONS: During each dietary period of 3 weeks, food and excreta were collected and analysed on days 3, 17 and 18. RESULTS: The excretion of crude protein and amino acids (free and bound) was generally higher during the high-fibre diet period, although the relative proportion of amino acids was similar in the ileal effluents from the two diets. The apparent digestibilities of crude protein and all amino acids except histidine, tyrosine and proline were significantly (P < 0.05) lower during the high-fibre diet period. CONCLUSION: It was indicated that the effect of the high-fibre rye-based diet was a generally impaired ileal amino acid absorption.},

DESIGN: The study was performed as a cross-over design. SETTING: The subjects were studied as outpatients except on the sampling days when all subjects were admitted to the research ward and stayed in a nearby patient hotel overnight. SUBJECTS: Seven men and three women, all proctocolectomised for ulcerative colitis, volunteered to participate in the study. One female subject was withdrawn from the study because of inflammation of the ileal stoma. INTERVENTIONS: During each dietary period of 3 weeks, food and excreta were collected and analysed on days 3 and 17. RESULTS: No significant differences in excretion of crude protein or amino acids (free and bound) were found between the two sampling days. Intake as well as excretion of all analysed amino acids was higher during the high-fibre diet period, although the relative proportion of amino acids was comparable in the two diets and their corresponding ileal effluents. Aspartic acid, glycine, threonine, alanine and serine were found in considerably higher relative proportions in the effluents from the subjects when they consumed each of the two diets than their concentrations in the diets. The apparent digestibilities were significantly (P < 0.05) lower for all analysed amino acids during the high-fibre diet period. Aspartic acid (10.7%), alanine (9.9%) and glycine (8.5%) showed a more pronounced decrease than the mean decrease in amino acid digestibility (6.6%) when subjects consumed the high-fibre diet. CONCLUSION: Intake of the oat bran high-fibre diet resulted in significantly lower amino acid and crude protein digestibility. The relative amino acid proportions in the diets and their corresponding excretas were, however, comparable for the two diets.},

   abstract = {A group of 24 patients underwent a 7-14-day course of continuously infused Cyclosporin A (2 mg.kg-1.day-1) to treat a severe attack of ulcerative colitis. In 19 of them, including eight treated with total parenteral nutrition, we retrospectively analyzed the serum aminotransferase (AST/ALT) levels at the beginning and at the end of Cyclosporin infusion. The baseline levels of AST/ALT in the group were 19.9 +/- 3.2 and 31.4 +/- 6.4; on stopping Cyclosporin infusion, they were 43 +/- 15.8 and 119 +/- 56, respectively. Six patients showed an ALT change above 1.5 times the upper limit of reference. They included five of the eight patients treated with total parenteral nutrition (62.5%). In one of six, ALT rose to 1000 U/l and was accompanied by full-blown febrile cholangitis (proven by liver biopsy). This episode was preceded by excessive accumulation of Cyclosporin in blood. The development of liver toxicity was independent of the length of Cyclosporin treatment, nor did it impair drug efficacy. Thus, in these patients total parenteral nutrition and Cyclosporin were synergistic, causing twice the frequency of liver damage (62.5%) reported for ulcerative colitis patients on total parenteral nutrition alone (37%). Total parenteral nutrition should not be used to support patients needing Cyclosporin for autoimmune disease. However, too high a dose of Cyclosporin may cause liver disease per se.},

This association was examined in a prospective cohort of 47,678 American men, 40 to 75 years of age, and free of diagnosed diverticular disease, colon or rectal polyp, ulcerative colitis, and cancer before 1988. During four years of follow up, 382 newly diagnosed cases of symptomatic diverticular disease were documented. After adjustment for age, energy adjusted dietary fibre, and energy adjusted total fat, overall physical activity was inversely associated with the risk of symptomatic diverticular disease (for highest versus lowest extremes, relative risk (RR) = 0.63 (95% confidence interval (CI) 0.45, 0.88). Most of the inverse association was attributable to vigorous activity, for extreme categories RR = 0.60 (95% CI 0.41, 0.87). For activity that was not vigorous the RR was 0.93 (95% CI 0.67, 1.69). Several specific activities were inversely associated with the risk of diverticular disease, but jogging and running combined was the only individual activity that was statistically significant (p for trend = 0.03). For men in the lowest quintile for dietary fibre intake and total physical activity (compared with those in the opposite extreme), the RR was 2.56 (95% CI 1.36, 4.82). Physical activity, along with a high fibre diet, may be an important factor in the prevention of symptomatic diverticular disease.},

   abstract = {Nutritional therapy for ulcerative colitis (UC) is controversial. Studies are usually designed to investigate total parenteral (TPN) or total enteral nutrition (TEN), and before these can be compared it is necessary to differentiate between the different therapeutic aims. The aims of artificial nutritional support in patients with UC are the readjustment of the nutritional status, possible remission of disease activity, and decrease in the incidence of surgical intervention or postoperative complication. Owing to the heterogeneity of the results published so far, it is still difficult to compare studies. Nevertheless, they indicate that the extent and severity of the colitis and the patient selection are of paramount importance in the implementation of nutritional therapy. Positive effects of TPN reported from non-controlled studies were not confirmed by controlled trials. Moreover, TPN was no more effective than an oral diet. Regarding remission rates or operative interventions needed, TPN had more side effects than and no defined advantages over TEN. TEN seems to be useful for certain patients. In some patients with UC, it seems to be accompanied by fewer postoperative complications. However, a definitive conclusion on the effects of TEN or TPN is not yet possible. In this context, certain fatty acids may have an important role in the treatment of UC. In prospective, randomized and controlled studies omega-3 fatty acids were found to be therapeutically useful. A reduction of the steroid doses needed is particularly important. Another therapeutic approach in distal UC is seen in the rectal administration of short chain fatty acids.},

Local therapy was given for distal disease (seven cases); other disease was treated with oral prednisolone (1-2 mg/kg/day, maximum 40 mg). Eighteen of the children showed a clinical improvement on therapy, and complete remission of clinical disease activity by 8 weeks was seen in 17 (85%). C-reactive protein was elevated initially in 10 of 20 children and returned to normal posttreatment in all but one. Reassessment of the colon after treatment showed an improved endoscopic appearance in 15 and complete remission in eight (40%). Histological improvement was seen in 13, with full remission in only three (15%). In conclusion, remission of clinical disease activity by corticosteroid therapy in ulcerative colitis may not be accompanied by endoscopic remission and uncommonly by mucosal healing. This finding may be important prognostically because of the risk of dysplasia in long-standing persistent mucosal inflammation.},

However the effect of treatment on these lymphokines has not been studied. PATIENTS AND METHODS: Using a reverse haemolytic plaque assay the percentage of lymphokine-secreting cells was determined in the intestinal mucosa of children with Crohn's disease before and after 8 weeks of treatment with either enteral nutrition, cyclosporin or steroids. RESULTS: Before treatment, a high percentage of cells isolated from mucosal biopsies secreted IL-2 or interferon-gamma. Eight weeks' treatment with the immunosuppressive agents cyclosporin, or with corticosteroids, produced a significant reduction in the percentage of IL-2 secreting cells, although only for the former was there also a reduction in interferon-gamma secreting cells. Enteral nutrition however, produced a reduction in lymphokine-secreting cells equivalent to cyclosporin and produced the best histological and clinical improvement. CONCLUSION: Enteral nutrition and cyclosporin can down-regulate lymphokine secretion in the gut in Crohn's disease.},

The aim of our study was to compare serum IL-6 and IL-2R levels to see if one marker better distinguished IBD from other intestinal disorders or better reflected disease activity. Blood samples were obtained from 41 pediatric patients with Crohn's disease, 22 with ulcerative colitis, 19 with other gastrointestinal inflammatory disorders, and 13 with functional abdominal pain. Disease activity and disease location were determined for patients with Crohn's disease and ulcerative colitis. Serum levels of IL-6 and IL-2R were determined by using an enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay. Mean serum levels of IL-6 were significantly elevated (p < 0.05) in patients with Crohn's disease when compared with individuals with ulcerative colitis, other gastrointestinal inflammatory disorders, or functional abdominal pain. By comparison, there was no significant difference in mean serum levels of IL-2R in individuals with Crohn's disease compared with these other groups. Patients with moderate/severe Crohn's disease had elevated mean serum levels of IL-6 and IL-2R when compared with those with mild and inactive disease (p < 0.05); however, neither marker distinguished between inactive and mild disease. IL-6 correlated better with the erythrocyte sedimentation rate (ESR; r = 0.57, p < 0.001) than did IL-2R (r = 0.28, p < 0.01). Our results suggest that elevated IL-6 levels a.e more likely to be seen in patients with Crohn's disease. Although IL-6 may be a better marker for Crohn's disease and active disease than IL-2R, it does not appear to offer any advantage over the ESR.},

During the survey period, 29 pregnancies occurred in 18 Crohn's patients, and 25 in 19 ulcerative colitis patients. Incidence of relapses during pregnancy and post-partum was 14 and 17% in Crohn's, and 36 and 12% in ulcerative colitis. Fourteen Crohn's patients (17 pregnancies) and 17 ulcerative colitis patients (19 pregnancies) were followed for 3 years before pregnancy and for 4 years after delivery. During the 3 years after pregnancy, the number of relapses/year was significantly lower compared to the 3 years before pregnancy and to the incidence in controls, both in Crohn's (p < 0.05) and ulcerative colitis (p < 0.005). Changes in nutritional status were recorded in 41% of Crohn's, but in none of the ulcerative colitis patients. The reduced incidence of relapses following delivery in Crohn's patients was more marked in the 10 with normal nutritional status at the time of conception (70% reduction in number of relapses, p < 0.05), while in the 7 significantly underweight patients, the reduction was slight (27% reduction in number of relapses, p = NS). In conclusion, the incidence of relapses in the first 3 years after pregnancy is lower than in the pre-pregnancy period. In Crohn's disease, the effect is more evident in patients with normal nutritional status at the time of conception than in malnourished patients.},

Rectoscopy and colonoscopy allowed to identify and to excise one large size villous polyp, which was the site of dysplasia and liberkuhn adenocarcinoma. Transrectal ultrasonography showed thickened mucosa and submucosa and suspect adenopathy. Proctectomy, ganglionic curage and coloanal anastomosis were then performed; one of the excised adenopathies was metastatic. The patient died twelve hours after surgery from an unexplained cardiovascular collapse. CONCLUSIONS--Unspecific symptoms of colorectal cancer explain that its diagnosis is often delayed. Prognosis is poor related to the advanced stages at diagnosis and mucinous adenocarcinomas. Better knowledge of the clinical presentations and of high risk situations as polyposis, ulcerative colitis, hereditary non polyposis colorectal cancer could improve the prognosis.},

   abstract = {UNLABELLED: Inflammatory bowel diseases have an important impact on the daily life of patients. This impact can be measured by the evaluation of the health related quality of life. The aim of this study was to develop and to validate a questionnaire of quality of life in a French population. METHODS: The questionnaire comprised 70 items and was completed in 15 min. It was made up of a) a general questionnaire of 36 items (SF-36) exploring daily physical and social functioning, mental and general health, body pain and vitality. A sleep module of 6 items was added. b) a specific questionnaire of 28 items (RFIPC), exploring the concerns of the patients. The questionnaire was self-administered to 101 patients with Crohn's disease (57 F. 44 M. mean age: 35 years, acute disease: 28%, inpatients: 27%), 96 patients with ulcerative colitis (38 F. 58 M. mean age: 39 years, acute disease: 53%, inpatients: 21%). Each patient was sex and age matched with a healthy control. RESULTS: The psychometric analysis confirmed the validation of the questionnaire for the item's convergent validity, internal consistency (Cronbach's coefficient being > 0.70), analyses of discrimination. Scores of each scale of SF-36 were worse in patients than in controls. Scores of patients with active disease were worse than those of patients with quiescent disease. Scores were comparable in patients with Crohn's disease and with ulcerative colitis except for score of pain which was worse in acute Crohn's disease. The most important concerns of patients were the uncertain nature of the disease, energy level and having surgery. CONCLUSION: This study allowed the validation of a questionnaire for the evaluation of the quality of life in French patients with inflammatory bowel disease and provides first indications which need to be confirmed by future epidemiological studies.},

   abstract = {: Mesalamine is an enteric-coated 5-aminosalicylic acid formulation effective in the treatment of ulcerative colitis, and in decreasing the relapse rate in Crohn's disease. However, little data are available regarding its use in children and adolescents. To determine the modalities of use, safety, and the optimal dose in this age group, charts of 153 pediatric patients with inflammatory bowel disease treated with mesalamine were reviewed, representing >150 patient years of use. Among these, more than half of the children diagnosed with Crohn's disease (120 patients) had ileocolonic involvement, and pancolitis predominated in those with ulcerative colitis (33 patients). Patients with ulcerative colitis were diagnosed at a younger age than those with Crohn's disease, and thus mesalamine therapy was initiated earlier. When used as monotherapy, no difference was noted in the average dose used for the treatment of active disease versus maintenance therapy (36 mg/kg/day). However, the average dose used did increase since 1992, for both the treatment of active disease and relapse prevention (43 mg/kg/ day). Overall, 18 patients (11.8%) were withdrawn from mesalamine therapy; however only 8 (5.2%) had objective side effects. Exacerbation of diarrhea was the most common reason for withdrawal. Although reported rarely, no serious adverse reactions such as pancreatitis or hepatic or renal dysfunction were observed. This study suggests that mesalamine is a safe and well-tolerated medication in the long-term treatment of pediatric patients with ulcerative colitis and Crohn's disease.},

This case report describes a 36-year-old woman with ulcerative colitis who went into hyperammonemic coma after administration of total parenteral nutrition. A similar episode of coma had occurred 7 years earlier after she delivered a normal boy. Heterozygous ornithine transcarbamylase deficiency was diagnosed based on a positive allopurinol tolerance test result after elevated levels of plasma glutamine and low plasma citrulline were detected. The protein load associated with parenteral alimentation resulted in symptomatic expression of this partial enzyme deficiency in this unique case. Partial ornithine transcarbamylase deficiency must always be considered in adult women and men with hyperammonemia who have normal liver function test results.},

Epithelial biopsy specimens were incubated for 16 hours in RPMI 1640 with glutamine, supplemented with 10% fetal calf serum and N-acetyl-[3H]-glucosamine ([3H]-Glc NAc), and differing concentrations of sodium butyrate. Incorporation of [3H] Glc NAc into mucin by normal epithelium at least 10 cm distant from colonic cancer was increased in the presence of sodium butyrate in a dose dependent manner, with maximum effect (476%) at a concentration of 0.1 mM (number of specimens = 24 from six patients, p < 0.001). The increase in response to butyrate was not seen when specimens were incubated in the presence of the beta oxidation inhibitor sodium bromo-octanoate 0.05 M. The striking increase in mucin synthesis that results when butyrate is added to standard nutrient medium suggests that this may be an important mechanism affecting the rate of mucin synthesis in vivo and may also explain the therapeutic effect of butyrate in colitis.},

Most cases have been reported in neutropenic patients after chemotherapy for hematologic neoplasms, and some in association with conditions such as rheumatoid arthritis, benign cyclic neutropenia, and solid neoplasms. As far as we know, four cases of NE associated to AA (aplastic anemia, hypoplastic bone marrow) have been previously reported, two of them with autopsy studies. The macroscopic findings in the enterocolonic lesions were not illustrated. We report the first two cases in Mexico. The NE was neither clinically nor radiographically suspected initially, i.e. the morphologic diagnosis of their colonic lesions were amebic colitis in one and edematous ulcerated colitis in the other. Medical treatment without surgery was instituted. Both died. The macroscopic aspect of the enterocolonic lesions in NE associated to aplastic anemia in our two patients was similar to that in NE associated to hematologic neoplasms. In Mexico there is little experience in the clinical, radiographic or morphologic diagnosis of this rare association.},

We have included 7 patients (4 male and 3 female) with an acute episode of inflammatory bowel disease (IBD). Each received 1780 kcal/day (1500 non-protein kcal 66% as fats, and 33% as glucose), with a kcal/g of N ratio of 160 by means of the preparation technique of "all in one". The anthropometric parameters: initial and final weight (58.5 +/- 12 vs. 57.3 +/- 11); triceps skin fold (14.1 +/- 4 vs. 14.1 +/- 4), and mean circumference of the arm (25.1 +/- 3 vs. 25.0 +/- 3), did not give any significant differences during the treatment period. In the biochemical data there were no significant differences either, except for the final level of serum albumin (3.44 +/- 0.28), which was significantly higher than the initial value (3.11 +/- 0.38) (p < 0.05). The mean duration of the treatment was 12 days (range 6-18). There was no case of phlebitis.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS)},

Since then he has been on a maintenance dose of sulphasalazine without any further symptoms. Because of a known pseudopolyposis coli, repeat coloscopy was performed. EXAMINATIONS AND FINDINGS: The endoscope was smoothly introduced and the examination was without pain. No premedication had been given. A biopsy was obtained during withdrawal of the endoscope. Suddenly the patient noticed marked scrotal swelling. The examination was terminated abruptly. No lesions of the wall of the distal colon were seen when the endoscope was pulled out immediately. Quickly, cutaneous emphysema developed over the right side of the abdomen and thorax up to the neck. The patient could no more properly hear his own voice. Radiology demonstrated bilateral pneumoretroperitoneum, mediastinal emphysema and pneumothorax. TREATMENT AND COURSE: The patient was put on parenteral nutrition for 4 days and prophylactically received amoxycillin, calvulanic acid and metronidazole. The air was gradually absorbed and the patient discharged symptom-free after 7 days. CONCLUSION: In contrast to intraperitoneal perforation, which usually causes acute symptoms of peritonitis and requires urgent surgical treatment, the course of the much rarer retroperitoneal perforation is more benign with few symptoms and can be managed conservatively.},

Numerous reports recommend surgery within 10-14 days if clinical remission is not achieved. We undertook a study to follow the clinical course and long-term follow-up of patients with severe ulcerative colitis treated medically for longer than 14 days (n = 11). METHODS: We performed a retrospective review of all patients admitted to the hospital with a diagnosis of severe ulcerative colitis who were treated for more than 14 days. RESULTS: Nine percent of patients (n = 1) required surgery during their hospitalization. Ninety-one percent of patients (n = 10, mean age 8.6 yr, 7 M, 3 F) treated with medical and nutritional therapy for more than 14 days went into clinical remission. Of these, only 10% (n = 1) ultimately required surgery; 60% remain in clinical remission up to 83 months posthospitalization (mean follow-up, 49.5 months), whereas 30% suffer from mild to moderate colitis (mean follow-up, 26.3 months). CONCLUSIONS: These results do not support the recommendation for colectomy for refractory severe ulcerative colitis if remission is not noted within 2 wk of hospitalization.},

   abstract = {The hallmark of ulcerative colitis is a diffuse infiltration of neutrophils from the circulation into the colonic mucosa. The underlying mechanism for neutrophil tissue infiltration is unknown. One possible hypothesis is abnormal circulating neutrophils. This hypothesis has been previously tested with conflicting results. The aim of our study was to re-evaluate circulating neutrophil function in the absence of several possible confounding factors. To this end, we measured the respiratory burst of circulating neutrophils in response to two different stimuli by chemiluminescence in patients with active and inactive ulcerative colitis being off all medications. Our results show no significant difference between ulcerative colitis patients and controls in peak chemiluminescence, area-under-the-curve and time to peak comparisons. However, 27% of patients with active ulcerative colitis had an abnormally elevated chemiluminescence to stimuli. In addition, no correlations were seen between disease activity and peak chemiluminescence. Thus circulating neutrophils in the majority of patients with ulcerative colitis do not appear to be either "primed" or hyperactive. This may suggest the presence of local colonic factors that lead to neutrophil tissue infiltration and activation.},

   abstract = {: We sought to characterize the incidence, nature, and course of liver disease in children with inflammatory bowel disease (IBD). Chart review identified 555 subjects (318 Crohn's disease [CD], 237 ulcerative colitis [UC]). An alanine aminotransferase measurement of >/=80 U/L was used to identify the presence of a hepatic abnormality. Seventy-five patients (47 CD, 28 UC) had at least one ALT level >/=80 U/L. Persistent ALT elevation (>6 months) was found in 14 patients: 10 with sclerosing cholangitis (SC) (eight UC, two CD) and four with autoimmune chronic active hepatitis (CAH) (one UC, three CD). One patient with SC has had hepatic transplantation, and one other has end-stage liver disease. The remainder are clinically well. Two patients with CAH have developed cirrhosis. Nonpersisting ALT elevations (<250 U/L) were noted during disease course in 61 patients and were associated with medications, parenteral nutrition, bowel obstruction, and flare-ups of disease. Most ALT elevations in children with IBD are transient and appear to relate to medications or disease activity. Sclerosing cholangitis was noted in 3.5% of UC patients and <1% of CD patients, while CAH was found in <1% of UC or CD patients. Unless evidence of chronic liver disease is present, the initial finding of mild to moderate ALT elevation (80-250 U/L) should prompt observation before extensive evaluation.},

The present study assessed the relationship of mucosal IL-1ra levels to histologic severity of inflammation and the related proinflammatory cytokines IL-1 beta and IL-6 in children with inflammatory bowel disease. Colonic biopsy specimens from 29 patients with ulcerative colitis, 27 with Crohn's disease, and 24 noninflammatory control subjects were assayed for IL-1ra, IL-1 beta, and IL-6 by enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay. Histologic activity was graded as none, mild, moderate, or severe. Mucosal IL-1 beta levels, but not IL-1ra levels, were significantly elevated in moderate/severely inflamed biopsies from patients with either ulcerative colitis (p < 0.01) or Crohn's disease (p < 0.001) compared with those with none/mild inflammation. The mucosal molar ratio of IL-1ra/IL-1 beta was significantly lower for moderate/severe inflammation compared with none/mild inflammation for patients with ulcerative colitis (p < 0.05) and Crohn's disease (p < 0.01). The mucosal IL-1ra/IL-1 beta ratio was similar in controls to none/mild inflamed biopsies from subjects with either ulcerative colitis or Crohn's disease. Our observations suggest that increasing mucosal inflammation in inflammatory bowel disease in children is associated with a decrease in the "normal" effective IL-1ra/IL-1 beta ratio in which IL-1ra predominates. The importance of this abnormality to the pathogenesis of inflammatory bowel disease awaits further study.},

   abstract = {Although many foods have been suggested to play a role in the cause of IBD, there are not yet definitive data to support diet as a cause of either CD or UC. Malnutrition is a common occurrence in IBD, and this must be considered in the treatment of these diseases. Nutritional support in IBD has limited use as primary therapy (Table 2). Even though parenteral and enteral nutrition have been associated with remission, relapse frequently occurs when normal food intake is resumed. Likewise, fistulae may resolve with aggressive, nutritional therapy, but they frequently recur with reinstitution of food. In short bowel syndrome caused by extensive intestinal resection performed in CD, parenteral nutrition provides an important mode of therapy. In addition, perioperative use of nutritional support may decrease the incidence of postoperative complications in patients who are malnourished. Nutritional support in pediatric patients with CD who have growth failure has been effective in stimulating growth.},

This study was undertaken to determine the clinical features of total parenteral nutrition (TPN)-induced fulminant beriberi by reviewing the clinical data on 10 of our own patients who developed this complication, and 33 cases documented in the literature. TPN-induced fulminant beriberi became evident 4-40 days after the initiation of TPN, and was more likely to develop in patients with malignancies, ulcerative colitis, and short bowel syndrome, as well as in those receiving chemotherapy. Although the patients manifested various symptoms, very few developed the classical signs of beriberi or the constant findings seen in alcoholic patients. The severity of metabolic acidosis was extremely high and refractory to bicarbonate administration, but it responded quickly to intravenous (i.v.) thiamine. Thus, rapid i.v. administration of at least 100 mg of thiamine is imperative, and the patient must be transferred to the intensive care unit when TPN-induced fulminant beriberi develops.},

   abstract = {BACKGROUND: Patient education has been accepted widely over the past years as a valid component of disease management in patients with chronic diseases. The aim of our study was to evaluate the effects of patient education in patients with inflammatory bowel disease. Participation in a patient education program should increase the patient's disease-related knowledge and positively influence the patient's quality of life, depression, beliefs of internal control and social activity. METHODS: We studied 36 patients with Crohn's disease and ulcerative colitis: 18 were educated in four sessions, 18 were not educated (control-group). The following topics were presented: diagnosis, causes and course of disease; medication and surgery; nutrition and social benefits and stress management and coping with the disease. RESULTS: The effects of the program were evaluated before, immediately and three months after the intervention using questionnaires. Participants in the program showed a significant increase in knowledge after three months compared with the non-participants. There were positive, although not significant effects on psychosocial variables. CONCLUSION: Patient education is a valuable means to increase knowledge of disease and treatment in patient's with Crohn's disease and ulcerative colitis. Effects on psychosocial variables need to be examined on a long term basis in larger patient groups.},

   abstract = {UNLABELLED: Health-related quality of life (HRQOL) is a quantitative measurement of subjective perception of health state, including emotional and social aspects. It can be reliably measured with several valid instruments. Previous reviews of the literature suggested inadequate attention to HRQOL in studies of interventions in inflammatory bowel disease. PURPOSE: This study was undertaken to assess the current status of the quality of measurement of HRQOL in studies of inflammatory bowel disease and to review the clinical conclusions warranted by the literature. METHOD: Medicine was searched for articles relating to ulcerative colitis, Crohn's disease, or inflammatory bowel disease and quality of life since 1981. The articles found were reviewed for citations of further articles. The adequacy of HRQOL measure was assessed and graded, and the study design was categorized to assess the strength of the literature on the whole. RESULTS: A trend was found toward higher quality of HRQOL measurement in the period 1988 to 1994 compared with 1981 to 1987. Most of the improvement was because of increased use of standardized and multidomain but unvalidated and unpublished questionnaires for measurement. CONCLUSIONS: Confidence in the following clinical conclusions in studies of surgical interventions in inflammatory bowel disease is limited by study design: that pelvic pouch is not inferior to ileostomy, that specific domains of HRQOL are differentially affected by different surgical procedures, and (with less confidence) that surgery is helpful in Crohn's disease. Medical studies have demonstrated that high quality HRQOL measures can be integrated into randomized, prospective trials. Clinically equivalent treatments have shown differential effects or HRQOL: 9 mg daily of budesonide is superior to 15 mg, and hydrocortisone foam enemas are superior to prednisolone. Home parenteral nutrition has received modest support, limited again by study design. It is recommended that standard tests of HRQOL be used to increase comparability of studies and to increase the quality of this literature in general. In particular the Inflammatory Bowel Disease Questionnaire, Rating Form of Inflammatory Bowel Disease Concerns, and Direct Questioning of Objectives are recommended.},

   abstract = {The etiology of inflammatory bowel disease is still unknown. Several potential mechanisms are discussed. The etiological and therapeutic importance of nutrition is controversial. Though changes in dietary habits and incidence of inflammatory bowel disease during the last century were in parallel, no specific nutritional factor has been isolated. No dietary prophylaxis of inflammatory bowel disease is yet known; all dietary therapies in inflammatory bowel disease aim to improve nutritional support and to diminish inflammation by bowel rest. Children and adolescents gain in weight and height. Total parenteral nutrition will not substantially reduce disease activity and operation rates. Total parenteral nutrition can only be recommended in ulcerative colitis patients with severe disease in the initial phase and in Crohn's patients with severe malnutrition and intestinal complications. Enteral nutrition support is less effective in ulcerative colitis than in Crohn's disease. Reported remission rates on enteral nutrition are 25% for ulcerative colitis and up to 80% for Crohn. However, in active Crohn's disease enteral nutrition is less effective than standard therapy with methylprednisolone and sulfasalizine. It is generally believed that nutrition therapy in combination with drugs is the best treatment modality. There is no evidence to support the importance of any combination of the formula diets such as elemental, oligopeptide, or polymeric formulations. Administration of formula diets by nasogastric tubes all show similar remission rates. Whether newer diets supplemented with arginine, glutamine, omega-3-fatty acids or short chain fatty acids increase remission rates is not known. Further studies in this field are warranted.},

Six (6.7%) of the 90 patients had short stature, i.e., a height below the 3rd centile, and 8 of the 18 who had surgery had a subnormal height velocity, i.e., below the 25th centile for age at the time of surgery. Surgery was performed for resistance to medical therapy (n = 13) or toxic megacolon (n = 5). Surgery was followed by catch-up growth, i.e., increasing height velocity, in eight subjects and cessation of the trend of diminishing height velocity, but without catch-up growth, in five. In 11 of the subjects who were prepubertal, the median height velocity increased from 3.85 cm/year preoperatively to 7.35 cm/year postoperatively (p < 0.01). One year after surgery, 14 of the 18 patients were either asymptomatic or substantially improved. Surgery therefore led to improved linear growth and a prolonged symptom-free period in most of the children and adolescents with ulcerative colitis undergoing this treatment.},

   abstract = {Nutrition and intestinal function are intimately interrelated. The chief purpose of the gut is to digest and absorb nutrients in order to maintain life. Consequently, chronic gastrointestinal (GI) disease commonly results in malnutrition and increased morbidity and mortality. For example, studies have shown that 50-70% of adult patients with Crohn's disease were weight-depleted and 75% of adolescents growth-retarded. On the other hand, chronic malnutrition impairs digestive and absorptive function because food and nutrients are not only the major trophic factors to the gut but also provide the building blocks for digestive enzymes and absorptive cells. For example, recent studies of ours have shown that a weight loss of greater than 30% accompanying a variety of diseases was associated with a reduction in pancreatic enzyme secretion of over 80%, villus atrophy and impaired carbohydrate and fat absorption. Finally, specific nutrients can induce disease, for example, gluten-sensitive enteropathy, whilst dietary factors such as fibre, resistant starch, short-chain fatty acids, glutamine and fish-oils may prevent gastrointestinal diseases such as diverticulitis, diversion colitis, ulcerative colitis, colonic adenomatosis and colonic carcinoma. The role of dietary antigens in the aetiology of Crohn's disease is controversial, but controlled studies have suggested that elemental diets may be as effective as corticosteroids in inducing a remission in patients with acute Crohn's disease. In conclusion, nutrition has both a supportive and therapeutic role in the management of chronic gastrointestinal diseases. With the development of modern techniques of nutritional support, the morbidity and mortality associated with chronic GI disease can be reduced. On the other hand, dietary manipulation may be used to treat to prevent specific GI disorders such as coeliac disease, functional bowel disease, Crohn's disease and colonic neoplasia. The future development of nutria-pharmaceuticals is particularly attractive in view of their low cost and wide safety margins.},

Colitis was induced in CBA/J mice by adding dextran sulfate sodium (DSS), 5% (wt/vol), to their water. DSS-induced colitis is a reproducible animal model for evaluating the role of cytokines in the pathology of colitis. Animals were weighed daily, and stools were checked for the presence of blood. Groups of mice were killed daily, blood samples were taken for measurement of plasma cytokine levels, and colonic samples were taken for histology and measurement of TNF and IL-6 bioactivity. Mice fed DSS developed colitis with bloody diarrhea, weight loss, and colonic inflammation by days 5-9. Histologic examination of the colons showed focal crypt destruction and ulceration. In mice with DSS-induced colitis no TNF was detectable in colonic tissue extracts or in plasma. In contrast, plasma IL-6 was detectable from days 4 to 9 and was detectable in colonic tissue in only a few (two of four) terminally ill animals on day 9. Animals were injected with a neutralizing, polyclonal anti-TNF antiserum that maintained high in vivo neutralizing titers for > or = 48 h. This anti-TNF antiserum failed to block or modify the severity of colitis induced by DSS. Failure to detect local or systemic TNF and failure to prevent colonic inflammation with anti-TNF antiserum showed that TNF is not an inflammatory mediator in DSS-induced murine colitis.},

   abstract = {Thromboembolic disease is a well-recognized but very uncommon complication of inflammatory bowel disease. The mechanisms of the increased risk of thrombosis are not well understood: although several coagulation abnormalities have been described in inflammatory bowel disease patients, it is not clear whether they actually contribute to hypercoagulation or whether they are nonspecific markers of inflammation. Antiphospholipid antibodies (anticardiolipin antibodies and/or lupus anticoagulant) have recently been associated with an increased risk of thrombosis, particularly cerebrovascular disease in young patients. We report the case of a 33-yr-old female with severe ulcerative colitis at first attack who developed thrombosis of the superior and inferior longitudinal dural sinuses. No risk factors for thrombosis or coagulation abnormalities were observed; however, lupus anticoagulant was detected in the serum. The patient was successfully treated with osmotic agents, prophylactic anticonvulsant, and antiplatelet therapy, combined with i.v. steroids. After 6 months, the colitis is in remission, and the neurological recovery is good even if not yet complete.},

Leukocytes were separated from 15 to 60 ml venous blood and were labeled in vitro with [99mTc]HM-PAO. The segmental extent (small intestine; ascending, transverse, and descending colon; and recto-sigmoideum) of the process was determined by LS. The uptake of each bowel segment was scored in relation to the bone marrow uptake. The scintigraphic activity, calculated by summing the segment scores, was compared with laboratory parameters. The mean labeling efficacy was 76% (60-86%). The segmental extent of the process determined by LS was compared with the results of barium enema or colonoscopy with regard to 32 bowel segments. The sensitivity, specificity, and accuracy of LS were 93, 88, and 91%, respectively. Two extraintestinal manifestations (abdominal abscess and joint involvement) were also detected by LS. These lesions were verified by computed tomography (CT) (abscess) and on the basis of the clinical outcome (arthritis). The scintigraphic activity correlated with the C-reactive protein (CRP) level (r = 0.82, p < 0.001), the alpha 2-globulin level (r = 0.63, p < 0.02), the sedimentation rate (r = 0.51, p < 0.05), and the fS iron level (r = -0.66, p < 0.005). LS is applicable in pediatric patients. The method is an excellent technique for assessment of the extent of IBD in children. Extraintestinal manifestations of IBD can also be investigated by LS. The scintigraphic activity is a useful parameter for determination of the activity of IBD in children.},

The serum alpha1-AT level, ESR, platelet count, and hemoglobin values of 154 children who were initially evaluated for possible IBD, as well as of 113 children with known IBD, were compared to evaluate their value as markers of inflammatory activity. Of the 154 children evaluated for IBD, 103 did not have IBD, 28 were diagnosed with Crohn's disease (CD), and 23 were found to have ulcerative colitis (UC). The sensitivity and specificity for CD was for alpha1-AT, 100%, 92%; for ESR, 68%, 94%; and for UC was for alpha1-AT, 70%, 92%; for ESR, 61%, 94%. In the 113 children with known IBD (66 CD, 47 UC), the sensitivity and specificity for predicting disease activity was for CD for alpha1-AT, 94%, 59%; for ESR, 52%, 63%; and for UC was for alpha1-AT, 79%, 76%; and for ESR, 59%, 82%. The determination of serum alpha1-AT levels was more sensitive and specific than the ESR in the initial diagnosis of CD and in predicting subsequent disease activity in both CD and UC.},

   abstract = {The aim of this study was to assess whether in steroid-resistant patients with pediatric inflammatory bowel disease (IBD) a combination of cyclosporine and azathioprine (or 6-mercaptopurine) could induce remission and subsequently permit maintenance on azathioprine/6-mercaptopurine as the sole immunosuppressive agent. Two boys and six girls (six with ulcerative colitis and two with Crohn's disease; ages 3-17 years) received 100-200 micrograms/kg/day cyclosporine intravenously and then 4-10 mg/kg/day orally. Doses were adjusted to achieve trough serum cyclosporine levels of 100-200 mu/L (Abbott's TDX assay). Seven of the eight patients received azathioprine/6-mercaptopurine, and all were given a 5-aminosalicylate preparation and corticosteroids. The latter drugs were continued and then tapered off as clinical status allowed. Cyclosporine was continued for 3-10 months in those who responded. In seven of eight patients, there was a rapid clinical response; one patient showed a transient response, but recurrent bleeding led to total colectomy 9 days after starting cyclosporine. Of the seven responders, three were able to discontinue prednisone and cyclosporine and are doing well on azathioprine at long-term follow-up (2-5 years). One who did not receive azathioprine/6-mercaptopurine maintained remission for 2 years after cyclosporine was stopped, one experienced a disease flare-up 5 months after start of cyclosporine treatment and required colectomy, one who did not tolerate 6-mercaptopurine had a flare-up during cyclosporine tapering and underwent surgery at 6 months, and one started to flare up with cyclosporine tapering at 6 months and was scheduled for surgery. No significant complications of treatment were observed. Seven patients had an initial response and four of them have so far not required surgery. These preliminary findings suggest that azathioprine/6-mercaptopurine can be used safely to maintain cyclosporine-induced remission in children with IBD.},

Consideration is also given to constipation associated with diverticular disease and ulcerative colitis. We also discuss the pathogenesis of fecal incontinence in the elderly, paying particular attention to fecal impaction and neurological causes that result in both constipation and incontinence. The importance of previous obstetric trauma and pudendal enuropathy is emphasized. We conclude with detailed guidelines of the clinical assessment and management of an elderly patient with a disorder of defecation.},

Then she developed toxic megacolon, and was transferred to our hospital on the 1st of July and underwent subtotal colectomy the same day. After surgery, she received intravenous hyperalimentation (IVH) which contained 1,000 Kcal/day without vitamin supplementation. From the 8th to the 13th post-operative days, she took 3/4 or more of the liquid diet which contained 1,050 Kcal, protein 35 g, carbohydrate 166 g and vitamin B1 0.59 mg per day. From the 14th to the 23rd post-operative days, she ate 4/5 or more of the oral diet which contained 1,700 Kcal/day, protein 68 g, carbohydrate 236 g and vitamin B1 0.93 mg per day. During the 7th to the 23rd day, the IVH was reduced to 800 Kcal and then 500 Kcal per day. She talked less on the 19th post-operative day, and in a few days, her level of consciousness began to decline progressively. On the 27th post-operative day, neurological examinations revealed the following: semi-coma, almost fixed pupils which were 3 mm in diameter, absent doll's eye movement to all directions, flaccid extremities with abolished deep tendon reflexes. Pertinent abnormalities on laboratory data at that time consisted of hemoglobin 7.8 g/dl and serum total protein 5.4 g/dl. Lumbar puncture revealed normal cerebrospinal fluid under normal opening pressure. Cranial magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) taken on the 27th post-operative day demonstrated, on T2-weighted images, symmetrical high intensity lesions in the periventricular areas of the third and fourth ventricles, and periaqueductal area of the midbrain.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS)},

   abstract = {BACKGROUND: The colonic mucosa is highly dependent upon the presence of luminal nutrients. This dependence is most marked in the distal colon. The major luminal nutrients are short chain fatty acids that are produced as a by-product of colonic fermentation of carbohydrates. Butyrate appears to be the short chain fatty acid most avidly metabolized by the colonic mucosa. It has been suggested that ulcerative colitis is, at least in part, related to an energy deficiency state of the colonic mucosa which may be secondary to impaired short chain fatty acid production, uptake or utilization. The objective of this study was to determine if butyrate given as enema therapy is effective in the treatment of active distal ulcerative colitis. METHODS: Thirty-eight patients with distal ulcerative colitis were randomly assigned to receive nightly butyrate (n = 19) or saline/placebo (n = 19) enemas. Butyrate enemas consisted of 60 mL of 80 mM sodium butyrate titrated to a pH of 7.0. Patients were assessed clinically and endoscopically at baseline and at 3 and 6 weeks follow-up. Pre- and post-treatment mucosal biopsies were assessed histologically. Response to therapy was determined by changes in a 12-point clinical disease activity index score based on patient symptoms, endoscopic mucosal appearance and physicians' global assessment. RESULTS: Clinical improvement was noted in seven of 19 (37%) butyrate-treated patients and nine of 19 (47%) placebo-treated patients (P = 0.51). Clinical remission was achieved in three patients in each group (16%). No toxicity was observed in either treatment arm. CONCLUSIONS: The results suggests that once nightly 60 mL butyrate enemas (80 mmol/L) are not efficacious in the treatment of distal ulcerative colitis.},

   abstract = {BACKGROUND: Newer techniques for surgical treatment of chronic ulcerative colitis have been developed. PURPOSE: This review article analyzes the current surgical alternatives, attempting to define their role in the overall management of patients with chronic ulcerative colitis. RESULTS: Non-restorative total proctocolectomy with permanent ileostomy remains as the gold-standard operation for chronic ulcerative colitis. Restorative total proctocolectomy, with or without excision of the anal transitional zone, is becoming one of the most widely used procedures for this disease. It avoids a permanent ileostomy, and permits good functional results in the majority of patients. Subtotal proctocolectomy, with a Hartmann Pouch may be an adequate procedure in patients operated upon on emergency basis, to permit an ileo-anal pouch in a subsequent operation. Colectomy with ileo-rectal anastomosis, and creation of a continent ileostomy are procedures that should be limited to selected candidates. CONCLUSIONS: Currently, total proctocolectomy with ileo-anal pouch seems to be the operation of choice in the majority of patients, but the preoperative general status is important to define the best surgical alternative for each patient.},

   abstract = {Metabolic interaction between the intestinal microflora and the host has been suggested to play a role in the pathogenesis of chronic inflammatory bowel disease. Elemental or low-fat, low-residual diets in patients with Crohn's disease or ulcerative colitis are reported to decrease anaerobic bacteria and to change the composition of the intestinal microflora. We examined the effect of an indigestible agent, 4G-beta-D-galactosylsucrose (lactosucrose), which is selectively utilized by intestinal Bifidobacterium, on the composition of the intestinal microflora. After the administration of lactosucrose to two patients with Crohn's disease and five patients with ulcerative colitis for 2 weeks, significant induction of the growth of Bifidobacterium was observed, and significant reduction in the population level of Bacteroidaceae was seen. Bowel movements improved in four patients. The intestinal environment, estimated by measuring fecal pH, fecal levels of short-chain fatty acids and putrid products, and the urinary secretion of indican, also improved in these patients. These results suggest that lactosucrose may be useful for patients with chronic inflammatory bowel disease.},

   abstract = {Symptoms and physical findings may indicate the severity of inflammatory disease of the colon, but detailed history taking is needed to limit the wide spectrum of possible causes. Infectious causes should be ruled out before other disease is assumed to be present. No single test is sufficient to diagnose ulcerative colitis or Crohn's disease. Laboratory testing, histologic assessment, endoscopy, radiology, and bowel studies are often necessary in differential diagnosis. Because of the systemic nature of colitis, manifestations in the musculoskeletal, ocular, dermatologic, hepatobiliary, and other systems may occur and provide clues. Treatment depends on the type and severity of disease. Sulfasalazine (Azulfidine), sulfa-free 5-aminosalicylic acid compounds, and corticosteroids are mainstays of treatment of ulcerative colitis and Crohn's disease. Supportive care and judicious use of antimicrobial therapy are usually effective in colitis due to bacterial, parasitic, and sexually transmitted infections and are useful for symptoms caused by colonic ischemia and vasculitis. Colitis resulting from radiation therapy may present several years after the procedure and can be difficult to diagnose and treat. In many cases of inflammatory colon disease, especially chronic conditions, consultation with a gastroenterologist is highly recommended.},

DESIGN: We studied dietary habits immediately prior to the onset of disease in 104 patients enrolled in a prospective, epidemiological study of the incidence of inflammatory bowel disease in Italy. METHODS: Each patient was interviewed using a recall questionnaire to provide information on the daily intake of nutrients. The differences in diet between patients and healthy subjects matched for age, sex and city of residence were determined. RESULTS: Our data confirm that patients with Crohn's disease and ulcerative colitis have a high intake of total carbohydrate, starch and refined sugar. This resulted in a significantly higher relative risk (P < 0.001) in both ulcerative colitis and Crohn's disease patients. Total protein intake was significantly higher in ulcerative colitis, but not in Crohn's disease patients, than in controls. Fibre consumption did not differ between patients and controls. CONCLUSIONS: Our results confirm that carbohydrate consumption is significantly higher in IBD patients than in healthy controls. Ulcerative colitis patients also consumed more total protein than controls. The pathogenetic significance of these findings, however, remains unclear.},

   abstract = {PURPOSE: Emergency surgery for fulminant colitis is often complicated by high-dose steroid therapy, poor nutrition, and psychologic maladjustment. Cyclosporine is effective for fulminant ulcerative colitis in adults, resulting in avoidance of immediate surgery in 75 percent of patients and a 55 percent long-term remission rate. Over the last five years, we studied the effectiveness of cyclosporine in children with fulminant colitis. METHODS: Fourteen patients with ulcerative colitis (age, 7-20 years) received cyclosporine after satisfying the following criteria: 1) greater than five bloody diarrheal stools per day; 2) severe abdominal pain; 3) no improvement after ten days of bowel rest, 4) intravenous methylprednisolone (1-2 mg/kg/day); and 5) parenteral nutrition. Treatment was begun with oral cyclosporine (4.6-9.6 mg/kg/day), and the dose was adjusted to achieve whole blood trough levels measured with a monoclonal radioimmunoassay between 150 and 300 ng/ml. If improved, patients were discharged on oral cyclosporine, prednisone, and a regular diet. RESULTS: Eleven of 14 patients (78 percent) responded within two to nine days and were able to consume a normal diet, had three or less soft stools per day, and had no pain. One did not respond after ten days and underwent an ileal pouch-anal anastomosis procedure. Two patients elected surgery after 20 days of therapy and a partial response. Of 11 patients who left the hospital, 4 had recurrent symptoms after 2 to 11 months of taking therapeutic doses of cyclosporine and 3 flare ups while weaning from cyclosporine after 4 to 8 months. Three patients have been weaned from cyclosporine after 8 to 13 months and have remained in remission from six months to five years. One patient is about to complete a six-month course of cyclosporine. Overall ten (72 percent) have undergone surgery, including 7 of 11 who responded initially to cyclosporine and left the hospital. Weight (P < 0.001), albumin (P < 0.01), erythrocyte sedimentation rate (P > 0.05), and prednisone dose (P < 0.001) improved significantly in the seven patients on cyclosporine who responded initially, left the hospital, and subsequently underwent surgery. CONCLUSIONS: Cyclosporine is effective in achieving clinical remission in 80 percent of children with refractory fulminant colitis; however, within one year, most initial responders will require colectomy because of a flare up of the disease. In a majority of patients, the role of cyclosporine therapy is to rapidly ameliorate symptoms and prevent precipitous colectomy, improve nutrition and psychologic adaptation, and reduce the steroid dose leading to surgery in a well-prepared patient.},

   abstract = {BACKGROUND: It has been shown that MUC2 is the prominent mucin synthesised in healthy colon. AIM: To identify the predominant mucins in ulcerative colitis (UC) and to study their biosynthesis. METHODS AND RESULTS: Mucin was purified from UC resection specimens. This mucin on sodium dodecylsulphate polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis (SDS-PAGE) presented as one, high molecular weight, periodic acid/Schiff's reagent (PAS) stainable band. Amino acid composition showed a close resemblance to that of MUC2. Immunoprecipitation with a specific anti-MUC2 antiserum confirmed that this mucin was MUC2. In addition, on the mRNA level MUC2 was also the most prominent mucin expressed in UC. Polyclonal antiserum was elicited, mainly recognising mucin peptide epitopes of UC and normal colonic mucin. Biosynthetic studies with [35S]amino acids showed that the MUC2-precursor in UC displayed a molecular mass on SDS-PAGE of approximately 600 kDa. This precursor was converted into a mature MUC2 with anomalous mobility on SDS-PAGE of 550 kDa and was secreted. Only this 550 kDa band could be labelled with [35S]sulphate and stained by PAS. CONCLUSIONS: This study shows that in parallel with the mucin expression in healthy controls, MUC2 is the major mucin expressed in UC. Qualitatively, MUC2 biosynthesis seems unchanged in UC.},

In this review, the use of parenteral and enteral nutritional support as primary therapy in patients with inflammatory bowel disease has been critically evaluated. Most studies have been uncontrolled and nonrandomized with short-term follow-up. The literature does suggest, however, that intense nutritional support may have an adjunctive role to drug therapy in achieving remission in Crohn's disease, especially in corticosteroid-refractory patients. Nutritional support has a lesser role in chronic ulcerative colitis, except for assistance in pre- and postoperative management. The data do not support one variety of nutritional support over another, although enteral support should be used if possible, as it is less costly and potentially less complicated.},

   abstract = {PURPOSE: Subtotal colectomy with ileostomy is the operation of choice for patients with fulminant colitis. Restorative proctocolectomy (RPC) with ileal pouch-anal anastomosis (IPAA) is preferred for patients who undergo elective surgery for ulcerative colitis. We retrospectively evaluated the safety of RPC with IPAA in patients with a moderate form of fulminant colitis. METHODS: A chart review of 737 patients who underwent RPC with IPAA for ulcerative and indeterminate colitis from 1983 through 1992 was performed. Moderate fulminant colitis was defined as acute disease requiring hospitalization and parenteral steroid therapy, but without hypotension (systolic blood pressure, < 100 mmHg), tachycardia (> 120 beats/min), or megacolon. RESULTS: Twelve patients with moderate fulminant colitis underwent urgent surgery (1.6 percent). They had been treated preoperatively for 5.1 +/- 2.3 days with intravenous high-dose steroids, total parenteral nutrition, and antibiotics. These patients had a shorter length of disease (P = 0.01), lower hemoglobin, hematocrit, and albumin (P = 0.001), and higher temperature (P = 0.002) and leukocyte count (P = 0.007) than patients undergoing elective surgery. No early septic complications occurred, although perianal abscess occurred in one patient and pouch-anal fistula in another patient, 13 and 14 months after surgery, respectively. CONCLUSION: In carefully selected, hemodynamically stable patients with fulminant colitis and without megacolon, RPC with IPAA can be safely performed.},
