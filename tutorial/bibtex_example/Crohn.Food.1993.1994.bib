   abstract = {Selenium is an essential trace element at lower concentrations and toxic at higher concentration. Animals can metabolize both inorganic and organic forms and convert non methylated Se to mono--or di--or tri--methylated forms, of which, mono-methylated forms are most toxic. Glutathione reductase converts selenoglutathione to H2S in liver and erythrocytes and is ultimately excreted. Se effects the toxicities of xenobiotic agents, provides antagonistic effect to Sulphur and co-administration with Zn increase Se retention in certain organs. At its toxic level (4-8 ppm) it increases Cu contents of heart, liver and kidney and has detoxifying or protecting effect against Cd and Hg. It is a prosthetic group of several seleno metalloenzymes. The concentration of the element is decreased in serum/plasma or erythrocytes of patients of AIDS, trisomy-21, Crohn's and Down's syndrome, phenylketonurea, Keshan's disease and cancer. Rather, the element has antiproliferative and cancer protecting effect. Se content of testes increases considerably during pubertal maturation and, during Se deficiency, the supply to the testes has priority over the other tissues. The element is localized in the mitochondrial capsule protein (MCP) and is involved in biosynthesis of testosterone. Neither the age of mother nor the concentration of Se during pregnancy has any effect on weight of baby or the length of pregnancy. Se levels in human milk is affected by maternal intake and its requirements by infants and young children are higher for their rapid growth. Clinical symptoms of its toxicity include severe irritations of respiratory system, metallic taste in mouth, formication of nose, signs of rhinitis, lung edema and brancho-pneumonia. The typical garlic odour of breath and sweat is due to dimethyl-selenide.},

We carried out a study of patient tolerance in a group of Crohn's disease (CD) patients with a new fish oil derivative consisting of 500-mg capsules of eicosapentaenoic-docosahexaenoic (EPA 40%-DHA 20%), a free fatty acid mixture (Purepa), and we also evaluated its incorporation into phospholipids, both in plasma and in red cell membranes. Five groups of 10 CD patients in remission received nine Purepa capsules daily in four different preparations (A: uncoated, B: coated, pH 5.5; C: coated, pH 5.5, 60 min time release; D: coated, pH 6.9) and 12 x 1-g capsules daily of a triglyceride preparation (Max-EPA, EPA 18%-DHA 10%), respectively. We coated three of the four Purepa preparations in order to delay the release of contents in an attempt to minimize the side effects. After six weeks of treatment, the group taking Purepa capsules, coated, pH 5.5, 60 min time release (group C) showed the best incorporation of EPA and DHA in red blood cell phospholipid membranes (EPA from 0.2 to 4.4%, DHA from 3.7 to 6.3%), and no side effects were registered, whereas in all other groups side effects were experienced in 50% or more of subjects. This new preparation will make it possible to treat patients for long periods.},

   abstract = {Both genetic and environmental factors appear to play an aetiologic role in Crohn's disease. The hypothesis of genetic susceptibility is based on the frequency of familial forms (6-33%) and higher relative risk in first degree relatives (x10 to x21). Three genetic segregation analyses have defined a genetic model favouring autosomal recessive transmission and incomplete penetration. The frequency of the deleterious allele would be 0.01 in the general population. One-third of all patients would be homozygous. To date, no genetic marker has been found for Crohn's disease although in one study, molecular biology techniques revealed a significant association between the HLA-DR1, DQW5 genotypes, and the association DR1/DQW5, and Crohn's disease. There are also many arguments in favour of an environmental cause, including: increased incidence since the Second World War, a north-south incidence gradient (established in the US and probable in Europe), predominance in urban areas. In addition, 21 conjugal forms were recently reported in the US, including 14 which appeared after marriage. We have also observed 10 conjugal forms in a limited area in northern France and in Belgium. Smoking has also been shown to have a detrimental effect, perhaps via modifications in the microcirculation of the intestinal wall. Despite contradictory results, oestrogen-progesterone treatment does not appear to increase the risk of Crohn's disease and there is no convincing evidence that any particular food could be incriminated. In contradiction with a widely believed myth, there is no evidence showing that psychiatric factors have an effect on appearance or aggravation of the disease. Perinatal infection has however been recently shown to affect incidence and subjects born during periods of flu epidemics have a higher relative risk. Still other studies have emphasized the dual role of genetic/environmental factors. Based on current knowledge, the sequence leading to the appearance of Crohn's disease would include one or more perinatal event(s) such as viral infection acting on a genetically susceptible subject and leading to modified immune response in a vulnerable system (perinatal period). Later in life an aggression (environment) would lead to inappropriate immune response. Current research is directed towards identifying infectious agents capable of triggering the disease and on markers of genetic susceptibility.},

   abstract = {Impaired intestinal function, negatively affecting food digestion and absorption, is called chronic intestinal failure (CIF). The clinical conditions leading to CIF are: fistulas, wide resections and severe damage to small bowel, and chronic intestinal stasis. In the etiology of CIF, the most frequent conditions are: Crohn's disease, postoperative peptic ulcer, mesenteric arteriopathy, radiation enteropathy, acute pancreatitis, jejunoileal diverticulosis and intestinal pseudo-obstruction. The radiologic approach to CIF can aim at: 1) diagnosing the disease and the clinical conditions causing it; 2) morphometric analysis: lesion spread, length of the extant normal small bowel and adaptive changes. Digestive tube radiology has always been considered a fundamental investigation technique to study malabsorption. Double contrast enema has increased the diagnostic capabilities of radiology. Moreover, double contrast enema allows the extraoperative evaluation, in vivo, of a new anatomic feature--i.e., intestinal length--which is a valuable sign for an exhaustive interpretation of CIF, especially of the short bowel syndrome. Thanks to double contrast enema, the changes in the length of mesenteric small bowel can be calculated in vivo (range: 150-430 cm; mean: 291 cm, SD 59). Intestinal length < 150 cm was observed only in resected patients. In 25% of cases, short small bowels were associated with CIF. Such morphometric studies, if applied to clinical practice, may yield valuable information for both diagnosis and prognosis.},

   abstract = {The developments in enteral feeding for Crohn's disease in the past decade are critically reviewed. The advent of amino acid based chemically defined elemental diets signalled the end of 'total bowel rest' in the management of these patients. Subsequently, controlled clinical trials showed that elemental diets were as effective as corticosteroids in inducing clinical remission in patients with acute exacerbations of Crohn's disease. The later use of peptide based elemental diets, in Crohn's disease produced somewhat conflicting results. The initial uncontrolled studies suggest that polymeric whole protein diets might also be effective in the management of acute exacerbations of the disease, casting in turn doubts concerning the role of dietary antigens in the pathogenesis of Crohn's disease. Results of controlled studies comparing the use of elemental and polymeric diets as primary therapy in Crohn's disease have, however, also produced conflicting results. The results of one recent controlled trial in which the use of polymeric diet was compared with that of corticosteroids does, however, suggest that these diets may have a primary therapeutic effect in Crohn's disease. An analysis of the composition of some of the enteral diets used in different trials suggest that the effectiveness of enteral diets in treating active Crohn's disease might relate more to their fat than nitrogen composition. A hypothesis is proposed that the effectiveness of enteral nutrition in the primary therapy of acute exacerbations of Crohn's disease occurs because the successful diets used contain insufficient precursors for arachidonate derived eicosanoid synthesis.},

   abstract = {Elemental diet is as effective as corticosteroids in the treatment of previously untreated Crohn's disease. It is unclear whether a poor nutritional state is a prerequisite for efficacy of elemental diet, whether previously treated patients respond as well, or how duration of remission using elemental diet compares with corticosteroid induced remission. Forty two patients with active Crohn's disease were stratified for nutritional state and randomised to receive Vivonex TEN 2.1 l/day for four weeks, or 0.75 mg prednisolone/kg/day for two weeks and subsequent reducing doses. Nine of 22 (41%) patients assigned to nutritional treatment were intolerant of the diet. Thirty patients completed four weeks treatment. Disease activity decreased on elemental diet from mean (SEM) 4.8 (0.9) to 1.7 (0.6), p < 0.05, and on prednisolone from 5.3 (0.5) to 1.9 (0.6), p < 0.05. For each treatment, nourished and malnourished patients responded similarly. Patients with longstanding disease responded as well as newly diagnosed patients. The probability of maintaining remission at six months was 0.67 after prednisolone, 0.28 after elemental diet, and at one year was 0.35 after prednisolone and 0.09 after elemental diet, p < 0.05. When tolerated, elemental diet is as effective in the short term as prednisolone in newly and previously diagnosed Crohn's disease, and its benefit is independent of nutritional state. The subsequent relapse rate after elemental diet induced remission, however, is greater than after treatment with prednisolone.},

The compound was administered in the diet for 119 weeks (rats) and 120 weeks (mice) at dose levels of 100, 300 and 900/1800 mg/kg b.w./d for mice and of 300, 900 and 2700/1800 mg/kg b.w./d for rats. The administration of benzalazine produced no effects on survival, appearance or behaviour. Body weights of the high-dosed male mice and rats (both sexes) were occasionally significantly decreased when compared to the controls. A slight but in most cases statistically significant reduction of the relative food consumption of the female mice of all treated groups was observed between test weeks 6 and 12. In the high-dosed rats a statistically significant increase of the relative food consumption was found between test weeks 17 and 109. At necropsy, there was no evidence of treatment-related changes, nor were these seen on histopathological examination. All microscopic changes seen in mice and rats were of the usual type commonly occurring in untreated aged NMRI mice and Sprague-Dawley rats. However, an increased incidence of thyroid cystic hyperplasia was found in the rats of the high dose-level group. In addition, an increased incidence of thyroid adenomas was found in the male rats of the high-dosed group only as compared to the control groups. This increased tumour incidence is regarded as a marginal finding and may be of a spontaneous nature within the normal range of the background data. However, a substance-related influence cannot completely be excluded. In conclusion, the administration of benzalazine for more than 24 months to NMRI mice and Sprague-Dawley rats produced only slight effects on body weight in the high-dosed male mice and in rats (both sexes) with a no-effect level of 300 mg/kg b.w./d in the diet for mice or 900 mg/kg b.w./d in the diet for rats. There was no evidence of an oncogenic effect of benzalazine.},

Benzalazine elicited no evidence of teratogenicity when administered orally during the fetal organogenesis period to pregnant rats at doses up to 2000 mg/kg b.w./d, or to pregnant rabbits at doses up to 1000 mg/kg b.w./d. Rat fetuses in the 400 and 2000 mg/kg groups exhibited decreased body weights; the placentae weights were decreased in these dose groups, too. Rabbit fetuses in the high-dose group (1000 mg/kg b.w./d p.o.) also showed decreased body weights. Decreased body weight gain and reduced food intake were seen in rat dams in the high-dose group (2000 mg/kg b.w./d p.o.). In rabbit dams a decrease in body weight gain in the high-dose group (1000 mg/kg b.w./d p.o.) and a dose-dependent reduction in food intake from 200 mg/kg b.w./d p.o. onwards were noted. No further disturbances were observed in the behaviour of the rat and rabbit dams. External appearance, faeces, consumption of drinking water and macroscopical inspection during autopsy did not indicate any influence of the test compound. No retardations or malformations were seen even at the highest tested dose levels (rat: 2000 mg/kg b.w./d p.o.; rabbit: 1000 mg/kg b.w./d p.o.).},

After single oral application of the maximum dose of 10 g benzalazine/kg b.w. to rats no pathological findings concerning clinical signs, body weight, food consumption and macroscopical post mortem findings could be observed (LD50 > 10000 mg/kg b.w.). The 24-h LD50 values for benzalazine after single intraperitoneal application were determined as 755 mg/kg b.w. in female rats and 1200 mg/kg b.w. in male rats. The oral administration of benzalazine at 2000 mg/kg b.w./d or more for 4 weeks to rats gave rise to slight sedation, a reduction in body weight increase, increased organ weights (heart, kidneys, suprarenal glands, spleen) and dose-related histopathological findings (liver, kidneys, heart, thyroid gland, duodenum, spleen, suprarenal glands, testes). The daily dose of 500 mg benzalazine/kg b.w. for 4 weeks was without any effects under these experimental conditions. In acute local tolerance studies in rabbits, benzalazine is to be considered as a mild irritant agent for skin (employing an occlusive patch for 24 h) and eye. After a 10-day intra-rectal application of benzalazine to rabbits no substance-related changes at the application sites in the colon were observed.},

Except slight changes in the urinary status (decreased pH value and increased specific gravity) from 900 mg/kg b.w./d p.o. onwards, which were probably substance related, no further intolerance reactions were observed. The urine had a dark-yellow colour which was probably an indication of metabolites of benzalazine or benzalazine itself which were excreted via the urine. Behaviour, external appearance, body weight gain, food and water consumption, haematology, clinical biochemistry, organ weight analysis, macroscopic and microscopic examinations revealed no substance-related influence. Therefore, on the basis of the results obtained, it is concluded that the non-toxic dose level in this study is considered to be 300 mg benzalazine/kg b.w./d p.o. following daily administration for 26 weeks.},

We examined the effects of an elemental diet (ED) in Crohn's disease with special reference to the maintenance of remission. Eighty-four patients received total enteral nutrition with the ED (35 to 40 kcal/kg ideal body weight/day) and/or conventional drug treatment for induction of remission. Sixty-one patients in remission were then followed-up with prolonged ED therapy (home elemental enteral hyperalimentation, HEEH) and/or drugs. During the follow-up periods the course of patients receiving HEEH was better than those of patients without HEEH, namely the cumulative continuous remission rates after one, 2 and 4 years were, 94%, 63% and 63% in the group receiving HEEH, 75%, 66% and 66% in the group receiving HEEH and drugs, 63%, 42% and 0% in the group receiving drugs, and 50%, 33% and 0% in the group receiving no maintenance therapy, respectively. In particular, when more than 30 kcal/kg ideal body weight/day of the ED was given, the maintenance of remission was successful in 95% of the patients. These results indicated that ED therapy was effective not only for the induction of remission but also for the maintenance of remission in Crohn's disease.},

This disease is classified among the hypereosinophilic syndromes, and food allergy may be of etiologic importance. Clinically eosinophilic gastroenteritis may present with ascites, malabsorption or gut obstruction. The eosinophilic blood cell count is usually elevated and the erythrocyte sedimentation rate is usually normal or slightly increased. Polyarteritis nodosa, Crohn's disease and nematodal infections of the gut must be excluded. Most patients respond well to corticosteroid therapy and the long-term prognosis is good, even though the disease is chronic in nature.},

Luminal provocation with different antigens in cases of celiac disease and food intolerance not only activated cells in the intestinal mucosa but also increased the leakage from plasma and lymph. Studies of drug absorption elucidated the kinetics of drug transport from intestine to plasma, and basal neurologic effects on ion and bicarbonate transport were determined.},

The patients consisted of 60 with quiescent Crohn's disease who were given LRD (Clinimeal or Ensure Liquid) for maintenance therapy for more than one year (average 2.4 years) after discharge from our institute. On the basis of the quantity of LRD given per day, the patients were classified into three groups: A; O to 799 kcal a day, B; 800 to 1599 kcal a day and C; more than 1600 kcal a day. The remission rate and the avoidance rate of admission were calculated and compared among three groups. The remission rate in group C was significantly higher than those in groups A and B. The avoidance rates of admission in groups B and C were significantly higher than that in group A. These results suggest that drinking of LRD at home is useful for the maintenance of remission in patients with Crohn's disease and that the effect of LRD depends on the quantity of LRD given per day.},

The fat-soluble vitamins A and E were significantly decreased in patients with Crohn's disease compared to controls. Among the water-soluble vitamins, vitamins B1, B2 and B6 and folic acid were more depleted in patients with Crohn's disease than in the controls, whereas vitamins B12 and C, nicotinic acid, and biotin were not different between the two groups, and pantothenic acid was increased in patients with Crohn's disease. In addition, vitamin B2 and nicotinic acid showed a negative correlation with the Crohn's disease activity index. These findings suggest that there is a variety of vitamin deficiencies in Crohn's disease prior to treatment and also that concentrations of some vitamins, such as vitamin B2 and nicotinic acid, may reflect the severity of the disease.},

   abstract = {Anorexia nervosa (AN) and bulimia nervosa (BN) are potentially fatal eating disorders which primarily affect adolescent females. Differentiating eating disorders from primary gastrointestinal (GI) disease may be difficult. GI disorders are common in eating disorder patients, symptomatic complaints being seen in over half. Moreover, many GI diseases sometimes resemble eating disorders. Inflammatory bowel disease, acid peptic diseases, and intestinal motility disorders such as achalasia may mimic eating disorders. However, it is usually possible to distinguish these by applying the diagnostic criteria for eating disorders and by obtaining common biochemical tests. The primary features of AN are profound weight loss due to self starvation and body image distortion; BN is characterized by binge eating and self purging of ingested food by vomiting or laxative abuse. GI complications in eating disorders are common. Recurrent emesis in BN is associated with dental abnormalities, parotid enlargement, and electrolyte disturbances including metabolic alkalosis. Hyperamylasemia of salivary origin is regularly seen, but may lead do an erroneous diagnosis of pancreatitis. Despite the weight loss often seen in eating disorders, serum albumin, cholesterol, and carotene are usually normal. However, serum levels of trace metals such as zinc and copper often are depressed, and hypophosphatemia can occur during refeeding. Patients with eating disorders frequently have gastric emptying abnormalities, causing bloating, postprandial fullness, and vomiting. This usually improves with refeeding, but sometimes treatment with pro-motility agents such as metoclopromide is necessary. Knowledge of the GI manifestations of eating disorders, and a high index of suspicion for one condition masquerading as the other, are required for the correct diagnosis and management of these patients.},

   abstract = {Malnutrition is frequently seen in patients with inflammatory bowel disease, and parenteral or enteral nutrition is considered essential in this patient group. However, many patients with Crohn's disease have difficulties in gaining weight in response to overfeeding, suggesting reduced energy retention. Substrate utilization and nutrient balances as well as changes in body composition were followed in 10 patients with Crohn's disease immediately in the course of remission on low-dose steroid treatment, during an eight-day period of continuous enteral nutrition at constant (protocol 1:1.5-fold basal energy expenditure) and increasing (protocol 2:0.5- to 2.0-fold basal energy expenditure) nutrient supply. Energy, substrate, and nitrogen balances all became positive in response to overfeeding. However, fat was predominantly oxidized at an infusion rate of 1.2 g/kg body wt/day, whereas carbohydrates and proteins were effectively stored. A positive energy balance was reached at an energy infusion rate exceeding 31 kcal/kg body wt/day and corresponding substrate supplies of 1.6, 1.7, and 1.1 g/kg body wt/day for carbohydrates, fat, and protein, respectively. Nitrogen balance normalized at a supply of 0.14 g/kg body wt/day, which also reduced myofibrillar protein breakdown. Considering the relative contributions made by these nutrients in the diets, an accumulation of carbohydrates and protein but a depletion in fat became evident from nutrient balances. In fact, body weight increased by 0.12 kg/day, which was explained by an increased extracellular (+0.18 kg/day) and body cell mass (+0.04 kg/day) at reduced fat mass (-0.10 kg/day). Concomitantly, plasma T3 and insulin secretion both increased, whereas sympathetic nervous system activity decreased with overfeeding. This is contrary to data observed in healthy subjects.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS)},

   abstract = {Experimental investigations have shown alterations of the ileal mucosal surface after specific fat diets resembling early changes in Crohn's disease. An animal experiment in pigs has been conducted. After creation of an anisoperistaltic segment these were fed either a specific fat diet containing chemically processed, partially hydrogenated fats or a low fat control diet over a period of 3 months. Defined areas of the ileal lamina propria were examined by transmission electron microscopy with the underlying question to what extent ultrastructural alterations could be compared to Crohn's disease. In comparison to the control group these areas were characterized by a dense infiltration of "inflammatory" cells like lymphocytes, histiocytes, macrophages and plasma cells indicating a hyperplasia and activation of lympho-plasmocytotic cells. Additionally, a focal prominent infiltration of mast cells with degranulation was observed as well as a dilatation of axons with depletion of axonal organelles in half of the animals after fat-feeding. Compared to patients with Crohn's disease the results show obvious similarities. It is concluded, that chemically processed fats could cause direct stimulation of immunologically-specific and non-specific cells in the lamina propria mucosae or directly injure the intestinal mucosa with secondary infiltration of inflammatory cells into the lamina propria.},

   abstract = {It has been claimed that prolonged remissions of Crohn's disease can be achieved after enteral or parenteral nutrition, by identifying and excluding foods that exacerbate a patient's symptoms. The occurrence of food intolerances were assessed after induction of remission with elemental diet in 42 eligible patients to whom single foods were introduced over five days. Suspect foods were reinvestigated with open and if possible, double blind rechallenge. Fourteen patients (33%) dropped out of the study because of relapse of disease unrelated to food (n = 8) or because of difficulties in complying with the regimen (n = 6). Twenty (48%) of the patients identified food sensitivities whereas eight (19%) did not. Seventeen of the patients who identified food sensitivities had an open rechallenge with recurrence of symptoms in 10 (24% of total). Food sensitivity was confirmed in three patients on double blind challenge. There was no significant difference in the duration of remission between patients who did or did not identify food sensitivities. During the study three cases of intolerance to the formula diet, and one of severe salicylate sensitivity were encountered. In conclusion food sensitivities are evident after treatment of Crohn's disease with elemental diet but are variable, often do not persist, and are of insufficient importance to warrant putting all patients through elimination diets.},

Morphometric analysis was performed on routinely processed duodenal biopsies. Cell proliferation was evaluated by means of in vitro bromodeoxyuridine uptake. The results were compared with those obtained in five healthy controls. After parenteral nutrition, patients showed significantly lower villus height and crypt depth than those of controls and a normal bromodeoxyuridine labeling index. After 2 months of refeeding, villus and crypt returned to normal, and the labeling index was increased. After 12 months of oral refeeding, labeling index, villus height, and crypt depth were similar to those of controls. The patient with the short bowel showed a number of cells per unit length of villus and crypt significantly greater than those of the controls and of the patient who underwent shorter intestinal resection. In human duodenal mucosa, (1) hypoplasia develops after long-term total parenteral nutrition; (2) mucosal recovery occurs through an increased cell proliferation after oral refeeding; and (3) extensive small bowel resection determines the development of relative hyperplasia.},

A reduction in the frequency of bowel movements (5.0 +/- 1.4 vs. 4.1 +/- 2.3 evacuations/day, p < 0.01) and in the BEST Index (193 +/- 32 vs. 168 +/- 59, p < 0.05) as compared to baseline was registered. After this initial phase, the patients were allocated in randomized order to the control group (n = 7) receiving placebo, or to the verum group (n = 10) receiving S.b.(250 mg t.i.d.) for 7 weeks, while the basic treatment was maintained. The group treated with S.b. showed a significant reduction in the frequency of bowel movements in the tenth week, to 3.3 +/- 1.2 evacuations per day, and in the BEST Index, to 107 +/- 85. In the control group taking placebo, however, this effect was not observed. By contrast, the frequency of bowel movements and the BEST Index rose again in the tenth week until reaching initial values (4.6 +/- 1.9 evacuations daily and 180 +/- 61, respectively). No adverse drug events were observed. In order to confirm these positive effects of S.b. in patients with Crohn's disease, further controlled multicenter trials in a larger patient population should be performed.},

Energy and protein intakes were lower in patients with weight loss than in those with stable weight (P < 0.01). In the former group, food restrictions were more numerous (P < 0.01) and visual analog scales showed less hunger, decreased appetite, and fewer sensations of pleasure related to eating, as compared with the other group (P < 0.01). Food intake reduction was also related to depressive mood and medical advice. However, there was no difference between groups in fecal energy wasting and resting energy expenditure. Weight loss in Crohn's disease may be due to a decrease in food intake rather than to an increase in energy cost of the disease. Thus, focus of attention on the diet is crucial to prevent malnutrition.},

   abstract = {Elemental diet is as effective in producing remission of Crohn's disease (CD) as is corticosteroid treatment, but most patients relapse soon after resumption of a normal diet. We have investigated the efficacies of dietary modification and oral corticosteroids in maintaining remission achieved with elemental diet. In a multicentre trial, 136 patients with active CD were started on elemental diet and other treatment was withdrawn. 43 (31%) declined to continue elemental diet for 14 days, but 78 (84%) of the remaining 93 achieved remission and were randomly assigned corticosteroids (38) or diet (40). Corticosteroid treatment started at 40 mg prednisolone daily, which was tapered and stopped after 12 weeks; that group received dietary advice on healthy eating. The diet group received "tapered" placebo and were instructed to introduce one new food daily, excluding any that precipitated symptoms. Assessment of progress for up to 2 years was made by physicians unaware of group assignment. Intention-to-treat analysis showed median lengths of remission of 3.8 (interquartile range 5.0) months in the corticosteroid group and 7.5 (15.3) months on diet, and relapse rates at 2 years, adjusted for withdrawals, of 79% and 62%, respectively (p = 0.048). Clinical improvement in the diet group was associated with significant changes in plasma albumin and alpha 1-antichymotrypsin concentrations and erythrocyte sedimentation rate. Food intolerances discovered were predominantly to cereals, dairy products, and yeast. Diet provides a further therapeutic strategy in active Crohn's disease.},

Ten children were treated by enteral feeding (Nutrison Standard, Nutricia), and nine received corticosteroids. Both treatment regimens lasted 11 weeks. The activity of Crohn's disease was similar in both groups before the commencement of the treatment. Clinical symptoms and signs, as judged by the pediatric Crohn's disease activity index and measurements relating to inflammatory activity (erythrocyte sedimentation rate, C-reactive protein, blood leukocyte and platelet count, and serum immunoglobulins G and A) and to nutritional status (concentrations of serum albumin, prealbumin, hemoglobin) improved rapidly and significantly with as little as 2 weeks' treatment in both treatment groups. In both groups, there was one relapse within 8 weeks after discontinuation of treatment, and one patient in both groups was operated on during the treatment period. During the routine follow-up after the trial (0.3-2.5 years; mean, 1.3 years) five of the corticosteroid group experienced a clinical relapse, whereas only one from the enteral feeding group relapsed. No side effects of enteral feeding were seen. Enteral feeding with a whole protein-based formula proved to be as effective as high-dose corticosteroid in the treatment of the acute phase of Crohn's disease and may prove to be the treatment of choice in pediatric patients with acute Crohn's disease.},

The mean energy intake was 1,764 KJ/day (420 kcal/day) lower in patients during relapse than controls (p < 0.05). All 24 children entered a randomised controlled trial of high-dose steroids compared to an elemental diet. The elemental diet was well tolerated orally in most cases; only one patient required nasogastric administration. There was a similar improvement in disease activity and duration of remission in both groups regardless of the site of disease. Subsequent growth velocity was significantly better in the group treated with the elemental diet despite a greater and more sustained increase in energy intake in the group treated with steroids. Reintroduction of specific foods in the elemental diet group initially caused symptoms in three children but were subsequently tolerated. During remission, there was no significant difference in energy intake, but vegetables were consumed significantly less frequently (p < 0.01) and confectionery significantly more frequently (p < 0.05) when patients were compared with their own siblings.},

   abstract = {The zinc deficiency syndrome, also called enteropathic acrodermatitis, has been mostly observed in those pathologies of the gastroenteric system characterized by grave food shortages during long term TPN in association with inflammatory intestinal pathologies. The authors believe this to be caused of such syndrome, that in the case in question is demonstrated before the normal period described in the literature to be caused by both increased request related to TPN and a greater loss or less absorption due to intestinal phlogosis. The case described has been noted in a general surgery division in a young patient suffering from Crohn's disease for many years in treatment with medical therapy and now complicated by perianal abscess following burrowing on the outside subjected and therefore in treatment with artificial parenteral nutrition pre and post operative. Such pathology to be due when to begin a symptomatology characterized by consciousness alteration, diarrhoea, vesicular squamous cutaneous lesions around orifices, often infected by bacteria and mycosis in patients in treatment nutritional artificial continued for digestive apparatus diseases. The knowledge of this syndrome and its diagnosis lead, through integrative therapy, to its resolution in a short time. The authors describe the course of a clinical case occurred to then and ended with the patient's recovery. They underline the risks of ignoring this pathology.},
