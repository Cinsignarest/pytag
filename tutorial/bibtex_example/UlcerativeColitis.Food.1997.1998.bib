   abstract = {The colonization of Lactobacillus rhamnosus GG (ATCC 53103, henceforth L.GG) in five human colonoscopy patients was studied. The test subjects consumed whey drink fermented with the bacterium for 12 d before the colonoscopy. The presence of L.GG was subsequently checked both in the faecal samples and in the colonic biopsies obtained from various locations in the large intestine. In all patients L.GG was the dominant faecal lactic acid bacterium as a result of the administration. In four patients L.GG could also be recovered from the biopsies, while with one patient (suffering from ulcerative colitis diagnosed during the colonoscopy) no L.GG was detected in the biopsy samples. The results suggest that L.GG is able to adhere in vivo to the colon. Study of the faecal samples alone is apparently not sufficient for elucidation of the gastrointestinal ecology of probiotic bacteria.},

   abstract = {To examine prospectively dietary fiber calculated from food composition values based on analytic techniques and specific dietary fiber types in relation to risk of diverticular disease, we analyzed data from a prospective cohort of 43,881 U.S. male health professionals 40-75 y of age at base line; subjects were free of diagnosed diverticular disease, colon or rectal polyps, ulcerative colitis and cancer. The insoluble component of fiber was inversely associated with risk of diverticular disease relative risk (RR) = 0. 63, 95% confidence interval (CI), 0.44-0.91, P for trend = 0.02, and this association was particularly strong for cellulose (RR = 0.52, 95% CI, 0.36-0.75, P for trend = 0.002). The association between diverticular disease and total dietary fiber intake calculated from the AOACstandards method was not appreciably different from results using the Southgate or Englyst method [for AOAC method, RR = 0.60, 95% CI, 0.41-0.87; for Southgate method, RR = 0.61, 95% CI, 0.42-0. 88; for Englyst method, RR = 0.60, 95% CI, 0.42-0.87, for the highest quintiles]. Our findings provide evidence for the hypothesis that a diet high in dietary fiber decreases the risk of diverticular disease, and this result was not sensitive to the use of different analytic techniques to define dietary fiber. Our findings suggest that the insoluble component of fiber was significantly associated with a decreased risk of diverticular disease, and this inverse association was particularly strong for cellulose.},

   abstract = {BACKGROUND: Although suggested, it has never been convincingly documented that food sensitivity is of pathogenetic importance in chronic inflammatory bowel disease. However, many patients may relate their gastrointestinal symptoms to specific food items ingested and may restrict their diet accordingly. METHODS: A questionnaire was sent to all patients with chronic inflammatory bowel disease who attended the outpatient clinic, Medical Dept., Roskilde County Hospital in Koge, Denmark, in the year 1993. The patients were asked whether they had problems with any particular food item and, if so, to describe the symptoms experienced from it. A control group of 70 healthy persons were included. RESULTS: Among 189 patients, 132 (70%) responded. One hundred and thirty had completed the questionnaire, 52 males and 78 females aged 13-89 years (median, 43 years). Fifty-three (41%) had Crohn's disease (CD), 69 (53%) ulcerative colitis (UC), and 8 (6%) unclassified colitis. Forty-one patients (31 CD, 10 UC) were-operated on; 51 (19 CD, 32 UC) had disease activity. Sixty-five per cent of the patients and 14% of the controls reported being intolerant to one or more food items (P < 0.0001). The intolerance covered a wide range of food products. The commonest symptoms among patients were diarrhoea, abdominal pain, and meteorism and among controls, regurgitation. Food intolerance was equally common in CD (66%) and UC (64%) and was not related to previous operation, disease activity or disease location. CONCLUSION: Most patients with chronic inflammatory bowel intolerance disease feel intolerant to different food items and may restrict their diet accordingly. The frequency and pattern of food intolerance did not differ between patients with CD and UC. The food intolerance was probably unspecific rather than of pathogenetic importance.},

OBJECTIVES: The aim of the study was to investigate the blood levels of A, C and E vitamins, Beta-carotene, zinc, and selenium in 249 patients with precanceroses (atrophic gastritis, hyperplastic polyp of the stomach, adenomas of the stomach and colorectum, ulcerative colitis), 96 patients with carcinoma of the stomach or colorectum, and to compare them with a control group of 130 people. RESULTS: We have discovered the frequency of decreased average levels of micronutrients in patients with precanceroses as follows: vitamin C > vitamins E and A > selenium > beta carotene. In all groups of patients with carcinoma the average levels of vitamins and Beta-carotene were significantly decreased, the level of selenium has decreased only in the group of gastric carcinoma. The copper level was increased in the group of ulcerative colitis and in all groups with carcinoma. CONCLUSION: The results indicate that in the primary prevention of these malign diseases it is necessary to improve the levels of the presented micronutrients in the population of the Slovak Republic by increasing the intake of fruit, vegetables and other sources of nutrition, the secondary prevention in persons with precanceroses requires an appropriate intermittent supplementation of micronutrients (chemoprevention).

A total of 120 female Wistar-Tecpar rats aged 180 days and weighing on average 290 g were studied. Inflammatory disease of the colon was induced with 10% acetic acid and the animals were divided at random into four groups of 30 rats each. Group A, which received a standard diet and no type of treatment, was used as control. Group B received an elemental diet supplemented with glutamine. Group C received a standard diet and daily 5-ASA enemas, 15 mg/ml. Group D received an elemental diet supplemented with glutamine plus daily 5-ASA enemas. Ten animals were picked at random from each group and sacrificed on the 7th, 14th and 21st days of treatment after intravenous injection of Evans blue for visualization of the damaged areas. Changes in weight and the macroscopic aspects of the abdominal cavity and the colon were evaluated and the involved segment was resected for macroscopic and microscopic analysis. The highest weight loss occurred in group D animals on the 14th and 21st days. The number of complications was larger in group A animals, with intestinal perforation, peritonitis and death (P = 0.0053). Complications were of equal intensity in groups B and C and no complications were detected in group D. Macroscopic evaluation showed a lower frequency of ulcers on the 7th day in group B (P = 0.0113) and D (P = 0.0294). Group D animals showed a significantly reduced frequency of ulcers on the 14th day (P = 0.0140). Microscopic examination showed a better evolution in groups B (P = 0.0113) and D (P = 0.0294) on the 7th day and in group D on 14th day (P = 0.0105) compared to A. We conclude that the combination of an elemental diet containing glutamine and treatment with 5-ASA leads to more rapid healing of the colon lesions induced by 10% acetic acid in rats.},

The aim of the study was to examine the presence of eosinophil and mast cell mediators in human stool samples of patients with inflammatory bowel disorders. We measured eosinophil cationic protein (ECP), eosinophil protein X (EPX), methylhistamine, and alpha 1-antitrypsin in fecal samples of 136 patients (62 Crohn's disease, 24 ulcerative colitis, 15 intestinal food allergy, 35 other gastrointestinal diseases) and 8 healthy controls. We found strongly elevated levels of ECP (median: 29, range: 0.4-1783 ng/g feces) and EPX (803, 10-33,225 ng/g) in all patients groups compared to controls (ECP: 1.5, 0.5-55 ng/g; EPX: 235, 12-746 ng/g). Similar results, albeit less pronounced, were obtained for methylhistamine and alpha 1-antitrypsin. Particularly high concentrations of ECP and EPX were found in patients with active mucosal inflammation. In conclusion, the study presents an easy and reliable method for the detection of fecal ECP, EPX, and methylhistamine and may provide a tool to gain insight into the pathogenesis of inflammatory bowel diseases and have potential as diagnostic test.},

The aim of this study was to examine the immune reactivity of a spontaneously colitic mouse strain, C3H/HeJBir, to epithelial, food, and enteric bacterial Ags. Serum Ab responses of colitic C3H/HeJBir and noncolitic parental C3H/HeJ mice were measured by enhanced chemiluminescence Western blotting. No reactivity to epithelial or food Ags was detected. However, the sera from C3H/HeJBir mice had a reproducible banding pattern on Western blot to bacterial Ags, whereas sera from C3H/HeJ mice did not. Only a small, highly selected number of enteric bacterial Ags were recognized. There were major differences in the degree of recognition of different bacterial strains, marked by remarkably few Abs to Ags of the major anaerobes of the bacterial flora. The serum Abs detected on immunoblot were primarily IgG2a, suggesting a Th1 response. Comparison of sera reactivity to histopathologic severity showed an inverse relationship: one third of young C3H/HeJBir mice during the peak of colitis produced Abs to bacterial Ags, while later in life, when the colitis had resolved, 96% produced Abs. These data are consistent with an abnormal immune reactivity to enteric bacterial flora in C3H/HeJBir mice, a reactivity that is highly selective considering the abundant bacterial Ags present in the colon lumen. We postulate that this reactivity plays a role in the pathogenesis of colitis in these mice.},

   abstract = {The role of diet in the aetiology and pathogenesis of ulcerative colitis (UC) remains uncertain. Impaired utilization by colonocytes of butyrate, a product of bacterial fermentation of dietary carbohydrates escaping digestion, may be important. Sulphur-fermenting bacteria may be involved in this impaired utilization. Oxidative stress probably mediates tissue injury but is probably not of causative importance. Patients with UC are prone to malnutrition and its detrimental effects. However, there is no role for total parenteral nutrition and bowel rest as primary therapy for UC. The maintenance of adequate nutrition is very important, particularly in the peri-operative patient. In the absence of massive bleeding, perforation, toxic megacolon or obstruction, enteral rather than parenteral nutrition should be the mode of choice. Nutrients may be beneficial as adjuvant therapy. Butyrate enemas have improved patients with otherwise recalcitrant distal colitis in small studies. Non-cellulose fibre supplements are of benefit in rats with experimental colitis. Eicosapentaenoic acid in fish oil has a steroid-sparing effect which, although modest, is important, particularly in terms of reducing the risk of osteoporosis, but it seems to have no role in the patient with inactive disease. gamma-Linolenic acid and anti-oxidants also are showing promise. Nutrients may also modify the increased risk of colorectal carcinoma. Oxidative stress can damage tissue DNA but there are no data published at present on possible protection from oral anti-oxidants. Butyrate protects against experimental carcinogenesis in rats with experimental colitis. Folate supplementation is weakly associated with decreased incidence of cancer in UC patients when assessed retrospectively. Vigilance should be maintained for increased micronutrient requirements and supplements given as appropriate. Calcium and low-dose vitamin D should be given to patients on long-term steroids and folate to those on sulphasalazine.},

The purpose of this study was to assess the effects of an enteral nutritional formula containing supplemental oligosaccharides, gum arabic and fish oil on serum metabolite profiles, haematology, plasma and red blood cell membrane phospholipid fatty acid profiles, urinary constituent, and safety in healthy human adult males. 30 subjects were randomly assigned to one of two treatments, a control formula (n = 10) and an ulcerative colitis nutritional formula (UCNF; n = 20). Formulas contained comparable levels of protein, fat and non-structural carbohydrates. Daily intake of the formulas provided nutrients to meet or exceed the recommended daily allowance. Intake was recorded daily while blood and urine samples were collected weekly on days 0, 7 and 14. Certain subjects consuming large quantities of the UCNF experienced some abdominal distention, gas and loose stools. Sole source intake of the UCNF was safe over 14 days as assessed by routine measurements of serum metabolite profiles, haematology and urinalysis compared with subjects fed the control formula. Substantial decreases in plasma and red blood cell phospholipid 18:2n-6 and increases in 20:5n-3 and 22:6n-3 within 1 wk of feeding the UCNF were noted.},

   abstract = {BACKGROUND: Smoking, probably due to nicotine, has a bivalent effect on inflammatory bowel disease, ameliorating disease activity in ulcerative colitis and with a deleterious effect on Crohn's disease. The effect of nicotine patches in ulcerative colitis is controversial. AIM: To investigate the effect of chronic nicotine use in a rat model of colitis. METHODS: Colitis was induced in Sprague-Dawley rats by rectal administration of 30 mg trinitrobenzene sulphonic acid (TNBS) in 50% ethanol. Nicotine was dissolved in drinking water (2.5, 12.5, 25 and 250 microg/ml), with rats drinking ad libitum. Nicotine administration started 10 days prior to damage induction and had no effect on weight gain or daily food intake of rats. Rats were sacrificed 1 and 5 days after TNBS administration, their colons resected, rinsed, weighed, damage assessed macroscopically (mm2) and microscopically and tissue processed for myeloperoxidase (MPO) and nitric oxide synthase (NOS) activities, leukotriene B4 (LTB4), prostaglandin E2 (PGE2) generation and interleukin-1 (IL-1) serum levels. RESULTS: Nicotine, by itself, caused no damage to the colon. Nicotine had a dose-dependent bivalent effect on colitis, significantly reducing macroscopic damage from 983 +/- 10 mm2 on TNBS alone to 429 +/- 118 mm2 on TNBS plus 12.5 microg/ml of nicotine, and escalating to 1086 +/- 262 mm2 on 250 microg/ml of nicotine. Segmental weight declined significantly (from 2.4 +/- 0.2 to 1.65 +/- 0.20 g/10 cm), on 12.5 microg/ml nicotine, as did MPO activity (from 3.2 +/- 0.4 to 0.7 +/- 0.1 units/g). All these parameters returned to the levels of TNBS alone when the dose of nicotine was increased to 250 microg/ml. Nicotine had no effect on NOS activity, PGE2 generation and serum IL-1 levels, but increased LTB4 generation. CONCLUSIONS: Nicotine has a dose-dependent bivalent effect on TNBS-induced colitis which is not due to reduction in IL-1 serum levels or PGE2 generation, and is not NOS-mediated.},

   abstract = {OBJECTIVE: To investigate the effects of inulin and oligofructose on cholesterol absorption and excretion of cholesterol, bile acids, energy, nitrogen and minerals in man. DESIGN: Double-blind cross-over study. SETTING: Metabolic kitchen with policlinic visits, Sahlgrenska Hospital, Goteborg, Sweden. SUBJECTS: Patients with conventional ileostomy because of ulcerative colitis. INTERVENTIONS: 7 g of inulin, 17 g of oligofructose and 7 g of sucrose were added to a controlled diet during three experimental periods of three days each. Ileostomy effluents were collected and analysed. Differences between experimental and control diet were investigated with the Wilcoxon's sign and values test. RESULTS: Inulin and oligofructose were recovered in the ileostomy effluent to 88% (95% CI, 76-100%) and 89% (64-114%) respectively. Dry solid excretion increased by 14.4 g (11.3-17.5) on inulin, and by 14.7 g (13.0-16.4 g) on oligofructose and energy excretion increased 245 kJ (190-307 kJ) on inulin and 230 kJ (214-315 kJ) on oligofructose compared to control diet (P < 0.05). Cholesterol absorption, excretion of cholesterol, bile acids, nitrogen, fat, calcium, magnesium, zinc and iron were not affected by inulin and oligofructose. CONCLUSIONS: Inulin and oligofructose are not digested in the small intestine. They do not affect mineral excretion and hence hardly mineral absorption. They do not increase fat or nitrogen excretion from the small intestine. Any physiological effect of inulin and oligofructose is probably mediated through other mechanisms than altered excretion from the small intestine.},

   abstract = {1. Mass balance studies were carried out in fasted ileostomy subjects (n = 5) given an oral physiological dose (10 mg) of beta-carotene [all-trans: 9-cis, 84:16 (w/w)] dispersed in vegetable oil. Blood and ileal effluent samples were collected and analysed for beta-carotene. 2. Results showed that 90% (range 97.0-74.3%) of the total beta-carotene was absorbed without measurable perturbation of plasma total beta-carotene concentration, or change in the all-trans: 9-cis beta-carotene ratio. Peak loss of beta-carotene in ileal effluent occurred at 4.9 h (range 2.9-8.4 h) postingestion, and no further loss was detected after 5.4-12.4 h, depending upon the individual. Comparison of the ratio of all trans-beta-carotene to 9 cis-beta-carotene in the test meal and effluent indicated that isomerization did not occur during passage through the gastrointestinal tract and that both isomers were similarly absorbed. However, the all-trans: 9-cis beta-carotene ratio of the plasma did not change. Reasoned assumptions allowed the construction of a mathematical model of plasma beta-carotene disposal. 3. It is concluded that physiological doses of isolated all-trans and 9-cis beta-carotene are well absorbed without necessarily causing detectable excursions in plasma beta-carotene concentrations, or altering the ratio of all-trans to 9-cis beta-carotene. Isomerization of beta-carotene does not occur during passage through the gastrointestinal tract. Absorbed beta-carotene is rapidly cleared from the plasma to an unobservable pool at a rate similar to that of chylomicron triacylglycerol.},

   abstract = {PURPOSE: To determine the dietary practices of the pediatric inflammatory bowel disease population at the Children's Hospital of the Hamilton Health Sciences Corporation and the reported effectiveness of those diets. PATIENTS AND METHODS: A questionnaire mailed to 153 pediatric patients was returned by 125 patients (76 Crohn's disease [CD] and 49 ulcerative colitis [UC] patients)--an 82% response rate. RESULTS: The median age of respondents was 13 years, and 62% were male. Ninety per cent and 71% of CD and UC patients, respectively, had changed their diets since diagnosis. Caloric supplements (eg, BOOST [Mead Johnson Nutritionals]), sole source nutrition, low fibre and lactose-free diets were used by more than 15% of CD patients, whereas lactose-free, nonspicy, low acid, additive-free, caloric supplement and low fibre diets were used by more than 15% of UC patients. A diet supplement was more commonly used in CD patients (P < 0.05) and an additive-free diet in UC patients. Corn and corn products, nuts, milk and bran were avoided by more than 20% of CD and UC patients; however, more CD than UC patients avoided corn and corn products. In addition, UC patients (more than 20%) also avoided tomato, other dairy (nonfluid milk-based products and foods containing milk products), chocolate, cheese, wheat, tomato sauces and fruit juice. A benefit was reported for 103 of 141 reported diets, with the most commonly alleviated symptoms being abdominal pain, diarrhea and flatulence. CONCLUSION: Many children with inflammatory bowel disease have altered their diets to manage their disease and have attributed symptomatic relief to these diets.},

No specific dietary toxin or antigen has been identified to have an etiologic role in either ulcerative colitis or Crohn's disease. A possible modulating effect of omega-3 polyunsaturated fatty acids on intestinal inflammation is being investigated. Most prevalent among the nutritional consequences of inflammatory bowel disease is weight loss, for which inadequate caloric intake is primarily responsible. Impairment of linear growth and associated delay in pubertal development commonly complicate childhood Crohn's disease. The two major etiologic factors are chronic undernutrition and direct effects of inflammatory mediators secreted from the inflamed gut. Recent studies have incriminated interleukin-6. Treatment of intestinal inflammation and provision of adequate nutrition are of paramount importance in preventing or remedying growth impairment. Exclusive enteral nutrition using formulated food is efficacious primary therapy of active Crohn's disease, although the mode of action is poorly understood.},

   abstract = {During the past 20 years there has been growing interest in the importance of nutritional factors in the pathogenesis of inflammatory bowel disease. There are so far no definite links between ulcerative colitis and diet, but links with Crohn's disease have been studied by both epidemiologists and clinicians. Epidemiological studies, although retrospective, have suggested that patients with Crohn's disease eat more sugar and sweets that control individuals; however, when dietary sugar is restricted, there is little clinical benefit. The clinical approach to nutrition in Crohn's disease has been by the use of elemental diets, which will produce symptomatic and objective remission in up to 90% of compliant patients. Those who return to normal eating soon relapse but, in some studies, have enjoyed prolonged remission on exclusion diets. The foods excluded have been not sugar, but predominantly cereals, dairy products and yeast. Attention has now switched to the possible harmful role of fat in Crohn's disease. The efficacy of elemental feeds appears to depend not on the presentation of nitrogen but on the amount of long chain triglyceride present. Increases in recent years in the frequency of Crohn's disease in Japan have been correlated with increased dietary fat intake, and a recent study suggested that W-3 fatty acids, which are metabolized by immunomodulatory leukotrienes and prostaglandins, may have a beneficial role to play. The links between nutrition and Crohn's disease have now become strong and the role of fat may be the most exciting of all.},

This article reviews much of the research that has evaluated the role of diet in the causation, primary treatment, and adjunctive therapy of both ulcerative colitis (UC) and Crohn's disease (CD). Benefits have been demonstrated in the use of elemental diets or polymeric diets in CD in both acute flare up or maintenance of IBD. A careful team approach can overcome problems in implementing nutritional therapy. Nutrition also has a critical benefit in postoperative CD and perioperative UC. Numerous easily corrected, nutritional abnormalities are often overlooked in patients with IBD, which may have significant consequences. Nutritional therapy may have a central place in the hierarchy of treatment in IBD and further research is critical in this area to better define the benefits of nutrition in IBD.},

   abstract = {E. coli O157:H7 is a food-borne adulterant that can cause hemorrhagic ulcerative colitis and hemolytic uremic syndrome. Faced with an increasing risk of foods contaminated with E. coli O157:H7, food safety officials are seeking improved methods to detect and isolate E. coli O157:H7 in hazard analysis and critical control point systems in meat- and poultry-processing plants. A colony lift immunoassay was developed to facilitate the positive identification and quantification of E. coli O157:H7 by incorporating a simple colony lift enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay with filter monitors and traditional culture methods. Polyvinylidene difluoride (PVDF) membranes (Millipore, Bedford, Mass.) were prewet with methanol and were used to make replicates of every bacterial colony on agar plates or filter monitor membranes that were then reincubated for 15 to 18 h at 36 +/- 1 degree C, during which the colonies not only remained viable but were reestablished. The membranes were dried, blocked with blocking buffer (Kirkegaard and Perry Laboratories [KPL], Gaithersburg, Md.), and exposed for 7 min to an affinity-purified horseradish peroxidase-labeled goat anti-E. coli O157 antibody (KPL). The membranes were washed, exposed to a 3,3',5,5'-tetramethylbenzidine membrane substrate (TMB; KPL) or aminoethyl carbazole (AEC; Sigma Chemical Co., St. Louis, Mo.), rinsed in deionized water, and air dried. Colonies of E. coli O157:H7 were identified by either a blue (via TMB) or a red (via AEC) color reaction. The colored spots on the PVDF lift membrane were then matched to their respective parent colonies on the agar plates or filter monitor membranes. The colony lift immunoassay was tested with a wide range of genera in the family Enterobacteriaceae as well as different serotypes within the E. coli genus. The colony lift immunoassay provided a simple, rapid, and accurate method for confirming the presence of E. coli O157:H7 colonies isolated on filter monitors or spread plates by traditional culture methods. An advantage of using the colony lift immunoassay is the ability to test every colony serologically on an agar plate or filter monitor membrane simultaneously for the presence of the E. coli O157 antigen. This colony lift immunoassay has recently been successfully incorporated into a rapid-detection, isolation, and quantification system for E. coli O157:H7, developed in our laboratories for retail meat sampling.},

We evaluated the effects of perioperative biosynthetic growth hormone (GH) treatment on short- and long-term changes in body composition and on nutritional intake. Patients with ulcerative colitis undergoing IAA surgery were randomly assigned to double-blind treatment with placebo (n=12) or 6 IU GH twice daily (n=12) from 2 d before to 7 d after the operation. Examinations were from 2 d before to 9 d after the operation and on days 30 and 90. Body composition was assessed with a dual-energy X-ray absorptiometry scanner. The 2 groups had similar nutritional intakes. On postoperative day 7, placebo-treated patients had lost 4.2 kg (95% CI: 3.0, 5.4) total tissue mass, 3.6 kg (2.1, 5.1) lean tissue mass, and 0.5 kg (-0.1, 1.2) fat mass. These reductions persisted 3 mo later. Compared with placebo, GH improved nitrogen balance, changes in lean tissue mass [gain of 4.0 kg (1.9, 6.0), P=0.001], and changes in total tissue mass [gain of 3.2 kg (1.6, 4.9), P=0.001], but increased the loss of fat mass [loss of 0.7 kg (0.0, 1.5), P=0.049] on postoperative day 7. Three months later, the placebo-treated patients had lost 2.4 kg (0.7, 4.2) more lean tissue mass than GH-treated patients (P=0.009), whereas changes in total tissue and fat mass were not significantly different. Hence, GH treatment enhanced the long-term regain of lean tissue mass.},

   abstract = {Malnutrition is a very common situation in patients inflammatory with intestinal disease (IID), which can be caused by a multitude of factors. It has been shown that nutritional support not only improves the nutritional condition of the patients, but in Crohn's disease it also has an effect on the activity of the disease, although this effect is smaller than that of steroids. Elemental diets are no more efficient than polymeric diets except under very special circumstances, but they are more expensive and patients tolerate them worse. A digestive pause is not recommended unless there is an absolute contraindication for the use of the digestive tract. Therefore, parenteral nutrition, which is more expensive and can cause serious complications, will be reserved for very specific indications. The use of fish oil supplements, either because it competes with arachidonic acid and prevents the initiation of the inflammatory cascade, or because it decreases the production of cytokines, has shown to be potentially useful in inflammatory intestinal disease, and this must be confirmed by further studies. Short chain fatty acids enemas have shown promising results in distal ulcerative colitis but the lack of homogeneity in the studies makes it necessary for these results to be consolidated in new studies. Nutritional support is especially interesting in children with inflammatory intestinal disease given that the growth retardation which is often seen in severe cases, can be controlled by adequate enteral or parenteral diets.},

The aim of this study was to evaluate the effects of feeding GBF or germinated gramineous seeds on experimental ulcerative colitis. Sprague-Dawley rats that received 3% dextran sulfate sodium in their diets were used as an experimental colitis model. The effects of sulfasalazine, a drug used to treat inflammatory bowel disease, were compared with those of GBF. After rats had consumed diets containing GBF or various aleurone and scutellum fractions, mucosal damage; the content of mucosal protein, RNA, and DNA in the colo-rectum; and serum interleukin-8 and alpha1-acid glycoprotein levels were assessed. GBF and germinated seeds more effectively prevented bloody diarrhea and mucosal damage in colitis compared with controls and rats receiving sulfasalazine, but non-germinated samples did not have a protective effect. GBF increased mucosal protein and RNA content in the colitis model. The consumption of GBF appears to prevent inflammation in a colitis model, and its effect seems to be related to the germination process. GBF and germinated seeds have the potential to serve as nutritional therapy for ulcerative colitis.},

   abstract = {BACKGROUND: Aminosalicylates are used as standard treatment for maintaining remission in ulcerative colitis. As yet, there is no other existing alternative with proven efficacy. In light of the hypothesis that the intestinal environment may contribute to the pathophysiology of ulcerative colitis, a trial was conducted to test the effects of probiotic treatment with an oral preparation of non-pathogenic E. coli. METHODS: A total of 120 patients with inactive ulcerative colitis were included in a double-blind, double-dummy study comparing mesalazine 500 mg t.d.s. to an oral preparation of viable E. coli strain Nissle (Serotype 06: K5: H1) for 12 weeks with regard to their efficacy in preventing a relapse of the disease. Study objectives were to assess the equivalence of the clinical activity index (CAI) under the two treatment modalities and to compare relapse rates, relapse-free times and global assessment. RESULTS: The start and end scores of the CAI demonstrated no significant difference (P = 0.12) between the two treatment groups. Relapse rates were 11.3% under mesalazine and 16.0% under E. coli Nissle 1917 (N.S.). Life table analysis showed a relapse-free time of 103 +/- 4 days for mesalazine and 106 +/- 5 days for E. coli Nissle 1917 (N.S.). Global assessment was similar for both groups. Tolerability to the treatment was excellent and did not differ. No serious adverse events were reported. CONCLUSIONS: From the results of this preliminary study, probiotic treatment appears to offer another option for maintenance therapy of ulcerative colitis. Additional support is provided for the hypothesis of a pathophysiological role for the intestinal environment in ulcerative colitis.},

   abstract = {OBJECTIVES: During total parenteral nutrition, gallbladder motility is impaired, resulting in sludge and stone formation. Little is known about gallbladder motility during prolonged enteral nutrition. METHODS: We studied gallbladder motility during continuous enteral nutrition (CEN) in nine hospitalized patients with active inflammatory bowel disease. The patients received a polymeric diet (2000 kcal/24 h) by CEN through a nasogastric tube for a prolonged period. Gallbladder volumes were obtained daily by ultrasonography, starting from day 0 (before CEN) and on 7 consecutive days during CEN. At days 0, 1, 4, and 7, the gallbladder response to i.v. cholecystokinin (CCK-33; 0.5 Ivy Dog unit/kg/h) was studied. Plasma CCK levels were determined at regular intervals by radioimmunoassay. RESULTS: No significant differences were observed on day 0 between patients and a group of nine healthy control subjects in fasting gallbladder volumes (19.4 +/- 2.3 and 19.6 +/- 2.4 cm3, respectively) and gallbladder contraction during CCK infusion (56 +/- 14% and 69 +/- 7%, respectively). During CEN, from day 1 to day 7, mean gallbladder volume remained significantly (p < 0.05) reduced compared with fasting gallbladder volume, and mean plasma CCK levels remained significantly (p < 0.05) increased compared with fasting levels. Although gallbladder volume was significantly reduced during CEN, the gallbladder contractile response to CCK was not affected; at days 1, 4, and 7, gallbladder contraction was 36-57%. CONCLUSIONS: During CEN, 1) gallbladder volume is significantly reduced and plasma CCK levels are significantly increased, 2) these effects are sustained over time (7 days), and 3) the gallbladder remains responsive to exogenous CCK. These results indicate that gallbladder contractility and gallbladder responsiveness to CCK are preserved during prolonged CEN in patients with inflammatory bowel disease.},

   abstract = {Ulcerative colitis is associated with abnormalities of mucin synthesis and secretion, features that may also be associated with malignant change. It has been shown that South Asians in Britain have a high incidence of ulcerative colitis but a low incidence of colorectal carcinoma compared with their European counterparts. Previous studies have demonstrated changes in colonic mucin sialylation and sulphation in both South Asian and European cases with ulcerative colitis. This was related to disease severity, but changes were also found in quiescent disease. The aim of the present study was to determine glycoconjugate expression in the colon from South Asian cases and to compare results with those from a group of affected Europeans. Glycans were identified in formalin-fixed, paraffin-embedded tissue from 17 South Asian patients with ulcerative colitis and from 11 European patients with a similar degree of colitis, by the application of 10 biotinylated lectins. These were directed against a range of sialyl, fucosyl and 2-deoxy, 2-acetamido-galactosyl sequences, using an avidin-peroxidase revealing system and semiquantitative assessment. The South Asian group showed a reduction in the binding of agglutinins from Sambucus nigra in the apical-membranous region of enterocytes, and a decrease in apical Maackia amurensis agglutinin binding. These results suggest that South Asians with ulcerative colitis show a different distribution of terminal N-acetyl neuraminyl residues, either in their alpha-2,6 or alpha-2,3 linkage, compared with their European counterparts. The changes in sialylation observed in European cases compared with normal disease-free control subjects were present in quiescent disease, but were also related to disease activity. Their absence in Asians with ulcerative colitis may imply an inherent, genetically determined variation in this group, which may also play a part in their reduced risk of subsequent malignancy.},

AIM: To investigate the safety and efficacy of GBF in the treatment of ulcerative colitis (UC). METHODS: Ten patients with active UC received 30 g of GBF daily for 4 weeks in an open-label treatment protocol while the baseline anti-inflammatory therapy was continued. The response to treatment was evaluated clinically and endoscopically. Pre- and post-treatment stool concentrations of short-chain fatty acids were measured by gas-liquid chromatography. RESULTS: Patients showed improvement in their clinical activity index scores, with a significant decrease in the score from 6.9+/-1.4 to 2.8+/-1.5 (mean+/-S.E.M., P < 0.05). The endoscopic index score fell from 6.1+/-2.3 to 3.8+/-2.3 (P < 0.0001). Patients showed an increase in stool butyrate concentrations after GBF treatment (P < 0.05). No side-effects were observed. CONCLUSIONS: Oral GBF therapy may have a place in management of ulcerative colitis, but controlled studies are needed to demonstrate its efficacy in the treatment of this disorder.},

   abstract = {Patients with ulcerative colitis have an increased risk for developing colon cancer compared to the general population. The risk is related to the extension of the disease and its duration. This risk is the same for Crohn's colitis patients of equal extension and duration. By chemoprevention we mean the use of specific natural or synthetic chemical agents to reverse, suppress or prevent progression to invasive cancer. The chemopreventive agents for colon cancer are either of natural origin (vitamins, minerals, food constituents) or synthetic chemicals (difluoromethyl ornithine) and pharmaceutical agents (aspirin, oltipraz). Apart from folate, no other agent has so far been used in vivo for the prevention of colon cancer in long-standing inflammatory bowel disease. The use of folate was, however, not primarily intended to prevent cancer but to enhance folate absorption in ulcerative colitis. From retrospective studies, within the framework of cancer surveillance programmes, it became evident that folate supplementation may play a positive role as a chemopreventive agent against colorectal cancer in patients with long-standing, extensive ulcerative colitis. There is also evidence suggesting that folate supplementation may contribute to regulation of rectal cell proliferation in ulcerative colitis patients. There is a real need for multicentre, randomized, prospective clinical studies in order to evaluate the promising role of folate in preventing colorectal cancer in patients with long-standing inflammatory bowel disease.},

This study evaluated the influence of different dietary fatty acids, i.e., monounsaturated, n-3, and n-3 + n-6 polyunsaturated fatty acids, on the recovery of the colonic mucosa histological pattern, the cellular antioxidant defense system of colon, and PGE2 and LTB4 colonic mucosa contents in a model of ulcerative colitis induced by intrarectal administration of trinitrobenzene sulfonic acid. Administration of dietary n-3 polyunsaturated fatty acids led to a minimum stenosis score, a higher histological recovery, lower colon alkaline phosphatase and gamma-glutamyltranspeptidase activities, and lower mucosal levels of PGE2 and LTB4 compared with the other two experimental groups. However, glutathione transferase, glutathione reductase, glutathione peroxidase, and catalase activities were lower in the group treated with n-3 polyunsaturated fatty acids than in the groups fed with either the monounsaturated or the n-6 + n-3 polyunsaturated enriched diet. We conclude that n-3 polyunsaturated fatty acids can be administered to prevent inflammation in ulcerative colitis, but they cause a decrease in the colonic antioxidant defense system, promoting oxidative injury at the site of inflammation.},

   abstract = {Abstract It is often stated that the gastrointestinal tract has a limited number of responses to pathogens. Entirely different agents can produce a similar histopathological reaction. However, the expression of the disease in man is very heterogeneous, it varies with the age of the subject and is to a certain extent genetically determined. For example, food allergy is frequent in childhood and not common in adulthood. The intestinal mucosa in the child with cows milk allergy shows a 'flat' mucosa, which may be indistinguishable of that observed in gluten sensitive entero-pathy or coeliac disease. Subjects with other forms of food allergy may have a morphologically normal small intestinal mucosa, occasionally with increased IgE plasma cells and often only characterised by an increased intestinal permeability. An abnormal intestinal permeability is one of the hallmarks of an inflamed gut, however, subjects with a latent form of coeliac disease have an abnormal permeability only without overt signs of inflammation. Recently, it has become clear that what determines the characteristics of the intestinal inflammatory response is dependent on the cytokines involved during the response and this seems to be the same in the stomach, the small intestine and the colon. A so-called Th1 response, with an increased production of IFN-gamma, TNF-alpha and other pro-inflammatory cytokines, occurs in the stomach when infected by Helicobacter pylori, in the small intestine when the subject with coeliac disease consumes normal bread and during the active phases of Crohn's disease. A Th2 response is characteristic of the allergic subject and there is some evidence that it is the predominant response in subjects with ulcerative colitis. We still do not know the fine-tuning of the cytokine response but IL-12 appears to be a key cytokine in polarising the response to a Thl type. More recently it has become clear that the intestinal mucosa has a unique subset of CD4(+) T cells that secrete TGF-ss (Th3 cells) that provide help for IgA. These cells have downregulatory properties for Th1 cells and therefore play an important role in the active suppression of oral tolerance and IgE response. What determines that an individual develops one of these diseases? It is now clear that these different pathological entities are multifactorial. Different environmental factors and a complex genetic predisposition where more that one gene and more than one chromosome are involved. The extent and severity of the inflammatory response depends on the genetic diversity of the bacteria or the amount of the antigen on the one hand and on the genetic constitution of the host on the other. The abnormal immune response in the human gut is predominantly a Th1-like inflammatory response. This can be elicited by bacteria, peptides, possibly the bacterial flora and some viruses. The recent findings in the pathogenesis of the intestinal inflammatory response will probably alter the therapy of the future.},

RESULTS: Deficiencies were found in 85% of patients with Crohn's disease vs 68% with ulcerative colitis during the course of the disease, predominantly a deficiency of iron and of calcium. Less frequently deficiencies of zinc, protein, cyanocobalamin, and folic acid were found. Elevated liver enzymes were seen in 38% of patients with Crohn's disease vs 27% with ulcerative colitis. In order of frequency: gamma-glutamyl-transferase, ALAT, AP, ASAT, and bilirubin. Gallstones were present in 12% of patients with Crohn's disease and 4% with ulcerative colitis. 6% of patients with Crohn's disease and 4% with ulcerative colitis had kidney stones. CONCLUSIONS: In view of the high frequency of deficiencies in patients with inflammatory bowel disease it seems to be important to check frequently for extraintestinal complications.},

AIM: To investigate the pre-illness diet in patients with recent IBD in comparison with matched population and clinic controls. METHODS: Quantified dietary histories were obtained from 87 patients with recent IBD (54 ulcerative colitis (UC) and 33 Crohn's disease (CD)) and 144 controls. Odds ratios (OR) for IBD were derived for intake levels of various foods. RESULTS: A high sucrose consumption was associated with an increased risk for IBD (OR 2.85 (p = 0.03) against population controls and 5.3 (p = 0.00) against clinic controls). Lactose consumption showed no effect while fructose intake was negatively associated with risk for IBD (NS). Similar trends were noted in UC and CD. A high fat intake was associated with an increased risk for UC; this was particularly marked for animal fat (OR 4.09, p = 0.02) and cholesterol (OR 4.57, p = 0.02). A high intake of fluids (p = 0.04), magnesium (p = 0.04), vitamin C, and fruits (NS) was negatively associated with the risk for IBD, while a positive association was found for retinol (p = 0.01). Most of the findings were similar in UC and CD except for potassium and vegetable consumption which showed a negative association only with risk for CD. CONCLUSIONS: An association was found between pre-illness diet and subsequent development of UC and CD. The effect of dietary components may be primary or modulatory.},

   abstract = {A role for colonic sulfide in the pathogenesis and treatment of ulcerative colitis (UC) has emerged based on biochemical, microbiological, nutritional, toxicological, epidemiological, and therapeutic evidence. Metabolism of isolated colonic epithelial cells has indicated that the bacterial short-chain fatty acid n-butyrate maintains the epithelial barrier and that sulfides can inhibit oxidation of n-butyrate analogous to that observed in active UC. Sulfur for fermentation in the colon is essential for n-butyrate formation and sulfidogenesis aids disposal of colonic hydrogen produced by bacteria. The numbers of sulfate-reducing bacteria and sulfidogenesis is greater in UC than control cases. Sulfide is mainly detoxified by methylation in colonic epithelial cells and circulating red blood cells. The enzyme activity of sulfide methylation is higher in red blood cells of UC patients than control cases. Patients with UC ingest more protein and thereby sulfur amino acids than control subjects. Removing foods rich in sulfur amino acids (milk, eggs, cheese) has proven therapeutic benefits in UC. 5-Amino salicylic acid reduces fermentative production of hydrogen sulfide by colonic bacteria, and aminoglycosides, which inhibit sulfate-reducing bacteria, are of therapeutic benefit in active UC. Methyl-donating agents are a category of drugs of potential therapeutic use in UC. A correlation between sulfide production and mucosal immune responses in UC needs to be undertaken. Control of sulfidogenesis and sulfide detoxification may be important in the disease process of UC, although whether their roles is in an initiating or promoting capacity has yet to be determined.},

   abstract = {OBJECTIVE: The rising incidence of inflammatory bowel disease (IBD) since the Second World War coincides with profound changes of the dietary pattern. The aim of the study was to investigate the possible pathogenic role of some characteristic 'modern life' dietary factors in IBD. DESIGN: Case-control, studying risk factors in recently diagnosed cases, 290 with Crohn's disease and 398 with ulcerative colitis, compared with 616 population controls. Smoking, age, gender and education were taken into account by using logistic regression analysis. SETTING: Hospital cases and population controls. INTERVENTIONS: Questionnaires. MAIN OUTCOME MEASURES: Logistic regression-derived odds ratios. RESULTS: A positive association with cola drinks [OR: 2.2 (95% CI 1.5-3.1)], chewing gum [OR: 1.5 (95% CI: 1.1-2.1)] and chocolate consumption [OR: 2.5 (95% CI: 1.8-3.5)] and a negative association with citrus fruit consumption [OR: 0.5 (95% CI 0.3-0.7)] and the development of Crohn's disease were found. Consumption of cola drinks [OR: 1.6 (95% CI 1.1-2.3)] and chocolate consumption [OR: 2.5 (95% CI 1.8-3.5)] were positively associated with developing ulcerative colitis. There was a negative association between the intake of citrus fruits [OR: 0.5 (95% CI 0.4-0.8)] and 'having a stuffed pet' for a period longer than 5 years [OR: 0.6 (95% CI 0.4-0.9)] and developing the disorder. No association with the frequency of tooth brushing and developing IBD was found. CONCLUSION: All the nutritional items mentioned may be true risk factors or they just might be the expression of a modern life-style also involving other risk factors for the development of IBD which at the present are still unknown.},

Male 9-week-old rats were intracolonically administrated trinitrobenzene sulfonic acid (TNBS) and fed the experimental diets containing 0.05% catechin and 0.025% alpha-tocopherol for 1 week, then dissected. The extent of colitis-induced TNBS was assessed macroscopically. The supplementation of catechins and alpha-tocopherol significantly decreased colonic damage compared with the group fed the basal diet (the disease control). In particular, catechin feeding completely inhibited the development of colon adhesions. Colonic myeloperoxidase (MPO) activity, which is a marker of neutrophil infiltration into the colonic mucosa, was lower in the groups that had been given catechins and alpha-tocopherol. The levels of thiobarbituric acid reactive substances in colon was highest in the disease control group; however, the differences among the groups were not significant. Plasma alkaline phosphatase activity was maintained at normal levels in the rats supplemented with catechins and alpha-tocopherol. These results suggest that catechins and alpha-tocopherol have anti-inflammatory effects on TNBS-induced rat colitis.},

   abstract = {BACKGROUND: The production of free radicals is increased in inflammatory bowel disease, and trace elements are crucial components of several antioxidants. Trace elements deficiency may therefore compromise the defense against oxidative damage. The aims of this study were to measure plasma and tissue concentration of trace elements and antioxidants and to relate this to disease activity. METHODS: A 10-ml blood sample and six colonic biopsy specimens were obtained from 24 patients with either active ulcerative colitis or in remission and 10 patients with irritable bowel syndrome for measurement of trace elements and trace element-dependent enzymes. RESULTS: Patients with moderately active disease had significantly lower plasma iron, selenium, and glutathione peroxidase levels than patients in remission and controls, whereas no significant differences were found between the zinc and copper values of patients and controls. Mucosal concentrations of zinc and metallothionein were reduced, whereas iron and glutathione peroxidase concentrations were increased in patients with endoscopically active disease as compared with controls and patients in remission. CONCLUSIONS: Patients with ulcerative colitis have altered plasma and tissue levels of trace elements and antioxidant-related enzymes. The resulting reduced protection against free radicals may contribute to the inflammatory process.},

   abstract = {A recurrent theme in the schema of pathogenetic mechanisms attributed to colorectal cancer (CRC) and inflammatory bowel disease (IBD) is the interaction between genes and environment. Dietary and other environmental factors, and lower intestinal flora and their chemical interactions occur in the pathogenesis of both. Events at the mucosal surface may be influenced by factors in the luminal environment and by contributions of the host. In addition, both forms of IBD--Crohn's disease (CD) and ulcerative colitis (UC)--have distinctive associated host events. Even within CD and UC, different clinical patterns and prognoses may have different specific host mechanisms. Some of the current putative pathogenetic processes in CRC and IBD are reviewed. Particular attention is given to hypotheses relating to the role of dietetic substances, mainly fibre and dairy products, and how they may affect disease formation. It is argued that within the context of hypotheses proposed for possible beneficial effects of these two dietetic factors, CRC and IBD may be considered together. Further support is lent to arguments that similar and additional hypothetical features ascribed to beneficial effects of fibre may be attributed to disaccharides, lactose and its derivatives, lactulose and lactitol.},

   abstract = {OBJECTIVES: Although ileal pouch-anal anastomosis is the procedure of choice for most patients with ulcerative colitis or familial adenomatous polyposis, most patients have problems with stool frequency and/or consistency. Although most clinicians recommend fiber supplementation for these patients, we could find no studies that prove the efficacy of this practice. The first purpose of this study was to document the effect of fiber supplementation on intestinal function in patients after ileal pouch-anal anastomosis. Because pectin, a soluble fiber supplement, has been reported to slow gastric and intestinal transit, we also hypothesized that pectin would be a superior fiber supplement in these patients. The second purpose, therefore, was to determine whether the effects of pectin on intestinal transit would result in decreased stool frequency in patients with an ileal pouch. METHODS: Thirteen patients who had undergone ileal pouch-anal anastomosis for ulcerative colitis were entered into a 9-wk crossover study. The protocol consisted of three 2-wk study periods, each of which was preceded by a 1-wk washout period. During the three study periods patients supplemented their diets, in random order, with Citrucel, 1 tablespoon twice daily; pectin, 1 tablespoon twice daily; or no supplement. Patients maintained detailed dietary and bowel function diaries. RESULTS: The effects (mean +/- SE) of Citrucel and pectin supplementation are summarized in Table 1. There was no significant effect of either supplement on stool frequency, pouch function, bloating, or stool consistency. In addition, there were no differences in continence. CONCLUSIONS: We found no evidence to support the common practice of fiber supplementation in patients with an ileal pouch. Furthermore, this study did not find that stool frequency decreased during supplementation with pectin. We conclude that there is little role for fiber supplementation in patients with an ileal pouch.},

   abstract = {It is currently held that the pathogenesis of inflammatory bowel disease (IBD) involves a complex interaction of host responses, some immunologic and genetically determined, and external influences including microbial and dietary factors. Nutritional surveys and studies testing stepwise exclusion dietary compounds have suggested that dietary factors might be linked to the occurrence of IBD. Food allergy was suggested early as a possible trigger for the inflammatory response; however, no firm evidence has been gathered over the years to substantiate this possibility. The possibility that patients with Crohn's disease may have an unusual premorbid pattern of dietary intake has also been examined since the early seventies. Several groups of investigators report a high intake of refined sugars (i.e. sucrose), recycled cooking oil, a more frequent consumption of fast foods in patients with Crohn's disease and ulcerative colitis respectively. However, a critical comparison of incidence and prevalence studies published from 1976 until 1994 clearly showed no pre-existing nutritional abnormality that has been identified consistently in patients who develop inflammatory bowel disease.},

PATIENTS AND METHODS: Eighty-nine patients with mild to moderate ulcerative colitis (n = 43) or Crohn's disease (n = 46) in remission, with a history of disease of 2 years or longer, were enrolled in this prospective study from nine private practices, three university-based medical centers, and one Veterans Administration medical center in the United States. Forty-four patients were randomly assigned to receive olestra and 45 to receive triglycerides in chips or cookies daily for 4 weeks. At Week 4, patients were classified as in remission, worsened, or relapsed according to an investigator's global assessment based on sigmoidoscopy (for ulcerative colitis) or the Crohn's disease activity index, laboratory findings, and clinical course. RESULTS: At Week 4, the olestra and triglyceride groups did not differ significantly with respect to the percentages of patients who relapsed (P = 0.494; difference = 2.4%; upper 95% CL = 8.8%) or with respect to the percentages of patients who experienced any worsening of their symptoms (P = 0.630; difference = 0.2%; upper 95% CL = 13.3%). Of evaluable patients, 90% (37 of 41) given olestra remained in remission with no worsening, compared with 90% (38 of 42) given triglycerides. Gastrointestinal symptoms were comparable between the treatment groups, and there were no treatment-related laboratory abnormalities. Six patients were excluded from analysis for reasons unrelated to treatment. CONCLUSION: Olestra did not affect the activity of quiescent mild to moderate IBD.},
