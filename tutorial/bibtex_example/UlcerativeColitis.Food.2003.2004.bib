   abstract = {InKine Pharmaceutical Co. is developing an oral compound, CBP 1011, for the treatment of immune thrombocytopenic purpura (ITP) [Hematrol] and for the treatment of inflammatory bowel disorders, ulcerative colitis and Crohn's disease (Colirest). This profile has been selected from R&D Insight, a pharmaceutical intelligence database produced by Adis International Ltd. CBP 1011 or medroxyprogesterone, is a progesterone agonist and inhibits pro-inflammatory mediators such as interleukin-6 and tumour necrosis factor (TNF). CBP 1011 was originally developed by CorBec Pharmaceuticals, which in 1997 was aquired by Panax and then intergrated into InKine Pharmaceuticals. According to a company spokesperson, InKline is pursuing outlicensing opportunities for Hematrol since the company's current commercial focus is on gastrointestinal products. In June 2000, InKine announced the completion of a study comparing the bioavailability of a commercially viable tablet formulation of CBP 1011 to the original capsule formulation that is currently being used in the company's phase III studies in patients with idiopathic thrombocytopenic purpura. Preliminary results from this study indicate that the bioavailability of the tablet formulation does not differ significantly from that of the capsule formulation. The trial enrolled ITP patients (i) who are HIV positive, (ii) who are chronic ITP sufferers despite having had a splenectomy, (iii) who are older, or (iv) who have less severe thrombocytopenia. In preclinical trials, CBP 1011 was shown to decrease lymphocyte infiltration into the bowel compared with the control. Studies also show that it possibly offers safety benefits over steroid therapies. In June 2001, InKine commenced enrolment for a pivotal phase III trial in the treatment of Crohn's disease. This randomised, double-blind trial will enrol approximately 250 patients and will compare two doses of CBP 1011 (400 and 1000mg) with placebo. In April 2003, the US Patent and Trademark Office granted InKine Pharmaceutical a 'Notice of Allowance' for the 'Method of Treating Inflammatory Conditions with Progesterone or Progesterone Analogs'. This patent for medroxyprogesterone (Colirest) provides InKine patent protection for the use of Colirest in treating patients with Crohn's disease, ulcerative colitis, proctitis, microscopic colitis, allergic eosinophilic gastroenteritis, food allergies, drug-induced oesophagitis, coeliac disease, recurrent polyps and haemorrhoids. The patent protection also covers Colirest in a variety of delivery forms such as tablet, enema, suppository, foam, gel, ointment and suspension.},

This study was designed to evaluate the effects of vitamin E and selenium supplementations on tissue injury and oxidative stress in trinitrobenzenesulfonic acid-induced ulcerative colitis in rats. Trinitrobenzenesulfonic acid administration severely changed the normal architecture of the colon and significantly increased the levels of malondialdehyde, protein carbonyl, and xantine oxidase (P < 0.001) in the colon homogenates of these rats. Supplementation of selenium to the trinitrobenzenesulfonic acid-treated rats neither improved the histopathological findings nor decreased the levels of malondialdehyde and protein carbonyl. Vitamin E supplementation reduced the levels of malondialdehyde and protein carbonyl but did not improve the colonic lesions. Supplementation of vitamin E + selenium significantly reduced both the severity of colonic lesions and the levels of malondialdehyde and protein carbonyl. In conclusion, we suggest that antioxidants and specific micronutrients may have beneficial effects in the treatment of ulcerative colitis.},

   abstract = {Recent studies have suggested that probiotics or short chain fatty acids (SCFAs) exert a therapeutic effect on inflammatory bowel disease (IBD) patients. In a previous study, we demonstrated that Clostridium butyricum produces high levels of SCFAs in culture. In addition, a yogurt-based additive effectively masked, completely eliminating the unpleasant odor derived from the SCFAs. We recently reported that the oral administration of both high and low dose diets (50% w/w for 17 days and 5% w/w for 16 months, respectively) of the Clostridium butyricum derivative did not cause pathological abnormalities in rats. In the present study, we evaluated the effects of this product against dextran sulfate sodium (DSS)-induced experimental colitis in rats. Five-week-old male Wistar Hannover GALAS rats were given a mixture of a standard diet containing 3% (w/w) of DSS for 8 days. In the derivative-fed group, Clostridium butyricum derivative (20% w/w) with 0.1% (w/w) additive was also added to their diet. The control-fed group was given tap water (20% w/w) with 0.1% (w/w) additive. After 8 days, a laparotomy was performed, and macroscopic and microscopic inflammation scoring was determined. The Clostridium butyricum derivative effectively prevented bloody diarrhea. In addition, mucosal damage to the derivative-fed group was significantly reduced macroscopically compared to that of the control-fed group. The potential clinical efficacy of the Clostridium butyricum derivative in IBD patients is also discussed.},

All of these mesalamine formulations are effective, but they differ with regard to where the drug is released in the intestinal tract, which may influence the outcome in some patients. Therefore, the selection of a mesalamine agent should be based on the results of the clinical trials, individual patient response, compliance issues, and price, until comparative clinical trials are published.},

The better understanding of the mechanisms of inflammatory bowel disease has evolved from desriptive clinical data and genetically engineered animal models. It led to great interest in the evaluation of a variety of new therapeutic agents with novel actions. This review will discuss the mechanisms of biologicals (antibodies against pro-inflammatory cytokines, T cell antibodies, anti-inflammtory cytokines, adhesion molecule blockers, growth factors, hormones, colony stimulating factors, fusion proteins, anti-sense oligonucleotides, trefoil peptides, immunostimulatory [ISS] DNA) used in the treatment of inflammatory bowel disease and summarizes the available data on established biologic therapies as well as investigational agents and briefly touch on probiotics. Based on the data discussed, it seems that biologicals will play an important role in managing inflammatory bowel disease in the near future.},

   abstract = {There is renewed enthusiasm for exploring the possibility that Mycobacterium paratuberculosis may be causative in Crohn's disease (CD). We aimed to determine whether CD subjects are more likely to be M. paratuberculosis seropositive than controls. Using our population-based University of Manitoba Inflammatory Bowel Disease Research Registry, we recruited CD and ulcerative colitis (UC) subjects between 18 and 50 years of age for a study involving detailed questionnaires and venipuncture. We accessed the population-based databases of Manitoba Health (single provincial health insurer) to get age-, gender-, and geography-matched controls to our inflammatory bowel disease (IBD) population. We asked enrolling IBD subjects for potential nonaffected sibling controls. We used an enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay (ELISA) for serum antibodies to M. paratuberculosis initially developed for cattle but adapted for human use. The rate of positive ELISA results, based on previously published interpretation criteria, was significantly higher for all study groups. There was no difference in M. paratuberculosis seropositivity rate among CD patients (37.8%; n = 283), UC patients (34.7%; n = 144), healthy controls (33.6%; n = 402), and nonaffected siblings (34.1%; n = 138). For siblings, there was no correlation between M. paratuberculosis serological status and that of the corresponding IBD affected sibling. None of the demographic or questionnaire variables studied were predictive of M. paratuberculosis status. Subjects with CD and UC were less likely to have ingested unpasteurized milk and less likely to have had a non-tap water source as a primary water source. In conclusion, in this population-based case control study, the M. paratuberculosis seropositivity rate was approximately 35% for all groups and there was no difference in rates between CD patients, UC patients, healthy controls, or nonaffected siblings. The much higher rate of seropositivity for subjects from Manitoba, Canada, than for those from Denmark or Wisconsin cannot be obviously explained. While these data seem to refute any association of CD with M. paratuberculosis, the high seroprevalence in Manitobans raises the possibility that the high rates of CD in Manitoba could be related to high exposure rates for M. paratuberculosis. Hence, the possibility of an association between M. paratuberculosis and CD remains inconclusive.},

There has been considerable interest in the past in determining whether Mycobacterium avium subsp. paratuberculosis (M. avium) might be the etiologic agent in Crohn's disease since it causes a disease in cattle that is similar to Crohn's disease in humans. We aimed to determine if there was an association between Crohn's disease and infection with M. avium or other zoonotic agents and compared the findings with those for patients with ulcerative colitis, unaffected siblings of Crohn's disease patients, or population-based controls without inflammatory bowel disease. Patients under age 50 years with Crohn's disease or ulcerative colitis, unaffected siblings of patients, or healthy controls drawn from a population-based age- and gender-matched registry were enrolled in a study in which subjects submitted to a questionnaire survey and venipuncture. A nested cohort underwent colonoscopy plus biopsy. Samples were batched and submitted to PCR for the detection of M. avium and other zoonotic agents known to cause predominately intestinal disease in cattle, sheep, or swine. Only one patient with ulcerative colitis, no patients with Crohn's disease, and none of the sibling controls were positive for M. avium, whereas 6 of 19 healthy controls were positive for M. avium. Since the control subjects were significantly older than the case patients, we studied another 11 patients with inflammatory bowel disease who were older than age 50 years, and another single subject with ulcerative colitis was positive for M. avium. One other subject older than age 50 years with ulcerative colitis was positive for circovirus, a swine-borne agent of infection. In conclusion, by performing PCR with mucosal samples from patients with Crohn's disease and controls, no association between Crohn's disease and infection with M. avium or any of the other six zoonotic agents studied could be found.},

   abstract = {BACKGROUND: Rheumatic joint pain is a common extra-intestinal complication of inflammatory bowel disease (IBD). Because the high ratio of n-6 to n-3 fatty acids (FAs) of the Western diet might promote rheumatic disorders, we sought to compare the effects of short-term duodenal administration of n-3-rich seal oil and n-6-rich soy oil on IBD-related joint pain. METHODS: Nineteen patients with IBD-related joint pain were included in the study; 9 had Crohn disease and 10 had ulcerative colitis. Ten millilitres seal oil (n = 10) or soy oil (n = 9) was self-administered through a nasoduodenal feeding tube 3 times daily for 10 days. RESULTS: Compared with soy oil treatment, seal oil significantly reduced the duration of morning stiffness (P = 0.024), number of tender joints (P = 0.035), intensity of pain (P = 0.025) and the doctor's scoring of rheumatic disease activity (P = 0.025) at the end of the 10-day treatment period. Analysis of the effects as area under the curve (area between the curve and baseline, zero) for the entire period from start of treatment until 6 months' post-treatment suggested a long-lasting beneficial effect of seal oil administration on joint pain, whereas soy oil tended (not significantly) to aggravate the condition. Consistently, the serum ratios of n-6 to n-3 FAs (P < 0.01) and arachidonic acid to eicosapentaenoic acid (P < 0.01) were reduced after treatment with seal oil. CONCLUSION: The results suggest distinctive, differential prolonged effects on IBD-related joint pain of short-term duodenal administration of n-3-rich seal oil (significant improvement) and n-6-rich soy oil (tendency to exacerbation).},

Specific, consistent abnormalities in flora composition peculiar to UC have not yet been described, however Clostridium difficile colitis has been cured by the infusion of human fecal flora into the colon. This approach may also be applicable to the treatment of UC on the basis of restoration of flora imbalances. GOAL: To observe the clinical, colonoscopic and histologic effects of human probiotic infusions (HPI) in 6 selected patients with UC. CASE REPORTS: Six patients (3 men and 3 women aged 25-53 years) with UC for less than 5 years were treated with HPI. All patients had suffered severe, recurrent symptoms and UC had been confirmed on colonoscopy and histology. Fecal flora donors were healthy adults who were extensively screened for parasites and bacterial pathogens. Patients were prepared with antibiotics and oral polyethylene glycol lavage. Fecal suspensions were administered as retention enemas within 10 minutes of preparation and the process repeated daily for 5 days. By 1 week post-HPI some symptoms of UC had improved. Complete reversal of symptoms was achieved in all patients by 4 months post-HPI, by which time all other UC medications had been ceased. At 1 to 13 years post-HPI and without any UC medication, there was no clinical, colonoscopic, or histologic evidence of UC in any patient. CONCLUSIONS: Colonic infusion of donor human intestinal flora can reverse UC in selected patients. These anecdotal results support the concept of abnormal bowel flora or even a specific, albeit unidentified, bacterial pathogen causing UC.},

Medical conditions that have been reportedly treated or have the potential to be treated with probiotics include diarrhea, gastroenteritis, irritable bowel syndrome, and inflammatory bowel disease (Crohn's disease and ulcerative colitis), cancer, depressed immune function, inadequate lactase digestion, infant allergies, failure-to-thrive, hyperlipidemia, hepatic diseases, Helicobacter pylori infections, genitourinary tract infections, and others. The use of probiotics should be further investigated for possible benefits and side-effects in patients affected by these medical conditions.},

However, it has only been in the past decade that the use of ingredients with a high resistant starch content has occurred in foods, initially in Australia but now throughout the world. Foods containing these resistant starch-rich ingredients include not only staple foods, such as bread and breakfast cereals, but also foods designed for those with special physiological or medical needs, such as celiac sensitivity and ulcerative colitis, or for individuals who are seeking to manage energy intake and control weight. Resistant starch has other benefits when compared with traditional sources of dietary fiber in that the preparation and design of foods with additional health benefits have the appearance, taste, and texture characteristics that encourage people to consume these "better for you" foods. As our knowledge of the range of physiological effects that occur through the consumption of resistant starch increases, more applications will be found for their inclusion in an expanding range of foods around the world.},

   abstract = {Several lines of evidence link inflammatory bowel diseases to modifications of intestinal microflora. Epidemiologic and clinical data suggest a triggering role for select agents in ulcerative colitis and in Crohn disease. Experimental evidence indicates that intestinal microorganisms are needed for developing intestinal inflammation in IL-10 knockout mice, and this is associated with an increased number of adherent clostridia and a decrease of lactobacilli and bifidobacteria. It may be hypothesized that a host-agent-specific relationship leads to an abnormal immune response, which may be genetically driven in select inflammatory bowel diseases. However, different from adults, the pattern of intestinal microflora undergoes profound changes during the early stage of life, contributing to the development of the immune system. A close relationship exists between microbiologic and immunologic imprinting. The microbiologic imprinting in neonates may be modified using bacterial probiotics that colonize the intestine, modify the immune response, and decrease the risk for atopy. Probiotics may decrease the recurrences of inflammatory bowel diseases. Preliminary evidence of intestinal antiinflammatory effects has been detected in children with cystic fibrosis. Overall these data provide the rationale to investigate the interaction between intestinal microflora and the local and general immune response in children with, or at risk for, inflammatory bowel diseases. This approach may be a key for understanding the pathophysiology of intestinal inflammation and may disclose novel strategies to educate better the immune system, particularly during its developmental stage.},

   abstract = {Ulcerative colitis is a severe, relapsing and remitting disease of the human large intestine characterised by inflammation of the mucosa and submucosa. The main site of disease is the sigmoid/rectal region of the large bowel but the aetiology remains unknown. There is considerable evidence to indicate that the components of the resident colonic microflora can play an important role in initiation of the disease. The present study was aimed at characterising the faecal microflora of ulcerative colitis patients in remission and active phases to determine profile differences. Faecal samples were obtained from 12 patients, 6 with active colitis and 6 in remission. The samples were analysed for populations of lactobacilli, bifidobacteria, clostridia, bacteroides, sulphate-reducing bacteria (SRB) and total bacteria using culture independent fluorescence in situ hybridisation (FISH). Lactobacillus-specific denaturing gradient gel electrophoresis (DGGE) was then performed to compare the species present. Numbers of lactobacilli were significantly lower (p<0.05) during the active phase of the disease but the other populations tested did not differ. DGGE analysis revealed that Lactobacillus salivarus, Lactobacillus manihotivorans and Pediococcus acidilactici were present in remission, but not during active inflammation. These results imply that a reduction in intestinal Lactobacillus species may be important in the initiation of ulcerative colitis.},

The interleukin (IL) 2- and beta(2)-microglobulin (beta(2)m)-deficient (IL-2(null) x beta(2)m(null)) mice spontaneously develop colon cancer in the setting of chronic UC. This study investigated the effects of dietary folate on the development of UC-associated colon cancer in the IL-2(null) x beta(2)m(null) mice. Weaning IL-2(null) x beta(2)m(null) mice were randomized to receive 0 (deficient; n = 40), 2 (basal requirement; control; n = 46), or 8 (supplemented; n = 36) mg folate/kg diet for 32 weeks. At necropsy, all macroscopic colonic tumors were identified and histologically classified as dysplasia or adenocarcinoma. The incidence of high-grade lesions (high-grade dysplasia/carcinoma in situ and invasive adenocarcinoma) in the folate-supplemented group was 46% lower than that in the control group (35.3% versus 65.1%, P = 0.009). The incidence of high-grade lesions in the folate-deficient group was also 49% lower than that in the control group (33.3% versus 65.1%, P = 0.007). The higher mortality rate in the folate-deficient group compared with the other two groups (25% versus 6.5% and 5.6%, P < 0.02) partially accounted for the low incidence of high-grade lesions in this group. These data indicate that dietary folate supplementation at 4x the basal dietary requirement significantly suppresses UC-associated colorectal carcinogenesis in the IL-2(null) x beta(2)m(null) mice. These data also suggest that folate deficiency may inhibit colorectal carcinogenesis in chronic UC. However, the high mortality observed in the folate-deficient group precludes a definitive conclusion concerning the effect of folate deficiency on UC-associated colorectal carcinogenesis in this model.},

   abstract = {Gut-associated lymphoid tissue (GALT) is the largest lymphoid organ in the body. This is not surprising considering the huge load of antigens (Ags) from food and commensal bacteria with which it interacts on a daily basis. Gut-associated lymphoid tissue has to recognise and allow the transfer of beneficial Ags whilst concurrently dealing with and successfully removing putative and overtly harmful Ags. This distinctive biological feature of GALT is believed to be crucial to good health. Deregulation or dysfunction of GALT is thought to predispose to inflammatory bowel diseases (IBD) such as ulcerative colitis and Crohn's disease. The exact mechanism(s) underlying the pathogenesis of IBD is (are) poorly understood and the immunological defects in GALT are poorly documented. Advances in immunology have highlighted the importance of dendritic cells (DCs), which are the key Ag presenting cells in tissues and lymphoid compartments. Their crucial role in GALT, in health and disease is discussed in this review. Interaction of DCs with T cells in the gut produces a subset of T lymphocytes, which have immunosuppressive function. Inappropriate Ag uptake and presentation to naive T cells in mesenteric lymph nodes may lead to T cell tolerance in GALT. These various complex factors in the gut are discussed and their possible relevance to IBD evaluated.},

   abstract = {The precise cause(s) of Crohn's disease and ulcerative colitis are unknown. From animal models and human studies it is well established that gut bacterial flora are essential for inducing the bowel inflammation. Animal models, when kept in a germ-free environment, do not develop colitis until the gut flora is reconstituted. It is not clear whether the bacterial antigens (Ags) from the normal flora or some other pathogenic bacterial Ags induce/propagate the inflammatory process in inflammatory bowel disease (IBD). Despite extensive research it has not been possible to identify any specific bacteria or virus as a credible cause of IBD. Recent understanding of quorum sensing molecules (QSMs) secreted by bacteria helps to explain the community behaviour in bacterial species. When QSMs reach a defined concentration, they activate bacterial proliferation and a number of virulence genes. Also, these molecules have been found to modulate the immune system to the advantage of the gut bacteria. They have not been well studied, however, in the gut. Inappropriate secretion of QSMs may alter the gut-associated lymphoid tissue (GALT) and, thereby, deregulate the immune tolerance normally present. Usefulness of probiotics and their immune modulating effects are being increasingly reported. Probiotics are also being used in the treatment of IBD. The interaction between the epithelial cells and the gut flora is very important as this is the first line of contact; this interaction may determine the induction of tolerance and mucosal integrity or immune activity, tissue inflammation and abnormal permeability. The latter is documented in patients with IBD and their healthy relatives. This may be an important factor in disruption of mucosal integrity and GALT dysfunction.},

The present study examined the effects of psyllium and fat on the enzymes responsible for sphingomyelin metabolism and apoptosis in the colon. Mice were fed control, psyllium-containing (100 g/kg), high-fat (313 g/kg, 53 % energy as fat) or high-fat plus psyllium diets for 4 weeks. The activities of acid, neutral and alkaline sphingomyelinase (SMase), neutral ceramidase, and caspase 3, 8 and 9 in colonic mucosa were determined. The expressions of alkaline SMase and caspase 3 were examined. The psyllium-containing diet was found to increase significantly the activities of alkaline SMase and caspase 3 and decreased those of acid SMase and neutral ceramidase. The high-fat diet had opposite effects on these enzymes and attenuated the effects of psyllium. Western blotting showed that psyllium increased and high-fat decreased the levels of alkaline SMase and caspase 3 in colonic mucosa. The change in caspase 3 activity was positively correlated with that of alkaline SMase and negatively with acid SMase. No similar changes of acid and alkaline phosphatase activities in the colon or acid and neutral SMase activity in the liver were identified. In conclusion, colonic sphingomyelin metabolism and apoptosis were affected by psyllium and fat in an opposite manner. The results may have implications for colorectal tumourigenesis and inflammation.},

   abstract = {BACKGROUND: In the past, children with ulcerative colitis were treated with a total colectomy, ileostomy and mucous fistula; ileal pouch-anal anastomosis was postponed until adulthood. The aim of the present study was to assess the functional outcome and quality of life after ileal pouch-anal anastomosis and determine whether it is justified to perform the operation in children when surgery is indicated. METHODS: A retrospective review of 38 medical records was carried out, of which there were 19 paediatric patients and 19 adult patients (control). A questionnaire survey was conducted. Telephone interviews were carried out for the non-respondents. RESULTS: Sixteen patients in the paediatric group (nine boys, mean age: 12 years) and 16 patients in the adult group (10 men, mean age: 39 years) were available for analysis. There was no operative mortality. The mean bowel frequency per week was 37 and 42. Furthermore, bowel frequency during the day was slightly lower in the paediatric group. Children had marginally better continence than adults. In the quality of life assessment, the mean utilities in the paediatric group were 0.69 and 0.84 in the preoperative and postoperative status, respectively. These were similar to those in the adult group (0.62 and 0.82). Both groups achieved significantly favourable postoperative responses in terms of ability to perform social activity, recreation and enjoying food. CONCLUSIONS: Ileal pouch-anal anastomosis in children is safe, results in good functional outcome and improves the quality of life. Hence, it is justified to perform ileal pouch-anal anastomosis as soon as surgery is indicated rather than as a delayed procedure.},

Common symptoms reported are similar to our patient's including: abdominal pain, epigastric pain, anorexia, bloating, weight loss, diarrhea, ankle edema, dysphagia, melaena and postprandial nausea and vomiting. Microscopic features of eosinophilic infiltration usually occur in the lamina propria or submucosa with perivascular aggregates. The disease is likely mediated by eosinophils activated by various cytokines and chemokines. Therapy centers around the use of immunosuppressive agents and dietary therapy if food allergy is a factor. CASE PRESENTATION: The patient is a 31 year old Caucasian female with a past medical history significant for ulcerative colitis. She presented with recurrent bouts of vomiting, abdominal pain and chest discomfort of 11 months duration. The bouts of vomiting had been reoccurring every 7-10 days, with each episode lasting for 1-3 days. This was associated with extreme weakness and cachexia. Gastric biopsies revealed intense eosinophilic infiltration. The patient responded to glucocorticoids and azathioprine. The differential diagnosis and molecular pathogenesis of eosinophilic gastritis as well as the molecular effects of glucocorticoids in eosinophilic disorders are discussed. CONCLUSIONS: The patient responded to a combination of glucocorticosteroids and azathioprine with decreased eosinophilia and symptoms. It is likely that eosinophil-active cytokines such as interleukin-3 (IL-3), granulocyte macrophage colony stimulating factor (GM-CSF) and IL-5 play pivotal roles in this disease. Chemokines such as eotaxin may be involved in eosinophil recruitment. These mediators are downregulated or inhibited by the use of immunosuppressive medications.},

   abstract = {AIM: To investigate the effects of probiotic on intestinal mucosae of patients with ulcerative colitis (UC), and to evaluate the role of probiotic in preventing the relapse of UC. METHODS: Thirty patients received treatment with sulphasalazine (SASP) and glucocorticoid and then were randomly administered bifid triple viable capsule (BIFICO) (1.26 g/d), or an identical placebo (starch) for 8 wk. Fecal samples were collected for stool culture 2 wk before and after the randomized treatments. The patients were evaluated clinically, endoscopically and histologically after 2 mo of treatment or in case of relapse of UC. p65 and IkappaB expressions were determined by Western blot analysis. DNA-binding activity of NF-kappaB in colonic nuclear extracts was detected by electrophoretic mobility shift assay (EMSA). mRNA expressions of cytokines were identified by semi-quantitative assay, reverse transcriptase- polymerase chain reaction (RT-PCR). RESULTS: Three patients (20%) in the BIFICO group had relapses during 2-mo follow-up period, compared with 14 (93.3%) in placebo group (P<0.01). The concentration of fecal lactobacilli, bifidobacteria was significantly increased in BIFICO-treated group only (P<0.01). The expressions of NF-kappaB p65 and DNA binding activity of NF-kappaB were significantly attenuated in the treatment group than that in control (P<0.05). The mRNA expression of anti-inflammatory cytokines was elevated in comparison with the control group. CONCLUSION: The probiotic could impede the activation of NF-kappaB, decrease the expressions of TNF-alpha and IL-1beta and elevate the expression of IL-10. These results suggest that oral administration of this new probiotic preparation is effective in preventing flare-ups of chronic UC. It may become a prophylactic drug to decrease the relapse of UC.},

They are without significant side effects, except possibly an increase in gas with prebiotics, and so far, appear to be entirely safe. However, are they effective? More than a dozen studies using probiotics in IBD have now been reported, and there is dear benefit in pouchitis and possibly also in Crohn's, although there are so many clinical types of this condition that a clear indication has yet to emerge. For ulcerative colitis (UC) more studies are needed. The use of prebiotics in IBD is only just starting, although significant effects on both the luminal and mucosa-associated flora have been demonstrated in healthy subjects. Antibiotics offer more certain hope in IBD treatment, although with a much greater risk of unwanted effects. Their efficacy in clinical studies varies, with Crohn's disease and pouchitis reporting more benefit than ulcerative colitis. However, the ideal combination of antibiotics, and rationale for their use has not been determined.},

   abstract = {Convincing evidence from both animal models and the study of patients with ulcerative colitis (UC) implicates the intestinal microflora in the initiation and maintenance of the inflammatory processes in this condition. Despite this, no specific pathogen has been identified as causal and the disease is widely believed to occur as the result of a genetically determined, but abnormal immune response to commensal bacteria. When compared with healthy people, UC patients have increased levels of mucosal IgG directed against the normal microflora. Studies of mucosal bacterial populations in UC indicate that there may be increased numbers of organisms, but reduced counts of "protective" bacteria such as lactobacilli and bifidobacteria. In animal models of colitis, antibiotics, particularly metronidazole, clindamycin, ciprofloxacin and the combination of vancomycin/impinemem protect against UC, especially if given before the onset of inflammation. These antibiotics target anaerobes and some Gram-positive organisms such as enterococci. However, antibiotic use in more than a dozen randomised control trials has been very disappointing, probably because we do not know which species to target, when to give the antibiotics, for how long and in what combinations. Surprisingly, therefore, there is a consistent benefit in the small number of studies reported of probiotics to manage UC and pouchitis. There is scope for more work in this area focussing on the mucosal microflora, its interactions with the gut immune system, its metabolic properties and the potential ways of modifying it.},

There has been a special focus on dietary factors, as well as on other exposures introduced on a population-based level, including fast food, cola drinks, toothpaste, antibiotics and oral contraceptives. The aim of this review is to critically assess the results from the different observational studies that have investigated these hypotheses, and also to propose research agendas that should be pursued in the future. The conclusion is that infectious exposures and early bacterial colonization, which are associated with better hygiene early in life and that influence immune function, and possibly oral contraceptives, remain the only exposures of interest for future research into the aetiology of ulcerative colitis and Crohn's disease.},

   abstract = {Inflammatory bowel disease, such as ulcerative colitis and Crohn's disease, results from an interaction between susceptibility genes, the host's bacterial environment, gut barrier defects, and immunological factors. New management approaches have been evolved from advances in our understanding of the pathobiology of this common gut disorder In particular, the therapeutic manipulation of the bacterial microenvironment in the gut seems to offer an innovative tool for the treatment of those patients. Since the gut is a highly sensitizing organ that contributes to the systemic immune response, potent treatments need to be developed to reduce gut inflammation in this disorder. Recent studies have demonstrated that probiotic lactobacilli, and also immunostimulatory DNA sequences from those same bacteria have an important anti-inflammatory potential in this context. Future research should better define among patients with inflammatory bowel disease the various clinical phenotypes with the greatest potential of response to probiotic treatment. Identification of the genes leading to the disease and a rather better understanding of the underlying immunoregulatory abnormalities will be crucial steps to define the different profiles of interaction between endogenous digestive bacterial flora and the immune system in each individual patient. Such advances will probably lead to targeting of effective treatments, including bacteriotherapy with probiotic lactobacilli, to subsets of patients with inflammatory bowel disease.},

   abstract = {The demonstration that immune and epithelial cells can discriminate between different microbial species has extended our understanding of the actions of probiotics beyond simple barrier and antimicrobial concepts. Several probiotic mechanisms of action, relative to inflammatory bowel disease, have been elucidated: (1) competitive exclusion, whereby probiotics compete with microbial pathogens for a limited number of receptors present on the surface epithelium; (2) immunomodulation and/or stimulation of an immune response of gut-associated lymphoid and epithelial cells; (3) antimicrobial activity and suppression of pathogen growth; (4) enhancement of barrier function; and (5) induction of T cell apoptosis in the mucosal immune compartment. The unraveling of these mechanisms of action has led to new support for the use of probiotics in the management of clinical inflammatory bowel disease. Though level 1 evidence now supports the therapeutic use of probiotics in the treatment of postoperative pouchitis, only levels 2 and 3 evidence is currently available in support of the use of probiotics in the treatment of ulcerative colitis and Crohn's disease. Nevertheless, one significant and consistent finding has emerged during the course of research in the past year: not all probiotic bacteria have similar therapeutic effects. Rigorously designed, controlled clinical trials are vital to investigate the unresolved issues related to efficacy, dose, duration of use, single or multi-strain formulation, and the concomitant use of probiotics, synbiotics, or antibiotics.},

   abstract = {This comprehensive review promotes the novel concept that a defensin deficiency, i.e. lack of mucosal peptide antibiotics, may play a pivotal role in the aetiopathogenesis of Crohn's disease. Such an impaired function of this chemical barrier is consistent with the epidemiological relationship of good domestic hygiene with the incidence of inflammatory bowel diseases. The disregulated adaptive immune system, formerly believed to be the major cause in the development of Crohn's disease, may reflect only the primary break of the mucosal defence since the immune response is mostly directed against lumenal bacteria. Recent work has identified five different defensins expressed in colonic mucosa. In contrast to ulcerative colitis, Crohn's disease is characterised by an impaired induction of human beta defensins 2 and 3. This deficient induction may be due to changes in the intracellular transcription by NFkappaB and the intracellular peptidoglycan receptor NOD2, mutated in Crohn's disease. These findings are consistent with the mucosal attachment of lumenal bacteria in inflammatory bowel diseases and the frequent occurrence of other infectious agents. The hypothesis of an impaired mucosal antibacterial activity is also consistent with the benefit from antibiotic or probiotic treatment in certain inflammatory bowel disease states.},

Their major role in preventing and treating gastrointestinal disease appears to be from their effect on the immune process, protection against abnormal invasive bacteria, and in the production of short-chain fatty acids from starch and non-starch polysaccharides. Probiotic microorganisms are administered in food supplements and yogurts. They are also now sold in the form of capsules and powders. There is great variation in the microorganisms in the various supplements. It is important to understand that all probiotic products are different. Some contain a single organism and others contain multiple organisms. Therapeutic results have been achieved with various probiotics in different diseases. In the treatment of inflammatory bowel diseases (IBD), success has been reported with Escherichia coli Nissle strain in ulcerative colitis, and with a multiple organism product, VSL#3 (VSL Pharmaceuticals, Fort Lauderdale, FL), in Crohn's disease and pouchitis. Initial reports in irritable bowel syndrome (IBS) have resulted in encouraging results with the use of E. coli Nissle strain, and recently with multiple organism probiotic supplements. However, caution must still apply to the use of probiotics in IBD and IBS because the reports and the number of patients treated are limited.},

   abstract = {Nutrients may be involved in the modulation of the immune response through at least three different mechanisms. First, the intestinal ecosystem plays a pivotal role in the pathogenesis of inflammatory bowel disease, triggering the uncontrolled inflammatory response in genetically predisposed individuals. Nutrients, together with bacteria, are major components of, and can therefore influence, the intestinal environment. Second, as components of cell membranes, nutrients can mediate the expression of proteins involved in the immune response, such as cytokines, adhesion molecules and nitric oxide synthase. The composition of lipids in the cell membrane is modified by dietary changes and can influence cellular responses. Indeed, various epidemiological, experimental and clinical data suggest that the immune response may be sensitive to changes in dietary composition. Finally, suboptimal levels of micronutrients are often found in both children and adults with inflammatory bowel disease, although, with the exception of iron and folate, it is unusual to discover symptoms attributable to these deficits. However, subclinical deficits may have a pathophysiological significance, as they may favour the self-perpetuation of the disease (due to defects in the mechanisms of tissue repair), cause defective defence against damage produced by oxygen free radicals and facilitate lipid peroxidation. These events can occur even in clinically inactive or mildly active disease, as well as in the development of dysplasia in the intestinal mucosa. Some dietary manipulations have been attempted as primary treatment for rheumatoid arthritis, and specially formulated diets for enteral nutrition have proved to be an effective treatment for Crohn's disease. Most trials, although lacking sufficient patient numbers, have demonstrated a role for dietary manipulation as primary therapy for inflammatory disease. Dietary lipids are one of the most active nutritional substrates modulating the immune response. Recently, it has been demonstrated that lipids may be a key factor explaining the therapeutic effect of clinical nutrition in Crohn's disease.},

There is also strong evidence that certain probiotic strains are able to enhance immune function, especially in subjects with less than adequate immune function such as the elderly. Efficacy of probiotics in the prevention of traveller's diarrhoea, sepsis associated with severe acute pancreatitis, and cancers, the management of ulcerative colitis, and lowering of blood cholesterol remains unproven.

The Pouchitis Disease Activity Index (PDAI) represents an objective and reproducible scoring system for pouchitis: active pouchitis is defined as a score > or = 7 and remission as a score < 7. About 15% of patients develop a chronic disease. Treatment of pouchitis is empirical, and very few controlled studies have been carried out. Antibiotics, particularly metronidazole and ciprofloxacin, are the treatment of choice. Chronic pouchitis may benefit from a prolonged course of a combination of antibiotics. Highly concentrated probiotics are effective for both prevention of relapses and prevention of pouchitis onset. There is no convincing evidence of the efficacy of other therapeutic agents.},

   abstract = {Pouchitis, a non-specific inflammation of the ileal reservoir, is the most frequent long-term complication after pouch surgery for ulcerative colitis. Incidence rates vary widely. The etiology is still unknown, but genetic susceptibility and fecal stasis with bacterial overgrowth seem to be important factors. A clinical diagnosis should be always confirmed by endoscopy and histology, and Pouchitis Disease Activity Index (PDAI), based on clinical symptoms, endoscopic appearance and histologic findings, represents an objective and reproducible scoring system for pouchitis. The treatment of pouchitis is largely empiric given the few controlled studies available. Antibiotics, especially metronidazole and ciprofloxacin, are the therapy of choice. Chronic pouchitis occurs in about 10-15% of patients; in these cases, further diagnostic tests should be performed to exclude alternative diagnoses. Highly concentrated probiotics (VSL#3) have been shown to be effective in preventing the onset and relapse of pouchitis.},

   abstract = {BACKGROUND & AIMS: We have recently documented the efficacy of a highly concentrated probiotic preparation (VSL#3) in the prevention of flare-up in patients with chronic pouchitis. The aim of this study was to compare probiotic therapy with VSL#3 versus placebo in the ability to prevent the onset of acute pouchitis during the first year after ileal pouch-anal anastomosis. METHODS: Forty consecutive patients who underwent ileal pouch-anal anastomosis for ulcerative colitis were randomized to receive either VSL#3 (1 packet containing 900 billion bacteria/day) (n = 20) or an identical placebo (n = 20) immediately after ileostomy closure for 1 year. The patients were assessed clinically, endoscopically, and histologically after 1, 3, 6, 9, and 12 months. Health-related quality of life was assessed using the Inflammatory Bowel Disease Questionnaire. RESULTS: Two of the 20 patients (10%) treated with VSL#3 had an episode of acute pouchitis compared with 8 of the 20 patients (40%) treated with placebo (log-rank test, z = 2.273; P < 0.05). Treatment with VSL#3 determined a significant improvement in Inflammatory Bowel Disease Questionnaire score, whereas this was not the case with placebo. CONCLUSIONS: Treatment with VSL#3 is effective in the prevention of the onset of acute pouchitis and improves quality of life of patients with ileal pouch-anal anastomosis.},

   abstract = {Major advances in the understanding of the aetio-pathogenesis and genetics of inflammatory bowel disease have been accompanied by an escalation in the sophistication of immunomodulatory inflammatory bowel disease therapeutics. However, the basic 'triple' therapy (5-aminosalicylates, corticosteroids, azathioprine) and nutrition have maintained their central role in the management of patients with inflammatory bowel disease over recent decades. This review provides an overview of the supportive and therapeutic perspectives of nutrition in adult inflammatory bowel disease. The objective of supportive nutrition is to correct malnutrition in terms of calorie intake or specific macro- or micronutrients. Of particular clinical relevance is deficiency in calcium, vitamin D, folate, vitamin B12 and zinc. There is justifiably a growing sense of unease amongst clinicians and patients with regard to the long-term use of corticosteroids in inflammatory bowel disease. This, rather than arguments about efficacy, should be the catalyst for revisiting the use of enteral nutrition as primary treatment in Crohn's disease. Treatment failure is usually related to a failure to comply with enteral nutrition. Potential factors that militate against successful completion of enteral nutrition are feed palatability, inability to stay on a solid-free diet for weeks, social inconvenience and transient feed-related adverse reactions. Actions that can be taken to improve treatment outcome include the provision of good support from dietitians and clinicians for the duration of treatment and the subsequent 'weaning' period. There is evidence to support a gradual return to a normal diet through exclusion-re-introduction or other dietary regimen following the completion of enteral nutrition to increase remission rates. We also review the evidence for emerging therapies, such as glutamine, growth factors and short-chain fatty acids. The future may see the evolution of enteral nutrition into an important therapeutic strategy, and the design of a 'Crohn's disease-specific formulation' that is individually tailored, acceptable to patients, cost-effective, free from adverse side-effects and combines enteral nutrition with novel pre- and pro-biotics and other factors.},

   abstract = {Nowadays. there is a growing interest in probiotics as a safe way of changing the intestinal bacterial flora. Probiotics may have potential in several gastroenterological conditions, especially when the intestinal flora has been disturbed. Most scientific evidence is available for diarrhoea patients treated with Lactobacillus GG, Lactobacillus reuteri or Saccharomyces boulardii. Meta-analyses have shown an overall reduction in the risk of antibiotic-associated diarrhoea during treatment with probiotics, and benefits have also been demonstrated for patients with rota-virus-associated diarrhoea. Patients with inflammatory bowel disease, an inflammatory disorder characterized by a change in the intestinal flora, are another important target group for which probiotics may be beneficial. It has been claimed that in ulcerative colitis and Crohn disease patients, lactobacilli, S. boulardii and Escherichia coli reduce relapses. but most studies were not placebo-controlled. A reduction in relapses has also been demonstrated in pouchitis patients treated with a multispecies probiotic. Irritable bowel syndrome might be another clinical indication for probiotic therapy, but results of clinical trials performed in these patients are inconsistent. Additionally, probiotics may improve lactose absorption. Helicobacter pylori eradication and constipation. Finally, in animal models of colorectal cancer, treatment with probiotics reduces the prevalence of this disease, and in humans the amount of genotoxic substances in faeces has been reduced. In conclusion, the results of studies on the effects of probiotics in gastrointestinal conditions are encouraging. but well-designed placebo-controlled studies are warranted before recommendations for therapeutic or preventive use can be given. Many issues still have to be resolved, including optimal dose and duration of treatment, selection of and differences between the several available probiotic strains, and, importantly, their mechanisms of actions have to be elucidated.},

   abstract = {PURPOSE: Proctocolectomy with ileal pouch-anal anastomosis is the operation of choice for patients with refractory or fulminant ulcerative colitis. The most common long-term complication in these patients is pouchitis. This study was designed to investigate the efficacy of probiotic Lactobacillus rhamnosus GG in long-term delaying the first onset of pouchitis. METHODS: Between 1989 and 2001, a consecutive series of 127 patients presenting with ulcerative colitis underwent an ileal pouch-anal anastomosis at the Erasmus Medical Center in Rotterdam. Histopathologic investigation of the resected specimens revealed unsuspected Crohn's disease in five patients. Postoperative complications resulted in pouch excision in five patients. The remaining 117 patients were included in this study. All episodes of pouchitis occurring in this group were analyzed. Pouchitis was diagnosed on the basis of clinical symptoms and endoscopic and histologic features. The 39 patients, who underwent an ileal pouch-anal anastomosis between 1996 and 2001, started immediately after the operation with the daily intake of L. rhamnosus GG in a fermented product. The 78 patients, in whom an ileal pouch-anal anastomosis was performed between 1989 and 1996, received no L. rhamnosus GG. RESULTS: Except for the duration of follow-up, the patient characteristics, indications for proctocolectomy, number of postoperative complications, and functional outcome were similar in both groups. First episodes of pouchitis were observed less frequently in patients with a daily intake of L. rhamnosus GG (cumulative risk at 3 years: 7 vs. 29 percent; P = 0.011). CONCLUSIONS: Daily intake of fermented products containing L. rhamnosus GG provides significant clinical benefit, without side effects. Based on the results of this study, we recommend a daily intake of Lactobacillus rhamnosus GG (dose 1-2 x 10(10) bacteria) to delay the first onset of pouchitis.},

In a previous report, the non-pathogenic yeast Saccharomyces boulardii was found to be beneficial in the maintenance treatment of Crohn's disease. The aim of this study was to assess the efficacy of S. boulardii in ulcerative colitis patients. METHODS: A group of 25 patients with a mild to moderate clinical flare-up of ulcerative colitis received additional treatment with S. boulardii 250 mg three times a day for 4 weeks during maintenance treatment with mesalazine. These patients were unsuitable for steroid therapy. Before and after treatment, Rachmilewitz's clinical activity index was calculated. The probiotic treatment was considered a therapeutic success only when the final score was lower than 6. RESULTS: Of the 24 patients who completed the study, 17 attained clinical remission; this was confirmed endoscopically. CONCLUSIONS: Our preliminary results suggest that S. boulardii can be effective in the treatment of ulcerative colitis. Controlled studies with this probiotic agent are warranted.},

   abstract = {Topical butyrate has been shown to be effective in the treatment of ulcerative colitis (UC). Butyrate is derived from colonic fermentation of dietary fiber, and our aim was to study whether UC patients could safely increase the fecal butyrate level by dietary means. We enrolled 22 patients with quiescent UC (mean age, 44 years; 45% women; median time from last relapse, 1 year) in a controlled pilot trial lasting 3 months. The patients were instructed to add 60 g oat bran (corresponding to 20 g dietary fiber) to the daily diet, mainly as bread slices. Fecal short-chain fatty acids (SCFAs) including butyrate, disease activity, and gastrointestinal symptoms were recorded every 4 weeks. During the oat bran intervention the fecal butyrate concentration increased by 36% at 4 weeks (from 11 +/- 2 (mean +/- SEM) to 15 +/- 2 micromol/g feces) (p < 0.01). The mean butyrate concentration over the entire test period was 14 +/- 1 micromol/g feces (p < 0.05). Remaining fecal SCFA levels were unchanged. No patient showed signs of colitis relapse. Unlike controls, the patients showed no increase in gastrointestinal complaints during the trial. Yet patients reporting abdominal pain and reflux complaints at entry showed significant improvement at 12 weeks that returned to baseline 3 months later. This pilot study shows that patients with quiescent UC can safely take a diet rich in oat bran specifically to increase the fecal butyrate level. This may have clinical implications and warrants studies of the long-term benefits of using oat bran in the maintenance therapy in UC.},

GBF has been shown to reduce both clinical activity and mucosal damage in active ulcerative colitis (UC) with mild to moderate activity. However, the efficacy of GBF in patients with UC during the remission stage is unknown. The aim of this study was to investigate the efficacy of GBF as a maintenance therapy in patients with UC while in remission. Fifty-nine patients with UC in remission according to Rachmilewitz's clinical activity index (CAI) score of </=4 were enrolled and divided into two groups, control (n=37) and GBF (n=22). Patients in the control group were given conventional treatment alone for 12 months, while patients in the GBF group received conventional therapy plus 20 g of GBF daily. The response to treatments was assessed by monitoring the CAI and endoscopic score according to Matts. Significantly better CAI values were seen in the GBF group at 3, 6, and 12 months compared with the values in the control group. The cumulative recurrence rate in the GBF group with steroid tapering treatment was significantly lower compared with the value in the control group. No side effects related to GBF were observed. GBF appeared to be effective and safe as a maintenance therapy to taper steroid dose and prolong remission in patients with UC.},

   abstract = {The gut flora plays a fundamental role in maintaining normal intestinal function. A disturbance of this flora, or the host response to this flora, has been clearly demonstrated to play a role in the pathogenesis of inflammatory bowel disease (IBD). This has led to attempts to modify the bacterial flora with "live non-pathogenic organisms that confer health benefits by improving the microbial balance," otherwise known as probiotics. Recent attention has focused on this potential strategy to treat or prevent IBD. The potential therapeutic benefit is enhanced by the natural and apparently safe approach that probiotics offer. Animal models of colitis have provided the proof of principle that probiotics can prevent and treat established intestinal inflammation. Controlled clinical studies have demonstrated the efficacy of probiotics in the maintenance of remission of pouchitis, prophylaxis of pouchitis after the formation of an ileoanal reservoir, maintenance of remission of ulcerative colitis, and treatment of Crohn's disease. However, large controlled trials are needed to definitively establish the place for probiotics in the treatment of IBD and resolve issues such as the dose, duration, frequency of treatment, and use of single or multiple strains. Research is focusing on establishing the mechanism of action, so that treatments with individually tailored properties are developed and innovative approaches are explored.},

Although the exact cause of ulcerative colitis remains undetermined, the condition appears to be related to a combination of genetic and environmental factors. While conventional treatments can be effective in maintaining remission and decreasing the length of active disease periods, the treatments are not without side effects, and a significant number of people suffering from UC fail to respond to even the strongest drugs. This article reviews potential unconventional treatments - transdermal nicotine, heparin, melatonin, DHEA, probiotics, fiber, dietary changes, botanicals, essential fatty acids, and other nutrients - that may be considered in conjunction with conventional approaches or as part of a comprehensive alternative treatment protocol. In addition this review addresses risk factors, pathogenesis, nutrient deficiencies, conventional treatment approaches, and extra-intestinal manifestations of the disease.},

METHODS: The subjects were randomly divided into two groups: a group with BFM supplementation (BFM group, 11 subjects) and a control group (control group, 10 subjects). The BFM group was given 100 mL/day of BFM for one year. Colonoscopies, general blood markers and examinations of intestinal flora including the analysis of fecal organic acids were performed at the commencement of the study and after one year. RESULTS: Exacerbation of symptoms was seen in 3 out of 11 subjects in the BFM group and in 9 out of 10 in the control group. Log rank statistic analysis of the cumulative exacerbation rates showed a significant reduction in exacerbations for the BFM group (p = 0.0184). The analysis of microflora and the organic acids in the feces showed a significant reduction in the relative proportion of B. vulgatus in Bacteroidaceae and butyrate concentration, respectively, after supplementation with BFM, in comparison with before. CONCLUSION: Supplementation with the BFM product was successful in maintaining remission and had possible preventive effects on the relapse of ulcerative colitis.},

   abstract = {BACKGROUND AND AIMS: The causes of relapses of ulcerative colitis (UC) are unknown. Dietary factors have been implicated in the pathogenesis of UC. The aim of this study was to determine which dietary factors are associated with an increased risk of relapse of UC. METHODS: A prospective cohort study was performed with UC patients in remission, recruited from two district general hospitals, who were followed for one year to determine the effect of habitual diet on relapse. Relapse was defined using a validated disease activity index. Nutrient intake was assessed using a food frequency questionnaire and categorised into tertiles. Adjusted odds ratios for relapse were determined using multivariate logistic regression, controlling for non-dietary factors. RESULTS: A total of 191 patients were recruited and 96% completed the study. Fifty two per cent of patients relapsed. Consumption of meat (odds ratio (OR) 3.2 (95% confidence intervals (CI) 1.3-7.8)), particularly red and processed meat (OR 5.19 (95% CI 2.1-12.9)), protein (OR 3.00 (95% CI 1.25-7.19)), and alcohol (OR 2.71 (95% CI 1.1-6.67)) in the top tertile of intake increased the likelihood of relapse compared with the bottom tertile of intake. High sulphur (OR 2.76 (95% CI 1.19-6.4)) or sulphate (OR 2.6 (95% CI 1.08-6.3)) intakes were also associated with relapse and may offer an explanation for the observed increased likelihood of relapse. CONCLUSIONS: Potentially modifiable dietary factors, such as a high meat or alcoholic beverage intake, have been identified that are associated with an increased likelihood of relapse for UC patients. Further studies are needed to determine if it is the sulphur compounds within these foods that mediates the likelihood of relapse and if reducing their intake would reduce relapse frequency.},

We wished to determine the nature of and reasons for patients' dietary beliefs and their effect on relapse and nutrient intake. METHODS: In a 1-year prospective cohort study, patients' nutrient intake and disease activity were measured with a validated food frequency questionnaire and disease activity index. Food beliefs, demographics and disease characteristics were recorded. The influence of beliefs on the risk of relapse and nutrient intake were examined using chi-squared and Mann-Whitney U-tests. RESULTS: One hundred and eighty-three patients were studied and 52% relapsed. Sixty-eight per cent held dietary beliefs and reported modifying their intake accordingly. The most common reported behaviour was the avoidance of milk and dairy products. Food beliefs were more common amongst those who had received dietary advice. No reported behaviour reduced the risk of relapse, but patients who avoided dairy products had a significantly lower intake of calcium. Folate intake was below UK recommended levels in 13% of patients. CONCLUSIONS: Patients with ulcerative colitis believe that many foods are harmful or helpful to their disease activity. Commonly held beliefs do not modify the risk of relapse, but do adversely affect nutrient intake.},

   abstract = {Inflammatory bowel syndrome (IBS) mainly includes ulcerative colitis (UC) and Crohn's disease (CD). UC and CD are chronic and recurrent conditions, with a tendency to exacerbations and remissions. The incidence of diseases worldwide has increased over the last years. Although the etiology of inflammatory bowel syndrome has been studied intensively it still remains unclear. The development and persistence of inflammation is an effect of numerous factors: proinflammatory (aggressive), regulating bowel mucosa homeostasis and protective factors. Proinflammatory factors include intestinal bacteria, bile acids, digestive enzymes, lipopolysaccharides and peptidoglycans. Protective mechanisms are impermeability of mucosa barrier, presence of intestinal mucus, activity of secretive immunoglobulins, some prostaglandins and interleukins, glutamine, somatostatin, cortisol and short-chain fatty acids. Factors modifying intestinal mucosa homeostasis consist of genetically determined immunoregulators and activity of intestinal mucosa barrier and some environmental factors (diet, smoking, infections, stress, antibiotics and others). Environmental factors are jointly responsible for IBS occurrence in case of genetically determined dysregulation leading to proinflammatory cytokines overproduction or disturbances in synthesis of cytokines regulating intestinal mucosa homeostasis.},

   abstract = {Because the intestinal microflora play an important role in the development of inflammatory bowel disease (IBD), there is currently some interest in the manipulation of the composition of the microflora towards a potentially more remedial community. This review summarizes the clinical and experimental efficacy of the manipulation of microflora by the use of prebiotics, probiotics, synbiotics, and antibiotics in IBD. Prebiotics, defined as nondigestible food ingredients that beneficially affect the host by selectively stimulating the growth or activity of one or a limited number of bacterial species already resident in the colon, can modulate the colonic microbiota by increasing the number of specific bacteria and thus changing the composition of the microbiota. Prebiotics for IBD include lactosucrose, oligofructose, inulin, bran, psyllium, and germinated barley foodstuff (GBF). GBF, which mainly consists of dietary fiber and glutamine-rich protein, is a prebiotic foodstuff for ulcerative colitis. GBF has shown to be converted into a preferential nutrient for colonocytes through Eubacterium and Bifidobacterium and also inactivate nuclear factor kappa B (NFkB). Moreover, it exhibits a potent water-holding capacity and bile-acid binding capacity. Probiotics, which are microbial food supplements that beneficially affect the host by improving the intestinal microbial balance, have been used to change the composition of colonic microbiota. The approaches for IBD include VSL#3, Nissle1917, Clostridium butyricum and Bifidobacterium-fermented milk. Use of Lactococci secreting IL-10 provides excellent results. The combination of prebiotics and probiotics in a synbiotic has not been studied in IBD but is promising. The use of antibiotics continues to be of interest. Although these strategies hold great promise and appear to be useful in some settings, more clinical study is needed to firmly establish the relevance of these therapies.},

In our previous study, we carried out a clinical trial of GBF with mildly to moderately active UC patients and showed that GBF treatment was able to attenuate the symptoms of UC in a relatively short-term. The aim of this study was to investigate the efficacy of long-term administration of GBF in the treatment of UC in a multi-center open trial. Twenty-one patients with mildly to moderately active UC received 20-30 g of GBF for 24 weeks in an open-label protocol while baseline treatments (5-amino-salicyrate compounds and/or steroids) were continued. The response to the GBF treatment was evaluated using a clinical scoring and after 24 weeks of observation, the GBF group showed a significant decrease in clinical activity index (especially, the degree of visible blood in stools and the presence of nocturnal diarrhea) compared with the control group (p<0.05). No side effects related to GBF were observed. In conclusion, GBF can reduce the clinical activity of UC over long-term as well as short-term administration. Nutraceutical GBF therapy may have a place in long-term management of UC, but controlled studies are needed to demonstrate its efficacy in the treatment of this disorder.},

The aim of this study was to evaluate the anti-inflammatory effects of GBF on colitis in terms of the epithelial inflammatory response. METHODS: Mice with dextran sulfate sodium-induced colitis were used. The effects of GBF on the colitis were evaluated by measuring the body weight; disease activity; mucosal damage (histology, mucosal inflammatory parameters, nuclear factor kappa B [NFkB] activation, and signal transducer and activator of transcription 3 [STAT3]); serum interleukin 6 (IL-6) level; cecal short-chain fatty acids (SCFAs); and bile acid contents. RESULTS: GBF significantly prevented disease activity and body weight loss after induction of colitis. Serum IL-6 level and mucosal STAT3 expression were also significantly attenuated, with a conspicuous reduction of mucosal damage; NFkB activity showed the same tendency. Cecal butyrate content was significantly higher and, interestingly, GBF mice had lower bile acid concentrations than the control group. CONCLUSIONS: GBF has the potential to reduce the epithelial inflammatory response by depressing STAT-3 expression and inhibiting NFkB binding activity. These effects may be brought about by an increase of butyrate production and adsorption of bile acids.},

AIM: To conduct a randomized placebo-controlled trial of bifidobacteria-fermented milk supplementation as a dietary adjunct in treating active ulcerative colitis. METHODS: Twenty patients with mild to moderate, active, ulcerative colitis randomly received 100 mL/day of bifidobacteria-fermented milk or placebo for 12 weeks with conventional treatment. RESULTS: Clinical and endoscopic activity indices and histological scores were similar in the two groups before treatment. Although improvements were significant in both groups, the clinical activity index was significantly lower in the bifidobacteria-fermented milk than in the placebo group after treatment. The post-treatment endoscopic activity index and histological score were significantly reduced in the bifidobacteria-fermented milk, but not the placebo group. Increases in faecal butyrate, propionate and short-chain fatty acid concentrations were significant in the bifidobacteria-fermented milk, but not the placebo group. No adverse effects were observed in either group. CONCLUSION: Supplementation with this bifidobacteria-fermented milk product is safe and more effective than conventional treatment alone, suggesting possible beneficial effects in managing active ulcerative colitis. This is a pilot study and further larger studies are required to confirm the result these preliminary results.},

   abstract = {It was initially hypothesized that resistant starches, i.e., starch that enters the colon, would have protective effects on chronic colonic diseases, including reduction of colon cancer risk and in the treatment of ulcerative colitis. Recent studies have confirmed the ability of resistant starch to increase fecal bulk, increase the molar ratio of butyrate in relation to other short-chain fatty acids, and dilute fecal bile acids. However the ability of resistant starch to reduce luminal concentrations of compounds that are damaging to the colonic mucosa, including fecal ammonia, phenols, and N-nitroso compounds, still requires clear demonstration. As such, the effectiveness of resistant starch in preventing or treating colonic diseases remains to be assessed. Nevertheless, there is a fraction of what has been termed resistant (RS1) starch, which enters the colon and acts as slowly digested or lente carbohydrate in the small intestine. Foods in this class are low glycemic index and have been shown to reduce the risk of chronic disease. They have been associated with systemic physiological effects such as reduced postprandial insulin levels and higher HDL cholesterol levels. Consumption of low glycemic index foods has been shown to be related to reductions in risk of coronary heart disease and Type 2 diabetes. Type 2 diabetes has in turn been related to a higher risk of colon cancer. If carbohydrates have a protective role in colon cancer prevention this may lie partly in the systemic effects of low glycemic index foods. The colonic advantages of different carbohydrates, varying in their glycemic index and resistant starch content, therefore, remain to be determined. However, as recent positive research findings continue to mount, there is reason for optimism over the possible health advantages of those resistant starches, which are slowly digested in the small intestine.},

(b) The available data regarding pouchitis are limited, but the therapeutic effect seems to be excellent. (c) In the case of Crohn's disease, the role of probiotics is not clearly defined, thus the results of new trials have to be awaited before probiotic therapy is recommended. (d) Further indications such as antibiotic-associated diarrhea, acute pancreatitis or irritable bowel syndrome have been reported recently. The results of these clinical trials have been encouraging, but they often included only a small number of patients and therefore a clear-cut assessment seems difficult at the moment.},

   abstract = {BACKGROUND: Alimentary antigens may play a role in the perpetuation of inflammation in Crohn's disease (CD). Yeast antigens are widespread components of food. A proportion of CD patients develop antibodies against the yeast Saccharomyces cerevisiae (ASCA), but little is known about the cellular immune reactivity against food antigens in antibody-positive and -negative patients. METHODS: Lymphocytes from patients with CD, ulcerative colitis, and healthy controls were tested for their proliferative response after stimulation with the yeast antigen mannan and ovalbumin. The cellular phenotypes and activation markers were analyzed via FACS. Cytokine concentrations and antibody titers were determined by ELISA. RESULTS: Only lymphocytes of ASCA-positive patients with CD proliferated after stimulation with mannan. These lymphocytes expressed increased activation markers (CD25, CD69). Activation of T cells was mediated by antigen-presenting cells and was associated with increased tumor necrosis factor-alpha (TNF-alpha) levels. The immune reactivity to ovalbumin was predominantly found in CD patients. It was weaker compared with mannan, independent of ASCA status, and also present in healthy controls. CONCLUSIONS: A disturbed humoral and cellular response to the yeast antigen mannan is specifically seen in a subgroup of CD patients. This phenomenon may be due to a loss of tolerance toward yeast and is possibly genetically determined.},

   abstract = {Treatment with antibiotics in inflammatory bowel disease has a long tradition and is widely used. The indications for antibiotic therapy are wide ranging, from specific situations such as abscesses or fistulae, to patients with severe disease (as an unspecific 'protective' measure), and to address the hypothesis that the enteric flora as a whole, or specific microorganisms such as mycobacteria, are involved in the pathogenesis of inflammatory bowel disease. The best-studied single antibiotic compound is metronidazole. However, overall, the scientific basis for the use of antibiotics is limited, which may reflect a lack of interest from sponsors within the pharmaceutical industry. Despite this weak evidence base, antibiotics are a globally established therapeutic tool in inflammatory bowel disease. Growing evidence from human and animal studies points towards a pivotal pathogenetic role of intestinal bacteria in inflammatory bowel disease. In view of these experimental findings, clinical trials have been undertaken to elucidate the therapeutic effects of probiotics in inflammatory bowel disease. Probiotics are viable nonpathogenic microorganisms which confer health benefits to the host by improving the microbial balance of the indigenous microflora. So far, of the many candidates, one specific strain (Escherichia coli Nissle 1917) and a mixture of eight different bacteria have demonstrated convincing therapeutic efficacy in controlled studies. Maintenance therapy in ulcerative colitis and prevention therapy, as well as the treatment of pouchitis, have emerged as areas in which probiotic therapy offers a valid therapeutic alternative to current treatments. Further investigations may detect additional clinically effective probiotics and other clinical indications.},

   abstract = {BACKGROUND AND AIMS: Evidence exists for the pathogenic role of the enteric flora in inflammatory bowel disease. Probiotics contain living microorganisms which exert health effects on the host. We compared the efficacy in maintaining remission of the probiotic preparation Escherichia coli Nissle 1917 and established therapy with mesalazine in patients with ulcerative colitis. PATIENTS AND METHODS: In total, 327 patients were recruited and assigned to a double blind, double dummy trial to receive either the probiotic drug 200 mg once daily (n = 162) or mesalazine 500 mg three times daily (n = 165). The study lasted for 12 months and patients were assessed by clinical and endoscopic activity indices (Rachmilewitz) as well as by histology. The primary aim of the study was to confirm equivalent efficacy of the two drugs in the prevention of relapses. RESULTS: The per protocol analysis revealed relapses in 40/110 (36.4%) patients in the E coli Nissle 1917 group and 38/112 (33.9%) in the mesalazine group (significant equivalence p = 0.003). Subgroup analyses showed no differences between the treatment groups in terms of duration and localisation of disease or pretrial treatment. Safety profile and tolerability were very good for both groups and were not different. CONCLUSIONS: The probiotic drug E coli Nissle 1917 shows efficacy and safety in maintaining remission equivalent to the gold standard mesalazine in patients with ulcerative colitis. The effectiveness of probiotic treatment further underlines the pathogenetic significance of the enteric flora.},

   abstract = {PURPOSE: Pouchitis has been associated with abnormal bacterial flora responding to antibiotics. Dietary factors may play a role in modifying the qualitative and quantitative components of the microflora. We evaluated interactions between nutritional factors, fecal and mucosal bacterial flora, and mucosal morphology in patients with a history of pouchitis compared with patients with optimal outcome at least five years after ileal pouch-anal anastomosis for ulcerative colitis. METHODS: Thirty-two patients were enrolled in the study: 11 (7 males; mean age, 49.8 years) with optimal outcome and 21 (11 males; mean age, 47.3 years) with pouchitis history. A seven-day food diary was recorded, endoscopy performed, and biopsies taken from the pouch for histology, mucin staining, and bacterial culture. Fresh fecal samples were quantitatively cultured, and fecal bile acids analyzed by gas-liquid chromatography. RESULTS: No differences existed in mean nutrient intake, composition of fecal bile acids, or microbial tissue biopsy cultures between the groups with and without pouchitis. Those with optimal outcome tended to have more benign disease course of ulcerative colitis than patients with pouchitis. In those patients, fecal concentrations (log10 colony-forming unit/g) of anaerobes and aerobes were significantly higher (P = 0.007). Degree of villous atrophy and colonic metaplasia were both associated with fecal anaerobic flora. Low intake of lactose was associated with sulfomucin predominance. A negative correlation existed between fecal aerobes and dietary lactose consumption. CONCLUSIONS: A higher total load of fecal anaerobic bacterial flora is strongly associated with degree of colonic metaplasia, villous atrophy, and inflammation activity after surgery for ulcerative colitis. An association existed between dietary lactose, fecal bacteria, and pouch morphology. Lactose may have prebiotic properties.},

We evaluated the effects of a dietary anti-oxidant, Antioxidant Biofactor (AOB), a processed grain food, on dextran sulfate sodium (DSS)-induced colitis in mice. Female ICR mice were fed a diet containing 0.1% or 1% AOB for 2 weeks, during which they were given 5% DSS in drinking water for the latter 1 week to induce colitis. A diet containing 1% AOB, but not that with 0.1% AOB, attenuated DSS-induced body weight loss and colon shortening (each, P < 0.05), and dramatically improved colitis histologic scores. In addition, DSS-induced increases in colonic mucosal IL-1beta, but not TNF-alpha, protein levels were significantly abrogated in 1% AOB-fed mice (P < 0.05). Further, 1% dietary AOB abolished the expression of IL-1beta mRNA levels in colonic mucosa (P < 0.01). Our results suggest that AOB is effective for the prevention of DSS-induced colitis in mice.},

Laser Doppler flowmetry (LDF) has been used successfully to measure gastric and colonic mucosal perfusion in humans. The aim of this study was to evaluate the effect of intervention with probiotics on ileal pouch inflammation and perfusion in the pouch, assessed by endoscopy, histology, fecal calprotectin and LDF. METHODS: A fermented milk product (Cultura; 500 ml) containing live lactobacilli (La-5) and bifidobacteria (Bb-12) was given daily for 4 weeks to 10 patients operated with ileal-pouch-anal anastomosis (IPAA) for ulcerative colitis (UC). Mucosal perfusion was measured with LDF and the degree of inflammation was examined at predefined levels of the distal bowel by endoscopy and histology. Stool samples were cultured for lactobacilli and bifidobacteria and calprotectin were measured before and after intervention. RESULTS: The LDF measurements were reproducible in the pelvic pouch at each of the predefined levels, but did not change after intervention. The mucosal perfusion was reduced in the distal compared to the proximal part of the pouch. Calprotectin levels did not change significantly after intervention. The median endoscopic score for inflammation was significantly reduced by 50% after intervention, whereas the histological score did not change significantly. CONCLUSION: The results suggest that probiotics primarily act superficially, with change of gross appearance of the mucosa at endoscopy, but without significant effect on histological picture, mucosal perfusion or faecal calprotectin, during a relatively short period of 4 weeks.},

   abstract = {BACKGROUND: Pouchitis is a common and troublesome condition in patients operated on with ileal-pouch-anal-anastomosis (IPAA). A disturbed mucosal perfusion in the pouch has been suggested as a possible cause. Laser Doppler flowmetry (LDF) has been used successfully to measure gastric and colonic mucosal perfusion in humans. In a previous study, we demonstrated a reduced mucosal perfusion in the distal part of the pouch, during probiotic intervention, examined by LDF measurement. The aim of the present study was to confirm our previous results in a much larger material, and to compare the results of LDF measurements and inflammatory activity in ulcerative colitis (UC) patients with those in familial adenomatous polyposis (FAP) patients. METHODS: Five hundred millilitres of a fermented milk product (Cultura), containing live lactobacilli (La-5) and bifidobacteria (Bb-12), was given daily for 4 weeks to 41 UC and 10 patients with FAP, operated on with IPAA. Mucosal perfusion was measured with LDF and the degree of inflammation was examined at predefined levels of the distal bowel by histology and faecal calprotectin measurements both before and after intervention. We also evaluated the applicability of a Pouchitis Disease Activity Index (PDAI). RESULTS: The LDF measurements were reproducible in the pelvic pouch at each of the predefined levels, but did not change during intervention. Mucosal perfusion was significantly reduced in the distal compared to the proximal part of the pouch in the UC group (P < 0.05). The perfusion levels were higher in the FAP patients compared to the UC patientsat all predefined levels (P < 0.05). Calprotectin levels and histological score did not change significantlyafter intervention in any of the groups. The calprotectin level was significantly lower in the FAP compared to the UC group both before and after intervention. The PDAI decreased in both groups from alevel considered diagnostic for pouchitis to a level considered as not active pouchitis. The decreasewas significant for the UC patients. CONCLUSIONS: The results did not demonstrate an effect of probiotics on histology, although a significant effect on the PDAI was achieved, which concurs with the previously reported effect on symptoms and endoscopic score. The significantly reduced blood flow in the UC group compared to the FAP group, operated on with the same procedure, and the significantly increased calprotectin levels in the UC group, are original findings. Both findings may be related to an increased risk for pouchitis among UC patients. The lack of effect of intervention on mucosal perfusion does not exclude a role for reduced circulation as a cause of pouchitis based on the reduced LDF measurements in the distal part of the pouch.},

   abstract = {Recent controlled and uncontrolled trial data in inflammatory bowel disease have suggested several new avenues of possible therapies and refined our understanding of the uses and selectiveness of anti-tumor necrosis factor (TNF)-based therapies. Infliximab remains the only proven effective anti-TNF therapy, whereas others have proven ineffective (etanercept, CDP-571) or of limited utility (thalidomide, CDP-870). A Crohn's disease Clinical trial Evaluating infliximab in a New long-term Treatment regimen (ACCENT I) and ACCENT II trials supported the strategy of using 5 to 10 mg/kg of infliximab on an every 8-week basis for maintenance of remission, although in clinical practice many physicians take variable approaches to maintenance of remission dosing schedules. On the other hand, no controlled trial data to date have supported the use of infliximab in ulcerative colitis. Therapies utilizing novel mechanistic approaches, such as hematopoietic growth factors, mitogen-activated protein (MAP)-kinase inhibition, and peroxisome proliferator activated receptor gamma ligand receptor binding have shown promise in small uncontrolled trials and await confirmation of their utility in randomized, placebo-controlled trials. Newer biologic (natalizumab) or cytokine-based therapies (monoclonal antibody to interleukin-6) have shown preliminary evidence of efficacy in controlled trials, but neither have yet been approved by the US Food and Drug Administration and, therefore, have not been commercialized. However, tacrolimus, a potent calcineurin inhibitor and inhibitor of interleukin-2 expression, has shown efficacy in Crohn's disease, albeit at the cost of substantial potential toxicity.},

   abstract = {OBJECTIVE: To investigate the effect of a rye, high-fibre diet (HFD) vs a wheat, low-fibre diet (LFD), meal frequency, nibbling (Nib, seven times a day) or ordinary (Ord, three times a day), and their combined effects on blood glucose, insulin, lipids, urinary C-peptide and ileal excretion of energy, cholesterol and bile acids in humans. DESIGN: LFD period with Nib or Ord meal frequency followed by an HFD diet with Nib or Ord meal frequency in randomized, crossover design. SETTING: Outpatients of ileostomy volunteers were called for an investigation in research word. SUBJECTS: A total of 10 subjects (two female subjects, age 34 and 51 y; eight males, mean age 54.4 y, range 43-65 y) participated in the experiment. All subjects were proctocolectomized for ulcerative colitis (mean 16.0 y, range 8-29 y before the study). INTERVENTION: In total, 10 ileostomy subjects started with LFD for 2 weeks, the first week on either Nib (five subjects) or Ord (five subjects) and the second week on the other meal frequencies, in a crossover design, followed by a wash-out week, and continued with HFD period for 2 weeks in the same meal frequency manner. All foods consumed in both Nib or Ord regimens were identical and a high-fibre rye bread was used in the HFD period and a low-fibre wheat bread in the LFD period. MAIN OUTCOME MEASURES: Day-profiles of blood glucose, insulin and lipids, blood lipids before and after dietary intervention, and excretion of steroids in the effluents and C-peptide in the urine. RESULTS: During the Nib regimen, plasma glucose and insulin peaks were lower at the end of the day with HFD compared with LFD. Urinary C-peptide excretion was significantly higher in the day-time on LFD compared with HFD (LFD-Ord vs HFD-Ord, P < 0.01; LFD-Nib vs HFD-Nib, P < 0.01). Plasma free-cholesterol, total cholesterol, triglycerides and phospholipids were significantly higher (P < 0.05) after LFD than after HFD with the Nib regimen. A higher excretion of energy (P < 0.05) and chenodeoxycholic acid (P < 0.05) were observed with HFD compared with LFD regardless of meal frequency. A higher daily excretion of cholic acid, total bile acids, cholesterol, net cholesterol and net sterols (P < 0.05) was observed on HFD compared with LFD with the Nib regimen. CONCLUSIONS: An HFD decreased insulin secretion measured as a decreased excretion of C-peptide in urine and as decreased plasma insulin peaks at the end of the day during a Nib regimen. The smoother glycaemic responses at the end of the day during a Nib regimen may be a consequence of a second meal phenomenon, possibly related to the nature of dietary fibre complex.},

   abstract = {Large numbers of different bacterial species are resident in the lumen of the distal gastrointestinal tract. The normal intestinal host-microbial interactions are not well understood, but the relationship is generally believed to be either mutually beneficial or beneficial to one without disadvantage to the other. Animal model and clinical studies suggest that IBD (inflammatory bowel disease) may develop in a susceptible individual when the normal host-bacterial relationship is dysregulated. In addition to rodent models, this article reviews studies that have investigated the cellular and molecular mechanisms of interactions between intestinal mucosal cells and the resident luminal bacteria in healthy individuals and patients with ulcerative colitis and Crohn's disease. Mechanisms by which the intestinal mucosa is able to avoid pro-inflammatory responses to commensal bacteria (and their products) but able to respond appropriately to luminal pathogens is currently an area of active investigation. Such studies are beginning to provide important clues regarding possible alterations in the mucosa that lead to the development of pro-inflammatory responses to resident bacteria in patients with IBD. Approaches to alter the intestinal microflora for therapeutic purposes and their potential mechanisms of action are also discussed.},

   abstract = {Inflammatory bowel disease is a complicated condition, including Crohn's disease, ulcerative colitis, microscopic colitis, and indeterminate colitis, that affects the intestine and several extraintestinal sites. There has been much debate regarding whether Crohn's disease and ulcerative colitis are distinct entities or if they exist along a continuum of the same disease process. In this article, the pathogenic mechanisms and clinical manifestations of inflammatory bowel disease are reviewed, as well as treatment options. Because Crohn's disease and ulcerative colitis are chronic diseases, they have an important economic effect on our healthcare system and the United States as a whole. Some newer and more expensive treatment options may provide overall cost savings in select patient populations because of decreased use of healthcare resources.},

   abstract = {BACKGROUND & AIMS: Reports of tuberculosis (TB) in patients administered infliximab prompted the Food and Drug Administration to recommend that all patients being considered for this therapy be evaluated for the risk for latent TB infection by means of a tuberculin skin test (TST). The aim of this study is to evaluate the utility of a TST as an adequate screen for TB exposure in patients with inflammatory bowel disease (IBD). METHODS: Eighty-two consecutive patients with IBD (Crohn's disease, 70 patients; ulcerative colitis, 4 patients; indeterminate colitis, 8 patients) seen at Cedars-Sinai Medical Center IBD Center (Los Angeles, CA) being treated with or considered for infliximab therapy underwent a standard intradermal purified protein derivative (PPD) TST before or between infusions of infliximab. One or more control antigens (Candida, tetanus, and/or mumps) were concurrently placed on 69 of these patients. Skin tests were read for induration at 48-72 hours after placement, and results were recorded. RESULTS: None of 82 patients had a positive PPD TST result. Overall, 71% of patients (49 of 69 patients) with controls placed failed to react to any antigen. Eighty-three percent of patients (40 of 48 patients) who were administered corticosteroids and/or immunosuppressive medications, not including infliximab, for at least 1 month were anergic compared with 43% of patients (9 of 21 patients; P < 0.002) who were not administered those medications. CONCLUSIONS: Given the high prevalence of anergy, a negative TST result in patients with IBD administered infliximab is an unreliable indicator for TB exposure. Evaluation for TB risks should include not only a TST, but also a detailed history of travel, TB exposures, and such symptoms as chronic cough and weight loss, and a chest radiograph should be considered.},

   abstract = {Ulcerative colitis (UC) and Crohn's disease are inflammatory disorders of unknown cause and difficult to treat, though some synthetic chemicals, including ligands for peroxisome proliferator-activated receptors (PPARs), are anticipated to be useful drugs. In contrast, few food phytochemicals have been reported to suppress colitis in animal models. The present study was undertaken to explore the suppressive efficacy of zerumbone (ZER), a sesquiterpenoid present in the rhizome of Zingiber zerumbet Smith that is used as a condiment in Southeast Asian countries and known to be a potent suppressant of cyclooxygenase (COX)-2 and inducible nitric oxide synthase expression in cell culture systems. Acute colitis was induced by exposing female ICR mice to 5% DSS in drinking water for 1 week. One week prior to DSS administration, the experimental mice were fed ZER alone, nimesulide (NIM, a selective COX-2 inhibitor) alone, or both in combination (1000 ppm each) for a total of 2 weeks. Inflammatory biomarkers, i.e. interleukin (IL)-1alpha and IL-1beta, tumor necrosis factor (TNF)-alpha, and prostaglandin (PG)E(2) and PGF(2alpha) in colonic mucosa were quantified by an enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay in conjunction with histological alterations. Oral feeding of ZER significantly lowered the levels of IL-1beta [inhibitory rate (IR)=34%], TNF-alpha (IR=29%), and PGE(2) (IR=73%) and suppressed DSS-induced colitis, whereas NIM suppressed the histological changes induced by DSS without affecting inflammatory biomarkers. However, their treatment in combination was most effective for suppressing these biomarkers. Our results suggest that ZER is a novel food factor for mitigating experimental UC and that use of a combination of agents, with different modes of actions, may be an effective anti-inflammatory strategy.},

   abstract = {Ulcerative colitis seldom associated with nutritive and/or salicylate allergy. Authors present a case of both allergic events at the course of the disease. In 1996 a 19-year-old girl was referred with a history of blood in stool as well as diarrhoea, suggesting ulcerative proctitis. Biopsy revealed ulcerative colitis of the rectum mucosa with eosinophilic infiltration and 20% peripheral eosinophilia was found. Allergic origin and worm infection were ruled out, and after tinidazol treatment, four year elapsed without any signs or symptoms. In December 2000 blood in stools and upper abdominal complaints developed without peripheral eosinophilia. Gastroscopy and biopsy showed a mild chronic gastritis. Olsalazine, budesonide enema and famotidin treatment were started, but then later changed to mesalazine and pantoprazol, because of the constant stomach complaints. The next five months passed without any symptoms. The patient had to break off her seashore journey in July 2000 because of stomach complaints, vomiting and exsiccosis. Peripheral eosinophilia (27.3%) was evident. Gastroscopy revealed erosive ulcers and the biopsy showed eosinophilic gastritis. Biopsies from the jejunum, duodenum and antrum as well as enteroscopy and biopsies from the rectum showed mild eosinophilic infiltration. An allergy test proved the presence of IgE against salicylate, egg protein, seafood protein and the lymphocyte transformation test was also positive against salicylate. Oral food challenges proved to be negative and the amino-salicylate treatment was stopped. After a temporary symptom free period, bloody stools reappeared in May 2003; the peripheral eosinophilia still existed, but had decreased (22.2%). Esomeprazol, and methyl-prednisolone containing enema (40 mg/day/2 weeks) followed by budesonide enema twice a week resulted in a symptom free period and peripheral eosinophilia became almost normalised (6.2%). The authors report a case having ulcerative proctitis first, than nutritive and salicylate allergy with eosinophilic gastritis and a proctitis flare-up thereafter.},

The role of Mycobacterium avium subspecies paratuberculosis (MAP) in Crohn's disease is controversial. METHODS: We tested for MAP by PCR and culture in buffy coat preparations from 28 individuals with Crohn's disease, nine with ulcerative colitis, and 15 without inflammatory bowel disease. FINDINGS: MAP DNA in uncultured buffy coats was identified by PCR in 13 (46%) individuals with Crohn's disease, four (45%) with ulcerative colitis, and three (20%) without inflammatory bowel disease. Viable MAP was cultured from the blood of 14 (50%) patients with Crohn's disease, two (22%) with ulcerative colitis, and none of the individuals without inflammatory bowel disease. Current use of immunosuppressive medication did not correlate with a positive MAP culture. Sequencing of PCR products from MAP cultures confirmed the presence of the MAP-specific IS900 fragment. Among 11 MAP isolates assessed, we identified nine strains that were not identical. INTERPRETATION: We detected viable MAP in peripheral blood in a higher proportion of individuals with Crohn's disease than in controls. These data contribute to the evidence that MAP might be a cause of Crohn's disease.},

AIM: A novel ileocecal valve-preserving ileostomy procedure was devised to reduce high output liquid loss. METHOD: After total colectomy, the ascending colon was clamped and the terminal ileum and ileocecal valve were isolated from the cecum by dissection. The ileum was then brought out through a conventional ileostomy opening in the abdominal wall. RESULTS: Two patients with ulcerative colitis underwent ileostomy in this fashion. The stool became solid within 1 week after the start of solid food and their body weight increased by more than 10% 1 year after surgery. CONCLUSION: This novel procedure may result in an improvement in the quality of life of patients who undergo total proctocolectomy.},

   abstract = {There is considerable loss of DM during wet heat treatment of vegetables, leading to an increase in dietary fibre. Correction for the loss of DM indicates that the effects on total dietary fibre are minor. There is, however, depolymerization of the dietary fibre polysaccharides. The degradation is related to the severity of the heat treatment. Souring, freezing and mild microwave treatment have no effects. The viscosity is in general related to the extent of polymerisation. Microwave treatment has different effects on various cultivars of green beans, and the addition of salt (NaCl and CaCl2) to the boiling water changes the physico-chemical properties of soluble fibre in carrots, depending on the cation. The higher viscosity of the soluble fibre in raw carrots may partly explain the lower glucose and hormonal responses observed in healthy subjects when compared with blanched and microwave-cooked carrots. In studies on rats the amount of butyric acid in the distal colon has been shown to be higher with dietary components containing high amounts of resistant starch. Further, the fermentability is lower and the butyric acid concentration higher with composite foods than with the corresponding purified fibre fractions. In human studies the faecal concentration of butyric acid has been shown to increase in patients with ulcerative colitis when [beta-glucan-enriched oat bran (20 g fibre) is added to the diet for 12 weeks. Also, an improvement of symptoms was reported.},

METHODS: Mononuclear cells were extracted from normal and active UC colonic mucosa and incubated with pure sonicates of probiotic, commensal, and pathogenic bacteria. Cytokine secretion was measured in culture supernatant and intracellular cytokine staining measured using fluorescent-activated cytometry. RESULTS: In mononuclear cells isolated from normal mucosa, significant increases in mean IL-1beta were observed with enteropathogenic Escherichia coli (286.3 +/- 138.7 pg/mL P < 0.05) and E. coli (440.5 +/- 194.0 pg/mL P < 0.01) compared with unstimulated control cells (16.7 +/- 4.8 pg/mL). In contrast, mononuclear cells isolated from active UC mucosa produced significant increases in mean IL-1beta in response to stimulation with Salmonella dublin (230.5 +/- 38.8 pg/mL P < 0.05), enteropathogenic E. coli (231.7 +/- 45.3 pg/mL P < 0.05) and E. coli (465.4 +/- 60.2 pg/mL P < 0.001) compared with unstimulated control cells (60.7 +/- 17.1 pg/mL). Escherichia coli also produced significant mean increases of TNF-alpha and IFN-gamma compared with unstimulated control cells. No significant increases in IL-1beta, TNF-alpha or IFN-gamma were observed with Lactobacillus plantarum in cells derived from normal or inflamed mucosa. Strikingly, incubation of L. plantarum with mononuclear cells isolated from active UC mucosa resulted in significant increases of mean IL-10 (327 +/- 53.5 pg/mL, P < 0.05) compared with unstimulated control cells (29.7 +/- 13.2 pg/mL). Intracellular cytokine staining confirmed T-cell and macrophage IL-10 production after L. plantarum stimulation. CONCLUSIONS: Lactobacillus plantarum demonstrates beneficial immunomodulatory activity by increasing IL-10 synthesis and secretion in macrophages and T-cells derived from the inflamed colon. This may provide a mechanism through which probiotic bacteria ameliorate inappropriate inflammation and induce tolerance.},

   abstract = {BACKGROUND & AIMS: Dietary fiber has been proven to be beneficial in maintaining remission in human ulcerative colitis, an effect related with an increased luminal production of short-chain fatty acids (SCFA). The aim of the present study was to further investigate the mechanisms involved in the intestinal anti-inflammatory effects of dietary fiber in an experimental model of rat colitis. METHODS: HLA-B27 transgenic rats (8-10 weeks old) were fed a fiber-supplemented diet (5% Plantago ovata seeds) for 13 weeks before evaluation of the colonic inflammatory status, both histologically and biochemically. The luminal colonic production of SCFA was quantified. In vitro studies were also performed to test the interaction between two SCFA (butyrate and propionate) as inhibitors of cytokine production in THP-1 cells. RESULTS: Dietary fiber supplementation ameliorated the development of colonic inflammation in transgenic rats as evidenced by an improvement of intestinal cytoarchitecture. This effect was associated with a decrease in some of the pro-inflammatory mediators involved in the inflammatory process: nitric oxide, leukotriene B(4), tumor necrosis factor alpha (TNFalpha). The intestinal contents from fiber-treated colitic rats showed a significant higher production of SCFA, butyrate and propionate, than non-treated colitic animals. In vitro studies revealed a synergistic inhibitory effect of butyrate and propionate on TNFalpha production. CONCLUSIONS: Dietary fiber supplementation ameliorated colonic damage in HLA-B27 transgenic rats. This effects was associated with an increased production of SCFA, which can act synergistically in inhibiting the production of pro-inflammatory mediators.},

Colonic tissue of ulcerative colitis patients was examined for changes in chromosome-17-centromere copy number, loss of the p53 gene, and alterations in serum levels of the 53-kDa protein. This study was performed under the assumption that these molecular events correlate with ulcerative colitis status and duration. METHODS: Ulcerative colitis patients (n = 42) and healthy controls (n = 37) participated in the study. All participants were histopathologically and medically diagnosed. The stage of ulcerative colitis patients was stratified according to increasing risk factors for the development of colorectal cancer: left-sided colitis, pancolitis, sclerosing cholangitis, and dysplasia-associated lesions or masses. Changes in centromere number of chromosome 17 alone or in association with changes in copy number of the p53 gene were analyzed in colon tissue biopsies by fluorescence in situ hybridization. Serum p53 level was determined in blood samples by immunoprecipitation followed by separation using high-pressure liquid chromatography. RESULTS: Changes in chromosome 17 and p53 copy number and lower levels of serum p53 protein in ulcerative colitis patients directly correlated with colorectal cancer risk factors. All values significantly differed from controls. Significant direct correlations were obtained for ulcerative colitis disease duration, levels of p53 in the serum, and extent of aneuploidy. CONCLUSIONS: We demonstrate that in the colonic mucosa of ulcerative colitis patients, high levels of genomic instability, changes in p53 gene copy number, and lower levels of p53 in the serum directly correlate with the extent of disease duration and increased risk factors for colorectal cancer. Any of the measurements described herein can provide an acceptable prognostic tool in the assessment of colorectal cancer risk in ulcerative colitis patients.},

Recent advances in our understanding of the pathogenesis of UC have led to the development of novel treatments for this often debilitating condition. Aside from aminosalicylates and corticosteroids, drugs that have been used for decades in the treatment of UC, biologic agents, in addition to medications targeting specific effector mechanisms involved in the inflammatory cascade, have been used in patients with UC with varying degrees of success. Clinicians have never had as many therapeutic options for UC as they do today. Herein we review the variety of treatment options, both standard and investigational, that are available for patients with UC.},

   abstract = {Crohn's disease, ulcerative colitis, and pouchitis are caused by overly aggressive immune responses to a subset of commensal (nonpathogenic) enteric bacteria in genetically predisposed individuals. Clinical and experimental studies suggest that the relative balance of aggressive and protective bacterial species is altered in these disorders. Antibiotics can selectively decrease tissue invasion and eliminate aggressive bacterial species or globally decrease luminal and mucosal bacterial concentrations, depending on their spectrum of activity. Alternatively, administration of beneficial bacterial species (probiotics), poorly absorbed dietary oligosaccharides (prebiotics), or combined probiotics and prebiotics (synbiotics) can restore a predominance of beneficial Lactobacillus and Bifidobacterium species. Current clinical trials do not fulfill evidence-based criteria for using these agents in inflammatory bowel diseases (IBD), but multiple nonrigorous studies and widespread clinical experience suggest that metronidazole and/or ciprofloxacin can treat Crohn's colitis and ileocolitis (but not isolated ileal disease), perianal fistulae and pouchitis, whereas selected probiotic preparations prevent relapse of quiescent ulcerative colitis and relapsing pouchitis. These physiologic approaches offer considerable promise for treating IBD, but must be supported by rigorous controlled therapeutic trials that consider clinical disease before their widespread clinical acceptance. These agents likely will become an integral component of treating IBD in combination with traditional anti-inflammatory and immunosuppressive agents.},

   abstract = {Inflammatory bowel disease (IBD) is associated with an increased incidence of osteoporosis. Osteoporosis with osteoporotic pain syndromes, fragility fractures and osteonecrosis accounts for significant morbidity and impacts negatively on the quality of life. It is generally agreed that there is a need to increase awareness for inflammatory bowel disease-associated osteoporosis. However, the best ways in which to identify at-risk patients, the epidemiology of fractures and an evidence-based rational prevention strategy remain to be established. The overall prevalence of IBD-associated osteoporosis is 15%, with higher rates seen in older and underweight subjects. The incidence of fractures is about 1 per 100 patient years, with fracture rates dramatically increasing with age. While old age is a significant risk factor, disease type (Crohn's disease or ulcerative colitis) is not related to osteoporosis risk. Corticosteroid use is a major variable influencing IBD-associated bone loss; however, it is difficult to separate the effects of corticosteroids from those of disease activity. The recommendations in inflammatory bowel disease are similar to those for postmenopausal osteoporosis, with emphasis on lifestyle modification, vitamin D (400-800 IE daily) and calcium (1000-1500 mg daily) supplementation and hormone replacement therapy (oestrogens/selective oestrogen receptor modulators in women, testosterone in hypogonadal men). Bisphosphonates have been approved for patients with osteoporosis (T-score < 2.5), osteoporotic fragility fractures and patients receiving continuous steroid medication. Data on the recently Food and Drug Administration-approved osteoanabolic substance parathyroid hormone and on osteoprotegerin are promising in terms of both steroid-induced and inflammation-mediated osteoporosis, the key elements of inflammatory bowel disease-associated bone disease.},

   abstract = {Inflammatory bowel diseases (IBD), commonly referred to as Crohn's disease and ulcerative colitis are chronic aggressive disorders which share many similarities concerning pathomechanism and clinical course, but have very distinct features. Both entities are mainly located in areas with high bacterial concentrations, such as the terminal ileum and cecum in Crohn's disease and the rectum in ulcerative colitis. In recent years, overwhelming evidence accumulated, supporting the hypothesis that IBD are characterized by a genetically determined, overly aggressive immune response towards ubiquitous luminal antigens, especially commensal bacteria and their products. Trials in both human IBD and experimental colitis have demonstrated that broad-spectrum antibiotics may influence the course of ulcerative colitis and Crohn's disease and antibiotics with narrow activity against the anaerobic fraction of the flora can prevent relapse in Crohn's disease after surgically induced remission. Since relevant antibiotic strategies can be associated with some side effects, the ongoing research recently focused on alternative methods to modify the intestinal flora in patients with IBD. Clinical observations including few controlled trials, basic research, and animal studies have suggested a potential role for probiotic bacteria within the treatment regimens for IBD. However, the mode of action of these organisms is still largely unclear and in vitro studies are inconclusive. This review summarizes recent in vitro and in vivo data regarding the role of the intestinal microflora in the pathogenesis of chronic intestinal inflammation and possible therapeutic mechanisms of probiotic bacteria relevant to IBD. Furthermore, we will review clinical trials examining the efficacy of antibiotic and probiotic treatment strategies in IBD.},

This study aims to evaluate murine models of acute and chronic intestinal inflammation to study the antiinflammatory effect of EcN in vivo. Acute colitis was induced in mice with 2% dextran-sodium sulfate (DSS) in drinking water. EcN was administered from day -2 to day +7. Chronic colitis was induced by transfer of CD4(+) CD62L(+) T lymphocytes from BALB/c mice in SCID mice. EcN was administered three times/week from week 1 to week 8 after cell transfer. Mesenteric lymph node (MLN) cytokine secretion (of gamma interferon [IFN-gamma], interleukin 5 [IL-5], IL-6, and IL-10) was measured by enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay. Histologic sections of the colon were analyzed by using a score system ranging from 0 to 4. Intestinal contents and homogenized MLN were cultured, and the number of E. coli-like colonies was determined. EcN was identified by repetitive extragenic palindromic (REP) PCR. EcN administration to DSS-treated mice reduced the secretion of proinflammatory cytokines (IFN-gamma, 32,477 +/- 6,377 versus 9,734 +/- 1,717 [P = 0.004]; IL-6, 231 +/- 35 versus 121 +/- 17 [P = 0.02]) but had no effect on the mucosal inflammation. In the chronic experimental colitis of the transfer model, EcN ameliorated the intestinal inflammation (histology score, 2.7 +/- 0.2 versus 1.9 +/- 0.3 [P = 0.02]) and reduced the secretion of proinflammatory cytokines. Translocation of EcN and resident E. coli into MLN was observed in the chronic colitis model but not in healthy controls. Administration of EcN ameliorated acute and chronic experimental colitis by modifying proinflammatory cytokine secretion but had no influence on the acute DSS-induced colitis. In this model, preexisting colitis was necessary for translocation of EcN and resident E. coli into MLN.},

Alteration of the intestinal microflora by antibiotic or probiotic therapy may induce and maintain remission. The aim of this randomized, placebo-controlled trial was to determine the effect of oral Lactobacillus GG (L. GG) to induce or maintain medically induced remission. METHODS: Eleven patients with moderate to active Crohn's disease were enrolled in this trial to receive either L. GG (2 x 10(9) CFU/day) or placebo for six months. All patients were started on a tapering steroid regime and received antibiotics for the week before the probiotic/placebo medication was initiated. The primary end point was sustained remission, defined as freedom from relapse at the 6 months follow-up visit. Relapse was defined as an increase in CDAI of >100 points. RESULTS: 5/11 patients finished the study, with 2 patients in each group in sustained remission. The median time to relapse was 16 +/- 4 weeks in the L. GG group and 12 +/- 4.3 weeks in the placebo group (p = 0.5). CONCLUSION: In this study we could not demonstrate a benefit of L. GG in inducing or maintaining medically induced remission in CD.},

However, there are large gaps in the knowledge of the normal flora and of the optimal use of probiotic products. At present, there is no reliable in vitro predictor of in vivo efficacy of putative probiotics. Indeed, probiotic performance should be defined in the context of the disease indication for which it is intended. This will require rigorous prospective clinical trials. In addition, guidelines for routine clinical use of probiotics are confounded by insufficient data on optimum strain selection, dose, delivery vehicle and monitoring. Before the promise can be fulfilled, problems and potential pitfalls with probiotic therapy need resolution.},

   abstract = {Intestinal bacteria play a key role in inflammatory bowel disease. Probiotics attempt to modify disease by favourably altering bacterial composition, immune status, and inflammation. Until recently, probiotic therapy was considered 'folk' medicine, but there now is emerging interest on the part of the general public and scientific communities in the use of probiotics in human disease. This practical, evidence-based review examines probiotics as therapy for inflammatory bowel disease in humans. There are very few such published randomized clinical trials, but some data exist that possibly show an efficacy of probiotics as maintenance therapy in chronic relapsing pouchitis. Obstacles to providing probiotic therapy include selection of appropriate strains, poorly regulated probiotic quality standardization, processing and human biologic factors which impair probiotic viability, difficulty in maintaining new bacterial populations in the gut, and local product unavailability. Studies have focused on specific inflammatory bowel disease subgroups, limiting general applicability for the practitioner. Basic research highlights the importance of bacteria in these conditions, and the possibility that probiotics will modify physiological parameters. Well-designed, randomized clinical studies are still required to define the role of probiotics as therapeutic agents in inflammatory bowel disease.},

   abstract = {BACKGROUND: Balsalazide is well tolerated and effective in treating acute ulcerative colitis. VSL#3 is a probiotic cocktail proven to be effective in preventing flare-ups of chronic pouchitis. We compared the efficacy and safety of low-dose balsalazide (2.25 g/day) plus 3 g/day VLS#3 (group A) with medium-dose balsalazide alone (group B) and with mesalazine (group C) in the treatment of mild-to-moderate active ulcerative colitis. MATERIAL/METHODS: Ninety patients (30 per group) were randomly enrolled, with a treatment duration of 8 weeks. Efficacy was assessed by symptoms assessment, endoscopic appearance, and histological evaluation. RESULTS: Balsalazide/VSL#3 was significantly superior to balsalazide alone and to mesalazine in obtaining remission: 24 patients of group A were in remission [per-protocol: 85.71% (C.I.95%: 62-96), on intention-to-treat: 80% (C.I.95%: 59-91)], while 21 group B [per-protocol: 80.77% (C.I. 95%: 51-82), on intention-to-treat: 77% (C.I.95%: 43-81)] and 16 group C patients [per-protocol: 72.73% (C.I. 95%: 30-75), on intention-to-treat: 53.33% (C.I.95%: 42-62)] were in remission (p<0.02). Balsalazide with or without VSL#3 was better tolerated than mesalazine: two group C patients were withdrawn from the study because of severe side-effects; 1 group A (3.33%), 3 group B (10%) and 4 group C (13.33%) patients experienced slight side-effects. The balsalazide/VSL#3 combination was faster in obtaining remission than balsalazide alone or mesalazine (4, 7.5, and 13 days in groups A, B and C, respectively) and also better in improving all parameters evaluated. CONCLUSIONS: Balsalazide/VSL#3 may be a very good choice in the treatment of active mild-to-moderate active ulcerative colitis instead of balsalazide alone or mesalazine.},

   abstract = {Ulcerative colitis is a chronic inflammatory disease of the colon of unknown cause. Its course is one of relapse and remission and requires therapy for both the induction and maintenance of remission. Progress in the fields of genetics and immunology affords important advances in our understanding of the inflammatory process. Traditional therapy for ulcerative colitis with nonspecific anti-inflammatories remains our gold standard. This review examines the most recent compounds in development for the treatment of ulcerative colitis, including data from early clinical trials and the potential clinical impact of future entities.},

   abstract = {The hypothesis was studied that intestinal microbial metabolites play a role in the pathogenesis of inflammatory bowel disease. For that purpose, an in vitro model of the colon was inoculated with fresh feces of six healthy individuals and eight inflammatory bowel disease patients. Samples were taken from the model over time to analyze metabolites from both saccharolytic and proteolytic fermentation. Microbiotas from inflammatory bowel disease patients produced significantly more short-chain fatty acids and ammonia than microbiotas from healthy individuals. Furthermore, the branched-chain fatty acid production was 25% higher after inoculation with microbiotas from patients than after inoculation with microbiotas from healthy individuals. Phenolic compounds were produced by all microbiotas, with large interindividual variation. The production of (potentially toxic) metabolites may play a role in the onset or chronicity of inflammatory bowel disease, because they were produced in higher amounts by microbiotas from these patients than by microbiotas from healthy individuals.},
