Monoclonal antibodies and a sensitive indirect peroxidase method were used. In the lamina propria and epithelium of a normal jejunum and rectum, as well as in the rectal and colonic mucosae of patients with ulcerative colitis only low numbers of gamma/delta positive cells were seen. In the lamina propria, in the surface epithelium, as well as, in the epithelium of the Lieberkuhn crypts the number of gamma/delta positive cells were significantly higher than in the controls before treatment, during gluten free diet and after the gluten challenge. In the epithelium the absolute numbers of these cells remained constant during gluten elimination and provocation. The constantly elevated population of gamma/delta positive T-cells in coeliac disease might show their primary pathogenetic role in this disorder. The detection of elevated number of intraepithelial gamma/delta T-cells may have significance in the diagnosis of coeliac disease.},

Patients with active ulcerative colitis have increased levels of leukotriene B4 in their rectal mucosa, and these levels tend to correlate with severity of the disease. In this study, we evaluated the efficacy of ingestion of fish oil n-3-omega-fatty acids, inhibitors of leukotriene synthesis, in the treatment of ulcerative colitis. Eleven patients with ulcerative colitis of mild to moderate severity were studied in a 8-month, double-blind, placebo-controlled, crossover trial of dietary supplementation with fish oil, which provided about 4.2 g of omega-3- fatty acids per day. A disease activity index based on patient symptoms and sigmoidoscopic appearance was used to assess efficacy. Mucosal leukotriene B4 production was measured by radioimmunoassay. Mean disease activity index declined 56% for patients receiving fish oil and 4% for patients on placebo (p less than 0.05). There were no statistically significant differences in histopathologic scores or colonic mucosal leukotriene B4 levels. All patients tolerated fish oil ingestion and showed no alteration in routine blood studies. No patient worsened; anti-inflammatory drugs could be reduced or eliminated in eight patients (72%) while receiving fish oil. We conclude that fish oil dietary supplementation results in clinical improvement of active mild to moderate ulcerative colitis but is not associated with significant reduction in mucosal leukotriene B4 production, compared with placebo therapy. Further studies are needed to elucidate the mechanism of action and optimal dose and duration of fish oil supplementation in ulcerative colitis.},

   abstract = {This article reviews the pathophysiologic concept that superoxide and hydrogen peroxide, generated by activated leukocytes, together with low-molecular-weight chelate iron derived from fecal sources and from denatured hemoglobin, amplify the inflammatory response and subsequent mucosal damage in patients with active episodes of ulcerative colitis. The putative pathogenic mechanisms reviewed are as follows: (1) Dietary iron is concentrated in fecal material owing to normally limited iron absorption. (2) Mucosal bleeding, characteristic of ulcerative colitis, as well as supplemental oral iron therapy for chronic anemia, further conspire to maintain or elevate mucosal iron concentration in colitis. (3) Fenton chemistry, driven especially by leukocyte-generated superoxide and hydrogen peroxide, leads to formation of hydroxyl radicals. (4) The resultant oxidative stress leads to the extension and propagation of crypt abscesses, either through direct membrane disruption by lipid peroxidation or through generation of secondary toxic oxidants such as chloramines. (5) Chemotactic products of lipid peroxidation, including 4-hydroxynonenal, provide positive feedback to accelerate this inflammatory/oxidative process, leading to acute exacerbations of the disease. (6) Other oxidized products, such as oxidized tryptophan metabolites, created by free radical mechanisms in or near the mucosa, may act as carcinogens or tumor promotors that contribute to the exceedingly high incidence of colon carcinoma in patients suffering from chronic ulcerative colitis. In this way, self-sustaining cycles of oxidant formation may amplify flare-ups of inflammation and mucosal injury in ulcerative colitis. This concept, if proved correct by subsequent research, would provide a rationale for several novel clinical approaches to the management of ulcerative colitis, including use of SOD mimetics, iron chelators, and chain-breaking antioxidants.},

Some studies have suggested significant anal sphincter damage after mucosal proctectomy. Our aim was to assess prospectively late sphincter function after IPAA. In 250 patients, anorectal pressures were assessed with a pneumohydraulic perfused catheter manometry system. Each patient underwent colectomy, mucosal proctectomy, ileoanal anastomosis of a 15 cm ileal J-pouch, and loop ileostomy. Eight weeks after IPAA, anal manometry was repeated, and the ileostomy was closed. Manometry was repeated at yearly intervals. A decline in resting tone of the anal sphincter occurred early after IPAA with a gradual recovery toward control. External sphincter squeeze after pressures were not affected by IPAA and steadily increased to 8 years after operation. During this time, a progressive increase in J-pouch capacity was noted, and 24-hour stool frequency declined from 7.9 +/- 0.3 stools to 6.5 +/- 0.3 stools (p less than 0.05). We conclude that mucosal proctectomy results in internal anal sphincter trauma but is associated with long-term sphincter recovery, coupled with a significant improvement in external sphincter capacity, ileal pouch volume, and stool frequency.},

   abstract = {Sodium and potassium in the ileostomy output and urine were determined in 28 patients with ulcerative colitis on a free diet and in eight patients on a defined constant diet, before and after conversion from a conventional ileostomy (CI) to a continent reservoir ileostomy (RI). Feces and urine were collected both in the hospital and at home. Patients with CI on free diet had a median intestinal loss of 62 mmol sodium and those with RI 74 mmol/24 h collected in the hospital (p < 0.05). The figures for at home was 79 and 81 mmol/24 respectively, and were larger than in the hospital (p < 0.01). Sodium loss in the urine (U-Na) and the intake of sodium did not change significantly after conversion. Patients with a low U-Na before conversion also had a low U-Na after, in a few almost nil, implying a need for increased intake of sodium. Patients with a CI and low urinary output of sodium should be carefully studied with respect to their sodium balance before accepting them for conversion to RI. The ileostomy output of potassium increased after conversion (4.3 vs. 6.8 mmol/24 h; p < 0.01) in the hospital (5.3 vs 7.1 mmol/24 h; p < 0.01) at home. Patients on a defined constant diet before and after conversion did not show any significant differences in absorption of sodium, potassium, magnesium or calcium after conversion, but did show a reduced dry weight of the ileostomy output, indicating an increased degradation of intestinal contents in RI patients.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS)},

Two groups were comparable for age, sex, religion, place of birth, number of years spent in Britain and vegetarian status. There were no significant differences in actual oils used between healthy controls and patients with ulcerative colitis or Crohn's disease (chi 2 = 0.142 and 1.803 respectively, p greater than 0.50). However patients with Crohn's disease were found to recycle their cooking oil significantly more often than age and sex-matched colitics (p less than 0.05) and particularly age and sex-matched controls (p less than 0.01). A similar study needs to be conducted in India where the incidence of inflammatory bowel disease is low. If this difference is confirmed a programme of health education in cooking habits could lower the incidence of Crohn's disease.},

   abstract = {Inflammatory bowel disease encompasses both ulcerative colitis and Crohn's disease, two conditions so alike clinically that they are frequently indistinguishable from one another. Inflammatory bowel disease occurs at a rate of approximately five per 100,000 people. It tends to cluster in families and is seen four to five times more often in Jewish Caucasians than in other Caucasians. The etiology is unknown. Increasing attention is being paid to autoimmune factors, genetic factors and food allergies, and the notion that inflammatory bowel disease has its roots in a psychological disorder continues to pale for want of empirically sound evidence. Disease pattern is one of remission and exacerbation. The aim of therapy is to maintain an optimal lifestyle in remission through an individually tailored protocol of medications. Sulfasalazine remains the medication of choice; corticosteroids have short-term utility in exacerbation; and immunosuppressants, though controversial, are thought to have some steroid-sparing benefits during acute flare-ups. Indications for surgery vary, depending on whether or not a clear differential diagnosis has been made between ulcerative colitis and Crohn's disease. There is no cure for inflammatory bowel disease except for total colectomy in clearly diagnosed ulcerative colitis. Current research endeavors seek a cause or causes for inflammatory bowel disease, but the literature does not solidly support any one possibility above other rival etiologies.},

The aim of the present study was to determine if experimental folate deficiency increases the likelihood of developing neoplasia in rats treated with the carcinogen dimethylhydrazine. Weanling male Sprague-Dawley rats were fed with an amino acid-defined diet containing either 8 or 0 mg/kg folic acid. After 5 weeks of defined diet, weekly s.c. injections of dimethylhydrazine (20 mg/kg) were administered to both groups. Serum, whole blood, liver, and colonic folate concentrations at the time of sacrifice were significantly lower in folate-depleted animals (P less than 0.001). There were significant differences in the incidence of colonic neoplasia between the two groups after 20 weeks of dimethylhydrazine exposure: folate-deficient rats had a greater incidence of dysplasia (6 of 7 versus 2 of 7 animals; P less than 0.05) and carcinoma (6 of 7 versus 1 of 7 animals; P less than 0.01). Furthermore, a significantly greater proportion of folate-replete rats than folate-deficient rats were free of neoplastic lesions (5 of 7 versus 0 of 7 animals; P less than 0.05). These results suggest that, in this animal model, folate deficiency increases the risk of malignancy when there is an underlying predisposition to colorectal cancer.},

In addition, the effects of stimulation with calcium ionophore, inhibition by a drug which specifically prevents activation of 5-lipoxygenase, and modification of the fatty acid composition of membrane phospholipids on leukotriene B4 synthesis were assessed. Incubation with calcium ionophore (A23187) resulted in a dose and time dependent increase in leukotriene B4 synthesis. After cell phospholipids had been enriched with oleic acid, linoleic acid, and arachidonic acid, leukotriene B4 synthesis was found to be increased 3.2-fold, 5.5-fold, and 6.1-fold above control. Treatment with MK-886 inhibited leukotriene B4 synthesis by 79% to 94% in the various groups. Variations in the polyunsaturated fatty acid content of intestinal epithelial cells could be important in the modulation of cellular responses. We have shown for the first time in this human intestinal epithelial cell its ability to synthesise leukotriene B4. In addition, leukotriene B4 synthesis can be modulated by the fatty acid composition of membrane phospholipids, which can be altered by dietary fatty acids. The synthesis of chemotatic factors, such as leukotriene B4, by the mucosal epithelium may contribute to the recruitment of granulocytes into the colonic mucosa and across the epithelium, giving rise to the crypt abscesses which characterise ulcerative colitis.},

Supplementation with wheat fibre, but not with ispaghula, decreased the faecal concentration of total BA by 43% (p < 0.05), unconjugated BA by 41% (p < 0.01), and taurine conjugated BA by 58% (p < 0.05). Addition of wheat fibre decreased the concentration of chenodeoxycholic acid by 66% (p < 0.05) and isomers of cholic acid by 51% (p < 0.05) in faeces. The mean faecal water concentration of taurine-conjugated BA decreased by 55% when wheat fibre was added (p < 0.05) and the concentration of isomers of deoxycholic acid increased by 39% when ispaghula was supplemented (p < 0.05). The ratio isomeric deoxycholic acid to deoxycholic acid in faecal water increased significantly when wheat fibre was added (p < 0.05). The percentage distribution of secondary and ketonic BA was not influenced by the dietary fibre supplementation. The concentration of BA in faeces and faecal water decreased only by wheat fibre, suggesting that it is superior in obtaining an affect on faecal BA concentration.},

All patients had been in remission for 0.5 to 2 years and orally treated with sulfasalazine, but none were taking steroids. The type of fibre intake was randomized and the periods separated by a 6-month wash-out period with placebo. The average intake of both wheat fibre and ispaghula was 16 g per day. Faecal samples were collected before and after each fibre period and analysed by quantitative and qualitative microbiological techniques. No significant changes in bacterial species were found in the faecal microflora. The results indicate that effects of fibre on human metabolism in patients with ulcerative colitis treated with sulfasalazine are not mediated by changes in the intestinal microflora.},

In patients with ulcerative colitis in clinical remission, serum levels of bile acids were also studied after long-term intake (6 months) of dietary fibers (wheat fiber and ispaghula, respectively) in a double-blind randomized cross-over study. Blood samples were taken in the morning after an overnight fasting and for 4 h postprandially after a standardized test meal. Determinations of bile acids were made by radioimmunoassays. Patients with total colitis in the active phase had significantly higher serum levels of cholic and chenodeoxycholic acids 4 h postprandially compared with control children. After long-term intake of ispaghula, significantly higher (although not different from controls) serum levels of cholic acid were found 2 and 3 h postprandially, whereas wheat fibers did not affect serum bile acid concentrations. These results may suggest an increased absorption of unconjugated bile acids in the diseased colon and a minimal influence of dietary fibers on serum bile acid concentrations.},

Eighty patients answered a questionnaire, completed Cattell's anxiety scale, and recorded bowel function for one month. Both colitis and polyposis patients defecated five times daily, had 1.6 episodes of nocturnal motions weekly, and soiled twice weekly. However, colitis patients were more satisfied with their bowel function and surgical outcome than were polyposis patients. This difference had a close relationship to the personality factors of ego strength and frustration. All patients with either disease who defecated less than three times daily, had no nocturnal motions, and had no soiling showed normal ego strength and frustration and were completely satisfied with their bowel status and operation. In contrast, patients defecating more than seven times daily or more than once per week nocturnally and soiling more than four times weekly had high frustration and were dissatisfied. Thus, satisfaction with surgery correlated not only with the objective outcome but also with personality and lifestyle.},

   abstract = {Malnutrition is a frequent occurrence in patients with acute inflammatory bowel disease. Total nutritional support provided either parentally (TPN) or enterally (TEN) has been advocated not only as an adjunct for improving nutrition but also as primary therapy. For patients with acute Crohn's disease, short-term rates of remission after TEN are equivalent to TPN. Coupled with certain advantages when compared with TPN, including simpler administration, fewer side effects, and preservation of the intestinal mucosal barrier, TEN may therefore be the preferred route for nutrient delivery. Controlled trials indicate equivalent or superior efficacy when enteral polymeric diets are compared with elemental diets for inducing remission in acute Crohn's disease. Moreover, when provided as an elemental diet, TEN is as effective as corticosteroids for achieving remission in acute Crohn's disease, but corticosteroids appear to be more effective than polymeric diets. Although the provision of nutritional support rather than bowel rest is the major factor contributing to symptomatic improvement, the optimal nutrient composition and the precise mechanisms whereby nutritional support achieves clinical remission remain to be clarified. In contrast to Crohn's disease, nutritional support is not effective for achieving remission in patients with ulcerative colitis. Thus, enteral nutritional support is an effective therapy for the short-term management of acute Crohn's disease. Whether long-term remission is equivalent to treatment with drugs or surgery requires prospective evaluation. Future avenues of investigation also include defining the optimal nutrient composition and the underlying mechanisms that achieve maximal nutritional repletion, promote mucosal cell renewal, and potentially directly retard production of inflammatory mediators.},

   abstract = {Eicosanoids are major mediators of defensive and inflammatory processes of the gut mucosa. The activity of the eicosanoid system is modulated by neural and hormonal pathways, but local factors acting within the gastrointestinal lumen may also be involved. We have studied the influence of dietary fatty acids on eicosanoid synthesis by the gastrointestinal mucosa. Since omega-3 fatty acids compete with the omega-6 as precursors of eicosanoid synthesis, we compared the effects of dietary supplementation with either sunflower or cod liver oil as sources of omega-6 or omega-3 fatty acids, respectively. Rats fed with the cod-liver-oil-supplemented diet for four weeks showed high omega-3 and low omega-6 plasma fatty acid levels compared to rats fed with the sunflower oil diet. Synthesis of arachidonic-acid-derived eicosanoids (6-keto-PGF1 alpha, PGE2, TXB2, LTB4, and LTC4) by gastric and intestinal mucosa was found to be lower in the cod liver group as compared to the sunflower group. However, significant generation of eicosapentaenoic-acid-derived eicosanoids (PGE3 and LTC5) was observed only in the cod liver group. We used the (trinitrobenzenesulphonic acid) TNBS model of inflammatory colitis to test the effect of the dietary fat on the development of inflammatory lesions of the bowel. A single intracolonic instillation of the hapten TNBS dissolved in 10% ethanol induces chronic granulomatous lesions of the colonic mucosa that persist for up to 8 weeks. Luminal release of eicosanoid mediators, as measured by intracolonic dialysis, was lower in the cod liver group than in the sunflower group, particularly during the chronic stage of the disease.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS)},

   abstract = {The notion that requirements for folic acid may be higher in some tissues than others, resulting in localized deficiencies in spite of blood levels in the normal range was first suggested by the observation of megaloblastic changes in the cervical epithelium that responded to folate supplementation. Theoretically, such deficiencies may arise from elevated folate turnover in response to rapid tissue proliferation or repair; inactivation or alteration of its function by external agents such as tobacco, alcohol, or drugs; or altered metabolism or tissue uptake caused by an inborn error. Marginal dietary intake could aggravate these effects on cells at risk. Evidence for the possible existence of localized folate deficiencies in the aerodigestive tract includes lower circulating folate levels in smokers as compared with nonsmokers; yet lower circulating levels in smokers with bronchial metaplasia; lower folate levels in scrapings of the buccal mucosa of smokers than non-smokers; apparent improvement in bronchial atypical metaplasia in smokers supplemented with folic acid; lower erythrocyte folate levels and higher prevalence of cellular features compatible with folate deficiency in geographic areas and individuals in South Africa at high risk for esophageal cancer; and a trend toward a lower prevalence of colonic dysplasia in ulcerative colitis patients who use folic acid supplements. These observations, as well as animal and in vitro studies, also suggest that folate deficiency may be co-carcinogenic. Further research in this area will be aided by the development of animal models of localized folate deficiency and of methodologies capable of measuring folate levels in minute quantities of tissues and exfoliated cells.},

   abstract = {The incorporation of the fatty acids in fish and olive oil into the colonic mucosa of patients with inflammatory bowel disease was examined during 12 weeks' dietary supplementation with the oils, and the influence on colonic mucosal prostaglandin and thromboxane generation was measured. With a dietary supplement of 18 g fish oil daily, concentrations of the major polyunsaturated fatty acids in fish oil, eicosapentaenoic acid and docosahexaenoic acid, were significantly raised in mucosal lipids. The first time these were measured, after three weeks' supplementation, the mean increases in eicosapentaenoic and docosahexaenoic acid were seven fold and 1.5 fold respectively, and these increases were maintained during the 12 week study. Arachidonic acid values fell throughout the study and this reduction was significant at 12 weeks. Mucosal prostaglandin E2 (PGE2), thromboxane B2, and 6-keto prostaglandin F1 alpha synthesis were suppressed, and this reached significance (p less than 0.05) at three and 12 weeks for PGE2 and at 12 weeks for thromboxane B2. The predominant fatty acid in olive oil is oleic acid. Supplementation with 18 g/day resulted in a significant increase in oleic acid in colonic mucosa at 12 weeks (p less than 0.05) and a fall in stearic acid and docosahexaenoic acid; there was no significant change in eicosanoid synthesis. It is concluded that colonic lipids and prostaglandin and thromboxane synthesis can be readily altered by dietary supplementation with fish oil. The extent of incorporation of the fatty acids present in oils is dependent upon the individual fatty acid.},

A clearer understanding of dietary and nutritional needs, including hyperalimentation and electrolyte and fluid balance, aids treatment. Antidiarrheal and antispasmodic preparations and sedatives are prescribed for symptom relief. The bowel inflammation is controlled with sulfasalazine or the newer 5-amino salicylic acid (5-ASA) compounds, antibacterial drugs for complications of Crohn's disease and IBD, adrenocortical steroids, and the immunosuppressive compounds 6-mercaptopurine (6-MP), azathioprine, and cyclosporine, as determined in each patient. The surgical procedures available for treatment of ulcerative colitis include total proctocolectomy and ileostomy or ileoanal anastomosis.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 400 WORDS)},

Antidiarrheal and antispasmodal preparation and sedatives are prescribed for symptom relief. The bowel inflammation is controlled with sulfasalazine or the newer 5-amino-salicylic acid (5-ASA) compounds, antibacterial drugs for complications of Crohn's disease and IBD, adrenocortical steroids, and the immunosuppressive compounds 6-mercaptopurine (6MP), azathioprine, and cyclosporine, as determined in each patient. The surgical procedures available for treatment of ulcerative colitis include total proctocolectomy and ileostomy or ileoanal anastomosis.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 400 WORDS)},

   abstract = {Recent work has shown that patients undergoing proctocolectomy and ileal pouch-anal anastomosis experience a better quality of life than those undergoing proctocolectomy and Brooke ileostomy. To assess whether the improvement with the pouch is due to the absence of a stoma or the preservation of fecal continence, functional and performance activities were assessed in 406 patients with Brooke ileostomies (stoma present, incontinent), 313 with Kock pouches (stoma present, continent), and 298 with ileal pouch-anal anastomoses (stoma absent, continent). All patients underwent proctocolectomy for ulcerative colitis or familial adenomatous polyposis. After adjusting for age, sex, diagnosis, attitude towards the operation, dietary satisfaction, and ability to work, the likelihood of an impact on performance was estimated for the three types of operation using logistic regression analysis. Patients with ileal pouch-anal anastomoses had fewer restrictions in sports and sexual activities than those with Kock pouches (P less than 0.05), whereas those with Kock pouches in turn had fewer restrictions in these activities but more restrictions in travel than those with Brooke ileostomies (P less than 0.05). In contrast, performance in the categories of social life, recreation, work, and family was similar between groups. It is concluded that both the presence of a stoma and fecal incontinence impair the quality of life after proctocolectomy. Ileal pouch-anal anastomosis, which avoids both stoma and incontinence, offers the best quality of life between the three operations studied.},

Deviation of gut contents away from the inflamed area, bowel rest, or the use of liquid diets appears to benefit Crohn's disease. The relative effects of complete bowel rest, or an elemental, hydrolysed, or polymeric liquid diet have not yet been established. Measures to alter the lumenal bacterial flora, including antibiotics, require further study. The use of corticosteroid drugs can be improved by the use of poorly absorbed or rapidly metabolized compounds. Amino-salicylates are effective in ulcerative colitis but require further study in Crohn's disease. Immunosuppressive drugs are valuable not only for a steroid sparing effect but also for control of chronic inflammation. New treatments designed to reduce inflammation are promising but will need to have high potency and an effect at the earliest stages of inflammation before a large number of different inflammatory mediators are released.},

   abstract = {To assess whether dietary antigens play a role in inflammatory bowel disease, 26 monozygotic twin pairs with inflammatory bowel disease and 52 healthy controls were investigated for serum antibodies (IgA, IgG, IgM) against ovalbumin, betalactoglobulin, gliadin, whole yeast (Saccharomyces cerevisiae) and yeast cell wall mannan. The twins were made up of five pairs concordant and nine pairs discordant for Crohn's disease, and two pairs concordant and 10 pairs discordant for ulcerative colitis. Two patients with Crohn's disease had a slight increase in disease activity, the others were in clinical remission. Two striking observations were made: first, individuals with ulcerative colitis were indistinguishable from healthy twins, and controls except for the response to gliadin. Both healthy and diseased twins had higher IgA levels to gliadin than controls. Second, twins who had developed Crohn's disease displayed higher antibody titres towards yeast cell wall mannan in particular, but also to whole yeast (Saccharomyces cerevisiae) of all antibody types (IgA, IgG, and IgM). In contrast, the response to gliadin, ovalbumin, and betalactoglobulin did not differ from healthy twins and was even lower than in the controls. The results argue against an increased systemic antigen presentation caused by an impaired mucosal barrier in the inflammatory bowel disease. Rather, they suggest that yeast cell wall material--that is, mannan, or some antigen rich in mannose and cross reacting with mannan, may play an aetiological role in Crohn's disease, but not in ulcerative colitis. The increases in IgA and IgM, as well as IgG suggest that local and systemic immune systems are selectively activated by antigen(s) present in the cell wall of baker's yeast.},

   abstract = {Intestinal inflammation seems invariably to be associated with increased epithelial proliferation. In the small bowel the pathological consequences of this area an increase in the crypt proliferative compartment and a decrease in the absorptive villus compartment, which can lead to malabsorption. In the colon, it is more difficult to examine changes in cell proliferation, but using Ki67, epithelial proliferation has been shown to be increased in ulcerative colitis and parasitic infection. The teleological advantage of increasing epithelial proliferation during intestinal inflammation is presumably in an effort to get rid of parasitized or infected epithelial cells, or to rapidly replace cells which have been lost. Rejection of helminth parasites from rodent small bowel is associated with partial villous atrophy and crypt hypertrophy, which is probably part of the host response making the mucosa inhospitable to the parasites. The short-term nutritional disadvantage of malabsorption is outweighed by the long-term advantage of being parasite-free. However, when the intestinal inflammation is elicited by a dietary constituent, the consequences are only pathological. At the moment there is no information as to the mechanisms by which inflammatory cells alter mucosal morphology and epithelial renewal. The restructuring of mucosal morphology in the flat-mucosa involves considerable adaptation of the connective tissue elements of the lamina propria. Whether this occurs in response to changes in epithelial renewal is not known. Finally, it is clear that activated T cells in the lamina propria can produce a flat-mucosa. In diseases such as Trichuris dysentery and ulcerative colitis there is no or very little T cell activation, even though epithelial proliferation is increased. Increased epithelial proliferation therefore may occur in response to different inflammatory stimuli.},

A large cohort study identified animal fat as the most important dietary risk factor, and a meta-analysis of fiber supported the role particularly of vegetable fiber in protection. An important population-based study in Scandinavia identified age at onset of ulcerative colitis as a factor independent of length of follow-up; risk at 35 years after onset was 40% for those with early-stage onset. An update at the St. Mark's Hospital, London, surveillance experience offers measured support for endoscopic screening for dysplasia and curable cancer. A unique paper from Japan defines a relative risk of cancer after polypectomy of 2.3. A case-control study of occult blood screening showed that the sensitivity of guaiac testing for fecal occult blood (Hemoccult, Smith Kline Diagnostics, CA) for asymptomatic colorectal cancer is just under 50%. Cost-benefit modeling suggests that annual occult blood testing and 3- to 5-yearly flexible sigmoidoscopy are optimal.},

In recent years pathogenetic studies have focused on immune mechanisms, transmissible infectious agents, the potential role of the normal intestinal flora, dietary factors, enzymatic alterations and genetic features, in addition to vascular, neuromotor, allergic and psychologic factors. The prevalence of IBD is increased in first-degree relatives of patients and there is a high rate of disease concordance among monozygotic twins. Thus abnormal genes may encode for one or several immunoregulatory factors, while bacterial wall products seem to activate colonic inflammatory cells in a non-specific way, leading to increased production of cytokines, complement-derived peptides, eicosanoids, platelet activating factor, biogenic amines, kinins, chemotactic oligopeptides, and neuropeptides.

Colon cancer is also etiologically linked to cholesterol oxidation products. Higher than normal levels of cholestanetriol have been found in patients with colon cancer and also in those with precancerous disorders such as adenomatous polyps and ulcerative colitis. Higher than normal levels of cholesterol alpha-epoxide have been found in breast fluid aspirates of women with benign breast disease, with or without atypical hyperplasia of the epithelium, and this may be a factor in the increased incidence of breast cancer associated with hyperplasia. Similarly, the observed increased levels of cholesterol alpha and beta-epoxides in prostatic fluid of men with benign prostatic hypertrophy may be associated with subsequent development of prostate cancer. Cholesterol alpha-epoxide has been found to be mutagenic to fibroblasts in culture and to induce morphological transformation in hamster embryo cells and in mouse C3H cells. 25-Hydroxycholesterol and 20 alpha-hydroxycholesterol are potent suppressors of generation and proliferation of tumor-specific cytotoxic T lymphocytes. Although investigations into the role of cholesterol oxidation products in cancer are still in the early stages, evidence to date indicates a potentially significant role in the induction of some types of cancer.},

   abstract = {In this article, the evidence for the involvement of free radicals in some of the gastrointestinal disorders is reviewed. Oxygen radicals are partially reduced oxygen species that include superoxide, and hydroxyl radicals, and hypophthalous acids. Most cells possess numerous antioxidant enzymes and scavengers to protect themselves from these injurious agents; the rate of production of reactive oxygen metabolites may exceed the capacity of the antioxidant defenses thus resulting in tissue damage. The gastrointestinal tract is particularly well endowed with the enzymatic machinery necessary to form large amounts of oxygen radicals. Sources of radicals in the gastrointestinal tract include mucosal xanthine oxidase and NADPH oxidase found in the resident phagocytotic leukocytes (macrophages, neutrophils, eosinophils) of the lamina propria. Other sources of oxygen radicals in the gastrointestinal tract involve ischemia and reperfusion, drug ingestion, diet and radiation therapy. Recent studies have demonstrated the involvement of oxygen radicals following active episodes of small-intestinal ischemia, ulcerative colitis, pancreatitis and gastric ulcer. In contrast to cell antioxidants, control of tissue free radical levels is now pharmacologically feasible and perhaps justified for specific diseases. However, carefully designed and controlled clinical trials are needed.},

We obtained retrospective information about food intake 5 years previously by a postal questionnaire for 152 cases with Crohn's disease, 145 cases with ulcerative colitis, and 305 controls. The relative risk of Crohn's disease was increased for subjects who had a high (55 gm or more per day) intake of sucrose (relative risk = 2.6, 95% confidence interval = 1.4-5.0) and was decreased for subjects who had a high (15 gm or more per day) intake of fiber (relative risk = 0.5, 95% confidence interval = 0.3-0.9). The most striking finding was an increased relative risk of both Crohn's disease and ulcerative colitis associated with consumption of fast foods: the relative risk associated with consumption of fast foods at least two times a week was estimated at 3.4 (95% confidence interval = 1.3-9.3) for Crohn's disease and 3.9 (95% confidence interval = 1.4-10.6) for ulcerative colitis.

   abstract = {To assess the prevalence and risk factors for low bone mineral density in inflammatory bowel disease, we studied 61 consecutive patients, mean age 36 +/- 11 years. Twenty-seven had a Crohn's disease and 34 ulcerative colitis (including 13 with ileoanal anastomosis). Three patients, two women and one man (32, 70, and 45 years old, respectively) had vertebral crush fractures. Bone mineral density measured by dual energy x-ray absorptiometry at spine and femoral level was more than 2 SD below normal values in 23% of the patients, all of them having received steroid therapy. Eighteen patients (29%) had never received steroid therapy; their bone mineral density was not different than those who had. Univariate analysis showed a positive correlation between bone mineral density and body weight or oral calcium intakes, and a negative correlation with steroid daily dose. After ileoanal anastomosis, bone mineral density was not different from other groups and showed a positive correlation with time elapsed since coloproctectomy. We concluded that bone mineral density is low in patients with inflammatory bowel disease and exposes them to the risk of bone fracture. Bone mineral density after ileoanal anastomosis may increase with time after surgery.},

Serum magnesium levels were somewhat lower in the patients than in the volunteers. During the period of loading, cholesterol levels did not differ between the two groups at any time.

Extracts of serum and urine from the patients were assayed qualitatively by thin layer chromatography and the Aflatest method, and quantitatively by fluorimetry. There was evidence that some patients suffering from Crohn's Disease, together with some having coeliac disease and ulcerative colitis, did have varying amounts of aflatoxins in their serum and urine. The presence of aflatoxins may have been due to exposure to food containing these toxins or inability of the patient to excrete aflatoxins on account of some gastro-intestinal derangement. Only long-term investigation would establish the link between dietary history and the presence of aflatoxins in these patients.},

The average weight and the size of the new-born after manifestation did not differ from those before the beginning of the disease. Low birth weight were observed after the medication of prednisolone and a manifestation of the ulcerous colitis during the gravidity. The ability for conception is not restricted when this disease is existing. An infertility rate being above the norm of the total population is to be found in Crohn's disease. There is no correlation to the localisation of the changes. It can be consented to a pregnancy in lacking Crohn's disease or in a mild activity of this disease. When there are moderately severe and severe attacks before the realization of the wish of having a child a dietetic, medicamentous or surgical therapy is to be recommended. The treatment with low-dosed azulfidine and corticosteroid has no influence on the development of the child. A prophylactic therapy is indicated in ulcerative colitis, an interruption is rarely to be proved. In an acute attack during the pregnancy, when the accurate diagnosis is imperative the fully effective dose in therapy is to be aspired to.},

   abstract = {It is clear that the nutritional state of patients with inflammatory bowel disease is often impaired and can be improved by the provision of nutritional support. Improvement in nutritional status can be achieved as effectively with enteral as with parenteral nutrition. Nutritional support appears to have no primary therapeutic effect in patients with ulcerative colitis. With regard to nutritional support in Crohn's disease, parenteral nutrition should be restricted to use as supportive rather than primary therapy. Available information now seems to suggest that most of the benefits of parenteral nutrition in Crohn's disease are related to an improvement in nutritional state rather than as primary therapy, and its use should be restricted to the treatment of specific complications of Crohn's disease, such as intestinal obstruction related to stricture formation or short bowel syndrome following repeated resection. Although some doubt exists over the efficacy of oligopeptide-containing elemental and polymeric enteral diets, the present evidence indicates that chemically defined free amino acid-containing elemental diets have primary therapeutic efficacy in the management of acute exacerbations of Crohn's disease. As such, these diets are worthy of therapeutic trial in patients with severe Crohn's disease involving the distal colon and rectum, particularly in those patients who are malnourished and who prove to be resistant to treatment with a combination of topical corticosteroids and 5-aminosalicylic acid-containing compounds. Clinicians should be aware, though, that the beneficial effects are likely to be restricted to the short term, with high relapse rates by 1 year, this being particularly so in patients with distal Crohn's proctocolitis (Teahon et al, 1988). Volatile fatty acid enemas clearly have potential in the management of patients with severe steroid-resistant proctitis. Finally, one of the most important observations made in recent years is the one concerning the large losses of nitrogen that will occur in patients with inflammatory bowel disease treated with corticosteroids in the absence of adequate protein intake (O'Keefe et al, 1989). Hopefully the days of treating patients with severe inflammatory bowel disease with high dose corticosteroids and a peripheral dextrose or dextrose-saline drip have passed into history.},

   abstract = {Several sources of information suggest that man evolved on a diet with a ratio of omega 6 to omega 3 fatty acids of approximately 1 whereas today this ratio is approximately 10:1 to 20-25:1, indicating that Western diets are deficient in omega 3 fatty acids compared with the diet on which humans evolved and their genetic patterns were established. Omega-3 fatty acids increase bleeding time; decrease platelet aggregation, blood viscosity, and fibrinogen; and increase erythrocyte deformability, thus decreasing the tendency to thrombus formation. In no clinical trial, including coronary artery graft surgery, has there been any evidence of increased blood loss due to ingestion of omega 3 fatty acids. Many studies show that the effects of omega 3 fatty acids on serum lipids depend on the type of patient and whether the amount of saturated fatty acids in the diet is held constant. In patients with hyperlipidemia, omega 3 fatty acids decrease low-density-lipoprotein (LDL) cholesterol if the saturated fatty acid content is decreased, otherwise there is a slight increase, but at high doses (32 g) they lower LDL cholesterol; furthermore, they consistently lower serum triglycerides in normal subjects and in patients with hypertriglyceridemia whereas the effect on high-density lipoprotein (HDL) varies from no effect to slight increases. The discrepancies between animal and human studies most likely are due to differences between animal and human metabolism. In clinical trials eicosapentaenoic acid (EPA) and docosahexaenoic acid (DHA) in the form of fish oils along with antirheumatic drugs improve joint pain in patients with rheumatoid arthritis; have a beneficial effect in patients with ulcerative colitis; and in combination with drugs, improve the skin lesions, lower the hyperlipidemia from etretinates, and decrease the toxicity of cyclosporin in patients with psoriasis. In various animal models omega 3 fatty acids decrease the number and size of tumors and increase the time elapsed before appearance of tumors. Studies with nonhuman primates and human newborns indicate that DHA is essential for the normal functional development of the retina and brain, particularly in premature infants. Because omega 3 fatty acids are essential in growth and development throughout the life cycle, they should be included in the diets of all humans. Omega-3 and omega 6 fatty acids are not interconvertible in the human body and are important components of practically all cell membranes. Whereas cellular proteins are genetically determined, the polyunsaturated fatty acid (PUFA) composition of cell membranes is to a great extent dependent on the dietary intake.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 400 WORDS)},

   abstract = {OBJECTIVE: To determine the efficacy of fish oil supplementation in patients with active ulcerative colitis. DESIGN: Multicenter, randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled, crossover trail with 4-month treatment periods (fish oil and placebo) separated by a 1-month washout. SETTING: Four gastroenterology divisions. PATIENTS: Twenty-four patients with active ulcerative colitis entered the study. Five dropped out, and one was noncompliant. Eighteen patients completed the study. All patients had active disease as manifested by diarrhea and rectal inflammation. INTERVENTIONS: Treatment with prednisone and sulfasalazine was continued. Fish oil supplementation consisted of 18 Max-EPA (eicosapentaenoic acid) capsules daily (eicosapentaenoic acid, 3.24 g; and docosahexaenoic acid, 2.16 g). Placebo supplementation consisted of 18 identical capsules containing isocaloric amounts of vegetable oil. MEASUREMENTS: Patients were evaluated at study entry and after each diet period. Evaluations included a review of symptoms, flexible sigmoidoscopy, rectal biopsy, and rectal dialysis to measure prostaglandin E2 and leukotriene B4 levels. RESULTS: Fish oil supplementation resulted in a significant decrease in rectal dialysate levels of leukotriene B4 from 71.0 to 27.7 pg/mL (average change, -43.3 pg/mL; 95% CI, -83 to -3.6). Significant improvements were seen in acute histology index (average change, -8.5 units from a baseline of 10.5 units; CI, -12.9 to -4.2) and total histology index (average change, -8.5 units from a baseline of 14.80; CI, -13.2 to -3.8) as well as significant weight gain (average weight gain, 1.74 kg, CI, 0.94 to 2.54). No significant changes occurred in any variable during the placebo period. Seven patients received concurrent treatment with prednisone. During the fish oil supplementation period, the mean prednisone dose decreased from 12.9 mg/d to 6.1 mg/d and rose from 10.4 mg/d to 12.9 mg/d during the placebo diet period (P greater than 0.20). CONCLUSIONS: Four months of diet supplementation with fish oil in patients with inflammatory bowel disease resulted in reductions in rectal dialysate leukotriene B4 levels, improvements in histologic findings, and weight gain.},
