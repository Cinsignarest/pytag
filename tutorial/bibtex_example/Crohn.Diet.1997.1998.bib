The aetiology remains unknown, but is probably multifactorial. Both dietary, microbiological and immunological causes have been discussed. Clinical studies, including several Swedish studies, have also shown genetic factors to be crucially involved. Findings in sophisticated molecular biological studies suggest certain specific genes to be involved, and a current EU project in which Sweden is participating has been launched to map the mode of inheritance in detail.},

METHODS: Fasting and postprandial motor activity (1 h) was recorded in the gastric antrum and upper small intestine of 35 patients with inactive Crohn's disease and 18 controls, using conventional manometry. RESULTS: Motor disorders were observed in 26 of 35 patients. The number of phase-II contractions was reduced (1.3 +/- 0.7/min versus 1.8 +/- 0.6/min in controls; P < 0.02) (mean +/- standard deviation), whereas the incidence of propagated single (2.2 +/- 3.2/h versus 0.5 +/- 0.6/h; P < 0.03) and clustered contractions (3.8 +/- 7/h versus 1.1 +/- 1.4, P < 0.04) was markedly increased. Motor abnormalities were more frequent and severe in patients with Crohn's ileitis than in controls, and in patients with gastrointestinal symptoms than in asymptomatic patients. CONCLUSION: Most patients with inactive, uncomplicated Crohn's disease show marked gastrointestinal motor disorders, characterized either by reduced incidence of small-bowel contractions and increased incidence of single or clustered propagated contractions.},

   abstract = {BACKGROUND: Recent studies indicate that faecal pH is acidified in patients with inflammatory bowel disease compared with healthy controls. In healthy volunteers, stool pH, faecal flora, and bile acid concentration could be affected by means of elemental diets. AIMS: To assess the role of variations of faecal pH on leucocyte endothelial cell adhesion in indomethacin induced long lasting ileitis in rats. METHODS: Indomethacin (7.5 mg/kg subcutaneously) was injected twice, 24 hours apart. Rats were either fed with the identical diet before and 10 days after the induction of inflammation until the experiment, or the diet was changed at the time of induction. Ten postcapillary mesenteric venules (30 microns diameter) per animal were observed using intravital microscopy. Macroscopic visible intestinal ulceration was scored and faecal pH of different sections of the small bowel was determined. RESULTS: Small intestinal faecal pH was 8.5 in controls and 8.0 in indomethacin treated animals. Indomethacin significantly changed microcirculatory parameters: there was a 2.3-fold increase in leucocyte adherence, a 3.2-fold increase in leucocyte emigration, and a 20% reduction in shear rate. Application of various diets or diet combinations resulted in variations in faecal pH ranging from 7.8 to 8.8 which were inversely correlated with macroscopic ulcerations (r = -0.67). Leucocyte adherence was attenuated with increased pH and augmented with decreased pH (r = -0.55). Venular wall shear rate was positively correlated with faecal pH (r = 0.48) while leucocyte emigration showed no correlation. Leucocyte rolling velocity was not significantly altered. Normalisation of faecal pH by different alkalising drugs induced a significant decrease in leucocyte adherence in standard fed, indomethacin treated rats. CONCLUSIONS: Faecal pH is lowered in the indomethacin model of long lasting ileitis in rats, which is similar to human inflammatory bowel disease. Alkalisation of faecal pH due to different diets or alkalising drugs reduces indomethacin induced leucocyte endothelial cell adhesion and macroscopic intestinal damage. These results may provide a rationale for the therapeutic effect of enteral diets in Crohn's disease.},

   abstract = {BACKGROUND: Although suggested, it has never been convincingly documented that food sensitivity is of pathogenetic importance in chronic inflammatory bowel disease. However, many patients may relate their gastrointestinal symptoms to specific food items ingested and may restrict their diet accordingly. METHODS: A questionnaire was sent to all patients with chronic inflammatory bowel disease who attended the outpatient clinic, Medical Dept., Roskilde County Hospital in Koge, Denmark, in the year 1993. The patients were asked whether they had problems with any particular food item and, if so, to describe the symptoms experienced from it. A control group of 70 healthy persons were included. RESULTS: Among 189 patients, 132 (70%) responded. One hundred and thirty had completed the questionnaire, 52 males and 78 females aged 13-89 years (median, 43 years). Fifty-three (41%) had Crohn's disease (CD), 69 (53%) ulcerative colitis (UC), and 8 (6%) unclassified colitis. Forty-one patients (31 CD, 10 UC) were-operated on; 51 (19 CD, 32 UC) had disease activity. Sixty-five per cent of the patients and 14% of the controls reported being intolerant to one or more food items (P < 0.0001). The intolerance covered a wide range of food products. The commonest symptoms among patients were diarrhoea, abdominal pain, and meteorism and among controls, regurgitation. Food intolerance was equally common in CD (66%) and UC (64%) and was not related to previous operation, disease activity or disease location. CONCLUSION: Most patients with chronic inflammatory bowel intolerance disease feel intolerant to different food items and may restrict their diet accordingly. The frequency and pattern of food intolerance did not differ between patients with CD and UC. The food intolerance was probably unspecific rather than of pathogenetic importance.},

   abstract = {BACKGROUND/AIMS: In the Western world, primary sclerosing cholangitis (PSC) is a chronic cholestatic liver disease that is associated with inflammatory bowel disease (IBD), particularly chronic ulcerative colitis and, to a lesser degree, Crohn's disease. The goal of this study was to determine the prevalence of PSC in Turkish patients with IBD and chronic amebic colitis, a disease that is endemic in Turkey. METHODOLOGY: During a 10-year period, between 1986 and 1996, a total of 81 IBD (64 ulcerative colitis and 17 Crohn's disease) patients and 127 patients with chronic amebic colitis were seen and evaluated with radiologic, serologic, immunologic and pathologic tests. Whenever a clinical or biochemical finding suggested the presence of co-existent hepatic and/or biliary disease, the patient was further evaluated by liver biopsy, auto-antibodies and endoscopic retrograde cholangiopancreatography (ERCP) to determine whether they also had PSC or some other form of liver disease. As a disease control group, a total of 752 patients with clinical and/or laboratory evidence of pancreaticobiliary disease were also studied. In 86 of these 752 patients (10%), a primary disorder of the biliary tree was diagnosed by ultrasonography, computed tomography, peritoneoscopy, liver biopsy, ERCP and abdominal laparotomy. In addition, all 86 patients of the control group were evaluated endoscopically in order to determine whether they had any associated gastrointestinal condition of the upper or lower gastrointestinal tracts. After establishing final diagnoses of IBD, amebic colitis and PSC, these patients were evaluated with respect to their socio-economic status. A high protein diet (1.8 gram/kg/day) was administered to those patients with chronic amebic colitis and IBD during the active period of the disease. RESULTS: Of the 208 patients (81 with IBD and 127 with chronic amebic colitis), no cases of PSC were identified. Of the 86 patients in the control group with primary biliary tract disease, 45 had a biliary system malignancy, 14 had primary biliary cirrhosis (PBC), 16 had PSC, 3 had Caroli's disease, 6 had a common bile duct cyst, and 2 had gallbladder adenomatosis. All but 1 of the 16 patients with PSC were female. CONCLUSIONS: These data suggest that, in contrast to findings in Western Europe and the USA, in Turkey: 1) PSC is not regularly associated with idiopathic IBD; 2) most patients with PSC are female; 3) PSC accounts for only 18% of patients with a primary disorder of the biliary tree; 4) the incidence of small-duct primary sclerosing cholangitis is greater than that reported in the literature; and, 5) the incidence of IBD and PSC in Turkey is relatively lower than in other countries.},

   abstract = {Enteral diets, both elemental and, more recently, polymeric (whole protein), are used as primary therapy in Crohn's disease and can induce disease remission without the concomitant use of immunosuppressive drugs. Controlled trials comparing enteral nutrition with corticosteroid therapy have given mixed results but suggest, at least in children, that they are as effective as corticosteroids in inducing remission. There is no clear consensus as to which dietary therapy is best. Elemental diets do not seem to be superior to polymeric whole protein-based diets, although further work is necessary. The effect of enteral diets does not seem to be related to the site of intestinal inflammation. Enteral nutrition is particularly appropriate in children and adolescents with Crohn's disease, improving nutrition and promoting growth and pubertal development, and avoiding the systemic toxicity of corticosteroid therapy. Most centers will use it as a first line of treatment. Supplementary enteral nutrition after primary therapy and remission induction may be associated with the prolongation of remission and promotion of linear growth. Pathways by which enteral diets may affect mucosal inflammation are discussed. Enteral diets may inhibit intestinal immune responses by reducing the number of cytokine-producing cells. Enteral nutrition may also boost immunosuppressive pathways, which then endogenously suppress ongoing inflammation. Enteral diets may promote epithelial healing and reepithelialization of Crohn's ulcers and may also reduce the bacterial load in the small bowel.},

Patient involvement and education are necessary components of effective management. Mild disease requires only symptomatic relief and dietary manipulation. Mild to moderate disease can be managed with 5-aminosalicylic acid compounds, including olsalazine and mesalamine. Mesalamine enemas and suppositories are useful in treating proctosigmoiditis. Antibiotics such as metronidazole may be required in patients with Crohn's disease. Corticosteroids are beneficial in patients with more severe symptoms, but side effects limit their use, particularly for chronic therapy. Immunosuppressant therapy may be considered in patients with refractory disease that is not amenable to surgery. Inflammatory bowel disease in pregnant women can be managed with 5-aminosalicylic acid compounds and corticosteroids. Since longstanding inflammatory bowel disease (especially ulcerative colitis) is associated with an increased risk of colon cancer, periodic colonoscopy is warranted.},

METHODS: Forty-three patients with biopsy or radiology proven CD (23 men; age, 33.8 yr; range, 18-54 yr) in clinical remission (simplified Crohn's diseases activity index [SCDAI] < 3) and not receiving steroid therapy or nutritional support were enrolled in the study. Patients were separated into three subgroups according to disease localization: ileal (n = 16), ileo-colonic (n = 13), and colonic CD (n = 14). Sixty healthy volunteers (26 men; age, 32.0 yr; range, 18-60 yr), matched for age and height were used as control subjects. Body composition was assessed by both anthropometry and bioimpedance analysis and indirect calorimetry was performed to measure energy expenditure and substrate oxidation rates. RESULTS: CD patients showed a lower body weight than controls, both as a whole (61.5 kg; range, 41.5-74.0 vs 66.9 kg; range, 55.0-86.0 kg; p < 0.001) and separated by disease localization (ileal; p < 0.001; ileo-colonic; p < 0.001; and colonic; p < 0.05 vs controls). Fat-free mass (FFM) did not differ between the groups, whereas fat mass was significantly lower in CD patients than in controls (p < 0.001), with the lowest values in ileal and ileo-colonic patients. Basal metabolic rate by kg of FFM was higher in CD patients than in healthy individuals (p < 0.01). Nonprotein respiratory quotient was significantly lower in CD than in controls as a whole (0.79; range, 0.73-0.84 vs 0.83; range, 0.79-0.89; p < 0.001) or separated by disease localization (p < 0.001 each subgroup vs controls), with a consequent higher lipid oxidation rate. A lower dietary lipid intake was found in patients than in controls (p < 0.01). CONCLUSIONS: Regardless of disease localization, CD patients showed a lower fat mass and a higher utilization of lipids than control subjects. Patients with ileal and ileo-colonic disease showed the greater reduction in body weight, compared with control subjects, suggesting they were at a higher risk of malnutrition, probably as a consequence of the simultaneous occurrence of both malabsorption and decreased energy intake.},

Percutaneous endoscopic gastrostomy has been little used, even through it can facilitate the administration of an unpalatable elemental diet to an anorexic, undernourished patients. Its use is reported in 10 children with Crohn's disease. The gastrostomy was found to be more acceptable than a nasogastric tube and was associated with only minor complications. As a consequence of improved delivery of enteral nutrition, in the year after the insertion of the gastrostomy there was a reduction in prednisolone dosage in all patients, with six patients being able to stop prednisolone completely. The SD score for height also improved significantly. It is suggested that percutaneous endoscopic gastrostomy is both useful and safe in the management of Crohn's disease in children, particularly when compliance with an elemental diet is likely to be poor.},

The PBI was also administered to a control group (55 subjects) and 22 patients with Crohn's disease or celiac disease. The three groups were matched for age and socioeconomic status. The RAN and B/PAN patients gave significantly different interpretations of the parental bond (PB): for the former, it was adequate with both parents, for the latter it was inadequate, especially with the father. The fact that these differences exist at the onset of anorexia prior to any possible effect of therapy suggests that its structure is determined by different family dynamics.},

   abstract = {Disordered nutrition is common in Crohn's disease and is multifactorial. Regular and systematic monitoring of at least a minimum set of nutrition data is an essential component of care of children and adults with Crohn's disease. However, even in children, monitoring of growth and development may be deficient. Multiple macro- and micronutrient deficiencies are common in Crohn's disease, especially in those with extensive small bowel deficiencies or after multiple surgical resections. Body composition analysis may show differences from simple starvation, and metabolic effects of inflammation are increasingly being recognized. Nutritional support is part of the management of all patients with Crohn's disease, but nutritional intervention with defined formula liquid diet is an effective specific anti-inflammatory therapy. Although meta-analysis of published trials suggest that steroids are more effective than defined formula liquid diets, objective evidence from whole gut lavage fluid analysis and from faecal excretion of radiolabelled leukocytes shows unequivocal benefit of elemental diet based on measuring parameters of tissue damage. Enteral feeding with liquid diets should be considered in patients with incomplete small bowel obstruction, severe painful perianal disease, failure of corticosteroids in active Crohn's disease, borderline intestinal failure and in children with active Crohn's disease or with growth failure.},

Subjects participated in breath tests before and after six months of a high polyunsaturated to saturated (P/S) fat ratio diet to measure their response to [1-13C] 10:0 and [1-13C] 16:0 ingested with a test meal. Whole body absorption-oxidation of C10:0 was not affected by the diet treatment. Before diet treatment, whole body absorption-oxidation of C16:0 in Crohn's patients was 80% of that observed for control subjects. After consuming a high polyunsaturated to saturated fatty acid ratio diet, subjects increased oxidation of C16:0 by 85% compared to before the diet treatment period. It is concluded that (1) absorption of labelled C16:0 from a test meal is reduced in Crohn's patients, and (2) consumption of a high polyunsaturated to saturated fatty acid ratio diet improves the utilization of dietary C16:0 by Crohn's patients.},

To obtain a comprehensive picture of nutritional status in patients with long-standing CD that was clinically in remission, we assessed four measures of nutritional status in 32 patients (18 women and 14 men) and 32 matched healthy control subjects: 1) body composition, 2) dietary intake, 3) biochemical indexes of nutrition, and 4) and muscle strength (as a functional index). Mean daily intakes of fiber and phosphorus were significantly lower in CD patients than in control subjects. Serum concentrations of several nutrients (beta-carotene, vitamin C, vitamin E, selenium, and zinc) and activity of the enzyme glutathione peroxidase were also significantly lower in CD patients, as were antioxidant status and serum concentrations of magnesium and vitamin D. Percentage body fat and hamstring muscle strength were significantly lower in male CD patients than in control subjects, whereas muscle strength of the quadriceps was preserved. In conclusion, this study showed a variety of nutritional and functional deficiencies in patients with long-standing CD in remission, especially in male patients with a high lifetime prednisone dose. A comprehensive nutritional assessment seems superior to the assessment of a single dimension of nutritional status.},

   abstract = {OBJECTIVE: The aim of this study was to evaluate blood flow in the superior mesenteric artery (SMA) in patients with active and inactive Crohn's disease (CD) using Doppler sonography to dynamically assess the changes of resistance in both fasting and postprandial states. SUBJECTS AND METHODS: Doppler sonography of the SMA was performed on 15 patients (mean age, 38 +/- 4 years) with active CD and on 15 patients (mean age, 41 +/- 5 years) with inactive CD. Imaging was performed at both fasting and 15 min after an 1890-kJ meal. A preliminary examination of 10 healthy volunteers with no signs of intestinal disease (mean age, 28 +/- 2 years) was necessary to define the parameters of normality. Because we wanted to express the postprandial resistive change in the SMA, we introduced a parameter called resistive difference (RD), defined as the mathematic difference between the resistive index measured at fasting (highest value) and measured at 15 min after the meal (lowest value). RESULTS: By evaluating the relationship between the RD and extension of disease, we found a direct correlation between progressive extension of disease and reduction of the RD in patients with active CD (correlation coefficient, .98) whereas we found no such correlation in patients with inactive CD (correlation coefficient, .05). CONCLUSION: We believe that Doppler sonography of the SMA is a promising noninvasive method to detect inflammatory disease of the small bowel, to evaluate its extension, and to document resolution of disease after therapy.},

   abstract = {PURPOSE: To determine the dietary practices of the pediatric inflammatory bowel disease population at the Children's Hospital of the Hamilton Health Sciences Corporation and the reported effectiveness of those diets. PATIENTS AND METHODS: A questionnaire mailed to 153 pediatric patients was returned by 125 patients (76 Crohn's disease [CD] and 49 ulcerative colitis [UC] patients)--an 82% response rate. RESULTS: The median age of respondents was 13 years, and 62% were male. Ninety per cent and 71% of CD and UC patients, respectively, had changed their diets since diagnosis. Caloric supplements (eg, BOOST [Mead Johnson Nutritionals]), sole source nutrition, low fibre and lactose-free diets were used by more than 15% of CD patients, whereas lactose-free, nonspicy, low acid, additive-free, caloric supplement and low fibre diets were used by more than 15% of UC patients. A diet supplement was more commonly used in CD patients (P < 0.05) and an additive-free diet in UC patients. Corn and corn products, nuts, milk and bran were avoided by more than 20% of CD and UC patients; however, more CD than UC patients avoided corn and corn products. In addition, UC patients (more than 20%) also avoided tomato, other dairy (nonfluid milk-based products and foods containing milk products), chocolate, cheese, wheat, tomato sauces and fruit juice. A benefit was reported for 103 of 141 reported diets, with the most commonly alleviated symptoms being abdominal pain, diarrhea and flatulence. CONCLUSION: Many children with inflammatory bowel disease have altered their diets to manage their disease and have attributed symptomatic relief to these diets.},

No specific dietary toxin or antigen has been identified to have an etiologic role in either ulcerative colitis or Crohn's disease. A possible modulating effect of omega-3 polyunsaturated fatty acids on intestinal inflammation is being investigated. Most prevalent among the nutritional consequences of inflammatory bowel disease is weight loss, for which inadequate caloric intake is primarily responsible. Impairment of linear growth and associated delay in pubertal development commonly complicate childhood Crohn's disease. The two major etiologic factors are chronic undernutrition and direct effects of inflammatory mediators secreted from the inflamed gut. Recent studies have incriminated interleukin-6. Treatment of intestinal inflammation and provision of adequate nutrition are of paramount importance in preventing or remedying growth impairment. Exclusive enteral nutrition using formulated food is efficacious primary therapy of active Crohn's disease, although the mode of action is poorly understood.},

   abstract = {UNLABELLED: Indication for and an evaluation of enteral nutrition in Crohn's disease differ between Japan and western countries. PURPOSE: Japanese results are reported and differences are discussed. RESULTS: Enteral nutrition with an elemental diet is first-line therapy for active Crohn's disease in Japan. The remission induction rate of elemental diet therapy is approximately 80 percent, which is superior to steroids. Furthermore, elemental diet therapy induces radiographic and endoscopic remission. On the other hand, meta-analysis from randomized, controlled trials showed steroids to be more effective than enteral nutrition in western countries. The differences are considered to be the result of such differences as therapeutic duration of enteral nutrition, the composition of enteral diets used, criteria for remission, the quality of life score of a long-term fast with a nasogastric tube, medical care, and health insurance system. The main mechanism of the therapeutic effect of elemental diet is speculated to be attributable to removal of food antigens and decreases of secretion and motility (bowel rest) by very low fat. To prevent relapse and rehospitalization, home enteral nutrition is now used widely in Japan. The therapeutic effect is observed in patients with ileal involvement, and more than 1,200 kcal/day is more effective than a lower amount. CONCLUSION: Most Japanese studies were open-labeled, uncontrolled trials. We should conduct randomized, controlled trials comparing enteral nutrition with steroids during the active stage of Crohn's disease and home enteral nutrition with drugs in maintaining remission and investigate the therapeutic effect, quality of life, and costs.},

   abstract = {During the past 20 years there has been growing interest in the importance of nutritional factors in the pathogenesis of inflammatory bowel disease. There are so far no definite links between ulcerative colitis and diet, but links with Crohn's disease have been studied by both epidemiologists and clinicians. Epidemiological studies, although retrospective, have suggested that patients with Crohn's disease eat more sugar and sweets that control individuals; however, when dietary sugar is restricted, there is little clinical benefit. The clinical approach to nutrition in Crohn's disease has been by the use of elemental diets, which will produce symptomatic and objective remission in up to 90% of compliant patients. Those who return to normal eating soon relapse but, in some studies, have enjoyed prolonged remission on exclusion diets. The foods excluded have been not sugar, but predominantly cereals, dairy products and yeast. Attention has now switched to the possible harmful role of fat in Crohn's disease. The efficacy of elemental feeds appears to depend not on the presentation of nitrogen but on the amount of long chain triglyceride present. Increases in recent years in the frequency of Crohn's disease in Japan have been correlated with increased dietary fat intake, and a recent study suggested that W-3 fatty acids, which are metabolized by immunomodulatory leukotrienes and prostaglandins, may have a beneficial role to play. The links between nutrition and Crohn's disease have now become strong and the role of fat may be the most exciting of all.},

This article reviews much of the research that has evaluated the role of diet in the causation, primary treatment, and adjunctive therapy of both ulcerative colitis (UC) and Crohn's disease (CD). Benefits have been demonstrated in the use of elemental diets or polymeric diets in CD in both acute flare up or maintenance of IBD. A careful team approach can overcome problems in implementing nutritional therapy. Nutrition also has a critical benefit in postoperative CD and perioperative UC. Numerous easily corrected, nutritional abnormalities are often overlooked in patients with IBD, which may have significant consequences. Nutritional therapy may have a central place in the hierarchy of treatment in IBD and further research is critical in this area to better define the benefits of nutrition in IBD.},

The beneficial effect of exclusion of the stream by ileostomy was followed by improvement in patients with CD of the ileum and colon despite little change in the histopathology of the excluded loop, even to the point of allowing restoration of intestinal continuity in some patients. End ileostomy lowers the risk of recurrence of CD compared with anastomotic operations. Ileostomy effluent can reactivate the clinical activity of quiescent bypassed bowel and some of its biochemical processes, and may be related to an ultrafilterable constituent > 5 microns. Experimental models of inflammatory bowel disorders in immunologically altered rodents (transgenic, knockout, or spontaneous) require the presence of normal luminal bacteria, especially of the Bacteroides species, and respond to antibiotic (metronidazole) therapy. Thus, many but not all of the well-recognized clinical features of CD are compatible with a pathogenetic role of the fecal stream. Although difficult to quantitate, this concept opens the way to a variety of testable research lines, and allows some speculation regarding its clinical implications.},

   abstract = {BACKGROUND: Medium chain C8-C10 triglycerides (MCTs) improve fat absorption in short bowel patients. Effects on overall energy absorption remain unknown. AIMS: To determine whether MCTs and medium chain fatty acids (MCFAs) are absorbed in the colon like the short chain fatty acids (SCFAs) or are lost in faeces similarly to long chain fatty acids (LCFAs). METHODS: Nine small bowel resected patients without and 10 with a colon in continuity excreted 2-6 MJ/day and were randomised and crossed over between two high fat diets (10 MJ/day, 50% as fat), based on either long chain triglycerides (LCT) alone or equal quantities of LCT and MCT. RESULTS: Patients with a colon absorbed C8-C10 fatty acids considerably better than patients without a colon at similar and extreme levels of LCFA malabsorption; the colonic impact on absorption of C14-18 fatty acids was negligible. MCT redoubled fat (MCT+LCT) absorption from 23% to 58% in patients with a colon, and increased overall bomb calorimetric energy absorption from 46% to 58%. The increase in fat absorption from 37% to 46% in patients without a colon did not improve overall energy absorption because malabsorption of carbohydrate and protein increased. CONCLUSION: In small bowel resected patients, the colon seems to serve as a digestive organ for medium chain fat, probably absorbed as MCFAs, perhaps because like the SCFAs, they are water soluble. Only patients with a colon gained from MCT treatment.},

   abstract = {Enteral feeding has been shown to be as effective as primary therapy for Crohn's disease, but it requires high patient motivation, may be unpalatable and is expensive. However, in adolescents with growth failure and when corticosteroid therapy is contra-indicated or has failed, it may become the treatment of choice. Furthermore, dietary therapy allows circumvention of the adverse side-effects of repeated courses of steroids. A number of different hypotheses have been proposed to explain the effect of enteral feeds but none has reached universal acceptance. Prospective trials suggest that the exclusion of whole protein is not necessary. Comparison of feeds with differing composition suggests that a low fat content increases efficacy and various explanations have been offered. The reduction of colonic bacterial load may also be important. Because symptoms of Crohn's disease may be provoked by eating, there is a risk of falsely attributing symptoms to specific foodstuffs. However, in many individuals foods can be identified which affect disease activity, and their exclusion leads to prolongation of disease remission. Dietetic supervision during food testing is important to avoid detrimental effects on nutrient and micronutrient intake.},

Other factors have not been extensively investigated. PATIENTS: Preillness non dietary habits and factors were studied in 88 patients with recent onset of inflammatory bowel diseases (55 with ulcerative colitis and 33 with Crohn's disease) and in matched 76 population and 68 clinic controls. RESULTS: No significant differences were found in relation to education, housing, birth weight, breast feeding in infancy and current weight. The current body mass index was significantly lower in patients as compared to clinic controls (p < 0.05). More patients had low levels of physical activity during the preillness period as compared to controls (p < 0.001 vs clinic controls), while more controls engaged in moderate (p < 0.05) or high levels of physical activity in the corresponding periods. Patients spent fewer hours in strenuous physical activity as compared to controls (NS). Patients slept fewer hours per day (p < 0.05 vs clinic controls). More patients than controls experienced stressful life events during the year prior to onset of symptoms (p < 0.05 for patients with Crohn's disease against both controls and all patients vs population controls). CONCLUSIONS: Other environmental factors besides smoking and diet may affect the pathogenesis of inflammatory bowel disease.},

In hospital for Crohn's disease, twenty-eight patients were given nutritional therapy: 9 patients by TPN, 10 by ED, and 9 by PD. Nutritional state, inflammatory reactions, disease activity and clinical remission rate were assessed two weeks and four weeks after treatment, and morphological findings were assessed before and after each nutritional therapy by radiographic and colonoscopic findings. Inflammatory reactions were more effectively controlled by TPN and ED than by PD, and early improvement achieved by TPN and ED was especially note-worthy. Clinical remission rate after treatment by TPN was highest in three types of nutritional approach, but no significant difference was seen at any point. In nutritional state, disease activity and morphological findings, comparable changes were effected without preference. These results suggest that nutritional therapy by total parenteral nutrition and elemental diet is superior to polymeric diet for treating active phase of Crohn's disease with marked inflammatory reactions.},

As to treatment either blockers of enhanced bone resorption can be used (Ca, vitamin D, bisphosphonates and thyrocalcitonin) or substances stimulating new formation of bone (F, growth factors, in postmenopausal women hormonal substitution treatment) or a combination of preparations from both groups can be used. An irreplaceable part is played also by exercise, depending, of course, on the patient's general condition.},

   abstract = {OBJECTIVES: During total parenteral nutrition, gallbladder motility is impaired, resulting in sludge and stone formation. Little is known about gallbladder motility during prolonged enteral nutrition. METHODS: We studied gallbladder motility during continuous enteral nutrition (CEN) in nine hospitalized patients with active inflammatory bowel disease. The patients received a polymeric diet (2000 kcal/24 h) by CEN through a nasogastric tube for a prolonged period. Gallbladder volumes were obtained daily by ultrasonography, starting from day 0 (before CEN) and on 7 consecutive days during CEN. At days 0, 1, 4, and 7, the gallbladder response to i.v. cholecystokinin (CCK-33; 0.5 Ivy Dog unit/kg/h) was studied. Plasma CCK levels were determined at regular intervals by radioimmunoassay. RESULTS: No significant differences were observed on day 0 between patients and a group of nine healthy control subjects in fasting gallbladder volumes (19.4 +/- 2.3 and 19.6 +/- 2.4 cm3, respectively) and gallbladder contraction during CCK infusion (56 +/- 14% and 69 +/- 7%, respectively). During CEN, from day 1 to day 7, mean gallbladder volume remained significantly (p < 0.05) reduced compared with fasting gallbladder volume, and mean plasma CCK levels remained significantly (p < 0.05) increased compared with fasting levels. Although gallbladder volume was significantly reduced during CEN, the gallbladder contractile response to CCK was not affected; at days 1, 4, and 7, gallbladder contraction was 36-57%. CONCLUSIONS: During CEN, 1) gallbladder volume is significantly reduced and plasma CCK levels are significantly increased, 2) these effects are sustained over time (7 days), and 3) the gallbladder remains responsive to exogenous CCK. These results indicate that gallbladder contractility and gallbladder responsiveness to CCK are preserved during prolonged CEN in patients with inflammatory bowel disease.},

   abstract = {About 90% of patients with Crohn's disease require surgery at some time in their lives but the clinical recurrence rate after surgery is about 50% within 5 years, with 50% requiring further surgery within 10 years. Endoscopic evidence of relapse can be found in 75% within 12 weeks of resection. There is therefore a major problem to be solved. The solution is less clear. Retrospective studies suggest that smoking is a major factor determining a poor prognosis after surgery and it is most important that patients are encouraged to stop. There is strong evidence linking diet with Crohn's disease but the mechanism and nature of this link remains unclear. A low total fat intake, possibly supplemented with eudragitcoated n-3 fatty acid (fish oil) looks reasonable on current evidence but not proven. Mesalazine and metronidazole are the drugs for which most supportive evidence is available. The individual trials of mesalazine have generally proved inconclusive and meta-analyses have been needed to demonstrate a significant beneficial effect (approximately halving the relapse rate at 1 year). More recent large controlled studies performed after the meta-analyses however have again proved negative and the benefit is probably more modest than the meta-analyses suggested. Metronidazole, 20 mg/day for the first 3 months after surgery, has been shown to reduce relapse by just over one-third with a beneficial effect that was surprisingly sustained throughout a 3 year follow-up period. Peripheral neuropathy is a problem and further studies are needed at lower dosage. Azathioprine, 1.5-2 mg/kg/day is effective as maintenance therapy but there is insufficient evidence to recommend its routine post-operative use, moreover it takes up to 3 months to have an effect. Although budesonide has been shown to delay the time to relapse in non-operated patients it, like other corticosteroids, has been shown to be no better than placebo when maintenance is assessed according to the proportion of patients who remain relapse-free after 1 year. Patients undergoing operation for Crohn's disease should therefore be strongly advised to stop smoking. A 3 month course of oral metronidazole plus continued maintenance with oral mesalazine can be justified on current evidence but further studies are needed.},

To assess the effect of steroid therapy on body composition, energy expenditure, and fuel selection in Crohn disease, we compared 12 patients (6 men and 6 women) with biopsy-proven ileal Crohn disease with 11 healthy volunteers (6 men and 5 women). Five patients [Crohn's disease activity index (CDAI) = 98.4 +/- 3.78] took no medication and seven patients (CDAI = 283.9 +/- 22.5) were administered 29 +/- 18 mg prednisone/d. Body composition was evaluated by isotopic dilution and bioelectrical impedance analysis, and 24-h energy expenditure and basal metabolic rate were measured in a respiratory chamber. Fat-free mass was not significantly different among groups, whereas fat mass was lower in patients than in control subjects. Energy intake was higher in treated patients than in both untreated patients (P = 0.004) and control subjects (P = 0.005). Fecal losses were not significantly different between untreated patients and control subjects, but were higher (and proportional to the CDAI) in treated patients than in control subjects (P = 0.001). Metabolizable energy was not significantly different among groups, whereas energy balance was significantly higher in treated patients than in both control subjects (P = 0.0057) and untreated patients (P = 0.018). Nitrogen balance was mildly negative in treated patients compared with both control subjects and untreated patients, but not significantly so. In conclusion, prednisone treatment in Crohn disease patients stimulates food intake, promoting an overall positive energy balance despite large fecal nutrient losses.},

   abstract = {The ability of inflammatory bowel disease (IBD) patients to tolerate dairy products and the guidance they receive from physicians and nutritionists on this subject are important considerations in the management of their IBD. Although most affected persons are able to consume a glass of milk daily without discomfort, additional consideration must be given to specific factors that can be relevant to certain individuals. The declaration by patients that they are "dairy sensitive" may be related to lactose intolerance or malabsorption, the long-chain triacylglycerol content of milk, allergy to milk proteins, as well as psychologic factors and the misconception that dairy products can be detrimental to their health. The prevalence of lactose malabsorption is significantly greater in patients with Crohn disease involving the small bowel than it is in patients with Crohn disease involving the colon or ulcerative colitis. In the latter colonic conditions the prevalence of lactose malabsorption is mainly determined by ethnic risk, which is based on genetic factors. In addition, lactose malabsorption in Crohn disease of the small bowel may be determined by factors other than lactase enzyme activity, such as bacterial overgrowth and/or small bowel transit time. Physicians differ widely in the advice they give their patients: some dogmatically advise avoidance of dairy products when the diagnosis is made whereas others discount the possible role of dairy in the management of IBD. IBD patients avoid dairy products more than they would need to based on the prevalence of lactose malabsorption and/or milk intolerance, probably partly because of incorrect patient perceptions and arbitrary advice from physicians and authors of popular diet books. Adequate scientific and clinical information is now available to permit recommendations about the intake of dairy products for each IBD patient.},

Particulate antigens are mainly uptaken from M cell of Peyer's patches, inducing IgA production in the intestinal mucosa. Lymphocytes are continuously recirculating through the intestinal mucosa to facilitate intestinal immune response. Dysregulation of lymphocyte migration and cytokine imbalance in the intestinal mucosa may be largely involved in the pathogenesis of inflammatory bowel diseases including intestinal allergy and Crohn's disease. There is also a possibility that dietary components especially long chain fatty acid could influence immune cell function of the intestinal mucosa. Because dietary components are closely associated with immunological function of intestinal mucosa, the importance of dietary manipulation for the management of inflammatory bowel diseases should be concerned.},

   abstract = {Gut-associated lymphoid tissue is the major inductive site of the mucosal immune system, which is functionally independent of the systemic immune system. Both the amount and type of dietary fat modulate intestinal immune function. Absorption of long-chain fatty acids stimulates lymphocyte flux and lymphocyte blastogenesis in intestinal lymphatics. Long-chain fatty acid absorption also significantly enhances migration of T lymphocytes to Peyer's patches, possibly due to up-regulation of adhesion molecules, such as alpha4-integrin and L-selectin. Lipoproteins are involved in stimulation of lymphocyte function by both receptor-dependent and independent mechanisms. However, unsaturated fatty acids at higher concentrations have a suppressive effect on cell-mediated immunity via eicosanoid release, receptor affinity changes or interactions with intracellular signal transduction. Fat absorption also influences various other cells in the intestinal mucosa: increased cytokine release from intestinal epithelial cells follows long-chain fatty acid absorption. In Crohn's disease, elemental diets and total parenteral nutrition often induce remission, possibly by reducing antigenic load on activated immune cells in the intestine and, thus, down-regulating hyperreactive CD4 cells. Dietary oleic acid supplements caused an immunological reversal effect in the intestinal immune system of animals fed an elemental diet. An excess of long-chain fatty acids in an elemental diet, therefore, may negate its beneficial effect on gut-associated lymphoid tissues in Crohn's disease. In contrast, supplemental dietary fish oil apparently tends to prevent relapse of Crohn's disease. Because dietary fat intake is closely associated with immunological function of the intestinal mucosa, careful manipulation of dietary fat can be important in management of this disease.},

   abstract = {Current available therapies for Crohn's disease in Japan are reviewed in this report. Elemental diet is most effective for both inducing and maintaining remission in Japan. There appears to be no difference between elemental diet, oligopeptide diet and intact nutrients in effectiveness for active Crohn's disease. Although corticosteroid is also useful for treating active Crohn's disease, low dose of it is not effective for maintaining remission. Steroid has important role in combined therapy with elemental diet. New steroid, budesonide appears to be fascinate because of less adverse effects. Recently, instead of salazosulfapyridine, 5-aminosalicylic acid (5-ASA) proved to be more effective not only for active disease but also for maintenance of remission including small intestinal type of Crohn's disease with reduced adverse effects. Azathioprine, 6-mercaptopurine (6-MP), methotrexate and metronidazole are second choice treatment in patients whose disease relapse frequently. Although methotrexate appears to be effective for active Crohn's disease, the role of it has to be defined. Evidences support the use of 5-ASA and methotrexate for prophylaxis after surgery. It is important to chose and combine the therapies, thinking of the situation of each patient.},

We report a case of systemic AA amyloidosis complicating Crohn's disease. In 1979, a 26-year-old Japanese man presented with diarrhea, melena and perianal abscesses, and was diagnosed as having Crohn's disease. He was treated with oral prednisolone, salazosulfapyridine and diet therapy. However, the gastrointestinal symptoms recurred and he was hospitalized several times. In 1991, his thyroid gland was found to be swollen, but with normal thyroid function, and his thyroid gland became larger subsequently. In October 1995, he showed renal dysfunction (blood urea nitrogen 33.2 mg/dl; serum creatinine 1.5 mg/dl) with proteinuria. His renal function had been deteriorating rapidly. On September 13, 1996, he was admitted to the Tsukuba University Hospital. At the time of admission, his renal function showed a blood urea nitrogen of 129.5 mg/dl with a creatinine of 5.4 mg/dl. The urine contained 0.8 g of protein per 24 hours. He presented with diarrhea for several days before admission and was treated with central venous hyperalimentation. Despite supportive care, he developed end-stage renal failure, then hemodialysis was initiated on October 7. His condition was complicated by a complete auriculoventricular block on October 18. He died of hemoperitoneum on October 25. On postmortem examination, extensive amyloid deposits were found in multiple organs including kidneys, intestine, heart, thyroid gland, lungs, liver, spleen, pancreas, gall bladder, adrenal glands, testis, prostate, bone marrow and parathyroid glands. Analysis of amyloid protein in the autopsy specimens showed type AA.},

   abstract = {Despite its anatomical location between two regions of high cancer risk, the small bowel rarely develops a malignant tumor. However, in recent years, small bowel cancer incidence rates have begun to rise. The purpose of this review is to explore the descriptive and analytic epidemiology of small bowel cancer for those factors that protect this organ and those factors associated with loss of this protection. Within the small intestine, the sites at the highest risk are the duodenum, for adenocarcinomas, and the ileum, for carcinoids and lymphomas. In industrialized countries, small bowel cancers are predominantly adenocarcinomas; in developing countries, lymphomas are much more common. The incidence of small bowel cancer rises with age and has generally been higher among males than among females. The risk factors for small bowel cancer include dietary factors similar to those implicated in large bowel cancer, cigarette smoking, alcohol intake, and other medical conditions, including Crohn's disease, familial adenomatous polyposis, cholecystectomy, peptic ulcer disease, and cystic fibrosis. The protective factors may include rapid cell turnover, a general absence of bacteria, an alkaline environment, and low levels of activating enzymes of precarcinogens. Adenocarcinomas of the small and large bowel are similar in risk factors and geographic distribution but not in recent time trends; colorectal cancer incidence rates in the United States have been falling since the mid-1980s. Small bowel lymphoma may be associated with infectious agents, such as HIV. Given the differences in anatomic and geographic location among histological subtypes, much may be learned from well-designed, histology-specific epidemiological and genetic studies of cancer of the small bowel.},

   abstract = {The value of nutritional support in the prevention and treatment of malnutrition in Crohn's disease is undisputed but its role in primary therapy continues to be debated. Controlled trials have demonstrated that enteral nutrition induces remission rates comparable to that of corticosteroid therapy in Crohn's disease and remains the treatment of choice for specific subgroups such as children with signs of growth impairment and patients with intolerable steroid-induced side effects. The mechanism by which an enteral diet induces remission in Crohn's disease is unclear. Bowel rest, reduced antigenic load, nutritional effects, the provision of trophic amino acids, modification of gut flora, intestinal permeability, or fecal pH have been proposed. Equally, the fat profile of the feed may reduce pro-inflammatory ecosanoid synthesis and thus modify disease activity. Maintaining long-term remission remains a challenge in the management of this disease. Cyclic administration of enteral diets, maintenance drug therapy, fat manipulated formulas, or fish oil therapy may be strategies to prolong diet-induced remission. In the future, nutrient derivatives that play a role in the protective processes of the intestinal mucosa may have application in nutritional therapy in Crohn's disease.},

Bone mineral density of the lumbar spine (L2-L4), proximal femur, and forearm was measured in 51 female controls and 50 females with Crohn's disease using dual energy X-ray absorptiometry (Lunar DPXPlus, Madison, WI). Dietary intake for all Crohn's disease participants was analyzed using both 3-d dietary records and a food frequency questionnaire. When compared to healthy controls, bone mineral density values of Crohn's disease participants were decreased for all sites, particularly the spine (1.169 +/- 0.114, p = 0.054), Ward's area (0.831 +/- 0.128, p = 0.052), and the femoral neck (0.927 +/- 0.100, p = 0.01). Factors associated with lower bone density in Crohn's participants were weight, corticosteroid usage, length and age of diagnosis, history and length of resection, and dietary intakes of magnesium, copper, magnesium, vitamin K, and zinc. The results of this study indicate for the first time that diet plays a role in the development of low bone density in premenopausal women with Crohn's disease.},

AIM: To investigate the pre-illness diet in patients with recent IBD in comparison with matched population and clinic controls. METHODS: Quantified dietary histories were obtained from 87 patients with recent IBD (54 ulcerative colitis (UC) and 33 Crohn's disease (CD)) and 144 controls. Odds ratios (OR) for IBD were derived for intake levels of various foods. RESULTS: A high sucrose consumption was associated with an increased risk for IBD (OR 2.85 (p = 0.03) against population controls and 5.3 (p = 0.00) against clinic controls). Lactose consumption showed no effect while fructose intake was negatively associated with risk for IBD (NS). Similar trends were noted in UC and CD. A high fat intake was associated with an increased risk for UC; this was particularly marked for animal fat (OR 4.09, p = 0.02) and cholesterol (OR 4.57, p = 0.02). A high intake of fluids (p = 0.04), magnesium (p = 0.04), vitamin C, and fruits (NS) was negatively associated with the risk for IBD, while a positive association was found for retinol (p = 0.01). Most of the findings were similar in UC and CD except for potassium and vegetable consumption which showed a negative association only with risk for CD. CONCLUSIONS: An association was found between pre-illness diet and subsequent development of UC and CD. The effect of dietary components may be primary or modulatory.},

   abstract = {Low bone mineral density (BMD) is common in patients with Crohn's disease; however, the pathogenesis of bone loss and risk factors for osteoporosis are not established. Our aim was to evaluate the clinical, dietary, and nutritional determinants of BMD in Crohn's disease. A cross-sectional analysis of 117 patients with Crohn's disease was undertaken. All patients underwent a clinical and dietary evaluation including assessment of nutritional state and life-style. BMD was measured at the hip and lumbar spine by dual-energy x-ray absorptiometry; and z scores obtained by comparison with age- and sex-matched normal values for the healthy UK population. Multiple regression analysis was used to assess associations between BMD and potential risk factors, allowing for possible confounding variables. Thirteen (11%) patients had osteoporosis (z score < -2), with osteopenia (z score < -1, > -2) in a further 34 (29%). Patients with jejunal disease had significantly lower BMD at the spine (P = 0.03) and femoral neck (P = 0.02) than those with disease at other sites. Mean BMD was significantly lower at the hip of patients with previous bowel resection (diff in means = 0.53, 95% CI -0.97, -0.08, P = 0.02), but type of surgery was not significant. Active disease, menstrual history, diet, level of physical activity, and smoking were not associated with low bone mass. At the lumbar spine, body weight (P < 0.0001), male sex (P < 0.0001), and current prednisolone use (P < 0.02) were independently predictive of low bone mass. Body weight (P < 0.0001), male sex (P < 0.0001), and cumulative steroid dose (P = 0.02) were predictive at the femoral neck. The major determinants of BMD in Crohn's disease are body weight, current steroid use, and cumulative steroid dose. Men with Crohn's disease are at greatest risk of osteoporosis, with jejunal involvement and previous bowel resection also contributing to the low bone mineral density.},

The aim of the study was to investigate the possible pathogenic role of some characteristic 'modern life' dietary factors in IBD. DESIGN: Case-control, studying risk factors in recently diagnosed cases, 290 with Crohn's disease and 398 with ulcerative colitis, compared with 616 population controls. Smoking, age, gender and education were taken into account by using logistic regression analysis. SETTING: Hospital cases and population controls. INTERVENTIONS: Questionnaires. MAIN OUTCOME MEASURES: Logistic regression-derived odds ratios. RESULTS: A positive association with cola drinks [OR: 2.2 (95% CI 1.5-3.1)], chewing gum [OR: 1.5 (95% CI: 1.1-2.1)] and chocolate consumption [OR: 2.5 (95% CI: 1.8-3.5)] and a negative association with citrus fruit consumption [OR: 0.5 (95% CI 0.3-0.7)] and the development of Crohn's disease were found.

There was a negative association between the intake of citrus fruits [OR: 0.5 (95% CI 0.4-0.8)] and 'having a stuffed pet' for a period longer than 5 years [OR: 0.6 (95% CI 0.4-0.9)] and developing the disorder. No association with the frequency of tooth brushing and developing IBD was found. CONCLUSION: All the nutritional items mentioned may be true risk factors or they just might be the expression of a modern life-style also involving other risk factors for the development of IBD which at the present are still unknown.},

   abstract = {Because home total parenteral nutrition (TPN) is not available to most of the Brazilian population, an alternative treatment for short bowel syndrome was evaluated. Four patients ages 40-65 y (mean: 53.75 +/- 10.59), three with mesenteric thrombosis, and one with Crohn's disease were studied. The average length of the remaining small bowel in these patients was 54.5 +/- 6.4 cm; the ileocecal valve was preserved in 3 cases. A progressive step diet was used for intestinal adaptation. Administration of pectin was started at the beginning of the special oral diet (step 1), followed by medium-chain triacylglycerols (MCTs) and complex, nonfermentable sugars (step 2); coconut oil (47% MCTs) and simple sugars (step 3); and long-chain triacylglycerols and lactose (step 4). TPN was interrupted at step 3 or 4 when the energy content of the diet reached 150% of the patient's resting energy expenditure, if serum albumin and weight were stable or increasing, and if the frequency, amount, and consistency of stools remained unchanged. Nutritional follow-up showed that patients responded well to this approach; also, patients returned to their previous professional activities. Thus, enteral formulas were not essential for gastrointestinal adaptation. Home TPN should not be indicated on the basis of strict criteria, but rather when a patient fails to adapt to a progressive, special oral diet.},

   abstract = {The inflammatory bowel diseases (IBDs) are characterized by intestinal inflammation of unknown etiology. Two distinct disorders, Crohn's disease and ulcerative colitis, have been identified. Three theories of IBD etiology are currently under consideration: 1) reaction to a persistent intestinal infection, 2) existence of a defective mucosal barrier to luminal antigens, and 3) a dysregulated host immune response to ubiquitous antigens. In each of these theories, either pathogenic or resident luminal bacteria constantly stimulate the mucosal and systemic immune systems to perpetuate the inflammatory cascade. Chronicity of inflammation results from an interaction of the persistent stimulus of microbial antigens with genetically determined host susceptibility factors that determine the individual's immune response or mucosal barrier function. The pathogenesis of IBD involves a series of steps, beginning with the breach of the intestinal mucosal barrier by infectious agents or toxins. The defective barrier exposes lamina propria immune cells to the continual presence of resident luminal bacteria, bacterial products, or dietary antigens, which perpetuates the inflammatory cascade. Many immunoregulatory abnormalities are noted in IBD, including the ratio of proinflammatory to immunosuppressive cytokines, selective activation of T(H) lymphocyte subsets, and abnormalities in epithelial antigen presentation. When activated during the initial inflammatory process, macrophages and T lymphocytes secrete a host of cytokines, which recruit other inflammatory cell types, thereby continuing the process. Tissue injury is the net result of the soluble products of the activated inflammatory cells. Knowledge of the pathogenesis in IBD suggests that the ultimate goals of therapy should be to block the proinflammatory mediators toward the proximal, rather than the distal, end of the cascade, to decrease the constant antigenic drive of luminal bacteria, and to correct the dysregulated immune response.},

   abstract = {High-dose corticosteroids remain the gold standard of therapy in acute Crohn's disease, but is associated with a variety of side effects. Nutritional therapy could be an interesting alternative, but corticosteroids are meant to be significantly superior according to efficacy. Published studies, identified by references, MEDLINE and meta-analysis, were evaluated for efficacy of nutritional therapy in acute Crohn's disease. In 18 evaluable of 38 identified publications, 571 patients were treated with nutritional therapy: 295 received elemental diet, 214 oligopeptide diet and 62 polymeric diet. Remission rates were 60%, 55% and 66% respectively. However, only intention-to-treat-analysis was performed in all the studies. When correcting for patients who really were treated with nutritional therapy, remission rates were substantially better: 73%, 70% and 67% respectively, thus comparable with that of corticosteroids. Positive predictors for successful treatment were stenosing disease and low ESR. Remission seems to last as long as after corticosteroid treatment, when a reinduction diet is performed. Negative aspects of nutritional therapy are poor tolerance and higher costs. Perspectives for the future aim on broadening of indications, improving acceptance (by adjuvant instead of exclusive nutrition, or new flavors) and efficacy by modification of compounds (such as glutamine, omega-3 fatty acids or trace elements) or combination with other therapeutic agents (e.g., mesalamine).},

   abstract = {BACKGROUND: Although the pathogenesis of Crohn's disease remains unclear, an elemental diet has been shown to be clinically effective. Glutamine is an energy source for many cell types including colonocytes. PURPOSE: This study was designed to assess the potential clinical effects on colitis of changing the dietary quantity of glutamine. METHODS: Colitis was induced by intrarectal administration of 30 mg of trinitrobenzenesulfonic acid with 50 percent ethanol vehicle in Sprague-Dawley rats. Rats were randomly allocated into three dietary groups: Group 1, a commercial elemental diet-based diet without glutamine; Group 2, a commercial elemental diet (glutamine: 12 percent of amino acid content); Group 3, elemental diet with 24 percent glutamine. Diets were started one week before colitis induction and continued until sacrifice. Rats were killed at one, three, and five weeks after colitis induction, and colons were excised. Damage evaluation was based on the percentage of rats with ulcer, macroscopic damage score, average ulcer area, and microscopic damage score. RESULTS: Group 2 rats weighed more than Group 1 rats at three weeks because of their higher dietary intake. At one week after colitis induction, all groups had comparable damage. At three weeks, the macroscopic damage score was higher in Group 3 than in Groups 1 and 2. At five weeks, rats in Group 3 had significantly more severe damage than those in Groups 1 and 2 in terms of all four indexes. CONCLUSION: We conclude that excess glutamine has a deleterious effect on ulcers in trinitrobenzenesulfonic acid-induced colitis.},

She suffered from Crohn's disease and had a history of jejuno-ileal resection because of perforation of the ileum in 1988. Radiographs revealed multiple bilateral renal stones, and the urine oxalate concentration was elevated. She was treated with extracorporeal shock wave lithotripsy and the administration of sodium bicarbonate and citrate, but these treatments did not prevent recurrence and enlargement of stones. Renal function was gradually worsened and we performed transurethral lithotomy and percutaneous nephrolithotripsy. The stones were mainly composed of oxalate calcium monohydrate. A renal biopsy was performed at the operation, showing deposition of crystals in almost all renal tubules. Diet therapy (low oxalate and low fat) and the administration of sodium bicarbonate and citrate were performed strictly and recurrence was not recognized 10 months after complete removal of the stones.},

The goal of this conference was to establish standard recommendations for the conservative, dietary, surgical and psychosomatic treatment of intestinal and extraintestinal manifestations. These recommendations are based on the personal experience of the experts involved as well as the literature. In preparation of the conference, questionnaires were developed which were answered by all nearly 100 physicians specializing in internal medicine and gastroenterology. These were analysed by the chairmen of the working groups which wrote a consensus proposal in Halle. This was discussed, modified and passed by the plenary session and subsequently published in the Zeitschrift fur Gastroenterologie (German J Gastroenterology) with a comment and the relevant literature. The guideline became a standard in German gastroenterology. Unfortunately, only half of the recommendations are supported by controlled trials and other representatives of the health care system were not involved. Currently an update of this guideline is prepared via internet (www.prous.com/ts).},

Dietary and other environmental factors, and lower intestinal flora and their chemical interactions occur in the pathogenesis of both. Events at the mucosal surface may be influenced by factors in the luminal environment and by contributions of the host. In addition, both forms of IBD--Crohn's disease (CD) and ulcerative colitis (UC)--have distinctive associated host events. Even within CD and UC, different clinical patterns and prognoses may have different specific host mechanisms. Some of the current putative pathogenetic processes in CRC and IBD are reviewed. Particular attention is given to hypotheses relating to the role of dietetic substances, mainly fibre and dairy products, and how they may affect disease formation. It is argued that within the context of hypotheses proposed for possible beneficial effects of these two dietetic factors, CRC and IBD may be considered together. Further support is lent to arguments that similar and additional hypothetical features ascribed to beneficial effects of fibre may be attributed to disaccharides, lactose and its derivatives, lactulose and lactitol.},

In this study the effects of ED on intestinal inflammation were investigated in a rat model of granulomatous enteritis. Intestinal inflammation was induced by a single intramural injection of peptidoglycan-polysaccharide (PG-PS) from group A streptococci into rat ileal Peyer's patches. A single injection of PG-PS in combination with fibrinogen, which retains PG-PS at the injection site, induced severe granulomatous inflammation associated with mucosal ulceration. Immunohistochemical study and immunocytochemical analysis of the cell suspension from Peyer's patches showed accumulation of macrophages and an increase in interleukin-2 receptor (IL-2R)-positive T cells after PG-PS treatment. Chemiluminescence (ChL) activity and nitrite and nitrate (NOx) levels in the mesenteric venous blood as well as Ca(2+)-independent (inducible) nitric oxide synthase (NOS) activity in Peyer's patches were increased by PG-PS treatment. In rats fed with ED, both macroscopic and histologic damage scores were significantly decreased as compared with those in rats fed with the control diet. ED inhibited the increase in the numbers of macrophages and IL-2R-positive T cells in Peyer's patches. Increased ChL activity, NOx levels, and Ca(2+)-independent NOS activity were also reduced significantly by feeding with ED. These data suggest that ED reduces progression of PG-PS-induced chronic intestinal inflammation by modulating activation of T cells, production of nitric oxide, and generation of oxygen free radicals.},

   abstract = {Increased gastrointestinal permeability was found in celiac disease already 20 years ago. Originally a genetical defect was supposed leading to elevated permeability and later to celiac disease. However, patients under long-term gluten-free diet normalized their permeability tests. On the other side, unaffected relatives of patients with celiac disease showed high permeability but not different from patients with irritable bowel syndrome and with a tendency for normalization during follow-up. In active symptomatic celiac disease, permeability is elevated in the gastroduodenum - measured by sucrose test - as well as in the small intestine - measured by lactulose/mannitol ratio. The sensitivity in active celiac disease is high (near 100%), the specificity is low due to high permeability in many intestinal diseases as in acute infectious gastroenteritis, Crohn's disease, nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drug treatment, etc. In contrast, lactulose/mannitol test permeability is much less sensitive in silent celiac disease without diarrhea (74%). The real importance of permeability disease is established by its use for follow-up of celiac patients under gluten-free diet whereas it is correlated to the degree of mucosal atrophy. In vitro tests also show increased lactulose mucosal to serosal flux in celiac disease, but not correlated to oral permeability test. In conclusion, lactulose/mannitol test is the only noninvasive functional test in celiac disease which has essential importance in active celiac disease and in follow-up under diet.},

However, there are very few reported cases of patients with Crohn's disease with muscle symptoms and/or high serum creatine phospho-kinase (CPK) levels. We report here a patient with Crohn's disease who experienced skeletal muscle damage with extremely high serum CPK level during treatment with an elemental diet. The non-parenteral administration of large amounts of carbohydrate and limited glycogen degradation capability may be a possible causative mechanism for this elemental diet-induced muscle damage.},

   abstract = {It is currently held that the pathogenesis of inflammatory bowel disease (IBD) involves a complex interaction of host responses, some immunologic and genetically determined, and external influences including microbial and dietary factors. Nutritional surveys and studies testing stepwise exclusion dietary compounds have suggested that dietary factors might be linked to the occurrence of IBD. Food allergy was suggested early as a possible trigger for the inflammatory response; however, no firm evidence has been gathered over the years to substantiate this possibility. The possibility that patients with Crohn's disease may have an unusual premorbid pattern of dietary intake has also been examined since the early seventies. Several groups of investigators report a high intake of refined sugars (i.e. sucrose), recycled cooking oil, a more frequent consumption of fast foods in patients with Crohn's disease and ulcerative colitis respectively. However, a critical comparison of incidence and prevalence studies published from 1976 until 1994 clearly showed no pre-existing nutritional abnormality that has been identified consistently in patients who develop inflammatory bowel disease.},

   abstract = {BACKGROUND: Elemental diet is considered an effective primary treatment for active Crohn's disease, but it is usually given by a feeding tube. METHODS: Twenty-two patients (12 males, median age 30 years, range 18-60) with moderately active Crohn's disease were enrolled in a randomized study in which the efficacy of an elemental diet administered orally was compared to high-dose corticosteroids in achieving clinical and laboratory remission. Ten patients were treated by oral elemental diet (Peptamen, Clintec, USA) and 10 received corticosteroids. Both treatment regimens lasted 2 weeks. The two groups did not differ with respect to age, sex, body weight, location of disease, treatment or disease activity prior to the study. In all patients studied, simple Crohn's disease activity index, nutritional status (expressed as body mass index), percentage of ideal body weight, fat mass, fat free mass, erythrocyte sedimentation rate, interleukin-6, intestinal permeability (expressed as permeability index), prealbumin, retinol binding protein and multiskin test were evaluated before and after treatment. RESULTS: After 2 weeks of treatment, there were significant improvements in simple Crohn's disease activity index, erythrocyte sedimentation rate, permeability index, body mass index, prealbumin, retinol binding protein and multiskin test in the elemental diet group. There were significant improvements in simple Crohn's disease activity index and fat free mass in the corticosteroid group. CONCLUSIONS: These data suggest that, in the short term, an oral elemental diet is at least as effective as steroids in inducing remission of mild-moderately active Crohn's disease, but it may be more effective in improving the nutritional status of these patients, probably through a more rapid restoration of normal intestinal permeability.},

   abstract = {PURPOSE: To determine the effects of olestra, a zero-calorie fat substitute that is neither digested nor absorbed, on the well-being and disease state of persons with chronic inflammatory bowel disease (IBD) in remission. PATIENTS AND METHODS: Eighty-nine patients with mild to moderate ulcerative colitis (n = 43) or Crohn's disease (n = 46) in remission, with a history of disease of 2 years or longer, were enrolled in this prospective study from nine private practices, three university-based medical centers, and one Veterans Administration medical center in the United States. Forty-four patients were randomly assigned to receive olestra and 45 to receive triglycerides in chips or cookies daily for 4 weeks. At Week 4, patients were classified as in remission, worsened, or relapsed according to an investigator's global assessment based on sigmoidoscopy (for ulcerative colitis) or the Crohn's disease activity index, laboratory findings, and clinical course. RESULTS: At Week 4, the olestra and triglyceride groups did not differ significantly with respect to the percentages of patients who relapsed (P = 0.494; difference = 2.4%; upper 95% CL = 8.8%) or with respect to the percentages of patients who experienced any worsening of their symptoms (P = 0.630; difference = 0.2%; upper 95% CL = 13.3%). Of evaluable patients, 90% (37 of 41) given olestra remained in remission with no worsening, compared with 90% (38 of 42) given triglycerides. Gastrointestinal symptoms were comparable between the treatment groups, and there were no treatment-related laboratory abnormalities. Six patients were excluded from analysis for reasons unrelated to treatment. CONCLUSION: Olestra did not affect the activity of quiescent mild to moderate IBD.},
