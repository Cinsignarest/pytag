   abstract = {Growth retardation and delay in sexual maturation are the major complications of child-onset Crohn's disease (CD). Nutritional assessment and monitoring should comprise: weight and height measurement with calculation of respective velocities (growth velocity should be > or = 4-5 cm/year during the prepubertal period); pubertal staging; dietetic evaluation; laboratory analysis for mineral, vitamin and trace element deficiencies; bone age. At diagnosis, weight loss and growth delay are present in 80-90% and 1/3 of cases, respectively. In case of an acute flare-up in a CD child with normal nutritional status, nutritional therapy is limited to oral feeding, with a caloric intake at least equal to recommended dietary allowances for age and sex. A low-fiber diet is advised in case of small bowel stenosis. No diet has been shown as efficient in the long-term maintenance of remission. Exclusive enteral nutrition (EN) is an alternative to corticosteroids for the treatment of an acute flare-up of CD, especially in case of malnutrition. Prolonged nocturnal EN is of great interest for the treatment of growth retardation and delay of sexual maturation and in case of steroid-dependent or steroid-refractory CD. In case of steroid-dependent CD with no delay of growth and/or sexual maturation, immunomodulating agents are nowadays an alternative to long-term EN. Efficacy of polymeric solutions is identical to that of semi-elemental or elemental solutions. Parenteral nutrition is limited to an acute flare-up with resistance to medical treatment and/or EN, and contraindications to surgery; occlusion or fistula; short bowel syndrome.},

   abstract = {Inflammatory bowel diseases, ulcerative colitis, and Crohn's disease, are chronic intestinal disorders of unknown etiology in which in genetically susceptible individuals, the mucosal immune system shows an aberrant response towards commensal bacteria. The gastrointestinal tract has developed ingenious mechanisms to coexist with its autologous microflora, but rapidly responds to invading pathogens and then returns to homeostasis with its commensal bacteria after the pathogenic infection is cleared. In case of disruption of this tightly-regulated homeostasis, chronic intestinal inflammation may be induced. Previous studies showed that some commensal bacteria are detrimental while others have either no influence or have a protective action. In addition, each host has a genetically determined response to detrimental and protective bacterial species. These suggest that therapeutic manipulation of imbalance of microflora can influence health and disease. This review focuses on new insights into the role of commensal bacteria in gut health and disease, and presents recent findings in innate and adaptive immune interactions. Therapeutic approaches to modulate balance of intestinal microflora and their potential mechanisms of action are also discussed.},

   abstract = {The reason of bleeding from alimentary tract in small children - may sometimes be a big problem and we may need a long observation before making the diagnosis. One of the most frequent reasons of bleeding is food allergy, which resembles allergic colitis. However, bleeding can be the first symptom of ulcerative colitis or Crohn's disease, but it is very rare in small children. We present three cases of small children with bleeding from alimentary tract, in which it was difficult to make the final diagnosis. In our cases, the endoscopic and histopathological examination showed changes, which suggested non-specific inflammatory bowel disease. The microabscesses in crypts and inflammatory infiltration in the mucosa indicated ulcerative colitis. Moreover, one child had also inflammatory infiltration in the oesophagus and duodenum, which is typical for Crohn's disease. We conclude that even when the clinical course suggests that the reason of presenting symptoms was food allergy, there is need for longer observation until one can make the final diagnosis.},

   abstract = {Our understanding of the pathogenic mechanisms that underlie the chronic intestinal inflammation characteristic of Crohn's disease (CD) has advanced greatly in recent years. We now realize that effective treatment will not be achieved through non-specific generalized immunosuppression, but rather with the development of well-designed therapies that target specific immunological pathways. The success of infliximab has driven exploration into the blockade of additional pro-inflammatory cytokines, such as interleukin-12 and interferon-gamma. Novel strategies have also emerged that target other components of the inflammatory cascade, such as the migration of leukocytes to the intestine. The identification of mutations in the nod2/card15 gene that are associated with a predisposition for the development of CD has focused attention on the role of the innate immune system in CD. This has allowed a fundamentally different approach to the development of therapies for CD aimed at intensifying innate immune responses. In parallel with the development of several 'biological' agents, alternative therapeutic options have also shown promising results. The use of probiotic bacteria as both therapeutic agents and delivery vehicles for other molecules is a rapidly developing field. As the role of regulatory T cells in the pathogenesis of CD is revealed, the potential of immunotherapy is being opened up. With so many therapeutic options in sight and the ongoing elucidation of the pathogenesis of CD, it will become steadily more possible to tailor treatment to the clinicopathological and immunogenetic profile of the individual patient.},

   abstract = {PURPOSE OF REVIEW: Multiple sclerosis affects many people, often in early adulthood, and causes significant disability. Natalizumab is a novel agent to be evaluated for multiple sclerosis and Crohn's disease that has demonstrated unique efficacy but has unfortunately been implicated in three cases of progressive multifocal leukoencephalopathy. This review covers the mechanism of action of natalizumab and efficacy for multiple sclerosis, the three cases of natalizumab-associated progressive multifocal leukoencephalopathy, our understanding of progressive multifocal leukoencephalopathy, and the mechanisms that may account for these events. RECENT FINDINGS: Natalizumab, an anti-alpha4-integrin antibody, binds to T-cell surface receptors to prevent migration from the circulation into the brain tissue. Phase II and III trials have been completed and demonstrate previously unseen efficacy in preventing relapses and disease progression. The cases of progressive multifocal leukoencephalopathy, two fatal and one disabling, resulted in the voluntary suspension of natalizumab and bring this entire class of agents into doubt. It is important to determine what led to the development of progressive multifocal leukoencephalopathy in the natalizumab-associated cases and to advance understanding and continue to develop therapies for the treatment of multiple sclerosis. SUMMARY: With ongoing safety evaluations, natalizumab is being reevaluated by the US Food and Drug Administration for possible reapproval and return to the market. If natalizumab is reapproved, challenging questions and issues will remain in treating patients with multiple sclerosis.},

AIMS: To investigate the efficacy of nutritional therapy using three different formulas versus corticosteroids to achieve clinical remission as well as to induce intestinal mucosal healing in active Crohn's disease children. Duration of remission and effect on growth recovery were also assessed. PATIENTS AND METHODS: Clinical, laboratory, endoscopic and histological data of all new diagnosed active Crohn's disease paediatric cases were retrospectively recorded and reviewed. Thirty-seven children (median age 12.1 years) received nutritional therapy (12 polymeric; 13 semi-elemental; 12 elemental diet) and 10 subjects (median age 12.4 years) received corticosteroids. RESULTS: Similar clinical remission rate were observed after 8 weeks of treatment: 86.5% children receiving nutritional therapy versus 90% treated with corticosteroids. Improvement in mucosal inflammation occurred in 26 out of 37 (64.8%) patients on nutritional therapy and in 4 out of 10 (40%) children on steroids (p < 0.05). Finally, seven subjects on nutritional therapy and none on corticosteroids achieved complete mucosal healing (p < 0.005) at the end of the treatment. Nutritional therapy was more effective than corticosteroids in improving nutritional status and linear growth recovery. Compared to corticosteroids, the duration of clinical remission was longer in the nutritional therapy groups without differences among the three different formulas. CONCLUSIONS: In children with active Crohn's disease, nutritional therapy is more effective than corticosteroids to improve intestinal inflammation and to maintain a more sustained clinical remission.},

   abstract = {Antimicrobial peptides are fundamental effector molecules of innate immunity, utilized in host defence by virtually all organisms studied. These gene-encoded peptides have direct antibiotic activity against a wide range of bacteria and other microbes. In humans and other mammals, defensins are a predominant class of such peptides. In the mammalian small intestine, Paneth cells, specialized secretory epithelial cells located at the base of the crypt invaginations lining the intestinal wall, produce defensins and other antibiotic proteins. Recent investigations in murine models provide compelling support for the hypothesis that enteric defensins play a pivotal role in defence from food- and water-borne pathogens in the intestinal lumen. Investigations by others indicate that intestinal commensal bacteria are key factors in the pathogenesis of IBD (inflammatory bowel disease) in genetically susceptible humans. Recent studies provide evidence that reduced expression of Paneth cell defensins may be a key factor in the pathogenesis of ileal Crohn's disease, a subgroup of IBD. Future studies to further define the function and regulation of Paneth cell defensins will enhance our understanding of normal small bowel physiology, and probably contribute to a better understanding of the pathogenesis of inflammatory and infectious diseases of the bowel. Such knowledge may provide new therapeutic targets and strategies.},

Most of the members of the microbiota have not yet been cultured, but nucleic-acid-based methods of detection and enumeration can provide information about the community. This investigation used these methods to obtain information about the bacteria associated with mucosal surfaces in the gut of 20 CD and 15 UC patients. Biopsies were collected from inflamed and non-inflamed sites in the intestines of newly diagnosed, untreated patients. Biopsies were also collected from several intestinal sites of 14 healthy subjects. The bacterial collections associated with the biopsies were analysed by generating PCR/denaturing gradient gel electrophoresis (DGGE) profiles, the preparation of 16S rRNA gene clone libraries, and qualitative PCR to detect specific groups of bacteria. The total numbers of bacteria associated with the biopsies were determined by real-time quantitative PCR. DGGE profiles generated from the terminal ileum and various colonic regions were characteristic of each individual but differed between subjects. DGGE profiles and 16S rRNA gene libraries showed that the bacteria associated with inflamed and non-inflamed tissues did not differ. UC patients had more bacteria associated with biopsies than did CD patients (P<0.01). Statistical analysis of the composition of 16S rRNA gene libraries showed that the bacterial collections in UC and CD patients differed (P<0.05). Unclassified members of the phylum Bacteroidetes were more prevalent in CD than in UC patients. Therefore, the types and numbers of bacteria associated with biopsy samples were distinctly different for UC and CD patients. The observations made in this study should permit targeting of specific bacteriological abnormalities in investigations of the pathogenesis of inflammatory bowel diseases and provide targets for medical interventions.},

RECENT FINDINGS: There have been various biologic agents evaluated in patients with inflammatory bowel disease; that is, Crohn's disease and ulcerative colitis. Thus far only infliximab has been approved by the US Food and Drug Administration as induction and maintenance treatment in patients with active Crohn's disease (moderate-to-severe and/or fistulizing) who are refractory to conventional therapy. Recent data from two large multicenter, multicountry, randomized controlled clinical trials have demonstrated that infliximab is efficacious also for the treatment of ulcerative colitis. Other biologics considered potentially efficacious are still undergoing evaluation in various clinical trials. SUMMARY: The data concerning biologics' associated toxicity in patients with inflammatory bowel disease are the most robust in the case of infliximab. These data are derived from both prospective, randomized clinical trials and from post-marketing experience. In the case of the remaining agents the data concerning safety in inflammatory bowel disease are limited, as these agents were not evaluated in as many trials as infliximab; indeed, some of them included only several patients.},

At present, only one, infliximab (humanized monoclonal anti-tumor necrosis factor-alpha antibody), is approved by the US Food and Drug Administration for induction and maintenance treatment in patients with active moderate to severe and/or fistulizing CD who are refractory to conventional therapy. Two recent trials, Active Ulcerative Colitis Trial (ACT) 1 and ACT 2, observed high efficacy of infliximab in inducting and maintaining clinical remission, mucosal healing, and corticosteroid-sparing effects in patients with moderate to severe UC. A plethora of randomized, double-blind, controlled and open-label, uncontrolled studies on large and small numbers of patients has assessed efficacy and safety of various biologic agents of potential use in treatment of inflammatory bowel disease. With respect to safety of biologic agents used for treatment, the most accurate data are available only in the case of infliximab. This is due to the fact that infliximab was evaluated in many more trials than any other biologic agent. Moreover, postmarketing experience also provides very valuable information about any side effects occurring during treatment with this agent.},

   abstract = {There is currently a growing appreciation for the role of the enteric flora in health and disease. In the past years overwhelming evidence has accumulated for the role of commensal gut bacteria in the inflammatory bowel diseases Crohn's disease and ulcerative colitis. Both entities are mainly located in areas with high bacterial concentrations. Reduction of the enteric bacterial concentration by antibiotics, lavage, or surgical bypass results in a mitigation of symptoms, while experimental colitis models depend on the presence of the bacterial flora and the NOD2/CARD15-mutation results in inefficient clearance of invasive bacteria. Those findings helped to bring the concept of probiotic therapy to the forefront, a therapy that had been known for millennia, but had been disregarded by the scientific world. Probiotics are meanwhile established in the maintenance therapy of ulcerative colitis and chronic recurrent or refractory pouchitis. Promising data exist for the primary prevention of pouchitis. Probiotic research at the intersection of gastroenterology, immunology and microbiology is highly dynamic in both the basic and the clinical field. Further understanding of the complex molecular mechanisms leading to the effectiveness of probiotics will also spur the development of more successful probiotic formulations.},

   abstract = {BACKGROUND & AIMS: Nutritional therapy has been reported to have an almost equivalent efficacy of corticosteroids in achieving clinical remission in active Crohn's disease (CD). However, the effects of both treatments on intestinal mucosal inflammation rarely are reported. In a randomized controlled trial in children with active CD we compared the efficacy of nutritional therapy alone or corticosteroids on clinical variables and intestinal mucosal healing. METHODS: In a prospective, 10-week open-label trial, children with active, naive CD were randomized to orally polymeric formula alone or oral corticosteroids. The clinical activity index and nutritional and activity serum variables were evaluated at week 0 and then every 2 weeks; intestinal mucosal inflammation was assessed through endoscopy and histology at weeks 0 and 10. Primary efficacy outcomes were clinical remission and mucosal healing. RESULTS: Of the 37 children randomized, 19 received polymeric formula and 18 received corticosteroids. At week 10, on an intention-to-treat basis, the proportion of patients achieving clinical remission was comparable between the 2 groups (polymeric formula: 15/19 [79%; 95% confidence interval (CI), 56%-92%]; corticosteroid group: 12/18 [67%; 95% CI, 44%-84%]; P = .4; not significant). On the contrary, the proportion of children showing mucosa healing was significantly higher in the polymeric (14/19; 74%; 95% CI, 51%-89%) than the corticosteroid group (6/18 [33%; 95% CI, 16%-57%]; P < .05). At week 10 both endoscopic and histologic scores significantly decreased only in the polymeric group (P < .001). CONCLUSIONS: In children with active and recently diagnosed CD, a short course of polymeric diet is more effective than corticosteroids in inducing healing of gut inflammatory lesions.},

   abstract = {Carrageenan is a high molecular weight sulfated polygalactan used to improve the texture of commercial food products. Its use increased markedly during the last half century, although carrageenan is known to induce inflammation in rheumatological models and in intestinal models of colitis. We performed studies to determine its direct effects on human intestinal cells, including normal human intestinal epithelial cells from colonic surgeries, the normal intestinal epithelial cell line NCM460, and normal rat ileal epithelial cells. Cells were treated with high molecular weight lambda-carrageenan at a concentration of 1 mug/ml for 1-96 h. IL-8, IL-8 promoter activity, total and nuclear NF-kappaB, IkappaBalpha, phospho-IkappaBalpha, and Bcl10 were assessed by immunohistochemistry, Western blot, ELISA, and cDNA microarray. Increased Bcl10, nuclear and cytoplasmic NF-kappaB, IL-8 promoter activation, and IL-8 secretion were detected following carrageenan exposure. Knockdown of Bcl10 by siRNA markedly reduced the increase in IL-8 that followed carrageenan exposure in the NCM460 cells. These results show, for the first time, that exposure of human intestinal epithelial cells to carrageenan triggers a distinct inflammatory pathway via activation of Bcl10 with NF-kappaB activation and upregulation of IL-8 secretion. Since Bcl10 contains a caspase-recruitment domain, similar to that found in NOD2/CARD15 and associated with genetic predisposition to Crohn's disease, the study findings may represent a link between genetic and environmental etiologies of inflammatory bowel disease. Because of the high use of carrageenan as a food additive in the diet, the findings may have clinical significance.},

We conducted a randomized, placebo-controlled trial of the probiotic Lactobacillus rhamnosus strain GG (LGG) to see if the addition of LGG to standard therapy prolonged remission in children with CD. Concomitant medications allowed in the study included aminosalicylates, 6-mercaptopurine, azathioprine, and low-dose alternate day corticosteroids. Seventy-five children (age range, 5-21 yr) with CD in remission were randomized to either LGG (n=39) or placebo (n=36) and followed for up to 2 years. The median time to relapse was 9.8 months in the LGG group and 11.0 months in the placebo group (P=0.24); 31% (12/39) of patients in the LGG group developed a relapse compared with 6/36 (17%) of the placebo group (P=0.18). The LGG was well tolerated, with a side effect profile comparable with placebo. This study suggests that LGG does not prolong time to relapse in children with CD when given as an adjunct to standard therapy.},

   abstract = {Mycobacterium avium ssp. paratuberculosis (MAP) is the causative agent of the paratuberculosis (Para Tb) in ruminants. In addition, this pathogen has been suspected to be implicated in the pathogenesis of Morbus Crohn disease (MC), causing chronic inflammatory intestine changes of humans. The participation of MAP in this illness is discussed intensively and has very contradictory opinions. On the one hand several times succeeded in proving MAP DNA in changed human tissues as well as, in recent time, the bacteria has been isolated from patient's blood. On the other hand there are many publications which support the opposite opinion. In critical evaluation of already available data, therefore the hypothesis can be formulated that MAP could possibly take part in the MC of humans. The reliable verification of this hypothesis will only be possible, if the diagnostic procedures can be refined upon the substantial deficit concerning the sensitivity and/or specificity of the diagnostic methods. In addition, till now there is lack of optimized statistically case control studies. The conceivable transmission of the bacteria to humans by the direct animal contact has been considered as possible vector, furthermore, MAP has been detected in pasteurised milk and other food of animal origin. The prevalence data, usually estimated by ELISA for milk cattle stock show over 80% prevalence in many counties of the Federal Republic of Germany with an individual case prevalence ranging between 1% and 17% in different stocks. Comparable data are present also from other countries as well as for small ruminants. MAP has been concerned as a global problem, moreover the high spreading rate of MAP in wild animal populations as well as the considerable ability of the bacteria to survive in different stages of the infectious- and contamination-cycle, which might hardly be broken through. Thus it requires intensive research efforts for the development of the methodical diagnostic process as basis for valid epidemiological investigations of animals, humans and food.},

   abstract = {T lymphocyte-mediated pathogenesis is common to a variety of enteropathies, including giardiasis, cryptosporidiosis, bacterial enteritis, celiac's disease, food anaphylaxis, and Crohn's disease. In giardiasis as well as in these other disorders, a diffuse loss of microvillous brush border, combined or not with villus atrophy, is responsible for disaccharidase insufficiencies and malabsorption of electrolytes, nutrients, and water, which ultimately cause diarrheal symptoms. Other mucosal changes may include crypt hyperplasia and increased infiltration of intra-epithelial lymphocytes. Recent studies using models of giardiasis have shed new light on the immune regulation of these abnormalities. Indeed, experiments using an athymic mouse model of infection have found that these epithelial injuries were T cell-dependent. Findings from further research indicate that that the loss of brush border surface area, reduced disaccharidase activities, and increase crypt-villus ratios are mediated by CD8+ T cells, whereas both CD8+ and CD4+ small mesenteric lymph node T cells regulate the influx of intra-epithelial lymphocytes. Future investigations need to characterize the CD8+ T cell signaling cascades that ultimately lead to epithelial injury and malfunction in giardiasis and other malabsorptive disorders of the intestine.},

METHODS: All children referred for initial assessment of possible IBD were eligible. Patients with symptoms or signs (right-lower quadrant mass, perianal disease, or hematochezia) mandating a complete work-up for IBD were excluded. All enrolled patients underwent a clinical, laboratory, radiographic, and endoscopic evaluation including biopsy examinations. The immunoglobulin (Ig)G and IgA ASCA, IgG pANCA, FC, IP, and BWUS were tested in all patients at the initial assessment. RESULTS: A final diagnosis of IBD was made in 27 patients: 17 Crohn disease and 10 ulcerative colitis. Eighteen children had other gastrointestinal diagnoses (8 functional bowel disorders, 5 food allergy-mediated diseases, 4 infectious enterocolitis, 1 familial Mediterranean fever). In patients with simultaneous abnormal values of FC, BWUS, and ASCA/pANCA, the estimated probability of having IBD was 99.47%. Patients with negative results on all tests had a 0.69% of probability of IBD. CONCLUSIONS: The incorporation of noninvasive diagnostic tests into the initial diagnostic approach may avoid unnecessary invasive procedures and facilitate clinical decision-making when the diagnosis of IBD in children is initially uncertain.},

Energy requirements of parenterally fed hospitalized pediatric patients with active CD were measured using indirect calorimetry, to assess whether Food Agriculture Organization (FAO)/World Health Organization (WHO)/United Nations University (UNU) equations provide appropriate estimations of energy requirements in this patient population. METHODS: Twenty hospitalized patients with active CD fed exclusively via parenteral nutrition (PN) were investigated. A chart review and patient interviews were conducted to assess disease duration, location, laboratory parameters, and symptomology associated with CD. Disease severity was quantified using the Pediatric Crohn's Disease Activity Index. Each subject underwent indirect calorimetry, bioelectrical impedance analysis, and anthropometric assessment once the ordered PN met estimated macronutrient requirements of each patient (predicted resting energy expenditure x1.3). Predicted resting energy expenditure (REE) was determined using the FAO/WHO/UNU equations. RESULTS: REE showed a strong correlation with predicted REE (r(2) = .73, p < .01). CONCLUSIONS: Measured REE did not significantly differ from predicted resting energy requirements. This indicates that REE for the parenterally fed pediatric patients with CD can be accurately predicted using the FAO/WHO/UNU equations.},

   abstract = {PURPOSE OF REVIEW: This review will highlight the knowledge gained from studies published in the year 2005 on maintenance treatment after surgery for inflammatory bowel diseases. RECENT FINDINGS: In Crohn's disease the role of smoking in increasing the risk of relapse and recurrence after surgery is confirmed. Ornidazole seems effective in reducing endoscopic recurrence and clinical relapse after surgery. Probiotics do not appear to be effective in preventing endoscopic recurrence and clinical relapse: a controlled placebo trial showed that Lactobacillus johnsonii is not effective in preventing endoscopic recurrence. A retrospective study suggested that enteral nutrition after surgery may reduce the clinical relapse. Pathophysiological studies underlined the value of probiotics in pouchitis. SUMMARY: In Crohn's disease postoperative maintenance treatment is disappointing. Giving up smoking is still the only effective measure. Mesalamine remains the drug that has been widely studied with large trials and meta-analysis. Encouraging results come from small trials on antibiotics. Azathioprine and 6-mercaptopurine must be evaluated in better designed controlled trials. There is no evidence in favour of probiotics as an effective therapy to prevent recurrence. Enteral nutrition after surgery is a candidate new therapy, but further controlled trials are needed. Pathophysiological studies confirm the beneficial role of probiotics in pouchitis.},

   abstract = {The absorption of bisphosphonates from the gut is poor. The question arises whether the absorption of alendronate, and thus its bioavailability, is further altered by the local inflammatory process in patients with Crohn's disease, thereby potentially affecting clinical outcome when used in the treatment of osteoporosis. To address this question, urinary excretion of alendronate was evaluated 3 months and 6 months after start of treatment with oral alendronate at a dose of 10 mg/day in 19 osteoporotic patients with stable Crohn's disease, 12 of whom had an intestinal resection. Biochemical parameters of bone turnover and BMD were also measured at start and at 6 months. Thirteen patients had been previously treated with glucocorticoids and five were currently using them. The average 24-h urinary excretion of alendronate was 0.5-0.6% of the dose administered, a figure comparable to that reported for osteoporotic patients without gut pathology. There was a significant decrease from baseline in urine N-telopeptides of collagen cross-links (NTx)/creatinine (60%) associated with an increase in lumbar spine BMD of already 2% after 6 months of treatment. Our data suggest that in patients with Crohn's disease, alendronate is adequately absorbed from the intestine and retained in the skeleton. This adequacy is confirmed by appropriate suppression of bone resorption and increase in lumbar spine BMD. These data hold significant implications for the clinical management of patients with Crohn's disease and osteoporosis.},

This study presents deterministic (DOpt) and stochastic (SOpt) linear optimization models to determine sustainable land application schedules. The easily solved models minimize the amount of N that is applied while assuring than crop N demands are met as they develop. Temperature effects on N mineralization were included by using the Arrhenius equation to create a temperature-adjusted time series. Uncertainties associated with mineralization rates and the temperature-adjustment (Q10) factor are considered by SOpt. Examples are presented for a summer maize (Zea mays L.) and winter triticale (Triticum aestivum L. x Secale cereale L.) rotation operated by a hypothetical dairy operation in Stanislaus County, California. Monte Carlo simulations were used to test the models. A closed-form solution for estimating the time until steady state is presented and steady-state conditions were reached within 7 yr after applications were initiated. Because of temperature effects, DOpt solutions were 12% greater during the winter and 29% lower during the summer than a reference approach that applied liquid manure at 130% of the crop N demand. Stochastic linear optimization values were 1.7% greater than DOpt values in the summer and 6.2% greater in the winter. Surplus N estimates from Monte Carlo simulations averaged 104 kg ha(-1) for DOpt and 126 ka ha(-1) for SOpt, but SOpt was much less likely to result in crop N deficits. Linear optimization is a viable tool for scheduling organic N applications.},

   abstract = {BACKGROUND & AIMS: Cytokines including tumor necrosis factor alpha (TNFalpha) may create a state of growth hormone (GH) resistance in Crohn's disease. Anabolic effects of GH are mediated via phosphorylation of the signal transducer and activator of transcription (STAT)5b transcription factor. Although GH resistance in other settings has been linked to a defect in janus kinase-STAT signaling, the molecular basis for GH resistance in colitis was not known. We hypothesized that the GH-induced phosphorylation of STAT5b would be impaired in colitis, and that TNFalpha blockade would restore GH signaling. METHODS: Growth, body composition, and molecular regulators of GH signaling were determined in interleukin-10 null mice with chronic colitis and wild-type controls, +/- treatment with an anti-TNFalpha antibody. RESULTS: Interleukin-10 null mice exhibited significant alterations in growth, body composition, and feed efficiency. Liver insulin-like growth factor 1 expression was reduced in colitic mice. This was associated with down-regulation of GH receptor (GHR) expression and impaired GH-dependent STAT5b activation. Down-regulation of GHR expression was associated with reduced nuclear abundance and DNA binding of the GHR gene-promoter transactivator, Sp3. TNFalpha down-regulated GHR abundance and prevented GH-induced tyrosine phosphorylation of STAT5 in rat hepatocytes in culture. TNFalpha neutralization up-regulated liver GHR abundance and restored GH activation of STAT5 and serum insulin-like growth factor 1 levels in colitic mice; this preceded improvements in weight gain and disease activity. CONCLUSIONS: GH resistance in experimental colitis is caused by down-regulation of GHR expression, thereby reducing GH-dependent STAT5 activation. TNFalpha blockade restores liver GH signaling and improves anabolic metabolism in this setting.},

Artificial nutrition is effective to both treat malnutrition when present and induce remission. However, striking advances in anti-inflammatory and immunomodulating therapies (including infliximab) and low compliance to treatment in the first trials have limited its place in the management of adults to drug-resistant patients. Randomized controlled trials show that artificial nutrition is effective in >50% of the cases in this selected population. Significant progress has recently been made to improve the palatability (and thus acceptability) of some enteral solutions, which can be consumed by the oral route and as pharmaconutrition. We reviewed the literature on enteral nutrition in adults with Crohn's disease. We present herein the results of the studies performed with antioxidants, glutamine, short-chain fatty acids, prebiotics, probiotics, low microparticle diets, and a TGFbeta2 enriched formulation.},

   abstract = {The prokaryotic and eukaryotic cells of the colon exist in a highly complex, but harmonious relationship. Disturbances in this remarkable symbiosis can result in the development of inflammatory bowel diseases (IBD). Although the etiology of IBD is not entirely understood, it is known that the chronic inflammation of Crohn's disease, ulcerative colitis and chronic pouchitis are a result of an overly aggressive immune response to the commensal intestinal flora in genetically susceptible hosts. Recent studies have enhanced our ability to understand the interaction between the host and its intestinal microflora and the role the microflora plays in maintaining intestinal homeostasis. As we begin to understand the benefits conferred to the intestine by the microflora, the notion of modifying the composition of the bacterial load to improve human health has arisen. A significant body of research now exists investigating the role of probiotics and prebiotics in ameliorating chronic intestinal inflammation. This article will begin with an overview of the role of the commensal microflora in maintaining mucosal immune homeostasis, and how a dysregulated immune response to the intestinal microflora results in IBD. This will be followed by a summary of the use of probiotics and prebiotics in experimental and human IBD.},

   abstract = {BACKGROUND: Patients with Crohn's disease (CD) are at risk of developing nutritional deficiencies, especially because of restrictive diets. The aim of our study was to assess food intake and the status for vitamins and trace elements in nonselected CD patients in clinical remission. METHODS: A total of 54 consecutive CD patients (28 females, 26 males, 39 +/- 2 years of age [mean +/- SD]) in clinical remission for >3 months underwent body composition, resting energy expenditure, nutrient intake, and plasma concentration assessment, and were compared with 25 healthy controls (16 females, 9 males, 38 +/- 3 years old). RESULTS: According to the nutritional risk index, 37 patients (70%) were not malnourished, 12 were at moderate risk, and 4 were at severe risk for malnutrition. Fat mass was lower in patients in remission compared with controls (P = 0.04). The mean daily energy intake was comparable between patients (2218 +/- 92 kcal/day) and controls (2066 +/- 101 kcal/day), covering their needs. No significant difference was observed for macronutrient intake in comparison with controls; compared to controls, female CD patients had lower intakes of beta-carotene (P < 0.005), vitamins B1 (P < 0.05), B6 (P < 0.01), and C (P < 0.005), and magnesium (P < 0.01). They had significantly higher intakes of zinc (P < 0.01). Male CD patients had lower intakes of beta-carotene and vitamin C (P < 0.05). More than 50% of patients had low plasma concentrations of vitamin C (84%), copper (84%), niacin (77%), and zinc (65%). CONCLUSIONS: In CD patients in remission, macronutrient needs are usually covered by food intake. However, micronutrient deficiencies are frequent and call for specific screening and treatment.},

   abstract = {INTRODUCTION: Inflammatory bowel disease (Crohn's disease and ulcerative colitis) and irritable bowel syndrome are chronic, debilitating gastrointestinal (GI) disorders. There are no known causes of inflammatory bowel disease and/or irritable bowel syndrome. Both of these GI conditions significantly impair quality of life and the ability to complete activities of daily living. Unfortunately, there has been little education and research surrounding the evaluation of effective coping strategies with respect to GI disorders, particularly from the perspective of those diagnosed. As such, exploring the strategies of individuals with GI disorders would provide information concerning coping strategies from the perspective of those afflicted. PURPOSE: The overall objective of this research was to explore the lived experience of women who had been diagnosed with inflammatory bowel disease and/or irritable bowel syndrome. This article specifically explores the relationship between food and irritable bowel syndrome and/or inflammatory bowel disease. METHODS: Eight females, diagnosed with inflammatory bowel disease and/or irritable bowel syndrome, were recruited via on-campus posters from a university in southern Ontario, Canada. Qualitative information was collected in the form of background questionnaires, e-mail interviews, and face-to-face interviews, which were subsequently analyzed for trends. RESULTS: Every woman reported that one of the most significant means by which to cope with their condition centered around food consumption or controlling their food consumption. Subjects identified the importance of determining their "trigger foods," selecting healthy food choices, the impact of stress, and problems associated with food and travel. CONCLUSIONS: This research, predicated on the narratives of women diagnosed with GI disorders, substantiates the profound effect that food has on conditions of the GI tract. All of the women identified their relationship with food as a dynamic learning process, one that they thought would be a lifelong struggle. The implications for community health nurses in assisting individuals with GI disorders are discussed.},

   abstract = {Probiotics are live microbial organisms that are administrated as supplements or in foods to benefit the host. It is the recommendation that they may be helpful in the prevention and treatment of acute diarrhea in adults and children, the prevention of antibiotic-associated diarrhea in adults and children, and the maintenance of remission and prevention of pouchitis. Although early results indicate that probiotics may also be useful in immunologic modulation to prevent atopy, treatment of radiation intestinal disease, vaginosis, ulcerative colitis, and the irritable bowel syndrome, the studies available are not sufficient to say they are definitely helpful. Even fewer data are available to recommend probiotics for the treatment of H pylori and Crohn disease and for the prevention of cardiovascular risk factors or other degenerative diseases. Clearly, larger and better-designed studies of probiotics are necessary, including comparative and dose-ranging trials.},

A case-control study was accordingly devised. The mean age at first fridge was 5.6 years amongst 88 patients with Crohn's disease, 5.5 years in 88 patients with ulcerative colitis (UC) and 7.6 years in 88 controls, but a majority of individuals had always been exposed to refrigerated food. Differences were more striking in subjects aged above the median (10.3, 10.9 and 15.0 years for Crohn's disease, UC and controls, respectively).

   abstract = {The newborn infant leaves a germ-free intrauterine environment to enter a contaminated extrauterine world and must have adequate intestinal defences to prevent the expression of clinical gastrointestinal disease states. Although the intestinal mucosal immune system is fully developed after a full-term birth, the actual protective function of the gut requires the microbial stimulation of initial bacterial colonization. Breast milk contains prebiotic oligosaccharides, like inulin-type fructans, which are not digested in the small intestine but enter the colon as intact large carbohydrates that are then fermented by the resident bacteria to produce SCFA. The nature of this fermentation and the consequent pH of the intestinal contents dictate proliferation of specific resident bacteria. For example, breast milk-fed infants with prebiotics present in breast milk produce an increased proliferation of bifidobacteria and lactobacilli (probiotics), whereas formula-fed infants produce more enterococci and enterobacteria. Probiotics, stimulated by prebiotic fermentation, are important to the development and sustainment of intestinal defences. For example, probiotics can stimulate the synthesis and secretion of polymeric IgA, the antibody that coats and protects mucosal surfaces against harmful bacterial invasion. In addition, appropriate colonization with probiotics helps to produce a balanced T helper cell response (Th1=Th2=Th3/Tr1) and prevent an imbalance (Th1>Th2 or Th2>Th1) contributing in part to clinical disease (Th2 imbalance contributes to atopic disease and Th1 imbalance contributes to Crohn's disease and Helicobacter pylori-induced gastritis). Furthermore, a series of pattern recognition receptors, toll-like receptors on gut lymphoid and epithelial cells that interact with bacterial molecular patterns (e.g. endotoxin (lipopolysaccharide), flagellin, etc.), help modulate intestinal innate immunity and an appropriate adaptive immune response. Animal and clinical studies have shown that inulin-type fructans will stimulate an increase in probiotics (commensal bacteria) and these bacteria have been shown to modulate the development and persistence of appropriate mucosal immune responses. However, additional studies are needed to show that prebiotics can directly or indirectly stimulate intestinal host defences. If this can be demonstrated, then prebiotics can be used as a dietary supplement to stimulate a balanced and an appropriately effective mucosal immune system in newborns and infants.},

   abstract = {The chronic idiopathic inflammatory bowel diseases (IBDs), namely Crohn's disease and ulcerative colitis, appear to be derived from an inappropriate reaction towards a luminal agent, most probably driven by the intestinal microflora, which upregulates the synthesis and release of different pro-inflammatory mediators, thus contributing to tissue damage that characterizes these intestinal conditions. Several studies have reported that IBD is associated with impairment in short-chain fatty acid (SCFA) production, mainly acetate, propionate, and butyrate. They are produced in the large bowel by anaerobic bacterial fermentation of undigested dietary carbohydrates and fiber polysaccharides, with butyrate being considered as the major fuel source for colonocytes. These SCFAs have been proposed to play a key role in the maintenance of colonic homeostasis. Therefore, it is reasonable to consider therapeutic approaches that increase colonic SCFA production, as it can be achieved by administration of dietary fiber to IBD patients. Unfortunately, there is quite limited documentation of efficacy of dietary fiber in properly designed trials. This review discusses the rationale, available evidence for the use of dietary fiber and its mechanisms of action in the treatment and prevention of IBDs.},

   abstract = {Mycobacterium avium subsp. paratuberculosis (MAP) is the causative agent of Johne's disease in cattle and it has been suggested that this organism may be associated with Crohn's disease in humans. Cows at the advanced stage of the disease shed this organism into both their milk and feces. The objective of this study was to develop a more efficient procedure for isolating MAP from bulk tank raw milk. Bulk tank raw milk (50 mL) samples 3 to 13 d old after collection without spiking were investigated to evaluate the effects of milk age on the efficacy of decontamination. Milk samples, 2 to 3 d old, were seeded with MAP at levels of 50 to 200 colony forming units/mL in experiments involving factorial design to evaluate 1) the effects of different decontaminating reagents and decontamination procedures on recovery of MAP, and 2) partition MAP in milk fractions after centrifugation in raw milk. Decontamination in 20 mL of 0.75% hexadecylpyridinium chloride (HPC) at room temperature (22 degrees C) for 2 to 5 h, with shaking, at intervals was found to be the most effective procedure for decontaminating milk 2 to 3 d old. Prolonged exposure to decontaminants, additional incubations in antibiotics, or at higher temperature (37 degrees C) significantly reduced recovery of live MAP. Enhanced growth of microbial contaminants was noticed in samples decontaminated overnight at room temperature compared to those decontaminated for 2 to 5 h. Decontamination of 6 d old milk samples required extra incubation in antibiotic brew. Decontamination of milk samples that are 8 d and older was not effective in removing microbial contaminants. The MAP cells preferentially partitioned into the cream fraction after centrifugation, and combining the milk cream and pellet fractions enhanced recovery of MAP. A recovery rate of 16.6% was estimated with the use of our improved protocol.},

   abstract = {Undigested carbohydrates reaching the colon can act as competitors for epithelial bacterial receptors, making it difficult for noncommensal bacteria to adhere to them. On the contrary, fermentation of these carbohydrates by anaerobic flora produces - among other substrates - butyrate that is involved in numerous important metabolic processes. These include the provision of energy to the colonocytes, the enhancement of sodium and water absorption and the synthesis of mucus and cell membranes. In addition, butyrate inhibits the nuclear translocation of the transcription factor NFkappaB, which exerts a potent anti-inflammatory activity. Clinical experience with probiotics in inflammatory bowel disease (IBD) is controversial. Whereas some probiotic preparations appear to be useful in ulcerative colitis (UC) and pouchitis, most attempts to use probiotics for treating or preventing recurrence in Crohn's disease have failed. It should be pointed out that - unlike in the small bowel - the colon and ileal pouches are well-established microbiological ecosystems with increasing amounts of a wide variety of bacterial strains. These bacterial strains have a high degree of metabolic interaction with luminal nutrients and a greater probability of developing dysbiosis. With this in mind, the rationale for using pre- and probiotics appears to be stronger for colonic IBD (UC or Crohn's colitis) and pouchitis than for IBD mostly involving the small bowel.},

IL-6 is locally upregulated in inflammatory bowel disease patients and in murine models of experimental colitis. Treatment with anti-IL-6 receptor antibody ameliorates intestinal inflammation. OBJECTIVE: It was the aim of this study to investigate the role of genetic IL-6 deficiency in trinitrobenzene sulfonic acid (TNBS)-mediated colitis, an experimental model inflammation that shares several features with Crohn's disease in humans. METHODS: Acute colitis was induced in wild-type and IL-6-deficient (Il-6(-/-)) mice by intracolonic administration of TNBS. Forty-eight hours after treatment, the local and systemic features of inflammation, i.e. food intake, weight loss, histological markers of colitis, cytokine expression by real-time PCR, food intake and body weight changes, were assessed. RESULTS: In wild-type mice, TNBS administration increased both IL-6 serum levels and local expression of IL-6 by 36 and 9 fold, respectively, compared with control, vehicle-injected mice. Compared with the wild-type mice, the Il-6(-/-) mice had significantly reduced intestinal inflammation as evidenced by epithelial damage, neutrophil infiltration, colon thickness and proinflammatory cytokine expression, following treatment with TNBS. Moreover, baseline levels of the antiinflammatory cytokines IL-10 and tumor growth factor-beta were significantly elevated in Il-6(-/-)compared with the wild-type mice. CONCLUSIONS: Our results demonstrate that Il-6(-/-)are partially protected from the development of TNBS-induced acute experimental colitis, most likely via their significantly elevated baseline levels of antiinflammatory cytokines.},

   abstract = {Susceptibility to the development of Crohn's disease involves a combination of genetic and environmental factors. The association of Crohn's disease with westernization has implicated lifestyle factors in pathogenesis. While diet is a likely candidate, evidence for specific changes in dietary habits and/or intake has been lacking. A new hypothesis is proposed, by which excessive delivery of highly fermentable but poorly absorbed short-chain carbohydrates and polyols (designated FODMAPs--Fermentable Oligo-, Di- and Mono-saccharides And Polyols) to the distal small intestinal and colonic lumen is a dietary factor underlying susceptibility to Crohn's disease. The subsequent rapid fermentation of FODMAPs in the distal small and proximal large intestine induces conditions in the bowel that lead to increased intestinal permeability, a predisposing factor to the development of Crohn's disease. Evidence supporting this hypothesis includes the increasing intake of FODMAPs in western societies, the association of increased intake of sugars in the development of Crohn's disease, and the previously documented effects of the ingestion of excessive FODMAPs on the bowel. This hypothesis provides potential for the design of preventive strategies and raises concern about current enthusiasm for putative health-promoting effects of FODMAPs. One of the greatest challenges in defining the pathogenesis of Crohn's disease is to identify predisposing environmental factors. Such an achievement might lead to the development of preventive strategies for, and the definition of, possible target for changing the natural history of this serious disease. The present paper describes a new hypothesis for one such environmental factor.},

AIM: To compare bone biomarkers in inflammatory bowel disease patients (Crohn's disease: n = 68, and ulcerative colitis: n = 32, separately) with age- and sex-matched healthy controls. SUBJECTS: Patients and controls were recruited from Cork University Hospital and Cork City area, respectively. RESULTS: Relative to that in their respective controls, Crohn's disease (n = 47) and ulcerative colitis (n = 26) patients (i.e. excluding supplement users) had significantly (P < 0.05-0.001) higher serum undercarboxylated osteocalcin (by 27% and 63%, respectively) and bone-specific alkaline phosphatase (by 15% and 21%, respectively) and urinary Type I collagen cross-linked N-telopeptides concentrations (by 87% and 112%, respectively). Relative to that in their respective controls, Crohn's disease and ulcerative colitis patients had significantly (P < 0.01) lower serum total osteocalcin (by 20% and 42%, respectively) and 25-hydroxyvitamin D (by 37% and 42%, respectively), while serum parathyroid hormone levels were similar. In the combined patient group (n = 100), undercarboxylated osteocalcin was positively associated with bone markers. CONCLUSIONS: Both Crohn's disease and ulcerative colitis patients have altered bone turnover relative to that in healthy controls.},

DESIGN: A cross-sectional observational study. SETTING: Cork City, Ireland (52 degrees N). SUBJECTS: Crohn's Disease patients (n=58; mean age 38.1 years) were recruited from Cork University Hospital. RESULTS: Fifty and nineteen percent of Irish CD patients were vitamin D deficient (defined by serum 25 hydroxyvitamin (OH) D levels <50 nmol/l) during winter and summer, respectively. Multiple regression analysis showed that summer-time serum 25 (OH) D levels were positively associated with use of vitamin D supplements (P=0.033) and negatively associated with smoking (P=0.006) and being male (P=0.063). During winter-time, use of vitamin D supplements (P=0.041) and sun habits (P=0.066) were positively associated, whereas small intestinal involvement (P=0.005) and body mass index (BMI) (P=0.083) were negatively associated with serum 25 (OH) D levels. There was no significant association between other non-pathophysiologic (age, dietary calcium or vitamin D) or pathophysiologic factors (steroid use, resection), and serum 25 (OH) D levels, at either season. Approximately 41 and 60% of the total variation in summer- and winter-time serum 25 (OH) D, respectively, was explained by this model. CONCLUSION: A high proportion of Irish CD patents had some level of vitamin D deficiency (<50 nmol/l) during late-wintertime. Use of regular low-dose supplemental vitamin D, particularly by patients with small intestinal involvement, cessation of smoking and adequate, but responsible, exposure to summer sunlight as well as maintaining BMI in the normal range could help maintain adequate vitamin D levels during wintertime.},

Antibiotics are effective in treating septic complications of Crohn's disease (CD) but their use as a primary therapy is more controversial, although this approach is frequently and successfully adopted in clinical practice. There is evidence that probiotic therapy may be effective in the prevention and treatment of mild to moderate UC. In contrast, a lack of successful study data at present precludes the widespread use of probiotics in the treatment of CD. Both antibiotics and probiotics appear to play a beneficial role in the treatment and prevention of pouchitis and further trials are warranted to fully quantify their clinical efficacy.},

   abstract = {Exclusive feeding of defined formula diets has been used successfully as an alternative to corticosteroid treatment of active Crohn's disease, but the mechanism of efficacy remains conjectural. Recognition that polymorphisms in the NOD2/CARD15 gene confer susceptibility to Crohn's disease has increased appreciation of the interactions between the innate immune system and enteric bacteria, which lead to chronic intestinal inflammation. The 2 major goals of this workshop are: first, in light of current understanding of pathogenesis, to examine possible mechanisms of action of enteral nutrition as primary therapy; and second, to make evidence-based recommendations concerning its use in the new era of biologic therapies, when mucosal healing has become a realistic goal. Factors influencing efficacy, including duration, location of intestinal inflammation, and formula composition require consideration.},

   abstract = {Variants of the SLC22A4 gene are associated with susceptibility to rheumatoid arthritis and Crohn's disease. SLC22A4 codes for an integral membrane protein, OCTN1, that has been presumed to carry organic cations like tetraethylammonium across the plasma membrane. Here, we show that the key substrate of this transporter is in fact ergothioneine (ET). Human OCTN1 was expressed in 293 cells. A substrate lead, stachydrine (alias proline betaine), was identified by liquid chromatography MS difference shading, a new substrate search strategy. Analysis of transport efficiency of stachydrine-related solutes, affinity, and Na+ dependence indicates that the physiological substrate is ET. Efficiency of transport of ET was as high as 195 microl per min per mg of protein. By contrast, the carnitine transporter OCTN2 from rat did not transport ET at all. Because ET is transported >100 times more efficiently than tetraethylammonium and carnitine, we propose the functional name ETT (ET transporter) instead of OCTN1. ET, all of which is absorbed from food, is an intracellular antioxidant with metal ion affinity. Its particular purpose is unresolved. Cells with expression of ETT accumulate ET to high levels and avidly retain it. By contrast, cells lacking ETT do not accumulate ET, because their plasma membrane is virtually impermeable for this compound. The real-time PCR expression profile of human ETT, with strong expression in CD71+ cells, is consistent with a pivotal function of ET in erythrocytes. Moreover, prominent expression of ETT in monocytes and SLC22A4 polymorphism associations suggest a protective role of ET in chronic inflammatory disorders.},

Probiotics, mostly lactic acid bacteria such as Lactobacilli and Bifidobacteria, but also the yeast Saccharomyces boulardii, have been tried in many double-blinded, randomized, placebo-controlled studies, and several well-conducted meta-analyses are now available. There is some evidence of efficacy in the prevention of community-acquired and nosocomial diarrhea. More solid evidence of efficacy is found in the treatment of sporadic, infectious diarrhea, where several probiotics, and especially Lactobacillus GG, have been found capable of reducing by approximately 1 day the duration of diarrhea, shorten the initial phase of watery stools, and reducing hospital stay in developed countries. The effect is best documented in viral diarrheas. Although there are valid conceptual premises for probiotics to be helpful in inflammatory bowel diseases, only 1 trial has been published in children, showing Lactobacillus GG not to be superior to placebo in maintaining remission of Crohn disease. All considered, more research is needed for a better understanding of the role of probiotics in gastrointestinal diseases of children, addressing issues such as pharmacokinetics, mechanism of action, and role of specific probiotics, alone or in combination, in different disorders.},

   abstract = {A large and diverse variety of bacteria have evolved and adapted to live in the human intestinal habitat in a symbiotic arrangement that influences both physiology and pathology in the host. Symbiosis between host and flora can be optimised by prebiotics. Inulin-type fructans have been shown to improve the metabolic functions of the commensal flora. Clinical and experimental data suggest that they also improve the gut mucosal barrier. Furthermore, modulation of the trophic functions of the flora by these prebiotics could help in the prevention of inflammatory bowel diseases. The anti-inflammatory effects of inulin or oligofructose have been assessed in the rat model of distal colitis induced by dextran sodium sulphate, which histologically resembles human ulcerative colitis, and in the trinitrobenzene sulphonic acid model that resembles human Crohn's disease. Both inulin and oligofructose stimulate colonic production of SCFA and favour the growth of indigenous lactobacilli and/or bifidobacteria. These effects are associated with reduced mucosal inflammation and decreased mucosal lesion scores. Inulin has also been tested in a placebo-controlled clinical trial in patients with relapsing pouchitis. Treatment reduced endoscopic and histological parameters of inflammation of the pouch mucosa. Inulin and oligofructose may offer an opportunity to prevent chronic inflammatory intestinal disorders, and this potential should be tested in further clinical studies.},

   abstract = {In industrialized countries the incidence of diseases caused by immune dysregulation has risen. Epidemiologic studies initially suggested this was connected to a reduction in the incidence of infectious diseases; however, an association with defects in immunoregulation is now being recognized. Effector T(H)1 and T(H)2 cells are controlled by specialized subsets of regulatory T cells. Some pathogens can induce regulatory cells to evade immune elimination, but regulatory pathways are homeostatic and mainly triggered by harmless microorganisms. Helminths, saprophytic mycobacteria, bifidobacteria and lactobacilli, which induce immunoregulatory mechanisms in the host, ameliorate aberrant immune responses in the setting of allergy and inflammatory bowel disease. These organisms cause little, if any, harm, and have been part of human microecology for millennia; however, they are now less frequent or even absent in the human environment of westernized societies. Deficient exposure to these 'old friends' might explain the increase in immunodysregulatory disorders. The use of probiotics, prebiotics, helminths or microbe-derived immunoregulatory vaccines might, therefore, become a valuable approach to disease prevention.},

   abstract = {OBJECTIVE: Gastrointestinal (GI) damage caused by methotrexate (MTX) results in mucosal injury, bacterial invasion, and activation of an immune system that is reduced in function. Diets enriched with glutamine, short chain fatty acids (SCFAs), and transforming growth factor (TGF)-beta have demonstrated decreased infection, weight loss, and GI damage in Crohn disease. We, therefore, sought to study the cytoprotective effects of a diet enriched in glutamine, TGF-beta, and SFCAs (Modulen) in Fischer 344 rats exposed to MTX. METHODS: Rats were divided into five groups: two receiving normal saline and three receiving MTX and fed either normal chow, Modulen supplemented chow starting with the first MTX dose, or Modulen supplemented chow beginning 3 days before MTX injection. Rats were weighed daily. On day 5, albumin and bicarbonate levels were drawn, and rats were killed for examination of their intestinal mucosa by a pathologist unaware of groupings. RESULTS: Rats pretreated with Modulen supplemented chow maintained weight (2.6 vs, 12.3 g weight loss), albumin levels (3.13 vs, 2.43 mg/dL), and bicarbonate levels (23.8 vs. 18.1 mg/dL) as compared with rats fed normal chow throughout MTX treatment (P < 0.05). Pretreatment with Modulen also protected against crypt cell loss, villus atrophy, crypt abscesses, crypt/villus ratio, and overall histologic damage (P < 0.05). CONCLUSION: When administered before and during MTX treatment, Modulen supplementation provided statistically significant protection against weight loss, hypoalbuminemia, acidosis, and GI damage in a rat model. Future animal research of Modulen's protective effects with other chemotherapeutic agents is needed before human trials.},

Retail cheese may represent a significant source of human exposure to MAP and the aim of this study was to assess MAP status in clinically healthy sheep and goats in Greece, comparing techniques routinely used in the positive diagnosis of the disease. From a total of 30 flocks, 632 sheep and goats had faecal, serum, and whole-blood samples examined by culture, complement fixation test (CFT), and polymerase chain reaction (PCR) targeted at IS900, IS1245, and IS6110. PCR produced positive results in 21% of the animals tested, with 5.6%, 3.9%, and 11.5% being identified as MAP, Mycobacterium avium subsp. avium, and Mycobacterium tuberculosis complex, respectively. CFT produced positive and suspicious results in 4.4% and 14.4% of the cases. Faecal cultures were negative in all but a single case that was identified as restriction fragment length polymorphism (RFLP)-type BC1. Agreement between results obtained by PCR and CFT was poor with isolated cases although an assessment of the MAP positive tests produced similar results for both methods. The findings indicate the need for additional measures of control, although the costs may be substantial if public health protection justifies elimination of MAP from livestock.},

The aim of this study was to determine the in vitro inhibitory effects of the probiotic strain, Lactobacillus casei DN-114 001, on adhesion to and invasion of human intestinal epithelial cells by adherent-invasive E. coli isolated from Crohn's disease patients. The experiments were performed with undifferentiated Intestine-407 cells and with undifferentiated or differentiated Caco-2 intestinal epithelial cells. Bacterial adhesion to and invasion of intestinal epithelial cells were assessed by counting CFU. The inhibitory effects of L. casei were determined after coincubation with adherent-invasive E. coli or after preincubation of intestinal cells with L. casei prior to infection with adherent-invasive E. coli. Inhibitory effects of L. casei on adherent-invasive E. coli adhesion to differentiated and undifferentiated intestinal epithelial cells reached 75% to 84% in coincubation and 43% to 62% in preincubation experiments, according to the cell lines used. Addition of L. casei culture supernatant to the incubation medium increased L. casei adhesion to intestinal epithelial cells and enhanced the inhibitory effects of L. casei. The inhibitory effects on E. coli invasion paralleled those on adhesion. This effect was not due to a bactericidal effect on adherent-invasive E. coli or to a cytotoxic effect on epithelial intestinal cells. As Lactobacillus casei DN-114 001 strongly inhibits interaction of adherent-invasive E. coli with intestinal epithelial cells, this finding suggests that the probiotic strain could be of therapeutic value in Crohn's disease.},

Two strongly associated cofactors have been identified: the presence of HLA-DQ2 or HLA-DQ8 in the host and specific antigenic peptides in the diet that are present in wheat, rye, and barley. Most patients have complete remission after dietary elimination of these foods. Crohn's disease is characterized by chronic, relapsing, recurrent, focal, transmural inflammation of the gastrointestinal tract that can lead to multiple serious problems requiring chronic medical and surgical therapy. Crohn's disease is associated with multiple genetic mutations, at least one of which has been clearly implicated in innate immunity. Multiple lines of evidence suggest that the disease involves abnormal immune responses to gut microbial flora.},

Studies have suggested that long term nutritional supplementation with a liquid formula (partial enteral nutrition (PEN)) may also suppress inflammation and prevent relapse. The aim of this study was to compare PEN with conventional TEN in active Crohn's disease. PATIENTS AND METHODS: Fifty children with a paediatric Crohn's disease activity index (PCDAI)>20 were randomly assigned to receive 50% (PEN) or 100% (TEN) of their energy requirement as elemental formula for six weeks. The PEN group was encouraged to eat an unrestricted diet while those receiving TEN were not allowed to eat. The primary outcome was achievement of remission (PCDAI<10). Secondary analyses of changes in erythrocyte sedimentation rate (ESR), C reactive protein, albumin, and platelets were performed to look for evidence of anti-inflammatory effects. RESULTS: Remission rate with PEN was lower than with TEN (15% v 42%; p=0.035). Although PCDAI fell in both groups (p=0.001 for both), the reduction was greater with TEN (p=0.005). Moreover, the fall in PCDAI with PEN was due to symptomatic and nutritional benefits. With both treatments there were significant improvements in relation to abdominal pain, "sense of wellbeing", and nutritional status. However, only TEN led to a reduction in diarrhoea (p=0.02), an increase in haemoglobin and albumin, and a fall in platelets and ESR. CONCLUSIONS: TEN suppresses inflammation in active Crohn's disease but PEN does not. This suggests that long term nutritional supplementation, although beneficial to some patients, is unlikely to suppress inflammation and so prevent disease relapse.},

   abstract = {BACKGROUND: Previous studies have suggested an increasing use of complementary and alternative medicine (CAM) in patients with inflammatory bowel disease (IBD). The aim of our study was to evaluate the use of CAM in German patients with IBD. METHODS: A questionnaire was offered to IBD patients participating in patient workshops which were organized by a self-help association, the German Crohn's and Colitis Association. The self-administered questionnaire included demographic and disease-related data as well as items analysing the extent of CAM use and satisfaction with CAM treatment. Seven commonly used CAM methods were predetermined on the questionnaire. RESULTS: 413 questionnaires were completed and included in the analysis (n = 153 male, n = 260 female; n = 246 Crohn's disease, n = 164 ulcerative colitis). 52 % of the patients reported CAM use in the present or past. In detail, homeopathy (55%), probiotics (43%), classical naturopathy (38%), Boswellia serrata extracts (36%) and acupuncture/Traditional Chinese Medicine (TCM) (33%) were the most frequently used CAM methods. Patients using probiotics, acupuncture and Boswellia serrata extracts (incense) reported more positive therapeutic effects than others. Within the statistical analysis no significant predictors for CAM use were found. 77% of the patients felt insufficiently informed about CAM. CONCLUSION: The use of CAM in IBD patients is very common in Germany, although a large proportion of patients felt that information about CAM is not sufficient. However, to provide an evidence-based approach more research in this field is desperately needed. Therefore, physicians should increasingly inform IBD patients about benefits and limitations of CAM treatment.},

   abstract = {Arthralgias and spondyloarthropathies of the peripheral and axial joints are common in inflammatory bowel disease. Evidence for a strong association between these clinical manifestations and diseases of the joints has been provided by several clinical and epidemiological studies. Immunological studies have shown the presence of shared inflammatory cells both in the gut and the synovium in spondyloarthropathies. Genetic factors play a crucial role in the pathogenesis of spondyloarthropathies and inflammatory bowel disease. The role of the ubiquitous bacterial flora and pathogenic microorganisms present in the intestinal lumen may induce these joint diseases in patients with inflammatory bowel disease. In this review we will focus on the pathogenesis of spondyloarthropathies and arthralgia in patients suffering from inflammatory bowel disease. Based on preliminary clinical observations in patients with arthralgia and IBD, we put forward the hypothesis that probiotics may be helpful in the management of common extraintestinal manifestations such as arthralgia in patients with ulcerative colitis and Crohn's disease.},

   abstract = {Arthralgia is a common extraintestinal manifestation of inflammatory bowel disease (IBD). Alterations of the immunologic regulation in the gut may contribute to the pathogenesis of arthralgia. Probiotics (VSL#3) have proven effective in the treatment of pouchitis in patients with ileal pouch anal anastomosis after panproctocolectomy for ulcerative colitis both in maintaining remission and in preventing a flare-up without side effects. The aim of this study was to determine the safety and efficacy of VSL#3 in patients with quiescent IBD who suffered from arthralgia for more than two weeks. An open-label trial was conducted using VSL#3. Pre- and post-treatment joint pain intensity were measured on the Ritchie Articular Index and visual analog scale. Disease activity of the bowel was assessed by the Truelove-Witts and the Harvey-Bradshaw scores. Sixteen of 29 patients completed the trial; in 10 of the 16 patients a statistically significant improvement was documented by the Ritchie Articular Index. No one of the patients had a relapse of intestinal disease while on probiotics. These preliminary results suggest that the probiotic mixture VSL#3 may be an alternative treatment for arthralgia in patients with IBD without inducing exacerbation of the disease. Because probiotics may be effective in the treatment of IBD as well, our results suggest that patients with active disease and arthralgia may also derive benefit from this treatment. Proper randomized controlled studies are indicated.},

   abstract = {Lactobacillus salivarius subsp. salivarius UCC118 is a probiotic bacterium that was originally isolated from human intestinal tissues and was subsequently shown in a pilot study to alleviate symptoms associated with mild-moderate Crohn's disease. Strain UCC118 can adhere to animal and human intestinal tissue, and to both healthy and inflamed ulcerative colitis mucosa, irrespective of location in the gut. In this study, an enzymatic technique has been combined with proteomic analysis to correlate bacterial growth phase with the presence of factors present in the cell wall of the bacterium. Using PAGE electrophoresis, it was determined that progression from lag to log to stationary growth phases in vitro correlated with increasing prominence of an 84kD protein associated with in vitro adherence ability. Isolated proteins from the 84kD band region were further separated by two-dimensional electrophoresis, resolving this band into 20 individual protein spots at differing isoelectric points. The protein moieties were excised, trypsin digested and subjected to tandem mass spectrometry. The observed proteins are analogous to those reported to be associated with the Listeria monocytogenes cell-wall proteome, and include DnaK, Ef-Ts and pyruvate kinase. These data suggest that at least some of the beneficial attributes of probiotic lactobacilli, and in particular this strain, may be due to nonpathogenic mimicry of pathogens and potentially be mediated through a form of attenuated virulence.},

   abstract = {Although Crohn's disease is associated with various digestive symptoms, there have been few reports on gastric motility. In this study, we conducted a study of gastric motility in Crohn's disease using 20 healthy subjects (N group) and 15 patients with Crohn's disease (C group) by electrogastrography (EGG) using a Nipro electrogastrograph. An EGG was recorded for 30 minutes in a fasting state and after ingestion of 300 ml of a liquid meal. As an index of gastric emptying, the rate of change in the cross-sectional area of the gastric antrum was measured 1 and 15 minutes after ingestion of the liquid meal by external ultrasonography. In an EGG frequency analysis, waveforms with a peak of 3 cycles/minute (cpm) were noted in the N group, and the peak amplitude increased significantly after the ingestion of food. In the C group, division of the normal-gastria component was noted after the ingestion of food in 5 patients (33.3%). In a comparison of the peak amplitudes of fasting brady-gastria, normal-gastria, and tachy-gastria between the N and C groups, the peak amplitude was significantly increased in normal-gastria in the N group, and in brady-gastria and tachy-gastria in the C group. In a comparison of the rates of food ingestion-induced changes in the peak amplitudes for brady-gastria, normal-gastria, and tachy-gastria between the N and C groups, the peak amplitudes were significantly increased in normal-gastria in the N group, but not in the C group. In the case of gastric emptying investigated by external ultrasonography, the rate of food ingestion-induced change in the cross-sectional antrum area was significantly lower in the C group (50.5+/-9.2%) than in the N group (65.0+/-8.5%). For gastrointestinal motility, a 3 cpm normal-gastria represents efficient gastric motility. In the C group, the peak amplitudes of brady-gastria and tachy-gastria were significantly increased, but were low in normal-gastria in the fasting EGG, postprandial division of the normal-gastria component was noted, and the rate of food ingestion-induced increase in the normal-gastria peak amplitude was significantly lower than that in the N group, suggesting that patients with Crohn's disease have a functional abnormality in, not only the small and large intestine, but also the stomach.},

   abstract = {A major advance in understanding diverticular disease occurred decades ago with the epidemiologic association between fiber intake and the development of diverticular disease. This association has been well documented with investigations into the emergence of diverticular disease in underdeveloped countries where the disease had been virtually unknown before the adoption of a westernized diet, low in fiber. The high frequency of right-sided diverticular disease in Asian countries diverges from what is seen in the West. The physiologic effects of insoluble fiber has been well examined as well, increasing bulk and decreasing transit time, with a deficiency contributing to the high pressures implicated in the physiology which leads to diverticular disease. However, at most, 10% to 25% of individuals with diverticular disease will develop diverticulitis. Risk factors for symptomatic diverticular have been increasingly described in recent years with obesity and red meat intake being of particular importance, in addition to age. However, the known factors poorly identify those at increased risk and the predisposing pathophysiology is incompletely understood as well. Insoluble fiber, but not soluble fiber, has been viewed as the principal component which has been deficient in western diets and is the culprit which leads to the establishment of diverticular disease and in turn, diverticulitis. Soluble fiber and its effect on the intestinal flora is proposed as having significant influence on the development of diverticulitis. This understanding, if demonstrated, would have important implications for the primary and secondary prevention of diverticulitis.},

Uncontrolled reactions of T-cells and proinflammatoric cytokines are the common denominator of all factors contributing to pathogenesis. The detection of NOD2 gene mutation in about 25% of patients with Crohn's disease was an important step towards an understanding of the molecular background of the disease. The NOD2 proteins functions as an intracellular sensor of bacterial cell membrane constituents and is a crucial part of the innate immune system. In Crohn's disease, the secretion of defensins, naturally occurring antimicrobial peptides, is disturbed. There is evidence that several pathways involved in the reaction of the innate immune system may be disturbed in CED, ultimately leading to an uncontrolled activity of the adaptive immune system.},

   abstract = {The decision regarding prophylactic treatment after surgery in Crohn's disease (CD) requires a good estimation of the risk of recurrence. It is also important to consider the consequences of recurrence for the patient, and the risks and benefits of treatment, bearing in mind that it will be given over a long period. Several drugs have been tried to decrease the risk of recurrence. Corticosteroids and budesonide have proved to be ineffective. Mesalazine has significant efficacy in some, but not all trials, and a meta-analysis has established that it decreases the absolute risk by 10-15% after 1-2 years. Mercaptopurine seemed to be effective in a recent study. Metronidazole and ornidazole have significant efficacy, but cannot be tolerated for long periods. Probiotics represent a new approach, but evidence for their efficacy in CD is still lacking. In the past, the strategy was to give no treatment until clinical recurrence. Another approach is to give no treatment, and then to treat the patient according to severity of endoscopic recurrence. Alternative strategies include treating all patients with mesalazine until either severe endoscopic or clinical recurrence occurs, and then to use azathioprine/mercaptopurine, or to give azathioprine/mercaptopurine immediately, especially in high-risk patients.},

The aim of the present study was to investigate if EN-induced remission is associated with modification of the fecal microflora in CD. METHODS: Stool samples were collected from 5 healthy children and adolescents over a period of 3 months, and from 9 children and adolescents with active CD. To induce disease remission, children with CD received a course of exclusive EN for 8 weeks with a polymeric formula (Modulen IBD, Nestle). At the end of the course of exclusive EN, children returned to a free diet but continued to take 40% of the daily caloric intake as polymeric formula. Fecal microflora was analyzed by 16S ribosomal DNA polymerase chain reaction and temperature gradient gel electrophoresis (TGGE) with direct visual comparison of band profiles of PCR products. RESULTS: In 8 of 9 children, the exclusive EN alone induced disease remission. In 1 child, it was necessary to add steroids to the exclusive EN course to achieve remission. In all children with CD, analysis of gel band distribution revealed profound modification of the fecal microflora after exclusive EN. Variations of band distribution corresponding to different bacterial species were observed also in children on partial EN and required time to achieve stability of the band profile. In contrast, control healthy children showed a host-specific and stable TGGE profile over time. CONCLUSION: These data suggest that a possible mechanism of action of EN in inducing disease remission in CD is the capacity of modification of gut microflora. Possible explanations of such capacity are both low residue and prebiotic properties of the polymeric liquid formula.},

No significant differences have been shown in the effects of free amino acid, peptide-based and whole protein formulae for TF. In remission ONS is recommended only in steroid dependent patients in CD. In patients with SBS TF should be introduced in the adaptation phase and should be changed with progressing adaptation to ONS in addition to normal food.},

   abstract = {BACKGROUND AND AIMS: Dietary microparticles, which are bacteria-sized and non-biological, found in the modern Western diet, have been implicated in both the aetiology and pathogenesis of Crohn's disease. Following on from the findings of a previous pilot study, we aimed to confirm whether a reduction in the amount of dietary microparticles facilitates induction of remission in patients with active Crohn's disease, in a single-blind, randomized, multi-centre, placebo controlled trial. METHODS: Eighty-three patients with active Crohn's disease were randomly allocated in a 2 x 2 factorial design to a diet low or normal in microparticles and/or calcium for 16 weeks. All patients received a reducing dose of prednisolone for 6 weeks. Outcome measures were Crohn's disease activity index, Van Hees index, quality of life and a series of objective measures of inflammation including erythrocyte sedimentation rate, C-reactive protein, intestinal permeability and faecal calprotectin. After 16 weeks patients returned to their normal diet and were followed up for a further 36 weeks. RESULTS: Dietary manipulation provided no added effect to corticosteroid treatment on any of the outcome measures during the dietary trial (16 weeks) or follow-up (to 1 year); e.g., for logistic regression of Crohn's disease activity index based rates of remission (P=0.1) and clinical response (P=0.8), in normal versus low microparticle groups. CONCLUSIONS: Our adequately powered and carefully controlled dietary trial found no evidence that reducing microparticle intake aids remission in active Crohn's disease.},

   abstract = {BACKGROUND: Prebiotics are short-chain carbohydrates that alter the composition, or metabolism, of the gut microbiota in a beneficial manner. It is therefore expected that prebiotics will improve health in a way similar to probiotics, whilst at the same time being cheaper, and carrying less risk and being easier to incorporate into the diet than probiotics. AIM: To review published evidence for prebiotic effects on gut function and human health. METHODS: We searched the Science Citation Index with the terms prebiotic, microbiota, gut bacteria, large intestine, mucosa, bowel habit, constipation, diarrhoea, inflammatory bowel disease, Crohn's disease, ulcerative colitis, pouchitis, calcium and cancer, focussing principally on studies in humans and reports in the English language. Search of the Cochrane Library did not identify any clinical study or meta-analysis on this topic. RESULTS: Three prebiotics, oligofructose, galacto-oligosaccharides and lactulose, clearly alter the balance of the large bowel microbiota by increasing bifidobacteria and Lactobacillus numbers. These carbohydrates are fermented and give rise to short-chain fatty acid and intestinal gas; however, effects on bowel habit are relatively small. Randomized-controlled trials of their effect in a clinical context are few, although animal studies show anti-inflammatory effects in inflammatory bowel disease, while calcium absorption is increased. CONCLUSIONS: It is still early days for prebiotics, but they offer the potential to modify the gut microbial balance in such a way as to bring direct health benefits cheaply and safely.},

Many experimental and clinical studies suggest that intestinal bacterial flora plays an important role in the pathogenesis of IBD, and manipulation of the luminal contents with antibiotics or probiotics represents a potentially effective therapeutic option. The beneficial effect of probiotics was demonstrated mainly in the prevention and treatment of pouchitis and in maintaining remission of mild to moderate ulcerative colitis. Probiotics seems to be less effective in patients with Crohn's disease. Randomized clinical trials are still required to further define the role of probiotics as preventive and therapeutic agents.

This led to the concept of using ingested living micro-organisms to produce and transport these molecules to targets in the proximal or distal intestine. Several characteristics of this pharmacological approach are very original: potential for in vivo production of active molecules, for targeting immune cells, for presenting immunogenic molecules in a microbial context, for duodenal delivery using bile sensitivity. Probiotics have been studied for some decades and more recently worm eggs have also received some interest. This paper summarizes facts (especially results of randomized controlled trials and pharmacokinetic studies), and ideas about the use of probiotics to treat or prevent gastrointestinal diseases. The safety of this approach (exceptional cases of infections have been observed), and the potential for using new agents or genetically modified micro-organisms (ongoing trials in humans with Crohn's disease) are also discussed.},

   abstract = {BACKGROUND AND AIMS: Early endoscopic recurrence is frequent after intestinal resection for Crohn's disease. Bacteria are involved, and probiotics may modulate immune responses to the intestinal flora. Here we tested the probiotic strain Lactobacillus johnsonii LA1 in this setting. PATIENTS AND METHODS: This was a randomised, double blind, placebo controlled study. Patients were eligible if they had undergone surgical resection of <1 m, removing all macroscopic lesions within the past 21 days. Patients were randomised to receive two packets per day of lyophilised LA1 (2 x 10(9) cfu) or placebo for six months; no other treatment was allowed. The primary endpoint was endoscopic recurrence at six months, with grade >1 in Rutgeerts' classification or an adapted classification for colonic lesions. Endoscopic score was the maximal grade of ileal and colonic lesions. Analyses were performed primarily on an intent to treat basis. RESULTS: Ninety eight patients were enrolled (48 in the LA1 group). At six months, endoscopic recurrence was observed in 30/47 patients (64%) in the placebo group and in 21/43 (49%) in the LA1 group (p = 0.15). Per protocol analysis confirmed this result. Endoscopic score distribution did not differ significantly between the LA1 and placebo groups. There were four clinical recurrences in the LA1 group and three in the placebo group. CONCLUSION: L johnsonii LA1 (4 x 10(9) cfu/day) did not have a sufficient effect, if any, to prevent endoscopic recurrence of Crohn's disease.},

K. a 19 year old woman was admitted the impatient clinic for a 2 week history of nodular lesions of the extremities. Simultaneously, she had watery diarrhoea and abdominal pain associated with a bad general condition and fever. Skin examination showed ulcerated lesions with a non infiltrated inflammatory bader of the left food and the right calf associated with an abscess of the left forearm. Skin biopsy showed an inflammatory infiltrate of the deep dermis with tuberculoid noncaseating granulomas. Colonoscopy demonstrated multiple ulcers, a "globlestone appearance" of the glow and segmental glitis. Colonoscopy was followed by a peritonitis which made steroid therapy questionable. Meanwhile, the patient underwent a colonostomy and was fed intravenously, the skin lesions resolved. A follow up colonoscopy demonstrated colon polyps, and the biopsy of the colon showed features of colitis and "follicular" duodenitis which was in concordance with the diagnosis of Crohn's disease. COMMENTARIES: Usually, cutaneous lesions in Crohn's disease are consistent with nodules and granulomatous fissures of the grain. Involvement of the mucosa is rare. We report the case of "metastatic" localisation of nodular abscesses in Corhn disease. Improvement of cutaneous lesions might be explained by the nonuse of the digestive track allowed by the parenteral supplementation.},

   abstract = {In Japan, nutritional therapy as both a primary and as a secondary treatment is widely used for Crohn's disease (CD). The rationale for its use is based on a variety of reasons. The first is its ability to induce remission and to ameliorate the activity of intestinal lesions in the short term by enteral (EN) or by parenteral nutritional therapy in which overexpressions of chemokine receptors in an active stage are decreased significantly in the remission stage. Second is its ability to maintain remission over the long term through home-based enteral nutrition in which tube feeding during the nighttime is encouraged. Third is its ability to reduce the steroid dosage over the period of a long-term treatment course. However, several disadvantages of this therapy such as unpalatability and sluggish effect have been pointed out. Several studies have attempted to resolve this issue and determine the best components of EN, especially in fat composition. Some data have been suggestive of too much long-chained fatty acid having a hazardous effect on EN's clinical efficacy because it works as a precursor of inflammatory prostaglandins. Our recent data show that medium-chained triglyceride did not have such a hazardous effect on clinical efficacy. Several studies suggested that the patient factors that were resistant to inducing remission in the short term were a long period of suffering CD, a high activity (on Crohn's Disease Activity Index, CDAI), hemorrhagic colitis, and colitis with marked cobblestoning. Japanese guidelines for the treatment of CD recommended nutritional therapy as a first-line therapy and as a maintenance therapy after inducing remission. This treatment policy has led to Japanese CD patients having lower mortality rates than that of patients who do not receive EN. If this therapy could be combined with other drug therapies, including strong immunosuppressants, treatment strategies would be improved over those we have at present.},

AIMS: To compare vitamin D status and bone turnover markers in Crohn's disease patients with age- and sex-matched controls during late-summer and late-winter. SUBJECTS: Crohn's disease patients (n = 44; mean age 36.9 years, currently in remission) and matched controls (n = 44) were recruited from Cork University Hospital and Cork City area, respectively. METHODS: Bloods were analysed for 25-hydroxyvitamin D, parathyroid hormone, bone-specific alkaline phosphatase, osteocalcin and urine analysed for N-telopeptides of type 1 collagen. RESULTS: Serum 25-hydroxyvitamin D concentrations were significantly (P < 0.003) lower in Crohn's disease patients than in control subjects during both seasons. In Crohn's disease patients, serum 25-hydroxyvitamin D concentrations were lower (P < 0.0001) whereas serum parathyroid hormone, osteocalcin and bone-specific alkaline phosphatase and urinary N-telopeptides of type 1 collagen levels were higher (P < 0.001) during late-winter than late-summer. CONCLUSION: There were notable seasonal variations in vitamin D status and bone turnover markers in Crohn's disease patients. The impact of winter decline in vitamin D status and increase in bone turnover on long-term risk of osteopenia/osteoporosis in Crohn's disease patients is unclear.},

   abstract = {PURPOSE OF REVIEW: This review reports on the recent progress understanding mechanisms of action and clinical applications of probiotics. RECENT FINDINGS: New insights on regulating mechanisms of intestinal commensal bacteria to prevent and treat different gastrointestinal diseases have been reported. Some probiotics, though not all, exert beneficial effects by modulating the mucosal barrier function and immune activity. It seems that a combination of different probiotics is more effective than a single strain. It was demonstrated that not only viable bacteria administered to the intestinal tract but also isolated probiotic DNA is active, even if injected subcutaneously. There is reasonable evidence to recommend probiotics in infectious diarrhoea for prevention and treatment (mainly in children) and to prevent antibiotic-induced gastrointestinal side effects. Furthermore, probiotics are effective in maintaining remission in ulcerative colitis and preventing and treating pouchitis. Promising positive effects were published in major surgery patients (gastric resection, pancreatic resection, liver transplantation) and in severe necrotising acute pancreatitis. SUMMARY: Increasing knowledge on probiotics is exciting, but in the near future it must be defined which probiotics (single strains or a combination) are most effective in specific diseases. Well-designed, randomized clinical trials are still required to further define the role of probiotics as preventive and therapeutic agents.},

   abstract = {AIM: To investigate the influence of fish oil enriched enteral diet on intestinal tissues taken from Crohn's disease (CD), ulcerative colitis (UC) and non-inflamed non-IBD control patients in vitro. METHODS: Colonoscopic biopsies from patients with active CD (n = 4), active UC (n = 7), and non-inflamed non-IBD control patients (n = 4) were incubated (three dilutions of 1:20, 1:10, and 1:5) with Waymouth's culture medium and enteral elemental diet (EO28, SHS, Liverpool, UK) modified in the fatty acid composition with fish oil (EF) in an organ culture system for 24 h. In each experimental set-up, incubation with Waymouth's medium alone as control was included. Tissue viability was assessed by adding bromodeoxyuridine (BrdU) to the culture fluid and immunohistochemically staining for BrdU uptake. Cytokine ratio of IL-1ra/IL-1beta (low ratio indicative of inflammation) and production of those cytokines as a percentage of medium control were assayed in the culture supernatant. RESULTS: Incubation of CD-affected tissue with EF (1:20, 1:10, and 1:5) modestly and non-significantly increased IL-1ra/IL-1beta ratio as compared with medium control (CD 39.1+/-16.1; 26.5+/-7.8, 47.1+/-16.8 vs control 13.0+/-2.2), but incubation of UC-affected tissues increased IL-1ra/IL-1beta ratio significantly in all three dilutions (UC 69.1+/-32.2, P<0.05; 76.1+/-36.4, P = 0.05; 84.5+/-37.3, P<0.02; vs control 10.2+/-3.7). Incubation of non-inflamed non-IBD control tissue did not increase the IL-1ra/IL-1beta ratio in any dilution compared to medium control (69.3+/-47.0, 54.1+/-30.6, 79.4+/-34.0 vs control 76.1+/-37.3). Average percentage production of IL-1beta indexed against medium control was significantly less in UC after EF incubation as compared with CD (UC 24.0+/-4.8 vs CD 51.8+/-8.1; P<0.05). Average percentage production of IL-1ra was markedly higher in UC (135.9+/-3.4) than that in control patients (36.5+/-4.3) (P<0.0001). CONCLUSION: IBD tissues, after incubation with elemental diet modified in its fatty acid composition with fish oil, show an increase in IL-1ra/IL-1beta cytokine ratio. This effect of omega-3 fatty acid modulation is significantly more marked in UC compared with CD and is accompanied by both a reduction of IL-1beta and increase of IL-1ra. The positive direct anti-inflammatory effect of elemental diet with fish oil in tissue affected with UC suggests dietary treatment of UC may be possible.},

   abstract = {BACKGROUND: The irritable bowel syndrome (IBS) is a functional bowel disorder characterized by symptoms of abdominal pain that is associated with disturbed defecation. Crohn's disease (CD) and Ulcerative colitis (UC) are collectively referred to as inflammatory bowel diseases (IBD). IBD appears to result from dysregulated immune response with contributions from genetic predisposition and environmental factors. Among environmental factors the enteric microflora and the components of food (eg. antigens) may play important role in the pathogenesis of IBD. The aim of the authors' study was to detect IgE type antibodies against the most frequent food allergens in patients with IBD and IBS. METHODS: Antibodies against food allergens (IgE type) with ELISA method in patients with CD, UC and IBS were quantitatively measured. The figures were compared to the result of a healthy control group contains the same number of participants, and the frequency of food allergy in these patient groups were determined. RESULTS: On the basis of the study the presence of increased IgE type immune response against any food allergens was 34.5% (p = 0.01) in the group of IBS. In patients with CD or UC the immune response against food allergens was also more frequent than in the control group. The order of frequency of food allergens in IBS was the following: milk protein, soybean, tomato, peanut, egg white. CONCLUSION: As the occurrence of food allergens was significantly higher in IBS group than in the control group, the role of food allergy in the symptoms of IBS can be come up. The frequency of food allergy in patients with diagnosis of IBS, and the similarity of symptoms of this two diseases give an obvious opportunity for the patients with IBS to use a diet avoiding the most frequent food allergens, or take e.g. Na-cromoglycate which is useful therapy in food allergy.},

We report the case of a man, a habitual consumer of raw fish, who underwent surgery for acute abdomen, initially attributed to Crohn's disease and then later interpreted as eosinophilic enteritis. Only the subsequent careful histological examination of the surgical specimen, revealing full thickness eosinophilic infiltrate, generally typical of infestation, led to the detection of Anisakis simplex larva. In cases of acute abdomen, in the presence of a positive history of raw fish ingestion, it is therefore reasonable to consider the possibility of anisakiasis.},

The second one of monozygotic twins does not develop the disease in 100% but only in 20-50%. To unravel these mysteries, literature was searched to determine the disease background and find suggestions for research and prevention. The causal antigen of coeliac disease is gluten of wheat that is neutralised in the intestine by secretory immune globulin A (sIgA). SIgA is secreted by the secondary (lymphoid) immune system that develops in a newborn infant after the primary (central) immune organs thymus and bone marrow have been primed with antigens of the intestine. Predisposed infants are sensitive for development of coeliac disease during the time without sIgA secretion into the intestine. The risk of the disease diminishes when sIgA cycles of gluten neutralisation develop. Peyer's patches (PP) of the secondary immune system play a central role in the cycles and possibly do not function well in the case of coeliac disease. Coeliac disease in predisposed infants may be prevented by delay of bread consumption till the time of normal sIgA secretion and by application of a challenge period with gluten (see Discussion). It is concluded that sIgA secretion into body cavities and malfunction of immune cells in PP should be included in the future research of coeliac disease as well as in more allergic diseases (type 1 diabetes, Crohn disease, asthma, hay fever).},

   abstract = {PURPOSE OF REVIEW: Intestinal dendritic cells have emerged as key regulators of immunity to pathogens, oral tolerance and intestinal inflammation. Studies have begun to elucidate the regulatory mechanisms responsible for defining region- and compartment-specific phenotypes and functions of dendritic cells in mucosal tissues. RECENT FINDINGS: Specific subsets of dendritic cells appear to be associated with the various routes for antigen acquisition in the intestine. The constant sampling of intestinal antigenic content ensures establishment of tolerance to commensal bacteria and food antigens. Tolerance development to oral antigens is restricted to the mucosal immune system. Other advances have provided insight into the molecular basis of microbial recognition and innate immune responses by intestinal dendritic cells. Differences in the involvement of dendritic cells have begun to emerge in Crohn's disease and ulcerative colitis and link gene regulation in dendritic cells to therapeutic responses. SUMMARY: A major focus of mucosal immunology will be to understand how diverse dendritic cell subsets cooperate in regulating homeostasis and host defense in the different intestinal immune compartments. This will be pivotal to understanding how the mucosal immune system makes the distinction between commensal microbiota, pathogens and self antigens.},

   abstract = {BACKGROUND: Studies in animal models of inflammatory bowel disease (IBD) suggest that supplementation of total parenteral nutrition with glutamine (gln), a conditionally essential amino acid in catabolic conditions, increases gln plasma concentrations, reduces intestinal damage, improves nitrogen balance and may improve the course of the disease. However, human data supporting this assumption are missing. METHODS: A total of 24 consecutive patients with an acute exacerbation of IBD (19 Crohn's disease; five ulcerative colitis) and scheduled for total parenteral nutrition (TPN) (>7 days) were randomised. Parallel to a standardised anti-inflammatory therapy, the patients received either a TPN with 1.5 g/kg body weight of a standard amino acid or an isonitrogenic, isocaloric TPN with 1.2 g/kg body weight of a standard amino acid and 0.3 g/kg L-alanine-L-glutamine. Primary end points were gln plasma concentrations and intestinal permeability assessed by urinary lactulose and D-xylose ratio. RESULTS: Gln plasma levels did not differ significantly in either group throughout the study. Intestinal permeability did not change within 7 days either with or without gln supplementation (Delta-lactulose/xylose ratio: 0.01+/-0.05 (gln+) vs 0.02+/-0.1 (gln-)). The observed changes in inflammatory and nutritional parameters, and also disease activity, length of TPN and hospital stay, were independent of glutamine substitution. Five (41%) patients in the gln+ group and three (25%) patients in the gln- group needed surgical intervention. CONCLUSION: Although limited by the sample size, these results do not support the hypothesis that glutamine substitution has an obvious biochemical or clinical benefit in patients with active IBD scheduled for total parenteral nutrition.},

After resection, disease recurs postoperatively with a median time to second resection of about 10 years. Despite its importance, the postoperative period remains one of the most poorly understood clinical settings in the field. Postoperatively, CD may exhibit unique pathophysiologic features, but the current state of knowledge does not allow for identification of patients at risk for relapse, and leaves clinicians without guidance on optimal maintenance treatment. Therapies used as maintenance for CD in other settings may have different efficacies when used after surgery, and clinical research in patients requiring surgery is limited by the subset of patients available for study. Despite the many limitations in current knowledge of postoperative CD, it is an exciting field because new developments have improved patient care, and ongoing research has the potential for further gains.},

Nevertheless, these nutrients are still under evaluation and there are not enough available studies to recommend them in clinical routine.

In addition, the acknowledgement that live bacterial cells can be genetically engineered to synthesise products that have therapeutic potential has generated substantial interest among clinicians and health professionals. Clinical trials have increasingly provided an insightful scientific derivation for the use of live bacterial cells in medicinal practice in diseases such as diarrhoea, cancer, Crohn's disease, enhancement of the host's immune response, and numerous other diseases. A key constraint in the use of live bacterial cells, however, is the complexity of delivering them to the correct target sites. Oral delivery of free live cells, lyophilised cells and immobilised cells has been attempted, but with restricted success, chiefly because bacterial cells are unable to survive passage through the gastrointestinal tract in sufficient dosage. On many occasions, when given orally, these cells have been found to provoke immunogenic responses that are undesirable. Recent studies show that these problems can be overcome by delivering live bacterial cells using artificial cell microcapsules. This review abridges recent developments in the therapeutic use of live bacterial cells, addresses the potential and restrictions for their application in therapy, and provides insights into the future course of this emerging therapy.},

Since the effects of nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drugs (NSAID) intolerance are by no means always severe or life-endangering but may just as well present as oligosymptomatic or local disorders (e.g. abdominal pain, diarrhea, we decided to evaluate the characteristics of patients with salicylate intolerance on the basis of gastroenterological case material of Medical Department I of Erlangen University. On the basis of the findings from the Erlangen interdisciplinary data register of chronic inflammatory gastrointestinal disease, the signs and symptoms of NSAID intolerance were found to constitute a diagnosis of great practical import to clinical medicine (allergology, dermatology, immunology, other disorders etc.) including gastroenterology. For approx. 2-7% of all patients with inflammatory bowel syndrome and food allergies this poses a new diagnostic and therapeutic challenge which may concern physicians from any of the disciplines involved. When presented with patients with chronic active disease who are suffering from these symptoms one should, therefore, in future give greater thought to the possibility of salicylate intolerance, all the more as there are meaningful dietetic, diagnostic and therapeutic options available for these persons.},

Pulse granulomas are peculiar reactions to particles of food that are characterized by clusters of small to medium-sized hyaline rings. Pulse granulomas are rare and have occupied only the lungs, in association with aspiration, and the alimentary canal, in association with oral pathology, colonic diverticula, and a rectal mass. OBJECTIVE: To report pulse granulomas that occupied previously unrecognized sites and to alert pathologists to the diagnostic pitfall of mistaking pulse granulomas for other entities. DESIGN: We retrospectively reviewed 3 recently encountered cases that involved pulse granulomas in the gallbladder, fallopian tube, and skin. RESULTS: In all cases, pulse granulomas were associated with fistulae involving the gastrointestinal tract. One fistula was clinically occult. Microscopy showed barium-laden histiocytes admixed with hyaline rings, with or without vegetable matter, confirming fistulae involving the gastrointestinal tract. Absence of other features of chronicity, including sarcoid-type granulomas and Langhans-type giant cells, helped to essentially exclude Crohn disease. In 1 case, hyaline rings of pulse granulomas closely resembled hyaline vasculopathy of amyloidosis, diabetes, or hypertension. Surprisingly, polariscopy failed to detect any vegetable matter. In 1 case, negative polariscopy contributed to the difficulty in finding rare vegetable matter. CONCLUSIONS: We demonstrated that pulse granulomas can occur outside the lungs and alimentary canal, and can be associated with fistulae involving the gastrointestinal tract. Awareness of this finding is necessary to avoid confusion with Crohn disease and hyaline vasculopathy. Polariscopy may fail to detect vegetable matter.},

   abstract = {The demonstration that immune and epithelial cells can discriminate between different microbial species has extended our understanding of the actions of probiotics beyond simple antimicrobial concepts. Several probiotic mechanisms of action, relative to inflammatory bowel disease, have been elucidated: (1) competitive exclusion, whereby probiotics compete with microbial pathogens; (2) immunomodulation and/or stimulation of an immune response; (3) antimicrobial activity and suppression of pathogen growth; (4) enhancement of barrier activity; and (5) induction of T cell apoptosis. The unraveling of these mechanisms of action has led to new support for the use of probiotics in the management of clinical inflammatory bowel disease. While level 1 evidence now supports the therapeutic use of some probiotics in the maintenance treatment of pouchitis, only level 2 and 3 evidence are currently available in support of the use of probiotics in the treatment of ulcerative colitis and Crohn's disease. Nevertheless, one significant and consistent finding has emerged over the course of research in the past year: not all probiotic bacteria have similar therapeutic effects. Rigorously designed, controlled clinical trials, to investigate the unresolved issues related to efficacy, dose, duration of use, single or multistrain formulation, and the concomitant use of prebiotics, synbiotics or antibiotics, are vital.},

   abstract = {BACKGROUND: Crohn's disease (CD) is characterised by episodes of disease activity and symptom-free remission. Probiotics are microorganisms that can potentially benefit health, and have been evaluated as an alternate means of preventing relapse in patients with CD. OBJECTIVES: To assess the effectiveness of probiotics for the maintenance of remission in CD. SEARCH STRATEGY: The following databases were searched: the Cochrane Database of Systematic Reviews (2005, Issue 3); the Cochrane Central Register of Controlled Trials (2005, Issue 3); the Cochrane IBD/FBD Group Trials Register (2005), MEDLINE (1966-2005); EMBASE (1980-2005); ISI Web of Knowledge (BIDS) 1981-2005; On-line clinical trials databases (2005); and review articles. Experts in the field were contacted for unpublished data. SELECTION CRITERIA: Randomised controlled trials of probiotic therapy. DATA COLLECTION AND ANALYSIS: Two independent reviewers performed data extraction and assessment of methodological quality. The primary outcome was the relative risk (RR) of relapse after maintenance treatment (and 95% confidence intervals [CI]). MAIN RESULTS: Seven small studies were identified and varied according to probiotics tested, methodological quality and medication regimen. No studies were pooled for statistical analysis. There was no statistically significant benefit of E. coli Nissle for reducing the risk of relapse compared to placebo (RR 0.43, 95% CI 0.15 to 1.20), or Lactobacillus GG after surgically-induced remission (RR 1.58, 95% CI 0.30 to 8.40) or medically-induced remission (RR 0.83, 95% CI 0.25 to 2.80). There was no statistically significant benefit of probiotics for reducing the risk of relapse compared to maintenance therapy employing aminosalicylates or azathioprine (RR 0.67, 95% CI 0.13 to 3.30), and in this study the probiotic Lactobacillus GG was associated with adverse events. In children, there was there was no statistically significant difference between Lactobacillus GG and placebo for reducing the risk of relapse (RR 1.85, 95% CI 0.77 to 4.40). A small study using the yeast Saccharomyces boulardii demonstrated a difference that was not statistically significant in favour of probiotic combined with a reduced level of maintenance therapy over standard maintenance treatment alone (RR 0.17, 95% CI 0.02 to 1.23). AUTHORS' CONCLUSIONS: There is no evidence to suggest that probiotics are beneficial for the maintenance of remission in CD. All of the included studies enrolled small numbers of patients and may have lacked statistical power to show differences should they exist. Larger trials are required to determine if probiotics are of benefit in Crohn's disease.},

   abstract = {Ulcerative colitis (UC) and Crohn disease (CD) are chronic intestinal inflammatory diseases that can present as bloody diarrhea, abdominal pain, and malnutrition. Collectively, these disorders are referred to as inflammatory bowel disease (IBD). All patients with IBD share a common pathophysiology. However, there are a number of developmental, psychosocial, and physiologic issues that are unique to the approximate, equals 20% of patients that present during childhood or adolescence. These include the possibility of disease-induced delays in linear growth or physical development, differences in drug dosing, and the changes in social and cognitive development that occur as children move from school-age years into adolescence and early adulthood. Gastroenterologists caring for these children must therefore develop an optimal regimen of pharmacologic therapies, nutritional management, psychologic support, and properly timed surgery (when necessary) that will maintain disease remission, minimize disease and drug-induced adverse effects, and optimize growth and development. This article reviews current approaches to the management of patients with UC and CD and highlights issues specific to the treatment of children with IBD. The principal medical therapies used to induce disease remission in patients with UC are aminosalicylates (for mild disease), corticosteroids (for moderate disease), and cyclosporine (ciclosporin) (for severe disease). If a patient responds to the induction regimen, maintenance therapies that are used to prevent disease relapse include aminosalicylates, mercaptopurine, and azathioprine. Colectomy with creation of an ileal pouch anal anastomosis (J pouch) has become the standard of care for patients with severe or refractory colitis and results in an improved quality of life in most patients. Therefore, the risks associated with using increasingly potent immunosuppressant agents must be balanced in each case against a patient's desire to retain their colon and avoid a temporary or potentially permanent ileostomy. Decisions about drug therapy in the management of patients with CD are more complex and depend on both the location (e.g. gastroduodenal vs small intestinal vs colonic), as well as the behavior of the disease (inflammatory/mucosal vs stricturing vs perforating) in a given patient. Induction therapies for CD typically include aminosalicylates and antibiotics (for mild mucosal disease), nutritional therapy (including elemental or polymeric formulas), corticosteroids (for moderate disease), and infliximab (for corticosteroid-resistant or fistulizing disease). Aminosalicylates, mercaptopurine, azathioprine, methotrexate, and infliximab can be used as maintenance therapies. Because surgical treatment of CD is not curative, it is typically reserved for those patients either with persistent symptoms and disease limited to a small section of the intestine (e.g. the terminal ileum and cecum) or for the management of complications of the disease including stricture or abdominal abscess. When surgery is necessary, maintenance medications administered postoperatively will postpone recurrence. Patients with UC and CD are at risk for the development of micronutrient deficiencies (including folate, iron, and vitamin D deficiencies) and require close nutritional monitoring. In addition, patients with UC and CD involving the colon are at increased risk of developing colon cancer, and should be enrolled into a colonoscopy surveillance program after 8-10 years of disease duration.},

   abstract = {To evaluate the role of dietary factors in the etiology of inflammatory bowel disease (IBD), we conducted a multicenter hospital-based case-control study in a Japanese population. Cases were IBD patients aged 15 to 34 years [ulcerative colitis (UC) 111 patients; Crohn's disease (CD) 128 patients] within 3 years after diagnosis in 13 hospitals. One control subject was recruited for each case who was matched for sex, age, and hospital. A semiquantitative food frequency questionnaire was used to estimate preillness intakes of food groups and nutrients. All the available control subjects (n = 219) were pooled, and unconditional logistic models were applied to calculate odds ratios (ORs). In the food groups, a higher consumption of sweets was positively associated with UC risk [OR for the highest versus lowest quartile, 2.86; 95% confidence interval (CI), 1.24 to 6.57], whereas the consumption of sugars and sweeteners (OR, 2.12; 95% CI, 1.08 to 4.17), sweets (OR, 2.83; 95% CI, 1.38 to 5.83), fats and oils (OR, 2.64; 95% CI, 1.29 to 5.39), and fish and shellfish (OR, 2.41; 95% CI, 1.18-4.89) were positively associated with CD risk. In respect to nutrients, the intake of vitamin C (OR, 0.45; 95% CI, 0.21 to 0.99) was negatively related to UC risk, while the intake of total fat (OR, 2.86; 95% CI, 1.39 to 5.90), monounsaturated fatty acids (OR, 2.49; 95% CI, 1.23 to 5.03) and polyunsaturated fatty acids (OR, 2.31; 95% CI, 1.12 to 4.79), vitamin E (OR, 3.23; 95% CI, 1.45 to 7.17), and n-3 (OR, 3.24; 95% CI, 1.52 to 6.88) and n-6 fatty acids (OR, 2.57; 95% CI, 1.24 to 5.32) was positively associated with CD risk. Although this study suffers from the shortcoming of recall bias, which is inherent in most retrospective studies (prospective studies are warranted to confirm the associations between diet and IBD risk), the present findings suggest the importance of dietary factors for IBD prevention.},

   abstract = {PURPOSE OF REVIEW: The author presents evidence published during the past year regarding treatment of clinical and experimental intestinal inflammation and infections by probiotic agents. RECENT FINDINGS: Normal commensal bacteria are implicated in the pathogenesis of chronic, immune-mediated intestinal inflammation, particularly Crohn disease and pouchitis, whereas viral, bacterial, fungal, and protozoan infections are increasingly important with widespread use of immunosuppressive agents and broad-spectrum antibiotics. Combinations of Lactobacilli, Bifidobacteria, and Streptococcus salivarius prevent relapse of recurrent pouchitis and perhaps decrease the initial onset of pouch inflammation, whereas Escherichia coli Nissle 1917 maintains remission in ulcerative colitis. Several agents offer promise as primary therapy of ulcerative colitis. Use of probiotics in Crohn disease remains unsubstantiated. Animal models demonstrate marked differences in responses among various probiotic bacterial species and that nonviable organisms can have therapeutic efficacy. Probiotics have multiple mechanisms of action, including prevention of pathogenic bacterial growth, binding to or penetration of pathogens to mucosal surfaces, stimulation of mucosal barrier function, or altering immunoregulation (decreasing proinflammatory and promoting protective molecules). Although multiple probiotic species block epithelial adhesion and invasion by microbial pathogens in vitro, their proven utility in clinical infections is limited to accelerating recovery from acute infectious diarrhea and preventing antibiotic-associated diarrhea. SUMMARY: Probiotics offer promise for physiologic, nontoxic treatment of pouchitis, ulcerative colitis, and acute infectious diarrhea, but larger, controlled clinical studies must be performed to clarify optimal agents; doses; combinations of various probiotics, prebiotics, and antibiotics; and therapeutic conditions.},

The causes of these diseases are largely unknown, with current treatments targeted against the heightened inflammatory response witnessed in the intestinal mucosa of both conditions. With the peak age ranges for pregnancy and inflammatory bowel disease overlapping, it is important to weigh the benefits of treating a mother during pregnancy against the potential risks to the fetus and the course of the pregnancy. This review examines the current safety data on medications used in women with inflammatory bowel disease during pregnancy.},

   abstract = {BACKGROUND AND AIM: Glucagon-like peptide-2 (GLP-2) and peptide YY (PYY) are produced in endocrine L-cells of the intestine and secreted in response to food intake. GLP-2 has a trophic effect on the intestinal epithelium, whereas PYY has pro-absorptive effects. It can be speculated that, in inflammatory bowel disease (IBD), the production and secretion of GLP-2 and PYY could be affected as a part of a regulatory mechanism. Therefore, tissue levels and meal-stimulated secretion of GLP-2 and PYY were studied in IBD patients and compared to controls. METHODS: Outpatients with IBD and control patients were included. Mucosal biopsies were taken from the ileum and colon and the content of GLP-2 and PYY was measured. After colonoscopy the patients took a mixed meal and plasma was collected for 90 min for plasma measurements of GLP-2 and PYY. RESULTS: Tissue levels of GLP-2 in control patients were highest in the terminal ileum (407+/-82 pmol/g tissue, n=10), whereas PYY was highest in the rectum (919+/-249 pmol/g tissue, n=10). In IBD patients with acute inflammation, the content of GLP-2 was similar to controls, whereas PYY was decreased to 72.1+/-17.7% (P=0.03, n=13) of control values. Neither the fasting plasma levels nor the meal responses of GLP-2 and PYY differed between controls and IBD patients. CONCLUSION: The similar responses of GLP-2 and PYY in patients and controls do not support the suggestion that L-cell secretion is altered in IBD. The decreased tissue PYY concentrations may contribute to the diarrhoea of some of these patients.},

   abstract = {Food-induced immune responses cause or influence a number of intestinal diseases. Food antigens may either directly affect the mucosal immune system, or food modulate the intestinal flora, which may alter the immune response. The system preventing food-induced immune responses is complex: The mucosal barrier is the primary mechanism of host defense. Secondly, the innate immune system can neutralize some of the pathogens or food antigens. Thirdly, the adaptive immune system normally is in a state of unresponsiveness called oral tolerance. Only if these mechanisms fail, can immune reactions be observed. There are diseases where food is the primary factor in the pathogenesis, such as food allergy and gluten-sensitive enteropathy. Both diseases are mediated by different types of immune reactions. Furthermore, allergic reactions may play a role in eosinophilic esophagitis and eosinophilic gastroenteritis. In chronic inflammatory bowel disease food influences the disease by the modulation of various factors such as intestinal bacterial flora or the inflammatory cascade. Yeast antigens, especially in people with a defect in the innate immune system, such as MBL-deficiency may lead to an enhanced immune reactivity to mannan antigens of yeast. This may have some significance in the perpetuation of intestinal inflammatory processes in patients with Crohn's disease.},

   abstract = {OBJECTIVE: Diverse neurologic syndromes have been described in association with tumor necrosis factor alpha (TNFalpha) antagonist therapy for inflammatory arthritides and Crohn's disease. The objective of this study was to review the occurrence and clinical features of Guillain-Barre syndrome and its variant, the Miller Fisher syndrome, during TNFalpha antagonist therapy. METHODS: The postmarketing database of the US Food and Drug Administration (FDA) was searched, following our experience with a patient with rheumatoid arthritis in whom the Miller Fisher syndrome variant of the Guillain-Barre syndrome developed while he was receiving infliximab therapy. RESULTS: Our index patient had a neurologic illness defined initially by ataxia and dysarthria, which fluctuated in relation to each subsequent infliximab infusion and, after 6 months, culminated in areflexic flaccid quadriplegia. In addition, 15 patients in whom Guillain-Barre syndrome developed following TNFalpha antagonist therapy were identified from the FDA database. Guillain-Barre syndrome developed following infliximab therapy in 9 patients, following etanercept therapy in 5 patients, and following adalimumab therapy in 1 patient. Among the 13 patients for whom followup data were available, 1 patient experienced no resolution, 9 patients had partial resolution, and 3 patients had complete resolution of Guillain-Barre syndrome following therapy. CONCLUSION: An association of Guillain-Barre syndrome with TNFalpha antagonist therapy is supported by the worsening of neurologic symptoms that occurred in our index patient following each infusion of infliximab, and by the temporal association of this syndrome with TNFalpha antagonist therapy in 15 other patients. An acute or subacute demyelinating polyneuropathy should be considered a potential adverse effect of TNFalpha antagonist therapy.},

   abstract = {Intestinal glutamine utilization is integral to mucosal regeneration. We analyzed the systemic and intestinal glutamine status in Crohn's disease (CD) and evaluated the therapeutic effect of glutamine supplementation in an animal model of ileitis. In CD, glutamine concentrations were decreased systemically and in noninflamed and inflamed ileal/colonic mucosa. Mucosal glutaminase activities were depressed in the ileum independent of inflammation but were not different from controls in the colon. In experimental ileitis, oral glutamine feeding prevented macroscopic inflammation, enhanced ileal and colonic glutaminase activities above controls, and normalized the intestinal glutathione redox status. However, glutamine supplementation enhanced myeloperoxidase activity along the gastrointestinal tract and potentiated lipid peroxidation in the colon. In conclusion, glutamine metabolism is impaired in CD. In experimental ileitis, glutamine supplementation prevents inflammatory tissue damage. In the colon, however, which does not use glutamine as its principal energy source, immune enhancement of inflammatory cells by glutamine increases oxidative tissue injury.},

   abstract = {BACKGROUND: Lactobacilli are probiotic bacteria that are frequently tested in the management of allergic diseases or gastroenteritis. It is hypothesized that these probiotics have immunoregulatory properties and promote mucosal tolerance, which is in part mediated by regulatory T cells (Treg cells). On the basis of pathogenic or tissue-specific priming, dendritic cells (DC) acquire different T cell-instructive signals and drive the differentiation of naive T H cells into either T H 1, T H 2, or regulatory effector T cells. OBJECTIVE: We studied in what way different species of lactobacilli prime human DCs for their ability to drive Treg cells. METHODS: Human monocyte-derived DCs were cultured in vitro with lactobacilli of different species. RESULTS: Two different species of lactobacilli, Lactobacillus reuteri and Lactobacillus casei , but not Lactobacillus plantarum, prime monocyte-derived DCs to drive the development of Treg cells. These Treg cells produced increased levels of IL-10 and were capable of inhibiting the proliferation of bystander T cells in an IL-10-dependent fashion. Strikingly, both L reuteri and L casei , but not L plantarum , bind the C-type lectin DC-specific intercellular adhesion molecule 3-grabbing non-integrin (DC-SIGN). Blocking antibodies to DC-SIGN inhibited the induction of the Treg cells by these probiotic bacteria, stressing that ligation of DC-SIGN can actively prime DCs to induce Treg cells. CONCLUSIONS: The targeting of DC-SIGN by certain probiotic bacteria might explain their beneficial effect in the treatment of a number of inflammatory diseases, including atopic dermatitis and Crohn's disease.},

METHODS: A total of 78 CD patients and 80 healthy controls were evaluated in respect of nutritional status, dietary intake, and life styles factors. RESULTS: These 73/78 CD patients were on immunomodulating therapies. Mean body mass index (BMI) was lower in patients as compared to controls (P= 0.006) but 32% of CD patients and 33.8% of controls had a BMI > 25, whereas 8% and 23.8% in each group, respectively, were obese (BMI > 30Kg/m(2)). Fat free mass was significantly decreased in both genders (P < 0.05) whereas fat mass was decreased only in males (P= 0.01). Energy intake was significantly lower in CD patients (P < 0.0001) and we observed significantly lower adjusted mean daily intakes of carbohydrates, monounsaturated fat, fiber, calcium, and vitamins C, D, E, and K (P < 0.05). 29% of patients had excluded grains from their usual diet, 28% milk, 18% vegetables, and 11% fruits. Milk exclusion resulted in a significantly lower consumption of calcium and vitamin K (P < 0.001) and the exclusion of vegetables was associated to a lower consumption of vitamins C and E (P < 0.05). Physical activity was significantly lower in CD patients (P= 0.01) and this lack of physical activity was inversely correlated with increased fat mass percentage (r=-0.315, P= 0.001). CONCLUSIONS: Results showed that the most prevalent form of malnutrition in CD patients was an excess of body weight, which was concomitant with an inadequate dietary intake, namely micronutrients, clearly related to dietary exclusion of certain foods.},

The aim of this study was to identify foods causing intolerance and to determine the nature and severity of reported symptoms. Patients from the Dutch Crohn's and Ulcerative Colitis Association were mailed a survey on food intolerance; 105 (31% men) of 137 patients took part. They all reported intolerance to one or more foods. Common symptoms (scored from 0=absent to 10=severe), included diarrhea (mean score=5.8), fatigue (mean score=5.5), and thirst (mean score=4.6). Spicy foods, cabbage, and citrus fruits (or juice) were most likely to decrease stool consistency, increase stool frequency, or cause perianal irritation. Onions, cabbage, or leeks were reported by 28% of the patients to cause flatulence. The urge to defecate was stronger after a cooked meal (45% within (1/2) hour) than after sandwiches (15% within (1/2) hour). Foods reported to increase stool consistency were potato products, bread, and bananas. This study demonstrates that food intolerance is a common, albeit mild, problem after ileal pouch-anal anastomosis. Food and nutrition professionals should encourage patients to base their food choices on individual tolerance as long as no (patho-) physiological-based evidence to the contrary is available.},

   abstract = {Crohn's disease (CD) is an inflammatory disease characterized by the activation of the immune system in the gut. Since tumor necrosis factor (TNF-alpha) plays an important role in the initiation and perpetuation of intestinal inflammation in CD, we investigated whether TX 527 [19-nor-14,20-bisepi-23-yne-1,25(OH)(2)D(3)], a Vitamin D analogue, could affect peripheral blood mononuclear cells (PBMC) proliferation and exert an immunosuppressive effect on TNF-alpha production in CD patients, and whether this immunosuppressive action could be mediated by NF-kappaB down-regulation. TX 527 significantly decreased cell proliferation and TNF-alpha levels. On activation, NF-kappaB, rapidly released from its cytoplasmatic inhibitor (IKB-alpha), transmigrates into the nucleus and binds to DNA response elements in gene promoter regions. The activation of NF-kappaB, stimulated by TNF-alpha, and its nuclear translocation together with the degradation of IKB-alpha were blocked by TX 527. At the same time, NF-kappaB protein levels present in cytoplasmic extracts decreased in the presence of TNF-alpha and increased when PBMC were incubated with TX 527. The results of our studies indicate that TX 527 inhibits TNF-alpha mediated effects on PBMC and the activation of NF-kappaB and that its action is mediated by Vitamin D receptor (VDR), which is activated when the cells are stimulated with TX 527.},

   abstract = {PURPOSE OF REVIEW: Inflammatory bowel disease is thought to result from an abnormal response to the gut microbiota. This review discusses advances in knowledge of the changes in gut microbiota and host response in inflammatory bowel disease. RECENT FINDINGS: Approximately 15% of Crohn's disease cases in western populations result from mutations in NOD2/CARD15. This disease leads to defective intestinal defensin production and defective monocyte interleukin-8 response to bacterial peptidoglycan. A similar defective interleukin-8 response and consequent delayed neutrophil recruitment have also been shown in patients with Crohn's disease who do not have the NOD2 mutation. A consequence seems to be the accumulation in tissue of macrophages containing various bacteria, perhaps particularly Escherichia coli. In keeping with this patients with Crohn's disease have circulating antibodies against bacterial flagellar proteins of enterobacteria and clostridia. In ulcerative colitis, there is less evidence for invasion by or immune response to bacteria but changes in gut microbiota include a relative deficiency of bifidobacteria. There is considerable interest in probiotic or prebiotic therapies although so far little evidence for their efficacy. SUMMARY: Molecular techniques are giving us better insight into the gut microbiota in inflammatory bowel disease that should translate into improved therapies.},

   abstract = {Elemental diets (EDs) are effective in treating Crohn's disease. We hypothesize that low dietary fat and amino acids used as the sole nitrogen source are the major contributors for the success of EDs. We examined the influences of the addition of dietary fat and protein to an ED using an indomethacin-induced inflammation model in rat small intestine. In the ED-fed rats, the intestinal damage score was decreased compared with that in the standard chow group with decreasing intestinal permeability. By supplementing an ED with soybean oil (SO), intestinal permeability was increased to a level similar to that of the standard chow group. For this group, the intestinal damage score also increased compared with that of the ED group but did not reach the levels observed in the standard chow group. The addition of dietary proteins (using heat-denatured pancreatin) resulted in intestinal damage scores that were significantly higher than those of the ED+SO-fed group. The dietary protein increased the intestinal damage score. These results suggest that EDs control inflammation by decreasing intestinal permeability and the elimination of dietary proteins.},

AIM: To evaluate the effectiveness of home enteral nutrition as a maintenance therapy regimen in which half of the daily calorie requirement is provided by an elemental diet and the remaining half by a free diet. We refer to this home enteral nutrition therapy as 'half elemental diet'. METHODS: Between 2002 and 2005, 51 patients in remission from two hospitals were randomly assigned to a half elemental diet group (n = 26) or a free diet group (n = 25). The primary outcome measure of this study was the occurrence of relapse over the 2-year period. RESULTS: The relapse rate in the half elemental diet group was significantly lower [34.6% vs. 64.0%; multivariate hazard ratio 0.40 (95% CI: 0.16-0.98)] than that in the free diet group after a mean follow-up of 11.9 months. Compliance was similar in the two groups. No adverse event occurred in any of the patients throughout the study. CONCLUSION: This randomized-controlled trial shows the effectiveness of an half elemental diet, which is a promising maintenance therapy for Crohn's disease patients.},

However, few experiences have been reported regarding their combination therapy. The aim of the present study was to investigate the efficacy and safety of infliximab in Japanese patients, the first such study in Asia, as well as the effect of concomitant ED. METHODS: One hundred and ten consecutive patients receiving infliximab were followed up to week 16 after the last infusion, and clinical response and primary outcome were collected. A response was defined as a reduction in Harvey-Bradshaw Index for inflammatory disease and closure of fistula in fistulizing disease. RESULTS: Out of 75 inflammatory and 35 fistulizing disease patients, 68 (90.7%) and 25 (71.4%) responded at week 4, and 38 (50.7%) and 14 (40.0%) continued to respond until week 16, respectively. Interestingly, inflammatory disease patients with concurrent ED had a significantly higher response rate at week 16 (68.4%) than those without ED (32.4%, P = 0.0026). The effects of ED were independent of the usage of azathioprine and smoking habit. CONCLUSIONS: Infliximab was clinically useful in the treatment of Crohn's disease in Japanese patients as well as in those in Western countries. The efficacy of concurrent ED was suggestive and should be confirmed in a randomized controlled study.},

Thus, one of the increasingly accepted htypotheses to explain the origin of this disease, is the oxidative stress that occurs in the intestinal mucosa. Dietary factors including self administered vitamin and mineral supplements may play a role, especially when they contain excessive amounts of iron and copper, known for their prooxidant capacities. Unfortunately, little is known about how these metals may influence the antioxidant defenses in the intestinal mucosa. This article reviews the literature on the why and how these elements may act on individuals susceptible to develop Crohn disease, including the evidence supporting the hypothesis that oxidative stress in the intestinal mucosa is an important pathogenetic factor.},

   abstract = {Initial events and effector mechanisms of most inflammatory and autoimmune diseases remain largely unknown. Dysfunction of the innate and adaptive immune systems associated with mucosae (the major interface between the organism and its environment, e.g., microbiota, food) can conceivably cause impairment of mucosal barrier function and development of localized or systemic inflammatory and autoimmune processes. Animal models help in elucidating the etiology and pathogenetic mechanisms of human diseases, such as the inflammatory bowel diseases, Crohn's disease and ulcerative colitis, severe chronic diseases affecting the gut. To study the role of innate immunity and gut microbiota in intestinal inflammation, colitis was induced by dextran sulfate sodium (DSS) in mice with severe combined immunodeficiency (SCID). Conventionally reared (microflora-colonized) SCID mice displayed severe inflammation like that seen in immunocompetent Balb/c mice, whereas only minor changes appeared in the intestinal mucosa of DSS-fed gnotobiotic germ-free SCID mice. The presence of microflora facilitates the inflammation in DSS-induced colitis that develops in immunodeficient SCID mice, that is, in the absence of T and B lymphocytes. Celiac disease, a chronic autoimmune small bowel disorder, afflicts genetically susceptible individuals with wheat gluten intolerance. We showed that, in contrast with any other food proteins, wheat gliadin and its peptic fragments activate mouse macrophages and human monocytes to produce proinflammatory cytokines through the nuclear factor-kappaB signaling pathway. Activation of innate immunity cells by food proteins or components from gut microbiota thus could participate in the impairment of intestinal mucosa and the development of intestinal and/or systemic inflammation.},

   abstract = {Crohn's disease is a chronic granulomatous inflammation of the gastrointestinal tract which was first described in the beginning of the 20th century. The histological similarity with intestinal tuberculosis has led to the assumption of an involvement of mycobacteria and mycobacterial antigens, respectively, in the etiology. A major defense mechanism against mycobacterial lipid antigens is the CD1 system which includes CD1 molecules for antigen presentation and natural killer T cells for recognition and subsequent production of cytokines like interferon-gamma and tumour necrosis factor-alpha. These cytokines promote granulomatous transformation. Various food additives, especially emulsifiants, thickeners, surface-finishing agents and contaminants like plasticizers share structural domains with mycobacterial lipids. It is therefore hypothesized, that these compounds are able to stimulate by molecular mimicry the CD1 system in the gastrointestinal mucosa and to trigger the pro-inflammatory cytokine cascade. The understanding of Crohn's disease as a CD1-mediated delayed-type hypersensitivity to certain food additives would lead to strong emphasis on a dietary treatment. Related aspects of pathology, physiology and epidemiology of Crohn's disease are presented.},

Advances in biotherapy include new data on monoclonal antibodies (infliximab in ulcerative colitis, adalimumab, certolizumab pegol, fontolizumab, selective anti-adhesion molecules, and others), antisense oligonucleotides, the development of small molecules, and cell-gene therapy (including helminth ova, leukocytapheresis, stem cell transplantation, and probiotic intestinal mucosal delivery systems). However, management of inflammatory bowel disease is about more than drug therapy, dose, and timing. The goals remain induction of remission, limitation of side effects, modification of the pattern of disease, and avoidance of complications. With the cost and complexity of biotherapy, inflammatory bowel disease is emerging as a specific subspecialty.},

High-dose fish oil is associated with reductions in disease relapse and inflammatory markers, and modulates PBMC function. The effect of fish oil plus antioxidants on bone turnover and PBMC function (the production of interferon-gamma and prostaglandin E2) in Crohn's disease was investigated in a randomised-controlled trial. Patients with currently or recently raised biochemical markers of inflammation (C-reactive protein > or = 6.9 mg/l or erythrocyte sedimentation rate > or =18 mm/h) received fish oil (providing 2.7 g/d EPA and DHA) and antioxidants (vitamins A, C and E, and Se) (n 31) or placebo (n 30) for 24 weeks. Bone turnover was assessed by measuring the concentrations of urinary deoxypyridinoline (bone resorption) and serum osteocalcin (bone formation). Fish oil plus antioxidants were associated with increases in EPA, DHA Se in plasma (all P < 0.01), and with a reduction in interferon-gamma production by mitogen-stimulated PBMC, which demonstrated a negative correlation with deoxypyridinoline/creatinine:osteocalcin ratio (r - 0.33, P = 0.009). There were no differences between the groups at 24 weeks in the response of deoxypyridinoline or osteocalcin or their ratio, or in nutritional status. Dietary supplementation in Crohn's disease with high intakes of EPA and DHA, as fish oil, plus antioxidants was associated with a modulated production of interferon-gamma by PBMC but not altered indices of bone turnover.},

   abstract = {OBJECTIVE: Undernutrition has been reported in 65-75% of patients with Crohn's disease. The present study aimed at identifying the relative contribution of malnutrition-causing factors in patients with Crohn's disease in remission. METHODS: Sixteen patients with Crohn's disease (age 19-57 y) in remission (Crohn's Activity Disease Index < 150) were included in the study. Their weight was stable for >3 mo and they were off steroids. They all completed 3-d food records and concomitantly collected stools. Self-reported food records were analyzed and energy content in stools was determined by a direct bomb calorimeter. Resting energy expenditure (REE) was studied by indirect calorimetry and body composition by dual-energy X-ray absorptiometry. The study cohort was divided into two groups, with a body mass index (BMI) equal to 18.5 kg/m(2) serving as a cutoff point. RESULTS: Subjects with lower BMIs tended to have less lean body mass (P = 0.006), less bone mineral density (P = 0.006), and lower REE (P = 0.003). No correlation was found between BMI and energy intake but the percentage of malabsorption was negatively correlated with BMI (P = 0.07). When dividing the study based on a BMI of 18.5 kg/m(2), no difference was found in caloric intake or REE between groups but subjects with lower BMIs had significant prominent malabsorption compared with the others (21.1 +/- 9.8% versus 11.7 +/- 3.5%, P = 0.015). CONCLUSION: In the presence of similar energy intake, REE does not seem to contribute to lower BMI, although nutrient malabsorption is higher in malnourished patients with Crohn's disease in remission. We suggest that malabsorption be evaluated in patients with Crohn's disease who fail to gain weight during disease remission to establish their extra caloric requirements.},

   abstract = {BACKGROUND: Environmental factors are believed to trigger the onset of Crohn's disease (CD) in genetically susceptible individuals. The aim of this study was to assess environmental and familial factors that might be etiologically related to CD. METHODS: Twenty-one families with 3 or more affected first-degree relatives were studied, together with 10 matched control families. There were 74 patients with CD, 84 unaffected family members, and 59 controls. Family members were interviewed together at the parental home. A 176-item questionnaire delved into first symptoms, childhood vaccinations and diseases, food items, potable water supplies, social activities, travel, pets, and home and surrounding environment. Questions were directed specifically for 2 time-frames, childhood until age 20 and a 10-year epoch before the onset of first symptoms within a family. The possible factors linked to disease were evaluated using univariate and multivariate logistic regression. RESULTS: There were significantly more smokers in the patients and their relatives than in controls. Patients had more appendicitis during adolescence, ate less oats, rye, and bran than controls, and consumed more unpasteurized cheese. Patients drank significantly less tap water and more well water than controls. Clustering of cases in time occurred in 13 of the 21 affected families. CONCLUSIONS: The less frequent consumption of oats, rye, and bran and the more frequent eating of unpasteurized cheeses imitate potential dietary influences on gastrointestinal flora. More importantly, our data suggest that the drinking of well water represents an important risk factor for CD.},

   abstract = {BACKGROUND & AIMS: Control of Crohn's disease (CD) is important for conception and sustaining a pregnancy to term. Small series of infliximab use during pregnancy have reported favorable fetal and maternal outcomes. As a result of heightened maternal concern triggered by recent labeling changes, infliximab levels were measured in the newborn of a mother treated with infliximab. METHODS: Serum and breast milk infliximab levels were measured by enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay. RESULTS: A 32-year-old woman with treatment-refractory CD continued infliximab therapy throughout pregnancy. Five infusions of infliximab, 10 mg/kg, the last one 2 weeks before delivery, successfully controlled her symptoms. Six weeks after delivery, the breast-fed infant's serum infliximab level was 39.5 microg/mL. Infliximab was not detected in the breast milk. Serial measurements revealed a continued slow decline of the infant's infliximab levels during the following 6 months, despite resumption of breast-feeding and subsequent retreatments of the mother with infliximab. CONCLUSIONS: Clinically significant infliximab levels were detected in the offspring. High infliximab levels in the serum of this infant are likely due to placental transfer, not breast-feeding. Similar to other maternally acquired antibodies, the half-life of infliximab appears prolonged in newborns. The true short-term and long-term implications of exposure to infliximab during the newborn period are unknown. Patients and physicians must be informed about in utero exposure to infliximab and potentially other therapeutic antibodies. The timing of infusions to minimize antibody transfer to the fetus might be an important strategic consideration when therapeutic antibodies are used in pregnancy.},

   abstract = {Defensins are endogenous antibiotics with microbicidal activity against Gram-negative and Gram-positive bacteria, fungi, viruses and protozoa. In the gastrointestinal tract, defensins help regulate the composition and number of colonizing microbes, and protect the host from food-borne and water-borne pathogens. In health, the normal host relationship with the commensal luminal microbiota is beneficial, but the same commensal bacteria could have a pathogenic role in inflammatory diseases. A disturbance in antimicrobial defense, as provided by Paneth cells of the small intestine, seems to be a critical factor in the pathogenesis of ileal Crohn's disease, an inflammatory disease of the intestinal tract. The disruption of the critical balance between antimicrobial peptides and luminal bacteria might also explain other gastrointestinal infections and diseases. Elucidating the underlying mechanisms involved in the regulation and biology of defensins could open up new therapeutic avenues.},

   abstract = {Crohn's disease, a transmural inflammation of the gut, has been linked to good childhood hygiene, frequent use of antibiotics before diagnosis, adherent or invasive mucosal bacteria and a break in the tolerance of luminal bacteria. A decrease or lack of mucosal peptide antibiotics may play a central role in the etiopathogenesis of Crohn's disease. The dysregulated adaptive immune system may reflect only the primary break of the mucosal defence since the immune response is mostly directed against luminal bacteria. Crohn's disease patients with ileal involvement, as compared to controls and Crohn's disease patients without ileal disease, are characterized by a diminished expression of the ileal Paneth cell defensins. This decrease is even more pronounced in Crohn's disease patients with a mutation in the NOD2 gene, which is associated with Crohn's disease and ileal involvement. NOD2 is an intracellular peptidoglycan receptor and is expressed in Paneth cells. In contrast to ulcerative colitis, Crohn's disease of the colon is characterized by an impaired induction of human beta defensins 2 and 3. The hypothesis of an impaired mucosal antibacterial activity is also consistent with the benefit from antibiotic or probiotic treatment in certain disease states.},

The organism is shed in the feces of infected animals and can survive for protracted periods in the environment and hence could be present in catchment areas receiving agricultural runoff. A limited survey was undertaken in Northern Ireland to test for M. avium subsp. paratuberculosis in untreated water entering nine water treatment works (WTWs) over a 1-year period. Three detection methods were employed, viz., immunomagnetic separation-PCR and culture on Herrold's egg yolk medium (HEYM) and BACTEC 12B medium, the latter both supplemented with mycobactins. Of the 192 untreated water samples tested, 15 (8%) tested M. avium subsp. paratuberculosis positive by one or more of the three detection methods. M. avium subsp. paratuberculosis was successfully isolated from eight untreated water samples, three by BACTEC culture and five by culture on HEYM. Although the highest incidence of M. avium subsp. paratuberculosis was found in spring, overall, there was no statistically significant difference between the seasons. No significant correlation was found between numbers of coliforms or fecal coliforms and the presence of M. avium subsp. paratuberculosis. In general, a higher incidence of M. avium subsp. paratuberculosis was found in untreated water entering those WTWs that had a high mean water pH value over the sampling period. This work indicates the need to determine the efficacy of water treatment processes to either kill or remove M. avium subsp. paratuberculosis from untreated water and the possible risks posed by contact with recreational water sources.},

Although both patients followed a high-calorie diet combining solid foods and enteral nutrition by nasogastric tube, containing 16,000 kJ and 21,000 kJ, respectively, weight loss continued. Faecal fat excretion and basal metabolic rate were determined, but these could not explain the caloric deficit. Therefore, faecal bomb calorimetry, a measurement of total faecal energy content, was also performed, revealing a considerably higher faecal energy loss than had been calculated from faecal fat excretion; this indicates that faecal carbohydrate loss plays an important supplementary role. A stable weightwas achieved in both patients by prescribing extra food. Therefore, faecal fat excretion is an insufficient indicator of total faecal calorie loss in patients with high-output stomata and short-bowel syndrome. Bomb calorimetry may be considered as a tool to determine the remaining absorptive capacity in short-bowel patients.},

   abstract = {Crohn's disease (inflammatory bowel syndrome) is caused by gut exposure to harmful reactive oxygen species (ROS) derived from oxygen, such as the superoxide anion ((.)O(2)'), the hydroxyl radical ((.)OH) or the peroxide anion (O(2)''): the superoxide anion is generated by breakdown of oxygen-peroxidised phospholipids membranes. Crohn's disease predisposes to bowel cancer in susceptible human sub-populations. It may be preventable in these as yet unpredictable sub-populations by dietary-based intervention strategies, such as the daily consumption of appropriate quantities of soya isoflavones. These isoflavonoids are ROS-directed antioxidants, and they include the phytoestrogens, daidzin and genistin present in soya foods (consumed also in dietary supplements). Oxaliplatin is a platinum-containing Pt(II) organometallic therapeutic agent that binds to tumour DNA. Oxaliplatin may provide, therefore, a form of chemotherapy for some bowel cancers especially when administered in adjunct-chemotherapies that employ inhibitors of proliferation of the tumour cell. Such inhibitors include 5-fluorouracil, which prevents the correct replication of tumour cell DNA that is an essential prerequisite for bowel tumour growth. Furthermore, the therapeutic index for adjunct-chemotherapy with toxic inhibitors of DNA replication and expression could potentially be raised significantly by an associated dietary regime. This should include supplementation daily, per or, with antioxidant isoflavones (or other bioflavonoids) in selected cases of unresponsive cancer of the bowel, to possibly seek to trigger the pathway of apoptosis (programmed cell death) in the tumour cells preferentially.},

   abstract = {BACKGROUND: The aim of this study was to examine the impact of elemental diet on mucosal inflammation in Crohn's disease (CD), mainly by cytokine measurements. METHODS: Twenty-eight consecutive patients with active CD were treated with an elemental diet (Elental) for 4 weeks. The mucosal biopsies were obtained from the terminal ileum and large bowel before and after treatment. As a control group, mucosal biopsies were obtained from 20 patients without inflammation. Mucosal cytokine concentrations were measured by enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay. RESULTS: After treatment, clinical remission was achieved in 20 patients (71%). Endoscopic healing and improvement rates were 44% and 76% in the terminal ileum and 39% and 78% in the large bowel, respectively. Histologic healing and improvement rates were 19% and 54% in the terminal ileum and 20% and 55% in the large bowel, respectively. Before treatment, the mucosal concentrations of interleukin (IL)-1beta, IL-1 receptor antagonist (IL-1ra), IL-6, IL-8, and tumor necrosis factor-alpha in the ileum and large bowel were significantly higher than in controls. These cytokine concentrations decreased to the levels of control after treatment. IL-1ra/IL-1beta ratio in the ileum and large bowel was significantly lower than in controls before treatment. The ratio increased to the level of controls after treatment. The endoscopic and histologic healing of the mucosal inflammation was associated with a decline of the mucosal cytokines and an increase of the IL-1ra/IL-1beta ratio. CONCLUSIONS: The elemental diet (Elental) reduced mucosal cytokine production and corrected an imbalance between proinflammatory and anti-inflammatory cytokines in CD.},

   abstract = {Duodenal Crohn's disease is rare, and patients without obstruction are treated medically. We herein report one case whose duodenal Crohn's disease was successfully managed with low-speed elemental diet infusion through a nasogastric tube. A 28-year-old female developed acute duodenal Crohn's disease. Upper GI radiologic and endoscopic examinations showed a stricture in the duodenal bulb. Using the duodenal biopsy specimens, mucosal cytokine levels were measured; interleukin (IL)-1beta, IL-6, IL-8, and tumor necrosis factor-alpha levels were remarkably elevated. For initial 2 wk, powdered mesalazine was orally given but it was not effective. For the next 2 wk, she was treated with low-speed elemental diet therapy using a commercially available Elental(TM), which was infused continuously through a nasogastric tube using an infusion pump. The tip of the nasogastric tube was placed at an immediate oral side of the pylorus. The infusion speed was 10 mL/h (usual speed, 100 mL/h). After the 2-wk treatment, her symptoms were very much improved, and endoscopically, the duodenal stricture and inflammation improved. The duodenal mucosal cytokine levels remarkably decreased compared with those before the treatment. Although our experience was limited, low-speed elemental diet infusion through a nasogastric tube may be a useful treatment for acute duodenal Crohn's disease.},

   abstract = {BACKGROUND: Crohn's disease (CD) is characterized, among other features, by intestinal malabsorption of minerals, vitamins, and various food ingredients. This may cause a suboptimal peak bone mass and thereby susceptibility to osteoporosis at an early age. OBJECTIVE: Longitudinal measurement of bone in CD during active disease and during remission. DESIGN: We evaluated 24 patients with CD (16 males) 14 to 16 years of age longitudinally, every 3 months over 12 months, for disease activity. Longitudinal follow-up by quantitative ultrasound measurement using a bone sonometer (Sunlight Omnisense, Tel Aviv, Israel) that obtains axial speed of sound (SOS) was also performed. Eight of the CD patients were in remission (R-CD), characterized by accelerated weight and height gain and near-normal erythrocyte sedimentation rate and serum iron. Eight patients had active CD (A-CD), and 8 patients were under treatment with oxandrolone. RESULTS: By two-way repeated-measures analysis of variance, the change in SOS Z-score of tibia at 0, 6, and 12 months was as follows: -0.5 +/- 0.2 to -0.3 +/- 0.2, -0.6 +/- 0.2 to -1.0 +/- 0.5 and -0.6 +/- 0.2 to -0.4 +/- 0.2 in the remission, active disease, and oxandrolone-treated groups, respectively (P < 0.001). Similarly, the change in SOS Z-score of radius during the study was as follows: -0.5 +/- 0.3 to -0.6 +/- 0.3, -0.6 +/- 0.3 to -1.0 +/- 0.3 and -0.6 +/- 0.2 to -0.4 +/- 0.2 in the remission, active disease, and oxandrolone-treated groups, respectively (P < 0.001). While a small change over time in patients in remission was noted, SOS decreased in patients with active disease and increased in oxandrolone-treated patients. Despite the fact that SOS remained in the normative range in all patients, a clear deterioration was demonstrated for patients with active disease. CONCLUSIONS: We conclude that longitudinal follow-up of patients with active disease may detect an early pattern of deterioration in quality of bone.},
