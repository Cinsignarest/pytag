   abstract = {A multisite, hospital-based, case-control study examined the risk of ulcerative colitis in relation to dietary factors, smoking and drinking habits, past history of diseases, and childhood factors. Information was obtained from self-administered patient questionnaires. Study subjects included 101 ulcerative colitis patients who were 10-39 years old at the time of disease onset, which was within the previous 3 years, and 143 control subjects. Combined consumption of Western foods (bread for breakfast, butter, margarine, cheese, meats, and ham and sausage) was significantly related to an increased risk of ulcerative colitis (trend, p = 0.04). Margarine (as an individual Western food item) was positively associated with ulcerative colitis (trend, p = 0.005). There was also a tendency toward positive association of bread for breakfast with ulcerative colitis (trend, p = 0.07). The risk did not measurably vary with the consumption of typical Japanese foods, vegetables and fruits, confectioneries, or soft drinks. As compared with lifelong nonsmokers, current smokers tended to have a decreased risk of ulcerative colitis and former smokers had an increased risk. There was no association between breastfeeding in infancy and the risk of ulcerative colitis.},

   abstract = {BACKGROUND: The levels of antibodies against cow's milk proteins in ulcerative colitis (UC) were used to study whether mucosal inflammation leads to immune recognition, as a marker of enhanced permeability, of dietary proteins. A further purpose was to study the effect of proctocolectomy on the serum antibody levels against cow's milk proteins and their relation to biochemical and histologic liver abnormalities associated with ulcerative colitis. METHODS: Serum antibody levels against six cow's milk proteins, alpha-casein, alpha-lactalbumin (LA), beta-lactoglobulin A (LGA), beta-lactoglobulin B (LGB), bovine serum albumin (BSA), and whole milk powder (MP) were determined before and after (mean, 24 months) proctocolectomy in 15 patients with ulcerative colitis. Simultaneously, serum liver enzymes were analyzed. A liver biopsy specimen was also obtained at proctocolectomy. RESULTS: Before proctocolectomy IgA antibody levels were significantly increased against all antigens except BSA. Increased levels of IgM antibodies against LGA, LGB, and BSA were also detected. IgG antibodies were significantly increased only against LGA. After proctocolectomy IgA and IgM antibody levels decreased significantly (p < 0.05) against LGA, LGB, and LA, whereas IgG antibodies increased significantly (p < 0.01). In the patient group with abnormal liver histology (n = 9) the IgA antibodies to all cow's milk proteins were significantly higher (p < 0.02) than in the group with normal liver histology both before and after proctocolectomy. The IgA antibody levels showed a significant positive correlation with alanine amino-transferase and gamma-glutamyltransferase (r value from 0.460 to 0.721, p value from < 0.05 to < 0.01), but not with alkaline phosphatase. CONCLUSIONS: These results suggest that the inflamed mucosa in UC allows the antigenic contents of the bowel to escape. Proctocolectomy alters the antibody levels against certain milk proteins, which may serve as a model to suggest that proctocolectomy, probably by eliminating inflammation, may have positive effects by reducing the foreign pathogenic antigen and immune complex load.},

The subjects were eight adult men and women with terminal ileum ileostomies after ulcerative colitis. Four consecutive 24-h collections of both digesta and urine were made. On the last 2 d an antibiotic was given that suppressed microbial activity in the digesta and slightly reduced ileostomy outflow. Mean daily amino acid excretion in ileostomy fluid ranged from 32 mg/d for methionine to approximately 330 mg/d for aspartate and glutamate. These losses were compared with current international estimates of amino acid requirements. For most essential amino acids gastrointestinal losses accounted for 14-33% of daily maintenance requirements but for threonine the contribution was 61%.},

The compound was administered in the diet for 119 weeks (rats) and 120 weeks (mice) at dose levels of 100, 300 and 900/1800 mg/kg b.w./d for mice and of 300, 900 and 2700/1800 mg/kg b.w./d for rats. The administration of benzalazine produced no effects on survival, appearance or behaviour. Body weights of the high-dosed male mice and rats (both sexes) were occasionally significantly decreased when compared to the controls. A slight but in most cases statistically significant reduction of the relative food consumption of the female mice of all treated groups was observed between test weeks 6 and 12. In the high-dosed rats a statistically significant increase of the relative food consumption was found between test weeks 17 and 109. At necropsy, there was no evidence of treatment-related changes, nor were these seen on histopathological examination. All microscopic changes seen in mice and rats were of the usual type commonly occurring in untreated aged NMRI mice and Sprague-Dawley rats. However, an increased incidence of thyroid cystic hyperplasia was found in the rats of the high dose-level group. In addition, an increased incidence of thyroid adenomas was found in the male rats of the high-dosed group only as compared to the control groups. This increased tumour incidence is regarded as a marginal finding and may be of a spontaneous nature within the normal range of the background data. However, a substance-related influence cannot completely be excluded. In conclusion, the administration of benzalazine for more than 24 months to NMRI mice and Sprague-Dawley rats produced only slight effects on body weight in the high-dosed male mice and in rats (both sexes) with a no-effect level of 300 mg/kg b.w./d in the diet for mice or 900 mg/kg b.w./d in the diet for rats. There was no evidence of an oncogenic effect of benzalazine.},

Benzalazine elicited no evidence of teratogenicity when administered orally during the fetal organogenesis period to pregnant rats at doses up to 2000 mg/kg b.w./d, or to pregnant rabbits at doses up to 1000 mg/kg b.w./d. Rat fetuses in the 400 and 2000 mg/kg groups exhibited decreased body weights; the placentae weights were decreased in these dose groups, too. Rabbit fetuses in the high-dose group (1000 mg/kg b.w./d p.o.) also showed decreased body weights. Decreased body weight gain and reduced food intake were seen in rat dams in the high-dose group (2000 mg/kg b.w./d p.o.). In rabbit dams a decrease in body weight gain in the high-dose group (1000 mg/kg b.w./d p.o.) and a dose-dependent reduction in food intake from 200 mg/kg b.w./d p.o. onwards were noted. No further disturbances were observed in the behaviour of the rat and rabbit dams. External appearance, faeces, consumption of drinking water and macroscopical inspection during autopsy did not indicate any influence of the test compound. No retardations or malformations were seen even at the highest tested dose levels (rat: 2000 mg/kg b.w./d p.o.; rabbit: 1000 mg/kg b.w./d p.o.).},

After single oral application of the maximum dose of 10 g benzalazine/kg b.w. to rats no pathological findings concerning clinical signs, body weight, food consumption and macroscopical post mortem findings could be observed (LD50 > 10000 mg/kg b.w.). The 24-h LD50 values for benzalazine after single intraperitoneal application were determined as 755 mg/kg b.w. in female rats and 1200 mg/kg b.w. in male rats. The oral administration of benzalazine at 2000 mg/kg b.w./d or more for 4 weeks to rats gave rise to slight sedation, a reduction in body weight increase, increased organ weights (heart, kidneys, suprarenal glands, spleen) and dose-related histopathological findings (liver, kidneys, heart, thyroid gland, duodenum, spleen, suprarenal glands, testes). The daily dose of 500 mg benzalazine/kg b.w. for 4 weeks was without any effects under these experimental conditions. In acute local tolerance studies in rabbits, benzalazine is to be considered as a mild irritant agent for skin (employing an occlusive patch for 24 h) and eye. After a 10-day intra-rectal application of benzalazine to rabbits no substance-related changes at the application sites in the colon were observed.},

Dosages of 0 (control), 300, 900 and 2700 mg/kg b.w./d were selected for this study. Except slight changes in the urinary status (decreased pH value and increased specific gravity) from 900 mg/kg b.w./d p.o. onwards, which were probably substance related, no further intolerance reactions were observed. The urine had a dark-yellow colour which was probably an indication of metabolites of benzalazine or benzalazine itself which were excreted via the urine. Behaviour, external appearance, body weight gain, food and water consumption, haematology, clinical biochemistry, organ weight analysis, macroscopic and microscopic examinations revealed no substance-related influence. Therefore, on the basis of the results obtained, it is concluded that the non-toxic dose level in this study is considered to be 300 mg benzalazine/kg b.w./d p.o. following daily administration for 26 weeks.},

The follow-up of 15 months was complicated by Rotavirus infection. Two relapses were caused by Clostridium difficile infections. The latter were successfully treated with oral vancomycine, but in the last relapse an increased dosage of prednisone was required, too. In relapses of inflammatory bowel disease gastrointestinal infections, especially caused by Clostridium difficile should be considered and treated adequately.},

The etiology of mucosal dysplasia, a premalignant lesion that is used as a screening test in surveillance programs, is unknown. Previously, a case-control study [Lashner et al. (1989) Gastroenterology 97:255-259] suggested that folate supplementation was associated with a 62% reduction in the risk of developing dysplasia or cancer. The current case-control study was performed to obtain a better definition of this risk. All 67 patients with chronic ulcerative pancolitis having surveillance colonoscopy during a 1-year period were entered. There were 6 cases (4 with dysplasia and 2 with cancer) and 61 controls (no cancer or dysplasia). Red blood cell folate, reflecting intermediate-term stores, was a mean of 66.2 ng/ml lower in cases compared to controls. Serum folate, reflecting short-term stores, was not different between groups. Adjusting for confounding effects of age, sex, race, disease duration, and folate supplementation, the risk of dysplasia or cancer was significantly decreased by 18% for each 10 ng/ml increase in red blood cell folate (odds ratio 0.82, 95% confidence interval 0.68-0.99). Vitamins A, D, and E and carotene were lower in cases than in controls, but no water-soluble vitamin other than red blood cell folate was associated with an increased cancer risk. Depressed red blood cell folate is associated with an increased risk of dysplasia and cancer in patients with ulcerative colitis and may be a risk factor for neoplastic transformation.},

   abstract = {Abnormal intestinal crypt cell proliferation is considered to be an important early risk marker for colorectal cancer but measurement of the rate and spatial distribution of cell division by histochemical localization of DNA synthesis is labour-intensive and expensive. We developed and evaluated a simpler technique for measurement of these parameters using direct visual analysis of mitotic figures in microdissected crypts. The direct crypt analysis technique was applied to colorectal biopsies from patients with ulcerative colitis or no mucosal abnormality. A characteristic shift of cell division toward the intestinal lumen was detected in patients with ulcerative colitis. The direct method was validated using rats fed diets containing cellulose, or guar gum to stimulate mucosal cell proliferation. The crypt cell proliferation rate (CCPR) was measured by the metaphase-arrest technique and the results were compared with direct crypt analysis. There was a fivefold range of CCPR values at three sampling sites across the dietary groups. An excellent linear correlation between the results by the two techniques was obtained (r = 0.98; P < 0.001). In a second experiment the spatial distribution of dividing cells between five zones in colonic crypts, determined by the new method or by staining with BrdU, was compared. Good agreement was again achieved. Visual analysis of intact crypts is a valid technique for the measurement of crypt cell cytokinetics and it is particularly suited for use in a clinical environment.},

In both the original case and in the experimental pigs, the typhlocolitis was characterised by microabscesses of the lamina propria, frequently involving ulceration or erosion of the surface epithelium. The organism was of serotype IIa, which has not been isolated previously from pigs in the United Kingdom.

   abstract = {Verotoxin-producing strains of Escherichia coli (VTEC), in particular serotype O157:H7, are now recognised as the major cause of haemorrhagic colitis and the haemolytic uraemic syndrome (HUS) in the U.K. and in North America, and increasingly so in other countries. Over a 3-year period (1989-1991), 16 cases of E. coli 0157 infection occurred in one town (Peterhead) in north-east Grampian. Four patients required admission to hospital, of whom three developed HUS. The bovine source of VTEC infection has now been clearly established with foodborne, waterborne, person-to-person and zoonotic transmission described. Despite extensive local enquiries, the source(s) of infection of the 16 cases in Peterhead was not established. Much still needs to be learned about the epidemiology, risk factors and long-term clinical sequelae of VTEC infection and HUS. Close collaboration between the medical and veterinary professions is of paramount importance in order to provide better understanding of the prevalence of E. coli O157 infection in cattle and the route(s) of transmission to humans.},

Prevention of complement activation by Lf was confirmed in a haemolytic assay. Antibodies (IgG) against human Lf were studied by ELISA in sera from patients with Crohn's disease, ulcerative colitis, primary sclerosing cholangitis, rheumatoid arthritis, systemic lupus erythematous and primary Sjogren's syndrome. Anti-Lf antibodies were found in high frequency in ulcerative colitis and primary sclerosing cholangitis, but only occasionally in the other conditions.},

   abstract = {In the irritable bowel syndrome gastrointestinal tract motility is disturbed from the esophagus to the colon, causing pain and altered function. When colonic motility is abnormal, the patient can experience either constipation or diarrhea in addition to abdominal pain and bloating. In constipated patients the postprandial colonic motility can increase normally after eating or the colon can remain motionless. Generally propagating contractions are absent in patients with constipation predominant irritable bowel syndrome. Propagating contractions are increased in frequency in patients with diarrhea, although the phasic contractions are decreased. Questionnaires discriminate between patients with structural disease such as ulcerative colitis and patients with functional disease, however they cannot differentiate between the different subgroups of patients with constipation predominant irritable bowel syndrome. Treatment strategies are beginning to focus on the underlying pathophysiologic abnormality.},

Carbohydrate-induced diarrhea occurs when the amount of carbohydrate entering the colon exceeds its fermentation capacity. Deficient availability or utilization of SCFA, mainly of n-butyrate, is the cause of diversion colitis and may play important roles in colonic carcinogenesis, in starvation and enterotoxigenic diarrhea, and in idiopathic UC.},

In our studies it was found that in two-thirds of patients with ulcerative colitis clinical reactions after meal occurred, in 54% atopy coexisted, and immunological abnormalities occurred more frequently than in the control group. Our studies proved that the role of various reactions to consumed meal, including early allergic reactions, cannot be rejected with full certainty. A number of indirect evidence that type I allergy according to Gell and Coombs, and immunological abnormalities participated in the pathological mechanism of that disease was also found.},
