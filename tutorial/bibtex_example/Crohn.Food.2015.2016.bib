   abstract = {We aim to review the literature and provide guidance on preventive health measures in inflammatory bowel disease (IBD). Structured searches were performed in PubMed, MEDLINE, EMBASE, Web of Science and Cochrane Library from January 1976 to June 2016 using the following keywords: (inflammatory bowel disease OR Crohn's disease OR ulcerative colitis) AND (health maintenance OR preventive health OR health promotion). Abstracts of the articles selected from each of these multiple searches were reviewed, and those meeting the inclusion criteria (that is, providing data regarding preventive health or health maintenance in IBD patients) were recorded. Reference lists from the selected articles were manually reviewed to identify further relevant studies. Patients with IBD are at increased risk of developing adverse events related to the disease course, therapeutic interventions, or non-adherence to medication. Recent studies have suggested that IBD patients do not receive preventive services with the same thoroughness as patients with other chronic diseases. Preventive health measures can avert morbidity and improve the quality of life of patients with IBD. Gastroenterologists and primary care physicians (PCPs) should have an up to date working knowledge of preventive health measures for IBD patients. A holistic approach and better communication between gastroenterologists and PCPs with explicit clarification of roles will prevent duplication of services and streamline care.},

   abstract = {Recent advances have shown that the abnormal inflammatory response observed in CD involves an interplay among intestinal microbiota, host genetics and environmental factors. The escalating consumption of fat and sugar in Western countries parallels an increased incidence of CD during the latter 20(th) century. The impact of a HF/HS diet in mice was evaluated for the gut micro-inflammation, intestinal microbiota composition, function and selection of an E. coli population. The HF/HS diet created a specific inflammatory environment in the gut, correlated with intestinal mucosa dysbiosis characterized by an overgrowth of pro-inflammatory Proteobacteria such as E. coli, a decrease in protective bacteria, and a significantly decreased of SCFA concentrations. The expression of GPR43, a SCFA receptor was reduced in mice treated with a HF/HS diet and reduced in CD patients compared with controls. Interestingly, mice treated with an agonist of GPR43 were protected against DSS-induced colitis. Finally, the transplantation of feces from HF/HS treated mice to GF mice increased susceptibility to AIEC infection. Together, our results demonstrate that a Western diet could aggravate the inflammatory process and that the activation of the GPR43 receptor pathway could be used as a new strategy to treat CD patients.},

   abstract = {There is strong evidence indicating that inflammatory bowel disease (IBD) is increasing among black and minority ethnic (BME) communities. Despite this rise in prevalence, there is a paucity of research relating to ethnicity and IBD outside the USA. Furthermore, the symptoms of IBD are reported to start during childhood or adolescence in 20-25% of people with the condition. It is therefore important that young people's experiences of diagnosis, treatment and living with IBD are fully understood to ensure effective services and information provision. The study reported on in this paper was commissioned by a UK charity (Crohn's and Colitis UK) with the aim of increasing understanding of the specific issues and service needs of young people with IBD from BME communities. Empirical research entailed in-depth semi-structured interviews with 20 young people from BME groups accessed through gastroenterology departments at three collaborating NHS hospitals in England serving ethnically diverse populations. Interviews were carried out from June to December 2010 and sought to capture young people's views with IBD. A thematic analysis of their experiences identified many commonalities with other young people with IBD, such as the problematic route to formal diagnosis and the impact of IBD on education. The young people also experienced tensions between effective self-management strategies and cultural norms and practices relating to food. Moreover, the ability of parents to provide support was hampered for some young people by the absence of culturally competent services that were responsive to the families' communication needs. The findings highlight the need for more culturally appropriate information concerning IBD, and improved responsiveness to young people with IBD within primary care and the education system, as well as culturally competent messaging relating to the specific nature of the condition among the wider South Asian and black communities.},

   abstract = {Dendritic cells present in the digestive tract are constantly exposed to environmental antigens, commensal flora, and invading pathogens. Under steady-state conditions, these cells have high tolerogenic potential, triggering differentiation of regulatory T cells to protect the host from unwanted proinflammatory immune responses to innocuous antigens or commensals. On the other hand, these cells must discriminate between commensal flora and invading pathogens and mount powerful immune response against pathogens. A potential result of unbalanced tolerogenic versus proinflammatory responses mediated by dendritic cells is associated with chronic inflammatory conditions, such as Crohn's disease, ulcerative colitis, food allergies, and celiac disease. Herein, we review the dendritic cell population involved in mediating tolerance and immunity in mucosal surfaces, the progress in unveiling their development in vivo, and factors that can influence their functions.},

   abstract = {BACKGROUND AND AIMS: Ulcerative colitis [UC] is associated with colonic mucosa barrier defects and bacterial dysbiosis, but these features may simply be the result of inflammation. Therefore, we sought to assess whether these features are inherently abrogated in the terminal ileum [TI] of UC patients, where inflammation is absent. METHODS: TI biopsies from paediatric inflammatory bowel disease [IBD] subsets [Crohn's disease [CD; n = 13] and UC [n = 10]], and non-IBD disease controls [n = 12] were histologically graded, and alcian blue/periodic acid-Schiff stained biopsies were quantified. The mucosal barrier was assessed for mucin [MUC2], immunoglobulin [Ig]A, IgG, and total bacteria (fluorescence in-situ hybridisation [FISH probe EUB338]) by immunofluorescence. The regulation of mucin secretion was investigated by NLRP6 gene expression and immunofluorescence. The composition of the active mucosa-associated microbiota was explored by sequencing the 16S rRNA amplicon generated from total RNA. RESULTS: Despite the absence of ileitis, UC patients displayed ileal barrier depletion illustrated by reductions in mucin-containing goblet cells and mucin production and altered epithelial NLRP6 expression. In both CD patients with ileitis and UC patients with normal histology, bacteria coated with IgA and IgG penetrated the TI mucin layer. Biopsy 16S rRNA sequencing revealed a reduction in alpha-diversity by three methods [Shannon, Simpson, and Equitability indices] between UC and non-IBD paediatric patients. CONCLUSIONS: These findings suggest an underlying defect in the UC-afflicted intestinal tract even in the absence of inflammation, implicating barrier and microbial changes as primary abnormalities in UC that may play a causative role in disease development.},

   abstract = {OBJECTIVES: Discuss issues regarding clinical trial design for the development of biosimilars in the European Union and the United States, with special focus on monoclonal antibodies used in the treatment of inflammatory diseases. METHODS: A search of the Internet as well as PubMed was conducted through June 2014 for information related to the clinical development of biosimilars using the keywords biosimilar, rheumatoid arthritis, juvenile idiopathic arthritis, psoriasis, psoriatic arthritis, Crohn's disease, ulcerative colitis, and ankylosing spondylitis. The European Medicines Agency (EMA) and the US Food and Drug Administration (FDA) websites were searched for biosimilar guidelines. RESULTS: The EMA began issuing draft guidelines for the development of biosimilars almost a decade ago and has approved numerous biosimilars. The US FDA has issued draft guidances providing stepwise considerations for the nonclinical and clinical development of biosimilars but has yet to approve a biosimilar under this pathway. CONCLUSIONS: Clinical trials aim to resolve uncertainties that may remain following nonclinical development regarding the similarity of the proposed biosimilar with the reference product. Pharmacokinetic and pharmacodynamic studies form the backbone of early clinical development and serve to inform phase 3 clinical development. Factors to be considered in clinical development include study population, design, end points, sample size, duration, and analytical methods.},

   abstract = {Mycobacterium avium subspecies paratuberculosis (M. paratuberculosis) is the causative agent of paratuberculosis, or Johne's disease, in cattle, with potential involvement in cases of Crohn's disease in humans. Johne's disease is found worldwide and is economically important for both beef and dairy industries. In an effort to characterize this important infection in Egypt, we analysed the ecological and genomic features of recent isolates of M. paratuberculosis. In this report, we examined 26 Holstein dairy herds distributed throughout Egypt, from 2010 to 2013. Using PCR analysis of faecal samples, we estimated a mean herd-level prevalence of 65.4 %, with animal-level infection that reached a mean of 13.6 % among animals suffering from diarrhoea. Whole genome sequencing of field isolates identified numerous single nucleotide polymorphisms among field isolates relative to the standard M. paratuberculosis K10 genome. Interestingly, the virulence of M. paratuberculosis isolates from Egypt revealed diverse virulence phenotypes in the murine model of paratuberculosis, with significant differences in tissue colonization, particularly during the chronic stage of infection. Overall, our analysis confirmed that Johne's disease is a newly identified problem in Egypt and indicated that M. paratuberculosis has potentially diverse genotypes that impact its virulence. Further ecological mapping and genomic analysis of M. paratuberculosis will enhance our understanding of the transmission and evolutionary dynamics of this pathogen under natural field conditions.},

   abstract = {BACKGROUND: Diet plays a role in the pathogenesis of Crohn's disease (CD) and ulcerative colitis (UC). Dietary zinc may influence risk of disease through effects on autophagy, innate and adaptive immune response and maintenance of the intestinal barrier. METHODS: We analysed data from 170 776 women from the Nurses Health Study I and Nurses Health Study II, who were followed for 26 years. Zinc intake was assessed using semi-quantitative food frequency questionnaires administered every 4 years. Incident CD and UC were ascertained by medical record review. Cox proportional hazards models adjusting for potential confounders determined the independent association between zinc intake and incident disease. RESULTS: Over 3 317 550 person-years (p-y) of follow-up, we identified 269 incident cases of CD and 338 incident cases of UC. Zinc intake ranged from 9 mg/day in the lowest quintile to 27 mg/day in the highest quintile. Compared with women with the lowest quintile of intake, the multivariate hazard ratios (HR) for CD were 0.92 [95% confidence interval (CI), 0.65 - 1.29) for women in the second quintile of intake, 0.60 (95% CI, 0.40 - 0.89) for the third quintile, 0.57 (95% CI, 0.38 - 0.86) for fourth quintile and 0.74 (95% CI, 0.50 - 1.10) for the highest quintile (Ptrend = 0.003). The association was stronger for dietary zinc (HR 0.63, 95% CI, 0.43 - 0.93, comparing extreme quintiles) than for zinc intake from supplements. Neither dietary nor supplemental zinc modified risk of UC. CONCLUSIONS: In two large prospective cohorts of women, intake of zinc was inversely associated with risk of CD but not UC.},

   abstract = {BACKGROUND: Diet may play an important role in the pathogenesis of Crohn's disease (CD) and ulcerative colitis (UC); yet, there are few prospective studies of dietary factors. None have examined the association between adolescent diet and risk of inflammatory bowel diseases (CD and UC). METHODS: This study included women enrolled in Nurses' Health Study II who completed a validated high school dietary questionnaire in 1998. We examined the effect of dietary patterns (prudent or Western diet) and individual components of each patterns. We documented incident cases of CD and UC through 2011 based on physician review of medical records and used Cox proportional hazards models adjusting for confounders to estimate hazard ratios and confidence intervals for CD and UC. RESULTS: Over 763,229 person-years of follow-up, we identified 70 incident cases of CD and 103 cases of UC. Compared with women in the lowest quartile of a prudent diet score (characterized by greater intake of fruits, vegetables, and fish), women in the highest quartile had a 53% lower risk of CD (hazard ratio, 0.47; 95% confidence interval, 0.23-0.98; P trend = 0.04). Specifically, greater intake of fish (P trend = 0.01) and fiber (P trend = 0.06) were associated with lower risk of CD. In contrast, Western diet score was not associated with risk of CD. Neither dietary patterns nor individual food or nutrient groups was associated with UC. CONCLUSIONS: Adolescent diet is associated with risk of CD, but not UC, offering insights into disease pathogenesis.},

   abstract = {BACKGROUND AND AIMS: Prebiotic inulin-type fructans are widely consumed in the diet and may have contrasting effects in Crohn's disease by stimulating gut microbiota and/or by generating functional gastrointestinal symptoms. The aim of this study was to measure fructan and oligofructose intakes in patients with active and inactive Crohn's disease compared with healthy controls. METHODS: Patients with active Crohn's disease (n = 98), inactive Crohn's (n = 99) and healthy controls (n = 106) were recruited to a case-control study. Dietary intake of inulin-type fructans was measured using a specific food frequency questionnaire and was compared between the three groups and between patients with different disease phenotypes (Montreal classification). Associations between intakes and disease activity (Harvey-Bradshaw Index, HBI) were also undertaken. RESULTS: Patients with active Crohn's disease had lower fructan intakes (median 2.9 g/d, interquartile range [IQR] 1.8) than those with inactive Crohn's (3.6 g/d, 2.1, p = 0.036) or controls (3.9 g/d, 2.1, p = 0.003) and lower oligofructose intakes (2.8 g/d, 1.8) than those with inactive Crohn's (3.5 g/d, 2.2, p = 0.048) or controls (3.8 g/d, 2.1, p = 0.003). There were no differences in intakes related to disease site or behaviour. There were negative correlations between HBI well-being score and fructan intake (rho = -0.154, p = 0.03) and oligofructose intake (rho = -0.156, p = 0.028) and for the HBI abdominal pain score and fructan (rho = -0.164, p = 0.021) and oligofructose intake (rho = -0.157, p = 0.027). CONCLUSIONS: Patients with active Crohn's disease consume lower quantities of fructans and oligofructose than their inactive counterparts and healthy controls. The impact of lower intakes of prebiotic fructans on gut microbiota is unknown and warrants further research.},

The Food and Drug Administration has classified these factors in category B, which means that they do not demonstrate a fetal risk. However, during pregnancy fetuses are exposed to high anti-tumor necrosis factor (TNF) levels that are measurable in their plasma after birth. Since antibodies can transfer through the placenta at the end of the second and during the third trimesters, it is important to know the safety profile of these drugs, particularly for the fetus, and whether maintaining relapse of the disease compensates for the potential risks of fetal exposure. The limited data available for the anti-TNF drugs to date have not demonstrated any significant adverse outcomes in the pregnant women who continued their therapy from conception to the first trimester of gestation. However, data suggest that anti-TNFs should be discontinued during the third trimester, as they may affect the immunological system of the newborn baby. Each decision should be individualized, based on the distinct characteristics of the patient and her disease. Considering all the above, there is a need for more clinical studies regarding the effect of anti-TNF therapeutic agents on pregnancy outcomes.},

Determining the appropriate equation for different patient types, however, remains inconclusive, as in the case of Japanese children with Crohn's disease (CD). The aim of this study was to identify an appropriate predictive equation for measuring REE in Japanese children with CD. METHODS: Twelve Japanese children with CD managed at the National Center for Child Health and Development in Tokyo, Japan, were studied. REE (kcal/day) was measured using indirect calorimetry. The predictive equations used were the Japanese Dietary Reference Intakes (2010), the Schofield equation, the Food and Agriculture Organization/World Health Organization/United Nations University (FAO/WHO/UNU) equation and the Cunningham equation. Difference between predicted and measured REE was analyzed on Bland-Altman plot. RESULTS: Japanese Dietary Reference Intakes (2010) had the smallest difference between predicted and measured REE. Weight was the primary predictor of REE on multiple regression analysis. As well, Japanese Dietary Reference Intakes (2010) had the highest ratio of weight to predicted REE (98.5%). CONCLUSIONS: Of the four equations, Japanese Dietary Reference Intakes (2010) appeared to be the most practical and accurate predictive equation for REE in Japanese children with CD.},

Breast milk samples were collected over a 50-day period after the patient's first drug infusion. The average concentration of natalizumab was 0.93 microg/mL/d, and the relative infant dose was 1.74% of the weight-adjusted maternal dose. Transfer of natalizumab into human milk increased over time and with subsequent injections, with the highest concentration of 2.83 microg/mL at day 50 with a relative infant dose of 5.3%. Because these data suggest continued accumulation of natalizumab in milk, and because we cannot provide an accurate assessment of levels of this drug at 24 weeks (steady state), we are unable to determine safety at this time.},

   abstract = {Ulcerative colitis and Crohn's disease are two major forms of the inflammatory bowel diseases (IBDs). Vitamin A (VA) and vitamin D (VD) may be associated with reduction in inflammation in these disorders. The aim of this review was to show the current evidence that may associate VA and VD with IBDs. Data linking VA, VD, and IBDs were studied. Both VA and VD may be related to the immune system in different manners. The active form of VA, retinoic acid, may be related to the growth factor-beta and release of interleukin-10 (IL-10), thus involved with the resolution of the inflammation. Its deficiency is associated with the increase of disease activity. The active form of VD is 1,25(OH)2D3 that produces biological effects via the nuclear hormone receptor named VD receptor (VDR), which may interfere with the immune cells and macrophages leading to the suppression of the inflammatory process by decreasing the release of TNF-alpha, IL-1, IL-6, and IL-8, IL-12, and IL-23. VDR may also activate nucleotide-binding oligomerization domain 2 expression and stimulate the production of the defensin and cathelicidin that are important to the homeostasis of the mucosal immune barrier. The use of VA and VD could be helpful in the treatment and prevention of IBDs but more studies are necessary to establish the precise role of these compounds in the prevention or remission of these inflammatory processes.},

   abstract = {Adjuvants to the traditional therapy of inflammatory bowel disease (IBD) have been studied to enhance the efficacy of the treatment and improve patients' quality of life. Omega-3 polyunsaturated fatty acids (omega3FA) have been associated with attenuation of the inflammatory responses in IBD, possibly acting as substrates for anti-inflammatory eicosanoid production, similar to prostaglandins and leukotrienes. omega3FA also act as substrates for the synthesis of resolvins, maresins and protectins, indispensable in resolving inflammation processes. These acids may influence the development or course of IBD by: reducing oxidative stress, production of tumor necrosis factor-alpha and proinflammatory cytokines; working as chemopreventive agents; and decreasing the expression of adhesion molecules. There are numerous controversies in the literature on the effects of omega3FA in the prevention or treatment of IBD, but their effects in reducing inflammation is incontestable. Therefore, more studies are warranted to elucidate the pathophysiological mechanisms and establish the recommended daily intake to prevent or induce remission in IBD patients.},

Meta-analysis of several randomized controlled trials have confirmed benefit for the administration of Lactobacillus rhamnosus GG and Saccharomyces boulardii to prevent antibiotic-associated diarrhea and to treat acute infectious diarrhea. Individual studies have also suggested benefit of probiotics to prevent acute gastroenteritis and serve as an adjunct in ulcerative colitis, pouchitis, antibiotic-associated diarrhea, CDI, functional abdominal pain, irritable bowel syndrome, and colic in breastfed babies. Although promising, larger well-designed studies need to confirm these findings. There is currently insufficient evidence to recommend probiotics for the treatment of constipation-predominant irritable bowel syndrome or Crohn's disease.},

   abstract = {Numerous reviews have discussed gut microbiota composition changes during inflammatory bowel diseases (IBD), particularly Crohn's disease (CD). However, most studies address the observed effects by focusing on studying the univariate connection between disease and dietary-induced alterations to gut microbiota composition. The possibility that these effects may reflect a number of other interconnected (i.e., pantropic) mechanisms, activated in parallel, particularly concerning various bacterial metabolites, is in the process of being elucidated. Progress seems, however, hampered by various difficult-to-study factors interacting at the mucosal level. Here, we highlight some of such factors that merit consideration, namely: (1) the contribution of host genetics and diet in altering gut microbiome, and in turn, the crosstalk among secondary metabolic pathways; (2) the interdependence between the amount of dietary fat, the fatty acid composition, the effects of timing and route of administration on gut microbiota community, and the impact of microbiota-derived fatty acids; (3) the effect of diet on bile acid composition, and the modulator role of bile acids on the gut microbiota; (4) the impact of endogenous and exogenous intestinal micronutrients and metabolites; and (5) the need to consider food associated toxins and chemicals, which can introduce confounding immune modulating elements (e.g., antioxidant and phytochemicals in oils and proteins). These concepts, which are not mutually exclusive, are herein illustrated paying special emphasis on physiologically inter-related processes.},

   abstract = {Inflammatory bowel disease, which includes Crohn's disease and ulcerative colitis, is a chronic, relapsing and remitting set of conditions characterized by an excessive inflammatory response leading to the destruction of the gastrointestinal tract. While the exact etiology of inflammatory bowel disease remains unclear, increasing evidence suggests that the human gastrointestinal microbiome plays a critical role in disease pathogenesis. Manipulation of the gut microbiome has therefore emerged as an attractive alternative for both prophylactic and therapeutic intervention against inflammation. Despite its growing popularity among patients, review of the current literature suggests that the adult microbiome is a highly stable structure resilient to short-term interventions. In fact, most evidence to date demonstrates that therapeutic agents targeting the microflora trigger rapid changes in the microbiome, which then reverts to its pre-treatment state once the therapy is completed. Based on these findings, our ability to treat inflammatory bowel disease through short-term manipulations of the human microbiome may only have a transient effect. Thus, this review is intended to highlight the use of various therapeutic options, including diet, pre- and probiotics, antibiotics and fecal microbiota transplant, to manipulate the microbiome, with specific attention to the alterations made to the microflora along with the duration of impact.},

   abstract = {Mast cells are constitutively found in the gastrointestinal (GI) tract. The three major physiological functions of GI mast cells comprise of - as far as we know - regulation of GI functions, namely epithelial and endothelial functions, crosstalk with the enteric nervous system, and contribution to the host defense against bacterial, viral and parasitic agents. A number of chronic GI diseases, including inflammatory bowel disease (Crohn's disease, ulcerative colitis), celiac disease, irritable bowel syndrome, and food allergies, are thought to be associated with mast cell hyperplasia and humoral activity. Clinical conditions characterized by a decrease in mast cell functionality are not known so far. In the present review, we summarize current evidence which show that human mast cells play a central role at the GI barrier, both in health and disease.},

   abstract = {The association of carboxymethyl starch (CMS) and alginate is proposed as a novel matrix for the entrapment of bioactive agents in microspheres affording their protection against gastrointestinal degradation. In this study, the enzyme diamine oxidase (DAO) from white pea (Lathyrus sativus) was immobilized by inclusion in microspheres formed by ionotropic gelation of CMS/alginate by complexation with Ca(2+) . The association of CMS to alginate generated a more compact structure presenting a lesser porosity, thus decreasing the access of gastric fluid inside the microspheres and preventing the loss of entrapped enzyme. Moreover, the immobilized enzyme remained active and was able to oxidize the polyamine substrates even in the presence of degrading proteases of pancreatin. The inclusion yield in terms of entrapped protein was of about 82%-95%. The DAO entrapped in calcium CMS/alginate beads retained up to 70% of its initial activity in simulated gastric fluid (pH 2.0). In simulated intestinal fluid (pH 7.2) with pancreatin, an overall retention of 65% of activity for the immobilized DAO was observed over 24 H, whereas in similar conditions the free enzyme was totally inactivated. Our project proposes the vegetal DAO as an antihistaminic agent orally administered to treat food histaminosis and colon inflammation.},

   abstract = {BACKGROUND: Disappearance of macroscopic mucosal inflammation predicts long-term outcome in Crohn's disease (CD). It can be assessed by ileocolonoscopy, which is, however, an invasive and expensive procedure. Disease activity indices do not correlate well with endoscopic activity and noninvasive markers have a low sensitivity in subgroups of patients. Volatile organic compounds (VOCs) in breath are of increasing interest as noninvasive markers. The aim of this study was to investigate whether VOCs can accurately differentiate between active CD and remission. METHODS: Patients participated in a 1-year follow-up study and Harvey-Bradshaw index, blood, fecal, and breath samples were collected at regular intervals. Patients were stratified into 2 groups: active (fecal calprotectin >250 microg/g) or inactive (Harvey-Bradshaw index <4, C-reactive protein <5 mg/L, and fecal calprotectin <100 microg/g) disease. Breath samples were analyzed by gas chromatography-time-of-flight mass spectrometry. Random forest analyses were used to find the most discriminatory VOCs. RESULTS: Eight hundred thirty-five breath-o-grams were measured, 140 samples were assigned as active, 135 as inactive disease, and 110 samples of healthy controls. A set of 10 discriminatory VOCs correctly predicted active CD in 81.5% and remission in 86.4% (sensitivity 0.81, specificity 0.80, AUC 0.80). These VOCs were combined into a single disease activity score that classified disease activity in more than 60% of the previously undetermined individuals. CONCLUSIONS: We showed that VOCs can separate healthy controls and patients with active CD and CD in remission in a real-life cohort. Analysis of exhaled air is an interesting new noninvasive application for monitoring mucosal inflammation in inflammatory bowel disease.},

   abstract = {AIM: To evaluate the potential association between mild duodenal damage and microscopic colitis (MC). METHODS: We retrospectively included 105 consecutive patients with type I Marsh-Oberhuber duodenal damage and negativity for immunoglobulin A anti-endomysium and anti-tissue transglutaminase. The following parameters were analyzed: Sex, age at execution of esophagogastroduodenoscopy, duodenal damage, and number of intraepithelial lymphocytes at biopsies, prevalence of Helicobacter pylori infection, age at execution of colonoscopy, macroscopic and microscopic features of colonoscopy, family history of gastrointestinal and autoimmune diseases, smoking habits, biochemical parameters of inflammation and autoimmunity, use of proton pump inhibitors or nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drugs, adverse reactions to drugs or foods, pathologies known to be associated with celiac disease or MC, living on a gluten-free diet or on a gluten-low diet for at least 1 mo. RESULTS: Colonoscopy was performed in 59 patients, but only in 48 of them biopsies were taken in the entire colon. Considering the latter cohort, the diagnosis of MC was met in 25 (52.1%) patients while in 18 patients other pathologic findings were reported: 13 (27%) cases of nonspecific inflammatory bowel disease, 2 (4.2%) cases of Crohn's disease, 2 (4.2%) cases of eosinophilic gastroenteritis, and 1 (2.1%) case of autoimmune enteritis. Five (10.4%) patients had a normal colonoscopic result. Matching the groups by age, and considering only patients who underwent colonoscopy (42.7 +/- 15.5 years) vs those who did not undergo colonoscopy (36.9 +/- 10.6 years), a statistical difference was found (P = 0.039). Focusing on symptoms, diarrhea was statistically more prevalent in MC group than in patients who did not undergo colonoscopy (P = 0.03). CONCLUSION: Mild duodenal damage is associated with MC in more than half of the cases. This association supports the hypothesis of a link between these two entities.},

   abstract = {BACKGROUND & AIMS: Chronic inflammatory bowel diseases (IBDs) have been associated with an abnormal mucosal response to the gastrointestinal microbiota. Although dietary fiber affects the gastrointestinal microbiota, there is limited information on the role of fiber on IBD activity. We investigated factors associated with fiber consumption and whether it was associated with flares in patients with IBD. METHODS: We collected a completed 26-item dietary survey from 1619 participants in the Crohn's and Colitis Foundation of America Partners Internet cohort (Crohn's disease, 1130; ulcerative colitis/indeterminate colitis, 489). Eligible individuals were in remission based on disease activity index at baseline and completed a follow-up survey 6 months later. Fiber and whole grain consumption were categorized into quartiles and deciles. Disease flare at 6 months was defined as a disease activity index score exceeding remission cutoff values, and/or an IBD-related surgical procedure or hospitalization since baseline. RESULTS: Participants with longer duration of disease, past history of surgery, and past IBD hospitalization ate less fiber. The risks for disease flare differed by disease type. Compared with those in the lowest quartile of fiber consumption, participants with Crohn's disease in the highest quartile were less likely to have a flare (adjusted odds ratios [OR], 0.58; 95% confidence interval [CI], 0.37-0.90). Participants with Crohn's disease who reported that they did not avoid high-fiber foods were approximately 40% less likely to have a disease flare than those who avoided high-fiber foods (adjusted OR, 0.59; 95% CI, 0.43-0.81). There was no association between fiber intake and flares in patients with ulcerative colitis (adjusted OR, 1.82; 95% CI, 0.92-3.60). CONCLUSIONS: Intake of dietary fiber is associated with reduced disease flares in patients with Crohn's disease, but not UC. Recommendations to limit dietary fiber should be re-evaluated.},

   abstract = {AIM: To investigate the specific carbohydrate diet (SCD) as nutritional therapy for maintenance of remission in pediatric Crohn's disease (CD). METHODS: Retrospective chart review was conducted in 11 pediatric patients with CD who initiated the SCD as therapy at time of diagnosis or flare. Two groups defined as SCD simple (diet alone, antibiotics or 5-ASA) or SCD with immunomodulators (corticosteroids and/or stable thiopurine dosing) were followed for one year and compared on disease characteristics, laboratory values and anthropometrics. RESULTS: The mean age at start of the SCD was 11.8 +/- 3.0 years (range 6.6-17.6 years) with five patients starting the SCD within 5 wk of diagnosis. Three patients maintained a strict SCD diet for the study period and the mean time for liberalization was 7.7 +/- 4.0 mo (range 1-12) for the remaining patients. In both groups, hematocrit, albumin and ESR values improved while on strict SCD and appeared stable after liberalization (P-value 0.006, 0.002, 0.002 respectively). The majority of children gained in weight and height percentile while on strict SCD, with small loss in weight percentile documented with liberalization. CONCLUSION: Disease control may be attainable with the SCD in pediatric CD. Further studies are needed to assess adherence, impact on mucosal healing and growth.},

Formalin-fixed paraffin sections of large intestine from one dog demonstrated the presence of Escherichia coli strain LF82 by immunohistochemistry and 16S ribosomal RNA gene sequencing. E coli strain LF82 has been implicated in the pathogenesis of Crohn's disease and similar bacteria have been cultured from cases of histiocytic ulcerative colitis in Boxer dogs. Spontaneous histiocytic ulcerative colitis must be differentiated from test article-related findings in nonclinical toxicity studies in Beagle dogs.},

   abstract = {Celiac disease (CD) and inflammatory bowel disease (IBD), such as Crohn's disease (CrD) and ulcerative colitis (UC), are chronic inflammatory condition of the gastro-intestinal tract. The prevalence of IBD in celiac patients has been reported as 5-10 times higher than in the general population. The possibility of the presence of CD in IBD should be considered in IBD patients with long-term iron deficiency anemia (IDA) not responsive to iron supplementation. Non-celiac gluten sensitivity (NCGS) is characterized by intestinal and extra intestinal symptoms due to the ingestion of gluten-containing food in subject without CD and/or wheat allergy. Patients with Crohn's disease and SR-NCGS were more significantly affected by joint pains compared to UC patients (50% versus 11.1%). In Crohn's patients, a higher percentage of fatigue (50% versus 38.9%) and headache (27.3% versus 22.2%) was evident. For the association between NCGS and IBD new studies are warranted and, at this moment, a gluten free diet (GFD) may be useful more in CrD than in UC.},

   abstract = {The incidence of inflammatory bowel disease (IBD) and associated oxidative stress is increasing. The antioxidant mineral selenium (Se) was measured in serum samples from 106 IBD patients (53 with ulcerative colitis (UC) and 53 with Crohn's disease (CD)) and from 30 healthy controls. Serum Se concentrations were significantly lower in UC and CD patients than in healthy controls (p < 0.001) and significantly lower in CD patients than in UC patients (p = 0.006). Se concentrations in patients were significantly influenced by sex, body mass index (BMI), the inflammatory biomarker alpha-1-antitrypsin, surgery, medical treatment, the severity, extent, and form of the disease and the length of time since onset (p < 0.05). Se concentrations in IBD patients were positively and linearly correlated with nutritional (protein, albumin, prealbumin, cholinesterase and total cholesterol) and iron status-related (hemoglobin, Fe and hematocrit) parameters (p < 0.05). A greater impairment of serum Se and cardiovascular status was observed in CD than in UC patients. An adequate nutritional Se status is important in IBD patients to minimize the cardiovascular risk associated with increased inflammation biomarkers, especially in undernourished CD patients, and is also related to an improved nutritional and body iron status.},

   abstract = {Background and Aim. Crohn's disease is associated with gut microbiota (GM) dysbiosis. Treatment with the anti-IL-12p40 monoclonal antibody (12p40-mAb) has therapeutic effect in Crohn's disease patients. This study addresses whether a 12p40-mAb treatment influences gut microbiota (GM) composition in mice with adoptive transfer colitis (AdTr-colitis). Methods. AdTr-colitis mice were treated with 12p40-mAb or rat-IgG2a or NaCl from days 21 to 47. Disease was monitored by changes in body weight, stool, endoscopic and histopathology scores, immunohistochemistry, and colonic cytokine/chemokine profiles. GM was characterized through DGGE and 16S rRNA gene-amplicon high-throughput sequencing. Results. Following 12p40-mAb treatment, most clinical and pathological parameters associated with colitis were either reduced or absent. GM was shifted towards a higher Firmicutes-to-Bacteroidetes ratio compared to rat-IgG2a treated mice. Significant correlations between 17 bacterial genera and biological markers were found. The relative abundances of the RF32 order (Alphaproteobacteria) and Akkermansia muciniphila were positively correlated with damaged histopathology and colonic inflammation. Conclusions. Shifts in GM distribution were observed with clinical response to 12p40-mAb treatment, whereas specific GM members correlated with colitis symptoms. Our study implicates that specific changes in GM may be connected with positive clinical outcomes and suggests preventing or correcting GM dysbiosis as a treatment goal in inflammatory bowel disease.},

Doctors are going to play a major role as they are being called on to adapt their practices to confront it. In particular, nutrition seems to be at the core of obesity in children. The ascending trend of this phenomenon in pediatric age, with inherent healthcare implications, was already reported in epidemiological studies of the mid '90s. Public health programs of primary prevention should be stimulated and recommended, with the aim of promoting diet and lifestyle changes in the general population. In addition, accurate anthropometric measurements should be performed for use by pediatricians, who should focus efforts on preventing obesity during infancy and childhood. Nutrition plays such a pivotal role that it may be considered a valuable treatment strategy for multiple pediatric conditions, including celiac disease, Crohn's disease, short bowel syndrome, galactosemia, congenital deficiency of urea cycle enzymes. In view of all this, it would be advisable that food science be given higher relevance in medical education.},

   abstract = {Much has been written about the role of diet and risk for Crohn's disease (CD). However, the evidence is contradictory. Recent evidence has pointed to fiber playing an important role along with the possibility that dietary fat and overnutrition also have a role. Diet has a clearer place in disease modification, with some diets used in the treatment of CD. The lack of clarity stems from a poor understanding of the mechanisms underlying the relationship between diet and CD. Gut permeability is likely to play a key role in the risk for CD. Mechanisms whereby diet can affect gut permeability, including the effects of the gut microbiota, are reviewed. Modification of disease behavior is likely to be influenced by additional mechanisms, including recognition of complex food antigens. As with many other chronic diseases, a surrogate marker of CD risk would greatly aid evaluation of the dietary factors involved. Formal measures of gut permeability are too cumbersome for large-scale use, but fecal calprotectin may be a convenient measure of this. There are only preliminary data on the effect of diet and microbiota composition on fecal calprotectin and these require further investigation.},

This study aimed to systematically review all published clinical trials evaluating the effects of a regular diet on symptoms of IBD. Three medical databases were searched for clinical trials evaluating an intervention that involved dietary manipulation using a regular diet on adults with IBD whose symptoms were objectively measured before and after the intervention. The most common types of regular diet interventions that we observed in the literature fell into the following three categories: low residue/low fiber diets, exclusion diets, or other specific diets. Of all included studies, the few that were of higher quality and that observed a statistically significant improvement in symptoms in the diet group compared to the control group fell under the exclusion diet group or the other specific diet group. We were able to identify several high quality clinical trials evaluating dietary manipulations on symptoms of IBD. Exclusion diets and the low FODMAP diet are two areas identified in this review that show promise for having therapeutic benefits for patients with IBD.},

   abstract = {MOTIVATION: Discerning genetic contributions to diseases not only enhances our understanding of disease mechanisms, but also leads to translational opportunities for drug discovery. Recent computational approaches incorporate disease phenotypic similarities to improve the prediction power of disease gene discovery. However, most current studies used only one data source of human disease phenotype. We present an innovative and generic strategy for combining multiple different data sources of human disease phenotype and predicting disease-associated genes from integrated phenotypic and genomic data. RESULTS: To demonstrate our approach, we explored a new phenotype database from biomedical ontologies and constructed Disease Manifestation Network (DMN). We combined DMN with mimMiner, which was a widely used phenotype database in disease gene prediction studies. Our approach achieved significantly improved performance over a baseline method, which used only one phenotype data source. In the leave-one-out cross-validation and de novo gene prediction analysis, our approach achieved the area under the curves of 90.7% and 90.3%, which are significantly higher than 84.2% (P < e(-4)) and 81.3% (P < e(-12)) for the baseline approach. We further demonstrated that our predicted genes have the translational potential in drug discovery. We used Crohn's disease as an example and ranked the candidate drugs based on the rank of drug targets. Our gene prediction approach prioritized druggable genes that are likely to be associated with Crohn's disease pathogenesis, and our rank of candidate drugs successfully prioritized the Food and Drug Administration-approved drugs for Crohn's disease. We also found literature evidence to support a number of drugs among the top 200 candidates. In summary, we demonstrated that a novel strategy combining unique disease phenotype data with system approaches can lead to rapid drug discovery. AVAILABILITY AND IMPLEMENTATION: nlp.

   abstract = {Ulcerative colitis (UC) and Crohn's disease (CD) are chronic, relapsing inflammatory bowel diseases associated with significant morbidity. Conventional therapies for these diseases include corticosteroids, aminosalicylates, immunomodulators, and monoclonal antibodies. Over the years tumor necrosis factor (TNF)-alpha antagonists alone or in combination with other therapies have emerged as the cornerstone of treatment for induction and maintenance of remission of moderate to severe UC and CD. Unfortunately, some patients with moderate to severe UC and CD are unable to attain or maintain remission with TNF-alpha antagonist treatment. Vedolizumab, a humanized monoclonal antibody, is the first integrin receptor antagonist approved that selectively antagonizes alpha4beta7 gastrointestinal integrin receptors. US Food and Drug Administration approval is for treatment of patients with moderate to severe active UC and CD who have inadequate response with, lost response to, or are intolerant to a TNF-alpha antagonist or an immunomodulator; or have inadequate response with, are intolerant to, or demonstrate dependence on corticosteroids. When administered according to approved dosing in patients with moderate to severe CD and UC, vedolizumab induces clinical response rates up to 31.4% and 47.1% at week 6, and clinical remission rates up to 39% and 41.8% at week 52, respectively. Serious adverse events reported with vedolizumab include serious infections, malignancies, and anaphylaxis. Since vedolizumab is gastrointestinal selective, to date, it has not shown evidence of causing progressive multifocal leukoencephalopathy; however, postmarketing studies monitoring for this adverse effect are ongoing. Further assessment of vedolizumab earlier in the course of these diseases and in combination with other therapies is warranted.},

   abstract = {PURPOSE OF REVIEW: Sarcoidosis is a chronic granulomatous disease typically affecting the lung, lymph nodes, and other organ systems. Evidence suggests that the morbidity and mortality rates for sarcoidosis in the USA are rising, despite widespread use of anti-inflammatory therapies. In this review, we survey new therapies that target specific inflammatory pathways in other diseases (such as rheumatoid arthritis, Crohn's disease, and psoriasis) that are similar to pathways relevant to sarcoidosis immunopathogenesis, and therefore, represent potentially new sarcoidosis therapies. RECENT FINDINGS: Immunopathogenesis of sarcoidosis has been well elucidated over the past few years. There is abundant evidence for T-cell activation in sarcoidosis leading to activation of both Th1 and Th17 inflammatory cascades. Therapies targeting T-cell activation, Th1 pathways (such as the interleukin-6 inhibitors), Th17 pathway mediators, and others have been Food and Drug Administration approved or under investigation to treat a variety of autoimmune inflammatory diseases, but have not been studied in sarcoidosis. Targeting the p38 mitogen-activated protein kinases and the ubiquitine proteasome system with new agents may also represent a novel therapeutic option for patients with sarcoidosis. SUMMARY: Rising morbidity and mortality rates for patients with sarcoidosis strongly support the need to develop more effective anti-inflammatory therapies to treat chronic disease.},

However, there is no way to measure adherence to PBDs. OBJECTIVE: To develop a simple way of evaluating adherence to a PBD for Japanese patients with inflammatory bowel disease (IBD). DESIGN: PBD scores were assigned according to the frequency of consumption provided on a food-frequency questionnaire, obtained on hospitalization for 159 patients with ulcerative colitis and 70 patients with Crohn disease. Eight items considered to be preventive factors for IBD were scored positively, and 8 items considered to be IBD risk factors were scored negatively. The PBD score was calculated from the sum of plus and minus scores. Higher PBD scores indicated greater adherence to a PBD. The PBD scores were evaluated on hospitalization and 2 years after discharge for 22 patients with Crohn disease whose dietary pattern and prognosis were established. MAIN OUTCOME MEASURE: Plant-Based Diet score. RESULTS: The PBD scores differed significantly, in descending order, by dietary type: pro-Japanese diet, mixed type, and pro-westernized diet (Wilcoxon/Kruskal-Wallis test). The PBD scores in the ulcerative colitis and Crohn disease groups were 10.9 +/- 9.5 and 8.2 +/- 8.2, respectively. For patients with Crohn disease, those with long-term remission and normal C-reactive protein concentration were significantly more likely to have PBD scores of 25 or greater than below 25 (chi2). CONCLUSION: The PBD score is a valid assessment of PBD dietary adherence.},

   abstract = {Current chronic diseases are a reflection of the westernized diet that features a decreased consumption of dietary fiber. Indigestible dietary fiber is metabolized by gut bacteria, including Faecalibacterium prausnitzii, to butyrate, which has a critical role in colonic homeostasis owing to a variety of functions. Dietary fiber intake has been significantly inversely associated with the risk of chronic diseases. Crohn disease (CD) is not an exception. However, even authors who reported the inverse association between dietary fiber and a risk of CD made no recommendation of dietary fiber intake to CD patients. Some correspondence was against advocating high fiber intake in CD. We initiated a semivegetarian diet (SVD), namely a lacto-ovo-vegetarian diet, for patients with inflammatory bowel disease. Our SVD contains 32.4 g of dietary fiber in 2000 kcal. There was no untoward effect of the SVD. The remission rate with combined infliximab and SVD for newly diagnosed CD patients was 100%. Maintenance of remission on SVD without scheduled maintenance therapy with biologic drugs was 92% at 2 years. These excellent short- and long-term results can be explained partly by SVD. The fecal bacterial count of F prausnitzii in patients with CD is significantly lower than in healthy controls. Diet reviews recommend plant-based diets to treat and to prevent a variety of chronic diseases. SVD belongs to plant-based diets that inevitably contain considerable amounts of dietary fiber. Our clinical experience and available data provide a rationale to recommend a high fiber intake to treat CD.},

   abstract = {Eosinophilic esophagitis (EoE) is an emerging chronic atopic clinical-pathologic disease with an estimated prevalence of 1/1000 similar to the one of Crohn's diseases. Usually, EoE is firstly suspected due to symptoms that are caused by esophageal dysfunction and/or fibrosis. EoE diagnosis is confirmed if the esophageal biopsy shows at least 15 eosinophils per high power field (eos/hpf) as a peak value in one or more of at least four specimens obtained randomly from the esophagus. Most of the patients affected by EoE have other atopic diseases such as allergic rhinitis, asthma, IgE-mediated food allergies, and/or atopic dermatitis. The local inflammation is a T helper type 2 (Th2) flogosis, which most likely is driven by a mixed IgE and non-IgE-mediated reaction to food and/or environmental allergens. Recently published genetic studies showed also that EoE is associated with single nucleotide polymorphism (SNP) on genes which are important in atopic inflammation such as thymic stromal lymphopoietin (TSLP) located close to the Th2 cytokine cluster (IL-4, IL-5, IL-13) on chromosome 5q22. When the EoE diagnosis is made, it is imperative to control the local eosinophilic inflammation not only to give symptomatic relief to the patient but also to prevent complications such as esophageal stricture and food impaction. EoE is treated like many other atopic diseases with a combination of topical steroids and/or food antigen avoidance.},

   abstract = {BACKGROUND: The relationship between nutrition and Crohn's disease (CD) is complex and involves several therapeutic possibilities including: nutrition treatment for malnourished patients, optimization of growth and development, prevention of osteoporosis, first-line therapy for active disease, and maintenance of disease remission. In children and adolescents with CD, malnutrition is a common problem that adversely affects the prognosis. In at-risk adolescent CD patients, it is important to assess body composition, food intake, energy expenditure, nutrient balance and serum levels of nutrients before planning interventions for this population. The aim of this study was to provide a snapshot of the nutritional status of adolescents with CD in Brazil. METHODS: We prospectively selected 22 patients with mildly to moderately active CD, 29 patients with inactive CD and 35 controls (first-degree relatives of and in the same age bracket as the CD patients). The age range of participants was between 13.2 and 19.4 years old. We collected anthropometric data including weight, height, and body mass index (BMI), which were expressed as Z scores: weight-for-age, height-for-age and BMI-for-age, respectively, as well as using bioimpedance to determine body composition and assessing the Tanner stage. We also assessed macronutrients and micronutrients (serum levels and dietary intake of both). We used the chi-square test to determine whether any of the studied variables were associated with inactive or active CD. The level of significance was set at 5 % (p < 0.05). We have written informed parental consent for participation for any minors and written informed consent for any participants that were adults. RESULTS: The mean values for lean body mass, Tanner stage, height-for-age Z score and BMI-for-age Z score were lower in the active CD group than in the inactive CD and control groups (p < 0.05 for both). Compared with the controls, the CD patients showed significant differences in terms of the quality of dietary intake (particularly in caloric intake, dietary protein intake, dietary fiber intake, and micronutrient intake), which were reflected in the serum levels of nutrients, mainly vitamins A and E (p < 0.05). CONCLUSIONS: Adolescents with CD (including those with mildly to moderately active or inactive disease) have a nutritional risk, which makes it important to conduct nutritional assessments in such patients.},

   abstract = {Isotretinoin was approved by the Food and Drug Administration (FDA) in 1982 and revolutionized acne therapy. Soon afterwards, case reports appeared suggesting a link between inflammatory bowel disease and use of isotretinoin. As reviewed in this article, an increasing number of case-control and prospective (cohort) studies have been reported that examined associations between use of isotretinoin and inflammatory bowel disease. Published epidemiologic studies of the use of isotretinoin and risk of Crohn's disease and ulcerative colitis vary according to whether the design was a case-control study or cohort study and by other important design differences. The strengths and limitations of the studies, such as their ability to control for important confounding variables (e.g., the severity of acne and use of antibiotics), also differ widely. Results across epidemiologic studies have been inconsistent and most studies have not found a strong association or a dose-response relationship. Based upon results from laboratory studies, several biological mechanisms have been proposed to account for either a positive (pathogenic) or inverse (protective) association between isotretinoin and inflammatory bowel disease. Although epidemiologic study findings are generally consistent with a correct temporal relationship (i.e., exposure to isotretinoin preceded the onset of inflammatory bowel disease), Crohn's disease and ulcerative colitis often have an insidious onset with some symptoms occurring well before a clinical diagnosis of inflammatory bowel disease is made. Taken overall, results from epidemiologic (case-control and cohort) studies completed to date do not show a consistent association between isotretinoin use and risk of inflammatory bowel disease. There is no clear evidence of a causal link.},

   abstract = {Crohn's disease (CD) is a chronic disease characterized by episodic and disabling inflammation of the gastrointestinal tract in genetically susceptible individuals. The incidence and prevalence of CD is rising rapidly across the world emphasising that disease risk is also influenced by environmental and lifestyle factors, as well as the microbial community resident in the gut. Childhood-onset CD is associated with an aggressive disease course that can adversely impact patient growth and development. There is no cure for CD however new onset and recurrent cases of paediatric CD are often responsive to exclusive enteral nutrition (EEN) treatment. EEN treatment involves the exclusive consumption of an elemental or polymeric formula for several weeks and it is well established as a primary intervention strategy. EEN treatments typically achieve remission rates of over 80% and importantly they are associated with a high rate of mucosal healing, far superior to steroids, which is prognostic of improved long-term health outcomes. Furthermore, they are safe, have few side effects, and improve nutritional status and linear growth. Surprisingly, despite the utility of EEN our understanding of the host-microbe-diet interactions that underpin clinical remission and mucosal healing are limited. Here, we review the current state of knowledge and propose that the induction of autophagy, in addition to modulation of the microbiota and coordinated effects on inflammation and epithelial cell biology, may be critical for the therapeutic effects associated with EEN. A better understanding of EEN treatment will provide new opportunities to restore gut homeostasis and prolong periods of remission, as well as provide new insights into the factors that trigger and perhaps prevent CD.},

   abstract = {Vaccines represent one of the greatest achievements of medicine, dramatically reducing the incidence of serious or life-threatening infectious diseases and allowing people to live longer, healthier lives. As life expectancy has increased, however, the burden of non-communicable diseases (NCDs) such as cancer, hypertension, atherosclerosis, and diabetes has increased. This shifting burden of disease has heightened the already urgent need for therapies that treat or prevent NCDs, a need that is now being met with increased efforts to develop NCD vaccines. Like traditional vaccines, NCD vaccines work by modulating the human immune system, but target cells, proteins or other molecules that are associated with the NCD in question rather than pathogens or pathogen-infected cells. Efforts are underway to develop NCD vaccines to address not only cancer and hypertension, but also addiction, obesity, asthma, arthritis, psoriasis, multiple sclerosis, and Crohn's disease, among others. NCD vaccines present an interesting challenge for the U.S. Food and Drug Administration (FDA), which is tasked with approving new treatments on the basis of efficacy and safety. Should NCD vaccines be evaluated under the same analytic frame as traditional vaccines, or that of biologic drugs? Despite the borrowed nomenclature, NCD vaccines differ in important ways from infectious disease vaccines. Because infectious disease vaccines are generally administered to healthy individuals, often children, tolerance for adverse events is low and willingness to pay is limited. It is important to have infectious disease vaccines even for rare or eradicated disease (e.g., smallpox), in the event of an outbreak. The efficacy of infectious disease vaccines is generally high, and the vaccines convey population level benefits associated with herd immunity and potential eradication. The combination of substantial population-level benefits, low willingness to pay, and low tolerance for adverse events explains the need for the federal National Childhood Vaccine Injury Compensation Act, which encourages production and uptake by providing immunity from liability to industry and compensation to injured patients. These characteristics and considerations contrast sharply with those of NCD vaccines, raising the question of whether the term "vaccine" is appropriate for this new category of drugs. The article explores the emerging class of NCD vaccines, explains how they differ from traditional vaccines, and describes some regulatory implications of this innovative type of therapeutic.},

   abstract = {BACKGROUND: Bacteria play a role in the onset and perpetuation of intestinal inflammation in IBD. Compositional alterations may also change the metabolic capacities of the gut bacteria. OBJECTIVE: To examine the metabolic activity of the microbiota of patients with Crohn's disease (CD), UC or pouchitis compared with healthy controls (HC) and determine whether eventual differences might be related to the pathogenesis of the disease. METHODS: Faecal samples were obtained from 40 HC, 83 patients with CD, 68 with UC and 13 with pouchitis. Disease activity was assessed in CD using the Harvey-Bradshaw Index, in UC using the UC Disease Activity Index and in pouchitis using the Pouchitis Disease Activity Index. Metabolite profiles were analysed using gas chromatography-mass spectrometry. RESULTS: The number of metabolites identified in HC (54) was significantly higher than in patients with CD (44, p<0.001), UC (47, p=0.042) and pouchitis (43, p=0.036). Multivariate discriminant analysis predicted HC, CD, UC and pouchitis group membership with high sensitivity and specificity. The levels of medium-chain fatty acids (MCFAs: pentanoate, hexanoate, heptanoate, octanoate and nonanoate), and of some protein fermentation metabolites, were significantly decreased in patients with CD, UC and pouchitis. Hexanoate levels were inversely correlated to disease activity in CD (correlation coefficient=-0.157, p=0.046), whereas a significant positive correlation was found between styrene levels and disease activity in UC (correlation coefficient=0.338, p=0.001). CONCLUSIONS: Faecal metabolic profiling in patients with IBD relative to healthy controls identified MCFAs as important metabolic biomarkers of disease-related changes.

   abstract = {Crohn's disease is characterized by a dysregulation of both innate and adaptive immunity responses. Interleukin-12/23 (IL-12/23) pathway has been found to be a major driver of inflammation in adaptive immune responses. Ustekinumab is a fully human immunoglobulin G1 kappa monoclonal antibody that blocks the p40 subunit of IL-12 and IL-23 and prevents their interaction with their cell surface receptor and further cytokine activation. It is currently approved in the management of plaque psoriasis and psoriatic arthritis. Very promising data have emerged through phase II and phase III trials (UNITI-1, UNITI-2, and IM-UNITI) for both induction and maintenance of clinical response and remission in moderate-to-severe Crohn's disease, resulting in approval by the Food and Drug Administration for this condition. This article reviews the immunology of the IL-12/23 pathway, available data regarding the initial designing of ustekinumab, drug development through clinical trials including pharmacokinetics, efficacy, and safety, and its potential place in the treatment of Crohn's disease.},

   abstract = {OBJECTIVE: Adherent-invasive Escherichia coli (AIEC) are abnormally predominant on Crohn's disease (CD) ileal mucosa. AIEC strains adhere to enterocytes via interaction between type 1 pili and CEACAM6 receptors abnormally expressed on CD ileal mucosa, leading to gut inflammation. We analysed whether epigenetic mechanisms are involved in the upregulation of CEACAM6 expression in intestinal epithelial cells (IECs). DESIGN: Methylation of CEACAM6 promoter was analysed using bisulfite sequencing and site-specific methylation by SnapShot. pCpGfree reporter system was used to analyse CEACAM6 promoter activity. Transgenic mice expressing human CEACAM6 fed either standard food or a low-methyl diet (LMD) were orally challenged with 10(9) AIEC LF82. After 3 days, gut-associated AIEC and proinflammatory cytokines were quantified. RESULTS: Analysis of CEACAM6 gene promoter revealed potentially methylated dinucleotide CpGs within HIF-1-responsive elements (HREs). Methylation levels of CpG within CEACAM6 promoter were inversely correlated with CEACAM6 expression in IEC expressing various levels of CEACAM6. We show the critical role of HRE methylation and transcription factor HIF-1 in the regulation of CEACAM6 gene in IEC. This was confirmed in transgenic mice expressing human CEACAM6 fed a LMD. LMD-dependent HRE demethylation led to abnormal gut expression of CEACAM6, favouring AIEC colonisation and subsequent inflammation. CONCLUSIONS: HRE hypomethylation in CEACAM6 promoter correlates with high expression in IEC. Our findings suggest that abnormal DNA methylation leading to CEACAM6 increased expression and AIEC-mediated gut inflammation can be related to changes in nutritional habits, such as low intake in methyl donor molecules, leading to abnormal epigenetic marks in mouse model mimicking CD susceptibility.},

   abstract = {INTRODUCTION: Inflammatory bowel disease (IBD) consists of Crohn's disease, ulcerative colitis and an unspecific IBD. The unclear etiology of IBD is a limiting factor that complicates the development of new pharmacological treatments and explains the high frequency of refractory patients to current drugs, including both conventional and biological therapies. In view of this, recent progress on the development of novel patented products to treat IBD was reviewed. AREAS COVERED: Evaluation of the patent literature during the period 2013 - 2014 focused on chemical compounds, functional foods and biological therapy useful for the treatment of IBD. EXPERT OPINION: Majority of the patents are not conclusive because they were based on data from unspecific methods not related to intestinal inflammation and, when related to IBD models, few biochemical and molecular evaluations that could be corroborating their use in human IBD were presented. On the other hand, methods and strategies using new formulations of conventional drugs, guanylyl cyclase C peptide agonists, compounds that influence anti-adhesion molecules, mAbs anti-type I interferons and anti-integrin, oligonucleotide antisense Smad7, growth factor neuregulin 4 and functional foods, particularly fermented wheat germ with Saccharomyces cerevisiae, are promising products for use in the very near future.},

   abstract = {Although patients with inflammatory bowel diseases (IBD) have a strong interest in dietary modifications as part of their therapeutic management, dietary advice plays only a minor part in published guidelines. The scientific literature shows that dietary factors might influence the risk of developing IBD, that dysbiosis induced by nutrition contributes to the pathogenesis of IBD, and that diet may serve as a symptomatic treatment for irritable bowel syndrome-like symptoms in IBD. The role of nutrition in IBD is underscored by the effect of various dietary therapies. In paediatric patients with Crohn's disease (CD) enteral nutrition (EN) reaches remission rates similar to steroids. In adult patients, however, EN is inferior to corticosteroids. EN is not effective in ulcerative colitis (UC). Total parenteral nutrition in IBD is not superior to steroids or EN. The use of specific probiotics in patients with IBD can be recommended only in special clinical situations. There is no evidence for efficacy of probiotics in CD. By contrast, studies in UC have shown a beneficial effect in selected patients. For patients with pouchitis, antibiotic treatment followed by probiotics, like VSL#3 or Lactobacillus GG, is effective. When probiotics are used, the risk of bacterial translocation and subsequent bacteremia has to be considered. More understanding of the normal intestinal microflora, and better characterization of probiotic strains at the phenotypic and genomic levels is needed as well as clarification of the mechanisms of action in different clinical settings. A FODMAP reduced diet may improve symptoms in IBD.},

   abstract = {Inflammatory bowel diseases (IBD) are chronic inflammatory conditions, characterised by remissions and relapses episodes, whose main manifestations are ulcerative colitis and Crohn's disease. Ulcerative colitis (UC), one of the main forms of IBD, has as standard treatment the use of corticosteroids and anti-inflammatory drugs. The use of antibiotics has been also reported, but the possible adverse effects, such as disturbance of the indigenous microbiota or resistance induction, should be taken into consideration, and thus the use of probiotics emerges as a possible alternative option of treatment. In this study, the oral administration of Bifidobacterium longum subsp. infantis BB-02 was evaluated as a preventive strategy for acute experimental UC induced in female BALB/c mice by ingestion of 3.5% dextran sulphate sodium in drinking water during 7 days. During this time, the daily disease activity index was evaluated, and on the seventh day the animals were euthanised to collect intestines and liver for analysis. Treatment with the probiotic resulted in clinical improvement of the animals. The histological and morphometric analyses showed a reduction of lesions and oedema in the gut, but there was no increase in the production of mucin. The dosage of secretory immunoglobulin A was significantly higher in the colitis group and reduced in the group treated with the probiotic. There was also a reduction in the inflammation of the colon, as demonstrated by a decrease in neutrophils infiltration, and KC/CXCL-1 levels. The intestinal permeability, which is typically increased during the onset of IBD, was also reduced by treatment with probiotic. Based on these data, it can be concluded that the bacterium B. infantis BB-02 has a probiotic potential for the attenuation of UC, but further studies should be conducted to verify the mechanism of protective action of the bacterium.},

   abstract = {BACKGROUND AND AIMS: In May 2014, vedolizumab was approved by the Food and Drug Administration for the treatment of moderate-to-severe Crohn's disease. In clinical practice it is typically used in patients who are primary or secondary non-responders to adalimumab [Humira]. We aim to estimate the incremental benefits and costs of using vedolizumab as rescue therapy for adalimumab non-responders. METHODS: A Markov model was used to simulate the clinical course of Crohn's disease in a hypothetical cohort of 10,000 patients over a 12-month period. The treatment strategies evaluated were adalimumab only [with and without dose intensification] and adalimumab and vedolizumab [with and without adalimumab dose intensification]. The base case strategy was adalimumab only with 25% of non-responders undergoing dose intensification. Our primary outcomes were changes in costs and quality of life measures over the analytical horizon. RESULTS: In a 1-year period, initiating vedolizumab as rescue therapy in adalimumab non-responders reduces the average total cost per patient by 10%, and increases the average amount of time spent in remission or mild disease by up to 2 months. CONCLUSIONS: Treating on-label adalimumab non-responders with vedolizumab can, in the short term, significantly improves the quality of life of Crohn's disease patients that do not respond to adalimumab.},

   abstract = {Melatonin is produced in the pineal gland as well as many other organs, including the enterochromaffin cells of the digestive mucosa. Melatonin is a powerful antioxidant that resists oxidative stress due to its capacity to directly scavenge reactive species, to modulate the antioxidant defense system by increasing the activities of antioxidant enzymes, and to stimulate the innate immune response through its direct and indirect actions. In addition, the dysregulation of the circadian system is observed to be related with alterations in colonic motility and cell disruptions due to the modifications of clock genes expression. In the gastrointestinal tract, the activities of melatonin are mediated by melatonin receptors (MT2), serotonin (5-HT), and cholecystokinin B (CCK2) receptors and via receptor-independent processes. The levels of melatonin in the gastrointestinal tract exceed by 10-100 times the blood concentrations. Also, there is an estimated 400 times more melatonin in the gut than in the pineal gland. Gut melatonin secretion is suggested to be influenced by the food intake. Low dose melatonin treatment accelerates intestinal transit time whereas high doses may decrease gut motility. Melatonin has been studied as a co-adjuvant treatment in several gastrointestinal diseases including irritable bowel syndrome (IBS), constipation-predominant IBS (IBS-C), diarrhea-predominant IBS (IBS-D), Crohn's disease, ulcerative colitis, and necrotizing enterocolitis. The purpose of this review is to provide information regarding the potential benefits of melatonin as a co-adjuvant treatment in gastrointestinal diseases, especially IBS, Crohn's disease, ulcerative colitis, and necrotizing enterocolitis.},

ADD etiologic agents include viruses, bacteria and parasites in that order. Escherichia coli bacteria it is classified as a major diarrheagenic agent and transmitted by consuming contaminated water or undercooked foods. This review compiled updates on information virulence factors and pathogenic mechanisms involved in adhesion and colonization of seven pathotypes of E. coli called enteropathogenic E. coli (EPEC), enterotoxigenic E. coli (ETEC), enteroinvasive E. coli (EIEC), shigatoxigenic E. coli (STEC), enteroaggregative E. coli (EAEC) and diffusely-adherent E. coli (DAEC). A final pathotype, adherent-invasive E. coli (AIEC) associated with Crohn's disease was also reviewed. The diarrheagenic pathotypes of E. coli affect different population groups and knowledge of the molecular mechanisms involved in the interaction with the human is important to guide research towards the development of vaccines and new tools for diagnosis and control.},

   abstract = {BACKGROUND & AIMS: Probiotic formulations of single species of bacteria have not been effective in preventing the recurrence of Crohn's disease after surgery. We investigated the ability of VSL#3, a mixture of 8 different bacterial probiotic species, to prevent Crohn's disease recurrence after surgery in a multicenter, randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled trial. METHODS: Within 30 days of ileocolonic resection and re-anastomosis, patients with Crohn's disease were randomly assigned to groups given 1 sachet of VSL#3 (900 billion viable bacteria, comprising 4 strains of Lactobacillus, 3 strains of Bifidobacterium, and 1 strain of Streptococcus salivarius subspecies thermophilus) (n = 59) or matching placebo (n = 60). Colonoscopy was performed at days 90 and 365 to evaluate the neoterminal ileum for disease recurrence and obtain mucosal biopsies for cytokine analysis. Patients from both groups with either no or mild endoscopic recurrence at day 90 received VSL#3 until day 365. The primary outcome was the proportion of patients with severe endoscopic recurrence at day 90. RESULTS: At day 90, the proportion of patients with severe endoscopic lesions did not differ significantly between VSL#3 (9.3%) and placebo (15.7%, P = .19). The proportions of patients with non-severe lesions at day 90 who had severe endoscopic recurrence at day 365 were 10.0% in the early VSL#3 group (given VSL#3 for the entire 365 days) and 26.7% in the late VSL#3 group (given VSL#3 from days 90 through 365) (P = .09). Aggregate rates of severe recurrence (on days 90 and 365) were not statistically different, 20.5% of subjects in the early VSL#3 group and 42.1% in the late VSL#3 group. Patients receiving VSL#3 had reduced mucosal inflammatory cytokine levels compared with placebo at day 90 (P < .05). Crohn's disease activity index and inflammatory bowel disease quality of life scores were similar in the 2 groups. CONCLUSIONS: There were no statistical differences in endoscopic recurrence rates at day 90 between patients who received VSL#3 and patients who received placebo. Lower mucosal levels of inflammatory cytokines and a lower rate of recurrence among patients who received early VSL#3 (for the entire 365 days) indicate that this probiotic should be further investigated for prevention of Crohn's disease recurrence.

METHODS: A search of the Internet as well as PubMed was conducted through August 2014 for information related to the clinical use of biosimilars in chronic inflammatory disorders using the keywords biosimilar, rheumatoid arthritis, juvenile idiopathic arthritis, psoriasis, psoriatic arthritis, Crohns disease, ulcerative colitis, and ankylosing spondylitis. The European Medicines Agency (EMA) and US Food and Drug Administration (FDA) websites were searched for biosimilar guidelines. RESULTS: Articles and guidelines relating to integrating biosimilars into the clinical management of patients with inflammatory disorders have been published by regulatory agencies, professional associations, healthcare providers, and others. CONCLUSIONS: The recent approval of the biosimilar infliximab in some countries makes biosimilars a reality for rheumatologists and others involved in the care of patients with inflammatory disorders. To successfully and confidently integrate biosimilars into clinical practice, physicians must understand factors such as variation in innovator/reference products, extrapolation of data, naming and labeling, interchangeability and automatic substitution, and pharmacovigilance.},

   abstract = {BACKGROUND: Crohn's disease (CD) is associated with defective innate immunity, including impaired neutrophil chemotaxis, and mucosal invasion by bacteria, particularly adherent and invasive Escherichia coli that replicate inside macrophage phagolysosomes. We compared CD and healthy control (HC) macrophages for their abilities to kill E. coli and generate neutrophil chemoattractants and also assessed the effects of hydroxychloroquine (HCQ) and vitamin D on killing of phagocytosed E. coli. METHODS: Peripheral blood monocyte-derived macrophages from CD and HC were compared for bacterial killing and generation of neutrophil chemoattractants in response to CD-derived E. coli. Escherichia coli replication was also assessed in the presence and absence of HCQ, alone and with antibiotics, and vitamin D. RESULTS: Monocyte-derived macrophages from patients with CD were similar to HC in allowing replication of phagocytosed CD-derived E. coli: HM605 {CD: N = 10, mean fold replication in 3 hr = 1.08 (95% confidence interval [CI], 0.39-1.78); HC: N = 9, 1.50 (95% CI, 1.02-1.97); P = 0.15} and also in generation of neutrophil chemoattractants in response to E. coli (mean fold chemotaxis relative to control: CD = 2.55 [95% CI, 2.31-2.80]; HC = 2.65 [95% CI, 2.46-2.85], P = 0.42). HCQ and 1,25 OH2-vitamin D3 both caused dose-dependent inhibition of intramacrophage E. coli replication 3-hour postinfection; HCQ: 73.9% inhibition (P < 0.001) at 1 mug/mL, accompanied by raised intraphagosomal pH, and 1,25 OH2-vitamin D3: 80.7% inhibition (P < 0.05) at 80 nM. HCQ had synergistic effects with doxycycline and ciprofloxacin. CONCLUSIONS: CD and HC macrophages perform similarly in allowing replication of phagocytosed E. coli and generating neutrophil chemoattractants. Replication of phagocytosed E. coli was substantially decreased by HCQ and vitamin D. These warrant further therapeutic trials in CD in combination with relevant antibiotics.},

   abstract = {BACKGROUND: Sulforaphane has well established anti-cancer properties and more recently anti-inflammatory properties have also been determined. Sulforaphane has been shown to inhibit PRR-mediated pro-inflammatory signalling by either directly targeting the receptor or their downstream signalling molecules such as the transcription factor, NF-kappaB. These results raise the possibility that PRR-mediated inflammation could be suppressed by specific dietary bioactives. We examined whether sulforaphane could suppress NF-kappaB via the NOD2 pathway. METHODS: Human embryonic kidney 293T (HEK293T) cells were stably transfected with NOD2 variants and the NF-kappaB reporter, pNifty2-SEAP. The cells were co-treated with sulforaphane and MDP and secreted alkaline phosphatase (SEAP) production was determined. RESULTS: We found that sulforaphane was able to significantly suppress the ligand-induced NF-kappaB activity at physiologically relevant concentrations, achievable via the consumption of broccoli within the diet. CONCLUSIONS: These results demonstrate that the anti-inflammatory role of sulforaphane is not restricted to LPS-induced inflammatory signalling. These data add to the growing evidence that PRR activation can be inhibited by specific phytochemicals and thus suggests that diet could be a way of controlling inflammation. This is particularly important for a disease like Crohn's disease where diet can play a key role in relieving or exacerbating symptoms.},

Map has been associated with human diseases like Crohn disease, type-1 diabetes, sarcoidosis, multiple sclerosis and Hashimoto's thyroiditis. The aim of this study was to determine the level of Map positivity of cheeses produced in Tuscany (Italy) as an indication of human exposure to the specific pathogen. Sampling was focused on artisanal cheeses produced without commercial starter culture from raw sheep or goat milk, on small-scale farms. Samples were tested by quantitative PCR (qPCR) and culture. Map DNA was detected in 4/7 (57.14%) goat, and in 14/25 (56%) sheep cheeses by qPCR, whereas cultivation produced a positive result in only one case. This corresponded to a goat cheese that had also reacted positively by qPCR and yielded a viable Type S (sheep) strain of Map. The Map load of the tested samples based on qPCR ranged from 6x10 to 1.8x10(4)Map cells/g of cheese. The results indicate on average 56.57% and 66.6% positivity of cheese samples and farms, respectively. Hence, the type of cheeses that were analyzed within the context of this study seem to constitute a considerable source of human exposure to Map; although the question remains of whether the Map cells were present in a viable form, since positive results were almost exclusively recorded by qPCR.},

   abstract = {Alterations of intestinal microflora may significantly contribute to the pathogenesis of different inflammatory and autoimmune disorders. There is emerging interest on the role of selective modulation of microflora in inducing benefits in inflammatory intestinal disorders, by as probiotics, prebiotics, synbiotics, antibiotics, and fecal microbiota transplantation (FMT). To summarize recent evidences on microflora modulation in main intestinal inflammatory disorders, PubMed was searched using terms microbiota, intestinal flora, probiotics, prebiotics, fecal transplantation. More than three hundred articles published up to 2015 were selected and reviewed. Randomized placebo-controlled trials and meta-analysis were firstly included, mainly for probiotics. A meta-analysis was not performed because of the heterogeneity of these studies. Most of relevant data derived from studies on probiotics, reporting some efficacy in ulcerative colitis and in pouchitis, while disappointing results are available for Crohn's disease. Probiotic supplementation may significantly reduce rates of rotavirus diarrhea. Efficacy of probiotics in NSAID enteropathy and irritable bowel syndrome is still controversial. Finally, FMT has been recently recognized as an efficacious treatment for recurrent Clostridium difficile infection. Modulation of intestinal flora represents a very interesting therapeutic target, although it still deserves some doubts and limitations. Future studies should be encouraged to provide new understanding about its therapeutical role.},

   abstract = {In Digestive Disease Week 2016, interesting data were presented on the eventual role of certain foods in inflammatory bowel disease, although the value of these data is relative. Also of interest were epidemiological studies, of which several analysed the natural history of the disease. Some presentations dealt with the search for individual predictive factors, a pressing need in clinical practice. Unfortunately, some of the findings presented were of dubious value. A study suggesting that a simple parameter as increased blood monocytes could be a clear predictive factor of poor outcome could perhaps be highlighted (the results were striking but had multiple limitations). In contrast, more interesting data were presented on monitoring and optimising biological therapy in the search for an individually-tailored approach. New studies were presented on the levels of distinct anti-TNF agents, vedolizumab and even ustekinumab. One study aimed to estimate the safety of anti-TNF agents on the basis of the patient's genetic (and clinical) features. There is no new evidence that will change our clinical practice. Equally, the data on colon cancer prevention will not modify our clinical practice, although one study reported a promising new strategy, consisting of the use of a new stool DNA test, with very promising results in the detection of high-grade dysplasia or colorectal cancer in these patients.},

   abstract = {INTRODUCTION: Crohn's disease (CD) is a chronic illness of unknown etiology. The consequences that CD causes nutritionally depend on several factors. However, little is known about the nutritional practices that CD affected people adopt once diagnosed. OBJECTIVE: to explore the experience of those affected in relation to food intake, with the future goal of understanding those experiences and design effective and appropriate interventions. SUBJECTS AND METHODS: a qualitative design based on ethnographic approach was used. 19 semi-structured interviews were conducted in Alicante, until data saturation was reached and later the analysis of categories and subcategories was developed. RESULTS: 5 categories with their subcategories were identified from the data collected on the experience of feeding: 1) Beliefs about nutrition and CD, 2) Changing eating habits, 3) Finding information about food and CD, 4) The role of professionals, 5) Self-management. CONCLUSIONS: knowledge of the dietary habits of the person with CD, may provide professional workforce with the appropriate information for management and support in terms of prevention, health promotion and health education, useful for the organization of health institutions, where those things are not usually taken into account since the CD approach is purely based on clinical and pathological aspects. Consequently, it appears a need of a new CD perspective based on health, focused on promoting healthy habits and from a multidisciplinary approach.},

   abstract = {Oral prescription medical foods have long been used in hospital settings but are also appropriate therapies for gastrointestinal disorders in outpatient medical practice. Oral serum-derived bovine immunoglobulin/protein isolate (SBI) has been shown in clinical studies to reduce loose stools and improve stool consistency as well as other symptoms (i.e., abdominal pain, bloating, and urgency) in patients with irritable bowel syndrome with diarrhea (IBS-D) and human immunodeficiency virus-associated enteropathy. This case series reports the outcomes of 14 IBS patients who received SBI as an addition to standard of care at an individual physician's clinical practice. The patients: 2 IBS with constipation (IBS-C), 7 IBS-D, 2 mixed diarrhea and constipation IBS (IBS-M) and 3 undefined IBS (IBS-U; also described by some physicians as IBS-Bloating), ranged in age from 22-87 years. SBI (5 g or 10 g daily dose) was added to the patient's current standard care and followed for several weeks to determine if symptoms were improved with the addition of SBI. Overall, 12 of the 14 patients indicated some level of improvement through direct questioning of the patients regarding changes from the prior visit. One IBS-Bloating patient had a resolution of symptoms and two patients (1 IBS-Bloating and 1 IBS-C) discontinued therapy because of insufficient relief. The 12 patients who continued on therapy reported an overall improvement in symptoms with better stool consistency, decreased frequency as well as reductions in abdominal pain, bloating, distention, and incontinence. In most cases, therapeutic effects of SBI were seen within the first four weeks of therapy with continued improvements at subsequent visits. SBI has a multifaceted mechanism of action and may help to manage IBS by providing a distinct protein source required to normalize bowel function, gastrointestinal microbiota, and nutritionally enhance tight junction protein expression between intestinal epithelial cells. SBI as a medical food provides a safe option for patients with IBS-D but may have application in other forms of IBS.},

   abstract = {Recent literature data suggests that parasitic and fungal diseases, which pose a threat to both human and animal health, remain a clinical, diagnostic and therapeutic problem. Attention is increasingly paid to the role played by natural microbiota in maintaining homeostasis in humans. A particular emphasis is placed on the possibility of manipulating the human microbiota (permanent, transient, pathogenic) and macrobiota (e.g., Trichuris suis) to support the treatment of selected diseases such as Crohn's disease, obesity, diabetes and cancer. Emphasis is placed on important medical species whose infections not only impair health but can also be life threatening, such as Plasmodium falciparum, Echinococcus multilocularis and Baylisascaris procyonis, which expand into areas which have so far been uninhabited. This article also presents the epidemiology, diagnosis and treatment of opportunistic parasitoses imported from the tropics, which spread across large groups of people through human-to-human transmission (Enterobius vermicularis, Sarcoptes scabiei). It also discusses the problem of environmentally-conditioned parasitoses, particularly their etiological factors associated with food contaminated with invasive forms (Trichinella sp., Toxoplasma gondii). The analysis also concerns the presence of developmental forms of geohelminths (Toxocara sp.) and ectoparasites (ticks), which are vectors of serious human diseases (Lyme borreliosis, anaplasmosis, babesiosis), in the environment. Mycological topics contains rare cases of mycoses environmentally conditioned (CNS aspergillosis) and transmissions of these pathogens in a population of hospitalized individuals, as well as seeking new methods used to treat mycoses.},

   abstract = {Terminal ileitis (TI) is an inflammatory condition of the terminal portion of the ileum that may occur acutely with right lower quadrant pain followed or not by diarrhea, or exhibit chronic obstructive symptoms and bleeding and normally it is associated to Crohn's disease (CD) although it may be associated to other different conditions. This review intended to contribute to a better understanding of TI in order to help in the diagnosis, medical approach and patient care. This work was performed on a survey of articles collected in different databases and a retrospective search was carried out to identify relevant studies in the field. Pathological conditions such as ulcerative colitis, the intake of non-steroidal anti-inflammatory drugs, infectious diseases, eosinophilic enteritis, malignant diseases, spondyloarthropathies, vasculitides, ischemia, sarcoidosis, amyloidosis and others may be related to ileitis but it is commonly referred to CD. To a correct therapeutic approach, it is necessary to understand the causes of this inflammation process. The performance of a clinical, laboratory, endoscopic, and histopathological evaluation of the individuals is crucial to the correct diagnosis and treatment once the inflammation of the ileum may occur due to different pathological conditions besides CD, leading to difficulties in the diagnosis. Thus, an individual approach is necessary once the correct diagnosis is crucial for the immediate therapeutic approach and recovering of the patient.},

   abstract = {OBJECTIVE: Small intestinal bacterial overgrowth (SIBO) is characterized by an abnormal proliferation of bacterial species in the small bowel. It has been shown that patients with Crohn's disease (CD) have a higher risk of SIBO development. The aim of the present study was to investigate SIBO prevalence in CD patients, possible clinical predictors of SIBO development and response to antibiotic therapy. MATERIAL AND METHODS: Sixty-eight patients (42 male, 26 female; mean age 49.3 +/- 12.8 years) with CD reporting abdominal complaints were prospectively evaluated for SIBO with H2/CH4 glucose breath test (GBT). RESULTS: Of the 68 patients enrolled, 18 (26.5%) tested positive for SIBO. Patients with SIBO exhibited increased stool frequency and significant reduction of stool solidity (p = 0.014), were older than patients tested negative to GBT (54.3 +/- 13.0 years vs. 47.5 +/- 12.3 years, p = 0.049), reported a longer history of CD (21.2 +/- 10.3 years vs. 15.7 +/- 10.2 years, p = 0.031) and showed a significant higher frequency of prior surgery (p = 0.001), revealing an association of number of surgical procedures (OR = 2.8315, 95% CI = 1.1525-6.9569, p = 0.023) with SIBO. Breath test normalization occurred in 13/15 patients evaluated after antibiotic and probiotic therapy. Although vitamin B12 levels were lower in patients with SIBO (p = 0.045) and a significant improvement was found after treatment (p = 0.011), this could be due to the heterogeneity, regarding vitamin B12 treatment, in our cohort. CONCLUSION: SIBO is a frequent but underestimated condition in CD, which often mimics acute flare, effectively identified with GBT and could be treated with a combined antibiotic and probiotic therapy.},

   abstract = {The aim of this article is to discuss how the systems science approach can be used to optimize intervention strategies in food animal systems. It advocates the idea that the challenges of maintaining a safe food supply are best addressed by integrating modeling and mathematics with biological studies critical to formulation of public policy to address these challenges. Much information on the biology and epidemiology of food animal systems has been characterized through single-discipline methods, but until now this information has not been thoroughly utilized in a fully integrated manner. The examples are drawn from our current research. The first, explained in depth, uses clinical mastitis to introduce the concept of dynamic programming to optimize management decisions in dairy cows (also introducing the curse of dimensionality problem). In the second example, a compartmental epidemic model for Johne's disease with different intervention strategies is optimized. The goal of the optimization strategy depends on whether there is a relationship between Johne's and Crohn's disease. If so, optimization is based on eradication of infection; if not, it is based on the cow's performance only (i.e., economic optimization, similar to the mastitis example). The third example focuses on food safety to introduce risk assessment using Listeria monocytogenes and Salmonella Typhimurium. The last example, practical interventions to effectively manage antibiotic resistance in beef and dairy cattle systems, introduces meta-population modeling that accounts for bacterial growth not only in the host (cow), but also in the cow's feed, drinking water and the housing environment. Each example stresses the need to progress toward multi-scale modeling. The article ends with examples of multi-scale systems, from food supply systems to Johne's disease. Reducing the consequences of foodborne illnesses (i.e., minimizing disease occurrence and associated costs) can only occur through an understanding of the system as a whole, including all its complexities. Thus the goal of future research should be to merge disciplines such as molecular biology, applied mathematics and social sciences to gain a better understanding of complex systems such as the food supply chain.},

   abstract = {BACKGROUND: Maternal high-fat diet (HFD) and obesity increases the risk of the offspring to develop inflammatory processes in various organs including the gut. We hypothesized that maternal diet-induced obesity programs the fetal gut towards inflammation in a mouse model of genetically-driven Crohn's disease (CD)-like ileitis. METHODS: TNF(WT/WT) and TNF(DeltaARE/WT) dams were fed an experimental control diet (CTRLD; 13 kJ% fat) or HFD (48 kJ%). Offspring mice were fed CTRLD or HFD at 4 weeks of age. Metabolic characteristics and severity of CD-like ileitis was assessed in 8- and 12-week old WT and ARE offspring measuring tissue histopathology and markers of inflammation in the distal ileum as well as plasma cytokine and LPS levels. To study prenatal effects, we laser microdissected fetal intestinal epithelial cells at 17.5 days postconception and performed microarray-based global gene expression analysis. RESULTS: Maternal HFD significantly accelerated the severity of CD-like ileitis in HFD-fed ARE mice at early life stages associated with increased mucosal neutrophil infiltration, Il12p40 expression, and portal vein LPS levels. In contrast to WT mice, metabolic characteristics of ARE offspring were not affected by maternal HFD. Gene expression patterns in fetal intestinal epithelial cells of ARE mice remained largely unchanged under conditions of maternal diet-induced obesity suggesting that the positive association of intestinal inflammation, portal vein endotoxemia, and plasma TNF levels is independent of prenatal conditioning of the gut epithelium. CONCLUSIONS: Maternal HFD promotes the early onset of severe CD-like ileitis in genetically susceptible offspring independent of metabolic alterations.},

   abstract = {Underlying pathophysiological mechanisms of irritable bowel syndrome (IBS), a common disorder characterized by abdominal pain associated to a change in stool consistency or frequency, include low-grade inflammation and intestinal microbiota changes. Few and disappointing data are available for prebiotics. A few controlled trials (RCTs) of probiotics are instead available with favourable effects, although most are limited by suboptimal design and small sample size. A recent report from the Rome foundation group included 32 RCTs of probiotics, most of which showed an overall modest improvement in symptoms, with the patients most benefitting from probiotics being those with predominant diarrhoea and those having a post-infectious IBS. A review focusing only on children with functional gastrointestinal disorders concluded that probiotics are more effective than placebo in the treatment of patients with abdominal pain-related functional gastrointestinal disorders, although no effect on constipation was evident. The role for probiotics in inflammatory bowel disease (IBD) appears logical: the endogenous intestinal microbiota plays a central role in their development, and various probiotics have been found effective in animal models of IBD. However, research in humans has been overall quite limited, and it would seem that after a phase of intense research in the first decade of this century, the pace has slowed down, with fewer clinical trials been published in the past 2-3 years. To summarize current evidence: no probiotic has proven successful in Crohn's disease. In ulcerative colitis, on the other hand, data are more promising, and a very recent meta-analysis, that included 23 randomized controlled trials, concluded that there is evidence of efficacy for the probiotic mixture VSL#3 in helping inducing and maintaining remission, as well as in maintaining remission in patients with pouchitis. It is fair to state that for both IBD and IBS, more well-designed, rigorous, randomized clinical trials must be performed.},

We aimed to evaluate, in a double-blinded randomized sham-controlled setting, the efficacy of IgG4-guided diet in improving quality of life in patients with Crohn's disease. METHODS: Consecutive patients with Crohn's disease and a Crohn's disease activity index (CDAI) of 80-400 attending tertiary and secondary care centers were screened. All patients had IgG4 titers tested against 16 common food types using ELISA. The true diet group excluded four food types with the highest antibody titers for 4 weeks, and the sham group excluded four foods with the lowest antibody titers. Quality of life was assessed using the Short Inflammatory Bowel Disease Questionnaire (SIBDQ) at beginning and end of the trial. Secondary outcome measures were CDAI, Harvey Bradshaw index, serum C-reactive protein, and fecal calprotectin. RESULTS: One hundred and forty-five subjects were screened and 96 subjects had initial food antibody testing performed with 76 patients completing the study. Milk, beef, pork and egg were the most commonly excluded food types in the true diet group. There was a 3.05 (0.01-6.11) p < 0.05 improvement in SIBDQ and 41 (10.4-71.5) in CDAI p = 0.009. CONCLUSION: IgG4-guided exclusion diet, as an adjunct, can improve quality of life and symptoms in patients with CD.},

By contrast, a combination of a probiotic agent (eg, Saccharomyces boulardii) with standard pharmacological therapy can promote clinical benefit.

On April 5, 2016, the Food and Drug Administration concurred with this recommendation and approved CT-P13 (Inflectra; Pfizer Inc.) for all diseases for which infliximab had previously been approved, including adult and pediatric moderate to severe ulcerative colitis and pediatric and adult moderate to severe and fistulizing Crohn's disease. This was despite the absence of any randomized controlled trials studying the infliximab biosimilar in any inflammatory bowel disease. This highly controversial approach has been criticized by various rheumatology and gastroenterology professional societies around the world. This review will cover the stepwise approach to biosimilar development, issues of extrapolation and interchangeability, and conclude with a discussion of the regulatory, intellectual property issues, and financial implications, which will all intersect in the decision and ability to prescribe a biosimilar or reference anti-tumor necrosis factor drug.},

   abstract = {OBJECTIVES: Altering FODMAP (fermentable oligosaccharides, disaccharides, monosaccharides and polyols) intake has substantial effects on gut microbiota. This study aimed to investigate effects of altering FODMAP intake on markers of colonic health in patients with Crohn's disease. METHODS: After evaluation of their habitual diet, 9 patients with clinically quiescent Crohn's disease were randomised to 21 days of provided low or typical ("Australian") FODMAP diets with >/=21-day washout in between. Five-day fecal samples were collected at the end of each diet and analyzed for calprotectin, pH, short-chain fatty acids (SCFA) and bacterial abundance. Gastrointestinal symptoms were recorded daily. RESULTS: Eight participants collected feces and were adherent to the diets. FODMAP intake differed across the three dietary periods with low<habitual<Australian diet. SCFA, pH and total bacterial abundance remained unaltered, but relative abundance was higher for butyrate-producing Clostridium cluster XIVa (P=0.008) and mucus-associated Akkermansia muciniphila (P=0.016), and lower for Ruminococcus torques (P=0.034) during the Australian compared with low FODMAP diet. Results during habitual diet were similar to the low FODMAP intervention, but significantly different to the Australian diet. The diets had no effects on calprotectin, but symptoms doubled in severity with the Australian diet (n=9; P<0.001). CONCLUSIONS: In clinically quiescent Crohn's disease, altering dietary FODMAP intake is associated with marked changes in fecal microbiota, most consistent with a prebiotic effect of increasing FODMAPs as shown in an irritable bowel/healthy cohort. This strategy might be favorable for gut health in Crohn's disease, but at the cost of inducing symptoms.},

We aimed to study food intake in children with IBD and evaluated the relation of dietary intake with disease activity and nutritional status in these children. METHODS: This cross-sectional study investigated 68 children and adolescents with IBD (57 Crohn disease, 11 ulcerative colitis). Evaluation included clinical, laboratory, and nutritional assessment including 3 days diet record. RESULTS: Compared with recommended daily allowance, the intake of patients with IBD was significantly poor for carbohydrates (75%, P = 0.016), calcium (49%, P < 0.05), magnesium (76%, P < 0.05), vitamin A (72%, P < 0.05), vitamin E (57%, P < 0.05), and fiber (44%, P < 0.05) and higher for protein (175%, P < 0.05), iron (112%, P < 0.05), and water-soluble vitamins (118%-189% P < 0.05). Compared with the intakes of healthy children from National Nutritional Survey, the intake of IBD group was lower for calories (78%, P = 0.012), carbohydrates (61% P < 0.05), magnesium (67% P < 0.05), vitamin C (34%, P < 0.05), and fiber (54%, P < 0.05) and high for B12 (141%, P < 0.05). Fifty subjects ate ordinary diets, 7 of 68 children were on exclusive enteral nutrition and 11 of 68 consumed regular food with different polymeric formulas supplements. Compared with children without supplements, children on exclusive enteral nutrition and nutritional supplements (18/68) had significantly better intakes of energy (1870 +/- 755 vs 2267 +/- 432, P < 0.05), carbohydrates (223 +/- 97 vs 292 +/- 99, P < 0.05), and all minerals (P < 0.05) and micronutrients (P < 0.05). Dietary intake was not different by disease status (remission or relapse). CONCLUSIONS: In the absence of nutritional supplements, food intake is inadequate for many nutrients in many children with IBD.},

   abstract = {Inflammatory bowel diseases (IBD) including ulcerative colitis (UC) and Crohn's disease (CD) are chronic relapsing inflammatory disorders of the gastrointestinal tract. The interaction between a disturbed microbial composition, the intestinal mucosal barrier and the mucosal immune system plays an important role in IBD and its chronicity. It has been indicated that due to the altered microbial composition the balance between T regulatory cells (Treg) and T helper cells (Th) 17 is disturbed, leading to an inflammatory state. The present study shows that oral intake of a specific multi fibre mix (MF), designed to match the fibre content of a healthy diet, counteracts IBD-like intestinal inflammation and weight loss in dextran sodium sulphate treated mice. This reduction in inflammation might be brought about, at least in part, by the MF-induced decrease in inflammatory cytokines, increase in IL-10 and the relative increase in Treg cells in the mesenteric lymph nodes (MLN). Moreover, the Treg percentage in the MLN correlates with the percentage of tolerogenic lamina propria derived CD103+RALDH+dendritic cells in the MLN, suggesting that these play a role in the observed effects. In children with CD exclusive enteral nutrition (EEN) is a widely used safe and effective therapy. Optimizing enteral nutritional concepts with the tested fibre mix, know to modulate the gut microbiota composition, SCFA production and inflammatory status (as indicated by the present study) could possibly further improve efficacy in inducing remission.},

EoE is suspected in patients with painful swallowing, among other symptoms, and is diagnosed by the presence of 15 or more eosinophils per high-power field in one or more of at least four esophageal biopsy specimens. The prevalence of EoE is increasing and has now reached rates similar to those of other chronic gastrointestinal disorders such as Crohn's disease. In recent years, our understanding of the immunologic mechanisms underlying this condition has grown considerably. Thanks to new genetic, molecular, cellular, animal, and translational studies, we can now postulate a detailed pathway by which exposure to allergens results in a complex and coordinated type 2 inflammatory cascade that, if not intervened upon, can result in pain on swallowing, esophageal strictures, and food impaction. Here, we review the most recent research in this field to synthesize and summarize our current understanding of this complex and important disease.},

   abstract = {Milk represents a unique resource for translational medicine: It contains a rich pool of biologically active molecules with demonstrated clinical benefits. The ongoing characterization of the mechanistic process through which milk components promote development and immunity has revealed numerous milk-derived compounds with potential applications as clinical therapies in infectious and inflammatory disease, cancer, and other conditions. Lactoferrin is an effective antimicrobial and antiviral agent in high-risk patient populations and a potentially potent adjuvant to chemotherapy in lung cancer. Enteric nutrition formulas supplemented with transforming growth factor beta, a milk cytokine, have been shown to promote remission in pediatric Crohn's disease. A number of milk glycans, including human milk oligosaccharides, show promise in preclinical studies as antimicrobial and anti-inflammatory agents. While active preclinical investigations of human milk may soon result in large-scale production of human milk molecules, bovine milk components in many instances represent a practical source of bioactive milk compounds for use in clinical trials. This review summarizes current efforts to translate the compounds derived from human and bovine milk into effective clinical therapies. These efforts suggest a common pathway for the translation of milk-derived compounds into clinical applications.},

   abstract = {BACKGROUND: The north-south geographical gradient of inflammatory bowel disease (IBD) prevalence, its epidemiology, the genetic association of vitamin D receptor polymorphisms, and results in animal models suggest that vitamin D plays an important role in the pathogenesis of IBD. AIMS: The purpose of this review was to critically appraise the effectiveness and safety of vitamin D therapy in patients with IBD. METHODS: MEDLINE, Scopus and Google Scholar were searched from inception to May 20, 2014 using the terms 'Crohn's disease', 'ulcerative colitis' and 'vitamin D'. Results: Vitamin D deficiency is common in patients with IBD. Limited clinical data suggest an association between low vitamin D concentration and increased disease activity in both ulcerative colitis (UC) and Crohn's disease (CD). To date, only two small open label trials and one randomized controlled trial have shown a positive effect of vitamin D supplementation on disease activity in patients with CD; no effect has been shown for UC. An optimal vitamin D supplementation protocol for patients with IBD remains undetermined, but targeting serum 25-hydroxy vitamin D [25(OH)D] levels between 30 and 50 ng/mL appears safe and may have benefits for IBD disease activity. Depending on baseline vitamin D serum concentration, ileal involvement in CD, body mass index, and perhaps smoking status, daily vitamin D doses between 1800-10,000 international units/day are probably necessary. CONCLUSION: Increasing preclinical and clinical evidence suggests a role for vitamin D deficiency in the development and severity of IBD. The possible therapeutic role of vitamin D in patients with IBD merits continued investigation.},

   abstract = {BACKGROUND: Psychosocial factors surrounding eating and drinking, such as enjoying food, managing restrictions, and maintaining social relationships, remain under-researched in inflammatory bowel disease [IBD]. This study aimed to develop and validate a food-related quality of life [FR-QoL] questionnaire to systematically measure these issues in the IBD population. METHODS: Following semi-structured interviews with 28 IBD patients, 150 potential questionnaire items were generated. These were ranked by 100 IBD patients, and items were removed based on ceiling/floor effects and high inter-item correlations [> 0.7], with 41 items being retained. In total, 323 IBD patients, 100 asthma patients [chronic disease control], and 117 healthy controls completed the FR-QoL questionnaire, alongside generic and disease-specific QoL and food satisfaction questionnaires. Principal components analysis [PCA], construct and discriminant validity, and test-retest reliability were calculated. RESULTS: Twelve items were removed following PCA. The reduced questionnaire [FR-QoL-29] explained 63.9% of the variance [Cronbach's alpha = 0.96]. FR-QoL-29 correlated significantly with generic QoL [r = 0.697], depression [r = -0.519], anxiety [r = -0.531], and food satisfaction [r = 0.701]. The FR-QoL-29 sumscores were significantly lower for IBD (89.5, standard deviation [SD] 28.6) than asthma [125.4, SD 24.1; p < 0.001] and healthy volunteers [123.0, SD 16.5; p<0.001]. Within IBD, worse food-related QoL was found in those with moderate/high disease activity [66.7, SD 22.1] compared with remission/low disease activity [92.5, SD 28.1]. Test-retest reliability was good (intra-class correlation [ICC] = 0.83, 95% confidence interval [CI] = 0.76:0.88). CONCLUSIONS: The FR-QoL-29 shows good reliability and validity across a range of IBD characteristics. This easily administered questionnaire is a useful tool in identifying poor food-related QoL and in the future may identify areas for intervention.},

   abstract = {BACKGROUND: Evidence has shown a link between allergic disease and inflammatory bowel diseases (IBDs). We investigated food allergy in Iranian pediatric IBD patients. MATERIALS AND METHODS: A cross-sectional study was conducted on a consecutive sample of children with newly diagnosed IBD referring to Mofid Children's University Hospital in Tehran (Iran) between November 2013 and March 2015. Data on age, gender, history of cow's milk allergy (CMA), IBD type, routine laboratory tests, and colonoscopic and histopathological findings were gathered. Food allergy was assessed with the skin prick test (SPT). RESULTS: A total of 28 patients including 19 ulcerative colitis (UC), 7 Cronh's disease (CD), and two with unclassified colitis with a mean age of 8.3 +/- 4.4 years. (57.1% females, 42.9% were studied. History of CMA was present in eight patients (28.6%). Seventeen patients (60.7%) had at least one food allergy (68.4% of UC vs. 42.9% of CD, P = 0.230). Ten patients (35.7%) had multiple food allergies (36.8% of UC vs. 42.9% of CD, P > 0.999). Common allergic foods were cow's milk (28.6%), beef, seafood, albumen, wheat, and walnuts (each 10.7%), and peanuts and chestnuts (each 7.1%). The SPT showed CMA in 68.4% (8/17) of UC but none of the CD patients (P = 0.077). CONCLUSION: Food allergy is frequent in Iranian pediatric IBD patients with CMA being the most common observed allergy. The CMA seems to be more frequent in UC than in CD patients.},

   abstract = {Intestinal adenocarcinomas seen in an inbred herd of farmed sika deer (Cervus nippon) morphologically resembled human hereditary non-polyposis colorectal cancer (HNPCC). Features common to both included multiple de novo sites of tumourigenesis in the proximal colon, sessile and non-polyposis mucosal changes, the frequent finding of mucinous type adenocarcinoma, lymphocyte infiltration into the neoplastic tubules and Crohn's-like lymphoid follicles at the deep margin of the tumour. HNPCC is defined by a germline mutation of mismatch repair (MMR) genes resulting in their inactivation and loss of expression. To test the hypothesis that similar MMR gene inactivation occurs in the deer tumours, the expression of the four most important MMR genes, MSH2, MLH1, MSH6 and PMS2, was examined at the mRNA level by reverse transcriptase polymerase chain reaction (n = 12) and at the protein level by immunohistochemistry (n = 40) in tumour and control tissues. All four genes were expressed equally in normal and neoplastic tissues, so MMR gene inactivation could not be implicated in the carcinogenesis of this tumour in sika deer.},

   abstract = {OBJECTIVES: Inflammatory bowel disease (IBD), particularly Crohn's disease (CD), is associated with increased microbial-specific IgG and IgA antibodies, whereas alterations of anti-food antibodies are still disputed. The knowledge about IgG subclass antibodies in IBD is limited. In this study we analysed IgG subclass antibodies specific for nutritional and commensal antigens in IBD patients and controls. METHODS: Serum IgG1, IgG2, IgG3 and IgG4 specific for wheat and milk extracts, purified ovalbumin, Escherichia coli and Bacteroides fragilis lysates and mannan from Saccharomyces cerevisiae were analysed by ELISA in patients with CD (n = 56), ulcerative colitis (UC; n = 29), acute gastroenteritis/colitis (n = 12) as well as non-inflammatory controls (n = 62). RESULTS: Anti-Saccharomyces cerevisiae antibodies (ASCA) of all IgG subclasses and anti-B. fragilis IgG1 levels were increased in CD patients compared to UC patients and controls. The discriminant validity of ASCA IgG2 and IgG4 was comparable with that of ASCA pan-IgG and IgA, whereas it was inferior for ASCA IgG1/IgG3 and anti-B. fragilis IgG1. Complicated CD defined by the presence of perianal, stricturing or penetrating disease phenotypes was associated with increased ASCA IgG1/IgG3/IgG4, anti-B. fragilis IgG1 and anti-E. coli IgG1 levels. Anti-food IgG subclass levels were not different between IBD patients and controls and did not correlate with food intolerance. In contrast to anti-microbial Abs, food-specific IgG responses were predominately of the IgG4 isotype and all food-specific IgG subclass levels correlated negatively with age. CONCLUSION: Our study supports the notion that the adaptive immune recognition of food and commensal antigens are differentially regulated.},

   abstract = {BACKGROUND: In Crohn's disease (CD), the involvement of food antigens in immune responses remains unclear. The objective of this study was to detect immune responses against food antigens in CD patients and examine the mechanism in a mouse model of colitis. METHODS: We enrolled 98 CD patients, 50 ulcerative colitis patients, and 52 healthy controls (HCs) to compare the levels of serum immunoglobulin (Ig)Gs against 88 foods. The presence of serum IgGs against foods was also examined in interleukin (IL)-10 knockout (KO) mice in which CD4(+) T cell activation by antigenic food protein was assessed. Mice transferred with IL-10 KO cells received diets with or without food antigens, and the development of colitis was evaluated. RESULTS: The prevalence of IgGs against various foods, especially vegetables, grains, and nuts, was significantly higher in CD patients than in HCs. Similarly, the prevalence of IgGs against food proteins was higher in IL-10 KO mice than in BALB/c mice. Beta-conglycinin, identified as an antigenic food proteins in IL-10 KO mice, induced CD4(+) T cell production of interferon-gamma and IL-17 through dendritic cell antigen presentation. Elimination of the food antigens ameliorated the development of colitis in mice without altering the composition of their intestinal microbiota. CONCLUSIONS: In CD colitis mice, intestinal inflammation via CD4(+) T cell hyperactivation was induced by food antigens associated with high serum IgG levels and was ameliorated by the elimination of food antigens. This disrupted immunological tolerance to food antigen, which might act as an exacerbating factor, remains to be elucidated in CD patients.},

   abstract = {The gut is a unique tissue where a refined balance is maintained between immune responses and tolerance to a variety of foreign antigens including food and commensal bacteria. Although activation of T helper (Th) cells, such as Th1 and Th17 cells, is responsible for the host defense against invading pathogens in the gut, inappropriate Th1/Th17 responses cause onset and/or progression of inflammatory bowel disease (IBD) comprised of two major disorders; ulcerative colitis and Crohn's disease. Therefore, the inflammatory responses by Th1/Th17 cells in the gut are tightly regulated through a number of mechanisms. In the human intestine, several innate immune cell subsets play important roles in the maintenance of the gut homeostasis by controlling adaptive immune responses. We recently identified CD14+ CD163low cells and CD14+ CD163high CD160high cells as Th17-inducing dendritic cells and anti-inflammatory phagocytes, respectively. In addition, the dysfunction of these cell subsets was observed in the patients with IBD. Therefore, it would be an important future issue to analyze the mechanisms underlying regulation of intestinal innate immune cell homeostasis for the development of a novel therapeutic intervention for IBD.},

   abstract = {BACKGROUND: The Crohn's Disease Activity Index (CDAI) is a measure of disease activity based on symptoms, signs and a laboratory test. The US Food and Drug Administration has indicated that patient reported outcomes (PROs) should be the primary outcome in randomised controlled trials for Crohn's disease (CD). AIM: As no validated PRO exists for CD, to investigate whether CDAI diary card items could be modified for this purpose. METHODS: Data from a trial of rifaximin-extended intestinal release were used to identify cut-points for stool frequency, pain and general well-being using receiver operating characteristic curves with CDAI <150 as criterion. The operating properties of 2- and 3-item PRO were evaluated using data from a trial of methotrexate in CD. Regression analysis determined PRO2 and PRO3 scores that correspond to CDAI-defined thresholds of 150, 220 and 450 and changes of 50, 70 and 100 points. RESULTS: Optimum cut-points for CDAI remission were mean daily stool frequency </=1.5, abdominal pain </=1, and general well-being score of </=1 (areas under the ROC curve 0.79, 0.91 and 0.89, respectively). The effect estimates were similar using 2- and 3-item PROs or CDAI. PRO2 and PRO3 values corresponding to CDAI scores of 150, 220 and 450 points were 8, 14, 34 and 13, 22, 53. The corresponding values for CDAI changes of 50, 70 and 100, were 2, 5, 8 and 5, 9, 14. Responsiveness to change was similar for both PROs. CONCLUSION: Patient reported outcomes derived from CDAI diary items may be appropriate for use in clinical trials for CD.},

Previously, Sasa quelpaertensis leaves have been shown to mediate anti-inflammation and anti-cancer effects, although it remains unclear whether Sasa leaves are able to attenuate inflammation-related intestinal diseases. Therefore, the aim of this study was to investigate the anti-inflammatory effects of Sasa quelpaertensis leaf extract (SQE) using an in vitro co-culture model of the intestinal epithelial environment. MATERIALS/METHODS: An in vitro co-culture system was established that consisted of intestinal epithelial Caco-2 cells and RAW 264.7 macrophages. Treatment with lipopolysaccharide (LPS) was used to induce inflammation. RESULTS: Treatment with SQE significantly suppressed the secretion of LPS-induced nitric oxide (NO), prostaglandin E2 (PGE2), IL-6, and IL-1beta in co-cultured RAW 264.7 macrophages. In addition, expressions of inducible nitric oxide synthase (iNOS), cyclooxygenase (COX)-2, and tumor necrosis factor (TNF)-alpha were down-regulated in response to inhibition of IkappaBalpha phosphorylation by SQE. Compared with two bioactive compounds that have previously been identified in SQE, tricin and P-coumaric acid, SQE exhibited the most effective anti-inflammatory properties. CONCLUSIONS: SQE exhibited intestinal anti-inflammatory activity by inhibiting various inflammatory mediators mediated through nuclear transcription factor kappa-B (NF-kB) activation. Thus, SQE has the potential to ameliorate inflammation-related diseases, including IBD, by limiting excessive production of pro-inflammatory mediators.},

The aim of this study was to assess the effect of vitamin D supplementation with respect to dosage and patient compliance. METHODS: A prospective cohort study of 167 Crohn disease/ulcerative colitis outpatients. Patients were screened for serum vitamin D (25OHD2+3) at the end of summer and in late winter. Demographic data, history of vitamin D supplementation were recorded and matched with prescription records. RESULTS: A total of 57 subjects used vitamin D supplementation (mean dose 1104 IU/day). 25OHD2+3 levels were lower (p < 0.001) in winter both in substituted and unsubstituted group, without any differences between groups within the same season. 25OHD2+3 levels did not correlate with the substitution dose. 52.1 % of subjects were fully compliant with substitution. 25OHD2+3 and prevalence of vitamin D deficit in this group were comparable with unsubstituted subjects except a higher prevalence of vitamin D insufficiency (p < 0.02). CONCLUSION: Fixed dosage of 1100 IU/day of vitamin D was insufficient to correct the deficiency. Patient compliance with vitamin D supplementation was low, however this fact did not significantly contribute to the degree of vitamin D deficiency in this dosage (Tab. 3, Fig. 1, Ref. 21).},

   abstract = {The seeds of Phaseolus calcaratus Roxburgh (PHCR) are common legumes that comprise part of the daily diet in Chinese and Korean culture. Recent findings highlight anti-inflammatory and anti-septic potentials of catechin-7-O-beta-D-glucopyranoside (CGP) isolated from PHCR seeds. We investigated the intestinal anti-inflammatory activity and associated mechanisms of CGP using a rat model of trinitrobenzenesulfonic acid (TNBS)-induced colitis. Oral treatment with CGP (10mg/kg body weight) suppressed body weight loss and intestinal inflammatory damages in TNBS-induced colitic rats. This treatment reduced myeloperoxidase activity and malondialdehyde level, but increased glutathione level in the TNBS colitic rats. CGP treatment also inhibited the TNBS-mediated increases in nitric oxide synthase, cyclooxygenase-2, interleukin-1beta, tumor necrosis factor-alpha, intercellular adhesion molecule-1, and monocyte chemotactic protein-1 proteins or mRNA levels. This inhibition was accompanied by the increased mRNA levels of mucins MUC2 and MUC3. The CGP treatment prevented phosphorylation of p38 mitogen-activated protein kinase, IkappaB-alpha, and DNA-nuclear factor-kappaB binding, all of which were increased in the inflamed colons of TNBS-treated rats. Furthermore, oral administration with a crude PHCR butanol extract (100mg/kg body weight) which contains 1.5% of CGP showed intestinal anti-inflammatory potentials similar to that of CGP. Collectively, our current findings suggest that CGP or CGP-containing PHCR seeds may have favorable effects on intestinal inflammatory diseases.},

The therapeutic goal for UC patients is inducing remission, maintaining remission, and ideally, obtaining mucosal healing. Vedolizumab, approved by the US Food and Drug Administration in May 2014 for the treatment of moderate-to-severe UC and Crohn's disease, is a newly developed anti-integrin therapy. This review focuses on the preclinical development of vedolizumab and data from early trials, and details the results of the landmark trails that led to its approval in the USA with a specific focus on the management of UC. Additionally, data on safety and the current UC management protocols are also discussed.},

According to intestinal dysfunction, a wide array of pathogenetic pathways is existing leading to iron deficiency and numerous vitamins as well as trace element deficiencies. Complications, symptoms and signs of those deficiencies are common in IBD with varying degrees of clinical significance. This review focuses on selected micronutrients including iron, zinc, magnesium and some vitamins. Epidemiology with respect to IBD, pathophysiology, diagnosis and clinical aspects are addressed. Finally, some suggestions for treatment of deficient situations are discussed. In conclusion, some micronutrients have significant impact on complications and quality of life in IBD. Deficiencies may even influence the course of the disease. Those deficiencies should be thoroughly supplemented.},

   abstract = {Midkine is a multifunctional cytokine and growth factor displaying proinflammatory and pro-tumorigenic activity. Its association with bowel diseases has not been fully elucidated. Our purpose was to delineate midkine expression pattern by RT-qPCR in inflamed/cancerous bowel (n=208) and whole blood (n=150) in colorectal cancer (CRC), Crohn's disease (CD), and ulcerative colitis (UC) and to evaluate midkine dynamics in early postoperative period following colorectal surgery. The expression of midkine was significantly up-regulated in stage III CRC and independently associated with lymph node metastasis. The expression of midkine in whole blood was up-regulated solely in N1 CRC. Midkine expression in cancer-free tissue (CRC) was also elevated and dependent on CRC advancement. In IBD, inflammation increased the bowel expression of midkine solely in UC, in a manner proportional to the disease clinical activity. Large and small bowel differed with respect to the expression of midkine in quiescent tissue (higher in small bowel) and to its correlation pattern with chemokines (in a large bowel) and angiogenic factors and cell cycle regulators (in a small bowel). Circulating midkine and its expression in whole blood dropped directly following colorectal surgery; however, the concentration of midkine in serum was restored on postoperative day three. Midkine is involved in bowel inflammation in UC and lymph node metastasis in CRC, rendering midkine an attractive target for their treatment. Owing to midkine elevation in early postoperative period and its overexpression in tumor-adjacent tissue, targeting midkine might be considered also as a prevention of CRC recurrence following curative tumor resection.},

   abstract = {OBJECTIVE: We performed a systematic review for Complementary and Alternative Medicine [CAM] as defined by the National Institute of Health in Inflammatory Bowel Disease [IBD], ie Crohn's disease [CD] and ulcerative colitis [UC], with the exception of dietary and nutritional supplements, and manipulative therapies. METHODS: A computerized search of databases [Cochrane Library, Pubmed/Medline, PsychINFO, and Scopus] through March 2014 was performed. We screened the reference sections of original studies and systematic reviews in English language for CAM in IBD, CD and UC. Randomized controlled trials [RCT] and controlled trials [CT] were referred and assessed using the Cochrane risk of bias tool. RESULTS: A total of: 26 RCT and 3 CT for herbal medicine, eg aloe-vera gel, andrographis paniculata, artemisia absinthium, barley foodstuff, boswellia serrata, cannabis, curcumin, evening primrose oil, Myrrhinil intest(R), plantago ovata, silymarin, sophora, tormentil, wheatgrass-juice and wormwood; 1 RCT for trichuris suis ovata; 7 RCT for mind/body interventions such as lifestyle modification, hypnotherapy, relaxation training and mindfulness; and 2 RCT in acupuncture; were found. Risk of bias was quite heterogeneous. Best evidence was found for herbal therapy, ie plantago ovata and curcumin in UC maintenance therapy, wormwood in CD, mind/body therapy and self-intervention in UC, and acupuncture in UC and CD. CONCLUSIONS: Complementary and alternative therapies might be effective for the treatment of inflammatory bowel diseases; however, given the low number of trials and the heterogeneous methodological quality of trials, further in-depth research is necessary.},

   abstract = {Some of the most common symptoms of the inflammatory bowel diseases (IBD, which include ulcerative colitis and Crohn's disease) are abdominal pain, diarrhea, and weight loss. It is therefore not surprising that clinicians and patients have wondered whether dietary patterns influence the onset or course of IBD. The question of what to eat is among the most commonly asked by patients, and among the most difficult to answer for clinicians. There are substantial variations in dietary behaviors of patients and recommendations for them, although clinicians do not routinely endorse specific diets for patients with IBD. Dietary clinical trials have been limited by their inability to include a placebo control, contamination of study groups, and inclusion of patients receiving medical therapies. Additional challenges include accuracy of information on dietary intake, complex interactions between foods consumed, and differences in food metabolism among individuals. We review the roles of diet in the etiology and management of IBD based on plausible mechanisms and clinical evidence. Researchers have learned much about the effects of diet on the mucosal immune system, epithelial function, and the intestinal microbiome; these findings could have significant practical implications. Controlled studies of patients receiving enteral nutrition and observations made from patients on exclusion diets have shown that components of whole foods can have deleterious effects for patients with IBD. Additionally, studies in animal models suggested that certain nutrients can reduce intestinal inflammation. In the future, engineered diets that restrict deleterious components but supplement beneficial nutrients could be used to modify the luminal intestinal environment of patients with IBD; these might be used alone or in combination with immunosuppressive agents, or as salvage therapy for patients who do not respond or lose responsiveness to medical therapies. Stricter diets might be required to induce remission, and more sustainable exclusion diets could be used to maintain long-term remission.},

   abstract = {OBJECTIVE: Iron deficiency is a common complication in patients with IBD and oral iron therapy is suggested to exacerbate IBD symptoms. We performed an open-labelled clinical trial to compare the effects of per oral (PO) versus intravenous (IV) iron replacement therapy (IRT). DESIGN: The study population included patients with Crohn's disease (CD; N=31), UC (N=22) and control subjects with iron deficiency (non-inflamed, NI=19). After randomisation, participants received iron sulfate (PO) or iron sucrose (IV) over 3 months. Clinical parameters, faecal bacterial communities and metabolomes were assessed before and after intervention. RESULTS: Both PO and IV treatments ameliorated iron deficiency, but higher ferritin levels were observed with IV. Changes in disease activity were independent of iron treatment types. Faecal samples in IBD were characterised by marked interindividual differences, lower phylotype richness and proportions of Clostridiales. Metabolite analysis also showed separation of both UC and CD from control anaemic participants. Major shifts in bacterial diversity occurred in approximately half of all participants after IRT, but patients with CD were most susceptible. Despite individual-specific changes in phylotypes due to IRT, PO treatment was associated with decreased abundances of operational taxonomic units assigned to the species Faecalibacterium prausnitzii, Ruminococcus bromii, Dorea sp. and Collinsella aerofaciens. Clear IV-specific and PO-specific fingerprints were evident at the level of metabolomes, with changes affecting cholesterol-derived host substrates. CONCLUSIONS: Shifts in gut bacterial diversity and composition associated with iron treatment are pronounced in IBD participants. Despite similar clinical outcome, oral administration differentially affects bacterial phylotypes and faecal metabolites compared with IV therapy.

Nowadays, although scurvy tends to become a forgotten disease in developed country, rare cases still occur, especially in people undergoing extreme diet, old people or children with poor diet and patients with malabsorption. We describe three cases of scurvy. The first case is a patient diagnosed with Crohn's disease, the second one is in a context of anorexia nervosa and drug addiction, and the third case is in a context of social isolation. Early recognition of scurvy can be difficult because symptoms may appear nonspecific and can mimic more common conditions. In any patient with spontaneous hematoma and purpura, in the context of nutritional disorder, scurvy should be systematically considered. As this disease can lead to severe complications, such as bone pain, heart failure or gastrointestinal symptoms, nothing should delay vitamin C supplementation, which is a simple and rapidly effective treatment.},

   abstract = {It is important to have clear goals for treating inflammatory bowel disease in clinical practice and in research. Conventional end points for trials in ulcerative colitis and Crohn's disease have been based on composite indices, such as the Mayo Clinic Score and the Crohn's Disease Activity Index; these indices incorporate symptoms, signs, and findings from laboratory tests and sometimes endoscopic assessments. Although definitions of clinical response and remission have been based on these indices for regulatory purposes, they are difficult to apply to practice because they are complex and not intuitive to clinicians. This has caused a disconnect between clinical trials and practice. Recently, the use of composite indices in trials has been reevaluated in Food and Drug Administration-sponsored Gastroenterology Regulatory Endpoints and the Advancement of Therapeutics workshops due to concerns about the validity of the indices. Alternative measures of outcome and definitions of response are being developed. Patient-reported outcomes are psychometric instruments created and defined by patients to quantify symptoms. A combination of end points, comprising patient-reported outcomes and objective evaluation of inflammation by endoscopy, offers a clinically meaningful and scientifically valid alternative to existing composite indices. Unlike composite indices, response definitions based on endoscopy and patient-reported outcomes can be readily applied in practice. This convergence of outcome assessment in clinical trials and practice could expedite implementation of "treat-to-target" algorithms, in which therapy is progressively intensified until a specific treatment goal is reached. This approach could improve patient care by reducing rates of disease-related complications, surgery, and hospitalization.},

   abstract = {The most common question asked by patients with inflammatory bowel disease (IBD) is, "Doctor, what should I eat?" Findings from epidemiology studies have indicated that diets high in animal fat and low in fruits and vegetables are the most common pattern associated with an increased risk of IBD. Low levels of vitamin D also appear to be a risk factor for IBD. In murine models, diets high in fat, especially saturated animal fats, also increase inflammation, whereas supplementation with omega 3 long-chain fatty acids protect against intestinal inflammation. Unfortunately, omega 3 supplements have not been shown to decrease the risk of relapse in patients with Crohn's disease. Dietary intervention studies have shown that enteral therapy, with defined formula diets, helps children with Crohn's disease and reduces inflammation and dysbiosis. Although fiber supplements have not been shown definitively to benefit patients with IBD, soluble fiber is the best way to generate short-chain fatty acids such as butyrate, which has anti-inflammatory effects. Addition of vitamin D and curcumin has been shown to increase the efficacy of IBD therapy. There is compelling evidence from animal models that emulsifiers in processed foods increase risk for IBD. We discuss current knowledge about popular diets, including the specific carbohydrate diet and diet low in fermentable oligo-, di-, and monosaccharides and polyols. We present findings from clinical and basic science studies to help gastroenterologists navigate diet as it relates to the management of IBD.},

   abstract = {To date, associations between consumption of vegetables and fruit and the risk of inflammatory bowel disease have been a controversial subject. Therefore, we carried out a meta-analysis to evaluate the associations. A comprehensive search was performed in PubMed, Embase, Web of Science, and the China National Knowledge Infrastructure to identify all relevant studies. Pooled odds ratios (ORs) with 95% confidence intervals (CIs) from random-effects or fixed-effects models were calculated. Publication bias was estimated using Egger's test and the funnel plot. A total of 14 case-control studies were included in this meta-analysis. On the basis of the highest versus the lowest analysis, consumption of vegetables was associated inversely with the risk of ulcerative colitis (UC) (OR=0.71, 95% CI 0.58-0.88, n=9 studies), but not with Crohn's disease (CD) (OR=0.66, 95% CI 0.40-1.09, n=8 studies). Higher consumption of fruit was associated inversely with the risk of UC (OR=0.69, 95% CI 0.49-0.96, n=8 studies) and CD (OR=0.57, 95% CI 0.44-0.74, n=10 studies). For intake of vegetables and the risk of CD, subgroup analysis showed a significant association for studies carried out in Europe (OR=0.36, 95% CI 0.23-0.57), but not in Asia (OR=1.00, 95% CI 0.50-2.03). No significant publication bias was found for the analysis of intake of vegetables and the risk of UC, intake of fruit and the risk of UC, and intake of vegetables and the risk of CD. This meta-analysis indicates that consumption of vegetables and fruit might be associated inversely with the risk of UC and CD, and the results need to be further confirmed.},

   abstract = {INTRODUCTION: Vedolizumab was recently approved by the Food and Drug Administration for the treatment of moderate to severe ulcerative colitis [UC] and Crohn's disease [CD]. No study to date has examined the rate of postoperative infectious complications among patients who received vedolizumab in the perioperative period. We sought to determine the 30-day postoperative infectious complication rate among inflammatory bowel disease [IBD] patients who received vedolizumab within 12 weeks of an abdominal operation as compared to patients who received tumour necrosis factor alpha [TNFalpha] inhibitors or no biological therapy. METHODS: A retrospective chart review between May 1, 2014 and December 31, 2015 of adult IBD patients who underwent an abdominal operation was performed. The study cohort comprised patients who received vedolizumab within 12 weeks of their abdominal operation and the control cohorts were patients who received TNFalpha inhibitors or no biological therapy. RESULTS: In total, 94 patients received vedolizumab within 12 weeks of an abdominal operation. Fifty experienced postoperative complications [53%], 35 of which were surgical site infections [SSIs] [36%]. The vedolizumab group experienced significantly higher rates of any postoperative infection [53% vs 33% anti-TNF and 28% non-biologics; p<0.001] and SSI [37% vs 10% and 13%; p<0.001]. On univariate and multivariate analysis, exposure to vedolizumab remained a significant predictor of postoperative SSI [p<0.001]. CONCLUSIONS: Thirty-seven per cent of IBD patients who received vedolizumab within 30 days of a major abdominal operation experienced a 30-day postoperative SSI, significantly higher than patients receiving TNFalpha inhibitors or no biological therapy. Vedolizumab within 12 weeks of surgery remained the only predictor of 30-day postoperative SSI on multivariate analysis.},

   abstract = {BACKGROUND: An epidemiological association implicating diet in IBD risk or protection is widely accepted. Patients with IBD often make links to diet, but there is a dearth of literature exploring dietary perceptions and practices in this population. Our objective was to evaluate dietary beliefs and behaviors in IBD patients. METHODS: We developed a questionnaire assessing demographics, dietary beliefs and habits in IBD patients. This was prospectively administered to 400 consecutive patients attending our IBD clinics. RESULTS: Mean patient age was 48.4 years; 55% were female, 88% white, 39% had Crohn's disease and 51% had ulcerative colitis. Around 48% felt that diet could be the initiating factor in IBD and 57% felt it could trigger a flare. Worsening symptoms with certain foods was reported by 60%. About 66% deprived themselves of their favorite foods in order to prevent relapse. Three-fourth of patients believed that IBD affects appetite, more so during a relapse. Nearly half had never received any formal dietary advice, and two-thirds requested for further dietary advice. After adjusting for other predictors, the IBD subtype and ethnicity of the patients remained as significant factors for influencing beliefs held by patients. CONCLUSIONS: Our study showed that patients hold beliefs pertaining to the role of diet in IBD, with a high level of consistency around key perceived triggers. Whether all the symptoms reported are due to active inflammation cannot be ascertained, but the potential exists for dietary components triggering active disease and perpetuating gut injury, impacting on quality of life and health care costs.},

   abstract = {BACKGROUND: Crohn's disease (CD) is a chronic inflammatory disease of the gastrointestinal tract. Current medications have potentially serious side effects. Hence, there is increasing interest in alternative therapies. We previously demonstrated the anti-inflammatory effects of Food Allergy Herbal Formula-2 in vitro on peripheral blood mononuclear cells (PBMCs) and mucosa from CD subjects. Here, we investigated the anti-inflammatory effects of a bioactive compound isolated from Ganoderma lucidum (G. lucidum), a key herbal constituent of Food Allergy Herbal Formula-2, in CD in vitro. METHODS: Triterpene ganoderic acid C1 (GAC1) was isolated from G. lucidum. Stimulated RAW 264.7 macrophages were treated with GAC1. Human PBMCs and colonic biopsies were obtained from children with CD and cultured with or without GAC1. TNF-alpha and other proinflammatory cytokine levels were measured in the culture supernatant. NF-kappaB signaling was investigated in PBMCs and colonic mucosa treated with GAC1 by In-Cell Western and Western blot analysis. RESULTS: GAC1 decreased TNF-alpha production by macrophages and PBMCs from CD subjects. GAC1 significantly decreased TNF-alpha, IFN-gamma, and IL-17A production by inflamed colonic biopsies from CD subjects. These effects were due to downregulation of the NF-kappaB signaling pathway. CONCLUSIONS: GAC1 inhibited production of TNF-alpha and other proinflammatory cytokines by PBMCs and inflamed CD colonic mucosa due to blockage of NF-kappaB activation. GAC1 is a key beneficial constituent in G. lucidum and the Food Allergy Herbal Formula-2 in suppressing the inflammatory cytokines found in CD and warrants clinical investigation for the treatment of CD.},

   abstract = {OBJECTIVE: Association of Signal transducers and activators of transcription-4 (STAT4) gene polymorphism with susceptibility to inflammatory bowel disease have been investigated in a number of epidemiological studies, but the results are inclusive. The aim of this meta-analysis was to more precisely estimate the relationship. METHODS: The databases of Pubmed and CBM updated to October, 2014 were retrieved. Random- or fixed-effect model was used to estimate odd radio (OR) and corresponding 95% confidence interval (95%CI) on the basis of heterogeneity. RESULTS: Seven articles containing 2196 Crohn's disease (CD) cases, 1588 ulcerative colitis (UC) cases and 4126 controls were identified. We detected a significant association between STAT4 rs7574865 polymorphism and IBD susceptibility in overall population (GG vs. GT+TT, OR=0.855, 95% CI=0.760-0.962, P=0.009), but not in Caucasian and Asian population, respectively. No association was detected between rs7574865 polymorphism and CD susceptibility in overall, Asian and Caucasian population, respectively. Interestingly, a significant association was detected between rs7574865 with UC susceptibility in overall population (G vs. T, OR=0.881, 95% CI=0.798-0.972, P=0.012; GG vs. GT+TT, OR=0.788, 95% CI=0.679-0.914, P=0.002; GG vs. TT, OR=0.683, 95% CI=0.498-0.937, P=0.018) and Caucasians (GG vs. GT+TT, OR=0.833, 95% CI=0.701-0.990, P=0.038; GG+GT vs. TT, OR=0.667, 95% CI=0.456-0.975, P=0.037; GG vs. TT, OR=0.636, 95% CI=0.433-0.934, P=0.021), respectively, and a possible association was found in Asian population (GG vs. GT+TT, OR=0.709, 95% CI=0.503-0.998, P=0.049). CONCLUSIONS: STAT4 rs7574865 gene is IBD risk factor, and this gene polymorphism is associated with UC susceptibility, especially in Caucasians. To confirm these findings, further studies with more sample size are required for a definitive conclusion.},

This meta-analysis was performed to quantitatively summarize the evidence from observational studies. PubMed, Embase, and Web of Knowledge were searched for relevant articles published up to November 2014. The combined relative risks were calculated with the fixed- or random-effects model. Dose-response relationship was assessed using restricted cubic spline model. We hypothesized that the meta-analysis could yield a summary effect, which would indicate that dietary fiber intake could decrease the risk of ulcerative colitis and Crohn disease (CD). Overall, 8 articles involving 2 cohort studies, 1 nested case-control study, and 5 case-control studies were finally included in this study. The pooled relative risks with 95% confidence intervals of ulcerative colitis and CD for the highest vs lowest categories of dietary fiber intake were 0.80 (0.64-1.00) and 0.44 (0.29-0.69), respectively. A linear dose-response relationship was found between dietary fiber and CD risk, and the risk of CD decreased by 13% (P < .05) for every 10 g/d increment in fiber intake. The results from this meta-analysis indicated that the intake of dietary fiber was significantly associated with a decreased risk of inflammatory bowel disease.},

   abstract = {AIM: To assess the evolution of duodenal lymphocytosis (DL), a condition characterized by increased intraepithelial lymphocytes (IELs), over 2 years of follow-up. METHODS: Consecutive patients undergoing upper endoscopy/histology for abdominal pain, diarrhea, weight loss, weakness or other extraintestinal features compatible with celiac disease (CD) were included. Evaluation of IELs infiltrate in duodenal biopsy samples was carried out by CD3-immunohistochemistry and expressed as number of positive cells/100 enterocytes. Diagnostic agreement on the IELs count was tested by calculating the weighted k coefficient. All patients underwent serological detection of autoantibodies associated with CD: IgG and IgA anti-tissue transglutaminase and endomysium. Each patient underwent further investigations to clarify the origin of DL at baseline and/or in the course of 2 years of follow-up every six months. Autoimmune thyroiditis, intestinal infections, parasitic diseases, bacterial intestinal overgrowth, hypolactasia and wheat allergy were detected. Colonoscopy and enteric magnetic resonance imaging were performed when necessary. Risk factors affecting the final diagnosis were detected by multinomial logistic regression and expressed as OR. RESULTS: Eighty-five patients (16 males, 69 females, aged 34.1 +/- 12.5 years) were followed up for a mean period of 21.7 +/- 11.7 mo. At baseline, endoscopy/duodenal biopsy, CD3 immunohistochemistry revealed: > 25 IELs/100 enterocytes in 22 subjects, 15-25 IELs in 37 and < 15 IELs in 26. They all had negative serum anti-transglutaminase and anti-endomysium, whilst 5 showed IgG anti-gliadin positivity. In the course of follow-up, 23 developed CD seropositivity and gluten sensitivity (GS) was identified in 19. Other diagnoses were: 5 Helicobacter pylori infections, 4 jejunal Crohn's disease, 1 lymphocytic colitis and 1 systemic sclerosis. The disease in the remaining 32 patients was classified as irritable bowel syndrome because of the lack of diagnostic evidence. At multivariate analysis, the evolution towards CD was associated with an IELs infiltrate > 25 (OR = 1640.4) or 15-25 (OR = 16.95), human leukocyte antigen (HLA) DQ2/8 (OR = 140.85) or DQA1*0501 (OR = 15.36), diarrhea (OR = 5.56) and weakness (OR = 11.57). GS was associated with IELs 15-25 (OR = 28.59), autoimmune thyroiditis (OR = 87.63), folate deficiency (OR = 48.53) and diarrhea (OR = 54.87). CONCLUSION: DL may have a multifactorial origin but the IELs infiltrate and HLA are strong predictive factors for CD development and a clinical diagnosis of GS.},

   abstract = {OBJECTIVE: To observe the relationship between vitamin D status and seasons, disease activity, disease location, growth and steroid treatment in children with Crohn's disease (CD). To search for the risk factors of vitamin D deficiency in CD children. To discuss the role of vitamin D in the pathogenesis and treatments of CD. METHOD: Sixty CD children (63.3% male) and 121 sex- and age-matched healthy subjects were enrolled. Data including growth, clinical characteristics, time for vitamin D blood test, erythrocyte sedimentation rate, C reactive protein, serum 25(OH)D concentration and steroid treatments were collected. The relationship between vitamin D status and disease activity, disease location, growth and steroid treatments in children with CD were analized. RESULT: The serum concentration of 25(OH)D was 57.2(22.3-246.0) nmol/L, which was significantly lower than that of controls (67.3 (57.3-78.4) nmol/L) (Z=-5.009, P=0.000). Hypovitaminosis D was most prevalent during the winter and spring (November to April, 46.8(31.8-83.4) nmol/L) rather than summer and autumn (May to October, 63.3(22.3-246.0) nmol/L, Z=-1.994, P=0.046). Univariate logistic regression demonstrated that factors increasing the risk of vitamin D deficiency in Crohn's disease were: age over 10 years (OR=4.571, 95% CI: 1.452-14.389), small intestine involved diseases (OR=5.211, 95% CI: 1.278-21.237), high C reactive protein levels (>/=8 mg/L) (OR=4.500, 95% CI: 1.094-18.503) and steroid therapy (OR=4.297, 95% CI: 1.413-13.068). Among those risk factors, all but age were determined to be risks of vitamin D deficiency by further multivariate logistic regression. There was no significant correlation between vitamin D deficiency and gender, disease duration, stricture, penetration, perianal disease (fistula, ulcer or abscess), white blood cell counts, hemoglobin, platelet counts, erythrocyte sedimentation rate, serum albumin levels, pediatric Crohn's disease activity index and nutrition therapy (P>0.05). CONCLUSION: Hypovitaminosis D was prevalent in children with CD. Serum concentration of vitamin D was associated with season. Steroid treatment, small intestine involved disease and high C reactive protein (more than 8 mg/L) are risk factors of vitamin D deficiency in CD children.},

   abstract = {BACKGROUND: Crohn's disease (CD) is a chronic transmural inflammation of the gastrointestinal tract of unknown cause. Malnutrition associated with active CD has been reduced although obesity has increased. Dietary strategies such as those with high-protein have been proposed to reduce body fat. This study compares the effects of two supplements on the nutritional status of CD patients. MATERIALS AND METHODS: 68 CD patients were randomized in two groups: whey protein group (WP) and soy protein group (SP). Using bioimpedance analysis, anthropometry and albumin and pre-albumin dosages the nutritional status was measured before starting the intervention and after 8 and 16 weeks. The disease activity was determined by Crohn's Disease Activity Index and serum C-reactive protein dosage and dietary intake by 24h dietary recalls. RESULTS: Forty-one patients concluded the study and both supplements changed body composition similarly. Triceps skin fold thickness (p< 0.001) and body fat percentage (p=0.001) decreased, whereas mid-arm muscle circumference (p=0.004), corrected arm muscle area (p=0.005) and body lean percentage (p=0.001) increased. CONCLUSIONS: For Crohn's disease patients undergoing anti TNF-alpha and azatioprine therapies, supplementation with whey and soy proteins changes body composition through reduction of body fat and thus contributes to control inflammation.},

   abstract = {BACKGROUND: Restorative proctocolectomy with ileal pouch-anal anastomosis is the surgical treatment of choice for patients with medically refractory ulcerative colitis. Postsurgery, functional and inflammatory complications of the ileal pouch often occur. Our previous study demonstrated that irritable pouch syndrome (IPS) is associated with the use of antidepressants or anxiolytics, suggesting an influence of psychological factors on patients' symptoms. The aim of this study was to identify the specific psychological factors and coping strategies in patients with functional (IPS) and inflammatory (pouchitis, cuffitis, Crohn's disease of the pouch) pouch disorders. METHODS: Consecutive patients with functional pouch disorders (IPS), inflammatory pouch conditions, and asymptomatic ileal pouch-anal anastomosis patients were surveyed using validated measures of quality of life (the Cleveland Global Quality of Life [CGQL] and Irritable Bowel Syndrome-Quality of Life [IBS-QOL]), daily functional impairment (WSAS), coping mechanisms (brief COPE) and anxiety/depression (DASS-21). RESULTS: Of 243 patients surveyed, 157 (64.6%) completed the surveys, of whom 137 (56.4%) met inclusion criteria and were included in the analysis. Sixty-one percent of respondents had pouch inflammation (pouchitis, N = 35; cuffitis, N = 14; and Crohn's disease of the pouch, N = 35), 20% had IPS (N = 27) and 19% (N = 26) had asymptomatic normal pouches. The age of participants ranged from 20 to 79 years with the mean ages of patients with normal pouches, IPS and inflammatory pouch conditions being 51.7 +/- 12.5, 47.1 +/- 15.0, 47.2 +/- 15.1 years, respectively. Patients with IPS were more likely to be taking antidepressants, anxiolytics, or narcotics than the other groups (P < 0.04). Patients with IPS or inflammatory pouches had significantly poorer quality of life (CGQL, P < 0.001; IBS-QOL, P < 0.003) than those with asymptomatic pouches, with differences particularly in the areas of food avoidance, activity interference, and sexual difficulties. Those with IPS (median = 11; interquartile range [IQR]: 3-19) or inflammatory pouch conditions (median = 7; IQR: 3-18) had a greater impairment in the domains of daily functioning related to the pouch condition than those with normal pouches (median = 1.5; IQR: 0-6; P = 0.003). The mean depression symptom scores were significantly higher in the IPS group than in the normal pouch group (11.7 +/- 9.7 versus 4.4 +/- 6.2; P = 0.012). CONCLUSIONS: IPS patients were more likely to have depressive symptoms and had a greater amount of impairment in daily functioning related to their pouch condition. Additionally, patients with functional pouch disorders are more likely to be concurrently treated with antidepressants, anxiolytic or narcotic agents than those with inflammatory pouches or normal pouches.},

   abstract = {Over the last 10-15 years, our understanding of the composition and functions of the human gut microbiota has increased exponentially. To a large extent, this has been due to new 'omic' technologies that have facilitated large-scale analysis of the genetic and metabolic profile of this microbial community, revealing it to be comparable in influence to a new organ in the body and offering the possibility of a new route for therapeutic intervention. Moreover, it might be more accurate to think of it like an immune system: a collection of cells that work in unison with the host and that can promote health but sometimes initiate disease. This review gives an update on the current knowledge in the area of gut disorders, in particular metabolic syndrome and obesity-related disease, liver disease, IBD and colorectal cancer. The potential of manipulating the gut microbiota in these disorders is assessed, with an examination of the latest and most relevant evidence relating to antibiotics, probiotics, prebiotics, polyphenols and faecal microbiota transplantation.},

   abstract = {BACKGROUND AND AIMS: Both science and patients associate diet with inflammatory bowel disease [IBD]. There is no doubt that links between IBD and diet are numerous, based on both epidemiological studies and experimental studies. However, scientific evidence to support dietary advice is currently lacking, and dietary counselling for IBD patients is often limited in clinical practice to the improvement of nutrient intake. This review aimed to focus on both patient's beliefs about and molecular mechanisms for crosstalk between nutrients and inflammation. METHODS: A literature search using PubMed was performed to identify relevant studies on diet and/or nutrients and their role in IBD. Pubmed [from inception to January 20, 2016] was searched using the terms: 'Crohn', 'colitis',' intestinal epithelial cells', and a list of terms relating to diet or numerous specific nutrients. Terms associated with nutrients were individually tested in the context of IBD. Reference lists from studies selected were manually searched to identify further relevant reports. Manuscripts about diet in the context of IBD from basic science, epidemiological studies, or clinical trials were selected and reviewed. Only articles published in English were included. RESULTS: Epidemiological studies highlight the key role of diet in IBD development, and many IBD patients report diet as a triggering factor in relapse of disease. In addition, we present research on the impact of nutrients on innate immunity. CONCLUSION: Diet may offer an alternative approach to restoring deficient innate immunity in IBD, and this may be the scientific rationale for providing dietary counselling for IBD patients.},

It has also been reported that the minor G allele from the rs12212067 polymorphism (T>G) in FOXO3 is associated with milder CD. The aim of this study was to investigate the association between the rs12212067 polymorphism and food intolerances for a total of 253 foods. METHODS: Tolerances and intolerances were recorded on a self-reported dietary questionnaire. Each food was scored on a 5-point ordinal scale: beneficial effects as '+ +' or '+', adverse effects as '- -' or '-', and 'makes no difference' as '='. Dietary and genotype data were available for a total of 283 CD patients. RESULTS: We identified 17 foods with beneficial effects in our study which were significantly associated with the G allele of the FOXO3 rs12212067 polymorphism. Of these, sweet potatoes had the highest reported frequency of beneficial responses. We also identified 4 foods with detrimental effects in more than 25% of our study population. These were mustard, wasabi, and raw and cooked tomatoes, which again were significantly associated with the G allele in FOXO3. CONCLUSIONS: There was strong evidence that adverse effects of mustard, wasabi, and raw and cooked tomatoes were significantly associated with the G allele of FOXO3 and that these foods should be avoided by people carrying this allele.},

   abstract = {Crohn's disease and ulcerative colitis presently have no cure and are treated with anti-inflammatory drugs or monoclonal antibodies targeting pro-inflammatory cytokines. A variety of rodent models have been used to model chronic and acute colitis. Dietary polyphenols in foods and botanicals are of considerable interest for prevention and treatment of colitis. Many dietary polyphenols have been utilized for prevention of colitis in rodent models. Berries, green tea polyphenols, curcumin, and stilbenes have been the most extensively tested polyphenols in rodent models of colitis. The majority of polyphenols tested have inhibited colitis in rodents, but increasing doses of EGCG and green tea, isoflavones, flaxseed, and alpha-mangostin have exacerbated colitis. Few studies have examined combination of polyphenols or other bioactives for inhibition of colitis. Translating polyphenol doses used in rodent models of colitis to human equivalent doses reveals that supplemental doses are most likely required to inhibit colitis from a single polyphenol treatment. The ability to translate polyphenol treatments in rodent models is likely to be limited by species differences in xenobiotic metabolism and microbiota. Given these limitations, data from polyphenols in rodent models suggests merit for pursuing additional clinical studies for prevention of colitis.},

   abstract = {We have identified a range of food phytochemicals that inhibit Janus Kinase 2 (JAK2) and Adenosine Monophosphate Kinase (AMPK). A mutated and dysregulated form of JAK2, a tyrosine kinase, is associated with several diseases including Crohn's disease. Using an in vitro, time-resolved fluorescence (TR-FRET) assay, we tested 49 different types of food extracts, plus 10 concentrated fractions of increasing hydrophobicity from each extract, to find foods containing JAK2 inhibitors. The food extracts tested included grains, meat, fish, shellfish, dairy products, herbs, mushrooms, hops, fruits and vegetables. Several fruits were potent inhibitors of JAK2: blackberry, boysenberry, feijoa, pomegranate, rosehip and strawberry, which all contain ellagitannins, known inhibitors of kinases. These fruits are in the Rosales and Myrtales plant orders. No other foods gave >1% of the maximal JAK2 inhibitory activities of these fruits. AMPK, a sensor and regulator of energy metabolism in cells, is a serine-threonine kinase which is reported to be activated by various flavonoid phytochemicals. Using a TR-FRET assay, we tested various fruit extracts for AMPK activation and inhibition. Ellagitannin containing foods scored highly as AMPK inhibitors. Despite several reports of AMPK activation in whole cells by phytochemicals, no extracts or pure compounds activated AMPK in our assay.},

   abstract = {INTRODUCTION: The causes of relapse in patients with Crohn's disease (CD) and ulcerative colitis (UC) are largely unknown. This paper reviews the epidemiological and clinical data on how medications (non-steroidal anti-inflammatory drugs, estrogens and antibiotics), lifestyle factors (smoking, psychological stress, diet and air pollution) may precipitate clinical relapses and recurrence. Potential biological mechanisms include: increasing thrombotic tendency, imbalances in prostaglandin synthesis, alterations in the composition of gut microbiota, and mucosal damage causing increased permeability. RESULTS: The clinical epidemiological data consistently reports positive associations between smoking and relapses in CD, and inverse ones with UC. For NSAIDs and estrogens, the epidemiological findings are inconsistent, although general antibiotic use was associated with a reduced risk of relapse in CD. High levels of stress were positively associated with relapse, although psychological interventions did not have therapeutic benefits. The limited work on diet has reported sulphur-containing foods are positively associated with relapse in UC, but there is no work in CD. Ecological data reported positive correlations between air pollution levels and IBD hospitalisations. CONCLUSIONS: In the future, to clarify this area, more clinical epidemiological work is required where detailed drug types and doses, and complete dietary intakes are measured, in specific forms of IBD. Such work could provide guidance to both patients and doctors to help maintain remission.},

   abstract = {Inflammatory bowel disease (IBD) is a chronic pathology that has an outbreaks course that in recent years have seen an increase in incidence, especially at younger ages. Malnutrition is frequently associated with this condition, therefore, it is very important to ensure a right nutritional intervention, especially in pediatric patients, to ensure an optimal growth and also an improvement in the clinic. Our goal will be updated the role of nutrition in this disease and in its treatment based on the published evidence. Malnutrition in these patients is frequent and is influenced by various factors such as, decreased food intake, increased nutrient requirements, increased protein loss and malabsorption of nutrients. Therefore there should be a nutritional monitoring of all of them, in which anthropometric measurements, laboratory tests and densitometry were made to establish the needs and sufficient caloric intake tailored to each patient. The use of enteral nutrition as a treatment in Crohn's disease with mild to moderate outbreak in child population, is amply demonstrated, has even shown to be superior to the use of corticosteroids. Therefore we can conclude by stressing that nutritional intervention is a mainstay in the management of patients with IBD, which aims to prevent and / or control disease-related malnutrition to decrease morbidity and mortality and improve quality of life.},

   abstract = {Probiotics and prebiotics, mainly commercialised as food ingredients and also as supplements, are considered highly profitable niche markets. However, in recent years, the food industry has suffered from a series of health claim restrictions on probiotics and prebiotics in many parts of the world, including those made by the European Food Safety Authority. Therefore, we reviewed the core benefits of probiotic and prebiotic consumption on health. A number of studies have examined the prevention and/or management of intestinal infections, respiratory tract infections, CVD, osteoporosis, urogenital infections, cavities, periodontal disease and halitosis, allergic reactions, inflammatory bowel disease and irritable bowel syndrome and Helicobacter pylori gastric infections. In fact, a deeper understanding of the mechanisms involved in human microbiota and immune system modulation by probiotics and prebiotics relies on continuous efforts to establish suitable biomarkers of health and diseases risk factors for the design of clinical trials required for health claim approval. In spite of the promising results, the performance of large, long-term, well-planned, well-aligned clinical studies is crucial to provide more reliability and a more solid basis for the outcomes achieved and to support the potential use of probiotics and prebiotics in clinical practice.},

   abstract = {INTRODUCTION: Anti-integrin therapy for the treatment of patients with Crohn's disease is rapidly evolving. Two agents, natalizumab and vedolizumab, are approved by the United States Food and Drug Administration for the treatment of Crohn's disease, with vedolizumab the primary anti-integrin used due to a more favorable safety profile. Several other anti-integrins are in various stages of development. AREAS COVERED: This review discusses the current state of anti-integrin therapy as well as suggestions for positioning of these agents in clinical practice. Emerging anti-integrin therapies, their underlying mechanisms of action, and available safety and clinical data are also reviewed. EXPERT OPINION: Anti-integrins are effective for the treatment of Crohn's disease, even in patients refractory to other therapies. Their use should be considered in patients with Crohn's disease who do not respond to, develop non-response to, or have contraindications to anti-TNF therapy. Anti-integrin therapies can be offered as a first biologic therapy, in particular for older patients, patients with concurrent multiple sclerosis (natalizumab only), and in patients with contraindications to anti-TNF therapy. In patients with more severe symptoms, providers should consider co-induction with corticosteroids if possible to hasten remission.},

   abstract = {Crohn's disease is a chronic inflammatory bowel disease of unknown cause, affecting approximately 1.4 million North American people. Due to the similarities between Crohn's disease and Johne's disease, a chronic enteritis in ruminant animals caused by Mycobacterium avium paratuberculosis (MAP) infection, MAP has long been considered to be a potential cause of Crohn's disease. MAP is an obligate intracellular pathogen that cannot replicate outside of animal hosts. MAP is widespread in dairy cattle and because of environmental contamination and resistance to pasteurization and chlorination, humans are frequently exposed through contamination of food and water. MAP can be cultured from the peripheral mononuclear cells from 50-100% of patients with Crohn's disease, and less frequently from healthy individuals. Association does not prove causation. We discuss the current data regarding MAP as a potential cause of Crohn's disease and outline what data will be required to firmly prove or disprove the hypothesis.},

   abstract = {Inflammatory bowel disease (IBD) is a chronic intestinal illness of autoimmune origin affecting millions across the globe. The most common subtypes include ulcerative colitis (UC) and Crohn's disease. While many medical treatments for IBD exist, none come without the risk of significant immunosuppression and in general do not have benign side effect profiles. Surgical intervention exists only as radical resection for medically refractory UC. There exists a dire need for novel treatments that target the inherent pathophysiologic disturbances of IBD, rather than global immune suppression. One avenue of investigation that could provide such an agent is the interaction between certain dietary elements and the aryl hydrocarbon receptor (AHR). The AHR is a cytosolic transcription factor with a rich history in environmental toxicant handling, however, recently a role has emerged for the AHR as a modulator of the gastrointestinal immune system. Studies have come to elucidate these effects to include the enhancement of Th cell subset differentiation, interactions between enteric flora and the luminal wall, and modulation of inflammatory interleukin and cytokine signaling. This review highlights advancements in our understanding of AHR activity in the digestive tract and how this stimulation may be wrought by certain dietary "micronutriceuticals", namely indole-3-carbinol (I3C) and its derivatives. Greater clarity surrounding these dynamics could lead to a novel diet-derived agonist of the AHR which is not only non-toxic, but also efficacious in the amelioration of clinical IBD.},

   abstract = {Dose selection is one of the key decisions made during drug development in pediatrics. There are regulatory initiatives that promote the use of model-based drug development in pediatrics. Pharmacometrics or quantitative clinical pharmacology enables development of models that can describe factors affecting pharmacokinetics and/or pharmacodynamics in pediatric patients. This manuscript describes some examples in which pharmacometric analysis was used to support approval and labeling in pediatrics. In particular, the role of pharmacokinetic (PK) comparison of pediatric PK to adults and utilization of dose/exposure-response analysis for dose selection are highlighted. Dose selection for esomeprazole in pediatrics was based on PK matching to adults, whereas for adalimumab, exposure-response, PK, efficacy, and safety data together were useful to recommend doses for pediatric Crohn's disease. For vigabatrin, demonstration of similar dose-response between pediatrics and adults allowed for selection of a pediatric dose. Based on model-based pharmacokinetic simulations and safety data from darunavir pediatric clinical studies with a twice-daily regimen, different once-daily dosing regimens for treatment-naive human immunodeficiency virus 1-infected pediatric subjects 3 to <12 years of age were evaluated. The role of physiologically based pharmacokinetic modeling (PBPK) in predicting pediatric PK is rapidly evolving. However, regulatory review experiences and an understanding of the state of science indicate that there is a lack of established predictive performance of PBPK in pediatric PK prediction. Moving forward, pharmacometrics will continue to play a key role in pediatric drug development contributing toward decisions pertaining to dose selection, trial designs, and assessing disease similarity to adults to support extrapolation of efficacy.},

   abstract = {The pathogenesis of inflammatory bowel disease (IBD) is multifactorial with data suggesting the role of a disturbed interaction between the gut and the intestinal microbiota. A defective mucosal barrier may result in increased intestinal permeability which promotes the exposition to luminal content and triggers an immunological response that promotes intestinal inflammation. IBD patients display several defects in the many specialized components of mucosal barrier, from the mucus layer composition to the adhesion molecules that regulate paracellular permeability. These alterations may represent a primary dysfunction in Crohn's disease, but they may also perpetuate chronic mucosal inflammation in ulcerative colitis. In clinical practice, several studies have documented that changes in intestinal permeability can predict IBD course. Functional tests, such as the sugar absorption tests or the novel imaging technique using confocal laser endomicroscopy, allow an in vivo assessment of gut barrier integrity. Antitumor necrosis factor-alpha (TNF-alpha) therapy reduces mucosal inflammation and restores intestinal permeability in IBD patients. Butyrate, zinc, and some probiotics also ameliorate mucosal barrier dysfunction but their use is still limited and further studies are needed before considering permeability manipulation as a therapeutic target in IBD.},

Alterations in their metabolism can be induced by the diseases and their complications. To study the role of trace elements in IBD patients' serum zinc and copper and their related enzymes, including superoxide dismutase (SOD), activity were measured in patients with IBD patients as well as in healthy subjects. In addition, the correlation between serum trace element levels, albumin, total protein, urea level, copper/zinc ratio, and disease activity (DA) was determined in these subjects. Serum samples were obtained from 35 patients (19 ulcerative colitis (UC) and 16 Crohn's disease (CD)) in the active phase of the disease and 30 healthy control subjects. Serum levels of zinc, copper, SOD activity, albumin, total protein, and urea were measured. The results were compared between the two groups using independent Student's t test in statistical analysis. Serum levels of zinc, SOD activity, albumin, and total protein were significantly lower (P < 0.05) in patients than controls, while serum urea level was significantly higher in patients compared to controls. Copper concentrations did not differ between patients with IBD (mean +/- SD, 58.8 +/- 20.7 mug/d) and controls (55.57 +/- 12.6 mug/d). Decreased levels of zinc and SOD activity are associated with increased inflammatory processes indicating inappropriate antioxidant system in patients with IBD. Additionally, lower levels of albumin and total protein with higher level of urea reflect metabolic problems in liver system.},

   abstract = {BACKGROUND: Certolizumab pegol (CZP) is Food and Drug Administration (FDA)-approved to treat Crohn's disease (CD). However, the efficacy and safety of CZP outside clinical trials are not well established. AIM: To report the efficacy, safety and predictors of response to CZP in CD patients treated during a 6-year period since FDA-approval at a tertiary care centre. METHODS: All CD patients who received CZP at our institution between 2008 and 2013 were evaluated through retrospective medical record-based review of steroid-free complete response (SCR), loss of response and safety. RESULTS: A total of 358 patients were included. One hundred twelve patients (31.3%) and 189 (52.8%) received CZP as their second and third biological agent, respectively. The probability of SCR at 26 week was 19.9% (95% CI, 15.9-24.5). The probability of survival free of loss of response at 2 year was 45.7% (95% CI, 32.5-59.5). A predictor of SCR was age at CD diagnosis of >40 years old (hazard ratio, HR relative to those <17, 4.69; 95% CI, 1.75-12.61). Negative predictors included present perianal fistula (HR, 0.39; 95% CI, 0.16-0.98) and prior primary nonresponse to adalimumab (ADA; HR relative to secondary loss of response, 0.18; 95% CI, 0.04-0.76). Twenty-three patients (6.4%) experienced serious adverse events and 19 patients (5.3%) discontinued CZP due to adverse events. CONCLUSIONS: Certolizumab pegol was both effective and well tolerated for the treatment of Crohn's disease in this large tertiary care centre enriched with biologics-exposed patients. It may be more effective in patients without early-aged Crohn's disease diagnosis, prior primary nonresponse to adalimumab and present perianal fistula.},

   abstract = {Objective Conditioning regimens for hematopoietic stem cell transplantation (HSCT) are well known to cause severe gastrointestinal toxicities that often disturb the oral intake of the patients followed by poor nutrition and life-threatening infection. An oral elemental diet (ED) is an easily consumed and assimilated form of liquid nutrients mainly composed of amino acids. It alleviates the digestive loading from the intestine and is mainly used for enteral nutritional support in patients with Crohn's disease. We herein report, for the first time, the efficacy of ED for patients undergoing HSCT. Methods We evaluated the efficacy of ED in a prospective cohort study. The primary endpoint for this study was the hospitalization period. The secondary endpoint was the occurrence of oral mucositis, nausea, diarrhea and fever. Patients A total of 73 patients were consecutively enrolled between March 2011 and March 2013. Twenty-three patients underwent autologous HSCT and 50 patients underwent allogeneic HSCT. The first 21 patients did not receive ED (non-ED group; NEG) while in the successive 52 patients (ED group; EG), oral ED was started before conditioning and was continued until 28 days after transplantation. Results The patient characteristics were similar between the two groups. The mean duration of ED administration for EG was 28.7 days (range, 3-37 days), and the mean total-dose of ED administration was 1904 g (range, 240-2,960 g). The median hospitalization period was significantly shorter in EG compared to NEG, (34 days vs. 50 days; p=0.007). Grade 3-4 oral mucositis occurred less in EG than NEG (25% vs. 48%; p=0.06). Conclusion Oral ED may promote an early mucosal recovery and thereby shorten the duration of hospitalization.},

   abstract = {BACKGROUND AND AIMS: A hallmark of inflammatory bowel disease [IBD] is chronic inflammation, which leads to excessive extracellular matrix [ECM] remodelling and release of specific protein fragments, called neoepitopes. We speculated that the biomarker profile panel for ulcerative colitis [UC] and Crohn's disease [CD] represent a heterogeneous expression pattern, and may be applied as a tool to aid in the differentiation between UC and CD. METHODS: Serum biomarkers of degraded collagens I, III-IV [C1M, C3M, and C4M], collagen type 1 and IV formation [P1NP, P4NP], and citrullinated and MMP-degraded vimentin [VICM] were studied with a competitive ELISA assay system in a cohort including 164 subjects [CD n = 72, UC n = 60, and non-IBD controls n = 32] and a validation cohort of 61 subjects [CD n = 46, and UC n = 15]. Receiver operating characteristic curve analysis and logistic regression modelling were carried out to evaluate the discriminative power of the biomarkers. RESULTS: All biomarkers were corrected for confounding factors. VICM and C3M demonstrated the highest diagnostic power, alone, to differentiate CD from UC with an area under the curve [AUC] of 0.77 and 0.69, respectively. Furthermore, the biomarkers C1M [AUC = 0.81], C3M [AUC = 0.83], VICM [AUC = 0.83], and P1NP [AUC = 0.77] were best to differentiate UC from non-IBD. The best combinations of biomarkers to differentiate CD from UC and UC from non-IBD were VICM, C3M, C4M [AUC = 0.90] and VICM, C3M [AUC = 0.98] respectively. CONCLUSIONS: Specific extracellular matrix degradation markers are elevated in IBD and can discriminate CD from UC and UC from non-IBD controls with a high diagnostic accuracy.},

   abstract = {Helicobacter pylori (H. pylori) infection is involved in multiple gastrointestinal and extra-gastrointestinal disorders. This review focuses on possible link between H. pylori eradication and Crohn's disease (CD) which is a chronic inflammatory bowel disease (IBD). Fecal calprotectin and; to lesser extent; fecal lactoferrin are sensitive and specific markers for monitoring CD activity. Data about link between H. pylori eradication and CD are limited and inconclusive. The infection likely shifts equilibrium between T helper 1 (Th1) and Th2 immune responses to the Th2 pattern. In subjects genetically predisposed to CD (a Th1-related disease), H. pylori eradication increases Th1 proinflammatory cytokines causing development of CD. In contrast, clarithromycin and/or proton pump inhibitors that are used to eradicate H. pylori can suppress Th1 factors, and theoretically can protect against CD, but there are no data to support this supposition. This Th1/Th2 approach seems very simplistic. Another theory is that alterations in gut microbiota form "continuous antigenic stimulation" predisposing to IBD. H. pylori infection can inhibit such stimulation through activation of regulatory T cells, and thus eradication may predispose to CD. Probiotics weren't found useful in treatment of CD. The reported data about link between H. pylori eradication and CD are currently limited. Case reports, suggesting a positive association between both conditions, provide a very little evidence. On eradicating H. pylori in CD patients and/or patients with high risk for CD, patient counseling and follow-up in addition to measuring fecal calprotectin may help monitor CD activity.

   abstract = {BACKGROUND & AIMS: Nutritional status is an important consideration in many pediatric clinical conditions. This paper aimed to examine and compare the nutritional status, represented by body cell mass (BCM), of children with cancer, Crohn's disease (CD), cystic fibrosis (CF) and anorexia nervosa (AN). METHODS: Anthropometry was measured and BCM was calculated from whole body potassium-40 counting in 259 children being treated for clinical conditions (n = 66 cancer; n = 59 AN; n = 75 CF; n = 59 CD) and 108 healthy children. BCM was adjusted for height (BCMI) and expressed as a Z-score relative to laboratory reference data. RESULTS: The CD (-0.80 +/- 1.61; p = 0.0001) and AN (-1.13 +/- 0.99; p = 0.0001) groups had significantly lower BMI Z-score than the healthy control (0.13 +/- 0.75), cancer (0.50 +/- 1.40) and CF groups (-0.09 +/- 0.95). The cancer (-1.16 +/- 1.60; p = 0.0001), CD (-1.13 +/- 1.36; p = 0.0001) and AN (-0.97 +/- 1.18; p = 0.0001) groups had significantly reduced BCM compared to the healthy control (0.07 +/- 0.93) and CF group (0.31 +/- 1.08). According to BCMI Z-score, 42.4% of patients with cancer, 41.7% of the patients with CD, 27.1% of patients with AN, and 4.0% of patients with CF were considered malnourished. CONCLUSIONS: This study demonstrates that children undergoing treatment for clinical conditions may have alterations in BCM, independent of BMI. Children with cancer, CD and AN all had a high prevalence of malnutrition. Assessment of body composition, not just body size, is vital to understand nutritional status in children with clinical conditions.},

   abstract = {PURPOSE: The value of enteral nutrition (EN) as maintenance therapy in patients with quiescent Crohn's disease (CD) has not been fully evaluated. The purpose of this study was to review the efficacy of EN for the maintenance of remission in patients with quiescent CD. METHODS: Seven prospective cohort studies evaluating the efficacy of EN for the maintenance of remission in quiescent CD were included. Three of the seven studies were randomized-controlled trials (RCTs). In all studies, patients used EN as a supplement or as a nocturnal tube feeding in addition to their normal food. RESULTS: One study compared the efficacy of elemental diet and polymeric diet. Elemental and polymeric diets were equally effective for the maintenance of clinical remission and for allowing tapering and cessation of steroid therapy. The other six studies compared the outcomes between patients treated with and without EN. The maintained clinical remission rate at 1 year was significantly higher in patients treated with EN in four of the six studies. Quantitative pooling of the studies was not feasible due to a small number of RCTs and a narrative account of the study characteristics. CONCLUSIONS: Our review suggests that EN is useful for the maintenance of remission in patients with quiescent CD. However, there are several limitations in the reviewed studies. There are few RCTs. Further, the sample size is small, and the duration of intervention and follow-up is short. Large and well-designed RCTs should be conducted to rigorously evaluate the efficacy of EN for maintaining remission.},

   abstract = {Colorectal cancer is one of the most frequent cancers in Western countries. Chronic intestinal diseases such as Crohn's disease and ulcerative colitis, in which the intestinal barrier is massively disturbed, significantly raise the risk of developing a colorectal tumour. 2-Amino-1-methyl-6-phenylimidazo[4,5-b]pyridine (PhIP) is a genotoxic heterocyclic aromatic amine that is formed after strongly heating fish and meat. In this study, the hypothesis that PhIP uptake in the gut is increased during chronic colitis was tested. Chronic colitis was induced by oral administration of dextran sulphate sodium (DSS) to Fischer 344 rats. The transport of PhIP in eight different rat intestinal segments was examined in Ussing chambers. The tissues were incubated with 10 microM PhIP for 90 min, and the concentration of PhIP was determined in the mucosal and serosal compartments of the Ussing chambers as well as in the clamped tissues by LC-MS. Although chronic colitis was clearly induced in the rats, no differences in the intestinal transport of PhIP were observed between control and DSS-treated animals. The hypothesis that in the course of chronic colitis more PhIP is taken up by the intestinal epithelium, thereby increasing the risk of developing colorectal cancer, could not be confirmed in the present report.},

   abstract = {Inflammatory bowel disease (IBD) is a complex, multi-factorial disease thought to arise from an inappropriate immune response to commensal bacteria in a genetically susceptible person that results in chronic, cyclical, intestinal inflammation. Dietary and environmental factors are implicated in the initiation and perpetuation of IBD; however, a singular causative agent has not been identified. As of now, the role of environmental priming or triggers in IBD onset and pathogenesis are not well understood, but these factors appear to synergize with other disease susceptibility factors. In previous work, we determined that the polysaccharide dietary additive, maltodextrin (MDX), impairs cellular anti-bacterial responses and suppresses intestinal anti-microbial defense mechanisms. In this addendum, we review potential mechanisms for dietary deregulation of intestinal homeostasis, postulate how dietary and genetic risk factors may combine to result in disease pathogenesis, and discuss these ideas in the context of recent findings related to dietary interventions for IBD.},

   abstract = {BACKGROUND: The Barwon area in Australia has one of the highest incidence rates of inflammatory bowel disease (IBD) and therefore is an ideal location to study the impact of environmental exposures on the disease's development. AIM: To study these exposures prior to the development of IBD in a population-based cohort. METHOD: One hundred and thirty-two incident cases (81 Crohn disease (CD) and 51 ulcerative colitis (UC)) from an IBD registry and 104 controls replied to the International Organization of Inflammatory Bowel Diseases environmental questionnaire. This included 87 questions about pre-illness exposures that included childhood illnesses, vaccinations, breastfeeding, house amenities, pets and swimming, diet and smoking. RESULTS: The factors associated with CD included smoking (odds ratio (OR): 1.42, confidence interval (CI): 1-2.02, P = 0.029); childhood events, including tonsillectomy (OR: 1.74, CI: 1.15-2.6, P = 0.003) and chicken pox infection (OR: 3.89, CI: 1.61-9.4, P = 0.005) and pre-diagnosis intake of frequent fast food (OR: 2.26, CI: 1.76-4.33, P = 0.003). In UC, the risk factors included smoking (OR: 1.39, CI: 1.1-1.92, P = 0.026) and pre-diagnosis intake of frequent fast food (OR: 2.91, CI: 1.54-5.58, P < 0.001), and high caffeine intake was protective (OR: 0.51, 95% CI: 0.3-0.87, P = 0.002). Other protective exposures for UC included high fruit intake (OR: 0.59, CI: 0.4-0.88, P = 0.003) and having pets as a child (OR: 0.36, CI: 0.2-0.79, P = 0.001). CONCLUSION: This first Australian population-based study of environmental risk factors confirms that smoking, childhood immunological events and dietary factors play a role in IBD development; while high caffeine intake and pet ownership offer a protective effect.},

   abstract = {BACKGROUND: The aim of this study was to examine environmental factors associated with inflammatory bowel disease (IBD) in Yunnan Province, a southwestern highland region of China. METHODS: In this nested case-control study, newly diagnosed ulcerative colitis (UC) cases in 2 cities in Yunnan Province and Crohn's disease (CD) cases in 16 cities in Yunnan Province were recruited between 2008 and 2013. Controls were matched by geography, sex and age at a ratio of 1:4. Data were collected using the designed questionnaire. Conditional logistic regression models were used to estimate adjusted odds ratios (ORs). RESULTS: A total of 678 UC and 102 CD cases were recruited. For UC, various factors were associated with an increased risk of developing UC: dietary habits, including frequent irregular meal times; consumption of fried foods, salty foods and frozen dinners; childhood factors, including intestinal infectious diseases and frequent use of antibiotics; and other factors, such as mental labor, high work stress, use of non-aspirin non-steroidal anti-inflammatory drugs and allergies (OR > 1, p < 0.05). Other factors showed a protective effect: such as consumption of fruits, current smoking, physical activity, and drinking tea (OR < 1, p < 0.05). For CD, appendectomy and irregular meal times increased the disease risk (OR >1, p < 0.05), whereas physical activity may have reduced this risk (OR < 1, p < 0.05). CONCLUSIONS: This study is the first nested case-control study to analyze the association between environmental factors and IBD onset in a southwestern highland region of China. Certain dietary habits, lifestyles, allergies and childhood factors may play important roles in IBD, particularly UC.},

   abstract = {OBJECTIVE: Despite dietary factors being implicated in the pathogenesis of inflammatory bowel disease (IBD), nutritional therapy, outside of exclusive enteral nutrition (EEN), has not had a defined role within the treatment paradigm of pediatric IBD within IBD centers. Based on emerging data, Seattle Children's Hospital IBD Center has developed an integrated dietary program incorporating the specific carbohydrate diet (SCD) into its treatment paradigm. This treatment paradigm uses the SCD as primary therapy as well as adjunctive therapy for the treatment of IBD. The aim of this study was to evaluate the potential effects of the SCD on clinical outcomes and laboratory studies of pediatric patients with Crohn's disease (CD) and ulcerative colitis (UC). METHODS: In this retrospective study, we reviewed the medical records of patients with IBD on SCD. RESULTS: We analyzed 26 children on the SCD: 20 with CD and 6 with UC. Duration of the dietary therapy ranged from 3 to 48 mo. In patients with active CD (Pediatric Crohn's Disease activity index [PCDAI] >10), PCDAI dropped from 32.8 +/- 13.2 at baseline to 20.8 +/- 16.6 by 4 +/- 2 wk, and to 8.8 +/- 8.5 by 6 mo. The mean Pediatric Ulcerative Colitis Activity Index for patients with active UC decreased from a baseline of 28.3 +/- 10.3 to 20.0 +/- 17.3 at 4 +/- 2 wk, to 18.3 +/- 31.7 at 6 mo. CONCLUSION: This retrospective review provides evidence that the SCD can be integrated into a tertiary care center and may improve clinical and laboratory parameters for pediatric patients with nonstructuring, nonpenetrating CD as well as UC. Further prospective studies are needed to fully assess the safety and efficacy of the SCD in pediatric patients with IBD.},

   abstract = {OBJECTIVES: To discuss current terminology and the regulatory standards and processes involved in the development of biosimilars. METHODS: An Internet-based literature search through April 2015 was performed for information related to biosimilars in chronic inflammatory disorders. Keywords were as follows: biosimilar, development, manufacturing, characterization, structural, functional, preclinical, clinical, immunogenicity, rheumatoid arthritis, juvenile idiopathic arthritis, psoriasis, psoriatic arthritis, Crohns disease, ulcerative colitis, and ankylosing spondylitis. The European Medicines Agency (EMA) and US Food and Drug Administration (FDA) websites were searched for guidelines and information related to biosimilars. RESULTS: Biosimilars are products that are highly similar to the reference product regarding quality, biological activity, safety, and efficacy. Biosimilars are biological products and not generic drugs and, thus, do not follow the same regulatory pathways as generic molecules. Rigorous early-stage structural, functional, and analytical testing, followed by nonclinical and clinical analyses comparing a biosimilar with its reference product, are required to demonstrate biosimilarity in regulatory markets worldwide. CONCLUSIONS: The addition of biosimilars to the market has the potential to improve access to biologic therapies. Many regulatory agencies have enacted stringent pathways, which must be followed for a biosimilar to be labeled and approved as such; following the pathways will help protect and maintain the integrity, quality, and safety of the biosimilar product.},

   abstract = {BACKGROUND: Dairy products may be involved in the etiology of inflammatory bowel disease by modulating gut microbiota and immune responses, but data from epidemiological studies examining this relationship are limited. We investigated the association between prediagnostic intake of these foods and dietary calcium, and the subsequent development of Crohn's disease (CD) and ulcerative colitis (UC). METHODS: In total, 401,326 participants were enrolled in the European Prospective Investigation into Cancer and Nutrition cohort. At recruitment, consumption of total and specific dairy products (milk, yogurt, and cheese) and dietary calcium was measured using validated food frequency questionnaires. Cases developing incident CD (n = 110) or UC (n = 244) during follow-up were matched with 4 controls. Conditional logistic regression analyses were used to calculate odds ratios (ORs) with 95% confidence intervals (CIs), adjusted for total energy intake and smoking. RESULTS: Compared with the lowest quartile, the ORs for the highest quartile of total dairy products and dietary calcium intake were 0.61 (95% CI, 0.32-1.19, p trend = 0.19) and 0.63 (95% CI, 0.28-1.42, p trend = 0.23) for CD, and 0.80 (95% CI, 0.50-1.30, p trend = 0.40) and 0.81 (95% CI, 0.49-1.34, p trend = 0.60) for UC, respectively. Compared with nonconsumers, individuals consuming milk had significantly reduced odds of CD (OR 0.30, 95% CI, 0.13-0.65) and nonsignificantly reduced odds of UC (OR 0.85, 95% CI, 0.49-1.47). CONCLUSIONS: Milk consumption may be associated with a decreased risk of developing CD, although a clear dose-response relationship was not established. Further studies are warranted to confirm this possible protective effect.},

   abstract = {There is increasing scientific interest in the field of vitamin D research, moving the focus beyond bone health to other disease processes. Low circulating vitamin D levels have been reported as a risk factor for several pathophysiologically divergent diseases, including cancers, diabetes, CVD, multiple sclerosis and inflammatory diseases, including rheumatoid arthritis and inflammatory bowel disease (IBD). But, therein, remains the challenge: can any single nutrient contribute to multiple complex disease mechanisms and, ultimately, have therapeutic potential? The aim of this review is to critically evaluate several strands of scientific evidence surrounding vitamin D and inflammation, primarily focusing on IBD. Epidemiological studies suggest an increased incidence of IBD and rheumatoid arthritis in countries of more northern latitudes, mirroring sunlight patterns. A considerable body of evidence supports the anti-inflammatory effects of vitamin D, at least in animal models of IBD. Although it is accepted that suboptimal vitamin D status is common in IBD, some studies suggest that this associates with more severe disease. With regard to treatment, the data are only beginning to emerge from randomised controlled trials to suggest that people with IBD may remain in remission longer when treated with oral vitamin D. In conclusion, several strands of evidence suggest that vitamin D may modify the immune response in IBD. There is a continued need for large well-designed clinical trials and mechanistic studies to determine if, and how, this emerging promise translates into tangible clinical benefits for people with chronic debilitating diseases such as IBD.},

   abstract = {Inflammatory bowel diseases (IBD) are characterized by wasting and chronic intestinal inflammation triggered by various cytokine-mediated pathways. In recent years, it was shown that T helper 17 (Th17) cells are involved in the pathogenesis of IBD, which makes them an attractive therapeutic target. Th17 cells preferentially produce interleukin (IL)-17A-F as signature cytokines. The role of the interplay between host genetics and intestinal microbiota in the pathogenesis of IBD was demonstrated. Probiotics are live microorganisms that when orally ingested in adequate amounts, confer a health benefit to the host by modulating the enteric flora or by stimulating the local immune system. Several studies indicated the effectiveness of probiotics in preventing and treating IBD (ulcerative colitis, and Crohn's disease). Furthermore, there is mounting evidence of probiotics selectively targeting the Th17 lineage in the prevention and management of inflammatory and autoimmune diseases such as IBD. This review highlights critical roles of Th17 cells in the pathogenesis of IBD and the rationale for using probiotics as a novel therapeutic approach for IBD through manipulation of Th17 cells. The potential molecular mechanisms by which probiotics modulate Th17 cells differentiation and production are also discussed.},

   abstract = {Inflammatory bowel disease (IBD) development is affected by complex interactions between environmental factors, changes in intestinal flora, various predisposing genetic properties and changes in the immune system. Dietary factors seem to play an underestimated role in the etiopathogenesis and course of the disease. However, research about food and IBD is conflicting. An excessive consumption of sugar, animal fat and linoleic acid is considered a risk factor for IBD development, whereas a high fiber diet and citrus fruit consumption may play a protective role. Also, appropriate nutrition in particular periods of the disease may facilitate achieving or prolonging remissions and most of all, improve the quality of life for patients. During disease exacerbation, a low fiber diet is recommended for most patients. In the remission time, an excessive consumption of alcohol and sulfur products may have a negative effect on the disease course. Attempts are also made at employing diets composed in detail in order to supplement IBD therapy. A diet with a modified carbohydrate composition, a semi-vegetarian diet and a diet low in fermentable oligosaccharides, disaccharides, monosaccharides and polyols are under investigation. Due to chronic inflammation as well as side effects of chronically used medications, patients with IBD are also at increased risk of nutritional factor deficiencies, including iron, calcium, vitamin D, vitamin B12, folic acid, zinc, magnesium and vitamin A. It should also be remembered that there is no single common diet suitable for all IBD patients; each of them is unique and dietary recommendations must be individually developed for each patient, depending on the course of the disease, past surgical procedures and type of pharmacotherapy.},

   abstract = {Since the first publication on "regional ileitis", the relevance of this chronic inflammatory disease condition termed finally as Crohn's disease is continuously increasing. Although we are beginning to comprehend certain aspects of its pathogenesis, many facets remain unexplored. Host's gut microbiota is involved in a wide range of physiological and pathological processes including immune system development, and pathogen regulation. Further, the microbiome is thought to play a key role in Crohn's disease. The presence of Crohn's-associated variants of NOD2 and ATG16L genes appears to be associated not only with alterations of mucosal barrier functions, and bacterial killing, but the gut microbiota, as well, reflecting a potential relationship between the host's genotype and intestinal dysbiosis, involved in disease etiology. This review aims to characterize some exciting new aspect of Crohn's disease pathology, focusing mainly on the role of intestinal microbes, and their interplay with the immune system of the host.},

   abstract = {Single formulation based delivery of probiotic-drug combination is envisioned as a superior therapeutic delivery modality for the diseases like Crohn's diseases, ulceritive colitis and Recurrent Clostridium difficile-Associated Diarrhoea (RCDAD). Keeping this perspective in mind, here we have developed natural gum [using a combination of aqueous solution of xantham gum (X) and guar gum (G)] modified sunflower oil based emulsion gels for the delivery of probiotics-drugs combination. FT-IR analysis and fluorescence microscopy together confirmed the formation of oil-in-water type emulsion gel by physical gelation in presence of the physical gelator sorbitan monopalmitate (SM). Other studies (XRD, DSC, mechanical properties and disintegration study) revealed that the variation in relative proportion of the two gums has a sporadic but significant effect on the physico-chemical properties of the gel. Post storage viability of commercially used probiotic Lactobacillus plantarum 299v (Lp 299v) at different storage conditions (4 degrees C, -20 degrees C, -196 degrees C) was found higher in the emulsion gels with respect to the control. Moreover, the gels were found suitable for sustained delivery of metronidazole (the lipophilic drug often used with Lp 299v). In conclusion, the natural gum modified emulsion gel may be used as a delivery system for the probiotic-drug combination.},

   abstract = {Curcumin (diferuloymethane; CUR) is a yellow pigment used in traditional medicine throughout history for its anti-inflammatory activity. In the last years, the scientific research has demonstrated that CUR effects are related to the modulation of crucial molecular targets, related to several pathologies including cancer, arthritis, diabetes, Crohn's disease. In this paper, two formulations of microencapsulated CUR obtained by coevaporation with polymethacrylate polymers (Eudragit(R) Retard) were investigated in vitro, ex vivo, and in vivo, and results were compared by laser confocal microscopy analysis. The permeation of microencapsulated CUR through CaCo-2 monolayers was evaluated in vitro. The mucoadhesion and bioadhesion of the CUR-loaded microparticles were evaluated in vitro, using E12 and CaCo-2 human intestinal cells, and ex vivo, by means of excised rat intestinal mucosa. After oral administration to rats, microencapsulated CUR showed a sevenfold increase of bioavailability in respect to the neat drug, with a concomitant reduction of the Tmax and a five-fold plasma concentration peak increase.},

Here, we describe meningitis caused by Listeria monocytogenes developing in a 37-year-old man with ulcerative colitis refractory to intravenous corticosteroids 10 days after receiving his first infusion of infliximab. With the increasing use of tumour necrosis factor-alpha-neutralizing agents, clinicians should be aware of the risk of opportunistic infections caused by L. monocytogenes in patients with inflammatory bowel disease following infliximab treatment. The half-life of infliximab is 9.5 days; therefore, patients tend to be more susceptible in the immediate period following infusion. Patients receiving anti-TNF therapy should be advised to avoid foods such as soft cheeses and unpasteurized dairy products.},

   abstract = {Nutrition is involved in several aspects of pediatric inflammatory bowel disease (IBD), ranging from disease etiology to induction and maintenance of disease. With regards to etiology, there are pediatric data, mainly from case-control studies, which suggest that some dietary habits (for example consumption of animal protein, fatty foods, high sugar intake) may predispose patients to IBD onset. As for disease treatment, exclusive enteral nutrition (EEN) is an extensively studied, well established, and valid approach to the remission of pediatric Crohn's disease (CD). Apart from EEN, several new nutritional approaches are emerging and have proved to be successful (specific carbohydrate diet and CD exclusion diet) but the available evidence is not strong enough to recommend this kind of intervention in clinical practice and new large experimental controlled studies are needed, especially in the pediatric population. Moreover, efforts are being made to identify foods with anti-inflammatory properties such as curcumin and long-chain polyunsaturated fatty acids n-3, which can possibly be effective in maintenance of disease. The present systematic review aims at reviewing the scientific literature on all aspects of nutrition in pediatric IBD, including the most recent advances on nutritional therapy.},

   abstract = {Systemic administration of mesenchymal stem cells (MSCs) has been shown to be safe and efficacious in humans with Crohn's disease. The aim of this study was to evaluate the safety of an intravenous (IV) infusion of adipose tissue-derived mesenchymal stem cells (ASCs) and to assess macroscopic and histological effects in the digestive tract of dogs with inflammatory bowel disease (IBD). Eleven dogs with confirmed IBD received a single ASC infusion (2 x 10(6) cells/kg bodyweight). Full digestive endoscopic evaluation was performed pre-treatment and between 90 and 120 days post-treatment with mucosal changes being assessed using a fit-for-purpose endoscopic scale. Endoscopic biopsies from each digestive section were evaluated histologically according to the World Small Animal Veterinary Association (WSAVA) Gastrointestinal Standardization Group criteria. The pre- and post-treatment canine IBD endoscopic index (CIBDEI) and histological score (HS) were calculated and compared using the Wilcoxon test. Remission was defined as a reduction of >75% of the CIBDEI and HS compared with pre-treatment. No acute reactions to ASC infusion or side effects were reported in any dog. Significant differences between pre- and post-treatment were found in both the CIBDEI (P = 0.004) and HS (P = 0.004). Endoscopic remission occurred in 4/11 dogs with the remaining dogs showing decreased CIBDEI (44.8% to 73.3%). Histological remission was not achieved in any dog, with an average reduction of the pre-treatment HS of 27.2%. In conclusion, a single IV infusion of allogeneic ASCs improved gastrointestinal lesions as assessed macroscopically and slightly reduced gastrointestinal inflammation as evaluated by histopathology in dogs with IBD.},

The aim of this study was to determine the safety and feasibility of adipose tissue-derived MSC (ASC) therapy in dogs with inflammatory bowel disease (IBD). Eleven dogs with confirmed IBD received one ASC intravascular (IV) infusion (2 x 10(6) cells/kg bodyweight). The outcome measures were clinical response based on percentage reduction of the validated Clinical Inflammatory Bowel Disease Activity Index (CIBDAI) and Canine Chronic Enteropathy Clinical Activity Index (CCECAI), as well as normalisation of C-reactive protein (CRP), albumin, folate and cobalamin serum concentrations at day 42 post-treatment. The Wilcoxon test was used to compare variables before and after treatment. No acute reaction to ASC infusion and no side effects were reported during follow-up in any dog. Six weeks post-treatment, the CIBDAI and CCECAI decreased significantly and albumin, cobalamin and folate concentrations increased substantially. Differences in CRP concentrations pre- and post-treatment were not significant (P = 0.050). Clinical remission (defined by a reduction of initial CIBDAI and CCECAI >75%) occurred in 9/11 dogs at day 42. The two remaining dogs showed a partial response with reduction percentages of 69.2% and 71.4%. In conclusion, a single IV infusion of allogeneic ASCs was well tolerated and appeared to produce clinical benefits in dogs with severe IBD.},

   abstract = {The immune response is a very complex interplay of specific and nonspecific branches that have evolved to distinguish between nondangerous and dangerous or nontolerated factors. In the past, research has focused on the specific immune system much more than the host's innate defense. Studies have shown that a key component of the immune response involves activation of the inflammasome. A direct relationship between the presence of the inflammasome and the onset of disease has already been characterized for a variety of chronic and food-related diseases, including arthrosclerosis, metabolic syndrome, and chronic bowel diseases, such as Crohn's disease and ulcerative colitis. The leukocyte activation (ALCAT test), an immunological blood test for food intolerance reactions, is ideal to identify and eliminate individual food stimuli that may act as triggers for the cellular nonspecific immune response. Although the test is not diagnostic, studies have established that it can be a useful screening tool for the identification of foreign substances that may trigger immune cell activation, particularly of neutrophils, leading to inflammatory disorders. The ALCAT test, coupled with a targeted diet that is individually tailored according to the test's results, may support immune homeostasis and provide a valuable complementary approach for therapy and overall health.},

   abstract = {BACKGROUND: Anaemia is the most common complication in patients with inflammatory bowel disease (IBD). This study aims to assess the prevalence of anaemia in IBD patients and to know its characteristics with regard to the main IBD clinical features. METHODS: An observational cross-sectional multicentre study was conducted. We included all patients who had an appointment at the 15 participating centres during the period of 1 month, and who met the following selection criteria: age >/=18, diagnosis of IBD. Disease activity was evaluated by Harvey-Bradshaw Index (HBI) for Crohn's disease (CD), and by Simple Clinical Colitis Activity Index (SCCAI) for ulcerative colitis (UC). RESULTS: One thousand three hundred and thirteen patients, were included: 54.8% female, mean age 42.8 (interquartile range (25th-75th): 31-53 years), 59% had a diagnosis of CD, 39% of UC and 2% IBD unclassified. The median follow-up since diagnosis was 7 years. The ongoing treatment was aminosalicylates (63.1%), corticosteroids (11.6%), immunomodulators (36.4%) and anti-tumour necrosis factor (27.3%). Anaemia was identified in 244 patients, representing a prevalence of 18.6% (95% CI 16.6-20.9). A majority of cases (90%) have mild/moderate anaemia (mean haemoglobin 11.3 +/- 0.8 g/dl). Anaemia was significantly higher in females (p = 0.006), but there were no differences between CDs (19.1%) and UCs (17.7%; p = 0.688). Anaemia was more frequent in patients with active disease (HBI >4; SCCAI >2) than in those in clinical remission (33.6 vs. 15.6%, p < 0.001) and in patients on steroids (36.8%) vs. other treatments (p < 0.001). Only 47% of patients with anaemia were under any specific treatment (oral iron 67%; intravenous iron 41%). CONCLUSION: Anaemia was more frequent in patients with active disease and in those on corticosteroids. The treatment of anaemia still seems undervalued, whereas more than half of anaemic patients were not receiving any specific treatment and the use of oral iron prevails contrarily to current recommendations.},

   abstract = {Inflammatory Bowel Disease (IBD) is a multifactorial disorder with many different putative influences mediating disease onset, severity, progression and diminution. Spontaneous natural IBD is classically expressed as Crohn's Disease (CD) and Ulcerative Colitis (UC) commonly found in primates; lymphoplasmocytic enteritis, eosinophilic gastritis and colitis, and ulcerative colitis with neuronal hyperplasia in dogs; and colitis in horses. Spontaneous inflammatory bowel disease has been noted in a number of rodent models which differ in genetic strain background, induced mutation, microbiota influences and immunopathogenic pathways. Histological lesions in Crohn's Disease feature noncaseating granulomatous inflammation while UC lesions typically exhibit ulceration, lamina propria inflammatory infiltrates and lack of granuloma development. Intestinal inflammation caused by CD and UC is also associated with increased incidence of intestinal neoplasia. Transgenic murine models have determined underlying etiological influences and appropriate therapeutic targets in IBD. This literature review will discuss current opinion and findings in spontaneous IBD, highlight selected transgenic rodent models of IBD and discuss their respective pathogenic mechanisms. It is very important to provide accommodation of induced putative deficits in activities of daily living and to assess discomfort and pain levels in the face of significant morbidity and/or mortality in these models. Epigenetic, environmental (microbiome, metabolome) and nutritional factors are important in IBD pathogenesis, and evaluating ways in which they influence disease expression represent potential investigative approaches with the greatest potential for new discoveries.},

   abstract = {BACKGROUND: Patients with inflammatory bowel disease (IBD) report a range of nutritional and dietary problems and high-quality written information should be available on these. There is little research investigating the availability and quality of such information for patients with IBD. OBJECTIVE: This study assessed the type and quality of written information on nutrition and diet available to patients with IBD and the opinions of patients and health professionals. SETTING AND PARTICIPANTS: Seventy-two patients with IBD were recruited from a large gastroenterology outpatient centre in England. One hundred dietitians from across the United Kingdom were also recruited. METHODS: Face-to-face surveys were conducted with patients with IBD. Questions regarding the use, format and usefulness of dietary information received were probed. Dietitians were surveyed regarding written dietary information used in clinical practice. Samples of IBD-specific dietary information used across the UK were objectively assessed using two validated tools. MAIN RESULTS: The majority of patients rated written information as 'good' or 'very good', with the most useful information relating to 'general diet and IBD'. Forty-nine (49%) dietitians reported gaps in written information available for patients with IBD. Fifty-three different samples of IBD-specific information sheets were returned, with widely variable objective quality ratings. Commercially produced written information scored greater than locally produced information (BMA tool, P < 0.05). CONCLUSIONS: Patient access to high-quality, written, IBD-specific dietary information is variable. IBD-specific written nutrition information needs to be developed in accordance with validated tools to empower patients, encourage self-management and overcome nutritional implications of IBD.},

   abstract = {Patients with inflammatory bowel disease (IBD) exhibit impaired control of the microbiome in the gut, and 'dysbiosis' is commonly observed. Western diet is a risk factor for the development of IBD, but it may have different effects on gut microbiota between IBD and non-IBD individuals. Exclusive enteral nutrition (EEN) can induce remission in pediatric Crohn's disease with a decrease in gut microbial diversity. Although there are some theoretical benefits, actual treatment effects of prebiotics and probiotics in IBD vary. High-quality studies have shown that VSL#3 (a high-potency probiotic medical food containing eight different strains) exhibits benefits in treating ulcerative colitis, and gut microbial diversity is reduced after treated with VSL#3 in animal models. The effect of fecal microbiome transplantation on IBD is controversial. Increasing microbial diversity compared with impaired handling of bacteria presents a dilemma. Antibiotics are the strongest factors in the reduction of microbiome ecological diversity. Some antibiotics may help to induce remission of the disease. Microbiome alteration has been suggested to be an intrinsic property of IBD and a potential predictor in diagnosis and prognosis. However, the effects of therapeutic modulations are variable; thus, more questions remain to be answered.},

   abstract = {BACKGROUND: Crohn's disease (CD)-associated dysbiosis is characterised by a loss of Faecalibacterium prausnitzii, whose culture supernatant exerts an anti-inflammatory effect both in vitro and in vivo. However, the chemical nature of the anti-inflammatory compounds has not yet been determined. METHODS: Peptidomic analysis using mass spectrometry was applied to F. prausnitzii supernatant. Anti-inflammatory effects of identified peptides were tested in vitro directly on intestinal epithelial cell lines and on cell lines transfected with a plasmid construction coding for the candidate protein encompassing these peptides. In vivo, the cDNA of the candidate protein was delivered to the gut by recombinant lactic acid bacteria to prevent dinitrobenzene sulfonic acid (DNBS)-colitis in mice. RESULTS: The seven peptides, identified in the F. prausnitzii culture supernatants, derived from a single microbial anti-inflammatory molecule (MAM), a protein of 15 kDa, and comprising 53% of non-polar residues. This last feature prevented the direct characterisation of the putative anti-inflammatory activity of MAM-derived peptides. Transfection of MAM cDNA in epithelial cells led to a significant decrease in the activation of the nuclear factor (NF)-kappaB pathway with a dose-dependent effect. Finally, the use of a food-grade bacterium, Lactococcus lactis, delivering a plasmid encoding MAM was able to alleviate DNBS-induced colitis in mice. CONCLUSIONS: A 15 kDa protein with anti-inflammatory properties is produced by F. prausnitzii, a commensal bacterium involved in CD pathogenesis. This protein is able to inhibit the NF-kappaB pathway in intestinal epithelial cells and to prevent colitis in an animal model.},

   abstract = {BACKGROUND: Specific nutrients or foods have been inconsistently associated with ulcerative colitis (UC) or Crohn's disease (CD) risks. Thus, we investigated associations between diet as a whole, as dietary patterns, and UC and CD risks. METHODS: Within the prospective EPIC (European Prospective Investigation into Cancer) study, we set up a nested matched case-control study among 366,351 participants with inflammatory bowel disease data, including 256 incident cases of UC and 117 of CD, and 4 matched controls per case. Dietary intake was recorded at baseline from validated food frequency questionnaires. Incidence rate ratios of developing UC and CD were calculated for quintiles of the Mediterranean diet score and a posteriori dietary patterns produced by factor analysis. RESULTS: No dietary pattern was associated with either UC or CD risks. However, when excluding cases occurring within the first 2 years after dietary assessment, there was a positive association between a "high sugar and soft drinks" pattern and UC risk (incidence rate ratios for the fifth versus first quintile, 1.68 [1.00-2.82]; Ptrend = 0.02). When considering the foods most associated with the pattern, high consumers of sugar and soft drinks were at higher UC risk only if they had low vegetables intakes. CONCLUSIONS: A diet imbalance with high consumption of sugar and soft drinks and low consumption of vegetables was associated with UC risk. Further studies are needed to investigate whether microbiota alterations or other mechanisms mediate this association.},

   abstract = {Vitamin D deficiency is common among patients with Crohn's disease. Serum 25-hydroxyvitamin D (25(OH)D) is the best measure of an individual's vitamin D status and current cut-off ranges for sufficiency are debatable. Several factors contribute to vitamin D deficiency in Crohn's disease. These include inadequate exposure to sunlight, inadequate dietary intake, impaired conversion of vitamin D to its active metabolite, increased catabolism, increased excretion and genetic variants in vitamin D hydroxylation and transport. The effects of low 25(OH)D on outcomes other than bone health are understudied in Crohn's disease. The aim of the present review is to discuss the potential roles of vitamin D and the possible levels required to achieve them. Emerging evidence suggests that vitamin D may have roles in innate and adaptive immunity, in the immune-pathogenesis of Crohn's disease, prevention of Crohn's disease-related hospitalisations and surgery, in reducing disease severity and in colon cancer prevention. The present literature appears to suggest that 25(OH)D concentrations of >/=75 nmol/l may be required for non-skeletal effects; however, further research on optimal levels is required.},

   abstract = {Inflammatory bowel disease (IBD) has become a 'prototype disease' for chronic auto-inflammatory disorders with a polygenic background and important multifaceted environmental trigger components. The environmental factors contribute both to pathogenesis and disease flares. Thus, IBD is a disease par excellence to study the interactions between host genetics, environmental factors (such as infections or smoking) and 'in-vironmental' factors - for example, our intestinal microbiota. Longitudinal intercurrent events, including the impact of long-term medication on disease progression or stabilization, can exemplarily be studied in this disease group. Whilst alterations in the human genome coding relevant variant protein products have most likely not emerged significantly over the last 50 years, the incidence of Crohn's disease and ulcerative colitis has dramatically increased in Western countries and more recently in the Asia Pacific area. An interesting concept indicates that 'Western lifestyle factors' trigger chronic intestinal inflammation or disease flares in a genetically susceptible host. To understand the disease pathogenesis as well as triggers for flares or determinants of disease courses, we must further investigate potential en(in)vironmental factors. As environmental conditions, in contrast to genetic risk factors, can be influenced, knowledge on those risk factors becomes crucial to modulate disease incidence, disease course or clinical presentation. It is obvious that prevention of environmentally triggered disease flares would be a goal most relevant for IBD patients. An increased prevalence of IBD in urban environment has been documented in Switzerland by the Swiss IBD cohort study. Several studies have attempted to identify such factors; however, only a few have been validated. The best investigated environmental factor identified in IBD cohort analyses is smoking. Other environmental factors that have been associated with clinical presentation or risk of inflammatory flares as well as increased incidence are diet and food additives. The so-called 'hygiene hypothesis' suggests that increased hygiene in childhood associated with reduced exposure to pathogens may leave the mucosal immune system insufficiently trained and thus prone to uncontrolled inflammation. Oral contraceptives and non-steroidal anti-inflammatory drugs are the 2 main classes of frequently taken drugs that have been attributed to have the potential to cause flares of the disease. What is likely to be the connection between the genetic susceptibility and the environmental triggers? There is broad evidence for a critical role of the commensal enteric microbiota as a modulator of immunologic responses relevant during onset and chronification of IBD.},

   abstract = {The incidence of inflammatory bowel disease (IBD) is steadily in the rise in Western as well as in developing countries paralleling the increase of westernized diets, characterized by high protein and fat as well as excessive sugar intake, with less vegetables and fiber. An interesting hypothesis is that environmental (food-) triggered changes of the intestinal microbiome might cause a proinflammatory state preceding the development of IBD. Indeed, an intact intestinal epithelial barrier assuring a normal bacterial clearance of the intestinal surface is crucial to guarantee intestinal homeostasis. Any factors affecting the epithelial barrier function directly or indirectly may impact on this homeostasis, as well as any changes of the intestinal microbial composition. It is intriguing to learn that some frequently used food components impact on the quality of the intestinal barrier, as well as on the composition of the intestinal microbiome. This highlights the close interaction between living conditions, hygiene, food habits and food quality with the bacterial composition of the intestinal microbiome and the activation status of the intestinal immune system. There is clear evidence that nutritional therapy is highly successful in the treatment of Crohn's disease (CD). Exclusive enteral nutrition is well established as induction therapy of CD. New diets, such as a CD exclusion diet or defined diets (specific carbohydrate diets, FODMAP diet, Paleolithic diet) are being discussed as treatment options for IBD. Well-designed clinical trials in IBD are urgently required to define the precise role of each of these diets in the prevention or management of IBD. Up to now, the role of diet in IBD is highly undermined by lay and anecdotal reports without sufficient scientific proof.},

We aimed to perform a meta-analysis evaluating serum 25-hydroxy vitamin D and 1,25 dehydroxyvitamin D among CD patients compared with healthy and non-healthy controls, the prevalence of vitamin D deficiency, and the association with disease. METHODS: We searched MEDLINE, SCOPUS, EMBASE, and Google Scholar up to March 2015 for observational studies assessing serum vitamin D levels in CD patients. A total of 63 studies were included in the following four meta-analyses: 1) a meta-analysis on the mean difference of 25(OH)D levels in CD patients compared with healthy (number of studies = 27) and non-healthy (n = 25) controls; 2) a meta-analysis on the mean difference of 1,25(OH)2 D3 levels in CD patients compared with healthy (n = 7) and non-healthy (n = 8) controls; 3) a meta-analysis on the prevalence of vitamin D deficiency (n = 34); 4) a meta-analysis on the correlation coefficients between vitamin D status severity of CD (n = 6). Subgroup analysis and meta-regression were used to discover possible sources of between-study heterogeneity. RESULTS: It was found that CD patients had lower levels of 25(OH)D compared with healthy (-3.99 ng/mL; 95% confidence interval [CI]: -5.91 to -2.08) but not non-healthy controls (-1.07 ng/mL; 95% CI: -2.84 to 0.70). There was also no significant mean difference for 1,25(OH)2 D3 for both healthy and non-healthy controls. Meta-analysis on the prevalence of vitamin D deficiency showed an overall prevalence of 57.7% (95% CI: 0.502-0.649). An inverse association was observed between serum vitamin D and severity of CD (-0.36; 95% CI: -0.48 to -0.24). Meta-regression showed that mean levels of 25(OH)D were decreased 0.09 for each unit change of latitude among CD patients compared with healthy controls (B = -0.09, P = 0.004, I(2) residual = 86.08%). CONCLUSIONS: We found that patients with Crohn's disease had lower serum 25(OH)D concentrations compared with their healthy counterparts, and more than half of them have hypovitaminosis D. Moreover, there was an inverse correlation between circulating 25(OH)D concentrations and severity of Crohn's disease.},

A number of fermented dairy products contain lactic acid bacteria (LAB) and bifidobacteria, some of which have been characterized as probiotics that can modify the gut microbiota and may be beneficial for the treatment and the prevention of IBD. The objective of this review was to carry out a systematic search of LAB and bifidobacteria probiotics and IBD, using the PubMed and Scopus databases, defined by a specific equation using MeSH terms and limited to human clinical trials. The use of probiotics and/or synbiotics has positive effects in the treatment and maintenance of UC, whereas in CD clear effectiveness has only been shown for synbiotics. Furthermore, in other associated IBD pathologies, such as pouchitis and cholangitis, LAB and bifidobacteria probiotics can provide a benefit through the improvement of clinical symptoms. However, more studies are needed to understand their mechanisms of action and in this way to understand the effect of probiotics prior to their use as coadjuvants in the therapy and prevention of IBD conditions.},

   abstract = {PURPOSE: To describe a follow-up case of vitamin A deficiency (VAD)-related retinopathy with macular involvement monitored with electroretinography and microperimetry. METHODS: Flash (ERG), pattern (PERG), and multifocal (mfERG) electroretinography were recorded in parallel with microperimetry before and during 7-month follow-up of vitamin A treatment on a 65-year-old man presented with a 1-year history of night blindness. The patient had undergone ileostomy procedure for Crohn's disease 14 years ago. His best corrected visual acuity was 6/6 in each eye. Fundus examination revealed macular and mid-peripheral yellow-white lesions compatible with drusen. RESULTS: Before treatment, PERG was reduced, and mfERG was reduced and delayed, worse in responses from the central rings. These results revealed evidence of bilateral macular and central cone dysfunction. The flash ERG showed reduced dark-adapted 0.01 ERG (rod response); a-wave of dark-adapted 3.0 and 10.0 ERG was normal but b-wave was reduced (negative configuration); light-adapted 3.0 ERG was slightly reduced. The flash ERG revealed evidence of bilateral generalised retinal dysfunction affecting the rod more than cone system. Microperimetry showed deep reduction in retinal sensitivity. Fixation stability was unstable with eccentric locus. During treatment, ERG and microperimetry demonstrated significant improvements. Fixation stability reached normal values after the third treatment week. CONCLUSIONS: This case illustrates the importance of electrophysiological investigation in early VAD-related retinopathy detection correlated with microperimetry. Our findings indicate a more delayed central cone function recovery than that of generalised rod and cone function. There was a marked correlation between ERG and microperimetric changes.},

   abstract = {Baker's yeast (Saccharomyces cerevisiae) and its cell wall components have been used as one of the alternatives to antibiotic growth promoters in the feed industry. Antibodies to cell wall mannan of this yeast (ASCA) have been traditionally used in the study of Crohn's disease (CD). We applied ASCA in relation to obesity. This study aims (i) to determine the concentration of ASCA (immunoglobulin A [IgA] and immunoglobulin G [IgG]) in obese compared with normal weight individuals and (ii) to determine if there is a correlation between ASCA concentrations, obesity indices and C-reactive protein. Forty obese individuals (body mass index [BMI] > 35 kg m(-2) ) and 18 healthy (BMI < 25 kg m(-2) ) volunteers participated in this case-control study. Binding activity of serum IgA and IgG to the cell wall mannan of S. cerevisiae was measured by enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay. More than one-third of the obese individual (35%) showed elevated titres of ASCA compared with the control group (5%). This antibody was positively associated with weight (P = 0.01), BMI (P = 0.02) and waist circumference (P = 0.02), but not with C-reactive protein. It seems that ASCA are not only specific for CD but are also associated with obesity. S. cerevisiae or a related antigen may play a role in the matrix of this complex condition.},

   abstract = {Crohn's disease (CD) and ulcerative colitis (UC) are intestinal disorders that comprise the inflammatory bowel diseases (IBD). These disorders have a significant effect on the quality of life of affected patients and the increasing number of IBD cases worldwide is a growing concern. Because of the overall burden of IBD and its multifactorial etiology, efforts have been made to improve the medical management of these inflammatory conditions. The classical therapeutic strategies aim to control the exacerbated host immune response with aminosalicylates, antibiotics, corticosteroids, thiopurines, methotrexate and anti-tumor necrosis factor (TNF) biological agents. Although successful in the treatment of several CD or UC conditions, these drugs have limited effectiveness, and variable responses may culminate in unpredictable outcomes. The ideal therapy should reduce inflammation without inducing immunosuppression, and remains a challenge to health care personnel. Recently, a number of additional approaches to IBD therapy, such as new target molecules for biological agents and cellular therapy, have shown promising results. A deeper understanding of IBD pathogenesis and the availability of novel therapies are needed to improve therapeutic success. This review describes the overall key features of therapies currently employed in clinical practice as well as novel and future alternative IBD treatment methods.},

Currently there is no cure for IBD, thus the search for new molecules capable of controlling IBD and their delivery to the site of inflammation are the goal of many researchers. The aim of this work was to evaluate the anti-inflammatory effect of the administration of milks fermented by a Lactococcus (L.) lactis strain producing 15-lipoxygenase-1 (15-LOX-1) using a trinitrobenzenesulfonic acid-induced IBD mouse model. The results obtained demonstrated that 15-LOX-1 producing L. lactis was effective in the prevention of the intestinal damage associated to inflammatory bowel disease in a murine model. The work also confirmed previous studies showing that fermented milk is an effective form of administration of recombinant lactic acid bacteria expressing beneficial molecules.},

   abstract = {AIM: Ulcerative colitis and Crohn's disease are two important chronic Inflammatory bowel diseases (IBD) characterized by prominent intestinal inflammation. Probiotics are the bacteria that promote the host health by its immunomodulatory activity. The present study investigated the correlation between in vitro adhesion and immunomodulatory properties, and to assess the therapeutic potential of Bifidobacterium bifidum 231 (BIF 231), a new strain of probiotic in ulcerative colitis in rats. METHODS: In vitro adhesion assays and immunomodulatory effect of BIF 231 on interleukins (IL-1beta and IL-10) in IEC-6 cell lines were quantified by gram staining, scanning electron microscopy and q-PCR respectively. Colitis was induced by intra-rectal instillation of trinitrobenzenesulfonic acid. Colitis was evaluated by alterations in colon gross morphology, histologically and biochemically. Colonic interleukin-1beta (IL-1beta) and interleukin-10 (IL-10) mRNA and protein expression were assessed by q-PCR, ELISA and western blot. RESULTS: BIF 231 showed better adhesion and immunomodulation by up-regulating IL-10 levels in IEC-6 cell lines. In vivo studies with treatment of BIF 231 (1.4x1011 CFU/rat/day) revealed anti-inflammatory effects both macroscopically and histologically. BIF 231 lowered TBARS, nitric oxide and augmented GSH levels. BIF 231 treatment to colitic rats down regulated IL-1beta levels with concurrent increase in IL-10 levels. CONCLUSIONS: BIF 231 exerted beneficial in vitro adhesion and immunomodulatory properties which facilitated the recovery of the damaged tissue in TNBS-induced colitis.},

   abstract = {Inflammatory bowel diseases (IBDs) are chronic debilitating disorders of unknown etiology, consisting of two main conditions, ulcerative colitis and Crohn's disease. Major advances have recently taken place in human genetic studies of IBD and over 160 risk loci for these two diseases have been uncovered. These genetic data highlight a key role for genes that code for immunological and epithelial barrier functions. Environmental factors also make substantial contributions to the pathogenesis of IBD and account for the growing incidence of the diseases around the world. Intestinal microbiota creates resistance to infection, provides nutrients, and educates the immune system and in many ways has a significant impact on human health. Aberrant microbiota composition and decreased diversity (dysbiotic microbiota) are key etiopathological events in IBD. Dysbiotic microbiota can lead to loss of normal, regulatory immune effects in the gut mucosa. This may play a central role in the development and perpetuation of chronic inflammation. Further, the expression of specific innate immune receptors that recognize microbes is altered in the IBD epithelium. Therefore, the combination of host side epithelial barrier functions and the presence of dysbiotic microbiota in the gut together promote inflammation. New therapeutic options targeting microbiota are currently considered for IBD and they may, in the future, provide means to reverse the pathogenic host-microbiota relationship into a symbiotic one. In this review, the focus is on the intestinal microbiota and host-microbe interactions in IBD.},

In this study we analyzed the pharmacokinetic profile of eicosapentaenoic acid (EPA), as the free fatty acid (FFA), in an enteric-coated preparation, in 10 ulcerative colitis (UC) and 10 Crohn's disease (CD) patients and 15 healthy volunteers (HV). Subjects received 2 g daily of EPA-FFA for 8 weeks. Plasma phospholipid and red blood cell (RBC) membrane fatty acid content were measured by gas chromatography-mass spectrometry. There was a rapid incorporation of EPA into plasma phospholipids by 2 weeks and a slower, but highly consistent, incorporation into RBC membranes (4% total fatty acid content; coefficient of variation 10-16%). There was a concomitant reduction in relative n-6 PUFA content. Elongation and desaturation of EPA into docosahexaenoic acid (DHA) via docosapentaenoic acid (DPA) were apparent and DHA content also increased in membranes. EPA-FFA is well tolerated and no difference in the pharmacokinetic profile of n-3 PUFA incorporation was detected between IBD patients and HV. Our data support the concept that EPA can be considered the "universal donor" with respect to key n-3 PUFAs and that this enteric-coated formulation allows long term treatment with a high level of compliance.},

   abstract = {OBJECTIVES: Dysbiosis of the intestinal microbiota is associated with Crohn's disease (CD). Functional evidence for a causal role of bacteria in the development of chronic small intestinal inflammation is lacking. Similar to human pathology, TNF(deltaARE) mice develop a tumour necrosis factor (TNF)-driven CD-like transmural inflammation with predominant ileal involvement. DESIGN: Heterozygous TNF(deltaARE) mice and wildtype (WT) littermates were housed under conventional (CONV), specific pathogen-free (SPF) and germ-free (GF) conditions. Microbial communities were analysed by high-throughput 16S ribosomal RNA gene sequencing. Metaproteomes were measured using LC-MS. Temporal and spatial resolution of disease development was followed after antibiotic treatment and transfer of microbial communities into GF mice. Granulocyte infiltration and Paneth cell function was assessed by immunofluorescence and gene expression analysis. RESULTS: GF-TNF(deltaARE) mice were free of inflammation in the gut and antibiotic treatment of CONV-TNF(deltaARE) mice attenuated ileitis but not colitis, demonstrating that disease severity and location are microbiota-dependent. SPF-TNF(deltaARE) mice developed distinct ileitis-phenotypes associated with gradual loss of antimicrobial defence. 16S analysis and metaproteomics revealed specific compositional and functional alterations of bacterial communities in inflamed mice. Transplantation of disease-associated but not healthy microbiota transmitted CD-like ileitis to GF-TNF(deltaARE) recipients and triggered loss of lysozyme and cryptdin-2 expression. Monoassociation of GF-TNF(deltaARE) mice with the human CD-related Escherichia coli LF82 did not induce ileitis. CONCLUSIONS: We provide clear experimental evidence for the causal role of gut bacterial dysbiosis in the development of chronic ileal inflammation with subsequent failure of Paneth cell function.},

   abstract = {Eosinophilic esophagitis (EoE) has been defined as a 'chronic, immune/antigen-mediated, esophageal disease, characterized clinically by symptoms related to esophageal dysfunction and histologically by eosinophil-predominant inflammation'. A peak value of >/=15 eosinophils/high power field has been defined as histologic diagnostic cutoff. Other conditions associated with esophageal eosinophilia, such as gastro-esophageal reflux disease, PPI-responsive esophageal eosinophilia or Crohn's disease, need to be ruled out before EoE can be diagnosed. Males are affected more frequently than females and most of the patients have concomitant allergies. Currently, the EoE prevalence is about 1 of 2,000 inhabitants in Westernized countries. The first EoE patients were described only 2 decades ago. Despite this short period, considerable progress has been made regarding the understanding of the pathophysiology, natural history, assessment of disease activity and with respect to evaluating different therapeutic options. Untreated EoE can lead to esophageal remodeling with reduced compliance and stricture formation, which represents the main risk factor for food bolus impactions. The therapeutic options can be summarized with the 3 D's, which stand for drugs, diets and dilation. Of note, as of yet, there is no EoE-specific drug that has been approved by regulatory authorities. This is, among other reasons, related to the lack of validated outcome measurement instruments until recently. Swallowed topical steroids such as budesonide or fluticasone represent the standard of care for treating symptomatic pediatric and adult EoE patients with inflammatory activity. Several trials have already evaluated different biologic therapies, such as anti-interleukin-5 or anti-IgE. Further studies are on the way. As a non-pharmacologic alternative, different dietary regimens exist. Dilation can offer long-lasting symptomatic response in case of stricturing EoE but does not have any impact on the underlying inflammation. This review highlights the latest insights regarding pathophysiology and its impact regarding current and future therapeutic strategies.},

   abstract = {Inflammatory bowel diseases are thought to develop as a result of dysregulation of the relationship that exists between the gut microbiota, host genetics and the immune system. The advent of culture-independent techniques has revolutionised the ability to characterise the role of the gut microbiota in health and disease based on the microbiota's genetic make-up. Inflammatory bowel diseases are characterised by dysbiosis which is an imbalance between pro- and anti-inflammatory bacteria and a reduction in bacterial diversity. Emerging data suggest that it is not only the presence of the gut microbiota but the functional activity of the microbiota that appears to play an important role in health and disease. Current strategies to manipulate therapeutically the gut microbiota using dietary modification, prebiotics, probiotics, antibiotics and faecal microbiota transplantation aim to restore the balance to a state of normobiosis. However, the ability of such strategies to correct dysbiosis and thereby achieve therapeutic benefit is yet to be fully characterised.},

   abstract = {Inflammatory bowel disease (IBD), including ulcerative colitis, Crohn's disease, and unclassified IBD, continues to cause significant morbidity. While its incidence is increasing, no clear etiology and no cure have yet been discovered. Recent findings suggest that IBD may have a multifactorial etiology, where complex interactions between genetics, epigenetics, environmental factors (including diet but also infections, antibiotics, and sanitation), and host immune system lead to abnormal immune responses and chronic inflammation. Over the past years, the role of altered gut microbiota (in both composition and function) in IBD pathogenesis has emerged as an outstanding area of interest. According to new findings, gut dysbiosis may appear as a key element in initiation of inflammation in IBD and its complications. Moreover, complex metagenomic studies provide possibilities to distinguish between IBD types and appreciate severity and prognosis of the disease, as well as response to therapy. This review provides an updated knowledge of recent findings linking altered bacterial composition and functions, viruses, and fungi to IBD pathogenesis. It also highlights the complex genetic, epigenetic, immune, and microbial interactions in relation to environmental factors (including diet). We overview the actual options to manipulate the altered microbiota, such as modified diet, probiotics, prebiotics, synbiotics, antibiotics, and fecal transplantation. Future possible therapies are also included. Targeting altered microbiota could be the next therapeutic personalized approach, but more research and well-designed comparative prospective studies are required to formulate adequate directions for prevention and therapy.},

   abstract = {BACKGROUND: Inflammatory bowel disease (IBD) is an intestinal chronic inflammatory condition and includes Crohn's disease (CD) and ulcerative colitis (UC). It has been proposed that Vitamin D supplementation may have a beneficial role in IBD. AIM: To characterize the effects of Vitamin D on cathelicidin (hCAP/LL37) gene expression, ESR, and serum hs-CRP levels. MATERIALS AND METHODS: Ninety UC patients on remission were randomized to receive 300,000 IU intramuscular Vitamin D or 1 mL normal saline as placebo, respectively. Before and 90 days after intervention, serum levels of 25 (OH)-Vitamin D3, PTH, Calcium, ESR, and hs-CRP were measured. Cathelicidin gene expression was also quantified using qRT-PCR. RESULTS: Baseline serum 25-OH-Vitamin D3 levels were not different between the two groups and after intervention, increased only in Vitamin D group (P < 0.001). Hs-CRP levels were lower in Vitamin D group after intervention (Before: 3.43 +/- 3.47 vs 3.86 +/- 3.55 mg/L, P = 0.56; after: 2.31 +/- 2.25 vs 3.90 +/- 3.97 mg/L, P= 0.023). ESR decreased significantly in Vitamin D group (Before: 12.4 +/- 6.1 vs 12.1 +/- 5.3 mm/h, P= 0.77; after: 6.7 +/- 4.5 vs 11.4 +/- 5.5 mm/h, P< 0.001). The mean fold change in hCAP18 gene expression in Vitamin D group was significantly higher than placebo group. (Mean +/- SD: 3.13 +/- 2.56 vs 1.09 +/- 0.56; median +/- interquartile range: 2.17 +/- 3.81 vs 0.87 +/- 0.53, P< 0.001). CONCLUSION: Decreases in ESR and hs-CRP levels and increase in LL37 gene expression support the hypothesis that Vitamin D supplementation may have a beneficial role in UC patients.},

   abstract = {OBJECTIVES: Vitamin D deficiency is common in children with inflammatory bowel disease (IBD). The aim of this study was to determine the safety and efficacy of stoss therapy on vitamin D levels during a period of 6 months in children with IBD and vitamin D deficiency (<50 nmol/L). METHODS: A retrospective chart review was undertaken, focusing upon children managed in the IBD clinic at Sydney Children's Hospital between 2006 and 2010. Those with a 25-hydroxyvitamin D (25-OHD) level <50 nmol/L and those who received stoss therapy were included in this study. RESULTS: A total of 76 children received stoss therapy. There was a significant and sustained increase in 25-OHD levels at all of the time points compared with baseline (40.8 +/- 7.5 nmol/L), 1 month (145.6 +/- 51.8 nmol/L), 3 months (87.1 +/- 28.4 nmol/L), and 6 months 69.2 +/- 31.3 nmol/L). There were no significant changes in serum calcium, phosphate, or parathyroid hormone at any time points. CONCLUSIONS: Stoss therapy safely and effectively achieved and maintained a level of 25-OHD >50 nmol/L during 6 months in these children with IBD. Further prospective studies are now required to confirm this finding and establish whether this intervention has other benefits.},

   abstract = {OCTN1/SLC22A4 is expressed on apical membranes of small intestine, and is involved in gastrointestinal absorption of its substrates, including the food-derived antioxidant ergothioneine (ERGO). ERGO concentration in circulating blood of patients with inflammatory bowel disease (Crohn's disease) is lower than that in healthy volunteers; thus, circulating ERGO is a potential diagnostic marker, although the mechanisms underlying low ERGO concentration in patients are unknown. Here, we focused on intestinal macrophages, which infiltrate sites of inflammation, and examined possible first-pass uptake of ERGO by macrophages. ERGO concentration in blood was lower in mice with dextran sodium sulfate (DSS)-induced colitis than in controls. On the other hand, expression of octn1 gene product and ERGO concentration in intestinal tissues of DSS-treated mice were higher than in controls. Interestingly, lamina propria mononuclear cells (LPMCs) isolated from DSS-treated mice contained ERGO and showed [(3)H]ERGO uptake and Octn1 expression, whereas ERGO was undetectable in LPMCs of control mice. Functional expression of OCTN1 was also confirmed in LPS-stimulated human macrophage-like cell line, THP-1. In conclusion, OCTN1 is functionally expressed on activated intestinal macrophages, and ERGO uptake into these immune cells could contribute at least in part to the altered disposition of ERGO in intestinal inflammation.},

As MAP has been detected in retail pasteurized milk samples, its transmission via milk is of concern. Despite its possible role in the etiology of CD, there have been few studies examining the interactions between MAP and human cells. In the current study, we applied Ingenuity Pathway Analysis to the transcription profiles generated from a murine model with MAP infection as part of a previously conducted study. Twenty-one genes were selected as potential host immune responses, compared with the transcriptional profiles in naturally MAP-infected cattle, and validated in MAP-infected human monocyte-derived macrophage THP-1 cells. Of these, the potential host responses included up-regulation of genes related to immune response (CD14, S100A8, S100A9, LTF, HP and CHCIL3), up-regulation of Th1-polarizing factor (CCL4, CCL5, CXCL9 and CXCL10), down-regulation of genes related to metabolism (ELANE, IGF1, TCF7L2 and MPO) and no significant response of other genes (GADD45a, GPNMB, HMOX1, IFNG and NQO1) in THP-1 cells infected with MAP.},

   abstract = {BACKGROUND: Crohn's disease is a chronic inflammatory disease of the intestines, mainly the colon and ileum, related with ulcers and fistulae. It is estimated to affect 565,000 people in the United States. Currently available therapies, such as antibiotics, thiopurines, and anti-tumor necrosis factor-alpha agents, are only observed to reduce the complications associated with Crohn's disease and to improve quality of life, but cannot cure the disease. Stem cell therapy appears to have certain advantages over conventional therapies. Our study aimed to evaluate the efficacy of human embryonic stem cell therapy in a patient with Crohn's disease. CASE REPORT: A 21-year-old male with chief complaints of intolerance to specific foods, abdominal pain, and diarrhea underwent human embryonic stem cell therapy for two months. After undergoing human embryonic stem cell therapy, the patient showed symptomatic relief. He had no complaints of back pain, abdominal pain, or diarrhea and had improved digestion. The patient had no signs and symptoms of skin infection, and had improved limb stamina, strength, and endurance. The condition of patient was stable after the therapy. CONCLUSIONS: Human embryonic stem cell therapy might serve as a new optimistic treatment approach for Crohn's disease.},

   abstract = {BACKGROUND & OBJECTIVES: Of the three major genotypes of Mycobacterium avium subspecies paratuberculosis (MAP), 'Bison type' is most prevalent genotype in the domestic livestock species of the country, and has also been recovered from patients suffering from Crohn's disease. Recently, a new assay based on IS1311 locus 2 PCR- restriction endonuclease analysis (REA) was designed to distinguish between 'Indian Bison type' and non-Indian genotypes. The present study investigated discriminatory potential of this new assay while screening of a panel of MAP isolates of diverse genotypes and from different geographical regions. METHODS: A total of 53 mycobacterial isolates (41 MAP and 12 mycobacterium other than MAP), three MAP genomic DNA and 36 MAP positive faecal DNA samples from different livestock species (cattle, buffaloes, goat, sheep and bison) and geographical regions (India, Canada, USA, Spain and Portugal) were included in the study. The extracted DNA samples (n=92) were analyzed for the presence of MAP specific sequences (IS900, ISMav 2 and HspX) using PCR. DNA samples were further subjected to genotype differentiation using IS1311 PCR-REA and IS1311 L2 PCR-REA methods. RESULTS: All the DNA samples (except DNA from non-MAP mycobacterial isolates) were positive for all the three MAP specific sequences based PCRs. IS1311 PCR-REA showed that MAP DNA samples of Indian origin belonged to 'Bison type'. Whereas, of the total 19 non-Indian MAP DNA samples, 2, 15 and 2 were genotyped as 'Bison type', 'Cattle type' and 'Sheep type', respectively. IS1311 L2 PCR-REA method showed different restriction profiles of 'Bison type' genotype as compared to non-Indian DNA samples. INTERPRETATION & CONCLUSIONS: IS1311 L2 PCR-REA method successfully discriminated 'Indian Bison type' from other non-Indian genotypes and showed potential to be future epidemiological tool and for genotyping of MAP isolates.},

   abstract = {Mycobacterium avium subspecies paratuberculosis (MAP) has emerged as a major health problem for domestic livestock and human beings. Reduced per animal productivity of domestic livestock seriously impacts the economics of dairy farming globally. High to very high bioload of MAP in domestic livestock and also in the human population has been reported from north India. Presence of live MAP bacilli in commercial supplies of raw and pasteurized milk and milk products indicates its public health significance. MAP is not inactivated during pasteurization, therefore, entering into human food chain daily. Recovery of MAP from patients with inflammatory bowel disease or Crohn's disease and animal healthcare workers suffering with chronic gastrointestinal problems indicate a close association of MAP with a number of chronic and other diseases affecting human health. Higher bioload of MAP in the animals increases the risk of exposure to the human population with MAP. This review summarizes the current status of MAP infection in animals as well as in human beings and also highlights the prospects of effective management and control of disease in animals to reduce the risk of exposure to human population.},

   abstract = {Crohn's disease (CD) is a chronic inflammatory condition of diverse etiology. Exposure to foodborne pathogens causing acute gastroenteritis produces a long-term risk of CD well into the post-infectious period but the mechanistic basis for this ongoing relationship to disease onset is unknown. We developed two novel models to study the comorbidity of acute gastroenteritis caused by Salmonella Typhimurium or Citrobacter rodentium in mice colonized with adherent-invasive Escherichia coli (AIEC), a bacterial pathobiont linked to CD. Here, we show that disease activity in the post-infectious period after gastroenteritis is driven by the tissue-associated expansion of the resident AIEC pathobiont, with an attendant increase in immunopathology, barrier defects, and delays in mucosal restitution following pathogen clearance. These features required AIEC resistance to host defense peptides and a fulminant inflammatory response to the enteric pathogen. Our results suggest that individuals colonized by AIEC at the time of acute infectious gastroenteritis may be at greater risk for CD onset. Importantly, our data identify AIEC as a tractable disease modifier, a finding that could be exploited in the development of therapeutic interventions following infectious gastroenteritis in at-risk individuals.},

METHODS: Vitamin A nutritional status was measured by serum retinol obtained by high performance liquid chromatography and the RDR test for evaluation of the hepatic stores. Body composition was performed by densitometry by dual-energy X-ray absorptiometry. Vitamin A dietary intake was assessed from a semi-quantitative food frequency questionnaire. RESULTS: This study included 38 CD patients and 33 controls. Low serum retinol concentrations were detected in 29% of CD patients vs 15% in controls (P < 0.005). The RDR test was positive in 37% of CD patients vs 12% in controls, which indicated inadequate hepatic vitamin A stores (P < 0.005). Individuals with hypovitaminosis A had lower BMI and body fat compared with those without this deficiency. There was no association between vitamin A deficiency and its dietary intake, ileal location, presence of disease activity and prior bowel resections.

   abstract = {Inflammatory bowel diseases (IBDs) are a group of inflammatory conditions of the gut that include ulcerative colitis and Crohn's disease. Probiotics are live micro-organisms that may be used as adjuvant therapy for patients with IBD. The aim of this study was to evaluate the effect of prophylactic ingestion of Escherichia coli strain Nissle 1917 (EcN) in a murine model of colitis. For induction of colitis, mice were given a 3.5% dextran sodium sulfate (DSS) solution for 7 days in drinking water. EcN administration to mice subjected to DSS-induced colitis resulted in significant reduction in clinical and histopathological signs of disease and preservation of intestinal permeability. We observed reduced inflammation, as assessed by reduced levels of neutrophils, eosinophils, chemokines and cytokines. We observed an increase in the number of regulatory T-cells in Peyer's patches. Germ-free mice received faecal content from control or EcN-treated mice and were then subjected to DSS-induced colitis. We observed protection from colitis in animals that were colonized with faecal content from EcN-treated mice. These results suggest that preventative oral administration of EcN or faecal microbiota transplantation with EcN-containing microbiota ameliorates DSS-induced colitis by modifying inflammatory responsiveness to DSS.},

   abstract = {Loss-of-function variants within the gene locus encoding protein tyrosine phosphatase non-receptor type 2 (PTPN2) are associated with increased risk for Crohn's disease (CD). A disturbed regulation of T helper (Th) cell responses causing loss of tolerance against self- or commensal-derived antigens and an altered intestinal microbiota plays a pivotal role in CD pathogenesis. Loss of PTPN2 in the T-cell compartment causes enhanced induction of Th1 and Th17 cells, but impaired induction of regulatory T cells (Tregs) in several mouse colitis models, namely acute and chronic dextran sodium sulfate colitis, and T-cell transfer colitis models. This results in increased susceptibility to intestinal inflammation and intestinal dysbiosis which is comparable with that observed in CD patients. We detected inflammatory infiltrates in liver, kidney, and skin and elevated autoantibody levels indicating systemic loss of tolerance in PTPN2-deficient animals. CD patients featuring a loss-of-function PTPN2 variant exhibit enhanced Th1 and Th17 cell, but reduced Treg markers when compared with PTPN2 wild-type patients in serum and intestinal tissue samples. Our data demonstrate that dysfunction of PTPN2 results in aberrant T-cell differentiation and intestinal dysbiosis similar to those observed in human CD. Our findings indicate a novel and crucial role for PTPN2 in chronic intestinal inflammation.},

   abstract = {Patients with Crohn's disease often require the use of immunosuppressant drugs to control disease activity. Such medication includes steroids, azathioprine, and biologic therapy. These suppress the immune response, and the patient is more susceptible to infection. We present a case of a 69-year-old gentleman with a history of Crohn's colitis who had ongoing symptoms of diarrhoea in spite of standard treatment. Biologic therapy was considered to be the next step, and screening for infection was undertaken prior to use. Three days following anti-TNF treatment, he became drowsy, and examination revealed pyrexia, slurred speech, and nystagmus. Investigation revealed presence of Listeria rhombencephalitis. He demonstrated poor neurological recovery. Listeria monocytogenes is an infection commonly associated with food sources. Some patients develop a self-limiting diarrhoeal illness, but in the immunosuppressed population, the clinical features may be more sinister. Cotrimoxazole prophylaxis is already recommended for those on triple immunosuppression. We propose the early initiation of this treatment, including where biologic use is anticipated. In those on multiple immunosuppressants, a diet similar to that followed in pregnancy may minimise risk of acquiring this infection. Clinicians must always have a high index of suspicion for opportunistic infection in such immunocompromised patients.},

   abstract = {Bifidobacteria have been reported to reduce inflammation and contribute to intestinal homeostasis. However, the interaction between these bacteria and the gut immune system remains largely unknown. Because of the central role played by dendritic cells (DCs) in immune responses, we examined in vitro the effects of a Bifidobacteria mixture (probiotic) on DC functionality from children with inflammatory bowel disease. DCs obtained from peripheral blood monocytes of patients with Crohn's disease (CD), ulcerative colitis, and noninflammatory bowel disease controls (HC) were incubated with fluorochrome-conjugated particles of Escherichia coli or DQ-Ovalbumin (DQ-OVA) after a pretreatment with the probiotic, to evaluate DC phenotype, antigen sampling and processing. Moreover, cell supernatants were collected to measure tumor necrosis factor alpha, interferon gamma, interleukin 17, and interleukin 10 production by enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay. DCs from CD children showed a higher bacteria particles uptake and DQ-OVA processing after incubation with the probiotic; in contrast, DC from both ulcerative colitis and HC showed no significant changes. Moreover, a marked tumor necrosis factor alpha release was observed in DC from CD after exposure to E. coli particles, whereas the probiotic did not affect the production of this proinflammatory cytokine. In conclusion, the Bifidobacteria significantly improved the antigen uptake and processing by DCs from patients with CD, which are known to present an impaired autophagic functionality, whereas, in DCs from ulcerative colitis and HC, no prominent effect of probiotic mixture was observed. This improvement of antigen sampling and processing could partially solve the impairment of intestinal innate immunity and reduce uncontrolled microorganism growth in the intestine of children with inflammatory bowel disease.},

   abstract = {BACKGROUND: Muscle wasting or sarcopenia arising from chronic inflammation is found in 60% of patients with Crohn's disease. Transcriptional protein NF-kappaB reduces muscle formation through MyoD transcription and increases muscle breakdown by proteolysis. AIM: As TNF is a potent activator of NF-kappaB, and anti-TNF agent infliximab (IFX) prevents NF-kappaB activation, to determine whether or not Crohn's patients treated with IFX gain muscle volume and strength. METHODS: We performed a prospective, repeated-measures cohort study in adult Crohn's disease patients with an acute disease flare. Patients were instructed not to vary diet or activity. Concomitant medications were kept stable. At week 1 (pre-treatment), week 16 (post-IFX induction) and week 25 (post-first IFX maintenance dose), we assessed (i) MRI volume of quadriceps femoris at anatomical mid-thigh; (ii) maximal concentric quadriceps contractions strength at three specific speeds of contraction; (iii) physical activity by validated instrument (IPAQ); (iv) Three-day food record of intake and composition (food-weighing method); (v) Serum levels of IL6. RESULTS: Nineteen patients (58% female; mean age 33.2 +/- 10.7 years) were recruited. IFX increased muscle volume in both legs from baseline (right, 1505 cm(3) ) to week 25 (right, 1569 cm(3) ; P = 0.010). IFX also increased muscle strength in both legs from baseline (right 30 degrees /s, 184.8 Nm) to week 25 (right 30 degrees /s, 213.6 Nm; P = 0.002). Muscle volume gain correlated with male gender (P = 0.003). Significant gains in muscle volume and strength were unrelated to prednisolone use. Serum IL6 levels decreased by week 25 (P = 0.037). CONCLUSION: The anti-TNF agent infliximab reverses inflammatory sarcopenia in patients with Crohn's disease.},

   abstract = {Colitis-associated colon cancer (CAC) is a pathological condition defined by the development of colon cancer in patients afflicted by Crohn's disease (CD) or ulcerative colitis (UC), two idiopathic diseases of the gut which together comprise the disease group called inflammatory bowel disease (IBD). When IBD involves the colon, affected patients face an increased risk of developing colon cancer compared to the general population. The phenomenon of CAC represents one of the most convincing forms of evidence linking the processes of inflammation, oxidative stress and carcinogenesis. A greater understanding of the molecular events driving CAC could reveal new strategies to treat IBD and reduce the incidence of CAC. Sphingosine-1-phosphate (S1P) is a bioactive lipid produced through degradation of endogenous and dietary mammalian sphingolipids containing the long chain base sphingosine. S1P signals through a family of five G protein-coupled receptors. In addition, it activates nuclear factor kappa B (NF-kappaB) and signal transducer and activator of transcription 3 (STAT3), two transcriptional regulators that serve as master switches in inflammation and carcinogenesis. Through these and other mechanisms, a causal role for S1P in inflammatory conditions including colitis and CAC has been implicated. In contrast to S1P, dietary sphingolipids called sphingadienes derived from plant food sources cannot be converted to S1P and exhibit anti-inflammatory and chemopreventive activities, reducing colitis and CAC in mouse models. In this review, we summarize recent findings implicating S1P signaling and metabolism in the pathogenesis of IBD and CAC. The potential role of oxidative stress in modulating S1P is also discussed. Further, we propose the hypothesis that dietary sphingolipids may promote or prevent CAC depending on their ability to be converted to S1P.},

   abstract = {OBJECTIVES: The aim of the present study was to identify areas for further development of clinical outcome assessment (COA) in pediatric Crohn disease (CD). METHODS: The study analyzed the measurement properties of all existing COA tools for pediatric CD in literature and published registration trials of approved drugs for pediatric CD based on criteria described in Food and Drug Administration guidance for patient-reported outcome (PRO) development. RESULTS: The Pediatric Crohn's Disease Activity Index (PCDAI) and its derivatives (abbreviated, short, modified, and weighted PCDAIs) were reviewed. The Crohn's Disease Activity Index (CDAI) and Harvey-Bradshaw index (HBI), designed for adult patients, have been adapted for use in a few pediatric CD studies. The use of PCDAI as an endpoint in Remicade and Humira trials led to the Food and Drug Administration-approved indication in pediatric CD. Common issues in measurement properties of COA tools included the absence of direct patient or caregivers' input to generate the items measuring signs and symptoms; absence of evidence demonstrating correlation with clinically relevant inflammation observed with endoscopic measures; lack of standardization in measurement, age-appropriate interviewer script, and response rating criteria for the physician interviewer. CONCLUSIONS: Available evidence indicates that CDAI, HBI, and 5 versions of the PCDAI lack adequate measurement properties for use as a primary endpoint for phase 3 trials intended to support approval of products intended to treat pediatric CD. In order to facilitate pediatric drug development, a well-defined, reliable, sensitive, and globally recognized PRO that measures signs and symptoms in children with CD and that can be used in conjunction with endoscopy-based endpoints and/or biomarkers is sorely needed.},

   abstract = {Recently, numerous studies have shown that disruption of the mucus barrier plays an important role in the exacerbation of inflammatory bowel disease, particularly in ulcerative colitis. Alterations in the mucus barrier are well supported by published data and are widely accepted. The use of fluorescence in situ hybridization and Carnoy's fixation has revealed the importance of the mucus barrier in maintaining a mutualistic relationship between host and bacteria. Studies have raised the possibility that modulation of the mucus barrier may provide therapies for the disease, using agents such as short-chain fatty acids, prebiotics and probiotics. This review describes changes in the mucus barrier of patients with inflammatory bowel disease and in animal models of the disease. We also review the involvement of the mucus barrier in the exacerbation of the disease and explore the therapeutic potential of modifying the mucus barrier with short-chain fatty acids, prebiotics, probiotics, fatty acid synthase, H(2)S, neutrophil elastase inhibitor and phophatidyl choline.},

Dysfunction of immunoregulatory factors and overproduction of reactive oxygen species (ROS) may contribute to the damage of the gastrointestinal tract. Superoxide dismutase (SOD) and glutathione peroxidase (GPx) are involved in protection of cells from the damaging effects of ROS. The aim of the study was to assess activity of antioxidative stress enzymes, GPx and SOD, in plasma and saliva of patients with active and inactive forms of CD. Forty-seven patients with CD were prospectively enrolled in the study. The control group comprised 25 healthy volunteers. Patients' demographics, clinical features, localization of inflammatory changes, CD history, and treatment were recorded. SOD and GPx were assayed in plasma and saliva samples by ELISA method. CD activity index (CDAI) scores correlated inversely with SOD in plasma (r = - 0.46; P = 0.0012), but not in saliva. No correlations were observed in respect to GPx activities in both plasma and saliva and CDAI. Higher activity of plasma SOD was observed in patients with inactive CD in comparison with active CD (P = 0.004). No significant differences in SOD and GPx activity both in plasma and saliva were found between CD remission group and the control group. We concluded that in active CD the antioxidant defence system was diminished and returned to normal values in remission. Results of SOD and GPx assays in saliva are not conclusive, suggesting that saliva seems to be not an appropriate material for further similar studies.},

   abstract = {BACKGROUND: Relationships between inflammatory bowel disease and lactose containing foods remain controversial and poorly defined regarding symptoms, nutritional outcomes, and epidemiologic associations for lactose maldigestion. METHODS: A literature review was performed using Pub Med, Cochrane library and individual references, to extract data on lactose maldigestion prevalence in inflammatory bowel diseases. A meta-analysis was done using selected articles, to determine odds ratios of maldigestion. Information was collected about symptoms, impact on pattern of dairy food consumption, as well as the effects of dairy foods on the course of inflammatory bowel diseases. RESULTS: A total of 1022 articles were evaluated, 35 articles were retained and 5 studies were added from review articles. Of these 17 were included in meta-analysis which showed overall increased lactose maldigestion in both diseases. However increased risk on sub analysis was only found in Crohn's in patients with small bowel involvement. Nine additional studies were reviewed for symptoms, with variable outcomes due to confounding between lactose intolerance and lactose maldigestion. Fourteen studies were evaluated for dairy food effects. There was a suggestion that dairy foods may protect against inflammatory bowel disease. Nutritional consequences of dairy restrictions might impact adversely on bone and colonic complications. CONCLUSIONS: Lactose maldigestion in inflammatory bowel disease is dependent on ethnic makeup of the population and usually not disease. No bias of increased disease prevalence was noted between lactase genotypes. Intolerance symptoms depend on several parameters besides lactose maldigestion. Dairy foods may decrease risks of inflammatory bowel disease. Dairy restrictions may adversely affect disease outcome.},

   abstract = {(1)H NMR spectroscopy was employed to investigate the repercussion of Origanum dictamnus tea ingestion in several volunteers' urine metabolic profiles, among them two with chronic inflammatory bowel diseases (IBD), mild IBD and Crohn's disease. Herein, we demonstrate that the concentrations of a lot of urinary metabolites such as hippurate, trimethylamine oxide (TMAO), citrate, and creatinine are altered, which prompts the intestinal microflora function/content perturbation as well as kidney function regulation by dictamnus tea. Interestingly, our preliminary results showed that a high dose of dictamnus tea intake appeared to be toxic for a person with Crohn's disease, since it caused high endogenous ethanol excretion in urine. All subjects' metabolic effects caused by the dictamnus tea appeared to be reversible, when all volunteers stopped its consumption. Finally, we highlight that individuals' metabolic phenotype is reflected in their urine biofluid before and after the dictamnus tea effect while all individuals have some common and different metabolic responses to this tea, implying that each phenotype has a quite different response to this tea consumption.},

Two presentations explored different aspects of probiotic intervention: the small intestine as a probiotic target and inclusion of probiotics into integrative approaches to gastroenterology. Probiotic recommendations in gastroenterology guidelines and current data on probiotic efficacy in paediatric patients were reviewed. Updates were given on probiotic and gut microbiota research in obesity and obesity-related diseases, the gut-brain axis and development of psychobiotics, and the protective effects of equol-producing strains for prostate cancer. Recent studies were presented on probiotic benefit for antibiotic-associated diarrhoea and people with HIV, as well as protection against the adverse effects of a short-term high-fat diet. Aspects of probiotic mechanisms of activity were discussed, including immunomodulatory mechanisms and metabolite effects, the anti-inflammatory properties of Faecalibacterium prausnitzii, the relationship between periodontitis, microbial production of butyrate in the oral cavity and ageing, and the pathogenic mechanisms of Campylobacter. Finally, an insight was given on a recent expert meeting, which re-examined the probiotic definition, advised on the appropriate use and scope of the term and outlined different probiotic categories and the prevalence of different mechanisms of activity.},

   abstract = {The pathogenesis of inflammatory bowel disease (IBD), including Crohn's disease, is a subject of increasing interest. Loss-of-function mutations in nucleotide-binding oligomerization domain-containing protein 2 (NOD2) are strong genetic factors linked to Crohn's disease, which eventually leads to an excessive mucosal inflammatory response directed against components of normal gut microbiota. Reactive oxygen species (ROS) play an important role in inflammation processes, as well as in transduction of signals from receptors for several cytokines, such as tumor necrosis factor alpha (TNFalpha). ROS activate nuclear factor-kappaB (NF-kappaB) via IkappaB kinase (IKK) through the PI3K/AKT/PTEN pathway. Therefore, this pathway is recognized to play a key role in Crohn's disease. Loss of function has been demonstrated to occur as an early event in a wide variety of diseases. Given this prevalent involvement in a number of diseases, the molecular development that modulates this pathway has been the subject of several studies. In addition, it has been the focus of extensive research and drug discovery activities. A better understanding of the molecular assemblies may reveal novel targets for the therapeutic development against Crohn's disease.},

   abstract = {The human body is colonized by a large number of microbes that are collectively referred to as the microbiota. They interact with the hosting organism and some do contribute to the physiological maintenance of the general good health thru regulation of some metabolic processes while some others are essential for the synthesis of vitamins and short-chain fatty acids. The abnormal variation, in the quality and/or quantity of individual bacterial species residing in the gastro-intestinal tract, is called dysmicrobism. The immune system of the host will respond to these changes at the intestinal mucosa level which could lead to Inflammatory Bowel Diseases (IBD). This inflammatory immune response could subsequently extend to other organs and systems outside the digestive tract such as the thyroid, culminating in thyroiditis. The goal of the present study is to review and analyze data reported in the literature about thyroiditis associated with inflammatory bowel diseases such as Ulcerative Colitis (UC) and Crohns Disease (CD). It was reported that similarities of some molecular bacterial components with molecular components of the host are considered among the factors causing IBD through an autoimmune reaction which could involve other non-immune cell types. The axis dysmicrobism-IBD-autoimmune reaction will be investigated as a possible etiopathogenic mechanism to Autoimmune Thyroiditis. If such is the case, then the employment of specific probiotic strains may represent a useful approach to moderate the immune system.},

All relevant studies published in Medline and Embase up to June 2015 have been reviewed. The results of bowel histology and serum parameters have been recorded. A satisfactory number of published experimental studies, and a quite large one of both herbal and plant products tested in different studies have been reported. The results showed that in the majority of the studies, herbal therapy reduced the inflammatory activity of experimental colitis and diminished the levels of many inflammatory indices, including serum cytokines and indices of oxidative stress. The most promising plant and herbal products were tormentil extracts, wormwoodherb, Aloe vera, germinated barley foodstuff, curcumin, Boswellia serrata, Panax notoginseng, Ixeris dentata, green tea, Cordia dichotoma, Plantago lanceolata, Iridoidglycosides, and mastic gum. Herbal therapies exert their therapeutic benefit via various mechanisms, including immune regulation, anti-oxidant activity, inhibition of leukotriene B4 and nuclear factor-kappaB, and antiplatelet activity. Large, double-blind clinical studies assessing these natural substances should be urgently conducted.},

   abstract = {The use of herbal therapy in inflammatory bowel disease (IBD) is increasing worldwide. The aim of this study was to review the literature on the efficacy of herbal therapy in IBD patients. Studies on herbal therapy for IBD published in Medline and Embase were reviewed, and response to treatment and remission rates were recorded. Although the number of the relevant clinical studies is relatively small, it can be assumed that the efficacy of herbal therapies in IBD is promising. The most important clinical trials conducted so far refer to the use of mastic gum, tormentil extracts, wormwood herb, aloe vera, triticum aestivum, germinated barley foodstuff, and boswellia serrata. In ulcerative colitis, aloe vera gel, triticum aestivum, andrographis paniculata extract and topical Xilei-san were superior to placebo in inducing remission or clinical response, and curcumin was superior to placebo in maintaining remission; boswellia serrata gum resin and plantago ovata seeds were as effective as mesalazine, whereas oenothera biennis had similar relapse rates as omega-3 fatty acids in the treatment of ulcerative colitis. In Crohn's disease, mastic gum, Artemisia absinthium, and Tripterygium wilfordii were superior to placebo in inducing remission and preventing clinical postoperative recurrence, respectively. Herbal therapies exert their therapeutic benefit by different mechanisms including immune regulation, antioxidant activity, inhibition of leukotriene B4 and nuclear factor-kappa B, and antiplatelet activity. Large, double-blind clinical studies assessing the most commonly used natural substances should urgently be conducted.},

Mucosal inflammation, due to altered microbiota, increased intestinal permeability and immune system dysfunction underlies the symptoms and may be caused in susceptible individuals by different factors (or a combination of them), including dietary habits and components. In this review we describe the influence of the Western diet, obesity, and different nutraceuticals/functional foods (bioactive peptides, phytochemicals, omega 3-polyunsaturated fatty acids, vitamin D, probiotics and prebiotics) on the course of IBD, and provide some hints that could be useful for nutritional guidance. Hopefully, research will soon offer enough reliable data to slow down the spread of the disease and to make diet a cornerstone in IBD therapy.},

   abstract = {AIM: The aim of this study is to determine the prevalence and evolution of anaemia in prospectively followed children and adolescents diagnosed with Crohn's disease (CD). METHODS: The BELCRO registry (inclusion May 2008-April 2010), describing current clinical treatment practice of children diagnosed with CD, provided data on age, height, body mass index (BMI), paediatric Crohn's disease activity index (PCDAI), therapy and haemoglobin (Hb) at diagnosis 12 and 24 months follow-up. Anaemia was defined as Hb < -2 sd, while severe anaemia was defined as Hb < -4 sd. Patients were classified as child </=13 and adolescent >13 years of age. RESULT: Ninety-six were included, 13 dropped out due to insufficient Hb data (37 females/46 males; median age 13.3 years, range 2.2-17.8 years). At diagnosis, the median Hb sd was -2.66 (-8.4; 1.07) and was correlated with the PCDAI (p = 0.013). At diagnosis, 51/83 (61%) were anaemic and all had active disease. Hb z-score significantly improved (p < 0.0001) but 26/68 (38%) remained anaemic at 12 months and 29/76 (38%) at 24 months of follow-up. The correlation to the PCDAI disappeared. At 24 months, children were more likely to be anaemic. There was no difference in iron dose nor duration of iron supplements between children and adolescents. Iron treatment was more readily given to patients presenting with anaemia. Hb did not differ between patients with (n = 28) or without iron supplements. Half of the patients with persisting anaemia were given iron supplements, of which, only three were given intravenously. CONCLUSION: Anaemia remains an important extra-intestinal manifestation of CD in children. Physicians, lacking optimal treatment strategies, undertreat their patients.},

   abstract = {Inflammatory bowel diseases (IBD) such as ulcerative colitis (UC) and Crohn's disease (CD) are multifactorial, relapsing disorders of the gastrointestinal tract. However, the etiology is still poorly understood but involves altered immune responses, epithelial dysfunction, environmental factors, and nutrition. Recently, we have shown that the diet supplement corabion has cardioprotective effects due to reduction of oxidative stress and inflammation. Since oxidative stress and inflammation are also prominent risk factors in IBD, we speculated that corabion also has beneficial effects on experimental colitis. Colitis was induced in male mice by administration of 3.5% (w/v) dextran sulfate sodium (DSS) in drinking water for a period of 3 or 7 days with or without daily gavage feeding of corabion consisting of vitamin C, vitamin E, L-arginine, and eicosapentaenoic and docosahexaenoic acid. We found that corabion administration attenuated DSS-induced colon shortening, tissue damage, and disease activity index during the onset of colitis. Mechanistically, these effects could be explained by reduced neutrophil recruitment, oxidative stress, production of proinflammatory cytokines, and internalization of the junctional proteins ZO-1 and E-cadherin leading to less edema formation. Thus, corabion may be a useful diet supplement for the management of chronic inflammatory intestinal disorders such as IBD.},

   abstract = {OBJECTIVE: The primary objective was to compare the gastrointestinal (GI) symptoms and worry of pediatric patients with functional GI disorders (FGIDs) and organic GI diseases to healthy controls utilizing the Pediatric Quality of Life Inventory (PedsQL) Gastrointestinal Symptoms and Worry Scales for patient self-reports ages 5-18 years and parent proxy-reports for ages 2-18 years. The secondary objective was to compare FGIDs and organic GI diseases to each other. METHODS: The PedsQL Gastrointestinal Symptoms and Worry Scales were completed in a 9-site study by 587 pediatric patients with GI disorders and 685 parents of patients. Patients had physician-diagnosed GI disorders (chronic constipation, functional abdominal pain, irritable bowel syndrome, functional dyspepsia, Crohn's disease, ulcerative colitis, and gastroesophageal reflux disease). Ten Gastrointestinal Symptoms Scales measuring Stomach Pain, Stomach Discomfort When Eating, Food and Drink Limits, Trouble Swallowing, Heartburn and Reflux, Nausea and Vomiting, Gas and Bloating, Constipation, Blood, and Diarrhea were administered along with two Gastrointestinal Worry Scales. Five hundred and thirteen healthy children and 337 parents of healthy children completed the PedsQL Gastrointestinal Scales in an Internet panel survey. RESULTS: The PedsQL Gastrointestinal Symptoms and Worry Scales distinguished between pediatric patients with FGIDs and organic GI diseases in comparison with healthy controls, supporting known-groups validity. Patients with FGIDs reported more GI symptoms and worry than patients with organic GI diseases. CONCLUSIONS: The PedsQL Gastrointestinal Symptoms and Worry Scales may be utilized as common metrics across pediatric patient groups with FGIDs and organic GI diseases and healthy samples to measure GI-specific symptoms in clinical research and practice.},

   abstract = {BACKGROUND: Patient-reported outcomes are essential in determining the broad impact of inflammatory bowel disease (IBD) and treatments from the patient's perspective. The primary study objectives were to compare the gastrointestinal symptoms and worry of pediatric patients with IBD with matched healthy controls and to compare Crohn's disease and ulcerative colitis with each other using the Pediatric Quality of Life Inventory (PedsQL) Gastrointestinal Symptoms and Gastrointestinal Worry Scales. METHODS: PedsQL Gastrointestinal Symptoms and Worry Scales were completed in a 9-site study by 256 pediatric patients with IBD and 259 parents of patients (263 families; Crohn's disease [n = 195], ulcerative colitis [n = 68]). Ten Gastrointestinal Symptoms Scales measuring stomach pain, stomach discomfort when eating, food and drink limits, trouble swallowing, heartburn and reflux, nausea and vomiting, gas and bloating, constipation, blood in poop, and diarrhea were administered along with 2 Gastrointestinal Worry Scales. A matched group of 384 healthy children families completed the PedsQL in an Internet survey. RESULTS: PedsQL Gastrointestinal Symptoms and Worry Scales distinguished between pediatric patients with IBD in comparison with healthy controls (P < 0.001), with larger effect sizes for symptoms indicative of IBD, supporting known-groups validity and clinical interpretability including minimal important difference scores. Patients with Crohn's disease or ulcerative colitis did not demonstrate significantly different gastrointestinal symptoms or worry in comparison with each other. CONCLUSIONS: The PedsQL Gastrointestinal Symptoms and Worry Scales may be used as common metrics across pediatric patients with IBD, including Crohn's disease and ulcerative colitis separately to measure gastrointestinal-specific symptoms in clinical research and practice.},

   abstract = {PURPOSE OF REVIEW: Diet is one of the main drivers of the composition and function of the gut microbiota. The scope of this review is to summarize recent studies assessing the role of gut microbiota in clinical pediatric conditions and to review studies using nutritional approaches to favorably modify the gut microbiota to improve health outcomes in children. RECENT FINDINGS: New studies underscore that breastfeeding and infant diet impact the gut microbiome and metagenome. A comprehensive study using metagenomic shotgun sequencing, suggests that the cessation of breastfeeding rather than the introduction of solid foods, drives the functional maturation of the infant gut microbiome toward an adult-like state. There is further support for the view that a disturbed early gut microbiota is implicated in allergic and autoimmune diseases. New studies using prebiotics, probiotics, and synbiotics in various pediatric disorders have yielded promising results, yet the evidence for specific guidelines on their use is still low. SUMMARY: Intestinal dysbiosis is associated with several pediatric disorders but a cause-effect relationship remains to be clearly demonstrated in most conditions. Future studies using new systems biology approaches are anticipated to provide further insight into the functional capacities of the gut microbiome and its establishment in childhood. This may then lay the ground for improved treatment and prevention strategies targeting the gut microbiota.},

   abstract = {Since World War II, several factors such as an impressive industrial growth, an enhanced environmental bioavailability and intensified food consumption have contributed to a significant amplification of human exposure to aluminum. Aluminum is particularly present in food, beverages, some drugs and airbone dust. In our food, aluminum is superimposed via additives and cooking utensils. Therefore, the tolerable intake of aluminum is exceeded for a significant part of the world population, especially in children who are more vulnerable to toxic effects of pollutants than adults. Faced with this oral aluminum influx, intestinal tract is an essential barrier, especially as 38% of ingested aluminum accumulates at the intestinal mucosa. Although still poorly documented to date, the impact of oral exposure to aluminum in conditions relevant to real human exposure appears to be deleterious for gut homeostasis. Aluminum ingestion affects the regulation of the permeability, the microflora and the immune function of intestine. Nowadays, several arguments are consistent with an involvement of aluminum as an environmental risk factor for inflammatory bowel diseases.},

   abstract = {Mycobacterium avium ssp. paratuberculosis is the etiologic agent of Johne's disease in ruminants and is hypothesized to be an infectious cause of Crohn's disease, as well as some other human diseases. Due to key knowledge gaps, the potential public health impact of M. paratuberculosis is unknown. This scoping review aims to identify and characterised the evidence on potential sources and vehicles of M. paratuberculosis exposure for humans to better understand how exposure is likely to occur. Evidence from 255 primary research papers is summarized; most examined the prevalence or concentration of M. paratuberculosis in animals (farmed domestic, pets and wildlife) (n=148), food for human consumption (62) (milk, dairy, meat, infant formula) or water (drinking and recreational) and the environment (farm, pasture and areas affected by runoff water) (20). The majority of this research has been published since 2000 (Figure- abstract). Nine case-control studies examining risk factors for Crohn's disease highlighted significant associations with the consumption of processed meats and cheese, while direct contact with ruminants, high risk occupations (farmer, veterinarian), milk consumption and water source were factors not associated with the disease and/or M. paratuberculosis exposure status. Molecular epidemiology studies demonstrated strain-sharing between species. Produce and seafood were the only previously suggested sources of human exposure for which there was no supporting evidence identified in this scoping review. The results of this review indicate that ruminant populations from around the globe are infected with M. paratuberculosis and many non-ruminant species have also been found to carry or be infected with M. paratuberculosis. Several potential sources for human exposure to M. paratuberculosis were identified; however there remain important gaps in quantitative information on the prevalence and concentration of M. paratuberculosis in contaminated sources of exposure. This information is critical to understanding the risk of exposure, opportunities for risk mitigation interventions and modelling exposures to distill the importance of various sources of human exposure to M. paratuberculosis including direct contact with animals and the environment as well as consumption of contaminated foods and water. Results of this study may be used to prioritize future research and to support evidence-informed decision-making on the M. paratuberculosis issue.},

   abstract = {This systematic review-meta-analysis appraises and summarizes all the available research (128 papers) on the zoonotic potential of Mycobacterium avium ssp. paratuberculosis. The latter has been debated for a century due to pathogenic and clinical similarities between Johne's disease in ruminants and Crohn's disease (108 studies) in humans and recently for involvement in other human diseases; human immunodeficiency virus (HIV) infection (2), sarcoidosis (3), diabetes mellitus type 1 (T1DM) (7) and type 2 (3), multiple sclerosis (5) and Hashimoto's thyroiditis (2). Meta-analytical results indicated a significant positive association, consistently across different laboratory methods for Crohn's disease [odds ratio (OR) range 4.26-8.44], T1DM (OR range 2.91-9.95) and multiple sclerosis (OR range 6.5-7.99). The latter two and the thyroiditis hypothesis require further investigation to confirm the association. Meta-regression of Crohn's disease studies using DNA detection methods indicated that choice of primers and sampling frame (e.g. general population vs. hospital-based sample) explained a significant proportion of heterogeneity. Other epidemiological studies demonstrated a lack of association between high-risk occupations and development of Crohn's disease. Due to knowledge gaps in understanding the role of M. paratuberculosis in the development or progression of human disease, the evidence at present is not strong enough to inform the potential public health impact of M. paratuberculosis exposure.},

   abstract = {Global research knowledge has accumulated over the past few decades, and there is reasonable evidence for a positive association between Mycobacterium avium spp. paratuberculosis and Crohn's disease in humans, although its role as a human pathogen has not been entirely accepted. For this reason, management of public health risk due to M. paratuberculosis remains an important policy issue in agri-food public health arenas in many countries. Responsible authorities must decide whether existing mitigation strategies are sufficient to prevent or reduce human exposure to M. paratuberculosis. A Web-based questionnaire was administered to topic specialists to elicit empirical knowledge and opinion on the overall public health impact of M. paratuberculosis, the importance of various routes of human exposure to the pathogen, existing mitigation strategies and the need for future strategies. The questionnaire had four sections and consisted of 20 closed and five open questions. Topic specialists believed that M. paratuberculosis is likely a risk to human health (44.8%) and, given the paucity of available evidence, most frequently ranked it as a moderate public health issue (40.1%). A significant correlation was detected between topic specialists' commitment to M. paratuberculosis in terms of the number of years or proportion of work dedicated to this topic, and the likelihood of an extreme answer (high or low) to the above questions. Topic specialists identified contact with ruminants and dairy products as the most likely routes of exposure for humans. There was consensus on exposure routes for ruminants and what commodities to target in mitigation efforts. Described mandatory programmes mainly focused on culling diseased animals and voluntary on-farm prevention programmes. Despite ongoing difficulties in the identification of subclinical infections in animals, the topic specialists largely agreed that further enhancement of on-farm programmes in affected commodities by the agri-food industry (68.4%) and allocation of resources by governments to monitor the issue (92%) are most appropriate given the current state of evidence.},

   abstract = {BACKGROUND: Enteral nutrition [EN] was reported to be as effective as steroids in achieving short-term remission in patients with Crohn's disease [CD], and exclusive EN [EEN] is widely used as primary therapy in children with CD. The aim of this study was to investigate the effect of a specific multi-fibre mix [MF], designed to match the fibre content of a healthy diet, on intestinal epithelial barrier function in IL-10 knockout [IL-10(-/-)] mice with spontaneous chronic colitis. METHODS: IL-10(-/-) mice aged 16 weeks, with established colitis, were used for the experiments with multi-fibre mix diet [MF] for 4 weeks. Severity of colitis, levels of short cahin fatty acids [SCFA] in caecum contents, expression of STAT 3 and STAT 4 proteins, CD4(+) CD45(+) lymphocytes, CD4(+)Foxp3(+) regulatory T cells [Tregs] and cytokines in the lamina propria [LP], epithelial expression of tight junction proteins, TNF-alpha/TNFR2 mRNA expression, and epithelial apoptosis in the proximal colon were measured at the end of the experiment. RESULTS: MF feeding effectively attenuated disease activity index and colitis associated with decreased lamina propria CD4(+) CD45(+) lymphocytes, IFN-gamma/IL-17A mRNA expression, and p-STAT 3 and p-STAT 4 expression in colonic mucosa of IL-10(-/-) mice [p < 0.05]. Furthermore, CD4(+)Foxp3(+) Tregs in the LP and concentrations of total SCFA, acetate, propionate, and butyrate in the caecum were markedly increased after MF feeding in IL-10(-/-) mice. After MF feeding, increased epithelial expression and correct localisation of tight junction proteins [occludin and zona occludens protein 1], as well as reduced TNF-alpha/TNFR2 mRNA expression and epithelial apoptosis, were also observed in IL-10(-/-) mice. CONCLUSIONS: These results indicated that EEN supplemented with the tested fibre mix, known to modulate the intestinal microbiota composition and SCFA production, could possibly improve efficacy in inducing remission in patients with active CD.},

   abstract = {Inflammatory bowel disease (IBD) is a group of diseases characterized by inflammation of the small and large intestine and primarily includes ulcerative colitis and Crohn's disease. Although the etiology of IBD is not fully understood, it is believed to result from the interaction of genetic, immunological, and environmental factors, including gut microbiota. Recent studies have shown a correlation between changes in the composition of the intestinal microbiota and IBD. Moreover, it has been suggested that probiotics and prebiotics influence the balance of beneficial and detrimental bacterial species, and thereby determine homeostasis versus inflammatory conditions. In this review, we focus on recent advances in the understanding of the role of prebiotics, probiotics, and synbiotics in functions of the gastrointestinal tract and the induction and maintenance of IBD remission. We also discuss the role of psychobiotics, which constitute a novel class of psychotropic agents that affect the central nervous system by influencing gut microbiota.},

   abstract = {BACKGROUND: As a sulfated polysaccharide, carrageenan has been widely used as common food additive. METHODS: In the present study, we investigated the effects of kappa-carrageenan on TNBS-induced gut inflammation in mice. BALB/c mice were pretreated with kappa-carrageenan for 14days prior to the administration of TNBS. RESULTS: Our results showed that kappa-carrageenan pretreatment aggravated the loss of body weight and further increased the mortality rate. Histological and morphological analyses revealed that the TNBS-induced colonic inflammation was deteriorated by the kappa-carrageenan administration. The ratio of CD4(+)CD25(+)CD127dim/CD4(+) of the kappa-carrageenan+TNBS groups was significantly lower than that of the TNBS group. The expression of IL-2, TNF-alpha and IL-6 was significantly increased, whereas the expression of IL-10 was significantly decreased in the kappa-carrageenan+TNBS groups. In addition, kappa-carrageenan, together with TNBS, decreased the enzyme activity of SOD and GSH-px and up-regulated the expression of TLR4, NF-kappaB, p-ERK, p-JNK, p-Jun., IL-8 and MDA in the colonic mucosa. CONCLUSIONS: kappa-Carrageenan aggravated the TNBS-induced intestinal inflammation, and such an effect could be associated with the oxidative stress and activation of TLR4-NF-kappaB and MAPK/ERK1/2 pathway.},

   abstract = {PURPOSE OF REVIEW: Malnutrition, protein-energy, and micronutrient deficiencies are common among patients with inflammatory bowel disease (IBD). The deficiencies are a manifestation of the complicated disease and a cause of morbidity. The present review summarizes recent advances and evidence-based knowledge regarding micronutrients in relation to patients with IBD. RECENT FINDINGS: Micronutrient deficiencies occur in more than half of patients with IBD. Most common are deficiencies of iron, B12, vitamin D, vitamin K, folic acid, selenium, zinc, vitamin B6, and vitamin B1. Deficiencies are more common in Crohn's disease than in ulcerative colitis, and more in active disease than at times of remission. Micronutrient deficiency is associated with prolonged and complicated course of disease. Iron deficiency is the most common cause for anemia. Definite diagnosis of B12 deficiency cannot be established by serum levels alone. Vitamin D and vitamin K deficiencies are thought to be associated with heightened inflammatory state. The relationship of these deficiencies with bone disease is controversial. The present review focuses on the significance, epidemiology, treatment options, and recommendations regarding micronutrient deficiencies in IBD. SUMMARY: Micronutrient deficiencies are common and have clinical significance. High suspicion for micronutrient deficiencies is advocated so that treatable causes of morbidity are treated appropriately and late and irreversible sequlae are prevented.},

   abstract = {CLINICAL BACKGROUND: A 71-year-old male with 50-year history of Crohn's disease was evaluated for acute onset of dizziness and slurred speech. Blood ethanol levels were elevated despite abstinence from alcohol for over 30 years. CT enterography demonstrated massive dilation of the small bowel with anastomotic stricture. DISCUSSION: Auto-brewery syndrome may be considered in a patient with chronic obstruction or hypomotility presenting with elevated serum ethanol levels in the setting of high carbohydrate intake. Although treatment algorithms lack validation, judicious use of antibiotic therapy, carbohydrate control, and short courses of antifungal therapy have all been reported in the literature. Importantly, clinical consideration of 'auto-brewery' should be undertaken with substantial caution, given the lack of validated mechanisms linking endogenous ethanol production to peripheral blood ethanol.},

   abstract = {Intestinal dysbiosis is thought to be an important cause of disease progression and the gastrointestinal symptoms experienced in patients with inflammatory bowel disease (IBD). Inflammation appears to be a major contributor in perpetuating a dysregulated gut microbiota. Although current drug therapies can significantly induce and maintain disease remission, there is no cure for these diseases. Nevertheless, ongoing human studies investigating dietary fibre interventions may potentially prove to exert beneficial outcomes for IBD. Postulated mechanisms include direct interactions with the gut mucosa through immunomodulation, or indirectly through the microbiome. Component species of the microbiome may degrade dietary-fibre polysaccharides and ferment the products to form short-chain fatty acids such as butyrate. Prebiotic dietary fibres may also act more directly by altering the composition of the microbiome. Longer term benefits in reducing the risk of more aggressive disease or colorectal cancer may require other dietary fibre sources such as wheat bran or psyllium. By critically examining clinical trials that have used dietary fibre supplements or dietary patterns containing specific types or amounts of dietary fibres, it may be possible to assess whether varying the intake of specific dietary fibres may offer an efficient treatment for IBD patients.},

   abstract = {Clostridium difficile (C. difficile) is a major pathogen for diarrhea in hospitalized patients and because of outbreak of highly virulent strain in EU and US, increased length of hospital stay and increased numbers of severe patients and deaths have become major challenges. In recent years, transmissions through community-acquired or food-borne infections are reported. National surveillance has been already performed overseas. Guidelines for preventing C. difficile infection (CDI) is available, and education activities are promoted for preventing the infection spread. Meanwhile, in Japan, medical hospitals are reporting individual CDI incidence, however, a large-scale research has not been conducted up to the present date and therefore the entire status of CDI including infection of the highly virulent strain has yet to be revealed. This time, we performed a questionnaire-based survey at 2,537 hospitals nationwide between April 15, 2013 and May 31, 2013 to investigate CDI incidence, diagnosis and treatment. Valid responses were obtained from 321 hospitals. Regarding the annual number of CDI patients at all the hospitals, the highest group of hospitals responding "1 to 5 patients a year" was 17.8%, and the second highest group of hospitals responding "no patients a year" was 13.1%. In contrast, there was a group of hospitals with "more than 101 patients a year", which was 3.1%. This indicates that there was the difference in the CDI incidences among hospitals. According to the questionnaire results, a highest group of hospitals responding "0-20%" for CDI patients with serious complication such as toxic megacolon, gastrointestinal perforation, ileus paralytic, bacteremia, sepsis, crohn's disease, and ulcerative colitis was 62.6%, and for CDI patients with recurrence more than one, a group of hospitals answering "0 to 20%" was 56.4%, which was the highest. This suggested that there was only a small number of serious CDI patients and recurrence CDI patients in Japan. For rapid toxin detection kit used in CDI diagnosis, a group of hospitals using "C. DIFF QUIK CHEK COMPLETE" was over 40%, which showed that the kit was a major product used in Japan. And a group of institutions responding that they will start antibacterial medication such as vancomycin (VCM) and metronidazole (MNZ) as soon as after rapid diagnostic test, etc. showing positive results was over 70%. As for CDI treatment, a highest group of hospitals answering that VCM is administered orally at a dose of "0.5 g four times daily" was 42.1%, and a group of hospitals responding "10 to 14 days" for administration period was 44.2%, which was the highest. A highest group of hospitals answering that MNZ is administered orally at a dose of "250 mg four times daily" was 38.3%, and a group of hospitals responding "10 to 14 days" for administration period was 46.4%, which was the highest. Apart from VCM and MNZ, probiotics are also used for CDI treatment, "butyric acid bacterium" accounted for 40.8% in the probiotics group, which was the highest, followed by "bifidobacteria" 37.7% and "resistant lactic acid bacterium" 25.6%. To prevent the spread of CDI, 47.7% of the hospitals responded that the patients are "isolated", while 25.6% answered the patients are "sometimes isolated", which means that more than 70% of patients are "isolated or sometimes isolated". As to what type of antiseptic drug is used for sterilizing hospital, 68.2% of the hospitals answered that they are using "sodium hypochlorite 1,000 ppm". The survey more than 300 hospitals have revealed not only the CDI incidences, timing of toxin test, and part of the actual therapeutic strategy at medical institutions in Japan but also the difference in the CDI incidences and therapeutic strategy among hospitals. In the future, epidemiological data on epidemic strain will be accumulated more in Japan as are done overseas, and guidelines for CDI diagnosis and treatment will need to be formulated.},

   abstract = {Inflammatory bowel disease (IBD), most commonly ulcerative colitis (UC) and Crohn's disease (CD), is a chronic inflammation of the gastrointestinal tract. Patients affected with IBD experience symptoms including abdominal pain, persistent diarrhea, rectal bleeding, and weight loss. There is no cure for IBD; thus treatments typically focus on preventing complications, inducing and maintaining remission, and improving quality of life. During IBD, dysregulation of the intestinal immune system leads to increased production of pro-inflammatory cytokines, such as TNF-alpha and IL-6, and recruitment of activated immune cells to the intestine, causing tissue damage and perpetuating the inflammatory response. Recent biological therapies targeting specific inflammatory cytokines or pathways, in particular TNF-alpha, have shown promise, but not all patients respond to treatment, and some individuals become intolerant to treatment over time. Dietary peptides and amino acids (AAs) have been shown to modulate intestinal immune functions and influence inflammatory responses, and may be useful as alternative or ancillary treatments in IBD. This review focuses on dietary interventions for IBD treatment, in particular the role of dietary peptides and AAs in reducing inflammation, oxidative stress, and apoptosis in the gut, as well as recent advances in the cellular mechanisms responsible for their anti-inflammatory activity.},

   abstract = {There is a clinical need for new, more effective treatments for chronic and debilitating inflammatory bowel disease (IBD), including Crohn's disease and ulcerative colitis. Targeting drugs selectively to the inflamed intestine may improve therapeutic outcomes and minimize systemic toxicity. We report the development of an inflammation-targeting hydrogel (IT-hydrogel) that acts as a drug delivery system to the inflamed colon. Hydrogel microfibers were generated from ascorbyl palmitate, an amphiphile that is generally recognized as safe (GRAS) by the U.S. Food and Drug Administration. IT-hydrogel microfibers loaded with the anti-inflammatory corticosteroid dexamethasone (Dex) were stable, released drug only upon enzymatic digestion, and demonstrated preferential adhesion to inflamed epithelial surfaces in vitro and in two mouse colitis models in vivo. Dex-loaded IT-hydrogel enemas, but not free Dex enemas, administered every other day to mice with colitis resulted in a significant reduction in inflammation and were associated with lower Dex peak serum concentrations and, thus, less systemic drug exposure. Ex vivo analysis of colon tissue samples from patients with ulcerative colitis demonstrated that IT-hydrogel microfibers adhered preferentially to mucosa from inflamed lesions compared with histologically normal sites. The IT-hydrogel drug delivery platform represents a promising approach for targeted enema-based therapies in patients with colonic IBD.},

We investigated the expression of GPR43/FFAR2 in the colon from Crohn's disease patients and whether dietary fiber in enteral nutrition increases GPR43+ polymorphonuclear infiltration in mucosa. Segments of ascending colon and white blood cells from peripheral blood were obtained from 46 Crohn's disease patients and 10 colon cancer patients. The Crohn's disease patients were grouped by the activity of disease (active or remission) and enteral nutrition with or without dietary fiber. Histological feature, expression and location of GPR43/FFAR2 and level of tumor necrosis factor-alpha (TNF-alpha), interleukine-6 (IL-6) and myeloperoxidase were assessed. The results of hematoxylin-eosin and immunohistochemistry staining revealed that the infiltration of immune cells, including GPR43+ PMN, was more severe in active Crohn's disease patients who consumed normal food or enteral nutrition with dietary fiber than in remission patients and colon cancer patients. This finding was supported by the results of GPR43 and myeloperoxidase expression. Active Crohn's disease (CD) patients who consumed enteral nutrition without dietary fiber exhibited severe immune cell infiltration similar to the other active CD patients, but GPR43+ PMNs were rarely observed. The level of TNF-alpha mRNA in active Crohn's disease patients was higher than those of the other patients. In conclusion, the use of dietary fiber in enteral nutrition by active Crohn's disease patients might increase GPR43+ PMNs infiltration in colon mucosa. This effect was not observed in Crohn's disease patients in remission.},

   abstract = {Skeletal muscle wasting occurs in a variety of diseases including diabetes, cancer, Crohn's disease, chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD), disuse, and denervation. Tumor necrosis factor alpha (TNF-alpha) is involved in mediating the wasting effect. To date, a causal relationship between TNF-alpha signaling and muscle wasting has been established in animal models. However, results from clinical trials are conflicting. This is partly due to the fact that other factors such as TNF-like weak inducer of apoptosis (TWEAK) and interleukin 6 (IL-6) are also involved in skeletal muscle wasting. Because muscle wasting is often associated with physical inactivity and reduced food intake, therapeutic interventions will be most effective when multiple approaches are used in conjunction with nutritional support and exercise.},

   abstract = {OBJECTIVE: To explore the efficacy and safety of the application of enteral nutrition (EN) in gastrointestinal disease in children, and to explore the possibility of the implementation of family EN. METHOD: Retrospective analysis of disease spectrum, EN approach, preparation, speed and time as well as adverse reactions and outcomes in 47 pediatric patients with gastrointestinal disease underwent EN therapy during July 2014 to March 2015. The nutrition indicators before and after EN therapy were compared by paired t-test. RESULT: A total of 47 patients were selected, 27 male (57%) and 20 female (43%), aged 0.8 (0.3, 4.0) years, 9 with mechanical or chemical damage to the esophagus, 7 with inflammatory bowel disease (including ulcerative colitis and Crohn's disease), 6 with chronic diarrhea, 5 with acute pancreatitis, 3 with acute diarrhea and severe malnutrition, 3 with short bowel syndrome, 3 with improper feeding, 3 with feeding difficulties, 3 with protein losing enteropathy, 2 with post-enterostomy, 2 with enterocolitis, 1 with gastroesophageal reflux, were diagnosed. Of 47 cases, 22 were given oral nutrition, 28 were fed with nasogastric tube and 4 with nasojejunal tube feeding, 2 with percutaneous endoscopic gastrojejunostomy tube feeding for each. In these tube-feeding cases, 20 cases were treated with continuous infusion and 21 cases with intermittent infusion. Eleven cases were fed with amino acid formula; 21 cases took the choice of peptide formulations; 16 cases chose whole protein formula, including six cases who chose 3.3-4.2 kJ/ml higher energy density formula, 10 cases selected common energy density formula including breast milk. Twenty-one cases suffered from different degrees of adverse reactions, including vomiting in 7 cases, abdominal pain and bloating in 3, diarrhea in 12, secondary respiratory infections in 5. Five patients were discharged after giving up of treatment by parents due to poor efficacy on primary disease; 3 cases were transferred to other departments for further treatment; 15 cases were discharged with a feeding tube for family nutrition and specialist out-patient treatment. The rest 24 cases were all improved and discharged. There were significant differences in nutrition indicators before and after EN, weight-for-age Z score (WAZ)(-2.3+/-1.9 vs. -1.9+/-1.8, t=4.156, P=0.000), weight-for-height Z score (WHZ)(-1.9+/-1.7 vs. -1.2+/-1.5, t=3.714, P=0.001), albumin ((35+/-9)g/L vs.(39+/-6) g/L, t=3.017, P=0.005) and prealbumin ((0.11+/-0.05)g/L vs.(0.18+/-0.07)g/L, t=5.144, P=0.000). CONCLUSION: EN is suitable for a variety of children's digestive diseases, which can improve the nutritional status of the patients and was safe for clinical application. As the implementation of EN is simple and has good compliance, family EN is proven to be feasible.},

   abstract = {Inflammatory bowel diseases (IBD) are chronic, relapsing, inflammatory disorders of the gastrointestinal tract, and continuing colonic inflammation is considered an important risk factor in the development of colorectal cancer. Our previous studies showed that beetroot (Beta vulgaris var. rubra) products and their major component betanin modulate the reactive oxygen species (ROS) production and DNA damage in 12-O-tetradecanoylphorbol 13-acetate (TPA) stimulated human polymorphonuclear neutrophils of healthy volunteers. The aim of the present study was to evaluate the effects of betanin on the oxidative DNA damage and apoptosis in neutrophils isolated from blood of patients with inflammatory bowel disease--ulcerative colitis (UC) and Crohn's disease (CD). The results were compared with those obtained in colon carcinoma-derived Caco-2 cells. Betanin treatment at the concentration of 100 muM for 24 h increased DNA damage assessed by comet assay in IBD patients' neutrophils. A similar effect although less pronounced was observed in Caco-2 cells. Treatment of Caco-2 cells with H2O2 caused a 4-fold increase of DNA strand breaks in comparison to untreated cells, but pre-treatment with betanin reduced DNA damage in these cells. Betanin also induced procaspase-3 cleavage and caspase-3 activity accompanied by the loss of mitochondrial transmembrane potential, indicating its pro-apoptotic activity. These results suggest that betanin may support mechanisms that lead to the release of ROS and apoptotic cell death. In this way betanin may exert anti-inflammatory and potentially cancer preventive activity.},

   abstract = {Endocytosis is a fundamental cell biological process, which carries out essential functions in a polarized epithelial cell such as enterocytes provided with a huge surface area of the brush border membrane. Major tasks of enterocytes, which are regulated by endocytic signals, are digestion and absorption of nutrients and drugs/pharmacological agents, barrier permeability to microorganism, toxins and antigens, and transcytotic crosstalk between intestinal lumen and lamina propria cells with access to the circulation.Investigations on inflammatory bowel diseases such as food allergy, celiac disease, Crohn's disease, and ulcerative colitis focus on immune processes originating within enterocytes as antigen presenting cells. Thus the initiation of oral tolerance, that is, the binding of food antigens to MHC class II proteins, might be localized within late endosomes of enterocytes. Furthermore, the late endosomal compartment of enterocytes seems to be involved in the processing of luminal antigens during the pathogenesis of celiac disease and inflammatory bowel diseases. Investigations of inherited diseases such as microvillus inclusion disease have revealed a pathogenetic defect in the autophagocytotic and/or recycling pathway of enterocytes.Our progress in the cell and molecular biological understanding of the endocytosis and the methodical opportunities of translational research offer now new therapeutic options for patients suffering from endocytosis-related diseases of enterocytes.},

   abstract = {Glyoxylate reductase/hydroxypyruvate reductase (GRHPR), which exists mainly in the liver, is a D-2-hydroxy-acid dehydrogenase that plays a critical role in the formation of primary hyperoxaluria type 2 (PH2). Here, we investigated GRHPR expression and its potential role in both human Crohn's disease (CD) and experimental colitis. Murine experimental colitis models were established by administration of trinitrobenzenesulphonic acid (TNBS). As shown by Western blot, significant up-regulation of GRHPR was found in TNBS-treated mice as compared with normal controls. Immunohistochemistry (IHC) also showed increased GRHPR expression, and the molecule was located in intestinal epithelial cells (IECs). This phenomenon also occurred in patients with Crohn's disease. Besides, in an in vitro study, human IEC line HT-29 cells cultured with tumor necrosis factor alpha (TNF-alpha) were used to evaluate the changes in expression of GRHPR. Moreover, overexpression of GRHPR was accompanied by active caspase-3 and cleaved poly ADP-ribose polymerase (PARP) accumulation. Furthermore, knock-down GRHPR could inhibit the accumulation of active caspase-3 and cleaved PARP as shown by Western blot in TNF-alpha treated HT-29 cells. Flow cytometry assay indicated that interference of GRHPR led to increasing apoptosis of IECs. These data suggested that GRHPR might exert its pro-apoptosis function in IECs. Thus, GRHPR might play an important role in regulating IECs apoptosis, and might be a potential therapeutic target for CD.},
