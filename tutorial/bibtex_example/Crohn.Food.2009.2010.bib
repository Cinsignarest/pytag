   abstract = {UNLABELLED: This report from the Medical Advisory Secretariat (MAS) was intended to evaluate the clinical utility of vitamin D testing in average risk Canadians and in those with kidney disease. As a separate analysis, this report also includes a systematic literature review of the prevalence of vitamin D deficiency in these two subgroups.This evaluation did not set out to determine the serum vitamin D thresholds that might apply to non-bone health outcomes. For bone health outcomes, no high or moderate quality evidence could be found to support a target serum level above 50 nmol/L. Similarly, no high or moderate quality evidence could be found to support vitamin D's effects in non-bone health outcomes, other than falls. VITAMIN D: Vitamin D is a lipid soluble vitamin that acts as a hormone. It stimulates intestinal calcium absorption and is important in maintaining adequate phosphate levels for bone mineralization, bone growth, and remodelling. It's also believed to be involved in the regulation of cell growth proliferation and apoptosis (programmed cell death), as well as modulation of the immune system and other functions. Alone or in combination with calcium, Vitamin D has also been shown to reduce the risk of fractures in elderly men (>/= 65 years), postmenopausal women, and the risk of falls in community-dwelling seniors. However, in a comprehensive systematic review, inconsistent results were found concerning the effects of vitamin D in conditions such as cancer, all-cause mortality, and cardiovascular disease. In fact, no high or moderate quality evidence could be found concerning the effects of vitamin D in such non-bone health outcomes. Given the uncertainties surrounding the effects of vitamin D in non-bone health related outcomes, it was decided that this evaluation should focus on falls and the effects of vitamin D in bone health and exclusively within average-risk individuals and patients with kidney disease. Synthesis of vitamin D occurs naturally in the skin through exposure to ultraviolet B (UVB) radiation from sunlight, but it can also be obtained from dietary sources including fortified foods, and supplements. Foods rich in vitamin D include fatty fish, egg yolks, fish liver oil, and some types of mushrooms. Since it is usually difficult to obtain sufficient vitamin D from non-fortified foods, either due to low content or infrequent use, most vitamin D is obtained from fortified foods, exposure to sunlight, and supplements. CLINICAL NEED: CONDITION AND TARGET POPULATION Vitamin D deficiency may lead to rickets in infants and osteomalacia in adults. Factors believed to be associated with vitamin D deficiency include: darker skin pigmentation,winter season,living at higher latitudes,skin coverage,kidney disease,malabsorption syndromes such as Crohn's disease, cystic fibrosis, andgenetic factors.Patients with chronic kidney disease (CKD) are at a higher risk of vitamin D deficiency due to either renal losses or decreased synthesis of 1,25-dihydroxyvitamin D. Health Canada currently recommends that, until the daily recommended intakes (DRI) for vitamin D are updated, Canada's Food Guide (Eating Well with Canada's Food Guide) should be followed with respect to vitamin D intake. Issued in 2007, the Guide recommends that Canadians consume two cups (500 ml) of fortified milk or fortified soy beverages daily in order to obtain a daily intake of 200 IU. In addition, men and women over the age of 50 should take 400 IU of vitamin D supplements daily. Additional recommendations were made for breastfed infants. A Canadian survey evaluated the median vitamin D intake derived from diet alone (excluding supplements) among 35,000 Canadians, 10,900 of which were from Ontario. Among Ontarian males ages 9 and up, the median daily dietary vitamin D intake ranged between 196 IU and 272 IU per day. Among females, it varied from 152 IU to 196 IU per day. In boys and girls ages 1 to 3, the median daily dietary vitamin D intake was 248 IU, while among those 4 to 8 years it was 224 IU. VITAMIN D TESTING: Two laboratory tests for vitamin D are available, 25-hydroxy vitamin D, referred to as 25(OH)D, and 1,25-dihydroxyvitamin D. Vitamin D status is assessed by measuring the serum 25(OH)D levels, which can be assayed using radioimmunoassays, competitive protein-binding assays (CPBA), high pressure liquid chromatography (HPLC), and liquid chromatography-tandem mass spectrometry (LC-MS/MS). These may yield different results with inter-assay variation reaching up to 25% (at lower serum levels) and intra-assay variation reaching 10%. The optimal serum concentration of vitamin D has not been established and it may change across different stages of life. Similarly, there is currently no consensus on target serum vitamin D levels. There does, however, appear to be a consensus on the definition of vitamin D deficiency at 25(OH)D < 25 nmol/l, which is based on the risk of diseases such as rickets and osteomalacia. Higher target serum levels have also been proposed based on subclinical endpoints such as parathyroid hormone (PTH). Therefore, in this report, two conservative target serum levels have been adopted, 25 nmol/L (based on the risk of rickets and osteomalacia), and 40 to 50 nmol/L (based on vitamin D's interaction with PTH). ONTARIO CONTEXT: VOLUME #ENTITYSTARTX00026; COST: The volume of vitamin D tests done in Ontario has been increasing over the past 5 years with a steep increase of 169,000 tests in 2007 to more than 393,400 tests in 2008. The number of tests continues to rise with the projected number of tests for 2009 exceeding 731,000. According to the Ontario Schedule of Benefits, the billing cost of each test is $51.7 for 25(OH)D (L606, 100 LMS units, $0.517/unit) and $77.6 for 1,25-dihydroxyvitamin D (L605, 150 LMS units, $0.517/unit). Province wide, the total annual cost of vitamin D testing has increased from approximately $1.7M in 2004 to over $21.0M in 2008. The projected annual cost for 2009 is approximately $38.8M. EVIDENCE-BASED ANALYSIS: The objective of this report is to evaluate the clinical utility of vitamin D testing in the average risk population and in those with kidney disease. As a separate analysis, the report also sought to evaluate the prevalence of vitamin D deficiency in Canada. The specific research questions addressed were thus: What is the clinical utility of vitamin D testing in the average risk population and in subjects with kidney disease?What is the prevalence of vitamin D deficiency in the average risk population in Canada?What is the prevalence of vitamin D deficiency in patients with kidney disease in Canada?Clinical utility was defined as the ability to improve bone health outcomes with the focus on the average risk population (excluding those with osteoporosis) and patients with kidney disease. LITERATURE SEARCH: A literature search was performed on July 17th, 2009 using OVID MEDLINE, MEDLINE In-Process and Other Non-Indexed Citations, EMBASE, the Cumulative Index to Nursing & Allied Health Literature (CINAHL), the Cochrane Library, and the International Agency for Health Technology Assessment (INAHTA) for studies published from January 1, 1998 until July 17th, 2009. Abstracts were reviewed by a single reviewer and, for those studies meeting the eligibility criteria, full-text articles were obtained. Reference lists were also examined for any additional relevant studies not identified through the search. Articles with unknown eligibility were reviewed with a second clinical epidemiologist, then a group of epidemiologists until consensus was established. The quality of evidence was assessed as high, moderate, low or very low according to GRADE methodology. Observational studies that evaluated the prevalence of vitamin D deficiency in Canada in the population of interest were included based on the inclusion and exclusion criteria listed below. The baseline values were used in this report in the case of interventional studies that evaluated the effect of vitamin D intake on serum levels. Studies published in grey literature were included if no studies published in the peer-reviewed literature were identified for specific outcomes or subgroups. Considering that vitamin D status may be affected by factors such as latitude, sun exposure, food fortification, among others, the search focused on prevalence studies published in Canada. In cases where no Canadian prevalence studies were identified, the decision was made to include studies from the United States, given the similar policies in vitamin D food fortification and recommended daily intake. INCLUSION CRITERIA: Studies published in EnglishPublications that reported the prevalence of vitamin D deficiency in CanadaStudies that included subjects from the general population or with kidney diseaseStudies in children or adultsStudies published between January 1998 and July 17(th) 2009 EXCLUSION CRITERIA: Studies that included subjects defined according to a specific disease other than kidney diseaseLetters, comments, and editorialsStudies that measured the serum vitamin D levels but did not report the percentage of subjects with serum levels below a given threshold OUTCOMES OF INTEREST: Prevalence of serum vitamin D less than 25 nmol/LPrevalence of serum vitamin D less than 40 to 50 nmol/LSerum 25-hydroxyvitamin D was the metabolite used to assess vitamin D status. Results from adult and children studies were reported separately. Subgroup analyses according to factors that affect serum vitamin D levels (e.g., seasonal effects, skin pigmentation, and vitamin D intake) were reported if enough information was provided in the studies QUALITY OF EVIDENCE: The quality of the prevalence studies was based on the method of subject recruitment and sampling, possibility of selection bias, and generalizability to the source population. The overall quality of the trials was examined according to the GRADE Working Group criteria. (ABSTRACT TRUNCATED)},

   abstract = {Gastrointestinal disturbances (particularly diarrhea) are often induced in response to cancer treatments such as chemotherapy or radiation. Oral chemotherapeutic agents can induce diarrhea by damaging the intestinal lining. Two common oral drugs used in cancer treatment that are known to have gastrointestinal side effects are capecitabine and lapatinib. In this brief communication, the authors discuss a case study of a stage IV breast cancer patient whose chemotherapy-induced diarrhea was treated successfully with a multispecies combination of probiotics. This is a unique study in which grade 3 chemotherapy-induced diarrhea (characterized by 7-9 stools per day and associated with incontinence and abdominal cramping) was treated with only a multispecies combination of probiotics. Probiotics have been used to treat diarrhea in patients with irritable bowel syndrome, ulcerative colitis, pouchitis, and Crohn's disease. More recently, probiotics have been used to treat chemotherapy-induced diarrhea in colon cancer patients. This case study demonstrates that the probiotics can also be used to treat severe cases of chemotherapy-induced diarrhea in breast cancer patients. The use of different probiotics in gastrointestinal diseases is an increasingly important area of study, and more research into this area is needed. This study demonstrates that probiotics should be considered for advanced breast cancer patients with chemotherapy-induced diarrhea.},

   abstract = {The gastrointestinal tract is the largest lymphoid organ in the body containing T and B lymphocytes, macrophages, and dendritic cells. Despite the fact that these cells are constantly confronted with antigen primarily in the form of food and bacteria, immune responses in the gut are tightly regulated to maintain homeostasis. Without this balance of active immunity and tolerance, mucosal inflammation may ensue, and manifest as Crohn's disease, ulcerative colitis, pernicious anemia, or celiac sprue. Therefore, it is not unreasonable that inflammatory diseases of the gut are commonly encountered in patients with primary immune deficiencies. The exact pathogenesis of gastrointestinal diseases in the setting of primary immunodeficiency remains unknown, however, both humoral and cell-mediated immunity appear to play a role in preventing intestinal inflammation. Patients presenting with atypical gastrointestinal disease and/or failure to respond to conventional therapy should be evaluated for an underlying primary immune disorder in order to initiate appropriate treatment, such as immunoglobulin or in more severe cases bone marrow transplantation, to prevent long term complications.},

   abstract = {Food allergy seems to represent a new spectrum of disease that has elicited significant community concern and extended waiting lists for allergists and gastroenterologists alike. The apparent rise in prevalence of IgE-mediated food allergy (and associated risk of anaphylaxis) has been postulated to result from effects of a "modern lifestyle" but as yet clear environmental risk factors have not yet emerged. Family history seems to contribute to risk suggesting that gene-environment interactions will be important for identifying a subpopulation with increased susceptibility to any identified lifestyle effects. Non-IgE-mediated food allergy (including food-induced enteropathies and colitides, eosinophilic esophagitis, and Crohn's disease) with potentially similar environmental triggers resulting in diverse immune dysregulatory mechanisms. The evidence underpinning the putative rise in food allergy is discussed and potential mechanisms of disease explored. Clinical aspects of various food allergic conditions including non-IgE-mediated food allergy are outlined.},

   abstract = {Johne's disease or paratuberculosis is a chronic granulomatous inflammation of the small intestine of ruminants caused by Mycobacterium avium subsp. paratuberculosis (MAP). Recent studies suggest an association between MAP and Crohn's disease in humans. MAP can become widely distributed within the tissues of infected animals, and meat may be a possible route of exposure of MAP to humans. In this study, 47 dairy and beef cattle were examined for the occurrence of viable MAP in diaphragm muscle. At the slaughterhouse, gut tissues, diaphragm muscle, blood, and feces of the 47 animals were collected for bacteriological culture, as well as gut samples for histopathological analysis. MAP was detected by bacteriological culture and conventional and real-time IS900 polymerase chain reaction in the diaphragm muscle of six infected cattle at slaughter (13%). The six animals showing evidence of MAP in diaphragm muscle had diffuse lesions and severe granulomatous inflammation in ileocecal lymph nodes, jejunal lymph nodes, ileocecal valve, and ileum. All six had heavy bacterial load in mesenteric lymph nodes, ileocecal valve, ileum, and jejunum, and four showed clinical signs of paratuberculosis. Two animals did not show clinical signs but had viable MAP in intestinal tissues and in diaphragm muscle as well. MAP was found in blood of only one of the six animals showing evidence of MAP in diaphragm muscle and in feces of three of them. In general, there was a positive association between enteric lesion severity, clinical signs of paratuberculosis, heavy bacterial load in intestinal tissues, fecal shedding of MAP, and the presence of disseminated MAP infection in diaphragm muscle. The results of this study demonstrated that MAP can be detected and cultured from muscle of MAP-infected cattle destined for human consumption and suggest a possible risk of exposure of humans to MAP via contaminated meat.},

   abstract = {Populations in high infectious exposure countries are at low risk of some immune-mediated diseases such as Crohn's disease and allergy. This low risk is maintained upon immigration to an industrialized country, but the offspring of such immigrants have a higher immune-mediated disease risk than the indigenous population. We hypothesize that early life exposures in a developing country shape the maternal immune system, which could have implications for the offspring born in a developed country with a low infectious load. The aim of this study was to investigate if exposures in childhood (indicated by country of origin) and subsequent exposures influence immunologic characteristics relevant to stimulation of offspring. Breast milk components among 64 mothers resident in Sweden, 32 of whom immigrated from a developing country, were examined using the ELISA and Cytometric Bead Array methods. Immigrants from a developing country had statistically significantly higher levels of breast milk interleukin-6 (IL-6), IL-8 and transforming growth factor-beta1. A larger number of previous pregnancies were associated with down-regulation of several substances, statistically significant for soluble CD14 and IL-8. The results suggest that maternal country of birth may influence adult immune characteristics, potentially relevant to disease risk in offspring. Such a mechanism may explain the higher immune-mediated disease risk among children of migrants from a developing to developed country. Older siblings may influence disease risk through the action of previous pregnancies on maternal immune characteristics.},

   abstract = {BACKGROUND & AIMS: Elemental diet (ED) is effective for human Crohn's disease (CD). Although some of this effectiveness may be due to its low antigenic load and low fat content, the mechanisms remain unclear. We sought to assess the role of histidine, one of the constituent amino acids of ED, in controlling colitis. METHODS: The interleukin (IL)-10-deficient (IL-10(-/-)) cell transfer model of colitis was used. SCID mice with colitis induced by transfer of IL-10(-/-) cells were maintained on experimented diets containing either single amino acids or a mixture. The severity of colitis was assessed by wet colon weight. Colonic tumor necrosis factor (TNF)-alpha messenger RNA (mRNA) expression was detected by quantitative reverse-transcription polymerase chain reaction. Mouse peritoneal macrophages were stimulated by lipopolysaccharides (LPS), with or without amino acids. The concentration of cytokines in the supernatant was determined by enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay. Inhibitor of nuclear factor (NF)-kappaB-alpha and nuclear p65 were confirmed by immunoblotting. RESULTS: In the IL-10(-/-) transfer model, dietary histidine, but not alanine, reduced histologic damage and colon weight and TNF-alpha mRNA expression. Histidine inhibited LPS-induced TNF-alpha and IL-6 production by mouse macrophages in a concentration-dependent manner, whereas alanine or histidine-related metabolites had no such effect. Histidine inhibited LPS-induced NF-kappaB in macrophages. CONCLUSIONS: These results showed that histidine could be a novel therapeutic agent for CD by inhibition of NF-kappaB activation, following down-regulation of proinflammatory cytokine production by macrophages. Thus, our studies provided new insights into the roles of amino acid metabolism in the pathophysiology of CD and for therapeutic strategies.},

A number of recent studies have utilized d-xylose absorption as an investigative tool to study small intestinal function in a variety of clinical settings. Thus, the aim of this experimental study was to evaluate the intestinal absorption of D-xylose in an antigen-specific gut inflammatory reaction rat model. Animals of the experimental group were inoculated with peanut protein extract before their exposure to a challenge diet containing exclusively peanut seeds to induce the gut inflammatory reaction caused by peanut allergy. Our results show that systemic inoculation with peanut protein extract renders significantly higher antibody titres (5.085 +/- 0.126 units) (P < 0.0001) than control rats (0.905 +/- 0.053 units) and that the antibody titres correlate positively to an inflammatory alteration of the gut morphology (P < 0.0001). Animals pertaining to the experimental group showed an intestinal absorption of D-xylose lower than control rats (P < 0.0001). We also observed that D-xylose absorption correlates negatively with IgG titres and positively with morphometric parameters (Pearson correlation). In conclusion, the use of serum D-xylose test was useful to identify the presence of small intestinal malabsorption in our antigen specific gut inflammatory reaction rat model.},

   abstract = {Inflammatory bowel disease is an entity with not wellknown pathogenesis, and important nutritional and metabolic implications because of the high prevalence of malnutrition, the possible implication of dietary factors in its pathogenesis and because of the hypothesis that nutritional intervention could be a primary treatment for the disease. Some nutrients could induce a low antigenic stimuli, regulate inflammatory and immunological responses and stimulate intestinal mucosal trophism. Present available evidence supports enteral nutrition in Crohn's disease as a primary treatment if treatment with steroids is not possible (failure or contraindication) (grade of recommendation A) or either combined treatment with drugs in malnourished patients or those with inflammatory bowel stenosis. In those patients with sustained clinical remission, no benefit of either enteral nutrition or supplements in the absence of nutritional deficits has been shown. Elemental or modified formula (glutamine, omega 3 fatty acids) could not be recommended. In ulcerative colitis, nutritional influence over the activity of the disease has not been shown, although there are some promising results regarding enteric coated W3 fatty acids and a possible role for probiotics. In the treatment and prevention of pouchitis, there could be a role for probiotics (VSL#3). Nutritional treatment should be considered an integral component in the Management of patients with inflammatory bowel disease.},

   abstract = {Aetiology of inflammatory bowel disease (IBD) is complex and probably multifactorial. Nutrition has been proposed to be an important aetiological factor for development of IBD. Several components of the diet (such as sugar, fat, fibre, fruit and vegetable, protein, fast food, preservatives etc.) were examined as possible causative agents for IBD. According to some researchers infant feeding (breast feeding) may also contribute to the development of IBD. Though the importance of environmental factors is evidenced by the increasing incidence in developed countries and in migrant population in recent decades, the aetiology of IBD remained unclear. There are many theories, but as yet no dietary approaches have been proved to reduce the risk of developing IBD. The role of nutrition in the management of IBD is better understood. The prevention and correction of malnutrition, the provision of macro- and micronutrients and vitamins and the promotion of optimal growth and development of children are key points of nutritional therapy. In active disease, the effective support of energy and nutrients is a very important part of the therapy. Natural and artificial nutrition or the combination of two can be chosen for supporting therapy of IBD. The author summarises the aetiological and therapeutic role of nutrition in IBD.},

   abstract = {INTRODUCTION: The use of video capsule endoscopy (VCE) started in late 2001 when it was approved by the Food and Drug Administration (FDA). Since then, we are able to visualize small bowel mucosa with a minimally invasive technique, very comfortable for patients, with very few complications and without the need of hospitalization. At Dubrava University Hospital, we have been using VCE since October 2006, and by February 2008 we examined 30 patients. AIM: The aim of the study was to present our preliminary results in the use of VCE during a period of one year and five months. We also report indications and contraindications for VCE, and patient preparation. METHODS: In this retrospective study we reviewed records on 30 patients that had undergone VCE at Dubrava University Hospital, Zagreb, Croatia, between October 2006 and February 2008. The indications for VCE were restricted to the investigation of obscure gastrointestinal bleeding (OGIB) (n = 10), iron deficiency anemia (n = 2), suspected Crohn's disease (n = 1), assessment of known small bowel Crohn's disease (n = 5), unexplained diarrhea (n = 6), chronic abdominal pain (n = 3), suspected ganglioneurinoma (n = 1) and suspected polyposis syndrome (n = 2). To be eligible for VCE, patients had to have previously undergone usual diagnostic methods of upper endoscopy, colonoscopy and small bowel follow-through, without discovering the cause of their symptoms. Before swallowing the capsule, patients were instructed not to eat anything the day before VCE and to drink 4 L of liquids, and additional 2 L magnesium sulfate. In all patients we used Olympus EndoCapsule Software (Tokyo, Japan). Results were interpreted by one specialist, gastroenterologist. RESULTS: Definitive diagnosis was made in 15 patients. Suspect findings were noted in 2 patients, whereas no diagnosis could be established in 13 patients. According to our experience, VCE is a promising new method that has a high diagnostic yield in patients with OGIB and known Crohn's disease. Use of VCE enabled definitive diagnosis to be made in 6 of 10 patients with OGIB after all previously used diagnostic methods had failed to reveal any pathological finding. In the group of OGIB patients, angiodysplasia was the most common findings (4 of 10 patients). In the group of patients with Crohn's disease, progression of the disease to neotherminal ileum was recorded in 3 of 5 patients. Our experience also confirmed the VCE to be a very safe method; capsule retention was recorded in only one patient. DISCUSSION: Although VCE enabled us to visualize the small bowel mucosa and therefore helped us establish the diagnosis in cases where other diagnostic methods had failed, it still has some important limitations, the major one being the impossibility to take biopsies and to perform any therapeutic procedures. However, it has a high diagnostic yield in cases of OGIB and Crohn's disease, is very comfortable for patients, and has a low incidence of complications (capsule retention). When making definitive diagnosis, one should always consider patient's history and physical examination findings as well as other possible causes of small bowel mucosal impairment. CONCLUSION: VCE is a promising new technique that has a high diagnostic yield in patients with OGIB and Crohn's disease. However, more studies need to be done to establish definitive indications, cost-effectiveness and the best way of patient preparation for VCE.},

   abstract = {BACKGROUND: Inappropriate responses to normal intestinal bacteria may be involved in the development of Inflammatory Bowel Diseases (IBD, e.g. Crohn's Disease (CD), Ulcerative Colitis (UC)) and variations in the host genome may mediate this process. IL-10 gene-deficient (Il10-/-) mice develop CD-like colitis mainly in the colon, in part due to inappropriate responses to normal intestinal bacteria including Enterococcus strains, and have therefore been used as an animal model of CD. Comprehensive characterization of changes in cecum gene expression levels associated with inflammation in the Il10-/- mouse model has recently been reported. Our aim was to characterize changes in colonic gene expression levels in Il10-/- and C57BL/6J (C57; control) mice resulting from oral bacterial inoculation with 12 Enterococcus faecalis and faecium (EF) strains isolated from calves or poultry, complex intestinal flora (CIF) collected from healthy control mice, or a mixture of the two (EF.CIF). We investigated two hypotheses: (1) that oral inoculation of Il10-/- mice would result in greater and more consistent intestinal inflammation than that observed in Il10-/- mice not receiving this inoculation, and (2) that this inflammation would be associated with changes in colon gene expression levels similar to those previously observed in human studies, and these mice would therefore be an appropriate model for human CD. RESULTS: At 12 weeks of age, total RNA extracted from intact colon was hybridized to Agilent 44 k mouse arrays. Differentially expressed genes were identified using linear models for microarray analysis (Bioconductor), and these genes were clustered using GeneSpring GX and Ingenuity Pathways Analysis software. Intestinal inflammation was increased in Il10-/- mice as a result of inoculation, with the strongest effect being in the EF and EF.CIF groups. Genes differentially expressed in Il10-/- mice as a result of EF or EF.CIF inoculation were associated with the following pathways: inflammatory disease (111 genes differentially expressed), immune response (209 genes), antigen presentation (11 genes, particularly major histocompatability complex Class II), fatty acid metabolism (30 genes) and detoxification (31 genes). CONCLUSIONS: Our results suggest that colonic inflammation in Il10-/- mice inoculated with solutions containing Enterococcus strains is associated with gene expression changes similar to those of human IBD, specifically CD, and that with the EF.CIF inoculum in particular this is an appropriate model to investigate food-gene interactions relevant to human CD.},

   abstract = {BACKGROUND: Fermentable, short chain carbohydrates (FODMAPs) have been identified as triggers for functional gastrointestinal symptoms. In addition, excess FODMAP consumption has been implicated in the onset of Crohn's disease, and animal studies suggest that a low glycemic index diet can impair absorption of fructose, a major dietary FODMAP. Such hypotheses cannot be tested without the ability to quantify FODMAP ingestion with a validated dietary assessment tool. OBJECTIVE: To assess the validity and reproducibility of a 297-item comprehensive, semi-quantitative food frequency questionnaire (FFQ) in estimating intake of macro- and micronutrients, FODMAPs, and glycemic index/load. SUBJECTS/SETTING: One hundred healthy participants were recruited to complete the FFQ on two occasions, plus four 1-week food diaries kept during a 12-month period. Participants exhibiting major dietary change during the study period or low energy reporting on the FFQ were excluded. MAIN OUTCOME MEASURES: Validation and reproducibility of the semi-quantitative FFQ by comparison with the mean of four 1-week food diaries. STATISTICAL ANALYSES PERFORMED: Validation was assessed using Wilcoxon signed rank test, Spearman's correlation, Bland-Altman, and weighted kappa statistics. Reproducibility was examined using Shrout-Fleiss intraclass correlation coefficient. RESULTS: Seventy-two participants fulfilled inclusion and exclusion criteria. Demographics of the participants were comparable with 2006 Australian Census data. Consistent with other reported FFQs, the FFQ overestimated nutrient intake by a mean 140% (range=95% to 249%). However, based on the other analyses performed, it demonstrated validity for intake of sugars, fiber, alcohol, glycemic index, glucose, FODMAPs, calcium, folate, phosphate, potassium, iron, and magnesium; moderate validation for energy, total fat, saturated fat, carbohydrates, sodium, thiamin, sucrose, and retinol; poor validation for protein, mono/polyunsaturated fat, starch, glycemic load, niacin, and zinc. Riboflavin intake was not validated. Intraclass correlation coefficients for reproducibility ranged from 0.352 to 0.928. CONCLUSIONS: The FFQ was validated for assessment of a wide range of nutrients, including the new class of carbohydrates, FODMAPs, and glycemic index. This provides a useful tool for dietary research, particularly in the area of gastroenterological disorders.},

   abstract = {PURPOSE OF REVIEW: Inflammatory bowel disease (IBD) is a debilitating and widespread immune-mediated illness of unknown etiology. Current treatments are modestly successful and with significant side-effects. The purpose of this review is to summarize the current understanding of mechanisms of action underlying the anti-inflammatory actions of conjugated linoleic acid (CLA) and n-3 polyunsaturated fatty acids (PUFAs) in IBD. RECENT FINDINGS: Nutrition-based interventions that target peroxisome proliferator-activated receptors (PPARs) such as dietary CLA and n-3 PUFA have demonstrated anti-inflammatory efficacy in animal models of IBD. Clinical data on n-3 PUFA in IBD remains generally unimpressive, although results of a recent human study demonstrate that IBD remission can be maintained by maintaining the n-3: n-6 ratio more than 0.65 via n-3 PUFA intervention. In mice, CLA prevented inflammation-driven colorectal cancer by activating PPAR gamma and modulating regulatory T cells and macrophages. CLA is the subject of an ongoing clinical study in Crohn's disease patients. SUMMARY: Compelling evidence demonstrates that n-3 PUFA and CLA prevent or ameliorate IBD in animal models. However, this basic knowledge has not been translated into novel nutrition-based clinical interventions. For both compounds there is an urgent need for placebo-controlled, large-scale, multicenter clinical trials.},

   abstract = {Crohn's disease (CD) and ulcerative colitis (UC) belong to the group of inflammatory bowel diseases (IBD), with complex ethiopathogenic factors that include an unbalanced immune and inflammatory response to commensal and food antigens. The differential diagnosis between CD and UC is performed using clinical, endoscopic, histopathological, serological and radiological methods; however between 10-15% of IBD patients are diagnosed as "unclassified colitis". Further research into IBD is necessary in order to develop additional diagnostic tools. The aim of this work was to see if the Th1, Th17 or Th2 immune pattern, represented by CD4+ lymphocytes producing IFN-gamma, IL-17 and IL-5 or IL-13, respectively (CD4/IFN-gamma+, CD4/IL-17+,CD4/IL-5+ or, CD4/IL13+), are useful peripheral markers which can be used to differentiate between UC and CD. Peripheral blood samples were taken from IBD patients from the Clinic Hospital of the University of Chile. The percentage of IFN-gamma-, IL-17-, IL-5- or IL-13-expressing CD4+ cells was determined by flow cytometry in phorbol ester- (PMA) and calcymycin-activated blood samples. The percentages of the CD4+ cell populations producing each cytokine were compared between UC and CD. IFN-gamma production by CD4+ lymphocytes was significantly higher in CD compared to UC and the control. The percentage of IL-17-expressing cells was significantly higher in CD patients compared to to the control; however, there were no differences between UC and CD; or between UC and healthy individuals. No significant differences were observed between the different groups as regards the representative Th2 cytokines. This study suggests that, under pathogenic conditions, several immune profiles may be operating, in the development of IBD. Although peripheral IFN-gamma and IL-17 expression, as indicators of the immune pattern, may help in the diagnosis of IBD, other cytokines and adaptive immune markers should be analyzed to allow better differentiation between the two entities.},

   abstract = {BACKGROUND: Environmental factors are thought to play an important role in the development of Crohn's disease (CD). Immune responses against auto-antigens or food antigens may be a reason for the perpetuation of inflammation. METHODS: In a pilot study, 79 CD patients and 20 healthy controls were examined for food immunoglobulin G (IgG). Thereafter, the clinical relevance of these food IgG antibodies was assessed in a double-blind cross-over study with 40 patients. Based on the IgG antibodies, a nutritional intervention was planned. The interferon (IFN)gamma secretion of T cells was measured. Eosinophil-derived neurotoxin was quantified in stool. RESULTS: The pilot study resulted in a significant difference of IgG antibodies in serum between CD patients and healthy controls. In 84 and 83% of the patients, respectively, IgG antibodies against processed cheese and yeast were detected. The daily stool frequency significantly decreased by 11% during a specific diet compared with a sham diet. Abdominal pain reduced and general well-being improved. IFNgamma secretion of T cells increased. No difference for eosinophil-derived neurotoxin in stool was detected. CONCLUSION: A nutritional intervention based on circulating IgG antibodies against food antigens showed effects with respect to stool frequency. The mechanisms by which IgG antibodies might contribute to disease activity remain to be elucidated.},

   abstract = {The intestinal microbiota are a complex ecosystem influencing the immunoregulation of the human host, providing protection from colonising pathogens and producing SCFA as the main energy source of colonocytes. Our objective was to investigate the effect of dietary fibre exclusion and supplementation on the intestinal microbiota and SCFA concentrations. Faecal samples were obtained from healthy volunteers before and after two 14 d periods of consuming formulated diets devoid or supplemented with fibre (14 g/l). The faecal microbiota were analysed using fluorescent in situ hybridisation and SCFA were measured using GLC. There were large and statistically significant reductions in the numbers of the Faecalibacterium prausnitzii (P < or = 0.01) and Roseburia spp. (P < or = 0.01) groups during both the fibre-free and fibre-supplemented diets. Significant and strong positive correlations between the proportion of F. prausnitzii and the proportion of butyrate during both baseline normal diets were found (pre-fibre free r 0.881, P = 0.001; pre-fibre supplemented r 0.844, P = 0.002). A significant correlation was also found between the proportional reduction in F. prausnitzii and the proportional reduction in faecal butyrate during both the fibre-free (r 0.806; P = 0.005) and the fibre-supplemented diet (r 0.749; P = 0.013). These findings may contribute to the understanding of the association between fibre, microbiota and fermentation in health, during enteral nutrition and in disease states such as Crohn's disease.},

   abstract = {Lactic acid bacteria (LAB) are gaining importance due to their "generally recognized as safe" status, long-term use in food and beneficial, probiotic properties. They can acquire new, desirable traits by the incorporation of genes that allow the expression of heterologous proteins, and several patents and patent applications describe the use of recombinant LAB. We first focus on the available expression systems, their improvement towards "food-grade" status, and modes of regulating the expression. LAB have been used as vehicles for the delivery of proteins to the mucosal surfaces. Delivered proteins may interact with the immune system and have been shown to be effective, either as vaccines or as tolerance-inducing, anti-allergy agents in mice. Proteins with biological functions that could be used in therapy have also been delivered. Delivery of interleukin 10 (IL-10) in Crohn's disease, which was tested in a human phase I clinical trial and has proceeded to phase IIa, is the first example of use of recombinant LAB in humans. Another field of recombinant LAB application is metabolic engineering. Existing metabolic pathways have been modified to improve the properties of LAB as food fermentation starters, and heterologous metabolic enzymes have been introduced to LAB for the production of industrially relevant chemicals.},

Epidemiologic studies present data on disease burden, but may also provide clues to disease etiology. The emergence of IBD in developing nations warrants a systematic search for environmental changes in those countries to explain the evolution of IBD. The hygiene hypothesis suggests that an alteration in the microbial environment experienced by the host facilitates the evolution of chronic immune-mediated diseases. One complex database study suggested that areas with high species richness of human intestinal helminthes are areas with genetic changes in interleukin gene loci. In other words, over the years, the microbial ecology has affected human genetics, which in turn would have an impact on immune responses. Other factors affect the gut microbiome, and several studies have explored the increase in incidence of IBD in relation to such factors as exogenous infections, use of antibiotics, and diet.},

Because of its immunosuppressive effects, natalizumab has been associated with a number of atypical and opportunistic infections. AIM: To describe and summarize six spontaneously reported post-marketing cases of clinically significant drug induced-liver injury associated with natalizumab use. METHODS: The FDA maintains a database of adverse event reports (AERS). We searched the AERS database for reports of serious liver injury associated with natalizumab use from November 2004, when the drug was approved, through 30 June 2008. RESULTS: The search resulted in six spontaneously reported post-marketing cases of severe drug-induced liver injury. Four of six patients developed liver injury with elevations of serum transaminases and hyperbilirubinemia after only a single infusion of natalizumab. One of these patients experienced repeated increases of aminotransferases and bilirubin when natalizumab was re-administered. CONCLUSIONS: Serious hepatic injury may occur in association with natalizumab use. Health professionals should be alerted to possible serious liver injury in patients receiving natalizumab.},

   abstract = {INTRODUCTION: Crohn's disease (CD) may lead to protein and calorie malnutrition (PCM) secondary to impaired digestive and absorptive functions of the small intestine and sometimes to the influence of diet taboos. The earlier the PCM is diagnosed, the higher are the odds of reversal. The objective of this study was to compare different methods of nutritional assessment in patients with CD and correlate them with the disease characteristics. SAMPLE: The sample comprised 75 patients with CD from the Gastroenterology Service at the Hospital de Clinicas de Porto Alegre; 37 were male, with a mean age of 38.2 years old (SD = 13.3). All patients had been in clinical remission (CDAI <150) for over 3 months. They were not receiving enteral or parenteral nutrition. The nutritional assessment was considered: body mass index (BMI), triceps skin fold (TSF), arm circumference (MAC), arm muscle circumference (MAMC), subjective global assessment (SGA), non-dominating handgrip strength (HGS) and food intake inquiries. RESULTS: When comparing the different nutritional assessment methods, 26.7% of the patients were malnourished according to the MAC, 29.3% according to the MAMC, 18.7% according to the SGA, 6.7% according to the BMI, 37.3% according to the TSF and 73.3% according to the HGS. No statistically significant associations were found for disease location, its behavior, drugs utilized, ESR, CRP, age of patients and disease time with the nutritional state verified by HGS, TSF, MAMC and SGA. CONCLUSION: The prevalence of malnutrition is significant in patients with CD, even in clinical remission. The BMI should not be used as reference in this population. The HGS detected a high prevalence of nutritional risk in patients with CD in remission. Studies are required that correlate it with more sensitive methods, for the patients' effective nutritional state assessment.},

Detection of MAP from milk and dairy products has been reported from countries on the European continent, Argentina, the UK and Australia. In this study three different methods (quantitative real time PCR, combined phage IS900 PCR and conventional cultivation) were used to detect the presence of MAP in bulk tank milk (BTM) and cheese originating from sheep, goat and mixed milks from farms and products in Cyprus. During the first survey the presence of MAP was detected in 63 (28.6%) of cows' BTM samples by quantitative real time PCR. A second survey of BTM used a new combined phage IS900 PCR assay, and in this case MAP was detected in 50 (22.2%) samples showing a good level of agreement by both methods. None of the herds tested were known to be affected by Johne's disease and the presence of viable MAP was confirmed by conventional culture in only two cases of cows BTM. This suggests that either rapid method used is more sensitive than the conventional culture when testing raw milk samples for MAP. The two isolates recovered from BTM were identified by IS1311 PCR REA as cattle and sheep strains, respectively. In contrast when cheese samples were tested, MAP DNA was detected by quantitative real time PCR in seven (25.0%) samples (n=28). However no viable MAP was detected when either the combined phage IS900 PCR or conventional culture methods were used.},

Unfortunately, certain drugs can cause serious side effects, and surgeries must often be repeated. No diet has been established to alleviate the pain and suffering of CD patients. This is curious given the fact that a higher prevalence of food sensitivities exist in this population of patients, and enteral nutrition is not only the first-line of therapy in Japan, but a known research method used to place the majority of CD patients into remission. Although not all patients respond equally to diet, many simply remove symptom-provoking foods, such as dairy, wheat, corn and certain fruits and vegetables. We suggest assisting these patients in their self-assessment of irritating and symptom-provoking foods by educating them in the use of a food-symptom diary followed by a customized elimination diet trialed for 2-4 weeks to determine if there is any benefit to the individual patient.},

Since the isolation of MAP from intestinal tissue of human patients bearing Crohn's disease, there has been a debate on the possibility of this agent playing a role in the etiology of Crohn's disease. Milk could be the potential vehicle for transmission to humans. Mycobacterium avium ssp. paratuberculosis has already been detected in milk samples worldwide. In Brazil, detection of MAP is uncommon; however, it has already been detected by bacterial isolation and serological test. The aim of this study was to investigate the presence of MAP, by PCR, in raw milk samples in the region of Vicosa, Minas Gerais State, Brazil. Of 222 milk samples evaluated, 8 (3.6%) quarter milk samples amplified fragments of similar size to that expected of 626 bp. These fragments were cloned and sequenced. The genetic analysis revealed a 99% identity match between the sequences obtained in this study and the insertion sequence IS900 deposited in the GenBank. In the analyzed milk samples, MAP DNA was detected, confirming its presence in dairy cattle in the region of Vicosa. This is the first report of MAP presence in raw milk samples in Brazil.},

METHODS: A prospective, single center, 2-year clinical trial was conducted. Twenty-two adult CD patients who achieved clinical remission either medically (n = 17) or surgically (n = 5) and consumed an SVD during hospitalization were advised to continue with an SVD and avoid known high-risk foods for inflammatory bowel disease. The primary endpoint was clinical relapse defined as the appearance of active symptoms of CD. Kaplan-Meier survival analysis was used to calculate the cumulative proportion of patients who had a relapse. A 2-year analysis of relapse rates of patients who followed an SVD and those who did not (an omnivorous diet group) was undertaken. RESULTS: SVD was continued by 16 patients (compliance 73%). Remission was maintained in 15 of 16 patients (94%) in the SVD group vs two of six (33%) in the omnivorous group. Remission rate with SVD was 100% at 1 year and 92% at 2 years. SVD showed significant prevention in the time to relapse compared to that in the omnivorous group (P = 0.0003, log rank test). The concentration of C-reactive protein was normal at the final visit in more than half of the patients in remission who were taking an SVD, who maintained remission during the study (9/15; 60%), who terminated follow-up (8/12; 67%), and who completed 2 years follow-up (7/10; 70%). There was no untoward effect of SVD. CONCLUSION: SVD was highly effective in preventing relapse in CD.},

   abstract = {OBJECTIVES: Comorbidity with Clostridium difficile may cause diagnostic delay in newly presenting inflammatory bowel disease (IBD) patients, trigger relapse in established disease, confound therapies, and serve as an indicator of an underlying defect in innate immunity. Retrospective analyses have suggested community acquisition; to address this we conducted a prospective analysis of C. difficile carriage in IBD patients using molecular methods specifically in an outpatient setting. METHODS: Recruited participants had long-standing diagnoses of ulcerative colitis (n = 64) and Crohn's disease (n = 58), were in clinical remission, and had no recent exposure to antibiotics, corticosteroids, immunomodulatory drugs or recent hospitalization. Isolates were cultured from stools and confirmed by 16S sequencing. The antibiotic susceptibilities of the isolates were tested followed by further strain characterization by toxinotyping, ribotyping, and pulsed-field gel electrophoresis (PFGE). RESULTS: The frequency of toxigenic C. difficile was higher in IBD patients than in healthy volunteers at 8.2 and 1.0%, respectively (P = 0.02 Fisher's exact test). All strains belonged to toxinotype 0 with rare subtypes of this group noted in five isolates and represented by an altered repressor genotype. Patients harbored a diverse range of toxigenic ribotype groups, including those previously associated with C. difficile-associated disease (CDAD) (R015, R005, and R020) and the rarer types R062, R050, and R003. Interestingly, common nosocomial groups were not identified. The considerable nonclonal distribution of distinct strains was further demonstrated by PFGE genomic fingerprinting. None of the study subjects experienced a clinical episode of CDAD during a 6-month period of follow-up. CONCLUSIONS: Detection of C. difficile is increased in IBD outpatients in remission, and strain diversity is consistent with community acquisition from a multitude of sources.},

In addition, both lack preventive and curative therapies. Because a high percentage of Crohn's patients harbor MAP, it is not surprising that MAP is at the center of controversy as to its contribution. Special concern is being raised as to what role, if any, food animals play in transmission of MAP to humans. Because management practices, presently considered the best way to control the spread of MAP, have not and most likely will not eliminate MAP from food animals, other preventive or curative measures are needed. The results presented herein show that a unique bacterium, Dietzia ssp. C79793-74, used as a probiotic, was therapeutic for adult paratuberculosis animals, and resulted in a cure rate of 37.5%.},

C79793-74, previously shown to inhibit growth of Mycobacterium subsp. paratuberculosis under in vitro culture conditions, has therapeutic value as a probiotic for adult cattle with paratuberculosis. Animals were obtained from several herds with evidence of disease based on seropositivity and/or fecal shedding. Sixty-eight cows with initial evidence of Stage II or III paratuberculosis and 2 with an initial Stage IV disease were evaluated longitudinally. Animals were either treated daily with variable, disease-dependent doses of Dietzia (n = 48) or left untreated (n = 22). Clinical aspects of disease (diarrhea, emaciated, cachectic and appetite) were recorded until the animal recovered or required euthanasia due to advanced clinical paratuberculosis or other severe conditions. Paratuberculosis parameters-antibody serology (ELISA, AGID) and fecal culture-were longitudinally monitored over the lifetime of each animal. The results indicated that daily treatment with Dietzia was therapeutic for paratuberculosis cows based on: (a) longitudinal decline in ELISA values only occurred in animals that were treated; (b) prolonged survival was dependant upon treatment--the length being directly associated with low initial ELISA values; and (c) treated animals were the only ones cured of disease. Further investigations are envisaged to determine optimal, long-term dosages that may result in even better therapeutic outcomes as well as to evaluate potential application for therapy of the Johne's disease, human-counterpart, Crohn's disease.},

   abstract = {Johne's disease, caused by Mycobacterium avium, subspecies paratuberculosis (MAP) is becoming increasingly widespread on dairy farms worldwide, due in part, to the absence of vaccine/drug or curative modalities. This spread is of concern since MAP is at the center of a controversy as to its role in Crohn's disease. None of the methods presently available to define paratuberculosis in cattle have been examined for their ability to assess progression/regression of any treatment or intervention of this disease The research presented herein, therefore was designed to assess the reliability and accuracy of available ante-mortem assays to predict disease change of individual animals undergoing a probiotic, potentially therapeutic, treatment. Paratuberculosis positive (n = 75) and negative (n = 10) animals were longitudinally monitored over their natural lifetimes with specific serum antibody and fecal shedding assays, and for development of end-stage clinical disease. Longitudinal, increasing/decreasing serum ELISA values were associated with, and predictive of, progression/regression of disease. Changes in fecal shedding and serum AGID were of value at only specific stages. Documentation that ELISA-positive animals were positive for paratuberculosis was done by a compilation of ELISA-independent assays--succumbing with end-stage clinical disease, autopsy, AGID, and MAP fecal shedding.},

   abstract = {The pathophysiology of inflammatory bowel diseases (IBDs) is multifactorial and involves interactions of gut luminal content with mucosal barrier and especially immune cells. Malnutrition is a frequent issue during IBD flares, especially in Crohn's disease (CD) patients, and nutritional support is frequently used to treat malnutrition but also in an attempt to modulate intestinal inflammation. The use of oral or enteral nutrition intervention in IBDs may be effective, alone or in combination with drugs, to achieve and maintain remission. However, standard diets are less effective than new-generation biotherapies and could be improved by supplementation with specific immunomodulatory amino acids. Experimental studies evaluating glutamine, the preferential substrate for enterocytes, are promising. Some clinical studies with oral glutamine in CD are until now disappointing, but new formulations and targeting could enhance glutamine efficacy at the site of mucosal lesions. The role of arginine, involved in nitric oxide and polyamines synthesis, still remains debated. However, the effects of these amino acids in IBD have been poorly documented in humans. Other candidates like glycine, cysteine, histidine, or taurine should also be evaluated in the future.},

This is a chronic and relapsing condition of unknown aetiology that comprises chiefly ulcerative colitis and Crohn's disease. Although there are treatments for IBD, they have frequent side effects and they are not always effective; therefore there is a need for new therapies that could alleviate this condition. Two bioactive peptides present in milk (transforming growth factor-beta (TGF-beta) and casein macropeptide, also named glycomacropeptide) have been shown to have intestinal anti-inflammatory activities. In fact, TGF-beta is currently added to formulas intended for patients with IBD, and several studies indicate that these formulas could induce clinical remission. In this paper, evidence supporting the anti-inflammatory effect of TGF-beta and bovine glycomacropeptide, as well as their mechanisms of action, is reviewed, focusing on the evidence obtained in animal models.},

In CD patients, the comparative effects on nutritional status of infliximab and traditional therapy have not yet been determined. The aim of our study was to assess the effects of infliximab as compared with those of standard therapy on nutritional status, disease activity, resting energy expenditure (REE), and food intake in CD children and adolescents. METHODS: From September 1999 to September 2005, all CD patients treated with infliximab (group A) were reviewed and matched with CD patients treated with traditional therapy (mesalazine and azathioprine) (group B). RESULTS: Fourteen CD patients from group A and 14 from group B were included; median interval before follow-up investigation was 10 months. Baseline and final values of weight, height, body mass index (BMI), pediatric CD activity index (pCDAI), REE, and food intake were studied. In treated patients, but not in control group, mean baseline weight (kg) and BMI values, 39.7 +/- 13.1 and 17.9 +/- 3.3, respectively, were significantly lower than their final values 42.6 +/- 13.2 and 18.9 +/- 3.1, and median pCDAI values 23.5 were significantly higher than their final values 10 (P < 0.05). Significant changes in height, REE, and food intake were not found in either group. CONCLUSIONS: In pediatric CD patients, infliximab seems to impact positively on the nutritional status as demonstrated by the improvement in weight and BMI, but not in linear growth; effects on nutritional status seem to be due to amelioration of disease activity, rather than to REE reduction or food intake increase.},

   abstract = {BACKGROUND: Recurrence of Crohn's disease is common after intestinal resection. A number of agents have been studied in controlled trials with the goal of reducing the risk of endoscopic or clinical recurrence of Crohn's disease following surgery. OBJECTIVES: To undertake a systematic review of the use of medical therapies for the prevention of post-operative recurrence of Crohn's disease SEARCH STRATEGY: MEDLINE, EMBASE and the Cochrane Central Register of Controlled Trials (CENTRAL) were searched to identify relevant studies. References from selected papers and abstracts from Digestive Disease Week were also searched. SELECTION CRITERIA: Randomised controlled trials that compared medical therapy to placebo or other medical agents for the prevention of recurrence of intestinal Crohn's disease were selected for inclusion. DATA COLLECTION AND ANALYSIS: Two authors reviewed all abstracts containing search terms, and those meeting inclusion criteria were selected for full data abstraction. Dichotomous data were summarised using relative risk and 95% confidence intervals. A fixed-effects model was used, and sensitivity analysis performed. MAIN RESULTS: Twenty-three studies were identified for inclusion. Probiotics were not superior to placebo for any outcome measured. The use of nitroimidazole antibiotics appeared to reduce the risk of clinical (RR 0.23; 95%CI 0.09 to 0.57, NNT=4) and endoscopic (RR 0.44; 95%CI 0.26 to 0.74, NNT = 4) recurrence relative to placebo. However, these agents were associated with higher risk of serious adverse events (RR 2.39, 95% CI 1.5 to 3.7). Mesalamine therapy was associated with a significantly reduced risk of clinical recurrence (RR 0.76; 95% CI 0.62 to 0.94, NNT = 12), and severe endoscopic recurrence (RR 0.50; 95% CI 0.29 to 0.84, NNT = 8) when compared to placebo. Azathioprine/6MP was also associated with a significantly reduced risk of clinical recurrence (RR 0.59; 95% CI 0.38 to 0.92, NNT = 7), and severe endoscopic recurrence (RR 0.64; 95% CI 0.44 to 0.92, NNT = 4), when compared to placebo. Neither agent had a higher risk than placebo of serious adverse events. When compared to azathioprine/6MP, mesalamine was associated with a higher risk of any endoscopic recurrence (RR 1.45, 95% CI 1.03 to 2.06), but a lower risk of serious adverse events (RR 0.51; 95% CI 0.30 to 0.89). There was no significant difference between mesalamine and azathioprine/6MP for any other outcome. AUTHORS' CONCLUSIONS: There are insufficient randomised controlled trials of infliximab, budesonide, tenovil and interleukin-10 to draw conclusions. Nitro-imidazole antibiotics, mesalamine and immunosuppressive therapy with azathioprine/6-MP or infliximab all appear to be superior to placebo for the prevention of post-operative recurrence of Crohn's disease. The cost, toxicity and tolerability of these approaches require careful consideration to determine the optimal approach for post-operative prophylaxis.},

   abstract = {BACKGROUND: Enteric bacteria play an important early role in the pathogenesis of Crohn's disease. AIM: To perform a meta-analysis of trials testing antibiotics or probiotics for prevention of post-operative recurrence of Crohn's disease. METHODS: Review of all randomized controlled trials comparing antibiotics or probiotics with placebo in prevention of endoscopic or clinical recurrence of Crohn's disease after surgical resection. Fixed-effect meta-analysis was performed with dichotomous data summarized using relative risk with 95% confidence intervals, where appropriate. RESULTS: Seven studies were identified as suitable for inclusion (two comparing antibiotics with placebo, five comparing probiotics with placebo). The use of nitroimidazole antibiotics (metronidazole, ornidazole) reduced the risk of clinical (RR 0.23; 95% CI 0.09-0.57, NNT = 4) and endoscopic (RR 0.44; 95% CI 0.26-0.74, NNT = 4) recurrence relative to placebo. However, these agents were associated with higher risk of adverse events (RR 2.39, 95% CI 1.5-3.7) and patient withdrawal. Probiotic administration was not associated with any significant difference in risk of recurrence compared with placebo. CONCLUSIONS: Nitroimidazole antibiotics are effective in the prevention of post-operative Crohn's disease recurrence, but their side-effects limit acceptability. Probiotics have failed to show efficacy for post-operative prophylaxis, but may merit further study.},

   abstract = {BACKGROUND: Mycobacterium avium subsp. paratuberculosis (MAP) is the etiological agent of paratuberculosis (Johne's disease) in ruminants and is suggested to be one of the etiologic factors in Crohn's disease in humans. Contaminated milk might expose humans to that pathogen. The aim of the present study was to develop a novel real-time PCR assay providing the additional possibility to detect viable Mycobacterium avium subsp. paratuberculosis (MAP) based on the MAP-specific Mptb52.16 target. The design included an internal amplification control to identify false negative results. FINDINGS: Inclusivity and exclusivity tested on 10 MAP strains, 22 non-MAP mycobacteria, and 16 raw milk microflora strains achieved 100%. The detection limit in artificially contaminated raw milk was 2.42 x 101 MAP cells/ml milk. In a survey of naturally contaminated samples obtained from dairy herds with a known history of paratuberculosis, 47.8% pre-milk and 51.9% main milk samples tested positive. Real-time PCR-derived MAP-specific bacterial cell equivalents (bce) ranged from 1 x 100 to 5.1 x 102 bce/51 ml; the majority of samples had less than one bce per ml milk. Expression of the chosen target was detected in artificially contaminated raw milk as well as inoculated Dubos broth, thus confirming the real-time PCR assay's potential to detect viable MAP cells. CONCLUSIONS: Concentrating the DNA of a large sample volume in combination with the newly developed real-time PCR assay permitted quantification of low levels of MAP cells in raw milk and pasteurized milk. The selected target - Mptb52.16 - is promising with regard to the detection of viable MAP. Future studies integrating quantitative DNA- and RNA-based data might provide important information for risk assessment concerning the presence of MAP in raw milk and pasteurized milk.},

   abstract = {BACKGROUND: Human ex vivo evidence indicating that an inappropriate immune response(s) to nonpathogenic bacteria contributes to disease pathogenesis in pediatric Crohn's disease (CD) is limited. The aim of the present study was to compare and contrast the early innate immune response of pediatric "healthy" versus CD mucosa to pathogenic, probiotic, and commensal bacteria. METHODS: "Healthy control" and CD pediatric mucosal biopsies (terminal ileum and transverse colon) were cocultured for 8 hours with E. coli O42, Lactobacillus GG (LGG), Bacteroidesthetaiotaomicron (B. theta), or stimulated with interleukin (IL)-1beta (positive control). Matched nonstimulated biopsies served as experimental controls. IL-8 was the immune marker of choice. IL-8 mRNA and protein levels were quantified by quantitative polymerase chain reaction and sandwich enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay, respectively. RESULTS: IL-8 secretion was observed when control, ileal biopsies were exposed to pathogenic O42 and probiotic LGG, with no response noted to commensal B. theta. In comparison, Crohn's ileal biopsies showed impaired ability to induce IL-8 in response to O42 and LGG. Control colonic tissue showed a limited response to O42 or B. theta and LGG significantly reduced IL-8 secretion. Unlike control tissue, however, Crohn's ileal and colonic tissue did respond to B. theta, with more enhanced expression in the colon. CONCLUSIONS: We provide the first ex vivo data to support the notion that aberrant mucosal recognition of commensal bacteria may contribute to pediatric CD. While IL-8 responses to O42 and LGG varied with disease status and anatomical location, B. theta consistently induced significant IL-8 both in ileal and colonic CD tissue, which was not seen in control, healthy tissue.},

   abstract = {The incidence of inflammatory bowel disease (IBD; Crohn's disease, ulcerative colitis) is highest during the peak reproductive years, hence the increased concern with the safety of IBD drugs during pregnancy. Over the past 11 years, anti-TNF-alpha antibody therapy has emerged as a treatment approach for refractory IBD patients who have failed to achieve or maintain remission with corticosteroids and immunomodulator agents. The TNF-alpha inhibitors (anti-TNFs; infliximab, adalimumab, certolizumab pegol) have proven successful in inducing and maintaining remission of moderate-to-severe IBD, but recommendations for the use of these compounds during pregnancy have lacked consensus. Balanced against the potential risk of these drugs on the fetus is the well-established fact that high disease activity has been found to poorly affect pregnancy outcomes in IBD, and the potential use of anti-TNF agents may control disease flare and severity during pregnancy. Concerns regarding the effect of anti-TNFs on the pregnancy and fetus have been assuaged by registry data which has demonstrated an overall positive safety record. Both the U.S. Food and Drug Administration and the European Crohn's and Colitis Organization categorize anti-TNF agents as safe during pregnancy. New knowledge regarding the physiologic timing of placental transfer of therapeutic antibody subclasses and pegylated antibody fragments from the mother into the fetus has also helped to allay concerns. This review will examine the present state of knowledge regarding the use of anti-TNFs in pregnant women with IBD.},

   abstract = {INTRODUCTION: Combined medullar sclerosis, together with peripheral sensory neuropathies, is the most common neurological manifestation observed in cobalamin deficiency. Biermer's disease is the predominant cause. Other clinical and etiological aspects are nevertheless frequent, although underestimated. METHODS: This retrospective study included patients with neurological symptoms and cobalamin (B12 vitamin) deficiency confirmed by laboratory tests collected over a period of 11 years. RESULTS: Twenty-seven cases were analyzed. Mean age was 47 years and there were 11 women and 16 men. Distribution of the neurological syndromes was: combined medullar sclerosis in 18 patients (67%), sensory neuropathies in 30% of cases and sensory-motor neuropathies in 15%. One patient had fronto-subcortical dementia with good improvement after vitamin replacement. In addition, autonomic dysfunction was noted in six patients (orthostatic symptomatic hypotension and/or urinary dysfunction and/or erectile failure). Dysautonomia revealed cobalamin deficiency in three patients with a good and fast response to the cobalamin therapy in all cases. Biermer's disease was diagnosed in 17 patients (63%) and a likely syndrome of nondissociation of cobalamin in two patients. One patient had Crohn's disease and no etiology was found in seven patients. In five patients (19%), nitrous oxide undoubtedly induced decompensation of latent cobalamin deficiency; four after a general anesthesia and one by chronic professional exposure. Outcome was very good in 46% of patients after vitamin replacement, particularly if treatment was started rapidly. DISCUSSION: The findings in this series highlight the frequency of autonomic dysfunction sometimes revealing cobalamin deficiency with a fast and good response to vitamin replacement and the frequency of neurological disorders following decompensation triggered by general anesthesia using nitrous oxide in patients with latent cobalamin deficiency.},

   abstract = {Although a causal link between Mycobacterium avium subspecies paratuberculosis (MAP) and Crohn's disease has not been proved, previous studies suggest that the potential routes of human exposure to MAP should be investigated. We conducted a systematic review of literature concerning the likelihood of contamination of food products with MAP and the likely changes in the quantity of MAP in dairy and meat products along their respective production chains. Relevant data were extracted from 65 research papers and synthesized qualitatively. Although estimates of the prevalence of Johne's disease are scarce, particularly for non-dairy herds, the available data suggest that the likelihood of contamination of raw milk with MAP in most studied regions is substantial. The presence of MAP in raw and pasteurized milk has been the subject of several studies which show that pasteurized milk is not always MAP-free and that the effectiveness of pasteurization in inactivating MAP depends on the initial concentration of the agent in raw milk. The most recent studies indicated that beef can be contaminated with MAP via dissemination of the pathogen in the tissues of infected animals. Currently available data suggests that the likelihood of dairy and meat products being contaminated with MAP on retail sale should not be ignored.},

   abstract = {Inflammatory bowel disease (IBD) is a major source of morbidity in children and adults. Its incidence is rising, particularly in young people. IBD carries a lifelong risk of cancer, which is proportional to disease duration. Drug and surgical treatments rarely offer cure and often carry a high side effect burden. Dietary therapy is highly effective in Crohn's disease. For these reasons, there is much interest in developing novel dietary treatments in IBD. Curcumin, a component of the spice turmeric, and an anti-inflammatory and anti-cancer agent, shows preclinical and clinical potential in IBD. Its mechanisms of action are unknown. Our aim was to assess the effect of curcumin on key disease mediators p38 mitogen-activated protein kinase (MAPK), IL-1beta, IL-10 and matrix metalloproteinase-3 (MMP-3) in the gut of children and adults with IBD. Colonic mucosal biopsies and colonic myofibroblasts (CMF) from children and adults with active IBD were cultured ex vivo with curcumin. p38 MAPK, NF-kappaB and MMP-3 were measured by immunoblotting. IL-1beta and IL-10 were measured by ELISA. We show reduced p38 MAPK activation in curcumin-treated mucosal biopsies, enhanced IL-10 and reduced IL-1beta. We demonstrate dose-dependent suppression of MMP-3 in CMF with curcumin. We conclude that curcumin, a naturally occurring food substance with no known human toxicity, holds promise as a novel therapy in IBD.},

This study aimed to determine the presence of Map in milk samples from seropositive goats and cows and bulk tank milk samples from herds previously designated Map-infected using indirect enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay. Map DNA was detected in 100% of the bulk tank milk samples of 14 bovine herds and 3 caprine flocks using a modified insertion sequence 900 polymerase chain reaction (PCR). Additionally, Map DNA was detected in 100% of the individual milk samples from 10 cows and 8 goats. Further, based on the findings of the experimental insertion sequence 900 PCR assessment, evaluation of bulk tank and individual milk samples through a type-specific PCR was performed, which confirmed our previous findings and revealed that 56.25% cow and 63.63% goat milk had concurrent infections of the C, I, and S types. Out of 14 bulk tank milk samples, 10 had viable mycobacteria. Paratuberculosis was detected at a high frequency in cow and goat milk, which suggests that raw milk ingestion represents a potential risk of Map infection.},

   abstract = {The Inflammatory bowel diseases, Crohn's disease and ulcerative colitis, are debilitating conditions, characterised by lifelong sensitivity to certain foods, and often a need for surgery and life-long medication. The anti-inflammatory effects of long chain omega-3 polyunsaturated acids justify their inclusion in enteral nutrition formulas that have been associated with disease remission. However, there have been variable data in clinical trials to test supplementary omega-3 polyunsaturated fatty acids in inducing or maintaining remission in these diseases. Although variability in trial design has been suggested as a major factor, we suggest that variability in processing and presentation of the products may be equally or more important. The nature of the source, and rapidity of getting the fish or other food source to processing or to market, will affect the percentage of the various fatty acids, possible presence of heavy metal contaminants and oxidation status of the various fatty acids. For dietary supplements or fortified foods, whether the product is encapsulated or not, whether storage is under nitrogen or not, and length of time between harvest, processing and marketing will again profoundly affect the properties of the final product. Clinical trials to test efficacy of these products in IBD to date have utilised the relevant skills of pharmacology and gastroenterology. We suggest that knowledge from food science, nutrition and engineering will be essential to establish the true role of this important group of compounds in these diseases.},

   abstract = {BACKGROUND & AIMS: Crohn's disease (CD) is a multifactorial disease where resistance to apoptosis is one major defect. Also, dietary fat intake has been shown to modulate disease activity. We aimed to explore the interaction between four single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) in apoptotic genes and dietary fat intake in modulating disease activity in CD patients. METHODS: Polymerase Chain Reaction (PCR) and Restriction Fragment Length Polymorphism (RFLP) techniques were used to analyze Caspase9+93C/T, FasLigand-843C/T, Peroxisome Proliferator-Activated Receptor gamma+161C/T and Peroxisome Proliferator-Activated Receptor gamma Pro12Ala SNPs in 99 patients with CD and 116 healthy controls. Interactions between SNPs and fat intake in modulating disease activity were analyzed using regression analysis. RESULTS: None of the polymorphisms analyzed influenced disease susceptibility and/or activity, but a high intake of total, saturated and monounsaturated fats and a higher ratio of n-6/n-3 polyunsaturated fatty acids(PUFA), was associated with a more active phenotype (p < 0.05). We observed that the detrimental effect of a high intake of total and trans fat was more marked in wild type carriers of the Caspase9+93C/T polymorphism [O.R(95%CI) 4.64(1.27-16.89) and O.R(95%CI) 4.84(1.34-17.50)]. In the Peroxisome Proliferator-Activated Receptor gamma Pro12Ala SNP, we also observed that a high intake of saturated and monounsaturated fat was associated to a more active disease in wild type carriers [OR(95%CI) 4.21(1.33-13.26) and 4.37(1.52-12.51)]. Finally, a high intake of n-6 PUFA was associated with a more active disease in wild type carriers for the FasLigand-843C/T polymorphism [O.R(95%CI) 5.15(1.07-24.74)]. CONCLUSIONS: To our knowledge, this is the first study to disclose a synergism between fat intake and SNPs in apoptotic genes in modulating disease activity in CD patients.},

Despite their still unknown aetiologies, some pathogenic mechanisms have been elucidated after the recent discovery of numerous susceptibility genes and rare environmental factors. These diseases have a course consisting of episodes of flare-up alternating with periods of remission. Medical treatment for induction of a remission comprises besides aminosalicylates, corticosteroids including budesonide and immunosuppressive drugs, anti-TNF-alpha drugs (infliximab, adalimumab) indicated in case of failure of previous therapies. Surgery is indicated for complications and failure of medical treatment.With current therapy, most of the patients are able to fulfil their familial, social and professional projects.},

   abstract = {Allele variants in the L-carnitine (LCAR) transporters OCTN1 (SLC22A4, 1672 C --> T) and OCTN2 (SLC22A5, -207 G --> C) have been implicated in susceptibility to Crohn's disease (CD). LCAR is consumed in the diet and transported actively from the intestinal lumen via the organic cation transporter OCTN2. While recognized mainly for its role in fatty acid metabolism, several lines of evidence suggest that LCAR may also display immunosuppressive properties. This study sought to investigate the immunomodulatory capacity of LCAR on antigen-presenting cell (APC) and CD4+ T cell function by examining cytokine production and the expression of activation markers in LCAR-supplemented and deficient cell culture systems. The therapeutic efficacy of its systemic administration was then evaluated during the establishment of colonic inflammation in vivo. LCAR treatment significantly inhibited both APC and CD4+ T cell function, as assessed by the expression of classical activation markers, proliferation and cytokine production. Carnitine deficiency resulted in the hyperactivation of CD4+ T cells and enhanced cytokine production. In vivo, protection from trinitrobenzene sulphonic acid colitis was observed in LCAR-treated mice and was attributed to the abrogation of both innate [interleukin (IL)-1beta and IL-6 production] and adaptive (T cell proliferation in draining lymph nodes) immune responses. LCAR therapy may therefore represent a novel alternative therapeutic strategy and highlights the role of diet in CD.},

Given the ability of the immune response to rapidly counter infectious agents, it is striking that such a large density of microbes can exist in a state of synergy within the human host. This is particularly true of the distal gastrointestinal (GI) tract, which houses up to 1000 distinct bacterial species and an estimated excess of 1 x 10(14) microorganisms. An ever-increasing body of evidence implicates the GI microbiota in defining states of health and disease. Here, we review the literature in adult and pediatric GI microbiome studies, the emerging links between microbial community structure, function, infection and disease, and the approaches to manipulate this crucial ecosystem to improve host health.},

In the present study, fluorescence ratio imaging microscopy (FRIM) was used to assess changes in intracellular pH (pH(i)) of one strain of MAP after exposure to nisin and neutralized cell-free supernatants (NCSs) from five bacteriocin-producing lactic acid bacteria (LAB) with known probiotic properties. The evaluation of pH(i) by FRIM provides information about the physiological state of bacterial cells, bypassing the long and problematic incubations needed for methods relying upon growth of MAP such as determination of colony forming units. The FRIM results showed that both nisin and the cell-free supernatant from Lactobacillus plantarum PCA 236 affected the pH(i) of MAP within a few hours. However, monitoring the population for 24h revealed the presence of a subpopulation of cells probably resistant to the antimicrobial compounds tested. Use of nisin and bacteriocin-producing LAB strains could lead to new intervention strategies for the control of MAP based on in vivo application of probiotic cultures as feed additives at farm level.},

   abstract = {Mycobacterium avium subsp. paratuberculosis (MAP) is the etiologic agent of Johne's disease in cattle and other farm ruminants, and is also a suspected pathogen of Crohn's disease in humans. Development of diagnostic methods for MAP infection has been a challenge over the last few decades. The objective of this study was to investigate the relationship between different methods for detection of MAP in milk and fecal samples. A total of 134 milk samples and 110 feces samples were collected from 146 individual cows in 14 MAP-infected herds in southwestern Ontario. Culture, IS900 polymerase chain reaction (PCR) and nested PCR methods were used for detecting MAP in milk; results were compared with those of fecal culture. A significant relationship was found between milk culture, direct PCR, and nested PCR (P < 0.05). The fecal culture results were not related to any of the 3 assay methods used for the milk samples (P > 0.10). Although fecal culture showed a higher sensitivity than the milk culture method, the difference was not significant (P = 0.2473). The number of MAP colony-forming units (CFU) isolated by culture from fecal samples was, on average, higher than that isolated from milk samples (P = 0.0083). There was no significant correlation between the number of CFU cultured from milk and from feces (Pearson correlation coefficient = 0.1957, N = 63, P = 0.1243). The animals with high numbers of CFU in milk culture may not be detected by fecal culture at all, and vise versa. A significant proportion (29% to 41%) of the positive animals would be missed if only 1 culture method, instead of both milk and feces, were to be used for diagnosis. This suggests that the shedding of MAP in feces and milk is not synchronized. Most of the infected cows were low-level shedders. The proportion of low-level shedders may even be underestimated because MAP is killed during decontamination, thus reducing the chance of detection. Therefore, to identify suspected Johne's-infected animals using the tests in this study, both milk and feces samples should be collected in duplicate to enhance the diagnostic rate. The high MAP kill rate identified in the culture methods during decontamination may be compensated for by using the nested PCR method, which had a higher sensitivity than the IS900 PCR method used.},

The US Food and Drug Administration approved the first of the biologics (infliximab) in 1998 and approved 9 additional agents since that time for treating various rheumatic conditions and plaque psoriasis: etanercept (1998), anakinra (2001), adalimumab (2002), alefacept (2003), efalizumab (2003), abatacept (2005), rituximab (2006), natalizumab (2008), and certolizumab pegol (2008).

The skin is commonly involved and is often one of the first organs affected in nutritional deficiency, providing a key to the diagnosis. This article will review the most common nutritional deficiencies causing a periorificial and/or acrodermatitis: zinc deficiency, biotin deficiency, kwashiorkor, and essential fatty acid deficiency. RECENT FINDINGS: Whereas older literature has focused on the relationship among nutritional deficiency, malnutrition and poverty, recent research has identified additional patient populations that are at risk for developing nutritional deficiencies. These populations include premature infants, patients with long-term total parenteral nutrition, Crohn's disease, cystic fibrosis, intestinal bypass procedures, chronic alcoholics, anorexia nervosa, and restrictive diets. Recent studies have also focused on further understanding the genetic basis of inherited nutritional deficiencies such as acrodermatitis enteropathica. SUMMARY: Skin manifestations can lead a provider to the diagnosis of a nutritional deficiency. In a child with a periorificial or acral dermatitis, the diagnosis of zinc, biotin, protein, or essential fatty acid deficiency should be considered, especially if accompanied by systemic signs of failure to thrive.},

   abstract = {BACKGROUND: The pathophysiological mechanisms that generate chronic inflammatory lesions in inflammatory bowel disease (IBD) have, at least in part, been unveiled. Abnormal communication between gut microbial communities and the mucosal immune system is being incriminated as the core defect leading to intestinal injury in genetically susceptible individuals. The therapeutic manipulation of gut microecology has attracted high expectation as a strategic area for the control and prevention of IBD. METHOD: Literature review. RESULTS: The gut is the major site for induction of regulatory T cells, which secrete immunoregulatory cytokines such as IL-10 and TGF-beta and can regulate both Th1 and Th2 responses. Recent findings suggest that some gut commensals, including lactobacilli, bifidobacteria and helminths, play a major role in the induction of regulatory T cells in gut lymphoid follicles. Such T cell-mediated regulatory pathways are essential homeostatic mechanisms by which the host can tolerate the massive burden of innocuous antigens within the gut without responding through inflammation. In clinical practice, the evidence for the use of probiotics or prebiotics is strongest in the case of pouchitis. In addition, one probiotic strain appears to be equivalent to mesalazine in maintaining remission of ulcerative colitis. However, studies of probiotics in Crohn's disease have been disappointing. CONCLUSIONS: Further research is needed to optimize the use of probiotics, prebiotics or helminths for these indications.},

   abstract = {OBJECTIVES: The aim of this work was to study the interaction between genetic polymorphisms (single-nucleotide polymorphisms, SNPs) of pro- and anti-inflammatory cytokines and fat intake on the risk of developing Crohn's disease (CD) or modifying disease activity. METHODS: Seven SNPs in interleukin 1 (IL1), tumor necrosis factor alpha (TNFalpha), lymphotoxin alpha (LTalpha), and IL6 genes were analyzed in 116 controls and 99 patients with CD. The type of fat intake was evaluated, and the interaction between SNPs and dietary fat in modulating disease activity was analyzed. RESULTS: Individuals who were homozygous for the IL6-174G/C polymorphism had a six-fold higher risk for CD (odds ratio (OR)=6.1; 95% confidence interval (95% CI)=1.9-19.4), whereas the TT genotype on the TNFalpha-857C/T polymorphism was associated with more active disease (OR=10.4; 95% CI=1.1-94.1). A high intake of total, saturated, and monounsaturated fats, as well as a higher ratio of n-6/n-3 polyunsaturated fatty acid (PUFA), was associated with a more active phenotype (P<0.05). Furthermore, there was an interaction between dietary fat intake and SNPs, with a high intake of saturated and monounsaturated fats being associated with active disease, mainly in patients carrying the variant alleles of the 857 TNFalpha polymorphism (OR=6.0, 95% CI=1.4-26.2; OR=5.17; 95% CI=1.4-19.2, respectively) and the 174 IL6 polymorphism (OR=2.95; 95% CI=1.0-9.1; OR=3.21; 95% CI=1.0-10.4, respectively). Finally, low intake of n-3 PUFA and high n-6/n-3 PUFA ratio in patients with the TNFalpha 857 polymorphism were associated with higher disease activity (OR=3.6; 95% CI=1.0-13.0; OR=5.92; 95% CI=1.3-26.5, respectively). CONCLUSIONS: These results show that different types of fat may interact with cytokine genotype, modulating disease activity.},

   abstract = {BACKGROUND: Gastroduodenal and small intestinal permeability are increased in patients with Crohn's disease (CD) and intensive care patients. The relevance of colonic permeability has not yet been adequately investigated. The aim of this study was to investigate the clinical value of sucralose excretion as indicator for colonic permeability in these patient groups. DESIGN: After oral administration of four sugars and subsequent analysis of urinary excretion, gastroduodenal and intestinal permeability were calculated from saccharose excretion and lactulose/mannitol (L/M) ratio over 5 h, and sucralose excretion from 5 to 26 h in 100 healthy controls, 29 CD and 35 patients after coronary surgery (CABG). RESULTS: In controls, sucralose excretion was highly variable (0.67+/-0.92%) and not related to small intestinal permeability. In CD and CABG, L/M ratio was increased (0.054+/-0.060; 0.323+/-0.253 vs. 0.018+/-0.001 in controls). Sucralose excretion was increased in 77% of CABG but only in 7% of CD. There was an association between gastroduodenal and intestinal permeability in CD and CABG (r=0.72, and r=0.51), but sucralose excretion was not related to either one of these two parameters. Other than a weak association between sucralose and length of stay in intensive care in CABG patients (P=0.099), sucralose excretion was not related to clinical outcome. CONCLUSIONS: The proposed cut-off for normal sucralose excretion is 2.11%, but its high variability and lack of association to gastrointestinal permeability or clinical outcome leave it open, if it can provide information beyond established permeability tests.},

Selected probiotics strains have been proven to be clinically effective in maintaining remission in patients with ulcerative colitis. None of the probiotics thus far tested has been shown to be effective in induction of remission or in maintenance of remission in patients with Crohn's disease. The multispecies probiotics mixture of 8 strains seems effective in the maintenance of remission in pouchitis. Irritable bowel syndrome is a functional bowel disorder manifested by chronic, recurring abdominal pain or discomfort associated with disturbed bowel habit in the absence of structural abnormalities likely to account for these symptoms. Recently conducted appropriately powered studies with different (combinations of) probiotics show positive results on reduction of symptoms, although a considerable placebo effect is also found. Mechanistic studies aimed at pathophysiological mechanisms of inflammatory bowel diseases can identify new targets for probiotic bacteria.},

Inflammatory bowel diseases (IBD) patients have many vitamin and nutrient deficiencies which can lead to important consequences such as hyperhomocysteinemia which is associated with a higher risk of thromboembolic disease. Nutritional deficiencies in IBD patients are the result of insufficient intake, malabsorption and protein-losing enteropathy as well as the metabolic distubances directly induced by the chronic disease and its treatments, in particular corticosteroids. Screening for nutritional deficiencies in chronic disease patients is warranted. Managing the deficiencies involves simple nutritional guidelines, vitamin supplements, and nutritional support in the worst cases, in particular in children in order to limit the impact of IBD on growth. In active CD, enteral nutrition is the first line therapy in children and should be used as sole therapy in adults mainly when treatment with corticosteroids is not feasible.},

   abstract = {BACKGROUND: The use of complementary and alternative medicine in inflammatory bowel disease (IBD) has been extensively studied. However, the use of probiotics and prebiotics is poorly documented, despite evidence of efficacy of particular probiotic strains in specific forms of IBD. METHODS: A case-control study comprising interviewer-administered questionnaires was conducted in IBD patients and healthy controls. Data regarding use and knowledge of probiotics and prebiotics, demographic, and clinical information were collected. RESULTS: In total, 334 participants (234 IBD, 100 controls) were interviewed. Significantly more IBD patients than controls had ever used probiotics to manage their health (Crohn's disease [CD] 43%, ulcerative colitis [UC] 51%, controls 21%, P < 0.001). Prebiotic use was negligible. On logistic regression analysis, having UC (odds ratio [OR] 4.30, 95% confidence interval [CI] 2.27-8.12) or CD (OR 3.05, 95% CI 1.66-5.60) were the strongest predictors of probiotic use. Within IBD patients the strongest predictor of probiotic use was current steroid use (OR 2.4, 95% CI 1.11-5.18). IBD patients had greater probiotic knowledge scores than controls (P = 0.003), although 20% of IBD probiotic users could not provide a definition of a probiotic. Less than half of IBD probiotic users discussed probiotic use with healthcare professionals, with commercial advertising being the primary source of information. CONCLUSIONS: Patients with IBD use probiotics to manage their health but frequently choose strains without evidence of efficacy in IBD. Patients rely on nonclinical sources of information and often do not disclose probiotic use to healthcare professionals. Conventional healthcare providers should inquire about probiotic use among their patients and offer evidence-based advice.},

   abstract = {In inflammatory bowel disease (IBD), epithelial barrier function is impaired contributing to diarrhea by a leak flux mechanism and perpetuating inflammation by an increased luminal antigen uptake. This barrier of the intestinal epithelium is composed of the apical enterocyte membrane and the epithelial tight junction (TJ) and can be affected by TJ alterations, induction of epithelial apoptosis and appearance of gross lesions like erosions or ulcers as well as by accelerated transcytotic antigen uptake. TJ strands are reduced in Crohn's disease (CD) and strand breaks appear. Several of the 24 claudins are concerned in CD as e.g. claudin-2, -5 and -8. The epithelial apoptotic rate has also been shown to be elevated causing focal lesions. As far as regulation is concerned, Th1 cytokines like TNF-alpha and interferon-gamma are important for CD, while Th2 responses are dominated by interleukin (IL)-13 and TNF-alpha in ulcerative colitis (UC). IL-13 does stimulate epithelial apoptosis as well as upregulates claudin-2 in UC. Together with an IL-13-dependent restitution arrest, this may explain why ulcer lesions are seen already early in UC but only in advanced stages of CD. Luminal antigen uptake occurs via TJ discontinuities, epithelial gross lesions and endocytotically. Therapeutically, anti-inflammatory remedies as e.g. TNF-alpha antibodies are most effective in improving active IBD and in parallel repairing barrier function. Again, this is assumed to be due to reduced cytokine release in active IBD, as a result of immune cell apoptosis. However, other agents can also directly affect barrier function. Glutamine is discussed as a candidate for barrier therapy but has never been shown to have a direct barrier influence in CD, although it is an important metabolic fuel for enterocytes and has been shown to preserve barrier functions in laboratory models. Also, probiotics and TGF-beta and have beneficial effects in models, but no data exist on barrier repair in IBD. In contrast, zinc has been shown to improve barrier function in CD, although the inherent mechanisms are unknown. Finally, food components can strengthen the epithelial barrier as for example the flavonoid quercetin which has been shown to upregulate claudin-4 within the epithelial TJ.},

   abstract = {BACKGROUND: Folate is postulated to protect against cell injury and long-term risk of cancer. Folate deficiency has been shown to be associated with inflammatory bowel disease (IBD). However, folate concentrations are poorly delineated in children with IBD. OBJECTIVE: The objective was to compare folate concentrations between children with newly diagnosed IBD and healthy controls. DESIGN: Red blood cell folate (RBCF) and whole-blood folate (WBF) concentrations were measured in 78 children (mean age: 12.8 +/- 2.7 y): 22 patients with newly diagnosed untreated Crohn disease, 11 patients with ulcerative colitis, 4 patients with indeterminate colitis, and 41 controls. Vitamin supplementation and dietary intakes determined by food-frequency questionnaire were recorded for 20 IBD patients and 28 controls. RESULTS: RBCF concentrations were 19.4% lower in controls (587.0 +/- 148.6 ng/mL) than in patients (728.7 +/- 185.8 ng/mL; P = 0.0004), and WBF concentrations were 11.1% lower in controls (218.2 +/- 49.7 ng/mL) than in patients (245.3 +/- 59.1 ng/mL; P = 0.031). Total folate intake was 18.8% higher in controls (444.7 +/- 266.7 microg/d) than in IBD patients (361.1 +/- 230.6 microg/d), but this difference was not statistically significant (P = 0.264). Folate intakes were below the Recommended Dietary Allowance (200-400 microg/d), adjusted for age and sex, in 35.4% of study subjects. CONCLUSIONS: In contrast with previous evidence of folate deficiency in adult IBD patients, our data indicate higher folate concentrations in children with newly diagnosed untreated IBD than in controls. This finding was unexpected, especially in light of the higher dietary folate intakes and hematocrit values in children without IBD. The influence of IBD therapy on folate metabolism and the long-term clinical implications of high RBCF and WBF concentrations at the time of IBD diagnosis should be explored further.},

   abstract = {BACKGROUND & AIMS: The spreading of gastrointestinal diseases is growing all over the world. Although for some of them an effective therapeutic approach has been found, palliation rather than cure is very frequent due to a partial knowledge of their aetiology and pathogenesis. This review, analyzing the main clinical studies, aims at being a state of the art update of the use of probiotic formulations in daily practice. METHODS: In this review we include all the most significant clinical trials involving the use of probiotic formulations for the treatment of several pathologies. RESULTS: Dysbiosis has been observed in irritable bowel syndrome patients. Probiotics may exert a beneficial effect on Crohn's disease affected patients who have shown gut microbiota antigens and altered wall permeability. Moreover some probiotic formulations seem to enhance the therapy for Helicobacter Pylori reducing its pathogenic potential. Intestinal ecology imbalance has been also linked to cancer induction, allergy, skin and urogenital diseases. In addition probiotics administration seems to be particularly useful to ease post-operative complications. CONCLUSION: Further future clinical trials, involving large numbers of patients, will be mandatory to achieve definite evidence of the preventive and curative role of probiotics in medical practice.},

   abstract = {Johne disease is ruminant chronic granulomatous enteritis caused by Mycobacterium avium subsp. paratuberculosis (MAP). The domestic animals infected with this pathogen present severe weight loss due to chronic diarrhea and a reduction in lactation yield. These result in enormous economic loss since the affected animals are subsequently subject to artificial selections and disinfection of the environment are absolutely necessary. Furthermore, MAP has been suspected to have pathological relationship to Crohn's disease, human chronic granulomatous enteritis. The bacterium grows slower on solid culture and its colony becomes visible after two months of culture. In Japan, there has been almost no investigation on pasteurization temperature of commercial milk using MAP. It comes from the fact that the growth rate of MAP is very slow and that MAP is a related species to Mycobacterium tuberculosis, which pasteurization condition has been well defined. The studies on the pasteurization conditions of commercial milk have been mainly targeted to reduce the risk of infection to Coxiella and Mycobacterium tuberculosis. However, there has been a concern about the possibility that MAP is remained in pasteurized milk because MAPs form an aggregate and the bacterium at its center may not receive enough heat to get pasteurized. From these reasons, the present study aims to investigate validity of the current pasteurization conditions of commercial milk by implementing experimental pasteurization at various pasteurization temperatures using milk experimentally infected with MAP, and to clarify if MAP is eliminated at these temperatures in order to achieve smooth enforcement of the current ministry order. We conducted plant pasteurization experiment at four pasteurization conditions (high temperature, short time (HTST); 82, 77, 72 degrees C for 15 seconds and low temperature, long time (LTLT); 63 degrees C for 30 minutes) using two MAP strains, ATCC19698 and OKY-20. In conclusion, there appeared no colony of the two MAP strains formed from the milk pasteurized at the four pasteurization conditions examined.},

   abstract = {INTRODUCTION: The pharmacokinetics and safety of Asacol (Tillotts Pharma AG, Ziefen, Switzerland), which has been used worldwide to treat ulcerative colitis and Crohn's disease, were studied in Japanese healthy male volunteers. METHODS: Drug plasma concentrations and urinary and fecal excretions after a single dose (400-4800 mg) and multiple doses (3600 mg/day for 7 days) were investigated. RESULTS: All adverse events were "not serious." The peak plasma concentration (C max) was reached at 12.3-18.0 hours after a single dose, and the C max and area under the plasma concentration-time curve (AUC) of mesalazine and its N-acetyl metabolite were proportional to the doses. The C max and AUC in non-Japanese subjects reported in the literature were closely correlated to findings in Japanese subjects, and external excretions were also similar in the Japanese and non-Japanese subjects. CONCLUSIONS: Asacol was safe and well tolerated in this Japanese population, and the non-Japanese clinical data could be extrapolated to the Japanese population.},

   abstract = {Reports that bacteria within the Firmicutes phylum, especially the species Faecalibacterium prausnitzii, are less abundant in Crohn's disease (CD) patients and supernatants from cultures of this bacterium are anti-inflammatory prompted the investigation of the possible correlations between the abundance of F. prausnitzii and the response to treatment in patients with gut diseases and healthy controls. In a randomized, double-blind trial, faeces were collected from healthy volunteers, and from patients with active CD, ulcerative colitis (UC) and irritable bowel syndrome before and after treatment. The levels of F. prausnitzii DNA in faecal suspensions were determined by PCR. Treatment by an elemental diet was effective, resulting in decreases in both the Harvey and Bradshaw index (P<0.001) and the concentrations of serum C-reactive protein (P<0.05). The total levels of F. prausnitzii in faecal samples from CD patients at presentation were lower than those in the other groups both before and after the treatment. There was no correlation between F. prausnitzii abundance and the severity of CD before treatment. Clinical improvement unexpectedly correlated with a significant decrease in the abundance of F. prausnitzii, especially the A2-165 subgroup (P<0.05). Our data suggest that a paucity of F. prausnitzii in the gastrointestinal microbial communities is likely to be a minor aetiological factor in CD: recovery following elemental diet is attributed to lower levels of gut flora.},

   abstract = {BACKGROUND: Vitamin D has immune-regulatory functions in experimental colitis, and low vitamin D levels are present in Crohn's disease. AIM: To assess the effectiveness of vitamin D3 treatment in Crohn's disease with regard to improved disease course. METHODS: We performed a randomized double-blind placebo-controlled trial to assess the benefits of oral vitamin D3 treatment in Crohn's disease. We included 108 patients with Crohn's disease in remission, of which fourteen were excluded later. Patients were randomized to receive either 1200 IU vitamin D3 (n = 46) or placebo (n = 48) once daily during 12 months. The primary endpoint was clinical relapse. RESULTS: Oral vitamin D3 treatment with 1200 IU daily increased serum 25OHD from mean 69 nmol/L [standard deviation (s.d.) 31 nmol/L] to mean 96 nmol/L (s.d. 27 nmol/L) after 3 months (P < 0.001). The relapse rate was lower among patients treated with vitamin D3 (6/46 or 13%) than among patients treated with placebo (14/48 or 29%), (P = 0.06). CONCLUSIONS: Oral supplementation with 1200 IE vitamin D3 significantly increased serum vitamin D levels and insignificantly reduced the risk of relapse from 29% to 13%, (P = 0.06). Given that vitamin D3 treatment might be effective in Crohn's disease, we suggest larger studies to elucidate this matter further. ClinicalTrial.gov(NCT00122184).},

   abstract = {Crohn's disease (CD) is a well known chronic pathological condition whose aetiology has remained unrecognized for nearly a century. Complex immune mechanisms in a specific genetic background causing an abnormal local inflammatory response are thought to be directly responsible for the clinical picture, but no external factor triggering such host responses has been identified. Humans lose the capability of breaking down milk lactose early in life and, afterwards, ingestion of large amounts of lactose causes a transient digestive illness known as lactose intolerance. Some human populations developed mutations for lactase persistence in adulthood that allowed better exploiting a product, milk, from not food-competitive domesticated species. This adaptation to dairy farming could have had as a collateral effect the exposure of human populations to a ruminant parasite with the ability to cause chronic inflammation in the intestine. Humans with a genetic susceptibility might develop a similar inflammatory disease caused by a defect in a highly conserved innate immunity mechanism. Data from different published sources regarding by country CD and type I diabetes incidence, lactose intolerance, livestock population, food production, Gross National Income and human population were submitted to Pearson and Kendall correlation, multiple regression and principal components analyses. Multiple regressions were also applied to a published 20-year time series for CD incidence in Japan. These analyses showed a strong association between country incidence of CD and frequency of lactase persistence as well as other ruminant production and consumption variables that further supports the meaning of those observations. Association of these variables with higher per capita income suggests that IBD incidence would be a side-effect of an otherwise highly successful adaptation. The evolutionarily plausible framework provided by this association with the species suffering a similar inflammatory bowel disease (IBD), its coincidence with the expanse of a cattle breed that could act as a Trojan horse, in addition to recent microbiological, immunological and therapeutical observations consistent with a slow infection type of pathogenesis, supports a mycobacterial aetiology of human IBD. Further research challenging the hypothesis of a shared aetiology by Mycobacterium avium subsp. paratuberculosis of human and ruminant IBD by increasing research on the pathogenesis of the latter and focusing on effective specific antibiotic or immune aetiological therapies seems to be the obvious next step. Either confirmation or rejection of the hypothesis presented here should create new knowledge that will bring closer the eradication of a cause of human and animal suffering.},

CD PBMC produced more counter-regulatory cytokines with TLR agonists, while UC PBMC produced more IL-1ss and IL-10 with TLR 7/8 agonist than controls. Cytokine production by NFA PBMC did not differ from controls. CD but not UC PBMC produced more IFN-gamma and IL-17 with candida. Aberrant responses to TLR agonists may be associated with increase in IFN-gamma/IL-17 production against candida in CD children.},

   abstract = {Elemental diet (ED) has been used as an enteral nutritional therapy for Crohn's disease. However, the precise mechanisms of ED remain unclear. In interleukin-10 (IL-10)-deficient cell-transferred mice, we investigated the change of intestinal microbiota with ED using molecular terminal-restriction fragment length polymorphism (T-RFLP) analysis and culture method, and evaluated its influence on therapeutic effects of ED. ED significantly suppressed intestinal inflammation. The total amount of bacteria in colitis mice fed the regular diet was higher than in normal mice but decreased in colitis mice fed ED. T-RFLP profiles of the ED group markedly differed from those of the regular diet groups. The diversity of bacterial species in the ED group decreased to 60% of that found in the regular diet groups. Among the cultivated bacteria, the change in lactic acid bacteria composition was remarkable. Lactobacillus reuteri and L. johnsonii decreased and Enterococcus faecalis and E. durans increased in the ED group. The culture supernatant of L. reuteri isolates induced significant tumor necrosis factor-alpha (TNF-alpha) and IL-6 activity in RAW 264 cells, while the culture supernatant of E. faecalis and E. durans barely induced their activity. These data suggested that reduction in amount and diversity of intestinal microbiota and decrease of proinflammatory cytokines via a change in composition of lactic acid bacteria by ED seem to contribute to reduction of bowel inflammation in this model.},

   abstract = {The inflammatory bowel diseases (IBD), Crohn's disease and ulcerative colitis, are T cell-mediated diseases that are characterized by chronic, relapsing inflammation of the intestinal tract. The pathogenesis of IBD involves the complex interaction between the intestinal microflora, host genetic and immune factors, and environmental stimuli. Epidemiological analyses have implicated acute bacterial enteritis as one of the factors that may incite or exacerbate IBD in susceptible individuals. In this review, we examine how interactions between the common enteric pathogen Campylobacter jejuni (C. jejuni), the host intestinal epithelium, and resident intestinal microflora may contribute to the pathogenesis of IBD. Recent experimental evidence indicates that C. jejuni may permit the translocation of normal, noninvasive microflora via novel processes that implicate epithelial lipid rafts. This breach in intestinal barrier function may, in turn, prime the intestine for chronic inflammatory responses in susceptible individuals. Insights into the interactions between enteric pathogens, the host epithelia, and intestinal microflora will improve our understanding of disease processes that may initiate and/or exacerbate intestinal inflammation in patients with IBD and provide impetus for the development of new therapeutic approaches for the treatment of IBD.},

   abstract = {Intestinal APCs are considered critical in maintaining the balance between the response against harmful pathogens and the induction of tolerance to commensal bacteria and food Ags. Recently, several studies indicated the presence of gut-specific APC subsets, which possess both macrophage and dendritic cell (DC) markers. These unique APC subsets play important roles in gut immunity, especially for immune regulation against commensal bacteria. Herein, we examined a unique macrophage subset, which coexpressed the macrophage (Mphi) marker CD14 and the DC marker CD209 in human intestinal lamina propria (LP). The LP Mphi subset in both normal control subjects or Crohn's disease (CD) patients induced proliferation of naive CD4(+) T cells as well as monocyte-derived DCs, and it expressed retinoic acid synthetic enzyme retinaldehyde dehydrogenase 2 and retinol dehydrogenase 10, which induced expression of gut homing receptors on T cells in a retinoic acid-dependent manner. Moreover, the LP Mphi subset strongly evoked differentiation of Th1 cells and slightly induced Th17 cells in both normal control subjects and CD patients; the inducing potential was highest in CD patients. In CD patients, Th17, but not Th1, induction by the LP Mphi subset was enhanced in the presence of commensal bacteria Ags. This enhancement was not observed in normal control subjects. The Th17 induction by the LP Mphi subset was inhibited by neutralization of IL-6 and IL-1beta, but it was enhanced by blockade of retinoic acid signaling. These observations highlight a role for LP Mphi in the enhanced Th1, and potentially in Th17 differentiation, at the inflammatory site of inflammatory bowel diseases.},

   abstract = {It is well established that intestinal microbiota play an important role in the pathogenesis of inflammatory bowel disease (IBD), including ulcerative colitis and Crohn's disease. Various methods of altering the composition of intestinal microbiota have been examined. Recent evidence suggests that the administration of select prebiotics, probiotics and synbiotics may improve the clinical outcome of patients with IBD. In addition, IBD patients are well known to carry a higher risk of developing colorectal cancer due to chronic inflammation. Therefore, probiotics and/or prebiotics may be appropriate treatments for prophylactic use due to their physiologic characteristics and lack of obvious toxicity. This review summarizes the current experimental and clinical knowledge about the role of intestinal microbiota in IBD, the prevention of carcinogenesis related to IBD, and its importance as a target for new forms of neutraceutical therapy.},

   abstract = {GOALS: The objective of this study was to determine whether infliximab, an antitumor necrosis factor monoclonal antibody, is transferred in utero or through breast milk from nursing Crohn's disease patients to their newborns. BACKGROUND: Crohn's disease most often occurs in women of childbearing age. Many of these women receive treatment for their disease, but are advised to terminate therapy while pregnant or nursing. STUDY: Three patients diagnosed with Crohn's disease who had a history of infliximab use during and after pregnancy were followed prospectively. Patients received 5-mg/kg infliximab at regular intervals until approximately gestational week 30, and resumed infliximab treatment within 3 to 14 days after giving birth. Serum samples from patients and children and breast milk samples were collected postpartum. The concentration of infliximab in the serum and milk samples was measured using an enzyme-linked immmunosorbent assay. RESULTS: The levels of infliximab detected in the mothers' serum samples postpartum were 74.27, 62.62, and 59.97 microg/mL, respectively. However, infliximab was undetectable (<0.10 microg/mL) in the sera of the newborn children. Likewise, infliximab was undetectable in the breast milk of the nursing mothers. CONCLUSIONS: Infliximab was detected in the mothers' sera, but not in the breast milk of nursing mothers or in the sera of the breast-fed newborns. Data from this small series of patients suggest that infliximab was not transferred from mother to child, either in utero or through breast milk. These data suggest that mothers receiving infliximab should not be discouraged from nursing their children.},

   abstract = {INTRODUCTION: Nausea and vomiting occur in 40-70% of people with cancer, and are also common in other chronic conditions such as hepatitis C and inflammatory bowel disease. Nausea and vomiting become more common as disease progresses. METHODS AND OUTCOMES: We conducted a systematic review and aimed to answer the following clinical questions: What are the effects of treatments for nausea and vomiting occurring either as a result of the disease or its treatment, in adults with cancer? What are the effects of treatments for nausea and vomiting occurring either as a result of the disease or its treatment, in adults with chronic diseases other than cancer? We searched: Medline, Embase, The Cochrane Library, and other important databases up to April 2008 (Clinical Evidence reviews are updated periodically, please check our website for the most up-to-date version of this review). We included harms alerts from relevant organisations such as the US Food and Drug Administration (FDA) and the UK Medicines and Healthcare products Regulatory Agency (MHRA). RESULTS: We found nine systematic reviews, RCTs, or observational studies that met our inclusion criteria. We performed a GRADE evaluation of the quality of evidence for interventions. CONCLUSIONS: In this systematic review we present information relating to the effectiveness and safety of the following interventions: 5HT(3) antagonists, antihistamines, antimuscarinics, atypical antipsychotics, benzodiazepines, butyrophenones, cannabinoids, corticosteroids, haloperidol, metoclopramide, NK1 antagonists, phenothiazines, prokinetics, 5HT(3) antagonists plus corticosteroids, and venting gastrostomy.},

   abstract = {The effects of adding fiber to the tolerance of a peptide-based formula have not been studied. The objective of this study was to evaluate the tolerance of a peptide-based formula with insoluble and prebiotic fiber in children with compromised gut function. During January 2005 to June 2006, a 6-week randomized, double-blind, cross-over clinical study was conducted to compare stool frequency, stool consistency, and tolerance (abdominal pain, abdominal distension, vomiting, weight gain, and intake) between a formula with or without 3.5 g fructo-oligosaccharides and 3.8 g insoluble fiber/L. Fourteen children with gastrointestinal dysmotility (n=9), Crohn's disease (n=3), or mild short bowel syndrome (n=2) were randomized to receive one of two formulas for 2 weeks followed by a 5-day washout period and then the second diet for another 2 weeks. Means and standard deviations of daily stool frequency and consistency were calculated and compared using intent-to-treat analysis. Linear mixed models were applied to each outcome variable. Stool frequency did not differ by formula. Stool consistency did differ with more soft "mushy" stools (less hard stools) occurring with use of fiber (P<0.001) and more watery stools occurring with control formula (P<0.01). The extremes of stool consistency were normalized with the fiber formula. No significant differences were observed in vomiting, abdominal pain, feeding intakes, or weight gain between the two formulas. This study showed that a peptide-based formula containing fiber was as well-tolerated as a fiber-free formula in a small population of children with gastrointestinal impairments. Longer-term effects of the fiber formula need to be studied.},

This multidisciplinary approach is of great importance in a variety of fields, from enhancement of breakthroughs in biomedical research, to epidemiological studies and public health policy decision-making. We demonstrate the strength embedded in this approach by using three case studies from Israel. We first describe successful scientific collaboration between physicians, veterinarians and microbiologists in two original research projects aimed at unravelling the link between Mycobacterium avium paratuberculosis and Crohn's disease as well as understanding the virulence of enterohaemorrhagic Escherichia coli. Next, fruitful collaboration between veterinarians and physicians led to the development of a post-exposure prophylaxis regime of tick-borne relapsing fever in humans, together with the detection of animal infection by Borrelia persica. We conclude with an example of a joint avian influenza outbreak investigation that demonstrates just how essential collaboration is between veterinarians and physicians from different organisations, not only across professions but also across state and political borders. The benefits gained by applying the 'One Health' concept in these three examples should encourage further collaboration between veterinarians and physicians.},

   abstract = {Interleukin-10 gene-deficient (Il10(-/-)) mice show a hyper-reaction to normal intestinal bacteria and develop spontaneous colitis similar to that of human Crohn's disease when raised under conventional (but not germ-free) conditions. The lack of IL10 protein in these mice leads to changes in intestinal metabolic and signalling processes. The first aim of this study was to identify changes in the bacterial community of the caeca at 7 weeks of age (preclinical colitis) and at 12 weeks of age (when clinical signs of colitis are present), and establish if there were any changes that could be associated with the mouse genotype. We have previously shown that dietary n-3 and n-6 polyunsaturated fatty acids (PUFA) have anti-inflammatory effects and affect colonic gene expression profiles in Il10(-/-) mice; therefore, we also aimed to test the effect of the n-3 PUFA eicosapentaenoic acid (EPA) and the n-6 PUFA arachidonic acid (AA) on the bacterial community of caeca in both Il10(-/-) and C57 mice fed these diets. The lower number of caecal bacteria observed before colitis (7 weeks of age) in Il10(-/-) compared to C57 mice suggests differences in the intestinal bacteria that might be associated with the genotype, and this could contribute to the development of colitis in this mouse model. The number and diversity of caecal bacteria increased after the onset of colitis (12 weeks of age). The increase in caecal Escherichia coli numbers in both inflamed Il10(-/-) and healthy C57 mice might be attributed to the dietary PUFA (especially dietary AA), and thus not be a cause of colitis development. A possible protective effect of E. coli mediated by PUFA supplementation and associated changes in the bacterial environment could be a subject for further investigation to define the mode of action of PUFA in colitis.},

Exclusive enteral nutrition is a therapeutic concept to induce remission in children and adolescents with active Crohn's disease. A new area of nutritional research in pediatrics is potential immunonutrition in critically ill children. Formulae are enriched with single components or a combination of key substrates that might play a crucial role during intermediary metabolism in sepsis, inflammation, tissue healing, and growth. For pharmaconutrition, single components are investigated in a scientific stepwise procedure in order to identify effective disease-dedicated nutrition therapy. Any new formula needs to be evaluated, if possible in comparison to a normal diet or the reference formulation to demonstrate its safety and efficacy (equal or superior to standard formula).},

   abstract = {Vitamin D is the critical hormone for intestinal absorption of calcium. Optimal calcium absorption is important for proper mineralization of bone in the prevention of osteoporosis and osteoporotic fractures, among other important functions. Diseases associated with gut inflammation, such as Crohn's disease (CD), may impair calcium absorption. This pilot study evaluated vitamin D- dependent calcium absorption in subjects with CD. Male subjects with CD (n=4) and healthy age-matched controls (n=5) were studied. All subjects had fractional calcium absorption (FCA; by the dual calcium isotope method), serum 25-hydroxyvitamin D, serum calcium and 24 h urinary calcium excretion measurements at baseline. The FCA in response to vitamin D therapy was re-assessed following administration of oral calcitriol 0.25 mcg twice daily for 1 wk, followed by oral calcitriol 0.50 mcg twice daily for 1 wk. Serum calcium and 24 h urinary calcium determinations were re-assessed after each increasing dose of calcitriol as safety measures. There was no significant difference in calcium FCA at baseline or after increasing doses of calcitriol between the CD and controls. FCA in the control and CD group was approximately 35% at baseline, which increased to 60% after calcitriol therapy. No subject developed hypercalcemia or hypercalciuria. Our results suggest that CD patients have a normal response to vitamin D in enhancing the efficacy of calcium absorption. This suggests that stable CD patients can follow calcium and vitamin D guidelines of non-CD adults. Other factors independent of vitamin D status may impair intestinal calcium absorption in CD, including the degree and location of inflammation, presence of surgical resection and/or use of glucocorticoids.},

   abstract = {SUMMARY: Vitamin K and D deficiency and decreased bone mineral density (BMD) were highly prevalent in patients with inflammatory bowel disease (IBD), especially Crohn's disease (CD). Dietary intakes of these vitamins, however, were above the Japanese adequate intakes in IBD patients, suggesting that malabsorption is the basis for hypovitaminosis K and D and decreased BMD. INTRODUCTION: We have studied the possible involvement of vitamin K and D deficiency in the pathogenesis of decreased BMD in IBD. METHODS: Seventy patients with IBD were evaluated for their BMD; plasma levels of vitamin K; phylloquinone (PK), menaquinone-7 (MK-7), and 25OH-D; serum PTH, protein induced by vitamin K absence (PIVKA-II), and undercarboxylated osteocalcin (ucOC) levels; and their food intake. RESULTS: Compared with ulcerative colitis (UC) patients, CD patients had significantly lower plasma vitamin K and 25OH-D concentrations; significantly higher serum levels of PTH, PIVKA-II, and ucOC; and significantly lower BMD scores at almost all measurement sites. More IBD patients were vitamin K deficient in bone than in liver. Multiple regression analyses revealed that low plasma concentrations of vitamin K and 25OH-D were independent risk factors for low BMD and that they were associated with the patients' fat intake, but not with their intake of these vitamins. CONCLUSION: IBD patients have high prevalence of decreased BMD and vitamin K and D deficiency probably caused by malabsorption of these vitamins.},

   abstract = {The pathogenesis of inflammatory bowel disease (IBD) is only partially understood; various environmental and host (e.g. genetic, epithelial, immune, and nonimmune) factors are involved. The critical role for environmental factors is strongly supported by recent worldwide trends in IBD epidemiology. One important environmental factor is smoking. A meta-analysis partially confirms previous findings that smoking was found to be protective against ulcerative colitis and, after the onset of the disease, might improve its course, decreasing the need for colectomy. In contrast, smoking increases the risk of developing Crohn's disease and aggravates its course. The history of IBD is dotted by cyclic reports on the isolation of specific infectious agents responsible for Crohn's disease or ulcerative colitis. The more recently published cold chain hypothesis is providing an even broader platform by linking dietary factors and microbial agents. An additional, recent theory has suggested a breakdown in the balance between putative species of 'protective' versus 'harmful' intestinal bacteria - this concept has been termed dysbiosis resulting in decreased bacterial diversity. Other factors such as oral contraceptive use, appendectomy, dietary factors (e.g. refined sugar, fat, and fast food), perinatal events, and childhood infections have also been associated with both diseases, but their role is more controversial. Nonetheless, there is no doubt that economic development, leading to improved hygiene and other changes in lifestyle ('westernized lifestyle') may play a role in the increase in IBD. This review article focuses on the role of environmental factors in the pathogenesis and progression of IBDs.},

   abstract = {Abstract Extraintestinal manifestations occur rather frequently in inflammatory bowel disease (IBD), e.g. ulcerative colitis (UC) and Crohn's disease (CD). The present paper provides an overview of the epidemiology, clinical characteristics, diagnostic process, and management of rheumatic, metabolic, dermatologic (mucocutaneous), ophthalmologic, hepatobiliary, hematologic, thromboembolic, urinary tract, pulmonary, and pancreatic extraintestinal manifestations related to IBD. Articles were identified through search of the PubMed and Embase databases, the Cochrane Library, and the web sites of the European Agency for the Evaluation of Medicinal Products (EMEA) and the US Food and Drug Administration (FDA) (cut-off date October 2009). The search terms 'Crohn's disease', 'inflammatory bowel disease', or 'ulcerative colitis' were combined with the terms 'adalimumab', 'anemia', 'arthritis', 'bronchiectasis', 'bronchitis', 'cutaneous manifestations', 'erythema nodosum', 'extraintestinal manifestations', 'hyperhomocysteinemia', 'infliximab', 'iridocyclitis', 'lung disease', 'ocular manifestations', 'osteomalacia', 'pancreatitis', 'primary sclerosing cholangitis', 'renal stones', 'sulfasalazine', 'thromboembolism', and 'treatment'. The search was performed on English-language reviews, practical guidelines, letters, and editorials. Articles were selected based on their relevance, and additional papers were retrieved from their reference lists. Since some of the diseases discussed are uncommon, valid evidence of treatment was difficult to obtain, and epidemiologic data on the rarer forms of extraintestinal manifestations are scarce. However, updates on the pathophysiology and treatment regimens are given for each of these disorders. This paper offers a current review of original research papers and randomized clinical trials, if any, within the field and makes an attempt to point out practical guidelines for the diagnosis and treatment of various extraintestinal manifestations related to IBD.},

Decreasing their levels using antioxidant enzymes, such as catalase (CAT) or superoxide dismutase (SOD) could therefore be useful in the prevention of certain diseases. Lactic acid bacteria (LAB) are ideal candidates to deliver these enzymes in the gut. In this study, the anti-inflammatory effects of CAT or SOD producing LAB were evaluated using a trinitrobenzenesulfonic acid (TNBS) induced Crohn's disease murine model. Engineered Lactobacillus casei BL23 strains producing either CAT or SOD, or the native strain were given to mice before and after intrarectal administration of TNBS. Animal survival, live weight, intestinal morphology and histology, enzymatic activities, microbial translocation to the liver and cytokines released in the intestinal fluid were evaluated. The mice that received CAT or SOD-producing LAB showed a faster recovery of initial weight loss, increased enzymatic activities in the gut and lesser extent of intestinal inflammation compared to animals that received the wild-type strain or those that did not receive bacterial supplementation. Our findings suggest that genetically engineered LAB that produce antioxidant enzymes could be used to prevent or decrease the severity of certain intestinal pathologies.},

The prevalence and incidence of both forms of IBD have historically been higher in developed countries with decreasing North-South gradient. However, more recent evidence demonstrate changing demographics as countries become more developed and immigration increases from underdeveloped countries to developed countries. Typically these changes are marked by an increase in ulcerative colitis followed by an increase in CD. Thus, most if not all human populations appear to be susceptible to IBD under certain environmental influences. Several hypothesis have been advanced to explain these changing demographics including alterations in the bowel microflora, but direct experimental evidence is lacking in most cases. Celiac disease or gluten-sensitive enteropathy is a related inflammatory condition which is induced in susceptible individuals when exposed to gluten-containing foods. Similarly, the prevalence of celiac disease is increasing as the consumption of gluten-containing foods is increasing worldwide.},

   abstract = {A number of studies have been performed examining the influence of various probiotic organisms, either alone or in combination, on immune parameters, infectious outcomes, and inflammatory conditions in humans. Some components of the immune response, including phagocytosis, natural killer cell activity and mucosal immunoglobulin A production (especially in children), can be improved by some probiotic bacteria. Other components, including lymphocyte proliferation, the production of cytokines and of antibodies other than immunoglobulin A appear less sensitive to probiotics. Probiotics, including lactobacilli and bifidobacteria, administered to children can reduce incidence and duration of diarrhoea, but the precise effects depend upon the nature of the condition. Probiotic supplementation can reduce the risk of travellers' diarrhoea in adults, but does not affect duration. The effect of probiotics on other infectious outcomes is less clear. Probiotics may benefit children and adults with irritable bowel syndrome and adults with ulcerative colitis; studies in Crohn's Disease are less clear. Probiotics have little effect in rheumatoid arthritis. Probiotic supplementation, especially with lactobacilli and bifidobacteria, can reduce risk and severity of allergic disease, particular atopic dermatitis; early supplementation appears to be effective. Overall, the picture that emerges from studies of probiotics on immune, infectious and inflammatory outcomes in humans is mixed and there appear to be large species and strain differences in effects seen. Other reasons for differences in effects seen will include dose of probiotic organism used, duration of supplementation, characteristics of the subjects studied, sample size, and technical differences in how the measurements were made.},

Older as well as more recent studies show beneficial effects in experimental colitis and lately also in human inflammatory bowel diseases (IBD), such as Crohn's disease, ulcerative colitis, and chronic pouchitis. In this review we give an overview of the benefits of prebiotics in rodent IBD models and in IBD patients and discuss their possible protective mechanisms. Commensal intestinal bacteria induce and perpetuate chronic intestinal inflammation, whereas others are protective. However, most of the current medications are directed against the exaggerated proinflammatory immune response of the host, some of them toxic and costly. Feeding prebiotics changes the composition of the intestinal microflora toward more protective intestinal bacteria and alters systemic and mucosal immune responses of the host. Therapy for IBD targeting intestinal bacteria and their function is just emerging. Prebiotics have the promise to be relatively safe, inexpensive, and easy to administer. Unraveling their protective mechanisms will help to develop rational applications of prebiotics. However, the initial promising results with dietary prebiotics in preclinical trials as well as small studies in human IBD will need to be confirmed in large randomized controlled clinical trials.},

The aim of this study was to determine the accuracy and agreement of the Fistula Drainage Assessment (FDA), Perianal Disease Activity Index (PDAI), and computer-assisted anal ultrasound imaging (AUS). METHODS: Sixty-two consecutive patients with CD and perianal fistulae underwent clinical, FDA, PDAI, and AUS evaluation. Perianal disease was considered active in the presence of visible fistula drainage and/or signs of local inflammation (induration and pain at digital compression) upon clinical examination. The AUS images were analyzed by calculating the mean gray-scale tone of the lesion. The PDAI and gray-scale tone values discriminating active and inactive perianal disease were defined using receiver operating characteristics statistics. RESULTS: Perianal disease was active in 46 patients. The accuracy of the FDA was 87% (confidence interval [CI]: 76%-94%). A PDAI of >4 and a mean gray-scale tone value of 117 maximized sensitivity and specificity; their diagnostic accuracy was, respectively, 87% (CI: 76%-94%) and 81% (CI: 69%-90%). The agreement of the 3 evaluations was fair to moderate. The addition of AUS to the PDAI or FDA increased their diagnostic accuracy to respectively 95% and 98%. CONCLUSIONS: The diagnostic accuracy of the FDA, PDAI, and computer-assisted AUS imaging was good in assessing perianal disease activity in patients with CD. The agreement between the techniques was fair to moderate. Overall accuracy can be increased by combining the FDA or PDAI with AUS.},

Various feeding practices have been implicated in the origin of IBD based on epidemiological observations in developed countries, but we do not have solid evidence for the etiological role played by specific food types. IBD is associated with frequent nutritional deficiencies, the pattern and severity of which depends on the extent, duration and activity of the inflammation. Nutritional support allows these deficiencies in calories, macro- and micro-nutrients to be rectified. Enteral nutrition is also a primary therapy for IBD, especially for Crohn's disease, as it allows the inflammatory activity to be controlled, kept in remission, and prevents or delays the need for surgery. Nutritional support is especially important in childhood IBD as an alternative to pharmacological treatment. This report discusses the complex relationship between diet and IBD.},

The root causes of these chronic and acute immunological disorders are unclear, but intestinal microorganisms are known to play a key role in the initiation and maintenance of disease. However, at present, there is no clear evidence for a single transmissible agent being involved in IBD aetiology. Although marked alterations occur in faecal and mucosal bacterial communities in IBD, it is unclear whether they are responsible for causing disease, or are due to changes in the gut environment that result from inflammatory reactions and extensive tissue destruction. Despite the involvement of microorganisms in inflammatory processes, antibiotic therapy has generally been unsuccessful in IBD. However, recent studies involving the use of probiotics, prebiotics and synbiotics suggest that there is potential for controlling these diseases through manipulation of the composition of the gut microbiota, and direct interactions with the gut immune system.},

METHODS: Overall, 83 new cases of IBD (41 ulcerative colitis, 42 Crohn's disease) and 160 healthy controls were studied. Portions per week of 34 foods and beverages before onset of symptoms were recorded using a validated questionnaire. Duration of symptoms before IBD diagnosis, presence of specific symptoms and their impact on subjective changes in usual dietary habits were also recorded. The association between diet and IBD was investigated by multiple logistic regression and dietary patterns were assessed by factor analysis. RESULTS: Changes in dietary habits, due to the presence of symptoms, were reported by 38.6% of patients and were not significantly related to specific symptoms, rather to long duration of symptoms, only in Crohn's disease patients. In IBD patients who did not change dietary habits, moderate and high consumption of margarine (OR = 11.8 and OR = 21.37) was associated with ulcerative colitis, whilst high consumption of red meat (OR = 7.8) and high intake of cheese were associated with Crohn's disease. CONCLUSION: More than one third of IBD patients change dietary habits before diagnosis. Margarine, red meat and cheese increase the risk of ulcerative colitis and Crohn's disease.},

Recently, it has been suggested that refrigerated food could be involved in disease development. We thus conducted a pilot case control study to explore the association of CD with the exposure to domestic refrigeration in childhood. METHODOLOGY/PRINCIPAL FINDINGS: Using a standard questionnaire we interviewed 199 CD cases and 207 age-matched patients with irritable bowel syndrome (IBS) as controls. Cases and controls were followed by the same gastroenterologists of tertiary referral clinics in Tehran, Iran. The questionnaire focused on the date of the first acquisition of home refrigerator and freezer. Data were analysed by a multivariate logistic model. The current age was in average 34 years in CD cases and the percentage of females in the case and control groups were respectively 48.3% and 63.7%. Patients were exposed earlier than controls to the refrigerator (X2 = 9.9, df = 3, P = 0.04) and refrigerator exposure at birth was found to be a risk factor for CD (OR = 2.08 (95% CI: 1.01-4.29), P = 0.05). Comparable results were obtained looking for the exposure to freezer at home. Finally, among the other recorded items reflecting the hygiene and comfort at home, we also found personal television, car and washing machine associated with CD. CONCLUSION: This study supports the opinion that CD is associated with exposure to domestic refrigeration, among other household factors, during childhood.},

   abstract = {Enteral nutrition has a primary therapeutic effect in active Crohn's disease. It is unknown which nutrient(s) account for this action, but a role for both the amount and type of dietary fat has been postulated. Some clinical and experimental data suggest that medium-chain triglycerides (MCT) may reduce intestinal inflammation. We aimed to assess the effect of replacing part of the dietary fat with MCT on the incidence and severity of colitis in interleukin (IL)-10(-/-) mice under specific pathogen-free conditions. Twenty-four IL-10(-/-) 4-wk-old mice were randomized to receive a control diet based on sunflower oil [(n-6) fatty acids (FA)] and an experimental isocaloric, isonitrogenous diet with 50% sunflower and 50% coconut oil (MCT diet). When the mice were 12 wk old, they were killed and the colon was examined for the presence of colitis, lymphocyte subpopulations and apoptosis, ex vivo cytokine production in supernatant of colon explants, toll-like receptor (TLR)-2 and TLR-9 mRNA, and FA profile in colonic tissue homogenates. Colitis incidence was lower in the IL-10(-/-) mice fed the MCT diet (1/12) than in the mice fed the control diet (8/12; P = 0.03). The histological damage score was also lower in the former (P < 0.0005). Feeding the MCT diet resulted in fewer total and apoptotic intraepithelial CD3+ and lamina propria CD3+CD4+ lymphocytes, as well as downregulated production of IL-6 and interferon-gamma, and reduced TLR-9 mRNA. We conclude that partial replacement of dietary (n-6) FA with MCT decreases the incidence of colitis in a model of spontaneous intestinal inflammation and provide experimental arguments for a possible primary therapeutic effect of MCT in human Crohn's disease.},

We report a fatal case of listeriosis in a patient with a history of Crohn's disease who consumed chicken salad purchased from a retail food establishment before developing listeriosis. As part of the regulatory testing programs, the U.S. Department of Agriculture Food Safety and Inspection Service and the Florida Department of Agriculture and Consumer Affairs found that chicken products from a single food-production establishment were contaminated with Listeria monocytogenes, resulting in a product recall. The case patient's Listeria isolate was subtyped by pulsed-field gel electrophoresis (PFGE) and matched the Listeria isolates from the recalled chicken products. Identification of the source of Listeria involved collaboration among two state public health laboratories and epidemiologists and state and federal regulatory agencies. PFGE typing can be used to reveal correlations between clusters of human illness and contaminated food products and to rapidly identify sources of Listeria infection to allow implementation of corrective actions at both the state and national levels.},

However, the potential link between exposure to some mycotoxins and human chronic intestinal inflammatory diseases, such as celiac and Crohn's diseases or ulcerative colitis, has not been investigated. Instead, several theories based on bacterial, immunological or neurological events have been elaborated to explain the etiology of these pathologies. Here we reviewed the literature on mycotoxin-induced intestinal dysfunctions and compared these perturbations to the impairments of intestinal functions typically observed in human chronic intestinal inflammatory diseases. Converging evidence based on various cellular and animal studies show that several mycotoxins induce intestinal alterations that are similar to those observed at the onset and during the progression of inflammatory bowel diseases. Although epidemiologic evidence is still required, existing data are sufficient to suspect a role of some food-associated mycotoxins in the induction and/or persistence of human chronic intestinal inflammatory diseases in genetically predisposed patients.},

Epithelial and immune cells of the intestinal mucosa recognise specific bacterial molecules via Toll like and NOD like receptors and this interaction modulates the inflammatory response (activation of the NF-kappaB pathway). It is thus rational to try treatments which could modify the intestinal microbiota i.e. antibiotics, new substrates (prebiotics) or new micro-organisms (probiotics). We review the literature on existing evidence for the efficacy of probiotic strains or combinations in patients with pouchitis (good evidence), ulcerative colitis (fair evidence), and Crohn's disease (no evidence at the present time). We also discuss the mechanisms of action, the use of microbial agents as pharmacological vectors, the development of genetically modified probiotics (including a clinical pilot trial in patients with Crohn's disease), and safety issues.},

   abstract = {Over the past decade, the analysis of metabolic data with advanced chemometric techniques has offered the potential to explore functional relationships among biological compartments in relation to the structure and function of the intestine. However, the employed methodologies, generally based on regression modeling techniques, have given emphasis to region-specific metabolic patterns, while providing only limited insights into the spatiotemporal metabolic features of the complex gastrointestinal system. Hence, novel approaches are needed to analyze metabolic data to reconstruct the metabolic biological space associated with the evolving structures and functions of an organ such as the gastrointestinal tract. Here, we report the application of multivariate curve resolution (MCR) methodology to model metabolic relationships along the gastrointestinal compartments in relation to its structure and function using data from our previous metabonomic analysis. The method simultaneously summarizes metabolite occurrence and contribution to continuous metabolic signatures of the different biological compartments of the gut tract. This methodology sheds new light onto the complex web of metabolic interactions with gut symbionts that modulate host cell metabolism in surrounding gut tissues. In the future, such an approach will be key to provide new insights into the dynamic onset of metabolic deregulations involved in region-specific gastrointestinal disorders, such as Crohn's disease or ulcerative colitis.},

   abstract = {Excessive migration of monocytes to a site of intestinal inflammation contributes to tissue damage in Crohn's disease. It is known that cilostazol, a specific phosphodiesterase-3 (PDE-3) inhibitor of platelets, decreases monocyte recruitment to intestinal mucosa through suppression of platelet-monocyte interactions. The objective of this study was to clarify whether cilostazol ameliorates murine ileitis by suppression of monocyte migration. Significant inflammation was induced in the ileum of SAMP1/Yit mice at 23 wk of age after piroxicam treatment for 3 wk. Weight of the terminal ileum of mice was significantly greater with inflammatory cell infiltration in SAMP1/Yit mice than in control mice (AKR-J). Treatment of SAMP1/Yit mice with cilostazol-containing food (200 ppm) for 3 wk significantly attenuated the increase in intestinal weight and the histological changes, including invasion of F4/80-positive macrophages. A significant increase in migration of monocytes and platelets to microvessels of the ileal mucosa was observed in SAMP/Yit mice in vivo by using an intravital fluorescence microscope. Pretreatment with cilostazol significantly attenuated the increased migration of monocytes, possibly through suppression of platelet-monocyte interactions. In conclusion, a PDE-3 inhibitor ameliorates murine ileitis through attenuating migration of monocytes to the intestinal mucosa, suggesting a potential usefulness of antiplatelet drugs for treatment of Crohn's disease.},

For meta-analysis, only randomized, blinded controlled trials unrestricted by language were included. Pre-clinical studies, volunteer studies and uncontrolled studies were excluded from the review of efficacy and meta-analysis, but included in the systematic review. Of 31 randomized, placebo-controlled treatment arms in 27 trials (encompassing 5029 study patients), S. boulardii was found to be significantly efficacious and safe in 84% of those treatment arms. A meta-analysis found a significant therapeutic efficacy for S. boulardii in the prevention of antibiotic-associated diarrhea (AAD) (RR = 0.47, 95% CI: 0.35-0.63, P < 0.001). In adults, S. boulardii can be strongly recommended for the prevention of AAD and the traveler's diarrhea. Randomized trials also support the use of this yeast probiotic for prevention of enteral nutrition-related diarrhea and reduction of Helicobacter pylori treatment-related symptoms. S. boulardii shows promise for the prevention of C. difficile disease recurrences; treatment of irritable bowel syndrome, acute adult diarrhea, Crohn's disease, giardiasis, human immunodeficiency virus-related diarrhea; but more supporting evidence is recommended for these indications. The use of S. boulardii as a therapeutic probiotic is evidence-based for both efficacy and safety for several types of diarrhea.},

   abstract = {This review provides an overview of the current status of the chemistry and biology of di-D-fructose dianhydrides (DFAs) with a focus on their potential as functional foods. The history of this family of cyclic ketodisaccharides has expanded for almost 100 years and offers a paradigmatic example of artificial synthetic molecules that were identified as natural products later on and finally encountered in our own table. Issued from fundamental investigations on the reactivity of carbohydrates in strongly acidic media, DFAs remained laboratory curiosities for decades. Early reports on their isolation from plants raised doubts, until the formation of some DFA representatives by the action of microorganisms on fructans was reported in the middle 1980s. Since then, research on DFAs has run in parallel in the areas of microbiology and carbohydrate chemistry. Evidence of the potential of these compounds as functional food was accumulated from both sides, with the development of biotechnological processes for mass production of selected candidates and of chemical methodologies to prepare DFA-enriched products from sucrose or inulin. In 1994 a decisive discovery in the field took place in the laboratory of Jacques Defaye in Grenoble, France: the presence of DFAs in a commercial sucrose caramel was evidenced in a quite significant 18% mass proportion! The development of an efficient analytical protocol for DFAs and the stereoselective synthesis of individual standards allowed one to demonstrate that DFAs and their glycosylated derivatives (glycosyl-DFAs) are universally formed during caramelization reactions. They are not potential food products; they have actually always been in our daily food. Most important, they seem to exert beneficial effects: they are acariogenic, low-caloric, and promote the growth of beneficial microflora in the gut. Most recent evidence indicates that DFAs can even protect the intestinal tract against agressive agents favor the assimilation of antioxidants, and act as a drug-like food for the treatment of colon ailments such as inflammatory bowel disease (Crohn disease). The development of efficient methodologies for the preparation of DFA-enriched caramels, compatible with the food and agricultural industry regulations, may lead to new natural functional foods and nutraceuticals based on DFAs in the near future.},

   abstract = {BACKGROUND: Crohn's disease (CD) is clinically expressed as a chronic affection of the gastrointestinal tract currently known to have a multifactorial etiology involving a complex pathophysiological host response modulated by genetic susceptibilities, demographic determinants and environmental factors. With more than 20 cases per 100,000 person-years, the province of Quebec, Canada is among regions of the world with highest reported occurrence of CD in relation to other places where comparable estimates are available. This ecological study was designed to provide a medium-scale spatial exploration of CD incidence after accounting for the influence of known population and regional determinants. Health records of consulting patients in southern Quebec were compiled from 1995 to 2000 and used to estimate age and sex standardized rates per health area (n = 156). Various statistical models taking into account the regional effect of Jewish ethnicity, aboriginal ancestry, material deprivation, prescription for oral contraceptives, reportable enteric infection incidence, smoking as well as latitude and longitude locations were fitted. RESULTS: The final regression model presented a coefficient of determination of 22.8% and there was evidence of an eastern trend in the residual incidence (p = 0.018). Overall, the smoothed residual incidence presented a heterogeneous spatial pattern with evidence of patches (multiple health areas) of high, low and contrasting values. Health areas with most extreme incidence residuals where also distributed over the whole province including one area in the metropolitan area of Montreal and others in surrounding areas. CONCLUSIONS: These findings suggest that known populational and regional factors derived through census information only explain a limited fraction of the geographical variation of CD incidence and lead to speculate that the effects of these factors may be incompletely captured (imperfect construction of proxy variables) or that other important factors remain unmeasured. In this view, markers of genetic profiles of homogeneous sub-populations, and other factors linked to agroenvironmental microbial exposure should be further investigated. Once accounting for known factors, it would also be worth comparing adjacent geographical areas demonstrating abrupt changes in residual incidence rates to further explore effect linked to regional factors from those resulting from various reporting systems.},

   abstract = {INTRODUCTION: Crohn's disease is a chronic condition of the gastrointestinal tract. It is characterised by transmural, granulomatous inflammation that occurs in a discontinuous pattern, with a tendency to form fistulae. The cause is unknown but may depend on interactions between genetic predisposition, environmental triggers, and mucosal immunity. METHODS AND OUTCOMES: We conducted a systematic review and aimed to answer the following clinical questions: What are the effects of medical treatments to induce remission in adults with Crohn's disease? What are the effects of surgical interventions to induce and maintain remission in adults with small-bowel Crohn's disease? What are the effects of surgical interventions to induce remission in adults with colonic Crohn's disease? What are the effects of medical interventions to maintain remission in adults with Crohn's disease; and to maintain remission following surgery? What are the effects of lifestyle interventions to maintain remission in adults with Crohn's disease? We searched: Medline, Embase, The Cochrane Library, and other important databases up to December 2009 (Clinical Evidence reviews are updated periodically, please check our website for the most up-to-date version of this review). We included harms alerts from relevant organisations such as the US Food and Drug Administration (FDA) and the UK Medicines and Healthcare products Regulatory Agency (MHRA). RESULTS: We found 93 systematic reviews, RCTs, or observational studies that met our inclusion criteria. CONCLUSIONS: In this systematic review we present information relating to the effectiveness and safety of the following interventions: aminosalicylates, antibiotics, azathioprine/mercaptopurine, ciclosporin, corticosteroids (oral), enteral nutrition, fish oil, infliximab, methotrexate, probiotics, resection, segmental colectomy, smoking cessation, and strictureplasty.},

Bacterial interactions with the gastrointestinal epithelium may be a trigger for inflammatory changes which occur in the gut. Antibiotics have been shown to alter disease activity in Crohn's disease. Probiotics (live microorganisms) administered for therapeutic purposes have been proposed due to the possibility of their altering the interaction of the gut mucosa with enteric bacteria. Extensive randomized trials are lacking in this area at this time. Current trials indicate the possibility of maintaining remission in pouchitis (non-specific inflammation) and the potential for inducing and maintaining remission in ulcerative colitis. Trials in Crohn's disease have shown mixed results.},

   abstract = {BACKGROUND: Rifaximin, Food and Drug Administration approved for traveler's diarrhea, has been used in adult patients with active inflammatory bowel disease (IBD). This retrospective review was undertaken to determine its role in the treatment of pediatric IBD. METHODS: A review of children with IBD, who were treated with rifaximin from 2005 to 2007 at our institution, was performed. Collected data included diagnosis, age, medication history, recent therapy, symptom, and interval to improvement. Response was rated as none, moderate, or optimum relief for each symptom. RESULTS: Twenty-three patients were identified, 12 with Crohn disease and 11 with ulcerative colitis (UC) with a median age of 13 years. The most common complaints were diarrhea in 20 patients (87%), abdominal pain in 17 (74%), and bloody stools in 15 (65%). Rifaximin was given at doses ranging between 10 and 30 mg/kg (Table 1). Of the 20 patients who presented with diarrhea 5 (25%) had relief of diarrhea within 1 week of starting rifaximin and total of 12 patients (60%) experienced relief within 4 weeks. Abdominal pain resolved in 3 of 17 patients (17.6%) within 1 week and in 12 of 17 (70.6%) within 4 weeks. Visible bleeding resolved in 10 of 15 patients (66.7%) within 4 weeks of therapy (Table 2). Analysis of concurrent medications showed 61% experienced relief of symptoms when addition of rifaximin was the only meaningful treatment change. CONCLUSIONS: Rifaximin was well-tolerated and showed favorable results. Larger doses of rifaximin were statistically better for abdominal pain. Further studies are needed to evaluate efficacy and optimal dosing of rifaximin in this population.},

   abstract = {Inflammatory bowel disease (IBD) including Crohn's disease (CD) and ulcerative colitis (UC) is a chronic inflammatory gastrointestinal autoimmune condition with an inappropriate immune response. We investigated DNA damage induced in vitro in lymphocytes from IBD patients caused by oxidative stress through H(2)O(2) and 2-amino-3-methylimidazo[4,5-f]quinoline (IQ) and whether the plant flavonoids, quercetin and epicatechin, found in fruits, tea and soybeans could effectively reduce such stress. Lymphocytes from IBD patients and healthy volunteers were treated with 50 microg/ml H(2)O(2) or IQ in the presence of quercetin (0-250 microg/ml) or epicatechin (0-100 microg/ml). Flavonoid supplementation (250 microM quercetin or 100 microM epicatechin) caused an overall significant decrease of induced DNA damage resulting in a 48.6% (P < 0.001) reduction of H(2)O(2)-induced and a 43% (P < 0.001) reduction of IQ-induced DNA damage within the patient groups; for the control groups, reductions in DNA damage were 35.2 and 57.1%, respectively (both, P < 0.001). There was less induced DNA damage within lymphocytes from UC patients compared to CD patients for both series of experiments (H(2)O(2) and quercetin, IQ and epicatechin). In conclusion, flavonoids dramatically reduced oxidative stress in vitro in lymphocytes from IBD patients and healthy individuals. Thus, flavonoids could be very effective in the treatment of oxidative stress and encouraged in the diet of IBD patients.},

   abstract = {Restorative proctocolectomy with ileal pouch-anal anastomosis (IPAA) has become the surgical treatment of choice for patients with medically refractory ulcerative colitis (UC) or UC with dysplasia and for the majority of patients with familial adenomatous polyposis. However, UC patients with IPAA are susceptible to inflammatory and noninflammatory sequelae, such as pouchitis, Crohn's disease of the pouch, cuffitis, and irritable pouch syndrome, in addition to common surgery-associated complications, which adversely affect the surgical outcome and compromise health-related quality of life. Pouchitis is the most frequent long-term complication of IPAA in patients with UC, with a cumulative prevalence of up to 50%. Pouchitis may be classified based on the etiology into idiopathic and secondary types, and the management is often different. Pouchoscopy is the most important tool for the diagnosis and differential diagnosis in patients with pouch dysfunction. Antibiotic therapy is the mainstay of treatment for active pouchitis. Some patients may develop dependency on antibiotics, requiring long-term maintenance therapy. Although management of antibiotic-dependent or antibiotic-refractory pouchitis has been challenging, secondary etiology for pouchitis should be evaluated and modified, if possible.},

Although biological agents are alternative treatments, they may not be suitable or available to some patients. AIM: To review the evidence for use of nonbiological drugs in the treatment of patients with IBD refractory to corticosteroids or thiopurines. METHODS: A literature search was performed using PubMed for English language publications with predetermined search criteria to identify relevant studies. RESULTS: Published evidence from uncontrolled series and controlled clinical trials has been used to produce a practical approach relevant to clinical practice which incorporates the indication, optimal dose, and side effects of various therapies including tacrolimus, methotrexate, thalidomide, tioguanine, mycophenolate mofotil, leucocyte apheresis, nutritional therapy, antibiotics, probiotics, allopurinol, rectal acetarsol and ciclosporin in the treatment of patients with refractory ulcerative colitis and Crohn's disease. Approaches to optimise thiopurine efficacy are also discussed. CONCLUSIONS: Patients with IBD refractory to corticosteroids or thiopurines may respond to alternative anti-inflammatory chemical molecules, but the evidence base for many of these alternatives is limited and further trials are needed.},

It is hypothesized that lactase persistence facilitates exposure to such milk products increasing the likelihood of adverse outcomes. Individuals either homozygous or heterozygous for the T allele of DNA variant, rs4988235, located 14kb upstream from the LCT locus, are associated with having lactase persistence.The aim of this study was to determine whether lactase persistence as evident by the T allele of rs4988235 is associated with Crohn's Disease (CD) in a New Zealand population. FINDINGS: Individuals homozygous for the T allele (T/T genotype) showed a significantly increased risk of having CD as compared with those homozygous for the C allele (OR = 1.61, 95% CI = 1.03-2.51). Additionally, a significant increase in the frequency of the T allele was observed in CD patients (OR = 1.30, 95% CI = 1.05-1.61, p = 0.013), indicating that the T allele encoding lactase persistence was associated with an increased risk of CD.

   abstract = {PURPOSE OF REVIEW: The authors present evidence published during the past 2 years of the roles of commensal and pathogenic bacteria in the pathogenesis of the inflammatory bowel diseases. RECENT FINDINGS: Rodent models conclusively implicate commensal enteric bacteria in chronic, immune-mediated, experimental colitis, and genetically determined defects in bacterial killing by innate immune cells are found in a subset of patients with Crohn's disease. There is no evidence that a single pathogen, including Mycobacterium avium subspecies paratuberculosis, causes Crohn's disease or ulcerative colitis. However, adherent/invasive Escherichia coli are associated with ileal Crohn's disease, with the mechanisms and genetics of adherent/invasive E. coli virulence being elucidated. Molecular characterization of the microbiota in patients with inflammatory bowel diseases reveals decreased biodiversity of commensal bacteria, most notably the phyla Bacteroidetes and Firmicutes, including the clinically relevant Faecalibacterium prausnitzii, and increased E. coli concentrations. VSL#3 is one probiotic preparation shown to be efficacious in certain clinical situations in small clinical trials. SUMMARY: Further characterization of altered microbiota in patients with inflammatory bowel diseases and linking dysbiosis with host genetic alterations in immunoregulation, innate microbial killing and barrier function are critical, so that individualized treatments to increase beneficial commensals and their metabolic products (probiotic and prebiotic administration) and diminish deleterious species such as adherent/invasive E. coli can be tailored for defined patient subsets.},

Case-control data on New Zealand Caucasians show no differences for CD risk between individuals carrying the L503F OCTN1 C-allele when compared with those carrying the variant T-allele. However, more of the New Zealand CD cases report intolerance to maize and mushrooms than those who report beneficial effects or no differences. The OCTN1 gene encodes a transporter for ergothionine, a fungal metabolite at high levels in mushrooms but not widely common in other dietary items. An inability to tolerate mushrooms showed statistically significant associations with the variant OCTN1 genotype. That is, among those individuals reporting adverse effects from mushrooms, there was a higher frequency of the variant T-allele when compared with the general population, or with CD patients overall. We believe that this is a novel gene-diet association, suggesting that individuals carrying the OCTN1 variant single nucleotide polymorphism may have an enhanced risk of adverse symptoms associated with consuming mushrooms. Nutrigenomic approaches to dietary recommendations may be appropriate in this group.},

Indeed, dangerous liaisons among host genotype, viral infection, intestinal injury, and trillions of gut microbes may in part determine which individuals progress to a full-blown disease state. These findings suggest that viral and bacterial triggers may serve as therapeutic targets for Crohn's and prompt new hypotheses that relate inflammation, host immune status, microbial community structure, and human health.},

   abstract = {Anti-tumour necrosis factor-alpha (TNF-a) agents have changed the way of treating inflammatory bowel diseases (IBD) refractory to conventional medications (corticosteroids, immu-nomodulators). Infliximab, adalimumab, and certolizumab are more effective than placebo for induction and maintenance of remission in luminal Crohn's disease. Infliximab and adalimumab are also effective for maintenance of fistula closure in Crohn's disease. Only infliximab is Food and Drug Administration (FDA)-approved for ulcerative colitis. Only adalimumab has demonstrated its efficacy in a randomized controlled trial to induce remission after infliximab failure in Crohn's disease. Anti-TNF therapy leads to mucosal healing, reduces hospitalizations and surgeries, and improves patients' quality of life. Safety data indicate that serious infections occur in 2-4% of patients treated with anti-TNF therapy, with no statistical difference when compared to controls. The risk of rare events such as malignancies and lymphoma, in IBD patients treated with anti-TNF agents, will require a longer duration of follow-up. Currently, the risk-benefit ratio of anti-TNF therapy supports its use in IBD. Several questions remain to be answered: can an indiscriminate use of anti-TNF agents modify the natural course of the disease, should mucosal healing be used in clinical practice, and should anti-TNF therapy be used alone or in combination with immunomodulators in the long-term?},

   abstract = {Probiotics have been suggested as an alternative therapeutical approach in the intervention of inflammatory disorders of the gastrointestinal tract (GIT). Application of single strains or probiotic mixtures has shown promising results in animal models and patients of inflammatory bowel disease (IBD). We recently demonstrated potent inhibitory capacity of a Bifidobacterium bifidum S17 on LPS-induced inflammatory events in cell culture models using intestinal epithelial cells and verified these anti-inflammatory effects in two mouse models of colitis. In the present study we analyze the anti-inflammatory effect of this potential probiotic strain in a chemically-induced model of colitis in C57BL/6 mice. This model is characterized by a strong type 1T helper (Th1) response resembling Crohn's disease, one of the two most prevalent forms of IBD. We performed macroscopic analysis and determined the effect of B. bifidum S17 on the cytokine balance in biopsies of the colonic mucosa. While treatment with B. bifidum S17 only had a marginal effect on weight loss, no difference was observed in the macroscopic parameters. However, a significant reduction in histology scores and the levels of pro-inflammatory cytokines interleukin 1beta (IL-1beta), interleukin 6 (IL-6), keratinocyte-derived chemokine (KC) and the inflammatory markers cyclooxigenase 2 (Cox-2) and myeloperoxidase (MPO) was observed. These results indicate that treatment with B. bifidum S17 is able to partially inhibit the strong Th1-driven intestinal inflammation induced in our model of colitis.},

   abstract = {Approximately 25 % of individuals with Crohn's disease (CD), a life-long relapsing-remitting disease, are diagnosed during childhood and adolescence. Symptoms of CD, including abdominal pain, nausea and diarrhoea, can lead to reduced food intake, which may negatively have an impact on nutritional status during this critical period of growth and development. The aims of the present study were to assess the growth and adequacy of dietary intakes of children with CD at Sydney Children's Hospital, Randwick, and compare with healthy controls. Sixty-three subjects aged 10-16 years were recruited, including: children with active CD (n 18), children with CD in remission (n 23) and healthy controls (n 22). Dietary intake was assessed using a FFQ and compared with current Australian recommended dietary intakes (RDI). Growth and dietary intakes were compared between groups. Subjects with active CD had lower weight and BMI Z scores than children in remission and controls. The energy intakes of children with active CD and those in remission were significantly lower than estimated energy requirements (P = 0.001 and P = 0.03 respectively). Children with active CD did not meet the RDI for Fe and their Ca intake was lower than the RDI (P = 0.04). In conclusion, the dietary intake of children with active CD was impaired, with inadequate intakes of energy, Ca and Fe. Reduced energy intakes during active disease may contribute to poor weight gain and impaired growth. Quantifying nutrient intake and ascertaining requirements for nutritional supplementation are essential components of successful management in paediatric CD.},

   abstract = {PURPOSE OF REVIEW: To summarize recent evidence on the role of intestinal bacteria in inflammatory bowel diseases, and of antibiotics and probiotics in their treatment. The implications connected with the use of antibiotics are also examined. RECENT FINDINGS: The hypothesis that Mycobacterium paratuberculosis could be a causative agent of Crohn's disease has not been confirmed by a large trial on symptomatic patients treated by a combination of antibiotics active against this bacterium. An increased number of adherent-invasive Escherichia coli have been found in the intestinal tissue of patients with Crohn's disease, but their role in the pathogenesis of this condition remains to be defined. The combination of metronidazole and azathioprine, associating the effects of a reduced bacterial load with immunosuppression, appears to be a therapeutic option to decrease the recurrence of postoperative Crohn's disease in high-risk patients. However, concerns are raised by the possibility that antibiotics may induce disease relapse due to Clostridium difficile infection. SUMMARY: Recent literature provides increasing support for the use of antibiotics in Crohn's disease, although the side effects limit their long-term use. The efficacy of antibiotics in ulcerative colitis is not confirmed by the available literature, except in severe colitis. More trials are needed to support the use of probiotics as therapy in inflammatory bowel disease.},

   abstract = {Many studies have looked at connections between diet, etiology, signs and symptoms associated with inflammatory bowel disease (IBD). Although these connections are apparent to clinicians, they are difficult to prove qualitatively or quantitatively. Enteral feeding and polymeric diets are equally effective at bringing about remission in Crohn's disease (CD). Parenteral feeding is also effective, although none of these methods is as effective as corticosteroid therapy. However, enteral feeding is preferred in the pediatric population because linear growth is more adequately maintained via this route. Exclusion diets in patients brought into remission using an elemental diet have been shown to maintain remission for longer periods. Studies that aim to isolate culpable food groups have shown that individuals react differently on exposure to or exclusion of various foods. The commonly identified food sensitivities are cereals, milk, eggs, vegetables and citrus fruits. Studies that have looked at gut mucosal antigen behavior have shown higher rectal blood flow, in response to specific food antigens, in those with CD over healthy subjects. Exclusion of sugar shows little evidence of amelioration in CD. Omega 3 fatty acids show promise in the treatment of IBD but await larger randomized controlled trials. Patients frequently notice that specific foods cause aggravation of their symptoms. Whilst it has been difficult to pinpoint specific foods, with advances in the laboratory tests and food supplements available, the aim is to prolong remission in these patients using dietary measures, and reduce the need for pharmacotherapy and surgical intervention.},

METHOD: Forty patients with symptomatic CD were recruited. Their sera were tested for IgG4 antibodies to 14 specific food antigens and each subject's four most reactive foods were excluded for 4 weeks. Disease activity was assessed using a modified CD activity index (mCDAI). Questionnaire and inflammatory markers were measured before and on completion of the exclusion diet. RESULTS: Eleven patients did not complete the study, leaving 29 for analysis. Of these, 26 (90%) reported symptomatic improvement with a reduction in mCDAI from a mean of 171-97.5 (P = 0.0001). The ESR fell from 23 to 17 mm/h (P = 0.021) and the IgG4 titres for the excluded foods fell from a mean of 3015-2306 mcgA/l (P = 0.003). CONCLUSION: IgG4-guided exclusion diets resulted in significant symptomatic improvement with an objective fall in an inflammatory marker. This approach may be useful in clinical practice.},

   abstract = {Meat has received little attention regarding human exposure to Mycobacterium avium subsp. paratuberculosis, a possible infectious trigger of Crohn's disease. Meat has less contamination with other organisms than gut tissues, facilitating modifications to existing decontamination protocols prior to BACTEC culture that could increase analytical sensitivity. Using spiked meat samples we trialled enzymatic and chemical digestion techniques to concentrate larger starting samples, and modifications to existing clinical mycobacteriological decontamination protocols. An acid-pepsin digestion method using a 20 g sample was considerably more sensitive (detection limit 0.88 log(10) viable organisms per gram) than previous techniques. However, it was cumbersome for routine use, and subject to frequent contamination. Modifications to an existing centrifugation protocol yielded a simple, robust technique with slightly improved sensitivity (detection limit 1.77 log(10) per gram). Use of these sensitive tests in parallel identified M. a. paratuberculosis in the muscle of 59% and peripheral lymph nodes (PLN) of 85% of clinically infected sheep. The numbers of M. a. paratuberculosis in these infected tissues were low (1.67+/-0.92 log(10) per gram in muscle and 2.06+/-0.69 log(10) per gram in PLN), such that many would not have been detected by routine methods. Fewer subclinically infected animals with gross lesions harboured M. a. paratuberculosis in meat (4.5%) or PLN (32%), and the numbers of organisms in such infected animals were lower. Because most animals raised specifically for meat production are young and unlikely to be heavily infected, and because meat is usually consumed cooked, the risk of human exposure to viable M. a. paratuberculosis via meat may be small. Measures to prevent heavily infected animals, especially those with clinical signs, from entering the human food chain would further reduce this risk.},

   abstract = {Crohn's disease (CD) and ulcerative colitis (UC) are the two major forms of inflammatory bowel disease (IBD) and both diseases lead to high morbidity and health care costs. Complex interactions between the immune system, enteric commensal bacteria and host genotype are thought to underlie the development of IBD although the precise aetiology of this group of diseases is still unknown. The understanding of the composition and complexity of the normal gut microbiota has been greatly aided by the use of molecular methods and is likely to be further increased with the advent of metagenomics and metatranscriptomics approaches, which will allow an increasingly more holistic assessment of the microbiome with respect to both diversity and function of the commensal gut microbiota. Studies thus far have shown that the intestinal microbiota drives the development of the gut immune system and can induce immune homeostasis as well as contribute to the development of IBD. Probiotics which deliver some of the beneficial immunomodulatory effects of the commensal gut microbiota and induce immune homeostasis have been proposed as a suitable treatment for mild to moderate IBD. This review provides an overview over the current understanding of the commensal gut microbiota, its interactions with the mucosal immune system and its capacity to induce both gut homeostasis as well as dysregulation of the immune system. Bacterial-host events, including interactions with pattern recognition receptors (PRRs) expressed on epithelial cells and dendritic cells (DCs) and the resultant impact on immune responses at mucosal surfaces will be discussed.},

   abstract = {Probiotic bacteria, commensals selected for their presumed therapeutic properties when ingested orally, have attracted increasing attention for their possible efficacy in a range of gastrointestinal disorders, including the inflammatory bowel diseases of Crohn's disease and ulcerative colitis. Since the barrier properties of the intestinal epithelium are believed to be compromised as a consequence (or perhaps as a cause) of intestinal inflammation, we hypothesized that probiotics might ameliorate such epithelial dysfunction as part of their spectrum of beneficial effects. We have used both cell line and animal models to test this hypothesis and show that two probiotics have significant effects on epithelial barrier properties, both at baseline and when deranged by inflammatory cytokines or in the setting of inflammation in a mouse model of colitis. Moreover, the probiotics also normalize epithelial ion transport function, which could also contribute to clinical efficacy. Overall, our studies extend the spectrum of functional effects attributable to probiotics, and may provide a rationale for their use in a range of gastrointestinal disorders associated with epithelial dysfunction.},

   abstract = {BACKGROUND: Crohn's disease is common in developed nations where the typical diet is low in fibre and high in processed food. Primary lesions overlie Peyer's patches and colonic lymphoid follicles where bacterial invasion through M-cells occurs. We have assessed the effect of soluble non-starch polysaccharide (NSP) and food emulsifiers on translocation of Escherichia coli across M-cells. METHODS: To assess effects of soluble plant fibres and food emulsifiers on translocation of mucosa-associated E coli isolates from Crohn's disease patients and from non-Crohn's controls, we used M-cell monolayers, generated by co-culture of Caco2-cl1 and Raji B cells, and human Peyer's patches mounted in Ussing chambers. RESULTS: E coli translocation increased across M-cells compared to parent Caco2-cl1 monocultures; 15.8-fold (IQR 6.2-32.0) for Crohn's disease E coli (N=8) and 6.7-fold (IQR 3.7-21.0) for control isolates (N=5). Electron microscopy confirmed E coli within M-cells. Plantain and broccoli NSP markedly reduced E coli translocation across M-cells at 5 mg/ml (range 45.3-82.6% inhibition, p<0.01); apple and leek NSP had no significant effect. Polysorbate-80, 0.01% vol/vol, increased E coli translocation through Caco2-cl1 monolayers 59-fold (p<0.05) and, at higher concentrations, increased translocation across M-cells. Similarly, E coli translocation across human Peyer's patches was reduced 45+/-7% by soluble plantain NSP (5 mg/ml) and increased 2-fold by polysorbate-80 (0.1% vol/vol). CONCLUSIONS: Translocation of E coli across M-cells is reduced by soluble plant fibres, particularly plantain and broccoli, but increased by the emulsifier Polysorbate-80. These effects occur at relevant concentrations and may contribute to the impact of dietary factors on Crohn's disease pathogenesis.},

   abstract = {The purpose of this research was to test the hypothesis that starch-entrapped microspheres would produce favourable fermentation profiles and microbial shifts during in vitro fermentation with the faecal microbiota from patients with inflammatory bowel disease (IBD). In vitro fermentation was carried out using a validated, dynamic, computer-controlled model of the human colon (Toegepast Natuurwetenschappelijk Onderzoek gastro-intestinal model-2) after inoculation with pooled faeces from healthy individuals, patients with inactive IBD (Crohn's disease (CD)) or patients with active IBD (ulcerative colitis (UC)). Starch-entrapped microspheres fermented more slowly and produced more butyrate than fructo-oligosaccharides (FOS) when fermented with the faecal microbiota from patients with active UC. When fermented with the microbiota from patients with inactive CD, starch-entrapped microspheres also fermented more slowly but produced similar amounts of butyrate compared with FOS. Starch-entrapped microspheres showed a greater ability to maintain a low pH during simulated-distal colon conditions compared with FOS. After fermentation with the microbiota from inactive CD patients, starch-entrapped microspheres resulted in lower concentrations of some potentially harmful gut bacteria, included in Bacteroides, Enterococcus, Fusobacterium and Veillonella, compared with FOS. These findings suggest that slow fermenting starch-entrapped microspheres may induce a favourable colonic environment in patients with IBD through high butyrate production, maintenance of low pH in the distal colon and inhibition of the growth of potentially harmful bacteria.},

   abstract = {Inflammation is part of the normal host response to infection and injury. However, inappropriate inflammation contributes to several diseases, including inflammatory bowel disease (IBD) and rheumatoid arthritis (RA). Both conditions are characterized by the excessive production of inflammatory cytokines, arachidonic acid (AA)-derived eicosanoids, and other inflammatory agents (e.g., reactive oxygen species, adhesion molecules). By virtue of their anti-inflammatory action, omega-3 polyunsaturated fatty acids (PUFA) may be beneficial in inflammatory diseases. A large body of evidence supports a protective effect of omega-3 PUFA in experimental animal and ex-vivo models of Crohn's disease (CD), Ulcerative colitis (UC) and Rheumatoid arthritis (RA). Although fish oil supplementation in patients with IBD results in omega-3 PUFA incorporation into gut mucosal tissue and modification of inflammatory mediator profiles, the evidence of clinical benefits of omega-3 PUFA is weak. On the other hand, more convincing data support the efficacy of omega-3 PUFA in reducing pain, number of tender joints, duration of morning stiffness, use of non-steroidal anti-inflammatory drugs and improving physical performance in RA patients. In both IBD and RA further clinical trials with large sample size are needed to clarify the efficacy of omega-3 PUFA as a treatment.},

The aim of this prospective study was to evaluate the connection between OFG in childhood and systemic disease. METHODS: During a 3-year period, eight children (9-16 years old) who had been referred to the clinic of oral medicine were diagnosed solely with OFG. Thus, none of them had any known systemic disease or gastrointestinal symptoms at the time of referral. The children were then medically examined and followed up for 6-8 years at the department of paediatrics for systemic disease with specific emphasis on inflammatory disorders elsewhere in the gastrointestinal tract. RESULTS: During follow-up, four patients were diagnosed with Crohn's disease (CD). Further, one girl was found to have a food allergy-induced OFG, with delayed-type hypersensitivity to oats. One boy developed both diabetes and celiac disease during the follow-up. Only two patients had no diagnosis of systemic disease at the end of the observation period. CONCLUSION: OFG in childhood seems to be frequently related to systemic disease, and children with OFG should be referred to a paediatrician for examination and follow-up.},

   abstract = {The notion that the intestinal microbiota plays a key role for the development of intestinal inflammation, initially based on a series of clinical observations both in human inflammatory bowel disease and experimental colitis, has been reinforced by a growing body of evidence demonstrating that the abnormal recognition of bacterial and other microbiota antigens by the innate immune system is one of the earliest events in the pathogenesis of inflammatory bowel disease. In keeping with our present knowledge of inflammatory bowel disease pathophysiology, the search for therapeutic approaches aimed at modifying the composition of the intestinal microbiota to obtain new, more targeted treatments for inflammatory bowel disease that are basically free of side effects has been a subject of intense research activity. Probiotics are defined as live organisms capable of conferring health benefits beyond their nutritional properties. Numerous micro-organisms have been evaluated to induce or maintain remission, or both, in ulcerative colitis, Crohn's disease and pouchitis. Overall, probiotics have successfully demonstrated some efficacy in some inflammatory bowel disease scenarios. However, a critical review of the available scientific literature shows that: (1) in spite of great expectations, reflected by a high number of review and editorial articles in top journals, the number of published, well-designed clinical trials using probiotics in inflammatory bowel disease is small, often with few patients; (2) the range of microbial agents makes it particularly difficult to draw global conclusions; (3) the quality of the evidence on the efficacy of probiotics in pouchitis is clearly better than that in ulcerative colitis, while there is virtually no evidence of probiotic efficacy in Crohn's disease. The appropriate selection of probiotic agents combined with convincing clinical trials will determine whether probiotics can jump from promise to reality in inflammatory bowel disease clinical practice.},

Several conditions such as tuberculosis, psoriasis, eczema, Crohn's disease, chest infections, wound infections, influenza, urinary tract infections, eye infections and wound healing may benefit from adequate circulating 25(OH)D as substrate. Clinical diseases are presented in which optimization of 25(OH)D levels may benefit or cause harm according to present day knowledge. The safety of using larger doses of vitamin D in various clinical settings is discussed.},

RECENT FINDINGS: Epidemiological observations and clinical findings have strengthened the concept that both nutritional deficiencies and nutritional excesses impair the gastrointestinal response(s) and alter susceptibility to inflammation and other diseases. The interaction of micronutrient intake, biochemical indicators of nutritional status, and four specific gastrointestinal inflammation states are reviewed. These conditions include celiac disease and concomitant micronutrient deficiencies resulting from the sustained adherence to a gluten-free diet; micronutrient nutrition as an important determinant of immunity for two major types of inflammatory bowel disease: ulcerative colitis and Crohn's disease; and HIV/AIDS-related diarrhea and concomitant micronutrient deficiencies which may be exacerbated by the initiation of highly active antiretroviral therapy. SUMMARY: For each inflammation 'state', enhancement of micronutrient status can improve immunocompetance and minimize therapeutic side-effects. The impact of single-micronutrient deficiencies on immune responses, and the possible impact of uncorrected micronutrient status are discussed.},

   abstract = {Recent advances in molecular sequencing technology have allowed researchers to answer major questions regarding the relationship between a vast genomic diversity-such as found in the intestinal microflora-and host physiology. Over the past few years, it has been established that, in obesity, type 1 diabetes and Crohn's disease-to cite but a few-the intestinal microflora play a pathophysiological role and can induce, transfer or prevent the outcome of such conditions. A few of the molecular vectors responsible for this regulatory role have been determined. Some are related to control of the immune, vascular, endocrine and nervous systems located in the intestines. However, more important is the fact that the intestinal microflora-to-host relationship is bidirectional, with evidence of an impact of the host genome on the intestinal microbiome. This means that the ecology shared by the host and gut microflora should now be considered a new player that can be manipulated, using pharmacological and nutritional approaches, to control physiological functions and pathological outcomes. What now remains is to demonstrate the molecular connection between the intestinal microflora and metabolic diseases. We propose here that the proinflammatory lipopolysaccharides play a causal role in the onset of metabolic disorders.},

   abstract = {Nutrition plays a role in inflammatory bowel disease (IBD) primarily in prevention and treatment of malnutrition and growth failure. Furthermore, in Crohn disease (CD), nutrition can induce remission, maintain remission, and prevent relapse. Malnutrition is common in IBD and the mechanisms involved include decreased food intake, malabsorption, increased nutrient loss, increased energy requirements, and drug-nutrient interactions. At the time of diagnosis, up to 85% of pediatric patients with CD and 65% of those with ulcerative colitis (UC) have weight loss. Growth failure occurs in 15% to 40% of children with IBD and is less common in UC compared with CD, both at diagnosis and during follow-up. In CD, nutritional therapy with enteral formulas induces remission at a rate comparable with that achieved with steroids. In adults with CD, limited information suggests that enteral nutrition (EN) may play a role in maintenance of remission. In children with CD colitis, one study suggested that children without colitis respond better to EN than children with colitis, and another study found no such difference but reported a trend toward earlier relapse in those with isolated colonic involvement. Finally, nutrition may play a role in IBD via the possible protective effect of breastfeeding against UC and CD. In summary, although only CD may benefit from nutrition as primary therapy for remission induction and possibly maintenance of remission, nutrition plays an important role in the prevention and treatment of malnutrition in IBD, and may have a protective role, via the effect of breast-feeding on disease occurrence.},

AIM: To provide a comprehensive up-to-date review of the efficacy and safety of certolizumab in Crohn's disease (CD). METHODS: Electronic databases, including PubMed, EMBASE, the Cochrane library and the Science Citation Index, were searched to retrieve relevant trials. In addition, meeting abstracts and the reference lists of retrieved articles were reviewed for further relevant studies. RESULTS: Three trials, enrolling a total of 1040 patients, are included in the meta-analysis to evaluate the short-term efficacy of certolizumab, which is effective for rapid induction and long-term maintenance of clinical response or remission and can improve quality of life in patients with Crohn's disease. Certolizumab is also effective for patients who have lost response to infliximab. However, its efficacy in infliximab-exposed patients is probably less than in infliximab-naive patients. Re-induction with certolizumab in patients who have flared on maintenance therapy can rescue a significant proportion of patients. There is no significant association between the efficacy of certolizumab and the baseline C-reactive protein level. In comparison with placebo, certolizumab does not increase the risk of serious adverse events. CONCLUSIONS: Certolizumab is effective and safe in treating Crohn's disease. Further studies are still required to assess its full safety profile.},

The aim of this study was to evaluate the efficacy and adverse events of Lactobacilli compared with placebo in maintenance therapy for Crohn disease. METHODS: We searched MEDLINE, EMBASE, the Cochrane Controlled Trials Register, OVID and BIOSIS. All randomized trials comparing Lactobacilli with placebo in maintenance therapy for Crohn disease were included. RESULTS: Six randomized controlled trials with a total of 359 participants met the inclusion criteria. From the meta-analyses, the relative risk (RR) of clinical relapse rate was 1.15 (95% confidence interval (CI) 0.90-1.48) comparing Lactobacilli with placebo and RR of endoscopic relapse rate was 1.31 (95%CI 0.57-3.00). Subgroup analyses showed RR for clinical relapse rates of Lactobacilli versus placebo was 0.99 (95%CI 0.76-1.29) in adults, 1.85 (95%CI 1.00-3.41) in children, 1.68 (95%CI 1.07-2.64) in Lactobacillus rhamnosus strain GG and 0.91 (95%CI 0.68-1.23) in Lactobacillus johnsonii respectively. The pooled RR of adverse events was 0.83 (95%CI 0.61-1.12). CONCLUSION: Our meta-analysis suggests that compared with placebo, administration of L. rhamnosus strain GG as maintenance therapy may increase the relapse rates of Crohn disease. L. johnsonii is inefficacious in reducing the incidence of relapse.},

In this study, we focused on the detection of MAP in 220 bulk tank milk (BTM) samples from all dairy cattle herds in Cyprus. In total, 63 (28.6%) BTM milk samples were found to be positive for MAP using quantitative real-time PCR assays for IS900 and F57. The presence of MAP in BTM was low, and was assessed to be several tens of MAP cells per one ml of BTM. Milk samples examined by cultivation were found to be negative for MAP in all 220 BTM. In two BTM samples cultivation and subsequent sequencing of 16S rRNA revealed two isolates of M. fortuitum.},

   abstract = {BACKGROUND: Most moderate-severe juvenile Crohn's disease (CD) patients are in a constant catabolic state resulting in poor weight gain and growth failure. Anti-inflammatory, immunomodulatory, and monoclonal antibody drugs, as well as growth hormone (GH), frequently fail to achieve sustained remission or reverse growth failure. OBJECTIVE: To test whether an exclusion diet with nutraceutical therapy (DNT) could induce sustained clinical remission and weight gain, and if so does this enhance the ability for GH to reverse growth failure. METHODS: An uncontrolled prospective case study was undertaken in six moderate- severe CD patients, two of whom had completed growth. All were treated with DNT. Adequate caloric and protein ( >or= 3g/kg/d) intake for catch up weight was prescribed. Dairy products, certain grains and carrageenan containing foods were eliminated. Nutraceuticals, consisting of fish peptides, bovine colostrum, boswellia serrata, curcumin and a multivitamin were administered daily. Lactobacillus GG, a probiotic, was administered twice weekly. Recombinant human GH (rhGH) was administered daily. RESULTS: Within 2 months of starting DNT all six patients went into remission, with discontinuation of all pharmacological drugs. Three patients have remained in sustained remission for 4 to 8 years. One patient with very severe CD had recurrence of CD symptoms after being in complete remission for 18 months, one patient was in remission for 3 years but symptoms recurred when she became less compliant to DNT and one recently treated patient remains in remission after 6 months. With the addition of rhGH, the 4 growing patients had good-excellent growth response CONCLUSION: DNT engendered prolonged remission and restoration of normal weight in moderate-severe juvenile CD patients, providing conditions that enabled rhGH to stimulate growth. These findings justify larger controlled trials to evaluate the long-term benefit of compliance to DNT in both juvenile and adult CD patients.},

   abstract = {BACKGROUND: Crohn's disease is an inflammatory illness in which the immune response against gut microorganisms is believed to drive an abnormal immune response. Consequently, modification of mucosal bacterial communities, and the immune effects they elicit, might be used to modify the disease state. AIM: To investigate the effects of synbiotic consumption on disease processes in patients with Crohn's disease. METHODS: A randomized, double-blind placebo-controlled trial was conducted involving 35 patients with active Crohn's disease, using a synbiotic comprising Bifidobacterium longum and Synergy 1. Clinical status was scored and rectal biopsies were collected at the start, and at 3- and 6-month intervals. Transcription levels of immune markers and mucosal bacterial 16S rRNA gene copy numbers were quantified using real-time PCR. RESULTS: Significant improvements in clinical outcomes occurred with synbiotic consumption, with reductions in both Crohn's disease activity indices (P = 0.020) and histological scores (P = 0.018). The synbiotic had little effect on mucosal IL-18, INF-gamma and IL-1beta; however, significant reductions occurred in TNF-alpha expression in synbiotic patients at 3 months (P = 0.041), although not at 6 months. Mucosal bifidobacteria proliferated in synbiotic patients. CONCLUSION: Synbiotic consumption was effective in improving clinical symptoms in patients with active Crohn's disease.},

   abstract = {BACKGROUND: Ghrelin, a potent orexigenic peptide produced by the stomach, may be affected by circulating inflammatory mediators. AIM: To assess the effect of an anti-TNFalpha antibody on ghrelin in patients with Crohn's disease (CD). METHODS: Fifteen patients with Crohn's receiving infliximab were studied before and 1 week after infusion. Following an overnight fast, blood was sampled before a meal and then every 20 min for 2 h. Total ghrelin and CRP were measured using ELISA. Acylated ghrelin and TNFalpha, IFNgamma, IL-1beta and IL-6 were measured with bioplex. Harvey Bradshaw Activity Index was assessed. RESULTS: Median (95% CI) 2-h integrated plasma total ghrelin increased from 162 (99-311) before infliximab to 200 (128-387) pg/mL h, (P = 0.02) after. Following infliximab, 20 min postmeal, median acylated ghrelin decreased from 50.3 (24-64) to 38.6 (26-82) pg/mL, (P = 0.04) thus reverting to a traditional meal related ghrelin curve. Median (range) disease activity decreased from 5 (2-28) before to 3 (0-22), (P = 0.0001) and Median (95% CI) TNFalpha decreased from 2.8 (1.89-4.48) to 1.31 (0.73-2.06) pg/mL (P = 0.002). CONCLUSIONS: Infliximab increases circulating total ghrelin by 25% in CD and restores the postprandial response of acylated ghrelin to food intake. Acylated and de-sacyl ghrelin remain unchanged, suggesting that an alternate isoform could be affected by infliximab.},

   abstract = {BACKGROUND: The US Food and Drug Administration currently approves three types of anti-tumor necrosis factor alpha (anti-TNFalpha) therapy for treatment of moderate to severe Crohn's disease. There are no guidelines to clarify which of the drugs may be better suited to individual clinical scenarios. AIMS: We gathered national data on the prescribing pattern, comfort levels, and algorithms gastroenterologists use for management of their biologic-requiring Crohn's disease patients. METHODS: An internet survey was mailed to members of the American Gastroenterology Association. Responses were separated into "non-expert" and "expert" physician groups on the basis of whether a practice consisted of >50% of patients with inflammatory bowel disease. We compared experts with non-experts with regard to the use of the three anti-TNF agents, attitudes regarding their relative efficacy, and their experience with adverse events. RESULTS: Of 3,990 eligible gastroenterologists, 473 replied in full (11.9%). Sixty (12.6%) respondents met the criterion for IBD expert physician. Experts were comfortable using both immunomodulators and anti-TNFalpha therapy. Community physicians were equally comfortable prescribing 6-mercaptopurine, azathioprine, infliximab, and adalimumab, but less comfortable than experts with methotrexate (56 vs. 86%, P<0.05) and certolizumab (68 vs. 89%, P<0.05). Expert physicians were much more likely to have encountered adverse reactions to anti-TNFalpha therapy. CONCLUSIONS: Our results suggest that experts are more comfortable using a broader array of medical therapy than non-expert physicians. Although both groups had similar concerns regarding side-effects of anti-TNFalpha therapy, expert physicians were much more likely to have managed a broad range of complications in their patient population.},

   abstract = {The intestinal flora harbors varies pathogens. Clostridium perfringens (gas gangrene), Enterococci (endocarditis), Enterobacteriaceae (sepsis), Bacteroides (abscesses) are present in the large intestine of every healthy person in high concentrations. These bacteria are, however, separated from the colonic wall by an impenetrable mucus layer and are tolerated by the host. This separation is disturbed in patients with inflammatory bowel disease (IBD), where bacteria adhere to the mucosa and invade epithelial cells with concomitant inflammatory response. This chronic bowel inflammation can not subside as long as the mucus barrier remains defective. The inflammatory response interferes with the state of tolerance to the intestinal bacteria and leads to characteristic changes in the biostructure of the faecal microbiota. These changes in the biostructure of faecal microbiota are specific for active Crohn's disease and ulcerative colitis (UC) and can be longitudinally monitored. The reason for the defect of the mucus barrier in IBD patients is unclear. Epidemiologic studies indicate a negative role of western lifestyle and foods and document the rise in the incidence of IBD in the industrialized countries during the 20(th) century. In parallel to this, detergents were introduced in households and emulsifiers were increasingly added to food. The cleaning effect of these on the colonic mucus has to be investigated. The present contribution summarizes new data on the biostructure of the intestinal microbiota.},

We investigated the influence of 2% carboxymethylcellulose (CMC) on the biostructure of the intestinal microbiota in IL-10 gene-deficient mice. METHODS: Twenty to 27-week-old IL-10 gene-deficient mice received either 2% CMC solution (n = 7) or water (n = 6) orally for 3 weeks. Intestinal bacteria were investigated using fluorescence in situ hybridization in paraffin-fixed sections of the intestine. RESULTS: CMC-treated IL-10 gene-deficient mice demonstrated a massive bacterial overgrowth, distention of spaces between villi, with bacteria filling these spaces, adherence of bacteria to the mucosa, and migration of bacteria to the bottom of the crypts of Lieberkuehn. Leukocytes migrated into the intestinal lumen in 4 of the 7 CMC mice. The changes were similar to those observed in Crohn's disease in humans and were absent in control animals. CONCLUSIONS: CMC induces bacterial overgrowth and small bowel inflammation in susceptible animals. Because of its ubiquity in products and its unrestricted use in food of the industrial world, CMC is an ideal suspect to account for the rise of IBD in the 20th century.},

We have reported the effectiveness of 'half elemental diet (ED)' as maintenance therapy for patients with Crohn's disease (CD). The aim of this study was to evaluate the QOL of CD patients and medical costs of half-ED. METHODS: Fifty-one CD patients in remission were randomly assigned to a half-ED group (n=26) or a free diet group (n=25). The primary outcome measure was the occurrence of relapse during a 2-year period. This time, we investigated the QOL of the patients and medical costs of half-ED, as secondary outcomes. QOL was evaluated using the Japanese version of the IBDQ scoring system, and medical costs were calculated monthly from the receipts. RESULTS: IBDQ score was not significantly different between the two groups at 1 and 13 months after the start of maintenance treatment. Medical costs were not significantly different between them either. This study showed that half-ED therapy did not affect the treatment of CD patients, neither regarding their QOL nor medical costs. CONCLUSION: This study has confirmed this half-ED therapy is beneficial for patients with Crohn's disease.},

   abstract = {This clinical report reviews the currently known health benefits of probiotic and prebiotic products, including those added to commercially available infant formula and other food products for use in children. Probiotics are supplements or foods that contain viable microorganisms that cause alterations of the microflora of the host. Use of probiotics has been shown to be modestly effective in randomized clinical trials (RCTs) in (1) treating acute viral gastroenteritis in healthy children; and (2) preventing antibiotic-associated diarrhea in healthy children. There is some evidence that probiotics prevent necrotizing enterocolitis in very low birth weight infants (birth weight between 1000 and 1500 g), but more studies are needed. The results of RCTs in which probiotics were used to treat childhood Helicobacter pylori gastritis, irritable bowel syndrome, chronic ulcerative colitis, and infantile colic, as well as in preventing childhood atopy, although encouraging, are preliminary and require further confirmation. Probiotics have not been proven to be beneficial in treating or preventing human cancers or in treating children with Crohn disease. There are also safety concerns with the use of probiotics in infants and children who are immunocompromised, chronically debilitated, or seriously ill with indwelling medical devices. Prebiotics are supplements or foods that contain a nondigestible food ingredient that selectively stimulates the favorable growth and/or activity of indigenous probiotic bacteria. Human milk contains substantial quantities of prebiotics. There is a paucity of RCTs examining prebiotics in children, although there may be some long-term benefit of prebiotics for the prevention of atopic eczema and common infections in healthy infants. Confirmatory well-designed clinical research studies are necessary.},

   abstract = {Diet is known to play a major role in the symptoms of the inflammatory bowel disease, Crohn's disease (CD). Although no single diet is appropriate to all individuals, most CD patients are aware of foods that provide adverse or beneficial effects. This study seeks to categorise foods in relation to their effects on symptoms of CD, in a New Zealand Caucasian population. Four hundred and forty-six subjects from two different centres in New Zealand were recruited into the study. An extensive dietary questionnaire (257 food items in 15 groups) recorded self-reported dietary tolerances and intolerances. Across each of the food groups, there were statistically significant differences among responses to foods. A two-dimensional graphical summary enabled stratification of foods according to the probability that they will be either beneficial or detrimental. A small number of foods are frequently considered to be beneficial, including white fish, salmon and tuna, gluten-free products, oatmeal, bananas, boiled potatoes, sweet potatoes (kumara), pumpkin, soya milk, goat's milk and yoghurt. Foods that are typically considered detrimental include grapefruit, chilli or chilli sauce, corn and corn products, peanuts, cream, salami, curried foods, cola drinks, high energy drinks, beer, and red wine. For a number of the food items, the same item that was beneficial for one group of subjects was detrimental to others; in particular soya milk, goat's milk, yoghurt, oatmeal, kiwifruit, prunes, apple, broccoli, cauliflower, linseed, pumpkin seed, sunflower seed, ginger and ginger products, beef, lamb, liver, and oily fish. It was not possible to identify a specific group of food items that should be avoided by all CD patients. The wide range of detrimental items suggests that dietary maintenance of remission is likely to be difficult, and to exclude a substantial number of foods. Personalised diets may be especially important to these individuals.},

   abstract = {BACKGROUND: N-3 polyunsaturated fatty acids (PUFA) are considered important pharmaconutrients for modulating mucosal immunity and therapeutic responses in patients with inflammatory bowel disease (IBD). We investigated the influence of diet therapy involving the use of an "n-3 PUFA food exchange table" (n-3DP) on the fatty acid composition of the erythrocyte membranes of IBD patients and its remission-maintaining effects. METHODS: We analyzed the fatty acid composition of the erythrocyte membrane before and after n-3DP intervention in 20 initial-onset IBD patients who had not undergone any dietary intervention. We then analyzed it again and evaluated disease activity after 12-18 months intervention in 230 IBD patients (168 ulcerative colitis, 62 Crohn's disease; follow-up group) in whom n-3DP was introduced after remission had been achieved. The follow-up group was divided into remission and relapse groups. RESULTS: In the 20 initial-onset patients, the mean n-3/n-6 ratio significantly increased after intervention (0.41 +/- 0.16 versus 0.70 +/- 0.20; P < 0.001). In the follow-up group the ratio in the remission group (n = 145) was significantly higher than that in the relapse group (n = 85) (0.65 +/- 0.28 versus 0.53 +/- 0.18; P < 0.001). The ratio significantly decreased in those who suffered a relapse after the beginning of treatment (P < 0.01). CONCLUSIONS: N-3DP significantly increased the erythrocyte membrane n-3/n-6 ratio in IBD patients, and this ratio was significantly higher in the remission group, suggesting that n-3DP alters the fatty acid composition of the cell membrane and influences clinical activity in IBD patients.},

   abstract = {Crohn disease and ulcerative colitis are chronic inflammatory diseases of the intestinal tract commonly denoted as inflammatory bowel diseases. It has been proposed that these diseases result from aberrant mucosal immune responses to nonpathogenic microbial residents of the intestines. Recently, it was established that continuous interactions between the innate and the adaptive intestinal immune cells and the microbiota are directly involved in maintaining the physiological noninflammatory state of the intestinal mucosa. In light of the complexity of this mucosal homeostasis, it is astonishing that the inflammatory bowel diseases are relatively rare. Recently, altered functions of the innate immune system have been identified. As such, both hyperresponsiveness and hyporesponsiveness of innate cells have been implicated in the pathogenesis of inflammatory bowel diseases.},

   abstract = {Autophagy is a cellular pathway involved in protein and organelle degradation, which is likely to represent an innate adaptation to starvation. In times of nutrient deficiency, the cell can self-digest and recycle some nonessential components through nonselective autophagy, thus sustaining minimal growth requirements until a food source becomes available. Over recent years, autophagy has been implicated in an increasing number of clinical scenarios, notably infectious diseases, cancer, neurodegenerative diseases, and autoimmunity. The recent identification of the importance of autophagy genes in the genetic susceptibility to Crohn's disease suggests that a selective autophagic response may play a crucial role in the pathogenesis of common complex immune-mediated diseases. In this review, we discuss the autophagic mechanisms, their molecular regulation, and summarize their clinical relevance. This progress has led to great interest in the therapeutic potential of manipulation of both selective and nonselective autophagy in established disease.},

   abstract = {During the last few years significant advances have been achieved in the understanding of the pathogenesis of inflammatory bowel disease (IBD). A genetic susceptibility to Crohn's disease has been proven by identification of variations as risk factor NOD2/CARD15. Functional data on NOD2/CARD15 and NF-kappaB activation indicate that an inflammatory reaction of the intestinal mucosa, as an immediate response of the innate immune system, may be necessary for the maintenance of gut homeostasis. Crohn's disease is now also discussed as an impaired and inadequate immune reaction and no longer only as a hyper-responsiveness of the mucosal immune system. Data on NOD2/CARD15 expression suggest that macrophages and epithelial cells could be the locus of the primary pathophysiological defect and that T-cell activation might just be a secondary effect inducing chronification of the inflammation, perhaps as backup mechanism to insufficient innate immunity. In addition to NOD2/CARD15 there are more "innate" pathways by which commensal and pathogenic bacteria can directly be hindered to invade the human body (such as interaction with Toll like receptors, TLRs and defensins). The "germ-concept" and the "genetic concept" of IBD pathophysiology are converging. However, more time is needed until these important insights in IBD pathogenesis will make their way into routine diagnostic procedures and treatment of patients with IBD.},

   abstract = {BACKGROUND: Anaemia represents a common complication of inflammatory bowel disease (IBD). Most studies on anaemia in IBD patients have been performed in tertiary referral centres (RC) and data from gastroenterologic practices (GP) are lacking. We investigated the frequency and severity of anaemia in IBD patients from tertiary referral centres and gastroenterologic practices compared to the general population. METHODS: Data were acquired from patients included in the Swiss IBD Cohort Study. IBD activity was evaluated by CDAI and modified Truelove and Witts severity index (MTWSI). Anaemia was defined as haemoglobin </=120g/L in women and </=130g/L in men. RESULTS: 125 patients from RC (66 with Crohn's disease (CD) and 59 with ulcerative colitis (UC)) and 116 patients from GP (71 CD and 45 UC) were included and compared to 6074 blood donors. Anaemia was found in 21.2% (51/241) of the IBD patients and more frequently in patients from RC as compared to GP and healthy controls (28.8% vs. 12.9% vs. 3.4%; P<0.01). IBD patients from RC suffered more frequently from active disease compared to IBD patients in GP (36% vs. 23%, P=0.032). Supplementation therapy (iron, vitamin B12, folic acid) was performed in 40% of anaemic IBD patients in GP as compared to 43% in RC. CONCLUSIONS: Anaemia is a common complication in patients with IBD and significantly more prevalent in patients from referral centres as compared to patients from gastroenterologic practices. Physicians treating IBD patients should pay attention to the presence of anaemia and ensure sufficient supplementation therapy.},

   abstract = {Literature reviews are important information sources for multiple stakeholders in zoonotic public health with limited time to keep up with the rapid increase in primary research in this field. However, their validity depends on their methodological soundness. The study purpose was to evaluate the methodological soundness of literature reviews in zoonotic public health. Relevant reviews (n = 132) published between January 2000 and August 2006 were identified on three issues: Mycobacterium avium ssp paratuberculosis as a potential cause of Crohn's disease in humans (30 reviews); antimicrobial use in animals as a risk factor for antimicrobial resistance in human pathogens (36); and the zoonotic potential of transmissible spongiform encephalopathies (66). The zoonotic aspect of the issue was the focus of 59 reviews and a subsection of 73 reviews. Two independent reviewers evaluated reviews using 13 criteria: 10 previously validated in the medical field, and three applicable to aetiology research. No review met more than eight of 13 criteria for methodological soundness; two articles met only one criterion. Two reviews described methods for identifying relevant primary research. In only two and four reviews respectively, authors conducted quantitative syntheses of research evidence or reported summarized measures of effect for the zoonotic risk to humans. Recommendations for future research and economic impact were provided in 64 and 10 reviews respectively. In 14 reviews, conclusions exceeded evidence presented. The various review authors' position on the evidence for the zoonotic association and the zoonotic risk to public health were inconsistent for all three issues. Reviews addressing potential zoonotic public health issues lack structured and transparent methodology preventing the end user from assessing the review's validity. These reviews should adhere to structured scientific principles similar to what is used for primary research articles.},

   abstract = {Cyclooxygenase-2 (COX-2) is an important regulator of inflammation implicated in the development of a variety of diseases, including inflammatory bowel disease (IBD). However, the regulation of intestinal inflammation by COX-2 is poorly understood. We previously reported that COX-2(-/-) mice fed a cholate-containing high-fat (CCHF) diet had high mortality of unknown mechanisms attributable to severe intestinal inflammation in the ileo-ceco-colic junction that presented characteristics similar to Crohn's disease (CD). To further characterize the role of COX-2 in intestinal inflammation, we established cell-specific conditional COX-2(-/-) mice. Endothelial cell-specific (COX-2(-E/-E)) and myeloid cell-specific (COX-2(-M/-M)) COX-2(-/-) mice, but not wild-type mice, on the CCHF diet developed localized CD-like pathology at the ileo-ceco-colic junction that was associated with cellular infiltration, increased expression of myeloperoxidase and IL-5, and decreased IL-10 expression. The CD-like pathology in COX-2(-E/-E) mice was also accompanied by increased expression of cytokines (IL-6, TNF-alpha, and INF-gamma), compared with wild-type mice and COX-2(-M/-M) mice. In contrast, the ileo-ceco-colic inflammation in COX-2(-M/-M) mice was associated with more pronounced infiltration of granulocytes and macrophages than COX-2(-E/-E) mice. COX-2(-ME/-ME) (COX-2(-M/-M) x COX-2(-E/-E)) mice on the CCHF diet developed CD-like pathology in the ileo-ceco-colic junction reminiscent of total COX-2(-/-) mice on CCHF diet and wild-type mice on CCHF diet treated with COX-2 inhibitor, celecoxib. The pathology of diet-mediated ileo-ceco-colic inflammation in COX-2(-/-) mice offers an excellent model system to elucidate the protective roles of endothelial and myeloid COX-2 and the molecular pathogenesis of CD.},

   abstract = {BACKGROUND AND AIMS: Crohn's disease (CD) is a chronic inflammatory bowel disease with relapse and remission. CD patients are admitted to hospital when bowel inflammation flares up severely, which lowers their quality of life. Enteral nutrition (EN) with an elemental diet plays an important role in the treatment for CD patients in Japan, because of its few adverse effects, and it is thought to be effective in maintaining remission. We investigated the effectiveness of EN with an elemental diet with regard to the avoidance of hospitalization. METHODS: A total of 268 patients with CD who visited hospital from 2003-2008 were enrolled. The relationship between the caloric content of an elemental diet and hospitalization as an end-point was examined retrospectively using Cox regression analysis. Cumulative non-hospitalization rates were calculated by the Kaplan-Meier method. RESULTS: Of the 268 patients, 155 received an elemental diet providing 900 kcal/day or more. Among 237 patients with ileal involvement, 135 patients receiving an elemental diet providing 900 kcal/day or more showed a statistically significant improvement in cumulative non-hospitalization rate. Among 31 patients without ileal involvement, in contrast, the cumulative non-hospitalization rate did not differ among those receiving an elemental diet of less or more than 900 kcal/day. CONCLUSION: The use of an elemental diet of 900 kcal/day may be effective in avoiding hospitalization in CD patients with ileal lesions. This diet may be useful in improving the long-term convalescence of these patients.},

   abstract = {Defensins are endogenous antibiotics with microbicidal activity against Gram-negative and Gram-positive bacteria, fungi, enveloped viruses and protozoa. A disturbed antimicrobial defense, as provided by Paneth- and other epithelial cell defensins, seems to be a critical factor in the pathogenesis of inflammatory bowel diseases. Conspicuously, there is a relative lack of Paneth cell beta-defensins HD-5 and HD-6 in ileal Crohn's disease, both in the absence of a pattern recognition receptor NOD2 mutation and, even more pronounced, in its presence. This deficit is independent of concurrent active inflammation and results in a diminished antibacterial killing by the mucosa. The Crohn's disease mucosa has not only a significant lack in killing different Escherichia coli but also an impaired ability in clearing Staphylococcus aureus as well as anaerobic micro-organisms. Thus, this dysfunction in antibacterial barrier seems to be broad and is not restricted to a single bacterial strain. In addition to directly controlling barrier function, Paneth cell defensins also regulate the composition of the bacterial stool flora. In the majority of patients, the Paneth cell deficiency is mediated by WNT signalling which suggests a disturbed Paneth cell differentiation in ileal Crohn's disease. In contrast, colonic Crohn's disease is characterised by an impaired induction of mucosal beta-defensins, partly due to a low copy number of the beta-defensin gene cluster. Therefore it seems plausible that bacteria take advantage of a niche formed by defensin deficiency. This would represent a paradigm shift in understanding Crohn's disease and provides a target for future therapeutic strategies.},

   abstract = {Clinical associations between Crohn's disease in humans and Mycobacterium avium subsp. paratuberculosis (MAP) have been suggested but not confirmed. Cattle could be sources for MAP, but little information on MAP prevalence with beef has been reported. Samples of ileocecal lymph nodes and swabs of hides and carcasses from 343 animals at cull cattle slaughtering facilities and 243 animals at fed cattle slaughtering facilities across the United States were analyzed for the presence of MAP. Amplification of genetic sequences detected MAP DNA predominantly on hides and in lymph nodes of samples taken at both types of processing facilities. More than 34% of the cattle at cull cow slaughtering facilities had ileocecal lymph nodes that tested positive for MAP DNA. From these same cattle, hide prevalence was more than twofold greater than the prevalence in ileocecal lymph nodes, suggesting that cross-contamination could be occurring during transport and lairage. The prevalence of MAP DNA decreased during processing, and less than 11% of the carcasses tested positive after interventions in the cull cow processing facilities. Using standard double-decontamination and culture techniques, less than 1% of the postintervention carcasses tested positive for viable MAP at cull cow facilities. In samples from the facilities processing only fed cattle, MAP prevalence of 1% or less was detected for ileocecal lymph node, hide, and carcass samples, and viable MAP was not detected. Based on this study, fed cattle carcasses are unlikely sources of MAP, and carcasses at cull cow plants have only a slight risk for transmitting viable MAP, due to current interventions.},

   abstract = {Mycobacterium avium subsp. paratuberculosis (MAP) causes Johne's disease in livestock and there is a debate about its role in humans in chronic inflammatory bowel disorders such as Crohn's disease, but the relationship remains unproven. Nevertheless livestock health authorities in many countries aim to lower the prevalence of this infection to reduce potential contamination of the human food supply. MAP may occur in bovine milk and data on thermal inactivation suggest pasteurisation is an effective process. Recently MAP has been identified in skeletal muscle of cattle and sheep but there are no data on its thermal inactivation in these substrates. In this study the inactivation of MAP was studied in a fluid homogenate of lamb skeletal muscle at temperatures previously identified as being relevant to cooking processes applied by domestic consumers. A PCR thermocycler was used to ensure accurate temperatures and rapid heat exchange, while radiometric culture was used to ensure sensitive detection of viable MAP for determination of D and z values. Among the two predominant strains of MAP, S and C, D(55) ranged from 56 to 89 min, D(60) was 8 to 11 min, D(65) was 26 to 35s while D(70) was 1.5 to 1.8s. Values for z were 4.21C degrees for the S strain and 4.51C degrees for the C strain. At temperatures of 65-70 degrees C, MAP appeared to be less heat tolerant in skeletal muscle fluid than in previous reports using milk as the medium. The total thermal exposure of MAP during baking of a sample of 16 leg-of-lamb roasts in domestic ovens was determined to result in more than 20 log reductions in most cases, that is the product was microbiologically safe. Based on the models used in this study, there is a low probability of survival of MAP provided that red meat is cooked to recommended standards.},

   abstract = {PURPOSE: The pharmacology, uses, dosages, safety, drug interactions, and contraindications of probiotics are reviewed. SUMMARY: Probiotics are live nonpathogenic microorganisms administered to improve microbial balance, particularly in the gastrointestinal tract. They consist of Saccharomyces boulardii yeast or lactic acid bacteria, such as Lactobacillus and Bifidobacterium species, and are regulated as dietary supplements and foods. Probiotics exert their beneficial effects through various mechanisms, including lowering intestinal pH, decreasing colonization and invasion by pathogenic organisms, and modifying the host immune response. Probiotic benefits associated with one species or strain do not necessarily hold true for others. The strongest evidence for the clinical effectiveness of probiotics has been in the treatment of acute diarrhea, most commonly due to rotavirus, and pouchitis. More research is needed to clarify the role of probiotics for preventing antibiotic-associated diarrhea, Clostridium difficile infection, travelers' diarrhea, irritable bowel syndrome, ulcerative colitis, Crohn's disease, and vulvovaginal candidiasis. There is no consensus about the minimum number of microorganisms that must be ingested to obtain a beneficial effect; however, a probiotic should typically contain several billion microorganisms to increase the chance that adequate gut colonization will occur. Probiotics are generally considered safe and well tolerated, with bloating and flatulence occurring most frequently. They should be used cautiously in patients who are critically ill or severely immunocompromised or those with central venous catheters since systemic infections may rarely occur. Bacteria-derived probiotics should be separated from antibiotics by at least two hours. CONCLUSION: Probiotics have demonstrated efficacy in preventing and treating various medical conditions, particularly those involving the gastrointestinal tract. Data supporting their role in other conditions are often conflicting.},

   abstract = {OBJECTIVE: This review study was designed to evaluate the efficacy of enteral nutrition (EN) for the maintenance of remission in patients with Crohn's disease (CD) who achieved medically or surgically induced remission. METHODS: The Medline, Embase, Ovid, and Cochrane database search of literature was carried out to identify studies that reported the efficacy of EN for the maintenance of remission in CD. The main outcome measure was the occurrence of clinical or endoscopic relapse. RESULTS: Ten studies were included: one randomized controlled trial, three prospective non-randomized trials, and six retrospective studies. Elemental, semielemental or polymeric diets were used as an oral supplement or a nocturnal tube feeding in addition to ordinary foods. Comparing outcomes between patients who received EN and those who did not, the clinical remission rate was significantly higher in those with EN in all seven studies. In two studies, EN showed suppressive effects on endoscopic disease activity. In all four studies investigating impacts of the quantity of enteral formula on clinical remission, higher amounts of enteral formula were associated with higher remission rates: > or =30 kcal/kg ideal body weight/day (vs. <30 kcal/kg ideal body weight/day), > or =1200 kcal/day (vs. <1200 kcal/day), and > or =1600 kcal/day (vs. <1600 kcal/day). Quantitative pooling of studies was not feasible because of the diversity of interventions and outcome measures among the studies. CONCLUSION: Although the evidence level is not high, the available data suggest that EN may be useful for maintaining remission in patients with CD. Large randomized controlled trials are necessary to assess a definite efficacy of EN for the maintenance of remission.},

   abstract = {PURPOSE: Hitherto, the efficacy of enteral nutrition (EN) on clinical outcomes during biological maintenance therapy in Crohn's disease (CD) has not been investigated. This prospective study was to assess the efficacy of EN on the maintenance rate of clinical remission in patients with quiescent CD receiving infliximab as maintenance therapy. METHODS: Fifty-six patients who achieved clinical remission with infliximab induction therapy received infliximab as maintenance therapy (5 mg/kg, every 8 weeks). Thirty-two of the 56 patients received concomitant EN: elemental diet infusion during night-time and a low fat diet during daytime (EN group), while the remaining 24 patients received neither nutritional therapy nor food restriction (non-EN group). All patients were followed for 56 weeks; CD activity index (CDAI) was assessed and CDAI < 150 was defined as clinical remission. RESULTS: During the 56-week observation, the mean CDAI was not significantly different between the 2 groups. Seven patients in the EN group ceased EN therapy because they maintained complete remission. On an intention-to-treat basis, 25 patients in the EN group (78%) and 16 patients in the non-EN group (67%) remained in clinical remission during the 56-week observation (P = 0.51). CONCLUSIONS: The outcomes of this prospective study showed that concomitant EN during infliximab maintenance therapy does not significantly increase the maintenance rate of clinical remission in patients with CD.},

   abstract = {BACKGROUND: The pathogenesis of Crohn's disease (CD) is unknown. Besides immunoregulatory, genetic and environmental aspects, a nutritional impact is also encountered. Whether taste perception exerts any influence on an increased consumption of carbohydrates is unknown. OBJECTIVE: To evaluate nutritional habits and taste perception in CD patients, either in active or inactive disease stages. DESIGN: A prospective study was performed with 31 active and 27 inactive CD patients, and 30 age and sex-matched healthy subjects. Nutritional behavior was determined using an extensive optical nutrition questionnaire and taste perception was assessed by a 3-drop method with exceeding dilution tests. RESULTS: Active and inactive CD patients exhibited a significant increased taste threshold for the detection of all solutions (bitter: P=0.0012; salty: P=0.0198; sour: P=0.0021; and sweet: P=0.0208). For recognition, the determination of bitter solution (P=0.0014) was significantly reduced in CD patients compared with healthy subjects. No impact of clinical or objective parameters of inflammation on taste perception could be established. The consumption of refined sugar in CD patients was higher than in healthy subjects, though not significant. CONCLUSIONS: An increased taste threshold for the detection of all 4 taste qualities in active and inactive CD patients suggests a systemic pathogenesis, such as an inflammation of the oral cavity, as a manifestation of CD. In this study, changes in taste threshold were not associated with altered sugar consumption.},
