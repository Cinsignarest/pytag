This study investigated the adequacy of dietary intake, based on the Canadian Dietary Reference Intake, in ambulatory patients with Crohn's disease and a normal body mass index (BMI; calculated as kg/m(2)). This was a cross-sectional study of 74 patients with mean age of 35.7+/-1.4 years and BMI of 23.05+/-0.45. All patients completed a 7-day food record and a diary for the Crohn's Disease Activity Index. Mean Crohn's Disease Activity Index was 138.99+/-11.38. Energy and protein intakes were within the recommended levels of intake, but total carbohydrates, fat, and saturated fat intake exceeded the recommended levels of <55%, <35%, and <10% in 39.2%, 27%, and 59.5% of the patients, respectively. Micronutrient intakes were suboptimal most notably for folate, vitamins C, E, and calcium. There were no substantial differences between patients with active and inactive disease in terms of failure to meet the Dietary Reference Intake. In conclusion, in this population sample, a large number of ambulatory patients with Crohn's disease have suboptimal dietary patterns despite a normal BMI and inactive disease. Dietary counseling and supplementation may be warranted in this patient population.},

The aim of this study was to determine the effect of exclusive enteral nutrition, which is increasingly being used as primary therapy for CD, on plasma antioxidant concentrations in children with active CD. METHODS: In a double-blind randomised controlled trial, 15 children with active CD (mean age, 11.3 years, range 6.8-15.7) attending a paediatric gastroenterology referral centre, were assigned to receive either a standard polymeric diet (Group S, n=8) or a glutamine-enriched polymeric diet (Group G, n=7) as primary therapy for active CD. Plasma concentrations of selenium, urates, vitamin A, vitamin E, vitamin C, glutathione, and also malondialdehyde (MDA) were measured at baseline and after 4 weeks of exclusive enteral nutritional treatment. RESULTS: Mean (95% CI) selenium concentration of the cohort increased significantly from 0.82 micromol/l (0.72, 0.91) to 1.14 micromol/l (0.98, 1.3), P<0.001. There were, however, significant reductions in mean concentrations of vitamin C {11.8 mg/l (7.7, 15.8) to 6.5 mg/l (4.5, 8.7), P=0.01} and vitamin E {11.3 mg/l (10.3, 12.4) to 9.4 mg/l (8.7, 10.1), P=0.03}. The concentrations of vitamin A, urates, glutathione and MDA did not change significantly over the study period. Glutamine supplementation did not have any significant effect on plasma antioxidant concentrations. CONCLUSIONS: Significant changes in circulating antioxidant concentrations occurred in children with active CD receiving exclusive enteral nutritional treatment. Glutamine supplementation was not beneficial in improving plasma antioxidant status.},

   abstract = {BACKGROUND: Prevention of relapse is a major issue in the management of Crohn's disease. Corticosteroids and 5-ASA preparations are not effective for the maintenance of remission. Methotrexate, infliximab, 6-mercaptopurine and its prodrug, azathioprine may be effective in maintaining remission, but these drugs may cause significant adverse events. OBJECTIVES: To conduct a systematic review to evaluate the efficacy of enteral nutrition for the maintenance of remission in Crohn's disease. SEARCH STRATEGY: MEDLINE (1966 to January 2007), EMBASE (1984 to January 2007) the Cochrane Central Register of Controlled Trials from the Cochrane Library (Issue 4, 2006) and the IBD/FBD Review Group Specialized Trials Register were searched. The articles cited in each publication were hand searched. SELECTION CRITERIA: Randomised controlled trials which compared enteral nutrition with no intervention, placebo or with any other intervention were eligible for inclusion. DATA COLLECTION AND ANALYSIS: Data extraction and assessment of methodological quality of included studies were independently performed by two authors. The main outcome measure was the occurrence of clinical or endoscopic relapse as defined by the primary studies. Odds ratios and 95% confidence intervals were calculated for dichotomous outcomes. MAIN RESULTS: Two studies were identified that met the inclusion criteria and were included in the review. Statistical pooling of the results of these studies was not possible because the control interventions, and the way outcomes were assessed differed greatly between the two studies. In one study (Takagi 2006), patients who received half of their total daily calorie requirements as elemental diet and the remaining half by normal diet had a significantly lower relapse rate compared to patients who received unrestricted normal diet (9 of 26 versus 16 of 25; OR 0.3, 95% CI 0.09 to 0.94). In the other study (Verma 2001), elemental and polymeric feeds (providing between 35 and 50% of patients' pretrial calorie intake in addition to unrestricted normal food) were equally effective for maintenance of remission and allowing withdrawal of steroid therapy (8 of 19 versus 6 of 14; OR 0.97, 95% CI 0.24 to 3.92). AUTHORS' CONCLUSIONS: The available evidence suggests that supplementary enteral nutritional may be effective for maintenance of remission in Crohn's disease. Whilst larger studies are needed to confirm these findings, enteral nutritional supplementation could be considered as an alternative or as an adjunct to maintenance drug therapy in Crohn's disease.},

   abstract = {BACKGROUND AND OBJECTIVES: The role of dietary factors in the etiology of Crohn's disease (CD) is inconsistent largely due to difficulties in acquiring valid information on consumption habits. We examined the impact of diet on new onset CD in children using a validated food-frequency questionnaire (FFQ). METHODOLOGY: A case-control study was carried out. Children < or =20 yr, newly diagnosed with CD, were recruited from 3 pediatric gastroenterology clinics across Canada. Population or hospital controls were selected matched to cases for time of diagnosis (+/-6 months) and area of residence. Dietary consumption 1 yr prior to disease diagnosis was evaluated using a validated FFQ, administered within 1 month of diagnosis. Conditional logistic regression analysis adjusting for potential confounding variables (energy intake, age, gender, body mass index) was carried out. RESULTS: A total of 130 CD patients and 202 controls were studied. Mean age at diagnosis (+/-SD) was 14.2 (2.7). There were more male patients (59%). Comparing the highest to the lowest levels of consumption, higher amounts of vegetables (OR 0.69, 95% CI 0.33-1.44, P= 0.03), fruits (OR 0.49, 95% CI 0.25-0.96, P= 0.02), fish (OR 0.46, 95% CI 0.20-1.06, P= 0.02), and dietary fiber (OR 0.12, 95% CI 0.04-0.37, P < 0.001) protected from CD. Consumption of long-chain omega-3 fatty acids (LCN-omega-3) was negatively associated with CD (OR 0.44, 95% CI 0.19-1.00, P < 0.001). A higher ratio of LCN-omega-3/omega-6 fatty acids was significantly associated with lower risks for CD (OR 0.32, 95% CI 0.14-0.71, P= 0.02). CONCLUSIONS: Our findings indicate that an imbalance in consumption of fatty acids, vegetables, and fruits is associated with increased risks for CD among Canadian children.},

   abstract = {Curcumin, a polyphenolic compound derived from dietary spice turmeric, possesses diverse pharmacologic effects including anti-inflammatory, antioxidant, antiproliferative and antiangiogenic activities. Phase I clinical trials have shown that curcumin is safe even at high doses (12 g/day) in humans but exhibit poor bioavailability. Major reasons contributing to the low plasma and tissue levels of curcumin appear to be due to poor absorption, rapid metabolism, and rapid systemic elimination. To improve the bioavailability of curcumin, numerous approaches have been undertaken. These approaches involve, first, the use of adjuvant like piperine that interferes with glucuronidation; second, the use of liposomal curcumin; third, curcumin nanoparticles; fourth, the use of curcumin phospholipid complex; and fifth, the use of structural analogues of curcumin (e.g., EF-24). The latter has been reported to have a rapid absorption with a peak plasma half-life. Despite the lower bioavailability, therapeutic efficacy of curcumin against various human diseases, including cancer, cardiovascular diseases, diabetes, arthritis, neurological diseases and Crohn's disease, has been documented. Enhanced bioavailability of curcumin in the near future is likely to bring this promising natural product to the forefront of therapeutic agents for treatment of human disease.},

T-RFLPs permit rapid comparisons of microbiota from many samples. AIM: To perform T-RFLP analyses of faecal microbiota in Crohn's disease (CD) patients to investigate potential alterations in faecal microbial communities and furthermore to analyse the effects of elemental diet on faecal microbiota profiles. METHODS: Thirty-four patients with CD and 30 healthy individuals were enrolled in the study. DNA was extracted from stool samples and 16S rRNA genes were amplified by PCR. PCR products were digested with BslI restriction enzymes and T-RF lengths were determined. RESULTS: Faecal microbial communities were classified into seven clusters. Almost all healthy individuals (28/30) were included in cluster I, II and III, but the majority of CD patients (25/34) could be divided into another four clusters (cluster IV-VII). Prediction of bacteria based on the BslI-digested T-RFLP database showed a significant decrease in Clostridium cluster IV, Clostridium cluster XI and subcluster XIVa in CD patients. In contrast, Bacteroides significantly increased in CD patients. Significant increases in Enterobacteriales were also observed in CD patients. Furthermore, elemental diets modulated faecal bacterial communities in CD patients. CONCLUSIONS: Terminal restriction fragment length polymorphism analyses showed that the diversity of faecal microbiota in patients with CD differed from that of healthy individuals. Furthermore, elemental diets modulated faecal microbiota composition, and this effect may be involved in mechanisms of clinical effects of elemental diet.},

   abstract = {Inflammatory bowel disease (IBD), ulcerative colitis (UC) and Crohn's disease (CD) are characterized by ongoing mucosal inflammation in which dysfunction of the host immunologic response against dietary factors and commensal bacteria is involved. The chronic inflammatory process leads to disruption of the epithelial barrier, and the formation of epithelial ulceration. This permits easy access for the luminal microbiota and dietary antigens to cells resident in the lamina propria, and stimulates further pathological immune cell responses. Cytokines are essential mediators of the interactions between activated immune cells and non-immune cells, including epithelial and mesenchymal cells. The clinical efficacy of targeting TNF-alpha clearly indicates that cytokines are the therapeutic targets in IBD patients. In this manuscript, we focus on the biological activities of recently-reported cytokines [Interleukin (IL)-17 cytokine family, IL-31 and IL-32], which might play a role through interaction with TNF-alpha in the pathophysiology of IBD.},

   abstract = {BACKGROUND & AIMS: Elemental diet (ED) is effective for human Crohn's disease (CD). Although some of this effectiveness may be due to its low antigenic load and low fat content, the mechanisms remain unclear. We sought to assess the role of histidine, one of the constituent amino acids of ED, in controlling colitis. METHODS: The interleukin (IL)-10-deficient (IL-10(-/-)) cell transfer model of colitis was used. SCID mice with colitis induced by transfer of IL-10(-/-) cells were maintained on experimented diets containing either single amino acids or a mixture. The severity of colitis was assessed by wet colon weight. Colonic tumor necrosis factor (TNF)-alpha messenger RNA (mRNA) expression was detected by quantitative reverse-transcription polymerase chain reaction. Mouse peritoneal macrophages were stimulated by lipopolysaccharides (LPS), with or without amino acids. The concentration of cytokines in the supernatant was determined by enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay. Inhibitor of nuclear factor (NF)-kappaB-alpha and nuclear p65 were confirmed by immunoblotting. RESULTS: In the IL-10(-/-) transfer model, dietary histidine, but not alanine, reduced histologic damage and colon weight and TNF-alpha mRNA expression. Histidine inhibited LPS-induced TNF-alpha and IL-6 production by mouse macrophages in a concentration-dependent manner, whereas alanine or histidine-related metabolites had no such effect. Histidine inhibited LPS-induced NF-kappaB in macrophages. CONCLUSIONS: These results showed that histidine could be a novel therapeutic agent for CD by inhibition of NF-kappaB activation, following down-regulation of proinflammatory cytokine production by macrophages. Thus, our studies provided new insights into the roles of amino acid metabolism in the pathophysiology of CD and for therapeutic strategies.},

   abstract = {BACKGROUND: The thiopurines, azathioprine (AZA) and mercaptopurine are extensively used in Crohn's discase (CD). Thiopurine bioactivation can be diverted by either thiopurine methyltransferase (TPMT), or by xanthine oxidase/dehydrogenase (XOD) which forms 6-thiouric acid (6TU). AIM: To investigate whether chronic inflammation could influence small intestinal XOD activity using urinary excretion of 6TU as a surrogate marker of XOD activity. METHODS: 6-Thiouric acid excretion was compared between 32 CD patients and nine dermatology patients (control group), on AZA. Six CD patients were interesting: five with low TPMT activity (one deficient, four intermediate), and one receiving AZA/allopurinol co-therapy. RESULTS: There was no statistical difference in 6TU excretion between the CD and control group. CD location, severity or surgery did not affect excretion. The TPMT-deficient patient excreted 89% of daily AZA dose as 6TU, but excretion by TPMT carriers was essentially normal. Concurrent 5-aminosalicylic acid therapy increased 6TU excretion significantly (median 32.9%), consistent with inhibiting TPMT. 6TU was undetectable in the patient on AZA/allopurinol co-therapy. CONCLUSIONS: The results refuted our hypothesis, but fitted a model where most of an oral thiopurine dose effectively escapes first-pass metabolism by gut XOD, but is heavily catabolized by TPMT. Bioavailability of thiopurines may be competitively inhibited by dietary purines.},

   abstract = {The pathogenesis of Crohn's disease (CD) and ulcerative colitis (UC) is not fully understood. The interaction between intestinal environmental factors of food and intestinal microbes and the immunological system of hosts seems to be an important aspect. We have reviewed the relationship of the daily consumption of dietary animal meat and fats, dairy products, sugar, and other factors that may be linked to the occurrence of CD and UC from the literature and Japanese epidemiological data. In the present study, we reviewed the association between food and intestinal microbes and other factors contributing to the occurence of inflammatory bowel disease (IBD) from epidemiological data and case-control studies of IBD in the literature that appeared on Medline, and assessed the reports of intestinal microbes involved in the occurrence of IBD. We found several papers describing the positive association of animal meat and sweets and sugar with the occurrence of CD and UC. An analysis of Japanese epidemiological data suggested that the registered number of patients with CD or UC started to increase more than 20 years after an increased daily consumption of dietary animal meat and fats, and milk and dairy products, and after a decreased consumption of rice. Many studies implied a positive role of intestinal microbes in the occurrence of IBD. Intestinal environmental factors, such as Westernized food and intestinal microbes, seem to be involved in the increased occurrence of IBD.},

   abstract = {Microbial agents are implicated in each of the most prevalent etiologic hypotheses of Crohn's disease. Although chronic infection with a specific, persistent pathogen cannot be excluded, it is more likely that Crohn's disease is caused by an overly aggressive immune response to normal commensal enteric bacteria. The complex, predominantly anaerobic microbiota in the distal ileum and colon provide a constant source of antigens and adjuvants that stimulate chronic immune-mediated inflammation in genetically susceptible hosts. Host genetic susceptibility in the form of defective mucosal barrier function, bacterial killing or processing can lead to enhanced exposure to luminal bacteria and their immunologically active components, whereas defective immunoregulation can lead to lack of appropriate immunosuppression. Either process can lead to overly aggressive T-cell responses to normal bacteria that causes tissue damage. Transient infection with pathogenic organisms could serve as environmental triggers to initiate inflammatory responses that are perpetuated in susceptible hosts by commensal microbial antigens. In addition, commensal bacteria such as Escherichia coli recovered from the ileum of patients with recurrent Crohn's disease after resection can contain virulence factors that mediate epithelial attachment, invasion, and resistance to killing. Finally, Western diet, antibiotic use, hygiene, and public health practices may have altered the balance of beneficial versus aggressive microbial species. Crohn's disease patients exhibit enhanced humoral and T-cell responses to common commensal bacterial and fungal antigens. These observations may help identify clinically relevant patient subsets and suggest novel therapeutic approaches to restore a beneficial balance of enteric microbiota, enhanced microbial killing, and inhibit aggressive T-cell responses to microbial antigens.},

   abstract = {BACKGROUND: Environmental factors of the modern Western lifestyle may trigger Crohn's disease (CD) in susceptible individuals. Because such factors could be part of ingested matter, we intended to improve intestinal Crohn's lesions by exclusion thereof. METHODS: At first we tested a highly restricted diet (based on spelt bread and red meat, both derived from intensively monitored organic farming) in 5 pilot cases. In a subsequent controlled trial, 18 patients with mild-to-moderate CD were randomly assigned to receive either this active diet or a control diet (low-fiber, low-fat, and high-carbohydrate). Mucosal improvement was assessed by magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) and endoscopy. Secondary endpoints included sonography, the Crohn's Disease Activity Index (CDAI), and the Inflammatory Bowel Disease Questionnaire (IBDQ). RESULTS: Four of 5 pilot patients showed significant improvement within 4 weeks. From 18 patients in the controlled trial, 8 were randomized to the active and 10 to the control group; 4 decided to quit immediately after dietary counseling, 3 in the active and 1 in the control group (P = 0.183). At 6 weeks MRI and endoscopy showed improvement of intestinal lesions in 3 of 4 assessable patients of the active group and 1 of 9 patients of the control group (P = 0.027). Sonography showed improvement in 4 of 5 patients of the active group and in 1 of 8 assessable patients of the control group (P = 0.016). CDAI and IBDQ improved in both groups to a similar extent. CONCLUSIONS: Ingested matter as part of the modern Western lifestyle may cause persistence of intestinal Crohn's lesions.},

METHODS: In an open label pilot study, we supple-mented a group of 25 patients (11 with Crohn's disease and 14 with ulcerative colitis) in stable clinical conditions and chronic anemia with a food supplement which does not contain iron but contains a standardized fraction of fish cartilage glycosaminoglycans and a mixture of antioxidants (Captafer Medestea, Turin, Italy). Patients received 500 mg, twice a day during meals, for at least 4 mo. Patients were suggested to maintain their alimentary habit. At time 0 and after 2 and 4 mo, emocrome, sideremia and ferritin were examined. Paired data were analyzed with Student's t test. RESULTS: Three patients relapsed during the study (2 in the 3rd mo, 1 in the 4th mo), two patients were lost to follow up and two patients dropped out (1 for orticaria, 1 for gastric burning). Of the remaining 18 patients, levels of serum iron started to rapidly increase within the 2nd mo of treatment, P < 0.05), whereas serum ferritin and hemoglobin needed a longer period to significantly improve their serum levels (mo 4) P < 0.05. The product was safe, easy to administer and well tolerated by patients. CONCLUSION: These data suggest a potential new treatment for IBD patients with iron deficiency chronic anemia and warrant further larger controlled studies.},

In view of the rising incidence of CD in India we planned this study to assess the nutritional status of patients with CD. METHODS: Nutritional status of 112 patients (mean age 35.9 [SD 11.7] years; 61 men) with CD was assessed by anthropometric, dietary and biochemical parameters. Patients were considered malnourished if 3 or more anthropometric parameters (% ideal body weight [IBW], % tricep skin fold [TSF], %mid upper arm circumference [MUAC], and % mid arm muscle circumference [MAMC], body mass index [BMI]) were abnormal. Dietary intake was assessed by a 24-hour dietary recall along with a semi-quantitative food frequency method. Eighty volunteers were taken as healthy controls (HC). RESULTS: At the time of assessment, 77 patients were in remission and 35 had active disease. The values of BMI, MUAC, TSF and mid arm fat area (MAFA) in patients were significantly lower than those in healthy controls. MAMC and mid arm muscle area (MAMA) of patients and controls were comparable. TSF (Rem vs HC = 10.4 [2.8-71] vs 16 [3-41]) and MAFA (Rem vs HC = 1236 [240-7757] vs 1858 [322-5650]) of the patients in the remission phase were significantly lower than those of healthy controls; the remaining parameters were comparable. There was no difference in the dietary intake of patients in the remission and active phases, and healthy controls. The percentage energy fulfillment of the patients was lower than that of healthy controls. Twenty-nine of 35 (82.8%) patients in the active and 30 of 77 (38.9%) patients in the remission phase were malnourished (OR 7.5, 95% CI 2.8-20.4). The overall prevalence of malnutrition was 52.6% among patients. CONCLUSION: The percentage of malnourished patients in the active and remission phases of the disease was 82.8% and 38.9%, respectively, possibly due to low percentage energy fulfillment.},

TGFbeta1 dysregulation has been observed in several chronic human diseases, including ulcerative colitis, Crohn's disease and colon carcinoma. In the first two conditions, a marked oxidative stress is consistently present, while in the third one, levels of reactive oxygen species tend to be significantly lower than in the surrounding normal tissue. Lipid-derived compounds such as the aldehyde 4-hydroxynonenal (HNE) or cholesterol oxidation products (oxysterols) were shown able to induce expression and synthesis of TGFbeta1, an event which can be detrimental or beneficial, essentially depending on its actual intensity. Understanding how specific dietary lipids may influence the complex molecular signaling underlying this cytokine expression, may provide new indications for therapeutic and preventive strategies in inflammatory bowel diseases and colon carcinoma.},

   abstract = {Carrageenan is a high molecular weight sulfated polygalactan used to improve the texture of commercial food products. Its use increased markedly during the last half century, although carrageenan is known to induce inflammation in rheumatological models and in intestinal models of colitis. We performed studies to determine its direct effects on human intestinal cells, including normal human intestinal epithelial cells from colonic surgeries, the normal intestinal epithelial cell line NCM460, and normal rat ileal epithelial cells. Cells were treated with high molecular weight lambda-carrageenan at a concentration of 1 mug/ml for 1-96 h. IL-8, IL-8 promoter activity, total and nuclear NF-kappaB, IkappaBalpha, phospho-IkappaBalpha, and Bcl10 were assessed by immunohistochemistry, Western blot, ELISA, and cDNA microarray. Increased Bcl10, nuclear and cytoplasmic NF-kappaB, IL-8 promoter activation, and IL-8 secretion were detected following carrageenan exposure. Knockdown of Bcl10 by siRNA markedly reduced the increase in IL-8 that followed carrageenan exposure in the NCM460 cells. These results show, for the first time, that exposure of human intestinal epithelial cells to carrageenan triggers a distinct inflammatory pathway via activation of Bcl10 with NF-kappaB activation and upregulation of IL-8 secretion. Since Bcl10 contains a caspase-recruitment domain, similar to that found in NOD2/CARD15 and associated with genetic predisposition to Crohn's disease, the study findings may represent a link between genetic and environmental etiologies of inflammatory bowel disease. Because of the high use of carrageenan as a food additive in the diet, the findings may have clinical significance.},

Seal and fish oils are rich in n-3 polyunsaturated fatty acids, and possibly therefore high doses of nasoduodenally administered seal oil rapidly relieved inflammatory bowel disease (IBD)-associated joint pain in two recent studies. In the present study, we compared the effects of short-term oral administration of seal oil and cod liver oil on IBD-related joint pain, leucotriene B(4) level, serum fatty acid profile and IBD activity. METHODS: Thirty-eight patients with IBD-related joint pain were included in the study; 21 had Crohn's disease and 17 ulcerative colitis. Ten milliters of seal oil (n=18) or cod liver oil (n=20) was self-administered orally 3 times a day for 14 days before meals in a double-blind setting. RESULTS: There were no significant differences between the two intervention groups or between Crohn's disease and ulcerative colitis patients. There was a tendency toward improvement in several joint pain parameters after both seal oil and cod liver oil administration. Further, plasma leucotriene B(4) concentration, serum Sigma n-6 to Sigma n-3, and arachidonic acid (20:4n-6) to eicosapentaenoic acid (20:5n-3) ratios were similarly reduced after administration of seal oil and cod liver oil. CONCLUSION: No significant differences in the two treatment groups were seen; in both groups, the changes in several joint pain parameters, leucotriene B(4) level of plasma, and serum fatty acid profile were putatively favourable.},

These are taken up by M cells, accumulate in gut macrophages, and may influence the aetiology of inflammatory bowel diseases (IBD). MATERIALS: We investigated the effects of common dietary microparticles on the function of macrophages from healthy donors or active Crohn's disease (CD) patients. METHODS: Macrophages were incubated for 24 h with microparticles before being assayed for cytokine production and phagocytic activity. RESULTS: Microparticles alone were non-stimulatory but, in the presence of bacterial antigens such as LPS, they could act as adjuvants to induce potent cytokine responses. Uptake of high concentrations of microparticles also impaired macrophage phagocytic capacity - but not their ability - to take up 2microM fluorescent beads. CONCLUSIONS: While dietary microparticles alone have limited effects on basic macrophage functions, their ability to act as adjuvants could aggravate ongoing inflammatory responses towards bacterial antigens in the GI tract.},

The criteria for differentiating IBD from other diseases with similar clinical presentation is unclear. We describe 16 patients who, between 1984 and 2004, received a histological diagnosis of IBD during the first two years of life. Six patients presented with histological Crohn's disease, eight with ulcerative colitis and two with indeterminate colitis. The median age at diagnosis was 125 days (range 1 day to 18 months) and the medium follow up was 89 months (range 65 days to 20 years). The disease appeared to be very severe: four children (25%) underwent total parenteral nutrition (TPN), two received colectomy (12.5%) and three patients died. Many of the patients required an aggressive, multidrug, immunosuppressive approach (azathioprine [AZA], Infliximab, thalidomide, cyclosporine A). One child presented with a hypogammaglobulinaemia without any specific immunodeficiency, while in the other patients, Wiskott-Aldrich syndrome (WAS) (4 cases) and chronic granulomatous disease (CGD) (2 cases) were identified. In 6/16 cases, allergic colitis was first considered; these cases initially underwent cow's milk protein-free diet as the only therapy before IBD was finally diagnosed. In conclusion, early IBD has a severe prognosis and often needs an aggressive therapeutic approach. Furthermore, an improper diagnosis of allergic colitis might cause an important diagnostic delay. Some severe immunodeficiencies, such as WAS and CGD, may represent a problem in terms of differential diagnosis and might be wrongly diagnosed as very early onset IBD.},

   abstract = {Alterations in autophagy leading to a defective intracellular response to low-level invasive bacteria are considered a major recent advance in the pathogenesis of Crohn's disease. A genome-wide association study has shown an association of Crohn's disease with the autophagy related 16-like 1 gene. A second autophagy gene, the immunity-related Guanosine triphosfatase, has also been found to be significantly associated with Crohn's disease. The enteric flora of Crohn's disease patients includes, more commonly than controls, strains of adherent/invasive E. coli. The high level of adherent/invasive E. coli colonizing the intestinal mucosa of patients with Crohn's disease strongly suggests that it may play an important role in the aetiopathogenesis of the disease. E. coli strains are able to cross the mucosal barrier, survive within macrophages and induce the secretion of TNFalpha and the formation of granuloma. Recently it has been clearly shown that Crohn's disease patients have a defective mucosal macrophage killing activity resulting in increased exposure to commensal bacteria and activation of T cells. However, the hypothesis of macrophages dysfunction in the pathogenesis of Crohn's disease was already suggested in 1977 by M. Ward, who introduced the concept of the "dyspeptic macrophage", consisting of an inability to degrade a variety of phagocytosed normal gut dietary and microbial luminal constituents. Defective autophagy and dyspeptic macrophages seems therefore indicate the same pathogenetic mechanism. What is really new is the demonstration that this impaired macrophage function is genetically determined.},

   abstract = {BACKGROUND: Inulin and oligofructose promote selective growth of saccharolytic bacteria with low inflammatory potential. OBJECTIVE: To test the effect of oligofructose-enriched inulin in patients with active ulcerative colitis. DESIGN: Prospective, randomized, placebo controlled pilot trial. Eligible patients had been previously in remission with mesalazine as maintenance therapy or no drug, and presented with a relapse of mild to moderate activity. They were treated with mesalazine (3 g/day) and randomly allocated to receive either oligofructose-enriched inulin (12 g/day, p.o., n = 10) or placebo (12 g/day of maltodextrin, p.o., n = 9) for 2 week. Primary endpoint was the anti-inflammatory effect as determined by reduction of calprotectin and human DNA in faeces. RESULTS: Rachmilewitz score decreased in both groups, reaching statistical significance at day 14 (P < 0.05). Oligofructose-enriched inulin was well-tolerated and dyspeptic symptoms scale decreased significantly with active treatment but not with placebo. At day 7, an early significant reduction of calprotectin was observed in the group receiving oligofructose-enriched inulin (day 0: 4377 +/- 659 microg/g; day 7: 1033 +/- 393 microg/g, P < 0.05) but not in the placebo group (day 0: 5834 +/- 1563 microg/g; day 7: 4084 +/- 1395 microg/g, n.s.). Changes in faecal concentration of human DNA were not significant. CONCLUSION: In active ulcerative colitis, dietary supplementation with oligofructose-enriched inulin is well tolerated and is associated with early reduction in faecal calprotectin.},

   abstract = {In order to increase dietary folic acid intake and to improve nutritional status regarding folate by controlling homocysteine concentrations, ten patients with inflammatory bowel diseases (Crohn's disease in the colon and ulcerative colitis) received individualized nutritional guidance and were followed up as outpatients for 2 months. The following procedures were performed at the beginning of the study (T0), after 1 month (T1) and at the end of the study (T2): collection of anthropometric data (weight and height), dietary data (24 h diet recall), and blood under fasting condition for the determination of serum folic acid, homocysteine, C-reactive protein, and vitamin B12. Plasma folic acid deficiency was not detected but hyperhomocysteinemia was present in six individuals and C-reactive protein (CRP) was increased (>0.5 mg/dl) in seven patients. After the patients were instructed there was a significant increase in vitamin B6 intake (about 35%) and in folate intake (49.6%). Mean plasma levels of folic acid, homocysteine, and vitamin B12 did not change, but there was a significant decrease of CRP at T1, 0.36 mg dl(-1) on average (P = 0.01), which was maintained at T2. We conclude that the increased folate intake reported by this group of patients was not reflected in improved serum concentrations of folic acid and homocysteine. However, the guidelines for the patients probably induced them to choose a more adequate diet, providing nutrients that help control the inflammatory process.},

The role of in situ and remote inflammation in atherosclerosis is a major area of interest. In this study, we compared ASCA IgG and IgA levels in acute myocardial infarction (AMI) and controls to investigate the possible role of ASCA in AMI. METHODS: Serum samples were obtained from 140 consecutive patients who presented to the emergency department with acute chest pain. AMI was diagnosed by electrocardiography and serial enzymes. Patients ruled out for acute coronary event were grouped as controls. ASCA IgA and IgG levels were determined using enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay. Groups were compared for statistically significant difference. RESULTS: ASCA IgG titers ranged between 0.1 and 31.0 RIU/mL (mean 4.92) in the AMI group and 0.1 and 6.0 (mean 0.84) in the controls. The groups were found to differ very significantly (p = .001). ASCA IgA titers ranged between 2.0 and 200.0 RIU/mL (mean 13.73) in the AMI group and 2.0 and 11.5 RIU/mL, (mean 4.25) in controls. The groups differed significantly (p = .32). AMI and controls were also analyzed for ASCA IgA and IgG positivity. Both groups differed significantly from controls (p = .013). CONCLUSION: Elevated ASCA IgA and IgG levels as well as ASCA positivity in the AMI might suggest use of ASCA as a marker for atherosclerotic plaque instability. It might also provide a link between inflammatory processes and increased cardiovascular risk. Further studies are needed on a Saccharomyces cerevisiae-based diet, related intestinal colonization, and associated inflammation, autoimmune disorders, and cardiovascular events.},

   abstract = {PURPOSE: Since folate is associated with a reduced risk of colorectal cancer, we hypothesized that folic acid antagonists might increase the risk. We used data from a population-based case control study of medication use and colorectal cancer to evaluate the hypothesis. METHODS: Case patients with adenocarcinoma of the colon or rectum were ascertained from participating hospitals in Massachusetts and the Massachusetts cancer registry (MCR) from January 1, 2001, through November 30, 2004. Age-, sex-, and precinct-matched control subjects were chosen from Massachusetts town lists. Information on folic acid antagonist use and other relevant data were obtained from 1809 cases and 1809 matched controls by telephone interview and by a self-administered dietary questionnaire. We used logistic regression models to estimate odds ratios among 1229 case patients and 1165 control subjects who provided satisfactory dietary information and did not have Crohn's disease or ulcerative colitis. RESULTS: The odds ratio for colorectal cancer among regular users of folate-containing supplements was 0.7 (95%CI 0.6-0.9). The odds ratio for regular use of folic acid antagonists was 1.3 (95%CI 0.9-1.9). Contrary to expectation, the odds ratio was reduced in the highest category of alcohol consumption (OR = 0.5, 95%CI 0.2-1.2). The odds ratio was higher among users of drugs that inhibit dihydrofolate reductase (OR = 1.6, 95%CI 0.9-2.8) than drugs that work through other mechanisms (OR = 1.2, 95%CI 0.7-1.9). CONCLUSIONS: Our data provide little support for the hypothesis that regular folic acid antagonist use increases the risk of colorectal cancer. However, there is a suggestion that dihydrofolate reductase inhibitors specifically may increase the risk.},

   abstract = {Ulcerative colitis (UC) is a form of chronic inflammatory bowel disease (IBD) that almost always affects the rectal mucosa and variable length of the colon in continuity and at times mucosa of the entire colon. It is not caused by any specific pathogen. Genetics, environmental factors and altered immune responses to dietary macromolecules, colonic bacteria and cellular proteins have been implicated in the pathogenesis of UC. Autoimmune response against cytoskeletal, microfilament protein tropomyosin (Tm) seems to play an important role in the pathogenesis of UC. The predominant colonic epithelial Tm isoform, hTm5, can induce both humoral (B-cells) and cellular (T-cells) response in patients with UC. Such responses are not seen in normal subjects and disease control subjects, such as patients with Crohn's disease (CD, another type of IBD) and patients with lupus. A novel observation that hTm5 is expressed on colon epithelial cell surface but not on small intestinal epithelial cells provides evidence for presentation to immune effector cells. This surface expression of hTm5 seems to be facilitated by a colon epithelial cell membrane associated protein, CEP, that acts as a chaperone for the trans-migration of hTm5 to the surface and both hTm5 and CEP are then released outside the cell. Both CEP and hTm5 expression are increased with pro-inflammatory cytokine, such as gamma-interferon. hTm5 expression in UC mucosa is also significantly increased compared to normal. Finally, autoantibodies against hTm5 observed both in circulation and in the colon mucosa of patients with UC are pathogenic causing colon epithelial cell destruction by antibody and complement mediated cytolysis.},

   abstract = {BACKGROUND: Some dietary foods are considered protective (vegetables and fruits), whereas others (fatty foods) are thought to enhance the risk for Crohn's disease (CD). The evidence, however, is inconsistent. METHODS: We postulated that specific dietary patterns may influence the risk for CD. A case-control study was carried out. Newly diagnosed CD cases with population and/or hospital-based controls < or =20 years were selected from 3 tertiary hospitals across Canada. Pre-disease diet was assessed using a validated food frequency questionnaire (FFQ) administered within 1 month of diagnosis. Factor analyses and unconditional logistic regression (adjusted) was used to determine gender-specific dietary patterns and assess associated risks for CD. Odds ratios (ORs) and corresponding 95% confidence intervals (95% CIs) were estimated. RESULTS: A total of 149 cases and 251 controls were included. The mean age (range) of the cases was 13.3 (2.6-20 years). There were more boys (61.1%). Four dietary patterns each were observed among both boys and girls. Pattern 1 in girls, characterized by meats, fatty foods, and desserts, was positively associated with CD (OR 4.7, 95% CI 1.6-14.2). Pattern 2, common to both boys and girls, was characterized by vegetables, fruits, olive oil, fish, grains, and nuts and was inversely associated with CD in both genders (girls: OR 0.3, 95% CI 0.1-0.9; boys: OR 0.2, 95% CI 0.1-0.5). CONCLUSIONS: Our results suggest that specific dietary patterns could be associated with higher or lower risks for CD in children. Larger prospective studies are required to confirm these findings.},

Klebsiella microbes were suggested to have a vital role in the initiation and perpetuation of the disease through the mechanism of molecular mimicry. This proposition is based on the results of various studies where significantly elevated levels of antibodies against the whole bacteria or preparations from Klebsiella microbes and antibodies to collagen types I, III, IV, and V were detected in patients with CD and patients with ankylosing spondylitis (AS). Molecular similarities were found between Klebsiella nitrogenase and HLA-B27 genetic markers and between Klebsiella pullulanase and collagen fibers types I, III, and IV. Furthermore, significantly positive correlations and cross-reactivity binding activities were observed between anti-Klebsiella and anticollagen antibodies among patients with CD and AS. Early treatment of CD patients with anti-Klebsiella measures is proposed, which may involve the use of antibiotics and low starch diet together with other traditionally used immunomodulatory, immunosuppressive, or biologic agents.},

   abstract = {Nutrigenomics has the potential to tailor diets to optimize health, based on knowledge of key genetic polymorphisms. Identification of candidate genes is often based on a priori knowledge of disease processes. However, genome-wide association methods are not only validating previously identified genes and polymorphisms, but also revealing new gene-disease associations not anticipated from prior knowledge. In Crohn's disease (CD), such studies not only confirm the importance of caspase-activated recruitment domain 15 and major histocompatibility complex II molecules, but also reveal strong associations with the proinflammatory cytokine interleukin-23 receptor and autophagy-related 16-like gene. Genes identified to date in CD can be linked into two interrelated pathways: receptor-mediated cytokine induction or autophagocytosis. New genomic technologies need to be matched with innovative methodologies to characterize the likely impact of foods and to take the field to another dimension of value for human diet development and optimized health.},

   abstract = {Celiac disease is a gluten-dependent small intestinal mucosal disorder that causes malabsorption, often with diarrhea and weight loss. Diagnosis is based on detection of typical biopsy changes in the proximal small bowel, followed by evidence for an unequivocal response to a gluten-free diet. Refractoriness in celiac disease may be due to poor diet compliance, sometimes intentional, or consumption of ubiquitious sources of gluten. Alternatively, the original diagnosis may not be correct (eg., duodenal Crohn's disease), or a second cause for symptoms may be present (eg., collagenous colitis, functional bowel disorder). In some with recurrent symptoms, a complication may be present (eg., collagenous sprue, small bowel carcinoma, lymphoma). In some, a response to a gluten-free diet can not be unequivocally defined, and more precise historical terms have been used including "sprue-like intestinal disease" or "unclassified sprue". Although a "wastebasket diagnosis", these likely represent a heterogeneous group, and some, but not all, may develop lymphoma. Precise definition will be critical in the future as an array of new treatments, including biological agents, may emerge.},

   abstract = {OBJECTIVE: Functional gut symptoms are common in patients with inflammatory bowel disease (IBD). Since poorly absorbed, short-chain carbohydrates (FODMAPs) appear to play an important role in the induction of functional gut symptoms, we aimed to determine the effect of their dietary restriction on abdominal symptoms in patients with stable IBD and to examine factors associated with success of and adherence to the diet. MATERIAL AND METHOD: 52 consecutive patients with Crohn's disease and 20 with ulcerative colitis who received dietary advice at least 3 months prior at a gastrointestinal dietetic service in Victoria, Australia, underwent a retrospective telephone questionnaire. Information gathered included patient demographics, recall of dietary advice, dietary adherence, and change in gastrointestinal symptoms. RESULTS: Up to 70% of patients were adherent to the diet. Approximately one in two patients responded (defined as improvement of at least 5 out of 10 in overall symptoms). Overall abdominal symptoms, abdominal pain, bloating, wind and diarrhoea improved in patients with Crohn's disease and ulcerative colitis (p<0.02 for all), but constipation did not. For Crohn's disease, efficacy was associated with dietary adherence (p= 0.033) and inefficacy with non-adherence (p=0.013). Sustained response was associated with post-secondary education and working 35 h per week or less (p<0.03). CONCLUSIONS: These data suggest that reduction of FODMAP intake offers an efficacious strategy for patients with IBD who have concurrent functional gut symptoms. A controlled dietary intervention trial is indicated.},

   abstract = {The endocannabinoid system is an ancient lipid signaling network which in mammals modulates neuronal functions, inflammatory processes, and is involved in the aetiology of certain human lifestyle diseases, such as Crohn's disease, atherosclerosis and osteoarthritis. The system is able to downregulate stress-related signals that lead to chronic inflammation and certain types of pain, but it is also involved in causing inflammation-associated symptoms, depending on the physiological context. The cannabinoid type-2 (CB(2)) receptor, which unlike the CB(1) receptor does not induce central side effects, has been shown to be a promising therapeutic target. While CB(1) receptor antagonists/inverse agonists are of therapeutic value, also CB(2) receptor ligands including agonists are of pharmacological interest. Although the endocannabinoid system is known to be involved in the regulation of energy homoeostasis and metabolism (mainly via CB(1) receptors) there was hitherto no direct link between food intake and cannabinoid receptor activation. Our recent finding that beta-caryophyllene, a ubiquitous lipohilic plant natural product, selectively binds to the CB(2) receptor and acts as a full agonist is unexpected. Maybe even more unexpected is that oral administration of this dietary compound exerts potent anti-inflammatory effects in wild type mice but not in CB(2) receptor (Cnr2(-/-)) knockout mice. Like other CB(2) ligands also beta-caryophyllene inhibits the pathways triggered by activation of the toll-like receptor complex CD14/TLR4/MD2, which typically lead to the expression of proinflammatory cytokines (IL-1beta, IL-6; IL-8 and TNFalpha) and promotes a TH(1) immune response. In this addendum, the CB(2) receptor-dependent effect of beta-caryophyllene on LPS-triggered activation of the kinases Erk1/2 and JNK1/2 are further discussed with respect to the possibility that both CB(2) inverse agonists and agonists, independent of their G-protein signaling, may block LPS-triggered activation of MAPKs, leading to inhibition of proinflammatory cytokine expression and attenuation of inflammation.},

   abstract = {BACKGROUND: Patients with inflammatory bowel disease (IBD) are often under nourished. Though there are several studies evaluating nutrition in patients with IBD from the developed world, the data from developing countries are scanty, where under nutrition is predominant. METHOD: 62 patients with IBD (55 ulcerative colitis [UC] and 7 Crohn's disease [CD] patients) and 42 healthy subjects (HS) were evaluated for nutrition using dietary survey, anthropometric and biochemical parameters. RESULTS: Of the patients with IBD, 23 (37%) had active disease and 39 (63%) were in remission. Daily intake of calories (1725 Kcal/d [500-2458] vs. 2239 Kcal/d [1835-3000], p<0.0001), protein (40 g/d [19-96] vs. 50 g/d [29-73], p=0.001) and iron (9 mg/d [1-16] vs. 12 mg/d [9-16], p<0.0001) and anthropometric parameters of nutrition such as body mass index (BMI) (19.8 [13.7-27.5] vs. 23 [17.9-27.2], <0.0001), biceps (0.3 mm [0.1-1.9] vs. 0.5 mm [0.2-1.0], p<0.0001) and triceps (0.7 mm [0.2-2.9] vs. 1.2 mm [0.5-2.3], p<0.0001) skin fold thickness (BSF, TSF) and mid-arm muscle circumference (MAMC, 25.9 mm [15-35] vs. 26.8 mm [23-32] <0.04) were lower among the IBD patients than among the HS. Though patients with CD had a lower level of haemoglobin (median 9.2 g vs. 10.8 g, respectively; p<0.05) and serum total protein (median 6 g, range 3-7 vs. 7 g, range 3-9, respectively; p<0.05), serum albumin, BMI, BSF and TSF thicknesses, MAMC and daily intake of protein, calories, calcium and iron were comparable between UC and CD patients. Though daily dietary intake was comparable between patients with active disease and those in remission yet patients with active disease had lower BMI, MAMC and serum protein level. CONCLUSION: Under nutrition is common in patients with IBD, particularly in those with acute exacerbation.},

MAP infections have not been reliably detected in dogs, but a reemerging debate about the link between MAP and Crohn's disease has renewed interest about the occurrence of MAP in pets. HYPOTHESIS: This study was undertaken to examine canine intestinal biopsies for the presence of MAP-specific DNA. ANIMALS: Forty-two dogs with chronic vomiting, diarrhea, or both; and 14 dogs with no gastrointestinal disease. METHODS: All dogs with signs of gastrointestinal disease had a standard work-up for chronic gastrointestinal disease. Endoscopically obtained intestinal biopsies were submitted for histopathologic and molecular investigations. Biopsies were screened for MAP-specific DNA by 3 polymerase chain reaction (PCR) methods (nested, seminested, and triplex real-time PCR). Samples from control dogs were obtained during necropsy. RESULTS: Histopathology of the biopsies was indicative of inflammatory bowel disease (IBD) in 17 and neoplasia in 6 dogs. Six dogs showing nonspecific changes responded to diet and were classified as having food-responsive enteropathy. In 13 dogs a final diagnosis was not established. MAP-specific DNA was detected and confirmed by sequencing in 8 dogs (19%). These dogs were diagnosed with food-responsive enteropathy (n=3), IBD (n=2), and open diagnosis (n=3). MAP-specific DNA was not detected in dogs with no gastrointestinal disease. CONCLUSIONS AND CLINICAL IMPORTANCE: MAP-specific DNA was detected in approximately one fifth of dogs with chronic gastrointestinal disease and might play a role as a pathogenic agent. Apart from animal welfare, the zoonotic aspect warrants further studies addressing the viability of MAP organism in canine intestinal biopsies by culture.},

The information currently available does not provide an exact explanation about the origin of this important dysfunction of the interaction between host and commensal bacteria, but an altered microbial composition has been detected in the gut ecosystem of patients with Crohn's disease or ulcerative colitis. Prebiotics are food ingredients not digested nor absorbed in the upper intestinal tract that are fermented by intestinal bacteria in a selective way promoting changes in the gut ecosystem. Experimental and human studies have shown that inulin and oligofructose stimulate saccharolysis in the colonic lumen and favour the growth of indigenous lactobacilli and bifidobacteria. These effects are associated with reduced mucosal inflammation in animal models of IBD. Strong experimental evidence supports the hypothesis that inulin and oligofructose can offer an opportunity to prevent or mitigate intestinal inflammatory lesions in human Crohn's disease, ulcerative colitis, and pouchitis. Encouraging results have been obtained in preliminary clinical trials.},

It is not known whether this is true for adolescents with inactive Crohn disease, when rate of protein synthesis must be greater than that of breakdown for normal development. The objective of this study was to determine whether enteral nutrition acutely suppresses proteolysis and increases protein synthesis in adolescents with inactive Crohn disease. Six adolescents (five males/one female; mean age, 15.8 +/- 1.9 y; range, 13.2-17.6 y; mean bone age, 14.6 +/- 1.8 y; range, 12.5-17 y) participated. Leucine (Leu) and phenylalanine (Phe) kinetics were measured using stable isotopes under fasted and fed conditions during a single study visit. In response to enteral nutrition, the endogenous rates of appearance (Ra) of Leu and Phe (reflecting proteolysis) decreased significantly by 40%. The percentages of splanchnic uptake of Leu and Phe were 35 +/- 10% and 13 +/- 12%, respectively. Under fed conditions, utilization of Phe for protein synthesis increased significantly. We conclude that in clinically stable adolescents with Crohn disease, enteral nutrition promotes anabolism by suppressing proteolysis and increasing protein synthesis. Rates of suppression of proteolysis were similar to those reported previously in normal children.},

OBJECTIVES: To summarize the experience of several pediatric gastroenterology units in Israel using a TGFbeta2-enriched polymeric diet (Modulen IBD) supplementation in children and adolescents with Crohn's disease. METHODS: In a retrospective study we reviewed the charts of 28 children with Crohn's disease (10 girls, 18 boys) who received, in addition to conventional treatment, Modulen IBD as a supplement to their regular nutrition. These children were compared with 18 children supplemented with standard polymeric formula (Ensure Plus) and 18 children without formula supplementation. We recorded clinical manifestations, growth, and the Pediatric Crohn's Disease Activity Index before and after initiation of the polymeric diet. RESULTS: The Modulen-treated children showed a significant decrease in PCDAI from 34.3 to 15.7 (P< 0.0001). A significant decrease in PCDAI was recorded also in the Ensure Plus group, from 35 to 22 (P= 0.02) but not in the non-supplemented group. Significant improvements in body mass index (P = 0.01) and erythrocyte sedimentation rate (P= 0.03) were recorded at follow-up (median 3.4 months) only in the Modulen IBD group. CONCLUSIONS: In this cohort of children with Crohn's disease, supplementation of the diet with Modulen IBD as well as supplementation with Ensure Plus was associated with a decrease in PCDAI. The children supplemented with Modulen IBD also showed improvement in BMI, suggesting an additional advantage of nutritional therapy in children with this disease.},

   abstract = {Around 1 in 4 patients with inflammatory bowel disease (IBD) present in childhood, the majority around the time of their pubertal growth spurt. This presents challenges over and above those of managing IBD in adults as this period is a time of dramatic psychological and physical transition for a child. Growth and nutrition are key priorities in the management of adolescents and young adults with IBD. Growth failure in IBD is characterized by delayed skeletal maturation and a delayed onset of puberty, and is best described in terms of height-for-age standard deviation score (Z score) or by variations in growth velocity over a period of 3-4 months. Growth failure is common at presentation in Crohn's disease (CD), but less common in ulcerative colitis (UC). The etiology of growth failure is multifactorial. Principal determinants, however, include the inflammatory process per se, with proinflammatory cytokines (e.g., IL-1beta, IL-6) being directly implicated. Furthermore, poor nutrition and the consequences of prolonged corticosteroid use also contribute to the significant reduction in final adult height of almost 1 in 5 children. Initially a prompt, where possible steroid-free, induction of remission is indicated. The ideal is then to sustain a relapse-free remission until growth is complete, which is often not until early adulthood. These goals can often be achieved with a combination of exclusive enteral nutrition (EEN) and early use of immunosuppressants. The advent of potent and efficacious biological agents considerably improves the range of growth-sparing interventions available to children around puberty, although well-timed surgery remains another highly effective means of achieving remission and significant catch-up growth. We carried out a systematic review of publications to identify the best available evidence for managing growth failure in children with IBD. Despite the paucity of high-quality publications, sufficient data were available in the literature to allow practical, evidence-based where possible, management guidelines to be formulated. Although there is clear evidence that exclusive enteral nutrition achieves mucosal healing, its effect on growth has only been assessed at 6 months. In contrast to corticosteroids, EEN has no negative effect on growth. Corticosteroids remain the key therapy responsible for medication-induced growth impairment, although the use of budesonide in selected patients may minimize the steroid effect on dividing growth plates. Immunosuppressants have become a mainstay of treatment in children with IBD, and are being used earlier in the disease course than ever before. However, there are currently no long-term data reporting better growth outcome if these agents are introduced very soon after diagnosis. In comparison, recent data from a large prospective trial of infliximab in children with moderate to severe CD suggested significant catch-up growth during the first year of regular infusions. The only other intervention that has documented clear catch-up growth has been surgical resection. Resection of localized CD, in otherwise treatment-resistant children, early in the disease process achieves clear catch-up growth within the next 6 months. There are no data available that growth hormone improves final adult height in children with CD. In conjunction with expert endocrinological support, pubertal delay, more common in boys, may be treated with parenteral testosterone if causing significant psychological problems. The optimal management of children and adolescents requires a multidisciplinary approach frequently available within the pediatric healthcare setting. Dedicated dietetic support, along with nurse-specialist, child psychologist, and with closely linked medical and surgical care will likely achieve the best possible start for children facing a lifetime of chronic gut disease.},

   abstract = {BACKGROUND: Folate is postulated to protect against cell injury and long-term risk of cancer. Folate deficiency has been shown to be associated with inflammatory bowel disease (IBD). However, folate concentrations are poorly delineated in children with IBD. OBJECTIVE: The objective was to compare folate concentrations between children with newly diagnosed IBD and healthy controls. DESIGN: Red blood cell folate (RBCF) and whole-blood folate (WBF) concentrations were measured in 78 children (mean age: 12.8 +/- 2.7 y): 22 patients with newly diagnosed untreated Crohn disease, 11 patients with ulcerative colitis, 4 patients with indeterminate colitis, and 41 controls. Vitamin supplementation and dietary intakes determined by food-frequency questionnaire were recorded for 20 IBD patients and 28 controls. RESULTS: RBCF concentrations were 19.4% lower in controls (587.0 +/- 148.6 ng/mL) than in patients (728.7 +/- 185.8 ng/mL; P = 0.0004), and WBF concentrations were 11.1% lower in controls (218.2 +/- 49.7 ng/mL) than in patients (245.3 +/- 59.1 ng/mL; P = 0.031). Total folate intake was 18.8% higher in controls (444.7 +/- 266.7 microg/d) than in IBD patients (361.1 +/- 230.6 microg/d), but this difference was not statistically significant (P = 0.264). Folate intakes were below the Recommended Dietary Allowance (200-400 microg/d), adjusted for age and sex, in 35.4% of study subjects. CONCLUSIONS: In contrast with previous evidence of folate deficiency in adult IBD patients, our data indicate higher folate concentrations in children with newly diagnosed untreated IBD than in controls. This finding was unexpected, especially in light of the higher dietary folate intakes and hematocrit values in children without IBD. The influence of IBD therapy on folate metabolism and the long-term clinical implications of high RBCF and WBF concentrations at the time of IBD diagnosis should be explored further.},

   abstract = {Nutrition and Crohn's disease (CD) are intertwined because of the central role of nutrition in the care of patients with CD, specifically the theories regarding a dietary contribution to pathogenesis and formal studies investigating the primary role of nutrition as therapy for CD. Perhaps one of the most important studies evaluating the role of nutrition therapy and bowel rest in the management of CD was performed by Greenberg and colleagues in 1988. This pivotal study attempted to define the role of bowel rest as an independent variable in the management of hospitalized patients with active CD unresponsive to the traditional medical therapy that was available at the time. As the first randomized controlled trial evaluating nutrition intervention in CD, it showed that bowel rest was not a major factor in achieving remission during nutrition support and did not affect outcome during 1-year follow-up. Although these discouraging findings would be subsequently replicated, the role of enteral and parenteral nutrition therapy would evolve during the following years as a result of insight into CD pathogenesis, the emergence of more effective medical therapies, and improved understanding of the role of nutrition in the care of patients with CD.},

Crohn's disease (in UK) and mesenteric ischemia (in France) were the most frequent etiologies. In adults, the incidence was estimated at two adults/million inhabitants/year. AIM: This review aimed to provide answer for these questions: 1. Who are patients interested by short bowel syndrome? 2. Which interventions are responsible? 3. What is evolution before and after nutritional assistance? METHODS: An electronic search was performed between 1990 an 2006 in Medline database with the following keywords: "short bowel disease", "treatment" and "inflammatory bowel disease". Recent literature reviews and meta analysis were retained for analysis. RESULTS: After an extensive intestinal resection, nutritional management should start early during the post operative course. This strategy will prevent in time life threatening complications. NPDA is indicated temporarily for short bowel syndrome until intestinal readaptation or definitively in case of severe short bowel syndrome to improve survival and quality of life.},

   abstract = {BACKGROUND: Probiotics, defined as live micro-organisms with beneficial effects for the host, are widely applied in gastrointestinal and liver diseases. AIM AND METHOD: To review the available evidence of clinical trials on probiotics in gastrointestinal and liver diseases, with a major focus on irritable bowel syndrome, inflammatory bowel disease, pancreatitis and chronic liver diseases. RESULTS: Evidence for the therapeutic or preventive application of particular probiotic strains is available for antibiotic-associated diarrhoea, rota-virus-associated diarrhoea and pouchitis. Results are encouraging for irritable bowel syndrome, ulcerative colitis and for reducing side effects by Helicobacter pylori eradication therapies, but are less clear for Crohn's disease, lactose intolerance and constipation. In general, for most of these patient groups, more placebo-controlled methodologically well-designed studies that pay attention to both clinical outcome and mechanistic aspects are required. The application in liver disease and pancreatitis is promising, but more human trials have to be awaited. Possible mechanisms of probiotics include modulation of the intestinal microbiota and the immune system, but different bacterial may have different effects. CONCLUSION: Further insight into disease entities and the functioning of probiotic strains is required to be able to select disease-specific strains, which have to be tested in well-designed placebo-controlled studies.},

   abstract = {Elemental diet (ED) has been used as an enteral nutritional therapy for Crohn's disease. However, the precise mechanisms of ED remain unclear. In interleukin-10 (IL-10)-deficient cell-transferred mice, we investigated the change of intestinal microbiota with ED using molecular terminal-restriction fragment length polymorphism (T-RFLP) analysis and culture method, and evaluated its influence on therapeutic effects of ED. ED significantly suppressed intestinal inflammation. The total amount of bacteria in colitis mice fed the regular diet was higher than in normal mice but decreased in colitis mice fed ED. T-RFLP profiles of the ED group markedly differed from those of the regular diet groups. The diversity of bacterial species in the ED group decreased to 60% of that found in the regular diet groups. Among the cultivated bacteria, the change in lactic acid bacteria composition was remarkable. Lactobacillus reuteri and L. johnsonii decreased and Enterococcus faecalis and E. durans increased in the ED group. The culture supernatant of L. reuteri isolates induced significant tumor necrosis factor-alpha (TNF-alpha) and IL-6 activity in RAW 264 cells, while the culture supernatant of E. faecalis and E. durans barely induced their activity. These data suggested that reduction in amount and diversity of intestinal microbiota and decrease of proinflammatory cytokines via a change in composition of lactic acid bacteria by ED seem to contribute to reduction of bowel inflammation in this model.},

METHODS: The study was conducted in patients with established mildly to moderately active CD, attending the outpatient clinics of the hospital, and in healthy controls. Recruited to a 4 wk treatment with mastic caps (6 caps/d, 0.37 g/cap) were 10 patients and 8 controls, all of who successfully completed the protocol. Interleukin-6 (IL-6), tumor necrosis factor-alpha (TNF-alpha), monocyte chemotactic protein-1 (MCP-1), macrophage migration inhibitory factor (MIF) and intracellular antioxidant glutathione (GSH) were evaluated in peripheral blood mononuclear cells (PBMC) before and after treatment. RESULTS: Treating CD patients with mastic resulted in the reduction of TNF-alpha secretion (2.1 +/- 0.9 ng/mL vs 0.5 +/- 0.4 ng/mL, P = 0.028). MIF release was significantly increased (1.2 +/- 0.4 ng/mL vs 2.5 +/- 0.7 ng/mL, P = 0.026) meaning that random migration and chemotaxis of monocytes/macrophages was inhibited. No significant changes were observed in IL-6, MCP-1 and GSH concentrations. CONCLUSION: This study shows that mastic acts as an immunomodulator on PBMC, acting as a TNF-alpha inhibitor and a MIF stimulator. Although further double-blind, placebo-controlled studies in a large number of patients is required to clarify the role of this natural product, this finding provides strong evidence that mastic might be an important regulator of immunity in CD.},

METHODS: This pilot study was conducted in patients with established mild to moderately active CD, attending the outpatient clinics of the hospital, and in healthy controls. Ten patients and 8 controls were recruited for a 4-wk treatment with mastic caps (6 caps/d, 0.37 g/cap). All patients successfully completed the protocol. CD Activity Index (CDAI), Nutritional Risk Index (NRI), C-reactive protein (CRP), interleukin-6 (IL-6), tumor necrosis factor-alpha (TNF-alpha), monocyte chemotactic protein-1 (MCP-1), and total antioxidant potential (TAP) were evaluated in the plasma at baseline and at the end of the treatment period. Results were expressed as mean values +/- SE and P < 0.05 was considered to indicate statistical significance. RESULTS: Patients exhibited significant reduction of CDAI (222.9 +/- 18.7 vs 136.3 +/- 12.3, P = 0.05) as compared to pretreament values. Plasma IL-6 was significantly decreased (21.2 +/- 9.3 pg/mL vs 7.2 +/- 2.8 pg/ mL, P = 0.027), and so did CRP (40.3 +/- 13.1 mg/mL vs 19.7 +/- 5.5, P = 0.028). TAP was significantly increased (0.15 +/- 0.09 vs 0.57 +/- 0.15 mmol/L uric acid, P = 0.036). No patient or control exhibited any kind of side effects.

There are no reports on the status of BMD in Indian patients with IBD. METHODS: Dietary calcium intake and cumulative steroid and immunosuppressive drug use was noted in 46 randomly selected patients (mean [SD] age 40.5 [14.7] years; 28 men) with IBD (ulcerative colitis 22, Crohn's disease 24). To compare values of BMD for patients, data from 46 age- and sex-matched healthy controls (age 40.5 [14.6] years; 28 men) were selected from an existing database of healthy Indian volunteers whose BMD had been measured in a community-based survey carried out among people residing in Delhi (unpublished data). BMD was measured using DXA (Hologic QDR 4500). Osteopenia and osteoporosis were defined as per the standard WHO criteria. RESULTS: The mean duration of disease was 87.7 (78.3) months. The mean calcium intake by 41 patients (89.1%) was <200 mg/day, by 2 patients (4.3%) 200-400 mg/day and by 3 patients (6.4%)>400 mg/day. Significantly lower values of BMD at the spine and hip regions were seen in patients with both ulcerative colitis and Crohn's disease as compared with Indian healthy controls. In comparison to age- and sex-matched healthy controls, 29 (63%) and 21 (45.6%) patients had either osteopenia or osteoporosis at the spine and hip region, respectively. Of them, 4 and 7 patients had osteoporosis at the spine and hip region, respectively. There was no correlation between values of BMD and the age of patient, duration of disease, and cumulative steroid dose. CONCLUSIONS: Two thirds of Indian patients with IBD have low BMD. Since the intake of dietary calcium is inadequate in a majority of these patients, they should be advised to increase the intake of dairy products.},

   abstract = {The understanding of diverticulitis has advanced little beyond the initial postulates of Burkitt and Painter who proposed that diverticular disease results from a deficiency of dietary fiber. Diverticular disease and diverticulitis are viewed simply as a consequence of a diet, which takes in relatively little fiber. Our understanding of diverticulitis has not advanced beyond these basic concepts. As many as two-thirds of individuals in the West have diverticular disease by the age of 85 years, but only 10% to 25% will manifest any related clinical symptoms. Other than age, several risk factors have been identified for the development of diverticular disease and diverticulitis. In particular, obesity and red meat intake are risk factors. Smoking is more controversial and alcohol, coffee, and caffeine have not shown to be risk factors. Vegetable intake, a strict vegetable diet, and increased fiber intake decreases the risk of development of diverticular disease, as well as diverticulitis. Physical activity also seems protective. Despite these evidences, the risk factors and pathophysiology progression from asymptomatic diverticular disease to diverticulitis have been inadequately studied. This subject is reviewed in more detail in this manuscript.},

   abstract = {SUMMARY: Vitamin K and D deficiency and decreased bone mineral density (BMD) were highly prevalent in patients with inflammatory bowel disease (IBD), especially Crohn's disease (CD). Dietary intakes of these vitamins, however, were above the Japanese adequate intakes in IBD patients, suggesting that malabsorption is the basis for hypovitaminosis K and D and decreased BMD. INTRODUCTION: We have studied the possible involvement of vitamin K and D deficiency in the pathogenesis of decreased BMD in IBD. METHODS: Seventy patients with IBD were evaluated for their BMD; plasma levels of vitamin K; phylloquinone (PK), menaquinone-7 (MK-7), and 25OH-D; serum PTH, protein induced by vitamin K absence (PIVKA-II), and undercarboxylated osteocalcin (ucOC) levels; and their food intake. RESULTS: Compared with ulcerative colitis (UC) patients, CD patients had significantly lower plasma vitamin K and 25OH-D concentrations; significantly higher serum levels of PTH, PIVKA-II, and ucOC; and significantly lower BMD scores at almost all measurement sites. More IBD patients were vitamin K deficient in bone than in liver. Multiple regression analyses revealed that low plasma concentrations of vitamin K and 25OH-D were independent risk factors for low BMD and that they were associated with the patients' fat intake, but not with their intake of these vitamins. CONCLUSION: IBD patients have high prevalence of decreased BMD and vitamin K and D deficiency probably caused by malabsorption of these vitamins.},

   abstract = {Significant changes have been observed in the epidemiology of inflammatory bowel diseases (IBD) in the last two decades. Traditionally, the incidence of IBD was higher in the developed, industrialized countries, in contrast, nowadays it became more prevalent in the previously low incidence areas. In particular, the incidence of ulcerative colitis (UC) is similar to that observed in North America and Western Europe, while the incidence of Crohn's disease (CD) in developing countries is still low, suggesting that the environmental factors may act faster or differently in UC than in CD. In Europe, the North to South gradient disappeared, and also the West to East gradient is diminishing. Smoking and appendectomy may be considered as important environmental factors in both UC and CD, however, with opposite effects. In addition, the use of oral contraceptives is associated to disease susceptibility in both diseases. The role of diet, perinatal events, stress and nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drugs in the pathogenesis is still controversial.},

   abstract = {Curcumin (diferulolylmethane) demonstrates profound anti-inflammatory effects in intestinal epithelial cells (IEC) and in immune cells in vitro and exhibits a protective role in rodent models of chemically induced colitis, with its presumed primary mechanism of action via inhibition of NF-kappaB. Although it has been demonstrated effective in reducing relapse rate in ulcerative colitis patients, curcumin's effectiveness in Crohn's disease (CD) or in Th-1/Th-17 mediated immune models of CD has not been evaluated. Therefore, we investigated the effects of dietary curcumin (0.1-1%) on the development of colitis, immune activation, and in vivo NF-kappaB activity in germ-free IL-10(-/-) or IL-10(-/-);NF-kappaB(EGFP) mice colonized with specific pathogen-free microflora. Proximal and distal colon morphology showed a mild protective effect of curcumin only at 0.1%. Colonic IFN-gamma and IL-12/23p40 mRNA expression followed similar pattern ( approximately 50% inhibition at 0.1%). Secretion of IL-12/23p40 and IFN-gamma by colonic explants and mesenteric lymph node cells was elevated in IL-10(-/-) mice and was not decreased by dietary curcumin. Surprisingly, activation of NF-kappaB in IL-10(-/-) mice (phospho-NF-kappaBp65) or in IL-10(-/-);NF-kappaB(EGFP) mice (whole organ or confocal imaging) was not noticeably inhibited by curcumin. Furthermore, we demonstrate that IL-10 and curcumin act synergistically to downregulate NF-kappaB activity in IEC and IL-12/23p40 production by splenocytes and dendritic cells. In conclusion, curcumin demonstrates limited effectiveness on Th-1 mediated colitis in IL-10(-/-) mice, with moderately improved colonic morphology, but with no significant effect on pathogenic T cell responses and in situ NF-kappaB activity. In vitro studies suggest that the protective effects of curcumin are IL-10 dependent.},

   abstract = {Crohn's disease and ulcerative colitis, also called chronic inflammatory bowel diseases (IBD), affect up to 500 per 100,000 persons in the Western world. Recent studies in the etiology of IBD suggest that these diseases are caused by a combination of genetic, environmental, and immunological factors. Results from humans and especially animal models of colitis reported by our group and others have indicated that these diseases result from a lack of tolerance to resident intestinal bacteria in genetically susceptible hosts. Probiotic bacteria have health-promoting effects for the host when ingested and have also shown efficacy in ulcerative colitis and refractory pouchitis. In light of the efficacy of providing probiotic bacteria to patients with IBD, there has been interest in the prophylactic and therapeutic potential of inulin, oligofructose, and other prebiotics for patients with or at risk of IBD. Prebiotics are nondigestible dietary oligosaccharides that affect the host by selectively stimulating growth, activity, or both of selective intestinal (probiotic) bacteria. Prebiotics are easy to administer and, in contrast to probiotic therapy, do not require administration of large amounts of (live) bacteria and are therefore easier to administer. Studies using prebiotics, especially beta-fructan oligosaccharides, for the treatment of chronic intestinal inflammation have shown benefit in animal models of colitis. Studies using these prebiotics alone or in combination with probiotics are emerging and have shown promise. These dietary therapies could lead to novel treatments for these chronic debilitating diseases.},

Al exposure in food, additives, air, pharmaceuticals, and water pollution is ubiquitous in Western culture. Crohn's disease (CD) is a chronic relapsing intestinal inflammation in genetically susceptible individuals and is influenced by yet unidentified environmental factors. It is hypothesized, in the present review, that Al is a potential factor for induction or maintaining the inflammation in CD. Epidemiologically, CD incidence is higher in urban areas, where microparticle pollution is prevalent. Al immune activities share many characteristics with the immune pathology of CD: increased antigen presentation and APCs activation, many luminal bacterial or dietary compounds can be adsorbed to the metal and induce Th1 profile activity, promotion of humoral and cellular immune responses, proinflammatory, apoptotic, oxidative activity, and stress-related molecule expression enhancement, affecting intestinal bacterial composition and virulence, granuloma formation, colitis induction in an animal model of CD, and terminal ileum uptake. The Al-bacterial interaction, the microparticles homing the intestine together with the extensive immune activity, put Al as a potential environmental candidate for CD induction and maintenance.},

   abstract = {Cyclooxygenases (COX) regulate a variety of inflammatory diseases, including inflammatory bowel disease (IBD). While the pathological effects of COX-1 inhibition by NSAIDs on intestinal ulceration are well established, the role of COX-2 on intestinal inflammation remains under investigation. In this paper, we report a protective role for COX-2 against diet-mediated intestinal inflammation in mice. COX-2(-/-) mice fed an atherogenic diet or diet containing cholate, but not chow or fat alone, had a high mortality whereas COX-1(-/-) mice and wild-type mice were unaffected by the dietary changes. Histological analysis identified the cause of death in COX-2(-/-) mice due to severe intestinal inflammation that was surprisingly limited to the ileo-ceco-colic junction. COX-2 expression is induced in the cecum of wild-type mice fed an atherogenic diet. Our findings show that COX-2 plays an anti-inflammatory role at the ileo-ceco-colic junction in mice, and the pathology of diet-mediated intestinal inflammation in COX-2(-/-) mice offers an excellent model system to elucidate the molecular mechanisms of intestinal inflammation.},

   abstract = {OBJECTIVE: To evaluate bone mineral density of the lumbar spine in children and adolescents with inflammatory bowel disease, and to identify the clinical risk factors associated with low bone mineral density. METHODS: Bone mineral density of the lumbar spine was evaluated using dual-energy X-ray absorptiometry (DXA) in 40 patients with inflammatory bowel disease. Patients were 11.8 (SD = 4.1) years old and most of them were male (52.5%). Multiple linear regression analysis was performed to identify potential associations between bone mineral density Z-score and age, height-for-age Z-score, BMI Z-score, cumulative corticosteroid dose in milligrams and in milligrams per kilogram, disease duration, number of relapses, and calcium intake according to the dietary reference intake. RESULTS: Low bone mineral density (Z-score bellow -2) was observed in 25% of patients. Patients with Crohn's disease and ulcerative colitis had equivalent prevalence of low bone mineral density. Multiple linear regression models demonstrated that height-for-age Z-score, BMI Z-score, and cumulative corticosteroid dose in mg had independent effects on BMD, respectively, beta = 0.492 (P = 0.000), beta = 0.460 (P = 0.001), beta = - 0.014 (P = 0.000), and these effects remained significant after adjustments for disease duration, respectively, beta = 0.489 (P = 0.013), beta = 0.467 (P = 0.001), and beta = - 0.005 (P = 0.015). The model accounted for 54.6% of the variability of the BMD Z-score (adjusted R2 = 0.546). CONCLUSIONS: The prevalence of low bone mineral density in children and adolescents with inflammatory bowel disease is considerably high and independent risk factors associated with bone mineral density are corticosteroid cumulative dose in milligrams, height-for-age Z-score, and BMI Z-score.},

We studied 20 healthy controls and 20 subjects with IBD, 15 of whom had Crohn's disease and five with ulcerative colitis. All the subjects consumed Lactobacillus rhamnosus GR-1 and L. reuteri RC-14 supplemented yogurt for 30 days. The presence of putative regulatory T (T(reg)) cells (CD4(+) CD25(high)) and cytokines in T cells, monocytes and dendritic cells (DC) was determined by flow cytometry from peripheral blood before and after treatment, with or without ex vivo stimulation. Serum and faecal cytokine concentrations were determined by enzyme-linked immunosorbent assays. The proportion of CD4(+) CD25(high) T cells increased significantly (P = 0.007) in IBD patients, mean (95% confidence interval: CI) 0.84% (95% CI 0.55-1.12) before and 1.25% (95% CI 0.97-1.54) after treatment, but non-significantly in controls. The basal proportion of tumour necrosis factor (TNF)-alpha(+)/interleukin (IL)-12(+) monocytes and myeloid DC decreased in both subject groups, but of stimulated cells only in IBD patients. Also serum IL-12 concentrations and proportions of IL-2(+) and CD69(+) T cells from stimulated cells decreased in IBD patients. The increase in CD4(+) CD25(high) T cells correlated with the decrease in the percentage of TNF-alpha- or IL-12-producing monocytes and DC. The effect of the probiotic yogurt was confirmed by a follow-up study in which subjects consumed the yogurt without the probiotic organisms. Probiotic yogurt intake was associated with significant anti-inflammatory effects that paralleled the expansion of peripheral pool of putative T(reg) cells in IBD patients and with few effects in controls.},

   abstract = {Celiac disease (CD) is a chronic immune-mediated gluten-dependent enteropathy induced by ingestion of gluten-containing products, characterized by intestinal malabsorption and subtotal or total atrophy of intestinal villi, which improves after gluten-free diet (GFD). Untreated patients affected by the classic form of CD are at high risk of malnutrition, but an impairment of nutritional status is frequently reported also in patients with the subclinical form of the disease. Strict adherence to a GFD greatly improves nutritional status, inducing an increase in fat and bone compartments, but does not completely normalize body composition. A lack of improvement in nutritional status may identify incomplete adherence to GFD treatment. Evidence has shown lower body weights and lower fat mass and fat-free mass contents in CD patients. Untreated CD patients oxidize more carbohydrates as energy substrate compared to treated subjects. In addition, circulating ghrelin concentration was reduced after GFD treatment as a possible consequence of body composition improvement, while leptin did not correlate with the changes in body composition and substrate oxidation in patients with CD. A significant correlation was reported between ghrelin and the degree of severity of intestinal mucosal lesions. CD patients might show an alteration in lipid metabolism, i.e. low serum total and high- density lipoprotein-cholesterol as a consequence of lipid malabsorption and decreased intake. In conclusion, weight loss and nutritional deficiencies are relevant clinical features in CD. Thus, an early and accurate evaluation of nutritional status and energy metabolism represents a fundamental tool in the management of CD patients.},

   abstract = {Inflammatory bowel disease (IBD) represents a spectrum of diseases in which inflammation leads to acute and chronic gut injury. It is a growing health issue for which no cure exists. The pathogenesis is multifactorial with links to infectious and environmental events that trigger disease in genetically predisposed individuals. Treatment of the two major forms of IBD, Crohn's disease and ulcerative colitis, involves the reduction of inflammation with toxic immunosuppressive drugs or blocking of the pro-inflammatory effects of tumour necrosis factor-alpha (TNF-alpha) with antibodies. Here, we show that the oral administration of transgenic low-alkaloid tobacco expressing the contra-inflammatory cytokine human interleukin-10 (hIL-10) reduces the severity of colitis by down-regulating TNF-alpha expression directly at the sites of inflammation in IBD-susceptible IL-10(-/-) mice. hIL-10 expressed in plants is biologically active and displays resistance to gastrointestinal degradation. Dietary supplementation with plant tissue delivering up to 9 microg of hIL-10 daily for 4 weeks was well tolerated by treated mice. Gut histology was significantly improved relative to controls (P = 0.002), and was correlated with a decrease in small bowel TNF-alpha mRNA levels and an increase in IL-2 and IL-1beta mRNA levels. Transgenic plants expressing IL-10 to directly attenuate TNF-alpha expression at sites of inflammation in the gut may become a useful new approach in the luminal therapy of IBD.},

   abstract = {BACKGROUND: Computed tomography enteroclysis (CTE) may be superior to other small bowel imaging techniques, detecting subtle mucosal lesions and extraluminal pathology. This study aimed to define the technical success, clinical influence and tolerance of CTE in patients with suspected small bowel disease. METHODS: CTE scans of 42 consecutive patients (aged 21-78 years, 12 men) were reviewed by a single radiologist for technical adequacy and diagnosis. A panel of gastroenterologists reviewed clinical information. At a telephone interview, tolerance of CTE was graded numerically from 1 (unbearable) to 10 (excellent) and descriptively as unbearable, fair, good or excellent. RESULTS: Good or optimal distension of small bowel was achieved in 98%. The entire small bowel was imaged in 88%. Eighteen patients had a normal small bowel, whereas 12 (29%) had active small bowel Crohn disease, 4 intussusception, 3 small bowel diverticula and 7 having other diagnoses. Mesenteric lymphadenopathy was evident in 11 and fat stranding in 5. CTE resulted in a new or altered diagnosis in 13 (31%) patients and identified more extensive Crohn disease in a further 8 (19%). A change in management plan was instituted in 18 (43%) patients, with subsequent clinically significant improvement in 12. 33 (85%) described the procedure as 'fair' or 'unbearable' rather than 'good' or 'excellent'. The median tolerance score was 3 out of 10. CONCLUSION: CTE provided high-quality images in nearly all patients and had an effect on diagnosis, management or outcome in most, but was not well tolerated.},

   abstract = {BACKGROUND: Individuals with active celiac disease (CD+) have an increased incidence of thyroid dysfunction, which improves on a gluten-free diet (CD-). We investigated whether tissue transglutaminase-2 IgA antibodies (anti-TGase II) present in sera of patients with celiac disease react with thyroid tissue and possibly contribute to thyroid disease. METHODS: Serum from 40 active celiac patients taken before a gluten-free diet (CD+), 46 patients on a gluten-free diet (CD-), 40 normal controls (NC), and 25 with Crohn's disease (CROHN) was used. All sera were screened for antithyroperoxidase antibodies (TPO-AB) and thyroglobulin antibodies (TG-AB), and indirect immunofluorescence (IIF) was performed on primate thyroid tissue sections using TPO-AB- and TG-AB-negative sera. RESULTS: IIF with thyroid seronegative, anti-TGase II-positive CD+ sera (n = 23) demonstrated staining of thyroid follicular cells and extracellular matrix, in an identical pattern with monoclonal anti-human TGase II antibody. Evidence of TGase II as the antigen in thyroid tissue was supported by elimination of the IIF pattern when sera were depleted of anti-TGase II by pretreatment with human recombinant TGase II. No staining of thyroid tissue was observed when sera from CD+ patients that were negative for TGase II antibodies, or sera from NC subjects were used. Thyroid antibodies were found in 43% of CD+ patients, significantly higher than NC and CROHN patients (p < 0.0001). In addition, a positive correlation was observed between anti-TGase II and TPO-AB titers (p = 0.0001; r = 0.63). CONCLUSIONS: Anti-TGase II antibodies bind to TGase II in thyroid tissue, and titers correlate with TPO antibody titers. These findings suggest that anti-TGase II antibodies could contribute to the development of thyroid disease in celiac disease.},

   abstract = {INTRODUCTION: The primary nutritional therapy (PNT), which consists in the administration of exclusive enteral formula feeds (polymeric, semi-elemental or elemental formula) for a period of no less than 6-8 weeks, has proven to be effective in inducing clinical remission in children with Crohn's disease. The clinical remission does not always include histological remission or cure of the mucosa. Faecal calprotectin is closely correlated with endoscopic and histological findings but is slightly associated with clinical activity scores. PATIENTS AND METHODS: An observational prospective study including all patients under 14 years of age diagnosed with Crohn's disease between January 2002 and October 2007, and who were fed exclusively with polymeric formula (Modulen IBD, Nestle, Vevey, Switzerland) during the onset of the disease. Clinical controls were carried out (weight, height, body mass index [BMI) and the Paediatric Crohn's Disease Activity Index [PCDAI)) and faecal calprotectin was measured at the beginning and at weeks 4 and 8 of treatment. The clinical remission was defined as having a PCDAI less than or equal to 10. Faecal calprotectin values below 50 microg/g faeces were considered as normal. RESULTS: There were 14 patients (9 males), mean age at diagnosis of 10.74 +/- 2.56 years. At week 4, 71 % of patients (10/14) had achieved clinical remission and a decrease in faecal calprotectin levels that was not significant. After 8 weeks, 85 % of our patients were in clinical remission and faecal calprotectin values had declined significantly without reaching normal levels. CONCLUSION: Primary nutritional therapy administered over a period of 8 weeks is capable of inducing clinical remission and improving the degree of inflammation of the intestinal mucosa.},

We aimed to assess the effect of two different enteral supplements of Impact(R) Powder (IP; Novartis, Switzerland) on leptin levels and nutritional status in active CD patients during prednisolone treatment and tapering. METHODS: Thirty-one CD patients were randomized to IP Extra (group 1) or IP Standard (group 2). Leptin levels, nutritional, clinical and biochemical markers were studied at inclusion, after 5 and after 9 weeks of the study. RESULTS: Leptin levels, body mass index (BMI) and total cholesterol increased significantly within both groups at week 5 compared to inclusion. Leptin levels correlated with BMI in both groups at inclusion and in group 2 at week 9. In group 1, triglyceride levels remained unchanged, while levels in group 2 increased significantly at week 5 compared to inclusion. Clinical and biochemical markers improved during the study compared to inclusion. CONCLUSIONS: Increased leptin levels during the study progress were transient, decreasing due to prednisolone withdrawal at the end of the study. Both formulas used as adjuvant therapy to prednisolone treatment were able to improve nutritional status in CD patients.},

   abstract = {Crohn's disease is a chronic inflammatory condition that may involve any segment of the gastrointestinal tract. Although several drugs have proven efficacy in inducing and maintaining disease in remission, resectional surgery remains as a cornerstone in the management of the disease, mainly for the treatment of its stenosing and penetrating complications. However, the occurrence of new mucosal (endoscopic) lesions in the neoterminal ileum early after surgery is almost constant, it is followed in the mid-term by clinical symptoms and, in a proportion of patients, repeated intestinal resections are required. Pathogenesis of postoperative recurrence (POR) is not fully understood, but luminal factors (commensal microbes, dietary antigens) seem to play an important role, and environmental and genetic factors may also have a relevant influence. Many studies tried to identify clinical predictors for POR with heterogeneous results, and only smoking has repeatedly been associated with a higher risk of POR. Ileocolonoscopy remains as the gold standard for the assessment of appearance and severity of POR, although the real usefulness of the available endoscopic score needs to be revisited and alternative techniques are emerging. Several drugs have been evaluated to prevent POR with limited success. Smoking cessation seems to be one of the more beneficial therapeutic measures. Aminosalicylates have only proved to be of marginal benefit, and they are only used in low-risk patients. Nitroimidazolic antibiotics, although efficient, are associated with a high rate of intolerance and might induce irreversible side effects when used for a long-term. Thiopurines are not widely used after ileocecal resection, maybe because some concerns in giving immunomodulators in asymptomatic patients still remain. In the era of biological agents and genetic testing, a well-established preventive strategy for POR is still lacking, and larger studies to identify good clinical, serological, and genetic predictors of early POR as well as more effective drugs (or drug combinations) are needed.},

ONS and/or TF in addition to normal food is indicates in undernourished patients with CD or UC to improve nutritional status. In active CD EN is the first line therapy in children and should be used as sole therapy in adults mainly when treatment with corticosteroids is not feasible. No significant differences have been shown in the effects of free amino acid, peptide-based and hole protein formulae for TF. In remission ONS is recommended only in steroid dependent patients in CD. In patients with SBS TF should be introduced in the adaptation phase and should be changed with progressing adaptation to ONS in addition to normal food. Special nutrition support should not be used routinely in patients with mild or moderate acute pancreatitis. EN is the preffered route in patients with pancreatitis and should be attempted before initiating parenteral nutrition. Nutrition assessment in patients with liver disease should include screening for micronutrient deficiencies. Protein restriction should be implemented for the acute management of hepatic encephalopathy and should not be implemented chronically in patients with liver disease.},

   abstract = {OBJECTIVE: Short bowel syndrome patients frequently experience impaired health-related quality of life. This syndrome is also associated with increased costs for the individuals concerned and the community. Intake of specially processed cereals has been demonstrated to decrease intestinal secretion. This study evaluates the effect of a supplementary diet with specially processed cereals compared with nonprocessed cereals. METHODS: This investigation is a randomized double-blind, cross-over multicentre prospective study of 26 intestinal resected out patients, considered as short bowel syndrome patients. The patients were divided into groups A or B, in accordance with the first allocated treatment. Subgroup analyses of the underlying diagnoses and type of surgical procedure were performed. The studied parameters were faecal volume, nocturnal stools, abdominal pain/discomfort, health-related quality of life, peripheral blood tests and anthropometric data. RESULTS: In both groups, intake of nonprocessed cereals significantly decreased the faecal volume. The subgroup analyses of patients with a history of ulcerative colitis (compared with Crohn's disease) and nonileostomy-operated procedure (compared with ileostomi-operated procedure) showed significantly decreased faecal volume during nonprocessed cereals intake. Peripheral blood tests, quality of life and anthropometry were not affected. CONCLUSION: In this study, nonprocessed cereals seemed to be as effective as specially processed cereals in decreasing faecal volume in general and especially in ulcerative colitis patients (mainly operated with nonileostomy techniques). Our results indicate that use of supplementary cereals is safe for this group of patients, but should optimally include evaluation of the underlying diagnosis and the surgical method used.},

This approach can potentially be harnessed to reduce the incidence or symptoms of chronic diseases, such as inflammatory bowel disease (IBD). It becomes desirable to interrogate the vast number of discrete compounds present in foods for their ability to influence the phenotype of a cell carrying a variant single nucleotide polymorphism (SNP). Here we describe two cell-based assays that can now be used to test the ability of food components or extracts, to overcome the functional effects of certain variant SNPs that may be important in human IBD. The first monitors the signal transduction pathways of key pattern recognition receptors, in which SNPs associated with IBD have been identified, and tests for food components or extracts that can modulate these pathways for potential therapeutic benefit. The second models the NOD2 3020insC SNP, which is the most common and highest risk variant in Crohn's disease, and examines the ability of food components or extracts to restore the normal phenotype in the mutant cell line. Such screens provide a scientific basis for the rational choice of foods to be more rigorously investigated in animal models of IBD.},

   abstract = {Dietary microparticles are non-biological bacterial-sized particles of the gastrointestinal lumen that occur due to endogenous formation (calcium phosphate) or following oral exposure (exogenous microparticle). In the UK, about 40 mg (10(12)) of exogenous microparticles are ingested per person per day, through exposure to food additives, pharmaceutical/supplement excipients or toothpaste constituents. Once ingested, exogenous microparticles are unlikely to pass through the gastrointestinal tract without adsorbing to their surfaces some ions and molecules of the intestinal lumen. Both entropy and ionic attraction drive such interactions. Calcium ions are especially well adsorbed by dietary microparticles which then provide a positively charged surface for the attraction (adsorption) of other organic molecules such as lipopolysaccharides, peptidoglycans or protein antigen from the diet or commensal flora. The major (but not only) sites of microparticle entry into intestinal tissue are the M-cell rich lymphoid aggregates (termed Peyer's patches in the small bowel). Indeed, it is well established that this is an efficient transport route for non-biological microparticles although it is unclear why. We hypothesise that this pathway exists for "endogenous microparticles" of calcium phosphate, with immunological and physiological benefit, and that "exogenous dietary microparticles", such as titanium dioxide and the silicates, hijack this route. This overview focuses on what is known of these microparticles and outlines their potential role in immune tolerance of the gut (endogenous microparticles) or immune activation (exogenous microparticles) and inflammation of the gut.},

   abstract = {PURPOSE OF REVIEW: Nutrition plays a significant role in the pathogenesis and treatment of the two major forms of inflammatory bowel disease: Crohn's disease and ulcerative colitis. In addition, patients with inflammatory bowel disease are often found to have nutrient deficiencies at the time of diagnosis, whereas others develop features of malnutrition over the course of their illness. Therefore, an understanding of the relationship between nutrients and inflammatory bowel disease is important if these patients are to receive optimal care. RECENT FINDINGS: Epidemiologic and basic research has helped to shed light on the interaction between diet and the pathogenesis of inflammatory bowel disease. Numerous clinical trials utilizing various types of lipids, including fish oil and short chain fatty acids, suggest that fats play an important role in the inflammatory response that characterizes inflammatory bowel disease. Vitamins and other micronutrients involved in nutrient metabolism and modulation of oxidative stress are also considered in this review. SUMMARY: This update discusses nutritional issues that can be used to help prevent and treat nutrient deficiencies and ameliorate disease activity in individuals with inflammatory bowel disease.},

   abstract = {Similar changes in glycosylation occur in the colonic epithelium in inflammatory conditions such as ulcerative colitis and Crohn's disease and also in colon cancer and precancerous adenomatous polyps. They include reduced length of O-glycans, reduced sulfation, increased sialylation and increased expression of oncofetal carbohydrate antigens, such as sialyl-Tn (sialylalpha2-6GalNAc), and the TF antigen (Thomsen-Friedenreich antigen) Galbeta1-3GalNAcalpha-Ser/Thr. The changes affect cell surface as well as secreted glycoproteins and mediate altered interactions between the epithelium and lectins of dietary, microbial or human origin. Different TF-binding lectins cause diverse effects on epithelial cells, reflecting subtle differences in binding specificities e.g. for sialylated TF; some of these interactions, such as with the TF-binding peanut lectin that resists digestion, may be biologically significant. Increased TF expression by cancer cells also allows interaction with the human galactose-binding lectin, galectin-3. This lectin has increased concentration in the sera of patients with metastatic cancer and binds TF on cancer cell surface MUC1 (mucin 1), causing clustering of MUC1 and revealing underlying adhesion molecules which promote adhesion to endothelium. This is likely to be an important mechanism in cancer metastasis and represents a valid therapeutic target. Tools are now available to allow fast and accurate elucidation of glycosylation changes in epithelial disease, characterization of their potential lectin ligands, whether dietary, microbial or human, and determination of the functional significance of their interactions. This should prove a very fruitful area for future research with relevance to infectious, inflammatory and cancerous diseases of the epithelia.},

   abstract = {BACKGROUND: Active Crohn's disease can be treated using liquid diet therapy (LDT), but non-adherence may limit success, necessitating corticosteroid therapy. Whole-protein polymeric formula (PF) seems to be much more palatable than amino acid-based elemental formula (EF) and thus may significantly improve adherence to LDT. AIM: To compare adherence to LDT using PF versus EF. METHODS: Success in completing a 6-week course of LDT, need for nasogastric tube administration of formula and use of LDT for relapses were compared between children presenting with active disease and treated with EF (n = 53) and children given PF (n = 45). RESULTS: Remission rates were similar (EF 64%, 95% CI 51 to 77 vs PF 51%, 95% CI 37 to 66; p>0.15). 72% (95% CI 60 to 84) given EF completed the initial course of LDT compared with 58% (95% CI 44 to 72) given PF (p = 0.15). Of those failing to complete the initial course, 13% on EF and 16% on PF gave up by choice (non-adherence), the remainder stopping due to treatment failure. Nasogastric administration was more frequent with EF (55%, 95% CI 42 to 68) compared to PF (31%, 95% CI 17 to 45) (p = 0.02). Among those treated successfully at first presentation, LDT was used for 28% of relapses in the EF group (95% CI 12 to 44) and 39% in the PF group (95% CI 19 to 59) (p>0.2) over the next year. CONCLUSION: PF did not effect adherence to LDT but was associated with significantly reduced need for nasogastric tube administration of formula.},

   abstract = {BACKGROUND: Ulcerative colitis (UC) and Crohn's disease (CD) can cause metabolic and inflammatory alterations. AIM: To evaluate the relationships between inflammatory parameters, plasma lipids and phospholipid fatty acid (FA) composition in patients with active UC and CD. METHODS: Diet, the Harvey-Bradshaw Activity Index (HBAI), inflammatory parameters, lipoproteins and FA composition were assessed in 60 CD and 34 UC. RESULTS: No differences in clinical parameters were observed in the two groups. Total cholesterol correlated inversely with the number of bowel movements in both groups and directly with BMI in UC. Arachidonic acid correlated inversely with HBAI in UC and total and HDL cholesterol were inversely related to C-reactive protein (CRP) in CD while HDL correlated with CRP in UC. Docosapentaenoic acid was the only polyunsaturated n-3 FA that was correlated to CRP in both groups. Total cholesterol was independently associated in the multiple regression analysis with the number of bowel movements and systemic inflammation. CONCLUSIONS: Total and LDL cholesterol were lower in the active UC and CD than in the healthy subjects and were correlated with the systemic inflammatory status. Phospholipid FA composition was correlated to the systemic inflammatory status, but was unrelated to dietary intake and intestinal disease activity.},

   abstract = {Enteropathy defines abnormalities of the small intestinal mucosa, visible with the light microscope, of various etiologies, that can be separated into acute versus chronic conditions. This review focuses on these areas in which recent progress has been made. Severe infections increase mucosal permeability and induce local expression of co-stimulatory molecules allowing antigen penetration in the mucosa, T cell activation and possible disruption of oral tolerance. Biotherapeutics are of importance in the prevention and treatment of (chronic) enteropathy of infectious origin. Celiac disease and cow's milk protein allergy are key examples of chronic enteropathy. The dietary approach to allergy has evolved to include active stimulation of the immature immune system in order to support the establishment of tolerance. Supplementation with probiotics may provide maturational signals for the lymphoid tissue and improve the balance of pro- and anti-inflammatory cytokines. Enteral polymeric feeding is effective in Crohn's disease. Dietary nucleotides may improve growth and immunity, optimize maturation, recovery and function of rapidly dividing tissue. Adequate dietary lipids are important not just for caloric value but also for immune-modulatory effects. Lipids may prevent allergic sensitization by downregulating inflammatory response (n-3 but not n-6 fatty acids) whilst protecting the epithelial barrier, regulating immune function and modifying the adherence of microbes to the mucosa, thereby contributing to host-microbe interactions.},

   abstract = {Changes in diet greatly affect the mucosal immune system, particularly in diseases such as Crohn's disease and necrotizing enterocolitis. This article examines the hypothesis that alterations in the luminal environment of the intestine regulate the expression of genes in the enterocyte responsible for signaling to immune cells. Genes expressed by the epithelium orchestrate leukocytes in the lamina propria. For example, chemokine expression in the mouse intestinal epithelium, through transgenic means, induced the recruitment of neutrophils and lymphocytes into intestinal tissues. Diet alters the expression of the genes responsible for signaling by a variety of pathways. The introduction of a normal diet to a weanling mouse up-regulates MHC class II expression through a particular isoform of the class II transactivator, a protein that acts in the nucleus. SCFA concentrations in the intestinal lumen vary markedly with diet. SCFAs increase IL-8 and insulin-like growth factor binding protein-2 expression by inhibiting histone deacetylase activity in the enterocyte. Down-regulation of gene expression by butyrate can act through acetylation of the inhibitory transcription factor Sp3. The review therefore describes a number of molecular pathways, explaining how changes in diet may alter leukocyte recruitment by regulating enterocyte gene expression. Myofibroblasts enhance enterocyte chemotactic activity by cleaving inactive precursors; and myofibroblast genes also are regulated by SCFA. It is likely that other similar regulatory mechanisms remain to be discovered.},

Ecological treatments including probiotics, prebiotics, and synbiotics are actively studied in Crohn's disease (CD), ulcerative colitis (UC) and pouchitis. We review herein the literature on the rational use of probiotics in IBD considering efficacy (as evaluated in randomized controlled trials), mechanisms of action and safety issues. A probiotic effect is strictly restricted to one defined strain and cannot be generalized from one to another. There is evidence of efficacy of some probiotic drugs in pouchitis (VSL#3), and in the prevention of recurrence of UC (Escherichia coli Nissle 1917). However, the evidence for efficacy of probiotic drugs in CD is still low as well as that of dietary ecological treatments. Despite an ecological (hopefully nutritional) treatment of IBD is promising, many questions remain unanswered and further clinical and fundamental studies are needed.},

   abstract = {CONTEXT: As patients look to complementary therapies for management of their diseases, it is important that the physician know the effectiveness and/or lack of effectiveness of a variety of dietary approaches/interventions. Although the pathogenesis of the inflammatory bowel diseases (ulcerative colitis and Crohn's disease) is not fully understood, many suspect that diet and various dietary factors may play a modulating role in the disease process. EVIDENCE ACQUISITION: The purpose of this article is to present some of what is known about various dietary/nutritional factors in inflammatory bowel disease, with inclusion of evidence from various studies regarding their putative effect. MedLINE was searched (1965-present) using combinations of the following search terms: diet, inflammatory bowel disease, Crohn's disease, and ulcerative colitis. Additionally, references of the articles obtained were searched to identify further potential sources of information. EVIDENCE SYNTHESIS: While much information is available regarding various dietary interventions/supplements in regard to inflammatory bowel disease, the lack of controlled trials limits broad applicability. Probiotics are one of the few interventions with promising results and controlled trials. CONCLUSION: While there are many potential and promising dietary factors that may play a role in the modulation of inflammatory bowel disease, it is prudent to await further controlled studies before broad application/physician recommendation in the noted patient population.},

   abstract = {Diarrhea continues to be a prevalent symptom in patients with inflammatory bowel disease (IBD), requiring a wide differential diagnosis to define the pathophysiologic mechanisms in individual patients. It is essential that physicians properly evaluate complaints of diarrhea by assessing both patient symptoms and potential physiologic impacts on fluid and electrolyte status. Underlying mechanisms of diarrhea with IBD are the location, extent, and severity of inflammation; malabsorption; altered motility; and iatrogenic causes such as medications, diet, and antibiotic-associated colitis (eg, Clostridium difficile). When treating diarrhea, physicians need to control inflammatory activity using appropriate treatment algorithms. Therapies include aminosalicylates, corticosteroids, immune modifiers, and, most recently, biologic treatment. Other medications, including loperamide, diphenoxylate, codeine sulfate, and tinctures of opium, slow motility and increase the absorption of fluids and nutrients. For iatrogenic issues, medications that cause diarrhea should be withdrawn and individual diets modified. Not all diarrheas in the IBD patient are the same; therefore, it is essential to tailor therapies according to presumed etiologies. Antidiarrheal agents are not recommended in extremely ill patients and those with known hypersensitivity or evidence of obstruction or colonic dilation, fever, or abdominal tenderness. Concomitant use of loperamide with diphenoxylate and atropine should be avoided in early pregnancy.},

   abstract = {BACKGROUND: Duodenal Crohn's disease (DCD) has been reported to occur in 0.5% to 4% of patients with Crohn's disease. When patients fail to respond to conservative therapy or severe narrowing of the duodenum develops, operation is required. The recent literature is limited in description of surgical treatment of such patients. We reviewed our experience with surgical management and outcomes in patients with DCD, including outcomes of laparoscopic bypass procedures. STUDY DESIGN: A retrospective review was undertaken of all patients who underwent surgical intervention for DCD between 1995 and 2006. Data collected included demographics, clinical presentation, operative and hospital course, and postoperative followup. RESULTS: Thirty patients had surgical intervention for DCD during the selected period. Four patients had duodenoenteric fistulas, resulting from complications of their disease in the distal gastrointestinal tract. Operations done for intrinsic DCD were: open bypass (n = 11), laparoscopic bypass (n = 13), and stricturoplasty (n = 2). Only one vagotomy was done. Mean followup was 58 months (range 6 to 144 months). Patients resumed oral diet 3.0 days after laparoscopic bypass, with mean discharge of 6.9 days, as compared with 4.4 days and 12.2 days after open bypass, respectively. In the early postoperative period (0 to 30 days), six major complications (n=5, 19%): persistent obstruction, anastomotic leak, small bowel obstruction, anastomotic bleeding (two patients), and respiratory failure, developed in four patients in the open (36%) and one patient in the laparoscopic (8%) bypass group. There were two more complications during longterm followup, for an overall major morbidity rate of 27%. Two patients experienced recurrence requiring revision (one in the open group and one in the laparoscopic group). Gastroduodenal ulcers requiring operation did not develop in any of the patients. CONCLUSIONS: Surgery is a viable and safe option for patients with intractable duodenal Crohn's disease. The laparoscopic approach during a bypass procedure, as opposed to an open bypass, may result in faster recovery, less morbidity, and comparable recurrence rate. There is no role for vagotomy in bypass procedures.},

   abstract = {BACKGROUND: Respiratory symptoms are over-represented in inflammatory bowel disease. There are similarities between the epidemiology of inflammatory bowel disease and that of respiratory conditions for which an adverse influence of salicylate has been identified. Natural salicylates exist within our diet. AIMS: To determine whether a lower intake of dietary salicylates is associated with less active inflammatory bowel disease and fewer concurrent respiratory symptoms. PATIENTS AND METHODS: Respiratory status, inflammatory bowel disease activity, quality of life, and dietary habits were established in 73 patients with Crohn's disease and 69 with ulcerative colitis, using a self-administered questionnaire and peak expiratory flow rate readings. Harvey-Bradshaw and Simple Birmingham/Royal Free Colitis indices, an internally validated respiratory score, and estimated weekly dietary salicylate intake, were calculated for each patient. RESULTS: There was at least one respiratory symptom in 63.4% of patients. The commonest underlying respiratory diagnosis was asthma. Respiratory impairment was similar in ulcerative colitis and Crohn's disease; 56.3% of Crohn's disease patients with an active respiratory diagnosis had other extra-intestinal manifestations. The dietary salicylate intake was independent of respiratory status, but inversely correlated with ulcerative colitis activity (dietary salicylate intake 37.0mg versus 21.4mg for low and higher Simple Birmingham/Royal Free Colitis index, respectively; p<0.02). A similar association was not seen in Crohn's disease. CONCLUSIONS: Respiratory impairment is common in inflammatory bowel disease. Higher intake of dietary salicylates is associated with less active colitis and possibly causally so.},

   abstract = {Nutritional therapy for active Crohn's disease (CD) is an underutilised form of treatment in adult patients, though its use is common in the paediatric population. There is evidence that nutritional therapy can effectively induce remission of CD in adult patients. Enteral nutrition therapy is safe and generally well tolerated. Meta-analysis data suggest that corticosteroids are superior to nutritional treatment for induction of remission in active CD. However, the potential side effects of such pharmacotherapy must be taken into consideration. This review examines the evidence for the efficacy of elemental and polymeric diets, and the use of total parenteral nutrition in active CD.},

   abstract = {OBJECTIVES: Evaluate the nutritional status of patients with inactive or mildly active Crohn's disease (CD), and identify possible causes for potential deficiencies. METHODS: A total of 78 CD patients and 80 healthy controls were evaluated in respect of nutritional status, dietary intake, and life styles factors. RESULTS: These 73/78 CD patients were on immunomodulating therapies. Mean body mass index (BMI) was lower in patients as compared to controls (P= 0.006) but 32% of CD patients and 33.8% of controls had a BMI > 25, whereas 8% and 23.8% in each group, respectively, were obese (BMI > 30Kg/m(2)). Fat free mass was significantly decreased in both genders (P < 0.05) whereas fat mass was decreased only in males (P= 0.01). Energy intake was significantly lower in CD patients (P < 0.0001) and we observed significantly lower adjusted mean daily intakes of carbohydrates, monounsaturated fat, fiber, calcium, and vitamins C, D, E, and K (P < 0.05). 29% of patients had excluded grains from their usual diet, 28% milk, 18% vegetables, and 11% fruits. Milk exclusion resulted in a significantly lower consumption of calcium and vitamin K (P < 0.001) and the exclusion of vegetables was associated to a lower consumption of vitamins C and E (P < 0.05). Physical activity was significantly lower in CD patients (P= 0.01) and this lack of physical activity was inversely correlated with increased fat mass percentage (r=-0.315, P= 0.001). CONCLUSIONS: Results showed that the most prevalent form of malnutrition in CD patients was an excess of body weight, which was concomitant with an inadequate dietary intake, namely micronutrients, clearly related to dietary exclusion of certain foods.},

   abstract = {BACKGROUND: Tumor necrosis factor-alpha (TNF-alpha) may contribute to the alterations in protein and energy metabolism present in children with Crohn's disease (CD), who frequently suffer from growth disturbance. We hypothesized that anti-TNF-alpha therapy would reduce protein losses, due to decreased proteolysis and increased protein synthesis, and that anti-TNF-alpha therapy would decrease resting energy expenditure. METHODS: Children with active CD underwent metabolic assessment immediately before and 2 weeks following initial infliximab infusion. Using the stable isotopes [d5] phenylalanine and [1-13C] leucine, 2 independent measures of protein metabolism were determined during fasting and in response to parenteral nutrition. Energy expenditure, determined by indirect calorimetry, was measured in fasting and parenterally fed states. RESULTS: Fifteen children completed the study. Following infliximab therapy, significant reductions in proteolysis (P < 0.05) were noted in the fasting state (8%-11%) and during parenteral nutrition infusion (10%-12%). Phenylalanine utilization for protein synthesis decreased significantly (8%-13%) following infliximab (P < 0.05). Protein balance was not significantly altered. No significant changes in energy expenditure were observed following infliximab in fasting or parenterally fed states. Supplementation with parenteral nutrition resulted in significantly decreased proteolysis (8%-21%; P < 0.05), increased protein synthesis (37%-45%; P < 0.01), and improved protein balance (P < 0.01) compared to the fasting state. CONCLUSIONS: Following the initial infliximab infusion in children with CD, proteolysis and protein synthesis were significantly reduced in the fasting and parenterally fed states. Supplementation with parenteral nutrition resulted in significant improvements in protein metabolism compared to the fasting state both before and after infliximab therapy.},

There is no information concerning insulin resistance and substrate metabolism in children with Crohn's disease after anti-TNF-alpha therapy. Our aim was to describe changes in carbohydrate and lipid metabolism in children with active Crohn's disease after their initial dose of infliximab. Children with active Crohn's disease underwent measurement of plasma insulin and glucose just before and 2 wk after their initial infusion of infliximab, an anti-TNF-alpha antibody. In addition, resting energy expenditure, with determination of both carbohydrate and lipid oxidation rates, was determined. Measurements were conducted in both fasting and parenterally fed states. Despite no changes in resting energy expenditure, a significant reduction (p < 0.05) in RQ (5%) and carbohydrate oxidation rate (24%), with a corresponding increase in lipid oxidation rate (42%) was found during parenteral nutrition infusion. No differences in plasma insulin, glucose, and insulin resistance were noted when comparing pre- and postinfliximab measurements.},

The aim of this study was to determine the effects of anti-TNF-alpha therapy on albumin and fibrinogen synthesis during both fasting and parenteral nutrition infusion in pediatric patients with active Crohn disease. PATIENTS AND METHODS: Children with active Crohn disease scheduled for their initial dose of infliximab underwent assessment immediately before and 2 weeks following infliximab infusion. Using the stable isotope [d5] phenylalanine, rates of fractional and absolute albumin and fibrinogen synthesis were calculated. Measurements were made in both the fasting and parenterally fed states. RESULTS: Fifteen children (mean age 14.9 +/- 0.3) completed the study. The mean serum albumin changed from 3.59 +/- 0.08 to 3.66 +/- 0.04 g/dL, and the mean fibrinogen level decreased from 230 +/- 17 to 187 +/- 8 mg/dL (P < 0.05) following infliximab therapy. During fasting, there were no changes in albumin and fibrinogen synthesis rates following infliximab. During parenteral nutrition infusion, the fractional albumin synthesis rate changed from 11.8% to 15.1%/day (P = 0.06), and the absolute albumin synthesis rate increased from 192 to 248 mg x kg(-1) x day(-1) (P < 0.05), whereas no changes in fibrinogen synthesis rates were observed. Synthesis rates of albumin and fibrinogen were increased during parenteral nutrition infusion compared with the fasting state. CONCLUSIONS: Following infliximab therapy, during parenteral nutrition infusion, albumin synthesis increased significantly. Conversely, serum fibrinogen levels decreased following infliximab therapy in the absence of significant change in synthesis rates.},

The ultimate goal of nutrigenomics is the development of foods that can be matched to individual human genotypes in order to benefit the health of those individuals. This paper discusses how personalised, nutrigenomic foods might be developed. Early results from research into food fractions that have the potential to ameliorate Crohn's disease are presented along with illustrations of candidate foods. Issues covering food customisation, consumer response and the ethics of genetic testing for food selection are also discussed briefly.},

   abstract = {OBJECTIVES: There is no clear evidence that dietary proteins aggravate Crohn's disease (CD). We aimed to clarify the antibody response to dietary proteins in CD. METHODS: Antibody to porcine pancreatic amylase (PPA) a protease-resistant dietary protein (anti-PPA), was examined in CD patients (N = 104), ulcerative colitis (UC) patients (N = 85), and healthy controls (N = 83), and its relationship with the clinical characteristics of CD was investigated. Antibodies to casein and ovalbumin, anti-Saccharomyces cerevisiae antibodies (ASCA), and antibodies to I2 from Pseudomonas fluorescens (anti-I2) were also examined. RESULTS: Thirty-eight percent (39/104) of the CD patients expressed anti-PPA antibodies, and this percentage was significantly higher as compared with the control group (5%, 4/83) and the UC group (9%, 8/85) (P < 0.001). A significantly higher level of anti-PPA antibodies was detected in patients with "small bowel disease-dominant" CD than in those with "colitis-dominant" CD (P < 0.05). Antibodies to casein and ovalbumin were not specifically expressed in CD patients. As ASCA was detected in 33% and anti-I2 in 46% of the CD patients, 72% of the CD patients were found positive for at least one of the three antibodies including anti-PPA antibodies. CONCLUSIONS: CD patients showed a specific antibody response to PPA, as compared with UC patients and controls. There was a significantly higher level of anti-PPA antibody in patients with "small bowel disease-dominant" CD, suggesting that dietary proteins could play a role in the inflammatory response in CD patients with small bowel disease. Anti-PPA antibodies combined with ASCA/anti-I2 may be useful for the diagnosis of CD.},

   abstract = {BACKGROUND: In children with inflammatory bowel disease (IBD) it is not known whether reductions in bone mineral density (BMD) are a consequence of bone turnover alterations and if BMD improves with treatment. METHODS: In a cohort of children with IBD, we prospectively measured indicators of bone remodeling, body mass index (BMI), disease activity, intact parathyroid hormone, serum IL-6, and insulin-like growth factor-I at diagnosis and then every 6 months for 2 years. BMD was determined annually using dual x-ray absorptiometry (DXA). BMD Z-scores were calculated using height/age. Baseline measurements and calcium intake were compared with a group of age- and sex-matched healthy children. RESULTS: We observed that at diagnosis total body BMD Z-score (mean +/- SD) was -0.78 +/- 1.02 for Crohn's disease (CD, n = 58), -0.46 +/- 1.14 for ulcerative colitis (UC, n = 18), and -0.17 +/- 0.95 for control (CL, n = 49) (P < 0.01, CD versus CL). In CD, a BMD Z-score <-1.0 was associated with lower BMI and higher serum IL-6. Patients with CD and UC had low bone turnover. Activation of bone formation paralleled clinical improvement, but BMC gain was less than expected over the 2-year study period, especially in CD. Prednisone use did not correlate with low BMD. CONCLUSIONS: Decreased bone turnover occurs in children newly diagnosed with IBD. Although indicators of osteoblast activity increase with clinical improvement, bone mineral accrual does not accelerate. Children with low BMI may be considered for BMD screening, since they are at risk for low bone mass.},

We have reported the effectiveness of 'half elemental diet (ED)' as maintenance therapy for patients with Crohn's disease (CD). The aim of this study was to evaluate the QOL of CD patients and medical costs of half-ED. METHODS: Fifty-one CD patients in remission were randomly assigned to a half-ED group (n=26) or a free diet group (n=25). The primary outcome measure was the occurrence of relapse during a 2-year period. This time, we investigated the QOL of the patients and medical costs of half-ED, as secondary outcomes. QOL was evaluated using the Japanese version of the IBDQ scoring system, and medical costs were calculated monthly from the receipts. RESULTS: IBDQ score was not significantly different between the two groups at 1 and 13 months after the start of maintenance treatment. Medical costs were not significantly different between them either. This study showed that half-ED therapy did not affect the treatment of CD patients, neither regarding their QOL nor medical costs. CONCLUSION: This study has confirmed this half-ED therapy is beneficial for patients with Crohn's disease.},

The advent of infliximab has recently brought a change in treatment, but the long-term side effects of this agent remain uncertain. In contrast, nutritional therapy produces no drug-induced side effects and is effective in inducing and maintaining remission. However, sufficient efficacy cannot be expected in patients in whom compliance with nutritional regimens gradually decreases owing to unpalatability. In these cases, combination therapy with agents such as immunosuppressors and infliximab may be useful.},

A 1-year prospective study of 76 patients with Crohn disease was conducted. The criterion for eligibility was a Crohn Disease Activity Index score of 150 or lower for at least 1 month. The primary end point was defined as the relapse-free interval from the baseline until the first relapse. Fat intake was assessed using a validated diet history questionnaire. The degree of dietary temperance was assessed using a single-item nominal scale. The Cox proportional hazards model was used to evaluate the influence of diet. Crohn disease relapse was seen in 25 patients (33%), and 47 patients (62%) remained in continuous remission. A decreased ratio of n-6 polyunsaturated fatty acid (PUFA) to n-3PUFA (odds ratio = .38; p = .005) was associated with a poor prognosis. Dietary temperance also was significantly associated with prognosis (p = .014). More moderate dietary temperance decreased the risk of relapse (odds ratio = .22; p = .006). Effective prevention of relapse for Crohn disease patients might be achieved through moderate dietary temperance, particularly when the disease condition is unstable.},

   abstract = {A rising trend in the incidence and prevalence of inflammatory bowel disease (IBD) in Asia has been recognized for the past two decades. It has been postulated that this phenomenon may be related to the westernization of lifestyles, including changes in dietary habits and environmental changes such as improved sanitation and industrialization. Previously we reported that the incidence and prevalence rates of IBD in Asia were low compared with the West, but there was a notably rising secular trend. In this review, we summarize the recent epidemiological data in Asia, characterize the clinical features, risk factors and genetic susceptibility of Asian IBD patients, and compare these to those of Western IBD patients. In the past decade, the incidence and prevalence of IBD reported across Asia, particularly in East Asia, has continued to increase. Familial clustering is generally uncommon in East Asia but appears to be higher in West Asia. The genetic susceptibilities in Asian IBD patients differ from those of White patients, as NOD2/CARD15 mutations are much less common. The clinical phenotypes and complication rates of Asian IBD resemble the White population in general, but with some differences, including lower surgical rates, higher prevalence of males, and higher prevalence of ileocolonic involvement among East Asian Crohn's disease patients, and a low frequency of primary sclerosing cholangitis among IBD patients in East and Southeast Asia.},

We aimed (i) to phenotype these intestinal pigment cells (PC) in archival tissue specimens and (ii) to establish whether PC phenotype is altered in inflammatory conditions, especially Crohn's disease (CD). METHODS: PCs contained within PP were identified by routine haematoxylin and eosin (H&E) staining and dark field microscopy of archival ileal sections for: adenocarcinoma (n=16), colonic CD (n=23), non-CD colitis (n=10). Paraffin-embedded serial sections were graded for microscopic inflammation and then investigated immunohistochemically with antibodies against CD68, MAC387, CD14, CD11b, CD15, CD1a, S100, HLA-DR, CD86 and Cathepsin D. Analyses were by light and confocal microscopies. RESULTS: The majority of PCs were CD68 positive (circa 80%) with a minority (circa 20%) staining for MAC387. Microparticles were mainly identified within cathepsin D negative lysosomal compartments. Histological inflammatory grade and disease type had no influence on cell phenotype. CONCLUSIONS: The microparticle-containing PCs of the PP base are mainly mature macrophages (CD68) of low metabolic and immunological activity. There is no evidence of differential PC phenotype or activation in differing disease states, including CD.},

   abstract = {BACKGROUND: The anti-inflammatory effects of n-3 (omega-3 fatty acids, fish oil) have been suggested to be beneficial in chronic inflammatory disorders such as inflammatory bowel disease. OBJECTIVES: To systematically review the efficacy and safety of n-3 for maintaining remission in Crohn's disease (CD). SEARCH STRATEGY: The following databases were searched from their inception without language restriction: Cochrane Central Register of Controlled Trials, MEDLINE, EMBASE, Healthstar, PubMed, and ACP journal club. Experts were contacted for unpublished data. SELECTION CRITERIA: Randomized placebo-controlled trials (RCT) of n-3 for maintenance of remission in CD were included. Studies must have enrolled patients of any age group, who were in remission at the time of recruitment, and were followed for at least six months. The intervention must have been fish oil or n-3 given in pre-defined dosage. Co-interventions were allowed only if they were balanced between the study groups. The primary outcome was relapse rate and secondary outcomes were change in disease activity scores, time to first relapse and adverse events. DATA COLLECTION AND ANALYSIS: Two independent investigators reviewed studies for eligibility, extracted the data and assessed study quality using Jadad's criteria. Meta-analysis was performed using RevMan 4.2 software, weighted by the Mantel-Haenszel method. Random or fixed effect models were used according to degree of heterogeneity and subgroup analyses were performed to address heterogeneity. MAIN RESULTS: Four studies were eligible for inclusion. There was a non statistically significant benefit of n-3 therapy for maintaining remission (RR 0.64; 95%CI 0.4 to 1.03; P = 0.07). However, the studies were both clinically and statistically heterogeneous (P = 0.01, I(2) = 72%). Three studies used enteric coated capsules (positive effects) and one ordinary gelatin capsules (no advantage). Subgroup analyses of studies which used enteric coated capsules revealed a statistically significant benefit for maintenance of remission (RR 0.49; 95% CI 0.35 to 0.69; RD 0.31; 95% CI 0.19 to 0.43); number needed to treat to prevent relapse in 1 year was 3 (95% CI 2 to 5; I(2) = 19%). However, the total number of patients enrolled in these studies was small (n = 166). No significant adverse events were recorded in any of the studies and not enough data were available to analyze the other secondary outcomes. AUTHORS' CONCLUSIONS: Omega 3 fatty acids are safe and may be effective for maintenance of remission in CD when used in enteric coated capsules. However, there are not sufficient data to recommend the routine use of n-3 for maintenance of remission in CD. The small number of patients in the included studies warrants further larger RCTs.},

The immune response and inflammation are mediated by polyunsaturated fatty acids and influenced by dietary fats and lipid metabolism. This study examined the qualitative and quantitative fat intake of IBD patients and healthy controls on plasma phospholipid and erythrocyte membrane phospholipid (EMP) fatty acid content. Measurement of the fatty acid composition of plasma phospholipid and EMP were performed in 29 UC patients, 20 CD patients, and 31 healthy controls. Anthropometric characteristics and data on dietary intake were also collected. We observed significantly lower lipid intake in UC and CD patients vs controls. The UC and CD patients had significantly higher levels of linoleic acid in their EMP than did controls. There were no significant differences in the levels of n-3 polyunsaturated fatty acids, but there were significantly higher levels of the n-6 in the EMP of UC and CD patients compared with controls. The significant differences persisted after the data were adjusted for potential confounders and lipid intake. Higher levels of linoleic acids and n-6 fatty acids, which are involved in production of proinflammatory mediators, were found in IBD patients compared with controls, thereby implicating n-6 fatty acids in the pathophysiology of the disease.},

   abstract = {Research into Crohn's disease has recently been focused on the genetics of the patient, the gastrointestinal flora, the gut epithelium and mucosal immune responses. For over 60 years pathologists have reported that the fundamental alteration in Crohn's disease occurs in regional lymphatics of the intestine--the disease is a lymphocytic and granulomatous lymphangitis. At an earlier time, experimental sclerosis of regional intestinal lymphatics of the pig produced a chronic segmental enteritis with many features of Crohn's disease, including lymphocytic and granulomatous lymphangitis of the bowel wall and enteroenteric and enterocutaneous fistulas. In Crohn's disease, differences in the anatomic distribution of vasa recta appear to explain long-segment disease of the ileum and short-segment disease of the more proximal intestine. A variety of bacteria and viruses cause lymphangitis, suggesting that microorganisms may be at the centre of the basic changes in Crohn's disease. Dietary antigens and lipids are worthy of consideration as well. Now that antibodies to label lymphatics are available, attention should be directed at defining the initial damage to lymphatic endothelium and agents that might be responsible.},

   abstract = {Primary intestinal lymphangiectasia (PIL) is a rare disorder characterized by dilated intestinal lacteals resulting in lymph leakage into the small bowel lumen and responsible for protein-losing enteropathy leading to lymphopenia, hypoalbuminemia and hypogammaglobulinemia. PIL is generally diagnosed before 3 years of age but may be diagnosed in older patients. Prevalence is unknown. The main symptom is predominantly bilateral lower limb edema. Edema may be moderate to severe with anasarca and includes pleural effusion, pericarditis or chylous ascites. Fatigue, abdominal pain, weight loss, inability to gain weight, moderate diarrhea or fat-soluble vitamin deficiencies due to malabsorption may also be present. In some patients, limb lymphedema is associated with PIL and is difficult to distinguish lymphedema from edema. Exsudative enteropathy is confirmed by the elevated 24-h stool alpha1-antitrypsin clearance. Etiology remains unknown. Very rare familial cases of PIL have been reported. Diagnosis is confirmed by endoscopic observation of intestinal lymphangiectasia with the corresponding histology of intestinal biopsy specimens. Videocapsule endoscopy may be useful when endoscopic findings are not contributive. Differential diagnosis includes constrictive pericarditis, intestinal lymphoma, Whipple's disease, Crohn's disease, intestinal tuberculosis, sarcoidosis or systemic sclerosis. Several B-cell lymphomas confined to the gastrointestinal tract (stomach, jejunum, midgut, ileum) or with extra-intestinal localizations were reported in PIL patients. A low-fat diet associated with medium-chain triglyceride supplementation is the cornerstone of PIL medical management. The absence of fat in the diet prevents chyle engorgement of the intestinal lymphatic vessels thereby preventing their rupture with its ensuing lymph loss. Medium-chain triglycerides are absorbed directly into the portal venous circulation and avoid lacteal overloading. Other inconsistently effective treatments have been proposed for PIL patients, such as antiplasmin, octreotide or corticosteroids. Surgical small-bowel resection is useful in the rare cases with segmental and localized intestinal lymphangiectasia. The need for dietary control appears to be permanent, because clinical and biochemical findings reappear after low-fat diet withdrawal. PIL outcome may be severe even life-threatening when malignant complications or serous effusion(s) occur.},

There is evidence that gut barrier dysfunction may act as a primary disease mechanism in intestinal disorders. The aim of the present study was to evaluate the barrier function towards sugars after the appropriate treatment of celiac disease and Crohn's disease patients and compare the results with those obtained with healthy subjects. Fifteen healthy volunteers, 22 celiac disease patients after 1 year of a gluten-free diet, and 31 Crohn's disease patients in remission were submitted to an intestinal permeability test with 6.0 g lactulose and 3.0 g mannitol. Six-hour urinary lactulose excretion in Crohn's disease patients was significantly higher than in both celiac disease patients (0.42 vs 0.15%) and healthy controls (0.42 vs 0.07%). Urinary lactulose excretion was significantly higher in celiac disease patients than in healthy controls (0.15 vs 0.07%). Urinary mannitol excretion in Crohn's disease patients was the same as healthy controls (21 vs 21%) and these values were significantly higher than in celiac disease patients (10.9%). The lactulose/mannitol ratio was significantly higher in Crohn's disease patients in comparison to celiac disease patients (0.021 vs 0.013) and healthy controls (0.021 vs 0.003) and this ratio was also significantly higher in celiac disease patients compared to healthy controls (0.013 vs 0.003). In spite of treatment, differences in sugar permeability were observed in both disease groups. These differences in the behavior of the sugar probes probably reflect different mechanisms for the alterations of intestinal permeability.},

   abstract = {Patients with bile acid malabsorption typically present with chronic, watery diarrhea. Bile acids recirculate between the liver and small intestine in the enterohepatic circulation. They are reabsorbed in the distal small intestine, and normally only a small fraction of the bile acid pool is lost to the colon during each cycle. In patients with bile acid malabsorption, a larger amount of bile acids is spilled into the colon, where the acids stimulate electrolyte and water secretion, which results in loose to watery stools. The common causes of bile acid malabsorption are ileal resection and diseases of the terminal ileum (Crohn's disease and radiation enteritis), which result in a loss of bile acid transporters and, consequently, diminished reabsorption. Bile acid malabsorption also has been documented in a small group of patients with chronic, watery diarrhea who have no demonstrable ileal disease (idiopathic bile acid malabsorption). The amount of bile acid loss to the colon determines the clinical presentation. Patients with mild to moderate bile acid malabsorption present with watery diarrhea and generally respond very well to treatment (with abolishment of diarrhea) with bile acid binders such as cholestyramine. Patients with more severe bile acid malabsorption have both diarrhea and steatorrhea. Treatment with cholestyramine is of no benefit in this group of patients and may, in fact, worsen steatorrhea. These patients are best treated with a low-fat diet supplemented with medium-chain triglycerides.},

The aim of this prospective study was to investigate the impacts of long-term enteral nutrition on clinical and endoscopic disease activities and mucosal tissue cytokines in patients with quiescent CD. METHODS: Forty patients with CD who achieved clinical remission were included. Of these, 20 received continuous elemental diet (Elental) infusion during the nighttime and a low-fat diet during the daytime (EN group) and 20 received neither nutritional therapy nor food restriction (non-EN group). With these regimens, all 40 patients were monitored for 1 year. Further, ileocolonoscopy was performed at entry, at 6 and 12 months, and mucosal biopsies were taken for cytokine assays. RESULTS: On an intention-to-treat basis, 5 patients (25%) in the EN group and 13 (65%) in the non-EN group had a clinical relapse during the 1-year observation (P = 0.03). The mean endoscopic inflammation (EI) scores were not significantly different between the groups at both entry and 6 months, but at 12 months EI scores were significantly higher in the non-EN group than in the EN group (P = 0.04). Additionally, the mucosal tissue interleukin (IL)-1beta, IL-6, and tumor necrosis factor (TNF)-alpha levels significantly increased with time in the non-EN group (entry versus 12 months, IL-1beta, P = 0.02; IL-6, P = 0.002; TNF-alpha, P = 0.001). In the EN group these cytokines did not show a significant increase. CONCLUSIONS: Long-term enteral nutrition in patients with quiescent CD has a clear suppressive effect on clinical and endoscopic disease activities and the mucosal inflammatory cytokine levels.},

   abstract = {BACKGROUND: The impact of enteral nutrition on post-operative recurrence has not been properly examined. AIM: To investigate the impact of enteral nutrition using an elemental diet on clinical and endoscopic recurrence after resection for Crohn's disease. METHODS: Forty consecutive patients who underwent resection for ileal or ileocolonic Crohn's disease were studied. After operation, 20 patients continuously received enteral nutritional therapy (EN group), and 20 had neither nutritional therapy nor food restriction (non-EN group). In the EN group, enteral formula (Elental) was infused through a nasogastric tube in the night-time, and low fat foods were taken in the daytime. All patients were followed up regularly for 1 year after operation. Ileocolonoscopy was performed at 6 and 12 months after operation. RESULTS: One patient (5%) in the EN group and seven (35%) in the non-EN group developed clinical recurrence during 1-year follow-up (P = 0.048). Six months after operation, five patients (25%) in the EN group and eight (40%) in the non-EN group developed endoscopic recurrence (P = 0.50). Twelve months after operation, endoscopic recurrence was observed in six patients (30%) in the EN group and 14 (70%) in the non-EN group (P = 0.027). CONCLUSIONS: Our long-term enteral nutritional therapy significantly reduced clinical and endoscopic recurrence after resection for Crohn's disease.},

   abstract = {AIM: As healthcare providers for Crohn's disease, we assume that we have a good understanding of the disease progression and its symptoms. The aim of this study was to gather information about what patients with Crohn's disease think are relevant to their symptoms and what helps them cope with this lifelong benign disease. MATERIALS AND METHODS: A questionnaire was sent to all patients with a diagnosis of Crohn's disease seen in the Digestive Disease Center in the last 5 years. The returned forms were downloaded into a database and sent for analysis. RESULTS: Sixty-two percent of respondents were female. One third were between the ages of 35 and 50 years. Seventy percent were married. Thirty-eight percent had a graduate degree, 19% were unemployed. Fifty percent still smoked, half of them less than one pack a day. Sixty-eight percent said that their symptoms affected work, and one fourth changed jobs due to this. Foods worsened symptoms in 60%, with a decrease in symptoms while on low fiber foods and white meats. Lifestyle change worsened symptoms in 66%. A change in the caregiver was not a significant stressor. More than half used Remicade, with one third stating that it was helpful. Eight percent had never used steroids. Alcohol increased symptoms in 40%. Factors that did not cause a significant change were children at any age, pregnancy, menopause, and hormone replacement therapy. Surgery caused half the patients to improve for many years, although one third felt a lowered self-esteem postoperatively. CONCLUSION: Patients with Crohn's disease should be managed in a more comprehensive manner to provide optimal care. Thus, a team approach that includes a dietician and counselor should be considered as an integral part of this team. This will allow patients to have enhanced skills to cope with changes in their symptoms, whether they are due to the disease itself or the changes in their routine.},
