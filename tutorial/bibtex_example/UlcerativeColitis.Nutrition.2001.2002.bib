   abstract = {OBJECTIVES: To assess the role of esophagogastroduodenoscopy in the evaluation of children with suspected inflammatory bowel disease. METHODS: All children with inflammatory bowel disease who underwent esophagogastroduodenoscopy during their initial evaluation at our institution during a 7-year period (December 1993 to November 2000) were included in the study. RESULTS: The study included 115 patients: 81 with Crohn disease (mean age, 11.34 years; 42 males) and 34 with ulcerative colitis (mean age, 11.79 years; 20 males). Abnormal findings on esophagogastroduodenoscopy were noted in 64% of patients with Crohn disease and 50% of children with ulcerative colitis; histologic abnormalities were found in 81.6% and 70.6% of the patients, respectively. Granulomas were found in the upper gastrointestinal tracts of 23 of 81 patients (28.4%), with the most common site being the gastric mucosa. Nine of these 23 patients had granulomas solely in the upper gastrointestinal tract. Additional unsuspected pathology noted included: candidiasis, hiatal hernia, Helicobacter pylori infection, and giardiasis. CONCLUSIONS: Endoscopic and histologic abnormalities were found in the upper gastrointestinal tracts of a significant number of children with inflammatory bowel disease. While the mechanism(s) underlying these abnormalities in patients with ulcerative colitis is unclear, the pathology can contribute to the patient's clinical condition. Pathology in the upper gastrointestinal tract should not exclude a diagnosis of ulcerative colitis. Granulomas, confirming the diagnosis of Crohn disease, were found in the upper gastrointestinal tracts of 28% of our patients with Crohn disease. In some cases, granulomas were found solely in the upper gastrointestinal tracts. Based on our data, esophagogastroduodenoscopy with biopsy should be performed in all pediatric patients with suspected inflammatory bowel disease.},

   abstract = {BACKGROUND: It has been shown that azathioprine prolongs the response to ciclosporin of steroid-refractory ulcerative colitis, but no specific data are available concerning its toxicity in this indication. AIM AND METHODS: The charts of 21 patients with steroid-refractory ulcerative colitis who received azathioprine overlapping with a successful ciclosporin course were reviewed for the onset of toxicity. The controls consisted of 48 initial responders to steroids who received azathioprine for steroid-dependence or resistance/toxicity. RESULTS: Two of the 21 patients were withdrawn because of hypersensitivity to azathioprine. The remaining 19 were treated for a median of 18 months together with a median daily steroid dose of 35 mg (10-75 mg) to be tapered off. Toxicity (31%) included leukopenia alone (two cases), cholestasis alone (one case), cholestasis and increased amylase (one case), increased amylase alone (one case), and cutaneous infection (one case). The frequency of withdrawal was 21%. The mean daily steroid doses were reduced from 38 mg to 3.8 mg in the study cohort, and from 25 mg to 8 mg in the controls, among whom toxicity (27%) included four cases each of leukopenia and increased amylase, two cases each of alteration of liver enzymes and infection, and one case of gastric intolerance. Ten of the 48 controls (20%) were withdrawn from the study. CONCLUSION: Azathioprine is as effective and safe in the maintenance of the response of patients with steroid-refractory ulcerative colitis to ciclosporin as it is in the treatment of those who respond to steroids.},

   abstract = {BACKGROUND: The purpose of this study was to evaluate retrospectively the value of leukocyte-labeled scintigraphy, ultrasonography, and contrast radiography compared with endoscopy in children suspected of having inflammatory bowel disease (IBD). METHODS: Twenty-eight children (17 boys; mean age, 10.2 years) with IBD based on standard colonoscopic, histologic, and radiologic criteria (16 with Crohn's disease, 5 with ulcerative colitis, 5 with nonspecific colitis, I with granulomatous disease, and I with Beh,cet's disease) were included. Endoscopic, ultrasonographic, and contrast radiologic examinations were realized for 28, 23, and 19 children respectively. RESULTS: Sensitivity and specificity were 75% and 92% for leukocyte-labeled scintigraphy, 39% and 90% for ultrasonography, and 58% and 83% for contrast radiography. The authors noted discontinuous uptake for 14 of 15 true-positive results for patients with Crohn's disease and continuous uptake for 4 of 4 true-positive results for patients with ulcerative colitis. A negative correlation between scan activity index and Lloyd-Still clinical score was found for 11 patients with Crohn's disease (r = -0.77). CONCLUSIONS: Leukocyte-labeled scintigraphy, a noninvasive and reproducible technique, is a useful tool in the diagnosis and therapeutic strategy of IBD, and provides information on the presence, the intensity, and the extent of the disease, particularly in the terminal ileum. Leukocyte-labeled scintigraphy may not replace colonoscopy with biopsies for diagnosis confirmation. Its reliability seems higher than that of ultrasonography.},

   abstract = {The provision of food is thought to promote the maintenance of gut integrity. Nutrients are able to elicit and affect both systemic and mucosal immune responses. Enteral diet therapy has long been known to be efficacious in inflammatory bowel disease (IBD), particularly in childhood Crohn's disease. However, the mechanisms of action of these diets are not clear. Nutritional repletion, direct effects on the gut mucosa or decreased intestinal permeability have all been postulated as being important in nutritional therapy. There is some evidence that the enteral diet has a direct effect on the gut mucosa by reducing cytokine production and the accompanying inflammation, thus leading to decreased intestinal permeability. Modifications of enteral diet composition have been evaluated in many studies. Such modifications include fat and/or protein content and the addition of bioactive peptides. The fatty acid composition of the enteral diet seems to have a much greater impact on its efficacy than modification of the N source. As specific fatty acids are precursors of inflammatory mediators derived from arachidonic acid, the reduction in these components may be beneficial in nutritional therapy for IBD. Addition of bioactive peptides to enteral diet formulas may also have a role; such peptides may have specific growth factor or anti-inflammatory actions. There is still much work to be done to define disease-specific enteral diet formulas that are effective as therapies for both Crohn's disease and ulcerative colitis.},

   abstract = {We studied the molecular events underlying butyrate-induced apoptosis in two different colon cancer cell lines: Caco-2, a well defined cancer cell and RSB, a cell line obtained from a colonic tumor of an ulcerative colitis patient. Caco-2 and RSB cells were exposed to 2, 5 and 10 mmol/L butyrate for 48 h. Caspase-1 was cleaved in Caco-2-cells at all butyrate concentrations, whereas in RSB-cells caspase-1 expression was undetectable. In RSB cells, butyrate dose-dependently induced caspase-3 cleavage, whereas in Caco-2-cells, butyrate up-regulated expression of the caspase-3 active subunit. Caspase-3-specific activity, cytoplasmic nucleosome concentration and growth were directly correlated with butyrate doses in both cell lines; however, the response was more pronounced in Caco-2 than in RSB cells. Expression of the cleaved poly(ADP-ribose) polymerase (PARP) product was elevated in both cell lines at the highest butyrate concentration. Bak expression gradually increased as a function of butyrate concentrations in both cell lines. At 10 mmol/L butyrate, expression increased by fivefold and sevenfold in Caco-2 and RSB cells, respectively. The highest expression of Bcl-2 was observed in control Caco-2 cells, and expression decreased with increasing butyrate concentration. This effect was not observed in RSB cells. Inactivation of caspase-1 with Z-YVAD-FMK abrogated butyrate-induced apoptosis in Caco-2 but not in RSB cells. Inactivation of caspase-3 with Z-DVED-FMK completely inhibited butyrate-induced apoptosis in RSB cells whereas this effect was less pronounced in Caco-2 cells. Our data demonstrate that butyrate-induced apoptosis is activated via different apoptotic pathways in diversely stratified colon cancers.},

   abstract = {Growth failure is common in children with inflammatory bowel disease (IBD) and has been attributed chiefly to undernutrition. Liquid enteral feeding can reverse the calorie deficit and increase growth velocity. The inflammatory process per se may also directly inhibit linear growth. After institution of enteral nutrition, significant changes in serum growth factors and inflammatory indices have been observed before any changes in nutritional parameters [Bannerjee et al., Gastroenterology 2000;118:A526]. In rats with trinitrobenzenesulphonic acid (TNBS)-induced colitis, about 60% of the final growth impairment can be attributed to undernutrition, inflammation accounting for the remaining growth deficit. Young patients with Crohn's disease and growth failure have normal stimulated and spontaneous growth hormone (GH) secretion and reduced plasma concentrations of insulin-like growth factor-1 (IGF-I), suggesting a degree of GH resistance. Rats with TNBS colitis also have normal plasma GH and reduced IGF-I concentrations, mediated by a combination of undernutrition and active inflammation. Immunoneutralization of interleukin-6 (IL-6) increases hepatic IGF-I mRNA expression, plasma concentrations of IGF-I and linear growth. In contrast, administration of anti-tumour necrosis factor-alpha antibodies (TNF-ab) had no effect on IGF-I in this model. TNFab did, however, increase linear growth, suggesting inhibitory effects of TNF-alpha on the growth axis by mechanisms other than reduction in IGF-I. Preliminary data suggests that TNF-alpha inhibits maturation of growth plate chondrocytes. We have identified IL-6 receptors on growth plate chondrocytes but to date have not identified the effect, if any, of IL-6 directly at the growth plate.},

   abstract = {A germinated barley foodstuff (GBF) containing glutamine-rich protein and hemicellulose-rich fiber was made from brewer's spent grain, by physical isolation. Our previous studies demonstrated that GBF supported maintenance of epithelial cell populations, facilitated epithelial repair, and suppressed epithelial nuclear factor kappaB-DNA-binding activity through generating increased short-chain fatty acid (especially butyrate) production by luminal microflora, which includes Bifidobacterium and Eubacterium, thereby preventing experimental colonic injury. The fiber fraction also modulates stool water content because of its high water-holding capacity. The patients with mild to moderate active ulcerative colitis who had been unresponsive to or intolerant of standard treatment received 20-30 g GBF, feeding daily in a non-randomized, open-label fashion. At 4 weeks, this treatment resulted in a significant clinical and endoscopic improvement. The improvement was associated with an increase in stool butyrate concentrations. These results indicate that GBF feeding is a potentially new, attractive prebiotic treatment in patients with ulcerative colitis. The potency of GBF on modulating microflora, as well as the high water-holding capacity, may play an important role in treatment and prolongation of remission in ulcerative colitis.},

Immunologic, environmental, infective and genetic factors equally can play role in their development. Antibodies to an oligomannose epitope of the Saccharomyces cerevisiae demonstrated in 60-70% of the patients with Crohn's disease. The origin and the clinicopathological role are not clarified. It is important that there are no surveys with patients suffering in gluten sensitive enteropathy in the literature. As there are no ASCA survey in Hungary, the aim of this study was to determine the prevalence of the ASCA. The authors examined at their patients the ASCA's occurrence and compared with the clinical picture of the Crohn's disease. The results supported the theory that ASCA positivity correlates with small intestines' Crohn's disease and in these cases both the IgG and IgA type antibodies proved. The antibodies in the sera at the analyzed ASCA positive cases prove a systemic immune response against Saccharomyces cerevisiae and the authors suggest the end of the oral tolerance against the yeast's antigens. The diet restriction (elemental diet, total parenteral nutrition, and fecal diversion) may ameliorate the status of the patients with Crohn's disease. It is speculated that the yeast-free diet as a part of the therapy for the ASCA positive patients can be reasonable: moreover the permanent "forbidding" of the yeast can be an acceptable alternative in case of getting well.},

Subtotal colectomy is frequently offered to such patients to control acute disease and restore immunological and nutritional status prior to a restorative procedure. The role of laparoscopy in this setting is poorly defined. METHODS: The records of 18 patients with poorly controlled fulminant colitis on aggressive immunosuppressive therapy who underwent laparoscopic subtotal colectomy were reviewed. RESULTS: Postoperative complications occurred in six patients (33%). Postoperative length of stay was 5.0 +/- 0.3 days vs 8.8 +/- 1.8 days (p<0.05) for a group of six patients who had undergone open subtotal colectomy for the same indications. Systemic steroids were withdrawn in all patients, and 17 patients subsequently underwent proctectomy and pelvic pouch construction. CONCLUSIONS: The relatively high morbidity rate in these patients is likely related to their compromised status at the time of surgery. Laparoscopic subtotal colectomy in patients with fulminant ulcerative colitis allows for earlier hospital discharge, facilitates subsequent pelvic pouch, construction, and provides an excellent alternative to conventional two- and three-stage surgical treatment.},

The reasons for the discrepancies in the findings could be related to the different study designs, different treatments, overlapping of treatment effects, as well as the variety of treatment formulations and doses used, which have led to results that are, in certain instances, very difficult to explain. Emphasis on a treatment formulation which reduces the incidence of side effects, together with careful selection of patients and experimental design, seems to be associated with benefits, and these studies point to the therapeutic potential for these lipids in the therapy of IBD. It is possible that these fatty acids act by reducing low-grade active inflammation rather than by preventing reinitiation of the inflammatory process from a truly quiescent state. Whether this treatment is applicable to all IBD patients has not been fully elucidated. Nevertheless, taken together, all these studies suggest the effectiveness of these new therapeutic approaches, not only when conventional treatment fails or when it is not possible to treat chronically, but also, in some instances, as first choice.},

Conversely, IFN-gamma and IL-10 production in cells from IL-2 KO mice were refractory to in vitro 1,25-dihydroxyvitamin D3 treatments. In the absence of IL-2, vitamin D was ineffective for suppressing colitis and ineffective for the in vitro downregulation of IL-10 or IFN-gamma production. One target of 1,25-dihydroxyvitamin D3 in the immune system is the IL-2 gene.},

   abstract = {Toxic megacolon belongs to the severe acute complications of inflammatory bowel diseases. The frequency is 1.6-21.4% among patients with ulcerative colitis and 0.3-2% in those with Crohn's disease. The main characteristics of toxic megacolon are toxemia, sepsis and distension of the colon due to the diminished muscular tone, loss of motor activity and increased amount of colonic gas. Sepsis and/or perforation of the large bowel can complicate this situation. The most important diagnostic procedure is the abdominal X-ray. Should the diameter of colonic distension exceed 60 mm, the diagnosis of toxic megacolon has been confirmed. Conservative treatment of toxic megacolon consists of water and electrolyte replacement, total parenteral nutrition, administration of corticosteroids and broad-spectrum antibiotics and repeat patient's prone positioning. If medical therapy is not successful during the first 72 hours, surgical intervention is indicated. The most common procedure is subtotal colonic resection with creation of an ileostomy. Patients with toxic megacolon should be managed at specialised centers, where cooperation of experienced gastroenterologists, surgeons and intensive care experts is possible.},

   abstract = {Inflammatory bowel disease (IBD) comprises two chronic, tissue-destructive, clinical entities Crohn disease (CD) and ulcerative colitis (UC) both apparently caused by immunological overreaction (hypersensitivity) to commensal gut bacteria. Under normal conditions the intestinal immune system shows a down-regulating tone ('oral tolerance') against dietary antigens and the indigenous microbiota. This local homeostasis is disturbed in IBD, leading to hyperactivation of T helper 1 (Th1) cells with abundant secretion of interferon-gamma and tumor necrosis factor (TNF) and production of IgG antibodies against commensal bacteria. In addition, UC includes genetically determined autoimmunity, particularly IgG1-mediated cytotoxic epithelial attack. Breaching of the epithelium is the best-defined event underlying abrogation of oral tolerance, but immune deviation caused by cytokines fiom irritated epithelial cells or subepithelial elements (for example, mast cells, natural killer cells, macrophages) may also be involved. Endogenous infection with local hypersensitivity likewise causes periodontal disease, reflecting 'frustrated' immune elimination mechanisms entertained by antigens from dental plaque. Altogether, perturbation of a tightly controlled cytokine network, with abnormal crosstalk between several cell types, apparently explains the progressive immunopathology of chronic inflammatory mucosal diseases in general. This adverse development will be influenced by numerous immunity genes, the dosage and potential pathogeniciy of commensal bacteria, general health, nutritional status, and psychological factors. Several targets for new therapy have tentatively been identified to block immunopathological mechanisms in IBD, and inhibition of TNF has a striking beneficial effect in CD, supporting a central role of this cytokine.},

   abstract = {OBJECTIVES: Understanding cytokine production patterns in early mucosal lesions of pediatric patients newly diagnosed with inflammatory bowel disease (IBD) may be critical to understanding IBD pathogenesis. Interleukin-6 (IL-6) has a central role in a multitude of immune system reactions; however, inconsistent lamina propria and serum IL-6 has been reported in IBD patients. Newly diagnosed pediatric IBD patients have not previously been evaluated for lamina propria or serum IL-6. METHODS: Serum and intestinal lamina propria biopsy whole organ culture supernatants were evaluated by ELISA for IL-6 obtained from newly diagnosed IBD patients, before initiation of immunomodulatory therapies. RESULTS: Levels of lamina propria IL-6 demonstrated significant correlation with graded severity of histological inflammation (p < 0.001). Log-transformed serum and organ culture IL-6 levels demonstrated significant correlation (p < 0.0001, R2 = 0.6226). Assigning a demarcation level of >400 pg/ml, serum IL-6 concentrations were a superior marker for the presence of microscopic intestinal inflammation than erythrocyte sedimentation rate (ESR), with a sensitivity of 82%, specificity of 100%, positive predictive value of 100%, and negative predictive value of 82%. When evaluating subtypes of IBD, serum IL-6 levels were correlated more significantly with active disease in ulcerative colitis patients (p = 0.01, R2 = 0.74) than in Crohn's disease patients (p = 0.21, R2 = 0.33). CONCLUSIONS: This study outlines graded production of IL-6 in intestinal lamina propria and serum of newly diagnosed pediatric IBD patients, confirming the presence of IL-6 in early IBD patients. In addition, serum IL-6 may be a good predictor of IBD in pediatric patients with suspected or newly diagnosed IBD.},

The aim of this study was to assess the effectiveness of fecal calprotectin as a noninvasive measure of disease activity in childhood inflammatory bowel disease (IBD) by comparison to a modified Lloyd-Still and Green score and laboratory inflammatory indices. METHODS: Spot fecal samples from 37 children with IBD and 31 control children were sent by ordinary mail to the laboratory. Fecal calprotectin concentration was measured by an in-house enzyme linked immunosorbent assay (ELISA). A modified Lloyd-Still & Green score (mLSS) was calculated for each child with IBD within 10 days of obtaining the fecal sample. RESULTS: Compared with control values (median, range) (2.1, 0.5-6.3 mg/L), fecal calprotectin was increased in 16 children with ulcerative colitis, (11.5, 0.6-272.5 mg/L, P < 0.001) and in 21 children with Crohn disease, (14.0, 0.7-59.7 mg/L, P < 0.001). Twelve "moderately affected" children (mLSS of 35-65) had higher fecal calprotectin concentrations (22.2, 2.7-141.7 mg/L) than 25 "mildly affected" children (mLSS > 65), (10.3, 0.6-272.5 mg/L, P = 0.002). For the total IBD group, fecal calprotectin concentration correlated negatively with the mLSS (r = -0.61, P < 0.001). It also correlated negatively with serum albumin concentration (r = -0.49, P = 0.002) and positively with erythrocyte sedimentation rate (r = 0.40, P = 0.01). CONCLUSIONS: Fecal calprotectin seems to reflect bowel inflammation in children with IBD. As a simple, safe, noninvasive test, it has the potential to reduce the number of invasive investigations performed in these children.},

   abstract = {BACKGROUND: Calprotectin is an abundant neutrophil protein, which is extremely stable in feces. This study aimed to validate fecal calprotectin as a marker of bowel inflammation against invasive measures in children with inflammatory bowel disease (IBD), including colitis and small bowel Crohn disease. METHODS: Fecal calprotectin was measured using a simple enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay in 36 spot stool samples from 22 children before colonoscopy and from 14 children before technetium-99 (99Tc) scanning. Using standard scoring systems, the severity of inflammation was assessed macroscopically and histologically at six standard sites in those who underwent colonoscopy and also at six standard sites in those who underwent 99Tc scanning. The subscores from each site were summated to give combined severity and extent scores for macroscopic and for histologic inflammation in the group undergoing colonoscopy and total inflammation in the group undergoing 99Tc scanning. RESULTS: In the 22 children who underwent colonoscopy, median fecal calprotectin was 4.9 mg/L (0.1-272.5 mg/L) (range). Disease groups included six normal cases, nine ulcerative colitis cases, two isolated Crohn colitis cases, two indeterminate colitis cases, and three allergic colitis cases. Fecal calprotectin correlated closely with colonic macroscopic inflammation (r = 0.75, P < 0.001) and histologic inflammation (r = 0.85, P < 0.001). Of the 14 children undergoing 99Tc scanning, 10 had Crohn disease, 3 had ulcerative colitis, and 1 had allergic colitis. Median fecal calprotectin was 9.1 mg/L (0.3-141.7 mg/L), and this correlated closely with the 99Tc scanning score (r = 0.80, P = 0.001). CONCLUSION: Fecal calprotectin correlates closely with the best invasive measures of colonic and small bowel inflammation in childhood inflammatory bowel disease. As a sensitive objective measure of bowel inflammation that is risk-free and noninvasive, fecal calprotectin lends itself particularly to the monitoring of and assessment of therapeutic interventions in children with inflammatory bowel disease.},

   abstract = {The present study was undertaken to investigate the effects of parenteral lipid emulsions (LE) enriched with n-3 fatty acids (n-3 FA) in experimental acute colitis. Seventy-four adult male Wistar rats were randomized into six groups, five of which had acetic acid-induced colitis. The animals received a fat-free diet and water ad libitum in individual metabolic cages. By a central venous catheter, saline was infused (0.5 ml/h) into the control groups CS (without colitis) and CC (with colitis), while the test groups received specific LE for 7 days. The n-3/n-6 FA ratio and the lipidic compositions regarding long chain (LCT) and medium chain (MCT) triglycerides were: group L--1:7.7 (LCT, n = 12), M--1:7.0 (MCT and LCT, n = 12), LW-3--1:4.5 (LCT plus n-3 FA, n = 12) and MW-3--1:3.0 (MCT and LCT plus n-3 FA, n = 13). The frequency of diarrhea, oral intake/body weight ratio, intestinal alterations, macrophage cellularity were evaluated and colonic concentrations of leukotrienes (LTB4, LTC4), prostaglandins (PGE2) and thromboxanes (TXB2) were measured. Groups M, MW-3 and LW-3 had less diarrhea than the CC group (P<0.05). Average oral intake/body weight ratio in MW-3 animals was comparable to the CS and better than the CC group. n-3 FA treated rats (LW-3 and MW-3) presented less intestinal inflammatory alterations than CC rats. Mucosal ulcer formation in MW-3 group did not differ from CS rats. M and MW-3 rats had less macrophages in the colon than the CC group. Compared with CC group, lower concentrations of LTB4 in the CS, LW-3 and MW-3 groups; of PGE2 in the CS, M and MW-3 groups; and of TXB2 in the CS and MW-3 groups were found. Mean concentrations of LTC4 did not differ among the groups. Thus, a LCT-containing LE with a low n-3-n-6 ratio does not modify inflammatory colitis manifestations; LE with a high n-3-n-6 ratio reduces diarrhea, preserves oral intake-weight ratio, attenuates morphological consequences and decreases colonic concentrations of inflammatory mediators; MCT/LCT-containing LE with 1:3 n-3-n-6 ratio exerts the most profound beneficial impact on the inflammatory response.},

   abstract = {Inflammatory Bowel Diseases - ulcerative colitis and Crohn's disease- are chronic gastrointestinal inflammatory diseases of unknown etiology. Decreased oral intake, malabsorption, accelerated nutrient losses, increased requirements, and drug-nutrient interactions cause nutritional and functional deficiencies that require proper correction by nutritional therapy. The goals of the different forms of nutritional therapy are to correct nutritional disturbances and to modulate inflammatory response, thus influencing disease activity. Total parenteral nutrition has been used to correct and to prevent nutritional disturbances and to promote bowel rest during active disease, mainly in cases of digestive fistulae with high output. Its use should be reserved for patients who cannot tolerate enteral nutrition. Enteral nutrition is effective in inducing clinical remission in adults and promoting growth in children. Due to its low complication rate and lower costs, enteral nutrition should be preferred over total parenteral nutrition whenever possible. Both present equal effectiveness in primary therapy for remission of active Crohn's disease. Nutritional intervention may improve outcome in certain individuals; however, because of the costs and complications of such therapy, careful selection is warranted, especially in patients presumed to need total parenteral nutrition. Recent research has focused on the use of nutrients as primary treatment agents. Immunonutrition is an important therapeutic alternative in the management of inflammatory bowel diseases, modulating the inflammation and changing the eicosanoid synthesis profile. However, beneficial reported effects have yet to be translated into the clinical practice. The real efficacy of these and other nutrients (glutamine, short-chain fatty acids, antioxidants) still need further evaluation through prospective and randomized trials.},

   abstract = {OBJECTIVE: To validate bio-electric impedance spectroscopy (BIS) by comparison with other methods for determination of body water compartments in stable subjects with an ileostomy and no or minor small bowel resection for inflammatory bowel disease (IBD). SUBJECTS: Twenty-one subjects were included, age range 36-65 y (female/male=12/9), Crohn's disease (CD), n=14, ulcerative colitis (UC), n=6 and indeterminate colitis (IDC), n=1. METHODS: Fluid compartments were assessed by the use of three independent methods: BIS, dual-energy X-ray absorptiometry (DXA) and dilution techniques (DIL); tritiated water (total body water, TBW); and bromide (extracellular water, ECW), respectively. Intra-cellular water (ICW) was calculated as TBW-ECW. For comparison TBW was also predicted according to an empirical formula. Differences were analysed using Bland-Altman plots. RESULTS: The mean TBW values obtained from the impedance measurement differed in the order of -2.21 (DIL) to 1.41 (DXA) in women and -2.01 (DIL) to 2.61 (DXA) in men, from the measured and derived values of total body water. Prediction of TBW gave values that were close to BIS, with a mean difference of -0.31 in male subjects and +0.51 in female subjects. Assessment of ECW revealed that the mean difference between dilution and impedance was less in women than in men (P<0.01). CONCLUSION: The differences between all methods to assess fluid compartments are pronounced. To further investigate the use of the method in clinical practice for dynamic monitoring of rehydration in ileostomates with acute diarrhoea, repeated measurements together with comparison with weight fluid-balance charts are suggested. SPONSORSHIP: The study was supported by grants from the Swedish Medical Research Council (17X-03117), Goteborgs Lakarsallskap and IB and A Lundbergs forskningsstiftelse.},

   abstract = {Proteinase-activated receptor (PAR)-2, a G-protein-coupled receptor for trypsin and mast cell tryptase, is highly expressed in the intestine. Luminal trypsin and tryptase are elevated in the colon of inflammatory bowel disease patients. We hypothesized that luminal proteinases activate PAR-2 and induce colonic inflammation. Mice received intracolonically PAR-2 agonists (trypsin, tryptase, and a selective PAR-2-activating peptide) or control drugs (boiled enzymes, inactive peptide) and inflammatory parameters were followed at various times after this treatment. Colonic administration of PAR-2 agonists up-regulated PAR-2 expression and induced an inflammatory reaction characterized by granulocyte infiltration, increased wall thickness, tissue damage, and elevated T-helper cell type 1 cytokine. The inflammation was maximal between 4 and 6 hours and was resolved 48 hours after the intracolonic administration. PAR-2 activation also increased paracellular permeability of the colon and induced bacterial trans-location into peritoneal organs. These proinflammatory and pathophysiological changes observed in wild-type mice were not detected in PAR-2-deficient mice. Luminal proteinases activate PAR-2 in the mouse colon to induce inflammation and disrupt the integrity of the intestinal barrier. Because trypsin and tryptase are found at high levels in the colon lumen of patients with Crohn's disease or ulcerative colitis, our data may bear directly on the pathophysiology of human inflammatory bowel diseases.},

   abstract = {Growth failure (GF) is one of the major complications affecting children with inflammatory bowel disease. The faltering is temporary in 40-50% of cases and prolonged in 10-20% in Crohn's disease (CD). Such failure is rare in children with ulcerative colitis (5%). This complication is often associated with retarded bone development and delayed onset of sexual maturation. The delayed linear growth has a variety of causes including insufficient intake due to anorexia and the inflammatory process with increased energy and protein expenditure. Other factors are increased intestinal loss, secondary hypopituitarism and treatment with steroids. Therapeutic strategies of CD in children have changed this last decade by introducing new therapeutic agents such as topic steroids, immunosuppressors, anti-TNF (antibody and notably in children enteral nutrition which has shown its efficacy in inducing remissions of active CD, restoring nutritional status and stimulation of linear growth. The results of a recent prospective multicentric study over 2 years in 82 CD show that severe GF (-2 SD) is initially present in 15% (n = 12), among them 11 remain < -2SD after 2 years of follow-up. Six patients who were on the normal range initially increased their GF during the follow-up (< -2SD) (total 21% < -2SD (n = 17) at 2 years). At inclusion in this group there was no difference in growth velocity, used of steroids, enteral nutrition or severity of CD as compared to the group with no GF. It suggests that new treatment strategy should be developed in the future for this specific complication of paediatric CD.},

   abstract = {Platelet-activating factor (PAF) has been implicated in the pathogenesis of gastrointestinal diseases such as necrotizing enterocolitis, Crohn's disease, and ulcerative colitis. However, neither the physiologic role of PAF in the intestine, nor the mechanisms by which PAF participates in the pathogenesis of disease are well understood. The aim of the present study was to determine the direct effect of PAF on intestinal epithelial cell ion transport, and to delineate the mechanisms of regulation. Ion transport was evaluated by measuring short circuit current (I(sc)) in HT29-CL19A cell monolayers using Ussing chambers. PAF receptor polarity was assessed using domain-selective biotinylation followed by immunoprecipitation and streptavidin blotting of intact epithelial monolayers. PAF (1-200 microM) stimulated I(sc) that followed the direction of a Cl(-) gradient and was specifically inhibited by the Cl(-) channel blockers glybenclamide, 2,2' iminodibenzoic acid and 4,4' diisothiocyanostilbene-2, 2' disulfonic acid, but was unaffected by the inhibition of prostaglandin synthesis with indomethacin. Stimulated I(sc) was only detected after apical addition of PAF, correlating with the results of biotinylation experiments indicating an exclusive apical polarity of the PAF receptor. PAF receptor antagonists CV6209 and octylonium bromide abolished PAF-stimulated I(sc). Thus, mucosal acting PAF directly and specifically stimulates ion transport via activation of an apical Cl(-) channel in intestinal epithelial cell monolayers independent of prostaglandin biosynthesis.},

   abstract = {BACKGROUND: Appendicectomy reduces the risk of having ulcerative colitis. However, its effect on the natural history of ulcerative colitis remains uncertain. AIM: To determine whether appendicectomy reduces the overall severity of ulcerative colitis. PATIENTS AND METHODS: Appendicectomy status and smoking habits were specified by direct interview in 638 patients seen consecutively between 1997 and 2000. Severity of ulcerative colitis was assessed by reviewing therapeutic needs from the onset of colitis. Additionally, the annual incidence of flare up was assessed prospectively between 1997 and 2000 in patients who had not been colectomised. RESULTS: The 10 year risk of colectomy was 16 (7)% in previously appendicectomised patients (n=49) compared with 33 (2)% in non-appendicectomised patients (n=589, p=0.05). Cox regression showed that previous appendicectomy and current smoking were independent factors protecting against colectomy (adjusted hazard ratio and 95% confidence intervals: 0.40 (0.20-0.78) and 0.60 (0.40-0.95), respectively). The respective proportions of appendicectomised and non-appendicectomised patients who required oral steroids and immunosuppressive therapy were not significantly different (67% v 70% and 27% v 19%, respectively). Between 1997 and 2000, ulcerative colitis was active for 48% of the time in appendicectomised patients (47 of 98 patient years) and for 62% of the time in non-appendicectomised patients (631 of 1024 patient years; p<0.01). CONCLUSION: Previous appendicectomy is associated with a less severe course of ulcerative colitis. The beneficial effect of appendicectomy on the risk of colectomy is additive to that of current smoking.},

Functional candidate gene association studies during the past few decades have revealed only modest associations between IBD and genetic variants in the HLA genes and a limited number of other genes that are involved in immune regulation and the inflammatory response. Important advances in IBD genetics research have come about from systematic genome searches for IBD loci. The identification of Crohn's disease-associated NOD2 genetic variants that appear to alter the innate immune response to bacteria is a seminal finding that perhaps is the greatest advance toward understanding the pathogenesis of IBD in decades. The future discovery of other IBD genetic risk factors, facilitated by the completion of the human genome sequencing and annotation, may allow the development of better therapies, possibly including preventive therapies, for patients with Crohn's disease and ulcerative colitis.},

   abstract = {Crohn's disease and ulcerative colitis, the two major forms of idiopathic inflammatory bowel disease (IBD), are heritable, complex traits that appear to share some but not all susceptibility loci. We report that transmission/disequilibrium test analysis of a Crohn's disease genome scan dataset has detected an inflammatory bowel disease locus on chromosome 3p26 (nominal P=0.000052 and genome-wide corrected P=0.039 at D3S1297). An allele sharing method shows significant linkage (multipoint lod=3.69) in a larger, independent sample of inflammatory bowel disease-affected sibling pairs. A survey of 16 chromosome 3p26 short tandem repeat polymorphisms in a combined sample of 234 independent nuclear families with 324 IBD-affected sibling pairs shows significant linkage to chromosome 3p26 (multipoint lod=3.78) and significant transmission/disequilibrium test results at two adjacent markers (nominal P values in two different transmission/disequilibrium analysis methods=0.00011 and 0.0011 for the first marker, and 0.00071 and 0.00013 for the second marker). There is highly significant under-transmission of a common allele and modest over-transmission of other alleles at both markers. Families with no transmission to affected individuals of the under-transmitted alleles show significant linkage (multipoint lod=4.50) that is significantly greater in four simulation studies (P=0.0001, 0.0000625, 0.0000625 and 0.0000625, respectively) than the linkage evidence in families with transmission of the under-transmitted alleles (multipoint lod=0.12). Thus, the existence of an inflammatory bowel disease locus on chromosome 3p26 is supported by significant linkage, transmission/disequilibrium and partitioning of linkage evidence.},

However, the resident bacterial flora of the gastrointestinal tract may also be implicated in the pathogenesis of diseases such as inflammatory bowel disease (ulcerative colitis and Crohn disease). The objectives of the Probiotic Research Group based at University College Cork were to isolate and identify lactic acid bacteria exhibiting beneficial probiotic traits, such as bile tolerance in the absence of deconjugation activity, acid resistance, adherence to host epithelial tissue, and in vitro antagonism of pathogenic microorganisms or those suspected of promoting inflammation. To isolate potentially effective probiotic bacteria, we screened the microbial population adhering to surgically resected segments of the gastrointestinal tract (the environment in which they may subsequently be reintroduced and required to function). In total, 1500 bacterial strains from resected human terminal ilea were assessed. From among these organisms, Lactobacillus salivarius subsp. salivarius strain UCC118 was selected for further study. In mouse feeding trials, milk-borne L. salivarius strain UCC118 could successfully colonize the murine gastrointestinal tract. A human feeding study conducted in 80 healthy volunteers showed that yogurt can be used as a vehicle for delivery of strain UCC118 to the human gastrointestinal tract with considerable efficacy in influencing gut flora and colonization. In summary, we developed criteria for in vitro selection of probiotic bacteria that may reflect certain in vivo effects on the host such as modulation of gastrointestinal tract microflora.},

It is essential to provide an accurate diagnosis in children suspected of IBD, as the initial treatment of Crohn disease and ulcerative colitis in children is not the same as it is in adults. While the role of enteral feeding in the treatment of Crohn disease in adults continues to be controversial, there is firm evidence to support the use of enteral feeding as primary therapy for Crohn disease in children. Nutrition is improved by enteral feeding, and growth and pubertal development are promoted, while the systemic toxicity of corticosteroid therapy is avoided. Supplementary nocturnal enteral nutrition (with daytime intake of normal diet) after primary therapy and remission induction may be associated with the prolongation of remission. Drug treatment in children with IBD is characterized by a lack of evidence from controlled trials.},

   abstract = {BACKGROUND: Inflammatory bowel disease (IBD) in adults with primary sclerosing cholangitis (PSC) is characterized by pancolonic involvement, a high frequency of rectal sparing, and an increased risk of pouchitis and colorectal neoplasia. The clinical features of IBD in pediatric patients with PSC have not been well described. The aim of this study was to characterize the frequency, clinical features, and natural history of IBD in pediatric patients diagnosed with PSC. METHODS: A retrospective chart review was performed for all patients 18 years of age or younger diagnosed with PSC seen at the Mayo Clinic between 1975 and 1999. Endoscopic and histologic features and surgical and postsurgical outcomes were recorded. RESULTS: Fifty-two children with PSC were identified. Forty-three patients (84%) were also diagnosed with IBD. In 36 of 43 cases, there was a sufficient diagnostic evaluation to allow a detailed review. Thirty-two of 36 patients (89%) had ulcerative colitis and 4 of 36 patients (11%) had Crohn's disease. In 4 of 36 patients (11%), IBD was asymptomatic. Although the most frequent endoscopic presentation of IBD was universal colitis, endoscopic rectal sparing was frequently noted (27% of colonoscopic studies). Of the four patients diagnosed with Crohn disease, in none did perianal, fistulizing, or stricturing disease develop. Proctocolectomy was performed in six patients (17%); three operations were performed for dysplasia. Pouchitis complicated four of the five ileal pouch-anal anastomoses procedures. CONCLUSIONS: Among pediatric patients (1) PSC without IBD is uncommon; (2) asymptomatic IBD may be associated with PSC; (3) because the time to dysplasia may be accelerated, once the diagnosis of IBD is made in the setting of PSC, heightened endoscopic surveillance may be indicated; (4) pouchitis occurs frequently in these patients.},

   abstract = {Probiotic ingestion can be recommended as a preventative approach to maintaining the balance of the intestinal microflora and thereby enhance 'well-being'. Research into the use of probiotic intervention in specific illnesses and disorders has identified certain patient populations that may benefit from the approach. Undoubtedly, probiotics will vary in their efficacy and it may not be the case that the same results occur with all species. Those that prove most efficient will likely be strains that are robust enough to survive the harsh physico-chemical conditions present in the gastrointestinal tract. This includes gastric acid, bile secretions and competition with the resident microflora. A survey of the literature indicates positive results in over fifty human trials, with prevention/treatment of infections the most frequently reported output. In theory, increased levels of probiotics may induce a 'barrier' influence against common pathogens. Mechanisms of effect are likely to include the excretion of acids (lactate, acetate), competition for nutrients and gut receptor sites, immunomodulation and the formation of specific antimicrobial agents. As such, persons susceptible to diarrhoeal infections may benefit greatly from probiotic intake. On a more chronic basis, it has been suggested that some probiotics can help maintain remission in the inflammatory conditions, ulcerative colitis and pouchitis. They have also been suggested to repress enzymes responsible for genotoxin formation. Moreover, studies have suggested that probiotics are as effective as anti-spasmodic drugs in the alleviation of irritable bowel syndrome. The approach of modulating the gut flora for improved health has much relevance for the management of those with acute and chronic gut disorders. Other target groups could include those susceptible to nosocomial infections, as well as the elderly, who have an altered microflora, with a decreased number of beneficial microbial species. For the future, it is imperative that mechanistic interactions involved in probiotic supplementation be identified. Moreover, the survival issues associated with their establishment in the competitive gut ecosystem should be addressed. Here, the use of prebiotics in association with useful probiotics may be a worthwhile approach. A prebiotic is a dietary carbohydrate selectively metabolised by probiotics. Combinations of probiotics and prebiotics are known as synbiotics.},

   abstract = {In the last years the research on the etiopathogenesis of the inflammatory bowel disease (IBD) is focused around immunological aspects. Many authors consider that the intestinal inflammation is due to an inappropriate immunological response to normally present antigens in the gut. Two aspects must to be considered between IBD: Crohn's disease and ulcerative colitis. IBD's diagnosis is based on the symptomatology, (cramps, liquid feces with mucus and blood, anorexia and weight loss), hemato-clinical tests (ESR, PCR, blood platelet, mucoprotein, sideremia) and radiological tests (tenuis Rx, abdominal echography, fibro endoscophy and scintigraphy). Principal aim of the therapy is the clinical remission. Following the remission starts a maintenance protocol. Parenteral nutrition is used in paediatric and adolescent age. Diets have been used to provide a convenient nutritious contribution with growth improvement and partial remission of activity index of the disease. Pharmacology therapy represents a valid instrument to obtain the remission. Colectomy is performed on unsuccessful medical therapy. Early studies on IBD's pathogenesis bring to the use of biological therapies that show beneficial effects on the disease.},

   abstract = {BACKGROUND: Crohn's disease and ulcerative colitis are chronic inflammatory bowel diseases of unknown etiology. Unspecific immunosuppressive therapy represents current standard treatment and is often associated with severe side effects. Several treatment regimens have been evaluated to identify alternative therapeutic options. Among these different diet therapies were investigated. Objective of this paper is to review the results of diet therapy in chronic inflammatory bowel disease on the basis of randomised controlled trials and meta-analysis of randomised controlled trials. METHODS: Medline and Cochrane Library were searched for meta-analysis and randomised controlled trials investigating this question. Additionally reference lists of identified articles and text books were checked for further trials. RESULTS: Four meta-analyses investigated the treatment of acute Crohn's disease with elemental-, semi-elemental-, and polymeric diets in comparison to corticosteroids or to another form of enteral diet. All meta-analyses show a superiority of corticosteroids and no difference in the effect of the compared enteral diets. Randomised controlled trials investigating diet therapy in ulcerative colitis have not been summarised in a meta-analysis yet. Eleven randomised trials were identified which evaluated diets in ulcerative colitis patients: Dietary supplementation with n-3-fatty acids (6 trials), elemental diet [2], dietary supplementation with dietary fiber [1], elimination diet [1], and dietary supplementation with olestra [1]. Only for the elimination diet a significant positive effect on the course of disease was found in one trial which investigated only 18 patients. CONCLUSIONS: Enteral nutritional therapy of acute Crohn's disease is less effective than treatment with corticosteroids. In case of severe steroid induced side effects diet treatment can present a promising alternative. Superiority of one of the investigated different formulations was not found. Meta-analyses of randomised trials provide a clear and easy to understand presentation of the effect of this intervention. Eleven published trials investigating the effect of diets in ulcerative colitis show only for elimination diet a positive treatment effect. The trials do find a positive effect of one of the other interventions but the trials are very small and cannot exclude a treatment effect. Meta-analysis of these trials would be helpful for a better presentation and understanding of these results.},

   abstract = {Nutritional derangements are frequent in inflammatory bowel disease. In the past year significant work has been published examining the mechanisms of impaired food intake in animal models of inflammatory bowel disease, which allow a better understanding of these processes. Data from the same laboratory have shed further light on the relative role of underfeeding and inflammation on the growth retardation associated with intestinal inflammation. Other studies have provided further data on the risk factors and predictive biomarkers of bone loss in patients with inflammatory bowel disease. The potential role of enteral nutrition as primary therapy for Crohn's disease is particularly addressed in this review. Recent contributions to the field emphasized the special importance of this modality of therapy in paediatric patients. The possible mechanisms for such a therapeutic action are not well understood. Other nutrients may have a therapeutic potential in inflammatory bowel disease. In particular, recent data on the in-vivo anti-inflammatory actions of butyrate merit special mention. Finally, novel nutritional therapeutic strategies for inflammatory bowel disease, such as transforming growth factor-beta2-enriched enteral feeding, or hydrothermally processed cereals have recently been explored.},

Patients with celiac disease can present cerebellar ataxia, progressive myoclonic ataxia, myelopathy, or cerebral, brainstem and peripheral nerve involvement. Antigliadin antibodies can be found in subjects with neurological dysfunction of unknown cause, particularly in sporadic cerebellar ataxia ("gluten ataxia"). Patients with Whipple's disease can develop mental and psychiatric changes, supranuclear gaze palsy, upper motoneuron signs, hypothalamic dysfunction, cranial nerve abnormalities, seizures, ataxia, myorhythmia and sensory deficits. Neurological manifestations can complicate inflammatory bowel disease (e.g. ulcerative colitis and Crohn's disease) due to vascular or vasculitic mechanisms. Cases with both Crohn's disease and MS or cerebral vasculitis are described. Epilepsy, chronic inflammatory polyneuropathy, muscle involvement and myasthenia gravis are also reported. The central nervous system can be affected in patients with hepatitis C virus (HCV) infection because of vasculitis associated with HCV-related cryoglobulinemia. Mitochondrial neurogastrointestinal encephalopathy (MNGIE) is a disease caused by multiple deletions of mitochondrial DNA. It is characterized by peripheral neuropathy, ophthalmoplegia, deafness, leukoencephalopathy, and gastrointestinal symptoms due to visceral neuropathy. Neurological manifestations can be the consequence of vitamin B1, nicotinamide, vitamin B12, vitamin D, or vitamin E deficiency and from nutritional deficiency states following gastric surgery.},

   abstract = {Ulcerative colitis is a chronic relapsing inflammatory disorder of the colonic mucosa of unknown etiology. The inflammatory process involves the mucosa and submucosa in a continuous segment of bowel with rectal involvement in almost all cases. Since its etiology is unknown, therapy is directed at modulating the inflammatory response in order to control symptoms and to prevent relapses. 5-aminosalicylates and corticosteroids have been the most widely used therapeutic agents for treatment of ulcerative colitis. Recently, experience has been gained with the use of other immunomodulators, such as mercaptopurine, azathioprine, methotrexate, cyclosporine, and tacrolimus, in pediatric patients. Colectomy is indicated in patients with severe colitis who do not respond to intensive medical therapy. The care of children with ulcerative colitis not only involves control of symptoms from gastrointestinal and extraintestinal manifestations, but also optimizing growth and development. The complications of chronic inflammation and long-term medical therapy must be weighed against the risks and benefits of surgery for children and adolescents with this condition.},

In contrast, nutrition plays no major role in the development of the disease or in provoking an acute attack. During an acute attack of Crohn's disease, the application of oral (drinks) or tube feeding (enteral nutrition) can result in a substantial clinical improvement. The remission rate of this side effect-free therapy is, however, lower than that seen with steroids. The data available for diet therapy in ulcerative colitis are less unequivocal, but the effects are probably slight at best. During the remission phase, the patient should eat a balanced, vitamin-rich and varied normal diet that excludes all poorly tolerated foods: lactose intolerance in particular appears to be increased in patients with Crohn's disease. Known vitamin or mineral deficiencies should be corrected by appropriate dietary measures or supplementation. There is no such thing as a "Crohn's diet" or "colitis diet". The patient can be allowed to eat anything that is tolerated.},

   abstract = {BACKGROUND AND AIMS: Restorative proctocolectomy with construction of an ileoanal pouch (IPAA) is the surgical treatment of choice for patients with ulcerative colitis (UC) or familial adenomatous polyposis (FAP). This procedure imposes an essential change in function on the terminal ileal mucosa and pouch mucosa. Glutamine is one of the major nutrients for the small-bowel mucosa; it is metabolized into glutamate and subsequently alanine in the human enterocyte. In a prospective clinical trial we compared glutamine distribution in patients with UC to that in patients with FAP before and after restorative proctocolectomy. METHODS AND PATIENTS: Concentrations of glutamine, glutamate, and alanine were measured pre- and postoperatively in the terminal ileal mucosa, pouch mucosa, skeletal muscle and venous blood of patients undergoing IPAA for UC or FAP. Healthy individuals served as controls for skeletal muscle glutamine concentration. RESULTS: After IPAA the glutamine concentration in UC patients was decreased in skeletal muscle. In the mucosa glutamine remained unaltered while glutamate and alanine concentrations increased. In plasma the glutamine concentration increased, the glutamate level fell, and the alanine level increased. In FAP patients the glutamine level was unchanged in skeletal muscle after IPAA. In mucosa the glutamine level did not change, but glutamate and alanine increased. In plasma the glutamine level remained unaltered, glutamate decreased, and alanine increased. CONCLUSION: Patients with UC or FAP before surgical therapy do not suffer from glutamine depletion. IPAA resulted in changes in the distribution of glutamine and its metabolites in skeletal muscle, plasma, and ileal pouch mucosa, particularly in patients with UC. Further studies should investigate whether characteristics in the glutamine distribution have any impact for the long-term outcome after IPAA.},

   abstract = {OBJECTIVE: Previous reports suggest an association between inflammatory bowel disease (IBD) and immune thrombocytopenic purpura (ITP) in adults. To date, only five children with both diseases have been described. The aim of the study was to describe the characteristics of children with IBD and ITP. METHODS: Cases were obtained from the pediatric gastroenterology community by means of the pediatric gastroenterology internet bulletin board in June 1999. Eight cases were submitted from seven medical centers. Medical records were reviewed by two pediatric gastroenterologists and a pediatric hematologist. RESULTS: The age range of the patients was 2.1 to 16.5 years, with a mean age of 9.6 +/- 5.2 years. Four children had ulcerative colitis, three had Crohn disease, and one had indeterminate colitis. All had colonic involvement of IBD. Of eight patients, three had IBD first, three had ITP first, and two had both simultaneously. At ITP diagnosis, platelet count was less than 10,000/mL in five children, 17,000/mL in one child, and 50,000 to 60,000/mL in two children. Of the three children diagnosed with ITP first, two initially had rectal bleeding at the time of ITP diagnosis. Bone marrow evaluations, performed in six of eight children, were consistent with ITP. Six of the eight children had chronic ITP, including three children who were 5 years of age or younger. Therapy for ITP included steroids (n = 6), intravenous immunoglobulin (n = 6), Rh o (D) intravenous immunoglobulin (n = 2), and splenectomy (n = 1). CONCLUSIONS: The authors describe the largest pediatric case series of children with IBD and ITP. More than 50% of the children had the chronic form of ITP. Most patients responded to conventional therapy for ITP and IBD.},

   abstract = {The primary function of the gastrointestinal system is to assist the intake and further processing of food and liquids. Besides that, it forms an anatomical barrier between the external environment and internal milieu. It is also highly important for its paracrine and endocrine function. Inflammatory bowel diseases, which frequently cause a gastrointestinal failure, form a specific group. Most frequently it is the ulcerative colitis and Crohn's disease. Impaired integrity of the gastrointestinal mucosa and failure of protective mechanisms lead to the increased permeability of the intestinal wall for antigens derived from food, saprophytic bacteria and pathogenic microorganisms. When the gastrointestinal failure is threatening, factors determining its residual function become more important. As decisive reveals the severity and location of the primary disease. Previous surgeries and adaptation of the residual part of the gastrointestinal system are important, as well as the possibility of peroral or enteral nutrient intake. Depending on the presence of risk factors and the degree of residual gut function, some complications can be expected: dehydration, mineral disorders, symptoms of protein and energy depletion, infection, and multiple organ dysfunction syndrome. It is highly important to decide whether the gastrointestinal system will be included into or excluded from the process of realimentation. Critically ill patients with inflammatory bowel diseases should be treated at an intensive care unit.},

Chromoendoscopy has been informed as a method to improve evaluation of extension of UC. No reports on this issue have been published in Mexico to date. OBJECTIVE: To investigate usefulness of chromoendoscopy in determination of extension and severity of UC, as well as inter-observer variability. PATIENTS AND METHODS: Twenty five patients with diagnosis of UC were selected from March 2001 to January 2002 to enter this prospective study. Baron scale was used to evaluate UC endoscopic severity and was followed by randomization of patients to receive methylene blue 0.2% (14 cases) or indigo carmine 0.1% (11 cases) for chromoendoscopic assessment. Each case was presented for evaluation to five endoscopists with > 5 years experience in colonoscopy. Histopathologic report was considered gold standard. STATISTICAL ANALYSIS: Weighed Kappa coefficient for endoscopic-pathologic agreement among evaluators was used. RESULTS AND DISCUSSION: There was fair agreement among endoscopic and pathologic diagnoses of each observer with the two tinctures, particularly when using indigo carmine. Chromoendoscopy increased detection of areas affected by UC with minimal or silent activity. CONCLUSIONS: Chromoendoscopy with indigo carmine or methylene blue may increase endoscopic-pathologic agreement for assessment of severity of UC, thus being a helpful complementary technique in these patients.},

   abstract = {Cytosine guanine dinucleotide (CpG) island methylation is a known mechanism of epigenetic inheritance in postmeiotic cells. Through associated chromatin changes and silencing, such epigenetic states can influence cellular physiology and affect disease risk and severity. Our studies of CpG island methylation in normal colorectal mucosa revealed progressive age-related increases at multiple gene loci, suggesting genome-wide molecular alterations with potential to silence gene expression. However, there was considerable variation in the degree of methylation among individuals of comparable ages. Such variation could be related to genetic factors, lifestyle, or environmental exposures. Studies in ulcerative colitis and hepatocellular cirrhosis and neoplasia revealed that chronic inflammatory states are accompanied by marked increases in CpG island methylation in normal-appearing tissues, confirming the hypothesis that proinflammatory exposures could account for part of the epigenetic variation in human populations. Preliminary data also suggest potential influences of lifestyle and exposure factors on CpG island methylation. It is suggested that epigenetic variation related to aging, lifestyle, exposures and possibly genetic factors, is one of the modulators of acquired, age-related human diseases, including neoplasia.},

   abstract = {BACKGROUND: Patients with inflammatory bowel disease (IBD) have an increased incidence of thromboembolic events. This risk may be caused by an increased frequency of thrombophilic mutations such as factor V Leiden G1691A (FVL), prothrombin G20210A (PT), or methylene tetrahydrofolate reductase C667T (MTHFR). Prevalence rates of heterozygous mutations in FVL, PT, and MTHFR are reported for whites (1.8%, 1.3%, 26.6%, respectively), blacks (0.8%, 0.3%, and 12.4%, respectively), and Hispanics (1.2%, 2.4%, and 41.5%, respectively). We sought to determine the prevalence of these thrombophilic mutations in a large cohort of children with IBD. METHODS: Children aged 21 years or younger with IBD were genotyped for FVL, PT, and MTHFR mutations by polymerase chain reaction amplification and restriction enzyme digestion. Prevalence rates were compared with established rates in the respective populations. RESULTS: Of 92 patients enrolled, 89 (62 with Crohn disease, 24 with ulcerative colitis, and 3 with indeterminate colitis) had genotype results available. The mean age was 13.3 +/- 4.2 years (range, 2-21 years). Statistical analysis was performed on 89 FVL, PT, and MTHFR allele pairs. Polymerase chain reaction genotyping identified 5 patients with heterozygous FVL mutations, 3 patients heterozygous for the PT mutation, and 36 patients heterozygous and 4 patients homozygous for the MTHFR mutation. The thrombophilic allele mutation frequencies in our sample were not significantly different from predicted weighted average values: FVL, 2.8% versus 1.5%; PT, 1.7% versus 1.1%; and MTHFR, 24.7% versus 24.4%. In 24 patients with a family history of thrombosis, 1 was heterozygous for FVL and for MTHFR, 1 was heterozygous for FVL and homozygous for MTHFR, 2 were heterozygous for PT, and 9 were heterozygous MTHFR. There was no significant correlation between family history of thrombosis and presence of a thrombophilic mutation. The four patients with homozygous mutations for MTHFR, two of whom also were heterozygous for FVL, did not have either a personal history of thrombosis or a family history of thrombotic events. Two patients had thrombotic events without mutations in these genotypes: one had protein S deficiency and the other had no identifiable cause. CONCLUSIONS: The presence of genetic mutations that predispose to hypercoagulable states does not appear to correlate with the prevalence of IBD or to thromboembolic events in patients with IBD. There was no statistical difference between the proportions of the mutated allele frequency in our study patients and the general population.},

   abstract = {Germinated barley foodstuff (GBF) contains insoluble protein and dietary fiber, and has the potential to attenuate diarrhea and colonic mucosal damage in colitis. Since GBF contains a poorly digested protein fraction, this protein may be transferred to and absorbed in the colon. It may therefore be possible to detect the GBF antigen in colitis patients with dysfunctional colonic mucosal barrier defense. In this study, the antigenic potency of GBF was examined in vivo and in vitro. Using the AOAC method, the indigestible fraction of GBF (dietary fiber) was obtained, and the poorly digested protein fraction in GBF was determined. Using Sprague Dawley rats with chronic colitis induced by dextran sulfate sodium (DSS, 2.5% in diet), a GBF and control diet were administered, and total and specific serum immunoglobulin E (IgE) against intestinal contents and the soluble GBF protein were determined. In addition, reactivity between serum and intestinal content were examined by gel electrophoresis mobility shift assay (EMSA). GBF showed relatively low protein digestibility (47%) because of its low solubility in neutral pH. Total serum IgE in both dietary groups was not significantly different, and specific IgE antibodies against intestinal contents and the soluble GBF protein were not significantly different. In addition, supershifts were not observed in either dietary group by EMSA. The possible antigenicity of oral GBF was considered to be low in this colitis model.},

   abstract = {BACKGROUND: Germinated barley foodstuff (GBF) is a prebiotic foodstuff that effectively increases luminal butyrate production by stimulating the growth of protective bacteria. In the first pilot study, GBF has been shown to reduce both clinical activity and mucosal inflammation in ulcerative colitis (UC). The aim of this study was to investigate the efficacy of GBF in the treatment of UC in a multicenter open control trial. METHODS: Eighteen patients with mildly to moderately active UC were divided into two groups using a random allocation protocol. The control group (n = 7) were given a baseline anti-inflammatory therapy for 4 weeks. In the GBF-treated group (n = 11), patients received 20-30 g GBF daily, together with the baseline treatment, for 4 weeks. The response to the treatments was evaluated clinically and endoscopically. Fecal microflora were also analyzed. RESULTS: After 4 weeks of observation, the GBF-treated group showed a significant decrease in clinical activity index scores compared with the control group (P < 0.05). No side effects related to GBF were observed. GBF therapy increased fecal concentrations of Bifidobacterium and Eubacterium limosum. CONCLUSIONS: Oral GBF therapy may have the potency to reduce clinical activity of UC. We believe that these results support the use of GBF administration as a new adjunct therapy for UC.},

   abstract = {INTRODUCTION: Serology is reported to be helpful in evaluating children for inflammatory bowel disease (IBD), and distinguishing chronic ulcerative colitis (CUC) from Crohn's disease (CD). The markers include perinuclear staining antineutrophil cytoplasmic antibody (pANCA) for CUC and anti-Saccharomyces cerevisiae antibody (ASCA) for CD. In the clinical setting, hemoglobin (Hgb) and erythrocyte sedimentation rate (ESR) are commonly performed for screening symptomatic children for IBD. We examined whether there was an additional benefit of serology in addition to specific symptoms and routine laboratory tests in screening for IBD. METHOD: Medical record data was reviewed on children investigated for IBD from February 1999 to April 2001. Children were included if they had blood analyzed for pANCA and ASCA, Hgb, ESR, and colonoscopy as part of their assessment. RESULTS: Of 177 cases reviewed, 51 were diagnosed with CUC, 39 with CD, and 26 other inflammatory conditions. Visible rectal bleeding was the most discriminating symptom (occurred in 60/90 cases of IBD and 5/61 without IBD). There was a significant difference between the proportion with CUC positive for pANCA (42/51) and those with abnormal Hgb and ESR (30/51) (p < 0.05), but not between children with CD who were ASCA positive (18/39) and those with abnormal Hgb and ESR (26/39) (p = 0.27). The sensitivity and specificity of combined pANCA and ASCA was 68% and 92%, respectively. For the combination of Hgb, ESR, and the presence of rectal bleeding the respective values were 86% and 67%. Serology combined with Hgb and ESR and rectal bleeding as independent factors significantly (p < 0.05) improved sensitivity (89%) but reduced specificity (60%). Screening with the combination of rectal bleeding, Hgb, and ESR identified 86% (77/90) patients with IBD prior to an endoscopic procedure. A further 3 of 90 (3.3%) screened positive with the addition of serology. CONCLUSION: Serology tests have a high degree of specificity for IBD while routine laboratory test have a higher sensitivity. When serology is combined with rectal bleeding, Hgb, and ESR, the sensitivity of screening children for IBD is significantly improved. However the large majority of children with IBD can be identified with a clinical history and routine laboratory tests as needing an endoscopic procedure with little benefit of adding serology.},

   abstract = {Dietary incorporation of fermentable, indigestible fructans may be of benefit to gastrointestinal health by providing short-chain fatty acids, stimulating the proliferation of bifidobacteria or lactobacilli and suppressing potential pathogenic organisms in the gut. We tested the hypothesis that the effects of fructans on caecal, colonic and faecal short-chain fatty acid concentration and microflora composition depend on their chain length. Germ-free rats associated with a human faecal flora were randomly assigned to one of four treatments as follows: (1) commercial standard diet as a control (Con); (2) Con+50 g short-chain oligofructose/kg (OF); (3) C+50 g long-chain inulin/kg (lcIN); or (4) Con+50 g OF-lcIN/kg (Mix OF-lcIN). Changes in bacterial population groups in response to feeding these diets were investigated with 16S rRNA-targeted probes applied in in situ hybridization. Mix OF-lcIN- and lcIN-containing diets resulted in larger numbers of caecal, colonic and faecal bacteria of the Clostridium coccoides-Eubacterium rectale cluster than Con (10.6 and 10.3 v. 9.5 log10/g wet wt), whereas OF alone did not affect this bacterial group in caecum, colon or faeces. A bifidogenic effect was only observed in the colon and faeces of OF-treated rats. More lactobacilli were found in caecal and colonic contents of Mix OF-lcIN-fed rats and in faeces of OF-fed rats compared with Con. Mix OF-lcIN and OF led to significantly smaller numbers of caecal, colonic and faecal bacteria belonging to the Clostridium histolyticum and C. lituseburense groups than Con (6.8 and 6.9 v. 7.9 log10/g wet wt). Counts of total bacteria, Bacteroides-Prevotella and Enterobacteriaceae did not differ between the groups. OF and/or lcIN-containing diets significantly increased the caecal and colonic concentration of butyrate and its relative molar proportion. Only lcIN-containing diets resulted in a higher faecal concentration of butyrate than Con. Higher molar proportions of faecal butyrate were observed with all diets that had been supplemented with OF and/or lcIN. Stimulation of butyrate production could be of interest for the prevention of ulcerative colitis and colon cancer.},

The aim of this study was to investigate IBD tissues for different bacterial population groups harbouring the mucosal surface and/or invading the mucosa. METHODS: Tissue sections from surgical resections from the terminal ileum and/or the colon from 24 IBD patients (12 active ulcerative colitis (UC), 12 active Crohn disease (CD)) and 14 non-IBD controls were studied by fluorescent in situ hybridization on a quantifiable basis. RESULTS: More bacteria were detected on the mucosal surface of IBD patients than on those of non-IBD controls (P < 0.05). Bacterial invasion of the mucosa was evident in 83.3% of colonic specimens from the UC patients, in 55.6% of the ileal and in 25% of the colonic specimens from the CD patients, but no bacteria were detected in the tissues of the controls. Colonic UC specimens were colonized by a variety of organisms, such as bacteria belonging to the gamma subdivision of Proteobacteria, the Enterobacteriaceae, the Bacteroides/Prevotella cluster, the Clostridium histolyticum/Clostridium lituseburense group, the Clostridium coccoides/Eubacterium rectale group, high G + C Gram-positive bacteria, or sulphate-reducing bacteria, while CD samples harboured mainly bacteria belonging to the former three groups. CONCLUSION: Pathogenic events in CD and UC may be associated with different alterations in the mucosal flora of the ileum and colon.},

   abstract = {UNLABELLED: Pancreatitis in inflammatory bowel disease (IBD) in children is anecdotal. In adults, symptomatic pancreatitis occurs in 2% and asymptomatic in 8 to 21%. PATIENTS AND METHODS: The aim of our study was to review retrospectively the frequency of pancreatitis in 124 pediatric patients (54.8% boys, 45.2% girls; 97 with Crohn disease, 16 with ulcerative colitis and 11 with undetermined colitis). Diagnostic criterion of pancreatitis was an increase of amylasemia > or = +2 SD of the normal with or without evocative clinical symptoms. RESULTS: Symptomatic or asymptomatic pancreatitis was found in 27% (respectively 14.5 and 12.5%). Pancreatitis was significantly more frequent in girls as compared to boys (P = 0.04). Symptomatic pancreatitis was moderate and non complicated, often recurrent. It occurred mainly during active and severe diseases (P = 0.006). The localizations of IBD were not discriminant. Strong relation with drug was found in 25% of pancreatitis mainly due to azathioprine or 5-aminosalicylic acid, and salazopyrin. Duodenal localisation of Crohn disease or hepatobiliary complications were found associated with pancreatitis in 18% and 15% respectively. CONCLUSION: These data suggest the high incidence of symptomatic and asymptomatic pancreatitis in children with IBD, the importance of its regular monitoring but also its multifactorial causes. Precise diagnosis of pancreatitis in pediatric IBD has to be done in order to avoid inappropriate drug pancreatitis diagnosis.},

   abstract = {The pathogenesis of inflammatory bowel disease (IBD) remains unknown, although in recent years more data have become available. The contribution of genetic and environmental factors is evident, and the luminal bacterial flora plays a major role in the initiation and perpetuation of chronic IBD. Animal models of IBD have shown that colitis does not occur in a germ-free environment. In human IBD, inflammation is present in parts of the gut containing the highest bacterial concentrations. Moreover, the terminal ileum, caecum and rectum are areas of relative stasis, providing prolonged mucosal contact with luminal contents. Enhanced mucosal permeability may play a pivotal role in maintaining a chronic inflammatory state, due to a genetic predisposition or as a result of direct contact with bacteria or their products. A detective epithelial barrier may cause a loss of tolerance to the normal enteric flora. Furthermore, an increased mucosal absorption of viable bacteria and bacterial products is found in IBD. Serum and secreted antibodies are increased and mucosal T-lymphocytes that recognize luminal bacteria are present. However, there is evidence that the immune system reacts over aggressively towards the normal luminal flora rather than the flora being altered in IBD. Several approaches have been used in attempts to discover a specific microbial agent in the cause of IBD. These include demonstration of the presence of organisms or specific antigens in affected tissues, culture of microbes firm the affected tissues, demonstration of serological responses to several agents, and localization and detection of individual pathogen-specific nucleic acid sequences in affected tissue by in situ hybridization and polymerase chain reaction. So far, no specific micro-organism has been directly associated with the pathogenesis of IBD. Analysis of the luminal enteric flora, however, has revealed differences in the composition of this flora compared to healthy controls. In Crohn disease, concentrations of Bacteroides, Eubacteria and Peptostreptococcus are increased, whereas Bifidobacteria numbers are significantly reduced. Furthermore, in ulcerative colitis, concentrations of facultative anaerobic bacteria are increased. The arrival of new molecular techniques qualifying and quantifying the complex intestinal flora has induced a revival of interest in this microflora. Therapeutic approaches geared towards changing the environment at the mucosal border have been attempted by the use of elemental diets, total parenteral nutrition, surgical diversion of the faecal stream and antibiotics. Over the past few years, the use of probiotics in IBD and other intestinal disorders has gained attention. Strengthened by promising experimental data and commercial interests, research in this field is rapidly expanding. Manipulation of the colonic bacteria with antibiotic drugs and probiotic agents may prove to be more effective and better tolerated than immunosuppressants in the future.},

   abstract = {BACKGROUND: Luminal nitric oxide increases in ulcerative colitis and Crohn disease. The authors have previously used a minimally invasive method to demonstrate increased luminal nitric oxide in ulcerative colitis and Crohn disease of the colon. The aim of the current study was to determine whether this method could be applied to identify inflammatory activity in ulcerative colitis and Crohn disease in children. METHODS: Thirty-six children (18 of whom had active disease) with inflammatory bowel disease localized to the colon were studied. The control group comprised 12 healthy children. To measure nitric oxide, a silicon catheter with an inflatable balloon was inserted into the rectum and inflated with 10 mL of nitric oxide-free air. After a 10-minute incubation time, the air was withdrawn and nitric oxide concentrations were immediately analyzed using a chemiluminescence technique. RESULTS: Children with active ulcerative colitis and Crohn disease of the colon had greatly increased luminal nitric oxide concentrations in the rectum (8,840 +/- 5,120 and 15,170 +/- 4,757 parts per billion [ppb], respectively) compared with controls (77 +/- 17 ppb) (P < 0.001). Children with nonactive ulcerative colitis or Crohn disease displayed low concentrations of rectal nitric oxide (356 +/- 110 and 188 +/- 55 ppb, respectively), which was not different from that of healthy controls. CONCLUSION: Rectal nitric oxide measurement is a feasible and useful method for monitoring disease activity in inflammatory bowel disease, especially in children.},

There are only two reports published describing its use in UC. The authors describe their experience with open-label use of infliximab in children with moderate to severe UC. METHODS: The authors collected data on all consecutive pediatric patients with UC who received infliximab at The Children's Hospital of Philadelphia until July 2001. The primary measured outcome was clinical response at 2 days and 2 weeks after infliximab infusion, as measured by the Lichtiger colitis activity index (LCAI) score and the Physician Global Assessment (PGA). Tolerance of the infusions and adverse events were recorded. RESULTS: Nine patients qualified for clinical response analysis. The median Lichtiger colitis activity index score decreased from 11 before the infusion to 1 at 2 days and 2 weeks after the infusion, respectively (P = 0.01 for 2 days and 2 weeks). Seven of nine (77%) patients had decreased activity of their disease measured by the Physician Global Assessment. Corticosteroid therapy was discontinued in six (66%) patients. An infusion reaction developed (generalized pruritus and facial flushing) in two patients and an elevated anti-nuclear antibody (ANA) titer of 1:1280 developed in one patient. CONCLUSION: Infliximab is associated with short-term clinical improvement in children and adolescents with moderate to severe UC.},

Parenteral iron therapy is rarely prescribed because of concern about potential side effects. The aim of this study was to retrospectively evaluate the safety and efficacy of total dose intravenous (TDI) iron therapy. METHODS: Charts of all the pediatric patients with IBD who received TDI iron therapy between February of 1994 and February of 2000 were reviewed. RESULTS: Seventy patients (20 with ulcerative colitis and 50 with Crohn disease) received a total of 119 TDI iron dextran infusions. Thirty-four patients qualified for the efficacy analysis. The average increase in hemoglobin concentration was 2.9 g/dL, (P < 0.0001). Eleven immediate hypersensitivity reactions developed in 10 patients (9% of the total number of infusions). None of the reactions was life threatening and none required hospitalization. CONCLUSIONS: Total dose intravenous infusion of iron dextran, when appropriately used, is a safe and potentially efficacious treatment for children with inflammatory bowel disease and iron deficiency anemia who are unresponsive to or noncompliant with oral iron therapy.},

   abstract = {OBJECTIVES: Clinicians are becoming increasingly aware that inflammatory bowel disease (IBD) can affect all age groups, although it has not been well described in infants and young children. Our aim was to evaluate early onset IBD in patients 5 yr of age and younger. METHODS: Medical records of patients diagnosed with early onset IBD at The Children's Hospital of Philadelphia between 1977 and 2000 were reviewed. Patients were divided into three categories: those with Crohn's disease (CD), those with ulcerative colitis (UC), and those with indeterminant colitis (IC). RESULTS: A total of 82 patients fulfilled the criteria. In 12 patients (15%), the IBD diagnosis was changed during the course of illness. At the end of the follow-up period, linear growth failure was present in 10 of 35 (29%) children with CD, one of 30 (3%) with UC, and three of 17 (18%) with IC. Failure to thrive was a frequent presenting symptom in children with CD (44%) and IC (39%), whereas in all four patients with UC and failure to thrive the diagnosis was subsequently changed to CD or IC. A high proportion of patients with CD had large bowel (89%), and perianal (34%) disease. None of the tested patients were positive for anti-Saccharomyces cerevisiae antibody (ASCA), and 10 tested positive for perinuclear antineutrophil cytoplasmic antibody (three of five patients with CD, five of seven with UC, and two of three with IC). CONCLUSIONS: Failure to thrive, at the time of presentation, is indicative of a final diagnosis of CD or IC, not UC. Linear growth failure is a common finding in patients with early onset CD. A high proportion of patients with CD have failure to thrive, colonic, and perianal disease. The IBD serology panel is of limited clinical relevance in providing definitive diagnostic information in this pediatric population.},

This study aims at assessing the therapeutic role of ciprofloxacin as an adjunct to corticosteroids in acute severe ulcerative colitis. METHODS: In this prospective, randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled trial, 55 consecutive patients fulfilling the criteria of Truelove and Witts for severe ulcerative colitis were randomized on admission to the hospital to receive intravenously ciprofloxacin (400 mg b.i.d.) (n = 29) or placebo (n = 27). All patients received parenteral nutrition, intravenous hydrocortisone (100 mg q.i.d.) and hydrocortisone enemas (100 mg b.i.d.). Patients were assessed after 10 days of continuous treatment, or at any time a severe complication occurred. RESULTS: At study entry, there were no significant differences between treatment groups in any patient or disease-related parameter. Twenty-three of 29 patients (79.3%) treated with ciprofloxacin and 20 of 26 patients (77%) treated with placebo showed substantial improvement and were given oral steroids (P > 0.1). Six patients in each group did not improve (n = 10) or developed complications (n = 2). Nine of these 12 patients underwent emergency colectomy; three patients consented to receive intravenous cyclosporin but did not achieve remission of colitis and they underwent elective colectomy. There were no perioperative or late deaths. CONCLUSIONS: A short course of intravenous ciprofloxacin does not seem to augment the effect of corticosteroids for patients with acute, severe ulcerative colitis.},

METHODS: Surveys were mailed to 718 physicians in January, 2000. All surveys returned by mid-February were analyzed, and results compared to those obtained in the 1990 survey. RESULTS: Thirty-nine percent (278/718) of surveys were returned, compared to 27% (105/385) in 1990. Overall, 93% of the current survey's respondents agreed with the statement "immunomodulatory agents are effective in the treatment of children and adolescents with IBD." Compared to 1990, significant increases (p < 0.0001) were noted in the percentage of respondents who prescribe immunomodulatory agents to children with all forms of IBD. Indications for immunomodulation that showed significant increases (p < 0.001) since 1990 included treatment of perianal and non-perianal fistulae; growth failure; use as initial, primary therapy; and use as prophylaxis against postoperative recurrence. 6-Mercaptopurine and azathioprine continue to be the agents prescribed by the greatest percentage of respondents. More physicians are willing to use immunomodulatory agents in children younger than 5 yr, and duration of use is longer than in 1990. Currently, physicians seem to favor the use of immunomodulatory agents over colectomy for children with either intractable ulcerative or Crohn's colitis. Most respondents remain concerned about potential bone marrow and immune suppression, but concerns regarding malignancy, teratogenicity, and infertility have lessened. CONCLUSION: These survey findings document that pediatric gastroenterologists have widely accepted the use of immunomodulators in the treatment of children and adolescents with IBD.},

Alteration of bacterial flora, low antigenicity, low fat content and improvement of nutritional status are postulated to play a role in the anti-inflammatory effect of elemental diet. AIM: To determine whether elemental diet or its modifications has a direct anti-inflammatory effect on colonic tissue biopsies in vitro. PATIENTS AND METHODS: Colonic or ileal biopsies from 39 patients with inflammatory bowel disease and control patients were incubated for 24 hours with enteral diets in which nitrogen sources were amino acids as in elemental diet, casein or whey. Tissues were incubated with elemental diet, casein or whey, at dilutions of 1:5, 1:10 or 1:20 in Waymouth's complete medium; a medium control was also included. Tissue viability was assessed by bromodeoxyuridine uptake. Interleukin-1beta, interleukin-1 receptor antagonist and interleukin-10 concentrations in supernatants were measured by immunoassay (enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay). RESULTS: Incubation of tissues from Crohn's disease with elemental diet resulted in an increase in the ratio of interleukin-1 receptor antagonist/interleukin-1beta vs control statistically significant at 1:10 (89.6+/-17 vs 45.7+/-9. 1, p<0.05). Incubation of Crohn's tissue with casein resulted in a significant increase of interleukin-1 receptor antagonist/interleukin-1beta ratio at dilutions 1:20, 1:10 and 1:5 (101.8+/-22.0, p=0.05, 142.8+/-24.6, p<0.05; 109.7+/-25.0, p=0.05). In ulcerative colitis tissue and non-inflamed non-inflammatory bowel disease control tissue, no significant increase in interleukin 1 receptor antagonist/interleukin-1beta ratio was seen after incubation with elemental diet, casein and whey. CONCLUSION: Elemental diet incubation increases anti-inflammatory:proinflammatory cytokine ratio in Crohn's disease and this anti-inflammatory effect is not specifically due to amino acid composition, as diets containing casein have similar anti-inflammatory effects.},

   abstract = {Despite the prevalence of chronic inflammatory diseases in developed countries, few studies have considered the metabolic alterations observed in these disorders. To determine which perturbations in protein metabolism occur during chronic inflammation, and the consequences they have on nutritional requirements, a model of ulcerative colitis was adapted for use in adult rats. Adult Sprague-Dawley male rats (9 mo old) received dextran sulfate sodium (DSS) in their drinking water at 50 g/L for 9 d, then at 20 g/L for 18 d. A group of control rats, matched for age and weight, was pair-fed to the treated rats. DSS induced body weight loss and chronic inflammation characterized by an increase of spleen, liver, ileum and colon weights, of blood leukocytes and acute-phase protein levels. The main inflammatory site was the colon, which presented characteristic histological alterations and increased myeloperoxydase activity. Inflammation was accompanied by oxidative stress, characterized by increased plasma protein carbonyl content and increased liver glutathione concentration, but decreased glutathione concentration in muscle. This DSS-induced colitis led to a stimulation of protein synthesis in spleen (+223%), ileum (+40%) and colon (+63%). By contrast, protein synthesis in muscle slowed down (-23%). In conclusion, like acute inflammation, chronic inflammation induced a stimulation of protein metabolism in several splanchnic organs. In muscle, both protein synthesis and degradation were reduced. Taken together, these data are consistent with inadequate amino acid supply to meet the increased requirement resulting from chronic inflammation.},

Rats were treated with 80 mg/kg body of 2,4,6-trinitrobenzenesulfonic acid and fed for 1 or 2 wk diets enriched in olive oil (OO), fish oil (FO), or purified pig brain phospholipids (BPL), as sources of monounsaturated and PUFA of the (n-3) and (n-3) + (n-6) series. Evaluation of macroscopic and microscopic colonic damage was assessed. Ultrastructural and histologic changes were analyzed as well as plasma and colonic mucosa fatty acid profiles and some biochemical markers of injury and inflammation [alkaline phosphatase (AP), mieloperoxidase (MPO), prostaglandin E(2) (PGE(2)) and leukotriene B(4)]. Fatty acid profiles of both plasma and mucosa mostly reflected the dietary fatty acid composition. Plasma MUFA proportions were higher in UC animals fed the OO diet compared with FO or BPL groups 1 and 2 wk and (n-3) long chain PUFA (LC-PUFA) were higher in the FO than in the OO and BPL groups. At 1 wk, UC led to lower MUFA mucosa levels and (n-3)LC-PUFA were higher in the FO group compared with the OO and BPL groups. Rats with UC fed FO at 1 wk showed significantly less macroscopic and microscopic colonic damage. They also have lower AP and MPO activities and PGE(2) levels compared with the OO and BPL groups and showed enhanced histological repair, less necrotic areas within the mucosa, and more goblet cells with mature mucin granules. These results suggest that the use of balanced diets containing (n-3) LC-PUFA could ameliorate the inflammation and mucosal damage in UC.},

Careful nutritional monitoring and appropriate nutritional intervention throughout all stages of disease should be an integral part of the multidisciplinary management approach to IBD. In terms of primary therapy, polymeric and elemental enteral diets are an effective therapy for patients with acute Crohn's disease, offering an unrivaled safety profile and significant nutritional benefits. Enteral diets should be considered as primary therapy in children with Crohn's disease, especially in those with poor nutritional status or growth impairment, and in patients with severe drug-induced side effects. Total parenteral nutrition (TPN) does not have a primary therapeutic role in patients with IBD.},

   abstract = {UNLABELLED: BACKGROUND AND AIMS IMPACT: is a disease-specific health-related quality-of-life questionnaire developed for use in pediatric inflammatory bowel disease through a process of patient interviews and analysis of patient responses to an item-reduction questionnaire. This study sought to assess the feasibility, reliability, and validity of the instrument. METHODS: The readability statistics and number of unanswered questions were assessed among 147 patients (97 CD, 50 UC) with mean age 14.4 +/- 2.2 years (range 9.2-18.0 years) using the self-administered questionnaire. Internal consistency was assessed with Cronbach's alpha and test-retest reliability using intraclass correlation coefficient (ICC). Construct validity was based on a priori hypotheses. Mean total scores were compared by ANOVA among patients grouped according to disease activity and disease severity within the past year. RESULTS: The readability statistic showed a Flesch-Kincaid Grade level of 4.5. Only 0.68% of questions were left blank. Reliability was excellent with Cronbach's alpha = 0.96, and an ICC of 0.90 in patients with stable disease over a two-week period (n = 32). The mean total IMPACT score for patients with quiescent disease (180 +/- 32) was significantly higher (better QOL) than for those with active disease (146 +/- 31 for mild, 133 +/- 34 for moderate/severe) (P < 0.005). CONCLUSIONS: The IMPACT questionnaire is a valid and reliable reflection of health-related quality of life of older children and adolescents with both ulcerative colitis and Crohn's disease.},

   abstract = {OBJECTIVE: Lactase deficiency is commonly found in adults with inflammatory bowel disease (IBD). Our aim was to determine its prevalence in children with IBD. METHODS: We conducted a retrospective and descriptive analysis of patients with symptomatic IBD whose mucosal lactase activity was measured on duodenal biopsies obtained during gastrointestinal endoscopic evaluations. Age- and gender-matched controls were chosen randomly from a group with chronic abdominal pain. RESULTS: One hundred twelve patients with IBD were identified from January 1994 to December 2000. Seventy-nine (71%) had Crohn disease, and 33 (29%) had ulcerative colitis. Forty-five (40%) of all IBD patients (29 with Crohn disease and 16 with ulcerative colitis) had low lactase activity levels (< 15 microM/min/gm). The prevalence of lactase deficiency in patients with IBD was 37% (38 of 103) in white patients and 78% (7 of 9) in blacks. Thirty-four of 112 controls (30%) had lactase deficiency. IBD patients were more likely to be lactase deficient than the controls, but the difference was not statistically significant ( = 0.162). Normal duodenal histology was found in 67% of lactase-deficient IBD patients compared with 82% in lactase-sufficient IBD patients. The frequency of duodenal inflammation did not differ significantly between lactase-deficient and -sufficient patients with IBD ( = 0.068). CONCLUSIONS: More than one third of pediatric patients with IBD have lactase deficiency, which is not significantly different from non-IBD patients with chronic abdominal pain. The majority of lactase-deficient patients with IBD have normal duodenal biopsy results. Lactase activity from small bowel biopsy specimens can be measured at the time of initial endoscopy. Reevaluation, either by small bowel biopsy or the breath hydrogen test, may then be considered during follow-up of symptomatic patients.},

   abstract = {Folate is involved in the synthesis of nucleotides and amino acid metabolism such as methylation of homocysteine to methionine. Methionine is activated by adenosine triphosphate (ATP) to produce S-adenosylmethionine (SAM), the primary intracellular methyl donor. Thus, folate is essential for the synthesis, methylation, and repair of DNA. With regard to its biochemical function it has been hypothesized that a diminished folate status may contribute to carcinogenesis by alteration of gene expression and increased DNA damage. Animal and human studies support this hypothesis, particularly with respect to colorectal cancer. Epidemiological evidence for the association between folate status and cancer was first observed among ulcerative colitis patients. Several case-control studies demonstrated reduction in colorectal cancer risk with better folate status. Two large, prospective cohort studies support the concept that high folate intake is protective against colon cancer. In contrast to colorectal cancer, the potential association of folate status and risk has been less investigated in breast cancer. Recently, convincing epidemiological data establishing a positive effect of folate status on breast cancer risk were published. This review summarizes the epidemiological evidence for the association between folate status and colorectal and breast cancer risk. In addition, a short overview is given on the discussed mechanism(s) by which folate might be involved in carcinogenesis.},

Several studies have confirmed the efficacy and patient tolerance of balsalazide. When compared to mesalazine at equivalent doses, it induced symptomatic and complete remission of acute ulcerative colitis in a greater proportion of patients. In particular, patients with resistant left-sided disease were shown to have a higher probability of achieving remission. Balsalazide was beneficial in patients with troublesome nocturnal symptoms. It has a similar efficacy in maintaining remission when compared to sulfasalazine and mesalazine. The advantage of balsalazide over other 5-aminosalicylic acid compounds is its superior patient tolerability with minimal side-effects.},

There have been few previous studies on the quality of life for children with inflammatory bowel disease (IBD). METHODS: A cross-cultural comparison was performed to determine whether the concerns of children with IBD in the United Kingdom are ranked similarly to those of children with IBD in Canada. An item reduction questionnaire, developed from interviews with Canadian children with IBD, was scored by 53 British children with IBD for importance and frequency, as a questionnaire had been scored previously by 117 Canadian children. RESULTS: There was a significant correlation between the mean scores (r = 0.831, P < 0.001) and ranks (r = 0.801, P < 0.001) for the 96 questions, and 43 of the 50 highest-ranking concerns corresponded for both populations. Confidence interval analysis showed a significant difference between the mean values for 21 of the 96 items; 20 of these 21 were ranked higher in the United Kingdom than they had been in Canada, suggesting that the frequency and/or degree of concern was greater for the British children with IBD. CONCLUSIONS: Health-related concerns of British children with Crohn disease and ulcerative colitis correlate closely with those of Canadian children with those diseases. Further studies are needed to determine the sensitivity of individual questions, the most appropriate wording of these questions, and the optimal length for a proposed instrument to assess quality of life in children with IBD.},

   abstract = {Crohn's disease and ulcerative colitis remain medically incurable conditions with potentially significant morbidity. The treatment of children with these conditions therefore should seek to reduce or eliminate symptoms, optimize nutritional status, promote normal growth and development, prevent complications, and minimize the potential psychologic effects of chronic illness. Treatment strategies must seek to both induce and maintain clinical remission. For all but the most mildly affected children with Crohn's disease, a combination of nutritional and pharmacologic approaches is optimal. For those with ulcerative colitis, anti-inflammatory medication is necessary. Moderate to severe Crohn's disease acutely responds best to potent immunomodulatory therapy, eg, corticosteroids and infliximab. Either agent must be coupled with 6-mercaptopurine or azathioprine to maintain long-term remission and to minimize toxicity. Particular attention must be paid to limit the growth suppression and other toxic effects of corticosteroids. Elemental or semielemental enteral nutrition also can induce remission effectively, but relapse is common after primary nutritional therapy is discontinued, mandating concomitant pharmacologic therapy with either 6-mercaptopurine or azathioprine. The availability of 6-mercaptopurine/azathioprine metabolite testing allows optimization of immunomodulatory therapy, detection of noncompliance, and avoidance of potentially dangerous toxicity. Mild ulcerative colitis acutely responds to treatment with a 5-aminosalicylate medication. Long-term remission frequently can be maintained with the same medication. Moderate to severe disease activity requires potent immunomodulatory therapy if colectomy is to be avoided. Surgery is a potential cure for patients with ulcerative colitis, although the development of pouchitis after ileal pouch anal anastomosis is common and frequently requires long-term medical management. Surgery provides only palliative relief of complications in those with Crohn's disease. Emerging therapies, especially evolving biologic and probiotic agents, offer hope for better treatments in the years ahead.},

   abstract = {Most patients with inflammatory bowel disease can be managed with conventional immunosuppressive therapy. The choice of agents to prevent relapses of inflammatory bowel disease must be based on efficacy, toxicity and cost. Studies in animal models of inflammatory bowel disease indicate that chronic intestinal inflammation results from enhanced immune responses to bacteria that are present normally in the lumen. Loss of tolerance, an abnormal function or defective healing of the mucosal barrier may all give raise to chronic intestinal inflammation. This hypothesis is the basis of new therapies aimed at either decreasing the levels of luminal bacterial antigens and/or selectively blocking detrimental mucosal immune responses. Anti-TNF is an example of this novel approach that is very effective in Crohn's disease. The use of biological therapy is costly, however, and the long-term complications are not yet known. The recent increase of tuberculosis in patients treated with anti-TNF indicates that careful monitoring is necessary. It is clear that the new forms of treatment may play an important role in tailoring the appropriate drug to a specific group of patients. However, for the time being, fine-tuning in the use of conventional immunosuppression is necessary. New knowledge in the pharmacogenetics of these compounds allows improvements to be made in their use. It is to be hoped that a critical approach in the use of current and future drugs, taking into account the advances in the aetiopathogenesis of inflammatory bowel disease, will contribute to the quality of life of patients with inflammatory bowel disease.},

   abstract = {Probiotic therapy is attracting the renewed interest of clinicians and basic investigators from a variety of traditional research disciplines. While the theoretical rationale for modifying the commensal flora of the gastrointestinal tract in specific circumstances appears sound and requires scientific pursuit, the field of probiotics has been clouded by exaggerated claims from some quarters. In general, many of the claims for therapeutic efficacy have not been well substantiated, but the field is now poised for evaluation within the realm of evidence-based medicine. Alterations in commensal bacterial flora within the gastrointestinal tract are associated with susceptibility to pathogens such as Clostridium difficile and there is persuasive evidence that the normal flora may participate in the pathogenesis of inflammatory bowel disease and other chronic diseases in genetically susceptible individuals. This has prompted various strategies to fortify or otherwise modify the enteric flora by dietary supplements containing probiotic formulations. Detailed comparisons of probiotic performance amongst different bacterial strains have not been performed in vivo in man or under clinical trial conditions, and the level of scientific characterisation of individual organisms has been variable. In addition, it cannot be assumed that the same probiotic is equally suitable for all individuals. Moreover, the heterogeneity of clinical disorders such as Crohn's disease and ulcerative colitis implies that strain-specific properties may be required for subset-specific categories of patients. While cocktails of probiotics offer convenience, therapeutic progress may require clarification of the mechanism of probiotic action and may be delayed until individual bacterial components have been rigorously studied. More importantly, the full potential of therapeutic manipulation of the enteric flora with probiotics or other strategies may not be optimally realised until the composition and metabolic activities of the normal flora are better understood.},

Some of the effects of omega-3 PUFA are brought about by modulation of the amount and types of eicosanoids made, and other effects are elicited by eicosanoid-independent mechanisms, including actions upon intracellular signaling pathways, transcription factor activity and gene expression. Animal experiments and clinical intervention studies indicate that omega-3 fatty acids have anti-inflammatory properties and, therefore, might be useful in the management of inflammatory and autoimmune diseases. Coronary heart disease, major depression, aging and cancer are characterized by an increased level of interleukin 1 (IL-1), a proinflammatory cytokine. Similarly, arthritis, Crohn's disease, ulcerative colitis and lupus erythematosis are autoimmune diseases characterized by a high level of IL-1 and the proinflammatory leukotriene LTB(4) produced by omega-6 fatty acids. There have been a number of clinical trials assessing the benefits of dietary supplementation with fish oils in several inflammatory and autoimmune diseases in humans, including rheumatoid arthritis, Crohn's disease, ulcerative colitis, psoriasis, lupus erythematosus, multiple sclerosis and migraine headaches. Many of the placebo-controlled trials of fish oil in chronic inflammatory diseases reveal significant benefit, including decreased disease activity and a lowered use of anti-inflammatory drugs.},

   abstract = {UNLABELLED: In the 1970s several reports highlighted the long delay in diagnosis often experienced by children with Crohn's disease. In recent years this disorder has attracted much publicity, and many believe that the incidence has increased substantially. The aim of this investigation was to determine whether heightened awareness had shortened the interval to diagnosis, improved clinical management and reduced morbidity. A retrospective study was therefore carried out on 112 children with inflammatory bowel disease (64 Crohn's disease, 41 ulcerative colitis, 7 indeterminate colitis) referred to a paediatric gastroenterology department in the UK between 1994 and 1998. In Crohn's disease the median interval to diagnosis was 47 wk (maximum 7 y). In those without diarrhoea this was longer (66 vs 28 wk; p = 0.005). In ulcerative colitis the median interval was 20 wk (maximum 3 y). Even in severe colitis the median interval was 5.5 wk (range 3-9 wk) and 4 required urgent colectomy soon after referral. Many with unrecognized Crohn's disease had undergone inappropriate treatments, such as growth hormone or psychiatric therapy. Nineteen (17%) had undergone endoscopic investigations in adult units prior to referral. Malnutrition was equally common in Crohn's disease and ulcerative colitis (11%). Short stature was present in 19% with Crohn's disease, and 5% with ulcerative colitis, and was severe in 8% with Crohn's disease. There was a significant correlation between symptom duration and the degree of growth impairment present (r(s) = -0.4; p = 0.004). CONCLUSION: This study suggests that late diagnosis and inappropriate investigation and management are still significant problems.},

   abstract = {BACKGROUND: Elevated serum levels of several potent angiogenesis factors, including vascular endothelial growth factor and basic fibroblast growth factor have been described in children with active inflammatory bowel disease. Angiogenesis-promoting cytokines may promote inflammation by increasing vascular permeability but also mediate tissue repair by activating fibroblasts. Hepatocyte growth factor (HGF) is another angiogenesis-promoting cytokine that is increased in colon cancer tissues. We therefore evaluated serum HGF levels in individuals with Crohn disease and ulcerative colitis. METHODS: Serum samples were obtained from 60 patients with Crohn disease, 31 with ulcerative colitis, and 38 controls with functional abdominal pain and other gastrointestinal illnesses. Disease activity for Crohn disease patients was determined using the pediatric Crohn disease activity index, and for ulcerative colitis patients using the Kozarek score. The HGF levels were measured by enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay. RESULTS: Serum HGF levels were significantly ( P < 0.001) higher for Crohn disease patients (1439 +/- 84 pg/mL) and ulcerative colitis patients (1384 +/- 107 pg/mL) than for control patients (807 +/- 50 pg/mL). Serum HGF levels also rose with increasing disease activity in individuals with both Crohn disease and ulcerative colitis. CONCLUSION: Serum HGF is elevated in children and young adults who have Crohn disease or ulcerative colitis. Levels of serum HGF correlate directly with disease activity. The raised serum HGF suggests that HGF may mediate angiogenesis and vascular permeability in the mucosa of children with inflammatory bowel disease. Alternatively, the raised serum HGF may be an epiphenomenon of inflammation.},

Patients mainly present with a surgical abdomen and their management often proves to be a therapeutic challenge. Our series describes three such cases: the first patient presented with a tender left iliac fossa mass and rectal bleeding, the second with peritonitis and pneumoperitoneum, the third with severe acute colitis. All three patients needed urgent surgical intervention with further laparotomies due to recurrent ulceration, perforation and fistula formation in addition to intensive supportive measures such as inotropes and total parenteral nutrition. The importance and challenges of idiopathic chronic ulcerative enteritis are therefore discussed.},

   abstract = {BACKGROUND: The ileo-anal pouch is the surgical procedure of choice for patients with Ulcerative Colitis or Familial Adenomatous Polyposis, but has functional limitations such as a higher frequency of bowel movements, anal leakage, and sometimes the necessity of a protective anal pad. OBJECTIVE: To analyze the functional results and quality of life after the pelvic pouch. MATERIAL AND METHODS: This is a descriptive, prolective, and cross-sectional study that analyzes the clinical variables, functional results and self-reported quality of life of patients after an ileo-anal pouch. A correlation between postoperative clinical variables and quality of life was searched. RESULTS: Twenty-seven patients were included. Mean age was 36 years. Surgical indications for the ileo-anal pouch were Ulcerative Colitis in 17 (63%), Familial Adenomatous Polyposis in 9 (33%) and a colo-rectostomy stricture in 1 (4%). Mean number of bowel movements was 4 at day and 1 at night. Eighteen percent of patients referred anal leakage, 11% had pouchitis, and 11% small bowel obstruction. Most of the patients reported high scores in all evaluated quality of life scales. There was a correlation between lower scores of quality of life and a higher number of bowel movements. CONCLUSIONS: The majority of patients reported an adequate quality of life after the ileo-anal pouch; there was a correlation between lower scores of quality of life and a higher number of bowel movements.},

   abstract = {BACKGROUND: Upper gastrointestinal endoscopic biopsies often show histologic abnormalities in Crohn disease. Consequently, it has been proposed that routine endoscopy could help to distinguish Crohn disease from ulcerative colitis. Surprisingly, however, recent case reports and an uncontrolled study suggested that similar abnormalities may occur in ulcerative colitis. Therefore, a blinded, controlled study was performed. METHODS: Esophageal, gastric antral, and duodenal biopsies from children with Crohn disease (n = 28) and ulcerative colitis (n = 14) were compared with those from controls undergoing endoscopy for suspected reflux esophagitis (n = 22). Two pathologists, unaware of patient identity and diagnosis, agreed on a consensus report. Severity of inflammation was scored semiquantitatively. Helicobacter pylori colonization was an exclusion criterion. RESULTS: Inflammation was reported as follows: esophagitis: controls 91%; Crohn disease: 72%; ulcerative colitis: 50%; gastritis: controls: 27%; Crohn disease: 92% (P < 0.001); ulcerative colitis: 69%; duodenitis: controls: 9%; Crohn disease: 33%; ulcerative colitis: 23%. In Crohn disease, granulomas were noted in 40% of patients (P = 0.001). Duodenal cryptitis was noted in 26% of patients with Crohn disease but not ulcerative colitis. In one patient with ulcerative colitis, neutrophilic infiltration of gastric glands was seen. Abnormalities seen in Crohn disease and ulcerative colitis included gastroduodenal ulceration (Crohn disease, 7%; ulcerative colitis, 8%), villus atrophy (Crohn disease, 11%; ulcerative colitis, 15%), and increased intraepithelial lymphocytes (Crohn disease, 15%; ulcerative colitis, 31% [P < 0.05]). None of these abnormalities was noted in the controls. CONCLUSION: Although the presence of granulomas can support a diagnosis of Crohn disease, severe inflammation and other abnormalities occur in the proximal gastrointestinal tract in Crohn disease and ulcerative colitis.},

   abstract = {PURPOSE: Inflammation is a constant finding in the ileal reservoir of patients with an ileal pouch-anal anastomosis and is associated with decreased fecal concentrations of the short chain fatty acid butyrate, increased fecal pH, changes in fecal flora, and increased concentrations of secondary bile acids. In healthy subjects, inulin, a dietary fiber, is fermented to short chain fatty acids and leads to a lower pH and potentially beneficial changes in fecal flora. The aim of the present study was to investigate the effect of enteral supplementation of inulin on inflammation of the ileal reservoir. METHODS: Twenty patients received 24 g of inulin or placebo daily during three weeks in a randomized, double-blind, crossover design. Stools were analyzed after each test period for pH, short chain fatty acids, microflora, and bile acids. Inflammation was assessed endoscopically, histologically, and clinically. RESULTS: Compared with placebo, three weeks of dietary supplementation with 24 g of inulin increased butyrate concentrations, lowered pH, decreased numbers of Bacteroides fragilis, and diminished concentrations of secondary bile acids in feces. This was endoscopically and histologically accompanied by a reduction of inflammation of the mucosa of the ileal reservoir. CONCLUSION: Enteral inulin supplementation leads to a decrease of inflammation-associated factors and to a reduction of inflammation of pouch mucosa.},
