   abstract = {BACKGROUND: Complementary and alternative medicines (CAM) are widely used by patients with inflammatory bowel disease (IBD). Few data have been published on the impact of CAM on the quality of life (QOL). AIMS: The aim of the study was to describe CAM use in French patients with IBD, identify characteristics associated with CAM use, and assess the impact of CAM on the QOL. METHODS: We conducted an internet survey on CAM through the French IBD patient's association website. Patients had to answer a questionnaire (LimeSurvey application) about sociodemography, IBD treatment, CAM type, socioeconomic data, and QOL using the Short IBD Questionnaire (SIBDQ). Patients noted the impact of CAM on their symptoms and on their QOL on a scale of 0-100. CAM users and nonusers were compared by univariate and multivariate analyses. RESULTS: A total of 936 IBD patients responded and 767 (82.4%) filled up the whole questionnaire: 503 reported CAM use and 172 had never used. The types of CAM reported were diet-based (30.7%), body-based (25.1%), homeopathic or traditional medicine (19.6%), naturopathy (15.2%), and mind-body medicine (9.1%). The gastroenterologist was aware of CAM use in only 46% of patients. CAM users were more likely to have ulcerative colitis [odds ratio (OR)=1.78, P=0.018], clinical remission (OR=1.42, P=0.06), high level of education (OR=1.51, P=0.02), poor observance (OR=1.81, P=0.017), or to have terminated conventional treatment (OR=2.03, P=0.003). CAM users tend to have higher rates of SIBDQ scores, greater than 50 (OR=1.57, P=0.06). Improvement in symptoms and QOL was reported with all CAM types except mind medicine. CONCLUSION: CAM use is widespread among IBD patients. CAM users report improvement in symptoms and QOL, but they tend to stop their conventional treatment. Better information about CAM might improve adherence to conventional treatment.},

   abstract = {SCOPE: The human/microbiota cross-talk is partially mediated by bacteria-derived peptides like Serine-Threonine peptide (STp), which is resistant to gut proteolysis, is found in the human healthy colon and induces regulatory properties on gut dendritic cells (DCs); here we characterized human gut DC in ulcerative colitis (UC) patients and studied the effect of STp on their properties. METHODS AND RESULTS: Human colonic DC from healthy controls and UC patients were isolated, conditioned for 24 h +/- STp and characterized by flow cytometry, immunohistochemistry, and electron microscopy. Expression of immature DC markers DC-SIGN and ILT3, and Toll-like receptors were increased on gut UC-DC. Langerin (involved in phagocytosis), lymph node homing marker CCR7, and activation markers CD40/CD80/CD86 were decreased in UC. Gut DC had restricted stimulatory capacity for T-cells in UC. Conditioning of DC with STp in vitro reduced Toll-like receptor expression, increased CD40 and CD80 expression, and restored their stimulatory capacity. CONCLUSION: Colonic DCs display an abnormal immature phenotype in UC, which was partially restored following STp treatment. Bacteria-derived metabolites, like STp, seem to have a role in gut homeostasis that is missing in UC so they might lead a new era of probiotic products setting the basis for nondrug dietary therapy in inflammatory bowel disease.},

   abstract = {BACKGROUND: Crohn disease (CD) and ulcerative colitis (UC) are 2 common inflammatory bowel diseases (IBDs) associated with intestinal inflammation and tissue damage. Oxidative stress is suggested to play a major role in the initiation and progression of IBD. Vitamin C (ascorbate, ascorbic acid) supplementation has reduced oxidative stress in persons with IBD. The role of ascorbate transporters in IBD remains to be determined. SLC23A1 is a major ascorbate transporter in the intestinal tract, and some of its genetic variants have been associated with severely decreased ascorbate transport and lower systemic concentrations. OBJECTIVE: This study aimed to determine whether common genetic variants in the vitamin C transporter SLC23A1 are associated with the risk of IBD. DESIGN: Genomic DNA samples from patients with CD (n = 162) and UC (n = 149) from the Manitoba IBD Cohort Study and ethnically matched controls (n = 142) were genotyped for 3 SLC23A1 polymorphisms (rs6596473, rs33972313, and rs10063949) by using TaqMan assays. RESULTS: Variation at rs10063949 (G allele for heterozygote and homozygote) was associated with increased susceptibility to CD (OR: 2.54; 95% CI: 1.38, 4.66; OR: 4.72; 95% CI: 2.53, 8.81; P < 0.0001; respectively). A strong linkage disequilibrium (LD) was observed across the SLC23A1 region (variation rs6596473 with rs10063949) for CD and UC (D' = 0.94 and 0.96, respectively). The risk alleles confirmed a haplotype (CGG) that is carried more in CD patients (65.3%, P < 0.0001) than in controls (43.5%). CONCLUSIONS: A genetic variant (rs10063949-G) in the SLC23A1 ascorbate transporter locus was identified and is associated with an increased risk of CD in a white Canadian IBD cohort. The presented evidence that SLC23A1 variations can modulate the risk of CD has implications for understanding ascorbate transport in CD patients and provides a novel opportunity toward individualized nutritional therapy for patients carrying the disease-associated genotype.},

   abstract = {Crohn's disease (CD) and ulcerative colitis (UC) are chronic immunologically mediated diseases that often have a relapsing-remitting course in young persons. Genetic-risk polymorphisms explain less than one third of the heritability of disease. Epidemiologic and laboratory data suggest that environmental factors play a significant role in influencing the risk and natural history of disease. Smoking is the most widely and consistently described risk factor. It, however, increases the risk of CD while conferring protection against UC. The gut microbiome is a key component in the development of inflammatory bowel disease (IBD). Several external factors potentially exert an effect by influencing the composition of the gut microbiome or disrupting the intestinal barrier. These external influences include the use of antibiotics or nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drugs and the presence of enteric infections. Data on diet have been inconsistent, but high fiber intake, particularly of soluble fiber, appears to protect against CD, whereas protein intake may increase disease risk. Vitamin D may also play an important protective role, particularly in patients with CD. Neurobehavioral factors, such as stress and depression, also influence the risk of IBD. Systematic and rigorous studies of environmental exposures in the management of IBD are needed. In particular, studies of whether environmental factors can be modified to reduce the likelihood of relapse or improve patient outcomes would be valuable.},

   abstract = {Inflammatory bowel diseases [IBD; Crohn's disease (CD), ulcerative colitis (UC)] are chronic immunologically mediated diseases that are due to a dysregulated immune response to intestinal flora in a genetically susceptible host. Despite advances in genetics, the likelihood of occurrence of disease remains incompletely explained and there appears to be a strong role for the environment in mediating risk of disease. Smoking remains the most widely studied and replicated risk factor, contributing to increased risk and severity of CD while conferring protection against UC. Recent data has suggested novel risk factors. Lower plasma vitamin D is associated with an increased risk of Crohn's disease, and vitamin D supplementation may prevent relapse of disease. Several medications including oral contraceptives, post-menopausal hormone replacement, aspirin, NSAIDs, and antibiotics may increase risk of CD or UC with the mechanisms of effect remaining inadequately defined. There is continuing evidence that depression and psychosocial stress may play a role in the pathogenesis of both CD and UC, while at the same time also increasing risk for disease flares. There is also a growing understanding of the role of diet on IBD, in particular through its effect on the microbiome. Animal protein intake and n-6 fatty acids may increase risk of UC while n-3 fatty acids and dietary fiber may confer protection. The effect of diet on established disease remains poorly studied. There is need for routine measurement of a spectrum of environmental exposures in prospective studies to further our understanding.},

   abstract = {Inflammatory bowel diseases comprising Crohn's disease (CD) and ulcerative colitis (UC) are chronic immunologically mediated diseases. The key mechanism underlying the pathogenesis of these diseases is a dysregulated immune response to commensal flora in a genetically susceptible host. Thus intestinal microbial dysbiosis, host genetics, and the external environment all play an important role in the development of incident disease and in determining subsequent disease behavior and outcomes. There are several well-defined or putative environmental risk factors including cigarette smoking, appendectomy, diet, stress and depression, vitamin D as well as hormonal influence. The effect of some of the risk factors appears to differ between CD and UC suggesting that despite shared genetic and immunologic mechanisms, distinct pathways of pathogenesis exist. There is a growing body of literature identifying risk factors for incident disease. There is less rigorous literature defining triggers of relapse, and few controlled clinical trials examining if modification of such risk factors results in an improvement in patient outcomes. This is an area of considerable patient, physician, and scientific interest, and there is an important unmet need for rigorous studies of the external environment in disease pathogenesis and subsequent course.},

   abstract = {INTRODUCTION: Dietary fats influence intestinal inflammation and regulate mucosal immunity. Data on the association between dietary fat and risk of Crohn's disease (CD) and ulcerative colitis (UC) are limited and conflicting. METHODS: We conducted a prospective study of women enrolled in the Nurses' Health Study cohorts. Diet was prospectively ascertained every 4 years using a validated semi-quantitative food frequency questionnaire. Self-reported CD and UC were confirmed through medical record review. We examined the effect of energy-adjusted cumulative average total fat intake and specific types of fat and fatty acids on the risk of CD and UC using Cox proportional hazards models adjusting for potential confounders. RESULTS: Among 170,805 women, we confirmed 269 incident cases of CD (incidence 8/100,000 person-years) and 338 incident cases of UC (incidence 10/100,000 person-years) over 26 years and 3,317,338 person-years of follow-up. Cumulative energy-adjusted intake of total fat, saturated fats, unsaturated fats, n-6 and n-3 polyunsaturated fatty acids (PUFAs) were not associated with risk of CD or UC. However, greater intake of long-chain n-3 PUFAs was associated with a trend towards lower risk of UC (HR 0.72, 95% CI 0.51 to 1.01). In contrast, high long-term intake of trans-unsaturated fatty acids was associated with a trend towards an increased incidence of UC (HR 1.34, 95% CI 0.94 to 1.92). CONCLUSIONS: A high intake of dietary long-chain n-3 PUFAs may be associated with a reduced risk of UC. In contrast, high intake of trans-unsaturated fats may be associated with an increased risk of UC.},

   abstract = {BACKGROUND & AIMS: Increased intake of dietary fiber has been proposed to reduce the risk of inflammatory bowel disease (Crohn's disease [CD] and ulcerative colitis [UC]). However, few prospective studies have examined associations between long-term intake of dietary fiber and risk of incident CD or UC. METHODS: We collected and analyzed data from 170,776 women, followed up over 26 years, who participated in the Nurses' Health Study, followed up for 3,317,425 person-years. Dietary information was prospectively ascertained via administration of a validated semiquantitative food frequency questionnaire every 4 years. Self-reported CD and UC were confirmed through review of medical records. Cox proportional hazards models, adjusting for potential confounders, were used to calculate hazard ratios (HRs). RESULTS: We confirmed 269 incident cases of CD (incidence, 8/100,000 person-years) and 338 cases of UC (incidence, 10/100,000 person-years). Compared with the lowest quintile of energy-adjusted cumulative average intake of dietary fiber, intake of the highest quintile (median of 24.3 g/day) was associated with a 40% reduction in risk of CD (multivariate HR for CD, 0.59; 95% confidence interval, 0.39-0.90). This apparent reduction appeared to be greatest for fiber derived from fruits; fiber from cereals, whole grains, or legumes did not modify risk. In contrast, neither total intake of dietary fiber (multivariate HR, 0.82; 95% confidence interval, 0.58-1.17) nor intake of fiber from specific sources appeared to be significantly associated with risk of UC. CONCLUSIONS: Based on data from the Nurses' Health Study, long-term intake of dietary fiber, particularly from fruit, is associated with lower risk of CD but not UC. Further studies are needed to determine the mechanisms that mediate this association.},

   abstract = {Inflammatory bowel diseases (Crohn's disease and ulcerative colitis) are chronic immunologically mediated diseases of the gut. Advances in genetics have revolutionized our understanding of the pathogenesis of these conditions with 163 risk loci identified, encompassing a variety of immunologic functions. There is substantial heterogeneity in the natural history of these diseases with respect to disease onset, course, and progression to complications. There are also significant variations in response to therapies and susceptibility to therapy-related and disease-related complications. An important need in the field is to identify predictors of disease course, complications, and likelihood of response and adverse events to allow for targeted therapeutic decision making. The genotype of an individual in constant and non-modifiable, and thus could potentially fulfill the role of important predictors of these outcomes. In this review, we discuss the existing literature on the prediction of various disease phenotypes in Crohn's disease and ulcerative colitis using underlying genotype. We also identify gaps in the literature and suggest future directions for research. There is need for large, multi-institutional, and international collaborative consortia with efficient and detailed cohort accrual, phenotypic definition, genotyping, and dynamic assessments of external (e.g., diet) and internal (microbiome) environment to allow us to progress toward personalized and precision medicine in the management of these complex diseases.},

   abstract = {BACKGROUND AND AIM: A major use of breath hydrogen testing is to assess absorptive capacity for sugars to assist dietary design for management of gut symptoms. Qualitative reporting takes no account of the vigor of hydrogen response and provides little insight into degrees of malabsorption. This study aimed to describe a semiquantitative reporting method and to compare results with those reported qualitatively. METHODS: In consecutive Caucasian patients with Crohn's disease (n = 87), ulcerative colitis (59), functional gastrointestinal disorders (FGID) (162), and healthy controls (76), area under the curve was calculated for lactulose (15 g). This was compared with that for lactose (50 g) and fructose (35 g). Degree of malabsorption was categorized into arbitrary groups. RESULTS: Semiquantitative results for >/= 30% (designated "convincing") malabsorption was most similar to those using a qualitative cutoff value of 20 ppm, but in 38% and 21% of patients, the classification of malabsorption (nil or clinically significant) changed for fructose and lactose, respectively. Using a cutoff of 10 ppm, 49% and 5% were classified differently. Crohn's disease had a higher prevalence (42%) of convincing fructose malabsorption than controls (24%) or patients with FGID (33%) (P < 0.02). Highest prevalence of convincing lactose malabsorption (38%) was in ulcerative colitis, greater than controls (18%) and FGID (18%) (P < 0.02). CONCLUSIONS: Semiquantitative assessment provides different results with different clinical implications in more than one third of patients, but disease-related alterations in prevalence are similar to those defined qualitatively. This method may be preferable because it lessens the confounding influence of the vigor of the hydrogen response.},

   abstract = {OBJECTIVE: To explore the risk of new or recurrent cancer among patients with IBD and previous cancer, exposed or not to immunosuppressants. DESIGN: Among the 17 047 patients of the CESAME prospective observational cohort who were enrolled from May 2004 to June 2005, and followed-up until December 2007, we identified 405 patients with cancer diagnosed previous to study entry. We calculated the rates of incident cancer in patients with or without previous cancer, and we assessed by survival analysis and nested case-control study the impact of immunosuppressants on the risk of incident new or recurrent cancer in patients with previous cancer. RESULTS: The rate of incident cancer was 21.1/1000 patient-years (PY) and 6.1/1000 PY in patients with and without previous cancer, respectively. The multivariate-adjusted HR of incident cancer between patients with and without previous cancer was 1.9 (95% CI 1.2 to 3.0, p=0.003). Among patients with previous cancer, the rates of new and recurrent cancers were, respectively, 13.2/1000 PY and 6.0/1000 PY in the 312 patients who were not taking immunosuppressant at the time of study entry, and 23.1/1000 PY and 3.9/1000 PY in the 93 patients treated with immunosuppressants at study entry. There was no significant association between the exposure to immunosuppressants and the risk of new or recurrent cancer. CONCLUSIONS: Patients with IBD with a history of cancer are at increased risk of developing any (new or recurrent) cancer, with a predominant incidence of new cancers. Treatment with immunosuppressants has no overall major impact per se on this risk.},

   abstract = {The dysbiosis theory of inflammatory bowel disease (IBD) posits that there is an alteration in the gut microbiome as an important underpinning of disease etiology. It stands to reason then, that administering agents that could impact on the balance of microbes on the gut could be impactful on the course of IBD. Herein is a review of the controlled trials undertaken to assess the use of antibiotics that would kill or suppress potentially injurious microbes, probiotics that would overpopulate the gut with potentially beneficial microbes or prebiotics that provide a metabolic substrate that enhances the growth of potentially beneficial microbes. With regard to antibiotics, the best data are for the use of nitroimadoles postoperatively in Crohn's disease (CD) to prevent disease recurrence. Otherwise, the data are limited with the regard to any lasting benefit of antibiotics sustaining remission in either CD or ulcerative colitis (UC). A recent meta-analysis concluded that antibiotics are superior to placebo at inducing remission in CD or UC, although the meta-analysis grouped a variety of antibiotics with different spectra of activity. Despite the absence of robust clinical trial data, antibiotics are widely used to treat perineal fistulizing CD and acute and chronic pouchitis. Probiotics have not been shown to have a beneficial role in CD. However, Escherichia coli Nissle 1917 has comparable effects to low doses of mesalamine in maintaining remission in UC. VSL#3, a combination of 8 microbes, has been shown to have an effect in inducing remission in UC and preventing pouchitis. Prebiotics have yet to be shown to have an effect in any form of IBD, but to date controlled trials have been small. The use of antibiotics should be balanced against the risks they pose. Even probiotics may pose some risk and should not be assumed to be innocuous especially when ingested by persons with a compromised epithelial barrier. Prebiotics may not be harmful but may cause gastrointestinal side effects. Finally, the timing of ingestion of antibiotics and other dietary factors that may function as prebiotics, especially in early childhood, may be critical in shaping the gut microbiome and ultimately predisposing to or preventing IBD. Finding ways to impact on the gut microbiome to alter the course of IBD makes good sense, but should be undertaken in the setting of rigorously performed controlled trials to ensure that the interventions are truly effective and well tolerated.},

   abstract = {Regular consumption of moderate doses of wine is an integral part of the Mediterranean diet, which has long been considered to provide remarkable health benefits. Wine's beneficial effect has been attributed principally to its non-alcoholic portion, which has antioxidant properties, and contains a wide variety of phenolics, generally called polyphenols. Wine phenolics may prevent or delay the progression of intestinal diseases characterized by oxidative stress and inflammation, especially because they reach higher concentrations in the gut than in other tissues. They act as both free radical scavengers and modulators of specific inflammation-related genes involved in cellular redox signaling. In addition, the importance of wine polyphenols has recently been stressed for their ability to act as prebiotics and antimicrobial agents. Wine components have been proposed as an alternative natural approach to prevent or treat inflammatory bowel diseases. The difficulty remains to distinguish whether these positive properties are due only to polyphenols in wine or also to the alcohol intake, since many studies have reported ethanol to possess various beneficial effects. Our knowledge of the use of wine components in managing human intestinal inflammatory diseases is still quite limited, and further clinical studies may afford more solid evidence of their beneficial effects.},

   abstract = {The number of microorganisms inhabiting the human digestive tract exceeds the number of body cells by a factor of ten. This microbial community affects host physiology and host health. The metabolic potential of the gut microbiota is immense affording the extraction of energy from otherwise indigestible carbohydrates (dietary fiber) and the conversion of host-derived substances, non-nutritive dietary components and drugs. Recognized functions of the gut microbiota include provision of colonization resistance against pathogens and priming of both the innate and the acquired immune systems. However, the intestinal microbiota may also contribute to the development of diseases such as ulcerative colitis and colorectal cancer. Culture-dependent studies provided basic knowledge on the gut microbiota, but only the advent of culture-independent molecular methods led to a better understanding of host-microbe interactions. The application of metagenomics to the gut microbial ecosystem revealed truly remarkable correlations between certain diseases and the gut microbiome. It also led to the suggestion of the existence of a 'core microbiome' that encompasses key functions shared by each individual. However, the mechanisms underlying host-microbe interactions have not yet been unraveled.},

   abstract = {INTRODUCTION: Calcium deficiency is considered a risk factor for the development of osteoporosis in inflammatory bowel disease (IBD) patients. Various dietary restrictions, including milk products are reported by these patients. OBJECTIVE: To evaluate dairy product and dietary calcium intake by IBD patients. METHODS: This cross-sectional study enrolled 65 outpatients with IBD recruited from one reference center for IBD. A semi-structured questionnaire (to collect demographic, socioeconomic and clinical data) and a quantitative food frequency questionnaire were administered. With regard to clinical data, we evaluated the anthropometric nutritional status, the disease classification, the disease activity index and the presence of gastrointestinal symptoms. Self-reported modifications in the use of dairy products were evaluated. RESULTS: The IBD patients' ages ranged from 20-75 years and 67.0% were diagnosed with ulcerative colitis. The majority (64.7%) reported restricting dairy products. The frequency of gastrointestinal symptoms was higher among the Crohn's disease patients who restricted dairy products than among those with no restrictions (100% vs 42.9%; p = 0.013); this result was not observed among the UC (ulcerative colitis) patients. Disease activity was also more frequent in the IBD patients who restricted dairy products than in those with no restrictions (23.8% vs 4.5%; p = 0.031), and among the UC patients, extensive disease was more common in the patients who restricted dairy products than in those with no restrictions (42.9% vs 20.0%; p = 0.03). CONCLUSION: Restricting dairy products is common among IBD patients, possibly due to disease activity, the presence of gastrointestinal symptoms and the extension of the disease.},

   abstract = {Inflammatory bowel diseases (IBD), consisting of Crohn's disease (CD) and ulcerative colitis (UC), are chronic immune mediated diseases of unknown aetiology. Traditionally, the highest occurrence of both UC and CD is found in North America and Europe, including Scandinavia and the United Kingdom, while the diseases remain rare in Eastern Europe. Until recently, few population-based cohort data were available on the epidemiology of IBD in Eastern Europe. However, recent studies from Hungary and Croatia have reported steep increases in IBD incidence that means they are now comparable with Western European countries. The reasons for these changes remain unknown but could include an increasing awareness of the diseases, better access to diagnostic procedures, methodological bias in previous studies from Eastern Europe, or real differences in environmental factors, lifestyle and genetic susceptibility. The aim of this thesis was to create a prospective European population-based inception cohort of incident IBD patients in order to investigate whether an East-West gradient in the incidence of IBD exists in Europe. Furthermore, we investigated possible differences throughout Europe during the first year subsequent to diagnosis in terms of clinical presentation, disease outcome, treatment choices, frequency of environmental risk factors, as well as patient-reported health-related quality of life (HRQoL) and quality of care (QoC). Finally, we assessed resource utilization during the initial year of disease in both geographic regions. A total number of 31 centres from 14 Western and 8 Eastern European countries covering a total background population of approximately 10.1 million participated in this study. During the inclusion period from 1 January to 31 December 2010 a total number of 1,515 patients aged 15 years or older were included in the cohort. Annual incidence rates were twice as high in Western Europe (CD: 6.3/100,000; UC: 9.8/100,000) compared to Eastern Europe (CD: 3.3/100,000; UC: 4.6/100,000), thus confirming a gradient in IBD incidence. The incidence gradient could not be explained by marked differences in environmental factors prior to IBD diagnosis. In fact, Eastern European patients had higher frequencies of dietary risk factors than Western European patients, while the remaining risk factors occurred just as frequently. Furthermore, the availability of diagnostic tools and the diagnostic strategy did not differ, and in fact was better in Eastern Europe in terms of the use of colonoscopies and diagnostic delay. In terms of socio-economic characteristics as well as clinical presentation at diagnosis Eastern and Western European IBD patients did not differ significantly. However, regarding treatment choices during the initial year of disease the use of biological therapy was significantly higher in Western Europe for both CD and UC, while Eastern European centres used 5-ASA more often in CD and UC. In both regions patients were treated earlier and more frequently with immunomodulators compared to previous cohorts. But despite these differences in treatment, disease course - including hospitalisation and surgery rates during the first year of disease - were similar in both regions and the majority of patients were in clinical remission at follow-up. Finally, generic and disease-specific HRQoL improved in all IBD patients and at twelve months follow-up the majority of patients had a good disease-specific HRQoL score. Differences in how, and from whom, patients received disease-specific education and information were noted between the geographic regions; for instance IBD specialist nurses were not used in Eastern European IBD centres. Expenses for the cohort during the initial year of disease exceeded four million Euros with most money spent on diagnostics and surgery. Biological therapy accounted for one fourth costs in Western European CD patients. Long-term follow-up of the EpiCom cohort is needed in order to assess whether the earlier and more frequent treatment with immunomodulators and biologicals observed in this study will change the natural disease course and phenotypes over time or merely postpone outcomes such as surgery. Furthermore, the question of if and how differences in treatment choices between Eastern and Western Europe impact on the disease course requires long-term follow-up.},

   abstract = {BACKGROUND AND AIMS: The incidence of inflammatory bowel disease (IBD) is increasing in Eastern Europe possibly due to changes in environmental factors towards a more "westernised" standard of living. The aim of this study was to investigate differences in exposure to environmental factors prior to diagnosis in Eastern and Western European IBD patients. METHODS: The EpiCom cohort is a population-based, prospective inception cohort of 1560 unselected IBD patients from 31 European countries covering a background population of 10.1 million. At the time of diagnosis patients were asked to complete an 87-item questionnaire concerning environmental factors. RESULTS: A total of 1182 patients (76%) answered the questionnaire, 444 (38%) had Crohn's disease (CD), 627 (53%) ulcerative colitis (UC), and 111 (9%) IBD unclassified. No geographic differences regarding smoking status, caffeine intake, use of oral contraceptives, or number of first-degree relatives with IBD were found. Sugar intake was higher in CD and UC patients from Eastern Europe than in Western Europe while fibre intake was lower (p<0.01). Daily consumption of fast food as well as appendectomy before the age of 20 was more frequent in Eastern European than in Western European UC patients (p<0.01). Eastern European CD and UC patients had received more vaccinations and experienced fewer childhood infections than Western European patients (p<0.01). CONCLUSIONS: In this European population-based inception cohort of unselected IBD patients, Eastern and Western European patients differed in environmental factors prior to diagnosis. Eastern European patients exhibited higher occurrences of suspected risk factors for IBD included in the Western lifestyle.},

   abstract = {OBJECTIVE: Dietary factors have been indicated to influence the pathogenesis and nature course of inflammatory bowel diseases (IBD) with their wide variances. The aim of the study was to assess the prevalence and clinical significance of 14 serum food specific immunoglobulin G (sIgG) antibodies in patients with IBD. METHODS: This retrospective study comprised a total of 112 patients with IBD, including 79 with Crohn's disease (CD) and 33 with ulcerative colitis (UC). Medical records, clinical data and laboratory results were collected for analysis. Serum IgG antibodies against 14 unique food allergens were detected by semi-quantitative enzyme linked immunosorbent assay (ELISA). RESULTS: Food sIgG antibodies were detected in 75.9% (60/79) of CD patients, 63.6% (21/33) of UC patients and 33.1% (88/266) of healthy controls (HC). IBD patients showed the significantly higher antibodies prevalence than healthy controls (CD vs. HC, P = 0.000; UC vs. HC, P = 0.001). However no marked difference was observed between CD and UC groups (P = 0.184). More subjects were found with sensitivity to multiple antigens (>/= 3) in IBD than in HC group (33.9% vs.0.8%, P = 0.000). Egg was the most prevalent food allergen. There was a remarkable difference in the levels of general serum IgM (P = 0.045) and IgG (P = 0.041) between patients with positive and negative sIgG antibodies. Patients with multiple positive allergens (>/= 3) were especially found with significant higher total IgG levels compared with sIgG-negative patients (P = 0.003). Age was suggested as a protective factor against the occurrence of sIgG antibodies (P = 0.002). CONCLUSIONS: The study demonstrates a high prevalence of serum IgG antibodies to specific food allergens in patients with IBD. sIgG antibodies may potentially indicate disease status in clinical and be utilized to guide diets for patients.},

The aim of this study was to evaluate the effects of short- and long-term Passiflora edulis peel intake on the antioxidant status, microbiota, and short-chain fatty acids formation in rats with 2,4,6-trinitrobenzenesulphonic acid-induced colitis using two "in vivo" experiments: chronic (prevention) and acute (treatment). The colitis damage score was determined using macroscopic and microscopic analyses. In addition, the antioxidant activity in serum and other tissues (liver and colon) was evaluated. Bifidobacteria, lactobacilli, aerobic bacteria and enterobacteria, and the amount of short-chain fatty acids (acetic, butyric, and propionic acids) in cecum content were counted. Differences in the colon damage scores were observed; P. edulis peel intake improved serum antioxidant status. In the treatment protocol, decreased colon lipid peroxidation, a decreased number of aerobic bacteria and enterobacteria, and an improvement in acetic and butyric acid levels in the feces were observed. An improvement in the bifidobacteria and lactobacilli was observed in the prevention protocol. These results suggested that P. edulis peel can modulate microbiota and could be used as source of fiber and polyphenols in the prevention of oxidative stress through the improvement of serum and tissue antioxidant status.},

   abstract = {OBJECTIVES: Obesity is associated with a proinflammatory state that may be involved in the etiology of inflammatory bowel disease (IBD), for which there are plausible biological mechanisms. Our aim was to perform the first prospective cohort study investigating if there is an association between obesity and the development of incident IBD. METHODS: A total of 300,724 participants were recruited into the European Prospective Investigation into Cancer and Nutrition study. At recruitment, anthropometric measurements of height and weight plus physical activity and total energy intake from validated questionnaires were recorded. The cohort was monitored identifying participants who developed either Crohn's disease (CD) or ulcerative colitis (UC). Each case was matched with four controls and conditional logistic regression used to calculate odds ratios (ORs) for body mass index (BMI) adjusted for smoking, energy intake, and physical activity. RESULTS: In the cohort, 177 participants developed incident UC and 75 participants developed incident CD. There were no associations with the four higher categories of BMI compared with a normal BMI for UC (Ptrend=0.36) or CD (Ptrend=0.83). The lack of associations was consistent when BMI was analyzed as a continuous or binary variable (BMI 18.5<25.0 vs. >/=25 kg/m(2)). Physical activity and total energy intake, factors that influence BMI, did not show any association with UC (physical activity, Ptrend=0.79; total energy intake, Ptrend=0.18) or CD (physical activity, Ptrend=0.42; total energy, Ptrend=0.11). CONCLUSIONS: Obesity as measured by BMI is not associated with the development of incident UC or CD. Alternative measures of obesity are required to further investigate the role of obesity in the development of incident IBD.},

   abstract = {BACKGROUND: Diet may have a role in the etiology of inflammatory bowel disease. In previous studies, the associations between increased intakes of carbohydrates, sugar, starch, and inflammatory bowel disease are inconsistent. However, few prospective studies have investigated the associations between these macronutrients and incident Crohn's disease (CD) or ulcerative colitis (UC). METHODS: A total of 401,326 men and women were recruited between 1991 and 1998. At recruitment, dietary intakes of carbohydrate, sugar, and starch were measured using validated food frequency questionnaires. The cohort was monitored identifying participants who developed incident CD or UC. Cases were matched with 4 controls, and odds ratios were calculated for quintiles of total carbohydrate, sugar, and starch intakes adjusted for total energy intake, body mass index, and smoking. RESULTS: One hundred ten participants developed CD, and 244 participants developed UC during follow-up. The adjusted odds ratio for the highest versus the lowest quintiles of total carbohydrate intake for CD was 0.87, 95% CI = 0.24 to 3.12 and for UC 1.46, 95% CI = 0.62 to 3.46, with no significant trends across quintiles for either (CD, P trend = 0.70; UC, P trend = 0.41). Similarly, no associations were observed with intakes of total sugar (CD, P trend = 0.50; UC, P trend = 0.71) or starch (CD, P trend = 0.69; UC, P trend = 0.17). CONCLUSIONS: The lack of associations with these nutrients is in agreement with many case-control studies that have not identified associations with CD or UC. As there is biological plausibility for how specific carbohydrates could have an etiological role in inflammatory bowel disease, future epidemiological work should assess individual carbohydrates, although there does not seem to be a macronutrient effect.},

   abstract = {Ulcerative colitis (UC) is a leading form of inflammatory bowel disease that involves chronic relapsing or progressive inflammation. As a significant proportion of UC patients treated with conventional therapies do not achieve remission, there is a pressing need for the development of more effective therapies. The human gut contains a large, diverse, and dynamic population of microorganisms, collectively referred to as the enteric microbiota. There is a symbiotic relationship between the human host and the enteric microbiota, which provides nutrition, protection against pathogenic organisms, and promotes immune homeostasis. An imbalance of the normal enteric microbiota composition (termed dysbiosis) underlies the pathogenesis of UC. A reduction of enteric microbiota diversity has been observed in UC patients, mainly affecting the butyrate-producing bacteria, such as Faecalibacterium prausnitzii, which can repress pro-inflammatory cytokines. Many studies have shown that enteric microbiota plays an important role in anti-inflammatory and immunoregulatory activities, which can benefit UC patients. Therefore, manipulation of the dysbiosis is an attractive approach for UC therapy. Various therapies targeting a restoration of the enteric microbiota have shown efficacy in treating patients with active and chronic forms of UC. Such therapies include fecal microbiota transplantation, probiotics, prebiotics, antibiotics, helminth therapy, and dietary polyphenols, all of which can alter the abundance and composition of the enteric microbiota. Although there have been many large, randomized controlled clinical trials assessing these treatments, the effectiveness and safety of these bacteria-driven therapies need further evaluation. This review focuses on the important role that the enteric microbiota plays in maintaining intestinal homeostasis and discusses new therapeutic strategies targeting the enteric microbiota for UC.},

Here, we report an unusual case of an 8-year-old child with a history of anemia and failure to thrive who presented with bloody diarrhea. His evaluation showed anemia, elevated inflammatory markers, and positive celiac antibodies. Endoscopic evaluation revealed partial duodenal villous atrophy and pancolitis. He was diagnosed with celiac disease and UC and responded well to a gluten-free diet and steroid/mesalamine therapy. The patient's genetic testing revealed markers showing susceptibility for both celiac disease and UC. It is important to be aware of this association as both conditions can present with similar clinical features, however, require different therapeutic approaches.},

   abstract = {Intake of saturated fat is a risk factor for ulcerative colitis (UC) and colon cancer. Changes in the microbiota have been implicated in the development of UC and colon cancer. The host and the microbiota generate metabolites that may contribute to or reflect disease pathogenesis. We used lipid class specific quantitative mass spectrometry to assess the phospholipid (PL) profile (phosphatidylcholine [PC], phosphatidylethanolamine [PE], phosphatidylinositol [PI], phosphatidylserine [PS]) of stool from mice fed a high fat (HFD) or control diet with or without induction of colitis-associated tumors using azoxymethane and dextran sodium sulfate. The microbiota was assessed using qPCR for several bacterial groups. Colitis-associated tumors were associated with reduced bulk PI and PE levels in control diet fed mice compared to untreated mice. Significant decreases in the relative quantities of several PC species were found in colitis-associated tumor bearing mice fed either diet. Statistical analysis of the PL profile revealed distinct clustering by treatment group. Partial least squares regression analysis found that the relative quantities of the PS class profile best predicted bacterial abundance of Clostridium leptum and Prevotella groups. Abundance of selected PL species correlated with bacterial group quantities. Thus, we have described that a HFD and colitis-associated tumors are associated with changes in phospholipids and may reflect host-microbial interactions and disease states.},

   abstract = {INTRODUCTION: Dietary fatty acids may be involved in the etiology of ulcerative colitis (UC). Arachidonic acid (AA), an n-6 polyunsaturated fatty acid, is a precursor of the proinflammatory cytokines prostaglandin E2 and leukotriene B4, and its metabolism is competitively inhibited by oleic acid (OA). This study aimed to prospectively investigate whether AA is positively and OA is negatively associated with incident UC development, using data from 7-day food diaries. METHODS: A total of 25 639 men and women, aged between 40 and 79 years, from Norfolk, UK, were recruited into the prospective European Prospective Investigation into Cancer (EPIC)-Norfolk cohort between 1993 and 1997. At baseline, participants completed 7-day food diaries, checked by nutritionists using a database containing 11 000 foods and 55 000 portion sizes. The cohort was monitored until June 2004 to identify participants who developed UC. Each patient was matched for age and sex with four controls, and conditional logistic regression was used to calculate adjusted odds ratios for AA and OA intakes, and UC association. RESULTS: Of the participants, 26 (58% men) developed incident UC (53% left sided) after a median follow-up time of 3.8 years (0.5-8.3 years). The highest AA tertile was positively associated with an odds ratio of 6.09 [95% confidence interval (CI) 1.05-35.23], with a trend across tertiles [odds ratio (OR) 2.43, 95% CI 1.06-5.61, P=0.04]. The highest tertile of OA intake was inversely associated with a 0.03 OR for UC (95% CI 0.002-0.56) and an inverse trend (OR 0.30, 95% CI 0.10-0.90, P=0.03). CONCLUSION: Dietary AA was positively and OA was inversely associated with UC development, with large effect sizes in a dose-dependent manner. This supports roles for measuring these nutrients in future etiological studies and modifying intake in future interventional studies in patients with established disease.},

   abstract = {UNLABELLED: Osteomalacia is a metabolic bone disorder characterized by impaired mineralization of the bone matrix. Vitamin D deficiency due to malabsorption syndromes may cause osteomalacia. This is a case of a patient with a 6-year history of seronegative spondyloarthropathy associated with Crohn's disease who was admitted to our outpatient clinic with symptoms of osteomalacia. INTRODUCTION: Osteomalacia is a metabolic bone disease characterized by an impaired mineralization of the bone matrix, frequently caused by disorders in vitamin D or phosphate metabolism. Vitamin D deficiency due to malabsorption syndromes (e.g., Crohn's disease, ulcerative colitis, celiac disease, and jejuno-ileal bypass for obesity) may cause osteomalacia. CASE REPORT: A 43-year-old male presented with fatigue, low back pain, and morning stiffness. He had a 6-year history of seronegative spondyloarthropathy associated with Crohn's disease. Laboratory findings revealed low serum calcium, low 25-hydroxy vitamin D3, normal phosphorus, elevated parathyroid hormone, and alkaline phosphatase levels. Radiographs revealed grade IV sacroiliitis and Looser zones. He was diagnosed with osteomalacia due to the malabsorption of vitamin D. His symptoms and signs were relieved with supplements of vitamin D and calcium. CONCLUSIONS: Osteomalacia should be considered in differential diagnosis when assessing low back pain in the patients with chronic inflammatory bowel disease. Vitamin D deficiency should be treated with vitamin D supplementation in patients with Crohn's disease to prevent osteomalacia.},

METHODS: Focus groups and one-on-one interviews were undertaken in adult patients with IBD. Transcripts from the focus groups and interviews were analyzed to identify themes and links between themes, assisted by qualitative data software MaxQDA. Themes from the qualitative research were supplemented with those reported in the literature and concepts included in IBD-specific patient-reported outcome measures. RESULTS: Twenty-seven patients participated. Key physical symptoms included pain, bowel-related symptoms such as frequency, urgency, incontinence, diarrhea, passing blood, and systemic symptoms such as weight loss and fatigue. Participants described continuing and variable symptom experiences. IBD symptoms caused immediate disruption of activities but also had ongoing impacts on daily activities, including dietary restrictions, lifestyle changes, and maintaining close proximity to a toilet. More distal impacts included interference with work, school, parenting, social and leisure activities, relationships, and psychological well-being. The inconvenience of rectal medications, refrigerated biologics, and medication refills emerged as novel burdens not identified in existing patient-reported outcome measures. CONCLUSIONS: IBD symptoms cause immediate disruption in activities, but patients may continue to experience some symptoms on a chronic basis. The conceptual model presented here may be useful for identifying target concepts for measurement in future studies in IBD.},

   abstract = {Due to the intestinal inflammation, tissue damage, and painful abdominal symptoms restricting dietary intake associated with both diseases, patients with intestinal pelvic radiation disease (PRD) or inflammatory bowel disease (IBD) are at increased risk to develop protein calorie malnutrition and micronutrient deficiencies. In the current paper, we review the nutritional management of both diseases, listing the similar approaches of nutritional management and the nutritional implications of intestinal dysfunction of both diseases. Malnutrition is prevalent in patients with either disease and nutritional risk screening and assessment of nutritional status are required for designing the proper nutritional intervention plan. This plan may include dietary management, oral nutritional supplementation, and enteral and/or parenteral nutrition. In addition to managing malnutrition, nutrients exert immune modulating effects during periods of intestinal inflammation and can play a role in mitigating the risks associated with the disease activity. Consistently, exclusive enteral feeding is recommended for inducing remission in pediatric patients with active Crohn's disease, with less clear guidelines on use in patients with ulcerative colitis. The field of immune modulating nutrition is an evolving science that takes into consideration the specific mechanism of action of nutrients, nutrient-nutrient interaction, and preexisting nutritional status of the patients.},

   abstract = {BACKGROUND AND AIMS: Clinical management of inflammatory bowel diseases (IBD), new treatment modalities and the potential impact of personalised medicine remain topics of intense interest as our understanding of the pathophysiology of IBD expands. METHODS: Potential future strategies for IBD management are discussed, based on recent preclinical and clinical research. RESULTS: A top-down approach to medical therapy is increasingly being adopted for patients with risk factors for severe inflammation or an unfavourable disease course in an attempt to halt the inflammatory process as early as possible, prevent complications and induce mucosal healing. In the future, biological therapies for IBD are likely to be used more selectively based on personalised benefit/risk assessment, determined through reliable biomarkers and tissue signatures, and will probably be optimised throughout the course of treatment. Biologics with different mechanisms of action will be available; when one drug fails, patients will be able to switch to another and even combination biologics may become a reality. The role of biotherapeutic products that are similar to currently licensed biologics in terms of quality, safety and efficacy - i.e. biosimilars - is at an early stage and requires further experience. Other therapeutic strategies may involve manipulation of the microbiome using antibiotics, probiotics, prebiotics, diet and combinations of all these approaches. Faecal microbiota transplantation is also a potential option in IBD although controlled data are lacking. CONCLUSIONS: The future of classifying, prognosticating and managing IBD involves an outcomes-based approach to identify biomarkers reflecting various biological processes that can be matched with clinically important endpoints.},

   abstract = {BACKGROUND: Poor bowel control is a major concern of people with inflammatory bowel disease (IBD). Previous research demonstrates the impact of fecal incontinence (FI) on adults in the non-IBD population; there are no previous reports on the experience of IBD-related FI. METHODS: We randomly sampled 10,000 members of Crohn's & Colitis UK to receive a questionnaire to collect demographic information, medical history, continence status, quality of life, and free-text responses to questions about FI. Respondents could also choose to be interviewed about their experiences of living with IBD-related FI. This article presents findings from the free-text paper questionnaire responses and the interviews. Following transcription, data were sorted and analyzed using a pragmatic thematic approach. RESULTS: We received 3264 eligible replies (32.6%). Twenty-eight interviews and 583 sets of questionnaire data were transcribed, continuing with the latter until no new themes emerged. The remaining questionnaires (n = 2681) were read to check that no issues had been missed. Several core themes emerged: emotional and psychological impact, feelings of stigma, limited lives, symptoms, practical coping mechanisms, access to facilities, and fear of incontinence. DISCUSSION: Incontinence, and fear of it, limits social, working, and personal lives, impacting on people with IBD in complex ways. Key strategies, including situation avoidance and dietary restrictions, are used to cope. Incontinence is degrading and humiliating for most people, although a small number approach their situation positively. CONCLUSIONS: IBD-related FI, and fear of incontinence, causes multiple difficulties. People with IBD-related FI need help in accessing professional support.},

   abstract = {Intestinal alkaline phosphatase (IAP) plays an essential role in intestinal homeostasis and health through interactions with the resident microbiota, diet and the gut. IAP's role in the intestine is to dephosphorylate toxic microbial ligands such as lipopolysaccharides, unmethylated cytosine-guanosine dinucleotides and flagellin as well as extracellular nucleotides such as uridine diphosphate. IAP's ability to detoxify these ligands is essential in protecting the host from sepsis during acute inflammation and chronic inflammatory conditions such as inflammatory bowel disease. Also important in these complications is IAP's ability to regulate the microbial ecosystem by forming a complex relationship between microbiota, diet and the intestinal mucosal surface. Evidence reveals that diet alters IAP expression and activity and this in turn can influence the gut microbiota and homeostasis. IAP's ability to maintain a healthy gastrointestinal tract has accelerated research on its potential use as a therapeutic agent against a multitude of diseases. Exogenous IAP has been shown to have beneficial effects when administered during ulcerative colitis, coronary bypass surgery and sepsis. There are currently a handful of human clinical trials underway investigating the effects of exogenous IAP during sepsis, rheumatoid arthritis and heart surgery. In light of these findings IAP has been marked as a novel agent to help treat a variety of other inflammatory and infectious diseases. The purpose of this review is to highlight the essential characteristics of IAP in protection and maintenance of intestinal homeostasis while addressing the intricate interplay between IAP, diet, microbiota and the intestinal epithelium.},

   abstract = {OBJECTIVES: This study reviewed previous studies to explore the global patterns of seasonal variation in gastrointestinal diseases. STUDY DESIGN AND METHODS: A series of systematic literature reviews were undertaken to identify studies reporting seasonal and monthly data on clinical onset or relapse of gastrointestinal diseases (Acute pancreatitis, inflammatory bowel disease, Peptic ulcer diseases (PUD), gastroesophageal reflux disease, colon cancer and colonic diverticulitis). Thirty-two primary studies (published 1970-2012) from 17 countries were identified. RESULTS: Upon review of the evidence, it appears that the seasonal peaks of PUD are most prominent in colder months while the peak of incidence rate of Crohn diseases in most of the countries subjects were found during the spring and summer seasons. Seasonal trend in the onset of acute pancreatitis exhibits a summer peak in some countries. There were no clearly seasonal peaks noted for the ulcerative colitis. CONCLUSIONS: Future experimental and observational studies should consider how the environmental factors (infection, cold, air pollution etc.) or other triggers (dietary habit, alcohol consumption) promotes or hinders such diseases.},

Both types of inflammatory bowel disease have a complex etiology, resulting from a genetically determined susceptibility interacting with environmental factors, including the diet and gut microbiota. Genome Wide Association Studies have implicated more than 160 single-nucleotide polymorphisms in disease susceptibility. Consideration of the different pathways suggested to be involved implies that specific dietary interventions are likely to be appropriate, dependent upon the nature of the genes involved. Epigenetics and the gut microbiota are also responsive to dietary interventions. Nutrigenetics may lead to personalized nutrition for disease prevention and treatment, while nutrigenomics may help to understand the nature of the disease and individual response to nutrients.},

In genetically susceptible individuals, the interaction between environmental factors and normal intestinal commensal flora is believed to lead to an inappropriate immune response that results in chronic inflammation. The incidence of IBD have increased in the past century in developed and developing countries. The purpose of the present review is to summarize the current knowledge of the association between environmental risk factors and IBD. A number of environmental risk factors were investigated including smoking, hygiene, microorganisms, oral contraceptives, antibiotics, diet, breastfeeding, geographical factors, pollution and stress. Inconsistent findings among the studies highlight the complex pathogenesis of IBD. Additional studies are necessary to identify and elucidate the role of environmental factors in IBD etiology.},

   abstract = {This is a consensus of the Austrian working group of IBD (inflammatory bowel diseases) of the OGGH on nutrition in IBD. Malnutrition should be assessed in case of IBD (in 20 - 70 % of Crohn's patients) and weight loss(> 5 % within 3 months) or nutritional deficiencies or after extensive bowel resection and afterwards also treated. Malnutrition should be treated with medical therapy of IBD and also adequate - as far as possible - with oral nutritional therapy particularly because of reduced life quality, risk of opportunistic infections, osteopenia/osteoporosis, longer hospitalisations and higher mortality. Iron homeostasis, serum levels of Vitamin B12- and folic acid, 25-hydroxyvitamin D and zinc should be checked. Therapy with enteral liquid diets is only indicated as therapy of first choice in children and adolescents, but only in rare situations in adults with IBD. There is - up to now - no proven oral diet for maintenance of remission in IBD. Probiotics as E. coli Nissle could be used as alternative to mesalazine for maintenance of remission in patients with ulcerative colitis. A specific dietary counselling is mandatory in patients with ileostoma or short bowel syndrome. Malnutrition of short bowel patients is particularly dependent on the function and length of the remaining bowel, therefore the most effective medical therapy should be administered.},

However, the effects of probiotics on the induction and maintenance of remission in ulcerative colitis (UC) or Crohn's disease (CD) still remain controversial. This systematic review verified the findings of high-quality randomized controlled trials (RCTs) which investigated the therapeutic effects of probiotics on IBD. After the quality assessment, 20 RCTs which investigated the effects of probiotics on the induction or maintenance of remission in IBD were identified. From the results of the validation of these RCTs, beneficial effects of probiotic treatments to improve the response rate and remission rate on the remission induction therapies [risk ratio (RR) 1.81; 95 % confidence interval (CI) 1.40-2.35 and RR 1.56; 95 % CI 0.95-2.56, respectively] were verified. Furthermore, probiotic treatments exhibited effects equal to mesalazine on the maintenance of remission in UC (RR 1.00; 95 % CI 0.79-1.26). In contrast, no significant effect of probiotic treatments was shown in either the induction or maintenance of remission in CD. Because there were many variations in the conditions among these studies, a further analysis evaluating the effects of probiotic treatments in IBD is needed to clarify the optimal probiotics and treatment regimens for each condition or population in IBD patients.},

   abstract = {The epithelium of the gastrointestinal tract is one of the most versatile tissues in the organism, responsible for providing a tight barrier between dietary and bacterial antigens and the mucosal and systemic immune system while maintaining efficient digestive and absorptive processes to ensure adequate nutrient and energy supply. Inflammatory bowel diseases (Crohn's disease and ulcerative colitis) are associated with a breakdown of both functions, which in some cases are clearly interrelated. In this updated literature review, we focus on the effects of intestinal inflammation and the associated immune mediators on selected aspects of the transepithelial transport of macronutrients and micronutrients. The mechanisms responsible for nutritional deficiencies are not always clear and could be related to decreased intake, malabsorption, and excess losses. We summarize the known causes of nutrient deficiencies and the mechanism of inflammatory bowel disease-associated diarrhea. We also overview the consequences of impaired epithelial transport, which infrequently transcend its primary purpose to affect the gut microbial ecology and epithelial integrity. Although some of those regulatory mechanisms are relatively well established, more work needs to be done to determine how inflammatory cytokines can alter the transport process of nutrients across the gastrointestinal and renal epithelia.},

   abstract = {Clinically, excessive omega-6 polyunsaturated fatty acid (PUFA) and inadequate omega-3 PUFA have been associated with enhanced risks for developing ulcerative colitis. In rodent models, omega-3 PUFAs have been shown to either attenuate or exacerbate colitis in different studies. We hypothesized that a high omega-6: omega-3 PUFA ratio would increase colitis susceptibility through the microbe-immunity nexus. To address this, we fed post-weaned mice diets rich in omega-6 PUFA (corn oil) and diets supplemented with omega-3 PUFA (corn oil+fish oil) for 5 weeks. We evaluated the intestinal microbiota, induced colitis with Citrobacter rodentium and followed disease progression. We found that omega-6 PUFA enriched the microbiota with Enterobacteriaceae, Segmented Filamentous Bacteria and Clostridia spp., all known to induce inflammation. During infection-induced colitis, omega-6 PUFA fed mice had exacerbated intestinal damage, immune cell infiltration, prostaglandin E2 expression and C. rodentium translocation across the intestinal mucosae. Addition of omega-3 PUFA on a high omega-6 PUFA diet, reversed inflammatory-inducing microbial blooms and enriched beneficial microbes like Lactobacillus and Bifidobacteria, reduced immune cell infiltration and impaired cytokine/chemokine induction during infection. While, omega-3 PUFA supplementation protected against severe colitis, these mice suffered greater mortality associated with sepsis-related serum factors such as LPS binding protein, IL-15 and TNF-alpha. These mice also demonstrated decreased expression of intestinal alkaline phosphatase and an inability to dephosphorylate LPS. Thus, the colonic microbiota is altered differentially through varying PUFA composition, conferring altered susceptibility to colitis. Overall, omega-6 PUFA enriches pro-inflammatory microbes and augments colitis; but prevents infection-induced systemic inflammation. In contrast, omega-3 PUFA supplementation reverses the effects of the omega-6 PUFA diet but impairs infection-induced responses resulting in sepsis. We conclude that as an anti-inflammatory agent, omega-3 PUFA supplementation during infection may prove detrimental when host inflammatory responses are critical for survival.},

Animals were exposed to four repeated cycles of dextran sodium sulfate in drinking water followed by a 7-day rest period. Animals receiving a standard diet supplemented with 0.25% of 1 (equivalent to 500 mg/kg/day) for 56 days exhibited a decrease of inflammatory symptoms, as reflected by improvement of disease activity index and histopathological changes. It was found that 1 decreased inflammatory cell recruitment and the release of inflammatory cytokines interleukin (IL)-1beta and IL-6 with increased IL-10 levels in colon tissue. Colon expression of cyclooxygenase-2 and inducible nitric oxide synthase was reduced significantly by 1. The anti-inflammatory molecular mechanism of 1 was associated with the suppression of the phosphorylation of p38 mitogen-activated protein kinase and might be mediated by up-regulation of annexin A1. In addition, 1 ameliorated intestinal wound healing in IEC-18 monolayers. Therefore, oleuropein seems to be a promising active molecule in experimental ulcerative colitis.},

   abstract = {Mucosal surfaces of the lower gastrointestinal tract are subject to frequent, pronounced fluctuations in oxygen tension, particularly during inflammation. Adaptive responses to hypoxia are orchestrated largely by the hypoxia-inducible transcription factors (HIFs). As HIF-1alpha and HIF-2alpha are coexpressed in mucosal epithelia that constitute the barrier between the lumen and the underlying immune milieu, we sought to define the discrete contribution of HIF-1 and HIF-2 transactivation pathways to intestinal epithelial cell homeostasis. The present study identifies creatine kinases (CKs), key metabolic enzymes for rapid ATP generation via the phosphocreatine-creatine kinase (PCr/CK) system, as a unique gene family that is coordinately regulated by HIF. Cytosolic CKs are expressed in a HIF-2-dependent manner in vitro and localize to apical intestinal epithelial cell adherens junctions, where they are critical for junction assembly and epithelial integrity. Supplementation with dietary creatine markedly ameliorated both disease severity and inflammatory responses in colitis models. Further, enzymes of the PCr/CK metabolic shuttle demonstrate dysregulated mucosal expression in a subset of ulcerative colitis and Crohn disease patients. These findings establish a role for HIF-regulated CK in epithelial homeostasis and reveal a fundamental link between cellular bioenergetics and mucosal barrier.},

Male Wistar rats, divided into five groups, were included in a 4-week dietary intervention study.

The diets were: (1) control, (2) control + DSS, (3) FO (5 %) + DSS, (4) FP (3.5 %) + DSS, (5) FO + FP + DSS. Following DSS intake, weight and disease activity index (DAI) were assessed, and histological combined score (HCS), selected colonic PG, cytokines, oxidative damage markers and mRNA levels were measured. FP reduced HCS, tended to lower DAI (P = 0.07) and reduced keratinocyte chemoattractant/growth-regulated oncogene levels, as compared with the FO diet. FP also reduced mRNA levels of Il-6 and Cxcl1, although not significantly. FO intake increased the DAI as compared with DSS alone. PGE3 levels increased after the FO diet, and even more following FO + FP intake. The FP diet seems to have a protective effect in DSS-induced colitis as compared with FO. A number of beneficial, but non-significant, changes also occurred after FP v. DSS. A combined FO + FP diet may influence PG synthesis, as PGE3 levels were higher after the combined diet than after FO alone.},

   abstract = {BACKGROUND & AIMS: In most cases celiac disease (CD) is successfully treated with a gluten-free diet (GFD). However, some patients become refractory to the GFD. Refractory CD (RCD) patients have an increased risk for developing enteropathy associated T-cell lymphoma and early diagnosis is therefore of importance. Currently, RCD diagnosis relies on endoscopy and adequate serological markers are lacking. Antibodies against glycoprotein-2 (GP2A) were described in Crohn's disease (CrD) and active CD but not in ulcerative colitis (UC), suggesting this is a specific marker for small intestinal lesions. METHODS: Sera obtained from patients visiting our outpatient clinic for routine serological tests for diagnosis and/or follow-up of inflammatory bowel disease (n=78), active CD (n=45), GFD (n=34) and RCD (n=15) were analysed for GP2A titres. RESULTS: Increased GP2A-IgA levels in CrD and active CD as compared to controls (p<0.001) and lack thereof in UC was confirmed. However, we could not confirm the association with small bowel localization within the CrD patient group. Within CD patients, we demonstrated a significant decrease of GP2A-IgA titres upon a GFD and increased levels in RCD patients as compared to patients on a GFD. Although GP2A-IgA was not associated with the degree of villous atrophy, GP2A-IgA levels were able to distinguish RCD patients from GFD patients (ROC AUC=0.79, p=0.002). CONCLUSION: Follow-up of GP2A-IgA titres in CD patients on a GFD may help to identify patients at risk for developing RCD.},

   abstract = {BACKGROUND: 25(OH) vitamin D levels may be low in patients with moderately or severely active inflammatory bowel diseases (IBD: Crohn's disease and Idiopathic Ulcerative Colitis) but this is less clear in patients with mild or inactive IBD. Furthermore there is limited information of any family influence on 25(OH) vitamin D levels in IBD. As a possible risk factor we hypothesize that vitamin D levels may also be low in families of IBD patients. OBJECTIVES: To evaluate 25[OH] vitamin D levels in patients with IBD in remission or with mild activity. A second objective is to evaluate whether there are relationships within IBD family units of 25[OH] vitamin D and what are the influences associated with these levels. METHODS: Participants underwent medical history, physical examination and a 114 item diet questionnaire. Serum 25[OH] vitamin D was measured, using a radioimmunoassay kit, (replete >/= 75, insufficient 50-74, deficient < 25-50, or severely deficient < 25 nmol/L). Associations between 25[OH] vitamin D and twenty variables were evaluated using univariate regression. Multivariable analysis was also applied and intrafamilial dynamics were assessed. RESULTS: 55 patients and 48 controls with their respective families participated (N206). 25[OH] vitamin D levels between patients and controls were similar (71.2 +/- 32.8 vs. 68.3 +/-26.2 nmol/L). Vitamin D supplements significantly increased intake but correlation with serum 25[OH] vitamin D was significant only during non sunny months among patients. Within family units, patients' families had mean replete levels (82.3 +/- 34.2 nmol/L) and a modest correlation emerged during sunny months between patients and family (r2 =0.209 p = 0.032). These relationships were less robust and non significant in controls and their families. CONCLUSIONS: In patients with mild or inactive IBD 25[OH] vitamin D levels are less than ideal but are similar to controls. Taken together collectively, the results of this study suggest that patient family dynamics may be different in IBD units from that in control family units. However contrary to the hypothesis, intra familial vitamin D dynamics do not pose additional risks for development of IBD.},

   abstract = {SCOPE: Ulcerative colitis (UC) is a chronic inflammatory disease of the colon. alpha-Mangostin (alpha-MG), the most abundant xanthone in mangosteen fruit, exerts anti-inflammatory and antibacterial activities in vitro. We evaluated the impact of dietary alpha-MG on murine experimental colitis and on the gut microbiota of healthy mice. METHODS AND RESULTS: Colitis was induced in C57BL/6J mice by administration of dextran sulfate sodium (DSS). Mice were fed control diet or diet with alpha-MG (0.1%). alpha-MG exacerbated the pathology of DSS-induced colitis. Mice fed diet with alpha-MG had greater colonic inflammation and injury, as well as greater infiltration of CD3(+) and F4/80(+) cells, and colonic myeloperoxidase, than controls. Serum levels of granulocyte colony-stimulating factor, IL-6, and serum amyloid A were also greater in alpha-MG-fed animals than in controls. The colonic and cecal microbiota of healthy mice fed alpha-MG but no DSS shifted to an increased abundance of Proteobacteria and decreased abundance of Firmicutes and Bacteroidetes, a profile similar to that found in human UC. CONCLUSION: alpha-MG exacerbated colonic pathology during DSS-induced colitis. These effects may be associated with an induction of intestinal dysbiosis by alpha-MG. Our results suggest that the use of alpha-MG-containing supplements by patients with UC may have unintentional risk.},

   abstract = {Inflammatory bowel disease (IBD) is a chronic and relapsing inflammatory condition of the gastrointestinal tract. The two main forms of IBD are Crohn's disease and ulcerative colitis. According to the recent concept the disease is caused by a combination of factors, including genetics, immune dysregulation, barrier dysfunction and the change in microbial flora. Environmental factors, such as changes in diet, antibiotic use, smoking or improved domestic hygiene (e.g. eradication of intestinal helminths) probably contribute to the development and increased prevalence of IBD. Dysregulation of mucosal immunity in IBD causes an overproduction of inflammatory cytokines which resulted in uncontrolled intestinal inflammation. Based on extensive research over the last decade, besides the conventional therapy, there are several novel pathways and specific targets, on which focus new therapeutics. New therapeutics aim 1./ to correct genetic susceptibility by stimulating NOD2 expression, TLR3 signaling or inhibition of TLR4 pathway, 2./ to restore the immune dysregulation by inhibition of pro-inflammatory cytokines (TNF-alpha, IL-6, IL-13, IL-17, IL-18, IL-21), Th1 polarisation (IL-2, IL-12, IL-23, IFN-gamma ), T-cell activation, leukocyte adhesion, as well as by immunostimulation (GM-CSF, G-CSF) and anti-inflammatory cytokines (IL-10, IL-11, IFN-beta-1a), 3./ to restore mucosal barrier function and stimulate mucosal healing by different growth factors, such as GH, EGF, KGF, TGF-beta, VEGF, 4./ to restore the normal bacterial flora by antibiotics, probiotics. However, in spite of these numerous potential targets, the true value and clinical significance of most of the new biologics and molecules are not clear yet.},

   abstract = {BACKGROUND: The incidence of inflammatory bowel disease (IBD) has risen rapidly in China over the last 15 years. Increasing numbers of people with IBD require surgery during their lifetime, but few reports of IBD in Eastern populations have been described to date. The aim of this study was to assess the short-term effects of the laparoscopic surgery for IBD in Chinese patients. MATERIALS AND METHODS: From February 2010 to March 2012, 35 patients with IBD underwent laparoscopic operations and the clinical data obtained for these patients were reviewed. RESULTS: Patients with Crohn's disease (CD) (N = 21) and ulcerative colitis (UC) (N = 14) underwent laparoscopic surgery. In the CD group, the mean age was 37.4 years. Two patients (9.5%) required conversion to an open procedure. The median length of postoperative hospitalization was 9 (7-40) days. Overall morbidity was 26.3% and no patients required re-operation. In the UC group, the mean age was 55.2 years. The conversion rate was 14.3% (2/14). The median time to regular diet was 4 (3-10) days and the median length of postoperative hospitalization was 8 (7-25) days. Four patients developed postoperative complications and one patient developed ileostomy retraction requiring urgent operative intervention to rebuild the stoma. CONCLUSIONS: Laparoscopic surgery in patients with IBD can be accomplished safely and with reasonable operative times, conversion rates and morbidity rates. The main advantages of the laparoscopic approach are rapid recovery, improved cosmesis, less postoperative pain, and patient satisfaction.},

   abstract = {Inflammatory bowel diseases (IBD) including ulcerative colitis (UC) and Crohn's disease (CD) are chronic relapsing inflammatory disorders of the gastrointestinal tract. The interaction between a disturbed microbial composition, the intestinal mucosal barrier and the mucosal immune system plays an important role in IBD and its chronicity. It has been indicated that due to the altered microbial composition the balance between T regulatory cells (Treg) and T helper cells (Th) 17 is disturbed, leading to an inflammatory state. The present study shows that oral intake of a specific multi fibre mix (MF), designed to match the fibre content of a healthy diet, counteracts IBD-like intestinal inflammation and weight loss in dextran sodium sulphate treated mice. This reduction in inflammation might be brought about, at least in part, by the MF-induced decrease in inflammatory cytokines, increase in IL-10 and the relative increase in Treg cells in the mesenteric lymph nodes (MLN). Moreover, the Treg percentage in the MLN correlates with the percentage of tolerogenic lamina propria derived CD103+RALDH+dendritic cells in the MLN, suggesting that these play a role in the observed effects. In children with CD exclusive enteral nutrition (EEN) is a widely used safe and effective therapy. Optimizing enteral nutritional concepts with the tested fibre mix, know to modulate the gut microbiota composition, SCFA production and inflammatory status (as indicated by the present study) could possibly further improve efficacy in inducing remission.},

   abstract = {PURPOSE: Restorative proctocolectomy with ileo neo rectal anastomosis (INRA) combines cure of ulcerative colitis (UC) or familial adenomatous polyposis (FAP) with restoration of intestinal continuity. Evaluation of long-term results was needed to determine if there is a place for INRA in the armamentarium of a surgeon besides the ileal pouch anal anastomosis (IPAA). METHODS: All patients with INRA were included in the analysis. Patient demographics and clinical and follow-up data (morbidity, dietary problems, defecation frequency, fecal continence, anal and neorectal physiology, and neorectal mucosa assessment) were registered prospectively. RESULTS: Seventy-nine patients were enrolled, and in 58 patients (50 UC, 8 FAP), INRA was successful. In 21 patients, intraoperative conversion to IPAA was needed. In 49 patients with INRA, a functional reservoir was achieved. No pelvic sepsis or bladder or sexual dysfunction occurred. Thirteen patients experienced episodes of reservoir inflammation. Median bowel movements of six (5, 8) with a nocturnal defecation frequency of one were recorded with fecal continence or minor incontinence. Anal manometry and neorectal physiology showed a decrease in resting pressure and an increase in squeeze pressure and maximum tolerated volume. The median follow-up was 8.1 years (6.7, 10.1). CONCLUSIONS: This is an example of a surgical innovation with a theoretical potential to be superior to the current technique. This potential was not confirmed in short- and long-term evaluations. Hence, IPAA is currently the best available alternative to a conventional ileostomy.},

METHODS: We performed a cross-sectional study using a GFD questionnaire in 1647 patients with inflammatory bowel diseases (IBD) participating in the CCFA Partners longitudinal Internet-based cohort. RESULTS: A diagnosis of celiac disease and non-celiac gluten sensitivity were reported by 10 (0.6%) and 81 (4.9%) respondents, respectively. Three hundred fourteen (19.1%) participants reported having previously tried a GFD and 135 (8.2%) reported current use of GFD. Overall 65.6% of all patients, who attempted a GFD, described an improvement of their gastrointestinal symptoms and 38.3% reported fewer or less severe IBD flares. In patients currently attempting a GFD, excellent adherence was associated with significant improvement of fatigue (P < 0.03). CONCLUSIONS: In this large group of patients with IBD, a substantial number had attempted a GFD, of whom the majority had some form of improvement in gastrointestinal symptoms. Testing a GFD in clinical practice in patients with significant intestinal symptoms, which are not solely explained by the degree of intestinal inflammation, has the potential to be a safe and highly efficient therapeutic approach. Further prospective studies into mechanisms of gluten sensitivity in IBD are warranted.},

A subgroup of the cohort (n = 26) took VD supplements for > 3 mo. Health related quality of life was assessed using the short IBD questionnaire (sIBDQ). VD serum concentration and sIBDQ score were assessed between August and October 2012 (summer/autumn period) and between February and April 2013 (winter/spring period). The mean VD serum concentration and its correlation with disease activity of CD were determined for each season separately. In a subgroup of patients, the effects of VD supplementation on winter VD serum concentration, change in VD serum concentration from summer to winter, and winter sIBDQ score were analyzed. RESULTS: During the summer/autumn and the winter/spring period, 28% and 42% of IBD patients were VD-deficient (< 20 ng/mL), respectively. In the winter/spring period, there was a significant correlation between sIBDQ score and VD serum concentration in UC patients (r = 0.35, P = 0.02), with a trend towards significance in CD patients (r = 0.17, P = 0.06). In the winter/spring period, VD-insufficient patients (< 30 ng/mL) had a significantly lower mean sIBDQ score than VD-sufficient patients; this was true of both UC (48.3 +/- 2.3 vs 56.7 +/- 3.4, P = 0.04) and CD (55.7 +/- 1.25 vs 60.8 +/- 2.14, P = 0.04) patients. In all analyzed scenarios (UC/CD, the summer/autumn period and the winter/spring period), health related quality of life was the highest in patients with VD serum concentrations of 50-59 ng/mL. Supplementation with a median of 800 IU/d VD day did not influence VD serum concentration or the sIBDQ score. CONCLUSION: VD serum concentration correlated with health related quality of life in UC and CD patients during the winter/spring period.},

   abstract = {Patients have strong beliefs about the role of diet in the cause of inflammatory bowel disease (IBD) and in exacerbating or alleviating ongoing symptoms from IBD. The rapid increase in the incidence and prevalence of IBD in recent decades strongly suggests an environmental trigger for IBD, one of which may be dietary patterns. There are several pathways where diet may influence intestinal inflammation, such as direct dietary antigens, altering the gut microbiome, and affecting gastrointestinal permeability. However, data that altering diet can change the natural history of IBD are scarce, and evidence-based dietary guidelines for patients with IBD are lacking. Patients, therefore, seek nonmedical resources for dietary guidance, such as patient support groups and unverified sources on the Internet. The aim of this review is to identify patient-targeted dietary recommendations for IBD and to critically appraise the nutritional value of these recommendations. We review patient-targeted dietary information for IBD from structured Internet searches and popular defined diets. Patient-targeted dietary recommendations focus on food restrictions and are highly conflicting. High-quality dietary intervention studies are needed to facilitate creation of evidence-based dietary guidelines for patients with IBD.},

   abstract = {OBJECTIVES: The base of human Peyer patches of the terminal ileum has been noted to contain black granular pigment deposits, composed of titanium dioxide and aluminosilicate, which are food additives typically present in a Western diet, and pharmaceuticals. In the present study, we investigated the distribution of exogenous pigment throughout the gastrointestinal tract of children suspected of having inflammatory bowel disease (IBD), the correlation between their age and the presence and amount of pigment in Peyer patches, and its relation to pediatric IBD. METHODS: Biopsies (upper and lower gastrointestinal tract) from children suspected of having IBD who underwent endoscopy, were reassessed by a blinded, expert pathologist. The amount of pigment in biopsies was scored using a semiquantitative scale (range 0 to +++). RESULTS: A total of 151 children were included: 62 with Crohn disease (CD), 26 with ulcerative colitis, and 63 with non-IBD. In 63 children (42%), deposits of black pigment were found only in biopsies from the terminal ileum, located in Peyer patches. A significant correlation was found between increasing age and the amount of pigment (P = 0.004). Pigment deposits were found significantly less in the patients with CD compared with those in patients with ulcerative colitis and those with non-IBD (26% vs 62% and 49%, P = 0.002). CONCLUSIONS: These results provide support for the hypothesis that the amount of pigment, only present in Peyer patches in the terminal ileum, becomes denser with increasing age. Absence of pigment in Peyer patches in a higher number of patients with CD suggests that microparticles may have become involved in the inflammatory process, possibly because of disrupted autophagy.},

   abstract = {AIM: To investigate the diet of pouch patients compared to healthy controls, and to correlate pouch patients' diet with disease behavior. METHODS: Pouch patients were recruited and prospectively followed-up at the Comprehensive Pouch Clinic at the Tel Aviv Sourasky Medical Center. Pouch behavior was determined based on clinical, endoscopic and histological criteria. Healthy age- and sex-matched volunteers were selected from the "MABAT" Israeli Nutrition and Public Health Governmental Study and served as the control group. All the participants completed a 106-item food frequency questionnaire categorized into food groups and nutritional values based on those used in the United States Department of Agriculture food pyramid and the Israeli food pyramid. Data on Dietary behavior, food avoidance, the use of nutritional supplements, physical activity, smoking habits, and body-mass index (BMI) were also obtained. Pouch patients who had familial adenomatous polyposis (n = 3), irritable pouch syndrome (n = 4), or patients whose pouch surgery took place less than one year previously (n = 5) were excluded from analysis. RESULTS: The pouch patients (n = 80) consumed significantly more from the bakery products food group (1.2 +/- 1.4 servings/d vs 0.6 +/- 1.1 servings/d, P < 0.05) and as twice as many servings from the oils and fats (4.8 +/- 3.4 servings/d vs 2.4 +/- 2 servings/d, P < 0.05), and the nuts and seeds food group (0.3 +/- 0.6 servings/d vs 0.1 +/- 0.4 servings/d, P < 0.05) compared to the controls (n = 80). The pouch patients consumed significantly more total fat (97.6 +/- 40.5 g/d vs 84.4 +/- 39 g/d, P < 0.05) and fat components [monounsaturated fatty acids (38.4 +/- 16.4 g/d vs 30 +/- 14 g/d, P < 0.001), and saturated fatty acids (30 +/- 15.5 g/d vs 28 +/- 14.1 g/d, P < 0.00)] than the controls. In contrast, the pouch patients consumed significantly fewer carbohydrates (305.5 +/- 141.4 g/d vs 369 +/- 215.2 g/d, P = 0.03), sugars (124 +/- 76.2 g/d vs 157.5 +/- 90.4 g/d, P = 0.01), theobromine (77.8 +/- 100 mg/d vs 236.6 +/- 244.5 mg/d, P < 0.00), retinol (474.4 +/- 337.1 mug/d vs 832.4 +/- 609.6 mug/d, P < 0.001) and dietary fibers (26.2 +/- 15.4 g/d vs 30.7 +/- 14 g/d, P = 0.05) than the controls. Comparisons of the food consumption of the patients without (n = 23) and with pouchitis (n = 45) showed that the former consumed twice as many fruit servings as the latter (3.6 +/- 4.1 servings/d vs 1.8 +/- 1.7 servings/d, respectively, P < 0.05). In addition, the pouchitis patients consumed significantly fewer liposoluble antioxidants, such as cryptoxanthin (399 +/- 485 mug/d vs 890.1 +/- 1296.8 mug/d, P < 0.05) and lycopene (6533.1 +/- 6065.7 mug/d vs 10725.7 +/- 10065.9 mug/d, P < 0.05), and less vitamin A (893.3 +/- 516 mug/d vs 1237.5 +/- 728 mug/d, P < 0.05) and vitamin C (153.3 +/- 130 mg/d vs 285.3 +/- 326.3 mg/d, P < 0.05) than the patients without pouchitis. The mean BMI of the pouchitis patients was significantly lower than the BMI of the patients with a normal pouch: 22.6 +/- 3.2 vs 27 +/- 4.9 (P < 0.001). CONCLUSION: Decreased consumption of antioxidants by patients with pouchitis may expose them to the effects of inflammatory and oxidative stress and contribute to the development of pouchitis.},

   abstract = {BACKGROUND AND AIM: To evaluate presence of sero-negative spondyloarthritis (SpA) in celiac disease (CD) patients, and whether compliance with a gluten free diet (GFD) improved arthritis manifestations in these patients. METHODS: We undertook a prospective, questionnaire based, cross-sectional cohort study to evaluate the presence or absence of SpA simultaneously in both CD and non-CD cohorts. RESULTS: 356/590 (60.3%) patients with CD participated in this study. 99% had diagnosis confirmed by a diagnostic test (79% small bowel biopsy, 19.8% blood test, 3.9% stool test). Approximately 131 (37%) cases of arthritis were reported in CD patients. Of the 6/356 CD patients with seronegative spondyloarthritides, four had sacroiliitis, two ankylosing spondylitis, and one psoriatic arthritis, compared to one ankylosing spondylitis and five psoriatic arthritis in non-CD. Osteoarthritis (89 vs 59, P = 0.93) was the most common diagnosis reported by respondents. More CD patients with diarrhea (94%) and anemia (81%) improved on GFD, compared to arthritis symptoms (30%). Autoimmune thyroiditis (10.6% vs 0.4%), insulin dependent diabetes mellitus (IDDM) (2.2% vs 1.7%), systemic Lupus erythematosus (SLE) (1.1% vs 0), and psoriasis (12.9% vs 5.5%) occurred more frequently in CD patients. The prevalence of Crohn's disease, ulcerative colitis, Sjogren's syndrome, primary biliary cirrhosis, and primary sclerosing cholangitis was around 1% each. Univariate Logistic regression analysis showed </= high school education (odds ratio [OR] 2.01, P < 0.003), age >/= 60 years (OR 4.13, P < 0.001), and osteoporosis (OR 2.78, P < 0.001) to be significantly associated with report of arthritis in CD patients. CONCLUSION: We did not find a high rate of SpA in CD patients. In contrast, increased rates of autoimmune thyroiditis, SLE, IDDM, and psoriasis were seen in CD.},

   abstract = {Carnitine is a vitamin-like compound that plays important roles in fatty acid beta-oxidation and the control of the mitochondrial coenzyme A/acetyl-CoA ratio. However, carnitine is not added to ordinary enteral nutrition or total parenteral nutrition. In this study, we determined the serum carnitine concentrations in subjects receiving ordinary enteral nutrition (EN) or total parenteral nutrition (TPN) and in patients with inflammatory bowel diseases to compare its levels with those of other nutritional markers. Serum samples obtained from 11 EN and 11 TPN patients and 82 healthy controls were examined. In addition, 10 Crohn's disease and 10 ulcerative colitis patients with malnutrition who were barely able to ingest an ordinary diet were also evaluated. Carnitine and its derivatives were quantified using liquid chromatography-tandem mass spectrometry (LC-MS/MS). The carnitine concentrations in EN and TPN subjects were significantly lower compared with those of the control subjects. Neither the serum albumin nor the total cholesterol level was correlated with the carnitine concentration, although a significant positive correlation was found between the serum albumin and total cholesterol levels. Indeed, patients with CD and UC showed significantly reduced serum albumin and/or total cholesterol levels, but their carnitine concentrations remained normal. In conclusion, only a complete blockade of an ordinary diet, such as EN or TPN, caused a reduction in the serum carnitine concentration. Serum carnitine may be an independent biomarker of malnutrition, and its supplementation is needed in EN and TPN subjects even if their serum albumin and total cholesterol levels are normal.},

   abstract = {Conventional medical therapies for ulcerative colitis (UC) are still limited due to the adverse side effects like dose-dependent diarrhoea and insufficient potency to keep in remission for long-term periods. So, new alternatives that provide more effective and safe therapies for ulcerative colitis are constantly being sought. In the present study, probiotic LaBb Dahi was selected for investigation of its therapeutic effect on DSS-induced colitis model in mice. LaBb Dahi was prepared by co-culturing Dahi culture of Lactococci along with selected strain of Lactobacillus acidophilus LaVK2 and Bifidobacterium bifidum BbVK3 in buffalo milk. Four groups of mice (12 each) were fed for 17 d with buffalo milk (normal control), buffalo milk plus DSS (Colitis control), Dahi plus DSS, and LaBb Dahi plus DSS, respectively, with basal diet. The disease activity scores, weight loss, organ weight, colon length, myeloperoxidase (MPO) and beta-glucoronidase activity was assessed, and the histopathological picture of the colon of mice was studied. All colitis control mice evidenced significant increase in MPO, beta-glucoronidase activity and showed high disease activity scores along with histological damage to colonic tissue. Feeding with LaBb Dahi offered significant reduction in MPO activity, beta-glucoronidase activity and improved disease activity scores. We found significant decline in length of colon, organ weight and body weight in colitis induced controls which were improved significantly by feeding LaBb Dahi. The present study suggests that LaBb Dahi can be used as a potential nutraceutical intervention to combat UC related changes and may offer effective adjunctive treatment for management of UC.},

METHODS: IBD patients and randomly selected healthy controls from a well defined geographical area in Denmark were prospectively recruited in the period 1.1.2007-31.12.2009. Data regarding socioeconomic status, area of residence, living conditions, infections and diet were obtained by a questionnaire. RESULTS: A total of 118 IBD patients (59 Crohn's disease (CD), 56 ulcerative colitis (UC) and 3 IBD unclassified (IBDU)) and 477 healthy controls filled out the questionnaire. The response rates were 91% in patients and 45% in controls, respectively. Several risk factors for IBD were identified: IBD in first degree relatives (IBD: OR (odds ratio): 6.1 (95%CI: 2.5-15.0), CD (OR: 6.8 (2.3-20.2)) and UC (OR: 6.1 (2.3-16.0))); bedroom sharing (IBD: OR: 2.1 (1.0-4.3), CD (OR: 3.6 (1.3-9.4))); high sugar intake (IBD: OR: 2.5 (1.0-6.2), CD (OR: 2.9 (1.0-8.5))); prior admission to a hospital for gastrointestinal infections (IBD: 7.7 (3.1-19.1), CD (7.9 (2.5-24.9)) and UC (7.4 (2.5-21.6))); stressful events (IBD: 1.7 (1.0-2.9)). Protective factors were daily vs. less than daily vegetable consumption (CD: 0.3 (0.1-1.0), UC (0.3 (0.1-0.8))) and whole meal bread consumption (IBD: OR: 0.5 (0.3-0.9), CD (0.4 (0.2-0.9))). An increased risk of diagnosis of CD compared to UC was shown for patients living in more urban areas (OR: 1.3 (1.1-1.6)). CONCLUSION: We identified several risk and protective factors for developing IBD. Studies on the influence of environmental factors are important in our understanding of aetiology and phenotypes of paediatric IBD.},

   abstract = {OBJECTIVE: Colonic fermentation in patients with UC in remission was compared with that in matched healthy subjects on habitual diets and when dietary fibre was increased. DESIGN: Fibre intake, faecal output of fibre (measured as non-starch polysaccharide (NSP)), starch, microbiota and fermentation products, and whole gut transit time (WGTT) were assessed in association with habitual diet and when dietary intake of wheat bran (WB)-associated fibre and high amylose-associated resistant starch (RS) was increased in an 8-week, randomised, single-blind, cross-over study. RESULTS: Despite a tendency to lower habitual fibre intake in UC patients, faecal NSP and starch concentrations were threefold higher than in controls, whereas concentrations of phenols and short-chain fatty acids, pH and WGTT were similar. Increasing RS/WB intake was well tolerated. In controls (n=10), it more than doubled faecal NSP and starch excretion (p=0.002 for both), had no effect on NSP usage and reduced WGTT (p=0.024). In UC patients (n=19), high intake of RS/WB tended to normalise gut transit, but did not increase the proportion of NSP fermented. Increasing intake of RS/WB had little effect on faecal fermentation patterns or the structure of the microbiota. However, faeces from the UC cohort had lower proportions of Akkermansia muciniphila and increased diversity within Clostridium cluster XIVa compared to controls. CONCLUSIONS: Gut fermentation of NSP and starch is diminished in patients with UC. This cannot be explained by abnormal gut transit and was not corrected by increasing RS/WB intake, and may be due to abnormal functioning of the gut microbiota.

   abstract = {BACKGROUND: Vitamin D insufficiency has been suggested to be associated with high risk of Crohn's disease (CD). In France, where food fortification is limited, the major source of vitamin D is through sun exposure. The aim of this work was to analyze the relationship between residential sun exposure and the risk of incident CD or ulcerative colitis (UC). METHODS: The E3N cohort consists of women living in France, aged 40 to 65 years and free of major diseases at inclusion in 1990. Among the 91,870 women included in the study, we identified 123 incident cases (45 CD, 71 UC, and 7 indeterminate colitis). To assess residential sun exposure, we used a database containing mean daily ultraviolet radiation (UVR) dose for each French county. The relationship between residential sun exposure and risk of incident inflammatory bowel diseases was explored using Cox models. RESULTS: Higher levels of residential sun exposure were associated with a significant decreased risk of CD (hazard ratio [HR] for the third versus the first tertile of UVR dose, 0.49; 95% confidence interval (CI), 0.23-1.01; P for trend = 0.04), but not of UC (HR, 1.21; CI, 0.61-2.11). In women with available data on dietary vitamin D intake, we observed a lower risk of CD with higher residential UVR (HR, 0.29; 95% CI, 0.11-0.80; P for trend = 0.01). Dietary vitamin D intake was neither associated with the risk of CD (HR, 0.41; 95% CI, 0.14-1.24; P for trend = 0.14) nor UC (HR, 1.61; CI, 0.61-4.23). CONCLUSIONS: In this prospective cohort of women, high residential sunlight exposure was associated with decreased incidence of CD, but not UC.},

   abstract = {OBJECTIVE: Ulcerative colitis is a chronic recurrent disease characterized by acute inflammation of the colonic mucosa. In Japan, a dietary supplementation product enriched with glutamine, dietary fiber, and oligosaccharide (GFO) is widely applied for enteral nutrition support. These three components have been suggested to improve intestinal health. In this study, we investigated whether GFO has suppressive effects on mucosal damage in ulcerative colitis in an experimental mouse model. METHODS: C57BL/6 mice received 2.5% dextran sulfate sodium in drinking water for 5 d to induce colitis. Then, they were given 0.25 mL of GFO or a 20% glucose solution twice daily for 10 d. Another set of mice receiving unaltered drinking water was used as the normal control group. RESULTS: The body weight loss and disease activity index were significantly lower in the GFO-treated mice compared with the glucose-treated mice (P < 0.05). The decrease in colon length induced by dextran sulfate sodium was significantly alleviated in GFO-treated mice compared with glucose-treated mice (P < 0.01). In addition, the histologic findings showed that intestinal inflammation was significantly attenuated in mice treated with GFO. Furthermore, treatment with GFO significantly inhibited the dextran sulfate sodium-induced increase in the mRNA expression of interleukin-1beta. CONCLUSION: These results suggest that GFO has potential therapeutic value as an adjunct therapy for ulcerative colitis.},

This study is a Case - control study, that studied 72 patients with Ulcerative Colitis, after recording history of the disease, colonoscopy and confirmed by biopsy and 72 person without history of colitis. In this study, in order to investigate of food allergy, used of the EUROMMUM kit with an international code number DP3420-1601-11E. We used chi-square and Monte Carlo method for analysis of data. Among UC patients, 30.6% mild, 52.8% moderate and 16.6% of cases were in sever stage. 9.7% of them reported a history of abdominal surgery due to disease. According to the chi-square and Monte Carlo methods, dairy allergy (including: cow milk, cow milk UHT and casein) in UC group was significant (P=0.00). This study indicated that there is significant relationship between UC and cow milk, cow milk UHT and casein. UC patients who are allergic to dairy products and the use of dairy products can increase the severity of UC.},

   abstract = {Inflammatory bowel disease (IBD) is an idiopathic disease thought to be caused by a dysregulated immune response to host intestinal microflora. The role of genetic factors is indicated by familial clustering of cases and higher incidence in monozygotic twins. An interaction between genetic and environmental factors is thought to play a role in the pathogenesis of these disorders. Changes in diet, antibiotic use and intestinal colonization have likely contributed to increased prevalence of inflammatory bowel disease in the past century. Environmental factors or infections are thought to alter the barrier function of the epithelium, leading to loss of immune tolerance to intestinal antigens. This loss of tolerance activates dendritic cells, triggering their transport to mesenteric lymph nodes, where they promote differentiation of naive T cells to TH-1, TH-2, TH-17 cells or T regulatory cells. Production of proinflammatory cytokines and chemokines then follows. Circulating effector and regulatory cells enter the intestine through a highly selective mechanism that involves interaction with the vascular endothelium, diapedesis through the vessel wall and migration to the lamina propria. There are several genes implicated in IBD. Mutations in certain genes can cause defective down regulation of the innate immune response, ineffective clearance of intracellular bacteria and proliferation of both luminal and mucosal-adherent commensal bacteria. IBD is a chronic relapsing inflammatory condition that is immune mediated. Results from research in animal models, human genetics, basic science and clinical trials provide evidence that it is heterogeneous, characterized by various genetic abnormalities, leading to a dysregulated and overly aggressive T cell response to commensal enteric bacteria. Different genetic abnormalities can be characterized as causing defects in mucosal barrier function, immunoregulation or bacterial clearance. Advances in our understanding of the interplay between components of innate and adaptive immune response will be central to future progress.},

   abstract = {The incidence and prevalence of inflammatory bowel diseases (IBDs) including ulcerative colitis and Crohn disease are rapidly increasing in Western countries and in developed Asian countries. Although biologic agents targeting the immune system have been effective in patients with IBD, cessation of treatment leads to relapse in the majority of patients, suggesting that intrinsic immune dysregulation is an effect, not a cause, of IBD. Dramatic changes in the environment, resulting in the dysregulated composition of intestinal microbiota or dysbiosis, may be associated with the fundamental causes of IBD. Japan now has upgraded water supply and sewerage systems, as well as dietary habits and antibiotic overuse that are similar to such features found in developed Western countries. The purpose of this review article was to describe the association of diet, particularly Japanese food and microbiota, with IBD.},

Such effects were investigated using in vitro batch cultures (with/without mucin, peptone or starch) inoculated with faecal slurries from healthy or UC patients; the growth of five bacterial groups was monitored along with short-chain fatty acid (SCFA) production. Healthy cultures gave two-fold higher growth and SCFA levels with up to ten-fold higher butyrate production. Starch gave the highest growth and SCFA production (particularly butyrate), indicating starch-enhanced saccharolytic activity. Sulphate-reducing bacteria (SRB) were the predominant bacterial group (of five examined) for UC inocula whereas they were the minority group for the healthy inocula. Furthermore, SRB growth was stimulated by peptone presumably due to the presence of sulphur-rich amino acids. The results suggest raised SRB levels in UC, which could contribute to the condition through release of toxic sulphide.},

   abstract = {The incidence of colorectal cancer (CRC) is rapidly increasing in developing countries, especially among populations that are adopting Western-style diets. Several, but not all, epidemiological and experimental studies suggest that a high intake of meat, especially red and processed meat, is associated with increased CRC risk. Potential reasons for the association between high red and processed meat intake and CRC risk include the content of the meat (e.g. protein, heme) and compounds generated by the cooking process (e.g. N-nitroso compounds, heterocyclic amines). These factors can affect the large intestine mucosa with genotoxicity and metabolic disturbances. Increased bacterial fermentation (putrefaction) of undigested protein and production of bacterial metabolites derived from amino acids may affect colon epithelial homeostasis and renewal. This correlates with the fact that most colonic cancers are detected in the distal colon and rectum where protein fermentation actively occurs. However, there are still large controversies on the relationship between red meat consumption and CRC risk. Therefore, the purpose of this review is to enhance the current understanding on the association between high red and processed meat intakes with CRC risk. A principal focus of this review will be to discuss the meat-related components, such as proteins in the meat, heme, N-nitroso compounds, and heterocyclic amines, and the effects they have upon the large intestine mucosa and the intestinal gut microbiota.},

   abstract = {BACKGROUND: Colonic neoplasm is associated with western diet intake and physical inactivity. These life styles are also risk factors for dyslipidemia and metabolic syndrome. The aim of this study was to evaluate the association between dyslipidemia and the prevalence of colon polyps including colon adenoma as a precancerous lesion of colonic neoplasms. METHODS: We selected subjects undergoing a colonoscopy for health screening at the Health Promotion Center of Eulji General Hospital from January 2006 to June 2010. Subjects with histories of cancers, dyslipidemia treatment, and other intestinal diseases like Crohn's disease and ulcerative colitis were excluded. The total numbers of subjects included in the study was 605. Chi-square test and t-test and were used for the analysis. Additionally we used multivariate logistic regression to adjust for sex, age, smoking, drinking, and other risk factors. RESULTS: The prevalence of colon polyps was 48.70% and 28.05% in males and females, respectively. When adjusting for variables that included age, body mass index, hypertension, diabetes mellitus, smoking, drinking, and exercise, dyslipidemia was not significantly associated with the prevalence of colon polyps. However upon analyzing adenomatous colon polyps in men, dyslipidemias due to triglycerides and high density lipoproteins were significant factors (odds ratio [OR], 2.13; confidence interval [CI], 1.14 to 3.98; OR, 2.24; CI, 1.15 to 4.34, respectively). CONCLUSION: Dyslipidemia was not a significant factor in the prevalence of colon polyps. However it had a significant association with the prevalence of adenomatous colon polyps in men.},

   abstract = {Dietary inclusion of a bacterial meal has recently been shown to efficiently abolish soybean meal-induced enteritis in Atlantic salmon. The objective of this study was to investigate whether inclusion of this bacterial meal in the diet could abrogate disease development in a murine model of epithelial injury and colitis and thus possibly have therapeutic potential in human inflammatory bowel disease. C57BL/6N mice were fed ad libitum a control diet or an experimental diet containing 254 g/kg of body weight BioProtein, a bacterial meal consisting of Methylococcus capsulatus (Bath), together with the heterogenic bacteria Ralstonia sp., Brevibacillus agri, and Aneurinibacillus sp. At day 8, colitis was induced by 3.5% dextran sulfate sodium (DSS) ad libitum in the drinking water for 6 days. Symptoms of DSS treatment were less profound after prophylactic treatment with the diet containing the BioProtein. Colitis-associated parameters such as reduced body weight, colon shortening, and epithelial damage also showed significant improvement. Levels of acute-phase reactants, proteins whose plasma concentrations increase in response to inflammation, and neutrophil infiltration were reduced. On the other, increased epithelial cell proliferation and enhanced mucin 2 (Muc2) transcription indicated improved integrity of the colonic epithelial layer. BioProtein mainly consists of Methylococcus capsulatus (Bath) (88%). The results that we obtained when using a bacterial meal consisting of M. capsulatus (Bath) were similar to those obtained when using BioProtein in the DSS model. Our results show that a bacterial meal of the noncommensal bacterium M. capsulatus (Bath) has the potential to attenuate DSS-induced colitis in mice by enhancing colonic barrier function, as judged by increased epithelial proliferation and increased Muc2 transcription.},

   abstract = {Stable gastric pentadecapeptide BPC 157 was suggested to link inflammatory bowel disease and multiple sclerosis, and thereby, shown to equally counteract the models of both of those diseases. For colitis, cysteamine (400 mg/kg intrarectally (1 ml/rat)) and colon-colon anastomosis (sacrifice at day 3, 5, 7, and 14) were used. BPC 157 (10 mug/kg, 10 ng/kg) was applied either intraperitoneally once time daily (first application immediately after surgery, last at 24 hours before sacrifice) or per-orally in drinking water (0.16 mug/ml/12 ml/day till the sacrifice) while controls simultaneously received an equivolume of saline (5 ml/kg) intraperitoneally or drinking water only (12 ml/day). A multiple sclerosis suited toxic rat model, cuprizone (compared with standard, a several times higher regimen, 2.5% of diet regimen + 1 g/kg intragastrically/day) was combined with BPC 157 (in drinking water 0.16 mug or 0.16 ng/ml/12 ml/day/rat + 10 mug or 10 ng/kg intragastrically/day) till the sacrifice at day 4. In general, the controls could not heal cysteamine colitis and colon-colon anastomosis. BPC 157 induced an efficient healing of both at the same time. Likewise, cuprizone-controls clearly exhibited an exaggerated and accelerated damaging process; nerve damage appeared in various brain areas, with most prominent damage in corpus callosum, laterodorsal thalamus, nucleus reunions, anterior horn motor neurons. BPC 157-cuprizone rats had consistently less nerve damage in all damaged areas, especially in those areas that otherwise were most affected. Consistently, BPC 157 counteracted cerebellar ataxia and impaired forelimb function. Thereby, this experimental evidence advocates BPC 157 in both inflammatory bowel disease and multiple sclerosis therapy.},

   abstract = {The anti-inflammatory actions of vitamin D have long been recognized and its importance in modulating colon cancer and colitis development is becoming apparent. The vitamin D receptor (VDR) is downregulated in human ulcerative colitis and colitis-associated cancer (CAC); however, its status in murine models of colitis has yet to be explored. Snail and Snail2, zinc-finger transcription factors regulated by inflammatory pathways and able to transcriptionally silence VDR, are upregulated in human Ulcerative Colitis and are associated with localized VDR silencing. To signal, VDR must heterodimerize with retinoid X receptor alpha (RXRalpha). If either VDR or RXRalpha are compromised, vitamin D cannot regulate inflammatory pathways. RXRalpha is downregulated in human colorectal cancer, yet its expression in human and murine colitis has yet to be investigated. To explore the importance of vitamin D and VDR in murine colitis, we used acute and chronic azoxymethane/dextran sulfate sodium models of murine colitis. VDR was downregulated early in the onset of colitis, whereas RXRalpha downregulation only occurred as colitis became chronic and developed into CAC. Receptor downregulation was associated with an early increase in the expression of the inflammatory markers, Snail and Snail2. The acute colitis model induced in combination with a vitamin D-deficient diet resulted in increased morbidity, receptor downregulation, inflammatory marker expression, and Snail and Snail2 upregulation. These experiments show the importance of vitamin D and VDR in modulating murine colitis development.},

   abstract = {Ulcerative colitis (UC) and Crohn's disease (CD) constitute the two major groups of idiopathic disorders in inflammatory bowel disease (IBD). Environmental factors, genetic factors and immune responses have been considered as the major etiology of IBD. Despite the diversified pathogenesis of the disease, no guaranteed curative therapeutic regimen has been developed so far. This review summarizes the knowledge on the pathophysiology and current treatment approaches of IBD. Since IBD is caused by excessive and tissue- disruptive inflammatory reactions of the gut wall, down-regulation of the immune responses may allow the damaged mucosa to heal and reset the physiological functions of the gut back to normal. Current pharmacotherapy through modulation of neutrophil-derived factors, cytokines, adhesion molecules and reactive oxygen/nitrogen metabolites has been utterly described. Categories of treatment modalities include corticosteroids, aminosalicylates, immunomodulators, antibiotics, probiotics, and a series of unique novel agents. The use of anti-tumor necrosis factor monoclonal antibody (Infliximab), recombinant anti-inflammatory cytokines and related gene therapy has been covered. In addition, discussions on dietary supplementation and heparin treatment are also included. The anti-inflammatory and immunoregulatory potential of investigational agents such as nicotine and the filtered protective compounds from tobacco smoke, as well as active herbal medicinal compounds were tested in our previous experimental works, whereas promising findings have been presented here. With the discovery of novel target-oriented agents, more effective and relatively harmless approaches of IBD therapy could be established to achieve a curative outcome. Indeed, more experimental and clinical studies are needed to confirm the relevance of these therapies.},

   abstract = {BACKGROUND: The use of complementary and alternative medicine (CAM) in the general population and in patients with chronic diseases has increased markedly in recent decades. We aimed to determine the prevalence, type, and predictors of oral CAM use among patients with inflammatory bowel disease (IBD) compared with the general population in a large, population-based, case-control study. METHODS: Overall, 1370 patients with IBD and 598 control subjects in Canterbury, New Zealand, were recruited. Environmental and phenotypic data were obtained through a questionnaire and case note review. Predictors of oral CAM use were identified using binary logistic regression. RESULTS: In the previous year, 44.1% of patients with IBD and 42.3% of control subjects used oral CAM (odds ratio [OR], 1.078; 95% confidence interval [CI], 0.885-1.312). The types of oral CAM used most frequently were vitamins (Crohn's disease [CD], 25.2%; ulcerative colitis, 23.7%; control subjects, 24.9%), followed by herbs (CD 15.1%, ulcerative colitis 15.2%, control subjects 12.8%), and dietary supplements (CD, 8.5%; ulcerative colitis 12.6%, control subjects 12.1%). Female gender (OR, 1.61; 95% CI, 1.25-2.08), younger age (P = 0.005), higher education (P = 0.002), higher income (P = 0.04), being a vegetarian (OR, 3.58; 95% CI, 1.97-6.48) and a middle social class at birth (P = 0.024) were independent predictors of oral CAM use in patients with IBD. Disease phenotype was not associated with oral CAM use. In control subjects, female gender (OR, 2.67; 95% CI, 1.85-3.86), higher education (P = 0.003) and a diagnosis of asthma (P = 0.017) predicted oral CAM use. CONCLUSIONS: Oral CAM use is common in, and does not differ between, patients with IBD and the general population in Canterbury, New Zealand. Socio-demographic factors, and not disease phenotype, predict oral CAM use in patients with IBD.},

   abstract = {Colonic diseases like ulcerative colitis, Crohn's disease, and colon cancer are on rise due to variations in the dietary and lifestyle habits. Increase in prevalence of such diseases has augmented the interest of researchers in colon targeted drug delivery systems. Polysaccharide coating has emerged as one of the most successful approaches in this direction. Evaluation of such systems, however, demands an efficient dissolution method in terms of convenience, economy, relevance and reproducibility. It is problematic to mimic the dynamic and ecologically diverse features of the colon. A number of dissolution approaches were tried which include incorporation of polysaccharide-degrading enzymes, rat caecal contents, human faecal slurries, and multi-stage culture systems. Till date, pursuit for cost-effective and animal-sparing colon-specific bio-relevant dissolution media has been a foremost challenge facing pharmaceutical scientists over many decades. This article reviews various dissolution methods adopted to mimic the in vivo performance of dosage forms that are used for colon targeting. It also highlights limitations of the available methods and conditions that should be taken into account while designing a bio-relevant dissolution method for such systems.},

The aim of this study was to assess the clinical efficacy of Profermin. METHODS: Seventy-four patients with a mild-to-moderate flare-up of UC (defined as Simple Clinical Colitis Activity Index [SCCAI] score >/=5 and </=11) were randomly assigned to Profermin (n = 32) or Fresubin (n = 41). The primary endpoint was to assess whether addition of Profermin in UC could significantly reduce SCCAI in comparison with Fresubin. RESULTS: In the run-in period, the mean SCCAI was 7.2 +/- 1.50 in the Profermin group and 7.6 +/- 1.47 in the Fresubin group (not significant). After 8 weeks of treatment, the mean reduction of SCCAI score was higher in the Profermin group (mean difference: -1.77 SCCAI, 95% confidence interval -2.97 to -0.55; P < 0.005), in intention-to-treat analyses. Remission defined as SCCAI </=2.5 was achieved in 10 of 32 (31%) in the Profermin group and in 6 of 41 (15%) in the Fresubin group (P = 0.048). The decrease in SCCAI scores of >/=50% was higher in the Profermin group 17 of 32 (53%) versus 11 of 41 (27%) (P = 0.04). The risk of dropping out due to treatment failure/lack of effect was higher in the Fresubin group (42% versus 13%, P = 0.02). CONCLUSIONS: Supplementation with Profermin is safe, well tolerated, palatable, and able to reduce SCCAI scores at a statistically and clinically significant level in patients with mild-to-moderate UC with a flare-up.},

   abstract = {OBJECTIVE: There is a high prevalence of low bone mineral density (BMD) among patients with inflammatory bowel disease (IBD) although there is a lack of clinical data on the impact of IBD specific medications and recommended vitamin D (VD) and calcium (Ca) supplements on it. DESIGN: The cohort consisted of 150 IBD patients. The average change in BMD at the lumbar spine per year (BMDL/year) was calculated and the impact of clinical characteristics, medications and VD and Ca supplements was analysed. RESULTS: The prevalence of osteopenia was 69/150 (46%) and osteoporosis was identified in 15/150 (10%) patients at baseline. The presence of osteoporosis was associated with the disease duration OR=1.07 per year of disease duration (95% CI=1.01-1.14), p=0.03. The average BMDL/year was 0.010 g/cm(2)/year. Among patients with no IS the BMDL/year was -0.001+/-0.010 g/cm(2)/year, with AZA -0.001+/-0.013 g/cm(2)/year, with anti-TNFalpha 0.003+/-0.006 g/cm(2)/year and with COMBO 0.027+/-0.004 g/cm(2)/year; p<0.05 COMBO vs any other subgroup. BMDL/year among patients treated with CS was -0.031+/-0.012 g/cm(2)/year versus CS free patients 0.013+/-0.004 g/cm(2)/year; p<0.001. There was no effect of VD/Ca supplementation on BMDL. CONCLUSIONS: The prevalence of low BMD was 55%. Duration of disease was the only independent predictor of low BMD. The BMDL was reduced by high cumulative dose of CS and improved by combined anti-TNFalpha/AZA therapy. The supplementation with recommended doses of VD and Ca had no effect on BMDL.},

   abstract = {OBJECTIVES: The impact of food on relapse in ulcerative colitis has not been clearly defined. The aim of this prospective, randomized-controlled study was to evaluate the impact of comprehensive dietary guidelines on the clinical course of the disease and quality of life in patients with ulcerative colitis. MATERIALS AND METHODS: Patients were allocated randomly to an intervention or a control group. Participants in the intervention group were provided dietary guidelines in the form of an educational booklet that was recommended for use for 4-6 weeks during disease flare, that patients eat little and often (four to six times a day), drink adequate fluids, decrease excess intake of fat, decrease simple carbohydrates and decrease high-fibre foods during flare.Validated and study-designed questionnaires were used to compare patients' perceived quality of life, colitis activity scores and eating habits before and following the dietary advice provided. RESULTS: Overall, 112 patients completed the study. Study participants were asked to complete the Inflammatory Bowel Disease Questionnaire and Simple Clinical Colitis Activity Index together with the Food Frequency Questionnaire at 0, 6 and 24 weeks. At 24 weeks, there was a mean reduction in the Simple Clinical Colitis Activity Index score in the intervention group compared with an increase in the score in the control group [-1.304 (P=0.0108) vs. 0.875 (P=0.0249)]. There was a mean increase in the Inflammatory Bowel Disease Questionnaire score in the intervention group compared with a reduction in the score in the control group [7.17 (P=0.126) vs. -3.44 (P=0.205)]. A total of 69% of patients in the intervention group found the dietary advice significantly or moderately helpful. CONCLUSION: The study suggests that there is likely to be a link between the dietary advice provided and symptomatic improvement. The effect of diet may not occur through the addition or the elimination of single nutrients; rather, each food consumed combines many nutrients that allow for a synergistic or an antagonistic action when present in a certain composition.},

   abstract = {OBJECTIVE: We performed a systematic review for Complementary and Alternative Medicine [CAM] as defined by the National Institute of Health in Inflammatory Bowel Disease [IBD], ie Crohn's disease [CD] and ulcerative colitis [UC], with the exception of dietary and nutritional supplements, and manipulative therapies. METHODS: A computerized search of databases [Cochrane Library, Pubmed/Medline, PsychINFO, and Scopus] through March 2014 was performed. We screened the reference sections of original studies and systematic reviews in English language for CAM in IBD, CD and UC. Randomized controlled trials [RCT] and controlled trials [CT] were referred and assessed using the Cochrane risk of bias tool. RESULTS: A total of: 26 RCT and 3 CT for herbal medicine, eg aloe-vera gel, andrographis paniculata, artemisia absinthium, barley foodstuff, boswellia serrata, cannabis, curcumin, evening primrose oil, Myrrhinil intest(R), plantago ovata, silymarin, sophora, tormentil, wheatgrass-juice and wormwood; 1 RCT for trichuris suis ovata; 7 RCT for mind/body interventions such as lifestyle modification, hypnotherapy, relaxation training and mindfulness; and 2 RCT in acupuncture; were found. Risk of bias was quite heterogeneous. Best evidence was found for herbal therapy, ie plantago ovata and curcumin in UC maintenance therapy, wormwood in CD, mind/body therapy and self-intervention in UC, and acupuncture in UC and CD. CONCLUSIONS: Complementary and alternative therapies might be effective for the treatment of inflammatory bowel diseases; however, given the low number of trials and the heterogeneous methodological quality of trials, further in-depth research is necessary.},

   abstract = {The inflammatory bowel diseases, Crohn's and ulcerative colitis, are common and a significant cause of morbidity. They were rare before the 1930's but the incidence has been increasing in both developed and developing countries. We have recently reported that the incidence in Nova Scotia, the area with one of the highest reported burden globally, is decreasing since 1997. We postulate that this decrease may be due to the addition of folate to cereals. This was mandated in 1998 but the process of fortification began in 1997. There is circumstantial evidence from epidemiology studies that a diet deficient in folate may have contributed to the global rise in these diseases. This hypothesis, if proven to be correct, has important implications for the prevention and treatment of these diseases.},

   abstract = {Tributyrin (TBT) is a TAG composed of three butyric acids that has beneficial effects on ulcerative colitis due to its trophic, anti-inflammatory, pro-apoptotic and anti-carcinogenic properties. The goal of the present study was to evaluate the efficacy and mechanisms of action of TBT supplementation in the prevention of mucosal damage in experimental colitis. Mice received either a control diet or a TBT-supplemented diet for 15 d. Colitis was induced by dextran sodium sulphate administration during the last 7 d. Mucosal damage and the activation of immune cells and cytokines were determined by histological score, flow cytometry and ELISA. Leucocyte rolling and adhesion were assessed by intravital microscopy. Oxidative stress was determined by monitoring hydroperoxide concentration and evaluating superoxide dismutase (SOD) and catalase activities. Intestinal permeability was analysed using diethylenetriaminepentaacetate acid (99mTcDTPA). Compared with the colitis group, the animals in the colitis+TBT group had reduced mucosal damage and neutrophil and eosinophil mucosal infiltration, which were associated with a higher percentage of regulatory T cells (Treg) and higher levels of transforming growth factor beta and IL-10 in the lamina propria. The level of in vivo leucocyte adhesion in the colon microvasculature was reduced after TBT supplementation. A lower level of hydroperoxide and higher levels of SOD and catalase activities were associated with TBT supplementation. TBT-supplemented mice showed reduced intestinal permeability to the levels intermediate between the control and colitis groups. In conclusion, the present results show that TBT has positive effects on colonic restructuring in experimental colitis. Additionally, TBT supplementation changes the immune response by controlling inflammation and regulating the expression of anti-inflammatory cytokines and Treg.},

   abstract = {Inflammatory bowel disease (IBD), including Crohn's disease (CD) and ulcerative colitis (UC), are chronic debilitating diseases that occur in populations around the world. The underlying etiology is thought to be multifactorial. There is a well-defined genetic contribution to the diseases, but this does not fully explain the epidemiology. Environmental factors, including the composition of the gut microbiota, are also important. There is wide geographic variability in the incidence and prevalence of IBD. High incidence rates have been observed in the United Kingdom, Northern Europe, Canada, and the United States. Globally, there is evidence of increasing incidence of CD and UC over time. The rising incidence of IBD in Western countries has generally predated that in developing nations, supporting the hypothesis that 'Westernization' of our lifestyle has led to the increased incidence of IBD. Smoking, antibiotic use, and diet are potentially reversible risk factors for IBD. Recommendations to avoid smoking are appropriate for all people, for numerous reasons. Antibiotic use should be limited to appropriate indications, a recommendation that too is appropriate for all populations. Detangling the relationship between diet, the gut microbiome and IBD raises the potential to reduce the incidence of IBD through dietary modification, an approach that might be considered among those at the highest risk.},

IBD has been reported an increased prevalence of low bone mass. The aims of the present study were to evaluate the nutritional status and to investigate the correlation between bone mineral density (BMD) and nutrient factors in patients with IBD. METHODS: A total of 41 subjects were classified into normal group (n=21) and malnourished group (n=20) by the subjective global assessment result. We surveyed the dietary habit, nutrient intake, and BMD. RESULTS: Subjects' average age was 36.7 years old, and included 26 ulcerative colitis and 15 Crohn's disease. The serum C-reactive protein (CRP) was significantly higher and serum calcium was significantly lower in the malnourished group. Lower bone density subjects were more in the malnourished group but no significant difference. Intake of energy, protein, carbohydrate, fiber, iron, sodium, potassium, zinc, vitamin B6, vitamin C and folate were significantly lower in the malnourished group. The BMD of malnourished group showed correlation with triceps skin fold thickness (TSF), CRP, dietary calcium, phosphorous, iron, animal iron, zinc and vitamin. CONCLUSIONS: The results suggested that adequate intake of nutrients is important to prevent bone loss and systemic education programs are need for IBD patients.},

Although CAM often improves patients' well-being, it can also lead to side-effects and interactions with conventional medications. Research on patients with IBD in Sweden who have experiences of CAM is sparse. More studies are needed to enhance awareness of and improve communication about CAM. The aim of this study was to describe experiences of CAM in the healthcare context reported by patients with IBD. METHODS: Fifteen patients with IBD, eight with Crohn's disease (CD) and seven with ulcerative colitis (UC), were recruited. Semi-structured qualitative interviews were conducted and qualitative content analysis was performed. RESULTS: The analysis revealed the theme Knowledge and communication lead to participation in the area of CAM based on three categories; CAM use, Communication and Self-care. Patients with IBD wanted to be asked about CAM to be able to start a dialogue, as some perceived being treated in a disparaging manner and not taken seriously when raising the subject. Healthcare professionals (HCPs) need to be aware of this in order to meet and understand patient needs. Patients with IBD found it easier to communicate about CAM with the IBD nurses than physicians and dietary changes was one important CAM treatment. CONCLUSIONS: The finding that it was easier to discuss CAM with nurses than physicians emphasizes the important role of the IBD nurse in communication and monitoring patients' CAM use. Patients wanted to be asked about CAM to be able to start a dialogue, as some perceived not taken seriously when raising the subject. Furthermore, HCPs need to understand that many patients with IBD regard dietary changes as an important part of CAM treatment. Further research in these areas is needed.},

However, knowledge on trace element alteration in patients who had undergone this surgery is limited. This study was conducted to assess trace element alteration in patients with ulcerative colitis before and after ileal pouch-anal anastomosis. Preoperative (40) and postoperative (35) ulcerative colitis patients were studied. The dietary assessment of trace element intake was undertaken by a semiquantitative food frequency questionnaire. Patients' trace element status of zinc, copper, manganese, selenium, calcium, iron, and vitamin D3 was assessed by measuring their blood concentrations. We found that with the similar dietary intake, there was no statistical difference in the concentrations of plasma copper, iron, calcium, and vitamin D3 in the two groups (P > 0.05). Compared with preoperative patients, postoperative patients had higher concentrations of plasma zinc (14.51 +/- 4.75 mumol/l) and manganese (0.21 +/- 0.11 mumol/l) and lower concentrations of plasma selenium (0.86 +/- 0.58 mumol/l). Both preoperative and postoperative mean concentrations of plasma calcium and vitamin D3 were below their reference range, respectively. We conclude that IPAA does not seem to alter patients' abnormal trace elements completely. It is important to monitor and supply some specified trace elements even in postoperative patients.},

   abstract = {Inflammatory bowel disease (IBD) is a risk factor for the development of colon cancer. Environmental factors including diet and the microflora influence disease outcome. Folate and homocysteine have been associated with IBD-mediated colon cancer but their roles remain unclear. We used a model of chemically induced ulcerative colitis (dextran sodium sulphate (DSS)) with or without the colon carcinogen azoxymethane (AOM) to determine the impact of dietary folic acid (FA) on colonic microflora and the development of colon tumours. Male mice (n 15 per group) were fed a FA-deficient (0 mg/kg), control (2 mg/kg) or FA-supplemented (8 mg/kg) diet for 12 weeks. Folate status was dependent on the diet (P< 0.001) and colitis-induced treatment (P= 0.04) such that mice with colitis had lower circulating folate. FA had a minimal effect on tumour initiation, growth and progression, although FA-containing diets tended to be associated with a higher tumour prevalence in DSS-treated mice (7-20 v. 0%, P= 0.08) and the development of more tumours in the distal colon of AOM-treated mice (13-83% increase, P= 0.09). Folate deficiency was associated with hyperhomocysteinaemia (P< 0.001) but homocysteine negatively correlated with tumour number (r - 0.58, P= 0.02) and load (r - 0.57, P= 0.02). FA had no effect on the intestinal microflora. The present data indicate that FA intake has no or little effect on IBD or IBD-mediated colon cancer in this model and that hyperhomocysteinaemia is a biomarker of dietary status and malabsorption rather than a cause of IBD-mediated colon cancer.},

In an effort to counteract these characteristic perturbations, we used stem cells and/or a probiotic therapy in a murine model of Dextran Sodium Sulfate induced colitis to examine both their efficacy in ameliorating disease and impact on niche-specific microbial communities of the lower GI tract. Colitis was induced in C57BL/6 mice by administering 3% DSS in drinking water for 10 days prior to administering one of three treatment plans: daily probiotic (VSL#3) supplementation for 3 days, a single tail vein injection of 1x10 (6) murine mesenchymal stem cells, or both. Ileal, cecal and colonic sections were collected for microbiota and histological analyses. Microbiota profiling revealed distinct bacterial community compositions in the ileum, cecum and colon of control untreated animals, all of which were predicted in silico to be enriched for a number of discrete KEGG pathways, indicating compositional and functional niche specificity in healthy animals. DSS-treatment perturbed community composition in all three niches with ileal communities exhibiting the greatest change relative to control animals. Each treatment group exhibited treatment-specific alterations in microbiota composition in the lower GI tract, though disease scores were only improved in VSL#3-treated animals. The ileal microbiota were most profoundly altered in composition in this group of animals and characterized by significant Enterobacteriaceae enrichment compared with colitic mice (P<0.05).},

   abstract = {BACKGROUND: The clinical presentation of organic and functional intestinal disorders can overlap and clinicians often rely on invasive and time-consuming procedures to make a final diagnosis. Regenerating islet-derived 3-alpha (Reg3alpha) is detectable in the circulation of patients with intestinal graft-versus host disease and patients with inflammatory bowel disease (IBD). AIM: To determine whether serum Reg3alpha testing is useful for discriminating mucosal enteropathies from functional intestinal disorders. METHODS: We prospectively included 47 patients with active coeliac disease (ACD), 13 patients with refractory coeliac disease (RCD), seven patients with common variable immunodeficiency (CVID), 72 patients with active Crohn's disease, 22 patients with active ulcerative colitis (UC) and 28 patients with irritable bowel syndrome (IBS)-related diarrhoea. Sera were also taken from 10 CD patients before and after 6-12 months of a gluten-free diet (GFD) and from 14 patients with IBD before and after induction therapy with Infliximab (IFX). Sera of 119 healthy volunteers were used to determine the cut-off value. Reg3alpha levels were measured by a commercial ELISA kit. RESULTS: Levels of Reg3alpha exceeded the cut-off value of the assay in 43/47(91%) ACD patients, 13/13(100%) RCD patients, 7/7(100%) CVID patients, 65/72(90%) Crohn's disease patients, 17/22(77%) UC patients and one patient with IBS(4%). Reg3alpha levels distinguished mucosal enteropathies from IBS with a sensitivity of 90% and a specificity of 96%. Reg3alpha levels significantly decreased in CD patients following a GFD and in IBD patients after treatment with IFX. CONCLUSION: Reg3alpha is a serum biomarker of intestinal damage that, combined with clinical data, identifies patients who should undergo invasive tests for diagnosing enteropathies.},

   abstract = {ETHNOPHARMACOLOGICAL RELEVANCE: Pomegranate (Punica granatum L.; Lythraceae) has traditionally been used for the treatment of various inflammatory diseases, including ulcerative colitis (UC). Because its fruits and extracts are rich in ellagitannins, which release ellagic acid when hydrolyzed, consumption of pomegranate products is currently being widely promoted for their potential health effects, including the prevention of inflammatory diseases and cancer. To evaluate the anti-inflammatory effects of ellagic acid on dextran sulfate sodium (DSS)-induced acute and chronic experimental colitis in two different strains of mice and to elucidate its possible mechanisms of action. MATERIALS AND METHODS: In the acute UC model, female Balb/C mice were treated with DSS (5%) for seven days while concomitantly receiving a dietary supplement of ellagic acid (2%). In the chronic UC model, female C57BL/6 mice received four week-long cycles of DSS (1% and 2%) interspersed with week-long recovery periods along with a diet supplemented with ellagic acid (0.5%). RESULTS: In acute model of UC, ellagic acid ameliorated disease severity slightly as observed both macroscopically and through the profile of inflammatory mediators (IL-6, TNF-alpha, and IFN-gamma). In the chronic UC model, ellagic acid significantly inhibited the progression of the disease, reducing intestinal inflammation and decreasing histological scores. Moreover, mediators such as COX-2 and iNOS were downregulated and the signaling pathways p38 MAPK, NF-kappaB, and STAT3 were blocked. CONCLUSIONS: Our study reinforces the hypothetical use of ellagic acid as an anti-inflammatory complement to conventional UC treatment in chronic UC patients and could be considered in the dietary prevention of intestinal inflammation and related cancer development.},

We aimed to review the potential mechanisms behind the antiinflammatory effects of unsaturated fatty acids on intestinal inflammation, to discuss their potential limitations, and to propose a new reappraisal of polyunsaturated fatty acids (PUFAs) in the pathophysiology of inflammatory bowel disease (IBD). A literature search using PubMed was carried out to identify relevant studies (basic science, epidemiological studies, or clinical trials) with unsaturated fatty acids and IBD. Only articles published in English were included. IBD patients exhibit an altered lipid metabolism. While in vitro and in vivo studies have demonstrated the antiinflammatory properties of n-3 polyunsaturated fatty acids in experimental models IBD, results of clinical trials have been disappointing. In addition, the impact of fatty acid on innate immunity as an alternative therapeutic approach is explored. This may offer insight into therapeutic avenues for designing n-3 PUFA diet therapy for IBD.},

   abstract = {INTRODUCTION: The causes of relapse in patients with Crohn's disease (CD) and ulcerative colitis (UC) are largely unknown. This paper reviews the epidemiological and clinical data on how medications (non-steroidal anti-inflammatory drugs, estrogens and antibiotics), lifestyle factors (smoking, psychological stress, diet and air pollution) may precipitate clinical relapses and recurrence. Potential biological mechanisms include: increasing thrombotic tendency, imbalances in prostaglandin synthesis, alterations in the composition of gut microbiota, and mucosal damage causing increased permeability. RESULTS: The clinical epidemiological data consistently reports positive associations between smoking and relapses in CD, and inverse ones with UC. For NSAIDs and estrogens, the epidemiological findings are inconsistent, although general antibiotic use was associated with a reduced risk of relapse in CD. High levels of stress were positively associated with relapse, although psychological interventions did not have therapeutic benefits. The limited work on diet has reported sulphur-containing foods are positively associated with relapse in UC, but there is no work in CD. Ecological data reported positive correlations between air pollution levels and IBD hospitalisations. CONCLUSIONS: In the future, to clarify this area, more clinical epidemiological work is required where detailed drug types and doses, and complete dietary intakes are measured, in specific forms of IBD. Such work could provide guidance to both patients and doctors to help maintain remission.},

   abstract = {Escherichia coli (E. coli), and particularly the adherent invasive E. coli (AIEC) pathotype, has been increasingly implicated in the ethiopathogenesis of Crohn's disease (CD). E. coli strains with similar pathogenic features to AIEC have been associated with other intestinal disorders such as ulcerative colitis, colorectal cancer, and coeliac disease, but AIEC prevalence in these diseases remains largely unexplored. Since AIEC was described one decade ago, substantial progress has been made in deciphering its mechanisms of pathogenicity. However, the molecular bases that characterize the phenotypic properties of this pathotype are still not well resolved. A review of studies focused on E. coli populations in inflammatory bowel disease (IBD) is presented here and we discuss about the putative role of this species on each IBD subtype. Given the relevance of AIEC in CD pathogenesis, we present the latest research findings concerning AIEC host-microbe interactions and pathogenicity. We also review the existing data regarding the prevalence and abundance of AIEC in CD and its association with other intestinal diseases from humans and animals, in order to discuss the AIEC disease- and host-specificity. Finally, we highlight the fact that dietary components frequently found in industrialized countries may enhance AIEC colonization in the gut, which merits further investigation and the implementation of preventative measures.},

   abstract = {The number of inflammatory bowel disease patients has been increasing in Japan and the demand for clinical practical guidelines emerged. A set of clinical practice guidelines for ulcerative colitis and Crohn's disease were thus published in 2006 and 2011, respectively. Their English versions were then published in 2000 and 2012, respectively. These guidelines aim to provide appropriate clinical indicators to Japanese practitioners to improve the outcomes of inflammatory bowel disease patients. The guidelines are based on global literature-based evidence as well as evidence from Japan. The Japanese guidelines were developed based on the existing evidence with integration of the experts' consensus. The criteria for recommendation grade were also determined by the level of evidence as well as by the experts' consensus. It is a distinct feature of the Japanese guidelines to disclose this process explicitly. This recommendation rating is thus useful to fill the gap between evidence and daily clinical practice. Since the Japanese guidelines are primarily based on global literature-based evidence, most of the clinical indicators in them are consistent with those in other guidelines from the Western world. Meanwhile, there are some distinctly different statements in the Japanese guidelines reflecting Japanese standard clinical practice, evidence, and the opinions of Japanese experts.},

   abstract = {BACKGROUND: Treatment resistant chronic pouchitis causes significant morbidity. Elemental diet is effective treatment for Crohn's disease. Since pouchitis shares some similarities to Crohn's disease we hypothesised that elemental diet may be an effective treatment. METHOD: Seven pouchitis patients (with ulcerative colitis) were studied. All had active pouchitis with a pouch disease activity index (PDAI) >/=7. Exclusion criteria were recent NSAIDs, antibiotics or probiotics. Sufficient elemental diet to achieve energy requirements was provided. Flexible-pouchoscopy was performed, and the Cleveland Global Quality of Life score (CGQoL), Pouch Disease Activity Index (PDAI) and BMI were recorded at baseline and following 28 days of elemental diet. Faecal samples were also collected at these time points and analysed for major bacterial groups using culture independent fluorescence in situ hybridisation. Data were analysed using Wilcoxon's signed-rank test. RESULTS: Following 28 days of exclusive elemental diet, median stool frequency decreased from 12 to 6 per day (p=0.028), median clinical PDAI decreased from 4 to 1 (p=0.039). There was no significant difference in quality of life scores or PDAI before and following treatment. There was a trend towards an increase in the concentration of Clostridium coccoides-Eubacterium rectale (median 7.9 to 8.5 log(1)(0)/g, p=0.08) following exclusive elemental diet. CONCLUSION: Treatment with four weeks elemental diet appeared to improve the symptoms of chronic pouchitis in some patients but is not an effective strategy for inducing remission. Although a potential symptom modifier, elemental diet cannot be recommended for the routine treatment of active pouchitis.},

Apricot kernel as a good dietary supplement has shown antioxidant, anti-inflammatory and other pharmacologic properties which suggest that it may be functional as an anticolitis agent. In this study we evaluated the effects of apricot kernel extract and oil on ulcerative colitis in rats. Rats were fasted for 36 h before the experiment. Colitis was induced by intra-rectal instillation of 50 mg/kg trinitrobenzene sulfonic acid in male Wistar rats. Treatments were started 6 h after colitis induction and continued every 24 h for 5 days. Apricot kernel extract (100, 200, 400 mg/kg p.o. and 100, 400 mg/kg i.p.) and apricot kernel extract/oil (100, 200, 400 mg/kg p.o.) were used as experimental treatments and prednisolone (4 mg/kg p.o. or i.p.) was used as reference drug. On the day 6, colon tissue was removed and macroscopic and pathologic parameters were evaluated. Ulcer index and total colitis index as representative of macroscopic and histologic parameters respectively showed ameliorating effects in experimental groups especially those treated by intraperitoneal administration route. Results also demonstrated that oil fraction was not able to potentiate the effects of extract. These data suggest that apricot kernel extracts (with or without oil) can be introduced for further mechanistic and clinical studies as a complementary medicine for inflammatory bowel disorders.},

   abstract = {Inflammatory Bowel Diseases (IBD), including Crohn's Disease and Ulcerative Colitis, have long been associated with a genetic basis, and more recently host immune responses to microbial and environmental agents. Dinitrobenzene sulfonic acid (DNBS)-induced colitis allows one to study the pathogenesis of IBD associated environmental triggers such as stress and diet, the effects of potential therapies, and the mechanisms underlying intestinal inflammation and mucosal injury. In this paper, we investigated the effects of dietary n-3 and n-6 fatty acids on the colonic mucosal inflammatory response to DNBS-induced colitis in rats. All rats were fed identical diets with the exception of different types of fatty acids [safflower oil (SO), canola oil (CO), or fish oil (FO)] for three weeks prior to exposure to intrarectal DNBS. Control rats given intrarectal ethanol continued gaining weight over the 5 day study, whereas, DNBS-treated rats fed lipid diets all lost weight with FO and CO fed rats demonstrating significant weight loss by 48 hr and rats fed SO by 72 hr. Weight gain resumed after 72 hr post DNBS, and by 5 days post DNBS, the FO group had a higher body weight than SO or CO groups. Colonic sections collected 5 days post DNBS-treatment showed focal ulceration, crypt destruction, goblet cell depletion, and mucosal infiltration of both acute and chronic inflammatory cells that differed in severity among diet groups. The SO fed group showed the most severe damage followed by the CO, and FO fed groups that showed the mildest degree of tissue injury. Similarly, colonic myeloperoxidase (MPO) activity, a marker of neutrophil activity was significantly higher in SO followed by CO fed rats, with FO fed rats having significantly lower MPO activity. These results demonstrate the use of DNBS-induced colitis, as outlined in this protocol, to determine the impact of diet in the pathogenesis of IBD.},

The incidence of IBD peaks in young adulthood indicating that pediatric environmental exposures may be important in the etiology of this disease group. We studied the effects of transient dietary cellulose supplementation on dextran sulfate sodium (DSS) colitis susceptibility during the pediatric period in mice. Cellulose supplementation stimulated substantial shifts in the colonic mucosal microbiome. Several bacterial taxa decreased in relative abundance (e.g., Coriobacteriaceae [p = 0.001]), and other taxa increased in abundance (e.g., Peptostreptococcaceae [p = 0.008] and Clostridiaceae [p = 0.048]). Some of these shifts persisted for 10 days following the cessation of cellulose supplementation. The changes in the gut microbiome were associated with transient trophic and anticolitic effects 10 days following the cessation of a cellulose-enriched diet, but these changes diminished by 40 days following reversal to a low cellulose diet. These findings emphasize the transient protective effect of dietary cellulose in the mammalian large bowel and highlight the potential role of dietary fibers in amelioration of intestinal inflammation.},

   abstract = {OBJECTIVES: Multiple characteristics of industrialization have been proposed to contribute to the global emergence of inflammatory bowel diseases (IBDs: Crohn disease and ulcerative colitis). Major changes in eating habits during the last decades and the effectiveness of exclusive enteral nutrition in the treatment of Crohn disease indicate the etiologic importance of dietary intake in IBDs. A uniform characteristic of nutrition in developing countries (where the incidence of IBD is low) and exclusive enteral nutrition is their consistent nature for prolonged periods; however, the potentially beneficial effect of dietary monotony in respect to mammalian intestinal inflammation has not been examined. METHODS: The association between alternating (2 different complete chows) and persistent regular diets, and dextran sulfate sodium colitis susceptibility in C57BL/6J mice was studied. Colonic mucosal microbiota changes were investigated by high-throughput pyrosequencing of the 16S rRNA gene. RESULTS: The severity of colitis increased upon dietary alternation compared with consistent control feeding. The microbiota of the alternating nutritional group clustered discretely from both control groups. CONCLUSIONS: Our findings highlight that monotonous dietary intake may decrease mammalian vulnerability against colitis in association with microbiota separation. The epidemiologic and therapeutic implications of our results are also discussed.},

   abstract = {The epidemiology of inflammatory bowel disease (IBD) is changing globally. Incidence and prevalence may have stabilized in high-incidence areas such as North America and Europe but they continue to rise in previously low-incidence areas such as Eastern Europe, Asia, and much of the developing world. This epidemiological shift likely relates to westernization of lifestyle, changes in diet, and improved hygiene as part of socioeconomic development in developing countries. In Asia, UC is more prevalent than CD, although the UC:CD ratio is narrowing in certain areas. Clinical manifestations of IBD in Asia resemble the Western population, but with some differences, including higher prevalence of males and ileo-colonic CD, less familial clustering, lower surgical rates and extra-intestinal manifestations. These differences may relate to time, genetics and environmental factors. Studying the epidemiology of IBD in an area of rapidly increasing incidence may lead to discovery of important etiologic factors associated with disease development.},

   abstract = {OBJECTIVE: The rising incidence of inflammatory bowel disease in Asia supports the importance of environmental risk factors in disease aetiology. This prospective population-based case-control study in Asia-Pacific examined risk factors prior to patients developing IBD. DESIGN: 442 incident cases (186 Crohn's disease (CD); 256 UC; 374 Asians) diagnosed between 2011 and 2013 from eight countries in Asia and Australia and 940 controls (frequency-matched by sex, age and geographical location; 789 Asians) completed an environmental factor questionnaire at diagnosis. Unconditional logistic regression models were used to estimate adjusted ORs (aOR) and 95% CIs. RESULTS: In multivariate model, being breast fed >12 months (aOR 0.10; 95% CI 0.04 to 0.30), antibiotic use (aOR 0.19; 0.07 to 0.52), having dogs (aOR 0.54; 0.35 to 0.83), daily tea consumption (aOR 0.62; 0.43 to 0.91) and daily physical activity (aOR 0.58; 0.35 to 0.96) decreased the odds for CD in Asians. In UC, being breast fed >12 months (aOR 0.16; 0.08 to 0.31), antibiotic use (aOR 0.48; 0.27 to 0.87), daily tea (aOR 0.63; 0.46 to 0.86) or coffee consumption (aOR 0.51; 0.36 to 0.72), presence of hot water tap (aOR 0.65; 0.46 to 0.91) and flush toilet in childhood (aOR 0.71; 0.51 to 0.98) were protective for UC development whereas ex-smoking (aOR 2.02; 1.22 to 3.35) increased the risk of UC. CONCLUSIONS: This first population-based study of IBD risk factors in Asia-Pacific supports the importance of childhood immunological, hygiene and dietary factors in the development of IBD, suggesting that markers of altered intestinal microbiota may modulate risk of IBD later in life.},

   abstract = {INTRODUCTION: Previous studies have suggested that estrogens play a role in the development of ulcerative colitis (UC). Because isoflavones have a similar structure to 17beta-estradiol, dietary consumption of isoflavones may have similar influences on the development of UC. We examined the association between pre-illness isoflavone consumption and the risk of UC. MATERIALS AND METHODS: We conducted a hospital-based case control study, and compared the dietary habits of 126 newly diagnosed UC cases with those of 170 age- and gender-matched hospital controls. Information on dietary factors was collected using a self-administered diet history questionnaire. To consider potential changes in dietary habits due to disease symptoms, the habits were assessed separately during the previous 1 month and at 1 year before the recruitment. RESULTS: In the assessment of dietary habits during the previous 1 month, the highest tertile of isoflavone consumption revealed an increased odds ratio (OR) for UC (OR = 2.79; 95% confidence interval (CI), 1.39-5.59; Trend P = 0.004). A significant association was also observed for the dietary assessment at 1 year before, when most UC cases had not yet experienced their first disease symptoms (OR = 2.06; 95% CI, 1.05-4.04; Trend P = 0.04). Associations were more pronounced in females (OR in highest tertile of isoflavone consumption at 1 year before = 4.76; 95% CI, 1.30-17.5; Trend P = 0.02) but were obscured in males (corresponding OR = 1.21; 95% CI, 0.49-3.01; Trend P = 0.63). CONCLUSIONS: Dietary isoflavone consumption may be associated with an increased risk of UC, particularly in females. Prospective cohort studies are warranted to confirm these findings.},

   abstract = {BACKGROUND: The incidence and severity of Clostridium difficile colitis have increased dramatically in the last decade. Disease severity is related to C. difficile virulence factors, including toxins A and B, as well as the patient's immune status. The intestinal mucus is an important component of innate barrier function in the intestine. Phosphatidylcholine (PC) is a key constituent of the intestinal mucus barrier, and exogenous PC administration has had therapeutic efficacy in patients with ulcerative colitis. We studied the protective function of exogenous PC on C. difficile toxin effects on the intestinal barrier in vitro. METHODS: Mucus-producing (HT29-MTX strain) and non-mucus-producing (HT29 strain) intestinal epithelial monolayers were cocultured with PC and C. difficile toxin A added to the apical media. Basal chamber culture supernatants were subsequently obtained, and tumor necrosis factor and interleukin 6 were quantitated by enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay. In other experiments, HT29 toxin A uptake, intestinal monolayer permeability, necrosis, and actin microfilament disruption were determined. RESULTS: There was a threefold to fourfold decrease in tumor necrosis factor and interleukin 6 levels and similar decreases in toxin A uptake and permeability changes in intestinal epithelial cells with mucus or PC versus control. Intestinal epithelial cell necrosis was reduced by more than 50% with either mucus or PC versus control. The integrity of HT29 cell cytoskeleton was demonstrated by both the mucus layer of the HT29-MTX strain and by exogenous PC administration by phalloidin staining of actin microfilaments. CONCLUSION: PC supplementation was effective in improving intestinal barrier defense against C. difficile toxin A challenge. PC administration may be a useful therapeutic adjunct in severe cases of C. difficile colitis or in patients who do not improve with conventional treatment.},

   abstract = {ETHNOPHARMACOLOGICAL RELEVANCE: Stem bark and fruit pulp of Hymenaea stigonocarpa Mart ex. Hayne (Fabaceae) has been popularly used to treat inflammation and gastrointestinal diseases including ulcers, diarrhea and gastric pain. The aim of this study was to investigate the intestinal anti-inflammatory activity of a methanol extract derived from the stem bark and diet with fruit pulp of Hymenaea stigonocarpa in the TNBS model of intestinal inflammation in rats. MATERIAL AND METHODS: The intestinal anti-inflammatory activity of stem bark extract (100, 200 and 400mg/kg) and fruit pulp (10% and 5% in diet) was measured against the intestinal inflammatory process induced by TNBS (trinitrobenzesulphonic acid) in rats. The protective effects were evaluated as follows: evaluation of intestinal damage (damage score, extension of lesion, colon weight/length ratio), incidence of diarrhea and adherence to adjacent organs, colon glutathione (GSH) and malondialdehyde (MDA) contents, myeloperoxidase (MPO) and alkaline phosphatase (AP) activities. In addition, in vitro studies on lipid peroxidation in rat brain membranes and phytochemical profile were performed with both stem bark and fruit pulp. RESULTS: Treatment with 100, 200 and 400mg/kg of stem bark extract and 10% fruit pulp flour showed protective effects in the TNBS-induced colon damage, which was related to inhibition of MPO and AP activities, reduction in colon MDA content, and counteraction of GSH depletion induced by inflammatory process. A concentration-dependent inhibitory effect on the lipid peroxidation in rat brain membranes for stem bark and fruit pulp was determined, with an IC50 value of 5.25 +/- 0.23 mug/mL and 27.33 +/- 0.09 mug/mL, respectively. Similar phytochemical composition was observed in fruit and stem bark, including mainly flavonoids, condensed tannins and terpenes. CONCLUSIONS: Stem bark extract and fruit pulp flour of Hymenaea stigonocarpa prevented TNBS-induced colonic damage in rats and this protective effect were associated to an improvement of intestinal oxidative stress. The observed anti-inflammatory and antioxidant effects may be associated to the presence of flavonoids and tannins in the stem bark and fruit pulp of Hymenaea stigonocarpa.},

Genetic variation in the NPC1L1 gene affects cholesterol absorption and serum cholesterol levels. However, NCP1L1 genotypes have not previously been invesigated. In this study, genotyping of the NPC1L1 gene was examined in healthy individuals as well as patients with hepatitis C virus (HCV) and inflammatory bowel disease (IBD). A total of 541 individuals were enrolled in the study, including 80 patients with HCV hepatitis, 205 with ulcerative colitis (UC) and 127 with Crohn's disease (CD). Genotyping was performed using TaqMan(R) SNP assays. Minor allelic frequencies of the 17345C>G (rs2072183) and 19031G>A (rs4720470) SNPs were found to be 0.40 and 0.30, respectively. No significant differences were detected in serum HCV levels in the 1735C>G or 19031G>A SNPs. The 1735C>G SNPs were not associated with total cholesterol (TC) levels in the healthy controls and/or HCV patients. However, statistically significant associations between the 1735GG variant and TC levels were detected in CD patients, with 1735GG carriers having the highest TC levels compared to the 1735CC and 1735CG carriers (P=0.048). Similar trends were noted in UC patients, but did not reach statistical significance (P= 0.19). The 19031G>A SNPs were not associated with TC levels in the healthy controls or patients. This study showed the allelic and genotypic distribution of 1735C>G and 19031G>ASNPs of the NPC1L1 gene in a large number of subjects. The NPC1L1 1735GG variant may therefore be favorable for CD accompanied with malnutrition.},

The current understanding of these diseases suggests that ulcerative colitis (UC) and Crohn's disease (CD) result from poorly defined interactions between genetic and environmental factors which culminate in the pathologic effects and clinical manifestations of these diseases. The genetic variant appears not sufficient itself to lead to the development of the clinical disease, but likely must combine with the environmental factors. The intestinal microbiome is pivotal to IBD development. A greater understanding of the contribution of these factors to dysbiosis is critical, and we aspire to restoring a healthy microbiome to treat flares and ideally prevent the development of IBD and its complications.

   abstract = {BACKGROUND: Hyperhomocysteinemia seems to be a common phenomenon in both patients with ulcerative colitis and Crohn's disease. Many factors including deficiencies of cobalamin, folate and pyridoxine, smoking habits, alcohol and coffee intake, some medications and age may predispose subjects to hyperhomocysteinemia. The study aimed to evaluate homocysteine levels in an inflammatory bowel disease cohort as dependent of life style and disease activity. METHODS: 85 consecutive patients with inflammatory bowel disease (38 with Crohn's disease and 47 with ulcerative colitis) and 65 control subjects were included in the prospective study. The following parameters were analyzed: disease activity, duration of the disease, location of pathological changes, presence of complications, current medications, past surgical procedures, smoking history, concomitant diseases, biochemical parameters and plasma homocysteine levels. RESULTS: Mild hyperhomocysteinemia was found in 16 patients with Crohn's disease (42%), 19 patients with ulcerative colitis (40%) and 19 patients in the control group (29%) (p = 0.59). There was not any significant correlation between homocysteine level and disease activity. Only folic acid supplementation and gender affected homocysteine level. Folic acid intake led to reduction of homocysteine levels in all groups of patients (11.8 micromol/l vs. 8.33 miccromol/l, p = 0.0065 in Crohn's disease patients and 10.94 micromol/l vs. 7.78 micromol/l, p = 0.0069 in ulcerative colitis patients). CONCLUSION: Homocysteine level in patients with inflammatory bowel disease is mostly normal or slightly elevated. Disease activity does not have an impact on homocysteine level. Folic acid is the most important factor having an influence on homocysteine level in patients with inflammatory bowel disease.},

   abstract = {BACKGROUND: Data regarding the long-term outcomes of restorative proctocolectomy and ileal pouch anal anastomosis including pouch function and quality of life in the pediatric population are limited in pediatric patients. STUDY DESIGN: Indications for surgery, complications, long-term function, and quality of life were evaluated in pediatric patients undergoing ileal pouch anal anastomosis. Assessment of quality of life was performed using the Cleveland Global Quality of Life score. RESULTS: There were 433 patients with a mean age of 18.04 +/- 2.9 years. Final pathologic diagnoses were ulcerative colitis or indeterminate colitis (78.3%), familial adenomatous polyposis (15.7%), Crohn's disease (5.1%), and others (0.9%). There were 237 patients (54.7%) who underwent total proctocolectomy and ileal pouch anal anastomosis; 196 (45.3%) underwent initial subtotal colectomy followed by completion proctectomy with ileal pouch anal anastomosis. Anastomosis was stapled in 352 patients (81.3%) and hand-sewn in 81 (18.7%) patients. Mean follow-up was 108.5 +/- 78.4 months. At the most recent follow-up, mean Cleveland Global Quality of Life score was 0.8 +/- 0.2 and numbers of daytime and night-time bowel movements were 5.3 +/- 3.1 and 1.6 +/- 1.3, respectively. The majority of the patients (86.8%) were fully continent or only complained of rare incontinence. Most patients had no seepage (day, 84.3%; night, 72.4%) and did not wear any pads (day, 89.3%; night, 84.3%). Most denied dietary (71.3%), social (84.8%), work (85.7%), or sexual restrictions (87.6%) at the time of last follow-up. There were 92.7% of patients who said they would undergo ileal pouch anal anastomosis again and 95.2% would recommend surgery to others. CONCLUSIONS: Restorative proctocolectomy with ileal pouch anal anastomosis can be performed in pediatric patients with acceptable morbidity and is associated with good long-term results in terms of gastrointestinal function, quality of life, and patient satisfaction.},

   abstract = {CONTEXT: Vitamin D promotes bone health and regulates the immune system, both important actions for pediatric patients with inflammatory bowel disease (IBD). The supplementation dose that would maintain optimal serum 25-hydroxyvitamin D concentration (25OHD >/= 32 ng/mL) is unknown. OBJECTIVE: The objective of the study was to compare two supplementation regimens' efficacy and safety in maintaining optimal 25OHD in children with IBD. DESIGN: This was a randomized, not blinded, controlled trial. SETTING: The trial was conducted in the Boston Children's Hospital Clinical and Translational Study Unit. PARTICIPANTS: Sixty-three patients, aged 8-18 years with IBD and baseline 25OHD greater than 20 ng/mL were enrolled; 48 completed the study, and one withdrew for adverse events. INTERVENTION: Arm A received 400 IU of oral vitamin D2 daily (n = 32). Arm B received 1000 IU daily in the summer/fall and 2000 IU in the winter/spring (n = 31). MAIN OUTCOME: The main outcome was the probability of maintaining 25OHD of 32 ng/mL or greater in all trimonthly visits for 12 months. RESULTS: Three participants in arm A (9.4%) and three in arm B (9.7%) achieved the primary outcome (P = .97). The incidence of adverse events, all minor, did not differ. More participants in arm A developed C-reactive protein level of 1 mg/dL or greater (31% vs 10%, P = .04) and IL-6 greater than 3 pg/mL (54% vs 27%, P = .05). CONCLUSIONS: Daily oral vitamin D2 doses up to 2000 IU were inadequate to maintain optimal 25OHD but were well tolerated. The finding of lower incidence of elevated inflammatory markers and cytokines among participants receiving higher vitamin D2 doses merits further study.},

   abstract = {BACKGROUND: Orofacial granulomatosis (OFG) causes chronic, disfiguring, granulomatous inflammation of the lips and oral mucosa. A proportion of cases have co-existing intestinal Crohn's disease (CD). The pathogenesis is unknown but has recently been linked to dietary sensitivity. Although allergy has been suggested as an aetiological factor in OFG there are few published data to support this link. In this study, we sought clinical evidence of allergy in a series of patients with OFG and compared this to a series of patients with inflammatory bowel disease (IBD) without oral involvement and to population control estimates. METHODS: Prevalence rates of allergy and oral allergy syndrome (OAS) were determined in 88 patients with OFG using questionnaires, skin prick tests, total and specific serum IgE levels. Allergy was also determined in 117 patients with IBD without evidence of oral involvement (79 with CD and 38 with ulcerative colitis (UC)). RESULTS: Prevalence rates of allergy in patients with OFG were significantly greater than general population estimates (82% versus 22% respectively p = <0.0005). Rates of allergy were also greater in those with CD (39%) and, interestingly, highest in those with OFG and concurrent CD (87%). Conversely, whist OAS was common in allergic OFG patients (35%) rates of OAS were significantly less in patients with concomitant CD (10% vs 44% with and without CD respectively p = 0.006). Amongst CD patients, allergy was associated with perianal disease (p = 0.042) but not with ileal, ileocolonic or colonic disease location. Allergy in UC (18%) was comparable to population estimates. CONCLUSION: We provide compelling clinical evidence for the association of allergy with OFG whether occurring alone or in association with CD. The presence of gut CD increases this association but, conversely, reduces the expression of OAS in those with atopy. Interestingly, there is no evidence of increased allergy in UC.},

   abstract = {BACKGROUND AND AIMS: The polyunsaturated fatty acids (PUFA) arachidonic acid (AA, n-6) and eicosapentaenoic acid (EPA, n-3) are precursors of eicosanoids and other lipid mediators which have critical roles in inflammation. The mediators formed from the different PUFA have different potencies. We hypothesised that metabolic changes associated with colonic mucosal inflammation would modify the bioavailability of the eicosanoid precursors AA and EPA. METHODS: Colonic mucosa biopsies were obtained from patients with ulcerative colitis and from matched controls. Inflammation was graded endoscopically and histologically. Esterified and non-esterified fatty acids were determined within the biopsies using gas chromatography-mass spectrometry and liquid chromatography-mass spectrometry, respectively. RESULTS: Biopsy samples were collected from 69 UC patients (54 providing both inflamed and non-inflamed mucosa) and 69 controls. Inflamed mucosa had higher AA (p<0.001) and lower EPA (p<0.010) contents and a higher AA:EPA ratio (p<0.001). Inflamed mucosa also had higher docosapentaenoic acid (DPA) and docosahexaenoic acid (DHA) and lower linoleic acid (LA) and alpha-linolenic acid (alpha-LNA) contents (all p<0.001), compared to non-inflamed and controls. There were significant correlations between severity of inflammation and contents of AA, DPA and DHA (positive correlations) and of LA, alpha-LNA and EPA (negative correlations). CONCLUSIONS: Higher AA, AA:EPA ratio, DPA and DHA and lower LA, alpha-LNA and EPA are seen in inflamed mucosa in UC and correlate with severity of inflammation. This suggests an alteration in fatty acid metabolism in the inflamed gut mucosa, which may offer novel targets for intervention and should be considered if nutritional strategies are used.},

It focuses on the impact of living with indefinite diversion of the pouch and a permanent end ileostomy. Six participants were interviewed with an aim to establish their experience of pouch failure and the support they required. Five pertinent themes emerged that suggested participants did not expect pouch failure and were unprepared for the regression towards UC. Some participants recommenced drug therapy, wore pads to manage leakage from the diverted pouch, avoided certain social settings or manipulated diet and lifestyle in order to gain an acceptable quality of life with a permanent ileostomy. Pouch failure potentially presents adverse effects on patients' quality of life, but currently there is a deficit in support and resources available in order to provide acceptable outcomes for patients experiencing pouch failure.},

   abstract = {The authors revise the latest evidence in the literature regarding managing of osteoporosis in ulcerative colitis (UC), paying particular attention to the latest tendency of the research concerning the management of bone damage in the patient affected by UC. It is wise to assess vitamin D status in ulcerative colitis patients to recognize who is predisposed to low levels of vitamin D, whose deficiency has to be treated with oral or parenteral vitamin D supplementation. An adequate dietary calcium intake or supplementation and physical activity, if possible, should be guaranteed. Osteoporotic risk factors, such as smoking and excessive alcohol intake, must be avoided. Steroid has to be prescribed at the lowest possible dosage and for the shortest possible time. Moreover, conditions favoring falling have to been minimized, like carpets, low illumination, sedatives assumption, vitamin D deficiency. It is advisable to assess the fracture risk in all UC patient by the fracture assessment risk tool (FRAX((R)) tool), that calculates the ten years risk of fracture for the population aged from 40 to 90 years in many countries of the world. A high risk value could indicate the necessity of treatment, whereas a low risk value suggests a follow-up only. An intermediate risk supports the decision to prescribe bone mineral density (BMD) assessment and a subsequent patient revaluation for treatment. Dual energy X-ray absorptiometry bone densitometry can be used not only for BMD measurement, but also to collect data about bone quality by the means of trabecular bone score and hip structural analysis assessment. These two indices could represent a method of interesting perspectives in evaluating bone status in patients affected by diseases like UC, which may present an impairment of bone quality as well as of bone quantity. In literature there is no strong evidence for instituting pharmacological therapy of bone impairment in UC patients for clinical indications other than those that are also applied to the patients with osteoporosis. Therefore, a reasonable advice is to consider pharmacological treatment for osteoporosis in those UC patients who already present fragility fractures, which bring a high risk of subsequent fractures. Therapy has also to be considered in patients with a high risk of fracture even if it did not yet happen, and particularly when they had long periods of corticosteroid therapy or cumulative high dosages. In patients without fragility fractures or steroid treatment, a medical decision about treatment could be guided by the FRAX tool to determine the intervention threshold. Among drugs for osteoporosis treatment, the bisphosphonates are the most studied ones, with the best and longest evidence of efficacy and safety. Despite this, several questions are still open, such as the duration of treatment, the necessity to discontinue it, the indication of therapy in young patients, particularly in those without previous fractures. Further, it has to be mentioned that a long-term bisphosphonates use in primary osteoporosis has been associated with an increased incidence of dramatic side-effects, even if uncommon, like osteonecrosis of the jaw and atypical sub-trochanteric and diaphyseal femoral fractures. UC is a long-lasting disease and the majority of patients is relatively young. In this scenario primary prevention of fragility fracture is the best cost-effective strategy. Vitamin D supplementation, adequate calcium intake, suitable physical activity (when possible), removing of risk factors for osteoporosis like smoking, and avoiding falling are the best medical acts.},

   abstract = {Inflammatory bowel diseases (IBD), including both Crohn's disease and ulcerative colitis, are disorders of chronic inflammation of the gastrointestinal tract marked by episodes of relapse and remission. Over the past several decades, advances have been made in understanding the epidemiology of IBD. The incidence and prevalence of both Crohn's disease and ulcerative colitis have been increasing worldwide across pediatric and adult populations. As IBD is thought to be related to a combination of individual genetic susceptibility, environmental triggers, and alterations in the gut microbiome that stimulate an inflammatory response, understanding the potentially modifiable environmental risk factors associated with the development or the course of IBD could impact disease rates or management in the future. Current hypotheses as to the development of IBD are reviewed, as are a host of environmental cofactors that have been investigated as both protective and inciting factors for IBD onset. Such environmental factors include breast feeding, gastrointestinal infections, urban versus rural lifestyle, medication exposures, stress, smoking, and diet. The role of these factors in disease course is also reviewed. Looking forward, there is still much to be learned about the etiology of IBD and how specific environmental exposures intimately impact the development of disease and also the potential for relapse.},

   abstract = {BACKGROUND: The gut microbiota is central to health and disorders such as inflammatory bowel disease. Differences in microbiota related to geography and ethnicity may hold the key to recent changes in the incidence of microbiota-related disorders. METHODS: Gut mucosal microbiota was analyzed in 190 samples from 87 Caucasian and Chinese subjects, from Australia and Hong Kong, comprising 22 patients with Crohn's disease, 30 patients with ulcerative colitis, 29 healthy controls, and 6 healthy relatives of patients with Crohn's disease. Bacterial 16S rRNA microarray and 454 pyrosequencing were performed. RESULTS: The microbiota was diverse in health, regardless of ethnicity or geography (operational taxonomic unit number and Shannon diversity index). Ethnicity and geography, however, did affect microbial composition. Crohn's disease resulted in reduced bacterial diversity, regardless of ethnicity or geography, and was the strongest determinant of composition. In ulcerative colitis, diversity was reduced in Chinese subjects only, suggesting that ethnicity is a determinant of bacterial diversity, whereas composition was determined by disease and ethnicity. Specific phylotypes were different between health and disease. Chinese patients with inflammatory bowel disease more often than healthy Chinese tended to have had a Western diet in childhood, in the East and West. CONCLUSION: The healthy microbiota is diverse but compositionally affected by geographical and ethnic factors. The microbiota is substantially altered in inflammatory bowel disease, but ethnicity may also play an important role. This may be key to the changing epidemiology in developing countries, and emigrants to the West.},

   abstract = {BACKGROUND: Patients with inflammatory bowel disease (IBD) report a range of nutritional and dietary problems and high-quality written information should be available on these. There is little research investigating the availability and quality of such information for patients with IBD. OBJECTIVE: This study assessed the type and quality of written information on nutrition and diet available to patients with IBD and the opinions of patients and health professionals. SETTING AND PARTICIPANTS: Seventy-two patients with IBD were recruited from a large gastroenterology outpatient centre in England. One hundred dietitians from across the United Kingdom were also recruited. METHODS: Face-to-face surveys were conducted with patients with IBD. Questions regarding the use, format and usefulness of dietary information received were probed. Dietitians were surveyed regarding written dietary information used in clinical practice. Samples of IBD-specific dietary information used across the UK were objectively assessed using two validated tools. MAIN RESULTS: The majority of patients rated written information as 'good' or 'very good', with the most useful information relating to 'general diet and IBD'. Forty-nine (49%) dietitians reported gaps in written information available for patients with IBD. Fifty-three different samples of IBD-specific information sheets were returned, with widely variable objective quality ratings. Commercially produced written information scored greater than locally produced information (BMA tool, P < 0.05). CONCLUSIONS: Patient access to high-quality, written, IBD-specific dietary information is variable. IBD-specific written nutrition information needs to be developed in accordance with validated tools to empower patients, encourage self-management and overcome nutritional implications of IBD.},

   abstract = {Ulcerative colitis (UC) is a condition at increased risk for colorectal carcinoma (CRC) development. Nowadays, screening and follow-up programs are routinely performed worldwide to promote the early detection of CRCs in subjects with well known risk factors (extent, duration and severity of the disorder). The diffusion of these procedures is presumably the main reason for the marked reduction of cancer incidence and mortality in the course of UC. In addition, chemoprevention has been widely investigated and developed in many medical fields, and aspirin has shown a preventive effect against CRC, while mesalazine has been strongly invoked as a potential chemopreventive agent in UC. However, available studies show some limitations due to the obvious ethical implications of drug withdrawal in UC in order to design a control group. The estrogen receptors (ER) alpha/beta balance seems to have a relevant influence on colorectal carcinogenesis and ER beta appears to parallel apoptosis, and hence an anti-carcinogenic effect. Phytoestrogens are compounds acting as ER beta agonists and have shown a promising chemopreventive effect on sporadic as well as genetically inherited CRC. There is evidence suggesting a role for ERs in UC-related carcinogenesis. In this perspective, since these substances can be considered as dietary supplements and are completely free from side effects, phytoestrogens could be an interesting option for CRC prevention, even when the disease is a consequence of long-term chronic inflammation, as in the course of UC. Further studies of their effects are warranted in both the basic research and clinical fields.},

METHODS: Forty female rats were randomly divided into five groups, control group, model group, CR group, 5:1 PUFA ad libitum group, 5: 1 PUFA CR group. CR groups provided with a limited daily food allotment of 60% of that eaten by the ad libitum animals for 14 weeks. Ulcerative colitis model in rats were given 5. 0% dextran sulfate sodium in their drinking water for 7 days. RESULTS: 5:1 PUFA CR group significantly decreased body weight, disease activity index, macroscopic and histological score compared to model group. In addition, administration of 5: 1 PUFA CR effectively inhibited MPO activity. The levels of TNF-alpha and IL-6 in the serum with colitis were decreased by 5: 1 PUFA CR (P <0. 05). CONCLUSION: These results suggest that combination of calories restriction and n-6/n-3 =5:1 PUFA may be more beneficial in attenuating the progression of DSS induced ulcerative colitis.},

   abstract = {It has been a big puzzle as why the inflammation of ulcerative colitis (UC) is limited to the mucosa, while in Crohn's disease (CD) the inflammation is transmural and can be seen in all layers of the gut. Here, I give a tentative explanation extended from the unified hypothesis I proposed on the etiology of inflammatory bowel disease. This hypothesis suggested that both UC and CD are caused by weakening of the gut barrier due to damage of the protective mucus layer and the underlying tissue by the poorly inactivated digestive proteases resulting from a reduction of gut bacteria by dietary chemicals like saccharin and sucralose. However, the large amounts of bacteria in the colon make the recruitment of neutrophils and formation of crypt abscess the main manifestation of UC, while the infiltration of antigens and dietary particles in the small and large intestine mainly cause the recruitment of macrophages and formation of granulomas as the main manifestations in CD. The fast reacting and short life span of neutrophils make the fight and damage limited to the surface of the mucosa. In contrast, the long life span and constant movement of macrophages may bring the harmful agents deep into the tissue. Therefore, the pathogenesis of UC may be more like bacterial pneumonia, while CD may be more like pneumoconiosis or tuberculosis of the lung.},

The duration of the above-mentioned depends on the prevalence of such symptoms as fever, bowel movements, length of the functioning gastrointestinal tract, stoma and intestinal fistula presence. Nutritional therapy is an essential element of successful treatment alongside pharmacological, surgical, and biological therapy, as well as other methods. Crohn's disease and ulcerative colitis considered as chronic diseases, lead towards physical and biopsychosocial disability, being responsible for the reduction in the quality of life. The aim of the study was to determine the quality of life after surgical procedures in case of patients diagnosed with Crohn's disease and ulcerative colitis, subjected to natural and parenteral nutrition. MATERIAL AND METHODS: The study group comprised 52 patients from the Department of Gastroenterology, Military Medical Institute, and Department of Surgery and Clinical Nutrition, Clinical Hospital in Warsaw. The study was performed between October, 2011 and April, 2012. The World Health Organization Quality of Life Instrument - Bref (WHOQOL-BREF) questionnaire was used to deter-mine the patients' quality of life. CONCLUSIONS: A lower quality of life was observed in case of patients subjected to parenteral nutrition, poor education, disease symptoms exacerbation, in the majority-rural inhabitants. The quality of life does not depend on gender, type of disease, family status, and additional medical care.},

   abstract = {OBJECTIVE: To study the impact of methionine restriction (MetR) on mucosal histopathology, permeability and tight junction composition in a dextran sulfate sodium (DSS)-induced colitis model, and to explore its underlying mechanism. METHODS: SD rats were randomly divided into 4 groups: normal rats fed by a complete amino acid (AA group) diet, normal rats fed by MetR diet (MetR group), DSS treated rats fed by a complete amino acid (DSS+AA group) and DSS treated rats fed by MetR diet (DSS+MetR group), each group had 15 rats.Abdominal aorta blood sampling was taken at day 21 after DSS model been established to analyze blood routine examination, liver and kidney function and level of electrolyte. Morphological changes in colonic mucosa were evaluated and scored by light microscopy. Myeloperoxidase (MPO) activity was measured. The effect of MetR on mucosal permeability of colon strips was detected by Ussing chamber. Claudin2, occludin, claudin3, ZO-1 expression were quantified by Western blot. RESULTS: The early clinical manifestation in the DSS treated rats were loose stool or diarrhea, hematochezia positive and bleeding, and weight losing. HE observation showed prominent colitis in distal colon with manifestations of crypt abscess and infiltration of inflammatory cells. Although MPO activity and WBC account between the DSS+MetR and DSS+AA group did not significantly changed, treatment with MetR diet significantly decreased the extent and severity of epithelial injury of DSS+MetR group (10.55 +/- 3.62 vs 15.00 +/- 4.89, P = 0.003). There were no significant difference in PCNA immunohistochemical result between the DSS+MetR group and DSS+AA group. Compared to the rats on AA diet, transepithelial electrical resistance (TEER) in DSS+AA group was obvious lower [(28.40 +/- 6.78) Omega.cm(2) vs (46.53 +/- 4.03) Omega.cm(2), P < 0.05], and TEER in MetR group were obviously higher [(60.64 +/- 8.40) Omega.cm(2) vs (46.53 +/- 4.03) Omega.cm(2), P < 0.05]. However, short-circuit current (Isc) in DSS+MetR group was obviously higher that of DSS+AA group [(35.01 +/- 2.19) microA/cm(2) vs (29.61 +/- 1.19) microA/cm(2), P < 0.05]. Western blot suggested that colon claudin2 expression was not found in colon epithelium of normal rats, and an obviously increase expression of claudin3 protein was found in the MetR group, compared to AA group; and an significantly increase in the abundance of claudin3 was found in the DSS+MetR group, but amount of claudin2 was decreased, compared with the DSS+MetR group. CONCLUSION: The MetR diet has obvious therapeutic effect on ulcerative colitis model rats induced by DSS, and its mechanism may not by regulating inflammatory cell infiltration and the way of promoting intestinal cell growth to alleviate inflammatory injury, but probably by changing the structure and function of tight junction protein and improve the intestinal mucosal barrier function, and promote the repair of damaged intestinal mucosa.},

   abstract = {This study was conducted to investigate serum amino acids profile in dextran sulfate sodium (DSS)-induced colitis, and impacts of graded dose of arginine or glutamine supplementation on the colitis. Using DSS-induced colitis model, which is similar to human ulcerative colitis, we determined serum profile of amino acids at day 3, 7, 10 and 12 (5 days post DSS treatment). Meanwhile, effects of graded dose of arginine (0.4%, 0.8%, and 1.5%) or glutamine (0.5%, 1.0% and 2.0%) supplementation on clinical parameters, serum amino acids, colonic tight junction proteins, colonic anti-oxidative indicators [catalase, total superoxide dismutase (T-SOD), glutathione peroxidase (GSH-Px)], colonic pro-inflammatory cytokines [interleukin-1 beta (IL-1beta), IL-6, IL-17 and tumor necrosis factor alpha (TNF-alpha)] in DSS-induced colitis were fully analyzed at day 7 and 12. Additionally, the activation of signal transduction pathways, including nuclear factor kappa B (NF-kappaB), mitogen-activated protein kinases (MAPK), phosphoinositide-3-kinases (PI3K)/PI3K-protein kinase B (Akt), and myosin light chain kinase (MLCK)-myosin light chain (MLC20), were analyzed using immunoblotting. Serum amino acids analysis showed that DSS treatment changed the serum contents of amino acids, such as Trp, Glu, and Gln (P<0.05). Dietary arginine or glutamine supplementation had significant (P<0.05) influence on the clinical and biochemical parameters (T-SOD, IL-17 and TNF-alpha) in colitis model. These results were associated with colonic NF-kappaB, PI3K-Akt and MLCK signaling pathways. In conclusion, arginine or glutamine could be a potential therapy for intestinal inflammatory diseases.},

   abstract = {BACKGROUND: The therapeutic effect of enteral nutrition in Crohn's disease (CD) and the epidemiological associations between diet and inflammatory bowel disease (IBD) implicate diet in IBD causation. There is little evidence, however, to support specific dietary changes and patients often receive contradictory advice. AIM: To review the literature on the impacts of diet on IBD causation and activity to produce guidance based on 'best available evidence'. METHOD: Review of Medline, Embase and Cochrane databases from 1975 to 2012 using MeSH headings 'crohn's disease' 'ulcerative colitis' 'enteral' 'diet' 'nutrition' 'fatty acid' and 'food additives'. RESULTS: Enteral nutrition with a formula-defined feed is effective treatment for CD, but approximately 50% of patients relapse within 6 months of return to normal diet. There is no direct evidence of benefit from any other specific dietary modification in CD, but indirect evidence supports recommendation of a low intake of animal fat, insoluble fibre and processed fatty foods containing emulsifiers. Foods tolerated in sustained remission may not be tolerated following relapse. Some evidence supports vitamin D supplementation. In ulcerative colitis (UC), evidence is weaker, but high intakes of meat and margarine correlate with increased UC incidence and high meat intake also correlates with increased likelihood of relapse. CONCLUSIONS: There is little evidence from interventional studies to support specific dietary recommendations. Nevertheless, people with IBD deserve advice based on 'best available evidence' rather than no advice at all, although dietary intake should not be inappropriately restrictive. Further interventional studies of dietary manipulation are urgently required.},

   abstract = {BACKGROUND/AIMS: Anthocyanins are plant-derived dietary components that are highly abundant, for example, in bilberries. We have previously demonstrated that anthocyanins exert anti-inflammatory properties in mouse colitis models and ameliorate disease activity in ulcerative colitis patients. Here, we studied the molecular mechanisms through which anthocyanin-containing bilberry extract (BE) exerts anti-inflammatory effects in human monocytic THP-1 cells. METHODS: THP-1 cells were pre-incubated with BE 20 min prior to TNF-alpha or IFN-gamma (100 ng/ml each) stimulation. Signalling protein activation was studied by Western blotting, mRNA expression by quantitative PCR and cytokine secretion by ELISA. RESULTS: IFN-gamma-induced phosphorylation of STAT1 and STAT3 was significantly reduced by BE co-treatment. Consequently, levels of mRNA expression and/or cytokine secretion of MCP-1, IL-6, TNF-alpha, ICAM-1, and T-bet were lower with BE co-treatment. In contrast, BE enhanced TNF-alpha-mediated p65-NF-kappaB phosphorylation but reduced ERK1/2 phosphorylation. BE co-treatment further increased TNF-alpha-induced mRNA expression and secretion of NF-kappaB target genes, such as IL-6, IL-8, and MCP-1, while mRNA levels of ICAM-1 were reduced. CONCLUSIONS: BE co-treatment reduced IFN-gamma-induced signal protein activation, pro-inflammatory gene expression, and cytokine secretion, whereas it enhanced TNF-alpha-induced responses. These findings suggest a distinct role for anthocyanins in modulating inflammatory responses that need to be further studied to fully understand anthocyanin-mediated effects.},

Most studies about EcN has been devoted to this organism efficacy in ulcerative colitis treatment. Comparable results were obtained, by citied authors, in the treatment (sustaining remission) of EcN and mesalazine in ulcerative colitis. Moreover, this probiotic therapy, compared to placebo, contributes to obtaining a faster remission and improvement of intestinal histopathology. The use of EcN in Crohn's disease has not been the subject of as many studies as in the case of ulcerative colitis. Assessing the importance of EcN in treatment of other gastrointestinal disorders, authors of the studies observed, that in patients with irritable bowel syndrome, who receiving this probiotic there was a pain, nausea and bloating reduction. In studies conducted among children a positive impact of EcN in prevention and treatment of diarrhea was demonstrated. Similar results were obtained in studies conducted in experimental animals. Based on the presented review it can be concluded that the strain of Escherichia coli Nissle 1917 is useful in treatment of gastrointestinal diseases, especially in treatment of ulcerative colitis. This probiotic may constitute a part of treatment of irritable bowel syndrome and diarrhea. The effectiveness of this strain in treatment of Crohn's disease is not clearly established and further research are require.},

   abstract = {We evaluated the protective effect of dietary extra virgin olive oil (EVOO) polyphenol extract (PE) supplementation in the inflammatory response associated to chronic colitis model. Six-week-old mice were randomized in four dietary groups: standard diet (SD), EVOO diet and both enriched with PE (850 ppm) (SD+PE and EVOO+PE). After 30 days, animals that were exposed to dextran sodium sulfate (DSS) (3%) followed by 3 weeks of drinking water developed chronic colitis, which was evaluated by disease activity index (DAI) and histology. Cell proliferation was analyzed by immunohistochemical and changes in monocyte chemotactic protein (MCP)-1 and tumor necrosis factor (TNF)-alpha mRNA expression by quantitative real-time polymerase chain reaction. Colonic expression of inducible nitric oxide synthase (iNOS), cyclooxygenase (COX)-2, mitogen-activated protein kinases (MAPKs), IkappaBalpha inhibitory and peroxisome proliferator-activated receptor gamma (PPARgamma) were determined by western blotting. SD-DSS group showed a significant increase of DAI, histological damage and cell proliferation, as well as an up-regulation of TNF-alpha, MCP-1, COX-2 and iNOS proteins. p38 and JNK MAPKs phosphorylation, IkappaBalpha degradation and PPARgamma deactivation were also observed. However, in DSS-treated and EVOO+PE-fed mice, DAI and cell proliferation were significantly reduced, as well as MCP-1, TNF-alpha, COX-2 and iNOS expression levels. In addition, this dietary group, notably down-regulated JNK phosphorylation, prevented IkappaBalpha degradation and PPARgamma deactivation. These results demonstrated, for the first time, that EVOO-PE supplementation possessed marked protective effects on experimental colitis through PPARgamma up-regulation and nuclear transcription factor-kappa B and MAPK signaling pathway inhibition, decreasing the inflammatory cascade. We concluded that PE-enriched EVOO diet could be a beneficial functional food on ulcerative colitis.},

   abstract = {Extra virgin olive oil (EVOO) has demonstrated immunomodulatory and antiinflammatory properties in murine experimental ulcerative colitis (UC). In addition to its high monounsaturated fatty acid content, evidences have accumulated on the favorable properties of minor, although highly bioactive, components present in the unsaponifiable fraction (UF). The present study was designed to evaluate the effects of dietary EVOO's UF supplementation on acute UC. C57BL/6 mice were fed from weaning with sunflower oil (SD), EVOO diet and UF-enriched SD at 5% oil (SD+UF). After 30 days, mice were exposed to 3% dextran sulfate sodium (DSS) for 5 days developing acute colitis. After 4 days of DSS removal, animals were sacrificed and colons were histological and biochemically processed. Disease activity index and microscopic damage score were significantly improved in EVOO and SD+UF dietary groups versus SD group. In addition, both dietary treatments significantly induced decreases in MCP-1 and TNF-alpha levels, iNOS and COX-2 overexpression and p38 MAPKs activation in colon mucosa. Moreover, an upregulation of IkappaB expression was also observed after feeding the animals with both diets. However, no statistically differences between data from mice fed with EVOO or UF+SD diets were observed. Dietary enrichment with EVOO's UF reduces the damage in acute colitis model, alleviating the oxidative events and returning proinflammatory proteins expression to basal levels probably through p38 MAPK and NFkappaB signalling pathways. EVOO's UF diet might provide a basis for developing a new strategy in dietary supplementation for the prevention of UC.},

   abstract = {SCOPE: Squalene is a polyunsaturated triterpene, which has exhibited anticancer and antioxidant activities among others. We investigated dietary squalene supplementation effect on an acute colitis model induced by dextran sulfate sodium (DSS) in C57BL/6 mice. METHODS AND RESULTS: Mice were fed from weaning with squalene at 0.02% and 0.1%. After 4 weeks, mice were exposed to 3% DSS for 5 days developing acute colitis. After DSS removal (5 days), colons were histological and biochemically processed. Our results showed that dietary squalene treatment exerts anti-inflammatory action in DSS-induced acute colitis. Western blot revealed that squalene downregulated COX-2 (where COX is cyclooxygenase) and inducible nitric oxide synthase system by inhibition of mitogen-activated protein kinase p38 and the nuclear factor-kappa B signaling pathways, preventing an increase in the cytokines levels. Under our experimental conditions, STAT3 and FOXP3 (where FOXP3 is forkhead box P3) were not modified and the transcriptional regulation of antioxidant and/or detoxifying enzymes, Nrf2 (where Nrf2 is nuclear factor (erythroid-derived 2)-like 2), was reduced in DSS-induced colitis. However, any change could be observed after squalene supplementation. CONCLUSION: Squalene was able to improve the oxidative events and returned proinflammatory proteins expression to basal levels probably through p38 mitogen-activated protein kinase and nuclear factor-kappa B signaling pathways. However, supplementary studies are needed in order to provide a basis for developing a new dietary supplementation strategy.},

   abstract = {Probiotics are derived from traditional fermented foods, from beneficial commensals or from the environment. They act through diverse mechanisms affecting the composition or function of the commensal microbiota and by altering host epithelial and immunological responses. Certain probiotic interventions have shown promise in selected clinical conditions where aberrant microbiota have been reported, such as atopic dermatitis, necrotising enterocolitis, pouchitis and possibly irritable bowel syndrome. However, no studies have been conducted that can causally link clinical improvements to probiotic-induced microbiota changes. Whether a disease-prone microbiota pattern can be remodelled to a more robust, resilient and disease-free state by probiotic administration remains a key unanswered question. Progress in this area will be facilitated by: optimising strain, dose and product formulations, including protective commensal species; matching these formulations with selectively responsive subpopulations; and identifying ways to manipulate diet to modify bacterial profiles and metabolism.},

The etiology of the disease includes environmental and genetic factors. Its management presents a constant challenge for gastroenterologists and conventional surgeon. 5-Amninosalicylates, antibiotics, steroids, and immune modulators have been used to reduce the symptoms and for maintenance of remission. Unfortunately, long-term usage of these agents has been found to lead to severe toxicities, which are deterrent to the users. Pre-clinical studies carried out in the recent past have shown that certain dietary agents, spices, oils, and dietary phytochemicals that are consumed regularly possess beneficial effects in preventing/ameliorating UC. For the first time, this review addresses the use of these dietary agents and spices in the treatment and prevention of IBD and also emphasizes on the mechanisms responsible for their effects.},

   abstract = {Inflammatory bowel diseases are chronic diseases affecting the gastrointestinal tract, whose major forms are represented by Crohn's disease (CD) and ulcerative colitis (UC). Their etiology is still unclear, although several factors have been identified as major determinants for induction or relapses. Among these, the role of the "forgotten organ", gut microbiota, has become more appreciated in recent years. The delicate symbiotic relationship between the gut microbiota and the host appears to be lost in IBD. In this perspective, several studies have been conducted to assess the role of prebiotics and probiotics in gut microbiota modulation. This is a minireview aimed to address in an easy format (simple questions-simple answers) some common issues about the theme. An update on the role of selected constituents of gut microbiota in the pathogenesis of IBD is presented together with the analysis of the efficacy of gut microbiota modulation by prebiotics and probiotics administration in the management of IBD.},

   abstract = {Mucosal surfaces represent the largest areas of interactions of the host with its environment. Subsequently, the mucosal immune system has evolved complex strategies to maintain the integrity of the host by inducing protective immune responses against pathogenic and tolerance against dietary and commensal microbial antigens within the broad range of molecules the intestinal epithelium is exposed to. Among many other specialized cell subsets, myeloid cell populations - due to their strategic location in the subepithelial lamina propria - are the first ones to scavenge and process these intestinal antigens and to send consecutive signals to other immune and non-immune cell subsets. Thus, myeloid cell populations represent attractive targets for clinical intervention in chronic inflammatory bowel diseases (IBDs) such as ulcerative colitis (UC) and Crohn's disease (CD) as they initiate and modulate inflammatory or regulatory immune response and shape the intestinal T cell pool. Here, we discuss the interactions of the intestinal microbiota with dendritic cell and macrophage populations and review in this context the literature on four promising candidate molecules that are critical for the induction and maintenance of intestinal homeostasis on the one hand, but also for the initiation and propagation of chronic intestinal inflammation on the other.},

   abstract = {OBJECTIVE: Stress is thought to be one of the triggers of relapses in patients with inflammatory bowel disease (IBD). We examined the rate of relapse in IBD patients before and after the Great East Japan Earthquake. DESIGN: A retrospective cohort study. SETTINGS: 13 hospitals in Japan. PARTICIPANTS: 546 ulcerative colitis (UC) and 357 Crohn's disease (CD) patients who received outpatient and inpatient care at 13 hospitals located in the area that were seriously damaged by the earthquake. Data on patient's clinical characteristics, disease activity and deleterious effects of the earthquake were obtained from questionnaires and hospital records. PRIMARY OUTCOME: We evaluated the relapse rate (from inactive to active) across two consecutive months before and two consecutive months after the earthquake. In this study, we defined 'active' as conditions with a partial Mayo score=2 or more (UC) or a Harvey-Bradshaw index=6 or more (CD). RESULTS: Among the UC patients, disease was active in 167 patients and inactive in 379 patients before the earthquake. After the earthquake, the activity scores increased significantly (p<0.0001). A total of 86 patients relapsed (relapse rate=15.8%). The relapse rate was about twice that of the corresponding period in the previous year. Among the CD patients, 86 patients had active disease and 271 had inactive disease before the earthquake. After the earthquake, the activity indices changed little. A total of 25 patients experienced a relapse (relapse rate=7%). The relapse rate did not differ from that of the corresponding period in the previous year. Multivariate analyses revealed that UC, changes in dietary oral intake and anxiety about family finances were associated with the relapse. CONCLUSIONS: Life-event stress induced by the Great East Japan Earthquake was associated with relapse in UC but not CD.},

   abstract = {BACKGROUND/AIMS: Little is known about the anti-colitis effect of tryptophan or its metabolites. Here, the protective effect and its mechanism of tryptophan administration on dextran sulfate sodium -induced colitis in mice was studied. MATERIALS AND METHODS: Twenty C57black6 female mice were equally divided into the control group, and treatment group. The control group received a standard CE-2 diet, while the tryptophan group received a CE-2 diet containing 0.5% l-tryptophan. After one week on this diet, all mice were orally administered a solution of 3.5% dextran sulfate sodium for 12 days to induce colitis. Changes in body weight and bloody stool frequency were monitored during dextran sulfate sodium administration. At 12 days post initial dextran sulfate sodium administration, all mice were sacrificed and the histology of their colonic tissue was examined. The nitrotyrosine levels in colonic tissues in both groups, and nitrate and nitrite levels in the urine of the control group, the tryptophan group and the group of mice without dextran sulfate sodium administration was measured. RESULTS: The tryptophan group showed significantly attenuated body weight loss, bloody stool frequency and ameliorated histological changes of colitis. While tryptophan treatment significantly reduced nitrotyrosine level in the colonic tissues, there was no significant reduction in urine nitrate and nitrite levels compared with the (dextran sulfate sodium-induced) control group. CONCLUSION: Tryptophan treatment ameliorated dextran sulfate sodium-induced colitis in this study. One of the anti-colitis mechanisms of tryptophan treatment is attributable to an anti-nitration effect, and may not be via the suppression of nitric oxide generation.},

   abstract = {BACKGROUND/AIMS: Crohn's disease (CD) and ulcerative colitis (UC) are both typified by an altered intestinal microbiota, and gene associations imply various defects in the mucosal barrier and in the innate immune response to bacteria. This review aims to assess how alterations in diet or use of modified bacteria could have therapeutic effects in CD or UC. METHODS: A MEDLINE search using the terms 'prebiotic', 'genetically modified bacteria', 'mucosal barrier in association with ulcerative colitis', 'Crohn's disease' or 'microbiota'. RESULTS: A large body of data from in vitro and animal studies shows promise for therapeutic approaches that target the microbiota. Approaches include dietary supplementation with fermentable fibres (prebiotics) and soluble fibres that block bacterial-epithelial adherence (contrabiotics), enhancement of the mucosal barrier with phosphatidylcholine, and use of genetically modified bacteria that express IL-10 or protease inhibitors. Vitamin D supplementation also shows promise, acting via enhancement of innate immunity. Clinical trials have shown benefit with enterically delivered phosphatidylcholine supplementation in UC and near-significant benefit with vitamin D supplementation in CD. CONCLUSION: Strategies that target the microbiota or the host defence against it appear to be good prospects for therapy and deserve greater investment.},

   abstract = {Metabolomics is the emerging science of measurement and analysis of metabolome--the complete set of low molecular weight compounds in a cell, tissue, organ or whole organism. One of the aims of metabolomics is to research the response of an organism to a pathophysiological insult by measuring the concentrations of small molecule metabolites in biofluids and tissues and its dynamics. Intestinal microbiota is most probably involved in the development and maintenance of autoimmune inflammation in ulcerative colitis and celiac disease. Gas chromatography-mass spectrometry (GC - MS) of serum generates comprehensive metabolic profiles, reflecting integrated human (systemic) and gut microbial metabolism which may be altered in disease states. The aim of this study was to investigate GC - MS-based serum metabolomic profiles in UC and CD patients. Serum metabolic profiles were collected from 75 individuals: 20 patients with mild-moderate active UC, 35 CD patients, and 20 healthy controls (HC). We characterized 84 serum metabolites by use GC-MS. 18 metabolites at least have a combined (human + microbial) origin. In serum of UC patients, phenylacetic acid (PAA), 4-hydroxyphenylacetic acid (4-HPAA), 3-indolylacetic acid (IAA), succinic acid (SA) and fumaric acid (FA) were the metabolites most prominently increased, whereas 3-phenylpropionic acid (PPA) was significantly decreased. Serum of CD patients showed significant increases in IAA, 3-indolepropionic acid (IPA), SA and FA. Increased serum levels of succinic acid suggest its possible damaging effect on intestinal mucosa especially in ulcerative colitis. Orally administered butyrate + inulin as supplement to mesalazine in UC or gluten free diet in CD was effective in reducing disease activity with a marked improvement of serum metabolomic profiles (including SA reduction) and gut microbiota in both diseases. There were no any adverse events.},

On each occasion his symptoms developed following the consumption of the herbal weight loss supplement Hydroxycut Hardcore X. On this admission, a (CT) scan demonstrated bowel wall thickening and peri-colonic fat stranding in the sigmoid colon. On flexible sigmoidoscopy, a continuous length of congested mucosa with multiple small ulcers was seen extending up to the mid-transverse colon, in keeping with ulcerative colitis. Histological analysis of biopsies was taken at the time and confirmed this. He was started on steroids early during his admission but this only provided a transient clinical improvement. The addition of cyclosporine, which was later changed to azathioprine, did not improve his condition either. He therefore underwent an open subtotal colectomy with end ileostomy. He made a slow but steady recovery and was discharged 3 weeks later.},

   abstract = {BACKGROUND: Differences between populations might be reflected in their different genetic risk maps to complex diseases, for example, inflammatory bowel disease. We here investigated the role of known inflammatory bowel disease-associated single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) in a subset of patients with ulcerative colitis (UC) from the Northeastern European countries Lithuania and Latvia and evaluated possible epistatic interactions between these genetic variants. METHODS: We investigated 77 SNPs derived from 5 previously published genome-wide association studies for Crohn's disease and UC. Our study panel comprised 444 Lithuanian and Latvian patients with UC and 1154 healthy controls. Single marker case-control association and SNP-SNP epistasis analyses were performed. RESULTS: We found 14 SNPs tagging 9 loci, including 21q21.1, NKX2-3, MST1, the HLA region, 1p36.13, IL10, JAK2, ORMDL3, and IL23R, to be associated with UC. Interestingly, the association of UC with previously identified variants in the HLA region was not the strongest association in our study (P = 4.34 x 10, odds ratio [OR] = 1.25), which is in contrast to all previously published studies. No association with any disease subphenotype was found. SNP-SNP interaction analysis showed significant epistasis between SNPs in the PTPN22 (rs2476601) and C13orf31 (rs3764147) genes and increased risk for UC (P = 1.64 x 10, OR = 2.44). The association has been confirmed in the Danish study group (P = 0.04, OR = 3.25). CONCLUSIONS: We confirmed the association of the 9 loci (21q21.1, 1p36.13, NKX2-3, MST1, the HLA region, IL10, JAK2, ORMDL3, and IL23R) with UC in the Lithuanian-Latvian population. SNP-SNP interaction analyses showed that the combination of SNPs in the PTPN22 (rs2476601) and C13orf31 (rs3764147) genes increase the risk for UC.},

MATERIALS AND METHODS: A total of 38 (28 Male; 10 Female) hospitalized patients with moderate or severe IBD (13 with Crohn's disease (CD); 25 with Ulcerative colitis (UC)) were included. At stage 1, the disease severity, clinical symptoms and, signs, food consumption and nutritional status by using subjective global assessment (SGA) were recorded. At stage 2, the patients were blindly randomized into a Study Group and Controls. In the Study Group, a standard enteral product was added into the regulated hospital diets, but for the Controls, deficits were regulated by only hospital diets for 3 weeks. the independent variables were the group, the disease and its activity, age, Body body mass index (BMI), weight loss history, the hospitalization period; the dependent variables were SGA, bowel movements, change in nutritional status, disease severity, clinical findings, and also consumption of macronutrients. RESULTS: Prevalance of malnutrition (SGA-B or SGA-C) for all the patients was 92.1% at the beginning and 71.1% at the end of study. Improvements in disease activity score for the patients with UC were statistically significant in both the Study Group and the Controls (p=0.006 for the Study Group and p=0.001 for the Controls, respectively). Macronutrients, total and water soluble fiber consumption levels improved, with statistically significant differences for all the groups. CONCLUSION: The prevalence of malnutrition is a major problem in patients with IBD. Not only the regulation of hospital food, but also enteral nutritional support, improved their levels of malnutrition, as well as their energy, macronutrients, and fiber consumption, and SGA is an easy method for nutritional monitoring.},

The fermented sauces, particularly FSeS, significantly suppressed DSS-induced body weight loss, increased colon length, and decreased colon weight/length ratios. Histological observations suggested that the fermented sauces prevented edema, mucosal damage, and the loss of crypts induced by DSS compared to the control mice and animals fed AHSS. FSeS and FSS decreased the serum levels of tumor necrosis factor-alpha (TNF-alpha), interferon-gamma (IFN-gamma), interleukin (IL)-6, and IL-17alpha. mRNA expression of these cytokines as well as that of inducible nitric oxide synthase (iNOS) and cyclooxygenase-2 (COX-2) in colon mucosa was also inhibited by the two sauces. Our results suggest that fermented sauces, especially FSeS, exert an anticolitic effect partially by reducing the serum levels of proinflammatory cytokines and inhibiting the mRNA expression of these factors in the colon tissue of mice treated with DSS. However, AHSS did not protect against DSS-induced colitis. In addition, low-dose treatment (4 mL/kg) with the fermented sauces resulted in greater anticolitic effects than consumption of a high quantity (8 mL/kg) of the sauces.},

   abstract = {Inadequate dietary intake of the essential trace element selenium (Se) is thought to be a risk factor for several chronic diseases associated with oxidative stress and inflammation. Biological actions of Se occur through low-molecular weight metabolites and through selenoproteins. Several key selenoproteins including glutathione peroxidases; selenoproteins M, P, and S; and selenium-binding protein 1 have been detected in the intestine. Interestingly, Se and antioxidant selenoproteins are known to modulate differentiation and function of immune cells and contribute to avoid excessive immune responses. This review discusses the role of Se and intestinal selenoproteins in inflammatory bowel diseases, based on data from human, animal, and in vitro studies. In humans, Se deficiency is commonly observed in patients with Crohn's disease. In animal models of experimental colitis, the Se status was negatively correlated with the severity of the disease. While the cause-effect relationship of these observations remains to be clarified, the beneficial outcome of dietary Se supplementation and an optimization of selenoprotein biosynthesis in murine inflammatory bowel disease models have led to investigations of targets and actions of Se in the gastrointestinal tract. The Se status affects gene expression, signaling pathways, and cellular functions in the small and large intestine as well as the gut microbiome composition. This data, particularly from animal experiments, hold promise that adequate dietary Se supply may counteract chronic intestinal inflammation in humans.},

   abstract = {BACKGROUND: The role of diet in inflammatory bowel disease (IBD) is supported by migration studies and increasing incidences in line with Westernisation. AIM: To give a complete overview of studies associating habitual diet with the onset or relapses in ulcerative colitis (UC) or Crohn's disease (CD). METHODS: A structured search in Pubmed, the Cochrane Library and EMBASE was performed using defined key words, including only full text papers in English language. RESULTS: Forty-one studies were identified, investigating onset (n = 35), relapses (n = 5) or both (n = 1). Several studies reported high intake of sugar or sugar-containing foods (n = 7 UC, n = 12 CD), and low intake of fruits and/or vegetables (n = 5 UC, n = 10 CD) to be associated with an increased onset risk. However, these findings could not be confirmed by similar or higher numbers of other studies. A possible protective role was found for grain-derived products in CD onset, but results were inconsistent for dietary fibre in UC and CD and grain-derived products in UC. No definite conclusions could be drawn for unsaturated fatty acids (UFA), protein and energy intake due to limited and/or inconsistent results. Six studies reported on diet and relapse risk, of which only two (n = 1 UC, n = 1 CD) had a prospective follow-up. CONCLUSIONS: The current evidence is not sufficient to draw firm conclusions on the role of specific food components or nutrients in the aetiology of IBD. Furthermore, large prospective studies into the role of habitual diet as a trigger of relapses are needed, to identify new therapeutic or preventive targets.},

METHODS: Twenty-nine consecutive patients (mean age: 11.2 years; range: 4.6-17 years; F/M: 15/14) with newly diagnosed UC were randomized either to receive a CMP elimination diet (n = 14) or to continue a free diet (n = 15) associated with concomitant steroid induction and mesalazine maintenance treatment. Children were prospectively evaluated at four time points: within 1 month, 6 months and 1 year after diagnosis or at the time of relapse. RESULTS: Twenty-five of the 29 enrolled patients responded to the UC induction therapy with a complete remission (86.2%), 13 belonging to CMP elimination diet group and 12 to free diet group (p = 0.59). Overall, our data showed that 7 of 13 (53.8%) patients treated with CMP elimination diet and 8 of 15 (53.3%) patients on free diet and UC therapy relapsed within 1 year of follow-up (p = 1). CONCLUSIONS: In conclusion, data of this paediatric, randomized trial suggest that CMP elimination has no role in the management of UC in non-sensitized children.},

   abstract = {BACKGROUND AND AIMS: Inhibition of lymphocyte trafficking by treatment with an anti-alpha4 integrin antibody has been clinically validated as a therapeutic approach for inflammatory bowel disease (IBD), and the orally effective 'anti-alpha4 integrin therapy' may be more convenient in clinical practice. The aim of this study was to investigate the pharmacological profile and anti-inflammatory effect of a novel, orally active small molecule alpha4 integrin antagonist, AJM300. METHODS: The binding specificity/potency of HCA2969 (the active metabolite of AJM300) were investigated in vitro. The pharmacodynamics for alpha4 integrin antagonism of AJM300 was investigated in mice. The anti-inflammatory effect of AJM300 fed in a diet and the anti-alpha4 integrin monoclonal antibody was evaluated in a mouse colitis model induced by transfer of IL-10 deficient T cells. RESULTS: HCA2969 selectively inhibited the in vitro binding of alpha4 integrin (alpha4beta7/alpha4beta1) to the cell adhesion molecules. Oral treatment with AJM300 dose-dependently inhibited lymphocyte homing to Peyer's patches and increased the peripheral lymphocyte count in the same dose range. AJM300 dose-dependently prevented the development of experimental colitis in mice. A significant inhibition of colon weight increase was accompanied by inhibition of T-cell infiltration into the lamina propria of colon. The maximum efficacy of AJM300 (1% diet) was comparable to that achieved by the saturated alpha4 integrin blockade with antibody. CONCLUSIONS: Oral treatment with the selective small molecule alpha4 integrin antagonist (AJM300) prevented the development of colitis and its efficacy was comparable to that of the anti-alpha4 integrin antibody.},

   abstract = {Mechanisms responsible for derangements in Fe homeostasis in chronic inflammatory conditions are not entirely clear. The aim of the present study was to test the hypothesis that inflammation affects the expression of Fe-related proteins in the duodenum and monocytes of patients with chronic inflammatory disorders, thus contributing to dysregulated Fe homeostasis. Duodenal mucosal samples and peripheral blood monocytes obtained from patients with chronic inflammatory disorders, namely ulcerative colitis (UC), Crohn's disease (CD) and rheumatoid arthritis, were used for gene and protein expression studies. Hb levels were significantly lower and serum C-reactive protein levels were significantly higher in patients in the disease groups. The gene expression of several Fe-related proteins in the duodenum was significantly up-regulated in patients with UC and CD. In patients with UC, the protein expression of divalent metal transporter 1 and ferroportin, which are involved in the absorption of dietary non-haem Fe, was also found to be significantly higher in the duodenal mucosa. The gene expression of the duodenal proteins of interest correlated positively with one another and negatively with Hb. In patients with UC, the gene expression of Fe-related proteins in monocytes was found to be unaffected. In a separate group of patients with UC, serum hepcidin levels were found to be significantly lower than those in the control group. In conclusion, the expression of Fe-related proteins was up-regulated in the duodenum of patients with chronic inflammatory conditions in the present study. The effects appeared to be secondary to anaemia and the consequent erythropoietic drive.},

   abstract = {Ulcerative colitis (UC) is an inflammation-associated disease of the colon and rectum. The onset and progress of the disease are directly influenced by the nature of the intestinal microflora, the intestinal barrier function, and the immunological responses of the host. The epithelial invasion of pathogenic bacteria due to excess contact and/or barrier dysfunction is related to inflammation mediated by intestinal immune responses. Although the etiology of UC is not clearly understood, recent studies have shown a rising incidence of UC worldwide, and this phenomenon is more prominent in Asian countries and in Asian immigrants in Western countries. The increased prevalence of UC also contributes to an increased risk of developing colorectal cancer. Environmental factors, including changes in dietary habits, have been suggested as major risk factors of UC. A systematic review showed a negative association between UC risk and vegetable intake, whereas total fat, omega-6 fatty acids and meat intake were positively associated with an increased risk of UC. Individual dietary factors and energy balance have been suggested as having important roles in inducing changes in the microbial population and intestinal barrier integrity and in regulating inflammatory immune responses, directly or indirectly. Excess energy intake is now known to increase pathogenic microbial populations. Likewise, the application of appropriate probiotics may reverse the pathogenic progression of the disease. In the meantime, dietary anti-inflammatory compounds, including omega-3 fatty acids and other phytochemicals, may directly suppress inflammatory responses in the course of UC development. In this review, the increased prevalence of UC and its management are interpreted from the standpoint of nutritional modulation to regulate the intestinal microflora population, intestinal epithelium permeability, and inflammatory responses.},

   abstract = {BACKGROUND: Inflammatory bowel disease (IBD) is characterized by chronic intestinal inflammation in the absence of a recognized etiology. The primary therapies are medications that possess anti-inflammatory or immunosuppressive effects. Given the high use of complementary alternative medicines in pediatric IBD, a prospective tolerability study of curcumin, an herbal therapy with known anti-inflammatory effects, was conducted to assess possible dosage in children with IBD. METHODS: Prospectively, patients with Crohn disease or ulcerative colitis in remission or with mild disease (Pediatric Crohn's Disease Activity Index [PCDAI] <30 or Pediatric Ulcerative Colitis Activity Index [PUCAI] score <34) were enrolled in a tolerability study. All patients received curcumin in addition to their standard therapy. Patients initially received 500 mg twice per day for 3 weeks. Using the forced-dose titration design, doses were increased up to 1 g twice per day at week 3 for a total of 3 weeks and then titrated again to 2 g twice per day at week 6 for 3 weeks. Validated measures of disease activity, using the PUCAI and PCDAI, and the Monitoring of Side Effect System score were obtained at weeks 3, 6, and 9. RESULTS: All patients tolerated curcumin well, with the only symptom that was consistently reported during all 3 visits being an increase in gassiness, which occurred in only 2 patients. Three patients saw improvement in PUCAI/PCDAI score. CONCLUSIONS: This pilot study suggests that curcumin may be used as an adjunctive therapy for individuals seeking a combination of conventional medicine and alternative medicine.},

   abstract = {Recent advances in parallel genomic processing and computational mapping have been applied to the native human microbial environment to provide a new understanding of the role of the microbiome in health and disease. In particular, studies of the distal gut microbiome have proposed that changes in gut microbiota are related to obesity, the metabolic syndrome, and Western diet. We examined the changes in the distal gut microbiome composition as it relates to the lean and obese phenotypes, particularly after surgical weight loss. A PubMed search of publications from January 1, 2005, through December 31, 2012, used the search terms weight, obesity, microbiome, and bariatric surgery. We included studies that provided information on subjects' weight and/or body mass index and a formal assessment of the microbiome. Certain bacteria, specifically the archaeon Methanobrevibacter smithii, have enhanced ability to metabolize dietary substrate, thereby increasing host energy intake and weight gain. With weight loss, there is a decrease in the ratio of Firmicutes to Bacteroidetes phyla. One major finding from microbial sequencing analyses after Roux-en-Y gastric bypass is the comparative overabundance of Proteobacteria in the distal gut microbiome, which is distinct from the changes seen in weight loss without Roux-en-Y gastric bypass. This review provides the practicing surgeon with (1) an update on the state of a rapidly innovating branch of clinical bioinformatics, specifically, the microbiome; (2) a new understanding of the microbiome changes after Roux-en-Y gastric bypass and weight loss; and (3) a basis for understanding further clinical applications of studies of the distal gut microbiome, such as in Crohn disease, ulcerative colitis, and infectious colitis.},

Few studies address whether extra-virgin olive oil (EVOO) intake suppresses inflammation, cell proliferation and signal transducers and activators of transcription (STAT) in the experimental colitis model. The aim of this study was to assess whether a 5% EVOO suppressed inflammation, increased cell proliferation and the expressions of STAT3 and STAT3 phosphorylation (pSTAT3) in dextran sulfate sodium (DSS)-induced colitis. Rats were administered DSS via drinking water (weight percentage: 4%) for 1 week with a 1-week recovery period for three cycles. Rats were divided into three groups: control group, standard diet without DSS; DSS group, standard diet+DSS; and DSS+EVOO group, EVOO diet (weight percentage: 5%)+DSS. Rats were sacrificed 5 weeks after DSS was first administered, and colonic damage was histologically and biochemically evaluated. As a result, chronic feeding of 5% EVOO attenuated inflammation. This was evaluated using a disease activity index, body weight loss and a histological score. Enhanced expressions of STAT3, pSTAT3, COX-2 and iNOS by DSS was attenuated by EVOO. In addition, EVOO attenuated increases in cell proliferation (PCNA) caused by DSS and recovered decreases in apoptosis (cleaved caspase-3). In conclusion, the study indicated that chronic feeding of 5% EVOO inhibited chronic inflammation in DSS-induced colitis in rats and also attenuated cell proliferation and recovered apoptosis in DSS colitis.},

However, patients may experience a higher incidence of complications following surgery in the context of immunosuppressive therapy and prior malabsorption. Therefore, if surgery is performed, careful patient selection and individualization of technique are essential.

   abstract = {Whole-grain foods such as oats may protect against colorectal cancer and have benefits on inflammatory bowel disease and coeliac disease. The present study aimed to systematically review the literature describing intervention studies that investigated the effects of oats or oat bran on risk factors for bowel disease. A literature search was conducted using Embase, Medline and the Cochrane library, which identified 654 potential articles. Thirty-eight articles describing twenty-nine studies met the inclusion criteria. Two studies carried out in participants with a history of colorectal adenomas found no effects of increased oat-bran intake on indirect risk makers for colorectal cancer. One of two interventions with oat bran in patients with ulcerative colitis showed small improvements in the patients' conditions. Most of the eleven studies carried out in adults with coeliac disease showed no negative effects of uncontaminated oat consumption. The fourteen studies carried out in volunteers with no history of bowel disease suggest that oats or oat bran can significantly increase stool weight and decrease constipation, but there is a lack of evidence to support a specific effect of oats on bowel function compared with other cereals. A long-term dietary intake of oats or oat bran could benefit inflammatory bowel disorders, but this remains to be proven. A protective effect on colorectal adenoma and cancer incidence has not yet been convincingly shown. The majority of patients with coeliac disease could consume up to 100 g/d of uncontaminated oats, which would increase the acceptability of, and adherence to, a gluten-free diet.},

   abstract = {BACKGROUND: In animal models, excess luminal iron exacerbates colonic inflammation and cancer development. Moreover, in inflammatory bowel disease (IBD) patients with mild to moderate disease activity dietary fortificant iron intake is inversely related to quality of life. Here we sought to determine whether dietary iron intakes were also related to quality of life in IBD patients in remission. METHODS: Forty eight patients with ulcerative colitis (UC), 42 of which had quiescent disease during this observational study, and 53 healthy control subjects completed quality of life questionnaires and 7-day food diaries. For comparative analysis, 34/group were matched and the linear relationship between dietary iron intakes (total, haem, non-haem or fortificant) and EuroQol quality of life measures was investigated. For UC patients the linear relationship between dietary iron intakes and the scores from the disease specific inflammatory bowel disease questionnaire (IBDQ) was also considered. RESULTS: The intake of dietary iron, and its various sub-fractions, were not associated with quality of life (EuroQol) in patients with quiescent disease or in healthy control subjects. The picture was similar for the 42 quiescent UC patients when disease-specific IBDQ was used. However, the 6 patients who relapsed during the study again showed an inverse association between IBDQ and dietary iron intake (p = 0.03). CONCLUSIONS: Our data suggest that dietary iron does not impact on quality of life in quiescent UC patients but support that, once the disease is triggered, luminal iron may be a permissive factor for exacerbation of disease activity resulting in lower quality of life.},

   abstract = {Patients with inflammatory bowel disease (IBD) have an increased risk of 10%-15% developing colorectal cancer (CRC) that is a common disease of high economic costs in developed countries. The CRC has been increasing in recent years and its mortality rates are very high. Multiple biological and biochemical factors are responsible for the onset and progression of this pathology. Moreover, it appears absolutely necessary to investigate the environmental factors favoring the onset of CRC and the promotion of colonic health. The gut microflora, or microbiota, has an extensive diversity both quantitatively and qualitatively. In utero, the intestine of the mammalian fetus is sterile. At birth, the intestinal microbiota is acquired by ingesting maternal anal or vaginal organisms, ultimately developing into a stable community, with marked variations in microbial composition between individuals. The development of IBD is often associated with qualitative and quantitative disorders of the intestinal microbial flora (dysbiosis). The healthy human gut harbours about 10 different bacterial species distributed in colony forming units which colonize the gastrointestinal tract. The intestinal microbiota plays a fundamental role in health and in the progression of diseases such as IBD and CRC. In healthy subjects, the main control of intestinal bacterial colonization occurs through gastric acidity but other factors such as endoluminal temperature, competition between different bacterial strains, peristalsis and drugs can influence the intestinal microenvironment. The microbiota exerts diverse physiological functions to include: growth inhibition of pathogenic microorganisms, synthesis of compounds useful for the trophism of colonic mucosa, regulation of intestinal lymphoid tissue and synthesis of amino acids. Furthermore, mucus seems to play an important role in protecting the intestinal mucosa and maintaining its integrity. Changes in the microbiota composition are mainly influenced by diet and age, as well as genetic factors. Increasing evidence indicates that dysbiosis favors the production of genotoxins and metabolites associated with carcinogenesis and induces dysregulation of the immune response which promotes and sustains inflammation in IBD leading to carcinogenesis. A disequilibrium in gut microflora composition leads to the specific activation of gut associated lymphoid tissue. The associated chronic inflammatory process associated increases the risk of developing CRC. Ulcerative colitis and Crohn's disease are the two major IBDs characterized by an early onset and extraintestinal manifestations, such as rheumatoid arthritis. The pathogenesis of both diseases is complex and not yet fully known. However, it is widely accepted that an inappropriate immune response to microbial flora can play a pivotal role in IBD pathogenesis.},

Rats were randomly divided into three groups: control, acetic acid, and acetic acid+curcumin. Curcumin (100 mg/kg per day, intragastrically) was administered 10 days before the induction of colitis and was continued for two additional days. Acetic acid-induced colitis caused a significant increase in the macroscopic and microscopic tissue ranking scores as well as an elevation in colonic myeloperoxidase (MPO) activity, malondialdehyde (MDA) levels, and the number of apoptotic epithelial cells in colon tissue compared to controls. In the rat colon, immunoreactivity of phospho-p38 MAPK was increased, whereas the phospho-JNK activity was decreased following the induction of colitis. Curcumin treatment was associated with amelioration of macroscopic and microscopic colitis sores, decreased MPO activity, and decreased MDA levels in acetic acid-induced colitis. Furthermore, oral curcumin supplementation clearly prevented programmed cell death and restored immunreactivity of MAPKs in the colons of colitic rats. The results of this study suggest that oral curcumin treatment decreases colon injury and is associated with decreased inflammatory reactions, lipid peroxidation, apoptotic cell death, and modulating p38- and JNK-MAPK pathways.},

   abstract = {The etiology of inflammatory bowel diseases which include ulcerative colitis (UC) and Crohn disease has not yet been clarified. Several hypotheses suggest a change in composition of gut microflora along with an impaired mucosal barrier that lead to excessive mucosal immunologic responses. Increased production of nitric oxide (NO) contributes greatly to the tissue injury caused by chronic inflammation. Evidence indicates that the mucus layer covering the epithelium is altered during UC and experimental colitis. Our aim in this study was to investigate the potential therapeutic effect of probiotic during DSS-induced colitis by modulating the immune system and colonic mucus production. For that purpose, the probiotic formulation Ultrabiotique((R)) (Lactobacillus acidophilus, Bifidobacterium lactis, Lactobacillus plantarum and Bifidobacterium breve) was administered daily for 7 d to mice with colitis. Probiotic supplementation improved clinical symptoms and histological alterations observed during DSS induced colitis. Ultrabiotique((R)) treatment down regulated the NO production by peritoneal macrophages of DSS-treated mice and enhanced mucus production in both DSS-treated and healthy mice. In conclusion, the modification of microflora by the Ultrabiotique((R)) played a beneficial role in maintaining the integrity of the intestinal mucosal barrier and promoted tissue repair.},

SUBJECTS/METHODS: Anthropometry, body composition, dietary intake, eating habits and grip strength were assessed with bedside methods in 168 patients from outpatient gastroenterology clinics (n, median (IQR) years; Crohn's disease (CD): n=53, 14.2 (11.6:15.4); ulcerative colitis (UC): n=27, 12.2 (10.7:14.2); coeliac disease: n=31, 9.3 (7.5:13.6); other GastroD: n=57, 9.8 (7.2:13.8)) and compared with 62 contemporary healthy controls (n, median (IQR): 9.8 (6.9:13.8)) and the results of the recent UK, National Diet and Nutritional Survey (NDNS). RESULTS: Children with CD had lower BMI z-scores than controls (median (IQR): -0.3 (-0.9:0.4) vs 0.3 (-0.6:1.4); P=0.02) but only 2% were classified as thin (BMI z-score <-2 s.d.). The prevalence of obesity in children with UC was 19%, 6% in CD, 11% in children with other GastroD and 15% in controls. No difference was found in grip strength measurement between groups. Except for CD children, the proportion of patients with suboptimal micronutrient intake was similar to that of controls and the cohort of children from the latest NDNS. A higher proportion of children with CD had suboptimal intake for riboflavin, vitamin B6 and calcium and consumed significantly more meat products, juices (including carbonated drinks), spreads/jams and crisps and savoury snacks and significantly fewer portions of dairy, fish, fruits and vegetables compared with healthy controls. CONCLUSIONS: GastroD affect children's body composition, growth, strength, dietary intake and eating habits, particularly CD, but to a lesser extent than expected.},

This study investigated the effects of substitution of linoleic acid with long chain n-3 polyunsaturated fatty acids and hence decreasing n-6:n-3 fatty acid ratio on inflammatory response in dextran sulfate sodium induced colitis. Male weanling Sprague Dawley rats were fed diets with n-6:n-3 fatty acid in the ratios of 215,50,10 or 5 for 3 months and colitis was induced by administration of dextran sulfate sodium in drinking water during last 11 days. Decreasing the dietary n-6:n-3 fatty acid ratio to 10 and 5 significantly attenuated the severity of colitis as evidenced by improvements in clinical symptoms, reversal of shortening of colon length, reduced severity of anemia, preservation of colonic architecture as well as reduced colonic mucosal myeloperoxidase activity. This protection was associated with suppression of colonic mucosal proinflammatory mediators such as TNFalpha, IL-1beta and nitric oxide. These findings suggest that long chain n-3 polyunsaturated fatty acids at a level of 3.0 g/kg diet (n-6:n-3 ratio of 10) prevents dextran sulfate sodium induced colitis by suppressing the proinflammatory mediators.},

   abstract = {BACKGROUND AND OBJECTIVES: The sudden change in the dietary habits of the Japanese population towards a European/American-style diet since the 1960s is thought to be responsible for the recent increase in the incidence of inflammatory bowel disease (IBD) in Japan. Dietary fatty acid intake influences the fatty acid profiles of vital cell membranes, which might be a source of inflammatory mediators. METHODS: We investigated the fatty acid composition of the erythrocyte membrane in 90 healthy Japanese and 43 initial-onset IBD patients (ulcerative colitis, UC: 25; Crohn's disease, CD: 18) who had not undergone any dietary intervention to examine the role fatty acids play in the onset of IBD. RESULTS: The erythrocyte membrane n-3/n-6 ratio of the initial-onset IBD patients was 0.42 +/- 0.13, which was not significantly different from that of the healthy Japanese subjects (0.41 +/- 0.13). However, the CD patients displayed a significantly lower mean percentage weight (MPW) of linoleic acid (LA) than the healthy subjects (8.25 +/- 1.75 vs. 9.90 +/- 1.29; p < 0.001), while their MPW of arachidonic acid (AA) was significantly higher than those of the healthy subjects and UC patients (11.22 +/- 2.18 vs. 9.76 +/- 1.64, p < 0.01; vs. 9.58 +/- 1.97, p < 0.01, respectively). The mean delta 6-desaturation index of the CD patients was significantly higher than that of the healthy subjects (1.61 +/- 0.65 vs. 1.11 +/- 0.26; p < 0.001). CONCLUSIONS: The CD patients displayed significantly higher and lower MPW of AA and LA, respectively, than the healthy subjects, suggesting that delta 6-desaturase is hyperactivated in CD. The cell membrane fatty acid profile might be a therapeutic target in CD.},

However, little is known regarding its effects in dextran sulfate sodium (DSS)-induced colitis, which are related to dysfunction of intestinal immunity. The aim of the present study was to investigate the effects of WBMs in an animal model of DSS-induced colitis. Male, 4-week-old ICR mice (n=10 per group) were fed a normal diet with or without 10% WBM for 4 weeks, and colitis was induced by 3% DSS in drinking water for 7 days. WBMs prevented DSS-induced shortening of colon length (P=.033) and diminished diarrhea (P=.049) and gross bleeding (P=.001), resulting in a decreased disease activity index. Results of histological analysis showed that WBMs suppressed mucosal damage. In addition, WBMs attenuated the DSS-induced increase in myeloperoxidase activity (P=.012) and upregulation of proinflammatory cytokine tumor necrosis factor-alpha (P=.020) in the colon segment. Taken together, these findings suggest a possible role for the WBM as an immunomodulator that can prevent and/or treat ulcerative colitis.},

   abstract = {BACKGROUND: Ulcerative colitis (UC) is often associated with nutritional deficiency, which appears to contribute to the progression of UC severity. The present study aimed to evaluate nutritional status and dietary intake in UC remission patients. METHODS: The present study comprised a cross-sectional study in which variables such as extent of disease (distal colitis, left-sided colitis, pancolitis), remission period, sex and age were recorded. Extent of disease was assessed by the results of a colonoscopy and dietary intake was evaluated by using 3-day, 24-h recalls. A Kruskall-Wallis test was used to compare the intake of macro- and micronutrients among the three study groups. The analysis was complemented by the Mann-Whitney test. A logistic regression analysis was performed to identify predictive factors of extent of disease (pancolitis versus left-sided colitis versus distal colitis). RESULTS: The median (range) age of the 59 patients was 49.0 (37.0-63.0) years and 53.3% were female. Twenty-six (44.1%) patients had distal colitis, 11 (18.6%) patients had left-sided colitis and 22 (37.3%) patients had pancolitis. A high probability of an inadequate intake of fibre (100%), fat soluble vitamins (>40% for vitamin A and >95% for vitamin E), vitamin C (>34%), calcium (>90%) and magnesium (>50%) was identified in the study group. Vitamin D intake (odds ratio = 0.60; 95% confidence interval = 0.39-0.94; P < 0.05) was significantly associated with increased intestinal damage. CONCLUSIONS: A large number of individuals showed an inadequate intake of nutrients. In addition, the consumption of vitamin D was significantly associated with extent of disease.},

   abstract = {OBJECTIVES: The purpose of the present study was to determine the incidence of inflammatory bowel disease (IBD) and its subgroups in children in northeastern Slovenia (NE Slovenia) during the period 2002-2010, and to assess the phenotypic characteristics at the diagnosis and during the follow-up. METHODS: A retrospective investigation was conducted on a cohort of newly diagnosed children and adolescents with IBD ages 0 to 18 years between 2002 and 2010 and residing in NE Slovenia. The phenotypic characteristics were determined at presentation and during follow-up. The location of Crohn disease (CD) and ulcerative colitis (UC) was assessed according to the Paris classification at diagnosis, and later in patients who had a follow-up period >2 years. The type of therapy at diagnosis and during follow-up, and the need for surgery were determined. The study covered approximately one-third of the total pediatric population (0-18 years). RESULTS: In total, 107 cases of IBD were diagnosed during the study period. The mean annual incidence (per 100,000) was 7.6 (95% confidence interval [CI] 6.3-9.2) for all IBD, 4.6 (95% CI 3.6-5.9) for CD, and 2.8 (95% CI 1.9-3.8) for UC. The incidences of total IBD, CD, and UC increased from 5.7 (3.8-8.2), 3.9 (2.3-6.1), and 1.8 (0.8-3.5) in the period 2002-2004, respectively, to 8.9 (6.3-12.2), 5.0 (3.1-7.6), and 3.4 (1.9-5.6) in the period 2008-2010, respectively. During the follow-up, the proportion of complicated CD disease behavior (stricturing/penetrating) had doubled. A total of 18.5% of patients with CD underwent bowel surgery. CONCLUSIONS: The incidence of childhood IBD in the northeastern part of the country is high and comparable with that reported from the developed western countries of Europe, and is probably still increasing. This increase may be the result of changes in the lifestyle, especially in dietary habits during the last 20 years.},

   abstract = {BACKGROUND: In 2007, leading international experts in the field of inflammatory bowel disease (IBD) recommended intravenous (IV) iron supplements over oral (PO) ones because of superior effectiveness and better tolerance. We aimed to determine the percentage of patients with IBD undergoing iron therapy and to assess the dynamics of iron prescription habits (IV versus PO). METHODS: We analyzed anonymized data on patients with Crohn's disease and ulcerative colitis extracted from the Helsana database. Helsana is a Swiss health insurance company providing coverage for 18% of the Swiss population (1.2 million individuals). RESULTS: In total, 629 patients with Crohn's disease (61% female) and 398 patients with ulcerative colitis (57% female) were identified; mean observation time was 31.8 months for Crohn's disease and 31.0 months for ulcerative colitis patients. Of all patients with IBD, 27.1% were prescribed iron (21.1% in males; 31.1% in females). Patients treated with steroids, immunomodulators, and/or anti-tumor necrosis factor drugs were more frequently treated with iron supplements when compared with those not treated with any medications (35.0% versus 20.9%, odds ratio, 1.94; P < 0.001). The frequency of IV iron prescriptions increased significantly from 2006 to 2009 for both genders (males: from 2.6% to 10.1%, odds ratio = 3.84, P < 0.001; females: from 5.3% to 12.1%, odds ratio = 2.26, P = 0.002), whereas the percentage of PO iron prescriptions did not change. CONCLUSIONS: Twenty-seven percent of patients with IBD were treated with iron supplements. Iron supplements administered IV were prescribed more frequently over time. These prescription habits are consistent with the implementation of guidelines on the management of iron deficiency in IBD.},

   abstract = {Curcumin belongs to the family of natural compounds collectively called curcuminoids and it possesses remarkable beneficial anti-oxidant, anti-inflammatory, anti-cancer, and neuroprotective properties. Moreover it is commonly assumed that curcumin has also been suggested as a remedy for digestive diseases such as inflammatory bowel diseases (IBD), a chronic immune disorder affecting the gastrointestinal tract and that can be divided in two major subgroups: Crohn's disease (CD) and Ulcerative Colitis (UC), depending mainly on the intestine tract affected by the inflammatory events. The chronic and intermittent nature of IBD imposes, where applicable, long-term treatments conducted in most of the cases combining different types of drugs. In more severe cases and where there has been no good response to the drugs, a surgery therapy is carried out. Currently, IBD-pharmacological treatments are generally not curative and often present serious side effects; for this reason, being known the relationship between nutrition and IBD, it is worthy of interesting the study and the development of new dietary strategy. The curcumin principal mechanism is the suppression of IBD inflammatory compounds (NF-kappaB) modulating immune response. This review summarizes literature data of curcumin as anti-inflammatory and anti-oxidant in IBD, trying to understand the different effects in CD e UC.},

   abstract = {BACKGROUND & AIMS: Osteopenia and increased risk for fractures in IBD result from several factors. AIM OF THE STUDY: To investigate the dietary intake of calcium in IBD patients. METHODS: A 22-item quantitative validated frequency food questionnaire was used for quantifying dietary calcium in relation to gender and age, in 187 IBD patients, 420 normal- and 276 diseased controls. STATISTICAL ANALYSIS: Mann-Whitney, chi-square- and T-tests. RESULTS: The mean calcium intake was 991.0 +/- 536.0 (105.8% Recommended Daily Allowances) and 867.6 +/- 562.7 SD mg/day (93.8% RDA) in healthy and diseased controls, and 837.8 +/- 482.0 SD mg/day (92.7% RDA) in IBD, P<0.001. Calcium intake was high in celiac disease (1165.7 +/- 798.8 SD mg/day, 120% RDA), and non-significantly lower in ulcerative colitis than in Crohn's disease (798.7 +/- 544.1 SD mg/day vs 881.9 +/- 433.0). CD and UC females, but not males, had a mean calcium intake well under RDA. In all study groups the intake was lower in patients believing that consumption of lactose-containing food induced symptoms, versus those who did not (105.8% vs 114.3% RDA in normal controls; 100.4% vs 87.6% RDA in IBD). CONCLUSIONS: Diet in IBD patients contained significantly less calcium than in healthy controls. Gender and age, more than diagnosis, are central in determining inadequate calcium intake, more so in IBD. Self-reported lactose intolerance, leading to dietary restrictions, is the single major determinant of low calcium intake. Inadequate calcium intake is present in one third of IBD patients and represents a reversible risk factor for osteoporosis, suggesting the need for tailored nutritional advice in IBD.},

   abstract = {Ulcerative colitis (UC) is an inflammatory bowel disease that causes gastrointestinal lesions, bleeding, diarrhoea and nutritional complications. Insufficient nutrient intake can additionally deteriorate nutritional status. The present cross-sectional study aimed to determine whether UC patients adhere to national dietary guidelines and to assess their dietary habits. An online questionnaire (n 93) was used to assess health-related conditions, current nutritional knowledge, professional dietary guidance and food avoidance. A 24 h dietary recall (n 81) was used to assess nutrient intakes, which were then compared with the national recommended intake values. The results showed that the nutritional knowledge of participants was limited with unofficial sources being used, including websites. Numerous food groups, predominantly fibre-rich foods and fruit and vegetables, were largely avoided by the participants. Almost half of the study population eliminated foods such as dairy products to alleviate symptoms, possibly unnecessarily. Energy intakes were significantly (P< 0.05) lower than the national recommended intake values in women aged 18-65 years and men aged 18-60 years. Fat intake exceeded the national recommended intake values (P< 0.0001), at the expense of carbohydrate and fibre intakes, which were significantly (P< 0.005) lower than the national recommended intake values. Protein intake was significantly high in women aged 19-50 years (P< 0.00) and men aged 19-50 years (P< 0.005). Vitamin C, vitamin B12 and Ca intake levels were overachieved by all participants (P< 0.001), while women aged 19-50 years did not achieve their dietary Fe reference nutrient intake levels (P< 0.001). Osteopaenia, osteoporosis and anaemia were reported by 12, 6 and 31 % of the participants, respectively. Findings indicate that food avoidance may contribute to nutrient deficiencies in UC patients. Low intakes of these food groups, especially during remission, are preventing patients from adhering to dietary guidelines.},

   abstract = {Ulcerative colitis is frequently an intermediate step to colon cancer. The interleukin-10 knockout mouse is a genetic model of this progression. We report that knockout mice fed 5% black raspberries (BRB) had significantly less colonic ulceration as compared with knockout mice that consumed the control diet. Dysfunction of the Wnt signaling pathway is a key event in ulcerative colitis-associated colon carcinogenesis. Therefore, we investigated the effects of BRBs on the Wnt pathway and found that the BRB-fed knockout mice exhibited a significantly lower level of beta-catenin nuclear translocation. We followed-up this observation by evaluating the effect of BRBs on selected Wnt pathway antagonists. The mRNA expression levels of wif1, sox17, and qki were diminished in the knockout mice, whereas they were expressed at normal levels in knockout mice that were fed BRBs. The lower mRNA expression of these genes in the colon from the knockout mice correlated with hypermethylation of their promoter regions; BRBs decreased their promoter methylation and increased mRNA expression of these genes. This hypomethylation was associated with elevated protein expression of key proteins/enzymes that augment methylation, for example, dnmt3b, hdac1, hdac2, and mbd2 in the knockout mice; in addition, BRBs decreased the protein expression of these proteins/enzymes. The knockout mouse model recapitulates what occurs in human ulcerative colitis. Promoter methylation of CDH1 and SFRP1 was significantly higher in human ulcerative colitis tissues compared with their adjacent normal tissues. In conclusion, our results suggest that BRBs inhibit colonic ulceration and, ultimately, colon cancer partly through inhibiting aberrant epigenetic events that dysregulate Wnt signaling.},

   abstract = {UNLABELLED: Ulcerative colitis (UC) is characterized by chronic inflammation of the colon. During inflammation, NF-kappaB is increased in colonic epithelial cells and in immune cells, leading to increases in proinflammatory cytokines. These events then increase DNA methyltransferases (DNMTs), which silence a subset of tumor suppressor genes by promoter methylation. Negative regulators of the Wnt pathway are frequently methylated in UC, leading to dysregulation of the pathway and, potentially, to colorectal cancer. We determined if black raspberries (BRBs) influence promoter methylation of suppressors in the Wnt pathway in dextran sodium sulfate (DSS)-induced UC. C57BL/6J mice received 1% DSS and were fed either control or 5% BRB diets. Mice were euthanized on days 7, 14 and 28, and their colons, spleen and bone marrow were collected. Berries reduced ulceration at day 28. This was accompanied by decreased staining of macrophages and neutrophils and decreased NF-kappaB p65 nuclear localization in the colon at all time points. At day 7, BRBs demethylated the promoter of dkk3, leading to its increased messenger RNA (mRNA) expression in colon, spleen and bone marrow. beta-Catenin nuclear localization, c-Myc staining as well as protein expression of DNMT3B, histone deacetylases 1 and 2 (HDAC1 and HDAC2) and methyl-binding domain 2 (MBD2) were all decreased in colon; mRNA expression of these four proteins was decreased in bone marrow cells by BRBs. These results suggest that BRBs suppress colonic ulceration by correcting promoter hypermethylation of suppressor genes in the colon, as well as in the spleen and bone marrow that systematically regulate inflammation. SUMMARY: Our results suggest that dietary BRBs suppress colonic ulceration by correcting promoter hypermethylation of suppressor genes in the colon, as well as in the spleen and bone marrow that systematically regulate inflammation in DSS-induced UC.},

   abstract = {BACKGROUND: Ulcerative colitis is a chronic inflammatory disease and involves multiple etiological factors. Acetic acid (AA)-induced colitis is a reproducible and simple model, sharing many characteristics with human colitis. N-acetylcysteine (NAC) has been widely used as an antioxidant in vivo and in vitro. NAC can affect several signaling pathways involving in apoptosis, angiogenesis, cell growth and arrest, redox-regulated gene expression, and inflammatory response. Therefore, NAC may not only protect against the direct injurious effects of oxidants, but also beneficially alter inflammatory events in colitis. This study was conducted to investigate whether NAC could alleviate the AA-induced colitis in a porcine model. METHODS: Weaned piglets were used to investigate the effects of NAC on AA-induced colitis. Severity of colitis was evaluated by colon histomorphology measurements, histopathology scores, tissue myeloperoxidase activity, as well as concentrations of malondialdehyde and pro-inflammatory mediators in the plasma and colon. The protective role of NAC was assessed by measurements of antioxidant status, growth modulator, cell apoptosis, and tight junction proteins. Abundances of caspase-3 and claudin-1 proteins in colonic mucosae were determined by the Western blot method. Epidermal growth factor receptor, amphiregulin, tumor necrosis factor-alpha (TNF-alpha), and toll-like receptor 4 (TLR4) mRNA levels in colonic mucosae were quantified using the real-time fluorescent quantitative PCR. RESULTS: Compared with the control group, AA treatment increased (P < 0.05) the histopathology scores, intraepithelial lymphocyte (IEL) numbers and density in the colon, myeloperoxidase activity, the concentrations of malondialdehyde and pro-inflammatory mediators in the plasma and colon, while reducing (P < 0.05) goblet cell numbers and the protein/DNA ratio in the colonic mucosa. These adverse effects of AA were partially ameliorated (P < 0.05) by dietary supplementation with NAC. In addition, NAC prevented the AA-induced increase in caspase-3 protein, while stimulating claudin-1 protein expression in the colonic mucosa. Moreover, NAC enhanced mRNA levels for epidermal growth factor and amphiregulin in the colonic mucosa. CONCLUSION: Dietary supplementation with NAC can alleviate AA-induced colitis in a porcine model through regulating anti-oxidative responses, cell apoptosis, and EGF gene expression.},

   abstract = {AIM: To evaluate potential risk factors in the development of ulcerative colitis (UC) in China. METHODS: A total of 1308 patients with UC and 1308 age-matched and sex-matched controls were prospectively studied in China. The UC cases were collected from 17 hospitals in China from April 2007 to April 2010. Uniform questionnaires were designed to investigate risk factors including smoking, appendectomy, stress, socio-economic conditions, nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drugs (NSAIDs), oral contraceptives, diet, breastfeeding, infections and family sanitary conditions. Group comparisons by each factor were done using simple logistic regression analysis. Conditional logistic regression was used for multivariate analysis. RESULTS: By univariate analysis, the variables predictive of UC included feeling stress, light and heavy alcoholic drinking, spicy food, sugar consumption and infectious diarrhea, while heavy tea intake and tap water consumption were protective against UC. On multivariate analysis, the protective factor for UC was tap water consumption [odds ratios (OR) = 0.424, 95%CI: 0.302-0.594, P < 0.001]; while the potential risk factors for UC were heavy sugar consumption (OR = 1.632, 95%CI: 1.156-2.305, P < 0.001), spicy food (light intake: OR = 3.329, 95%CI: 2.282-4.857, P < 0.001; heavy intake: OR = 3.979, 95%CI: 2.700-5.863, P < 0.001), and often feeling stress (OR = 1.981, 95%CI: 1.447-2.711, P < 0.001). Other factors, such as smoking habit, appendectomy, breastfeeding, a history of measles, rural or urban residence, education, oral contraceptives, and NSAID use have not been found to have a significant association with the development of UC in the present study. CONCLUSION: Our study showed tap water consumption was a protective factor for UC, while spicy food, heavy sugar consumption and often feeling stress were risk factors for UC in this Chinese population.},

   abstract = {BACKGROUND: Dietary fiber may favorably influence fermentation, gastrointestinal inflammation, and disease progression in Crohn's disease, ulcerative colitis (UC), and pouchitis and offer an attractive therapeutic addition to pharmacological treatment. This systematic review appraised data from randomized controlled trials of fiber in the management of inflammatory bowel disease. METHODS: The review followed Cochrane and PRISMA recommendations. Seven electronic databases were searched along with hand searching and contacting experts. Inclusion criteria were randomized controlled trials of the effects of fiber on clinical endpoints (primarily disease activity for treatment or maintenance) or physiological outcomes in patients with inflammatory bowel disease. RESULTS: In total, 23 randomized controlled trials fulfilled the inclusion criteria (UC, 10; Crohn's disease, 12; and pouchitis, 1) recruiting 1296 patients. In UC, 3/10 studies reported fiber supplementation to benefit disease outcomes. In Crohn's disease, 0/12 studies and in pouchitis 1/1 study reported a benefit on disease activity. Despite this, a number of studies reported favorable intragroup effects on physiological outcomes including fecal butyrate, fecal calprotectin, inflammatory cytokines, microbiota, and gastrointestinal symptom indices. Meta-analysis was not possible. CONCLUSIONS: There is limited weak evidence for the efficacy of fiber in improving disease outcomes in UC and pouchitis. The potential antiinflammatory role of fiber is intriguing and merits further investigation in adequately powered clinical trials. Excluding overt gastrointestinal obstruction, there was no evidence that fiber intake should be restricted in patients with inflammatory bowel disease.},

   abstract = {PURPOSE OF REVIEW: There is direct evidence that the pathogenesis of inflammatory bowel disease (IBD) involves the gastrointestinal microbiota and some evidence that the microbiota might also play a similar role in irritable bowel syndrome (IBS). The aim of this article is to review the emerging evidence for the mechanisms and effectiveness of probiotics in the management of these disorders. RECENT FINDINGS: The composition of the gastrointestinal microbiota is strongly influenced by factors including age, diet and disease. Probiotics may be effective through their impact on the host gastrointestinal microbiota and promotion of mucosal immunoregulation. Probiotics are considered to be well tolerated, although the quality of studies and health claims has been variable. There are many short-term studies demonstrating the effectiveness of probiotics in IBS, although recommendations should be made for specific strains and for specific symptoms. Within IBD, a number of trials have shown the benefits of a range of probiotics in pouchitis and in ulcerative colitis, although current evidence in Crohn's disease is less promising. SUMMARY: Clearly, some probiotics have considerable potential in the management of IBS and IBD; however, the benefits are strain specific. High-quality trials of probiotics in gastrointestinal disorders as well as laboratory investigations of their mechanism of action are required in order to understand who responds and why.},

The aim of the study was the evaluation of lactase, saccharase, and maltase activity in patients with IBD. MATERIALS AND METHODS: The study comprised 65 children, aged 3-18 years. During a routine endoscopy, we took biopsies from the descending part of the duodenum. In these biopsies, we determined disaccharidase activity using Dahlquist's method. RESULTS: Decreased lactase activity in the biopsies taken from the small intestine mucosa was most frequently observed in patients with Crohn's disease (5/15-33%) and least frequently seen in children with lymphocytic colitis (in 1/10-10%). The lowest mean values of lactase activity were found in the children with Crohn's disease and ulcerative colitis (1.7-2.5 U/1 g). Decreased saccharase activity in the biopsies obtained from the small intestine mucosa was most frequently observed in patients with lymphocytic colitis (in 5/10-50%) and ulcerative colitis (9/20-45%) and least frequently seen in children with non-specific undetermined colitis (in 7/20-35%). Decreased maltase activity in the small bowel mucosa was the most frequently observed in patients with Crohn's disease (in 5/15-33%) and least frequently seen in children with ulcerative colitis (in 3/20-15%). The lowest mean values of maltase activity were found in the children with Crohn's disease (5.4 U/1 g). CONCLUSION: Therefore, it seems reasonable to perform diagnostic examinations aimed at lactose, saccharose, and maltose intolerance and to initiate a dietary regimen in children with IBD.},

   abstract = {The peptide transporter PEPT1, expressed in the brush border membrane of enterocytes, mediates the uptake of di- and tripeptides from luminal protein digestion in the small intestine. PEPT1 was proposed not to be expressed in normal colonic mucosa but may become detectable in inflammatory states such as Crohn's disease or ulcerative colitis. We reassessed colonic expression of PEPT1 by performing a systematic analysis of PEPT1 mRNA and protein levels in healthy colonic tissues in mice, rats, and humans. Immunofluorescence analysis of different mouse strains (C57BL/6N, 129/Sv, BALB/c) demonstrated the presence of PEPT1 in the distal part of the colon but not in proximal colon. Rat and human intestines display a similar distribution of PEPT1 as found in mice. However, localization in human sigmoid colon revealed immunoreactivity present at low levels in apical membranes but substantial staining in distinct intracellular compartments. Functional activity of PEPT1 in colonic tissues from mice was assessed in everted sac preparations using [(1)(4)C]Gly-Sar and found to be 5.7-fold higher in distal compared with proximal colon. In intestinal tissues from Pept1-/- mice, no [(1)(4)C]Gly-Sar transport was detectable but feces samples revealed significantly higher water content than in wild-type mice, suggesting that PEPT1 contributes to colonic water absorption. In conclusion, our studies unequivocally demonstrate the presence of PEPT1 protein in healthy distal colonic epithelium in mice, rats, and humans and proved that the protein is functional and contributes to electrolyte and water handling in mice.},

The role of dietary interventions and enteral nutrition in the management of IBD remains unelucidated. This study was to review the current evidence for dietary risk factors for the development of IBD and the efficacies of dietary and enteral interventions. RECENT FINDINGS: High dietary intakes of total fats, polyunsaturated fatty acids, omega-6 fatty acids, and meat are associated with an increased risk of Crohn's disease and ulcerative colitis. Further prospective studies are required to confirm these observations. Among various dietary interventions, none has shown striking efficacy. Meta-analyses have shown enteral nutrition to be inferior to corticosteroids in adults with active Crohn's disease. However, in children, a meta-analysis has shown no significant difference in the remission rates between enteral nutrition and corticosteroid therapy. Although the evidence level is not striking, enteral nutrition may be useful for maintaining remission in patients with quiescent Crohn's disease. SUMMARY: Dietary risk factors for IBD and the therapeutic benefit of dietary and enteral interventions need to be confirmed by further well designed studies in large cohorts of patients.},

   abstract = {BACKGROUND: Patients with inflammatory bowel disease, which includes ulcerative colitis and Crohn's disease, are at a significantly increased risk of developing colorectal cancer, and aberrant interleukin (IL)-6/STAT3 signaling pathway exists in both inflammatory bowel disease and inflammation-related gastrointestinal cancers. We have previously found that oroxylin A inhibited the NF-kappaB signaling in human colon tumor HCT-116 cells. However, whether oroxylin A could inhibit the colitis-associated carcinogenesis remains to be determined. METHODS: HCT-116 cells were treated with various concentrations of oroxylin A. Expression of relative proteins of IL-6/STAT3 signaling pathway was assayed by Western blot and immunofluorescence analysis. Mouse model for colitis-associated colorectal cancer was induced by a combined treatment with 10 mg/kg azoxymethane (AOM) followed by 3 cycles of 2.5% dextran sodium sulfate in C57BL/6 mice. IL-6 and IL-1beta gene expression were analyzed by quantitative real-time PCR. Expression of relative proteins was examined by immunohistochemistry and Western blot. RESULTS: Oroxylin A effectively inhibited IL-6/STAT3 pathway in human HCT-116 cells, and the effect of oroxylin A was reversible. Dietary administration of oroxylin A throughout the experimental period significantly reduced the tumor burden, inhibited cell proliferation, and induced apoptosis in colon carcinomas. The expression of inflammatory cytokines IL-6 and IL-1beta decreased in tumors in oroxylin A-treated mice. The IL-6/STAT3 signaling pathway was attenuated in oroxylin A-treated mice. CONCLUSIONS: Our results demonstrated that oroxylin A inhibits colitis-associated carcinogenesis through modulating IL-6/STAT3 pathway in AOM/dextran sodium sulfate mouse model and in HCT-116 cells.},

Strong evidence indicates n-3 PUFAs are beneficial as a dietary supplement in certain diseases such as rheumatoid arthritis; however for other conditions such as asthma, the data are less robust. A clearer understanding of the pharmacology of n-3 PUFAs will help to establish targets to modulate chronic inflammatory diseases.},

   abstract = {This article describes a novel qualitative study exploring the lived experience of participants having undergone ileoanal pouch failure, on a background of ulcerative colitis (UC). It focuses on the impact of living with indefinite diversion of the pouch and a permanent end ileostomy. Six participants were interviewed with an aim to establish their experience of pouch failure and the support they required. Five pertinent themes emerged that suggested participants did not expect pouch failure and were unprepared for the regression towards UC. Some participants recommenced drug therapy, wore pads to manage leakage from the diverted pouch, avoided certain social settings or manipulated diet and lifestyle in order to gain an acceptable quality of life with a permanent ileostomy. Pouch failure potentially presents adverse effects on patients' quality of life, but currently there is a deficit in support and resources available in order to provide acceptable outcomes for patients experiencing pouch failure.},

   abstract = {INTRODUCTION: Emerging evidence supports an immunologic role for 25-hydroxyvitamin D (25(OH)D) in inflammatory bowel disease (IBD). Here we examined if pretreatment vitamin D status influences durability of anti-tumor necrosis factor (TNF)-alpha therapy in patients with Crohn's disease (CD) or ulcerative colitis (UC). METHODS: All IBD patients who had plasma 25(OH)D level checked <3 months prior to initiating anti-TNF-alpha therapy were included in this retrospective single-center cohort study. Our main predictor variable was insufficient plasma 25(OH)D (<30 ng/mL). Cox proportional hazards model adjusting for potential confounders was used to identify the independent effect of pretreatment vitamin D on biologic treatment cessation. RESULTS: Our study included 101 IBD patients (74 CD; median disease duration 9 years). The median index 25(OH)D level was 27 ng/mL (interquartile range, 20-33 ng/mL). One-third of the patients had prior exposure to anti-TNF-alpha therapy. On multivariate analysis, patients with insufficient vitamin D demonstrated earlier cessation of anti-TNF-alpha therapy (hazard ratio [HR], 2.13; 95% confidence interval [CI], 1.03-4.39; P = .04). This effect was significant in patients who stopped treatment for loss of response (HR, 3.49; 95% CI, 1.34-9.09) and stronger for CD (HR, 2.38; 95% CI, 0.95-5.99) than UC (P = NS). CONCLUSIONS: Our findings suggest that vitamin D levels may influence durability of anti-TNF-alpha induction and maintenance therapy. Larger cohort studies and clinical trials of supplemental vitamin D use with disease activity as an end point may be warranted.},

   abstract = {Inflammatory bowel disease (IBD), most commonly ulcerative colitis (UC) and Crohn's disease (CD), is a chronic inflammation of the gastrointestinal tract. Patients affected with IBD experience symptoms including abdominal pain, persistent diarrhea, rectal bleeding, and weight loss. There is no cure for IBD; thus treatments typically focus on preventing complications, inducing and maintaining remission, and improving quality of life. During IBD, dysregulation of the intestinal immune system leads to increased production of pro-inflammatory cytokines, such as TNF-alpha and IL-6, and recruitment of activated immune cells to the intestine, causing tissue damage and perpetuating the inflammatory response. Recent biological therapies targeting specific inflammatory cytokines or pathways, in particular TNF-alpha, have shown promise, but not all patients respond to treatment, and some individuals become intolerant to treatment over time. Dietary peptides and amino acids (AAs) have been shown to modulate intestinal immune functions and influence inflammatory responses, and may be useful as alternative or ancillary treatments in IBD. This review focuses on dietary interventions for IBD treatment, in particular the role of dietary peptides and AAs in reducing inflammation, oxidative stress, and apoptosis in the gut, as well as recent advances in the cellular mechanisms responsible for their anti-inflammatory activity.},
