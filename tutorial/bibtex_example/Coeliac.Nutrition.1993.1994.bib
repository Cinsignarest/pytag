   abstract = {BACKGROUND: The extent to which the vagus nerve innervates the colon remains controversial. METHODS: In 29 rats the tracer cholera toxin-horseradish peroxidase was injected into the cecum, the ascending, transverse, or descending colon or the rectum. For comparison, control injections were made into the stomach. RESULTS: For all areas of colon except the rectum, brainstem motoneuronal labeling was limited to the lateral third of the dorsal motor nucleus of the vagus nerve bilaterally. In contrast, gastric injections resulted in motoneuronal labeling limited to the medial portions of the nucleus. The number of labeled motoneurons was greatest following injection of the cecum, and it significantly decreased for the more distal areas of the colon. Colonic motoneuron dendrites projected into the nucleus of the solitary tract and within the dorsal motor nucleus of the vagus nerve. Sensory afferent terminal labeling was limited to the commissural and medial subnuclei of the nucleus of the solitary tract. For the rectum, sensory and motor labeling was limited to the spinal cord. CONCLUSIONS: The distribution of labeling within the vagal complex indicates that all regions of the colon, except the rectum, are innervated by the celiac and accessory celiac branches of the vagus nerve.},

   abstract = {Twenty-one stable hospitalized cystic fibrosis patients with malabsorption syndrome participated in an open-label crossover clinical trial to evaluate the efficacy of two-period dosing regimens of a pancreatic microtablet enzyme preparation in the treatment of steatorrhea. Standard dosing consisted of 500 U lipase/kg body weight/meal, 250 U lipase/kg body weight/snack; high dosing consisted of 1,500 U lipase/kg body weight/meal, 750 U lipase/kg body weight/snack. Doses were determined by units of lipase/kg body weight to provide dosing consistency among patients of varying size. Each patient was on a regular diet of approximately 100 g of fat per day. Two separate, 72-h stool collections were performed between markers. A significant difference in mean percentage fat absorbed between the standard dose and the high dose was found (86% versus 91%, p < 0.05). Subjects were then stratified into two groups, based on the grams of fecal fat eliminated (GFFE) as follows: Group 1 with < or = 7 GFFE/24 h on both dosages (n = 7) and Group 2 with > 7 GFFE/24 h on either dose (n = 14). A significant difference (p < 0.05) between Group 1 (96%) and Group 2 (88%) was noted in the percentage fat absorbed while on the high dose. Fat absorption improved from 81% to 88%, (p < 0.05) in Group 2. During the study period, the adverse reactions of constipation or elevated serum uric acid levels were not observed. The increased doses of pancreatic enzymes resulted in improved correction of steatorrhea.},

   abstract = {Damage to the mucosal barrier may be assessed, non-invasively by use of sugar probes, which permeate through the transcellular or paracellular (tight junction) routes. A standardised test, with analysis of a five hour urine collection has proved useful in studying the sequelae of non-steroid anti-inflammatory drug (NSAID) administration, untreated coeliac disease, and enteric infections. Choice of probe molecule is crucial and lactulose/l-rhamnose seem to be satisfactory, in contrast with polyethylene glycol. Significant correlations have been seen between permeability and plasma IgA concentrates in nephropathy, and between permeability and the passage of neutrophil chemotactic agents. The increased permeability associated with NSAID treatment may relate to the adverse effects of NSAIDs on enterocyte mitochondrial morphology and metabolism. These two factors may predispose the mucosa to permeation of bacterial chemoattractant molecules that elaborate a local inflammatory response. A similar mechanism may operate in patients with untreated Crohn's disease, who show abnormally high permeability. Remission induced by treatment with elemental diets coincides with a reduction in permeability. The period to relapse correlated with the inability of patients to maintain low permeability to sugar probes. These results suggest a mechanism for the benefits of elemental enteral nutrients in the treatment of Crohn's disease.},

   abstract = {Serum gliadin antibodies (IgA/IgG) were determined in 191 consecutive children (median age, 2.75 years; range, 0.33-15.5 years) admitted for a small-intestinal biopsy on suspicion of celiac disease. The test was a diffusion-in-gel enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay (DIG-ELISA). Of these 191, 14 (7.3%) appeared to have untreated celiac disease. Depending on the choice of cut-off value of the test (combined determination of IgA and IgG), the sensitivity was 86-100%, the specificity was 97-99%, and the positive/negative predictive values were 70-92% and 99-100%, respectively. No variation according to age was found. Gliadin antibodies were determined in 47 children who had well-treated celiac disease. Fourteen of these children were also investigated when challenged with gluten. Gliadin antibodies (IgA or IgG) decreased significantly in 13 of 13 cases when the patients shifted from a gluten-containing diet to a gluten-free one. During the gluten challenge, the IgG and IgA increased in 14 of 14 and 11 of 14 cases, respectively (two patients suffered from IgA deficiency). In eight patients who later appeared to be free of celiac disease, the gliadin antibodies were determined on gluten-free diet and during gluten challenge; no significant differences in gliadin antibodies were found. We conclude that this test is useful in selecting patients with symptoms suggesting celiac disease for a small-intestinal biopsy. The test seems to be of some value in monitoring the effects of a gluten-free diet and during gluten challenge.},

   abstract = {To determine the relationship between pancreatic secretory capacity and nutritional status in celiac patients, we studied 52 patients with celiac disease (24 males, 28 females; age range 6-36 months) and 30 healthy control subjects (14 males, 16 females; age range 6-42 months). A secretin-cerulein test was performed on all patients, and levels of serum albumin and plasma fibronectin were assayed. In addition, weight/height ratios were calculated in the celiacs, who were then divided into three groups on this basis, as follows: celiacs with weight/height ratio < or = 3rd percentile; those with weight/height ratio between the 4th and 10th percentiles; and those with weight/height ratio > 10th percentile. There was no significant difference in the duodenal output of chymotrypsin, phospholipase and lipase between these groups. When the total celiac group was compared to control subjects, only lipase levels were significantly lower (P < 0.009). However, subnormal values in one or more pancreatic enzymes were observed in 15/52 celiacs (29%). A residual enzyme activity < 10% of normal secretory capacity, was also found in 4/52 patients. There was no correlation between the output of the various pancreatic enzymes and levels of albumin, fibronectin, and weight/height ratios in the patients. Furthermore, there was no difference in weight/height ratios and levels of albumin and fibronectin between the celiac subjects with pancreatic deficiency and those with normal pancreatic function. We conclude that a mild/moderate pancreatic insufficiency is quite frequent in celiacs, but that it may be completely independent of nutritional status; further studies are therefore required to shed light on its pathogenesis.},

Autoimmune diseases have been described in both conditions; the coexistence of DS and CD has been occasionally reported, but a clear relationship has not been definitely established. In this study we determined IgA antigliadin antibodies (IgA-AGA) in 155 children with DS, and the results were compared with those of the control groups formed by 320 children affected by upper-respiratory tract infections and 115 children with gastrointestinal symptoms but with normal jejunal mucosa. High IgA-AGA levels were found in 26% of DS patients, in 1% of the first control group and in 10% of the second control group. Such differences are statistically significant. Twenty-one DS patients with high IgA-AGA levels and gastrointestinal symptoms underwent jejunal biopsy, and total villous atrophy was found in seven of them (33.33%). HLA-DR and -DQ antigens were also determined in 75 DS patients (20 with high and 55 with normal IgA-AGA levels), and the percentages of the different phenotypes were compared in the two groups and with those of a control group. No statistically significant difference was found, but DR3, DR7, and DQ2 alleles were always present in DS patients with jejunal atrophy. Our study confirms the data reported in the literature about higher levels of IgA-AGA in DS patients and the relatively high incidence of CD in this group of patients.},

These included eight strong positives, eight positives, and five weak positives. One-hundred-thirty-four children had small bowel biopsies performed. Endomysial antibodies were found in all children with severe villous atrophy on a gluten-containing diet who were diagnosed as having coeliac disease. Three children with positive and four with weak-positive results did not have coeliac disease. One had partial villous atrophy consistent with the diagnosis of cow-milk-sensitive enteropathy and the others had a normal small bowel mucosa. This study confirms a strong association between endomysial antibodies and coeliac disease; however, not all cases with positive antibodies had the disease. At the present time, small bowel biopsy remains essential for the diagnosis of coeliac disease.},

The results showed that the DR1 allele, and the A1, B8, Cw7, DR3, DQw2; B35, Cw4, DR1, DQw1; and B14, DR1, DQw1 haplotypes could be involved with IgA-D susceptibility in RTIAG patients. Among the CD-IgA-D group, the B14 allele and A1, B8, Cw7, DR3, DQw2 haplotype were found to confer a high risk of developing IgA-D. A possible protective role may be postulated for DR2 and DR4 in both types of IgA-D patients. The present study confirms some of the previous findings in other white populations and describes new possible alleles and haplotypes that could be implicated with IgA-D susceptibility and resistance.},

   abstract = {OBJECTIVES: To evaluate the prevalence of malnutrition in patients with untreated coeliac disease (CD) according to their pattern of presentation, and the effect of gluten-free diet (GFD) upon nutritional status. DESIGN: Cohort prospective study. SETTING: All subjects were seen at the outpatient 'malabsorption' clinic of the Department of Medical Pathology I, University of Bologna (referral centre), Bologna. SUBJECTS: Eighty consecutive patients with CD (48 with classical and 32 with subclinical presentation), 15 patients with dermatitis herpetiformis (DH) and 40 healthy volunteers (members of the hospital staff). MAIN OUTCOME MEASURES: The nutritional status was evaluated by anthropometric measurements (percentage of ideal body weight for height and sex, percentage of standard triceps skinfold thickness and percentage of ideal arm-muscle circumference). RESULTS: The overall prevalence of malnutrition in our series of CD patients was 53%. Prevalence of malnutrition (actual body weight less than 90% of the ideal) was significantly higher in classical coeliacs (67%) than in subclinical ones (31%, P < 0.002), in patients with DH (13%, P < 0.0003) and in healthy volunteers (13%, P < 0.0001). At diagnosis, percentage values of ideal body weight, triceps skinfold thickness and arm-muscle circumference were significantly lower (P < 0.0001, P < 0.0002 and P < 0.0003, respectively) in classical coeliacs (84.5 +/- 10.6, 71.2 +/- 28.1 and 87.1 +/- 10.8, respectively) than in subclinical coeliacs (95.5 +/- 9.1, 105.6 +/- 41.0 and 94.8 +/- 10.6, respectively). After GFD, 33% of classical and only 3% of subclinical coeliacs were still malnourished. CONCLUSIONS: Prevalence of malnutrition in CD is lower than was previously thought. CD patients with classical presentation may require a longer period of GFD to achieve a significant improvement of their nutritional status, with respect to those with subclinical presentation, probably because of a greater extent of intestinal damage. Finally, a careful evaluation of dietary habits is usually sufficient to identify incomplete adherence to GFD as the reason for nonimprovement of the nutritional status in patients with CD.},

   abstract = {Carcinoma of the pancreas has a poor prognosis with a short survival time. Despite diagnostic advances, diagnosis is often delayed because early symptoms are frequently vague and non-specific. Symptomatic treatment is the only possibility in the large majority of patients with pancreatic cancer since curative surgical excision of the tumor is only possible in few cases. Symptoms managed, in the aim to improve the quality of life, include weight loss and anorexia, abdominal pain, jaundice secondary to biliary compression and digestives consequences of pancreatic surgery. Anorexia is a frequent complaint in patients with pancreatic cancer, and contributes to decreased caloric intake, weight loss and malnutrition. Patients who are unable to eat, due to obstruction or dysfunctional gastrointestinal tract, may benefit from enteral or parenteral nutrition. Patients whose main reason to not obtain adequate food intake is anorexia may benefit from recently developed pharmacologic strategies. Megestrol acetate often produce an improvement in appetite and weight gain in patients with advanced cancer. Jaundice can be treated by surgical biliary drainage or better still by palliative biliary endoprosthesis. Percutaneous transhepatic or endocopic biliary drainage are now well established methods for decompressing malignant biliary obstruction. Pain occurs in 80-85% of patients with advanced disease. Abdominal pain should be treated by oral non-narcotic analgesics, or, if necessary, potent narcotic analgesics, and sometimes by percutaneous block of the celiac ganglion, splancnicectomy or abdominal radiotherapy. Celiac plexus block with alcohol is the most common and well described therapy for the specific pain from carcinoma of the pancreas. Digestive consequences of pancreatic surgery also require symptomatic treatment.},

The mean height SD score showed increasing growth retardation in the year before diagnosis, relatively quick catch-up growth in the year after diagnosis, and complete catch-up in 2-3 years. Mean weight-for-height showed a progressive decrease 12-18 months before diagnosis, increased to a maximum at the end of the first year of therapy, and returned to normal 15 months after dietary treatment. Independent of age at diagnosis, initial degree of wasting, diagnostic delay, and strictness of gluten-free diet, catch-up growth was complete in this group of patients who were diagnosed before 9 years of age.},

It is commercially rated as a cereal, which has led to some misunderstanding concerning its use in gluten induced enteropathy or celiac disease. The effect of buckwheat flour ingestion by celiac patients was evaluated through the indirect immunofluorescence technique. Samples of serum were collected 30 days after the flour ingestion. Cryostat performed cuts of wheat and buckwheat grains were accomplished in order to compare the reactivity of their proteins and serum of celiac and normal patients. The assay revealed that the buckwheat flour presents no toxicity for the celiac patient and no anti-protein antibodies formation in the grain was observed for serum dilutions of 1:2 up to 1:32 with 0.15 M NaCl solution in 0.01 M phosphate buffer, pH 7.2 throughout the 30 day assay period. The results of the immunological assays showed that the buckwheat flour does not present toxic prolamines to celiac disease patients.},

In children with treated celiac disease, microvilli were statistically significantly shorter than those in children with transient gluten enteropathy and controls. Microvillous width in treated celiac disease was greater as compared with that in controls. There was no difference in the number of microvilli on the enterocyte surface in the three groups.},

   abstract = {Gut immunology encompasses the need for local cellular immunity and prevention of systemic immune reactions to dietary antigens. The relation between these factors and nutritional state or the presence of luminal nutrients in the enterally fed and parenterally fed is poorly defined. Most studies suggest that acquisition of lymphoid characteristics is independent of luminal nutrition and its responsiveness is related more to bacterial challenge. Protein malnutrition may impair immune responsiveness by moderating the generalised inflammatory response, rather than through reduced T cell function and IgA synthesis. Predisposition to the development of gut hypersensitivity can be induced in animals by longterm feeding with elemental diets. The efficient absorption of these diets reduces the caecal microflora burden and together with changed gastric acid secretion and small bowel motility, may affect the composition of the gut flora. Changed luminal nutrition, enhanced tissue damage and inappropriately increased mucosal T cell function may thus be related. The clinical effectiveness, however, of elemental diets in treatment of unresponsive coeliac disease is reassuring. To investigate intestinal immunity in humans, an approach based on whole gut lavage has been developed. Data from this non-invasive human technique will prove to be a useful means of assessing the effects of nutritional rehabilitation on mucosal immunity.},

One dominating fraction, designated Frazer III-2-VIII, was purified by several steps of rechromatography. It was markedly toxic to duodenal explants from patients with active celiac disease. The mean enterocyte height after culture was 15.9 microns compared with 25.6 microns in gluten-free medium. This difference was statistically significant in all cases except one, in which the lowest concentration (110 micrograms) was used. The in vitro toxicity of Frazer III-2-VIII was comparable with the toxicity of alpha-gliadin in twofold to fivefold higher concentrations. No toxicity could be detected in nonceliac explants (mean enterocyte height, 25.7 vs. 24.9 microns in gluten-free medium). The N-terminal amino acid sequence was (Gln)-Ile-Gln-Val-Phe-Pro-Ser-Gly-Gln-Val-Gln-(Trp)-Pro-Gln-Gln-(Gln)-Gl n-Pro- Phe-Pro. This sequence was not homologous to previously reported sequences of toxic gluten peptides. By use of the SwissProt and GenEMBL databases, it was concluded that the peptide Frazer III-2-VIII is part of the gamma-gliadin fraction.},

   abstract = {Celiac disease (CD) is a small intestinal disorder characterized by the malabsorption of most nutrients. Disease pathogenesis appears to be associated with immune-mediated pathology. Susceptibility is associated with genes coding for DQw2 class II molecules. In the present report we investigated T cell responses to A-gliadin (AGL), a major alpha-gliadin component known to activate disease. Gliadin-specific lines were generated from a CD patient and a normal donor. Three major points were revealed by the analysis of these T cells: (1) On the basis of mapping experiments using Epstein-Barr virus (EBV) lines and DR-transfected fibroblasts and DR-, DP-, and DQ-specific monoclonal antibodies (mAb), all responses appeared to be DR-restricted. Thus, in contrast to the strong association of disease susceptibility with DQ molecules, no DQ-restricted, gliadin-specific response was detectable. (2) Fine specificity analysis, using a panel of synthetic peptides spanning the entire alpha-gliadin component molecule, revealed that the clones derived from the normal donor were DR53-restricted and AGL 21-40-specific, while clones derived from the CD patient were DR7-restricted and peptide 1-20-specific. (3) Both whole AGL and AGL 1-20 were presented to the patient-derived clones with much higher efficiency by DDR-transfected fibroblasts than by EBV lines. These data suggested that fibroblasts processed this determinant efficiently, while EBV lines were unable to do so. Indeed, analysis of a panel of truncated AGL 1-20 analogs revealed that peptide AGL 1-8, which contained the minimal T cell epitope, was presented with equal efficiency by fixed or irradiated EBV and irradiated DR7-transfected fibroblasts.},

The reference values, established in terms of the percentiles 2.5 and 97.5, were 85-270 micrograms/dL for men and 112-385 micrograms/dL for women. The beta-carotene diagnostic usefulness was determined by comparison with stool fat levels. According to ROC curves, steatorrhea was diagnosed at beta-carotene values of less than 89 micrograms/dL and 103 micrograms/dL for men and women respectively with a 78% sensitivity, 82% specificity, 76% positive and 84% negative predictive values and 80% accuracy. The steatorrhea prevalence (stool fat > 5 g/day) in our patients was 42%. Due to the implicit technical difficulties of the stool fat determinations and the results of this study, we propose the serum quantification of beta-carotene as an useful screening test in patients with chronic diarrhea and malabsorption syndromes.},

Recent data suggest that there is an extended spectrum of gluten sensitivity that includes first-degree relatives and patients with latent celiac disease. Genetic studies have identified HLA DQ A1 *0501 B1 *0201 as the predominant HLA gene most tightly linked to this condition. Gliadin-specific T cell clones restricted by DQ have now been identified in the small intestine lamina propria. Such T cells may be important in mediating many of the features of the disease. This review discusses the interrelationship of genetics, cereal chemistry, environmental factors, and immunology involved in the pathogenesis of celiac disease and explores its relationship with other nutrient-induced enteropathies.},

   abstract = {Although malnourished children are stunted, their bone maturity is usually retarded to a comparable degree. This is seen in impoverished societies as well as in diseases such as coeliac disease, inflammatory bowel disease and hormonal deficiency. When these children are followed to adulthood they normally have some degree of spontaneous catch-up. With a change in environment, through adoption, emigration or with treatment of the disease there is usually definite catch-up growth, although it is often not to the NCHS standards. If puberty is delayed and/or growth continues into the early or mid twenties, then an acceptable final adult height is achieved. However, there may be a limitation imposed on an individual's maximum height by genetic imprinting in very early development. This may be the case where full catch-up appears to have taken place but is followed by an advanced puberty and early cessation of growth (Proos, Hofvander & Tuvemo, 1991a). The data from US slaves and cases of hormonal replacement, where treatment was initiated after age 18, each show that, if the circumstances of children in the Third World change, almost complete reversal of stunting is possible. The children can reach their own height potentials. Total reversal to affluent societal norms would probably require cross-generational catch-up. The most obvious reason why catch-up is not seen regularly is that an appropriate diet is not available over a sufficient period of time. We do not know the optimum ingredients for such a diet. Sulphur has been neglected as an essential nutrient; its economy should be examined in relation to skeletal growth in stunted populations.
PIP: Malnourished children are stunted with their bone maturity usually retarded to a comparable degree. Some degree of spontaneous catch-up is, however, usually observed when these children are followed to adulthood. Catch-up growth tends to result with a change in environment through adoption or emigration, or with treatment of the disease, albeit often not to NCHS standards. If puberty is delayed and/or growth continues into the early or mid-twenties, an acceptable final adult height is achieved. There may, however, be a limit imposed upon an individual's maximum height by genetic imprinting in very early development such as when full catch-up appears to have taken place, but is followed by an advanced puberty and early cessation of growth. Data on cases of hormonal replacement after age 18 years and for US slaves each show that almost complete reversal of stunting is possible among children in the Third World if their circumstances change. They can reach their own height potentials, although total reversal to affluent society norms would probably require cross-generational catch-up. Catch-up is not seen regularly because an appropriate diet is not available over a sufficient period of time. Finally, although optimum ingredients for such a diet are not known, it may be said that sulphur has been neglected as an essential nutrient.

   abstract = {The prevalence of lactose maldigestion is lowest in Scandinavia and Northwest Europe (3-8%) and close to 100% in most of Southeast Asia. In Europe the frequency increases in the southern and eastern directions, reaching 70% in southern Italy and Turkey. There is also a high prevalence of lactose maldigestion in the people of Africa with the exception of cattle-raising nomads. Lactose maldigestion causes uncharacteristic abdominal symptoms such as bloating, borborygmus, colic, flatulence, and diarrhea. The degree of discomfort depends on the amount of lactose consumed, but also on an individual sensitivity to lactose. The symptoms of irritable bowel syndrome (IBS) and lactose maldigestion are similar. Consequently, most investigations indicate an increased frequency of lactose maldigestion in patients suffering from IBS. Recurrent abdominal pain (RAP) in children corresponds to IBS in adults. Lactose maldigestion is a frequent cause of RAP in regions with a high prevalence of lactose maldigestion in early childhood. Diffuse small-intestinal damage in celiac disease or kwashiorkor leads to a proportional decrease of all disaccharidase activities, with the most pronounced being decrease of lactase. The consumption of milk may then cause abdominal discomfort and increased diarrhea. Several investigations have indicated an increased frequency of lactose maldigestion in patients with osteoporosis. A connection between lactose maldigestion and decreased absorption of calcium has not been proven, however. The increased tendency toward osteoporosis is more likely caused by a lower calcium intake because of milk intolerance. Milk and dairy products with reduced lactose content are better tolerated by patients with lactose maldigestion.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS)},

   abstract = {Zinc is present in and indispensable to all forms of life. Zinc is essential for the normal growth of human beings, and zinc proteins have been shown to be involved in the transcription and translation of the genetic material. Zinc deficiency has been incriminated in infertility, abortions, malformations, fetal intrauterine growth retardation, premature and postmature births, perinatal death, and abnormal deliveries with dystocia and placental ablation. Risk groups for developing zinc deficiency, which in turn might modify the expression of the underlying disease, are found among those with insufficient food intake, especially in protein malnutrition; abnormal mucosal uptake, as in celiac disease; abnormal intestinal losses, as in steatorrhea and inflammatory bowel disease; abnormal renal excretion, as in diabetes with insufficient metabolic control; alcoholism; and treatment with diuretic drugs. Zinc deficiency could be identified by means of fasting serum or plasma samples or the more laborious estimation of zinc in leucocytes or monocytes if sampling and handling is carefully performed and if stressful situations and acute-phase reactions as fever, delivery, or abortion are avoided. Zinc therapy in identified low-zinc groups has given favorable results and has reduced the frequencies of premature birth, placental ablation, perinatal death, and postmaturity. It is suggested, as we did in 1980, that these data are compatible with the presence of a zinc-deficiency syndrome in pregnancy, which includes increased maternal morbidity, abnormal taste sensations, abnormally short or prolonged gestations, inefficient labor, atonic bleeding, and increased risks to the fetus such as malformations, growth retardation, prematurity, postmaturity, and perinatal death.},

Nineteen blood samples and intestinal specimens from 13 children with celiac disease (eight samples taken before treatment, six during gluten-free diet, and five after gluten challenge) and samples from nine controls were studied. The proportion of gamma delta TCR+ lymphocytes was significantly higher both in the peripheral blood and the jejunal mucosa of the patients with celiac disease. A significant correlation was found between the percentage of peripheral gamma delta TCR+ cells and the density of gamma delta TCR+ cells in the lamina propria.},

   abstract = {Gastrointestinal injury involves oxidative damage as the result of oxygen-derived free radicals which are formed during the inflammatory reactions. Chylomicrons which are synthesized by the intestine can thus be exposed to lipid peroxidation in celiac disease. Similarly, low-density lipoprotein (LDL) propensity to oxidation may be enhanced as a result of a direct or indirect effect of the oxidative process. To resolve these possibilities, plasma chylomicrons and LDL were isolated from a patient with celiac disease and from a control healthy subject before and 3 h after a fat-rich meal, and their propensity to copper-induced lipid peroxidation was then analyzed. The patient's chylomicrons, its LDL that was obtained before the fat-rich meal and its LDL that was obtained after the meal demonstrated 220, 39 and 48% elevation in their content of thiobarbituric-acid-reactive substances in comparison with the control lipoproteins. After a complete recovery of the patient's intestine, the susceptibility of the patient lipoproteins to in vitro oxidation returned toward normal levels. In the patient LDL fraction (obtained either before or after the fat-rich meal), but not in the patient's chylomicrons, the carotenoid content was reduced by 70%, vitamin E by 45%, and the LDL content of arachidonic acid was increased by 70% in comparison with the control lipoproteins. On recovery of the patient and return of the intestine to its normal morphology, normalization of all of these constituents was achieved.},

Monozygotic twins appear to have a concordance for CD up to 71%. This paper reports a third case of late onset of CD in monozygotic twin girls. The twins were defined as monozygotic based upon paired clinical and laboratory examinations. Clinical examinations included genotypic, phenotypic and dermatoglyphic analysis, while laboratory examinations included HLA typing and blood groups. Following European Society of Pediatric Gastroenterology and Nutrition criteria, CD was diagnosed in both girls, though 4 years and 8/12 months apart. The twins achieved clinical, laboratory and histological remissions within 1 year, after the institution of a gluten-free diet. Genetic markers are undoubtedly the main precondition for CD development. Environmental factors, however, may play a more significant role in triggering the onset of disease.},

   abstract = {Celiac disease is characterized by hypersensitivity to the alcohol-soluble wheat proteins called gliadins. Total avoidance of gliadin is the lifelong treatment for such patients. However, wheat gliadins are often present as impurities in industrial starch commonly used in the preparation of different pharmaceutical products. Therefore, some drugs might contain gliadin, which can be dangerous for sensitive patients if taken in large amounts or used permanently. The purpose of this study was to develop a sensitive, reliable assay that is specific for the detection of gliadins in pharmaceutical products. Gliadins were extracted here using sodium dodecyl sulfate rather than 70% ethyl alcohol, which has been the traditional solvent. This gliadin extract was utilized in a dot-blot assay that incorporated an antigliadin antibody developed in rabbit and labeled with peroxidase. 4-Chloro-1-naphthol was used as a peroxidase-specific substrate. Isolated wheat gliadin was used as the positive control. Dilution experiments showed that the lower level of sensitivity for the assay was in the range of 0.0045 mg/ml of gliadin, which is a concentration level lower than that suggested for a gluten-free diet. The assay developed here revealed that 71.2% of 59 prescription and nonprescription drugs tested contained gliadin in the amount detected by our dot-blot assay. The prescription drugs tested were among the top 50 most frequently dispensed in U.S. community pharmacies. The nonprescription drugs were among those that constitute the largest sales in the United States. The results showed that the simple dot-blot assay developed here can be used for pharmaceutical testing performed either by hospital laboratories or by patients themselves.},

The BMC values of 33 celiac patients at diagnosis were significantly lower than those of 255 control subjects (P < 0.001). There was no difference between diabetic and non-diabetic celiac patients. In 14 patients the BMC increased significantly (P < 0.05, ANCOVA) after 1.28 y of GFD. In these patients the mean annual BMC increment was 0.07 g/cm, significantly greater (P < 0.05) than the increment of normal growing children (0.05 g.cm-1.y-1). Our data indicate that although osteoporosis complicates celiac disease during childhood and adolescence, GFD alone is able to remarkably improve bone mineralization.},

To evaluate a possible association with gluten ingestion, we then compared frequency of mucosal damage in patients on a gluten-containing diet and those on a gluten-free Diet (GFD). In children with CD, frequency of esophageal damage seen at endoscopy and of peptic esophagitis shown by histology were significantly lower than in non-CD patients (p < 0.01) due to the very low frequency of mucosal damage in CD children on GFD; however, frequency of columnar metaplasia was significantly higher (p < 0.05). At endoscopy, CD children had a significantly lower frequency of gastric abnormalities, but histology showed a higher prevalence of superficial chronic gastritis (SCG; p < 0.01). SCG was associated with gluten ingestion, since its frequency in CD children on GFD was similar to the frequency in non-CD patients. At endoscopy, frequency of duodenal mucosal damage was similar in CD and non-CD patients. In addition to villous atrophy, histology showed a significantly higher frequency of duodenitis in CD children on a gluten-containing diet (p < 0.001 vs. non-CD patients; p < 0.05 vs. CD children on GFD). Our findings show that the mucosa of the whole upper GI tract can be damaged in CD patients and that the prevalence of some changes is higher with a gluten-containing diet.},

   abstract = {Otto Heubner can be counted among the fathers of pediatry. Beginning as an autodidact, he became pediatrist by chance, holding the first university chair in Germany (1884) exclusively devoted to pediatry; he needed no Dr. med. habil. thesis. Observing the little patients was his primary interest; for the infants treated in the hospital he introduced "aseptic environments". Heubners main scientific achievements were the treatment of infectious and stomach-intestinal diseases. He described "Endarteritis syphilitica" and found Meningococci in the cerebrospinal fluid. "Serious deficiency of digestion" (Coeliac disease) became known through his work. Together with his friend M. Rubner he created the notion of EQ (Nutrition Quotient). Also, he realized the functional effects of orthotic albuminuria. Heubners centers of activity were Leipzig and Berlin, where he had a large community of followers; his successor, recommended by him, was A. Czerny.},

   abstract = {In recent years, the clinical spectrum of coeliac disease has changed and forms with mild aspecific symptoms are today frequent. Therefore many infants are submitted to jejunal biopsy in order to exclude coeliac disease or to allow an early diagnosis. This has led to a search for a simple and reliable diagnostic test of coeliac disease in order to limit the use of jejunal biopsy. Recent data suggest that the study of serum antigliadin, antireticulin and antiendomysium antibodies may possibly play the role. In this paper the working group on coeliac disease of the Groupe Francophone de Gastroenterologie et Nutrition Pediatriques expresses its view on the place of the dosages of these antibodies in the diagnosis and follow up procedures of coeliac disease in infants and children. At the present time, although it allows a simplification of the procedures, these dosages are presently not sufficiently reliable to serve as a substitute of jejunal biopsy.},

Serum lipids and Lp(a) concentrations were evaluated in 17 celiac patients (5 male and 12 female patients; age range, 1-24 years) when the diagnosis was established and after a 3-month gluten-free diet. Mean total and low-density lipoprotein cholesterol did not show significant change, while mean high-density lipoprotein cholesterol rose and triglycerides decreased significantly after the diet. The Lp(a) concentration remained unchanged in all patients (median values, 35 mg/L before and 40 mg/L after the diet). Our results suggest that, in our patients, the lipoprotein profile was influenced by the gluten-free diet, while the Lp(a) concentration was not modified.},

Seventeen of the patients were shown to have celiac disease. Twenty-six patients had gastroenteritis, postenteritis syndrome, and enteropathic cow's milk allergy, and one patient had sarcoidosis. At the time of diagnosis, 16 children with celiac disease showed a sonographically abnormal appearance of the small-bowel wall structure. In addition to hyperperistalsis, slight ascites, pericardial fluid, or liver tissue texture changes could be found in some of the patients. Relating the findings of abnormal small-bowel wall structures to the data of the small-bowel biopsy, we found a sensitivity of 94% and a specificity of 88% for sonographic detection of changes related to celiac disease. Our findings indicate that sonographic data can be of great help in exploring children with signs of malabsorption. These data provide a further argument for the decision to perform a biopsy of the small bowel.},

Furthermore, in active celiac disease, in which the number of IELs is significantly increased, a corresponding increase in the number of TIA-1 cells was found. These results indicate that whereas cytotoxicity of human IELs has been difficult to demonstrate, they contain at least one of the proteins associated with cytotoxicity, and a failure to demonstrate this function may be related to the in vitro assay system used.},

All patients were challenged with gluten for a minimum of 4 weeks to 4 years before a peroral proximal jejunal biopsy was performed between 1973 and 1976. The biopsy specimen showed changes consistent with coeliac disease in all patients. Gluten-free diet induced again clinical recovery and was recommended as a life-long diet. The patients were reinvestigated after 15-18 years (mean 17 years) and 13 biopsies were evaluated. Five of these biopsy specimens showed variable histopathological changes. Only 5 patients were still on a strict gluten-free diet. There was no correlation between the presence of gastro-intestinal symptoms and abnormal biopsies. All patients had haematological tests within the normal range. Anti-gliadin IgA levels above the upper normal limit were found in 2 out of 3 patients with grade IV histopathological changes in the mucosa, and in 1 of the patients on a normal diet who refused to have a biopsy performed. The patients' knowledge of their disease was evaluated, and suitable follow-up programs for coeliac patients are discussed.},

As it seemed likely that separation of fecal homogenate by centrifugation into a lipid phase, a watery phase, and a solid phase would be pH-dependent, we evaluated the effect of fecal acidification on steatocrit results. We also compared classical and acid steatocrit results in healthy children and in patients with cystic fibrosis and studied the relationship between two steatocrit methods and fecal fat content as measured by a reference chemical method. Steatocrit results increased with the degree of fecal acidification, and maximal results were obtained at the lowest fecal pH values. Means and SEM for classical and acid steatocrit values were 1.1 +/- 0.4% (classical) versus 3.8 +/- 1% (acid) in controls (n = 6) and 5.4 +/- 1.9% (classical) versus 26.9 +/- 4.3% (acid) in cystic fibrosis patients (n = 9). The correlations between fecal fat content measured chemically and steatocrit results were 0.18 (p = 0.35) and 0.81 (p < 0.0001) for classical and acid steatocrit, respectively. We conclude that acidification of fecal homogenates leads to a marked improvement in the steatocrit method.},

   abstract = {Celiac sprue, also termed celiac disease or gluten-sensitive enteropathy, is a chronic disease in which malabsorption of nutrients is caused by a characteristic, but nonspecific, lesion of the small-intestinal mucosa. The lesion is produced, through unclear mechanisms, by protein constituents of some cereal grains. Exclusion of wheat gluten and rye, barley, and oat prolamins from the diet results in a prompt improvement in absorption, along with reversion, toward normal, of the associated small-intestinal lesion. The spectrum of manifestations of celiac sprue is remarkably broad, but the severity of disease generally correlates with the length of small intestine that is damaged. When most or all of the small-intestinal mucosa is involved, symptoms are severe and malabsorption is generalized. In such patients, a diagnosis of celiac sprue is usually considered. When, on the other hand, the mucosal lesion is limited to the duodenum and proximal jejunum, overt gastrointestinal symptoms and steatorrhea may be absent. In those patients, clinical manifestations, if present at all, may reflect malabsorption of only one or two substances, notably iron and folate, that normally are absorbed somewhat selectively by the proximal intestine. Arriving at the correct diagnosis in such cases may be quite challenging.},

Altogether 36 cases of CD in Estonian children were diagnosed from January 1976 through June 1992 by criteria recommended by the European Society for Paediatric Gastroenterology and Nutrition. A significant increase was observed in the incidence of CD in Estonia (from 1:25, 130 live births during 1976-1989 to about 1:2,700 live births during 1990-1992), due mainly to the introduction of IgA-class AGA determinations in an active search for celiac patients since 1990. A total of 29 IgA-class AGA-positive cases was revealed among 1,048 children screened, and 23 of them had CD. Thus, the results show a relatively low incidence of CD in Estonia compared to the figures in neighboring countries. However, the incidence will probably increase if a larger pediatric population can be screened for CD using IgA-class AGA enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay.},

A positive anti-gliadin antibody test result was revealed in 11 children and in 8 coeliac disease was diagnosed according to the criteria of the European Society for Paediatric Gastroenterology and Nutrition. There was no suspicion of coeliac disease before anti-gliadin antibody determinations in five children and two were asymptomatic. In five children, no suspicion of coeliac disease was raised beforehand. The present study shows that coeliac disease is underdiagnosed in Estonia.},

   abstract = {The classical clinical picture of coeliac disease includes prolonged diarrhoea with failure to thrive. During the past two decades this type of active presentation of coeliac disease has decreased in many European countries, giving the impression that coeliac disease is a disappearing disease. However, this is not true. The disease can be found in older children with a more or less silent presentation. Silent coeliac disease can be detected by active screening with serological tests. Coeliac disease can be suspected in children suffering from mild gastrointestinal symptoms, such as abdominal pain, and in those with signs of nutritional deficiencies, as well as in children of first-degree relatives of already diagnosed coeliacs, patients with IgA-deficiency, patients suffering from dental enamel hypoplasia or dermatitis herpetiformis, and patients with some other disease known to be associated with coeliac disease, such as diabetes mellitus. According to the fundamental criteria of coeliac disease, the intestinal mucosa is flat when the individual is eating gluten-containing foods. However, this is not strictly true. Intolerance to gluten is obviously variable and the intestinal mucosa may be normal. This type of latent coeliac disease can be detected by analysing genetic markers, measuring antibodies in intestinal fluid or counting the density of intra-epithelial gamma/delta T cells which are increased greatly even in the latent phase of coeliac disease. Thus the general concept of the natural history of coeliac disease is changing.},

   abstract = {That symptomatic celiac disease (CD) can occur in several members of a family has long been recognized. Given the possible complications of untreated CD, it is also important to diagnose those family members with "silent" disease, to offer them the benefit of a gluten-free diet. We studied 642 first-degree relatives of 210 patients with CD, two of the latter belonging to the same family. IgA and IgG antigliadin antibodies and IgA antiendomysium antibodies were studied in all. Jejunal biopsy was performed in 59 subjects, 47 with positive and 12 with negative serological markers. Celiac disease was diagnosed de novo in 18 cases (2.8%). Diagnosis in a symptomatic mother was made by jejunal biopsy despite the negativity of all immunological markers. We conclude that the risk of having CD is higher in siblings than in parents of patients with CD, that the most useful marker for diagnosis is the study of IgA antiendomysium antibodies, and that the absence of positive serological markers does not completely exclude the diagnosis of CD.},

   abstract = {To contribute to the description of the physiopathological mechanisms of celiac disease, changes in insulin-like growth factor I (IGF-I) were followed-up in 21 children suspected of suffering from celiac disease. Thirteen children were suffering from celiac disease according to the original criteria of the European Society of Paediatric Gastroenterology and Nutrition. Ten celiac children changing from a gluten-containing to a gluten-free diet presented a significant rise in IGF-I (+1.54 mM per month). In a group of eight celiac children challenged with gluten, seven had a significant decrease in IGF-I (-1.11 mM per month), and five celiac children returning to the gluten-free diet after challenge with gluten had a marked but not significant increase in IGF-I (+1.7 mM per month). Eight children not suffering from celiac disease, but challenged with gluten, had a significant increase in IGF-I (+0.29 mM per month), corresponding to the expected age-dependent increase. The significant changes in IGF-I described under the diagnostic dietetic phases of celiac disease reflect the extent of growth retardation caused by the disease. IGF-I may be a supplementary aid in the diagnosis of celiac disease in describing individual changes under the dietetic phases.},

   abstract = {The absorption of beta-lactoglobulin (BLG) by cultured explants of the normal adult duodenal mucosa has been studied in vitro using immunocytochemical techniques. Membrane filters (1 mm2) were soaked in medium containing BLG and placed on the mucosal surface. Explants were cultured for < or = 60 min, and histological sections were immunostained for BLG. Increasing the BLG concentration in the filters and/or the exposure time increased the number and immunoreactivity of the immunopositive epithelial cells present, suggesting increased BLG absorption. Increased BLG penetration of the duodenal mucosa in untreated coeliac disease was also shown using these techniques. In some studies horseradish peroxidase (HRP) was used as an alternative probe and pin-pointed in epithelial cells by ultracytochemical techniques, confirming vesicular uptake of macromolecules. Colocalisation experiments using BLG and HRP and immunofluorocytochemical techniques suggested linkage between the mechanisms of absorption of both proteins into epithelial cells. Short-term organ culture and protein challenge followed by immunolocalisation has been shown to be of value in studying the absorption of BLG and HRP by the upper small intestine and possibly of other protein macromolecules as well.},

   abstract = {The association between Down's syndrome (DS) and autoimmune diseases has long been recognized. However, its relationship to celiac disease (CD) has only recently been reported, and a clear-cut association remains to be fully established. We have studied the prevalence of CD in a random sample of 70 individuals with DS. IgA anti-gliadin antibodies (IgA AGAs) were determined in all and found to be positive in nine (13%). In eight, anti-endomysium antibodies (AEAs) were investigated, and jejunal biopsies were performed. AEAs were positive in two, and three had flat intestinal mucosa. The class I and II human leukocyte antigens of two patients with CD were determined. Results were as follows: A2/B8 B39/DR1 DR3/DQW1 DQW2 in one case and A2 A28/B44 B17/DR4 DR5/DQW3 in the other. This implies a 43% prevalence of CD in DS, which is well above that previously found by us in our population (0.62/1,000 live births). We conclude that the association between DS and CD is not fortuitous and suggest that the determination of such serologic markers as IgA AGA and AEA should be part of health assessment in DS patients.},
