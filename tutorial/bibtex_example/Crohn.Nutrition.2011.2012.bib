   abstract = {BACKGROUND: Crohn's disease (CD) is highly heritable. NOD2 has emerged as the main susceptibility gene among individuals of European ancestry; however, NOD2 does not appear to contribute to CD susceptibility among many non-European populations. Today's African American (AA) population represents an admixture of West African (80%) and European (20%) ancestry. Since genotype-based tools are becoming increasingly available for CD, it is important that we validate the risk variants in different populations, such as admixed AAs. METHODS: We analyzed the NOD2 variants among admixed AAs (n = 321, 240 with CD and 111 healthy controls [HCs]) and nonadmixed West Africans (n = 40) by genotyping four known disease-causing NOD variants. We extracted the publicly available 1000 Genomes data on NOD2 variants from 500 subjects of West African origin. Association with disease was evaluated by logistic regression. RESULTS: An association with CD was found for the classical single nucleotide polymorphism (SNP) 1007fs (2.6% CD, 0% HC, P = 0.012); there was no association when the genotypic and allelic frequencies of the risk alleles were compared for SNPs R702W and G908R. No known NOD2 risk alleles were seen in either the West African cohort or in subjects of African ancestry from the 1000 Genomes project. CONCLUSIONS: The NOD2 gene is a risk for CD in AAs, although the allele frequencies and the attributable risk are much lower compared with Caucasians. The risk alleles are not seen in the West African population, suggesting that the risk for CD contributed by NOD2 among AAs is due exclusively to recent European admixture.},

   abstract = {The diet of industrialized nations may contribute to the pathogenesis of both ulcerative colitis (UC) and Crohn disease (CD). Malnutrition is relatively unusual in UC, but in CD, which often affects the small intestine, it is frequent and may be severe. Nutrition support is therefore frequently indicated. First principles of artificial nutrition can be applied effectively using the gut whenever possible. Parenteral nutrition is generally required only in those with short bowel syndrome. An increasing literature (especially in pediatrics) favors the use of defined exclusive enteral nutrition (EN) in the primary treatment of active CD. Controlled trials are, however, lacking, and recommendations are accordingly not of the highest rank. It appears that in this context, simple polymeric regimens are usually sufficient, and there is currently insufficient evidence to make a strong recommendation for disease-specific feeds. In the maintenance of remission in CD, controlled data demonstrate that defined EN reduces the risk of relapse requiring steroid treatment. There are no data in support of primary nutrition therapy in UC either in management of the acute flare or in maintenance. In conclusion, nutrition therapy in adults with inflammatory bowel disease is probably both undervalued and underused, but the evidence base needs to be strengthened to confirm its efficacy, determine better those patients most likely to benefit, and optimize the regimens to be employed.},

   abstract = {OBJECTIVES: The aim of the study was to estimate the frequency of primary sclerosing cholangitis (PSC)-type lesions in children with inflammatory bowel disease (IBD) by means of magnetic resonance cholangiopancreatography (MRCP), and to investigate the association between a series of easily applicable data on the one hand and the presentation of such lesions at MRCP on the other hand. METHODS: Collected demographic, laboratory, and magnetic resonance enterography data from the records of 73 children with IBD were cross-sectionally related to the MRCP-based diagnosis. RESULTS: Around the time of MRCP, the distribution of IBD subtypes was 64.4%, 24.7%, and 11% for Crohn disease, indeterminate colitis, and ulcerative colitis, respectively. A total of 11 patients (15.1%) were identified with PSC-type lesions. Demographic and magnetic resonance enterography data were unrelated to the MRCP outcome. Biochemical abnormalities were of low prevalence (<50%) among patients with PSC. The abnormality prevalences of aspartate transaminase, alanine transaminase, and gamma-glutamyl transferase were significantly higher in the PSC group, both at initial diagnosis of IBD and at the time of MRCP. Less-consistent results were documented for bilirubin and alkaline phosphatase, especially at initial diagnosis of IBD. CONCLUSIONS: The abnormality prevalences of aspartate transaminase, alanine transaminase, and gamma-glutamyl transferase were significantly higher in the PSC group. Nevertheless, PSC-type lesions frequently occur in pediatric IBD, even if the biochemical profile is hardly indicative of this probability.},

   abstract = {Crohn's disease is an increasingly global health concern. Currently without a cure, it significantly alters the quality of life of Crohn's disease sufferers and places a heavy financial burden on the community. Recent reports show that the rising prevalence of Crohn's disease is no longer confined to Western countries, with considerable increases seen particularly in Asia. Nutritional problems are often associated with Crohn's disease, most notably in the paediatric population, with underweight and stunting commonly seen at presentation. In addition, linear growth retardation and pubertal delay can also manifest in these younger patients. Therefore, exclusive enteral nutrition has been used as a therapeutic option to treat Crohn's disease, in part to address the nutritional complications of the disease. Exclusive enteral nutrition can improve nutrition as well as induce remission at a rate equivalent to corticosteroids. It is safe particularly with long-term use and can induce mucosal healing, considered the gold standard for therapy, at a rate superior to corticosteroids. Exclusive enteral nutrition has thus become the preferred therapeutic option in many centres for the treatment of paediatric Crohn's disease. This review discusses the role of exclusive enteral nutrition as a therapeutic option for the treatment of Crohn's disease, as well as the latest findings into its mechanisms of action.},

   abstract = {OBJECTIVE: To determine the usefulness of MRI enterography for assessing the extension and activity of paediatric Crohn's disease. MRI findings were compared with clinical, biological, endoscopic and other imaging data. PATIENTS AND METHODS: Studies of MRI enterography use in patients younger than 18 years of age were reviewed. Patients received 500-1000mL of polyethylene glycol one hour before examination (1.5-TMR). T2 HASTE sequences with or without fat saturation, T2 true-FISP, T1 with fat saturation, pre- and post gadolinium-enhanced VIBE sequences, and dynamic and diffusion HASTE were acquired. Thickening of the bowel wall, mucosal enhancement, and extra-luminal complications were evaluated. Five MRI patterns (normal, fibrosis, mild, moderate, and severe transmural activity) were defined. Findings were compared with PCDAI scores, inflammatory parameters, and endoscopic and histological results. RESULTS: Twenty-two studies were reviewed. Optimal intestinal distension was present in 82% of the cases. Mild side effects were observed in 12% of patients. There was a significant relationship between MRI patterns and PCDAI scores (P=.002), sedimentation rate (P=.006) and serum PCR levels (P=.047) and a non-significant relationship with the histology (P=.571). MRI enterography correctly assessed the ileal (80%) and colonic (66%) extension. Extra-luminal complications unrelated to MRI classification (P=.274) were reported in 86.4% of studies. CONCLUSIONS: There was a significant relationship between MRI patterns and PCR, sedimentation rate, and PCDAI scores. MRI enterography showed excellent agreement with ileoscopies, and allowed endoscopically non-accessible areas to be assessed, as well as the diagnosis of extra-luminal complications without irradiation.},

   abstract = {BACKGROUND AND AIM: Esophageal Crohn disease (ECD) is more common than it was originally thought to be. Only limited information, however, is available regarding its significance and effect on clinical course in the pediatric population. The aim of the study was to determine the prevalence of ECD in our patient population and compare clinical features and severity of disease among patients with ECD and nonesophageal Crohn disease (NECD). PATIENTS AND METHODS: Medical records of all patients with ECD diagnosed during a 12-year period based on specific endoscopic and histological criteria were reviewed and compared with a random group of patients with NECD. RESULTS: During the study period, 81 (20%) patients with ECD were identified. Mean age at diagnosis was 12 (range 4-19 years) with a male predominance of 63%. Only 29 (36%) patients had symptoms suggestive of upper gastrointestinal involvement. Endoscopic ulcers were present in 45 (56%) of patients with ECD, whereas noncaseating granulomas were found in 10 (12%) of those patients. The majority (89%) of these patients had concomitant gastric and/or duodenal involvement. When compared with 160 random patients with NECD, patients with ECD had higher mean Pediatric Crohn Disease Activity Index scores (40.2 vs 23.9; P < 0.001), more penetrating-type disease (12% vs 2%; P = 0.001), and a greater frequency of perianal involvement (51% vs 33%; P = 0.005) at diagnosis. No differences, however, were noted between the 2 groups in terms of need for surgical resection throughout duration of follow-up. CONCLUSIONS: Patients with ECD may represent a phenotype of Crohn disease with a more severe presentation. Patients with perianal disease at the time of initial physical examination should be considered for an upper endoscopy in addition to the colonoscopy to exclude esophageal involvement despite the absence of specific upper gastrointestinal symptoms. These observations should foster additional investigation into ECD phenotype to determine appropriate treatment and prognosis.},

   abstract = {INTRODUCTION: Serious infections are an important side effect of immunosuppressive therapy used to treat Crohn's disease (CD) and ulcerative colitis (UC). There have been no nationally representative studies examining the spectrum of infection related hospitalizations in patients with IBD. METHODS: Our study consisted of all adult CD and UC related hospitalizations from the Nationwide Inpatient Sample 2007, a national hospitalization database in the United States. We then identified all infection-related hospitalizations through codes for either the specific infections or disease processes (sepsis, pneumonia, etc.). Predictors of infections as well as the excess morbidity associated with infections were determined using multivariate regression models. RESULTS: There were an estimated 67,221 hospitalizations related to infections in IBD patients, comprising 27.5% of all IBD hospitalizations. On multivariate analysis, infections were independently associated with age, co-morbidity, malnutrition, TPN, and bowel surgery. Infection-related hospitalizations had a four-fold greater mortality (OR 4.4, 95% CI 3.7-5.2). However, this varied by type of infection with the strongest effect seen for sepsis (OR 15.3, 95% CI 12.4-18.6), pneumonia (OR 3.6, 95% CI 2.9-4.5) and C. difficile (OR 3.2, 95% CI 2.6-4.0), and weaker effects for urinary infections (OR 1.4, 95%CI 1.1-1.7). Infections were also associated with an estimated 2.3 days excess hospital stay (95% CI 2.2-2.5) and $12,482 in hospitalization charges. CONCLUSION: Infections account for significant morbidity and mortality in patients with IBD and disproportionately impact older IBD patients with greater co-morbidity. Pneumonia, sepsis and C difficile infection are associated with the greatest excess mortality risk.},

   abstract = {BACKGROUND: The intestinal microbiota is involved in the pathogenesis of inflammatory bowel disease (IBD). Faecal microbiota transplantation (FMT) has been used for the management of IBD as well as infectious diarrhoea. AIM: To undertake a systematic review of FMT in patients with IBD. METHODS: The systematic review followed Cochrane and PRISMA recommendations. Nine electronic databases were searched in addition to hand searching and contacting experts. Inclusion criteria were reports (RCT, nonrandomised trials, case series and case reports) of FMT in patients with IBD. RESULTS: Of the 5320 articles identified, 17 fulfilled the inclusion criteria, none of which were controlled trials. There were nine case series/case reports of patients receiving FMT for management of their IBD, and eight where FMT was for the treatment of infectious diarrhoea in IBD. These 17 articles reported on 41 patients with IBD (27 UC, 12 Crohn's, 2 unclassified) with a follow-up period of between 2 weeks and 13 years. Where reported, FMT was administered via colonoscopy/enema (26/33) or via enteral tube (7/33). In patients treated for their IBD, the majority experienced a reduction of symptoms (19/25), cessation of IBD medications (13/17) and disease remission (15/24). There was resolution of C. difficile infection in all those treated for such (15/15). CONCLUSIONS: Whilst the available evidence is limited and weak, it suggests that faecal microbiota transplantation has the potential to be an effective and safe treatment for IBD, at least when standard treatments have failed. Well-designed randomised controlled trials are required to investigate these findings.},

   abstract = {OBJECTIVES: Varicella zoster is a childhood disease that can cause devastating illness and death in immunocompromised individuals, including those who are taking steroids. Inflammatory bowel disease (IBD) is managed by decreasing or controlling the inflammation using immunosuppression. Our objective was to show that at least 90% of patients newly diagnosed as having IBD had antibodies against varicella zoster and were protected by vaccination or natural disease. MATERIALS AND METHODS: Retrospective review of all of the charts of the patients diagnosed with IBD at the University of Buffalo's Digestive Diseases and Nutrition Center for 5 years from January 1, 2005 to December 31, 2009. RESULTS: There were 163 new diagnoses of IBD during this time; 57% were boys. Mean age was 12 years (range 1-19 years); 62% had Crohn disease, 33% ulcerative colitis, and 5% indeterminate colitis. A total of 66% of all of the patients had a history of disease or vaccination. Measurable titers against varicella were found in only 77% of all of the patients. CONCLUSIONS: Lack of varicella immunity is common in children and adolescents at the time of diagnosis of IBD. Routine screening for varicella immune status may be warranted. Offering immunization to susceptible patients should confer protection, but this may be difficult to achieve once immune suppression has begun.},

There is a great deal of interest in treating moderate to severe active inflammatory bowel disease with anti-tumor necrosis factor (anti-TNF) biologics in pregnant women (2). We lack definitive information about the effects of these agents on the development of the immune system of the human fetus and the newborn baby. Anti-TNF agents fall within US Food and Drug Administration's (FDA) category B regarding fetal risk, indicating that no adequate and well-controlled studies have been conducted in pregnant or nursing women. Here, we review animal studies (of both mice and nonhuman primates) that examine the role of TNF and its inhibitors in the normal development of the immune system.},

   abstract = {BACKGROUND: Hypoadiponectinemia has been associated with states of chronic inflammation in humans. Mesenteric fat hypertrophy and low adiponectin have been described in patients with Crohn's disease. We investigated whether adiponectin and the plant-derived homolog, osmotin, are beneficial in a murine model of colitis. METHODS: C57BL/6 mice were injected (i.v.) with an adenoviral construct encoding the full-length murine adiponectin gene (AN+DSS) or a reporter-LacZ (Ctr and V+DSS groups) prior to DSS colitis protocol. In another experiment, mice with DSS colitis received either osmotin (Osm+DSS) or saline (DSS) via osmotic pumps. Disease progression and severity were evaluated using body weight, stool consistency, rectal bleeding, colon lengths, and histology. In vitro experiments were carried out in bone marrow-derived dendritic cells. RESULTS: Mice overexpressing adiponectin had lower expression of proinflammatory cytokines (TNF, IL-1beta), adipokines (angiotensin, osteopontin), and cellular stress and apoptosis markers. These mice had higher levels of IL-10, alternative macrophage marker, arginase 1, and leukoprotease inhibitor. The plant adiponectin homolog osmotin similarly improved colitis outcome and induced robust IL-10 secretion. LPS induced a state of adiponectin resistance in dendritic cells that was reversed by treatment with PPARgamma agonist and retinoic acid. CONCLUSION: Adiponectin exerted protective effects during murine DSS colitis. It had a broad activity that encompassed cytokines, chemotactic factors as well as processes that assure cell viability during stressful conditions. Reducing adiponectin resistance or using plant-derived adiponectin homologs may become therapeutic options in inflammatory bowel disease.},

   abstract = {BACKGROUND: Anti tumor necrosis factor alpha (TNFalpha) agents have become widely used in pediatric inflammatory bowel disease (IBD). So far, only few studies examined the long-term results of anti-TNFalpha treatment in children with IBD. METHODS: The long-term outcome of pediatric patients with IBD was assessed retrospectively in a multicenter cohort of children treated with anti-TNFalpha beyond induction treatment. Short- and long-term response rates, predictors for loss of response, data on growth and laboratory parameters were assessed. RESULTS: 120 patients [101 crohn's disease (CD), 19 ulcerative colitis (UC) or indeterminate colitis (IC)] received either infliximab or adalimumab. The mean age at initiation of anti-TNFalpha was 13.4 +/- 3.9 years and the median duration of anti-TNFalpha treatment was 15 months (range: 2-90). Overall, 89% of the cohort experienced short-term response following induction. Response was associated with improvement in weight and BMI Z-scores (p<0.001) but not with linear growth. Responders experienced a significant decrease in erythrocyte sedimentation rate (ESR) and C reactive protein (CRP) during treatment (p<0.001). Albumin and hemoglobin both improved but only albumin increased significantly (p<0.001). The cumulative probability of losing response to anti-TNFalpha treatment was 17%, 38%, and 49% after 1, 3, and 5 years, respectively. Responders had a significantly lower weight and BMI Z-scores at initiation of anti-TNFalpha treatment in compared to non-responders (p=0.04 and 0.02 respectively). CONCLUSIONS: Our long term cohort supports the current evidence on the effectiveness and safety of anti-TNFalpha treatment in children with IBD. Response to treatment was interestingly associated with lower weight and BMI.},

   abstract = {BACKGROUND AND OBJECTIVES: Medications are a major cause of acute pancreatitis; however, little is known about their influence in children. Our primary aims were to identify common comorbidities and concomitant pancreatitis etiologies in children with drug-associated pancreatitis. Our secondary aims were to identify the most commonly associated drugs in the different age groups, evaluate management practices, and compare drug-associated cases with non-drug-associated cases. PATIENTS AND METHODS: In the present study, we examined children (ages 0-20 years) admitted to Yale-New Haven Children's Hospital with pancreatitis between 1994 and 2007. RESULTS: Of a total of 271 pediatric cases, drugs were associated with pancreatitis in 25.6% (55). The 3 most common comorbidities in children with drug-associated pancreatitis were seizure disorders, acute lymphocytic leukemia, and Crohn disease. One third of drug-associated cases had an additional pancreatitis etiology. The most commonly associated drugs were valproic acid and corticosteroids. Compared with non-drug-associated cases, children with drug-associated cases were more likely to undergo CT scanning (54.5% vs 28.4%; P < 0.001), stay in the hospital longer (10 vs 4 days; P < 0.001), and transition to parenteral nutrition from a nil per os status (37.5% vs 21.2%; P < 0.05). There was a higher frequency of valproic acid-associated cases in children younger than 11 years (29.4% vs 9.5% in the 11- to 20-year-old age group). CONCLUSIONS: Our study underscores the importance of considering drugs as a cause and a contributor to pancreatitis in children, particularly valproic acid in young children.},

   abstract = {OBJECTIVE: The incidence of inflammatory bowel disease (IBD) in Europe has increased significantly. At least a fourth of patients are children. Mannan-binding lectin (MBL) is believed to be an important component of innate immunity, acting as an opsonin and activator of the lectin pathway (LP) of complement. The data relating any of the LP factors to IBD are sparse and contradictory and were obtained mainly from adult patients. The aim of this study was to investigate the possible role of MBL in Crohn's disease (CD) and ulcerative colitis (UC) in children. METHODS: MBL2 gene single nucleotide polymorphisms (PCR-RFLP) and MBL concentrations (ELISA) were determined. RESULTS: The frequency of MBL2 gene variants responsible for MBL deficiency (LXPA/O and O/O) is significantly higher in CD patients compared with controls or children with UC. A relatively high frequency of the codon 52 mutation (D allele) was noted in these patients. Practically no difference was found between UC and control (C) groups. Similarly, the average MBL levels as well as the number of MBL-deficient (MBL concentrations < 150 ng/ml) individuals differed between CD patients and controls or children suffering from UC. Again, there was no difference between UC and C groups. CONCLUSIONS: These data suggest that MBL deficiency may be associated with CD but not with UC in pediatric patients. The possible role of MBL in IBD requires confirmation in larger series and further investigation of the mechanisms involved.},

The aim of the present study was to investigate the prevalence and risk factors of CDI in newly diagnosed pediatric patients with IBD. METHODS: The current investigation was a retrospective study. All patients newly diagnosed with IBD in the pediatric gastroenterology clinic in Warsaw between 2007 and 2010 were included in the present study. The patients were diagnosed according to Porto criteria and microbiology evaluation screening tests for CDI were conducted. Risk factors including prior hospitalization, use of antibiotics within 2 months of CDI detection, colonic involvement, and the duration of symptoms were evaluated. CDI diagnosis was based on a positive stool enzyme immunoassay. RESULTS: In the present study, 134 patients were evaluated (54 patients with Crohn's disease, and 80 with ulcerative colitis; 87% of the patients had colonic disease). The average age of the patients was 12.3 years, and the prevalence of CDI was 47% (95% confidence interval [CI], 38%-56%). Significant differences in the prevalence of CDI between patients with Crohn's disease and ulcerative colitis (P = 0.72; odds ratio [OR] = 1.187, 95% CI, 0.56-2.52) were not observed. The risk of CDI was associated with an increase in the age of the patient and the severity of the disease. CONCLUSIONS: The prevalence of CDI in newly diagnosed IBD patients was high and was independent of the type of disease.},

   abstract = {Surgery for chronic inflammatory bowel disease (IBD) is increasingly often necessary in children. This study aimed at assessing the results of these operations in order to facilitate adequate preoperative counseling. We reviewed patients treated from 1992 to 2009. The operations, complications and functional outcome were recorded. For those with preserved rectal defecation, continence (Koivusalo score) and quality of life (standardized questionnaire) were assessed in the long term. Eighty five of 192 patients had Crohn disease (CD), 107 of 192 had ulcerative colitis (UC), and 3 of 192 had indeterminate colitis (IC). 12 of 85 CD patients (15%) aged 14 (12-19) years required 13 resections, 1 stricturoplasty, 1 transplantation and 6 other operations including 3 permanent enterostomies for anorectal involvement. Removal of the involved bowel led to significant improvement of nutritional status, growth and quality of life. The transplanted patient had a striking recovery but eventually died 1 year later of unrelated complications. 29 of 107 UC patients (26%) aged 11 (2-15) years required 87 operations. Nine had emergency colectomy for toxic megacolon (3, one death) or severe hemorrhage (6). 28 had restorative proctocolectomy and ileoanostomy (RPCIA) without (16) or with (12) J-pouch under protective ileostomy. Complications were frequent (40%). Permanent ileostomy was required in five children (17%). Twelve months postoperatively, RPCIA patients had 6.5 (2-13) stools/day; all were continent during daytime, and 25% have nocturnal leaks. Mean Koivusalo score (5-12) was 8.8 +/- 2. Quality of life was good in all. All attended normal school and 7 the university, 4 work and 60% of those older than 18 years have sexual partners. Three of 107 children treated as UC with RPCIA had ultimately IC (3%) and were permanently diverted. The nature of IBD involves frustrating surgery. However, it may change life for CD patients and provide a reasonably good quality of life for UC after the first year. Pediatric surgeons should be able to provide adequate preoperative counseling to patients and families.},

   abstract = {BACKGROUND AND AIMS: Eosinophils are implicated in the pathogenesis of inflammatory bowel disease (IBD). A subset of IBD patients develops blood eosinophilia, and the clinical profile of these patients is undefined. We sought to characterize IBD patients with and without eosinophilia. METHODS: We studied a prospective registry of 1,176 IBD patients followed in a tertiary referral center. Patients who developed eosinophilia at any time were identified by electronic medical record query. We performed a chart review case-control study comparing patients with recurrent eosinophilia versus randomly selected disease-matched patients with no history of eosinophilia. Histological analysis was performed on selected cases and controls. RESULTS: Eosinophilia at any time was more prevalent in ulcerative colitis (UC) patients than Crohn's disease patients (22.2 versus 12.7%), as was recurrent eosinophilia (3.4 versus 0.7%). UC patients with recurrent eosinophilia were predominantly male compared with the control UC population (81.3 versus 46.9%) and had higher rates of colectomy for either medically refractory disease or dysplasia/cancer than control UC patients (56.3 versus 15.6%). Primary sclerosing cholangitis (PSC) occurred in 37.5% of UC patients with recurrent eosinophilia compared with only 3.1% in the UC controls. Histological analysis of random diagnostic samples from UC patients with recurrent eosinophilia demonstrated a normal eosinophil pattern as seen in the control UC population. CONCLUSIONS: Eosinophilia-associated UC is a subgroup of IBD associated with severe colitis and PSC. Further studies are warranted to characterize molecular mechanisms underlying eosinophilia-associated UC and to determine optimal approaches for therapy.},

   abstract = {BACKGROUND & AIMS: Conjugated linoleic acid (CLA) has demonstrated efficacy as an immune modulator and anti-inflammatory compound in mouse and pig models of colitis. We investigated the immunoregulatory efficacy of CLA in patients with mild to moderate Crohn's disease (CD). METHODS: Thirteen patients with mild to moderately active CD were enrolled in an open-label study of CLA (6 g/d orally) for 12 weeks. Peripheral blood was collected at baseline, 6 and 12 weeks after treatment initiation for isolation of peripheral blood mononuclear cells for functional analyses of lymphoproliferation and cytokine production. Disease activity was calculated using the CD activity index (CDAI) and quality of life was assessed using the Inflammatory Bowel Disease Questionnaire (IBDQ). RESULTS: CLA significantly suppressed the ability of peripheral blood CD4+ and CD8+ T cell subsets to produce IFN-gamma, TNF-alpha and IL-17 and lymphoproliferation at week 12. There was a statistically significant drop in CDAI from 245 to 187 (P = 0.013) and increase in IBDQ from 141 to 165 (P = 0.017) on week 12. CONCLUSION: Oral CLA administration was well tolerated and suppressed the ability of peripheral blood T cells to produce pro-inflammatory cytokines, decreased disease activity and increased the quality of life of patients with CD.},

   abstract = {The underlying biochemical consequences of inflammatory bowel disease (IBD) on the systemic and gastrointestinal metabolism have not yet been fully elucidated but could help to better understand the disease pathogenesis and to identify tissue-specific markers associated with the different disease stages. Here, we applied a metabonomic approach to monitor metabolic events associated with the gradual development of Crohn's disease (CD)-like ileitis in the TNF(DeltaARE/WT) mouse model. Metabolic profiles of different intestinal compartments from the age of 4 up to 24 weeks were generated by combining proton nuclear magnetic resonance ((1)H NMR) spectroscopy and liquid chromatography-mass spectrometry (LC-MS). From 8 weeks onward, mice developed CD similar to the immune and tissue-related phenotype of human CD with ileal involvement, including ileal histological abnormalities, reduced fat mass and body weight, as well as hallmarks of malabsorption with higher energy wasting. The metabonomic approach highlighted shifts in the intestinal lipid metabolism concomitant to the histological onset of inflammation. Moreover, the advanced disease status was characterized by a significantly altered metabolism of cholesterol, triglycerides, phospholipids, plasmalogens, and sphingomyelins in the inflamed tissue (ileum) and the adjacent intestinal parts (proximal colon). These results describe different biological processes associated with the disease onset, including modifications of the general cell membrane composition, alteration of energy homeostasis, and finally the generation of inflammatory lipid mediators. Taken together, this provides novel insights into IBD-related alterations of specific lipid-dependant processes during inflammatory states.},

   abstract = {The health impacts of air pollution have received much attention and have recently been subject to extensive study. Exposure to air pollutants such as particulate matter (PM) has been linked to lung and cardiovascular disease and increases in both hospital admissions and mortality. However, little attention has been given to the effects of air pollution on the intestine. The recent discovery of genes linked to susceptibility to inflammatory bowel diseases (IBD) explains only a fraction of the hereditary variance for these diseases. This, together with evidence of increases in incidence of IBD in the past few decades of enhanced industrialization, suggests that environmental factors could contribute to disease pathogenesis. Despite this, little research has examined the potential contribution of air pollution and its components to intestinal disease. Exposure of the bowel to air pollutants occurs via mucociliary clearance of PM from the lungs as well as ingestion via food and water sources. Gaseous pollutants may also induce systemic effects. Plausible mechanisms mediating the effects of air pollutants on the bowel could include direct effects on epithelial cells, systemic inflammation and immune activation, and modulation of the intestinal microbiota. Although there is limited epidemiologic evidence to confirm this, we suggest that a link between air pollution and intestinal disease exists and warrants further study. This link may explain, at least in part, how environmental factors impact on IBD epidemiology and disease pathogenesis.},

   abstract = {BACKGROUND AND AIMS: The elderly represent a growing demographic of patients with IBD. No study has previously described variations in care or medication prescriptions in senior patients with IBD. We compared prescription rates among elderly patients with IBD in four countries using health administrative data. METHODS: Databases from the United States (US), United Kingdom (UK), Denmark and Canada were queried. Variation in prescription rates between countries was assessed in patients >/=65y with prevalent IBD who had >/=1 prescription for an IBD-related medication in a given quarter between 2004 and 2009. Patients were identified using previously-reported, validated algorithms. Country-specific rates were compared in each quarter using Fisher's exact test. RESULTS: In patients with Crohn's disease, Canada and US had higher prescription rates for oral 5-ASA (P<0.0001 in all quarters) and infliximab (P<0.05 in 22/24 quarters), while the US had higher rates of thiopurine usage (P<0.05 in 23/24 quarters). Canada had greater rates of methotrexate prescriptions (P<0.05 in 21/24 quarters analyzed). In patients with ulcerative colitis (UC), rates of oral steroid usage was lowest in the US (P<0.05 in 22/24 quarters) and oral 5-ASA use was highest in the US and Canada (P<0.0001 in all quarters). Canada and Denmark used more rectal therapy than the US. Infliximab usage in UC was significantly higher in the US and Canada after 2006. CONCLUSIONS: Significant variation in medication prescription rates exists among countries. Future research should assess whether these differences were associated with disparities in outcomes and health care costs.},

   abstract = {BACKGROUND: In the transition from pediatric to adult care, patients are expected to increase their level of self-care. Knowledge of disease characteristics, medications, and resources is crucial. This study evaluated the knowledge of adolescents with inflammatory bowel disease (IBD) and their parents in four major domains: disease characteristics, treatments, medical history, and health services resources. METHODS: Patients age 14-18 years and their parents completed MyHealth Passport for IBD as a cross-sectional assessment of knowledge. Responses were evaluated for accuracy using medical records. The proportion of correct responses between patients/parents were compared. RESULTS: In all, 78 patients (age 16.2 +/- 1.2 years, IBD duration 3.6 +/- 2.5 years), and 64 parents participated. Patients and parents were equally likely to answer questions correctly regarding disease characteristics and treatment, but not health services resources. Most patients accurately identified IBD classification and listed medications. Neither patients nor parents accurately identified disease location or previous investigation results. Parents more likely correctly named insurance provider (odds ratio [OR] 6.33, 95% confidence intervals [CI] 2.68-15.0), and pharmacy location (OR 18.5, 95% CI 4.6-76.8). Multivariate regression revealed that patients with IBD type unclassified were more likely to be aware of their diagnostic classification (OR 17.2, 95% CI 2.81-105.4 compared with Crohn's disease patients). Older patients were less likely to recall if they had a small bowel x-ray (OR 0.59, 95% CI 0.35-0.996). CONCLUSIONS: Future educational interventions should target areas of weakness in adolescent knowledge, particularly health services resources. The MyHealth Passport for IBD (available freely online) could educate and instill independence in the transitioning adolescent.},

   abstract = {BACKGROUND: Increased intestinal permeability (IP) has been implicated in the etiopathogenesis, disease activity and relapse of Crohn's disease (CD). Glutamine, the major fuel for the enterocytes, may improve IP. AIM: We evaluated the effect of oral glutamine on IP and intestinal morphology in patients with CD. METHODS: In a randomized controlled trial, consecutive patients with CD in remission phase with an abnormal IP were randomized to a glutamine group (GG) or active control group (ACG) and were given oral glutamine or whey protein, respectively, as 0.5 g/kg ideal body weight/day for 2 months. IP was assessed by the lactulose mannitol excretion ratio (LMR) in urine, and morphometry was performed by computerized image analysis system. RESULTS: Patients (age 34.5 +/- 10.5 years; 20 males) were assigned to the GG (n = 15) or ACG (n = 15). Fourteen patients in each group completed the trial. The LMR [median (range)] in GG and ACG at 2 months was 0.029 (0.006-0.090) and 0.033 (0.009-0.077), respectively, with P = 0.6133. IP normalized in 8 (57.1%) patients in each group (P = 1.000). The villous crypt ratio (VCR) [mean (SD)] in GG and ACG at 2 months was 2.68 (1.02) and 2.49 (0.67), respectively, (P = 0.347). At the end of 2 months LMR improved significantly in GG from 0.071 (0.041-0.254) to 0.029 (0.006-0.090) (P = 0.0012) and in ACG from 0.067 (0.040-0.136) to 0.033 (0.009-0.077) (P = 0.0063). VCR improved in the GG from 2.33 (0.77) to 2.68 (1.02) (P = 0.001), and in ACG from 2.26 (0.57) to 2.49 (0.67) (P = 0.009).

OBJECTIVE: To assess the BC of the patients with CD in active and remission phase, and compare with healthy controls (HC). METHODS: BC was assessed by bioelectrical impedance analysis using Tanita TBF-215 leg to leg portable impedance analyzer in 123 patients with CD and 100 matched HC. Diet intake was assessed by 24 hours diet recall method. RESULTS: The mean age of patients was 36.4 +/- 12.6 years and 56% were males. Patients in active phase as well as in remission phase had a lower BMI than HC (18.8 +/- 3.6 vs. 23.9 +/- 4.0; p = 0.001 and 18.8 +/- 3.6 vs. 21.6 +/- 5.0; p = 0.002). The fat mass (FM) in active phase was significantly lower than that in remission phase (8.2 +/- 5.9 vs. 13.4 +/- 10.6 kg; p = 0.005) and HC (8.2 +/- 5.9 kg vs. 14.1 +/- 7.5 kg; p = 0.001). FM did not differ between remission phase and HC. The fat free mass (FFM) of HC was significantly higher than that of both remission phase (48.9 +/- 7.4 kg vs. 43.3 +/- 10.4 kg; p = 0.001) and active phase (48.9 +/- 7.4 kg vs. 40.7 +/- 8.5 kg; p = 0.001). There was no difference in the FFM of patients in both phases; p = 0.356. The intake of macronutrients was comparable between the two phases; however lower than that of HC. CONCLUSION: Both FM and FFM were depleted in the active phase, while only FFM was deficient in the remission phase of CD, indicating a poor recovery of lean mass in remission.},

However, bacteria such as bifidobacteria and Faecalibacterium prausnitzii appear to be immunoregulatory. In healthy subjects the intestinal microbiota are influenced by prebiotic carbohydrates such as fructo-oligosaccharides (FOS). Preliminary data suggest that FOS increase faecal bifidobacteria, induce immunoregulatory dendritic cell (DC) responses and reduce disease activity in patients with Crohn's disease. AIMS AND METHODS: To assess the impact of FOS in patients with active Crohn's disease using an adequately powered randomised double-blind placebo-controlled trial with predefined clinical, microbiological and immunological end points. Patients with active Crohn's disease were randomised to 15 g/day FOS or non-prebiotic placebo for 4 weeks. The primary end point was clinical response at week 4 (fall in Crohn's Disease Activity Index of >/= 70 points) in the intention-to-treat (ITT) population. RESULTS: 103 patients were randomised to receive FOS (n = 54) or placebo (n = 49). More patients receiving FOS (14 (26%) vs 4 (8%); p = 0.018) withdrew before the 4-week end point. There was no significant difference in the number of patients achieving a clinical response between the FOS and placebo groups in the ITT analysis (12 (22%) vs 19 (39%), p = 0.067). Patients receiving FOS had reduced proportions of interleukin (IL)-6-positive lamina propria DC and increased DC staining of IL-10 (p < 0.05) but no change in IL-12p40 production. There were no significant differences in the faecal concentration of bifidobacteria and F prausnitzii between the groups at baseline or after the 4-week intervention. CONCLUSION: An adequately powered placebo-controlled trial of FOS showed no clinical benefit in patients with active Crohn's disease, despite impacting on DC function. ISRCTN50422530.},

   abstract = {BACKGROUND: Patients with Crohn's disease (CD) have an intestinal dysbiosis with components of the microbiota exerting differential immune effects. Smoking is associated with an increased incidence of CD, more frequent relapse, and greater burden of surgery. This study aimed to investigate the association between smoking and the intestinal microbiota in patients with active CD. METHODS: Patients with active CD (n = 103) and healthy controls (n = 66) were recruited and demographic and clinical data recorded including current smoking behavior. Fecal samples were collected and analyzed by fluorescent in situ hybridization using probes targeting 16S rRNA of bacteria previously shown to be altered in active CD (bifidobacteria, bacteroides, Clostridium coccoides-Eubacterium rectale, Escherichia coli, and Faecalibacterium prausnitzii). RESULTS: In total, 29/101 (29%) patients with CD and 8/58 (14%) controls were current smokers (P = 0.032). Following multivariate analysis, smoking was found to have a significant and independent effect on the microbiota of patients with CD, with higher Bacteroides-Prevotella in smokers (38.4%) compared with nonsmokers (28.1%) (F((1,93)) = 12.6, P = 0.001). Healthy controls who smoked also had higher Bacteroides-Prevotella (34.8%) than nonsmokers (24.1%) (F((1,55)) = 4.5, P = 0.038). In the pooled multivariate analysis, patients with CD had higher bifidobacteria (F((1,156)) = 30.5, P < 0.001), higher Bacteroides-Prevotella (F((1,156)) = 6.5, P = 0.012), and lower F. prausnitzii (F((1,156)) = 3.8, P = 0.052) compared with healthy controls. CONCLUSIONS: Smokers have luminal microbiota that consist of significantly higher bacteroides. Investigation of whether this is one mechanism through which the negative effects of smoking on CD are mediated is warranted.},

   abstract = {OBJECTIVE: To assess the incidence of hemophagocytic lymphohistiocytosis (HLH) in a well-defined population of children with inflammatory bowel disease (IBD) and evaluate the common clinical and laboratory characteristics of individuals with IBD who developed HLH. STUDY DESIGN: We conducted a retrospective study of all children who developed HLH over an 8-year period. The incidence of HLH in patients with IBD was calculated using US census data and a statewide project examining the epidemiology of pediatric IBD. RESULTS: Among children in Wisconsin, 20 cases of HLH occurred during the study period; 5 cases occurred in children with IBD. Common characteristics include: Crohn's disease (CD), thiopurine administration, fever lasting more than 5 days, lymphadenopathy, splenomegaly, anemia, lymphopenia, and elevated serum triglycerides and ferritin. Of the patients, 4 had primary Epstein-Barr virus infections. The incidence of HLH among all children in Wisconsin was 1.5 per 100 000 per year. The risk was more than 100-fold greater for children with CD (P < .00001). CONCLUSIONS: Pediatric patients with CD are at increased risk for developing HLH; primary Epstein-Barr virus infection and thiopurine administration may be risk factors.},

   abstract = {OBJECTIVE: To assess the effect of adalimumab on work productivity and indirect costs in patients with Crohn's disease (CD) using a meta-analysis of clinical trials. METHODS: Study-level results were pooled from all clinical trials of adalimumab for moderate to severe CD in which work productivity outcomes were evaluated. Work Productivity and Activity Impairment Questionnaire outcomes (absenteeism, presenteeism and total work productivity impairment [TWPI]) were extracted from adalimumab trials. Meta-analyses were used to estimate pooled averages and 95% CIs of one-year accumulated reductions in work productivity impairment with adalimumab. Pooled averages were multiplied by the 2008 United States national average annual salary ($44,101) to estimate per-patient indirect cost savings during the year following adalimumab initiation. RESULTS: The four included trials (ACCESS, CARE, CHOICE and EXTEND) represented a total of 1202 employed adalimumab-treated patients at baseline. Each study followed patients for a minimum of 20 weeks. Pooled estimates (95% CIs) of one-year accumulated work productivity improvements were as follows: -9% (-10% to -7%) for absenteeism; -22% (-26% to -18%) for presenteeism; and -25% (-30% to -20%) for TWPI. Reductions in absenteeism and TWPI translated into per-patient indirect cost savings (95% CI) of $3,856 ($3,183 to $4,529) and $10,964 ($8,833 to $13,096), respectively. CONCLUSION: Adalimumab provided clinically meaningful improvements in work productivity among patients with moderate to severe CD, which may translate into substantial indirect cost savings from an employer's perspective.},

While high sensitive C-reactive protein (CRP) remains the best biochemical marker, we evaluated the diagnostic usefulness of lipid peroxidation indices. METHODS: Malondialdehyde/thiobarbituric acid-reactive substances (MDA/TBARS), peroxidation potential (PP), lipid hydroperoxides (ROOH), oxidized-low density lipoprotein (oxLDL), and oxLDL antibodies (OLAB) were assessed in 52 CD patients and 99 volunteers and referred to clinical activity, inflammation, nutritional and antioxidant status. RESULTS: MDA/TBARS were higher in CD while oxLDL and PP decreased in active disease and ROOH and OLAB did not differ. oxLDL and PP negatively and OLAB positively correlated with CD activity. MDA/TBARS positively correlated with IL-6 and SOD-1 and negatively with catalase. IL-6 and SOD-1 explained 24% in MDA/TBARS variability. PP negatively correlated with CRP, platelets, and IL-6 and positively with glutathione peroxidase-1, paraoxonase-1, cholesterol, triglycerides, and albumins. Cholesterol and CRP explained 57% in PP variability. oxLDL negatively correlated with IL-1 and IL-6 and positively with glutathione peroxidase-1, paraoxonase-1, cholesterol, and albumins. Paraoxonase-1 explained 17% of oxLDL variability. OLAB positively correlated with IL-1 explaining 10% in its variability and negatively with cholesterol. MDA/TBARS were the best predictor of CD, comparable to CRP, with high specificity (MDA/TBARS sensitivity and specificity: 75% and 90%; CRP: 76% and 93%). Combined assessment of MDA/TBARS and CRP improved sensitivity (94%) corresponding with acceptable specificity (81%). CONCLUSIONS: MDA/TBARS are elevated in CD and may help to rule the disease out, while the combined evaluation with CRP may serve for CD confirmation. oxLDL and PP depended on substrate availability, decreased in CD.},

   abstract = {OBJECTIVES: Increasing numbers of paediatric and adolescent patients with Crohn disease (CD) and ulcerative colitis (UC) are reported. To determine whether this observation is a consequence of a shift towards onset at a younger age, we analysed retrospective data from patients enrolled in the Swiss IBD Cohort Study (SIBDCS). PATIENTS AND METHODS: The SIBDCS is a disease-based cohort in Switzerland, which collects retrospective and prospective data on a large sample of patients with inflammatory bowel disease (IBD). Patients, diagnosed from 1980, were stratified according to diagnosis of CD and UC. Age at disease onset (age at first symptoms and age at diagnosis) was analysed in relation to calendar year of disease onset. Data were extracted from physician and patient questionnaires. Linear regressions of age at disease onset by calendar year of disease onset adjusted by sex, country of birth, and education were performed. RESULTS: Adjusted regression coefficients for CD and UC were significantly positive, that is, age at disease onset has increased with time. Male sex was associated with an increase in age at disease onset, and birth in Switzerland with a decrease. These associations were statistically significant. CONCLUSIONS: The results from the SIBDCS do not support the hypothesis that disease onset of both CD and UC occur today at a younger age. On the contrary, our results show that there is a significant trend for age at disease onset occurring at an older age today as compared with recent decades. We conclude that the observation of increasing numbers of paediatric and adolescent patients with IBD is not caused by a trend towards disease onset at a younger age, but that this may rather be a consequence of the overall increasing incidence of these conditions.},

   abstract = {Dietary methyl donors and their genetic determinants are associated with Crohn's disease risk. We investigated whether a methyl-deficient diet (MDD) may affect development and functions of the small intestine in rat pups from dams subjected to the MDD during gestation and lactation. At 1 month before pregnancy, adult females were fed with either a standard food or a diet without vitamin B12, folate and choline. A global wall hypotrophy was observed in the distal small bowel (MDD animals 0.30 mm v. controls 0.58 mm; P< 0.001) with increased crypt apoptosis (3.37 v. 0.4%; P< 0.001), loss of enterocyte differentiation in the villus and a reduction in intestinal alkaline phosphatase production. Cleaved caspase-3 immunostaining (MDD animals 3.37% v. controls 0.4%, P< 0.001) and the Apostain labelling index showed increased crypt apoptosis (3.5 v. 1.4%; P= 0.018). Decreased proliferation was observed in crypts of the proximal small bowel with a reduced number of minichromosome maintenance 6 (MDD animals 52.83% v. controls 83.17%; P= 0.048) and proliferating cell nuclear antigen-positive cells (46.25 v. 59 %; P= 0.05). This lack of enterocyte differentiation in the distal small bowel was associated with an impaired expression of beta-catenin and a decreased beta-catenin-E-cadherin interaction. The MDD affected the intestinal barrier in the proximal small bowel by decreasing Paneth cell number after immunostaining for lysosyme (MDD animals 8.66% v. controls 21.66%) and by reducing goblet cell number and mucus production after immunostaining for mucin-2 (crypts 8.66 v. 15.33%; villus 7 v. 17%). The MDD has dual effects on the small intestine by producing dramatic effects on enterocyte differentiation and barrier function in rats.},

   abstract = {BACKGROUND AND OBJECTIVES: Acute pancreatitis (AP) can be a rare extraintestinal manifestation of inflammatory bowel disease (IBD). There are only a few reports of AP presenting before the diagnosis of IBD. We aimed to characterize the demographic, clinical, and laboratory data of patients with IBD in whom AP preceded disease onset and compare the presentation of AP between children and adults. PATIENTS AND METHODS: Pediatric and adult patients presenting with AP as the first symptom of IBD were retrospectively identified (10 years, 7 university hospitals). Demographic and clinical data, IBD type, disease extension, and laboratory data were extracted from the charts. Imaging methods, number of AP episodes, and lag time between onset of first pancreatitis episode and onset of IBD were recorded. RESULTS: AP preceding the diagnosis of IBD was found in 10 in 460 pediatric patients with IBD (2.17%), compared with only 2 in 3500 adults (0.06%). Eight children had colonic disease (4 Crohn disease, 4 ulcerative colitis [3 pancolitis]). Mean amylase level was 1419 and range 100 to 1370. Three children (30%) had mildly elevated transaminases. Median time between onset of first episode of AP in relation to onset of IBD was 24 (range 1-156) weeks. AP most commonly presented with abdominal pain. CONCLUSIONS: IBD presenting as AP was more frequent among the pediatric population with IBD in comparison to adults. It was more common in patients with colitis than in those with ileal disease, suggesting that patients with idiopathic AP should be observed carefully for a possible diagnosis of IBD.},

METHODS: Fifty Crohn's disease patients aged between 20 and 45 years were compared to 25 controls. Patients with a family history of cardiovascular diseases or a known risk for atherosclerosis were excluded. All participants underwent nutritional assessment. Carotid artery ultrasonography was performed and intima-media thickness and peak systolic velocity were measured, proximal to the common carotid bifurcation. Clinical data and laboratory parameters (hemoglobin, highly sensitive C-reactive protein, and plasma homocysteine) were determined. RESULTS: No significant differences between the groups were found for intima-media thickness or peak systolic velocity. Multiple regression analysis revealed a positive correlation of intima-media thickness with older age. Peak systolic velocity was negatively associated with age. CONCLUSIONS: Crohn's disease patients do not have an increased risk for developing early atherosclerosis.},

   abstract = {Patients with inflammatory bowel disease (IBD) often question their doctors about diet. The objectives of this article are to provide clinicians with existing dietary advice by presenting the dietary information proposed by medical societies in the form of clinical practice guidelines as it relates to IBD; listing dietary guidelines from patient-centered IBD-related organizations; and creating a new 'global practice guideline' that attempts to consolidate the existing information regarding diet and IBD. The dietary suggestions derived from sources found in this article include nutritional deficiency screening, avoiding foods that worsen symptoms, eating smaller meals at more frequent intervals, drinking adequate fluids, avoiding caffeine and alcohol, taking vitamin/mineral supplementation, eliminating dairy if lactose intolerant, limiting excess fat, reducing carbohydrates and reducing high-fiber foods during flares. Mixed advice exists regarding probiotics. Enteral nutrition is recommended for Crohn's disease patients in Japan, which differs from practices in the USA.},

   abstract = {The gastrointestinal (GI) microbiota is the collection of microbes which reside in the GI tract and represents the largest source of non-self antigens in the human body. The GI tract functions as a major immunological organ as it must maintain tolerance to commensal and dietary antigens while remaining responsive to pathogenic stimuli. If this balance is disrupted, inappropriate inflammatory processes can result, leading to host cell damage and/or autoimmunity. Evidence suggests that the composition of the intestinal microbiota can influence susceptibility to chronic disease of the intestinal tract including ulcerative colitis, Crohn's disease, celiac disease and irritable bowel syndrome, as well as more systemic diseases such as obesity, type 1 diabetes and type 2 diabetes. Interestingly, a considerable shift in diet has coincided with increased incidence of many of these inflammatory diseases. It was originally believed that the composition of the intestinal microbiota was relatively stable from early childhood; however, recent evidence suggests that diet can cause dysbiosis, an alteration in the composition of the microbiota, which could lead to aberrant immune responses. The role of the microbiota and the potential for diet-induced dysbiosis in inflammatory conditions of the GI tract and systemic diseases will be discussed.},

   abstract = {Ileocolonoscopy remains the gold standard in diagnosing postoperative recurrence. After excluding stricture, wireless capsule endoscopy seemed accurate in small series, but no validated score is available. Ultrasonography is a non-invasive diagnostic method reducing radiation exposure and emerging as an alternative tool for identifying post-operative recurrence. Computed tomography enteroclysis yields objective morphologic criteria that help differentiate between recurrent disease and fibrostenosis at the anastomotic site, but ionising radiation exposure limits its use. Magnetic resonance imaging may be as powerful as ileocolonoscopy in diagnosing postoperative recurrence and in predicting the clinical outcome using specific MR-scores. Biomarkers such as faecal calprotectin and faecal lactoferrin showed promising results, but their specificity in the postoperative period will require further investigation. Numerous medications have been tested to prevent and/or to treat postoperative recurrence. Efficacy of mesalamine is very low and comparable to placebo in most series. Thiopurines have modest efficacy in the postoperative setting and are associated with a high rate of adverse events leading to drug withdrawal. Antibiotics such as metronidazole or ornidazole may be effective, but toxicity and drug resistance prevent their long-term use. Anti-Tumour Necrosis Factor therapy is the most potent drug class to prevent and to treat postoperative recurrence in Crohn's disease.},

   abstract = {BACKGROUND: Anemia is a frequent complication of Crohn's disease (CD). The intestinal iron exporter ferroportin (FPN) is involved in both iron deficiency anemia and the anemia of chronic disease. To examine its role in CD, intestinal FPN expression was studied in subjects with and without CD. METHODS: Duodenal mucosal biopsies from 29 pediatric subjects with CD (n=19) and without CD (n=10) were obtained. FPN protein was measured using Western blot analysis and mRNA was assessed using quantitative real-time polymerase chain reaction (PCR). RESULTS: Intestinal FPN protein was higher in anemic CD subjects than in nonanemic CD subjects (P=0.01), while FPN mRNA levels were not different (P=0.66). In nonanemic CD subjects, erythrocyte sedimentation rate (ESR) (P=0.04), C-reactive protein (CRP) (P=0.03), and interleukin-6 (IL-6) (P=0.01) levels were elevated compared to controls. Nonanemic CD subjects had a lower median FPN protein than nonanemic controls, although it did not reach statistical significance (P=0.07). Median FPN mRNA was similar between groups (P=0.71). Although no correlation between FPN protein and IL-6 was noted, there was a strong negative correlation between serum iron and IL-6, both in subjects with CD (r=-0.88, P<0.0001) and those without anemia (r=-0.58, P=0.02). CONCLUSIONS: Intestinal FPN protein is upregulated in anemic CD subjects, suggesting that iron deficiency or anemia is the driving force regulating FPN levels. A transporter distinct from FPN appears to be involved in the hypoferremia associated with the inflammatory process of CD.},

   abstract = {Besides their possible effects on the development of inflammatory bowel disease (IBD), some environmental factors can modulate the clinical course of both ulcerative colitis (UC) and Crohn's disease (CD). This review is mainly devoted to describing the current knowledge of the impact of some of these factors on the outcome of IBD, with special emphasis on smoking and diet. Although the impact of smoking on the susceptibility to develop CD and UC is firmly established, its influence on the clinical course of both diseases is still debatable. In CD, active smoking is a risk factor for postoperative recurrence. Beyond this clinical setting, smoking cessation seems to be advantageous in those CD patients who were smokers at disease diagnosis, while smoking resumption may be of benefit in ex-smokers with resistant UC. The role of dietary habits on the development of IBD is far from being well established. Also, food intolerances are very frequent, but usually inconsistent among IBD patients, and therefore no general dietary recommendations can be made in these patients. In general, IBD patients should eat a diet as varied as possible. Regarding the possible therapeutic role of some dietary components in IBD, lessons should be drawn from the investigation of the primary therapeutic effect of enteral nutrition in CD. Low-fat diets seem to be particularly useful. Also, some lipid sources, such as olive oil, medium-chain triglycerides, and perhaps omega-3 fatty acids, might have a therapeutic effect. Fermentable fiber may have a role in preventing relapses in inactive UC.},

   abstract = {BACKGROUND & AIM: Despite their well known anti-inflammatory actions, the clinical usefulness of omega-3 PUFA in inflammatory bowel disease is controversial. We aimed to systematically review the available data on the performance of omega-3 PUFA as therapeutic agents in these patients. METHODS: Electronic databases were systematically searched for RCT of fish oil or omega-3 PUFA therapy in both active and inactive ulcerative colitis or Crohn's disease, without limitation on either the length of therapy or the form it was given, including nutritional supplements and enteral formula diets. Eligible articles were assessed for methodological quality on the basis of the adequacy of the randomisation process, concealment of allocation, blinding of intervention and outcome, possible biases, and completeness of follow-up. The five-point Oxford quality score was calculated. RESULTS: A total of 19 RCT were finally selected for this review. Overall, available data do not allow to support the use of omega-3 PUFA supplementation for the treatment of both active and inactive inflammatory bowel disease. Negative results are quite consistent in trials assessing the use of omega-3 PUFA to maintain disease remission, particularly ulcerative colitis, and to a lesser extent Crohn's disease. Trials on their use in active disease do not allow to draw firm conclusions mainly because the heterogeneity of design (ulcerative colitis) or their short number (Crohn's disease). In most trials, the appropriateness of the selected placebo is questionable. CONCLUSION: The present systematic review does not allow to make firm recommendations about the usefulness of omega-3 PUFA in inflammatory bowel disease.},

Veno-occlusive disease, peliosis hepatis, perisinusoidal fibrosis and nodular regenerative hyperplasia have all been described with thiopurines. Recent trials of 6-tioguanine, although successful in patients with allergies to azathioprine or mercaptopurine, have been compromised by increased hepatotoxicity, either veno-occlusive disease or nodular regenerative hyperplasia. We describe a report of nodular regenerative hyperplasia in a Crohn's disease patient associated with 6-mercaptopurine therapy and have reviewed the management and the literature regarding this complication. Our report strengthens the importance of further safety studies to evaluate the etiology, prevalence, risk factors and screening modalities for hepatotoxicity, in particular of nodular regenerative hyperplasia, in patients treated with thiopurines for inflammatory bowel disease.},

   abstract = {BACKGROUND AND AIM: Ulcerative colitis (UC) is primarily a disease of non-smokers. Ex-smokers may have a more refractory disease course and anecdotal evidence in non-controlled clinical trials have suggested that smoking resumption, or the administration of nicotine, may ameliorate signs and symptoms of UC in ex-smokers. We report outcomes of ex-smokers with refractory UC who resumed low-dose cigarette smoking. METHODS: 17 ex-smokers with refractory UC were identified. Clinical remission was defined as a disease activity index score of 0. RESULTS: Two out of 17 patients refused the recommendation to resume smoking. Of the 15 patients who resumed smoking, the mean daily number of cigarettes was 8.6. Fourteen out of those 15 patients who resumed smoking were able to maintain prolonged clinical remission off steroids. One out of the 15 patients failed to improve and required oral steroids. Another patient was compelled to quit smoking since he became addicted. His disease flared after maintaining a prolonged remission of 3 years and he eventually underwent surgery. Three out of these 15 patients switched from cigarettes smoking to nicotine compounds and continued to maintain remission. CONCLUSION: Resumption of low dose smoking in a selected group of ex-smokers with refractory UC may ameliorate signs and symptoms. Quality of life, medication side effects, and smoking risk factors should all be considered and discussed with patients. Smokers should be meticulously followed for compliance with "low-dose" regimen and all associated smoking risks.},

   abstract = {Crohn's disease is one of the leading causes of intestinal failure. The term 'type 2' intestinal failure is used to describe the relatively rare type of intestinal failure that occurs in association with septic, metabolic and complex nutritional complications, typically following surgical resection and/or laparostomy for intra-abdominal sepsis. A multidisciplinary approach to the management of patients with type 2 intestinal failure is crucial, and it is helpful to approach patient care in a structured manner using the 'sepsis-nutrition-anatomy-plan' algorithm: resolution of sepsis is required before adequate nutritional repletion can be achieved, and it is crucial to optimise nutritional status, and define intestinal anatomy before delineating a definitive medical or surgical plan. A structured approach to the management of patients with inflammatory bowel disease, who have developed type 2 intestinal failure, should reduce the likelihood of these patients developing 'type 3' intestinal failure, which is characterised by the need for long-term parenteral nutrition. However, Crohn's disease is still the commonest indication for home parenteral nutrition in the UK.},

   abstract = {BACKGROUND: Orofacial granulomatosis (OFG) is a rare chronic inflammatory disease of unknown etiology sharing histological features with Crohn's disease (CD). This study aimed to 1) define the clinical presentation of OFG, 2) establish differentiating features for those with CD, 3) examine if onset of OFG is predictive of CD, and 4) establish differentiating features for children. METHODS: Data were extracted from medical notes (n = 207) for demographics, clinical features, blood parameters, diagnosis of CD, and treatment's for patients with OFG. RESULTS: Ninety-seven patients (47%) were female. The lips (184/203; 91%) and buccal mucosa (151/203; 74%) were mainly affected. Forty-six (22%) had intestinal CD. Ulcers (24/46; 46% versus 29/159; 15%, P = <0.001) were more common in patients with CD as was a raised C-reactive protein (24/33; 73% versus 60/122; 49%, P = 0.016) and abnormal full blood count (19/41; 46% versus 35/150; 23%). The buccal-sulcus (12/44; 27% versus 20/158; 13%, P = 0.019) was more often affected in those with CD. Half the patients with CD were diagnosed prior to onset of OFG. The remainder were diagnosed after. The incidence of CD is similar for children (16/69; 23%) and adults (29/132; 22%), although oral onset in childhood is more likely to occur prior to diagnosis of CD. CONCLUSIONS: OFG mainly presents in young adults with lip and buccal involvement. Abnormalities in inflammatory markers, hematology and oral features of ulceration, and buccal-sulcal involvement are factors more commonly associated with CD. Initial presentation of OFG does not necessarily predict development of CD, although this is more likely in childhood.},

   abstract = {BACKGROUND: Aspirin has detrimental effects on the gastrointestinal tract mucosa and may play a role in the aetiology of inflammatory bowel disease. AIM: To investigate if the regular use of aspirin is associated with the development of Crohn's disease (CD) and ulcerative colitis (UC) using, for the first time, a prospective cohort study design. METHODS: A total of 135,780 men and women in Europe, aged 30-74years, were recruited into the European Prospective Investigation into Cancer and Nutrition study. Participants completed questionnaires at baseline detailing their regular aspirin use and were then followed up to identify those who developed either incident CD or UC. Each case was matched with four controls and odds ratios (OR) were calculated, adjusting for cigarette smoking. Potential interactions between aspirin and smoking were assessed. RESULTS: A total of 35 participants developed CD and a further 84 were diagnosed with UC. Regular aspirin intake was positively associated with the risk of developing CD (OR=6.14, 95% CI=1.76-21.35). In those who took aspirin and smoked there was no detectable increased risk of CD (OR=0.30, 95% CI=0.03-3.08). No association was found between regular aspirin use and UC (OR=1.29, 95% CI=0.67-2.46). CONCLUSIONS: A strong positive association between regular aspirin use and CD, but not UC, was observed. The data suggest that regular aspirin use should be measured in epidemiological work on CD. If such findings are consistent in other work then aspirin may affect the development of CD in a middle-aged to elderly population.},

   abstract = {Endoplasmic reticulum (ER) unfolded protein responses (UPR) are implicated in the pathogenesis of inflammatory bowel disease. Cytotoxic CD8alphabeta(+) intraepithelial lymphocytes (IEL) contribute to the development of Crohn's disease-like ileitis in TNF(DeltaARE/+) mice. In this study, we characterized the role of ER-UPR mechanisms in contributing to the disease-associated phenotype of cytotoxic IEL under conditions of chronic inflammation. Inflamed TNF(DeltaARE/+) mice exhibited increased expression of Grp78, ATF6, ATF4, and spliced XBP1 in CD8alphabeta(+) IEL but not in CD8alphaalpha(+) IEL or in lamina propria lymphocytes. Chromatin immunoprecipitation analysis in CD8alphabeta(+) T cells showed selective recruitment of ER-UPR transducers to the granzyme B gene promoter. Heterozygous Grp78(-/+) mice exhibited an attenuated granzyme B-dependent cytotoxicity of CD8alphabeta(+) T cells against intestinal epithelial cells, suggesting a critical activity of this ER-associated chaperone in maintaining a cytotoxic T cell phenotype. Granzyme B-deficient CD8alphabeta(+) T cells showed a defect in IL-2-mediated proliferation in Grp78(-/+) mice. Adoptively transferred Grp78(-/+) CD8alphabeta(+) T cells had a decreased frequency of accumulation in the intestine of RAG2(-/-) recipient mice. The tissue pathology in TNF(DeltaARE/+) x Grp78(-/+) mice was similar to TNF(DeltaARE/+) mice, even though the cytotoxic effector functions of CD8alphabeta(+) T cells were significantly reduced. In conclusion, ER stress-associated UPR mechanisms promote the development and maintenance of the pathogenic cytotoxic CD8alphabeta(+) IEL phenotype in the mouse model of Crohn's disease-like ileitis.},

   abstract = {Invading bacteria are recognized, captured and killed by a specialized form of autophagy, called xenophagy. Recently, defects in xenophagy in Crohn's disease (CD) have been implicated in the pathogenesis of human chronic inflammatory diseases of uncertain etiology of the gastrointestinal tract. We show here that pathogenic adherent-invasive Escherichia coli (AIEC) isolated from CD patients are able to adhere and invade neutrophils, which represent the first line of defense against bacteria. Of particular interest, AIEC infection of neutrophil-like PLB-985 cells blocked autophagy at the autolysosomal step, which allowed intracellular survival of bacteria and exacerbated interleukin-8 (IL-8) production. Interestingly, this block in autophagy correlated with the induction of autophagic cell death. Likewise, stimulation of autophagy by nutrient starvation or rapamycin treatment reduced intracellular AIEC survival and IL-8 production. Finally, treatment with an inhibitor of autophagy decreased cell death of AIEC-infected neutrophil-like PLB-985 cells. In conclusion, excessive autophagy in AIEC infection triggered cell death of neutrophils.},

   abstract = {Inflammatory bowel disease (IBD), consisting of Crohn's disease and ulcerative colitis (UC), results in substantial morbidity and is difficult to treat. New strategies for adjunct therapies are needed. One candidate is the semi-essential amino acid, L-arginine (L-Arg), a complementary medicine purported to be an enhancer of immunity and vitality in the lay media. Using dextran sulfate sodium (DSS) as a murine colonic injury and repair model with similarities to human UC, we assessed the effect of L-Arg, as DSS induced increases in colonic expression of the y(+) cationic amino acid transporter 2 (CAT2) and L-Arg uptake. L-Arg supplementation improved the clinical parameters of survival, body weight loss, and colon weight, and reduced colonic permeability and the number of myeloperoxidase-positive neutrophils in DSS colitis. Luminex-based multi-analyte profiling demonstrated that there was a marked reduction in proinflammatory cytokine and chemokine expression with L-Arg treatment. Genomic analysis by microarray demonstrated that DSS-treated mice supplemented with L-Arg clustered more closely with mice not exposed to DSS than to those receiving DSS alone, and revealed that multiple genes that were upregulated or downregulated with DSS alone exhibited normalization of expression with L-Arg supplementation. Additionally, L-Arg treatment of mice with DSS colitis resulted in increased ex vivo migration of colonic epithelial cells, suggestive of increased capacity for wound repair. Because CAT2 induction was sustained during L-Arg treatment and inducible nitric oxide (NO) synthase (iNOS) requires uptake of L-Arg for generation of NO, we tested the effect of L-Arg in iNOS(-/-) mice and found that its benefits in DSS colitis were eliminated. These preclinical studies indicate that L-Arg supplementation could be a potential therapy for IBD, and that one mechanism of action may be functional enhancement of iNOS activity.},

   abstract = {BACKGROUND AND OBJECTIVE: Because capsule endoscopy (CE) avoids ionizing radiation, deep sedation, and general anesthesia, CE may be valuable in pediatrics. We report a single pediatric center's experience with the use and safety of CE. METHODS: In a retrospective review of consecutive CE studies, 284 CE studies were performed in 277 patients with a mean age of 15 (+/-3.7) years during a 5-year period. The youngest to swallow the capsule was 4.6 years old. Twenty capsules were placed. Overall, 245 (86%) patients underwent CE for suspected (184, 65%) or confirmed (61, 21%) Crohn disease (CD); 27 (9.5%) anemia or gastrointestinal bleeding; 6 (2%) polyposis; and 4 (1.4%) celiac disease. RESULTS: Positive findings were observed in 205 (72%) of the studies, with 152 (54%) having small bowel findings. Of these, 72 (47%) were diagnostic. Gastric (95, 33%) and colonic (31, 11%) abnormalities were also identified. Five CE studies (1.8%) resulted in retention of the capsule in nonsurgical patients. A patency capsule before CE in 23 patients allowed 19 CE to proceed with only 1 retained capsule. In 65 (21%) patients, the video capsule did not enter the colon before the video's end. Of these, 36 (65%) had significant findings, including 27 (49%) documenting small bowel (SB) CD. CONCLUSIONS: CE is useful to diagnose SB disease in children. Even in a study population with a high prevalence of confirmed and suspected CD, the risk of retention remains small. The patency capsule may lessen that risk. CE may identify gastric or colonic disease even when SB lesions are not present.},

   abstract = {In the West, the incidence and prevalence of inflammatory bowel diseases has increased in the past 50 years, up to 8-14/100,000 and 120-200/100,000 persons, respectively, for ulcerative colitis (UC) and 6-15/100,000 and 50-200/100,000 persons, respectively, for Crohn's disease (CD). Studies of migrant populations and populations of developing countries demonstrated a recent, slow increase in the incidence of UC, whereas that of CD remained low, but CD incidence eventually increased to the level of UC. CD and UC are incurable; they begin in young adulthood and continue throughout life. The anatomic evolution of CD has been determined from studies of postoperative recurrence; CD begins with aphthous ulcers that develop into strictures or fistulas. Lesions usually arise in a single digestive segment; this site tends to be stable over time. Strictures and fistulas are more frequent in patients with ileal disease, whereas Crohn's colitis remains uncomplicated for many years. Among patients with CD, intestinal surgery is required for as many as 80% and a permanent stoma required in more than 10%. In patients with UC, the lesions usually remain superficial and extend proximally; colectomy is required for 10%-30% of patients. Prognosis is difficult to determine. The mortality of patients with UC is not greater than that of the population, but patients with CD have greater mortality than the population. It has been proposed that only aggressive therapeutic approaches, based on treatment of early recurrent lesions in asymptomatic individuals, have a significant impact on progression of these chronic diseases.},

   abstract = {OBJECTIVES: Unintended variation in the care of patients with Crohn disease (CD) and ulcerative colitis (UC) may prevent achievement of optimal outcomes. We sought to improve chronic care delivery and outcomes for children with inflammatory bowel disease by using network-based quality improvement methods. METHODS: By using a modified Breakthrough Series collaborative structure, 6 ImproveCareNow Network care centers tested changes in chronic illness care and collected data monthly. We used an interrupted time series design to evaluate the impact of these changes. RESULTS: Data were available for 843 children with CD and 345 with UC. Changes in care delivery were associated with an increase in the proportion of visits with complete disease classification, measurement of thiopurine methyltransferase (TPMT) before initiation of thiopurines, and patients receiving an initial thiopurine dose appropriate to their TPMT status. These were significant in both populations for all process variables (P < .01) except for measurement of TPMT in CD patients (P = .12). There were significant increases in the proportion of CD (55%-68%) and UC (61%-72%) patients with inactive disease. There was also a significant increase in the proportion of CD patients not taking prednisone (86%-90%). Participating centers varied in the success of achieving these changes. CONCLUSIONS: Improvements in the outcomes of patients with CD and UC were associated with improvements in the process of chronic illness care. Variation in the success of implementing changes suggests the importance of overcoming organizational factors related to quality improvement success.},

   abstract = {We present a 36-year-old female diagnosed with Crohn's disease at the age of 11 years. In 2001, she underwent a total colectomy and further small bowel resection as a result of active Crohn's. Her residual anatomy consisted of 150 cm of small bowel to an end jejunostomy. Subsequently, she developed short bowel syndrome with recurrent episodes of hypomagnesaemia, hypocalcaemia, and hypokalaemia. Dietetic assessment revealed her to be severely underweight at 37 kg with a bodymass index (BMI) of 14.4 kg/m(2) . During her admission, our patient underwent psychiatric assessment and was established on home parenteral nutrition (HPN). At the time of discharge, 1 month later, her weight had increased to 44 kg (BMI = 17.7 kg/m(2) ). Over the following 12-month period, she lost weight (BMI, 15.4 mg/m(2) ; weight, 39.5 kg) and she described a high stoma output (up to 17 L) and dehydration. Assessment of her oral intake found she was consuming an estimated 14,000 kcal and 600 g protein per day. At this time, the possibility of a new form of eating disorder was discussed with the patient and she agreed that her behavior i.e., using her stoma as a purging device, fulfilled the criteria for a diagnosis of bulimia nervosa and she was referred to a specialist eating disorder unit.},

   abstract = {OBJECTIVES: Cardiovascular complications have been frequently described in Inflammatory Bowel Disease (IBD). Both Crohn disease and Ulcerative Colitis are characterized by malabsorption of some micronutrients, such as carnitine, which is a very important element for myocardial metabolism, being demonstrated that its deficiency correlates with heart involvement in coeliac disease. Aims of this study are to evaluate cardiac function in IBD patients asymptomatic for cardiovascular diseases and to correlate the cardiac data with the profile of carnitine esters plasma levels. MATERIALS AND METHODS: The study was carried out on 20 IBD patients by comparison with 18 sex- and age-matched clinically healthy controls. Personal and familial history, physical examination, standard electrocardiogram and echocardiogram were performed in all subjects. Complete panel of nutritional status parameters and serum levels of free carnitine and its esters were evaluated both in IBD patients and control subjects. RESULTS: Isovaleryl-carnitine, Tiglyl-carnitine, Octenoylcarnitine and Decanoyl-carnitine, were found to be significantly lower in IBD patients. Significant correlations were found between some carnitine esters and echocardiographic parameters although total and free carnitine were meanly more elevated in IBD. No statistically significant differences in echocardiographic parameters were found between IBD patients and control subjects. CONCLUSIONS: Deficiency of some isoforms of carnitine, especially those esterified with short chain fatty acids, may play an important role in cardiac involvement in course of IBD and could lead, over time, to dilated cardiomiopathy.},

   abstract = {UNLABELLED: Crohn's disease (CD) is a chronic inflammatory disorder that primarily affects the intestines, resulting in breakage of the intestinal barrier, pathological inflammation and nutritional disorders that encompass from trace elements deficiency to severe malnutrition. Nutritional interventions either alone or associated to drug therapy may be effective to achieve and maintain inflammation remission. OBJECTIVE: To evaluate usual food intake as quantitative and qualitatively, in CD patients; and describe the effect of a supplement containing whey proteins and TGF- on their body composition. PATIENTS AND METHODS: Dietary intake was assessed considering 42 consecutive patients, followed in a tertiary center, and by using the 3-day food recall and food intake frequency questionnaire. Body composition was assessed previously and 8 weeks after supplementation with a diet containing whey proteins and TGF-beta (N = 22). RESULTS AND DISCUSSION: Considering carbohydrates and lipids, most patients had adequate dietary intake according recommendations. Protein, saturated fat, B12 vitamin and zinc intakes were higher than the recommended values. The dietary fiber, A, D, C and E vitamins, calcium, iron, folate, potassium and sodium intakes did not reach the recommended requirements in most patients. Patients supplemented with the whey protein and TGF-beta dietary presented a positive increment in their lean body mass, when compared to non-supplemented group. CONCLUSION: CD patients require nutritional orientation. Whey protein intake resulted in significant differences, such as improvement in Lean Body Mass and reduction in Fat percentage.},

   abstract = {Crohn's disease and ulcerative colitis can be grouped as the inflammatory bowel diseases (IBD). These conditions have become increasingly common in recent years, including in children and young people. Although much is known about aspects of the pathogenesis of these diseases, the precise aetiology is not yet understood, and there remains no cure. Recent data has illustrated the importance of a number of genes-several of these are important in the onset of IBD in early life, including in infancy. Pain, diarrhoea and weight loss are typical symptoms of paediatric Crohn's disease whereas bloody diarrhoea is more typical of colitis in children. However, atypical symptoms may occur in both conditions: these include isolated impairment of linear growth or presentation with extra-intestinal manifestations such as erythema nodosum. Growth and nutrition are commonly compromised at diagnosis in both Crohn's disease and colitis. Consideration of possible IBD and completion of appropriate investigations are essential to ensure prompt diagnosis, thereby avoiding the consequences of diagnostic delay. Patterns of disease including location and progression of IBD in childhood differ substantially from adult-onset disease. Various treatment options are available for children and adolescents with IBD. Exclusive enteral nutrition plays a central role in the induction of remission of active Crohn's disease. Medical and surgical therapies need to considered within the context of a growing and developing child. The overall management of these chronic conditions in children should include multi-disciplinary expertise, with focus upon maintaining control of gut inflammation, optimising nutrition, growth and quality of life, whilst preventing disease or treatment-related complications.},

   abstract = {BACKGROUND AND AIMS: A six-week course of exclusive enteral nutrition (EEN) is recommended as first treatment in active paediatric Crohn's disease (CD). We aimed to assess short-term and long-term outcome of EEN, and to identify predictive factors of treatment success. METHODS: The medical records of newly diagnosed paediatric CD patients initiating EEN as remission induction therapy between January 2008 and October 2011 were retrospectively studied. Treatment outcome was assessed using a previously described pattern recognition model. RESULTS: 77 CD patients (median age 13.9 years, 57% male) initiated a six-week course of EEN, combined with azathioprine maintenance treatment in 92%. Patients received EEN as either hyperosmolar sip feeds or polymeric formula by nasogastric tube. In patients completing a six-week course of EEN (n=58), complete remission was achieved in 71%, partial remission in 26%, and no response in 3%. Complete remission rates were higher in children presenting with isolated ileal/ileocaecal disease and malnutrition. Nineteen patients discontinued EEN before the intended treatment period due to worsening of symptoms (n=9) or adherence issues (n=10). Non-adherence occurred more often in older children, females, children from non-Dutch parents, and patients taking hyperosmolar sip feeds compared with polymeric formula by nasogastric tube. The likelihood of relapsing disease within the first year after EEN treatment was 59%. CONCLUSION: A six-week course of EEN is effective in newly diagnosed paediatric CD, with response rates that seem to be influenced by disease location and nutritional status, but not by type of formula. Non-adherence occurs frequently and limits the success of this treatment in everyday clinical practice.},

   abstract = {OBJECTIVE: In 2005, the Inflammatory Bowel Disease (IBD) Working Group of the European Society for Pediatric Gastroenterology, Hepatology, and Nutrition published consensus guidelines on the diagnostic workup of paediatric IBD, the Porto criteria. According to these guidelines, children suspected of having IBD should undergo an oesophagogastroduodenoscopy (OGD), ileocolonoscopy, and (except in cases of definitive ulcerative colitis) adequate imaging of the small bowel. To audit and evaluate the diagnostic workup of paediatric patients with IBD in Europe, the Working Group created EUROKIDS, a prospective, Web-based registry of newly diagnosed paediatric patients with IBD. METHODS: Patients with IBD (ages 0-18 years) were registered in 44 centres in 18 countries. Data on diagnostic workup were analysed according to the year of diagnosis, type of IBD, and centre size. Diagnostic yield of OGD and ileal intubation were evaluated. RESULTS: Between 2004 and 2009, 2087 newly diagnosed patients were correctly registered. Both OGD and ileocolonoscopy had been performed in 64% of all of the patients and increased significantly from year 1 (52 %) to 5 (71%, P < 0.001). Small-bowel follow-through use decreased during the years (year 1 n = 213, year 5 n = 108; P < 0.001), whereas magnetic resonance imaging use increased (year 1 n = 25, year 5 n = 171; P < 0.001). Patients diagnosed as having Crohn disease (CD, 59%) and ulcerative colitis (58%) were more likely to have had a complete diagnostic workup than patients diagnosed as having IBD unclassified (45%). In CD, the diagnostic yield of OGD was 7.5% and the yield of ileal intubation was 13%. CONCLUSIONS: The quality of diagnostic workup in paediatric patients with IBD increased steadily between 2004 and 2009. Small-bowel imaging by magnetic resonance imaging superseded the use of small-bowel follow-through. OGD and ileal intubation contributed to a definitive diagnosis of CD.},

   abstract = {Biologicals have become an important component in the treatment of Crohn's disease in children. Their increased and long term use raises safety concerns. We describe safety and cost of infliximab in Belgian pediatric Crohn's disease patients. All patients on infliximab as part of the present or past treatment for Crohn's Disease until January 1st 2011 were selected from an existing database. Information on disease phenotype, medication and adverse events were extracted. Adverse events occurred in 25.9% of patients exposed to infliximab of which 29.6% were severe. In total 31.7% of patients stopped infliximab therapy. The main reasons for discontinuation were adverse events in 45.4% and loss of response in 30.3%. No malignancies or lethal complications occurred over this 241 patient year observation period. Immunomodulators were concomitant medication in 75% of patients and were discontinued subsequently in 38.4% of them. The cost of infliximab infusions per treated patient per year in the Belgian health care setting is approximately 9 474 euro, including only medication and hospital related costs. Even though infliximab is relatively safe in pediatric CD on the short term, close follow-up and an increased awareness of the possible adverse reactions is highly recommended. Adverse reactions appeared in 25.9% of all patients and were the main reason for discontinuation. Treatment cost has to be balanced against efficacy and modifications in disease course. In the Belgian health care system, the medication is available to all patients with moderate to severe CD.},

At the same period, 148 patients with IBD according to the European Society for Paediatric Gastroenterology, Hepatology and Nutrition criteria were followed up at the Pediatric Gastroenterology Unit in our University Hospital. Only two of them had vasculitis, as an extra intestinal manifestation of UC mimicking HSP, and fulfilled both disease criteria. A 2-year old girl had bloody diarrhoea, severe abdominal pain, arthritis in ankles, petechiae and palpable purpura not related to thrombocytopenia in lower limbs. A 5-year old boy had bloody diarrhoea, palpable purpura in buttocks, lower limbs, penis and scrotum associated with arthritis in knees, orchitis in right testicle and periarticular swelling in hands and feet. Their ileocolonoscopy showed diffuse mucosal erythema, oedema, friability and multiple irregular ulcers, and histopathological examination of colonic specimen revealed diffuse chronic mucosal inflammation, crypt distortion and crypt abscesses suggesting ulcerative colitis. There were no signs of intestinal vasculitis in both cases. In conclusion, this is the first study in a paediatric population that evidenced palpable purpura associated with UC mimicking HSP.},

   abstract = {AIM: Endorectal advancement flap is the most used treatment for acquired rectovaginal fistula but is liable to failure. We describe our experience with a modified technique. METHOD: Patients were included who had an acquired rectovaginal fistula. Exclusions included patients with Crohn's disease with proctitis, malignant or radiation-related fistula, stricture of the anorectum or those with an external sphincter defect. Surgery included closure of the internal opening with a figure-of-eight reabsorbable suture, plication of the anorectal muscular layer and mucosal flap advancement. Total parenteral nutrition was administered postoperatively for seven days. RESULTS: Between March 2003 and July 2008, 23 consecutive women (mean age 45.5 [28-78] years) were treated. The cause of fistulation included obstetric injury (n = 5), cryptoglandular disease (n = 11) and Crohn's disease (n = 7). Thirteen (57%) patients had a previous failed repair. At a mean follow-up of 14 (2-67) months, success was achieved in 65% (15/23) of patients. The mean Wexner incontinence scores pre- and postoperatively were 1.3 (0-15) and 0.6 (0-6), respectively. CONCLUSION: The success rate was promising with no deterioration of anal continence.},

   abstract = {BACKGROUND AND OBJECTIVES: Infliximab is used increasingly as maintenance therapy for inflammatory bowel disease (IBD); however, the effects of a single maintenance dose of infliximab are unclear with respect to the quality of life and hormones related to growth and puberty. The aim of the present study was to determine the time course of inflammatory, hormonal, and quality-of-life changes following a single dose of infliximab in the context of ongoing therapy, as related to presence of IBD symptoms at time of administration. METHODS: Children and adolescents with IBD receiving ongoing therapy with infliximab for clinical indications were recruited. The Pediatric Crohn's Disease Activity Index was determined at baseline and laboratory measures of high-sensitivity C-reactive protein (hsCRP) and hormones of growth and puberty were determined on days 0, 2, and 14. IBD-related quality of life (IMPACT III questionnaire) was tested on days 0 and 14. Subjects who had symptoms of IBD were compared with asymptomatic subjects. RESULTS: Subjects overall and in the symptomatic group exhibited improved hsCRP by day 2 following treatment. Symptomatic subjects had higher Pediatric Crohn's Disease Activity Index scores and lower quality-of-life scores than asymptomatic subjects on day 0, whereas at day 14 there were no significant differences in quality-of-life scores between the 2 groups. CONCLUSIONS: Even in the context of ongoing treatment, a single dose of infliximab results in decreased hsCRP, an improvement that is particularly noted among subjects who are symptomatic at the time of treatment. Although randomized trials are needed, these observational data may assist clinicians, patients, and families regarding expectations about timing and extent of these changes following a single treatment dose.},

   abstract = {PURPOSE: Several researchers have found that plasma citrulline could be a marker of reduced enterocyte mass. The aim of this study was to assess the relationship between plasma citrulline and bowel inflammation and/or disease location in pediatric and adolescent Crohn's disease (CD) patients. METHODS: Between January 2008 and January 2010, 31 CD patients and 44 controls were included in our study, and 15 out of the 31 CD patients continued a prospective survey. We evaluated the differences between groups, at baseline, in plasma citrulline and glutamine and between their baseline and final values during the prospective survey, and correlation between baseline values of citrulline and duration of disease, C-reactive protein, and fecal calprotectin. RESULTS: Mean citrulline value was 33.0 +/- 7.5 mumol/L in controls and 23.5 +/- 8.4 mumol/L in CD patients (P < 0.0001). Plasma citrulline was significantly lower in patients with small bowel (SB) location than in patient with only ileo-colon disease (14.2 +/- 5.5 and 24.7 +/- 8.0, respectively; P = 0.0037). Citrulline </=22 mumol/L reached sensitivity of 100% (95% confidence interval (CI) 54-100) and specificity of 98% (CI 89-99) in differentiating control subjects from CD with SB location. CONCLUSIONS: CD patients have reduced concentration of plasma citrulline than controls. Intestinal damage rather than inflammation seems to be responsible for the reduced biosynthesis of citrulline, which decreases particularly in CD patients with SB location. This finding suggests the potential role of citrulline as marker of disease location, but future works will be needed to confirm this suggestion.},

   abstract = {BACKGROUND: Growth failure remains a common complication of pediatric Crohn's disease (CD) and has been associated with small bowel involvement and need for surgery. We have reported that patients with elevated (>/= 1.6 mug/mL) granulocyte macrophage colony stimulating factor autoantibodies (GM-CSF Ab) are more likely to experience complicated ileal disease requiring surgery. We hypothesized that concurrent GM-CSF Ab and CARD15 risk allele carriage (C15(+) GMAb(+) ) would be associated with growth failure in CD and growth hormone (GH) resistance in murine ileitis. METHODS: We enrolled 229 pediatric CD patients at two sites and determined CARD15 genotype, serum GM-CSF Ab, and GH binding protein (GHBP), and height (HTz) and weight (WTz) z-scores at diagnosis. Ileitis was induced in card15-deficient mice by GM-CSF neutralization and nonsteroidal antiinflammatory drug (NSAID) exposure. Hepatic GH receptor (GHR) abundance and GH-dependent Stat5 activation were determined by western blot and Igf-I mRNA expression by real-time polymerase chain reaction (PCR). RESULTS: Mean (95% confidence interval [CI]) HTz at diagnosis was reduced to -0.48 (-4.2, 2.3) in C15(+) GMAb(+) patients, compared to -0.07 (-4.9, 3.4) in disease controls (P </= 0.05). Circulating GHBP, as a marker for tissue GHR abundance, was reduced in C15(+) GMAb(+) patients. Hepatic GHR abundance, GH induction of Stat5 tyrosine phosphorylation, and Igf-I mRNA expression were reduced in male card15-deficient mice with ileitis due to GM-CSF neutralization and NSAID exposure. CONCLUSIONS: Innate dysfunction due to concurrent genetic variation in CARD15 and neutralizing GM-CSF Ab is associated with linear growth failure in pediatric CD, and hepatic GH resistance in murine ileitis.},

   abstract = {OBJECTIVE: To describe the potential long-term risk of malnutrition after Roux-en-Y gastric bypass (GBP) through an uncommon occurrence of inflammatory bowel disease (IBD) postoperatively, which posed a serious threat to the nutritional status and the life of the patient. METHODS: We present a case report of a 44-year-old woman in whom Crohn disease developed 4 years after she had undergone GBP. The double insult of IBD and GBP resulted in severe malnutrition, with a serum albumin concentration of 0.9 g/dL (reference range, 3.5 to 5.0), weight loss, and watery diarrhea necessitating 6 hospital admissions during a period of 7 months. RESULTS: Ultimately, the administration of total parenteral nutrition with aggressive macronutrient, vitamin, and mineral repletion resulted in substantial improvement in the patient's strength, function, and quality of life, in parallel with diminished symptoms of IBD. CONCLUSION: Rarely, IBD develops after GBP, but the relationship between the 2 conditions remains unclear. Regardless, in addition to the altered anatomy after bariatric surgery, the further insult of IBD poses a severe threat to the nutritional status of affected patients. Malnutrition needs to be recognized and aggressively treated. Nutritional markers should be followed closely in this population of bariatric patients in an effort to avert the onset of severe malnutrition.},

Recognition of this entity is highly relevant to avoid malnutrition-related morbidity and mortality. Therapy of pancreatic exocrine insufficiency is based on the oral administration of pancreatic enzymes aiming at providing the duodenal lumen with sufficient amount of active lipase at the time of gastric emptying of nutrients. Administration of enzymes in form of enteric-coated minimicrospheres avoids acid-mediated lipase inactivation and ensures gastric emptying of enzymes in parallel with nutrients. Despite that, factors like an acidic intestinal pH and bacterial overgrowth may prevent normalization of fat digestion even in compliant patients. The present article critically reviews current therapeutic approaches to pancreatic exocrine insufficiency.},

   abstract = {The etiology of inflammatory bowel disease and, in particular, Crohn's disease involves a deregulated mucosal immune system under the influence of intestinal flora and environmental factors in genetically susceptible individuals. A new hypothesis has focused on mesenteric fat hypertrophy and the presence of ectopic fat surrounding inflamed bowel, the so-called creeping fat, which are hallmarks of Crohn's disease. Mesenteric adipose tissue is currently recognized as an active actor in immunity with a capacity for mediator secretion. These mediators include classic pro- and anti-inflammatory cytokines or chemokines and hormone-like adipokines with multiple effects. Mesenteric fat participates in the course of Crohn's disease and may play an active role in the regulation of intestinal inflammation. However, little is known about the origin and role of mesenteric fat in Crohn's disease, essentially because of a lack of experimental models that develop creeping fat. The purpose of this review is to present the recent data describing the immune properties of mesenteric fat and the recent advances in animal models, which have suggested a new hypothesis about the role of creeping fat in Crohn's disease.},

   abstract = {OBJECTIVE: Proper interactions between the intestinal mucosa, gut microbiota and nutrient flow are required to establish homoeostasis of the host. Since the proximal part of the small intestine is the first region where these interactions occur, and since most of the nutrient absorption occurs in the jejunum, it is important to understand the dynamics of metabolic responses of the mucosa in this intestinal region. DESIGN: Germ-free mice aged 8-10 weeks were conventionalised with faecal microbiota, and responses of the jejunal mucosa to bacterial colonisation were followed over a 30-day time course. Combined transcriptome, histology, (1)H NMR metabonomics and microbiota phylogenetic profiling analyses were used. RESULTS: The jejunal mucosa showed a two-phase response to the colonising microbiota. The acute-phase response, which had already started 1 day after conventionalisation, involved repression of the cell cycle and parts of the basal metabolism. The secondary-phase response, which was consolidated during conventionalisation (days 4-30), was characterised by a metabolic shift from an oxidative energy supply to anabolic metabolism, as inferred from the tissue transcriptome and metabonome changes. Detailed transcriptome analysis identified tissue transcriptional signatures for the dynamic control of the metabolic reorientation in the jejunum. The molecular components identified in the response signatures have known roles in human metabolic disorders, including insulin sensitivity and type 2 diabetes mellitus. CONCLUSION: This study elucidates the dynamic jejunal response to the microbiota and supports a prominent role for the jejunum in metabolic control, including glucose and energy homoeostasis. The molecular signatures of this process may help to find risk markers in the declining insulin sensitivity seen in human type 2 diabetes mellitus, for instance.},

   abstract = {BACKGROUND: Crohn's disease (CD) patients may be at increased risk for the development of Hodgkin's lymphoma (HL) or non-Hodgkin's lymphoma (NHL), either through exposure to immunosuppressive medications or due to their underlying chronic inflammatory illness. There are limited data regarding the natural history of CD following treatment of lymphoma. We present a series of CD patients who were treated for lymphoma and describe the natural history of their CD following lymphoma treatment. METHODS: Retrospective case series from three academic referral centers was used. All CD patients with a history of lymphoma were identified. Demographic data, CD medication exposure, and surgical procedures before and after lymphoma treatment were recorded. RESULTS: Nine CD patients with a history of lymphoma were identified. Eight individuals received chemotherapy, while one patient was observed without treatment. Eight patients remained free of lymphoma for a mean of 72.8 months (range 1-276 months). The ninth patient had recurrence of his HL 3 years after lymphoma diagnosis. Following lymphoma treatment, two patients had quiescent CD with no specific therapy. Three patients demonstrated significant clinical relapse of their CD and a fourth patient developed CD after treatment of her lymphoma, which ultimately required long-term immunomodulator therapy with 6-mercaptopurine or methotrexate in the first three patients, and azathioprine in the fourth. Four patients required CD surgery after lymphoma treatment. CONCLUSION: We report on the clinical course of CD in patients who develop lymphoma. Significant clinical relapse of CD following successful medical treatment of lymphoma occurred frequently in patients with a history of this neoplasm.},

   abstract = {BACKGROUND: Chronic intestinal failure (CIF) is a very rare Crohn's disease (CD) complication. AIM: To determine incidence of CIF treated with home parenteral nutrition (HPN) in adult CD patients and to isolate factors associated with severe CIF. METHODS: This retrospective multicentre study included 38 patients with CD-related CIF treated with HPN for at least 12 months in French HPN centres. Severe CIF was defined by a length of remnant small bowel of less than 100 cm or CIF occurrence within the 15 years following CD diagnosis. RESULTS: Median delay between CD diagnosis and CIF was 15 years. CIF incidence did not decrease over time (1.4/year before 1995 vs. 2.2/year after). Median number of small bowel resections per patient was three (range 1-8). Median small bowel resection, remnant and initial lengths were 160, 80 and 260 cm, respectively. Twenty-four per cent of patients developed stenosis within 1 year after CD diagnosis and 76% developed perforative complications within 2 years. In multivariate analysis, severe CIF, defined as CIF onset <15 years after CD diagnosis, was associated with a more recent CD diagnosis (odds ratio, 0.785; 95% confidence interval, 0.623-0.989). CIF occurred despite frequent use of immunosuppressants. Course of CD remained severe during HPN: immunosuppressants prescription occurred in 11 patients, surgery in six. Six patients died from CD (n = 2), HPN complications (n = 2) or other causes (n = 2). CONCLUSIONS: Chronic intestinal failure requiring HPN is rare during CD. Incidence remained stable over time. Surgical procedures play a minor role in the occurrence of severe chronic intestinal failure compared to CD severity.},

   abstract = {Growth retardation, associated with delayed puberty, is a frequent feature in pediatric patients with inflammatory bowel disease (IBD), especially with Crohn's disease. It is mainly induced by malnutrition and the effects of the inflammatory process on the growth hormone/insulin-like growth factor-1 axis or on the growth plate. Therefore, control of disease activity and mucosal healing are paramount to promote growth and adequate pubertal onset. Current therapeutic strategies for maintenance in IBD include anti-inflammatory drugs, immunosuppressives, and, more recently, biologic agents. Although these treatments are efficient in minimizing inflammation and inducing prolonged remission, their long-term effects on growth and final height remain controversial. Furthermore, glucocorticoid therapy, even though very efficient in inducing remission, clearly shows deleterious effects on growth, which is not the case for exclusive enteral nutrition showing comparable results regarding induction of remission. Thus regular assessment of weight, height and pubertal stage is essential in children and adolescents with chronic disease, namely IBD.},

   abstract = {BACKGROUND AND STUDY AIMS: Low dose photodynamic therapy (LDPDT) may modify the mucosal immune response and may thus provide a therapy for Crohn's disease. We evaluated the efficacy and safety of this technique in a murine T cell-mediated colitis model. METHODS: The safety of LDPDT was first tested in BALB/c mice. Naive T cells were used to induce colitis in mice with severe combined immunodeficiency, which were followed up endoscopically, and a murine endoscopic index of colitis (MEIC) was developed. The efficacy of LDPDT (10 J/cm (2); delta-aminolevulinic acid, 15 mg/kg bodyweight) was then tested on mice with moderate colitis, while a disease control group received no treatment. The MEIC, weight, length, and histology of the colon, cytokine expression indices, number of mucosal CD4 (+) T cells, percentage of apoptotic CD4 (+) T cells, body weight, and systemic side effects were evaluated. RESULTS: LDPDT improved the MEIC ( P = 0.011) and the histological score ( P = 0.025), diminished the expression indices of the proinflammatory cytokines, interleukin-6 ( P = 0.042), interleukin-17 ( P = 0.029), and interferon-gamma ( P = 0.014), decreased the number of mucosal CD4 (+) T cells, and increased the percentage of apoptotic CD4 (+) T cells compared with the disease control group. No local or systemic side effects occurred. CONCLUSION: LDPDT improves murine T cell-mediated colitis, decreases the proinflammatory cytokines interleukin-6, interleukin-17, and interferon-gamma, and decreases the number of CD4 (+) T cells. No adverse events were observed. Therefore, this technique is now being evaluated in patients with inflammatory bowel disease.},

   abstract = {OBJECTIVE: The aim of the study was to evaluate thalidomide as rescue therapy for pediatric patients with severe refractory Crohn disease (CD) who failed to respond to antitumor necrosis factor (TNF) biologic agents. PATIENTS AND METHODS: A computerized database was used to identify children with CD who had failed conventional immunosuppression therapy and received thalidomide rescue therapy. Twelve patients, mean age at diagnosis 10 years, were identified. Eight children had disease localized to the ileum and colon and 4 to the gastroduodenal area and colon. Five cases were complicated by strictures and 7 by fistulae. Previous drug therapy included azathioprine/6-mercaptopurine (11/12), methotrexate (7/12), and anti-TNF biologics (12/12). Outcome measures were Harvey-Bradshaw Index, change in prednisone dose, hospitalizations, bowel resections, and incision and drainage procedures. Laboratory evaluations were calculated before and after 1 to 6 months of thalidomide. RESULTS: Mean Harvey-Bradshaw Index score improved from 11.8 to 3.9 (P = 0.0004), mean prednisone dose decreased from 13.9 to 2.3 mg/day (P = 0.001), mean number of hospitalizations decreased from 6.3 to 1.3 (P = 0.002), and erythrocyte sedimentation rate decreased from 35 to 14 mm/h (P = 0.02). The surgery rate pre-thalidomide was 0.031 and on thalidomide was 0.004. Of the 7 patients with fistulae, 5 had complete fistula closure, 1 had partial closure, and 1 showed no improvement. Adverse reactions that resulted in discontinuation of thalidomide are as follows: 42% peripheral neuropathy, 17% worsening of the CD, 8% dizziness, and 8% allergic reaction. All 5 patients who developed peripheral neuropathy had clinical resolution of the neurologic symptoms within 2 to 3 months after stopping thalidomide. CONCLUSIONS: Thalidomide is a potentially effective rescue therapy for severe refractory CD in children who fail to respond to anti-TNF medications.},

   abstract = {Crohn's disease is a chronic relapsing condition that has no certain cure. Both genetic susceptibility and nutrition have key roles, but their level of involvement varies between patients. Interacting gene pathways influence the probability of disease development, but these are affected by stress and various environmental factors, including diet. In addition, the role of the gut microbiome must not be underestimated, as it is substantially altered in patients with Crohn's disease. Although an elemental diet might lead to disease remission, reintroducing real foods and sustainable diets in patients with Crohn's disease is currently difficult, and would benefit from the sensitivity and rapid feedback provided by the field of nutrigenomics. Nutrigenomics utilizes high-throughput genomics technologies to reveal changes in gene and protein expression that are modulated by the patient's nutrition. The most widely used technique thus far is transcriptomics, which permits measurement of changes in the expression of thousands of genes simultaneously in one sample. Given the volume of numbers generated in such studies, data-basing and bioinformatics are essential to ensure the correct application of nutrigenomics at the population level. These methods have been successfully applied to animal models of Crohn's disease, and the time is right to move them to human studies.},

   abstract = {OBJECTIVE: There is increasing knowledge of the pathophysiology behind inflammatory bowel disease (IBD) although the exact mechanism is far from fully understood. In the era of new technology, over the last years molecular approaches have shed light on the inflammatory mechanisms and their metabolic end products. This opens for a molecular fingerprinting that can be used in the biomarker field of IBD. There is a great need of biomarkers for prediction of clinical outcome and prognostic biomarker for prediction of therapeutic effects in IBD. Although the biomarker concept is old, so far very few really useful biomarkers exist in IBD. MATERIAL AND METHODS: Here, we review the predictive and prognostic biomarkers in IBD in the era of new technologies with emphasis on the potential of molecular fingerprinting. RESULTS: Very few candidate biomarkers have been documented. The most promising candidate predictor is tumor necrosis factor-alpha, but there is a lack of validation. CONCLUSION: So far, there are few biomarkers documented in IBD, but we are at the start of a new scientific field that will be of great value for the handling of the disease.},

AIM: To examine whether Aza/6-MP can be safely withdrawn in patients with Crohn's disease who have been in remission. METHODS: The following databases were searched: MEDLINE (1950-September 2010), EMBASE (1980-September 2010), CINHAL (1981-September 2010), PubMed (1950-September 2010), and the Cochrane Central Register of Controlled Trials (CENTRAL). Randomised controlled and cohort studies comparing azathioprine continuation versus placebo or no treatment were eligible for inclusion. Primary outcomes were relapse rate after discontinuation of Aza/6-MP at 6, 12, and 18 months, and 5 and 10 years. RESULTS: Five studies, with 256 patients and 168 controls, met the inclusion criteria. Stopping azathioprine/6-MP was found to significantly increase the risk of relapse at 6, 12, and 18 months with pooled odds ratios of 0.22 (95% CI 0.09-0.53), 0.25 (95% CI 0.11-0.56), and 0.35 (95% CI 0.21-0.6), respectively. Two trials examined relapse rate at 5 years with pooled OR 0.53 (95% CI 0.13-2.21). No trials looking at relapse rates beyond 5 years were identified. CONCLUSIONS: There is a clear benefit of continuing Aza/6-MP for at least 18 months to maintain remission for Crohn's disease patients who established remission. There is not enough evidence to provide clear guidance on whether or not to continue Aza/6-MP treatment beyond 18 months. Well-designed randomised controlled trials addressing this issue are needed.},

   abstract = {BACKGROUND AND AIMS: Increasing use of diagnostic radiography has led to concern about the malignant potential of ionizing radiation. We aimed to quantify the cumulative effective dose (CED) from diagnostic medical imaging in children with inflammatory bowel disease (IBD) and to identify which children are at greatest risk for high amounts of image-related radiation exposure. PATIENTS AND METHODS: A retrospective chart review of pediatric IBD patients seen between January 1 and May 30, 2008 was conducted. The effective dose of radiation received from all of the radiology tests performed during the course of each patient's treatment was estimated using typical effective doses and our institution's computed tomography dose index. A CED >/=50 mSv was considered high. RESULTS: Complete records were available for 257 of 372 screened subjects. One hundred seventy-one had Crohn disease (CD) and 86 had ulcerative colitis (UC). The mean CED was 17.56 +/- 15.91 mSv and was greater for children with CD than for those with UC (20.5 +/- 17.5 vs 11.7 +/- 9.9 mSv, P < 0.0001). Fifteen children (5.8%) had a CED >/=50 mSv, including 14 of 171 (8.2%) with CD and 1 of 86 (1.2%) with UC (P = 0.02). In children with CD, factors associated with high CED per multivariate analysis were any IBD-related surgery (odds ratio 42, 95% confidence interval 8-223, P < 0.0001) and platelet count (odds ratio 16, 95% confidence interval 1.5-175, P = 0.02). CONCLUSIONS: Although all doses of ionizing radiation have some malignancy-inducing potential, a small but important percentage of children with IBD are exposed to particularly high doses of ionizing radiation from diagnostic tests and procedures. Physicians caring for such patients must seek to limit radiation exposure whenever possible to lessen the lifetime risk of malignancy.},

   abstract = {Background. The challenging treatment of penetrating paediatric Crohn's disease (CD) involves pharmacological and surgical approaches. Despite a proved efficacy of anti-TNF agents for treatment of complex fistula, a large number of patients cannot achieve a complete healing and relapse during the followup. Aim. We report a paediatric case with CD and colonic perforation who was successfully treated with medical therapy only, including anti-TNFalpha. Case Presentation. During a colonoscopy performed on a 9-year-old girl with CD, a perforation occurred in correspondence of a fistula at the colonic splenic flexure. The formation of a collection was then detected (US, enteric-CT), as well as a fistula connecting the colon to the collection. The girl was kept fasting and treated with total parenteral nutrition and antibiotic therapy. Treatment with Infliximab was also started, and after the third dose a US control showed disappearance of the collection and healing of the enteric fistula. Parenteral nutrition was progressively substituted with enteral feeding, and no surgical treatments were needed. Discussion. In pubertal children with penetrating CD, the option of an efficacious medical treatment to avoid a major surgical approach on the bowel is to be aimed for growth improvement. This approach requires a strictly monitored long-term followup.},

   abstract = {New Zealand has one of the highest incidence rates of Crohn's Disease (CD), whilst the serum selenium status of New Zealanders is amongst the lowest in the world. A prospective case-control study in Auckland, New Zealand considered serum selenium as a potential CD risk factor. Serum selenium levels were significantly lower in CD patients compared to controls (101.8 +/- 1.02 vs. 111.1 +/- 1.01 ng/mL) (p = 5.91 x 10(-8)). Recent detailed studies in the United Kingdom have suggested an optimal serum level around 122 ng/mL, making the average CD patient in New Zealand selenium deficient. Of the 29 single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) tested, 13 were found to significantly interact with serum selenium on CD. After adjustment for multiple testing, a significant interaction with serum selenium on CD was found for three SNPs, namely rs17529609 and rs7901303 in the gene SEPHS1, and rs1553153 in the gene SEPSECS. These three SNPs have not been reported elsewhere as being significantly associated with selenium or CD. It is unclear as to whether lower selenium levels are a cause or an effect of the disease.},

   abstract = {Inflammatory bowel diseases (IBDs), Crohn's disease (CD), and ulcerative colitis (UC) are chronic inflammatory conditions, which are increasing in incidence, prevalence, and severity, in many countries. While there is genetic susceptibility to IBD, the probability of disease development is modified by diet, lifestyle, and endogenous factors, including the gut microbiota. For example, high intakes of mono- and disaccharides, and total fats consistently increases the risk developing both forms of IBD. High vegetable intake reduces the risk of UC, whereas increased fruit and/or dietary fiber intake appears protective against CD. Low levels of certain micronutrients, especially vitamin D, may increase the risk of both diseases. Dietary patterns may be even more important to disease susceptibility than the levels of individual foods or nutrients. Various dietary regimes may modify disease symptoms, in part through their actions on the host microbiota. Both probiotics and prebiotics may modulate the microflora, and reduce the likelihood of IBD regression. However, other dietary factors affect the microbiota in different ways. Distinguishing cause from effect, and characterizing the relative roles of human and microbial genes, diet, age of onset, gender, life style, smoking history, ethnic background, environmental exposures, and medications, will require innovative and internationally integrated approaches.},

   abstract = {Disease-associated undernutrition of all types is very common in paediatric inflammatory bowel disease (IBD). Recent weight loss remains one of the triad of clinical manifestations and a cornerstone for the diagnosis of Crohn's disease (CD), although significantly fewer patients now present as being underweight. Recent evidence suggests that the introduction of medical treatment will quickly restore body weight, although this does not reflect concomitant changes in body composition. CD children present with features of nutritional cachexia with normal fat stores but depleted lean mass. Poor bone health, delayed puberty and growth failure are additional features that further complicate clinical management. Suboptimal nutritional intake is a main determinant of undernutrition, although activation of the immune system and secretion of pro-inflammatory cytokines exert additional independent effects. Biochemically low concentrations of plasma micronutrients are commonly reported in IBD patients, although their interpretation is difficult in the presence of an acute phase response and other indices of body stores adequacy are needed. Anaemia is a common extraintestinal manifestation of the IBD child. Iron-deficient anaemia is the predominant type, with anaemia of chronic disease second. Decreased dietary intake, as a result of decreased appetite and food aversion, is the major cause of undernutrition in paediatric IBD. Altered energy and nutrient requirements, malabsorption and increased gastrointestinal losses are additional factors, although their contribution to undernutrition in paediatric CD needs to be studied further.},

GOALS: This study explored changes in fecal calprotectin concentration during treatment with EEN. STUDY: Fecal calprotectin was measured in 4 serial stool samples from CD children during EEN. The Pediatric Crohn's Disease Activity Index (PCDAI) and systemic markers of disease activity were measured at the beginning and end of treatment. RESULTS: Fifteen CD children (7 girls; 11.6+/-2.3 y) participated. PCDAI decreased in 14 children and 7 children achieved clinical remission (PCDAI </=10). Fecal calprotectin concentration decreased (30 d, P=0.014; 60 d, P<0.0001) only in those children who entered clinical remission (PCDAI </=10). In the whole group mean calprotectin concentration at baseline (2158+/-642 mg/kg) was reduced by 975 mg/kg (95% confidence interval -1783; -167) after 30 days and 1700 mg/kg (95% confidence interval -2508; -892) on EEN completion. Only one child reached normal levels by the end of EEN. Decrease of pretreatment calprotectin levels by more than 18% after 30 days on EEN predicted clinical response at the end of EEN. Calprotectin levels at the end of EEN treatment did not predict the length of time lapsed to a future relapse. CONCLUSIONS: In this pilot study calprotectin decreased in patients who achieved clinical remission and may be useful to predict response to treatment.},

   abstract = {BACKGROUND: Nutritional therapy is the primary treatment for active pediatric Crohn's disease (CD) in the UK/Europe, improving disease activity and anthropometry. This study assessed changes in micronutrient status during exclusive enteral nutrition (EEN). METHODS: Seventeen children (male/female: 8/9; median age: 12.7 years) with active CD were treated exclusively for 6-8 weeks on a polymeric feed (Modulen IBD; Nestle, UK). Body impedance was measured at baseline, during EEN, and posttreatment on normal diet and converted to z-scores of fat and lean mass. Blood samples for nutrient analysis were collected from 13 children at baseline, end of EEN, and posttreatment. RESULTS: Lean but not fat mass improved at the end of EEN (initiation vs. end of EEN; fat mass [z-score]: -0.5 vs. -0.3; P = 0.141; lean mass [z-score]: -2.1 vs. -0.8; P < 0.0001). At baseline several children presented with suboptimal concentrations of carotenoids, trace elements, vitamin C, B6, and folate in plasma but not in erythrocytes. EEN improved concentrations for several nutrients, but more than 90% of patients had depleted concentrations of all carotenoids. The latter improved on normal diet but other micronutrients, which improved during EEN, returned toward pretreatment concentrations. CONCLUSIONS: Lean but not fat mass improved at the end of EEN. Median concentrations for several plasma micronutrients improved on EEN but carotenoids were depleted. These findings may have implications for clinical practice and producers of enteral feeds. As plasma concentrations for many micronutrients can be affected by the acute phase response, measurements in erythrocytes may be a better marker of actual body stores.},

   abstract = {Chronic inflammatory disorders such as inflammatory bowel diseases (IBDs) affect bone metabolism and are frequently associated with the presence of osteopenia, osteoporosis, and increased risk of fractures. Although several mechanisms may contribute to skeletal abnormalities in IBD patients, inflammation and inflammatory mediators such as TNF, IL-1beta, and IL-6 may be the most critical. It is not clear whether the changes in bone metabolism leading to decreased mineral density are the result of decreased bone formation, increased bone resorption, or both, with varying results reported in experimental models of IBD and in pediatric and adult IBD patients. New data, including our own, challenge the conventional views, and contributes to the unraveling of an increasingly complex network of interactions leading to the inflammation-associated bone loss. Since nutritional interventions (dietary calcium and vitamin D supplementation) are of limited efficacy in IBD patients, understanding the pathophysiology of osteopenia and osteoporosis in Crohn's disease and ulcerative colitis is critical for the correct choice of available treatments or the development of new targeted therapies. In this review, we discuss current concepts explaining the effects of inflammation, inflammatory mediators and their signaling effectors on calcium and phosphate homeostasis, osteoblast and osteoclast function, and the potential limitations of vitamin D used as an immunomodulator and anabolic hormone in IBD.},

   abstract = {OBJECTIVES: The present UK criterion standard for assessing children with suspected inflammatory bowel disease (IBD) is upper endoscopy, ileocolonoscopy, and barium follow-through (BaFT). Significant doses of radiation, unpalatable contrast, and volume intolerance are involved with BaFT. Practice in investigating Crohn disease (CD) is changing with the increasing use of magnetic resonance imaging (MRI). The aim of the present study was to compare BaFT and a new abdominal MRI protocol in a paediatric IBD population. METHODS: All consecutive patients with a new diagnosis of IBD or requiring reassessment from September 2008 to December 2010 were investigated with both abdominal MRI and BaFT in accordance with a specific local paediatric IBD protocol. The studies were reported by nonblinded radiologists with an interest in gastrointestinal imaging. The reports were compared in conjunction with case note review. RESULTS: Eighty-seven patients underwent both BaFT and MRI abdomen. Thirty-one percent of patients had additional pathology on MRI, not seen on the BaFT. Sixty-seven percent of patients (n=59) had an MRI finding equivalent to BaFT. Using histology as a criterion standard for detecting terminal ileal disease, BaFT had a sensitivity and specificity of 76% and 67%, and MRI had a sensitivity and specificity of 83% and 95%, respectively. CONCLUSIONS: This is the largest series of small bowel MRI in a paediatric population. MRI reports were at least equivalent to BaFT. MRI had higher sensitivity and, particularly, specificity in detecting terminal ileal pathology. These findings suggest that MRI should become the criterion standard investigation in children with IBD in centres with appropriate expertise, with zero radiation exposure being highly advantageous.},

Adequate vitamin D status has been linked to decreased risks of developing specific cancers, including cancers of the esophagus, stomach, colon, rectum, gallbladder, pancreas, lung, breast, uterus, ovary, prostate, urinary bladder, kidney, skin, thyroid, and hematopoietic system (e.g., Hodgkin's lymphoma, non-Hodgkin's lymphoma, multiple myeloma); bacterial infections; rheumatoid arthritis; Crohn's disease; periodontal disease; multiple sclerosis; asthma; type 2 diabetes; cardiovascular disease; stroke; peripheral artery disease; hypertension; chronic kidney disease; muscle weakness; cognitive impairment; Alzheimer's disease; clinical depression; and premature death. On the other hand, inadequate vitamin D status during human pregnancy may be associated with increased risk for the development of type 1 diabetes in the offspring. However, this point of view may be excessively optimistic. There also is evidence that despite the current heavy reliance on serum 25-OHD(3) concentration for the diagnosis of an individual's vitamin D status, local tissue vitamin D intoxication may be present in individuals with much lower serum 25-OHD(3) concentrations than are currently appreciated. Only rarely are the symptoms of local tissue vitamin D intoxication associated with vitamin D status or intake. An individual's serum 25-OHD(3) concentration may appear to be "low" for reasons totally independent of sunlight exposure or vitamin D intake. Serum 25-OHD(3) concentration is only poorly responsive to increases in vitamin D intake, and the prolonged routine consumption of thousands of international units of vitamin D may interfere with the regulation of phosphate homeostasis by fibroblast growth factor-23 (FGF23) and the Klotho gene product, with consequences that are detrimental to human health. In light of these counterbalancing observations, curbing excessive enthusiasm for universally increasing vitamin D intake recommendations may be in order.},

   abstract = {The rat treated with streptozotocin has been proposed as the most appropriate model of systemic oxidative stress for studying antioxidant therapies. In that sense, rosemary extracts have long been recognized as having antioxidant properties, and folic acid may be able to improve endothelial progenitor cell function. A mixture containing both has been tested as a possible nutraceutical to improve health complications in diabetes. We have developed the methodology to evaluate metabolic changes in the urine of streptozotocin-induced diabetic rats after supplementing their diet with rosemary extract obtained with supercritical fluids (SFE) containing 10% folic acid in an acute but short-term study. It has been done with a metabolomics approach using LC-QTOF as an analytical tool. About 20 endogenous metabolites have been identified by databases and MS/MS showing statistically significant changes. Among them, several amino acids and their metabolites point to changes due to the effect of the gut microbiota. In addition, the comparison between control and streptozotocin-diabetic rats has permitted the showing of some metabolic coincidences between type 1 diabetes and other (possible) autoimmune diseases such as autism and/or Crohn's disease, and the nutraceutical intervention has succeeded in inducing changes in such biomarkers.},

   abstract = {BACKGROUND AND AIMS: The commensal microbiota of the gastrointestinal tract plays an important role in the pathogenesis of inflammatory bowel disease. We examined the horizontal structure of the fecal microbiota in the colon in adolescents with Crohn disease or ulcerative colitis and a control group. PATIENTS AND METHODS: Fecal samples were collected in 3 fractions from patients with Crohn disease (n = 22), ulcerative colitis (n = 12), and controls (n = 24) during preparation for colonoscopy. Additionally, biopsies from colon tissue were taken. Samples were examined using a culture technique and a fluorescent in situ hybridization method. The mucin degradation assay was carried out. RESULTS: Quantitative composition of the microbiota was different in the consecutive 3 fecal fractions and in the colon tissue of the study groups, but in patients from the control group, the composition of microbiota in the consecutive fractions was similar. Statistical analyses showed that the total distribution of the studied bacterial taxons in the contents in all 3 fecal fractions and in the colon tissue in the given disease group, and in the control group was characteristic for the studied patient group. Differences in species distribution among the cohorts studied were highly significant (P < 0.0001). Moreover, it was shown that in the fecal fraction I and in the colon tissue samples, there is no significant difference for any of the analyzed bacterial groups, using the culture methods or fluorescent in situ hybridization, but significant results were demonstrated in the II and III fractions for specific bacterial groups. The bacterial flora attached to the mucus layer in the UC group had significantly more degraded mucus in comparison with the control group (P = 0.045). CONCLUSIONS: Distribution of the microbiota in the colon is layered, which can be called horizontal distribution of the fecal flora. Only in the ulcerative colitis group, the bacterial flora attached to the mucous layer exerts action on the mucin.},

   abstract = {Crohn's disease (CD) together with ulcerative colitis (UC) and indeterminate colitis (IC) are the so called inflammatory bowel diseases (IBD). Epidemiological data show an increased incidence of both UC and CD and, especially in North America and in Europe, an increased prevalence of CD. European data show that northern countries present higher rates of IBD than southern ones. It is estimated that 15%-20% of CD patients experience onset of their symptoms under 20 years of age. An increasing number of children enter disease before 8 years of age. The pathogenesis of CD has became more documented involving both the immune system and changes in intestinal microbiota. Chronic abdominal pain associated with failure to thrive and inflammatory syndrome with or without intestinal transit disorders suggest CD. Onset of a anoperineal disease is also suggestive of CD and is a severity sign. The diagnosis is based on clinical history, physical examination, radiological studies, endoscopy, and histology. CD is defined by evidence of a discontinuous chronic inflammation of the gastrointestinal tract with or without granulomas and supported by clinical, biochemical, and radiological evidence. Treatment aims to reducing inflammation and restauring growth. Enteral feeding has become a key issue in allowing to avoid steroids. Immunosuppressive treatment based on azathioprine is increasingly used for maintaining remission. Anti-TNF treatment is a rescue therapy in case of refractory, frequently relapsing disease especially those with ano-perineal disease.},

   abstract = {AIM: The general use of exclusive enteral nutrition (EEN) as therapy for children with Crohn's disease (CD) in Sweden has not previously been studied. Thus, the aim of this study was to investigate how EEN is used as therapy in Sweden for children with CD. METHODS: A questionnaire was sent to all 37 paediatric units in Sweden that treat children with inflammatory bowel disease. RESULTS: The response rate was 78%, which covers nearly 90% of Sweden's paediatric population between 0 and 17 years of age. Ninety-six per cent of the units used EEN as a treatment option for children with CD, and 65% of the units used EEN as their primary therapy in newly diagnosed CD. The standard duration of EEN was 6 weeks, but the questionnaire revealed a span of 4-8 weeks. The use of polymeric formula was just as common as a combination of polymeric and elemental formulas. Fifty-seven per cent used oral nutrition supplements, and 81% allowed some extent of concomitant feeding, the addition of food and fluids, during EEN. All units used enteral nutrition to some extent as maintenance therapy after EEN was discontinued. CONCLUSIONS: In Sweden, EEN is used as therapy for children with Crohn's disease (CD), but the EEN protocols vary as to choice of formula and type of food and fluids allowed during EEN. Standardized EEN protocols would enable multicentre studies in Sweden, with the objective of investigating how EEN treatment can be improved and employed in the most efficient way.},

METHODS: Newly diagnosed CD children were randomized to EF or PF for 6 weeks. Change in the Pediatric Crohn's Disease Activity Index (PCDAI), fecal calprotectin, and plasma fatty acids were measured at 0 and 6 weeks. Patients were followed up for 2 years. Time and treatment choice for first relapse were documented. RESULTS: Thirty-four children completed the study; EF: 15 (7 M, 8 F), PF: 19 (13 M, 6 F). The mean age was (years) EF: 12.6, PF: 11.7. Ninety-three percent of children (14/15) achieved remission in the EF group and 79% (15/19) in the PF group. One-third of patients maintained remission for 2 years. Mean time to relapse (days); EF: 183 (63-286), PF: 162 (53-301). Most children who relapsed used feed as a treatment for that relapse (EF: 9/10 and PF: 8/13). With PF, an increase of eicosapentanoic acid (EPA) and alpha linolenic acid was found with a reciprocal decrease in arachidonic acid (AA). With EF, AA and EPA levels were reduced with a significant decrease in docosahexaenoic acid. Fecal calprotectin measurements decreased significantly but did not normalize at the end of week 6. CONCLUSIONS: There was no significant difference between EF and PF in inducing remission. One-third of children maintained remission. Changes in plasma polyunsaturated fatty acid status were subtle and may be relevant; however, further evaluation is recommended.},

   abstract = {Inflammatory bowel diseases (IBD) including ulcerative colitis and Crohn's disease are chronically relapsing, immune-mediated disorders of the gastrointestinal tract. A major challenge in the treatment of IBD is the heterogenous nature of these pathologies. Both, ulcerative colitis and Crohn's disease are of multifactorial etiology and feature a complex interaction of host genetic susceptibility and environmental factors such as diet and gut microbiota. Genome-wide association studies identified disease-relevant single-nucleotide polymorphisms in approximately 100 genes, but at the same time twin studies also clearly indicated a strong environmental impact in disease development. However, attempts to link dietary factors to the risk of developing IBD, based on epidemiological observations showed controversial outcomes. Yet, emerging high-throughput technologies implying complete biological systems might allow taking nutrient-gene interactions into account for a better classification of patient subsets in the future. In this context, 2 new scientific fields, "nutrigenetics" and "nutrigenomics" have been established. "Nutrigenetics," studying the effect of genetic variations on nutrient-gene interactions and "Nutrigenomics," describing the impact of nutrition on physiology and health status on the level of gene transcription, protein expression, and metabolism. It is hoped that the integration of both research areas will promote the understanding of the complex gene-environment interaction in IBD etiology and in the long-term will lead to personalized nutrition for disease prevention and treatment. This review briefly summarizes data on the impact of nutrients on intestinal inflammation, highlights nutrient-gene interactions, and addresses the potential of applying "omic" technologies in the context of IBD.},

   abstract = {BACKGROUND AND AIMS: enteral (EN) and parenteral (TPN) nutrition exert variable therapeutic effects on the induction and maintenance of remission in inflammatory bowel disease (IBD). This review aims to provide an updated discussion on the complex relationship between diet and IBD. METHODS: medline, Cochrane and Scopus database searches were conducted. Sources cited in the articles obtained were also searched to identify other potential sources of information. RESULTS: nutritional status is significantly compromised in IBD patients, especially those with Crohn's disease (CD). Apart from restoring malnourishment, dietary components contribute to modulate intestinal immune responses. Nutritional treatment is divided into support therapy and primary therapy to induce and maintain remission through TPN and EN. EN is considered a first-line therapy in children with active CD whereas it is usually used in adult CD patients when corticosteroid therapy is not possible. TPN has limited effects on IBD.En formula composition, in terms of carbohydrates, nitrogen source and bioactive molecules supplementation, differentially influence on IBD treatment outcomes. Other dietary components, such as poorly absorbed short-chain carbohydrate, polyols, and exogenous microparticles, also participate in the etiopathogenesis of IBD. Finally, new approaches to understanding the complex relationship between IBD and diet are provided by nutrigenenomic. CONCLUSION: further long-term, well-powered studies are required to accurately assess the usefulness of nutrition in treating IBD. In future research, the potential role of nutrient-gene interaction in drug trials and specific dietary formula compositions should be investigated in order to incorporate new knowledge about the etiopathology of IBD into nutritional intervention.},

   abstract = {Intestinal epithelial cells (IEC) are organised as a single cell layer which covers the intestine. Their primary task is to absorb nutrients present in the intestinal lumen. However, IEC also play an important role in the immune defence of our body by building a barrier that separates the bowel wall from potentially hazardous bacteria present in the gut lumen. The life cycle of IEC is determined by the time span in which cells migrate from their place of origin at the crypt base to the villus tip, from where they are shed into the lumen. Cell death in the intestinal epithelium has to be tightly regulated and irregularities might cause pathologies. Excessive cell death has been associated with chronic inflammation as seen in patients with Crohn's disease and ulcerative colitis. While until recently apoptosis was discussed as being essential for epithelial turnover and tissue homeostasis in the intestinal epithelium, recent data using gene deficient mice have challenged this concept. Moreover, an apoptosis-independent mode of programmed cell death, termed necroptosis, has been identified and described in the intestinal epithelium. The following article reviews previous studies on cell death regulation in IEC and a potential role of necroptosis for gut homeostasis.},

METHODS: We compared the age at menarche of 34 CD patients with that for 545 controls, using data in the National Health and Nutrition Examination Survey (NHANES). RESULTS: Mean chronological age (CA) of CD patients (15.6 years) did not differ from that of the NHANES cohort (15.7 years; P = 0.91). The median CA at menarche (13.9 years) in CD was older than in the NHANES sample (12.0 years) (P < 0.00005). In CD patients, the cumulative incidence of menarche was 10 % at CA 12 years, 51 % at CA 14 years, and 100 % at CA 16 years. Sixty-eight percent reached menarche by bone age (BA) 13.5 years and 100 % by BA greater than 14.0 years. Menarche occurred earliest in South Asians, followed by East Asians, and then Caucasians (P = 0.02). CONCLUSIONS: CA at menarche is delayed in CD compared with the NHANES cohort. BA at menarche in CD is similar to BA at menarche reported for healthy children. CA at menarche in CD differs by race. If menarche has not occurred by BA greater than 14.0 years, endocrinology referral should be considered.},

   abstract = {Extensive research over the past half century has shown that curcumin (diferuloylmethane), a component of the golden spice turmeric (Curcuma longa), can modulate multiple cell signaling pathways. Extensive clinical trials over the past quarter century have addressed the pharmacokinetics, safety, and efficacy of this nutraceutical against numerous diseases in humans. Some promising effects have been observed in patients with various pro-inflammatory diseases including cancer, cardiovascular disease, arthritis, uveitis, ulcerative proctitis, Crohn's disease, ulcerative colitis, irritable bowel disease, tropical pancreatitis, peptic ulcer, gastric ulcer, idiopathic orbital inflammatory pseudotumor, oral lichen planus, gastric inflammation, vitiligo, psoriasis, acute coronary syndrome, atherosclerosis, diabetes, diabetic nephropathy, diabetic microangiopathy, lupus nephritis, renal conditions, acquired immunodeficiency syndrome, beta-thalassemia, biliary dyskinesia, Dejerine-Sottas disease, cholecystitis, and chronic bacterial prostatitis. Curcumin has also shown protection against hepatic conditions, chronic arsenic exposure, and alcohol intoxication. Dose-escalating studies have indicated the safety of curcumin at doses as high as 12 g/day over 3 months. Curcumin's pleiotropic activities emanate from its ability to modulate numerous signaling molecules such as pro-inflammatory cytokines, apoptotic proteins, NF-kappaB, cyclooxygenase-2, 5-LOX, STAT3, C-reactive protein, prostaglandin E(2), prostate-specific antigen, adhesion molecules, phosphorylase kinase, transforming growth factor-beta, triglyceride, ET-1, creatinine, HO-1, AST, and ALT in human participants. In clinical trials, curcumin has been used either alone or in combination with other agents. Various formulations of curcumin, including nanoparticles, liposomal encapsulation, emulsions, capsules, tablets, and powder, have been examined. In this review, we discuss in detail the various human diseases in which the effect of curcumin has been investigated.},

   abstract = {BACKGROUND: The observed heritability of inflammatory bowel disease (IBD) is incompletely explained by known genetic risk factors. Kindred-specific genetic variants that cause IBD may be a source of "missing heritability." Given that they have been previously difficult to identify, we sought to identify high-risk IBD kindreds. METHODS: We used a large population-based database--the Utah Population Database (UPDB)--which contains genealogical and healthcare data to characterize the risk of Crohn's disease (CD), ulcerative colitis (UC), and IBD in kindreds. We identified CD and UC cases using ICD-9 codes. We calculated the adjusted relative risk to relatives of affected individuals. We calculated the familial standardized incidence ratio (FSIR) to quantify the kindred-specific disease risk. RESULTS: In all, 3601 CD cases and 3976 UC cases met inclusion criteria. A total of 655 CD kindreds and 615 UC kindreds had a statistical excess of disease. Risk of disease varied among kindreds, with some kindreds demonstrating approximately 20-fold elevated risk. For CD, UC, and IBD, relative risks were significantly elevated for first- and second-degree relatives and first cousins. The adjusted population attributable risks for familial CD, UC, and IBD were 0.20 (95% confidence interval [CI]: 0.17-0.23); 0.17 (0.14-0.21); and 0.19 (0.17-0.22), respectively. CONCLUSIONS: We identified multiple kindreds with a statistical excess of CD, UC, and IBD, and validated the UPDB as a resource for family studies in IBD. Given the need for novel genetic mapping strategies to explain the apparent missing heritability in IBD, further studies of these high-risk kindreds is justified.},

Our objective was to describe a 14-year-old patient with BBS who presented with Crohn disease (CD), primary sclerosing cholangitis (PSC), and thyroiditis in the context of a cohort review at Sainte-Justine Hospital and to alert clinicians to the increased risk of autoimmune disorders in these patients. The cohort contained fifteen patients (9 boys), followed from 1968 to 2009 during a median period of 12 years (range 9 months-26 years). Three of the 15 patients (20%) developed a chronic autoimmune disease: one had juvenile rheumatoid arthritis; a second one had type 1 diabetes mellitus in association with Hashimoto thyroiditis and psoriasis; a third one developed CD, PSC, and Hashimoto thyroiditis. As chronic autoimmune diseases occurred in 20% of our cohort of children with BBS, it is appropriate to keep this association in mind during the followup.},

   abstract = {With the use of molecular techniques, numerous studies have evaluated the composition of the intestinal microbiota in health and disease. However, it is of major interest to supplement this with a functional analysis of the microbiota. In this review, the different approaches that have been used to characterize microbial metabolites, yielding information on the functional end products of microbial metabolism, have been summarized. To analyze colonic microbial metabolites, the most conventional way is by application of a hypothesis-driven targeted approach, through quantification of selected metabolites from carbohydrate (e.g., short-chain fatty acids) and protein fermentation (e.g., p-cresol, phenol, ammonia, or H(2)S), secondary bile acids, or colonic enzymes. The application of stable isotope-labeled substrates can provide an elegant solution to study these metabolic pathways in vivo. On the other hand, a top-down approach can be followed by applying metabolite fingerprinting techniques based on (1)H-NMR or mass spectrometric analysis. Quantification of known metabolites and characterization of metabolite patterns in urine, breath, plasma, and fecal samples can reveal new pathways and give insight into physiological regulatory processes of the colonic microbiota. In addition, specific metabolic profiles can function as a diagnostic tool for the identification of several gastrointestinal diseases, such as ulcerative colitis and Crohn's disease. Nevertheless, future research will have to evaluate the relevance of associations between metabolites and different disease states.},

   abstract = {Our therapeutic goals for the treatment of ulcerative colitis and Crohn's disease are evolving. Until the last decade the goals were primarily the treatment of symptoms. Regulatory approval for ulcerative colitis therapies have been based on short-term improvements in clinical indices and, most recently, the ability to heal the colonic mucosa, whereas approval for Crohn's disease therapies have been based on reductions in the CDAI (Crohn's Disease Activity Index). Over the past decade there has been increasing evidence in favor of more 'objective' measures of biologic disease activity including biomarkers such as C-reactive protein and mucosal healing in Crohn's disease and the histologic resolution of active inflammation in ulcerative colitis. The objective changes have provided expanded therapeutic goals based on longer-term maintenance therapies with the potential to modify the chronic disease behavior and to reduce pharmacoeconomic costs (reductions in hospitalizations, surgeries and neoplasia).},

   abstract = {The primary purpose of this study was to test whether recombinant human growth hormone (rhGH) supplementation would enhance protein synthesis and accretion of lean body mass. Eight adolescents (six males and two females; 17.2 +/- 2.6 years; age range, 13.7-21.2 years) participated in a randomized double-blind placebo-controlled cross-over trial of rhGH. We employed stable isotopes to measure proteolysis and protein synthesis during fasting and fed conditions during two 6-month treatment conditions. We also measured bone mineral density (BMD), markers of bone turnover, and body composition. Whole-body proteolysis, phenylalanine catabolism, and protein synthesis did not differ during treatment with rhGH vs. placebo. Enteral nutrition suppressed proteolysis and increased protein synthesis similarly during placebo and rhGH treatments. We conclude that rhGH is unlikely to provide sufficient metabolic benefit to warrant its use as an adjunct treatment in clinically stable adolescents with Crohn disease. A high prevalence of vitamin D deficiency and suboptimal BMD existed, which deserves further investigation and clinical attention.},

Risk factors for postoperative disease recurrence help guide the physician in determining the appropriate treatment strategy after Crohn's disease surgery.

This review elucidates current understanding of the natural course of postoperative Crohn's disease, monitoring for recurrence, the risk factors for recurrence, and provides insight into an evolving new paradigm for postoperative Crohn's disease treatment.},

   abstract = {OBJECTIVES: : The objective of the present study was to quantify the national pediatric inpatient inflammatory bowel disease (IBD) burden in terms of the number of IBD-related hospitalizations, the number of days spent in the hospital, and hospitalization costs. METHODS: : Hospitalizations for children and adolescents 20 years and younger with a primary diagnosis of either Crohn disease (CD) or ulcerative colitis (UC) were selected from the 2006 Kids' Inpatient Database (KID). Length of the hospital stay in days (LOS) and charges for the hospitalization were found directly in the Kids' Inpatient Database, and cost was calculated using the hospital's cost-to-charge ratio. Predictor variables included patient characteristics, such as age and severity of illness, and hospital characteristics. Ordinary-least-squares regressions were developed and estimated to explain hospitalization costs. RESULTS: : In 2006, there were 10,777 IBD-related hospitalizations. The total and mean costs for CD were $66.3 million and $10,176 (95% confidence interval [CI] $9647-$10,705), and for UC were $48.6 million and $11,836 (95% CI $10,760-$12,912). For CD, 0- to 5-year-old patients had the highest mean LOS (8.10, 95% CI 5.53-10.67, days) and mean cost ($13,894, 95% CI $9053-$18,735), whereas, for UC, 11- to 15-year-old patients had the highest mean LOS (7.49, 95% CI 6.88-8.10, 95% CI 5.53-10.67, days) and mean cost ($13,407, 95% CI $11,704-$15,110). CONCLUSIONS: : For a pediatric disease with a rather low prevalence rate, the estimated annual inpatient pediatric burden of IBD is a sizeable $152.4 million (2010 US$) and 64,985 days spent in the hospital. As medications and outpatient treatments improve for the treatment of IBD, there is an opportunity for significant reduction in inpatient burden.},

   abstract = {Crohn's disease (CD) is an incurable intestinal disorder in which the loss of immune tolerance to the commensal gut microbiota leads to chronic inflammation. The reason this occurs in specific individuals is unclear; however, a genetic predisposition is fundamental and relatives of patients with CD are at significant risk of developing the disease. Knowledge relating to the genetic loci that predispose to CD is accumulating, which raises the possibility of disease prediction and prevention in susceptible populations. However, the genetic basis of CD is complex and genotyping alone is likely to be insufficient to predict disease risk accurately. Specific physiological abnormalities associated with CD, such as increased intestinal permeability and raised faecal calprotectin, are also abnormal in some relatives of patients with CD. The combination of genotypic factors and biomarkers of risk makes the development of models of disease prediction a realistic possibility. Furthermore, enhanced understanding of the genotype and phenotype of the at-risk state in relatives of patients with CD allows the earliest stages in the pathogenesis of CD to be investigated and may allow intervention to prevent disease onset. This article reviews current knowledge of the at-risk phenotype in relatives of patients with CD and focuses on the implications for the design of future studies.},

   abstract = {Immunomodulatory actions of vitamin D have been recognised for over a quarter of a century, but it is only in the last few years that the significance of this to normal human physiology has become apparent. Two key factors have underpinned this revised perspective. Firstly, there are increasing data linking vitamin insufficiency with prevalent immune disorders. Improved awareness of low circulating levels of precursor 25-hydroxyvitamin D in populations across the globe has prompted epidemiological investigations of health problems associated with vitamin D insufficiency. Prominent among these are autoimmune diseases such as multiple sclerosis, type 1 diabetes and Crohn's disease, but more recent studies indicate that infections such as tuberculosis may also be linked to low 25-hydroxyvitamin D levels. The second factor expanding the link between vitamin D and the immune system is our improved knowledge of the mechanisms that facilitate this association. It is now clear that cells from the immune system contain all the machinery needed to convert 25-hydroxyvitamin D to active 1,25-dihydroxyvitamin D, and for subsequent responses to 1,25-dihydroxyvitamin D. Mechanisms such as this are important for promoting antimicrobial responses to pathogens in macrophages, and for regulating the maturation of antigen-presenting dendritic cells. The latter may be a key pathway by which vitamin D controls T-lymphocyte (T-cell) function. However, T-cells also exhibit direct responses to 1,25-dihydroxyvitamin D, notably the development of suppressor regulatory T-cells.

   abstract = {Peptidoglycan (PGN) is a ubiquitous bacterial membrane product that, despite its well known pro-inflammatory properties, has also been invoked in immuno-tolerance of the gastrointestinal tract. PGN-induced mucosal IL-10 secretion and downregulation of Toll like receptors are potential mechanisms of action in the gut but there are few data on tolerogenic adaptive immune responses and PGN. Here, using blood-derived mononuclear cells, we showed that PGN induced marked cell surface expression of PD-L1 but not PD-L2 or CD80/CD86, and specifically in the CD14(+) monocytic fraction. This was reproduced at the gene level with rapid induction (<4 h) and, unlike for LPS stimulation, was still sustained at 24 h. Using transfected and native muramyl dipeptide (MDP), which is a cleavage product of PGN and a specific NOD2 agonist, in assays with wild type cells or those from patients with Crohn's disease carrying the Leu1007 frameshift mutation of NOD2, we showed that (i) both NOD2 dependent and independent signalling (appearing TLR2 mediated) occurred for PGN upregulation of PD-L1 (ii) upregulation is lost in response to MDP in patients with the homozygous mutation and (iii) PD-L1 upregulation was unaffected in patients with heterozygous mutations as previously reported for cytokine responses to MDP. The uptake of PGN and its cleavage products by the intestinal mucosa is well recognised and further work should consider PD-L1 upregulation as one potential mechanism of the commensal flora-driven intestinal immuno-tolerance. Indeed, recent work has shown that loss of PD-L1 signalling in the gut breaks CD8(+) T cell tolerance to self antigen and leads to severe autoimmune enteritis.},

   abstract = {OBJECTIVES: Long-term data on the influence of cigarette smoking, especially cessation, on the risk of Crohn's disease (CD) and ulcerative colitis (UC) are limited. METHODS: We conducted a prospective study of 229,111 women in the Nurses' Health Study (NHS) and Nurses' Health Study II (NHS II). Biennially, we collected updated data on cigarette smoking, other risk factors, and diagnoses of CD or UC confirmed by medical record review. RESULTS: Over 32 years in NHS and 18 years in NHS II, we documented 336 incident cases of CD and 400 incident cases of UC. Compared with never smokers, the multivariate hazard ratio (HR) of CD was 1.90 (95% confidence interval (CI), 1.42-2.53) among current smokers and 1.35 (95% CI, 1.05-1.73) among former smokers. Increasing pack-years was associated with increasing risk of CD (Ptrend < 0.0001), whereas smoking cessation was associated with an attenuation of risk. By contrast, the multivariate HR of UC was 0.86 (95% CI, 0.61-1.20) among current smokers and 1.56 (95% CI, 1.26-1.93) among former smokers. The risk of UC was significantly increased within 2-5 years of smoking cessation (HR, 3.06; 95% CI, 2.00-4.67) and remained persistently elevated over 20 years. CONCLUSIONS: Current smoking is associated with an increased risk of CD, but not UC. By contrast, former smoking is associated with an increased risk of UC, with risk persisting over two decades after cessation.},

   abstract = {There is evidence to suggest that the inflammation associated with Crohn's disease (CD) impacts the bone health of patients, predisposing them to early onset osteoporosis and increasing their risk of fracture. Fractures have been documented in patients with CD, with a high proportion of these being found during young adulthood, which suggests that these patients are not simply fracturing as a result of the normal aging process but rather due to the presence of CD. In population terms, patients with CD have increased risk of fracture compared with the general population. Studies in children suggest that, irrespective of time on corticosteroid therapy, the underlying systemic inflammation associated with CD is an independent detrimental influence on the bone health of children with CD. This poses the question as to whether the onset of disease in childhood predisposes the individual to increased risk of future fractures later in life, as a result of decreased peak bone mass during the growing years. It is generally believed that dual energy x-ray absorptiometry-assessed areal bone mineral density is a good indicator of fracture risk; however, several studies have shown this may not be the case. New research, utilizing peripheral quantitative computed tomography, which provides a true volumetric assessment of bone, suggests altered bone geometry in patients with CD, which poses a structural threat by being more brittle and susceptible to damage accumulation.},

   abstract = {BACKGROUND: Paediatric onset inflammatory bowel disease (IBD) may cause alterations in energy requirements and invalidate the use of standard prediction equations. Our aim was to evaluate four commonly used prediction equations for resting energy expenditure (REE) in children with IBD. METHODS: Sixty-three children had repeated measurements of REE as part of a longitudinal research study yielding a total of 243 measurements. These were compared with predicted REE from Schofield, Oxford, FAO/WHO/UNU, and Harris-Benedict equations using the Bland-Altman method. RESULTS: Mean (+/-SD) age of the patients was 14.2 (2.4) years. Mean measured REE was 1566 (336) kcal per day compared with 1491 (236), 1441 (255), 1481 (232), and 1435 (212) kcal per day calculated from Schofield, Oxford, FAO/WHO/UNU, and Harris-Benedict, respectively. While the Schofield equation demonstrated the least difference between measured and predicted REE, it, along with the other equations tested, did not perform uniformly across all subjects, indicating greater errors at either end of the spectrum of energy expenditure. Smaller differences were found for all prediction equations for Crohn's disease compared with ulcerative colitis. CONCLUSIONS: Of the commonly used equations, the equation of Schofield should be used in pediatric patients with IBD when measured values are not able to be obtained.},

   abstract = {BACKGROUND: One of the problems associated with infliximab (IFX) treatment for Crohn's disease (CD) is loss of response during maintenance therapy. AIMS: The aim of this multicenter, retrospective, cohort study was to determine whether enteral nutrition (EN) added to the IFX therapy regimen is effective for maintaining remission in adult CD patients. METHODS: Patients with CD who had started IFX therapy between April 2003 and March 2008 at any one of the seven participating medical centers and who met the following inclusion criteria were enrolled in the study: remission after triple infusions of IFX followed by IFX maintenance therapy every 8 weeks, and follow-up data available for >/= 1 year. Remission was defined as a C-reactive protein (CRP) level of <0.3 mg/dL, and recurrence was defined as an increase in CRP to >/= 1.5 mg/dL or shortening of the IFX interval. Patients were classified by EN dosage into two groups (EN group and non-EN group). The cumulative remission period and related factors were analyzed. RESULTS: Of the 102 adult CD patients who met the inclusion criteria, 45 were in the EN group and 57 were in the non-EN group. The cumulative remission rate was significantly higher in the EN group than in the non-EN group (P = 0.009). Multivariate analysis revealed that EN was the only suppressive factor for disease recurrence (P = 0.01). CONCLUSIONS: The results demonstrate that among this CD patient cohort, EN combined with IFX maintenance treatment was clinically useful for maintaining remission.},

METHODS: We analyzed data from all hospitalized children who underwent stool detection of C. difficile toxins A and B (n = 757) in a 5.5-year study period. RESULTS: The number of positive tests was significantly increased in the oncology group compared to the IBD group (12.45 vs. 6.02%, p = 0.03) and immunocompetent group (12.45 vs. 5.7%, p = 0.01). Patients who had C. difficile infection used antibiotics prior to the test more often than patients who did not (12.69 vs. 1.73%, p = 0.03). Pearson's correlation was positive for C. difficile infection and both antibiotics and immunosuppressants, while no correlation was found regarding age and gender. There were no significant differences regarding either IBD diagnosis (Crohn's disease vs. ulcerative colitis, p = 0.71) or treatment used for IBD (p = 0.53) and C. difficile infection. CONCLUSION: In our setting, the incidence of C. difficile infection among hospitalized children with active IBD was found to be low. Children at increased risk for C. difficile infection were oncology patients receiving immunosuppressants and antibiotics.},

   abstract = {AIMS: To describe the change in incidence of paediatric inflammatory bowel disease (IBD) observed at the National Centre for Paediatric Gastroenterology, Hepatology and Nutrition, and to determine whether the presenting disease phenotype and disease outcomes have changed during the past decade. METHODS: The annual incidence of IBD in Irish children aged <16 years was calculated for the years 2000-2010. Two subsets of patients, group A (diagnosed between 1 January 2000 and 31 December 2001), and group B (diagnosed between 1 January and 31 December 2008) were phenotyped according to the Paris Classification. Phenotype at diagnosis and 2-year follow-up were then compared. RESULTS: 406 new cases of IBD were identified. The incidence was 2.5/100 000/year in 2001, 7.3 in 2008 and 5.6 in 2010, representing a significant increase in the number of new cases of Crohn's disease (CD) and ulcerative colitis (UC). There were 238 cases of CD; 129 of UC; and 39 of IBD unclassified. Comparing groups A and B, no differences were found in disease location at diagnosis or, for CD, in its behaviour. CONCLUSIONS: There has been a substantial and sustained increase in the incidence of childhood UC and CD in Ireland over a relatively short period of time. However, disease phenotype at diagnosis has not changed. At 2 years follow-up, CD appears to progress less frequently than in some neighbouring countries. These variations remain unexplained. Prospective longitudinal studies will help to elucidate further the epidemiology of childhood IBD.},

However, little has been published about the prevalence or characteristics of enthesitis in pediatric IBD. METHODS: We conducted a cross-sectional study of children and young adults ages 4-21 years with IBD. Subjects were recruited among those receiving routine care in a gastroenterology clinic. All subjects underwent a clinical examination of the entheses and joints, and completed a study questionnaire. RESULTS: We enrolled 43 subjects, who had a median age of 16 years and a median time from IBD diagnosis of 2.7 years. 32 subjects (74%) had Crohn disease, 10 subjects (23%) had indeterminate colitis, and 1 subject (2%) had ulcerative colitis. At least one tender enthesis was present in 21% of subjects and 12% had more than 2 tender entheses. The most commonly affected entheses were located at the inferior patella, the femoral greater trochanter, and the proximal humerus. The presence of enthesitis was associated with a higher intensity of recent musculoskeletal pain (p=0.03). CONCLUSIONS: Enthesitis is a prevalent extra-intestinal manifestation of pediatric IBD and is associated with increased musculoskeletal pain. Future studies should evaluate the functional and long-term impact of enthesitis on children with IBD.},

   abstract = {OBJECTIVES: The incidence of inflammatory bowel disease (IBD) is increasing. Dietary factors such as the spread of the "Western" diet, high in fat and protein but low in fruits and vegetables, may be associated with the increase. Although many studies have evaluated the association between diet and IBD risk, there has been no systematic review. METHODS: We performed a systematic review using guideline-recommended methodology to evaluate the association between pre-illness intake of nutrients (fats, carbohydrates, protein) and food groups (fruits, vegetables, meats) and the risk of subsequent IBD diagnosis. Eligible studies were identified via structured keyword searches in PubMed and Google Scholar and manual searches. RESULTS: Nineteen studies were included, encompassing 2,609 IBD patients (1,269 Crohn's disease (CD) and 1,340 ulcerative colitis (UC) patients) and over 4,000 controls. Studies reported a positive association between high intake of saturated fats, monounsaturated fatty acids, total polyunsaturated fatty acids (PUFAs), total omega-3 fatty acids, omega-6 fatty acids, mono- and disaccharides, and meat and increased subsequent CD risk. Studies reported a negative association between dietary fiber and fruits and subsequent CD risk. High intakes of total fats, total PUFAs, omega-6 fatty acids, and meat were associated with an increased risk of UC. High vegetable intake was associated with a decreased risk of UC. CONCLUSIONS: High dietary intakes of total fats, PUFAs, omega-6 fatty acids, and meat were associated with an increased risk of CD and UC. High fiber and fruit intakes were associated with decreased CD risk, and high vegetable intake was associated with decreased UC risk.},

   abstract = {OBJECTIVES: Certain diagnostic radiology procedures may expose patients with inflammatory bowel disease (IBD) to radiation and increase the risk for cancer. In the present study, we quantify the acute and cumulative effective dose of diagnostic radiation received by a cohort of pediatric patients with IBD. PATIENTS AND METHODS: Patients with IBD were identified from the medical records of a pediatric tertiary care center. The number and type of radiology procedures for each patient were determined from medical record review. Cumulative effective radiation dose was calculated using radiation effective dose estimates. RESULTS: One hundred five patients with IBD underwent radiation-associated abdominopelvic diagnostic radiology procedures with an average cumulative radiation exposure dose of 15 (18) [mean (SD)] mSv. Forty-two percent of the patients were exposed to acute radiation doses >/=10 mSv, and 6 patients (6%) were exposed to levels of cumulative radiation exposure >/=50 mSv, which has been associated with an increased risk of cancer development. Patients with Crohn disease, an increased number of hospital admissions, and a history of surgery were more likely to have been exposed to higher levels of cumulative radiation than their clinical counterparts. CONCLUSIONS: A majority of patients with IBD are exposed to radiation from typical diagnostic radiology procedures. Radiation-sparing procedures should be strongly considered in certain pediatric patients with IBD to reduce their risk for cancer given an already present increased lifetime malignancy potential.},

   abstract = {OBJECTIVES: For the choice of treatment in children with inflammatory bowel disease (IBD), it is important to make a distinction between Crohn disease (CD) and ulcerative colitis (UC). To look for pathognomonic features of CD, upper gastrointestinal tract (UGT) endoscopy has become part of the routine evaluation of children with suspected IBD; however, pathological changes can also be found in the UGT in patients with UC. The aims of the present study were to establish the role of UGT involvement in the diagnostic assessment of suspected IBD in children and to detect histopathological changes in the UGT mucosa, which can distinguish CD from non-CD (UC and non-IBD). METHODS: Biopsies (colon, ileum, duodenum, stomach, esophagus) from children suspected of having IBD who underwent endoscopy between 2003 and 2008 were reassessed by a blinded, expert pathologist. The histological findings of the UGT were compared with the diagnosis based on ileocolonic biopsies and the final diagnosis. RESULTS: In 11% of the children with CD, the diagnosis was based solely on the finding of granulomatous inflammation in the UGT. Focal cryptitis of the duodenum and focally enhanced gastritis were found significantly more frequently in children with CD compared with children with UC and non-IBD, with a specificity and positive predictive value of 99% and 93% and 87.1% and 78.6%, respectively. CONCLUSIONS: Histology on ileocolonic biopsies alone is insufficient for a correct diagnosis of CD or UC in children. UGT endoscopy should, therefore, be performed in the diagnostic assessment of all children suspected of having IBD.},

   abstract = {OBJECTIVE: Assess long-term effects of maintenance infliximab therapy in children with moderately-to-severely active Crohn's disease. RESEARCH DESIGN AND METHODS: One hundred twelve patients with a Pediatric Crohn's Disease Activity Index (PCDAI) score >30 received infliximab 5 mg/kg at weeks 0, 2, and 6 in the REACH study. Patients considered responders at week 10 were randomized to infliximab 5 mg/kg every 8 (q8w) or 12 (q12w) weeks. Patients who completed treatment through week 46, and who the investigator believed would benefit from continued treatment, could enter the open-label extension (OLE) and receive up to three additional years of infliximab. No hypothesis testing was performed. CLINICAL TRIAL REGISTRATION: www.clinicaltrials.gov, identifier: NCT0020767. RESULTS: Sixty children entered the OLE: 33, 12, and 15 patients were receiving infliximab 5 mg/kg q8w, 5 mg/kg q12w, and 10 mg/kg q8w, respectively, at extension entry. Patients receiving infliximab for up to 3 years during the OLE maintained clinical benefit, with approximately 80% of patients consistently having no to mild disease activity per the physician's global assessment and very good to fair health in the past 2 weeks per the patient and parent/guardian global assessments. Patients with >/=1-year delay in bone age at baseline trended toward improvement in height during the OLE. Respiratory system disorders, most commonly upper respiratory infections, were the most prevalent adverse events reported; six (10%) patients had serious infections. CONCLUSIONS: Among children with moderately-to-severely active Crohn's disease who received infliximab for 46 weeks in REACH and then for up to 3 additional years in the REACH OLE, infliximab was effective in maintaining clinical benefit and was generally well-tolerated.},

The incidence of postoperative intraabdominal septic complications (anastomotic leak, bowel fistula, intraabdominal abscess, peritonitis) is 5 - 30 %. Preoperative weight loss, prolonged refractory symptoms and penetrating disease behaviour are significant determinants of postoperative complication risk. Preoperative enteral nutrition, antibiotics, percutaneous abscess drainage and cessation of steroids might reduce the risk of surgery, however, more evidence is needed. The intake of immunosuppressive agents (mainly, azathioprine) can be continued perioperatively. The occurrence of postoperative intraabdominal septic complications is associated with an increased risk of surgical recurrence in patients with terminal ileitis, however, the long-term prognosis could be improved in the latter patients by secondary fecal diversion. There is no association between postoperative morbidity and long-term outcome in patients with Crohn's colitis.},

   abstract = {PURPOSE OF REVIEW: This review summarizes the recent literature about the roles of vitamins D and K in bone metabolism and immunity-mediated inflammatory processes in inflammatory bowel diseases (IBDs). RECENT FINDINGS: The levels of vitamins D and K are lower than normal in patients with IBD, especially in Crohn's disease. Although vitamins D and K are important for the maintenance of bone mineral density in non-IBD patients, an association between vitamins D or K and bone metabolism is not apparent in IBD patients. Recent studies showed that vitamins D and K are suggested to have immune-suppressive effects, both in animal models of colitis and human trials. In particular, vitamin D suppresses dendritic and T-cell functions by inhibiting the production of proinflammatory cytokines. Insufficiency of vitamin D is associated with the activated phenotype of IBD. SUMMARY: Vitamins D and K potentially contribute to the maintenance of bone health in IBD, but this effect may be diminished by other factors such as steroid use, reduced exposure to sunlight, and inflammatory cytokines. Vitamin D and possibly vitamin K are suggested to be involved in the suppression of immune-mediated inflammation and modulation of disease activity.},

   abstract = {Crohn's disease and ulcerative colitis represent distinct phenotypic forms of inflammatory bowel disease and continue to be a common cause of morbidity. The corticosteroids and the immunomodulatory drugs, which are the basis of treatment for the inflammatory bowel diseases, do not assure always satisfactory outcomes. Nutrition has been used in order to modify the inflammatory response of various chronic inflammatory diseases, including Crohn's disease and ulcerative colitis. In the pathogenesis of inflammatory bowel diseases, the intestinal microflora and the intestinal mucosal disorders play a crucial role. Also, the release of reactive oxygen species is a significant factor of initiation and preservation of the inflammatory reaction in these diseases. The advantages of the nutritional treatment derive from the sequestration of intraluminal agents which may promote the inflammatory bowel response or, alternatively, nutrition is able to modify the immune response, reducing the uncontrolled inflammatory reaction. Furthermore, nutrition can enhance the mucosal barrier function and consists a significant source of antioxidants. This review focuses on certain nutritional components that modulate the inflammatory response of the bowel and aims to present a rational thesis regarding the use of nutritional agents in the management of inflammatory bowel diseases.},

   abstract = {OBJECTIVE: The effect of preoperative total parenteral nutrition (TPN) on the rate of early (within 30 days) postoperative complications in patients with moderate to severe Crohn's disease (CD) was examined. MATERIAL AND METHODS: A series of 15 consecutive patients with CD (mean CD activity index score, 270) given preoperative TPN for 18-90 days (mean, 46 days) and undergoing bowel resection and primary anastomosis was compared with matching controls (105 patients) consecutively selected from all CD patients operated in Stockholm County during a preceding 20-year period without preoperative TPN. RESULTS: During the preoperative TPN, all the patients studied displayed clinical remission of CD as reflected in improvement in their general well-being, relief of abdominal pain, and abatement of fever and diarrhea. There was no significant early postoperative complication in the TPN-treated group, whereas there were 29 patients with early postoperative complications in the control group, which means a significantly higher rate of postoperative complications when preoperative TPN was not provided. During the preoperative TPN, some crucial variables increased such as the body weight, the serum concentrations of albumin and triiodothyronine reflecting improved nutritional state, whereas the serum concentration of haptoglobin and the white cell count decreased reflecting decreased inflammatory activity. CONCLUSIONS: This study shows that preoperative TPN for at least 18 days may be recommended to be given to patients with moderate to severe CD until clinical remission is achieved in order to minimize the risk of early postoperative complications.},

   abstract = {BACKGROUND: The aim was to evaluate the incidence, treatment, surgery rate, and anthropometry at diagnosis of children with inflammatory bowel disease (IBD). METHODS: Patients diagnosed between January 1, 2007 to December 31, 2009 in Eastern Denmark, Funen, and Aarhus were included from a background population of 668,056 children <15 years of age. For evaluation of incidence, treatment, and surgery rate, a subcohort from Eastern Denmark was extracted for comparison with a previously published population-based cohort from the same geographical area (1998-2006). RESULTS: In all, 130 children with IBD: 65 with Crohn's disease (CD), 62 with ulcerative colitis (UC), and three with IBD unclassified (IBDU) were included. The mean incidence rates per 10(6) in 2007-2009 were: IBD: 6.4 (95% confidence interval [CI]: 5.4-7.7), CD: 3.2 (2.5-4.1), UC: 3.1 (2.4-4.0) and IBDU: 0.2 (0.05-0.5). Comparing the two cohorts from Eastern Denmark we found higher incidence rates for IBD (5.0 and 7.2 in 1998-2000 and 2007-2009, respectively, P = 0.02) and CD (2.3 versus 3.3, P = 0.04). Furthermore, we found a significant decrease in surgery rates (15.8/100 person-years versus 4.2, P = 0.02) and an increase in the rate of initiating immunomodulators (IM) within the first year (29.0/100 person-years versus 69.2, P < 0.001). IM use was associated with a trend towards a decreased surgery risk (relative risk [RR] 0.38; 0.15-1.0). Children with CD had poor nutritional status at diagnosis compared with the general pediatric population. CONCLUSIONS: Over the past 12 years we found an increase in the incidence of IBD in children, an increasing use of IM, and decreasing 1-year surgery rates. CD patients had poor nutritional status.},

   abstract = {The gastrointestinal epithelium transports solutes and water between lumen and blood and at the same time forms a barrier between these compartments. This highly selective and regulated barrier permits ions, water, and nutrients to be absorbed, but normally restricts the passage of harmful molecules, bacteria, viruses and other pathogens. During inflammation, the intestinal barrier can be disrupted, indicated by a decrease in transcellular electrical resistance and an increase in paracellular permeability for tracers of different size. Such inflammatory processes are accompanied by increased oxidative stress, which in turn can impair the epithelial barrier. In this review, we discuss the role of inflammatory oxidative stress on barrier function with special attention on the epithelial tight junctions. Diseases discussed causing barrier changes include the inflammatory bowel diseases Crohn's disease, ulcerative colitis, and microscopic colitis, the autoimmune disorder celiac disease, and gastrointestinal infections. In addition, the main cytokines responsible for these effects and their role during oxidative stress and intestinal inflammation will be discussed, as well as therapeutic approaches and their mode of action.},

   abstract = {INTRODUCTION: Mounting evidence suggests an important role for the intestinal microbiota in the chronic mucosal inflammation that occurs in inflammatory bowel disease (IBD), and novel molecular approaches have further identified a dysbiosis in these patients. Several mechanisms of action of probiotic products that may interfere with possible aetiological factors in IBD have been postulated. OBJECTIVE: Our objective was to discuss the rationale for probiotics in IBD and to systematically review clinical intervention studies with probiotics in the management of IBD in adults. METHODS: A systematic search was performed in PubMed up to 1 October 2011, using defined keywords. Only full-text papers in the English language addressing clinical outcomes in adult patients were included. The 41 eligible studies were categorized on disease type (ulcerative colitis [UC] with/without an ileo-anal pouch and Crohn's disease [CD]) and disease activity. Pooled odds ratios were only calculated per probiotic for a specific patient group when more than one randomized controlled trial was available. RESULTS: Well designed randomized controlled trials supporting the application of probiotics in the management of IBD are still limited. Meta-analyses could only be performed for a limited number of studies revealing overall risk ratios of 2.70 (95% CI 0.47, 15.33) for inducing remission in active UC with Bifido-fermented milk versus placebo or no additive treatment (n = 2); 1.88 (95% CI 0.96, 3.67) for inducing remission in active UC with VSL#3 versus placebo (n = 2); 1.08 (95% CI 0.86, 1.37) for preventing relapses in inactive UC with Escherichia coli Nissle 1917 versus standard treatment (n = 3); 0.17 (95% CI 0.09, 0.33) for preventing relapses in inactive UC/ileo-anal pouch anastomosis (IPAA) patients with VSL#3 versus placebo; 1.21 (95% CI 0.57, 2.57) for preventing endoscopic recurrences in inactive CD with Lactobacillus rhamnosus GG versus placebo (n = 2); and 0.93 (95% CI 0.63, 1.38) for preventing endoscopic recurrences in inactive CD with Lactobacillus johnsonii versus placebo (n = 2). CONCLUSION: Further well designed studies based on intention-to-treat analyses by several independent research groups are still warranted to support the promising results for E. coli Nissle in inactive UC and the multispecies product VSL#3 in active UC and inactive pouch patients. So far, no evidence is available to support the use of probiotics in CD. Future studies should focus on specific disease subtypes and disease location. Further insight into the aetiology of IBD and the mechanisms of probiotic strains will aid in selecting probiotic strains for specific disease entities and disease locations.},

   abstract = {BACKGROUND AND AIMS: The U.S. population is aging and the burden of geriatric inflammatory bowel disease (IBD) patients has increased. Systematic data describing phenotypic presentation, treatment regimens, outcomes and comorbidities in elderly IBD patients is limited. We performed a retrospective observational study of IBD patients age >/=65 followed in a 20-hospital system to determine patterns of phenotypic presentation, treatment, polypharmacy, nutritional status and comorbidity. METHODS: Data were extracted from electronic medical record based on ICD-9 coding/indexed terms on Crohn's disease (CD) and ulcerative colitis (UC) patients. RESULTS: A total of 393 geriatric IBD patients were identified (49.1% males; 50.9% females; 61.8% UC; 38.2% CD; 73.4 +/- 6.6 years old). Younger age at diagnosis of CD (</=64) was associated with greater prevalence of small bowel surgeries (63.6%) compared with those diagnosed after age >/=65 (20.9%) (p < 0.005). Fistulizing/penetrating disease was frequent in patients diagnosed with CD at a younger age (43.6% compared to 7%) (p < 0.005). IBD maintenance treatment included: 44% 5-ASA agents; 31.6% maintenance prednisone (defined as >/=6 months treatment duration); 4.8% steroid suppositories; 5.6% 6MP/azathioprine; 1.3% methotrexate; 1.3% adalimumab; 1.3% infliximab; 9.4% loperamide/diphenoxylate/atropine; 0.5% had no IBD medications. Longer duration of CD disease correlated with vitamin B12, vitamin D and iron deficiency. CONCLUSION: Geriatric patients diagnosed with CD earlier in life had greater small bowel involvement compared with new onset geriatric CD. There is low utilization of immunomodulator and biologic agents in geriatric IBD patients. Duration of CD correlates with nutrient deficiency. Prospective studies are warranted in this respect.},

   abstract = {Carotenoid consumption has been linked to a number of beneficial health effects, including the reduction of chronic diseases such as cancer and cardiovascular complications. However, no data are available on their action on the intestinal epithelium, being exposed to the highest concentrations of carotenoids in the human body, and where they could act preventively on intestinal inflammatory diseases such as Crohn's disease and ulcerative colitis. The objective of the present study was to investigate whether lycopene and beta-carotene in micelles (M), at concentrations that could be reached via the diet (10-25 mug/ml) could aid in the reduction of TNF-alpha plus IL-1beta-induced inflammation of Caco-2 human epithelial cells. The impact on biomarkers of inflammation, including IL-8, NO and cyclo-oxygenase-2 (through PGE-2alpha), and the NF-kappaB and mitogen-activated protein kinase (MAPK) pathways of intracellular signalling cascades were evaluated compared with controls (empty M). Furthermore, proteomic analyses were conducted from total cellular protein extracts. The results revealed that isolated carotenoids had no statistical significant anti-inflammatory effect on the biomarkers observed, or on the regulation of NF-kappaB and MAPK. Nevertheless, analyses of the proteome suggested that fifteen proteins were significantly (P < 0.05, expression ratio >1.3) differentially regulated following beta-carotene exposure, participating mostly in metabolic activities including antioxidant mechanisms, such as glutathione S-transferase A1. Only one protein was differentially regulated by lycopene (profilin-1). To our knowledge, this is the first attempt to investigate pathways involved in the action of carotenoids on the intestinal epithelium.},

   abstract = {The gut microbiota, the intestinal mucosa and the host immune system are among the large biological networks involved in the development of inflammatory bowel disease (IBD), which includes Crohn disease (CD) and ulcerative colitis (UC). Host genetics and environmental factors can significantly modulate the interactive relationships among these biological systems and influence predilection toward IBD. High monozygotic twin discordance rates and the rapid rise in the prevalence of IBD indicate that environmental influences may be as important or even more important in their pathogenesis than genetic susceptibility. However, the nature and timing of environmental factors critical for inducing IBD remain largely unknown. The molecular mechanisms and the key biological component(s) that may be affected by such factors are also in question. Epigenetic changes, such as DNA methylation (the methylation of cytosines followed by a guanine in CpG dinucleotides) can be modified by environmental influences during finite developmental periods and have been implicated in the pathogenesis of IBD. Mucosal DNA methylation can also react to changes in the commensal microbiota, underscoring the intercalating relationships among the large biological systems involved in gastrointestinal disorders. Therefore, transient environmental influences during specific periods of development may induce critical change(s) in an isolated or concomitant fashion within the intestinal biomic networks and lead to increased susceptibility to IBD. The present review focuses on the emerging paradigm shift considering IBD to originate from critical environmental effects during pre- and postnatal development.},

   abstract = {OBJECTIVES: In patients with inflammatory bowel diseases (IBDs), the presence of noncaseating mucosal granuloma is sufficient for diagnosing Crohn disease (CD) and may represent a specific immune response or microbial-host interaction. The cause of granulomas in CD is unknown and their association with the intestinal microbiota has not been addressed with high-throughput methodologies. METHODS: The mucosal microbiota from 3 different pediatric centers was studied with 454 pyrosequencing of the bacterial 16S rRNA gene and the fungal small subunit (SSU) ribosomal region in transverse colonic biopsy specimens from 26 controls and 15 treatment-naive pediatric CD cases. Mycobacterium avium subspecies paratuberculosis (MAP) was tested with real-time polymerase chain reaction. The correlation of granulomatous inflammation with C-reactive protein was expanded to 86 treatment-naive CD cases. RESULTS: The CD microbiota separated from controls by distance-based redundancy analysis (P = 0.035). Mucosal granulomata found in any portion of the intestinal tract associated with an augmented colonic bacterial microbiota divergence (P = 0.013). The granuloma-based microbiota separation persisted even when research center bias was eliminated (P = 0.04). Decreased Roseburia and Ruminococcus in granulomatous CD were important in this separation; however, principal coordinates analysis did not reveal partitioning of the groups. CRP levels >1 mg/dL predicted the presence of mucosal granulomata (odds ratio 28 [6-134.32]; 73% sensitivity, 91% specificity). CONCLUSIONS: Granulomatous CD associates with microbiota separation and C-reactive protein elevation in treatment-naive children; however, overall dysbiosis in pediatric CD appears rather limited. Geographical/center bias should be accounted for in future multicenter microbiota studies.},

The aim of this study was to determine if serum 25-hydroxy-vitamin D [25(OH)D] was associated with inflammatory cytokines, IL-10, and TNF-alpha levels in patients with inactive CD. METHODS: This was a prospective study of 75 adults with quiescent CD. Serum 25(OH)D was measured by radioimmunoassay and serum IL-10 and TNF-alpha by ELISA. Disease activity was assessed by the Crohn's disease activity index (CDAI) and C-reactive protein (CRP). RESULTS: IL-10 levels were significantly lower in patients with vitamin D insufficiency compared with the vitamin D replete group (mean and SE 2.48 +/- 0.51 v 6.77 +/- 2.49 pg/mL, p < 0.001). There were, however, no differences in serum TNF-alpha or CRP levels based on vitamin D status. The use of a vitamin D supplement at a low dose (200 IU) did not significantly influence IL-10 levels. CONCLUSION: Circulating levels of IL-10, but not TNF-alpha, were significantly lower in CD patients with inadequate serum 25(OH)D. This suggests that poor vitamin D status may be linked to reduced anti-inflammatory capacity in this group.},

   abstract = {OBJECTIVES: Methotrexate (MTX) is an effective treatment for Crohn disease (CD); however, its application may be limited by the occurrence of nausea. We assessed whether a short course of ondansetron minimized this adverse event. PATIENTS AND METHODS: A retrospective case-control study of patients with CD who received MTX at the Children's Hospital of Eastern Ontario between 2001 and 2009 was conducted. RESULTS: Sixty-four patients received MTX during this time period. The mean age of diagnosis was 12.0 +/- 3.0 years (+/- standard deviation), and the mean age when MTX was initiated was 13.6 +/- 2.6 years. Those receiving only 1 or 2 doses of MTX (N = 4) and stopped for reasons other than development of nausea were not included in the analysis. Fifty patients received ondansetron premedication using a 4- to 8-week tapering schedule with MTX, and only 1 patient (2.0%) developed nausea within the first 3 months of MTX. In contrast, 6 of 10 patients (60.0%, P < 0.001) not premedicated with ondansetron reported nausea following MTX within 3 months. Four of these 6 patients subsequently received ondansetron and had no further complaints. Following ondansetron discontinuation, 5 of 50 (10%) patients developed nausea with subsequent MTX injections, but responded to reinstitution of ondansetron. Some children developed anticipatory nausea (6/60, 10%) and 3 experienced nausea relief after initiating premedication with ondansetron. CONCLUSIONS: Nausea following MTX is a common complaint in patients with CD. For most, this adverse effect may be prevented through the use of a short-course ondansetron as premedication. Ondansetron to treat MTX-induced nausea also can be successfully used but a proactive preventive strategy can be achieved.},

   abstract = {BACKGROUND: Recently published data indicate that the inflammation in Crohn's disease (CD) may be accompanied by elevated levels of matrix metalloproteinases. AIMS: The goals of the present study were the estimation of MMP-3 and -9 concentrations in sera of children with Crohn's disease, the examination of correlation between the concentrations of MMP-3 and -9 and clinical activity of the disease in the relation to the control group and the evaluation of the utility of MMP-3 and -9 concentration measurements as markers of disease activity. METHODS: Serum concentrations of MMP-3 and -9 were estimated in 82 children (45 CD patients divided into severe, moderate and mild subgroups; 37 controls) and correlated with disease activity estimated by the Pediatric Crohn's Disease Activity Index (PCDAI), CRP, seromucoid and ESR. RESULTS: Mean MMP-3 concentrations were: 2.49 ng/ml (95% CI: 1.76-3.52) for mild, 16.44 ng/ml (95% CI: 10.34-26.15) for moderate, 5.25 ng/ml (95% CI: 2.73-10.11) for severe CD and 1.95 ng/ml (95% CI: 1.53-2.48) for the control group (differences between all three groups were statistically significant; P < 0.001). Median MMP-9 concentrations were: 2.14 ng/ml (95% CI: 0-8.9) for mild, 14.21 ng/ml (95% CI: 4.53-21.48) for moderate, 42.2 ng/ml (95% CI: 5.74-61.27) for severe CD and 1.3 ng/ml (95% CI: 0.7-2.18) for the control group. MMP-9 concentrations in moderate and severe CD differed from the concentrations in mild CD (P = 0.002) and control group (P = 0.0001). MMP-3 concentration significantly correlated with MMP-9, PCDAI and ESR, while MMP-9 concentration significantly positively correlated with MMP-3, PCDAI, and CRP. Diagnostic utilities of the tests were: MMP-3 accuracy 75%, positive likelihood ratio (LR+) = 4.11 and negative likelihood ratio (LR-) = 0.51, sensitivity 56%, specificity 87%, Youden index 0.43; for MMP-9, accuracy 73%, LR+ = 5.14 and LR- = 0.50, sensitivity 56%, specificity 89%, Youden index 0.45; and for CRP, accuracy 74%, LR+ = 8.56 and LR- = 0.54, sensitivity 49%, specificity 94%, Youden index 0.43. CONCLUSIONS: MMP-9 serum concentration increasing along with the activity of the disease, exhibiting high specificity and correlating well with the indices of inflammation might be of better usefulness in the prediction of CD activity status in children than MMP-3.},

The intraclass correlation coefficient analysis reflected good agreement (intraclass correlation coefficient 0.97 [95% confidence interval 0.95-0.98]) but agreement was better in lower values, where dilutions were not required. Using a cutoff of 100 mug/g for normal values, the percentage agreement between the 2 tests was 87%. The optimal cutoff values to guide clinical decisions in the therapy of inflammatory bowel disease have yet to be determined.},

   abstract = {BACKGROUND: Significance of pancreatic autoantibodies determined by using exocrine pancreas (PAB) and antibodies against recombinant pancreas antigen (rPAB), as well as the importance of autoantibodies against goblet cells (GAB), is not known in pediatric patients with inflammatory bowel disease (IBD). Our aim was to determine the complex analysis of PAB, rPAB, GAB, antibodies against Saccharomyces cerevisiae, and perinuclear components of neutrophils in pediatric patients with IBD. Moreover, association with NOD2/CARD15 and disease phenotype was determined. METHODS: A total of 152 pediatric patients (median age 13.9 years) with IBD (103 patients with Crohn disease [CD] and 49 patients with ulcerative colitis [UC]) and 104 controls were included. Serum autoantibodies were determined by indirect immunofluorescence assay. NOD2/CARD15 variants were tested by polymerase chain reaction/restriction fragment length polymorphism. RESULTS: The presence of PAB and rPAB was significantly higher in CD (34% and 35.9%) and in UC (20.4% and 24.5%) compared with pediatric control cohort (0% and 0%, P<0.0001). In addition, GAB positivity was significantly increased in patients with UC in comparison with CD and controls, respectively (UC, 12.2%; CD, 1.9%; controls, 1.9%; P=0.02). Specificity of PAB and rPAB was 100%; however, sensitivity was low. The combination of PAB and/or antibodies against Saccharomyces cerevisiae/perinuclear components of neutrophils improved the sensitivity of serological markers in CD (87.4%) and in UC (79.6%); specificities were 89.3% and 93.2%, respectively. Pancreatic autoantibodies (PAB, rPAB) and GAB were not related to clinical presentation, medical therapy, or need for surgery in CD or in UC. CONCLUSIONS: Pancreatic autoantibodies and GAB were specific for IBD, but the sensitivity was limited as well because there was lack of correlation with clinical phenotype. Combinations of these antibodies have shown increased sensitivity; therefore, it may be recommended in the diagnostic procedure of IBD.},

   abstract = {BACKGROUND: Colon specific drug delivery can significantly improve the efficacy of local treatments of inflammatory bowel diseases. Film coatings containing the starch derivative Nutriose have recently been reported to minimize 5-ASA release in media simulating the upper gastro intestinal tract (GIT), while releasing the drug in a time-controlled manner upon contact with feces from Crohn's Disease and Ulcerative Colitis patients. It was the aim of this study to prepare Nutriose-containing matrix pellets and mini tablets in order to avoid a film coating step. METHODS: Highly dosed matrix pellets were prepared by extrusion-spheronization, highly dosed mini tablets by compression. Various types of lipids were added and drug release measured in 0.1 N HCl and phosphate buffer pH 6.8, optionally containing pepsin and pancreatin. RESULTS: The type of added lipid and the preparation technique, in particular the curing conditions, significantly affected the resulting drug release kinetics. Glyceryl palmitostearate containing pellets and mini tablets showed the most promising results upon appropriate curing, minimizing premature drug release in media simulating the upper GIT. CONCLUSION: The proposed novel multiparticulates do not require a film coating step and show an interesting potential for site-specific drug delivery to the colon of inflammatory bowel disease patients.},

   abstract = {INTRODUCTION: Definitive management for medically refractory ileocecal Crohn's disease is resection with primary anastomosis. Laparoscopic resection has been demonstrated to be effective in adults. There is a relative paucity of data in the pediatric population. We therefore audited our experience with laparoscopic ileocecectomy in patients with medically refractory ileocecal Crohn's disease to determine its efficacy. METHODS: We conducted a retrospective review of all pediatric patients who underwent laparoscopic ileocecal resection for medically refractory Crohn's disease at a single institution from 2000 to 2009. RESULTS: Thirty patients aged 10-18 years (mean: 15.3 years) with a mean weight of 50 kg (standard deviation: +/- 15.5 kg) underwent laparoscopic ileocecectomy for Crohn's disease. Five of these were performed using a single-incision laparoscopic approach. The indications for surgery were obstruction/stricture (21), pain (10), abscess (3), fistula (3), perforation (2), and bleeding (1). Some patient's had multiple indications. There were a total of five abscesses encountered at operation. Eight patients were on total parenteral nutrition at the time of resection. Twenty-five patients (83.3%) were being treated with steroids at operation. The anastomosis was stapled in 26 patients and hand-sewn in 4. Two patients developed a postoperative abscess, and both of them were taking 20 mg of prednisone daily. One patient developed a small bowel obstruction due to a second Crohn's stricture that manifested itself after the more severe downstream obstruction was relieved with ileocecectomy. Of the 5 patients who underwent a single-incision laparoscopic operation, 3 underwent for obstruction/stricture and 2 for perforation. There were no intraoperative or postoperative complications. The patients were followed up for a maximum of 80.7 months (average: 14.7 months; median: 9.7 months). There were no anastomotic leaks or wound infections. DISCUSSION: This series demonstrates that laparoscopic ileocecectomy, both single-incision laparoscopic approach and standard laparoscopy, is safe and effective in the setting of medically refractory Crohn's disease in pediatric patients.},

   abstract = {Nutritional factors, as sources of luminal antigens, have been thought to be important factors in the immunopathogenesis of numerous gastrointestinal diseases. In some diseases, the role of the nutritional component is causal in the susceptible host. Such diseases include celiac disease, a common heritable chronic inflammatory condition of the small intestine induced by dietary wheat, rye and barley, in susceptible individuals. Specific HLA-DQ2 and HLA-DQ8 risk alleles are necessary, but not sufficient, for disease development. The well-defined role of HLA-DQ heterodimers encoded by these alleles is to present cereal peptides to CD4+ T cells, activating an inflammatory immune response in the intestine. Genome-wide association studies have been performed which identified the IL2-IL21 risk locus and other genes with immune functions and key roles in thymic T-cell selection. Another example for this group is Wilson's disease, an autosomal recessive disorder of copper metabolism caused by mutation of the ATP7B gene, resulting in a defect of biliary copper excretion and toxic accumulation in the body, especially in the liver, brain and cornea, resulting in hepatic and/or neurological symptoms. In other diseases, however, the association is less well established. In such endeavor, epidemiological observations may become a valuable part of the overall investigations aimed at identifying dietary factors, which are involved in the initiation and perpetuation of the specific disease. As an example, relationships between nutrition and colorectal cancer have been hypothesized early on (e.g. folate, calcium, vitamin D, red meat). Similarly, intake of certain diet constituents like fat, refined sugar, fruits, vegetables and fiber was reported to be associated with the expression of inflammatory bowel diseases. In addition, in children with active Crohn's disease, enteral nutrition was found to be equally effective as corticosteroids in induction of remission, with mucosal healing induced by downregulation of mucosal pro-inflammatory cytokine profiles in both the ileum and the colon after enteral nutrition. However, the particular effect of the consumption of each type of food remains questionable in most cases, at least in part because of insufficient data and serious methodological limitations (e.g. recall bias, heterogeneity between collected data, lack of correction for covariates, difficulties in double blinding).},

   abstract = {BACKGROUND: While the short-term benefits of exclusive enteral nutrition (EEN) for induction of remission in children with Crohn's disease (CD) are well documented, the longer-term outcomes are less clear. AIM: This retrospective study aimed to ascertain the outcomes for up to 24 months following EEN in a group of children with CD. METHODS: Children treated with EEN as initial therapy for newly diagnosed CD over a 5-year period were identified. Details of disease activity, growth, and drug requirements over the period of follow-up were noted. Outcomes in children managed with EEN were compared to a group of children initially treated with corticosteroids. RESULTS: Over this time period, 31 children were treated with EEN and 26 with corticosteroids. Twenty-six (84 %) of the 31 children treated with EEN entered remission. Children treated with EEN exhibited lower pediatric Crohn's disease activity index (PCDAI) scores at 6 months (p = 0.02) and received lower cumulative doses of steroids over the study period (p < 0.0001) than the group treated with corticosteroids. Height increments over 24 months were greater in the EEN group (p = 0.01). Although the median times to relapse were the same, the EEN group had a lower incidence of relapse in each time interval and survival curve analysis showed lower risk of relapse (p = 0.008). CONCLUSIONS: EEN lead to multiple benefits beyond the initial period of inducing remission for these children, with positive outcomes over 2 years from diagnosis. Of particular clinical relevance to growing children was the reduced exposure to corticosteroids.},

PATIENTS AND METHODS: DNA was extracted from formalin-fixed paraffin-embedded colonic and ileal biopsies from patients with CD (n = 22) or UC (n = 20), and from controls without IBD (n = 21). IS900 nested polymerase chain reaction was performed in triplicate to determine the presence of MAP-specific DNA. RESULTS: In mucosal biopsies from terminal ileum, IS900 amplicons were detected in 1 of 19 (5.2%) control subjects, 1 of 20 (5%) patients with UC, and 7 of 20 (35%) patients with CD (P < 0.05 vs controls, odds ratio 9.6). In colonic biopsies, IS900 amplicons were detected in 0 of 19 control subjects, 1 of 19 (5.2%) patients with UC, and 5 of 19 (26.3%) patients with CD (P < 0.05 vs controls, odds ratio 14.8). In patients with CD, there was no correlation between disease activity and the presence of IS900. CONCLUSIONS: Our technique enabled sensitive and specific detection of MAP DNA in archival endoscopic biopsy specimens. Although MAP-specific DNA can be detected in about 5% of intestinal biopsies from children with UC or controls without IBD, its presence was significantly associated with pediatric granulomatous CD, being particularly prevalent in ileal tissue. This easily defined clinical subset of patients may be useful for additional studies to determine the role of MAP in CD.},

METHODS: We performed a cross-sectional analysis of children with Crohn disease (CD) and ulcerative colitis (UC) using data from the ImproveCareNow Network collected between May 2007 and May 2010. Clinical remission, disease severity, body mass index (BMI) z scores, normal height velocity, and medication use were analyzed by sex and age. RESULTS: One thousand four hundred nine patients were included (993 had CD and 416 had UC). No significant sex differences were found in disease severity, BMI, height velocity, or use of medications. Further analysis of combination therapy with infliximab + 6-mercaptopurine/azathioprine and infliximab + methotrexate also did not reveal any differences. No sex differences were found after mediation use was stratified by age (those younger than 13 years and those 13 years old or older). CONCLUSIONS: In this sample of CD and UC pediatric patients, no significant sex differences were found in disease severity, BMI, height velocity, or medication use. Our data do not support the use of sex as a major factor in patient risk stratification for children with IBD. In addition, despite concerns for sex-specific complications of some medications, our analysis did not suggest any sex differences in medication use.},

   abstract = {The objective of this article is to report improvement of nutritional status by protein supplements in the patient with protein-losing enteropathy. The patient was a female whose age was 25 and underwent medical treatment of Crohn's disease, an inflammatory bowl disease, after diagnosis of cryptogenic multifocal ulcerous enteritis. The weight was 33.3 kg (68% of IBW) in the severe underweight and suffered from ascites and subcutaneous edema with hypoalbuminemia (1.3 g/dL) at the time of hospitalization. The patient consumed food restrictively due to abdominal discomfort. Despite various attempts of oral feeding, the levels of calorie and protein intake fell into 40-50% of the required amount, which was 800-900 kcal/d (24-27 kcal/kg/d) for calorie and 34 g/d (1 g/kg/d) for protein. It was planned to supplement the patient with caloric supplementation (40-50 kcal/kg) and protein supplementation (2.5 g/kg) to increase body weight and improve hypoproteinemia. It was also planned to increase the level of protein intake slowly to target 55 g/d in about 2 weeks starting from 10 g/d and monitored kidney load with high protein supplementation. The weight loss was 1.0 kg when the patient was discharged from the hospital (hospitalization periods of 4 weeks), however, serum albumin was improved from 1.3 g/dL to 2.5 g/dL and there was no abdominal discomfort. She kept supplement of protein at 55 g/d for 5 months after the discharge from the hospital and kept it at 35 g/d for about 2 months and then 25 g/d. The body weight increased gradually from 32.3 kg (65% of IBW) to 44.0 kg (89% of IBW) by 36% for the period of F/u and serum albumin was kept above 2.8 g/dL without intravenous injection of albumin. The performance status was improved from 4 points of 'very tired' to 2 points of 'a little tired' out of 5-point scale measurement and the use of diuretic stopped from the time of 4th month after the discharge from the hospital owing to improvement in edema and ascites. During this period, the results of blood test such as BUN, Cr, and electrolytes were within the normal range. In conclusion, hypoproteinemia and weight loss were improved by increasing protein intake through utilization of protein supplements in protein-losing enteropathy.},

   abstract = {PURPOSE: To investigate the efficacy of early infliximab use and to follow the progress of pediatric cases of Crohn's disease for 3 years. METHODS: We reviewed the medical records of 28 pediatric patients who had been treated with infliximab for Crohn's disease. Eighteen patients (the 'top-down' group) received infliximab and azathioprine for induction and maintenance therapy for the first year, and then were treated with azathioprine for 2 additional years. Ten patients who were refractory to conventional therapy were categorized in the 'step-up' group. All patients were followed for at least 36 months. Treatment efficacy was assessed by the relapse rate using the pediatric Crohn's disease activity index (PCDAI) score in each group at 12, 24, and 36 months. Blood samples were available from 10 patients, and were used to assess antibody to infliximab (ATI). RESULTS: The relapse rate in 'top-down' group was lower than that in 'step-up' group at 1, 2, and 3 years. But, just the relapse rate at the 2 years was significantly different. At 3 years, the relapse rate according to different characteristic variables (sex, age at diagnosis, involvement, PCDAI at diagnosis) was not significantly different. Only one patient treated with infliximab had an adverse event, consisting of dyspnea and tachycardia. ATI was not detected in the blood samples from 10 patients. CONCLUSION: Early induction with infliximab at diagnosis ('top-down' therapy) is effective for reducing the relapse rate compared to conventional therapies in pediatric Crohn's disease possibly for up to 3 years.},

   abstract = {Alum (AlK(SO(4))(2)) is an adjuvant commonly utilized in vaccines, and is a ubiquitous element used extensively in contemporary life. Food, air, water, waste, the earth's surface, and pharmaceuticals all represent pathways of aluminum (Al) exposure. Crohn's disease (CD) is a chronic relapsing intestinal inflammation in genetically susceptible individuals and is caused by yet unidentified environmental factors. Al is a potential factor for the induction of inflammation in CD, and its immune activities share many characteristics with the immune pathology of CD: many luminal bacterial or dietary compounds can be adsorbed to the metal surface and induce Th1 profile cytokines, shared cytokines/chemokines, co-stimulatory molecules, and intracellular pathways and stress-related molecular expression enhancement, affecting intestinal macrobiota, trans-mural granuloma formation, and colitis induction in an animal CD model. The inflammasome plays a central role in Al mode of action and in CD pathophysiology. It is suggested that Al adjuvant activity can fit between the aberrations of innate and adaptive immune responses occurring in CD. The CD mucosa is confronted with numerous inappropriate bacterial components adsorbed on the Al compound surface, constituting a pro-inflammatory supra-adjuvant. Al fits the diagnostic criteria of the newly described autoimmune/inflammatory syndrome induced by adjuvants. If a cause and effect relationship can be established, the consequences will greatly impact public health and CD prevention and management.},

   abstract = {BACKGROUND: Crohn's disease (CD) is characterized by an aberrant response to the gut microbiota. We aimed to assess whether azithromycin based therapy is effective in inducing remission in CD, due to its effect in inducing apoptosis and efficacy against biofilms and intracellular bacteria. METHODS: Retrospective analysis of patients treated with an 8 week course of combined azithromycin and metronidazole. Patients were included if they had active CD defined as pediatric CD activity index (PCDAI) >/= 10, and were not receiving any other medication for inducing remission in active disease. PCDAI score and CRP were recorded at baseline and 8 weeks thereafter. RESULTS: Thirty two patients (mean age 13.1 +/- 3.9, mean duration of disease 0.65 years) were included, of whom 21 (66%) entered clinical remission (PCDAI<10) after 8 weeks of treatment. The mean age at treatment and duration of disease did not differ between patients entering remission and those unresponsive to therapy. CRP, normalized in 54% of patients with elevated CRP at baseline. Factors associated with lack of response were a more severe disease (reflected by higher PCDAI and CRP values at baseline), presence of arthritis and extensive disease (ileocolonic, or prominent upper intestinal disease). CONCLUSIONS: An 8 week course of azithromycin and metronidazole therapy may be effective in inducing clinical remission in mild-moderate luminal CD in children and young adults.},

   abstract = {The incidence of pediatric inflammatory bowel disease (IBD) continues to rise in most countries. Approximately 20-25% of IBD patients present before the age of 20, and their management is associated with many unique challenges. These challenges stem both from the inherent differences between children and adults, and from the differences in the nature and course of the disease. Children with IBD are more likely than adults to present with extensive disease both in Crohn's disease (CD) and ulcerative colitis (UC). Diagnosis requires a high index of suspicion, as children may present with less typical signs such as poor growth and delayed puberty. In the very young patients with inflammatory bowel disease, the pediatric clinician must consider a broader range of immunological and allergic disorders. Optimal management requires recognition of pediatric patterns of presentation, efficacy and adverse-effect profiles, and understanding monitoring aspects unique to pediatrics. These aspects include pediatric disease-related psychological issues, adherence to therapy and transition to adult care. Inadequate attention to growth, puberty or bone health in childhood can result in long-term consequences, such as impaired adult height and increased risk of fractures. Management of pediatric IBD and prevention of adverse long-term consequences relies on a variety of therapies well-known to the adult practitioner, along with therapies that are not widespread in adults, most notably exclusive enteral nutrition (EEN). The latter is as effective as corticosteroids in achieving clinical remission in children, while achieving better results than corticosteroids with regard to mucosal healing and growth. This review discusses the broad variety of issues that form the basis for management of pediatric IBD.},

Correlations between polymorphisms of the TGF-beta1 gene and clinical parameters of inflammatory bowel disease (IBD) were reported previously in adults. Here, we tested whether such correlations occur in pediatric patients suffering from IBD. One hundred and four pediatric IBD patients were involved in this study. Among them, 36 were diagnosed with Crohn's Disease (CD) and 68 were diagnosed with ulcerative colitis (UC). The control group consisted of 103 children, in which IBD was excluded. TGF-beta1 levels were determined in plasma and intestinal mucosa samples. The presence of the TGF beta1 protein and the amount of TGF beta1 mRNA were estimated in intestinal mucosa by immunohistochemistry and reverse transcription Real-Time PCR, respectively. Four common polymorphisms of the TGF-beta1 gene were investigated: -800G/A, -509C/T, 869T/C and 915G/C. No significant correlation between TGF-beta1 genotypes and (i) TGF-beta1 levels in plasma and tissue samples, (ii) TGF-beta1 gene expression efficiency in intestinal mucosa, (iii) IBD clinical parameters and (iv) inflammatory activity could be detected in children suffering from IBD. We conclude that, contrary to previous suggestions, the four common polymorphisms of the TGF-beta1 gene do not influence the susceptibility to or clinical parameters of IBD in the tested population of children.},

   abstract = {PURPOSE: Transforming growth factor beta1 (TGF-beta1) plays a role in cell proliferation and differentiation, and it can modulate immune response. In this work, we asked whether levels of either TGF-beta1 or mRNA of the corresponding gene in plasma or tissue can be useful in diagnosing and/or monitoring of the clinical course of inflammatory bowel diseases (IBD). METHODS: The study group consisted of 104 pediatric patients with IBD: 36 with Crohn's disease (CD) and 68 with ulcerative colitis (UC); 42 children represented the control group. TGF-beta1 levels in plasma and intestinal mucosa were estimated by ELISA and immunohistochemistry (IHC), respectively. Levels of TGF-beta1 mRNA were determined by reverse transcription and real-time PCR. RESULTS: In patients with IBD, and in subgroups with CD and UC, no significant differences in the TGF-beta1 level in plasma and tissue were found relative to the control group. These variables were not dependent on the stage of the disease, its activity or severity of endoscopic and histopathological findings. TGF-beta1 mRNA levels were significantly higher in tissue samples withdrawn during the relapse of the disease than in those taken during the remission or in the control group. However, no correlation between TGF-beta1 plasma levels and TGF-beta1 mRNA amount in the intestinal mucosa was observed. CONCLUSIONS: The TGF-beta1 mRNA level, but not the amount of the gene product, was significantly increased in the pathologically changed tissue during the relapse of IBD. We suggest that this parameter might be considered as a potential prognostic value when assessing IBD in children.},

   abstract = {For treatment of moderate-to-severe active Crohn's disease, clinicians generally rely on immunosuppressants (including azathioprine and 6-mercaptopurine), corticosteroids, and antibodies against tumor necrosis factor alpha. However, a significant proportion of patients do not respond to these therapies, lose response over time, or are intolerant to these therapies. In such cases, one of the only remaining pharmacologic treatment options is natalizumab, an alpha4 integrin-targeted antibody. Unfortunately, 3 cases of progressive multifocal leukoencephalopathy (PML) were reported in natalizumab-treated patients in 2005, shortly after natalizumab's approval by the US Food and Drug Administration (FDA). Natalizumab was subsequently withdrawn from the market but was then reintroduced in 2006 under close supervision by the FDA. Careful review of postmarketing data revealed 3 major risk factors for the development of natalizumab-associated PML, the most significant of which is prior exposure to the JC virus (JCV). To help identify patients who may be at higher risk for developing natalizumab-associated PML, a JCV antibody assay was developed that can detect anti-JCV antibodies in patients' blood. Clinicians can now consider a patient's anti-JCV antibody status together with the other major risk factors for natalizumab-associated PML-duration of natalizumab therapy and prior immunosuppressant use-to more accurately gauge the risks and benefits of natalizumab therapy in a particular patient.},

   abstract = {BACKGROUND: Anemia is a common and serious complication in patients with inflammatory bowel disease. The present study was dedicated to evaluate the therapeutic efficacy of erythropoietin (EPO) combined with enteral nutrition (EN) in anemic Crohn's disease (CD) patients, in terms of hemoglobin level, treatment success rate, adverse events, and predictor of this therapy. MATERIALS AND METHODS: We performed a prospective study in CD patients. On the basis of hemoglobin level, all enrolled patients were divided into anemic and nonanemic groups. The anemic group was further divided into EPO and non-EPO subgroups, depending on whether EPO was prescribed. Hematological and other parameters were measured initially and in the first 4 weeks after starting treatment. RESULTS: In total, 109 patients (49 nonanemic and 60 anemic, including 38 EPO and 22 non-EPO) were included. The prevalence of anemia in CD was 55.05%. Age, disease behavior, Crohn's Disease Activity Index scores, C-reactive protein, and erythrocyte sedimentation rate were significantly different between anemic and nonanemic groups. An increase in hemoglobin level and a significant decrease in C-reactive protein level were observed in the EPO treatment group. Treatment success rate was 63.16% in the EPO group, whereas none of patients achieved treatment success in the non-EPO group. CONCLUSION: EPO combined with EN can improve the hemoglobin level in anemic CD patients.},

   abstract = {Nutritional assessment and dietary advice are fundamental to inflammatory bowel disease (IBD) patient management and all patients should have access to a dietitian. Newly diagnosed patients often think that their pre-illness diet has contributed to the development of their IBD. However, epidemiological evidence to support diet as a risk factor is lacking. How the diet contributes to the gastrointestinal microbiota is interesting, although the role is not yet clearly defined. Nutritional problems in IBD are common. Malnutrition occurs in up to 85% of patients and weight loss affects up to 80% of patients with Crohn's disease and 18-62% of patients with ulcerative colitis. Nutritional deficiencies are prevalent, particularly in relation to anaemia and osteoporosis. Intestinal strictures can be problematic in Crohn's disease and limiting fibrous foods that may cause a mechanical obstruction in the gastrointestinal tract is helpful. Patients often explore dietary exclusion to alleviate symptoms but such changes may be self-directed or inappropriately advised and can lead to further nutritional deficiencies. Some patients experience concurrent functional symptoms (e.g. abdominal bloating, abdominal pain, flatulence and diarrhoea) that can significantly affect quality of life. Recently, a group of poorly absorbed carbohydrates that occur naturally in the diet called fermentable oligo-, di-, mono-saccharides and polyols have been associated with functional symptoms by intestinal bacterial fermentation leading to rapid gas production, and an osmotic effect increasing fluid delivery to the colon. Emerging evidence indicates that a diet low in fermentable oligo-, di-, mono-saccharides and polyols can alleviate functional symptoms in IBD.},

   abstract = {BACKGROUND AND AIM: Crohn disease (CD) presents a range of physical, social, and psychological challenges, and can adversely affect the quality of life of those affected by it. The present study aimed to investigate the health-related quality of life of paediatric patients with CD in the Wellington region. Measuring health-related quality of life assists with resource allocation decisions and assesses various forms of interventions. METHODS: Patients ages 9 to 18 years with CD in the Wellington region were assessed using the IMPACT-III inflammatory bowel disease-specific questionnaire (n = 16). Eight participants filled it out and returned it by post; the remaining 8 filled it out in a meeting with the researcher and then underwent cognitive debriefing as part of a cross-cultural adaptation of the questionnaire. RESULTS: Of a maximum possible value of 175, the total health-related quality of life score had a mean value of 119.2 (standard deviation 30.7). Using Spearman rank correlation analysis, significant findings included a positive correlation between disease duration and quality of life (rho = 0.534, sig. <0.05) and a negative correlation between disease activity and quality of life (rho = -0.596, sig. <0.05). Qualitative information included difficulties in coping with long-term and unpleasant treatments and feelings of isolation. CONCLUSIONS: Children with Crohn disease in the Wellington region may benefit from age-specific social and psychological support. Because there is limited information on quality of life in young patients with CD in New Zealand, the results of the present study may be used as baseline data for future studies.},

   abstract = {BACKGROUND & AIMS: Extracellular matrix deposition is key event for the development of bowel stenosis in Crohn's disease patients. Transforming growth factor-beta plays a key role in this process. We aimed at characterizing the effects of tocotrienol rich fraction on ECM proteins production and molecules that regulate the synthesis and degradation of extracellular matrix, matrix metalloproteinase-3 and tissue inhibitor of metalloproteinases-1, in human intestinal fibroblasts, and at elucidating whether the effects of tocotrienol rich fraction (TRF) are mediated through inhibition of TGF-beta1. METHODS: HIF were isolated from colonic or ileal tissue from Crohn's disease patients and control subjects, and were treated with TRF from palm oil either alone or in combination with TGF-beta1. Procollagen 1, procollagen 3, TIMP-1 and MMP-3 production, and Smad3 phosphorylation were analyzed by Western-blotting. RESULTS: TRF significantly diminished procollagen 1 and 3 synthesis in HIF. Treatment of HIF with TRF increased MMP-3 production but did not modify TIMP-1. TGF-beta1 induced Smad3 phosphorylation and enhanced procollagen 1 and 3 and TIMP-1 production. Pre-treatment of HIF with TRF prevented Smad3 phosphorylation and minimized the increase in collagen 1 and 3 production caused by TGF-beta1. CONCLUSIONS: TRF has anti-fibrogenic effects on HIF, decreasing ECM production and increasing its degradation. This effect is mediated, at least in part, by inhibition of TGF-beta1.},

Probiotics offer a method to potentially alter the intestinal microbiome exogenously or may provide an option to deliver microbial metabolic products to alter the chronicity of intestinal mucosal inflammation characterizing IBD. At present, there is little evidence for the benefit of currently used probiotic microbes in Crohn's disease or associated conditions affecting extra-intestinal organs. However, clinical practice guidelines are now including a probiotic as an option for recurrent and relapsing antibiotic sensitive pouchitis and the use of probiotics in mild ulcerative colitis is provocative and suggests potential for benefit in select patients but concerns remain about proof from trials.},

   abstract = {BACKGROUND AND AIM: Treatment with antitumour necrosis factor-alpha therapy such as infliximab may improve growth in children with Crohn disease (CD), but the extent of improvement in growth and its relation to pubertal progress and glucocorticoid (GC) therapy are unclear. This is a retrospective study of growth, puberty, and disease activity during the 6 months before starting infliximab (T - 6), at baseline (T0), and for the following 6 months (T + 6) and 12 months (T + 12) in children with CD. PATIENTS AND METHODS: The growth and treatment details of 28 children (male, 17) who were given infliximab at a median (10th, 90th) age of 13.1 years (10.0, 15.7) were reviewed. Data on disease markers (C-reactive protein, erythrocyte sedimentation rate, and albumin), total alkaline phosphatase, and a physician's global assessment were also collected. Results are expressed as median (10th, 90th). RESULTS: Of the 28 cases, 21 (75%) demonstrated a clinical response to infliximab treatment. Overall, height velocity (HV) increased from 3.6 cm/y (0.4-7.8) at T0 to 5.5 cm/y (2.1-9.2) at T + 6 (P = 0.003). In infliximab responders, HV increased from 2 cm/y (0.3-7.1) to 6.4 cm/y (2.3-9.1) (P = 0.004) and in the nonresponders, HV remained static at 4.3 cm/y (2.5-8.6) at T0 and 3.0 cm/y (2.0-11.3) (P = 0.701) at T + 6. HV also increased in the subgroup of 13 children who had remained prepubertal from 4.5 cm/y (0.4-8) to 5.5 cm/y (3.3-8.4) (P = 0.050). In the subgroup of 11 children who had a reduction (n = 2) or cessation in GC (n = 9), HV increased from 1.8 cm/y (0.3-8.3) at T0 to 5.6 cm/y (2.2-9.2) at T + 6 (P = 0.14), whereas those children who did not receive GC during the 12 months had an increase from 3.7 cm/y (0.6-6.5) to 6.4 cm/y (2.9-9.0) (P < 0.05). HV at T0 and T + 6 showed a significant association with the average alkaline phosphatase during the prior 6 months (r = 0.39, P < 0.05). HV did not show any association with individual markers of disease activity. CONCLUSIONS: Clinical response to infliximab therapy is associated with an improvement in linear growth in the short term in children with CD. This increase in height may not be simply due to progress in pubertal status or reduction in GC dose.},

   abstract = {PURPOSE OF REVIEW: There is accumulating evidence on the importance of microbes in the development and maintenance of both the intestinal and immune systems. This review focuses on the current findings on the role of gastrointestinal pathogens in the cause of chronic inflammatory bowel disease. RECENT FINDINGS: A number of intestinal pathogens including Mycobacterium avium subspecies paratuberculosis, adherent-invasive Escherichia coli, and Campylobacter species are associated at fairly high prevalence with Crohn's disease, while two recent studies found a low prevalence for cytomegalovirus. In a prospective study, M. avium subspecies paratuberculosis detection in early Crohn's disease was low and comparable to controls, while much higher in an established inflammatory bowel disease cohort. In the pediatric setting, a high prevalence of Clostridium difficile was seen in both active and inactive Crohn's disease and ulcerative colitis patients. Some studies have speculated that Salmonella or Campylobacter infection may increase the risk of inflammatory bowel disease on long-term follow-up, but detection bias was found to obscure the risk. Recent studies in mouse models have demonstrated that a combination of factors, including viral pathogens, genetic susceptibility, and commensal microflora, can lead to intestinal pathology. SUMMARY: No evidence for causation of inflammatory bowel disease by a single agent has been found, whereas a number of microbes have been strongly associated with the presence of disease. The majority of recent studies support a role for the ability of intestinal pathogens to promote chronic inflammation in individuals with genetic susceptibility and/or other environmental factors which remain to be identified. These factors may include subsets of commensal microflora.},

   abstract = {INTRODUCTION: Inflammatory bowel diseases (IBD) have classically included two entities: Crohn's disease (CD) and ulcerative colitis (UC). The correct differentiation between these two diseases has important implications. The term inflammatory bowel disease unclassified (IBDu) describes inflammatory changes of the colon that cannot be classified as ulcerative colitis or Crohn's disease. This situation has been described in 20-30% of paediatric IBD at diagnosis. In order to reach a definitive diagnosis of suspicion of inflammatory bowel disease in children, the ESPGHAN (European Society for Paediatric Gastroenterology, Hepatology and Nutrition) established the Porto criteria (PC) in July 2005. The recommendations include: 1) total colonoscopy with ileal intubation, 2) upper endoscopy, 3) multiple biopsies and 4) complete small bowel exploration. AIM: To evaluate the diagnostic procedures used in our IBD patients regarding the PC. PATIENTS AND METHODS: Retrospective review of the data of our IBD patients diagnosed in the last ten years (1999-2008) in a Spanish tertiary hospital, differentiating two periods: before and after the publication of the PC. RESULTS: A total of 108 IBD patients had been diagnosed (51 UC, 52 CD, 5 IBDu), 43 girls (39.81%), 65 boys (60.18%). According to the Montreal classification: 1) UC, 40 (78%) extensive colitis, 5 left-sided colitis (9.8%), 6 proctitis (11%), 2) CD: 44 ileo-colonic (84%), 13 ileal, 7 colonic. Median age at diagnosis: 13 years 1 month (p25-p75: 10 years 3 months- 14 years 9months). The Porto criteria were followed in 49% of the cases (33.3% before its publication, 64.8% after, P=.001). Upper endoscopy was performed in 62 patients (58%): 38.9% versus 72.2%, P<.001. Upper involvement was found in 51% of our CD patients. Total colonoscopy with ileoscopy was achieved in 85.2% of the cases. The mean number of ileo-colonic segments biopsied was 6.6 (7 different segments). Granulomas at biopsies were present in 38% of our CD patients. Up to 38% of the CD patients had microscopic inflammation in endoscopically normal appearing segments. During the follow-up, initial diagnosis among the IBDu patients, was changed to CD in 1, to UC in 2 and the other 3 remained with the same diagnosis. We did not observe other changes in diagnosis in the remaining 103 patients (median follow-up: 4y 8mo). Thirty patients were discharged when becoming adults. CONCLUSIONS: Our clinical practice in IBD diagnosis has changed after the PC. Upper endoscopy is a useful tool to find upper involvement in CD. Total colonoscopy with ileoscopy and performance of multiple biopsies are essential to determine extension of the inflammatory changes. We have not observed changes in the final diagnosis in our CD and UC patients after a median follow-up of 4 years.},

   abstract = {Intestinal remodeling and stricture formation is a complication of inflammatory bowel disease (IBD) that often requires surgical intervention. Although eosinophils are associated with mucosal remodeling in other organs and are increased in IBD tissues, their role in IBD-associated remodeling is unclear. Histological and molecular features of ileitis and remodeling were assessed using immunohistochemical, histomorphometric, flow cytometric, and molecular analysis (real-time RT-PCR) techniques in a murine model of chronic eosinophilic ileitis. Collagen protein was assessed by Sircol assay. Using a spontaneous eosinophilic Crohn's-like mouse model SAMP1/SkuSlc, we demonstrate an association between ileitis progression and remodeling over the course of 40 weeks. Mucosal and submucosal eosinophilia increased over the time course and correlated with increased histological inflammatory indices. Ileitis and remodeling increased over the 40 weeks, as did expression of fibronectin. CCR3-specific antibody-mediated reduction of eosinophils resulted in significant decrease in goblet cell hyperplasia, muscularis propria hypertrophy, villus blunting, and expression of inflammatory and remodeling genes, including fibronectin. Cellularity of local mesenteric lymph nodes, including T- and B-lymphocytes, was also significantly reduced. Thus, eosinophils participate in intestinal remodeling, supporting eosinophils as a novel therapeutic target.},

   abstract = {A 32-year-old well-nourished man having a vesicosigmoidal fistula due to Crohn's disease received laparoscopic sigmoidectomy with partial cystectomy. The bladder wall was closed with an all-layer running suture and additional interrupted sutures using 2-0 Vicryl. Four months after surgery, the suture site on the bladder showed perforation to the abdominal cavity. Since the same event occurred again 6 months after surgery, open partial cystectomy was performed to repair the perforated site 8 months after the initial surgery. The perforated site showed a thinning bladder wall composed of normal urothelium, scar tissue and thin detrusor muscle. Non-caseating granuloma was not found in the specimen, even though it was slightly observed in the margin of the detrusor muscle resected in the initial surgery. Although it was possible that the persisting activity of Crohn's disease, subclinical impaired nutrition due to Crohn's disease or insufficient suturing of the bladder wall were involved in the bladder rupture, the definitive cause remains unknown.},

   abstract = {BACKGROUND Several published studies have evaluated the efficacy of tacrolimus in the management of Crohn's disease with variable conclusions. AIM To review systematically the evidence examining the efficacy and safety of tacrolimus in treating Crohn's disease. METHODS The Cochrane Central Register of Controlled Trials (CENTRAL), MEDLINE (PUBMED) and EMBASE (1984 to January 2011) were searched. Also, references from selected articles were examined. Case series (five or more patients), cohort and randomised controlled trials were eligible for inclusion, incorporating oral, intravenous or topical tacrolimus therapy. The primary outcome was induction of remission of active Crohn's disease. RESULTS Eleven studies met the inclusion criteria which included 163 patients, of which 127 received tacrolimus therapy. In patients with luminal Crohn's disease, the crude pooled remission rate for tacrolimus was 44.3% (range, 7-69%) and the crude pooled response rate was 37.1% (range, 14-57%). For patients with perianal disease using systemic tacrolimus, crude pooled remission rate was 28.6% (range, 0-64%) and crude pooled response rate was 38.8% (range, 0-57%). Combining data from two studies using topical tacrolimus, 35.7% of patients achieved remission and 28.6% partial response. Nonserious adverse effects are common, particularly tremor, paraesthesia and headache. Reversible nephrotoxity occurred in 16% of patients. CONCLUSIONS The current evidence; although of a poor quality, appears to support the use of tacrolimus in Crohn's disease. High quality randomised controlled trials are needed.},

   abstract = {BACKGROUND Inflammatory bowel diseases (IBD), which include ulcerative colitis (UC) and Crohn's disease (CD), are debilitating and chronic disorders with unpredictable courses and complicated treatment measures. Therefore, an efficient treatment protocol seems necessary as therapeutic prophylaxis for these disorders.This study aims to determine the healing effect of Teucrium polium (T. polium) in acetic acid-induced UC in an experimental dog model. METHODS From September to December 2010, eight male (20-25 kg) crossbred dogs were used for induction of UC by 6% acetic acid, transrectally. After one week, three biopsies (10, 20 and 30 cm proximal to the anal verge) were taken from the colon of each animal for histological studies. In the presence of UC, 400 mg/kg/day of T. polium extract was administered orally and transrectally (via enema) for 30 days in six of the dogs. The remaining two dogs were used as controls and did not receive T. polium. Multiple biopsies were taken 7, 14, and 30 days after discontinuation of T. polium in the same manner as before treatment. RESULTS After administration of acetic acid, we noted the presence of multiple ulcers, diffuse inflammation, PMN infiltration in the lamina propria, glandular destruction and goblet cell depletion. Treatment with T. polium restored the colonic architecture with an increased number of healthy cells and a reduction in inflammatory cells. Damage of the surface epithelial cells and mucosal layer of the lumen were reversed, which lead to faster ulcer healing. CONCLUSION T. polium may be a treatment choice for UC and can broaden the current therapy options for UC.},

On admission, evaluation of sputum cultures and chest radiograph pattern of pneumonia led to the suspicion of colobronchial fistula. This diagnosis was confirmed by abdominal CT enteroclysis. This patient's pneumonia was initially treated with empiric antibiotics, then focused antibiotics based on culture results. The treatment for the regional enteritis and the secondary colobronchial fistula consisted of immunosuppression with infliximab, bowel rest, and total parenteral nutrition. The patient was discharged on a limited course of prednisone and received maintenance therapy with 3mg/kg IV infliximab infusions for four additional treatments with dramatic improvement in his clinical condition. Surgical therapy consisted of only bowel resection; no thoracic surgery or lung resection was necessary. The patient has had a dramatic improvement in his clinical condition and is currently disease-free on no maintenance therapy. The use of TNF-blocking agents such as infliximab may simplify the surgical approach in patients with complicated fistulous Crohn's disease.},

Ganglioside composition of the intestinal brush border and apical surface of the colon influences numerous cell processes including microbial attachment, cell division, differentiation, and signaling. Accelerated catabolism of ganglioside in intestinal disease results in increased proinflammatory signaling. Restoring proper structure and function to the diseased intestine can resolve inflammation, increase resistance to infection, and improve gut integrity to induce remission of conditions like necrotizing enterocolitis (NEC) and Crohn's disease (CD). Maintaining inactive state of disease may be achieved by reducing the rate that gangliosides are degraded or by increasing intake of dietary ganglioside. Collectively, the studies outlined in this paper indicate that the amount of gangliosides GM3 and GD3 in intestinal mucosa is decreased with inflammation, low level of GM3 is associated with higher production of proinflammatory signals, and ganglioside content of intestinal mucosa can be increased by dietary ganglioside.},

   abstract = {INTRODUCTION: Crohn's disease is a chronic condition of the gastrointestinal tract. It is characterised by transmural, granulomatous inflammation that occurs in a discontinuous pattern, with a tendency to form fistulae. The cause is unknown but may depend on interactions between genetic predisposition, environmental triggers, and mucosal immunity. METHODS AND OUTCOMES: We conducted a systematic review and aimed to answer the following clinical questions: What are the effects of medical treatments to induce remission in adults with Crohn's disease? What are the effects of surgical interventions to induce and maintain remission in adults with small-bowel Crohn's disease? What are the effects of surgical interventions to induce remission in adults with colonic Crohn's disease? What are the effects of medical interventions to maintain remission in adults with Crohn's disease; and to maintain remission following surgery? What are the effects of lifestyle interventions to maintain remission in adults with Crohn's disease? We searched: Medline, Embase, The Cochrane Library, and other important databases up to December 2009 (Clinical Evidence reviews are updated periodically, please check our website for the most up-to-date version of this review). We included harms alerts from relevant organisations such as the US Food and Drug Administration (FDA) and the UK Medicines and Healthcare products Regulatory Agency (MHRA). RESULTS: We found 93 systematic reviews, RCTs, or observational studies that met our inclusion criteria. CONCLUSIONS: In this systematic review we present information relating to the effectiveness and safety of the following interventions: aminosalicylates, antibiotics, azathioprine/mercaptopurine, ciclosporin, corticosteroids (oral), enteral nutrition, fish oil, infliximab, methotrexate, probiotics, resection, segmental colectomy, smoking cessation, and strictureplasty.},

   abstract = {Transport of molecules across the intestinal epithelium takes place through 2 major routes, ie, trans-cellular and paracellular. Assessment of intestinal permeability is performed to assess the overall function of transport through the intestinal epithelial paracellular route. Urinary excretion of disaccharides and monosaccharides and ratio of their excretion is a basis for measurement of intestinal permeability. Lactulose and mannitol ratio is the most commonly used test for assessment of small intestinal permeability and the most reliable method for measurement of concentration of lactulose and mannitol in the urine is high performance liquid chromatography. After the measurement of concentration of probes in the urine; the results are expressed as the ratio of percentage excretion of the ingested dose of lactulose and mannitol in the urine. Testing of intestinal permeability is not required for routine patient care, however it is an important tool to understand the function of the paracellular transport in the research setting. Increase in intestinal permeability has been implicated in the pathogenesis of many autoimmune diseases including celiac disease, Crohn's disease, type I diabetes and food allergy.},

First, a general overview of the proposed mechanisms for the beneficial effects of Gln is provided, and subsequently clinical studies are discussed. Despite safety, studies are conflicting, partly due to different effects of enteral and parenteral Gln supplementation. Further insufficient evidence is available on the benefits of Gln supplementation in pediatric patients. This includes premature infants, infants with gastrointestinal disease, children with Crohn's disease, short bowel syndrome, malnutrition/diarrhea, cancer, severe burns/trauma, Duchenne muscular dystrophy, sickle cell anemia, cystic fibrosis, and type 1 diabetes. Moreover, methodological issues have been noted in some studies. Further mechanistic data is needed along with large randomized controlled trials in select populations of sick children, who may eventually benefit from supplemental Gln.},

   abstract = {BACKGROUND & AIMS: Appetite disturbance is an important nutritional issue in Crohn's disease (CD), but the biological basis is unclear. Satiety signals such as polypeptide YY (PYY) and glucagon-like peptide-1 (GLP-1) are produced by enteroendocrine cells (EEC). In animal models, upregulation of EEC plays a mechanistic role in feeding disturbance and weight loss. We recently showed increased EEC activity in tissue from active small bowel CD. This study investigated EEC products in plasma in CD, and appetite-related symptoms. METHODOLOGY: Active CD patients and a healthy reference group were studied. Gut peptide responses to a mixed nutrient test meal were measured by ELISA. Symptoms were assessed by visual analogue score. A patient subset was re-studied in remission. RESULTS: CD subjects displayed reduced appetite (p < 0.0001) before and after eating. Total PYY was increased 2.2-fold (p = 0.04) and correlated with nausea (p = 0.036) and bloating (p = 0.037) scores only in small bowel CD. Postprandial plasma ghrelin levels were also elevated. Leptin correlated with body mass index (p = 0.0001) and weight loss (p = 0.01). GLP-1 and GIP were not elevated. In remission, postprandial PYY and ghrelin reverted to control levels. DISCUSSION: Enhanced EEC responses may directly and adversely affect appetite in CD patients through increased gut-brain signalling.},

   abstract = {BACKGROUND AND AIMS: Enteroendocrine cells sense gut luminal contents, and orchestrate digestive physiology whilst contributing to mucosal homeostasis and innate immunity. The terminal ileum is the key site of EEC expression but detailed assessment of their subtypes, lineage transcription factors and expression products has not been undertaken in terminal ileal Crohn's disease. Recent Crohn's disease gene wide association studies have linked the neuroendocrine transcription factor Phox2b; while autoantibodies to an enteroendocrine protein, ubiquitination protein 4a, have been identified as a disease behaviour biomarker. METHODS: Terminal ileal tissue from small or large bowel Crohn's disease and normal controls was analysed for enteroendocrine marker expression by immunohistochemistry and quantitative polymerase chain reaction. Inflammation was graded by endoscopic, clinical, histological and biochemical scoring. RESULTS: In small bowel disease, glucagon-like peptide 1 and chromogranin A cells were increased 2.5-fold (p=0.049) and 2-fold (p=0.031) respectively. Polypeptide YY cells were unchanged. Ileal enteroendocrine cell expression was unaffected in the presence of Crohn's colitis. Phox2b was co-localised to enteroendocrine cells and showed a 1.5-fold increase in ileal disease. Significant mRNA increases were noted for chromogranin A (3.3-fold; p=0.009), glucagon-like peptide 1 (3.1-fold; p=0.007) and ubiquitination protein 4a (2.2-fold; p=0.02). Neurogenin 3, an enteroendocrine transcription factor showed ~2 fold-upregulation (p=0.048). CONCLUSIONS: Enhanced enteroendocrine cell activity is present in small bowel disease, and observed in restricted cell lineages. This may impact on the epithelial immune response, cellular homeostasis and nutrient handling and influence appetite via increased satiety signalling in the gut-brain axis.},

   abstract = {The gene ULK1 is an excellent candidate for Crohn's disease (CD) due to its role in autophagy. A recent study provided evidence for the involvement of ULK1 in the pathogenesis of CD (Henckaerts et al., 2011). We attempted to validate this association, using a candidate gene SNP study of ULK1 in CD. We identified tagging SNPs and genotyped these SNPs using the Sequenom platform in a Caucasian New Zealand dataset consisting of 406 CD patients and 638 controls. In this sample, we were able to demonstrate an association between CD and several different ULK1 SNPs and haplotypes. Phenotypic analysis showed an association with age of diagnosis 17-40 years and inflammatory behaviour. The findings of this study provide evidence to suggest that genetic variation in ULK1 may play a role in interindividual differences in CD susceptibility and clinical outcome.},

   abstract = {BACKGROUND: The inflammatory bowel diseases (IBD) Crohn's disease and ulcerative colitis result from alterations in intestinal microbes and the immune system. However, the precise dysfunctions of microbial metabolism in the gastrointestinal microbiome during IBD remain unclear. We analyzed the microbiota of intestinal biopsies and stool samples from 231 IBD and healthy subjects by 16S gene pyrosequencing and followed up a subset using shotgun metagenomics. Gene and pathway composition were assessed, based on 16S data from phylogenetically-related reference genomes, and associated using sparse multivariate linear modeling with medications, environmental factors, and IBD status. RESULTS: Firmicutes and Enterobacteriaceae abundances were associated with disease status as expected, but also with treatment and subject characteristics. Microbial function, though, was more consistently perturbed than composition, with 12% of analyzed pathways changed compared with 2% of genera. We identified major shifts in oxidative stress pathways, as well as decreased carbohydrate metabolism and amino acid biosynthesis in favor of nutrient transport and uptake. The microbiome of ileal Crohn's disease was notable for increases in virulence and secretion pathways. CONCLUSIONS: This inferred functional metagenomic information provides the first insights into community-wide microbial processes and pathways that underpin IBD pathogenesis.},

   abstract = {BACKGROUND & AIMS: RAC1 is a guanosine triphosphatase that has an evolutionarily conserved role in coordinating immune defenses, from plants to mammals. Chronic inflammatory bowel diseases are associated with dysregulation of immune defenses. We studied the role of RAC1 in inflammatory bowel diseases using human genetic and functional studies and animal models of colitis. METHODS: We used a candidate gene approach to HapMap-Tag single nucleotide polymorphisms in a discovery cohort; findings were confirmed in 2 additional cohorts. RAC1 messenger RNA expression was examined from peripheral blood cells of patients. Colitis was induced in mice with conditional disruption of Rac1 in phagocytes by administration of dextran sulfate sodium. RESULTS: We observed a genetic association between RAC1 with ulcerative colitis in a discovery cohort, 2 independent replication cohorts, and in combined analysis for the single nucleotide polymorphisms rs10951982 (P(combined UC) = 3.3 x 10(-8), odds ratio = 1.43 [95% confidence interval: 1.26-1.63]) and rs4720672 (P(combined UC) = 4.7 x 10(-6), odds ratio = 1.36 [95% confidence interval: 1.19-1.58]). Patients with inflammatory bowel disease who had the rs10951982 risk allele had increased expression of RAC1 compared to those without this allele. Conditional disruption of Rac1 in macrophage and neutrophils of mice protected against dextran sulfate sodium-induced colitis. CONCLUSIONS: Human studies and knockout mice demonstrated a role for the guanosine triphosphatase RAC1 in the development of ulcerative colitis; increased expression of RAC1 was associated with susceptibility to colitis.},

   abstract = {OBJECTIVE: The NOX2 NADPH oxidase complex produces reactive oxygen species and plays a critical role in the killing of microbes by phagocytes. Genetic mutations in genes encoding components of the complex result in both X-linked and autosomal recessive forms of chronic granulomatous disease (CGD). Patients with CGD often develop intestinal inflammation that is histologically similar to Crohn's colitis, suggesting a common aetiology for both diseases. The aim of this study is to determine if polymorphisms in NOX2 NADPH oxidase complex genes that do not cause CGD are associated with the development of inflammatory bowel disease (IBD). METHODS: Direct sequencing and candidate gene approaches were used to identify susceptibility loci in NADPH oxidase complex genes. Functional studies were carried out on identified variants. Novel findings were replicated in independent cohorts. RESULTS: Sequence analysis identified a novel missense variant in the neutrophil cytosolic factor 2 (NCF2) gene that is associated with very early onset IBD (VEO-IBD) and subsequently found in 4% of patients with VEO-IBD compared with 0.2% of controls (p=1.3x10(-5), OR 23.8 (95% CI 3.9 to 142.5); Fisher exact test). This variant reduced binding of the NCF2 gene product p67(phox) to RAC2. This study found a novel genetic association of RAC2 with Crohn's disease (CD) and replicated the previously reported association of NCF4 with ileal CD. CONCLUSION: These studies suggest that the rare novel p67(phox) variant results in partial inhibition of oxidase function and are associated with CD in a subgroup of patients with VEO-IBD; and suggest that components of the NADPH oxidase complex are associated with CD.},

   abstract = {BACKGROUND: Vitamin D has immune-regulatory functions in experimental colitis, and low vitamin D levels are present in Crohn's disease. METHODS: We performed a randomized double-blind placebo-controlled trial to assess the benefits of oral vitamin D3 treatment in Crohn's disease. We included 108 patients with Crohn's disease in remission, of which fourteen were excluded later. Patients were randomized to receive either 1200 IU vitamin D3 (n = 46) or placebo (n = 48) once daily during 12 months. The primary endpoint was clinical relapse. RESULTS: Oral vitamin D3 treatment with 1200 IU daily increased serum 25OHD from a mean of 69 nmol/L [standard deviation (s.d.) 31 nmol/L] to a mean of 96 nmol/L (s.d. 27 nmol/L) after 3 months (P < 0.001). The relapse rate was lower among patients treated with vitamin D3 (6/46 or 13%) among patients treated with placebo (14/48 or 29%), (P = 0.06). CONCLUSIONS: Oral supplementation with 1200 IE vitamin D3 significantly increased serum vitamin D levels and insignificantly reduced the risk of relapse from 29% to 13%, (P = 0.06). Given that vitamin D3 treatment might be effective in Crohn's disease, larger studies are required in order to elucidate this matter further. (Aliment Pharmacol Ther 2010;32:377-383.).},

   abstract = {The objective was to systematically review the efficacy and safety of n-3 (omega-3 fatty acids, fish oil) for maintaining remission in Crohn's disease (CD) and ulcerative colitis (UC). Electronic databases were searched systematically for randomized controlled trials of n-3 for maintenance of remission in inflammatory bowel disease (IBD). Studies of patients of any age group who were in remission at the time of recruitment and were followed for at least 6 months were included. The primary outcome was relapse rate at the end of the follow-up period. Nine studies were eligible for inclusion; six studies of CD (n = 1039) and three of UC (n = 138). There was a statistically significant benefit for n-3 in CD (relative risk [RR] 0.77; 95% confidence interval [CI] 0.61-0.98); however, the studies were heterogeneous (I 2 = 58%). The absolute risk reduction was -0.14 (95% CI: -0.25 to -0.02). Opinions may vary on whether this is a clinically significant effect. Two well-done studies with a larger sample size reported no benefit. A sensitivity analysis excluding a small pediatric study resulted in the pooled RR being no longer statistically significant. A funnel plot analysis suggested publication bias for the smaller studies. For UC, there was no difference in the relapse rate between the n-3 and control groups (RR 1.02; 95% CI: 0.51-2.03). The pooled analysis showed a higher rate of diarrhea (RR 1.36; 95% CI: 1.01-1.84) and symptoms of the upper gastrointestinal tract (RR 1.96; 95% CI: 1.37-2.80) in the n-3 treatment group. There are insufficient data to recommend the use of omega-3 fatty acids for maintenance of remission in CD and UC. ( Inflamm Bowel Dis. 2011;17:336-345).},

   abstract = {BACKGROUND: Diminished intestinal epithelial barrier function contributes to the pathogenesis of Crohn's disease. Clinical and experimental studies propose that increased tumor necrosis factor (TNF)-alpha promotes barrier dysfunction. The aim of this study was to investigate the effects of nutritional and other therapies upon intestinal barrier function in the presence of TNF-alpha in an in vitro model. METHODS: Caco-2 monolayers were grown to confluence on membrane supports and then exposed to TNF-alpha in the presence of polymeric formula, hydrocortisone or infliximab. Monolayer permeability was evaluated by measuring epithelial resistance, short-circuit current and horseradish peroxidase flux in an Ussing chamber. Tight junction and myosin II regulatory light-chain kinase gene expression was analysed by real-time PCR, with protein expression and localization analysed by Western blot and immunofluorescence. RESULTS: TNF-alpha increased monolayer permeability and diminished tight junction integrity. However both polymeric formula and infliximab completely abrogated the effects of TNF-alpha. These monolayers displayed unchanged permeability and tight junction integrity compared to untreated cells (media-no-TNF-alpha controls). In contrast, hydrocortisone only partially abrogated the effects of TNF-alpha, with these monolayers having increased permeability and altered tight junction integrity compared to media-no-TNF-alpha controls. CONCLUSIONS: Both polymeric formula and infliximab completely prevent epithelial barrier dysfunction in the presence of TNF-alpha, whereas hydrocortisone partially prevents barrier dysfunction. These results provide evidence that superior mucosal healing can be achieved with both polymeric formula and infliximab compared to hydrocortisone.},

Exclusive enteral nutrition (EEN) is an established therapy for the induction of remission in Crohn's disease (CD). The aims of this study were to ascertain serum, fecal, and mucosal expression of OPG in children with CD and to investigate the effects of EEN on OPG expression. METHODS: OPG was measured by enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay in serum, mucosal, and fecal samples collected from children with CD and controls. Fecal and Serum OPG was measured prior to and following 6-8 weeks of EEN therapy. RESULTS: Children with CD (n=82) and controls (n=45) were included. Mucosal and fecal OPG levels were elevated in CD compared to controls (P=0.018 and P<0.0001, respectively). Serum OPG was elevated in children with severe CD (P=0.005). Serum and fecal OPG levels dropped significantly following EEN therapy (P=0.0001 and P=0.002, respectively). CONCLUSIONS: Increased serum and fecal OPG are seen in active CD and likely originate from the inflamed gut. Fecal and serum OPG decrease following EEN therapy. Further investigation of OPG and related proteins in the setting of IBD is now required.},

   abstract = {In the past, the impact of infliximab therapy on nutritional status in patients with Crohn's disease (CD) has not been assessed. This prospective study was to investigate the effect of infliximab on nutritional status in CD patients. Fifty consecutive patients with active CD received infliximab (5 mg/kg) at weeks 0, 2 and 6 as remission induction therapy, and then at 8 weeks intervals as maintenance therapy. Patients were followed for 60 weeks. CD activity index (CDAI) and body mass index (BMI) were monitored. A fall in CDAI by >/=70 was defined as response to therapy, while CDAI<150 meant clinical remission. At week 10, 39 patients (78%) responded to infliximab induction therapy. BMI significantly increased during these 10 weeks (P<0.0001). The mean increase in BMI was significantly higher in patients who responded to infliximab vs patients who did not (P=0.03). Further, at weeks 30 and 60, 35 patients (70%) and 33 (66%) were in remission, respectively. The mean increase in BMI was significantly higher in patients who maintained remission vs patients not in remission (week 30, P=0.02; week 60, P=0.01). Patients with a low baseline BMI (<18.5) and those with small bowel involvement achieved a higher increase in BMI as compared to patients with BMI>/=18.5 or patients without small bowel involvement. In this study, infliximab therapy was associated with improvement of patients' nutritional status, notably patients who responded to this biologic. Additionally, in patients with malnutrition and small bowel involvement, the nutritional impact of infliximab was higher.},

   abstract = {OBJECTIVE: Inflammatory bowel disease (IBD) is a chronic inflammatory process in the digestive tract and patients with IBD develop osteopenia. Although vitamins K and D are important for maintaining bone health and inhibiting inflammation, their roles in patients with IBD are not clear. We investigated the roles of vitamins K and D in the bone health and inflammation in patients with IBD. METHODS: Bone mineral density (BMD) of patients with IBD (Crohn's disease [CD], n = 47, and ulcerative colitis [UC], n = 40) was measured with dual-energy X-ray absorptiometry. Vitamin K and D levels of patients with IBD and healthy volunteers (n = 41) were evaluated by measuring serum undercarboxylated osteocalcin and 1,25 dihydroxyvitamin D, respectively. Clinical activity index was evaluated in patients with CD and UC. RESULTS: BMD was low in patients with CD and UC. Serum undercarboxylated osteocalcin levels were significantly higher in patients with CD, but not with UC, compared with healthy subjects, indicating that bone vitamin K is insufficient in patients with CD. The levels of undercarboxylated osteocalcin were significantly correlated with the clinical activity index of CD, although they were not correlated with BMD. The levels of 1,25 dihydroxyvitamin D were significantly lower in patients with CD and UC than in healthy subjects. The levels of 1,25 dihydroxyvitamin D were inversely correlated with BMD in patients with UC and were not correlated with the clinical activity index of CD. CONCLUSION: Vitamins K and D are insufficient in patients with IBD. Insufficiency of vitamin K is suggested to be associated with inflammatory processes of CD.},

   abstract = {In vitro and animals models have long been used to study human diseases and identify novel therapeutic approaches that can be applied to combat these conditions. Ulcerative colitis and Crohn's disease are the two main entities of inflammatory bowel disease (IBD). There is an intricate relationship between IBD features in human patients, in vitro and animal colitis models, mechanisms and possible therapeutic approaches in these models, and strategies that can be extrapolated and applied in humans. Malnutrition, particularly protein-energy malnutrition and vitamin and micronutrient deficiencies, as well as dysregulation of the intestinal microbiota, are common features of IBD. Based on these observations, dietary supplementation with essential nutrients known to be in short supply in the diet in IBD patients and with other molecules believed to provide beneficial anti-inflammatory effects, as well as with probiotic organisms that stimulate immune functions and resistance to infection has been tested in colitis models. Here we review current knowledge on nutritional and probiotic supplementation in in vitro and animal colitis models. While some of these strategies require further fine-tuning before they can be applied in human IBD patients, their intended purpose is to prevent, delay or treat disease symptoms in a non-pharmaceutical manner.},

The review discusses the potential role of environmental factors such as diet and microbiota as well as genetics in the etiology of IBD. It is suggested that microbial ecosystem in the human bowel colonizing the gut in many different microhabitats can be influence by diet, leading to formation of metabolic processes that are essential form the bowel metabolism.},

Although biological agents are alternative treatments, they may not be suitable or available to some patients. AIM: To review the evidence for use of nonbiological drugs in the treatment of patients with IBD refractory to corticosteroids or thiopurines. METHODS: A literature search was performed using PubMed for English language publications with predetermined search criteria to identify relevant studies. RESULTS: Published evidence from uncontrolled series and controlled clinical trials has been used to produce a practical approach relevant to clinical practice which incorporates the indication, optimal dose, and side effects of various therapies including tacrolimus, methotrexate, thalidomide, tioguanine, mycophenolate mofotil, leucocyte apheresis, nutritional therapy, antibiotics, probiotics, allopurinol, rectal acetarsol and ciclosporin in the treatment of patients with refractory ulcerative colitis and Crohn's disease. Approaches to optimise thiopurine efficacy are also discussed. CONCLUSIONS: Patients with IBD refractory to corticosteroids or thiopurines may respond to alternative anti-inflammatory chemical molecules, but the evidence base for many of these alternatives is limited and further trials are needed.},

   abstract = {BACKGROUND AND AIM: The effect of vitamin D supplementation on immune disorders has been a topical research focus. The aim of this systematic review was to examine the current evidence of the effect of vitamin D supplementation as a therapy for colitis. METHODS: The following databases were searched: MEDLINE, Pubmed, Scopus, Web of Knowledge, Cinicaltrials.gov and the Cochrane Central Register of Controlled Trials using the terms 'inflammatory bowel disease' 'Crohn's disease' 'ulcerative colitis' 'colitis' [and] 'vitamin D'. Both human and animal studies published in English language were examined. The reference lists of included studies and review articles were manually searched for any relevant studies. RESULTS: Four studies were included in this systematic review. All reported an improvement in disease activity with vitamin D supplementation. The only high quality human study reported a non-significant reduction of relapse rate for Crohn's disease. No major adverse effects of vitamin D supplementation were reported. CONCLUSIONS: Although there is some evidence that supplemental vitamin D, as an adjunctive treatment, may help in controlling colitis, this evidence is not enough to justify using vitamin D in treating inflammatory bowel disease (IBD). Large high quality placebo-controlled randomised controlled trials are needed to explore a possible benefit of using vitamin D in treating IBD.},

   abstract = {BACKGROUND: Alterations in intestinal permeability have been implicated in the pathogenesis of Crohn disease (CD). We have reported that granulocyte macrophage-colony-stimulating factor (GM-CSF) is required for mucosal barrier function in mice, and elevated neutralizing GM-CSF autoantibodies (Ab) are associated with stricturing ileal disease and surgery in patients with CD. We hypothesized that children with CD with elevated GM-CSF Ab would exhibit increased intestinal permeability. PATIENTS AND METHODS: Subjects were divided into 3 groups: 15 with CD and high GM-CSF Ab (>/= 1.6 mug/mL, GM-CSF Ab Hi), 12 with CD and low GM-CSF Ab (<1.6 mug/mL, GM-CSF Ab Lo), and 15 healthy controls. Subjects ingested a lactulose:mannitol (L:M) solution, and urinary excretion of LM was measured by high-performance liquid chromatography. Serum GM-CSF Ab, endotoxin core Ab (EndoCAb), and lipopolysaccharide-binding protein (LBP), and fecal S100A12 were determined by enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay. RESULTS: The CD groups did not vary by age, sex, disease location, or activity. Neither systemic (serum LBP) nor mucosal (fecal S100A12) inflammation differed between the CD groups. Intestinal permeability as measured by the urine L:M ratio and endotoxin exposure as measured by serum EndoCAb were increased in the GM-CSF Ab Hi group compared to the GM-CSF Ab Lo group and controls. CONCLUSIONS: Patients with CD with elevated GM-CSF Ab exhibit an increase in bowel permeability relative to patients with CD with lower levels of GM-CSF Ab in the absence of differences in systemic or intestinal inflammation. Therapies that target the mucosal barrier may be of particular benefit in this subgroup of patients with CD.},

CF is usually referred to as an ectopic extension of mesenteric adipose tissue (MAT). However, since no animal model developing CF has ever been established, very little is known about this type of fat-depot expansion and its role in the development of the disease. METHODS: We developed and standardized an experimental protocol in mice that reproducibly induces CF development when a severe colonic inflammation is obtained by intracolonic instillation of DNBS. RESULTS: Macro-microscopic observations revealed a fatty appearance of CF. Yet when compared to MAT from the same animals, CF contains very little triglycerides, few adipocytes, and we observed a very low expression and protein levels of both adipose markers (hormone-sensitive lipase, perilipin) and adipocytokines (leptin, adiponectin). The decreased expression of perilipin in CF was also observed by immunohistochemistry. Conversely, the expression of proinflammatory and fibrous markers (Pref-1) was much higher in CF than in MAT. These observations were fully consistent with those made on CF recovered from five CD patients and compared with subcutaneous and mesenteric fat from the same patients. CONCLUSIONS: Altogether, this work reports an original experimental mice model of CF. In this model we establish for the first time that CF only occurs in severe colonic inflammation and shows an inflammatory, fibrous but not an adipose pattern.},

   abstract = {AIM: We assessed the long-term outcome of infliximab (IFX) therapy in patients with Crohn's disease (CD) and investigated the efficacy of concomitant endoscopic balloon dilation (EBD) for intestinal stricture during treatment. METHODS: The effectiveness of maintenance therapy with IFX was retrospectively evaluated in 185 patients with CD in a single center (median observation period 24 months). IFX effectiveness with and without immunomodulators (IMM) and enteral nutrition (EN), as well as cumulative surgery-free rates, were compared. The efficacy of concomitant EBD in patients with obstructive symptoms and high-level stricture was evaluated. RESULTS: In 185 patients receiving the maintenance therapy, the long-term efficacy rate was 84.9% at 24 months and 79.0% at 48 months. The cumulative surgery-free rate was significantly higher in the maintenance group (P < 0.001). Concomitant IMM and EN did not significantly affect the effectiveness of IFX. IFX was discontinued in only 18 cases (7.3%). Symptomatic high-level stricture occurred in 33 patients (17.8%) in the maintenance group and the cumulative surgery-free rate was significantly higher in the EBD combination compared with the non-EBD group (P < 0.05). If EBD were considered invasive intervention, the actual cumulative surgery rate in the maintenance group was significantly lower compared with the cumulative invasive intervention rate (P < 0.001). CONCLUSION: Long-term treatment with IFX is highly effective. The surgery-free rate was clearly higher in the maintenance group. Only concomitant EBD for intestinal stricture helped in the avoidance of surgery.},

In consideration of high cost and safety issues there is the need to have clear recommendations for their use. Despite the American Gastroenterological Association and the European Crohn's and Colitis Organisation have published exhaustive Inflammatory Bowel Disease guidelines, national guidelines may be necessary as cultural values, economical and legal issues may differ between countries. For these reasons the Italian Society of Gastroenterology and the Italian Group for the study of Inflammatory Bowel Disease have decided to elaborate the Italian guidelines on the use of biologics in Inflammatory Bowel Disease. The following items have been chosen: definitions of active, inactive, steroid dependent and resistant disease; measures of activity; anti-tumor necrosis factor alpha therapy use in active steroid dependent and refractory luminal Crohn's Disease, in fistulising Crohn's Disease, in steroid dependent and resistant active Ulcerative Colitis; risk of cancer; risk of infections during anti-tumor necrosis factor alpha therapy; special situations. These guidelines are based on evidence from relevant medical literature and clinical experience of a national working group.},

   abstract = {BACKGROUND AND AIM: Budesonide (BUD) is being used in pediatric Crohn disease (CD) because it is believed to have the potential to reduce corticosteroid-related toxicity; however, few data are available describing its use. The aim of the present study was to describe BUD use in an inception cohort of pediatric patients with CD. METHODS: Data were derived from the prospective Pediatric IBD Collaborative Research Group Registry established in 2002 in North America. Use of BUD in children with CD was examined. RESULTS: BUD was used in 119 of 932 (13%) of children with newly diagnosed CD, with 56 of 119 (47%) starting BUD </= 30 days of diagnosis (26/56 with ileum and/or ascending colon [IAC] disease). BUD was used as monotherapy (9%), in combination with 5-aminosalicylates (77%), or in combination with immunomodulators (43%). Forty-three percent (24/56) went on to receive conventional corticosteroid at some point following their first BUD course. For the 63 of 119 (53%) who started BUD beyond the diagnosis period, 51 of 63 (81%) also received prednisone, with BUD used as a means of weaning from prednisone in 17 of 63 (27%). Patients with IAC disease who received BUD </= 30 days of diagnosis were just as likely to have received conventional corticosteroids by 1 year as were those who did not receive BUD </= 30 days of diagnosis. Two-thirds (77/119) of patients received BUD for </= 6 months. CONCLUSIONS: BUD is being used among pediatric patients newly diagnosed as having CD, although the majority does not have disease limited to the IAC. BUD monotherapy was rare, and further data are required to better define the role of BUD in the treatment of pediatric CD.},

   abstract = {BACKGROUND: The magnitude of association between homocysteine metabolism and inflammatory bowel diseases (IBD) remains unknown, whereas the association between hyperhomocysteinaemia and thrombosis remains controversial in IBD. AIM: To conduct a systematic review and meta-analysis to examine these issues. METHODS: The literature search was conducted using MEDLINE database and international conference abstracts from January 1966 to April 2011 and included all studies that evaluated plasma homocysteine level in IBD. RESULTS: Twenty-eight studies evaluated the plasma homocysteine level and/or hyperhomocysteinaemia risk in IBD patients. Five studies assessed the association of hyperhomocysteinaemia with thrombosis. The mean plasma homocysteine level was significantly higher in IBD patients when compared with controls (weighted mean difference (WMD)=3.75 mumol/L; 95% CI, 2.23-5.26 mumol/L; P<0.0001; reference ranges for plasma homocysteine level: 5-12 mumol/L). The mean plasma homocysteine level did not differ between ulcerative colitis (UC) and Crohn's disease (CD) (WMD=0.41 mumol/L; 95% CI, -2.45 to 3.06 mumol/L; P=0.76). The risk of hyperhomocysteinaemia was significantly higher in IBD patients when compared with controls [odds ratio (OR)=4.65; 95% CI, 3.04-7.09; P<0.0001]. The risk of hyperhomocysteinaemia was not higher among IBD patients who experienced thromboembolic complications (OR=1.97; 95% CI, 0.83-4.67; P=0.12). Plasma folate level was inversely correlated with IBD risk associated with MTHFR C677T polymorphism (P=0.006). CONCLUSIONS: The risk of hyperhomocysteinaemia is significantly higher in IBD patients when compared with controls. The risk assessment of hyperhomocysteinaemia-related thrombosis in IBD requires further investigation. Deficient folate status is associated with a higher impact of MTHFR C677T polymorphism on IBD risk.},

Seven days later, combination therapy with ADA plus intensive granulocyte/monocyte adsorptive apheresis (GMA) was initiated, which induced clinical remission.

   abstract = {OBJECTIVE: The aim of this study was to evaluate the results of surgery in children with Crohn disease (CD) not responding to medical therapy and establish whether surgery improves growth and nutrition. PATIENTS AND METHODS: Children with CD diagnosed between 1998 and 2008 were reviewed. Relapse was defined by Harvey-Bradshaw index >5. Data, reported as median (range), were compared by Fisher exact test and repeated-measures ANOVA. RESULTS: One hundred forty-one children, ages 12.7 years (3.5-16.8), were identified; 27 (19%) required surgery 14.5 months (1.1-61.8) after diagnosis. Twenty-one had elective surgery (19 isolated ileocaecal disease and stricture, 2 diffuse disease of ileum); 6 had emergency surgery (3 peritonitis, 2 haemorrhage, 1 perforation). Surgery included 18 ileocaecal resection and end-to-end anastomosis, 5 stoma formation, 2 left hemicolectomy and end-to-end anastomosis, and 2 stricturoplasty. Follow-up was 2.5 years (1-9.4). Growth and nutrition improved by 6 and 12 months after surgery, with a significant increase in weight z score (P < 0.0001), height z score (P < 0.0001), albumin (30 [13-36] vs 39 [30-46] vs 40 [33-45], P < 0.0001), and haemoglobin [10 (6.8-13.2) vs 11.7 (8.2-13.7) vs 12.0 (9.3-14.7), P < 0.0001]. All patients of the received azathioprine (2-2.5 mg . kg(-)(1) . day(-)(1)) after surgery. Fifteen patients (55%) relapsed with a modified Harvey-Bradshaw index of 8 (6-11) within 11.5 months (4.2-33.4). Of these, 5 patients (18%) relapsed within 1 year. Five patients (18%) had further surgery (2 anastomotic strictures, 2 diseased stoma, and 1 enterocutaneous fistula). CONCLUSIONS: Growth and nutrition following surgery for CD improve, but there is a high relapse rate. Despite this, the improved growth and nutrition before relapse may be beneficial during puberty and justify surgery in children not responding to medications.},

   abstract = {BACKGROUND: Increasing evidence suggests that cytokine dysregulation in T-helper 1 and T-helper 2 (TH1/TH2) subsets contributes to the pathogenesis of Crohn disease (CD). The present pilot study examines the hypothesis that cytokine profiles differ between pediatric and adult patients with CD. METHODS: Production of TH1 cytokines interferon-gamma (IFN-gamma) and tumor necrosis factor-alpha (TNF-alpha) and of TH2 cytokines interleukin-4 (IL-4) and IL-6 was analyzed in peripheral blood of patients with CD and healthy controls (n=20) using flow cytometry after in vitro stimulation. RESULTS: In both pediatric and adult subjects, frequencies of TNF-alpha CD4+ T cells were higher in patients with CD than in controls (P=0.009 and P=0.047, respectively). Percentages of cells expressing IL-4 were slightly increased (P=0.036), whereas those for IFN-gamma were decreased (P=0.009) in pediatric patients with CD compared with controls. As expected, the overall production of TH1 cytokines was higher in adults compared with pediatric subjects. When memory CD4+CD45RO+ T cells were considered, lower IFN-gamma expression was observed in pediatric subjects with CD compared with controls (P=0.009), matching the trend seen in the general CD4+ T cell population. The percentage of CD4+CD45RO+ T cells was increased in adult patients with CD compared with pediatric patients with CD (P=0.016). CONCLUSIONS: The present study describes a peripheral blood TH1/TH2 cytokine imbalance in CD and suggests different immunological mechanisms in children and adults for disease pathogenesis.},

   abstract = {Malabsorption encompasses dysfunctions occurring during the digestion and absorption of nutrients. A small proportion of patients presents with chronic diarrhoea. A clinical history supportive of malabsorption may guide investigations toward either the small bowel or pancreas. Serological testing for coeliac disease will determine most cases without invasive investigations. In the clinical context of persisting weight loss and malnutrition, small bowel enteropathy may be investigated with small intestinal biopsies. Small bowel absorptive capacity and permeability might be measured by oral sugar-mix ingestion. Further, approaches to the investigation of malabsorption might also involve the detection in faeces of a substance that has not been absorbed. A variation of the latter is the use of breath testing which relies on the breakdown of the malabsorbed test substance by colonic flora. Measurement of protein absorption is difficult and unreliable; it is, therefore, rarely advocated in clinical settings. No single biological marker confirming a diagnosis of small bowel malabsorption or small bowel integrity is presently available in clinical practice. Plasma citrulline concentration, an amino acid not incorporated into endogenous or exogenous proteins, has been extensively used in research studies and supportive results are establishing its concentration as a reliable quantitative biomarker of enterocyte absorptive capacity.},

   abstract = {OBJECTIVES: There are very few published studies of agents having the potential to improve bone health in children with inflammatory bowel disease (IBD). The objective of this study was to establish the efficacy and safety of intranasal calcitonin in improving bone mineral density (BMD) in young patients with IBD and to define additional factors that impact bone mineral accrual. METHODS: We conducted a randomized, placebo-controlled, double-blind clinical trial in 63 participants, ages 8-21 years, with a spinal BMD Z-score </= -1.0 s.d. measured by dual energy X-ray absorptiometry. Subjects were randomized to 200 IU intranasal calcitonin (n=31) or placebo (n=32) daily. All received age-appropriate calcium and vitamin D supplementation. Subsequent BMD measurements were obtained at 9 and 18 months. RESULTS: Intranasal calcitonin was well tolerated. Adverse event frequency was similar in both treatment groups, and such events were primarily minor, reversible, and limited to the upper respiratory tract. The BMD Z-score change documented at screening and 9 months and screening and 18 months did not differ between the two therapeutic arms. In participants with Crohn's disease, the spinal BMD Z-score improved between screening and 9 months (change in spine BMD Z-score (DeltaZSBMD)(9-0)) in the calcitonin group (DeltaZSBMD(9-0)(calcitonin)=0.21 (0.37), DeltaZSBMD(9-0)(placebo)=-0.15 (0.5), P=0.02); however, this was only a secondary subgroup analysis. Bone mineral accrual rate during the trial did not lead to normalization of BMD Z-score in this cohort. Factors favoring higher bone mineral accrual rate were lower baseline BMD and higher baseline body mass index Z-score, improvement in height Z-score, higher serum albumin, hematocrit and iron concentration, and more hours of weekly weight-bearing activity. Factors associated with lower bone mineral accrual rate were more severe disease-as indicated by elevated inflammatory markers, need for surgery, hospitalization, and the use of immunomodulators-and higher daily caffeine intake. CONCLUSIONS: Intranasal calcitonin is well tolerated but does not offer a long-term advantage in youth with IBD and decreased BMD. Bone mineral accrual rate remains compromised in youth with IBD and low BMD raising concerns for long-term bone health outcomes. Improvement in nutritional status, catch-up linear growth, control of inflammation, increase in weight-bearing activity, and lower daily caffeine intake may be helpful in restoring bone density in children with IBD and low BMD.},

With the rising prevalence of both Crohn's disease and ulcerative colitis, inflammatory bowel disease (IBD) represents the leading chronic gastrointestinal disease with increasing healthcare expenditures in the US. IBD costs have shifted from inpatient to outpatient care since the introduction of biologic therapies as the standard of care. Gastroenterologists need to be aware of the national cost burden of IBD and clinical practices that optimize cost-efficiency. This investigation offers a systematic review of the economics of IBD and evidence-based strategies for cost-effective management.},

Pregnant women who are vegetarian or vegan, have Crohn's or celiac disease, or have undergone gastric bypass surgery are at increased risk of B12 deficiency. Low serum levels of B12 have been linked to negative impacts in cognitive, motor, and growth outcomes. Low cobalamin levels also may be related to depression in adults. Some studies indicate that B12 supplementation may improve outcomes in children, although more research is needed in this area. Overall, the mechanisms of B12 action in development remain unclear. Further studies in this area to elucidate the pathways of cobalamin influence on development, as well as to prevent B12 deficiency in pregnant women and children are indicated.},

   abstract = {BACKGROUND: New medical therapies have improved outlook in inflammatory bowel disease but published impact on surgical rates has been modest suggesting that many patients are still not attaining remission. AIM: To review remission rates with current medical treatments for inflammatory bowel disease. METHODS: We searched MEDLINE (source PUBMED, 1966 to January, 2011). RESULTS: Induction and maintenance of remission was observed in 20% (range, 9-29.5%) and 53% (range, 36.8-59.6%) of ulcerative colitis (UC) patients treated with oral 5-ASA derivatives. Induction of remission was noted in 52% (range, 48-58%) of Crohn's disease (CD) patients and 54% of UC patients treated with steroids in population-based cohorts. Maintenance of remission was reported in 71% (range, 56-95%) of CD patients on azathioprine over a 6-month to 2-year period and in 60% (range, 41.7-82.4%) in UC at 1 year or longer. Induction and maintenance of remission was noted in 39% (range, 19.3-66.7%) and 70% (range, 39-90%) of CD patients on methotrexate over a 40-week period. Induction of remission was reported in 32% (range, 25-48%), 26% (range, 18-36%) and 20% (range, 19-23%) of CD patients on infliximab, adalimumab or certolizumab pegol, respectively. The corresponding figures were 45% (range, 39-59%), 43% (range, 40-47%) and 47.9% at weeks 20-30 among initial responders. Induction of remission was observed in 33% (range, 27.5-38.8%) and 18.5% of UC patients on infliximab or adalimumab, respectively. Maintenance of remission was noted in 33% (range, 25.6-36.9%) of UC patients on infliximab at week 30. Approximately one-fifth of CD and UC patients treated with biologicals require intestinal resection after 2-5 years in referral-centre studies. CONCLUSION: In the era of biologics, the proportion of patients with inflammatory bowel disease not entering remission remains high.},

   abstract = {AIM: To investigate the anti-inflammatory properties of Lacto-Wolfberry (LWB), both in vitro and using a mouse model of experimental colitis. METHODS: The effects of LWB on lipopolysaccharide (LPS)-induced reactive oxygen species (ROS) and interleukin (IL)-6 secretion were assessed in a murine macrophage cell line. in vitro assessment also included characterizing the effects of LWB on the activation of NF-E2 related 2 pathway and inhibition of tumor necrosis factor-alpha (TNF-alpha)-induced nuclear factor-kappaB (NF-kappaB) activation, utilizing reporter cell lines. Following the in vitro assessment, the anti-inflammatory efficacy of an oral intervention with LWB was tested in vivo using a preclinical model of intestinal inflammation. Multiple outcomes including body weight, intestinal histology, colonic cytokine levels and anti-oxidative measures were investigated. RESULTS: LWB reduced the LPS-mediated induction of ROS production [+LPS vs 1% LWB + LPS, 1590 +/- 188.5 relative luminescence units (RLU) vs 389 +/- 5.9 RLU, P < 0.001]. LWB was more effective than wolfberry alone in reducing LPS-induced IL-6 secretion in vitro (wolfberry vs 0.5% LWB, 15% +/- 7.8% vs 64% +/- 5%, P < 0.001). In addition, LWB increased reporter gene expression via the anti-oxidant response element activation (wolfberry vs LWB, 73% +/- 6.9% vs 148% +/- 28.3%, P < 0.001) and inhibited the TNF-alpha-induced activation of the NF-kappaB pathway (milk vs LWB, 10% +/- 6.7% vs 35% +/- 3.3%, P < 0.05). Furthermore, oral supplementation with LWB resulted in a reduction of macroscopic (-LWB vs +LWB, 5.39 +/- 0.61 vs 3.66 +/- 0.59, P = 0.0445) and histological scores (-LWB vs +LWB, 5.44 +/- 0.32 vs 3.66 +/- 0.59, P = 0.0087) in colitic mice. These effects were associated with a significant decrease in levels of inflammatory cytokines such as IL-1beta (-LWB vs +LWB, 570 +/- 245 mug/L vs 89 +/- 38 mug/L, P = 0.0106), keratinocyte-derived chemokine/growth regulated protein-alpha (-LWB vs +LWB, 184 +/- 49 mug/L vs 75 +/- 20 mug/L, P = 0.0244), IL-6 (-LWB vs +LWB, 318 +/- 99 mug/L vs 117 +/- 18 mug/L, P = 0.0315) and other pro-inflammatory proteins such as cyclooxygenase-2 (-LWB vs +LWB, 0.95 +/- 0.12 AU vs 0.36 +/- 0.11 AU, P = 0.0036) and phosphorylated signal transducer and activator of transcription-3 (-LWB vs +LWB, 0.51 +/- 0.15 AU vs 0.1 +/- 0.04 AU, P = 0.057). Moreover, antioxidant biomarkers, including expression of gene encoding for the glutathione peroxidase, in the colon and the plasma anti-oxidant capacity were significantly increased by supplementation with LWB (-LWB vs +LWB, 1.2 +/- 0.21 mmol/L vs 2.1 +/- 0.19 mmol/L, P = 0.0095). CONCLUSION: These results demonstrate the anti-inflammatory properties of LWB and suggest that the underlying mechanism is at least in part due to NF-kappaB inhibition and improved anti-oxidative capacity.},

   abstract = {Probiotics have been suggested as an alternative therapeutical approach in the intervention of inflammatory disorders of the gastrointestinal tract (GIT). Application of single strains or probiotic mixtures has shown promising results in animal models and patients of inflammatory bowel disease (IBD). We recently demonstrated potent inhibitory capacity of a Bifidobacterium bifidum S17 on LPS-induced inflammatory events in cell culture models using intestinal epithelial cells and verified these anti-inflammatory effects in two mouse models of colitis. In the present study we analyze the anti-inflammatory effect of this potential probiotic strain in a chemically-induced model of colitis in C57BL/6 mice. This model is characterized by a strong type 1T helper (Th1) response resembling Crohn's disease, one of the two most prevalent forms of IBD. We performed macroscopic analysis and determined the effect of B. bifidum S17 on the cytokine balance in biopsies of the colonic mucosa. While treatment with B. bifidum S17 only had a marginal effect on weight loss, no difference was observed in the macroscopic parameters. However, a significant reduction in histology scores and the levels of pro-inflammatory cytokines interleukin 1beta (IL-1beta), interleukin 6 (IL-6), keratinocyte-derived chemokine (KC) and the inflammatory markers cyclooxigenase 2 (Cox-2) and myeloperoxidase (MPO) was observed. These results indicate that treatment with B. bifidum S17 is able to partially inhibit the strong Th1-driven intestinal inflammation induced in our model of colitis.},

   abstract = {OBJECTIVES: Our work is aimed at identifying ex vivo new transcription factors, potentially involved in the pathogenesis of pediatric inflammatory bowel disease (IBD), by using a microarray approach. PATIENTS AND METHODS: Microarray, including 84 transcription factors, was performed in inflamed and uninflamed mucosal tissues of pediatric patients with Crohn disease (CD) and in healthy controls. Real-time polymerase chain reaction was used to confirm microarray results on a larger size of CD and patients with ulcerative colitis (UC). Protein expression was evaluated by Western blot assay. RESULTS: Microarray assay showed 40 genes differentially regulated in the inflamed mucosa and 17 in the uninflamed mucosa of patients with CD as compared with controls. Real-time polymerase chain reaction analysis revealed 10 transcripts in CD and 4 in UC, selected among those with higher differences as compared with healthy controls, significantly overexpressed in the inflamed tissues of patients. Moreover, 4 transcripts in CD and 2 in UC were found significantly upregulated in the uninvolved tissue. A further investigation evidenced an increased protein expression of activating transcription factor 3 and hypoxia-inducible transcription factor-1alpha in patients with CD as well as in Caco2 cell line stimulated by cytokines and hypoxia. CONCLUSIONS: The present study shows an evident upregulation of several transcription factors in the inflamed and uninflamed mucosa of children with IBD, suggesting that the inflammatory process is somehow activated at molecular levels even in the macroscopically normal mucosa of patients. A differential pattern of gene expression between CD and UC indicates distinct molecular mechanisms underlying the pathogenesis of 2 diseases. Finally, activating transcription factor 3 and hypoxia-inducible transcription factor-1alpha are proposed as new transcription factors potentially involved in the onset and maintenance of IBD.},

Clinical trial registers list over 150 randomized controlled trials (RCTs) involving PUFAs, only one in a low-income setting (the Gambia). We summarize those results here. There was evidence for improved growth and nutritional status, but the primary end point of chronic environmental enteropathy showed no benefit, possibly because the infants were still substantially breastfed. In high-income settings, there have been RCTs with fatty acids (usually LCPUFAs) in relation to 18 disease end points, for some of which there have been numerous trials (asthma, inflammatory bowel disease and rheumatoid arthritis). For these diseases, the evidence is judged reasonable for risk reduction for childhood asthma (but not in adults), as yielding possible benefit in Crohn's disease (insufficient evidence in ulcerative colitis) and for convincing evidence for rheumatoid arthritis at sufficient dose levels, though formal meta-analyses are not yet available. This analysis suggests that fatty acid interventions could yield immune benefits in children in poor settings, especially in non-breastfed children and in relation to inflammatory conditions such as persistent enteropathy. Benefits might include improved responses to enteric vaccines, which frequently perform poorly in low-income settings, and these questions merit randomized trials.},

   abstract = {BACKGROUND AND AIMS: Crohn's Disease (CD) and ulcerative colitis (UC) are inflammatory bowel diseases (IBD), which may result in nutrition problems that impact on patient health, nutritional status and quality of life. Subjective reports of how IBD patients experience these problems as part of their disease process, including comparisons between patient groups, or the need for tailored nutrition advice as perceived by these patients, have not been widely studied. This survey aimed to identify and explore nutritional problems that are important to CD and UC patients and to investigate their views on the IBD health services provided to help them with these. METHODS: Eighty-seven IBD patients were invited to take part in a nutrition survey using face-to-face questionnaire interviews. The survey asked about food and nutrition problems that patients have experienced, identifying which were most significant and the extent to which they had been addressed by the clinical service. RESULTS: Seventy-two IBD patients completed the evaluation (47 CD, 25 UC). Of these, 45 (62.5%) felt that food and nutrition were either 'important' or 'extremely important' in their experience of IBD, and 59 (82%) reported problems with food and nutrition. Patients with CD and UC reported similar frequencies of most nutritional problems. However, 44 (94%) CD vs. 16 (64%) UC patients reported problems with weight (p=0.002). Less than half of patients had seen a dietitian for tailored nutritional advice to address these problems. CONCLUSIONS: Nutritional problems experienced and reported by IBD patients are numerous and varied. They are considered important by patients with CD and UC, both of whom would generally value specific dietary counselling, highlighting a need for further research in this area and adequate and equal provision of services for both groups.},

   abstract = {BACKGROUND: There are only a few studies on immune response to routine vaccinations in children with inflammatory bowel disease (IBD), despite a strong need for this kind of study. The aim of the study was to evaluate the immunogenicity of an inactivated hepatitis A vaccine (HAV) in IBD pediatric patients compared with healthy controls. METHODS: This was an open, prospective, and controlled study on anti-HAV-negative children and adolescents age 2-18 years with IBD. HAV using 720 enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay (ELISA) units were administered at 0 months and at 6-12 months. Seroconversion and geometric mean titers were measured after each vaccine dose. The evidence of local and systemic adverse effects for 3 days after the first and second dose of vaccine was registered. RESULTS: A total of 134 subjects (66 patients and 68 controls) completed the whole study course consisting of two doses of vaccine and six serum samples. There was no significant difference in the rate of seroconversion between IBD patients and controls when measured after the second dose of vaccine (97% versus 100%, P = 0.2407), but the rate was significantly lower in the IBD group when measured after the first dose (39% versus 64%, P = 0.00001). The mean geometric titers were statistically significantly lower in the IBD group than in the control group at all of the measured timepoints. There were no serious adverse events related to HAV during the study. CONCLUSIONS: HAV is both immunogenic and safe in pediatric patients with IBD.},

   abstract = {The essential micronutrient zinc has long been known to be a functional component of diverse structural proteins and enzymes. More recently, important roles for free or loosely bound intracellular zinc as a signaling factor have been reported. Insufficient zinc intake was shown to exacerbate symptoms in mouse models of inflammation such as experimental colitis, while zinc supplementation was found to improve intestinal barrier function. Herein, we provide evidence that intracellular zinc is essential for maintaining intestinal epithelial integrity when cells are exposed to the inflammatory cytokine Tumor Necrosis Factor (TNF)alpha. Using the human intestinal Caco-2/TC7 cell line as an in vitro model, we demonstrate that depletion of intracellular zinc affects TNFalpha-triggered signaling by shifting intestinal cell fate from survival to death. The mechanism underlying this effect was investigated. We show that TNFalpha promotes a zinc-dependent survival pathway that includes modulation of gene expression of transcription factors and signaling proteins. We have identified multiple regulatory steps regulated by zinc availability which include the induction of cellular Inhibitor of APoptosis (cIAP2) mRNA, possibly through activation of Nuclear Factor-Kappa B (NF-kappaB), as both nuclear translocation of the p65 subunit of NF-kappaB and up-regulation of cIAP2 mRNA were impaired following zinc depletion. Moreover, X-linked inhibitor of apoptosis protein level was profoundly reduced by zinc depletion. Our results provide a possible molecular explanation for the clinical observation that zinc supplements ameliorate Crohn's disease symptoms and decrease intestinal permeability in experimental colitis.},

   abstract = {BACKGROUND: Infliximab is effective treatment for Crohn's disease and has been associated with rare, but serious infectious complications. Emerging data suggest a benefit of infliximab in preventing postoperative Crohn's disease recurrence. It is not known whether administration of infliximab shortly after resective surgery for Crohn's disease increases postoperative complications. AIMS: To evaluate the risk of developing postoperative complications among Crohn's disease patients receiving infliximab within 4 weeks of intestinal resection. METHODS: As part of a randomized placebo-controlled infliximab postoperative prevention study, adverse events were prospectively monitored. Crohn's disease patients undergoing intestinal resection were randomized to placebo or infliximab 2-4 weeks after surgery. Study infusions were administered at 0, 2, and 6 weeks then every 8 weeks for 1 year. To evaluate whether infliximab increased postoperative complications, we analyzed all adverse events for 1 year after surgery. RESULTS: Twenty-four patients were randomized to infliximab or placebo after intestinal resection for Crohn's disease. Mean time to first postoperative infusion was 20 days (range 14-25 days). Over the course of 1 year, there were 22 total adverse events, but no difference between infliximab and placebo patients (12 versus 10, respectively, P = 1.0). In the immediate postoperative period, within 8 weeks of surgery, the number of adverse events was also similar between the two groups (3 infliximab and 5 placebo patients, P = 0.68). There were no serious adverse events and no complications related to wound healing or infection. CONCLUSIONS: Initiation of infliximab within 4 weeks of intestinal resection was not associated with postoperative complications.},

   abstract = {BACKGROUND: Crohn's disease clinical trials utilize the Crohn's Disease Activity Index (CDAI) to measure primary endpoint assessments of clinical recurrence and remission. We evaluated the extent of agreement between clinical recurrence/remission as defined by the CDAI and endoscopic recurrence 1 year after intestinal resection for Crohn's disease (CD). METHODS: Twenty-four CD patients who had been randomly assigned to a postoperative clinical trial had 1 year clinical, endoscopic, and histological assessment for disease recurrence. The primary endpoint was the extent of agreement between endoscopic recurrence and clinical recurrence 1 year after intestinal resection for CD. Secondary endpoints were extent of agreement between endoscopic recurrence and the surrogate markers of CD activity, i.e., histological activity, sedimentation rate, and C-reactive protein (CRP). RESULTS: Twelve of the 24 patients (50%) were in endoscopic remission (i0, i1) and 12 (50%) had endoscopic recurrence (i2, i3, or i4). There was good agreement between endoscopy and histological activity scores (intraclass correlation coefficient = 0.53, kappa coefficient = 0.58). In contrast, there was little to no relationship between endoscopy and CDAI scores; median CDAI scores for endoscopy scores of i0/i1, i2, i3, and i4 were 118, 76, 156, and 78, respectively (P for trend = 0.88). The kappa coefficient (of agreement) between endoscopy score +/- 2 and CDAI score +/- 150 was 0.12 (exact P = 0.68), indicating poor agreement. Similarly, there was no consistent association observed between endoscopy scores and mean CRP and ESR values at week 54. CONCLUSIONS: The CDAI shows poor agreement with endoscopic recurrence 1 year after intestinal resection. Endoscopic recurrence should be the primary endpoint of future postoperative studies and ileocolonoscopy the gold standard test to detect postoperative recurrence.},

   abstract = {BACKGROUND: Thiopurines are considered first-line immunomodulators for the prevention of relapse in moderate to severe pediatric Crohn's disease (CD). Early introduction of thiopurines was shown in a pediatric trial to maintain steroid-free remission in 90% of patients for 18 months. In the present study we analyzed the tolerance and efficacy of azathioprine (AZA) to maintain remission in a homogenous single-center observational cohort of children with CD. METHODS: In all, 105 pediatric CD patients (male/female 68/37) were retrospectively evaluated for the efficacy of AZA (doses 1.4-4 mg/kg) to maintain remission at 6, 12, 18, and 24 months of follow-up. Overall, 93 children were included with active disease (pediatric Crohn's disease activity index [PCDAI] >30), steroid/enteral-nutrition dependency, or postileocecal resection. Remission was defined as PCDAI </=10 without steroids. Patients requiring antitumor necrosis factor (TNF) medication, other immunomodulators, or surgery were considered to experience a relapse. RESULTS: Based on PCDAI, steroid-free remission was achieved in 56/93 (60.2%), 37/93 (39.8%), 31/93 (33.3%), and 29/93 (31.2%) at visits month (M)6, M12, M18, and M24, respectively. Within the first 4 weeks, AZA was stopped in 10/93 patients due to adverse reactions (pancreatitis, nausea, vomiting, skin reactions, general weakness), or not introduced due to low thiopurine methyl transferase (TPMT) activity (n = 3). No neutropenia occurred in patients with normal TPMT activity. Three infectious episodes were documented requiring temporary AZA suspension. CONCLUSIONS: AZA is efficacious in maintaining remission in pediatric CD patients, but to a lesser extent than previously suggested. The majority of patients who are in steroid-free remission at 12 months remained in prolonged remission. Overall tolerance of AZA was excellent.},

   abstract = {OBJECTIVE: To investigate the effects of adalimumab on the induction of complete endoscopic healing and normalization of mucosal cytokine gene expression in patients with active Crohn's disease. MATERIAL AND METHODS: A prospective, single-center study including 77 patients. All were examined by endoscopy before initiation of adalimumab induction therapy with a minimum of six adalimumab injections. Patients were treated until documentation of complete endoscopic healing. Biopsies for measurements of mRNA expression levels of interleukin(IL)-17A (IL17A), IL23, interferon-gamma (IFNG), tumor necrosis factor-alpha (TNF), IL10 and Forkhead Box P3 (FOXP3), as well as for immunohistochemistry (IHC) were sampled at pre- and post-treatment endoscopy, and from 17 control patients. RESULTS: Complete endoscopic healing was achieved in 27.3% after 10 weeks of treatment, documented by endoscopy at week 12. Cumulative endoscopic healing after 52 weeks was 44.2%. Complete endoscopic healing led to a significant reduction in mRNA expression levels for all cytokines except IL10. Elevated expression of TNF and IL-17A persisted in 52% and 76%, respectively, of patients with complete endoscopic remission. Pre-treatment cytokine gene expression levels did not predict response to adalimumab therapy. CONCLUSIONS: Adalimumab induces accumulated complete endoscopic healing in 44% of patients after 52 weeks of therapy. Normalization of mucosal gene expression of cytokines does not occur in all patients with endoscopy-verified healed mucosa. Inclusion of normalized mucosal cytokine expression into the concept of mucosal healing could have an impact on long-term clinical outcome.},

   abstract = {Ulcerative colitis and Crohn's disease are relapsing and remitting chronic disorders. So far, endoscopy is the gold standard for their diagnosis, but less invasive diagnostic biomarkers are needed. Many authors have developed techniques to individuate biomarkers such as genetic testing factor or proteins in biological samples such as serum, plasma, and cellular subpopulations. A protein fingerprint pattern, patient-unique, specific for the diagnosis of inflammatory bowel disease (IBD) and potentially able to predict the future patterns of disease and to help in diagnosis, treatment, and prognosis is of increasing interest among researchers. Nowadays, a proteomic approach may be used in the identification of major alterations of proteins in IBD, but there is still a lack in the identification of a panel of biomarkers among a significant number of patients in large clinical trials. In this review, we analyze and report the current knowledge in proteomic application and strategies in the study of IBD.},

   abstract = {BACKGROUND: Interleukin 13 (IL-13) is upregulated in ulcerative colitis (UC) and increases colon epithelial permeability by inducing apoptosis and expression of the pore-forming tight junction protein claudin-2. IL-13 induces activation of signal transducer and activator of transcription 6 (STAT6). However, the STAT6 phosphorylation status in patients with UC is unknown, as is the effect of STAT6 inhibition on colonic epithelium exposed to IL-13. The study aims were to determine if mucosal STAT6 phosphorylation is increased in patients with UC, and if STAT6 inhibition attenuates IL-13-induced colon epithelial cell dysfunction. METHODS: Immunohistochemical staining for phosphorylated (p) STAT6 was performed on colonic tissue from newly diagnosed pediatric subjects with UC (early UC) or Crohn's disease (CD), colectomy tissue from adults with UC (advanced UC), and controls. Colon HT-29 and T84 cells were transfected with STAT6 small interfering RNA (siRNA), or treated with suberoylanilide hydroxamic acid (SAHA), a histone deacetylase inhibitor that inhibits STAT6, prior to IL-13 treatment. RESULTS: The median score for epithelial pSTAT6 was 0 in control subjects, 2 in early UC (versus control P = 0.019), 4 in advanced UC (P = 0.003), and 0 in CD (P = 0.4). Cell transfection with STAT6 siRNA prevented IL-13-induced apoptosis and claudin-2 expression. SAHA inhibited IL-13-induced STAT6 phosphorylation, apoptosis, and claudin-2 expression, and mitigated IL-13-induced reductions in transepithelial resistance. CONCLUSIONS: UC is associated with increased colonic epithelial STAT6 phosphorylation, and STAT6 inhibition prevents IL-13-induced apoptosis and barrier disruption. These data identify STAT6 as a novel target for UC treatment and support further study of SAHA as a therapeutic agent.},

   abstract = {BACKGROUND: Nutritional therapy has an established role as induction therapy in paediatric Crohn's disease. However, compliance is the main difficulty and may be greatly influenced by the administration route. AIM: To analyse the efficiency of exclusive nutrition to induce remission in children with Crohn's disease comparing fractionated oral vs. continuous enteral feeding. METHODS: The medical records of 106 patients treated by exclusive nutritional therapy [Modulen IBD (R)] by either oral or continuous enteral route were reviewed retrospectively. Comparative analyses of remission rates, changes in anthropometry, Paediatric Crohn's disease Activity Index (PCDAI), laboratory indices and compliance rates were performed. RESULTS: On exclusive enteral nutrition, at 8 weeks, 34/45 patients achieved remission in the oral group (75% on intention-to-treat analysis) and 52/61 (85%) in the enteral nutrition group (P = 0.157). All patients showed a significant decrease in disease severity assessed by PCDAI (P < 0.0001) and significant improvements in anthropometric measures and inflammatory indices. No difference was observed whether Modulen IBD was administered orally or by continuous enteral feeding, apart from weight gain, which was greater in the enteral group (P = 0.041). In a subgroup of patients, mucosal healing was evidenced on follow-up endoscopies showing a clear correlation to remission. Compliance rates (87% and 90%) were similar. Nevertheless, noncompliant patients had lower mucosal healing and remission rates. CONCLUSIONS: These retrospective data suggest that the use of fractionated oral nutritional therapy might be as efficacious as continuous enteral administration to induce remission and mucosal healing in children with Crohn's disease. However, appropriate prospective clinical trials are needed to confirm these findings.},

   abstract = {Ulcerative colitis (UC) and Crohn disease (CD), collectively referred to as inflammatory bowel disease (IBD), are chronic inflammatory disorders that can affect the gastrointestinal tract of children and adults. Like other autoimmune processes, the cause(s) of these disorders remain unknown but likely involves some interplay between genetic vulnerability and environmental factors. Children, in particular with UC or CD, can present to their primary care providers with similar symptoms, including abdominal pain, diarrhea, weight loss, and bloody stool. Although UC and CD are more predominant in adults, epidemiologic studies have demonstrated that a significant percentage of these patients were diagnosed during childhood. The chronic nature of the inflammatory process observed in these children and the waxing and waning nature of their clinical symptoms can be especially disruptive to their physical, social, and academic development. As such, physicians caring for children must consider these diseases when evaluating patients with compatible symptoms. Recent research efforts have made available a variety of more specific and effective pharmacologic agents and improved endoscopic and radiologic assessment tools to assist clinicians in the diagnosis and interval assessment of their patients with IBD; however, as the level of complexity of these interventions has increased, so too has the need for practitioners to become familiar with a wider array of treatments and the risks and benefits of particular diagnostic testing. Nonetheless, in most cases, and especially when frequent visits to subspecialty referral centers are not geographically feasible, primary care providers can be active participants in the management of their pediatric patients with IBD. The goal of this article is to educate and assist pediatricians and adult gastroenterology physicians caring for children with IBD, and in doing so, help to develop more collaborative care plans between primary care and subspecialty providers.},

Prevalence is 35 to 100/100,000 people in USA, 1% of them are infants. UC develops in a genetically predisposed individual with altered intestinal immune response. An eight-month-old girl presented with loose bloody stool, growth failure, and moderate pallor. The girl was diagnosed as a case of UC by colonoscopy and biopsy. Treatment was thereafter started with immunosuppressive drugs. After initial induction therapy with parenteral steroid and infliximab, the patient is now on remission with azathioprine and mesalamine. UC is rare in Bangladesh, especially in children, and it is rarer during infancy. Several conditions like infective colitis, allergic colitis, Meckel's diverticulitis, Crohn's disease, etc. may mimic the features of UC. So, if a child presents with recurrent bloody diarrhea, UC should be considered as differential diagnosis.},

   abstract = {BACKGROUND: Adalimumab is efficacious therapy for adults with Crohn's disease (CD). AIM: To summarise the United Kingdom and Republic of Ireland paediatric adalimumab experience. METHODS: British Society of Paediatric Gastroenterology, Hepatology and Nutrition (BSPGHAN) members with Inflammatory Bowel Disease (IBD) patients <18 years old commencing adalimumab with at least 4 weeks follow-up. Patient demographics and details of treatment were then collected. Response and remission was assessed using the Paediatric Crohn's Disease Activity Index (PCDAI)/Physicians Global Assessment (PGA). RESULTS: Seventy-two patients [70 CD, 1 ulcerative colitis (UC), 1 IBD unclassified (IBDU)] from 19 paediatric-centres received adalimumab at a median age of 14.8 (IQR 3.1, range 6.1-17.8) years; 66/70 CD (94%) had previously received infliximab. A dose of 80 mg then 40 mg was used for induction in 41(59%) and 40 mg fortnightly for maintenance in 61 (90%). Remission rates were 24%, 58% and 41% at 1, 6 and 12 months, respectively. Overall 43 (61%) went into remission at some point, with 24 (35%) requiring escalation of therapy. Remission rates were higher in those on concomitant immunosuppression cf. those not on immunosuppression [34/46 (74%) vs. 9/24 (37%), respectively, (chi(2) 8.8, P=0.003)]. There were 15 adverse events (21%) including four (6%) serious adverse events with two sepsis related deaths in patients who were also on immunosuppression and home parenteral nutrition (3% mortality rate). CONCLUSIONS: Adalimumab is useful in treatment of refractory paediatric patients with a remission rate of 61%. This treatment benefit should be balanced against side effects, including in this study a 3% mortality rate.},

Recognition of this entity is highly relevant to avoid malnutrition-related morbidity and mortality. The main clinical consequence of PEI is fat maldigestion and malabsorption, resulting in steatorrhoea. Pancreatic exocrine function should be assessed by measuring levels of faecal elastase-1. Pancreatic enzyme replacement therapy is the mainstay of treatment for PEI. Administration of enzymes in form of enteric-coated minimicrospheres avoids acid-mediated lipase inactivation and ensures gastric emptying of enzymes in parallel with nutrients. In adults, the initial recommended dose of pancreatic enzymes is 25.000 units of lipase per meal, titrating up to a maximum of 80000 units of lipase per meal. Large meals require 25.000 - 80.000 units of lipase per meal while snacks require 10.000 - 40.000 units of lipase per meal. Oral pancreatic enzymes should be taken with meals to ensure adequate mixing with the chyme. Adjunct therapy with acid-suppressing agents may be useful in patients who continue to experience symptoms of PEI despite high-dose enzyme therapy. Patients with PEI should be encouraged to consume small, frequent meals and to abstain from alcohol. Dietary fat restriction is not recommended for patients with PEI.},

The aim of this study was to describe the clinical pattern in children and adolescents with CD seen at King Abdulaziz University Hospital (KAUH), Jeddah, Saudi Arabia. DESIGN AND SETTING: Retrospective hospital-based study conducted on data collected for the period between January 2001 and March 2010. PATIENTS AND METHODS: Data for all children and adolescents diagnosed at KAUH with CD in the period were retrieved and analyzed. RESULTS: Ninety-six patients were identified. The median age at diagnosis was 11.3 years (range, 0.12-17.6 years). Fifty (52.1%) were males. Sixty-four (66.7%) were Saudis. Nine (9.4%) had a first degree relative with inflammatory bowel disease. The most common presenting symptoms were diarrhea (88.5%), weight loss (84.2%) and anorexia (80.2%). At least one extraintestinal manifestation occurred in 24% of patients. Forty-two percent were underweight and 19% had short stature. The most common distribution was ileocolonic (37.5%), followed by colonic in 31.2%. Twenty-five (26%) patients had perianal disease, 13 (13.5%) had strictures and 15 (15.6%) had penetrating disease. Laboratory investigations revealed anemia in 84.4%, thrombocytosis in 50%, hypoalbuminemia in 64.6%, elevated erythrocyte sedimentation rate (ESR) in 50% and elevated C-reactive protein in 58.3%. Induction of remission was achieved with enteral nutrition in 20% of patients and with corticosteroids in the remaining. CONCLUSIONS: The clinical pattern of CD in children from the Western Province of Saudi Arabia was found to be similar to reports from the West. Pediatricians should be aware of the varying presentations of CD. Early referral to specialized centers is crucial.},

   abstract = {The current paradigm of inflammatory bowel diseases (IBD), both Crohn's disease (CD) and ulcerative colitis (UC), involves the interaction between environmental factors in the intestinal lumen and inappropriate host immune responses in genetically predisposed individuals. The intestinal mucosal barrier has evolved to maintain a delicate balance between absorbing essential nutrients while preventing the entry and responding to harmful contents. In IBD, disruptions of essential elements of the intestinal barrier lead to permeability defects. These barrier defects exacerbate the underlying immune system, subsequently resulting in tissue damage. The epithelial phenotype in active IBD is very similar in CD and UC. It is characterized by increased secretion of chloride and water, leading to diarrhea, increased permeability via both the transcellular and paracellular routes, and increased apoptosis of epithelial cells. The main cytokine that seems to drive these changes is tumor necrosis factor alpha in CD, whereas interleukin (IL)-13 may be more important in UC. Therapeutic restoration of the mucosal barrier would provide protection and prevent antigenic overload due to intestinal "leakiness." Here we give an overview of the key players of the intestinal mucosal barrier and review the current literature from studies in humans and human systems on mechanisms underlying mucosal barrier dysfunction in IBD.},

   abstract = {BACKGROUND: Ileal involvement in Crohn's disease (CD) is associated with NOD2 mutations and granulocyte-macrophage colony stimulating factor autoantibodies (GM-CSF Ab), and GM-CSF blockade promotes ileitis in Nod2/Card15-deficient (C15KO) mice. RALDH2-expressing dendritic cells (DC) and IL-4 promote CCR9 imprinting and small bowel homing of T lymphocytes, in conjunction with CCL25 expression by ileal epithelial cells (IEC). We hypothesized that GM-CSF neutralization promotes ileal disease by modulating expression of CCL25 by IEC and CCR9 by T lymphocytes via Nod2-dependent and independent pathways. METHODS: CCL25 and CCR9 expression were determined in pediatric CD patients stratified by GM-CSF Ab. Ileitis was induced in C15KO mice via GM-CSF Ab administration followed by nonsteroidal antiinflammatory drug (NSAID) exposure, and expression of CCL25, CCR9, FOXP3, intracellular cytokines, and RALDH2 was determined in IEC and immune cell populations. RESULTS: The frequency of CCL25(+) IEC and CCR9(+) T lymphocytes was increased in CD patients with elevated GM-CSF Ab. In the murine model, GM-CSF blockade alone induced IEC CCL25 expression, and reduced the frequency of mesenteric lymph node (MLN) CD4(+) FOXP3(+) cells, while Card15 deficiency alone enhanced MLN DC RALDH2 expression. Both GM-CSF neutralization and Card15 deficiency were required for downregulation of MLN DC IL-10 expression; under these conditions NSAID exposure led to an expansion of IL-4(+) and IL-17(+) CCR9(+) lymphocytes in the ileum. CONCLUSIONS: GM-CSF prevents ileal expansion of CCR9(+) lymphocytes via Nod2-dependent and independent pathways. CCR9 blockade may be beneficial in CD patients with elevated GM-CSF Ab.},

   abstract = {OBJECTIVES: Variations in chronic illness care are common in our health care system and may lead to suboptimal outcomes. Specifically, inconsistent use and suboptimal medication dosing have been demonstrated in the care of patients with inflammatory bowel disease (IBD). Quality improvement (QI) efforts have improved outcomes in conditions such as asthma and diabetes mellitus, but have not been well studied in IBD. We hypothesized that QI efforts would lead to improved outcomes in our pediatric IBD population. METHODS: A QI team was formed within our IBD center in 2005. By 2007, we began prospectively capturing physician global assessment (PGA) and patient-reported global assessment. Significant QI interventions included creating evidence-based medication guidelines, joining a national QI collaborative, initiation of preclinic planning, and monitoring serum 25-hydroxyvitamin D. RESULTS: From 2007 to 2010, 505 patients have been followed at our IBD center. During this time, the frequency of patients in clinical remission increased from 59% to 76% (P < 0.05), the frequency of patients who report that their global assessment is >7 increased from 69% to 80% (P < 0.05), and the frequency of patients with a Short Pediatric Crohn's Disease Activity Index (sPCDAI) <15 increased from 60% to 77% (P < 0.05). The frequency of repeat steroid use decreased from 17% to 10% (P < 0.05). We observed an association between the use of a vitamin D supplement (P = 0.02), serum 25-hydroxyvitamin D (P < 0.05), and quiescent disease activity. CONCLUSIONS: Our results show that significant improvements in patient outcomes are associated with QI efforts that do not rely on new medication or therapies.},

   abstract = {INTRODUCTION: Children with inflammatory bowel disease (IBD) frequently present with small bowel involvement at some stage of their disease. Hence, reliable assessment of the entire small bowel is required in order to adjust treatment accordingly. Recently, magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) of the small bowel in combination with luminal contrast agent delivered via a naso-jejunal tube (MR enteroclysis) is an emerging technique demonstrating good results in adult patients. However, data on its use and benefits in children is limited. AIMS: In this study we report our experience on performing small bowel MR enteroclysis (MRE) in children with IBD. Specifically, we reviewed indications, MR findings, advantages and disadvantages of the technique in a tertiary unit. METHODS: A total of 34 MRE studies (29 paediatric IBD patients) were retrospectively analysed. All patients underwent upper and lower endoscopy under general anaesthetic (GA) the day before MR imaging was performed. Nasojejunal (NJ)-tube was placed during endoscopy. RESULTS: Frequently detected findings included small and large bowel wall thickening, small bowel strictures and intestinal lymph node enlargement. Importantly, in all our clinical cases, MRE results were key to making a clinical decision in the given scenario regardless of whether MRE findings were positive or negative. CONCLUSIONS: Within our setup, MR enteroclysis is a well-tolerated, sensitive technique for small bowel imaging, providing detailed information at crucial clinical decision points. Moreover, accurate information then allows appropriate clinical decisions to be made.},

   abstract = {BACKGROUND: Children with inflammatory bowel disease (IBD) undergo imaging using ionizing radiation and may be exposed to high cumulative radiation. We hypothesized that children with IBD have high exposure to radiation from medical imaging. METHODS: An Institutional Review Board (IRB)-approved retrospective chart review from 2002-2008 was performed on all patients with IBD. Radiographic studies performed were recorded and exposure for each study was estimated. RESULTS: A total of 117 children with IBD (86 Crohn's disease [CD], 31 ulcerative colitis [UC]) were evaluated. The median current exposure was 15.1 mSv in CD and 7.2 mSv in UC (P = 0.005). Computed tomography (CT) scan and small bowel follow-through (SBFT) were responsible for 43% and 36% of all radiation exposures, respectively. The rate of radiation was higher in CD compared to UC (4.3 versus 2.2 mSv/yr). In CD, the rate of exposure was highest in the first 3 years of diagnosis (8.2 mSv/yr), and no different between the 3-5 year follow-up and 5+ year follow-up groups (3.8 versus 4.3 mSv/yr). Using the annual dose rate in those followed for more than 3 years, an estimated 47 out of 78 (60%) children (40 CD, 7 UC) would exceed 50 mSv by 35 years of age. CONCLUSIONS: Radiation exposure from medical imaging is high in a subset of children diagnosed with IBD. Estimation of radiation exposure at age 35 suggests a significant portion of children with IBD will have high radiation exposure in their lifetime. Nonionizing imaging such as magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) and ultrasound should be offered to children with IBD as an alternative to current imaging that employs radiation.},

   abstract = {BACKGROUND AND OBJECTIVE: Children with Crohn disease (CD) often undergo cross-sectional imaging during clinical evaluation. Magnetic resonance enterography (MRE) is becoming the preferred radiologic assessment due to the lack of radiation exposure; however, there are few data in children with CD comparing MRE with objective disease measures. The aim of the present study was to compare MRE with endoscopy, histopathology, and laboratory evaluation in children with CD. METHODS: We performed an institutional review board-approved query of our prospective CD MRE database, which includes data in children with CD undergoing MRE since 2008. RESULTS: A total of 147 MRE studies were performed in 119 different children with symptomatic CD. Of those, 53 (39.6%) MRE studies were performed at diagnosis to evaluate small bowel disease burden. A total of 117 (79.6%) MRE studies displayed active and/or chronic disease, whereas 30 (20.4%) MRE studies were normal. When compared with normal MRE studies, active inflammation on MRE was associated with a higher mean C-reactive protein (3.6 vs 1.1, P < 0.001), higher erythrocyte sedimentation rate (36 vs 22, P = 0.0.31), higher platelet value (439 vs 352, P = 0.033), and lower albumin (3.4 vs 3.7, P = 0.049). Comparison between MRE and endoscopy demonstrated excellent agreement when ulcers were present, and moderate agreement with histopathology. CONCLUSIONS: Active inflammation on MRE is associated with higher C-reactive protein, erythrocyte sedimentation rate, platelets, and lower albumin in children with CD. MRE displays excellent agreement with endoscopic disease described by ulcers but poor agreement with mild mucosal disease described by erythema and friability. The present study adds to a growing body of evidence that MRE provides excellent assessment of inflammation and measures disease activity in CD.},

   abstract = {Growth failure is common in paediatric disorders associated with inflammation and nutritional deficiency. Examples are Crohn's disease (CD), juvenile idiopathic arthritis (JIA) and cystic fibrosis. Several factors contribute to the abnormal growth, notably excess pro-inflammatory cytokine production and nutritional deficiency, both of which can disturb the GH-IGF- I axis. Typically, growth hormone (GH) secretion is normal, whereas IGF-I production is compromised. Against this background of a disturbed IGF system, glucorticoid therapy, particularly in JIA, and to some extent in CD is frequently initiated to suppress inflammation and provide symptomatic relief. The availability of GH therapy and its efficacy in non-GH- deficient disorders has led to a number of trials in children with glucocorticoid-dependent diseases. In JIA, GH in pharmacological dosages of 0.066 and 0.047 mg/kg/day was effective in preventing the rapid decrease in height SDS values in the acute phase of the disease and in increasing adult height after long-term therapy respectively. In CD, fewer children are steroid-dependent because of widespread use of enteral nutrition, non-steroidal immunosuppressive agents and anti-tumour necrosis factor therapy. However, two trials of GH, using similar doses to those above, have demonstrated anabolic effects with increase in height velocity, bone mineral density and fat free mass compared to untreated controls. Collaboration between paediatric endocrinologists and other subspecialists will improve the opportunity for successful GH therapy. Treatment should be initiated before or during early puberty.},

   abstract = {BACKGROUND/OBJECTIVES: A significant proportion of Crohn's disease (CD) patients receiving infliximab (IFX) maintenance therapy show loss of responsiveness despite a good initial response. The factors other than immunomodulators that prevent IFX dose escalation have yet to be fully elucidated. This study was performed to identify clinical factors or concomitant therapies associated with sustained response to IFX. SUBJECTS/METHODS: Seventy-four consecutive CD patients who had successful IFX induction therapy between 2002 and 2010 underwent IFX maintenance therapy. Patients showing loss of response to IFX were treated with IFX intensification therapy. Factors involved in the sustained response to IFX were investigated retrospectively. RESULTS: After a median follow-up of 85 weeks, loss of response to IFX was observed in 30 (40.5%) cases. On logistic regression analysis, concomitant use of enteral nutrition (EN) therapy (elemental and/or polymeric formulas) was identified as an independent factor associated with sustained response to IFX. Receiver operating characteristic curve analysis indicated a cutoff value of 600 kcal/day. We divided the patients into the 'EN group' (>/= 600 kcal/day) and 'control group' (<600 kcal/day). The cumulative number of loss of response was significantly lower in the EN group (odds ratio: 0.23, P = 0.0043). Kaplan-Meier analysis confirmed the significantly lower rate of loss of response in the EN group (P = 0.013). Multivariate hazard ratio was 0.37 (P = 0.025). Type of EN formula did not affect the results. CONCLUSIONS: Concomitant use of EN >/= 600 kcal/day is likely to yield a sustained response to IFX in CD patients.},

   abstract = {OBJECTIVES: Low bone mineral density (BMD) is recognized as a potential problem in children with inflammatory bowel disease (IBD). We aimed to describe the longitudinal development of BMD in a population of Swedish pediatric patients with IBD. METHODS: A total of 144 patients with IBD (93 males; 83 with ulcerative colitis [UC], 45 with Crohn disease [CD]) were examined with dual-energy x-ray absorptiometry at baseline. At follow-up 2 years later, 126 of the initial 144 patients were reexamined. BMD values are expressed as z scores. RESULTS: Children with UC and CD had significantly lower mean BMD z scores for the lumbar spine (LS) at baseline and after 2 years. The reduction in BMD was equally pronounced in patients with UC and CD, and neither group improved their z score during the follow-up period. Furthermore, significantly lower mean BMD z scores for the LS were found at baseline in boys (-1.1 SD, +/-2.7 SD, P < 0.001), but not in girls (-0.0 SD, +/-3.0 SD). This finding remained unchanged at follow-up. Subanalyses of the different age groups at baseline showed the lowest BMD values in the group of patients ages 17 to 19 years in boys (mean z score for the LS 1.59 SD, +/-3.1 SD) and in girls (mean z score for the LS -3.40 SD, +/-3.1 SD); however, at follow-up, these patients had improved their BMD significantly (mean change z score for the LS 1.00 SD, 95% CI 0.40-1.60; 1.90 SD, 95% CI 0.60-3.20). CONCLUSIONS: In this longitudinal study, the entire group of pediatric patients with IBD showed permanent decreases in their BMD z scores for the LS; however, our data indicate that afflicted children have the potential to improve their BMD by the time they reach early adulthood.},

   abstract = {Many foods have been implicated in theories about the etiology of inflammatory bowel disease. While evidence has accumulated that nutritional factors as part of overall lifestyle changes may play a role in the growing incidence, no specific dietary recommendations except the promotion of breastfeeding can currently be given to decrease the risk of developing Crohn's disease or ulcerative colitis. For the treatment of Crohn's disease in children and adolescents, however, enteral feeding with a semi-elemental diet seems to be as effective as corticosteroids in inducing and maintaining remission. In the meta-analyses, advantages of one formula over the other are evened out, and more research is warranted into the anti-inflammatory properties of different nutrients, such as polyunsaturated fatty acids, butyrate, glutamine, and cytokines, such as transforming growth factors-beta. Unfortunately, for practical reasons, nutritional therapy remains underutilized, even though pediatric patients are most vulnerable to the harmful effects of nutrient deficiencies on growth, pubertal development, and bone health. There is hope that in the future the new field of nutrigenomics may enable physicians to more accurately tailor a specific diet to the patient genotype.},

Clinical conditions are reviewed where vitamin D may play a role in the prevention of infections or where it may be used as primary or adjuvant treatment for viral, bacterial and fungal infections. Several conditions such as tuberculosis, psoriasis, eczema, Crohn's disease, chest infections, wound infections, influenza, urinary tract infections, eye infections and wound healing may benefit from adequate circulating 25(OH)D as substrate. Clinical diseases are presented in which optimization of 25(OH)D levels may benefit or cause harm according to present day knowledge. The safety of using larger doses of vitamin D in various clinical settings is discussed.},

   abstract = {AIM: To evaluate prospectively the clinical efficacy and safety of endoscopic hydrostatic balloon dilation in a consecutive cohort of symptomatic intestinal Crohn's disease strictures. METHODS: Between September 2003 and December 2008 we performed endoscopic balloon dilations in 37 Crohn's disease patients with 39 intestinal symptomatic strictures (4 naive and 35 postoperative). Dilations were performed using a Rigiflex through-the-scope balloon. Clinical success rate was claimed if a patient remained asymptomatic and did not require surgery or further endoscopic dilation, following technical success. Actuarial curves of clinical, endoscopic (redilation) and surgical recurrence were obtained by Kaplan-Meier method. Demographic and disease variables were related to the main outcomes. RESULTS: After a mean follow-up of 26.3 months (range, 2-61 months), the long-term global benefit rate was 89% (33/37). The 1-2-3 years cumulative symptom-free rates were respectively: 76%, 55% and 46%. Four patients were operated upon. Technical success predicts a lower rate of surgery. There were no complications related to the endoscopic procedures. CONCLUSIONS: Endoscopic balloon dilation of symptomatic Crohn's disease strictures may achieve clinical benefit in many patients and is a valid alternative to surgery in the management of the disease. Dilation may be repeated in recurrent intestinal obstructions and appears safe without morbidity.},

Food nutrients were believed to play a certain role in the causation of the disease, in conjunction with genetic, immunologic, environmental and other factors (especially intestinal microbiota). Various nutrients were found to be involved, sometimes with controversial results, possibly pertaining to geographic regions. Nutrition has to be especially considered in children as disease itself and/or the medication can severely impair normal growth and development, sometimes with permanent long-term sequels. We reviewed the data on the possible roles of diet in preventing the disease and relapses. We emphasize the crucial importance of enteral nutrition in inducing and maintaining the remission of Crohn's disease, according to the existing consensuses (benefits, indications, routes of administration, types of formula, duration, results). We also present data on parenteral nutrition in pediatric IBD, with current updates from literature.},

The nature of these inputs is complex, with each having distinct and overlapping contributions to ulcerative colitis and Crohn's disease. Identification of specific genetic risk factors has improved the understanding of specific pathways to disease, but the primacy of environmental or lifestyle factors linked to changes in the gut microbiota, particularly in early life, is increasingly evident. Clarification of the molecular basis of host-microbe interactions in health and in susceptible individuals promises novel therapeutic strategies.},

   abstract = {Pediatric inflammatory bowel disease encompasses a spectrum of disease phenotype, severity, and responsiveness to treatment. Intestinal healing rather than merely symptom control is an especially important therapeutic goal in young patients, given the potential for growth impairment as a direct effect of persistent chronic inflammation and the long life ahead, during which other disease complications may occur. Corticosteroids achieve rapid symptom control, but alternate steroid-sparing strategies with greater potential to heal the intestine must be rapidly adopted. Exclusive enteral nutrition is an alternate short-term treatment in pediatric Crohn's disease. The results of multi-center pediatric clinical trials of both infliximab and adalimumab in Crohn's disease and of infliximab in ulcerative colitis (all in children with unsatisfactory responses to other therapies) have now been reported and guide treatment regimens in clinical practice. Optimal patient selection and timing of anti-TNF therapy requires clinical judgment. Attention must be paid to sustaining responsiveness safely.},

   abstract = {BACKGROUND: Intestinal microbiota contributes to the pathogenesis of Crohn's disease. Elemental diet and total parenteral nutrition are effective therapies for Crohn's disease; however, changes of microbiota as a result of both treatments have not been fully elucidated. AIM: To elucidate changes of faecal microbiota in Crohn's disease patients treated with elemental diet and total parenteral nutrition. METHODS: Stool samples were collected from 33 active Crohn's disease patients and 17 healthy subjects, and recollected after elemental diet (8 patients) and total parenteral nutrition (9 patients). Terminal restriction fragment length polymorphism analysis of bacterial 16srDNA was performed to evaluate the whole microbiota. Specific quantitative PCR was then used to determine populations of predominant bacterial groups. RESULTS: In Crohn's disease patients, the number of terminal restriction fragments, which reflects bacterial species, was significantly lower. Populations of total bacteria and Bifidobacterium were significantly lower and the ratio of Enterococcus was higher. The number of terminal restriction fragments was significantly decreased after total parenteral nutrition, but not after elemental diet. Population of Bacteroides fragilis significantly decreased after elemental diet, while population of Enterococcus significantly increased after total parenteral nutrition. CONCLUSION: Faecal microbiota in Crohn's disease patients was markedly different from healthy subjects. Species diversity was reduced by total parenteral nutrition, but not by elemental diet.},

   abstract = {BACKGROUND AND OBJECTIVE: Radiation exposure increases cancer risk in children with Crohn disease (CD). Magnetic resonance enterography (MRE) can image the gastrointestinal tract without exposure to radiation. The aim of the present study was to determine whether our MRE protocol could diagnose terminal ileitis and the degree of inflammatory activity in children with CD. METHODS: Retrospective review of patients 18 years of age or younger who underwent MRE for known or suspected CD from June 15, 2007 to April 1, 2010. MRE was performed with Volumen and water as oral contrast and gadolinium-based intravenous contrast. No antiperistaltic agent was used. Each MRE was compared with ileal biopsies obtained within 90 days. Severity of inflammation on MRE was scored and compared with the Pediatric Crohn Disease Activity Index (PCDAI). RESULTS: Seventy-two patients underwent 80 MREs during the study period. Forty-two of the 72 patients (58.3%) underwent colonoscopy within 90 days of MRE, and the terminal ileum was intubated in 33. Compared with histology, MRE had a sensitivity of 71.4% and a specificity of 100% for terminal ileitis. The positive and negative predictive values were 100% and 70%, respectively. PCDAI was calculated in 39 of the 72 patients (54.2%) and had a statistically significant positive correlation with MRE score of 0.37 (P = 0.020426). CONCLUSIONS: In children with known or suspected CD, our MRE protocol has a high specificity and positive predictive value for terminal ileitis. Severity of inflammation on MRE had a statistically significant positive correlation with PCDAI.},

   abstract = {PURPOSE: Percutaneous endoscopic gastrostomy (PEG) or percutaneous endoscopic jejunostomy (PEJ) are substantial for patients with swallowing disorders to maintain enteral nutrition or to decompress palliatively intractable small bowel obstruction. Endoscopic placement can be impossible due to previous (gastric) operation, obesity, hepato-splenomegaly, peritoneal carcinosis, inadequate transillumination, or obstructed passage. Computed tomography (CT)-fluoroscopic guidance with or without endoscopy can enable placement of CT-PG/CT-PJ or CT-PEG/CT-PEJ if endoscopically guided placement fails. In this retrospective study, we will evaluate the feasibility and safety of this method. METHODS: A total of 101 consecutive patients were referred to our department for feeding support (n = 87) or decompression (n = 14). Reasons were: ENT tumor (n = 51), esophageal cancer (n = 19), mediastinal mass (n = 2), neurological disorder (n = 15). Decompression tubes were placed because of cancer (n = 13) or Crohn's disease (n = 1). The following approaches were chosen: CT fluoroscopy and simultaneous gastroscopy (n = 61), inflation of the stomach via nasogastric tube (n = 29), and direct puncture under CT-fluoroscopic guidance (n = 11). RESULTS: CT fluoroscopy-guided gastrostomy was feasible in 89 of 101 patients. No procedure-related mortality was observed. One tube was misplaced into the colon in a patient with a history of gastrectomy. No complication was seen after removal. Minor complications: dislodgement (n = 17), peristomal leakage (n = 7), wound infection (n = 1), superficial skin infection (n = 6), tube obstruction (n = 2). CONCLUSIONS: CT fluoroscopy-guided PG/PJ or PEG/PEJ is feasible and safe and provides adequate feeding support or decompression. It offers the benefits of minimally invasive therapy even in patients with contraindications to established endoscopic methods, combining the advantages of both techniques. Long-term complications-mainly tube-related problems-are easily treated.},

   abstract = {BACKGROUND & AIMS: Matrix metalloproteases (MMPs) mediate pathogenesis of chronic intestinal inflammation. We characterized the role of the gelatinase (GelE), a metalloprotease from Enterococcus faecalis, in the development of colitis in mice. METHODS: Germ-free, interleukin-10-deficient (IL-10(-/-)) mice were monoassociated with the colitogenic E faecalis strain OG1RF and isogenic, GelE-mutant strains. Barrier function was determined by measuring E-cadherin expression, transepithelial electrical resistance (TER), and translocation of permeability markers in colonic epithelial cells and colon segments from IL-10(-/-) and TNF(DeltaARE/Wt) mice. GelE specificity was shown with the MMP inhibitor marimastat. RESULTS: Histologic analysis (score 0-4) of E faecalis monoassociated IL-10(-/-) mice revealed a significant reduction in colonic tissue inflammation in the absence of bacteria-derived GelE. We identified cleavage sites for GelE in the sequence of recombinant mouse E-cadherin, indicating that it might be degraded by GelE. Experiments with Ussing chambers and purified GelE revealed the loss of barrier function and extracellular E-cadherin in mice susceptible to intestinal inflammation (IL-10(-/-) and TNF(DeltaARE/Wt) mice) before inflammation developed. Colonic epithelial cells had reduced TER and increased translocation of permeability markers after stimulation with GelE from OG1RF or strains of E faecalis isolated from patients with Crohn's disease and ulcerative colitis. CONCLUSIONS: The metalloprotease GelE, produced by commensal strains of E faecalis, contributes to development of chronic intestinal inflammation in mice that are susceptible to intestinal inflammation (IL-10(-/-) and TNF(DeltaARE/Wt) mice) by impairing epithelial barrier integrity.},

   abstract = {BACKGROUND: The use of exclusive enteral nutrition (EEN) in children with Crohn disease has not been universally adopted by North American paediatric gastroenterologists. This is in stark contrast to their European counterparts. The present study aimed to define attitudes and practice patterns of EEN use by members of the North American Society for Paediatric Gastroenterology, Hepatology, and Nutrition. METHODS: Members were contacted by e-mail and provided with access to a Web-based survey. RESULTS: Surveys were completed by 326 of 1162 (30.7%) eligible North American Society for Paediatric Gastroenterology, Hepatology, and Nutrition members from North America (86% United States, 14% Canada). Thirty-one percent of respondents reported never using EEN, 55% reported sparse use, and 12% reported regular use. Physicians in Canada reported significantly more use than those in United States (P < 0.001). Currently working and previously working in a centre where EEN was used were highly correlated with both the perceived appropriateness of EEN and the regularity of its use (P < 0.01). More American physicians than Canadian physicians reported that concurrent medical therapy was necessary to induce remission (P < 0.001). Canadian respondents were more likely to use maintenance therapy than American respondents (P = 0.02). Compliance issues were seen as the main disadvantages of EEN and as the major barrier to increased use by nonregular users. CONCLUSIONS: There are significant variations in the patterns of use and the acceptance of EEN between Canada and the United States, with Canadian physicians showing a greater use of EEN. The use of EEN appears influenced by the extent to which physicians are exposed to its use both in their training and in their current practice setting.},

   abstract = {Diseases of the gallbladder are common and costly. The best epidemiological screening method to accurately determine point prevalence of gallstone disease is ultrasonography. Many risk factors for cholesterol gallstone formation are not modifiable such as ethnic background, increasing age, female gender and family history or genetics. Conversely, the modifiable risks for cholesterol gallstones are obesity, rapid weight loss and a sedentary lifestyle. The rising epidemic of obesity and the metabolic syndrome predicts an escalation of cholesterol gallstone frequency. Risk factors for biliary sludge include pregnancy, drugs like ceftiaxone, octreotide and thiazide diuretics, and total parenteral nutrition or fasting. Diseases like cirrhosis, chronic hemolysis and ileal Crohn's disease are risk factors for black pigment stones. Gallstone disease in childhood, once considered rare, has become increasingly recognized with similar risk factors as those in adults, particularly obesity. Gallbladder cancer is uncommon in developed countries. In the U.S., it accounts for only ~ 5,000 cases per year. Elsewhere, high incidence rates occur in North and South American Indians. Other than ethnicity and female gender, additional risk factors for gallbladder cancer include cholelithiasis, advancing age, chronic inflammatory conditions affecting the gallbladder, congenital biliary abnormalities, and diagnostic confusion over gallbladder polyps.},

   abstract = {Disease recurrence following resective surgery for Crohn disease remains a challenging clinical problem, and more studies are needed to better define risk stratification and treatment recommendations in the postoperative setting. Endoscopy remains the gold standard for the assessment of postoperative disease recurrence, and all Crohn disease patients who undergo surgery should undergo ileocolonoscopy within 6 to 12 months of surgery. The degree of endoscopic recurrence in the neoterminal ileum during this procedure provides prognostic information regarding the severity of the future disease course. WCE, MRE, and SICUS are all promising noninvasive modalities to assess for postoperative Crohn disease activity. However, further studies are needed to better define scoring systems, operating characteristics and variability, and prognostic data for each of these modalities. In patients at risk for early disease recurrence, more aggressive prophylactic therapy should be considered, in hopes of delivering true "top-down" therapy that may offer maximum impact in altering the natural history of Crohn disease.},

   abstract = {OBJECTIVE: The aim of this study was to assess whether power Doppler ultrasound (PDU) can serve as a reliable replacement for endoscopy in follow-up assessment of disease activity in children with Crohn disease. METHODS: Nineteen children (13 boys), median age 14.8 (5.4-15.8) years, with macroscopically diagnosed Crohn disease were included in the study. Clinical parameters, histological evaluation, and graded PDU assessments were undertaken in all patients at diagnosis and following their initial treatment. Discriminant analysis was used to build predictive models from the PDU data for the histological evaluation. RESULTS: The median Pediatric Crohn's Disease Activity Index (PCDAI) was 31.5 (15.5-42.0) at diagnosis. All clinical and ultrasonographic parameters and the histological evaluation showed an improvement between pre- versus posttreatment results; 1-way analysis of variance showed a significant difference because of treatment (P < 0.005) for all variables apart from the superior mesenteric artery flow (SMA); paired sample t tests indicated that these differences were statistically significant (P < 0.001), with the exception of SMA (P = 0.178). There was a statistically significant correlation (P < 0.001) between the platelet count and the bowel wall stratification (STRAT). Significant correlation was also observed between the histology findings and the mean mucosal, transmural, and segmental flow (MFL) and STRAT and between platelets and both MFL and small bowel thickening (SBT) (P < 0.01 in all cases). There was a statistically significant correlation (P < 0.05) between C-reactive protein and MFL and between histology and SBT, MFL, and STRAT. Discriminant analysis using discriminating factors SBT, STRAT, and MFL could assign 84.6% of cases to the correct classification of "no/mild inflammation" or "medium/severe inflammation." CONCLUSIONS: Results obtained using power Doppler ultrasonography and endoscopy showed statistically significant correlations. Power Doppler sonography, in the hands of an experienced examiner, can be used for follow-up assessment of disease activity in children with Crohn disease.},

   abstract = {OBJECTIVE: Exclusive enteral nutrition (EEN) is a first-line treatment in children with active Crohn's disease (CD) but is seldom used in adults with active disease. The mode of action of EEN in suppressing mucosal inflammation is not fully understood, but modulation of intestinal microflora activity is one possible explanation. The aim of this study was to investigate the effect of 6-week EEN in children with active CD, with special reference to intestinal microflora function. MATERIALS AND METHODS: Fecal samples from 18 children (11 boys, 7 girls; median age 13.5 years) with active CD (13 children with small bowel/colonic and 5 with perianal disease) were analyzed for short chain fatty acid (SCFA) pattern as marker of gut microflora function. The children were studied before and after EEN treatment. Results from 12 healthy teenagers were used for comparison. RESULTS: Eleven (79%) of the children with small bowel/colonic CD responded clinically positively to EEN treatment showing decreased levels of pro-inflammatory acetic acid as well as increased concentrations of anti-inflammatory butyric acids and also of valeric acids, similar to the levels in healthy age-matched children. In children with active perianal CD, however, EEN had no positive effect on clinical status or inflammatory parameters. CONCLUSIONS: The authors present new data supporting the hypothesis that the well-documented anti-inflammatory effect of EEN in children with active small bowel/colonic CD is brought about by modulation of gut microflora activity, resulting in an anti-inflammatory SCFA pattern. By contrast, none of the children with perianal disease showed clinical or biochemical improvement after EEN treatment.},

   abstract = {Primary duodenal localization of Crohn's disease (CD) is rare. Medical therapy can control symptoms, but surgery is required when progressive obstructive symptoms occur. Surgical options include bypass, resection, or strictureplasty, but it is still not clear which should be the treatment of choice. Reviewing the medical records of 1253 patients undergoing surgery for CD between January 1986 and December 2011 at the Digestive Surgery Unit of the Department of Clinical Physiopathology of the University of Florence, 10 patients (6 males and 4 females) underwent operations for duodenal CD. Four patients had only a duodenal localization, 6 patients had synchronous involvement of other intestinal tracts. Strictures were distributed in all the duodenal portions: in 7 patients there were single lesions, in 3 patients there were multiple lesions. Eight patients were treated with strictureplasty: 5 with the Heineke-Mikulicz technique, 2 with Jaboulay, and 1 with a pedunculated jejunal patch. Two patients were treated with resection: one with a B2 gastro-duodenal resection, and 1 with a duodenal-jejunal resection and an end to side duodeno-jejunal anastomosis. Follow up of the patients was from 2 to 18 years. No recurrence of duodenal CD was observed in the 2 patients treated with resection, while 2 of the 8 patients treated with strictureplasty had a recurrence. In our experience, strictureplasty is indicated when less than 2 strictures are present in the 2nd or 3rd duodenal portion. In cases with multiple strictures localized in the 1st or the distal duodenal portion, resection is preferable.},

   abstract = {BACKGROUND: Serum antibodies, including ASCA, anti-OmpC, and ANCA, correlate with disease location and predict disease phenotype in inflammatory bowel disease. AIM: The objective of this study was to determine relationships between serum antibody status and anthropometric data for children with newly diagnosed Crohn's disease. METHODS: A retrospective review was conducted on children diagnosed with Crohn's disease at our institution from 2003 to 2008. Patients who had ASCA IgA, ASCA IgG, anti-OmpC, and pANCA antibodies, and anthropometric data measured before diagnosis and therapy were included. Z-scores for height and weight were compared among groups according to the presence of specific antibodies. Spearman's rank correlation was used to assess association between antibodies and growth data. RESULTS: One hundred and two patients, mean age 11.9 years, met the inclusion criteria. Patients with the presence of any of the four antibodies had lower mean height and weight z-scores than patients without any antibodies present. When individual antibodies were studied, patients with positive ASCA titers had lower mean weight and height z-scores than patients without any antibodies present. Spearman's rank correlation coefficient demonstrated a significant association between increasing ASCA titers and lower weight z-scores, but not lower height z-scores. CONCLUSIONS: Pediatric patients with newly diagnosed Crohn's disease and the presence of ASCA antibodies have lower mean height and weight z-scores. This study provides evidence that specific subsets of children with Crohn's disease may be at greater risk of growth impairment.},

We aimed to formulate guidelines for managing UC in children based on a systematic review (SR) of the literature and a robust consensus process. The present article is a product of a joint effort of the European Crohn's and Colitis Organization (ECCO) and the European Society for Paediatric Gastroenterology, Hepatology, and Nutrition (ESPGHAN). METHODS: A group of 27 experts in pediatric IBD participated in an iterative consensus process including 2 face-to-face meetings, following an open call to ESPGHAN and ECCO members. A list of 23 predefined questions were addressed by working subgroups based on a SR of the literature. RESULTS: A total of 40 formal recommendations and 68 practice points were endorsed with a consensus rate of at least 89% regarding initial evaluation, how to monitor disease activity, the role of endoscopic evaluation, medical and surgical therapy, timing and choice of each medication, the role of combined therapy, and when to stop medications. A management flowchart, based on the Pediatric Ulcerative Colitis Activity Index (PUCAI), is presented. CONCLUSIONS: These guidelines provide clinically useful points to guide the management of UC in children. Taken together, the recommendations offer a standardized protocol that allows effective, timely management and monitoring of the disease course, while acknowledging that each patient is unique.},

   abstract = {BACKGROUND: There has not been an extensive comparison of CRP and ESR in ulcerative colitis (UC), and thus, we aimed to explore their utility in UC. METHODS: Four previously enrolled cohorts of 451 children with UC were utilized, all including laboratory, clinical and endoscopic data. A longitudinal analysis was performed on prospectively collected data of 75 children. Disease activity was captured by both global assessment and pediatric UC activity index (PUCAI). RESULTS: The best thresholds to differentiate quiescent, mild, moderate and severe disease activity, were <23, 23-29, 30-37, >37 mm/h for ESR, and <2.5, 2.5-5, 5.01-9, >9 mg/L for CRP (area under the ROC curves 0.70-0.81). Correlation of endoscopic appearance with CRP and ESR were 0.55 and 0.41, respectively (P<0.001). Both CRP and ESR may be completely normal in 34% and 5-10% of those with mild and moderate-severe disease activity, respectively. Elevated CRP in the presence of normal ESR or vice versa was noted in 32%, 38%, 30% and 17% of those with quiescent, mild, moderate and severe disease activity. Over time, the utility of CRP and ESR in reflecting disease activity remained stable in 70-80% of cases. CONCLUSION: In ~2/3 of children, both CRP and ESR values reflect disease activity to a similar degree and in the remaining, either CRP or ESR may be sufficient, with slight superiority of CRP. CRP is more closely correlated with endoscopic appearance. When either CRP or ESR performs well for a given patient, this is likely to remain so over time. Therefore, it may not be justified to routinely test both ESR and CRP in monitoring disease activity.},

RESULTS: The recommendations and practice points were eventually endorsed with a consensus rate of at least 95% regarding: definitions, initial evaluation, standard therapy, timing of second-line therapy, the role of endoscopic evaluation and heparin prophylaxis, how to administer second-line medical therapy, how to assess response, surgical considerations, and discharge recommendations. A management flowchart is presented based on daily scoring of the Pediatric Ulcerative Colitis Activity Index (PUCAI), along with 28 formal recommendations and 34 practice points. CONCLUSIONS: These guidelines provide clinically useful points to guide the management of ASC in children. Taken together, the recommendations offer a standardized protocol that allows effective monitoring of disease progress and timely treatment escalation when needed.},

   abstract = {PURPOSE: Patients with Crohn's disease (CD) often need home parenteral nutrition for short bowel syndrome (SBS), as a result of frequent surgery and extended bowel resections. We conducted this study to evaluate the influence of the patient's condition on the occurrence of SBS in CD. METHODS: The subjects of this study were 721 patients, who underwent bowel resections for CD at Hyogo College of Medicine between September 1974 and September 2010. The collective total of bowel resection operations was 1286. The possible risk factors for SBS were analyzed by univariate and multivariate logistic regression analyses to determine their predictive significance. RESULTS: SBS was diagnosed in 24 patients. A stepwise logistic regression model revealed that penetrating type (odds ratio 14.9, p = 0.02), remaining small intestine <200 cm (odds ratio 141.4, p < 0.01), ostomy creation (odds ratio 7.5, p = 0.03), and post-total colectomy (odds ratio 17.6, p < 0.01) were independent risk factors for SBS. CONCLUSION: These results indicate that the length of remaining small bowel is closely related to SBS in patients who have undergone surgery for CD. At least 200 cm of small bowel should be preserved to prevent SBS when total colectomy and ostomy creation are performed for CD.},

Generally surgery for duodenal CD and reconstruction is considered difficult. We reviewed the clinical features of duodenal fistula with CD and considered suitable preoperative treatments. METHODOLOGY: We reviewed the records of 10 patients with duodenal fistula complicating CD between September 1974 and April 2009. RESULTS: Mean age at surgery was 31.5 years (range 22-36). Mean duration from onset of CD or previous surgery was 49.8 months (range 1.5-172.6). All patients were treated with total parenteral nutrition before surgery, 3 patients with steroids and 1 patient with infliximab. Synergistic effects of these immunomodulators were not examined in this study. Although preoperative treatments improved the values of CD activity index (p<0.01) all patients required surgical treatment. Duodenal fistula in all patients resulted from intrinsic CD lesion at the colon or ileum. Although immunmodulators had no additional effects on shortening hospital stay or improving activity index, simple fistula repair was performed in all patients. CONCLUSIONS: Although the additional effects of immunomodulators were not confirmed, the sufficient preoperative treatment for duodenal fistula with CD to reduce disease activity seems likely to facilitate subsequent minimal surgery.},

The aim of the study was to determine the prevalence and predictors of vitamin D deficiency in an IBD cohort. It was hypothesized that vitamin D deficiency is associated with increased disease activity and lower health-related quality of life (HRQOL). METHODS: This was a retrospective cohort study. Harvey-Bradshaw index and ulcerative colitis disease activity index were used to assess disease activity. Short Inflammatory Bowel Disease Questionnaire scores were used to assess HRQOL. Multivariate logistic regression was used to identify independent predictors of vitamin D deficiency and its association with disease activity and HRQOL. RESULTS: The study included 504 IBD patients (403 Crohn's disease [CD] and 101 ulcerative colitis [UC]) who had a mean disease duration of 15.5 years in CD patients and 10.9 years in UC patients; 49.8% were vitamin D deficient, with 10.9% having severe deficiency. Vitamin D deficiency was associated with older age (P = .004) and older age at diagnosis (P = .03). Vitamin D deficiency was associated with lower HRQOL (regression coefficient -2.21, 95% confidence interval [CI], -4.10 to -0.33) in CD but not UC (regression coefficient 0.41, 95% CI, -2.91 to 3.73). Vitamin D deficiency was also associated with increased disease activity in CD (regression coefficient 1.07, 95% CI, 0.43 to 1.71). CONCLUSIONS: Vitamin D deficiency is common in IBD and is independently associated with lower HRQOL and greater disease activity in CD. There is a need for prospective studies to assess this correlation and examine the impact of vitamin D supplementation on disease course.},

We evaluated the nutritional status at the beginning and during Infliximab treatment in patients with Crohn's disease. METHODS: Patients with moderate/severe flares of disease treated with Infliximab for induction and maintenance of remission were included in a prospective observational study. Body Mass Index and Nutritional Risk Index were calculated in each patient at 0, 6 weeks and than every 8 weeks for one year. RESULTS: From 30 patients treated with Infliximab 59.3% had low BMI, 35.7% being undernourished. The severity of Crohn's disease did not correlate with low BMI but did correlate with Nutritional Risk Index (p = 0.001). In all patients that responded to Infliximab treatment progressive weight gain was observed, all but one patient reaching normal BMI after one year. Mean weight gain was significantly more elevated (p = 0.001) and time needed to reach normal BMI was longer in the undernutrition group (p = 0.01). Clinical remission was the principal factor associated with weight gain (p = 0.001), while there was no influence of endoscopic remission on nutritional status. CONCLUSIONS: In patients with moderate/severe forms of Crohn's disease malnutrition is frequently encountered. Induction and maintenance treatment with Infliximab determines weight gain and corrects malnutrition in all patients with clinical remission.},

METHODS: In all, 98 consecutive adult patients (age 25-55 years) with CD (n = 70) and UC (n = 28) were enrolled and assessed at three timepoints over 1 year. RESULTS: There were no significant differences in levels of homocysteine, B vitamins, or dietary intake by disease type, disease activity, or across visits. 13% of all inflammatory bowel disease (IBD) patients had elevated homocysteine at least once during the study. Nine patients with CD had fluctuating homocysteine levels during the study but these were inconsistent, ranging from within normal range to elevated levels in any individual. Six of these nine patients were persistently in remission. 30% of all IBD patients had vitamin B6 deficiency, 11% had vitamin B12 deficiency, and one patient (CD) had folate deficiency. All vitamins showed a significant correlation between intake and serum levels (B6; r = 0.46, P < 0.001, B12; r = 0.42, P < 0.001, and folate; r = 0.26, P = 0.008). There was an inverse relationship between serum homocysteine in the blood and serum vitamin B12 (r = -0.241, P = 0.017). CONCLUSIONS: Serum homocysteine was mostly normal in patients with IBD and changed minimally over time. There was no association between disease activity and elevation of serum homocysteine. 30% of patients have vitamin B6 deficiency but vitamin B6 is not associated with elevated homocysteine. The routine measurement of homocysteine is not warranted.},

   abstract = {BACKGROUND: Teenagers with inflammatory bowel disease undergo regular follow-up visits to watch for symptoms that may indicate relapse. Current disease activity is frequently estimated with the use of the Pediatric Ulcerative Colitis Activity Index (PUCAI) and the Pediatric Crohn's Disease Activity Index (PCDAI). We examined the capacity of fecal calprotectin and C-reactive protein (CRP) to predict relapse in teenagers who report no symptoms. Second, we examined whether calprotectin and CRP as an "add-on test" improve the specificity of PUCAI or PCDAI to predict relapse. METHODS: We collected data of 62 consecutive teenagers (31 with Crohn's disease and 31 with ulcerative colitis) who scored their degree of disease control between 90 and 100% on two successive outpatient clinic visits. Calprotectin, PUCAI or PCDAI, and CRP were measured at baseline. Primary outcome was symptomatic relapse within 3 months of baseline, necessitating the introduction of steroids, exclusive enteral nutrition, or an aminosalicylate dose escalation. RESULTS: Fifteen teenagers (24%) developed symptomatic relapse within 3 months of baseline. Based on the receiver operating characteristic curve, the optimum calprotectin cutpoint to differentiate high from low risk patients was 500 mug/g. The PUCAI or PCDAI predicted relapse in 42% (11/26) of teenagers with a positive result (score >/= 10 points), while a negative PUCAI or PCDAI result reduced the risk of relapse to 11% (4/36). Teenagers with a positive calprotectin test had a 53% (10/19) risk of progressing to symptomatic relapse within 3 months, whereas a negative calprotectin result gave a 12% (5/43) risk of symptomatic relapse. A positive CRP result (cutoff 10 mg/L) gave a 50% (4/8) risk of relapse, whereas a negative CRP result hardly reduced the risk compared with the pretest probability (from 24% to 21% (11/53)). As an add-on test after PUCAI or PCDAI, the calprotectin test limited the number of false positives and thus increased the specificity to detect gastrointestinal inflammation: 60% (9/15) of teenagers with positive concordant test results progressed to symptomatic relapse. Negative concordance reduced the risk of relapse to 10% (3/32). CRP contributed little as add-on test after PUCAI or PCDAI: two of five teenagers with positive concordant tests progressed to symptomatic relapse (40%). CONCLUSIONS: Unlike CRP, fecal calprotectin as an add-on test after PUCAI or PCDAI facilitates recognition of preclinical relapse. This could help to identify teenagers who require treatment intensification at the time of minimal disease rather than at the time of clinically overt relapse. Further studies are warranted to determine the impact of fecal calprotectin testing on treatment management and outcome.},

For each incident case, two controls were randomly selected matched for centre, date of birth, sex, date of recruitment and time of follow-up. Serum of cases and controls obtained at recruitment were analysed for ASCA IgG, ASCA IgA, perinuclear anti-neutrophil cytoplasmic antibody (pANCA), antibodies against Escherichia coli outer membrane porin C (OmpC) and flagellin CBir1. Conditional logistic regression was used to determine risk of CD and UC. Receiver operating characteristic curves were constructed to test accuracy. RESULTS: A total of 77 individuals were diagnosed with CD and 167 with UC after a mean follow-up of 4.5 (SD 3.2) and 4.4 (SD 3.1) years following blood collection, respectively. Combinations of pANCA, ASCA, anti-CBir1 and anti-OmpC were most accurate in predicting incident CD and UC (area under curve 0.679 and 0.657, respectively). The predictive value of the combination of markers increased when time to diagnosis of CD or UC decreased. CONCLUSION: A panel of serological markers is able to predict development of CD and UC in individuals from a low-risk population.},

   abstract = {OBJECTIVES: The objective of the present qualitative study was to develop the items and support the content validity for the Pediatric Quality of Life Inventory (PedsQL) Gastrointestinal Symptoms Module for pediatric patients with functional gastrointestinal (GI) disorders and organic GI diseases, hereafter referred to as GI disorders. METHODS: The iterative process included multiphase qualitative methods. A literature review of GI disorders was conducted to generate domains for the focus interviews. Six pediatric gastroenterologists with extensive clinical experience in GI disorders provided expert opinion regarding the conceptual framework. A total of 98 participants, 46 pediatric patients ages 5 to 18, and 52 parents of patients ages 2 to 18 with physician-diagnosed GI disorders (chronic constipation, functional abdominal pain, irritable bowel syndrome, inflammatory bowel disease [Crohn disease, ulcerative colitis], gastroesophageal reflux disease), participated in the focus interviews and cognitive interviewing phases, including think-aloud and cognitive debriefing protocols. RESULTS: Eleven domains were derived from the qualitative methods involving patient and parent interviews and expert opinion, with content saturation achieved, resulting in 76 items. The 11 domains consisted of items measuring stomach pain, stomach upset, food and drink limits, trouble swallowing, heartburn and reflux, gas and bloating, constipation, diarrhea, worry, medicines, and communication. CONCLUSIONS: Qualitative methods involving pediatric patients and their parents in the item generation process support the content validity for the new PedsQL Gastrointestinal Symptoms Module. The PedsQL Gastrointestinal Symptoms Module is undergoing national multisite field testing as the next iterative phase.},

   abstract = {Combined immunosuppression by immunomodulators and biological therapy has become standard in the medical management of moderate-to-severe inflammatory bowel disease (IBD) because of clearly demonstrated efficacy. Clinical studies, registries, and case reports warn of the increased risk of infections, particularly opportunistic infections; however, already in the steroid monotherapy era, patients are at risk because it is accepted that a patient should be considered immunosuppressed when receiving a daily dose of 20 mg of prednisone for 2 weeks. Prescriptions increasingly involve azathioprine, methotrexate, and various biological agents. The TREAT registry evaluated safety in >6000 adult patients, half of them treated with infliximab (IFX) for about 1.9 years. IFX-treated patients had an increased risk of infections and this was associated with disease severity and concomitant prednisone use. The REACH study, evaluating the efficacy of IFX in children with moderate-to-severe Crohn disease, refractory to immunomodulatory treatment, reports serious infections as the major adverse events and their frequency is higher with shorter treatment intervals. The combination of immunosuppressive medications is a risk factor for opportunistic infections. Exhaustive guidelines on prophylaxis, diagnosis, and management of opportunistic infections in adult patients with IBD have been published by a European Crohn's and Colitis Organization working group, including clear evidence-based statements. We have reviewed the literature on infections in pediatric IBD as well as the European Crohn's and Colitis Organization guidelines to present a commentary on infection prophylaxis for the pediatric age group.},

   abstract = {PURPOSE OF REVIEW: This review evaluates the role of the growth hormone (GH) and insulin-like growth factor (IGF) in influencing linear growth in pediatric Crohn's disease. It also examines the current evidence concerning the use of recombinant human growth hormone (rhGH) as a potential therapy in achieving optimal growth and inducing mucosal healing for pediatric Crohn's disease. RECENT FINDINGS: Current treatment strategies for Crohn's disease including antitumor necrosis factor-alpha (TNF-alpha) therapy have been demonstrated to improve growth velocity, but linear growth deficits persist despite optimization of therapy. By complex mechanisms, including the reduction of levels of IGF-1 and induction of systemic and hepatic GH resistance, cytokines such as TNF-alpha and interleukin-6 (IL-6), commonly elevated in active Crohn's disease, are important as mediators of linear growth delay. Recent evidence suggests that rhGH therapy is effective in improving short-term linear growth for a selected group of patients but of limited benefit as a therapy for improving mucosal disease and reducing clinical disease activity. SUMMARY: Crohn's disease interacts with the GH-IGF-1 axis in important ways. Recent studies evaluating rhGH use in pediatric Crohn's disease have demonstrated some efficacy in reversing persistent linear growth delay but limited benefits in terms of improving mucosal disease and clinical disease activity. Larger studies of adequate power are needed to confirm a true benefit in terms of growth, to examine a potential benefit with regard to modification of disease activity, and to evaluate long-term risks.},

   abstract = {Interleukin (IL)-10 has important effects in immunoregulation and inflammation, and previous studies have provided evidence for the involvement of IL-10 in the pathogenesis of Crohn's disease (CD). In this study, we investigated whether genetic variants of the IL-10 gene were associated with CD in a New Zealand population. Three single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) in the promoter region of IL-10 (rs1800871, rs1800872, and rs1800896) and a flanking SNP, rs3024505, were genotyped in a well-characterized New Zealand dataset consisting of 342 CD cases and 610 controls. Furthermore, we measured serum IL-10 levels in a number of the CD patients and controls and examined whether a relationship existed between these polymorphisms and serum IL-10 levels. We demonstrated an association with CD for SNPs rs3024505 and rs1800896, and phenotypic analysis indicated an association of rs3024505 with an early age at first diagnosis, stricturing CD behavior, and requirement for bowel resection. We also observed that IL-10 concentration was significantly higher in CD patients than in the controls and that the T allele of rs1800896, the A allele of rs1800871, and the T allele of rs1800872 were associated with increased serum IL-10 levels.},

   abstract = {In patients with Crohn's Disease (CD), malnutrition is frequently observed and is an important complication, frequently associated with nutritional deficiencies, especially vitamins (both water- and fat-soluble) and essential trace elements. It is often a result of the disease activity, poor oral intake and/or restrictive diets. Nutrition plays an important role in disease management and helps to maintain remission in CD patients. Deficiencies occur in patients with active Crohn's disease, and also in those in remission. Specific supplementation of vitamins and micro- and macronutrients might be helpful or even necessary in this group of patients. This review outlines the most frequent nutritional deficiencies and their complications in relation to the Crohn's Disease Activity Index, and provides an overview of therapeutic perspectives for CD patients in adult patients with inflammatory bowel disease (IBD). Biological therapy, which is being used with increasing frequency, seems not only to mitigate the inflammatory process in the gastrointestinal tract, but also has significant impact on the nutritional status of patients with Crohn's disease.},

   abstract = {BACKGROUND AND AIM: Exclusive enteral nutrition (EEN) is an effective method of treatment in achieving remission in inflammatory bowel disease (IBD); however, its mechanism of action is still poorly understood. The objective of our study was to assess the influence of EEN on serum vascular endothelial growth factor (VEGF) and transforming growth factor-beta 1 (TGF-beta1) in children and adolescents with IBD. PATIENTS AND METHODS: Thirty-nine children and adolescents with IBD (24 with Crohn disease [CD] and 15 with ulcerative colitis [UC]) and 25 healthy controls were enrolled in the study. VEGF and TGF-beta1 were assessed at the baseline and after 2 and 4 weeks of EEN in CD and UC groups and once in controls using enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay immunoassays. RESULTS: At the baseline, we found increased serum VEGF in the CD versus UC group and controls (P < 0.05) and serum TGF-beta1 in the UC versus CD group and controls (P < 0.05). During EEN, VEGF decreased in the UC and CD groups, whereas TGF-beta1 increased in the CD group and decreased in the UC group. The CD group achieved disease remission faster than the UC group, and the weight gain of patients with CD during EEN was higher compared with patients with UC. Additionally, TGF-beta1 concentration correlated with protein and energies daily intake in the CD group (R = 0.95; P < 0.05). CONCLUSIONS: Different effectiveness of EEN in achieving remission in CD and UC may result from a modification of growth factor production. EEN stimulated TGF-beta1 production in CD but not in UC, which possibly resulted in higher effectiveness of EEN in this group of patients.},

This study aimed to ascertain the protocols currently utilized in different pediatric centers around the world and to highlight their similarities and differences. METHODS: A questionnaire was circulated to individuals at pediatric centers in countries in Europe, North America and Asia-Pacific. Respondents were asked to indicate the number of children treated with EEN at their centers in the previous years and to provide details of their protocol used for administering EEN to these children. RESULTS: Responses were received from 35 separate centers (42% of those asked). The duration of EEN varied from <6 weeks to >12 weeks, but was most commonly 6 to 8 weeks. Although 23 different formulas were utilized across the centers, most (90%) used polymeric formulas. Flavourings were commonly added to formulas but wide variations existed between centers with the prescription of food and fluids permitted during the EEN period. The reintroduction of food after EEN also varied greatly: the most common recommendations were for an initial low-fiber diet (26%) or the gradual introduction of food quantity as the formula volume decreased (52%). CONCLUSIONS: This questionnaire-based study has shown the wide variations in EEN protocols used in different areas of the world. The development of consistent protocols may enhance the acceptance, efficacy and wider utilization of this therapy.},

   abstract = {BACKGROUND: Research in the treatment of Crohn's disease (CD) supports anti-inflammatory benefits of n-3 fatty acids from fish oil, prebiotics, and antioxidants. A nutritionally balanced inflammatory bowel disease nutrition formula (IBDNF) enriched with these compounds has the potential to improve nutrition status and disease activity in CD. METHODS: This is an open-label pilot study investigating the effects of IBDNF on nutrition status in CD patients. Twenty-eight patients with active CD on stable medication were asked to consume 16 oz of IBDNF/d for 4 months. Nutrition status was assessed with dual-energy X-ray absorptiometry scans and serum micronutrient levels. Disease activity and quality of life were measured using the Crohn's Disease Activity Index (CDAI) and the Inflammatory Bowel Disease Questionnaire (IBDQ). RESULTS: Twenty patients completed the final visit. After 4 months, there was a significant decrease in plasma phospholipid levels of arachidonic acid with increases in eicosapentaenoic acid (EPA) and docosahexaenoic acid. Ten patients had a final EPA concentration of >2%. There was improvement in fat-free and fat mass in patients with final EPA >2% (P = .014 and P = .05). Vitamin D (25-OH) levels improved in all patients (18.5-25.9 ng/mL, P < .001). Those with EPA >2% had significantly lower CDAI (116 +/- 94.5 vs 261.8 +/- 86.5; P = .005) and higher IBDQ (179.1 +/- 26.6 vs 114.6 +/- 35.9, P < .001) compared to those with EPA <2%. CONCLUSIONS: IBDNF has the potential to deposit fat-free and fat mass, improve vitamin D status, and improve quality of life in CD patients.},

   abstract = {Crohn's disease is a chronic inflammatory condition affecting the gastrointestinal tract at any point from the mouth to the rectum. Patients may experience diarrhea, abdominal pain, fever, weight loss, abdominal masses, and anemia. Extraintestinal manifestations of Crohn's disease include osteoporosis, inflammatory arthropathies, scleritis, nephrolithiasis, cholelithiasis, and erythema nodosum. Acute phase reactants, such as C-reactive protein level and erythrocyte sedimentation rate, are often increased with inflammation and may correlate with disease activity. Levels of vitamin B12, folate, albumin, prealbumin, and vitamin D can help assess nutritional status. Colonoscopy with ileoscopy, capsule endoscopy, computed tomography enterography, and small bowel follow-through are often used to diagnose Crohn's disease. Ultrasonography, computed axial tomography, scintigraphy, and magnetic resonance imaging can assess for extraintestinal manifestations or complications (e.g., abscess, perforation). Mesalamine products are often used for the medical management of mild to moderate colonic Crohn's disease. Antibiotics (e.g., metronidazole, fluoroquinolones) are often used for treatment. Patients with moderate to severe Crohn's disease are treated with corticosteroids, azathioprine, 6-mercaptopurine, or anti-tumor necrosis factor agents (e.g., infliximab, adalimumab). Severe disease may require emergent hospitalization and a multidisciplinary approach with a family physician, gastroenterologist, and surgeon.},

   abstract = {BACKGROUND: Methotrexate (MTX) is used as an alternative immunosuppressive treatment for patients with inflammatory bowel disease (IBD). The aim of the study was to evaluate effectiveness and tolerance of MTX for children with IBD. METHODS: A retrospective study was conducted in our pediatric IBD center of all children having received MTX for the treatment of their IBD between 2000 and 2008. Remission was defined as discontinuation of steroids and Harvey-Bradshaw Index <4 for Crohn's disease (CD) patients or Pediatric Ulcerative Colitis Activity Index (PUCAI) <10 for ulcerative (UC) or indeterminate colitis (IC) patients. RESULTS: Seventy-five patients had CD, 5 UC, and 13 IC. Mean age at diagnosis was 11 (0.6-17.4) years. Ninety patients were previously treated with purine analogs and 26 with anti-tumor necrosis factor (TNF). Among patients assessed for effectiveness of MTX (n = 79), clinical remission was observed in 29, 37, 25, and 16% of CD patients (n = 63) and 19, 25, 13, and 7% of patients with UC or IC (n = 16), respectively, 3, 6,12, and 24 months after initiation of MTX. The 1-year remission rate for CD patients was significantly higher in patients with colonic disease. Forty-six patients (49%) experienced side effects but only 13 (14%) had to discontinue treatment. CONCLUSIONS: The long-term remission rate with MTX in our pediatric IBD population was low. However, MTX was generally well tolerated and induced and maintained remission in some patients who previously had failed a purine analog and/or anti-TNF. Prospective controlled trials are indicated to determine the place of MTX in the management of pediatric IBD.},

   abstract = {OBJECTIVES: Genotypic variation in signal transducer and activator of transcription 3 (STAT3) increases risk for inflammatory bowel disease (IBD), and STAT3-dependent inflammatory networks are induced in the colon in these patients. We hypothesized that STAT3 "A" risk allele carriage would be associated with increased cellular STAT3 activation and colon leukocyte recruitment. METHODS: Colonic expression of genes regulating STAT3 signaling and leukocyte recruitment and function was measured in pediatric patients with Crohn disease (CD) stratified by STAT3 genotype. The frequency of colonic pSTAT3* and CXCR2* neutrophils was determined using immunohistochemistry. STAT3 tyrosine phosphorylation (pSTAT3) was measured in circulating leukocytes by flow cytometry, and mechanisms regulating STAT3 activation were tested in IBD Epstein-Barr virus (EBV)-transformed lymphocytes (EBL). RESULTS: Colonic expression of interleukin 6 (IL-6), the STAT3 target gene SOCS3, the neutrophil chemoattractants IL-8, CXCL1, and CXCL3, and the neutrophil products S100A8, S100A9, and S100A12 were increased in patients carrying the STAT3 "A" risk allele. The frequency of neutrophils expressing the cognate receptor for IL-8, CXCR2, was increased in colonic biopsies from patients carrying the risk allele, and the frequency of pSTAT3* or CXCR2* neutrophils correlated with histologic severity. The frequency of CD4 lymphocytes and granulocytes expressing pSTAT3 was increased in patients carrying the STAT3 "A" risk allele. EBLs from patients carrying the STAT3 "A" risk allele exhibited increased basal and IL-6-stimulated STAT3 tyrosine phosphorylation, increased transcription of STAT3 and SOCS3 after IL-6 stimulation, and increased membrane localization of the IL-6 receptor, GP130, and Janus-associated kinase 2. CONCLUSIONS: The STAT3 "A" risk allele is associated with increased cellular STAT3 activation and upregulation of pathways that promote recruitment of CXCR2* neutrophils to the gut.},

Anaemia was defined using WHO standards and iron deficiency defined using published guidelines. RESULTS: 46 children (16 girls) with Crohn's disease and 34 children (18 girls) with UC were studied. 75% of children with IBD were anaemic at diagnosis, 30% were anaemic at follow up two years later. 90% of children with Crohn's and 95% of children with Ulcerative Colitis (UC) were iron deficient at diagnosis. At follow up two years later 70% of children with Crohn's and 65% of children with UC were iron deficient. CONCLUSIONS: Persistent anaemia and iron deficiency are common in childhood IBD, prevalence alters with duration of time from diagnosis.},

   abstract = {BACKGROUND: There has been increasing interest in the use of nutrition risk assessment tools in paediatrics to identify those who need nutrition support. Four non-disease specific screening tools have been developed, although there is a paucity of data on their application in clinical practice and the degree of inter-tool agreement. METHODS: The concurrent validity of four nutrition screening tools [Screening Tool for the Assessment of Malnutrition in Paediatrics (STAMP), Screening Tool for Risk On Nutritional status and Growth (STRONGkids), Paediatric Yorkhill Malnutrition Score (PYMS) and Simple Paediatric Nutrition Risk Score (PNRS)] was examined in 46 children with inflammatory bowel disease. Degree of malnutrition was determined by anthropometry alone using World Health Organization International Classification of Diseases (ICD-10) criteria. RESULTS: There was good agreement between STAMP, STRONGkids and PNRS (kappa > 0.6) but there was only modest agreement between PYMS and the other scores (kappa = 0.3). No children scored low risk with STAMP, STRONGkids or PNRS; however, 23 children scored low risk with PYMS. There was no agreement between the risk tools and the degree of malnutrition based on anthropometric data (kappa < 0.1). Three children had anthropometry consistent with malnutrition and these were all scored high risk. Four children had body mass index SD scores < -2, one of which was scored at low nutrition risk. CONCLUSIONS: The relevance of nutrition screening tools for children with chronic disease is unclear. In addition, there is the potential to under recognise nutritional impairment (and therefore nutritional risk) in children with inflammatory bowel disease.},

   abstract = {BACKGROUND AND AIMS: Increased resting energy expenditure (REE) unmatched by dietary intake is implicated as a cause of poor nutrition in childhood inflammatory conditions. Adequate description of disease activity and correction of REE data for body composition are important to reach reliable conclusions about changes in REE associated with disease. The present study aimed to determine the effect of disease activity measured by clinical status, systemic and stool inflammatory markers on REE in children with Crohn disease using appropriate correction for confounding factors. METHODS: Sixty children with Crohn disease were recruited from the regional paediatric gastroenterology unit and studied on 1 occasion. REE was measured by indirect calorimetry. Fat-free mass (FFM) was estimated by skinfold thickness. Disease activity was measured using systemic (C-reactive protein [CRP], erythrocyte sedimentation rate [ESR]) and faecal markers of inflammation (lactoferrin, calprotectin) and clinical scores (Paediatric Crohn Disease Activity Index). RESULTS: Using a multiple regression model, there was no significant change in REE from active or inactive disease (beta = 0.03, P = 0.7) nor from CRP (beta = -0.05, P = 0.52), ESR (beta = -0.07, P = 0.43), faecal calprotectin (beta = -0.07, P = 0.38), and faecal lactoferrin (beta = 0.01, P = 0.88). REE/kg FFM was not associated with the Paediatric Crohn Disease Activity Index (r = 0.1, P = 0.44), CRP (r = -0.3, P = 0.84) or ESR (r = 0.12, P = 0.4), faecal calprotectin (r = 0.04, P = 0.97), or faecal lactoferrin (r = 0.02, P = 0.87). CONCLUSIONS: REE corrected for physiologically relevant confounders is not associated with degree of disease activity using clinical tools or systemic and local inflammatory markers, and therefore is an unlikely mechanism for poor nutritional state.},

Significant deficits in height and weight in children with Crohn's disease have been reported but changes in fat and fat free mass are less well defined. This study aims to describe the height, weight and body composition of a cohort of children with IBD. METHODS: Height, weight, skinfold thicknesses and bioelectrical impedance analysis was performed. Disease activity was assessed with clinical scoring systems. RESULTS: 55 children, median age 13.7 years (range 6.5-17.7) were studied. Median (25th, 75th percentile) Standard Deviation Score for BMI, Height and Weight were - 0.3 (- 0.97, 0.65), - 0.56 (- 1.42, 0.06), - 0.62 (- 1.43, 0.19). In Crohn's disease, using multiple regression analysis disease activity measured by PCDAI was significantly inversely related to fat free mass (beta - 0.2, 95% CI -0.17, -0.03, p 0.005). CONCLUSIONS: Children with IBD were both under and overweight. Nutritional deficits were more common in Crohn's disease. Fat free mass was related to disease activity in children with Crohn's disease regardless of changes in weight. Weight or BMI may mask deficits in lean tissue in the presence of normal or increased proportions of body fat.},

These genes are associated with inflammatory bowel disease (IBD) in several European studies. A total of 2,049 individuals (656 Crohn's disease [CD], 544 ulcerative colitis [UC], and 849 controls) were genotyped and association studies were performed for 1 single nucleotide polymorphism (SNP) in MAGI2, 1 SNP in PARD3, and 6 SNPs in MYO9B. We reported an association between 3 SNPs in MYO9B and ileal involvement with rs1457092 as the most significant SNP (p = 0.0073, odds ratio [OR] 0.69 [95% confidence interval (95% CI) 0.52-0.90]). The nonsynonymous SNP rs1545620 exhibited a p value of 0.014, OR 0.72 (95% CI 0.55-0.93). MYO9B was not associated with UC. MAGI2 or PARD3 was not associated with IBD. A 6-SNP haplotype block in MYO9B demonstrated association with CD and ileal CD (p = 0.0030 and 0.0065, respectively). These data demonstrate an association of MYO9B with ileal CD; however, there was no association of MAGI2 and PARD3 with IBD. Because the direction of association of MYO9B in this Canadian study was not consistent with European studies, further studies are needed to elucidate the role of MYO9B in IBD.},

INTERVENTION: Either rhGH (0.067 mg/kg per day) as daily subcutaneous injections (rhGH group; n, 11) or no rhGH, (Ctrl; n, 11) for 6 months. MAIN OUTCOME MEASURE: Percentage change in HV after 6 months in the two groups. Auxology, puberty, skeletal age, disease factors, treatment and glucose homeostasis were also assessed. RESULTS: Median HV increased from 4.5 (range, 0.6, 8.9) at baseline to 10.8 (6.1, 15.0) cm/year at 6 month (P = 0.003) in the rhGH group, whereas in the Ctrl group, it was 3.8 (1.4, 6.7) and 3.5 cm/year (2.0, 9.6), respectively (P = 0.58). Median percentage increase in HV after 6 months in the rhGH group was 140% (16.7, 916.7) compared with 17.4% (-42.1%, 97.7%) in the Ctrl group (P < 0.001). There were no significant differences in disease activity and proinflammatory cytokines at baseline and 6 months in both groups and change in bone age for chronological age was also similar in the two groups. In the rhGH group, fasting insulin increased from 4.0 (2.0, 11.0) to 7.0 mU/l (2.0, 16.0) (P = 0.02), whereas in the Ctrl group, it was 3.0 (1.2, 12.7) and 3.8 mU/l (2.1, 7.0) (P = 0.72), respectively. CONCLUSIONS: Although this pilot trial shows that rhGH can improve short-term linear growth in children with CD, the clinical efficacy of this therapy needs to be further studied in longer-term studies of growth, glucose homeostasis and disease status.},

   abstract = {OBJECTIVE: To compare the prognosis between staged surgery and one-stage surgery in active complex Crohn disease(CD). METHODS: Clinical data of 33 patients with active complex CD from February 2006 to September 2010 were analyzed retrospectively. INCLUSION CRITERIA: Patients who were diagnosed with CD by pathology or endoscopy with CD activity index(CDAI)>220 and long history of preoperative steroid use(over 6 months), or complicated with severe preoperative malnutrition. The indications for surgery included enterocutaneous or entero enteric fistula, with/without intra-abdominal abscess, intestinal obstruction, and acute intestinal perforation intra-abdominal sepsis. The surgical procedures, including staged surgery and one-stage definite surgery were chosen by experienced surgeons. All the patients quit smoking and received immunosuppressant therapy (TwHF or azathioprine) together with enteral nutrition supplement for preventing postoperative recurrence. All the patients were followed up after the surgery with regards to CDAI, serum C-reactive protein (CRP), erythrocyte sedimentation rate (ESR). Postoperative complications, clinical and endoscopic recurrence were recorded. RESULTS: Of the 33 patients, 14 underwent one-stage definite surgery and 19 received staged surgery. Postoperative complication rates in the two groups were 71% and 26% respectively(P=0.015). The early clinical recurrence rates within postoperative 3 months were 36% and 0(P=0.008). In regard to cumulative probability of post-operative clinical and endoscopic recurrence, staged surgery group was superior to one stage definite surgery group(P=0.000 and 0.006). CONCLUSION: Staged surgery may significantly increase the success rate of operation, reduce postoperative complications and postoperative early relapse, and decrease postoperative recurrence.},

   abstract = {PURPOSE: The aim of this study was to investigate the long-term effect of enteral nutrition (EN) as a maintenance therapy in Crohn's disease (CD) patients following surgery. METHODS: This study was an extension of our previous study to prolong the duration of intervention and follow-up from 1 to 5 years. Forty consecutive patients who underwent resection for ileal or ileocolic CD were included. Following surgery, 20 patients received continuous elemental diet infusion during the nighttime plus a low-fat diet during the daytime (EN group). Another 20 patients received neither nutritional therapy nor food restriction (control group). All patients were followed for 5 years after operation. No patient received corticosteroid, immunosuppressants, or infliximab except patients who developed recurrence. The end point of this study was recurrence requiring biologic therapy or reoperation. Recurrence rates were analyzed on an intention-to-treat basis. RESULTS: In the EN group, four patients could not continue tube intubation for elemental diet intake. Two patients (10 %) in the EN group and nine patients (45 %) in the control group developed recurrence requiring infliximab therapy (P = 0.03). The cumulative recurrence incidence rate requiring infliximab was significantly lower in the EN group vs the control group (P = 0.02). One patient (5 %) in the EN group and five patients (25 %) in the control group required reoperation for recurrence (P = 0.18). The cumulative incidence of reoperation was lower in the EN group vs the control group, the difference not being significant (P = 0.08). CONCLUSION: The outcomes of this study suggest that EN therapy reduces the incidence of postoperative CD recurrence.},

   abstract = {To understand and characterize the pathogenic mechanisms of inflammatory bowel disease, dextran sulfate sodium (DSS) has been used to induce acute and chronic colitis in animal models by causing intestinal epithelium damage. The mechanism of action of DSS in producing this outcome is not well understood. In an effort to understand how DSS might impact epithelial cell metabolism, we studied the intestinal epithelial cell line Caco-2 incubated with 1% DSS over 56 hours using (1)H NMR spectroscopy. We observed no difference in cell viability as compared to control cultures, and an approximately 1.5-fold increase in IL-6 production upon incubation with 1% DSS. The effect on Caco-2 cell metabolism as measured through changes in the concentration of metabolites in the cell supernatant included a three-fold decrease in the concentration of alanine. Given that the concentrations of other amino acids in the cell culture supernatant were not different between treated and control cultures over 56 hours suggest that DSS inhibits alanine synthesis, specifically alanine aminotransferase, without affecting other key metabolic pathways. The importance of alanine aminotransferase in inflammatory bowel disease is discussed.},

   abstract = {OBJECTIVE: The gold standard for the diagnosis and evaluation of Crohn disease (CD) is endoscopy/colonoscopy, although this is invasive, costly, and associated with risks to the patient. Recently, circulating microRNAs (miRNAs) have emerged as promising noninvasive biomarkers. Here, we examined the utility of serum miRNAs as biomarkers of CD in children. PATIENTS AND METHODS: Studies were conducted using sera samples from patients with pediatric CD, healthy controls, and a comparison group of patients with pediatric celiac disease. Serum miRNA levels were explored initially using a microfluidic quantitative reverse transcription-polymerase chain reaction array platform. Findings were subsequently validated using quantitative reverse transcription-polymerase chain reaction in larger validation sample sets. The diagnostic utility of CD-associated serum miRNA was examined using receiver operating characteristic analysis. RESULTS: A survey of miRNA levels in the sera of control and patients with CD detected significant elevation of 24 miRNAs, 11 of which were chosen for further validation. All of the candidate biomarker miRNAs were confirmed in an independent CD sample set (n = 46). To explore the specificity of the CD-associated miRNAs, they were measured in the sera of patients with celiac disease (n = 12); none were changed compared with healthy controls. Receiver operating characteristic analyses revealed that serum miRNAs have promising diagnostic utility, with sensitivities for CD above 80%. Significant decreases in serum miRNAs were observed in 24 incident patients with pediatric CD after 6 months of treatment. CONCLUSIONS: The present study identifies 11 CD-associated serum miRNA with encouraging diagnostic potential. Our findings suggest serum miRNAs may prove useful as noninvasive biomarkers in CD.},

   abstract = {OBJECTIVE: To collect data and analyze the current status and prevalence changes of Crohn's disease (CD) in mainland China in recent decades. METHODS: A computer-based literature search was previously performed by using 50-year (1950 to 2002) of records of CD from the Chinese Database of Biology and Medicine (CBM) (1979 to 2002) and a manual year-by-year search of the literature (1950 to 1978). Using similar method, descriptive epidemiological data from 2003 to 2007 were collected, analyzed and compared with previous research. RESULTS: Four hundred and seventeen relevant papers during 2003 and 2007 were collected and 62 papers were eligible for inclusion. Within 62 papers, a total of 2149 cases with CD from 2003 to 2007 have been reported nationwide, comprising 1288 male and 861 female patients, with a 1.50:1 male predominance, and indicating 1.41 time of increment as compared with our previous result (ie, 1526 cases from 1950 - 2002). There were no obvious changes in incidence age (younger and middle age were main components) and sex ratio (number of male was still larger than that of female). The extrapolated CD incidence and prevalence rates were 1.21/100 000 person.year and 2.29/100 000, respectively, which were higher than that of year 1950 - 2002, 0.28/100 000 person.year and 1.38/100 000, respectively. CONCLUSIONS: The incidence and prevalence rates of CD have been increasing rapidly, but these rates are still lower than those in Western world.},

   abstract = {The human gastrointestinal tract harbors a complex and abundant microbial community reaching as high as 10(13)-10(14) microorganisms in the colon. This endogenous microbiota forms a symbiotic relationship with their eukaryotic host and this close partnership helps maintain homeostasis by performing essential and non-redundant tasks (e.g. nutrition/energy and, immune system balance, pathogen exclusion). Although this relationship is essential and beneficial to the host, various events (e.g. infection, diet, stress, inflammation) may impact microbial composition, leading to the formation of a dysbiotic microbiota, further impacting on health and disease states. For example, Crohn's disease and ulcerative colitis, collectively termed inflammatory bowel diseases (IBD), have been associated with the establishment of a dysbiotic microbiota. In addition, extra-intestinal disorders such as obesity and metabolic syndrome are also associated with the development of a dysbiotic microbiota. Consequently, there is an increasing interest in harnessing the power of the microbiome and modulating its composition as a means to alleviate intestinal pathologies/disorders and maintain health status. In this review, we will discuss the emerging relationship between the microbiota and development of colorectal cancer as well as present evidence that microbial manipulation (probiotic, prebiotic) impacts disease development.},

   abstract = {BACKGROUND: Irritable bowel syndrome (IBS) is the most common gastrointestinal disorder, affecting more than 10% of the general population worldwide. Although a genetic component is suspected, unambiguous susceptibility genes have so far not been identified. This study tested the hypothesis that genes contributing to epithelial barrier integrity, control of mucosal immune responses and interactions with bacteria in the gut are associated with IBS. METHODS: Single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) corresponding to top signals of association with Crohn's disease at 30 known susceptibility loci were tested for their effect on IBS risk in 1992 individuals from two independent case-control cohorts from Sweden and the USA. Association tests included a conservative Bonferroni correction for multiple comparisons, and were also performed on specific subgroups of patients characterised by constipation (IBS-C), diarrhoea (IBS-D) or alternating constipation and diarrhoea (IBS-A). RESULTS: The Crohn's disease risk allele rs4263839 G in the TNFSF15 gene was significantly associated with an increased risk of both IBS (p=2.2x10(-5); OR 1.37) and more pronouncedly, IBS-C (p=8.7x10(-7); OR 1.79) in the entire sample. Similar associations and risk effects of the same magnitude were observed in the two cohorts analysed separately. A correlation between rs4263839 genotype and TNFSF15 mRNA expression was detected both in peripheral blood and in rectal mucosal biopsies from healthy individuals (combined p=0.0033). CONCLUSIONS: TNFSF15 is a susceptibility gene for IBS and IBS constipation. As TL1A, the protein encoded by TNFSF15, contributes to the modulation of inflammatory responses, the results support a role of immune activation in IBS.},
