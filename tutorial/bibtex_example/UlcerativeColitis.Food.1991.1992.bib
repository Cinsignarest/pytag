   abstract = {Arachidonic acid metabolites formed by both the cyclooxygenase and lipoxygenase pathways may contribute to the clinical diarrhea and colitis of inflammatory bowel disease. Patients with active ulcerative colitis have increased levels of leukotriene B4 in their rectal mucosa, and these levels tend to correlate with severity of the disease. In this study, we evaluated the efficacy of ingestion of fish oil n-3-omega-fatty acids, inhibitors of leukotriene synthesis, in the treatment of ulcerative colitis. Eleven patients with ulcerative colitis of mild to moderate severity were studied in a 8-month, double-blind, placebo-controlled, crossover trial of dietary supplementation with fish oil, which provided about 4.2 g of omega-3- fatty acids per day. A disease activity index based on patient symptoms and sigmoidoscopic appearance was used to assess efficacy. Mucosal leukotriene B4 production was measured by radioimmunoassay. Mean disease activity index declined 56% for patients receiving fish oil and 4% for patients on placebo (p less than 0.05). There were no statistically significant differences in histopathologic scores or colonic mucosal leukotriene B4 levels. All patients tolerated fish oil ingestion and showed no alteration in routine blood studies. No patient worsened; anti-inflammatory drugs could be reduced or eliminated in eight patients (72%) while receiving fish oil. We conclude that fish oil dietary supplementation results in clinical improvement of active mild to moderate ulcerative colitis but is not associated with significant reduction in mucosal leukotriene B4 production, compared with placebo therapy. Further studies are needed to elucidate the mechanism of action and optimal dose and duration of fish oil supplementation in ulcerative colitis.},

Nine patients [serum creatinine (s-Cr) less than 2 mg/dl; 24-hour proteinuria higher than 1.5 g, but not nephrotic) were treated with 5-ASA (2.4 g/day for 6 months); 9 similar patients were treated with SCG (400 mg/day for 6 months); the follow-up extended to 6 months after stopping therapy. The 5-ASA group showed a slight but not significant decrease in s-Cr, 24-hour/proteinuria, IgA circulating immune complexes (IgA-CIC) and IgA rheumatoid factor (IgA-RF); serum beta 2-microglobulin and serum IgA were unchanged; 2 of 9 treated patients showed, after 6 months of therapy, a reduction in proteinuria of more than 50% that lasted for the subsequent 18 months. The SCG-treated group showed a slight but not significant increase in 24-hour proteinuria and a significant decrease in serum IgA; unchanged were s-Cr, IgA-CIC, IgA-RF, serum beta 2-microglobulin; no patient treated with SCG showed a reduction in proteinuria of more than 50%. At the dosages and for the periods used, 5-ASA and SCG did not show a significant influence on clinical and laboratory parameters of disease in IgAN; other trials with increased dosages are warranted to definitely ascertain the possible therapeutic role of these drugs in IgAN.},

Two groups were comparable for age, sex, religion, place of birth, number of years spent in Britain and vegetarian status. There were no significant differences in actual oils used between healthy controls and patients with ulcerative colitis or Crohn's disease (chi 2 = 0.142 and 1.803 respectively, p greater than 0.50). However patients with Crohn's disease were found to recycle their cooking oil significantly more often than age and sex-matched colitics (p less than 0.05) and particularly age and sex-matched controls (p less than 0.01). A similar study needs to be conducted in India where the incidence of inflammatory bowel disease is low. If this difference is confirmed a programme of health education in cooking habits could lower the incidence of Crohn's disease.},

   abstract = {Inflammatory bowel disease encompasses both ulcerative colitis and Crohn's disease, two conditions so alike clinically that they are frequently indistinguishable from one another. Inflammatory bowel disease occurs at a rate of approximately five per 100,000 people. It tends to cluster in families and is seen four to five times more often in Jewish Caucasians than in other Caucasians. The etiology is unknown. Increasing attention is being paid to autoimmune factors, genetic factors and food allergies, and the notion that inflammatory bowel disease has its roots in a psychological disorder continues to pale for want of empirically sound evidence. Disease pattern is one of remission and exacerbation. The aim of therapy is to maintain an optimal lifestyle in remission through an individually tailored protocol of medications. Sulfasalazine remains the medication of choice; corticosteroids have short-term utility in exacerbation; and immunosuppressants, though controversial, are thought to have some steroid-sparing benefits during acute flare-ups. Indications for surgery vary, depending on whether or not a clear differential diagnosis has been made between ulcerative colitis and Crohn's disease. There is no cure for inflammatory bowel disease except for total colectomy in clearly diagnosed ulcerative colitis. Current research endeavors seek a cause or causes for inflammatory bowel disease, but the literature does not solidly support any one possibility above other rival etiologies.},

Infants in developed settings experience twice the hospitalization rate and more severe illness from lower respiratory tract infection, primarily respiratory syncytial virus. In developing countries the mortality risk is 4-fold. for otitis media, the relative risks were 3.3-4.3 for Finnish infants. Bacterial meningitis and/or bacteremia had a 4-fold risk for hospitalization in a Connecticut study, and a 3-fold relative risk in 2 developing country studies. Human milk was the best preventative for bacteremia and necrotizing enterocolitis in prematures in British neonatal units. A 20-fold reduction in neonatal deaths occurred in Philippine study of breastfeeding, especially in low birth weight babies. Diarrhea causes the most infant mortality in developing nations, where bottle-feeding raises rates 14-fold. In the U.S. estimated relative risks is 3.7 for diarrheal mortality. Sudden infant death is about 1/5 less common in U.S. breast fed babies than in bottle fed. There is evidence for better long-term health after breast feeding in disorders such as celiac disease, Crohn disease, ulcerative colitis, insulin-dependent diabetes mellitus, thyroid disease, malignant lymphoma, chronic liver disease, atopic dermatitis, and food allergies. The design of good studies of protection conferred by breast feeding, and the possible modes of action of breast milk are discussed.

All patients were in remission since 0.5-2 years and orally treated with sulphasalazine. The average intake of either fibres was 16 g day-1. Faecal samples were collected (72 h) before and after each fibre period. Faecal water were prepared by centrifugation of faeces at 15,000 g for 2 h. BA in faeces and faecal water were studied using capillary column gas-liquid chromatography-mass spectrometry. Faecal excretion of total BA were not significantly changed by the two fibres. Supplementation with wheat fibre, but not with ispaghula, decreased the faecal concentration of total BA by 43% (p < 0.05), unconjugated BA by 41% (p < 0.01), and taurine conjugated BA by 58% (p < 0.05). Addition of wheat fibre decreased the concentration of chenodeoxycholic acid by 66% (p < 0.05) and isomers of cholic acid by 51% (p < 0.05) in faeces. The mean faecal water concentration of taurine-conjugated BA decreased by 55% when wheat fibre was added (p < 0.05) and the concentration of isomers of deoxycholic acid increased by 39% when ispaghula was supplemented (p < 0.05). The ratio isomeric deoxycholic acid to deoxycholic acid in faecal water increased significantly when wheat fibre was added (p < 0.05). The percentage distribution of secondary and ketonic BA was not influenced by the dietary fibre supplementation. The concentration of BA in faeces and faecal water decreased only by wheat fibre, suggesting that it is superior in obtaining an affect on faecal BA concentration.},

Blood samples were taken in the morning after an overnight fasting and for 4 h postprandially after a standardized test meal. Determinations of bile acids were made by radioimmunoassays. Patients with total colitis in the active phase had significantly higher serum levels of cholic and chenodeoxycholic acids 4 h postprandially compared with control children. After long-term intake of ispaghula, significantly higher (although not different from controls) serum levels of cholic acid were found 2 and 3 h postprandially, whereas wheat fibers did not affect serum bile acid concentrations. These results may suggest an increased absorption of unconjugated bile acids in the diseased colon and a minimal influence of dietary fibers on serum bile acid concentrations.},

   abstract = {Malnutrition is a frequent occurrence in patients with acute inflammatory bowel disease. Total nutritional support provided either parentally (TPN) or enterally (TEN) has been advocated not only as an adjunct for improving nutrition but also as primary therapy. For patients with acute Crohn's disease, short-term rates of remission after TEN are equivalent to TPN. Coupled with certain advantages when compared with TPN, including simpler administration, fewer side effects, and preservation of the intestinal mucosal barrier, TEN may therefore be the preferred route for nutrient delivery. Controlled trials indicate equivalent or superior efficacy when enteral polymeric diets are compared with elemental diets for inducing remission in acute Crohn's disease. Moreover, when provided as an elemental diet, TEN is as effective as corticosteroids for achieving remission in acute Crohn's disease, but corticosteroids appear to be more effective than polymeric diets. Although the provision of nutritional support rather than bowel rest is the major factor contributing to symptomatic improvement, the optimal nutrient composition and the precise mechanisms whereby nutritional support achieves clinical remission remain to be clarified. In contrast to Crohn's disease, nutritional support is not effective for achieving remission in patients with ulcerative colitis. Thus, enteral nutritional support is an effective therapy for the short-term management of acute Crohn's disease. Whether long-term remission is equivalent to treatment with drugs or surgery requires prospective evaluation. Future avenues of investigation also include defining the optimal nutrient composition and the underlying mechanisms that achieve maximal nutritional repletion, promote mucosal cell renewal, and potentially directly retard production of inflammatory mediators.},

The activity of the eicosanoid system is modulated by neural and hormonal pathways, but local factors acting within the gastrointestinal lumen may also be involved. We have studied the influence of dietary fatty acids on eicosanoid synthesis by the gastrointestinal mucosa. Since omega-3 fatty acids compete with the omega-6 as precursors of eicosanoid synthesis, we compared the effects of dietary supplementation with either sunflower or cod liver oil as sources of omega-6 or omega-3 fatty acids, respectively. Rats fed with the cod-liver-oil-supplemented diet for four weeks showed high omega-3 and low omega-6 plasma fatty acid levels compared to rats fed with the sunflower oil diet. Synthesis of arachidonic-acid-derived eicosanoids (6-keto-PGF1 alpha, PGE2, TXB2, LTB4, and LTC4) by gastric and intestinal mucosa was found to be lower in the cod liver group as compared to the sunflower group. However, significant generation of eicosapentaenoic-acid-derived eicosanoids (PGE3 and LTC5) was observed only in the cod liver group. We used the (trinitrobenzenesulphonic acid) TNBS model of inflammatory colitis to test the effect of the dietary fat on the development of inflammatory lesions of the bowel. A single intracolonic instillation of the hapten TNBS dissolved in 10% ethanol induces chronic granulomatous lesions of the colonic mucosa that persist for up to 8 weeks. Luminal release of eicosanoid mediators, as measured by intracolonic dialysis, was lower in the cod liver group than in the sunflower group, particularly during the chronic stage of the disease.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS)},

Twenty-nine patients (81%) completed the trial; four withdrew after colitis relapse (three while receiving placebo). Grading of symptoms judged ispaghula to be consistently superior to placebo (p less than 0.001) and associated with a significantly higher rate of improvement (69%) than placebo (24%) (p less than 0.001). The results show that ispaghula can be helpful in the management of gastrointestinal symptoms in quiescent ulcerative colitis.},

   abstract = {The effect of fish oil on the course of ulcerative colitis was investigated in a randomised blinded controlled study. Eighty seven patients received supplements of 20 ml HiEPA fish oil as triglyceride (4.5 g of eicosapentaenoic acid) or olive oil placebo daily for one year. The oils were given in addition to standard drug therapy and trial entry was stratified for disease activity. Fish oil significantly increased the eicosapentaenoic acid content of rectal mucosa to 3.2% of total fatty acids at six months, compared with 0.63% for patients on olive oil. This was associated with increased synthesis of leukotriene B5, and 53% suppression of leukotriene B4 synthesis by ionophore--stimulated neutrophils. Leukotriene B4 suppression persisted for at least two months after treatment was stopped. Treatment with fish oil resulted in measurable, but only limited clinical benefit. For patients entering the trial in relapse (n = 53), there was a significant reduction in corticosteroid requirement after one and two months treatment. There was a trend towards achieving remission (off corticosteroids) faster in the patients on fish oil, although differences were not significant. For patients in remission at trial entry or during the trial (n = 69), there was no significant difference in the rate of relapse by log rank analysis. We conclude that fish oil supplementation produces a modest corticosteroid sparing effect in active disease, but there is no benefit in maintenance therapy.},

Fifty patients with ulcerative colitis diagnosed at three hospitals in Kyoto, Osaka and Hyogo Prefectures in Japan during 1984 and 1987 were interviewed about their habitual and pre-illness diets, personal habits, past histories and family histories. The results were compared to those for fifty healthy controls who were matched for sex and age (+/- 2 years) and participated in health-screening examinations in Kyoto or Osaka during the same period. Frequent intake of rice (4 or more bowls a day), bread (3 or more times a week), and green tea (7 or more cups a day) significantly increased the relative risk of ulcerative colitis. However, a past history of appendectomy was negatively correlated with the disease. There were no relationships between ulcerative colitis and consumption of animal foods and tobacco.},

With a dietary supplement of 18 g fish oil daily, concentrations of the major polyunsaturated fatty acids in fish oil, eicosapentaenoic acid and docosahexaenoic acid, were significantly raised in mucosal lipids. The first time these were measured, after three weeks' supplementation, the mean increases in eicosapentaenoic and docosahexaenoic acid were seven fold and 1.5 fold respectively, and these increases were maintained during the 12 week study. Arachidonic acid values fell throughout the study and this reduction was significant at 12 weeks. Mucosal prostaglandin E2 (PGE2), thromboxane B2, and 6-keto prostaglandin F1 alpha synthesis were suppressed, and this reached significance (p less than 0.05) at three and 12 weeks for PGE2 and at 12 weeks for thromboxane B2. The predominant fatty acid in olive oil is oleic acid. Supplementation with 18 g/day resulted in a significant increase in oleic acid in colonic mucosa at 12 weeks (p less than 0.05) and a fall in stearic acid and docosahexaenoic acid; there was no significant change in eicosanoid synthesis. It is concluded that colonic lipids and prostaglandin and thromboxane synthesis can be readily altered by dietary supplementation with fish oil. The extent of incorporation of the fatty acids present in oils is dependent upon the individual fatty acid.},

The twins were made up of five pairs concordant and nine pairs discordant for Crohn's disease, and two pairs concordant and 10 pairs discordant for ulcerative colitis. Two patients with Crohn's disease had a slight increase in disease activity, the others were in clinical remission. Two striking observations were made: first, individuals with ulcerative colitis were indistinguishable from healthy twins, and controls except for the response to gliadin. Both healthy and diseased twins had higher IgA levels to gliadin than controls. Second, twins who had developed Crohn's disease displayed higher antibody titres towards yeast cell wall mannan in particular, but also to whole yeast (Saccharomyces cerevisiae) of all antibody types (IgA, IgG, and IgM). In contrast, the response to gliadin, ovalbumin, and betalactoglobulin did not differ from healthy twins and was even lower than in the controls. The results argue against an increased systemic antigen presentation caused by an impaired mucosal barrier in the inflammatory bowel disease. Rather, they suggest that yeast cell wall material--that is, mannan, or some antigen rich in mannose and cross reacting with mannan, may play an aetiological role in Crohn's disease, but not in ulcerative colitis. The increases in IgA and IgM, as well as IgG suggest that local and systemic immune systems are selectively activated by antigen(s) present in the cell wall of baker's yeast.},

We obtained retrospective information about food intake 5 years previously by a postal questionnaire for 152 cases with Crohn's disease, 145 cases with ulcerative colitis, and 305 controls. The relative risk of Crohn's disease was increased for subjects who had a high (55 gm or more per day) intake of sucrose (relative risk = 2.6, 95% confidence interval = 1.4-5.0) and was decreased for subjects who had a high (15 gm or more per day) intake of fiber (relative risk = 0.5, 95% confidence interval = 0.3-0.9). The most striking finding was an increased relative risk of both Crohn's disease and ulcerative colitis associated with consumption of fast foods: the relative risk associated with consumption of fast foods at least two times a week was estimated at 3.4 (95% confidence interval = 1.3-9.3) for Crohn's disease and 3.9 (95% confidence interval = 1.4-10.6) for ulcerative colitis. Although coffee seemed to provide a protective effect for both diseases, there are reasons to consider this finding an artifact.},

There was evidence that some patients suffering from Crohn's Disease, together with some having coeliac disease and ulcerative colitis, did have varying amounts of aflatoxins in their serum and urine. The presence of aflatoxins may have been due to exposure to food containing these toxins or inability of the patient to excrete aflatoxins on account of some gastro-intestinal derangement.

   abstract = {It is clear that the nutritional state of patients with inflammatory bowel disease is often impaired and can be improved by the provision of nutritional support. Improvement in nutritional status can be achieved as effectively with enteral as with parenteral nutrition. Nutritional support appears to have no primary therapeutic effect in patients with ulcerative colitis. With regard to nutritional support in Crohn's disease, parenteral nutrition should be restricted to use as supportive rather than primary therapy. Available information now seems to suggest that most of the benefits of parenteral nutrition in Crohn's disease are related to an improvement in nutritional state rather than as primary therapy, and its use should be restricted to the treatment of specific complications of Crohn's disease, such as intestinal obstruction related to stricture formation or short bowel syndrome following repeated resection. Although some doubt exists over the efficacy of oligopeptide-containing elemental and polymeric enteral diets, the present evidence indicates that chemically defined free amino acid-containing elemental diets have primary therapeutic efficacy in the management of acute exacerbations of Crohn's disease. As such, these diets are worthy of therapeutic trial in patients with severe Crohn's disease involving the distal colon and rectum, particularly in those patients who are malnourished and who prove to be resistant to treatment with a combination of topical corticosteroids and 5-aminosalicylic acid-containing compounds. Clinicians should be aware, though, that the beneficial effects are likely to be restricted to the short term, with high relapse rates by 1 year, this being particularly so in patients with distal Crohn's proctocolitis (Teahon et al, 1988). Volatile fatty acid enemas clearly have potential in the management of patients with severe steroid-resistant proctitis. Finally, one of the most important observations made in recent years is the one concerning the large losses of nitrogen that will occur in patients with inflammatory bowel disease treated with corticosteroids in the absence of adequate protein intake (O'Keefe et al, 1989). Hopefully the days of treating patients with severe inflammatory bowel disease with high dose corticosteroids and a peripheral dextrose or dextrose-saline drip have passed into history.},

   abstract = {Many patients with the inflammatory bowel diseases, Crohn's disease, or ulcerative colitis have significant protein-calorie malnutrition and micronutrient deficiencies. Factors that contribute to these nutritional deficits include inadequate nutrient intake, malabsorption, excessive nutrient secretion across the diseased gastrointestinal tract, drug-nutrient interactions, and increased nutrient requirements. In this review, the use of enteral and parenteral nutrition support as primary therapy for active Crohn's disease and ulcerative colitis is discussed. Other roles for nutrition support in patients with inflammatory bowel disease, including preoperative nutrition support, nutritional treatment of intestinal fistulas and growth retardation, and home parenteral nutrition for gut failure, are also reviewed.},

   abstract = {OBJECTIVE: To determine the efficacy of fish oil supplementation in patients with active ulcerative colitis. DESIGN: Multicenter, randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled, crossover trail with 4-month treatment periods (fish oil and placebo) separated by a 1-month washout. SETTING: Four gastroenterology divisions. PATIENTS: Twenty-four patients with active ulcerative colitis entered the study. Five dropped out, and one was noncompliant. Eighteen patients completed the study. All patients had active disease as manifested by diarrhea and rectal inflammation. INTERVENTIONS: Treatment with prednisone and sulfasalazine was continued. Fish oil supplementation consisted of 18 Max-EPA (eicosapentaenoic acid) capsules daily (eicosapentaenoic acid, 3.24 g; and docosahexaenoic acid, 2.16 g). Placebo supplementation consisted of 18 identical capsules containing isocaloric amounts of vegetable oil. MEASUREMENTS: Patients were evaluated at study entry and after each diet period. Evaluations included a review of symptoms, flexible sigmoidoscopy, rectal biopsy, and rectal dialysis to measure prostaglandin E2 and leukotriene B4 levels. RESULTS: Fish oil supplementation resulted in a significant decrease in rectal dialysate levels of leukotriene B4 from 71.0 to 27.7 pg/mL (average change, -43.3 pg/mL; 95% CI, -83 to -3.6). Significant improvements were seen in acute histology index (average change, -8.5 units from a baseline of 10.5 units; CI, -12.9 to -4.2) and total histology index (average change, -8.5 units from a baseline of 14.80; CI, -13.2 to -3.8) as well as significant weight gain (average weight gain, 1.74 kg, CI, 0.94 to 2.54). No significant changes occurred in any variable during the placebo period. Seven patients received concurrent treatment with prednisone. During the fish oil supplementation period, the mean prednisone dose decreased from 12.9 mg/d to 6.1 mg/d and rose from 10.4 mg/d to 12.9 mg/d during the placebo diet period (P greater than 0.20). CONCLUSIONS: Four months of diet supplementation with fish oil in patients with inflammatory bowel disease resulted in reductions in rectal dialysate leukotriene B4 levels, improvements in histologic findings, and weight gain.},

   abstract = {Olsalazine (sodium azodisalicylate; azodisal sodium) is an anti-inflammatory agent designed to deliver its active moiety, mesalazine (5-aminosalicylic acid; mesalamine), to the colon while avoiding the adverse effects associated with the use of a sulfapyridine carrier. As a prodrug, olsalazine is an effective oral treatment for both active ulcerative colitis and for maintenance of disease remission and may possibly be of benefit in patients with Crohn's colitis. Findings from both short and long term noncomparative and comparative studies demonstrate that olsalazine 1 to 3g daily in divided doses improves clinical signs and symptoms of colitis in approximately 60 to 80% of patients with acute ulcerative colitis of mild to moderate severity. This improvement rate was similar to that obtained with sulfasalazine. Lower doses of olsalazine, usually 1g daily in divided doses, also maintained remission in patients with chronic ulcerative colitis. While olsalazine effectively delivers mesalazine to the colon, the prodrug itself increases net luminal water secretion and accelerates gastrointestinal transit of a meal. The resulting diarrhoea (occurring in approximately 17% of patients and resulting in withdrawal from therapy in 6% of patients) is distinguishable from that associated with inflammatory bowel disease by the high water content and the absence of blood. Olsalazine-induced diarrhoea usually occurred soon after initiation of olsalazine therapy or dosage increase, was more frequent with higher doses and was usually transient. Dosage reduction, increases in frequency of dosing and concomitant administration with food reduced the severity in many patients with persistent olsalazine-induced diarrhoea. With the exception of diarrhoea, olsalazine was generally well tolerated. Fewer than 14% of patients allergic to or intolerant of sulfasalazine had similar reactions to olsalazine. Olsalazine appears to be a suitable therapy for the treatment of first attacks as well as acute exacerbation of mild to moderate acute ulcerative colitis, and for the maintenance of remission in patients with chronic ulcerative colitis.},
