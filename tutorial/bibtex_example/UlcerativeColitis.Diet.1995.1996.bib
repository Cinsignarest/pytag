   abstract = {The etiology of ulcerative colitis is essentially unknown. A hospital-based case-control study examined the risk of ulcerative colitis in relation to dietary and other factors. Recruited at 20 hospitals across the nation were 101 ulcerative colitis patients who were 10-39 years old at the time of disease onset and whose disease had been diagnosed within the past 3 years. One hundred and forty-three control subjects were also examined. Information on factors was obtained by using a self-administered questionnaire. Combined consumption of western foods (bread for breakfast, butter, margarine, cheese, meats, and ham/ sausage) was significantly related to an increased risk of ulcerative colitis (trend P = 0.04). Of the six food items of the western food group, margarine was positively and significantly associated with ulcerative colitis (trend P = 0.005), and bread for breakfast tended to be positively associated with the risk (trend P = 0.07). No appreciable association was found for the consumption of Japanese foods, vegetables and fruits, confectionery, or soft drinks. Compared with lifelong nonsmokers, current smokers had a decreased risk, and former smokers had an increased risk. This study confirmed a protective association between smoking and ulcerative colitis, and suggested that margarine or chemically modified fat may play an etiological role in the development of ulcerative colitis.},

   abstract = {BACKGROUND/AIMS: Patients with inflammatory bowel disease are at risk for osteopenia. To study the metabolic bone status of these patients, a cross-sectional study was conducted. METHODS: Eighty-four patients (49 women, 35 men) with inflammatory bowel disease, 34 of whom had Crohn's disease and 50 ulcerative colitis (including 18 with prior coloproctectomy and ileoanal anastomosis), underwent clinical, dietary, and spine radiological assessments. Bone metabolism was assessed by measuring serum levels of calcium, phosphate, parathyroid hormone (1-84), 25-hydroxyvitamin D3, 1,25-dihydroxyvitamin D3, and osteocalcin. Lumbar and femoral neck bone mineral densities were measured by dual energy X-ray absorptiometry. RESULTS: Serum osteocalcin level was decreased in 29 patients (34%), 12 of whom had never undergone steroid therapy. The other biochemical markers of bone metabolism were in the normal range. Thirty-six patients (43%) had osteopenia, and 6 patients (7%) had vertebral crush fractures. Osteopenia was observed in 27 patients (52%) and 9 patients (28%) with and without corticosteroid therapy, respectively. No patient had clinical or biological signs of osteomalacia. Analysis of bone density (lumbar Z score) by a multiple regression analysis showed a statistically significant correlation with age, cumulative corticosteroid doses, sedimentation rate, and osteocalcin level (R2 = 0.76; P = 0.05). CONCLUSIONS: The results suggest that bone turnover in inflammatory bowel disease is characterized by low bone formation in the presence of normal levels of calcium-regulating hormones.},

DESIGN: The study was performed as a cross-over design.

SUBJECTS: Six men and two women, all proctocolectomised for ulcerative colitis, volunteered to participate in the study. INTERVENTIONS: During each dietary period of 3 weeks, food and excreta were collected and analysed on days 3, 17 and 18. RESULTS: The excretion of crude protein and amino acids (free and bound) was generally higher during the high-fibre diet period, although the relative proportion of amino acids was similar in the ileal effluents from the two diets. The apparent digestibilities of crude protein and all amino acids except histidine, tyrosine and proline were significantly (P < 0.05) lower during the high-fibre diet period. CONCLUSION: It was indicated that the effect of the high-fibre rye-based diet was a generally impaired ileal amino acid absorption.},

DESIGN: The study was performed as a cross-over design. SETTING: The subjects were studied as outpatients except on the sampling days when all subjects were admitted to the research ward and stayed in a nearby patient hotel overnight. SUBJECTS: Seven men and three women, all proctocolectomised for ulcerative colitis, volunteered to participate in the study. One female subject was withdrawn from the study because of inflammation of the ileal stoma. INTERVENTIONS: During each dietary period of 3 weeks, food and excreta were collected and analysed on days 3 and 17. RESULTS: No significant differences in excretion of crude protein or amino acids (free and bound) were found between the two sampling days. Intake as well as excretion of all analysed amino acids was higher during the high-fibre diet period, although the relative proportion of amino acids was comparable in the two diets and their corresponding ileal effluents. Aspartic acid, glycine, threonine, alanine and serine were found in considerably higher relative proportions in the effluents from the subjects when they consumed each of the two diets than their concentrations in the diets. The apparent digestibilities were significantly (P < 0.05) lower for all analysed amino acids during the high-fibre diet period. Aspartic acid (10.7%), alanine (9.9%) and glycine (8.5%) showed a more pronounced decrease than the mean decrease in amino acid digestibility (6.6%) when subjects consumed the high-fibre diet. CONCLUSION: Intake of the oat bran high-fibre diet resulted in significantly lower amino acid and crude protein digestibility. The relative amino acid proportions in the diets and their corresponding excretas were, however, comparable for the two diets.},

This association was examined in a prospective cohort of 47,678 American men, 40 to 75 years of age, and free of diagnosed diverticular disease, colon or rectal polyp, ulcerative colitis, and cancer before 1988. During four years of follow up, 382 newly diagnosed cases of symptomatic diverticular disease were documented. After adjustment for age, energy adjusted dietary fibre, and energy adjusted total fat, overall physical activity was inversely associated with the risk of symptomatic diverticular disease (for highest versus lowest extremes, relative risk (RR) = 0.63 (95% confidence interval (CI) 0.45, 0.88). Most of the inverse association was attributable to vigorous activity, for extreme categories RR = 0.60 (95% CI 0.41, 0.87). For activity that was not vigorous the RR was 0.93 (95% CI 0.67, 1.69). Several specific activities were inversely associated with the risk of diverticular disease, but jogging and running combined was the only individual activity that was statistically significant (p for trend = 0.03). For men in the lowest quintile for dietary fibre intake and total physical activity (compared with those in the opposite extreme), the RR was 2.56 (95% CI 1.36, 4.82). Physical activity, along with a high fibre diet, may be an important factor in the prevention of symptomatic diverticular disease.},

   abstract = {Nutritional therapy for ulcerative colitis (UC) is controversial. Studies are usually designed to investigate total parenteral (TPN) or total enteral nutrition (TEN), and before these can be compared it is necessary to differentiate between the different therapeutic aims. The aims of artificial nutritional support in patients with UC are the readjustment of the nutritional status, possible remission of disease activity, and decrease in the incidence of surgical intervention or postoperative complication. Owing to the heterogeneity of the results published so far, it is still difficult to compare studies. Nevertheless, they indicate that the extent and severity of the colitis and the patient selection are of paramount importance in the implementation of nutritional therapy. Positive effects of TPN reported from non-controlled studies were not confirmed by controlled trials. Moreover, TPN was no more effective than an oral diet. Regarding remission rates or operative interventions needed, TPN had more side effects than and no defined advantages over TEN. TEN seems to be useful for certain patients. In some patients with UC, it seems to be accompanied by fewer postoperative complications. However, a definitive conclusion on the effects of TEN or TPN is not yet possible. In this context, certain fatty acids may have an important role in the treatment of UC. In prospective, randomized and controlled studies omega-3 fatty acids were found to be therapeutically useful. A reduction of the steroid doses needed is particularly important. Another therapeutic approach in distal UC is seen in the rectal administration of short chain fatty acids.},

   abstract = {Increased binding of the lectin peanut agglutinin is a common feature in epithelial malignancy and hyperplasia. This may have considerable functional importance in the intestine by allowing interaction between the epithelium and mitogenic lectins of dietary or microbial origin. Peanut agglutinin binds the disaccharide Thomsen-Friedenreich (TF, T or core 1) blood group antigen, Gal beta (1-3) GalNAc alpha-, but is not totally specific for this site. Consequently, there has been controversy about the presence of this structure in colon cancer; studies with anti-TF monoclonal antibodies have failed to detect it. We have examined the presence of TF antigen in colonic mucus glycoprotein (mucin) using endo-alpha-N-acetylgalactosaminidase (O-Glycanase), which specifically catalyzes the hydrolysis of TF antigen from glycoconjugates. Samples of adenocarcinoma, inflammatory bowel disease (ulcerative colitis), and normal mucin were treated with O-glycanase, the liberated disaccharide was separated from the glycoprotein and analyzed using dual CarboPac PA-100 column high performance anion-exchange chromatography coupled with pulsed amperometric detection. O-Glycanase treatment released increased amounts of TF antigen from both colonic adenocarcinoma (8.0 +/- 3.9 ng/micrograms protein, n = 11; P < 0.0001 ANOVA) and ulcerative colitis mucin (3.3 +/- 0.3 ng/micrograms protein, n = 5; P = 0.04) compared with mucin samples from histologically normal mucosa distant from carcinoma (1.5 +/- 1.1 ng/micrograms protein, n = 9). However, after mild acid treatment to remove sialic acids and fucose, releasable TF antigen was increased in all nine of these histologically normal mucin samples (5.5 +/- 2.6 ng/micrograms protein, P < 0.0002). We conclude that TF antigen is an oncofetal antigen which is expressed in colon cancer, but is concealed by further glycosylation (sialylation and/or fucosylation) in the normal colonic mucosa.},

To examine the latter, a group of patients with documented ulcerative colitis was studied at the Groote Schuur Hospital Gastro-intestinal Clinic. A total of 18 subjects, 9 female and 9 male, were randomised into active or control groups and followed up weekly for 6 weeks. Subjects in the control group were asked to document but not alter their intake of food and drink. Those in the experimental group had their diets systematically manipulated to exclude foods that appeared to provoke symptoms. The symptoms, sigmoidoscopy and biopsy findings of all subjects were compared before and after. 'Remission' was defined as the passage of normal stools with absence of rectal bleeding. 'Improvement' was defined as a decrease in the number of diarrhoeal stools and/or a diminution of rectal bleeding. At the end of the trial the diet group displayed significantly fewer symptoms than did the controls (P = 0.009; Fisher's exact test). Sigmoidoscopic findings improved in 8 subjects in the diet group compared with 2 of the controls. Histological findings improved in 3 of the diet group as well as in 3 of the controls. There were no foods that provoked symptoms in all patients, though spiced and curried foods and fruits, especially grapes, melon and the citruses, commonly caused diarrhoea. In only 2 patients were symptoms reproduced consistently on reintroduction of a particular food, pork in 1 case and yellow cheese in another.},

   abstract = {We report the influence of media lipids, growth in lipid-poor medium, and cell differentiation on delta 9, delta 6, and delta 5 desaturase activity in the human CaCo-2 enterocyte cell line. We also describe the level of incorporation of palmitic (16:0), linoleic (18:2n-6), and eicosapentaenoic (EPA) acids (20:5n-3) and their higher homologues into cytosolic and membrane lipids during long-term (10 days) medium supplementation in fully differentiated 16- to 18-day-old cultures. CaCo-2 monolayers reached confluency by day 6 with subsequent development of microvilli and maximal expression of microvillus membrane sucrose, alkaline phosphatase, and gamma-glutamyltransaminase occurring between days 16 and 23 after plating. There was evidence of the presence and modulation of delta 9, delta 6, and delta 5 desaturase activity (delta 9 > delta 6 > delta 5). delta 6 Desaturase activity decreased approximately 2-fold between days 6 and 24 of culture and when the fetal bovine serum concentration was increased from 0.5% to 25%; in contrast, when cells were starved for 72 h, activity increased 5.4-fold. When the media was supplemented with either linoleic acid and/or EPA, both delta 6 and delta 5 desaturase activities were inhibited, the greatest reduction of delta 5 desaturase activity occurring with EPA. Incorporation of media fatty acids plus their desaturase and elongase products was highly dependent on medium composition with the homologues of delta 9 > delta 6 > delta 5. Supplementation of cellular media with 100 microM EPA for 10 days decreased membrane phosphatidylethanolamine arachidonic acid level from 13.2 to 8.9%. From these results we conclude that enterocyte membrane fatty acid composition and desaturase enzyme activity are regulated by both dietary fat intake and cell maturation. The clinical relevance of these observations on lipid dietary modification for the management of chronic inflammatory bowel disease is still uncertain but these observations suggest that the beneficial effects of EPA supplements on human ulcerative colitis may be due to a reduction in enterocyte arachidonic acid content by down-regulation of delta 6 and delta 5 desaturase activity.},

A similar episode of coma had occurred 7 years earlier after she delivered a normal boy. Heterozygous ornithine transcarbamylase deficiency was diagnosed based on a positive allopurinol tolerance test result after elevated levels of plasma glutamine and low plasma citrulline were detected. The protein load associated with parenteral alimentation resulted in symptomatic expression of this partial enzyme deficiency in this unique case. Partial ornithine transcarbamylase deficiency must always be considered in adult women and men with hyperammonemia who have normal liver function test results.},

Seventeen healthy subjects (mean age, 55 years; range, 43-71 years; nine males) who had had a proctocolectomy for ulcerative colitis more than 1 year previously and without small intestinal resection were studied. Subjects were studied on 4 days after an overnight fast, two studies with and two without breakfast. A standard diet was used on all days. Twenty radiopaque markers were given at the start of each study day. Ileostomy effluent was collected over 24 hr and x-rayed to determine the number of retained markers. Studies with breakfast demonstrated greater intrasubject reproducibility. The mean transit time for passage of 50% of markers was 16.6 hr with, and 14.8 hr without, breakfast (p < 0.02). From the data obtained we suggest that the optimum time for taking a single abdominal radiograph in a patient with suspected fast transit is 6 hr after ingestion of markers, while the optimum time for a patient with suspected slow transit is 24 hr.},

   abstract = {: Recent studies have suggested that n-3 fatty acids from fish oil (FO) as well as short-chain fatty acids may attenuate some of the gut injury and inflammationassociated ulcerative colitic (UC). The objectives of this study were to (a) assess the antiinflammatory activity of sulfasalazine (SAZ), a drug known to be effective in the treatment of human UC in a model of chronic granulomatous colitis in rats and (b) determine whether enteral diets supplemented with either FO or two indigestible oligosaccharides (fructooligosaccharide, FOS; xylooligosaccharide, XOS) could attenuate the inflammation observed in a model of chronic granulomatous colitis. In one series of experiments, female Lewis rats were randomized into three groups consisting of a sham-operated control group, a colitic group, and a colitic group in which rats were given oral sulfasalazine (SAZ) immediately after induction of colitis and continued for 3 weeks. Chronic granulomatous colitis with liver and spleen inflammation was induced by subserosal (intramural) injection of purified peptidoglycan-polysaccharide (PG/PS) into the distal colon. Sham-operated rats were injected with human serum albumin. All rats received standard lab chow. In a second series of experiments, female Lewis rats were randomized into six groups consisting of four colitic groups fed enteral diets, a colitic group fed chow, and a sham-operated group fed a control enteral diet. Enteral diets (300 kcal/kg/day) contained either FO, FOS/ gum arabic, XOS/gum arabic, or no bioactive ingredient (control diet). All rats were fed for 1 week before induction of colitis. Rats consumed the diets for 3 additional weeks before being killed. SAZ significantly attenuated the PG/PS-induced increases in myeloperoxidase (MPO) activity as well as significantly reduced the PG/PS-induced increases in liver and spleen weights. Control (enteral diet) as well as the FO and XOS diets significantly attenuated the increase in colon weight when compared with chow-fed rats. We also found that the FO and XOS diets significantly attenuated the PG/PS-induced increases in colonic MPO activity and colon weight. The FOS and XOS diets significantly attenuated the PG/PS-induced increases in liver weights when compared with PG/PS + chow-fed animals. The antiinflammatory activity of these diets was confirmed by means of histological inspection showing an inhibition of inflammation and maintenance of crypt cell integrity. These results demonstrate that a complete enteral diet supplemented with either FO, FOS, or XOS exhibited antiinflammatory activity that was similar in efficacy to the known antiinflammatory drug SAZ in this model of colitis.},

The effect of environment and diet on the evolution of the disease was studied in animals from birth to 5 years of age. METHODS: Newborn tamarins were assigned to three groups reared in (1) a colony in which colitis was highly prevalent and fed a standard diet; (2) an isolation unit and fed a standard diet or one of two semipurified diets; and (3) a multispecies nursery, returned to the colony, and fed the same semipurified diets. Mucosal biopsy specimens from the descending colon were taken at 4-month intervals. RESULTS: Acute colitis and chronic mucosal changes were significantly higher in the colony than in the isolation unit. Diet had no effect on acute colitis, but chronic mucosal changes were significantly higher in animals fed a standard diet than semipurified diets. CONCLUSIONS: Data suggest that acute colitis was associated with environment. Factors in the environment, including a transmissible agent, are discussed. Chronic mucosal changes were modified by diet. Cancer was associated with acute colitis and chronic changes and seems to be associated with diet.},

Malnutrition is a common occurrence in IBD, and this must be considered in the treatment of these diseases. Nutritional support in IBD has limited use as primary therapy (Table 2). Even though parenteral and enteral nutrition have been associated with remission, relapse frequently occurs when normal food intake is resumed. Likewise, fistulae may resolve with aggressive, nutritional therapy, but they frequently recur with reinstitution of food. In short bowel syndrome caused by extensive intestinal resection performed in CD, parenteral nutrition provides an important mode of therapy. In addition, perioperative use of nutritional support may decrease the incidence of postoperative complications in patients who are malnourished. Nutritional support in pediatric patients with CD who have growth failure has been effective in stimulating growth.},

In this present study, genetic or environmental factors that may be operative in the development of UC were investigated. After 1966, the annual incidence of UC increased rapidly, to a peak in 1974, tending to remain at the same level since 1975. Since 1975, the daily intake of dairy products and meat increased, paralleling the increase in the incidence of UC. The trends of the increase in the incidence of UC and the increase in the daily intake of meat were very similar. The tendency for UC to occur in families was high, especially in first-degree relatives, and the age at onset of UC in patients where there was familial occurrence was younger. There was no difference in HLA antigens between UC patients with familial occurrence and the unaffected relatives studied. It is presumed that not only genetic factors but also environmental factors may be operative in the development of UC.},

   abstract = {OBJECTIVES: Patients with ulcerative colitis (UC) are at increased risk for developing dysplasia or cancer (neoplasia) and are usually offered colonoscopic surveillance to reduce their risk of cancer-related mortality. The causes of neoplasia may be related to features of UC (the extent, severity, activity, and age at onset of the disease) and to environmental factors (medications, vitamin and mineral supplementation, diet, or industrial pollutants). To determine whether and how the risk (and hence the risk factor profile) for the development of neoplasia changes over time, we conducted an historical cohort study. METHODS: From 445 adult patients with UC proximal to the splenic flexure seen in the Department of Gastroenterology between 1986 and 1992, a random sample of 209 patients was selected. Patients with UC for less than 8 yr or colectomy or neoplasia detected within 2 yr of referral were excluded, leaving 98 patients in the cohort, half of whom had disease onset during or before 1972. RESULTS: After controlling for age at disease onset and duration of disease at first colonoscopy, we found that patients with an earlier year of disease onset were 85% less likely to develop neoplasia than patients with a later year of disease onset (hazard rate ratio 0.15, 95% confidence interval 0.03-0.66). CONCLUSION: These data suggest that the risk for developing neoplasia in UC patients increases with increasing calendar year, implying a worsening risk factor profile.},

   abstract = {A clinical syndrome of chronic colitis unique to the sigmoid colon harboring diverticular was recently reported; its histopathological appearance has not been fully elucidated. In this study, the authors analyzed the clinical and pathological features of 23 patients (age range, 38-87 years; median age, 72 years) with diverticular disease-associated chronic colitis. Nineteen presented with hematochezia; four had abdominal pain. Colonoscopic visualization of the mucosa showed patchy or confluent granularity and friability affecting the sigmoid colon encompassing diverticular ostia. Colonic mucosae proximal and distal to the sigmoid were endoscopically normal. Mucosal biopsy specimens showed features of idiopathic inflammatory bowel disease that included plasmacellular and eosinophilic expansion of the lamina propria (100%), neutrophilic cryptitis (100%) with crypt abscesses (61%), basal lymphoid aggregates (100%), distorted crypt architecture (87%), basal plasmacytosis (61%), surface epithelial sloughing (61%), focal Paneth cell metaplasia (48%), and granulomatous cryptitis (26%). Concomitant rectal biopsies obtained in five patients demonstrated histologically normal mucosa. Fourteen patients treated with high-fiber diet or antibiotics or both improved clinically, as did nine patients administered sulfasalazine or 5-aminosalicylic acid. Five patients underwent sigmoid colonic resection, three for stricture with obstruction and two for chronic blood loss anemia. Among a control population of 23 age- and gender-matched patients with diverticular disease without luminal surface mucosal abnormality, none required resection during the same follow-up period. By Fisher's exact test, a statistically significant difference in outcome for patients with and without colitis was detected (p = 0.049). In addition, three patients developed ulcerative proctosigmoiditis 6, 9, and 17 months after the onset of diverticular disease-associted colitis. The data indicate that diverticular disease-associated chronic sigmoid colitis expresses morphological features traditionally reserved for idiopathic inflammatory bowel disease. Its clinical and endoscopic profiles permit distinction from Crohn's disease and ulcerative colitis. Patients with chronic colitis in conjunction with diverticula are at increased risk for sigmoid colonic resection. Diverticular disease-associated chronic colitis may also precede the onset of conventional ulcerative proctosigmoiditis in some cases.},

   abstract = {Marine lipids contain eicosapentaenoic acid (EPA) which has anti-inflammatory effects. The aim of this research was to study, using the dextran sulfate induced acute colitis (AC) model, the effect of an EPA-rich shark fin supplemented diet on the mucosal lipid composition. The histology score increased in AC (p < 0.05), but only slightly in the EPA group. Similarly, colonic permeability to a intraluminally instilled water-soluble contrast medium significantly increased in the AC group, but not in EPA group. As compared with controls, the AC group showed lower levels of phosphatidylethanolamine, phosphatidylinositol, free fatty acid C20:5, and PL-FA C18:1 and C18:2 and higher levels of sphingomyelin, lysophosphatidylcholine, and C18:1 and free fatty acid C20:4 (p < 0.01) after 2 and 7 days. In the EPA group sphinogmyelin and lysophosphatidylcholine slightly increased and free fatty acid C20:4 decreased (p < 0.05) after 7 days, and no PL-FA change occurred. This study confirms the protective properties of EPA-rich marine food. EPA-enriched diet is protecting the colonic mucosa from the early derangements of lipid components occurring in this experimental AC model. This effect is likely to contribute to maintain an effective mucosal lining barrier.},

   abstract = {The etiology of inflammatory bowel disease is still unknown. Several potential mechanisms are discussed. The etiological and therapeutic importance of nutrition is controversial. Though changes in dietary habits and incidence of inflammatory bowel disease during the last century were in parallel, no specific nutritional factor has been isolated. No dietary prophylaxis of inflammatory bowel disease is yet known; all dietary therapies in inflammatory bowel disease aim to improve nutritional support and to diminish inflammation by bowel rest. Children and adolescents gain in weight and height. Total parenteral nutrition will not substantially reduce disease activity and operation rates. Total parenteral nutrition can only be recommended in ulcerative colitis patients with severe disease in the initial phase and in Crohn's patients with severe malnutrition and intestinal complications. Enteral nutrition support is less effective in ulcerative colitis than in Crohn's disease. Reported remission rates on enteral nutrition are 25% for ulcerative colitis and up to 80% for Crohn. However, in active Crohn's disease enteral nutrition is less effective than standard therapy with methylprednisolone and sulfasalizine. It is generally believed that nutrition therapy in combination with drugs is the best treatment modality. There is no evidence to support the importance of any combination of the formula diets such as elemental, oligopeptide, or polymeric formulations. Administration of formula diets by nasogastric tubes all show similar remission rates. Whether newer diets supplemented with arginine, glutamine, omega-3-fatty acids or short chain fatty acids increase remission rates is not known. Further studies in this field are warranted.},

   abstract = {Fermentation, the process whereby anaerobic bacteria break down carbohydrates to short-chain (C2-C6) fatty acids (SCFAs), is an important function of the large bowel. SCFAs constitute approximately two-thirds of the colonic anion concentration (70-130 mmol/l), mainly as acetate, propionate, and butyrate. Gastroenterologists have, in spite of these facts, addressed this scientific field surprisingly late, in contrast to veterinarians, for whom the fermentative production of SCFAs has been acknowledged as a principal mechanism of intestinal digestion in plant-eating animals for decades. Interest in the effects of SCFA production on the human organism has been growing rapidly in the last 10 years, because gastrointestinal functions and beneficial effects are associated with these acids. SCFAs are of major importance in the understanding of the physiological function of dietary fibre and their possible role for colonic neoplasia. SCFA production and absorption are closely related to the nourishment of the colonic mucosa and sodium and water absorption, and mechanisms of diarrhoea. Patients with severe malabsorption compensate by the fermentation of otherwise osmotic active saccharides to SCFAs, which are readily absorbed and used as energy fuels in the organism. SCFA production from dietary carbohydrates is a mechanism whereby considerable amounts of calories can be salvaged in short-bowel patients with remaining colonic function if dietary treatment is adjusted. SCFA enemas are a new and promising treatment modality for patients with ulcerative colitis. The effect has been attributed to the oxidation of SCFAs in the colonocytes. An impressive number of papers have described the effects of butyrate on various cell functions, the significance of which is still unknown. Up until now, attention has been related especially to cancer prophylaxis and treatment. Diminished production of SCFAs appears to be involved in antibiotic-associated diarrhoea, diversion colitis, and possibly in pouchitis. The interaction between bacterial fermentation, ammonia metabolism, and bacterial growth and protein synthesis appears to be the main mechanism of action of lactulose treatment in hepatic coma. Pathological and extremely high rates of saccharide fermentation explain the severe deterioration in patients with D-lactate acidosis. Hence, this scientific field has come late to clinical working gastroenterologists, but as work is progressing the production of SCFAs in the large bowel becomes involved in several well-known intestinal disorders.},

   abstract = {Nutrition and intestinal function are intimately interrelated. The chief purpose of the gut is to digest and absorb nutrients in order to maintain life. Consequently, chronic gastrointestinal (GI) disease commonly results in malnutrition and increased morbidity and mortality. For example, studies have shown that 50-70% of adult patients with Crohn's disease were weight-depleted and 75% of adolescents growth-retarded. On the other hand, chronic malnutrition impairs digestive and absorptive function because food and nutrients are not only the major trophic factors to the gut but also provide the building blocks for digestive enzymes and absorptive cells. For example, recent studies of ours have shown that a weight loss of greater than 30% accompanying a variety of diseases was associated with a reduction in pancreatic enzyme secretion of over 80%, villus atrophy and impaired carbohydrate and fat absorption. Finally, specific nutrients can induce disease, for example, gluten-sensitive enteropathy, whilst dietary factors such as fibre, resistant starch, short-chain fatty acids, glutamine and fish-oils may prevent gastrointestinal diseases such as diverticulitis, diversion colitis, ulcerative colitis, colonic adenomatosis and colonic carcinoma. The role of dietary antigens in the aetiology of Crohn's disease is controversial, but controlled studies have suggested that elemental diets may be as effective as corticosteroids in inducing a remission in patients with acute Crohn's disease. In conclusion, nutrition has both a supportive and therapeutic role in the management of chronic gastrointestinal diseases. With the development of modern techniques of nutritional support, the morbidity and mortality associated with chronic GI disease can be reduced. On the other hand, dietary manipulation may be used to treat to prevent specific GI disorders such as coeliac disease, functional bowel disease, Crohn's disease and colonic neoplasia. The future development of nutria-pharmaceuticals is particularly attractive in view of their low cost and wide safety margins.},

   abstract = {Treatment of non-specific bowel inflammation (NBI) particularly of Crohn's disease (MD) and ulcerative colitis is very complicated, especially because of the fact, that in spite of atrial successful findings, the etiology of both main diseases of this group remain unknown. Nevertheless, manifestations, particularly in MC vary, often unexpectedly and surprisingly. Different medical teams elaborate therapeutic schedules, but none of them has been accepted world-wide. As it is still possible to state that NBI is untreatable by drug therapy, even the surgical removal of the affected part of the bowel does not protect against the relapse, it may indicate that no therapeutical approaches are sufficient at present. Using drug therapy, the biochemical chain of numerous inflammatory mediators is being tried to be disrupted. Despite the advances achieved, there are still many difficulties related to drug therapy. It is necessary to take into account the fact that the lack of knowledge in causative therapy and failure, poor response to initial therapy lead to the use of more new drugs. Therefore a careful consideration of every used or recommended drug is necessary. The principle of using Hylacombun (Merckle) in therapy was not applied due to the presumption of influencing the disease fundamentally, but due to an effort to reduce some symptoms of the disease, which deteriorate the life quality of patients. Data given by patients in questionnaires as well as biochemical and haematological parameters were evaluated statistically. Besides the commonly used Student t-test, we used Box and Whisker plots, linear trend analysis and the method of 9 aggregation numbers to follow both dynamics of the disease and drug effect. Laboratory, as well as the questionnaire data were equilibrated and graphically illustrated by the spline method. We found out that Hylacombun was effective in all patients. Subjective improvement was shown after 10 days of therapy, stabile improvement after 2 months. (Tab. 3, Fig. 7, Ref. 9.).},

   abstract = {What have epidemiologic studies on IBD taught so far? Consistent findings are as follows: A high incidence of both CD and UC in industrialized countries and an increase in these areas of the incidence of CD during the years 1960-80 followed by a plateau phase, and a more stable pattern in UC during the same period have been found. A greater number of mild cases have probably been diagnosed recently. This also helps to explain the differences in severity and survival between community and referral centre groups. The male to female ratio is greater than 1 in UC, and this is the opposite in CD. Mortality of IBD has decreased during the past decades. As young people are especially prone to develop IBD, most of those affected will have their disease for many years. In developing IBD, genetic influences are of importance. However, epidemiologic studies strongly point to possible interactions between genetically determined features and environmental or other factors. Of these exogenic factors smoking is the most consistent, being of negative influence in CD and protective in UC. Diet and oral contraceptives may influence disease expression, and perinatal events such as viral infections may alter adult susceptibility. The question remains open whether UC and CD are one diseases entity. Similarities in the epidemiologic features of UC and CD support the idea of IBD being one disease. Other findings suggest dividing UC and CD into further subgroups: in CD it has been suggested that fibrostenotic, penetrating, and inflammatory behaviour should be considered different disease entities; in UC some groups consider ulcerative proctitis a disease entity on its own, separating it from the proximally extending colitis. In therapeutic trials this approach has proved to be of importance, and it is not inconceivable that in subgroups, with regard to aetiopathogenetic mechanisms, different factors have to be looked for.},

Even rectal 5-aminosalicylic acid has been found to be useful in maintaining long-term remissions of distal ulcerative colitis. Particularly noteworthy is the demonstrated efficacy of oral mesalamine in reducing recurrence rates of Crohn's disease following ileocecal resection, if introduced within the first few weeks after surgery. In all cases, the efficacy of the aminosalicylates is dose related, with little benefit demonstrable, at least in Crohn's disease, at oral doses < 2 g/day. In contrast to aminosalicylates, corticosteroids and cyclosporine are better suited to the induction of rapid remissions of acute disease than to the maintenance of long-term remissions. Antimetabolites, especially azathioprine and 6-mercaptopurine, are highly beneficial and relatively safe for long-term steroid-sparing therapy in both ulcerative colitis and Crohn's disease, at least for those patients whose initial remissions have already been induced by these agents.},

   abstract = {PURPOSE: Acute pouchitis is a troublesome complication after restorative proctocolectomy. Deficiency of fuel, especially short chain fatty acids (SCFA), produced by anaerobic bacterial fermentation of saccharides, is implicated in ulcerative and diversion colitis. Our hypothesis was that SCFA deficiency occurs in acute pouchitis, and correction of the deficiency is associated with resolution of pouchitis. METHODS: Thirty-two patients were studied, 10 with histologically confirmed acute pouchitis and 22 with healthy pouches. Stool concentrations of SCFA (acetic, propionic, butyric, and valeric acids) were determined by gas-liquid chromatography. Quantitative bacteriologic studies of stool were carried out, and four-quadrant pouch biopsies were assessed by a pathologist who was unaware of the clinical state. Patients with pouchitis were treated for six weeks with metronidazole and given dietary advice to increase their intake of fermentable saccharides. RESULTS: Stool concentrations of SCFA were significantly less in pouchitis patients compared with patients with healthy pouches (340 mumol/g (range, 124-492) vs. 93 (range, 44-136) P < 0.01). No differences in anaerobic or aerobic counts were seen. Resolution of pouchitis was associated with a significant increase in SCFA, but anaerobic counts fell. CONCLUSION: Deficiency of SCFA is implicated in acute pouchitis.},

After surgery, she received intravenous hyperalimentation (IVH) which contained 1,000 Kcal/day without vitamin supplementation. From the 8th to the 13th post-operative days, she took 3/4 or more of the liquid diet which contained 1,050 Kcal, protein 35 g, carbohydrate 166 g and vitamin B1 0.59 mg per day. From the 14th to the 23rd post-operative days, she ate 4/5 or more of the oral diet which contained 1,700 Kcal/day, protein 68 g, carbohydrate 236 g and vitamin B1 0.93 mg per day. During the 7th to the 23rd day, the IVH was reduced to 800 Kcal and then 500 Kcal per day. She talked less on the 19th post-operative day, and in a few days, her level of consciousness began to decline progressively. On the 27th post-operative day, neurological examinations revealed the following: semi-coma, almost fixed pupils which were 3 mm in diameter, absent doll's eye movement to all directions, flaccid extremities with abolished deep tendon reflexes. Pertinent abnormalities on laboratory data at that time consisted of hemoglobin 7.8 g/dl and serum total protein 5.4 g/dl. Lumbar puncture revealed normal cerebrospinal fluid under normal opening pressure. Cranial magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) taken on the 27th post-operative day demonstrated, on T2-weighted images, symmetrical high intensity lesions in the periventricular areas of the third and fourth ventricles, and periaqueductal area of the midbrain.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS)},

   abstract = {BACKGROUND: Some patients with inflammatory bowel disease have reduced bone mineral density, but the risk factors for osteoporosis in these patients are unclear. METHODS: To evaluate the effect of smoking and other lifestyle factors on bone mineral density in patients with inflammatory bowel disease, we studied 67 patients with ulcerative colitis, 78 with Crohn's disease, 7 with indeterminate colitis, and 73 healthy control subjects. Bone mineral density of the lumbar spine and the proximal femur was measured, using dual-energy X-ray absorptiometry. Measures of smoking and other lifestyle factors were assessed in an interview. RESULTS: The female ex- or current smokers with inflammatory bowel disease (n = 38) had lower age- and sex-adjusted Z-scores of bone mineral density than the female patients who had never smoked (n = 34) (Z-scores in the lumbar spine, -0.277 (1.283) (mean (standard deviation)) and 0.487 (1.056), respectively; p = 0.008; and in the femoral neck, -0.626 (1.055) and -0.013 (1.019); p = 0.015). These differences were not explained by the type or treatment of the disease, the menstrual history, or the use of estrogen preparations. In male patients no differences in bone mineral density were found between ex- or current smokers and non-smokers. Coffee drinking and alcohol consumption were not associated with bone mineral density in these patients. CONCLUSIONS: Smoking is associated with low bone mineral density in women with inflammatory bowel disease. This association is not related to the body mass index, the medical treatment, or the type of disease.},

Animals in Group 1 were fed the diet containing 1.5% 1-HA for 48 weeks. The rats in Group 2 were given the 1-HA diet together with 16 ppm IMC in the drinking water for 48 weeks. Group 3 was given IMC alone throughout the study. Group 4 was served as an untreated control. At the end of the study, the incidences of large bowel and forestomach tumors in Group 2 were significantly smaller than those in Group 1 (large bowel tumors: 0/14 rats, 0% in Group 2 versus 12/27 rats, 44% in Group 1, p < 0.002; forestomach tumors: 2/14 rats, 14% in Group 2 versus 14/27 rats, 52% in Group 1, p < 0.01). Also, the incidences of inflammatory changes including ulcerative colitis and melanosis coli in colonic mucosa of rats of given 1-HA together with IMC were significantly reduced compared with those in rats given 1-HA alone (ulcerative colitis: 2/14 rats, 14% in Group 2 versus 20/27 rats, 74% in Group 1, p < 0.004). Concurrent administration of IMC with 1-HA caused a significant decrease in the bromodeoxyuridine labeling index of the colonic mucosa. These results indicate that the nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drug IMC inhibits 1-HA-induced carcinogenesis and that this effect in decreasing the cell proliferation.},

   abstract = {We present the operative technique of laparoscopic proctocolectomy along with the clinical course of the first four patients to undergo this procedure. The operation was conducted through five 12-mm ports. In total laparoscopic proctocolectomy, the dissection began with the sigmoid, left colon, and rectum. The gastrocolic ligament was opened at the level of the midtransverse colon and dissected along with the transverse mesocolon toward the splenic flexure. The attachments and vessels of the right side of the gastrocolic ligament and the right colon were taken last. This sequence was followed because gradual mobilization of the colon displaced all structures in the middle of the abdomen and obscured vision. The specimen was extracted through the anus. In laparoscopy-assisted proctocolectomy, it was necessary to incise only the white line of Toldt of the ascending and descending colon, mobilize the hepatic and splenic flexures, and ligate the vessels of the gastrocolic ligament. Then the vessels of the mesentery were ligated near the bowel wall through a 6.5-cm midline subumbilical incision from which the abdominal colon was also extracted. The rectum was then completely dissected and sectioned at 10-15 cm from the anus, everted, and resected at the dentate line. Mean operative time was 7 h, 18 min, and average blood loss was 493 ml. One patient had urinary retention. Return to liquid diet took a mean of 4 days. Average postoperative stay, which depended on full return of bladder function and teaching of stoma care, was 10 days.},

DESIGN: We studied dietary habits immediately prior to the onset of disease in 104 patients enrolled in a prospective, epidemiological study of the incidence of inflammatory bowel disease in Italy. METHODS: Each patient was interviewed using a recall questionnaire to provide information on the daily intake of nutrients. The differences in diet between patients and healthy subjects matched for age, sex and city of residence were determined. RESULTS: Our data confirm that patients with Crohn's disease and ulcerative colitis have a high intake of total carbohydrate, starch and refined sugar. This resulted in a significantly higher relative risk (P < 0.001) in both ulcerative colitis and Crohn's disease patients. Total protein intake was significantly higher in ulcerative colitis, but not in Crohn's disease patients, than in controls. Fibre consumption did not differ between patients and controls. CONCLUSIONS: Our results confirm that carbohydrate consumption is significantly higher in IBD patients than in healthy controls. Ulcerative colitis patients also consumed more total protein than controls. The pathogenetic significance of these findings, however, remains unclear.},

   abstract = {PURPOSE: Emergency surgery for fulminant colitis is often complicated by high-dose steroid therapy, poor nutrition, and psychologic maladjustment. Cyclosporine is effective for fulminant ulcerative colitis in adults, resulting in avoidance of immediate surgery in 75 percent of patients and a 55 percent long-term remission rate. Over the last five years, we studied the effectiveness of cyclosporine in children with fulminant colitis. METHODS: Fourteen patients with ulcerative colitis (age, 7-20 years) received cyclosporine after satisfying the following criteria: 1) greater than five bloody diarrheal stools per day; 2) severe abdominal pain; 3) no improvement after ten days of bowel rest, 4) intravenous methylprednisolone (1-2 mg/kg/day); and 5) parenteral nutrition. Treatment was begun with oral cyclosporine (4.6-9.6 mg/kg/day), and the dose was adjusted to achieve whole blood trough levels measured with a monoclonal radioimmunoassay between 150 and 300 ng/ml. If improved, patients were discharged on oral cyclosporine, prednisone, and a regular diet. RESULTS: Eleven of 14 patients (78 percent) responded within two to nine days and were able to consume a normal diet, had three or less soft stools per day, and had no pain. One did not respond after ten days and underwent an ileal pouch-anal anastomosis procedure. Two patients elected surgery after 20 days of therapy and a partial response. Of 11 patients who left the hospital, 4 had recurrent symptoms after 2 to 11 months of taking therapeutic doses of cyclosporine and 3 flare ups while weaning from cyclosporine after 4 to 8 months. Three patients have been weaned from cyclosporine after 8 to 13 months and have remained in remission from six months to five years. One patient is about to complete a six-month course of cyclosporine. Overall ten (72 percent) have undergone surgery, including 7 of 11 who responded initially to cyclosporine and left the hospital. Weight (P < 0.001), albumin (P < 0.01), erythrocyte sedimentation rate (P > 0.05), and prednisone dose (P < 0.001) improved significantly in the seven patients on cyclosporine who responded initially, left the hospital, and subsequently underwent surgery. CONCLUSIONS: Cyclosporine is effective in achieving clinical remission in 80 percent of children with refractory fulminant colitis; however, within one year, most initial responders will require colectomy because of a flare up of the disease. In a majority of patients, the role of cyclosporine therapy is to rapidly ameliorate symptoms and prevent precipitous colectomy, improve nutrition and psychologic adaptation, and reduce the steroid dose leading to surgery in a well-prepared patient.},

   abstract = {Neoplasms constitute the major complication of coeliac disease, and high-grade T-cell lymphoma of the small intestine (enteropathy-associated T-cell lymphoma) is the most common neoplasm in this category. HLA genotyping indicates that in patients with enteropathy-associated T-cell lymphoma have the coeliac disease associated DQA1*0501, DQB1*0201 phenotype, although additional HLA-DR/DQ alleles may represent risk factors for lymphoma development. Molecular biological and immunohistochemical studies have shown that the intestinal mucosa distant from the tumour contains clonal populations of small T cells, often of the same clone as the high-grade T-cell lymphoma. These findings suggest that enteropathy-associated T-cell lymphoma arises in the setting of coeliac disease and evolves from reactive intraepithelial lymphocytes through a low-grade lymphocytic neoplasm to a high-grade tumour, which is usually the cause of the presenting symptoms. Most cases of chronic ulcerative enteropathy (ulcerative jejunitis) are probably part of the same disease process. If the ulceration occurs at a time when the neoplastic T-cells are of a low grade, morphological recognition of tumour cells in the ulcers may be impossible. Carcinoma of the pharynx and oesophagus, and adenocarcinoma of the small intestine, are increased in frequency in patients with coeliac disease. The increased risk of carcinoma of the oesophagus may be related to vitamin A deficiency. A number of reports have indicated an increased prevalence of various types of chronic hepatitis in patients with coeliac disease, but no coherent view of the cause of this association has emerged. Similarly, patients with coeliac disease have been reported to have various forms of fibrosing lung disease of uncertain causation. In recent years, there have been several reports, mainly from Italy, of a syndrome of epilepsy and bilateral brain calcification occurring in coeliac patients. The pathogenesis of this condition is not known and its prevalence in other communities is uncertain. Splenic atrophy occurs frequently in patients with coeliac disease and is related to the severity of the disease and degree of dietary control. Splenic atrophy predisposes to infection with capsulated bacteria, although mortality studies indicate that infection with these organisms is not a major cause of death in patients with coeliac disease.},

   abstract = {Inflammation has been considered to be related to carcinogenesis. Previously, we demonstrated that 1-hydroxyanthraquinone (1-HA), a naturally occurring carcinogen, induced severe inflammation such as ulcerative colitis in colonic mucosa. We also showed that indomethacin inhibited the tumorigenicity of 1-HA. In this study, we examined the expressions of major enzymes in arachidonic acid cascade related to inflammation in the colon mucosa of rats treated with 1-HA. After the treatment of 1% 1-HA diet, colon lesions were observed and RNA was extracted from mucosa and neoplasms. The mRNA expressions of group II phospholipase A2, cyclooxygenase-2 and 5-lipoxygenase, were examined by using a reverse transcriptase polymerase chain reaction. The expressions of phospholipase A2 and cyclooxygenase were significantly increased in non-neoplastic mucosa in rats treated with 1-HA compared with those in control rats. The expressions in the neoplasms induced by 1-HA were also increased. Phospholipase A2, especially, was much higher in the neoplasms than in non-neoplastic mucosa. However, the expression of 5-lipoxygenase showed no change in the non-neoplastic mucosa and neoplasms of rats treated with 1-HA, compared with that in control rats. These findings suggest that the inflammation induced by 1-HA may be related to the metabolites through a cyclooxygenase pathway, which indicates a prostaglandin synthesis, but not through a lipoxygenase pathway, which indicates a leukotriene synthesis in arachidonic acid cascade.},
