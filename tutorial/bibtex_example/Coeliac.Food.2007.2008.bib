   abstract = {OBJECTIVES: To evaluate state and trait form of anxiety and current depression in patients affected by gastrointestinal diseases. METHODS: We studied 1641 outpatients with gastrointestinal disorders, consecutively referred to our Internal Medicine outpatients from 1997 to 2005. State and trait anxiety were assessed by the State and Trait Anxiety Inventory. Current depression was assessed by the Zung self-rating depression scale. RESULTS: Among patients, 1379 (84.1%) showed state anxiety, 1098 (67%) showed trait anxiety and 442 (27%) showed current depression. The number of gastrointestinal diseases was directly correlated to state anxiety (p < 0.001) and trait anxiety (p = 0.04). Females showed higher levels of anxiety and depression than males (p < 0.001). State anxiety was related to food allergies (p < 0.001), small intestinal bacterial overgrowth (SIBO) (p = 0.001), Hp infection (p = 0.01) and ulcerative colitis in active phase (p = 0.03). Trait anxiety was related to irritable bowel syndrome (IBS) (p < 0.001), Helicobacter pylori (Hp) infection (p = 0.001), food allergies (p = 0.001) and SIBO (p = 0.001). Current depression was related to IBS (p < 0.001) and coeliac disease (p = 0.01), SIBO (p = 0.02). A predicted probability of 0.77 +/- 0.16 to have state anxiety, of 0.66 +/- 0.12 to have trait anxiety and of 0.39 +/- 0.14 to have depression was found in these patients. CONCLUSIONS: Most of the patients who seek medical consultation for gastrointestinal problems show an associated affective disorder. These patients should be managed by a team including gastroenterologists, psychologists and/or psychiatrists, or by a gastroenterologist having expertise in the treatment of psychological disorders.},

   abstract = {This position paper on complementary feeding summarizes evidence for health effects of complementary foods. It focuses on healthy infants in Europe. After reviewing current knowledge and practices, we have formulated these conclusions: Exclusive or full breast-feeding for about 6 months is a desirable goal. Complementary feeding (ie, solid foods and liquids other than breast milk or infant formula and follow-on formula) should not be introduced before 17 weeks and not later than 26 weeks. There is no convincing scientific evidence that avoidance or delayed introduction of potentially allergenic foods, such as fish and eggs, reduces allergies, either in infants considered at increased risk for the development of allergy or in those not considered to be at increased risk. During the complementary feeding period, >90% of the iron requirements of a breast-fed infant must be met by complementary foods, which should provide sufficient bioavailable iron. Cow's milk is a poor source of iron and should not be used as the main drink before 12 months, although small volumes may be added to complementary foods. It is prudent to avoid both early (<4 months) and late (>or=7 months) introduction of gluten, and to introduce gluten gradually while the infant is still breast-fed, inasmuch as this may reduce the risk of celiac disease, type 1 diabetes mellitus, and wheat allergy. Infants and young children receiving a vegetarian diet should receive a sufficient amount ( approximately 500 mL) of breast milk or formula and dairy products. Infants and young children should not be fed a vegan diet.},

AIM: To investigate the threshold amount of gluten and the threshold concentration of gluten in food products that can be tolerated by people with coeliac disease. DESIGN: Systematic review of studies published between 1966 and May 2007. METHODS: The data sources used were MEDLINE, EMBASE, Cochrane Central Register of Controlled Trials, CINAHL, and reference lists of retrieved articles. We included studies that evaluated the amount of dietary gluten or the concentrations of gluten in food products that can be tolerated by people with coeliac disease whatever their design, method or language of publication. RESULTS: Thirteen studies (three randomized controlled, one cohort, two crossover, and seven cross-sectional) met the inclusion criteria. The daily amount of tolerable gluten varied widely between studies. Whilst some patients tolerated an average of 34-36 mg of gluten per day, other patients who consumed about 10 mg of gluten per day developed mucosal abnormalities. The effect of the consumption of 'gluten-free' products with different degrees of gluten contamination was also inconsistent. CONCLUSIONS: The amount of tolerable gluten varies among people with coeliac disease. Although there is no evidence to suggest a single definitive threshold, a daily gluten intake of <10 mg is unlikely to cause significant histological abnormalities.},

   abstract = {UNLABELLED: Clinical, serological and histological remission in celiac disease is strictly related to long life complete exclusion of gluten from the diet. Because celiac disease is an autoimmune systemic disorder the potential complications include a wide spectrum with two severe long-term morbidities: osteoporosis and malignancy. Gluten free diet, easy to be recommended, is difficult to be followed. This study aimed at evaluating the diagnostic criteria and dietary instruction, quality of life issues, impact of the gluten free diet on the celiac patient. MATERIAL AND METHOD: 250 patients (mean age at diagnosis 18.18 years) on gluten-free diet were asked to fill out a disease specific questionnaire. RESULTS: The response rate was 58.4% (mean age at diagnosis 11 years); 7% had no biopsy proven diagnosis (being excluded) and 28.26% had only antigliadin antibodies tested as serology method; 84.78% had typical digestive symptoms at diagnosis; 28.2% had been followed up after the diagnosis; information about the disease and diet have been provided exclusively by the gastroenterologist in 95.6% of the responders, 45.6% considering the information insufficient. The gluten free products were considered in 73.9% of cases too expensive for the family income, with low availability, lack of variety and unclear labeling; 48.8% reported impaired access to certain activities (social events, traveling) and even having difficulties to be accepted for some jobs. CONCLUSIONS: There is evidence that an educational program is needed to improve knowledge on the atypical forms of disease, diagnostic criteria and tools. The quality of life would be improved by support groups for patients, improved availability, better prices and food labeling.},

   abstract = {AIM: To determine the risk of malignancy and mortality in patients with a positive endomysial or anti-gliadin antibody test in Northern Ireland. METHODS: A population-based retrospective cohort study design was used. Laboratory test results used in the diagnosis of coeliac disease were obtained from the Regional Immunology Laboratory, cancer statistics from the Northern Ireland Cancer Registry and mortality statistics from the General Registrar Office, Northern Ireland. Age standardized incidence ratios of malignant neoplasms and standardized mortality ratios of all-cause and cause-specific mortality were calculated. RESULTS: A total of 13 338 people had an endomysial antibody and/or an anti-gliadin antibody test in Northern Ireland between 1993 and 1996. There were 490 patients who tested positive for endomysial antibodies and they were assumed to have coeliac disease. There were 1133 patients who tested positive for anti-gliadin antibodies and they were defined as gluten sensitive. Malignant neoplasms were not significantly associated with coeliac disease; however, all-cause mortality was significantly increased following diagnosis. The standardized incidence and mortality ratios for non-Hodgkin's lymphoma were increased in coeliac disease patients but did not reach statistical significance. Lung and breast cancer incidence were significantly lower and all-cause mortality, mortality from malignant neoplasms, non-Hodgkin's lymphoma and digestive system disorders were significantly higher in gluten sensitive patients compared to the Northern Ireland population. CONCLUSION: Patients with coeliac disease or gluten sensitivity had higher mortality rates than the Northern Ireland population. This association persists more than one year after diagnosis in patients testing positive for anti-gliadin antibodies. Breast cancer is significantly reduced in the cohort of patients with gluten sensitivity.},

   abstract = {Public anxiety over gluten has fuelled widespread demand for gluten-free food, yet coeliac disease remains significantly underdiagnosed and some confusion remains regarding optimal diagnostic practices. Small bowel histology is the gold standard for diagnosis. High-quality commercial enzyme-linked immunosorbent assays for transglutaminase immunoglobulin A and deamidated gliadin immunoglobulin A and G are sensitive tools for screening, but almost 10% of coeliac disease is seronegative and serological testing is unreliable in the very young, in people already following a gluten-reduced diet, and those using immunosuppressive medications. HLA DQA and DQB genotyping to show that alleles encoding HLA DQ2 and DQ8 are absent virtually excludes coeliac disease. Confirming histological remission reduces the risks of later complications, such as osteoporosis and cancer. Monitoring remission by serology is unreliable. Because gluten is an exogenous antigen and the small intestine is readily accessible, the immunopathogenesis of coeliac disease is better understood than other strongly major histocompatibility complex class II-associated diseases, such as type 1 diabetes mellitus. Therapeutic targets have been identified and drugs are under development to supplement or even replace gluten-free diet. With greater awareness and non-dietary therapeutics, diagnosis and treatment of coeliac disease will be increasingly prominent in medical practice.},

   abstract = {Bread is a traditional food generally prepared from wheat flour. The main wheat component responsible for bread quality is gluten, which is an essential structure-binding protein. Although important, this protein can cause health problems in predisposed individuals, and is avoided in the diet of celiac disease patients. As diagnosis methods are improved, revealing the high incidence of gluten-intolerance in the western world, the demand for novel, nutritious and high-quality gluten-free foods also ascends. However, for the production of gluten-free breads the absence of gluten is critical and challenging in regards to the bread structure. Various gluten-free formulations have applied hydrocolloids to mimic the viscoelastic properties of gluten. They comprise a number of water-soluble polysaccharides with varied chemical structures providing a range of functional properties that make them suitable to this application. This paper reviews some actual facts about celiac disease and focuses on the reported applications of hydrocolloids in gluten-free breads.},

   abstract = {BACKGROUND & AIMS: Tissue transglutaminase (tTG) autoantibodies are markers of celiac disease, and the enzyme is required for several crucial biological processes. The aim of this study was to determine whether these autoantibodies are involved in the pathogenesis of the mucosal lesion typical of celiac disease. METHODS: Using rhodamine-conjugated phalloidin staining, we evaluated whether tTG antibodies, both commercially available and cloned from patients with celiac disease, cause cytoskeletal changes in Caco-2, MCF7, and NIH 3T3 cells. We monitored cell levels of bromodeoxyuridine incorporation to determine whether tTG autoantibodies are able to induce NIH 3T3 fibroblasts and epithelial mucosal cells into S phase. RESULTS: Treatment with tTG antibodies caused a dose-dependent increase of membrane ruffling in Caco-2, MCF7, and NIH 3T3 cells. It also dose-dependently induced G(0)-synchronized NIH 3T3 fibroblasts into S phase but did not affect the rate of apoptosis. Similarly, tTG antibodies induced S-phase entry of epithelial cells in cultured intestinal biopsy specimens from patients with celiac disease. They did not affect biopsy specimens from patients without celiac disease. CONCLUSIONS: Our results suggest that tTG autoantibodies per se, by interacting with the extracellular membrane-bound transglutaminase, may play an important role in epithelial cell proliferation in celiac disease.},

   abstract = {BACKGROUND: Gliadins, a family of wheat proteins, are central to the pathogenesis of celiac disease (CD). In addition to 'immunogenic' effects, gliadin directly affects cultured cells and intestine preparations, and produces damage in vivo, via a separate 'toxic' peptide, such as A-gliadin p31-43 (P31-43). AIMS: Understanding the molecular mechanisms underlying direct non T-cell mediated effects of gliadin peptides, and assessing their potential role in promoting CD. METHOD: Gliadin effects were tested on a number of cell lines and on cultured mucosa samples by evaluating cytoskeleton rearrangements, endocytosis, proliferation and apoptosis. Standard biochemical methods were used to assess prolonged epidermal growth factor receptor (EGFR) activation. RESULTS: Crude gliadin peptic-tryptic peptides (PTG], or P31-43 alone, fully reproduce the effects of epidermal growth factor (EGF] on actin cytosketon, cell cycle and cell proliferation of various cell lines. Inhibitor studies demonstrate the role of EGFR in the early response to gliadin exposure, pointing to activation of the EGFR pathway. Peptide P31-43 is not similar to any EGFR ligand, but can delay inactivation of the EGFR interfering with its endocytosis. Gliadin-induced delay of EGFR endocytosis in cultured intestinal biopsies, together with S-phase entry of epithelial intestinal cells, confirm a role for EGFR activation in CD. CONCLUSION: The ability of gliadin peptides to delay EGFR inactivation through interference with the endocytic pathway suggests a model where gliadin fragments amplify the effects of trace amounts of EGF, and possibly of other growth factors, by prolonging receptor activation. The results, using cultures of coeliac intestinal biopsies, highlight the role of the EGF pathway in establishing and maintaining the typical atrophic and proliferative alterations of the small intestine in CD.},

Nonetheless, there are very few studies which have addressed the potential differences in boys' and girls' immune systems. From our perspective of long-term research in low-income countries, it is problematic that we implement preventive health interventions and treatments which influence the immune system without investigating whether there are sex-differences in the response to these interventions.},

Ammonia release, sodium dodecyl sulfate-polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis, and sample solubility analyses were employed to check the extent of gluten modification. Among different treatments achieved, the acid-heating treatment performed at 90 degrees C for 3 h induced gluten deamidation, paralleling an increase of gluten solubility without relevant proteolysis. Changes in the immunoreactivity of celiac IgA anti-gliadin antibodies (AGAs) to modified gluten proteins were detected by using a competitive indirect enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay method. Chemical deamidation by acid-heating treatment of gluten lowered IgA-AGA immunoreactivity. IgA-AGA immunoreactivity to gliadins was increased when they were submitted to TGase-catalyzed deamidation. The acid-heating treatment of gluten reduced its cytotoxic activity on human colon adenocarcinoma LoVo cell line. These results showed that chemical deamidation of gluten may be envisaged as a way to lower the potential risk for celiac people due to widespread use of gluten as a food additive.},

   abstract = {Symptomatic hypogammaglobulinaemia in children younger than 2 years of age was studied to rule out a primary immunodeficiency. Thirty-four patients were referred to the Immunology Service to study the hypogammaglobulinaemia-associated clinical picture. Food allergy was documented in 10 patients by personal and familial history, presence of specific immunoglobulin E (IgE) and elevated total serum IgE levels. Coeliac disease and human immunodeficiency virus infection were also ruled out. Protein loss through stools was assessed by clearance of alpha1-antitrypsin (AAT). Serum immunoglobulin levels were determined by nephelometry and functional antibodies were studied by enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay. The cellular immune response was assessed by in vitro lymphocyte proliferation in response to mitogens and cell subsets were analysed by flow cytometry. In five patients of the 10 patients we suspected a protein loss through the mucosa. Four of these five patients showed an increased AAT and the other showed an extensive cutaneous lesion. Immunological studies revealed normal antibody function, in vitro lymphoproliferative responses and cell numbers in four of the 5 patients. One patient showed abnormally low numbers of CD4(+) T cells as well as a defective proliferative response to mitogens. After diagnosis of cow milk allergy, milk was replaced with infant milk formula containing hydrolysed proteins. Recovery of immunoglobulin values and clinical resolution were achieved. Hypogammaglobulinaemia during early childhood in some children may be secondary to cow milk allergy, and immunoglobulins and cells may leak through the inflamed mucosa. Resolution of symptoms as well as normalization of immunoglobulin values may be easily achieved by avoidance of the offending allergen.},

As tTG is homologous to microbial transglutaminase (mTG) used to improve foodstuff quality, it could elicit the immune response of celiac patients. This study evaluated the reactivity of IgA of celiac patients to prolamins of wheat and gluten-free (maize and rice flours) breads mTG-treated or not. Prolamins extracted from wheat and gluten-free breads were analyzed by ELISA and immunodetected on membranes with individual or pooled sera from nine celiac patients recently diagnosed. Sera pool IgA titers were higher against prolamins of mTG-treated wheat or gluten-free breads than against mTG-untreated, mainly due to two individual patients' sera. The electrophoretic pattern of gluten-free bread prolamins was changed by the mTG treatment, and a new 31000 band originated in maize was recognized by three CD patients' IgA.},

   abstract = {BACKGROUND: Ample use of serological markers of high sensitivity and specificity led to relevant changes in the epidemiology of celiac disease. The impact of these changes in our country is poorly known. AIM: To assess the diagnostic procedures, clinical presentations and follow up of celiac disease as conducted in current pediatric practice. MATERIAL AND METHODS: A multicentric retrospective study of patients diagnosed between 2000 and 2005 in five pediatric hospitals in Santiago, Chile. Data was obtained from clinical records, recorded in electronic spreadsheets and analyzed by descriptive statistics. RESULTS: Seventy four of 83 identified patients fulfilled the inclusion criteria and were analyzed. Mean time to reach the diagnosis was 2.1 years. Cases younger than 10 years presented digestive manifestations such as chronic diarrhea and abdominal distension. Twenty one percent of older patients had atypical presentations (mainly short stature, refractory anaemia). Ten percent of cases were screened because a first degree relative had celiac disease. All patients had significant duodenal/jejunal lesion. IgA-antiendomysial antibodies (n =65) and IgA-antigliadin antibodies (n =23) were the most commonly used screening tests used but often, they were not available for follow up. A second biopsy was planned in all patients but only 26 had it due to repeated dietary transgressions, often due to unnoticed consumption of gluten in poorly labeled products. CONCLUSIONS: Digestive manifestations were the main presentation form for celiac disease among patients under 10 years of age. Atypical symptoms become relevant in patients older than 10 years. Antiendomysial and antitransglutaminase antibody measurement should be incorporated for routine screening and follow up of celiac disease in public hospitals. To improve food labeling about their gluten content is needed.},

Thus, there is an urgent need to develop and implement nutritional approaches and policies for the prevention and treatment of osteoporosis. Patients with some chronic inflammatory diseases appear to be more likely to develop osteopenia, and in some cases earlier in life, which is of particular concern as the incidence of inflammatory diseases in the Western world is increasing. While the cause of bone loss in patients with inflammatory disease is multifactorial, nutrition may have a role. Many of these patients may have one or more nutritional deficiencies, which can lead to altered rates of bone metabolism. On the other hand, some nutritional factors may attenuate the inflammatory process itself, and thus may indirectly benefit bone metabolism and bone health in patients with inflammatory disease. The present review will consider these issues, particularly in the context of inflammatory bowel disease, coeliac disease and atherosclerosis.},

AIM: To analyze the cost of basic food basket (BFB) compared to a basket especially designed for celiac patients in Chile and to estimate the increment in food spending that these patients experience. MATERIAL AND METHODS: The cost of a daily BFB was calculated using the National Socioeconomic Characterization Enquiry (CASEN) methodology of the Ministry of Planning and the food prices delivered by the National Institute of Statistics for consumers, adjusted according to consumer prices at june 2007. To calculate the cost of the basket for celiac disease, equivalent foods without gluten were considered. Their daily and monthly values and the percentage difference between them were analyzed, by food groups and type of basket. RESULTS: The monthly value of BFB and a basket for a celiac is, at June 2007, Ch $ 30.251 and Ch $ 57.250, respectively. This represents an increase in feeding costs for celiac patients of 89%. CONCLUSIONS: The greater cost of food without gluten represents limitation in the budget of celiac patients.},

   abstract = {BACKGROUND: Treatment of celiac disease (CD) is based on the avoidance of gluten-containing food. However, it is not known whether trace amounts of gluten are harmful to treated patients. OBJECTIVE: The objective was to establish the safety threshold of prolonged exposure to trace amounts of gluten (ie, contaminating gluten). DESIGN: This was a multicenter, double-blind, placebo-controlled, randomized trial in 49 adults with biopsy-proven CD who were being treated with a gluten-free diet (GFD) for > or =2 y. The background daily gluten intake was maintained at < 5 mg. After a baseline evaluation (t0), patients were assigned to ingest daily for 90 d a capsule containing 0, 10, or 50 mg gluten. Clinical, serologic, and histologic evaluations of the small intestine were performed at t0 and after the gluten microchallenge (t1). RESULTS: At t0, the median villous height/crypt depth (Vh/Cd) in the small-intestinal mucosa was significantly lower and the intraepithelial lymphocyte (IEL) count (x 100 enterocytes) significantly higher in the CD patients (Vh/Cd: 2.20; 95% CI: 2.11, 2.89; IEL: 27; 95% CI: 23, 34) than in 20 non-CD control subjects (Vh/Cd: 2.87; 95% CI: 2.50, 3.09; IEL: 22; 95% CI: 18, 24). One patient (challenged with 10 mg gluten) developed a clinical relapse. At t(1), the percentage change in Vh/Cd was 9% (95% CI: 3%, 15%) in the placebo group (n = 13), -1% (-18%, 68%) in the 10-mg group (n = 13), and -20% (-22%, -13%) in the 50-mg group (n = 13). No significant differences in the IEL count were found between the 3 groups. CONCLUSIONS: The ingestion of contaminating gluten should be kept lower than 50 mg/d in the treatment of CD.},

Celiac disease is a chronic intestinal disease involving intolerance to gluten. Symptomatic celiac disease varies in presentation and may include malabsorption, diarrhea, steatorrhea, and malnutrition. Its etiology is multifactorial, related to genetic susceptibility and exposure to gluten. Exclusive breastfeeding, with its many health benefits, may mitigate or delay symptomatic celiac disease. Because infants with a positive family history of the disease could be affected, it is crucial to identify those at risk and educate and advise parents regarding the importance of exclusive breastfeeding.},

   abstract = {BACKGROUND & AIMS: Celiac disease is a condition in which genetically predisposed people have an autoimmune reaction to gluten proteins found in all wheat types and closely related cereals such as barley and rye. This reaction causes the formation of autoantibodies and the destruction of the villi in the small intestine, which results in malabsorption of nutrientsand other gluten-induced autoimmune diseases. Sorghum is a cereal grain with potential to be developed into an important crop for human food products. The flour produced from white sorghum hybrids is light in color and has a bland, neutral taste that does not impart unusual colors or flavors to food products. These attributes make it desirable for use in wheat-free food products. While sorghum is considered as a safe food for celiac patients, primarily due to its relationship to maize, no direct testing has been conducted on its safety for gluten intolerance. Therefore studies are needed to assess its safety and tolerability in celiac patients. Thus the aim of the present study was to assess safety and tolerability of sorghum flour products in adult celiac disease patients, utilizing an in vitro and in vivo challenge. RESULTS: Sorghum protein digests did not elicit any morphometric or immunomediated alteration of duodenal explants from celiac patients. Patients fed daily for 5 days with sorghum-derived food product did not experience gastrointestinal or non-gastrointestinal symptoms and the level of anti-transglutaminase antibodies was unmodified at the end of the 5-days challenge. CONCLUSIONS: Sorghum-derived products did not show toxicity for celiac patients in both in vitro and in vivo challenge. Therefore sorghum can be considered safe for people with celiac disease.},

   abstract = {BACKGROUND: Gut bifidobacteria are believed to influence immune-related diseases. The objective of this study was to assess the possible relationships between the gut bifidobacteria composition and coeliac disease (CD) in children. A total of 48 faecal samples (30 and 18 samples from active and no active CD patients, respectively) and 33 duodenal biopsy specimens of CD patients (25 and 8 samples from active and non-active CD patients, respectively) were analysed. Samples (30 faecal samples and 8 biopsies) from a control age-matched group of children were also included for comparative purposes. Gut Bifidobacterium genus and species were analyzed by real-time PCR. RESULTS: Active and non-active CD patients showed lower numbers of total Bifidobacterium and B. longum species in faeces and duodenal biopsies than controls, and these differences were particularly remarkable between active CD patients and controls. B. catenulatum prevalence was higher in biopsies of controls than in those of active and non-active CD patients, whereas B. dentium prevalence was higher in faeces of non-active CD patients than in controls. Correlations between levels of Bifidobacterium and B. longum species in faecal and biopsy samples were detected in both CD patients and controls. CONCLUSION: Reductions in total Bifidobacterium and B. longum populations were associated with both active and non-active CD when compared to controls. These bacterial groups could constitute novel targets for adjuvant dietary therapies although the confirmation of this hypothesis would require further investigations.},

All members of the Canadian Celiac Association (n=5240) were surveyed with a questionnaire. Respondents included 2681 adults with biopsy-proven celiac disease. The mean age was 56 years. Most common presenting symptoms included abdominal pain (83%), diarrhea (76%), and weight loss (69%). The mean delay in diagnosis was 11.7 years. Diagnoses made prior to celiac disease included anemia (40%), stress (31%), and irritable bowel syndrome (29%). Osteoporosis was common. Prior to diagnosis, 27% of respondents consulted three or more doctors about their symptoms. Delays in diagnosis of celiac disease remain a problem. Associated medical conditions occur frequently. More accurate food labeling is needed. Improved awareness of celiac disease and greater use of serological screening tests may result in earlier diagnosis and reduced risk of associated conditions.},

   abstract = {Probiotic strains have been reported to exert immunomodulatory activities in the gut-associated lymphoid tissue. In this study we explored the effect of Lactobacillus casei in transgenic mice expressing the human DQ8 heterodimer, a HLA molecule linked to Celiac Disease (CD). DQ8 mice, mucosally immunized with the gluten component gliadin, mounted an intestinal Th1-like response as observed in CD, without developing enteropathy. Co-administration of L. casei in sensitized mice specifically enhanced the gliadin-specific response mediated by CD4(+) T cells. Notably, both a strong increase of the gliadin-specific IFNgamma expression and a pro-inflammatory polarization of the cytokine milieu in the small intestinal mucosa were associated to the presence of the probiotic strain. However, this condition did not bring on any mucosal alteration. These findings suggest that the gliadin-specific enteropathy is not merely related to the HLA DQ8-restricted massive production of IFNgamma, but additional parameters are involved. Moreover, our data imply that the intrinsic adjuvanticity of L. casei can be exploited to further enhance both mucosal and systemic T cell-mediated responses.},

   abstract = {Anticancer agents, such as cisplatin, induce vomiting, nausea, and anorexia. Cisplatin primarily acts on vagal afferents to produce emesis, but little is known about how this drug generates nausea and anorexia. Electrophysiology indicates that cisplatin activates vagal afferents of the common hepatic branch (CHB). Rats lack an emetic response but do ingest kaolin clay (a pica response) when made sick by toxins, and this behavior can be inhibited by antiemetic drugs. It has been postulated that pica may serve as a proxy for emesis in the rat. The goal of this study was to assess the effect of CHB or ventral gastric (Gas) or celiac (Cel) branch vagotomies on pica and anorexia produced by cisplatin in the rat. The effects of apomorphine, a dopamine receptor agonist, which induces emesis via a central mechanism, were also assessed. Cisplatin-induced pica was suppressed by CHB vagotomy (a 61% reduction) but not by Gas and Cel vagotomy. Suppression of daily food intake and body weight following cisplatin treatment was also blunted by CHB ablation but not by Gas or Cel vagotomy. No vagotomy condition exhibited altered apomorphine-induced pica. The results indicate that the CHB, which innervates primarily the duodenum, plays an important role in cisplatin-induced malaise. These data suggest that pica has sensory pathways similar to emetic systems, since a vagotomy condition inhibited cisplatin-induced pica but had no effect on apomorphine-induced pica. This investigation contributes to the delineation of the physiology of pica and neural systems involved in malaise in the nonvomiting rat.},

Fermentation occurred in two steps: (i) long-time fermentation (16 h) and (ii) fast fermentation (1.5 h) using the previous fermented sourdough as inoculum (ca. 43%, wt/wt) with Saccharomyces cerevisiae (baker's yeast). GF bread started with baker's yeast alone was used as the control. Gluten was added to ingredients before fermentation to simulate contamination. Initial gluten concentration of 400 ppm was degraded to below 20 ppm only in the sourdough GF bread. Before baking, sourdough GF bread showed phytase activity ca. sixfold higher than that of GF bread started with baker's yeast alone. Atomic absorption spectrophotometric analysis revealed that the higher phytase activity resulted in an increased availability of free Ca2+, Zn2+, and Mg2+. The concentration of free amino acids also was the highest in sourdough GF bread. Sourdough GF bread had a higher specific volume and was less firm than GF bread started with baker's yeast alone. This study highlighted the use of selected sourdough cultures to eliminate risks of contamination by gluten and to enhance the nutritional properties of GF bread.},

The R5 ELISA allows the identification and quantification of wheat, barley and rye prolamins, and has demonstrated significant contamination in a range of products. If patients with coeliac disease are to take oats, it is important that those consumed are free of contamination. This assay should allow the identification of safe oat products.},

She had been treated previously with an antibiotic for diarrhea. Laboratory analyses showed the presence of iron-deficiency anemia, mild hypoalbuminemia, and considerably prolonged prothrombin time and activated thromboplastin time. Tests revealed that hemostasis improved after the patient received fresh frozen plasma. A coagulation profile showed a decrease in clotting factors II, VII, IX, and X. The patient was given intravenous vitamin K therapy (5 mg/d) for 3 d. All coagulation tests were normalized, and bruising started to disappear. Positive serology (immunoglobulin A antitissue transglutaminase and immunoglobulin A antiendomysial antibodies) and smallbowel mucosal histopathology confirmed the presence of celiac disease (CD). The girl recovered completely after she was put on a gluten-free diet. Vitamin K-deficiency bleeding is a rare complication that occurs almost exclusively in patients with typical CD manifestations. In addition to antibiotic therapy, treatment with other drugs that influence vitamin K resorption and metabolism may increase the risk of bleeding in patients with CD with hypoprothrombinemia.},

   abstract = {BACKGROUND AND AIM: Gherlin, an endogenous ligand for the growth hormone secretagogue receptor (GHS-R), is produced by stomach cells. It regulates food intake, gastric secretion and motility. However, its role as a protective agent in gastric ischemia/reperfusion (I/R) injury has not yet been investigated. Therefore, the objectives of the present study were to: (i) test the in vivo effect of peripherally administered ghrelin on gastric I/R-induced lesions in rats; and (ii) investigate in vitro the effect of ghrelin on reactive oxygen species (ROS) production by human polymorphoneuclear (PMN) cells. METHODS: The present study was carried out on three groups of rats (six per group): control (sham-operated), I/R (clamping of celiac artery for 30 min and reperfusion for 1 h), and I/R + ghrelin (200 ng/kg i.v., 15 min before ischemia and before reperfusion, respectively). Histological assessment of hematoxylin and eosin stained sections was performed and immunostaining with inducible nitric oxide (iNOS) antibody were performed on a gastric paraffin embedded section. Oxidative stress markers thiobarbituric acid reactive substance (TBARS) and glutathione (GSH) were measured in gastric tissue homogenates. Serum lactic acid dehydrogenase (LDH) was determined. Tumor necrosis factor-alpha (TNF-alpha) was assayed in gastric tissue homogenate. Gastric permeability was assessed calorimetrically using Evans blue dye. In vitro studies were carried out on isolated human PMN cells incubated with ghrelin and tested for ROS generation as measured by chemiluminecence (CL). RESULTS: Peripheral administration of ghrelin attenuated gastric injury by reducing ulceration, tissue congestion, cellular infiltration and vascular permeability. Serum level of LDH and tissue content of TNF-alpha were markedly reduced. A decrement in TBARS and an increment in GSH were observed. Ghrelin treatment attenuated iNOS protein expression which was upregulated by gastric ischemic injury. In vitro studies showed for the first time that ghrelin inhibited ROS generation by human PMN in a dose-dependent manner. CONCLUSIONS: These results provide evidence that peripherally administered ghrelin protects against gastric I/R injury. We also demonstrated that this protection is possibly accomplished through the antioxidant activity of ghrelin observed in vivo and in vitro.},

   abstract = {(Table is included in full-text article). The suitability of oats as part of a gluten-free diet is controversial. Contamination of many oats products with wheat, rye and particularly barley, together with inadequacy of available gluten-testing systems may account, at least in part, for the confusion. Some clear evidence has, however, emerged in the past few years that a small number of gluten-sensitive patients display a specific small intestinal T cell response to oat peptides that cannot be explained by contamination with other cereals. Oats could form a potentially useful part of a gluten-free diet, but patients require careful advice and monitoring, backed by robust gluten-assay techniques.},

   abstract = {Coeliac disease is a multifactorial disease characterized by a dysregulated immune response to ingested wheat gluten and related cereal proteins. With an incidence of about 1% of the general population, it is considered the most common food intolerance disorder. The mainstay of coeliac disease treatment is strict lifelong adherence to a gluten-free diet. Elimination of gluten and related proteins from the diet leads to clinical and histological improvement. However, some patients do not respond to dietary therapy and others have poor dietary compliance. This has prompted the search for a therapy alternative to a gluten-free diet. Tissue transglutaminase is a crucial factor in coeliac disease because it promotes the gluten-specific T-cell response and is also the target of the autoimmune response. Tissue transglutaminase induces changes in gluten, which in turn, cause the generation of a series of gluten peptides that bind to HLA-DQ2 or DQ8 molecules with high affinity. The resulting HLA-DQ2 (DQ8)-gluten peptide interaction triggers the proinflammatory T cell response. Tissue transglutaminase is also involved in other non-T-cell-mediated biological activities of gliadin peptides. For these reasons, tissue transglutaminase is a potential target for therapeutic intervention. In this paper we review the state-of-the-art of tissue transglutaminase inhibition, and examine known and new-generation inhibitors and their activity in in vitro and in vivo models. We also examine their potential as therapeutic tools for coeliac disease.},

This study investigates the in vitro survival of genes bla and cryIA(b) of maize Bt176 in human gastric juice samples. Five samples of gastric juice were collected from patients affected by gastro-esophageal reflux or celiac disease and three additional samples were obtained by pH modification with NaHCO3. DNA was extracted from maize Bt176 and incubated with samples of gastric juices at different times. The survival of the target traits (bla gene, whole 1914 bp gene cry1A(b), and its 211 bp fragment) was determined using PCR. The stability of the target genes was an inverse function of their lengths in all the samples. Survival in samples from untreated subjects was below the normal physiological time of gastric digestion. On the contrary, survival time in samples from patients under anti-acid drug treatment or in samples whose pH was modified, resulted strongly increased. Our data indicate the possibility that in particular cases the survival time could be so delayed that, as a consequence, some traits of DNA could reach the intestine. In general, this aspect must be considered for vulnerable consumers (people suffering from gastrointestinal diseases related to altered digestive functionality, physiological problems or drug side-effects) in the risk analysis usually referred to healthy subjects.},

   abstract = {BACKGROUND & AIMS: Conjugated bile acids promote absorption of dietary lipids by solubilizing them in mixed micelles. Bile acids are not considered to facilitate the digestion of other nutrients. METHODS: The effect of conjugated bile acids on the rate of protein hydrolysis by trypsin and chymotrypsin was examined in vitro. Common dietary proteins and 2 bacterial glutenases (proposed oral therapies for celiac sprue) were proteolyzed in the absence or presence of a 10 mmol/L conjugated bile acid mixture, simulating human bile composition. Lipolysis products (monoolein) and fatty acid were also evaluated to simulate postprandial intestinal contents. RESULTS: Conjugated bile acids dramatically enhanced the proteolysis of several dietary proteins, including beta-lactoglobulin, bovine serum albumin, myoglobin, and a commercially available dietary protein supplement. For beta-lactoglobulin, a cow's milk allergen that is resistant to pepsin cleavage, bile acids enhanced its proteolysis by pancreatic proteases even after incubation under gastric conditions. Exposure of prolyl endopeptidases to bile acids made them more susceptible to pancreatic proteases under simulated intestinal conditions. The conjugated bile acid effect was most pronounced in the presence of dihydroxy bile acids and was observable at bile concentrations below the critical micellar concentration but to a much greater extent at concentrations above the critical micellar concentration. CONCLUSIONS: We propose that, in addition to promoting lipid absorption, conjugated bile acids affect the digestion and assimilation of dietary proteins by accelerating hydrolysis by pancreatic proteases. These findings have implications for intraluminal protein breakdown and assimilation in the upper small intestine.},

   abstract = {AIMS: To evaluate the role of the peptidase activities from sourdough lactic acid bacteria (LAB) in the degradation of alpha-gliadin fragments. METHODS AND RESULTS: Different proline-containing substrates were hydrolysed by LAB indicating pro-specific peptidase activities. Lactobacillus plantarum CRL 775 and Pediococcus pentosaceus CRL 792 displayed the highest tri- and di-peptidase activities, respectively. Lactobacillus plantarum strains hydrolysed more than 60%alpha-gliadin fragments corresponding to the 31-43 and 62-75 amino acids in the protein after 2 h. None of the LAB strains alone could hydrolyse 57-89 alpha-gliadin peptide; however, the combination of L. plantarum CRL 775 and P. pentosaceus CRL 792 led to hydrolysis (57%) of this peptide in 8 h. CONCLUSIONS: The capacity of LAB strains to degrade alpha-gliadin fragments was not correlated to individual peptidase activities. Several strains separately degraded the 31-43 and 62-75 alpha-gliadin fragments, while the 57-89 peptide degradation was associated with the combination of peptidase profiles from pooled LAB strains. This is the first report on the peptide hydrolase system of sourdough pediococci and its ability to reduce alpha-gliadin fragments. SIGNIFICANCE AND IMPACT OF THE STUDY: This study contributes to a better knowledge of sourdough LAB proteolytic system and its role in the degradation of proline-rich alpha-gliadin peptides involved in celiac disease.},

   abstract = {BACKGROUND & AIMS: Celiac disease is characterized by activation of HLA-DQ2/DQ8-restricted intestinal gluten-specific CD4(+) T cells. In particular, gluten becomes a better T-cell antigen following deamidation catalyzed by tissue transglutaminase. To date, the only available therapy is represented by adherence to a gluten-free diet. Here, we examined a new enzyme strategy to preventively abolish gluten activity. METHODS: Enzyme modifications of the immunodominant alpha-gliadin peptide p56-68 were analyzed by mass spectrometry, and peptide binding to HLA-DQ2 was simulated by modeling studies. Wheat flour was treated with microbial transglutaminase and lysine methyl ester; gliadin was subsequently extracted, digested, and deamidated. Gliadin-specific intestinal T-cell lines (iTCLs) were generated from biopsy specimens from 12 adult patients with celiac disease and challenged in vitro with different antigen preparations. RESULTS: Tissue transglutaminase-mediated transamidation with lysine or lysine methyl ester of p56-68 or gliadin in alkaline conditions inhibited the interferon gamma expression in iTCLs; also, binding to DQ2 was reduced but not abolished, as suggested by in silico analysis. Lysine methyl ester was particularly effective in abrogating the activity of gliadin. Notably, a block in the response was observed when iTCLs were challenged with gliadin extracted from flour pretreated with microbial transglutaminase and lysine methyl ester. CONCLUSIONS: Transamidation of wheat flour with a food-grade enzyme and an appropriate amine donor can be used to block the T cell-mediated gliadin activity. Considering the crucial role of adaptive immunity in celiac disease, our findings highlight the potential of the proposed treatment to prevent cereal toxicity.},

Chronic enteropathy with subsequent persistent diarrhea and associated vicious cycles of malnutrition, increased gut permeability and secondary immunodeficiency are particularly devastating in the childhood population. The major causes of chronic enteropathy differ significantly between developed countries and developing countries. In developed countries, infectious and postinfectious diarrhea as well as abnormalities in immune response including celiac disease, food-induced allergic enteropathy and idiopathic inflammatory bowel disease account for most cases of chronic enteropathy. In developing countries, syndromic persistent diarrhea associated with malnutrition and secondary immunodeficiency due to human immunodeficiency virus (HIV) infection predominate as the major causes of chronic enteropathy. These latter two causes account for a disproportionate share of the more than 2.5 million deaths of children under 5 years of age due to diarrhea each year worldwide. From a practical perspective, diagnostic evaluation of chronic enteropathy in developing countries is often limited to identifying potential causative enteropathogens and antimicrobial treatment. Proper management with an emphasis on fluid homeostasis and protocolized nutritional therapy and rehabilitation is essential to successful treatment of syndromic persistent diarrhea.},

Gluten-free products are not widely available and are usually more expensive than their gluten-containing counterparts. There is, therefore, an urgent need to develop safe and effective therapeutic alternatives, to develop high-quality gluten-free products and to investigate the potential of the bread making biotechnology following ancient protocols which include long-time fermentation by selected sourdough lactic acid bacteria. This review describes the most relevant results related to biotechnologies that use selected sourdough lactic acid bacteria and probiotics as starters for sourdough fermentation to investigate their potential to decrease the risk of gluten contamination in gluten-free products. As shown by studies in vitro on celiac intestinal tissue and in vivo on CD patients, the bacterial proteolytic activity is rather promising not only as currently demonstrated for eliminating traces of contaminant gluten but probably also in perspective for the manufacture of tolerated baked goods.},

Approved for use by the Food and Drug Administration in August 2000, capsule endoscopy is currently a first line procedure in the study of small bowel disease. This technique consists of a non-reusable swallowable capsule (length 26 x 11 mm) that acquires video images while moving through the gastrointestinal tract propelled by natural peristalsis. The main indications of capsule endoscopy are evaluation of obscure gastrointestinal bleeding, chronic anemia, and inflammatory bowel disease. Contraindications are swallowing disorders and known or suspected small bowel strictures of any etiology. Consequently, small bowel follow through is useful prior to capsule endoscopy when these lesions are suspected.},

   abstract = {OPINION STATEMENT: Lactose malabsorption is a syndrome producing constellation of symptoms, including abdominal pain, bloating, flatulence, diarrhea, and sometimes nausea and/or vomiting. Primary causes of lactose malabsorption due to loss of intestinal lactase activity include genetic/racial lactase nonpersistence, congenital lactase deficiency, and developmental lactase deficiency. Secondary lactose malabsorption can be caused by any disorder that injures the small intestinal mucosa, such as viral gastroenteritis, celiac disease, allergic (eosinophilic) gastroenteritis, and radiation enteritis. The diagnosis depends on careful clinical evaluation and is customarily confirmed with a lactose breath hydrogen test. As the symptoms are nonspecific, many adults diagnosed with lactose malabsorption actually have irritable bowel syndrome. Treatment consists of a trial of eliminating lactose-containing dairy foods, with supplementation of alternative calcium and protein sources. Commercial enzyme products containing beta-galactosidases can be prescribed to help patients digest dietary lactose. Long-term lactose restriction usually is not necessary and can lead to reduced bone mineral density.},

   abstract = {In most developed countries, gluten is currently most commonly introduced between 4 and 6 months of age, in spite of little evidence to support this practice. As for infants at risk of developing food allergies, there is clear evidence that introducing solid foods before the end of the 3rd month is detrimental and should be avoided. A recent growing body of evidence however challenges the notion that solids (and among them, gluten-containing foods) should be introduced beyond the 6th month of life. Another important aspect of gluten introduction into the diet has to do with its possible role in causing type-1 diabetes (IDDM). Recently, a large epidemiological investigation in a cohort of children at risk for IDDM found that exposure to cereals (rice, wheat, oats, barley, rye) that occurred early (< or = 3 months) as well as late (> or = 7 months) resulted in a significantly higher risk of the appearance of islet cell autoimmunity compared to the introduction between 4 and 6 months. As for celiac disease, the protective role of breastfeeding can be considered ascertained, especially the protection offered by having gluten introduced while breastfeeding is continued. Evidence is emerging that early (< or = 3 months) and perhaps even late (7 months or after) first exposure to gluten may favor the onset of celiac disease in predisposed individuals. Additionally, large amounts of gluten at weaning are associated with an increased risk of developing celiac disease, as documented in studies from Scandinavian countries. In celiac children observed in our center, we could show that breastfeeding at the time of gluten introduction delays the appearance of celiac disease and makes it less likely that its presentation is predominantly gastrointestinal. Based on current evidence, it appears reasonable to recommend that gluten be introduced in small amounts in the diet between 4 and 6 months, while the infant is breastfed, and that breastfeeding is continued for at least a further 2-3 months.},

Three of these patients had a neuropathy with or without ataxia in addition to the myopathy. The mean age at onset of the myopathic symptoms was 54 years. Ten patients had neurophysiological evidence of myopathy. Inflammatory myopathy was the most common finding on neuropathological examination. One patient had basophilic rimmed vacuoles suggestive of inclusion-body myositis. Six patients received immunosuppressive treatment in addition to starting on a gluten-free diet; five improved and one remained unchanged. Among seven patients not on immunosuppressive treatment, four showed clinical improvement of the myopathy with a gluten-free diet. The improvement was also associated with reduction or normalization of serum creatine kinase level. The myopathy progressed in one patient who refused the gluten-free diet. Myopathy may be another manifestation of gluten sensitivity and is likely to have an immune-mediated pathogenesis. A gluten-free diet may be a useful therapeutic intervention.},

   abstract = {Current nutrition recommendations, directed towards populations, are based on estimated average nutrient requirements for a target population and intend to meet the needs of most individuals within that population. They also aim at preventing common diseases such as obesity, diabetes and cardiovascular disease. For infants with specific genetic polymorphisms, e.g. some inborn errors of metabolism, adherence to current recommendations will cause disease symptoms and they need personalized nutrition recommendations. Some other monogenic polymorphisms, e.g. adult hypolactasia, are common but with varying prevalence between ethnic groups and within populations. Ages at onset as well as the degree of the resulting lactose intolerance also vary, making population-based as well as personalized recommendations difficult. The tolerable intake is best set by each individual based on symptoms. For polygenetic diseases such as celiac disease, type-1 diabetes and allergic disease, current knowledge is insufficient to suggest personalized recommendations aiming at primary prevention for all high-risk infants, although it may be justified to provide such recommendations on an individual level should the parents ask for them. New technologies such as nutrigenetics and nutrigenomics are promising tools with which current nutrition recommendations can possibly be refined and the potential of individualized nutrition be explored. It seems likely that in the future it will be possible to offer more subgroups within a population personalized recommendations.},

   abstract = {BACKGROUND: In light of the possibly preventive role of timing and amount of gluten in celiac disease, it would be helpful to have a questionnaire to assess the gluten intake in infants. AIMS: Development and validation of a food questionnaire to assess gluten consumption in healthy infants aged 0-12 months (FQ-gluten). METHODS: A food frequency questionnaire, previously developed for the Generation R study, was adapted for the assessment of gluten intake. The results of a 2-day food record (FR) were compared with the results of this FQ-gluten. RESULTS: Eighty-seven parents filled in the FR and the FQ-gluten. The number of children who consume gluten and who are breast-fed is higher, reported in the FQ-gluten. The amount of gluten is comparable from the age of 3 up to 10 months, but at 11 and 12 months a higher gluten intake is reported using the FR, probably due to a larger variety of food products not detectable by the FQ-gluten. However, there is a high agreement in the food groups (Cohens' kappa=0.6-0.8). CONCLUSIONS: This new, short, standardized, validated and easy to use FQ-gluten may be a useful instrument to assess gluten intake in infants, both at the individual and at the population level. The use of this method by investigators in other countries provides the opportunity for a better comparison of the results of gluten consumption in (co-operative) studies throughout different countries.},

We investigated the development of transglutaminase antibodies and analysed potential risk factors for coeliac disease autoimmunity in first-degree relatives of patients with type 1 diabetes. METHODS: The study was conducted by prospective observational follow-up from birth of 1,511 children at increased risk of type 1 diabetes or coeliac disease born in Germany between 1989 and 2000. Mean follow-up was to age 7.6 years. Children were tested for transglutaminase and islet autoantibodies. Children were classified as transglutaminase antibody-positive if antibodies were detected by both ELISA and radiobinding assays. RESULTS: The risk of developing transglutaminase antibodies was 4.9% by age 8 years (n=63; 95% CI, 3.7-6.1%). Transglutaminase antibodies developed at an older age than islet autoantibodies (median age, 4.9 vs 2.3 years; p<0.005), and only three children developed both transglutaminase antibodies and islet autoantibodies. Multivariate analysis indicated an increased risk of transglutaminase antibodies in children with the HLA-DRB1*03 allele (hazard ratio for heterozygous DR3, 5.5; 95% CI, 2.9-10.2; hazard ratio for homozygous DR3, 16.2; 95% CI, 6.7-39; p<0.0001) and in children with impaired uterine growth (birth weight < or = 1st percentile, hazard ratio, 3.1; 95% CI, 1.1-7.8, p=0.03). Neither breast-feeding or its duration nor the age of first exposure to gluten was associated with the risk of developing transglutaminase antibodies. CONCLUSIONS/INTERPRETATION: Coeliac disease autoimmunity is initiated later than islet autoimmunity in children who are at risk. An influence of infant nutrition on the development of coeliac disease autoimmunity could not be confirmed in this prospective study.},

Although a gluten-free diet is currently the "safe" and appropriate therapy for celiac disease, this is not always an easy and simple option as "harmful" gluten may contaminate food during the processing and preparation phases. There are also further social pressures, which might be more pressing for young celiac patients, in following a strict gluten-free diet. Therefore, a new therapeutic approaches are sought which would permit celiacs to "peacefully" coexist with gluten. Presently, the most promising looks search for genetically modified wheat lacking toxic gluten peptides and the use of oral endopeptidases in attempt to curb gluten toxicity. Recently discovered role of anti-tissue transglutaminase antibodies in celiac pathogenesis has brought a prospect for a new hypothetical therapeutic approach, an oral immunization of celiacs with xenogeneic anti-tissue transglutaminase antibodies.},

   abstract = {OBJECTIVES: We sought to define the current anatomic barriers to thoracic aortic aneurysm (TAA) stent grafting to guide future device development. METHODS: All patients presenting with TAA requiring repair were evaluated for endovascular repair during a 4-year period (2000 to 2004). The TAAs evaluated were those beginning distal to the left common carotid artery (LCCA) and ending proximal to the celiac artery. All patients in whom endovascular repair was indicated underwent cross-sectional imaging by computed tomography angiography and three-dimensional modeling of their thoracic and abdominal arterial anatomy. Patients were evaluated for endovascular TAA repair in the context of the inclusion/exclusion criteria of pivotal United States Food and Drug Administration trials of the Gore TAG and Medtronic Talent devices. Anatomic requirements included >or=20 mm of suitable proximal and distal neck length, and proximal and distal neck diameters of 20 to 42 mm. These trials allowed the use of femoral or iliac access, including the use of conduits, and permitted stent graft coverage of the left subclavian artery (LSA) after preliminary carotid-subclavian bypass. Patients rejected for medical reasons or who died during evaluation were not included in the review. RESULTS: A total of 126 patients (73 men, 53 women) with TAA located between the LCCA and celiac artery were screened for endovascular repair, and 33 (26%) were rejected for anatomic reasons. The remaining 93 patients underwent endografting (59 Talent, 34 TAG). Rejection was not significantly different by gender (16/73 men, 17/53 women, P = .22, NS). Most patients (28/33) were rejected for more than one criterion. Hostile proximal neck characteristics were the most prevalent reason for disqualification, despite the ability to cover the LSA to extend the proximal seal zone. Many of these patients (16/28) also had distal neck anatomy unsuitable for grafting. Overall, 19 patients had hostile distal necks. Difficulties with vascular access (diseased or tortuous iliac arteries, or a small caliber aorta) that could not be overcome even by use of conduits occurred in a significant fraction of patients (10/33). CONCLUSIONS: Most patients with a TAA located between the LCCA and the celiac artery can be treated by endovascular repair. Patients excluded from TAA stent graft protocols for anatomic reasons most commonly have hostile proximal neck features that preclude endovascular repair with currently available devices. Transposition of arch vessels to facilitate greater use of existing stent grafts or development of new stent graft designs are needed to expand the applicability of TAA endovascular repair.},

   abstract = {Celiac disease and lactose intolerance are both relatively frequent diseases with symptoms occurring after ingestion of certain food components. In celiac disease wheat gluten and related proteins of other cereals induce an inflammatory disease of the small intestine in predisposed individuals, leading to gastrointestinal and extraintestinal symptoms. Moreover, there is an association with many other diseases and besides classic symptoms (diarrhea, weight loss, malabsorption) atypical courses with less or lacking gastrointestinal symptoms exist. The prevalence is about 1 : 100 (Europe, USA) and higher than supposed earlier. Diagnostic criteria include serologic tests (tissue transglutaminase antibody, endomysial antibody) and characteristic small bowel histology (lymphocytic infiltration, villous atrophy). Therapy is a strict and lifelong gluten-free diet. Rarely, refractory disease or lack of compliance are associated with increased risk of malignancy and worse prognosis. Lactose intolerance is attributed to low intestinal lactase levels, due to reduced genetic expression or mucosal injury and consequent intolerance to dairy products. The frequency is varying in different ethnic groups, occurring in 10-15% of Northern European people. Intensity of clinical symptoms (diarrhea, abdominal pain, bloating) depends on the amount of ingested lactose and individual activity of intestinal lactase. The capacity of lactose malabsorption can be measured using the noninvasive lactose breath hydrogen test. The treatment is based on a reduced dietary lactose intake or in case of secondary form treatment of the underlying disease.},

Cow's milk protein-sensitive enteropathy may persist in older children and shows characteristic histological features. The advent of magnification endoscopy may allow the macroscopic detection of unrecognised villous atrophy in these patients. AIM: the aim of the study was to evaluate the duodenum mucosa in older children with CM A in infancy using chromoendoscopy and magnification endoscopy. METHODS: the study involved 15 children (mean age 15 years; range 12-18) with CM A diagnosed and treated in infancy, currently on normal diet, referred to our department due to abdominal pain. The control group consisted of 8 children with abdominal pain without any evidence of allergy (mean age 15 years, range 13-18). In all patients magnification endoscopy and chromoendoscopy was performed under general anaesthesia (GIFQ 160Z, Olympus). The bulb and the descending portion of the duodenum were examined. 1% methylene blue was used for staining. Each endoscopy was recorded on DVD. Patients with celiac disease, after surgery or treated for other disorders were excluded from this part of the investigation. RESULTS: seven of 15 patients with CM A in infancy had focal villous atrophy of the descending part of the duodenum. In the control group, the villous atrophy was seen in one case. CONCLUSIONS: 1. Magnification endoscopy and chromoendoscopy are a valuable method of detecting focal villous atrophy in patients with suspected food allergy. 2. Focal villous atrophy may indicate the presence of food hypersensitivity of persisting from infancy process.},

In order to analyze the effective component, we investigated and compared the sedative and hypnotic effects of three kinds of compounds, flavonoids, saponins, and polysaccharides. Flavonoids, saponins, and polysaccharides were extracted from SZJ and orally administered to mice separately at 17 g kg(-1) per day for certain days before animal tests. Spontaneous motility and coordinated movement tests were used to observe the effects of the three kinds of compounds on the mouse behavior, and sodium barbital-induced sleeping time of mouse were tested to analyze the effects of the three kinds of compounds on the sleep of mouse. Results show that flavonoids and saponins caused a significant reduction of walking time and coordinated movement ability of mouse, significantly prolonged its sleeping time at 40 mg kg(-1), ip, subthreshold dose and increased the sleeping number of animals at 50 mg kg(-1), ip, superthreshold dose induced by coeliac injection of sodium barbital. Polysaccharides did not show any significance in all animal tests. Comparative analysis showed that saponins had a more effective sedative and hypnotic function than that of flavonoids, polysaccharides did not show a sedative and hypnotic effect.},

As it is well established that the interaction between proline-rich gluten derived peptides and the human HLA-DQ2 molecules induces immune responses that lead to disease development, we have now designed a series of gluten peptides in which proline residues were replaced by azidoprolines. These peptides were found to bind to HLA-DQ2 with an affinity similar to that of the natural gluten peptide. Moreover, some of these peptides were found to be non-immunogenic and block gluten induced immune responses. These can thus serve as lead compounds for the development of HLA-DQ2 blocker peptides.},

   abstract = {Wheat starch is used to make baked products for celiac patients in several European countries but is avoided in the United States because of uncertainty about the amounts of associated grain storage (gluten) proteins. People with celiac disease (CD) must avoid wheat, rye, and barley proteins and products that contain them. These proteins are capable of initiating damage to the absorptive lining of the small intestine in CD patients, apparently as a consequence of undesirable interactions with the innate and adaptive immune systems. In this study, starch surface-associated proteins were extracted from four commercial wheat starches, fractionated by high-performance liquid chromatography and gel electrophoresis, and identified by tandem mass spectrometry analysis. More than 150 proteins were identified, many of which (for example, histones, purothionins, and glutenins) had not been recognized previously as starch-associated. The commercial starches were analyzed by the R-5 enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay method to estimate the amount of harmful gluten protein present. One of these starches had a low gluten content of 7 ppm and actually fell within the range proposed as a new Codex Alimentarius Standard for naturally gluten-free foods (maximum 20 ppm). This low level of gluten indicates that the starch should be especially suitable for use by celiac patients, although wheat starches with levels up to 100 ppm are deemed safe in the proposed Codex standards.},

These products contain low amounts of residual gluten and it has been questioned whether they are safe for coeliac disease patients. AIM: To investigate whether coeliac disease patients can safely consume wheat-based starch hydrolysate products. METHODS: This randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled, prospective follow-up study involved 90 coeliac disease patients in remission randomized to consume glucose syrups, maltodextrins or placebo for 24 weeks. Small bowel mucosal morphology and inflammation, symptoms, coeliac serology and malabsorption laboratory data were evaluated at baseline and at the end of the study. RESULTS: Daily ingestion of wheat-based starch hydrolysates, glucose syrups and maltodextrins, had no deleterious effect on small-bowel mucosal villous architecture or inflammation in coeliac disease patients when compared to the placebo group. Neither were there any significant differences in gastrointestinal symptoms, serology or malabsorption parameters after 24 weeks. CONCLUSIONS: Wheat-based starch hydrolysates, glucose syrups and maltodextrins did not have harmful effect on coeliac disease patients. Coeliac patients can thus safely continue to consume these products.},

   abstract = {OBJECTIVE: There is evidence for the long-term safety of oats as part of a gluten-free diet in coeliac disease (CD). Oats is generally processed by kilning, which theoretically may change its antigenic properties and be the reason that it is tolerated by patients with CD. The aim of this study was to investigate the suitability of large amounts of unkilned oats, comparing its use with kilned oats in adult coeliac patients. MATERIAL AND METHODS: The study group included 13 men and 19 women with CD in remission. The goal of daily intake of oats was 100 g during one year. These patients using oats as part of their gluten-free diet were randomized to two treatment groups. One group used regular oats and the other unkilned oats. After 6 months the patients changed the treatment groups. Food intake, symptoms, histology of the small intestine and the levels of endomysial antibodies were noted. RESULTS: No marked changes were found in the duodenal biopsies, in the levels of endomysial antibodies or in the well-being of the patients. Compliance with the diet did not change during the follow-up. CONCLUSIONS: Large amounts of both unkilned and regular kilned oats are well tolerated by adult patients with CD. Oats is therefore not harmful, even in its unkilned form, which indicates that its antigenic nature is not changed by common industrial food processing in such a way that would prevent the provoking of CD.},

To compare dietary intakes of people with CD to the dietary intake of the general population. The nutritional contribution of gluten-free products (GFPs) and current purchasing trends was also evaluated. SUBJECTS/METHODS: 106 patients were invited to participate via post. Three-day food diary to assess intake and a short simple questionnaire that looked at purchasing trends of GFP. RESULTS: Forty-nine patients returned the food diary and 48 returned the questionnaire. Patients were found to have a low intake of energy, non-starch polysaccharides (NSPs), vitamin D and calcium. They were obtaining a significantly lower proportion of energy from fat and a significantly higher proportion of energy from protein than the DRVs (P<0.05). Intake was comparable to the general population for most nutrients, except they had a significantly greater intake of protein, a lower intake of fat and a significantly lower intake of vitamin D (P<0.05). Specialist GFP, especially those obtained on prescription, were an important source of energy, carbohydrate, NSP, calcium and iron. CONCLUSIONS: Patients with CD are at risk of having an inadequate intake of calcium, NSP and vitamin D. Specialist GFP, which were obtained on prescription, helped patients get a balanced diet and without these patients would be at an increased risk of many deficiencies.},

Here, using rectal protein challenge, we investigated the local inflammatory reaction to gluten and CM protein in adult patients with CD in remission. Rectal challenges with wheat gluten and dried CM powder were performed in 20 patients with CD and 15 healthy controls. Fifteen hours after challenge the mucosal reaction was recorded by the mucosal patch technique with measurements of local release of neutrophil and eosinophil granule constituents; myeloperoxidase (MPO) and eosinophil cationic protein (ECP). We measured the mucosal production of nitric oxide (NO) simultaneously. Six of the patients who reacted to CM were also challenged with alpha-lactalbumin and casein. In 18 of 20 patients gluten challenge induced neutrophil activation defined as increased MPO release and increased NO synthesis. Ten of these 20 patients showed a similarly strong inflammatory reaction to CM challenge. Six of the CM sensitive patients were challenged with specific CM proteins: casein and alpha-lactalbumin. Casein, in contrast to alpha-lactalbumin, induced an inflammatory response similar to that produced by CM. A mucosal inflammatory response similar to that elicited by gluten was produced by CM protein in about 50% of the patients with coeliac disease. Casein, in particular, seems to be involved in this reaction.},

   abstract = {BACKGROUND: Coeliac disease is a common, autoimmune disorder, for which the only treatment is lifelong adherence to a gluten-free diet. This study evaluates the economic burden of adhering to a gluten-free diet. METHODS: A market basket of products identified by name brand, weight or package size for both regular wheat-based products and gluten-free counterparts was developed. The differences in price between purchase venues, both type of store (general grocery store, an upscale grocery store and a health food store and four internet-based grocery sites) and region was also analysed. RESULTS: Availability of gluten-free products varied between the different venues, regular grocery stores carried 36%, while upscale markets carried 41%, and health food stores 94%, compared with 100% availability on the internet. Overall, every gluten-free product was more expensive than their wheat-based counterpart (P <or= 0.05). Bread and pasta was twice as expensive as their wheat-based counterparts. Cost was affected more by shopping venue than geographic location. CONCLUSIONS: This study demonstrated that gluten-free foods have poor availability and are more expensive than their gluten-containing counterparts. The impact of these findings on dietary compliance and the quality of life needs to be addressed.},

   abstract = {INTRODUCTION: Coeliac disease is a common but often under diagnosed condition with important complications. It is due to immune-mediated gluten intolerance and may present in a number of ways. It has become more frequently diagnosed due to the recognition of the atypical presentations. In recent years, more sensitive and specific serological markers have been developed but the gold standard of diagnosis remains duodenal biopsy. Compliance with a strict, lifelong gluten-free diet is the cornerstone of management, improving symptoms and reducing complications of the disease. SOURCES OF DATA: For this review, we focused on papers published on coeliac disease in recent years. Particular emphasis was given to clinical papers examining new methods for the diagnosis of coeliac disease or newer therapies for managing complications. The main source was PubMed and the major gastroenterology journals. AREAS OF AGREEMENT: Coeliac disease is more common than once thought with a prevalence of around 1%. Diagnosis should always be confirmed with a duodenal biopsy. Management of coeliac disease with a gluten-free diet remains the cornerstone of treatment. AREAS OF CONTROVERSY: Some complications of coeliac disease, especially neurological, are not widely accepted despite growing support from the literature. Management of enteropathy-associated lymphoma has been difficult, and the optimal therapy is not known. GROWING POINTS: Current understanding is such that coeliac disease is the most widely understood autoimmune condition. 'Atypical' presentations are becoming the most common presenting features of coeliac disease. AREAS TIMELY FOR DEVELOPING RESEARCH: Alternatives to the gluten-free diet are about to go into clinical studies. Similarly, better serological screening tests may obviate the need for duodenal biopsy. This review will try to summarize the current understanding of coeliac disease with regard to diagnosis, management, complications and future perspectives.},

   abstract = {The gluten analysis of foods has long had limitations, which have precluded food standards authorities from issuing standards for gluten-free foods based on final gluten content. The Codex Alimentarius and the Food and Drug Administration have taken steps towards such standards in which they favour the R5-enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay for gluten analysis. If this method is to be widely employed, its limitations should be recognised. Above all, it should be noted the ability of R5-enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay, and other methods, to measure gluten's toxicity toward celiac disease patients is not validated clinically. Gluten is a complex mixture of proteins and its toxicity is not fully understood. Analytical methods are a valuable tool in the definition of gluten-free foods, but they should be employed with appropriate caveats in ensuring the safety of the foods.},

   abstract = {OBJECTIVE: To evaluate the rectal mucosal response to gluten as an indication of gluten sensitivity in patients with primary Sjogren's syndrome (pSS). MATERIAL AND METHODS: Rectal challenges with wheat gluten were performed in 20 patients with pSS and 18 healthy control subjects. Fifteen hours after challenge the mucosal production of nitric oxide (NO) was measured. RESULTS: Five patients with pSS had a significant increase in the luminal release of NO after the rectal gluten challenge, indicating gluten sensitivity. All were HLA-DQ2 and/or -DQ8-positive. Two of the patients with increased NO had antibodies against transglutaminase and a duodenal biopsy showed an absolutely flat mucosa consistent with coeliac disease in one of the patients. Before gluten challenge, 15 of the Sjogren's syndrome (SS) patients reported gastrointestinal symptoms, and 8 reported intolerance to various food products. No correlation was found between gluten sensitivity and self-reported food intolerance or gastrointestinal symptoms. CONCLUSIONS: Rectal mucosal inflammatory response after gluten challenge is often seen in patients with pSS, signifying gluten sensitivity. However, this reactivity is not necessarily linked to coeliac disease.},

   abstract = {INTRODUCTION: Patients with primary Sjogren's syndrome (pSS) are reported to have a variety of gastrointestinal symptoms partly attributed to an overrepresentation of celiac disease. We have observed that irritable bowel syndrome (IBS)-like symptoms are frequent complaints in this patient group. Allergic manifestations to various drugs are also common in pSS. A role of food allergy in IBS has been proposed. OBJECTIVE: This study is aimed at evaluating the mucosal response to rectal challenge with cow's milk protein (CM) in patients with pSS and relates possible CM reactivity to their intestinal symptoms. METHODS: A rectal challenge with CM was performed in 21 patients with pSS and 18 healthy controls. Fifteen hours after challenge the mucosal production of nitric oxide (NO) and the release of myeloperoxidase (MPO) as signs of mucosal inflammatory reaction were measured using the mucosal patch technique. RESULTS: Eight out of 21 patients with pSS had a definite increase of mucosal NO synthesis and the luminal release of MPO after rectal CM challenge. This sign of milk sensitivity was not linked to IgG/IgA antibodies to milk proteins. The symptoms for IBS according to Rome III criteria were fulfilled in 13 patients. All patients who were CM sensitive suffered from IBS. In a small open study, patients reactive to CM reported an improvement of intestinal symptoms on a CM-free diet. CONCLUSION: A rectal mucosal inflammatory response after CM challenge is seen in 38% of patients with pSS as a sign of CM sensitivity. IBS-like symptoms were common in pSS, linked to CM sensitivity.},

   abstract = {Wheat gliadin induces severe intestinal symptoms and small-bowel mucosal damage in coeliac disease patients. At present, the only effective treatment for the disease is a strict life-long gluten-free diet. In this study we investigated whether probiotics Lactobacillus fermentum or Bifidobacterium lactis can inhibit the toxic effects of gliadin in intestinal cell culture conditions. The ability of live probiotics to inhibit peptic-tryptic digested gliadin-induced damage to human colon cells Caco-2 was evaluated by measuring epithelial permeability by transepithelial resistance, actin cytoskeleton arrangements by the extent of membrane ruffling and expression of tight junctional protein ZO-1. B. lactis inhibited the gliadin-induced increase dose-dependently in epithelial permeability, higher concentrations completely abolishing the gliadin-induced decrease in transepithelial resistance. The same bacterial strain also inhibited the formation of membrane ruffles in Caco-2 cells induced by gliadin administration. Furthermore, it also protected the tight junctions of Caco-2 cells against the effects of gliadin, as evinced by the pattern of ZO-1 expression. We conclude thus that live B. lactis bacteria can counteract directly the harmful effects exerted by coeliac-toxic gliadin and would clearly warrant further studies of its potential as a novel dietary supplement in the treatment of coeliac disease.},

   abstract = {The selective CB1 receptor antagonist rimonabant is a novel weight control agent. Although CB1 receptors and binding sites are present in both the rodent central and peripheral nervous systems, including the afferent vagus nerve, the role of gut afferents in mediating anorexia following CB1R blockade is still debated. In the present study we examined rimonabant-induced anorexia in male C57BL/6J mice with subdiaphragmatic vagotomy (VGX) as well as in male Sprague-Dawley rats subjected to either subdiaphragmatic vagal deafferentation (SDA) alone or in combination with a complete celiac-superior mesenteric ganglionectomy (CGX). Irrespective of the operational procedure, rimonabant (10mg/kg) effectively reduced standard chow as well as palatable diet (ensure) intake. In conclusion, the data clearly demonstrate that neither vagal gut afferents, nor gut afferents traveling via the sympathetic nervous system, are required for rimonabant to inhibit food intake leading to the hypothesis that centrally located CB1 receptors are the prime mediators of rimonabant-induced anorexia.},

DATA SOURCES: Published articles identified through Medline using search terms such as celiac disease, gluten sensitivity, and gluten enteropathy. Additional resources were identified from personal bibliographies collected by the authors and bibliographies from gathered articles. DATA SYNTHESIS: Celiac disease is an autoimmune disorder that is characterized by intolerance to gluten and affects approximately 3 million Americans. Although the most common manifestations of the disease are gastrointestinal, including diarrhea, steatorrhea, and weight loss, the disease is a multisystem disorder. Malabsorption is common, often leading to vitamin and mineral deficiencies and resulting in anemia and osteoporosis. Diagnosis is initiated through serology testing and confirmed by intestinal biopsy. The only treatment for celiac disease is strict, lifelong adherence to a gluten-free diet, which includes avoidance of foods, prescription and nonprescription pharmaceutical products, and cosmetics containing wheat, barley, and rye. Adherence to the gluten-free diet will promote intestinal healing and symptom relief and usually prevent complications of celiac disease. CONCLUSION: Pharmacists can play an important role by identifying patients who may have celiac disease, providing information for gluten-free foods and pharmaceutical products, and encouraging adherence to the gluten-free diet.},

   abstract = {INTRODUCTION: Chronic mesenteric ischemia (CMI) is an uncommon disorder. Traditional treatment consists of open surgical (OS) revascularization. We report a case of CMI treated with percutaneous angioplasty and stenting. CASE REPORT: A 77-year-old-woman reported a history of postprandial abdominal pain, weight loss, asthenia, and anorexia. On physical examination, the only relevant sign was systolic murmur. Oral panendoscopy showed chronic atrophic gastritis and patchy intestinal metaplasia with Helicobacter pylori colonization; rectal sigmoidoscopy showed colonic diverticula. Abdominal ultrasound color-flow imaging confirmed superior mesenteric artery (SMA) stenosis > 70%. Angiography confirmed proximal SMA subocclusion and celiac trunk stenosis of 50%. Percutaneous angioplasty and stenting were carried out. The patient made an immediate recovery and remains without postprandial pain. DISCUSSION: CMI due to atherosclerotic occlusive disease was first reported in 1936 and is a relatively uncommon disorder. This entity usually occurs in patients over 60 years of age with other atherosclerotic symptoms. CMI presents with postprandial abdominal pain, anorexia due to <<fear of food>>, and weight loss. Despite high perioperative morbidity and mortality rates, OS revascularization has traditionally been the treatment of choice. The most frequent indications include pain relief, improvement of nutritional status, and prevention of intestinal infarction. Endovascular therapy seems to be a valid alternative, mainly in high-risk patients, with good immediate and medium-term results.},

   abstract = {BACKGROUND & AIMS: The extensive infiltration of CD8(+) T cells in the intestinal mucosa of celiac disease (CD) patients is a hallmark of the disease. We identified a gliadin peptide (pA2) that is selectively recognized by CD8(+) T cells infiltrating intestinal mucosa of HLA-A2(+) CD patients. Herein, we investigated the phenotype, the tissue localization, and the effector mechanism of cells responsive to pA2 by using the organ culture of CD intestinal mucosa. The target of pA2-mediated cytotoxicity was also investigated by using the intestinal epithelial cell lines Caco2 and HT29, A2(+) and A2(-), respectively, as target cells. METHODS: Jejunal biopsy specimens from CD patients were cultured in vitro with pA2, and cellular activation was evaluated by immunohistochemistry and cytofluorimetric analysis. Cytotoxicity of pA2-specific, intestinal CD8(+) T cells was assayed by granzyme-B and interferon-gamma release and by apoptosis of target cells. RESULTS: pA2 challenge of A2(+) CD mucosa increased the percentage of CD8(+)CD25(+) and of CD80(+) cells in the lamina propria, the former mainly localized beneath the epithelium, as well as the number of terminal deoxynucleotidyltransferase-mediated dUTP nick-end labeling-positive cells (TUNEL(+)) in the epithelium. Intraepithelial CD3(+) cells and enterocyte expression of Fas were also increased. CD8(+)CD25(+) and CD8(+)FASL(+) T cells were significantly increased in cell preparations from biopsy specimens cultured with pA2. CD8(+) T-cell lines released both granzyme-B and interferon-gamma following recognition of pA2 when presented by Caco2 and not by HT29. CONCLUSIONS: These data indicate that gliadins contain peptides able to activate, through a TCR/HLA class I interaction, CD8-mediated response in intestinal CD mucosa and to induce the enterocyte apoptosis.},

   abstract = {OBJECTIVES: A retrospective study was performed to identify optimal factors affecting outcomes after open revascularization for chronic mesenteric ischemia. METHODS: All patients who underwent open surgery for chronic mesenteric ischemia from 1987 to 2006 were reviewed. Patients with acute mesenteric ischemia or median arcuate ligament syndrome were excluded. Mortality, recurrent stenosis, and symptomatic recurrence were analyzed using logistic regression, and univariate and multivariate analysis. RESULTS: We identified 80 patients (69% women, 31% men). Mean age was 64 years (range, 31-86 years). Acute-on-chronic symptoms were present in 26%. Presenting symptoms included postprandial pain (91%), weight loss (69%), and food fear and diarrhea (25%). Preoperative imaging demonstrated severe (>70%) stenosis of the superior mesenteric artery in 75 patients (24 occluded), the celiac axis in 63 (20 occluded), and the inferior mesenteric artery in 53 (20 occluded). Multivessel disease was present in 72 patients (90%), and 40 (50%) underwent multivessel reconstruction. Revascularization was achieved by endarterectomy in 37 patients, mesenteric bypass in 29, and combined procedures in 14. Concurrent aortic reconstruction was required in 13 patients (16%). Three hospital deaths occurred (3.8%). Mean follow-up was 3.8 years (range, 0-17.2 years). One- and 5-year survival was 92.2% and 64.5%. Mortality was associated with age (P = .019) and renal insufficiency (P = .007), but not by clinical presentation. Symptom-free survival was 89.7% and 82.1% at 1 and 5 years, respectively. Symptoms requiring reintervention occurred in nine patients (11%) at a mean of 29 months (range, 5-127 months). Multivariate analysis showed that freedom from recurrent symptoms correlated with endarterectomy for revascularization (5.2% vs 27.6%; hazard ratio, 0.20; 95% confidence interval, 0.04-0.92; P = .02). CONCLUSION: For open surgical candidates, endarterectomy appears to provide the most durable long-term symptom relief in patients with chronic mesenteric ischemia.},

   abstract = {Celiac disease is a multifactorial disorder and provides a privileged model to decipher how the interplay between environmental and genetic factors can alter mucosal tolerance to a food antigen, lead to chronic intestinal inflammation, and ultimately promote T-cell lymphomagenesis. Here we summarize how HLA-DQ2/8 molecules, the main genetic risk factor for this disease can orchestrate a CD4(+) T-cell adaptive immune response against gluten, and discuss recent data which shed light on the innate and adaptive immune stimuli that collaborate to induce a proinflammatory TH1 response, a massive expansion of intraepithelial lymphocytes, and a cytolytic attack of the epithelium. The intestinal immune response driven in genetically predisposed patients by chronic exposure to gluten emerges as the pathological counterpart of normal acute intestinal responses to intracellular pathogens.},

   abstract = {BACKGROUND: Coeliac disease is caused by an immune response to gluten. As gluten proteins are proline rich they are resistant to enzymatic digestion in the gastrointestinal tract, a property that probably contributes to the immunogenic nature of gluten. AIMS: This study determined the efficiency of gluten degradation by a post-proline cutting enzyme, Aspergillus niger prolyl endoprotease (AN-PEP), in a dynamic system that closely mimics the human gastrointestinal tract (TIM system). METHODS: Two experiments were performed. In the first, a slice of bread was processed in the TIM system with and without co-administration of AN-PEP. In the second, a standard fast food menu was used. Samples of the digesting meals were taken from the stomach, duodenum, jejunum and ileum compartments at time zero until 4 hours after the start of the experiment. In these samples the levels of immunogenic peptides from gliadins and glutenins were assessed by monoclonal antibody-based competition assays, Western blot analysis and proliferation T-cell assays. RESULTS: AN-PEP accelerated the degradation of gluten in the stomach compartment to such an extent that hardly any gluten reached the duodenum compartment. CONCLUSION: AN-PEP is capable of accelerating the degradation of gluten in a gastrointestinal system that closely mimics in-vivo digestion. This implies that the co-administration of AN-PEP with a gluten-containing meal might eliminate gluten toxicity, thus offering patients the possibility of abandoning (occasionally) their strict gluten-free diet.},

   abstract = {BACKGROUND: In celiac disease patients, peptides derived from dietary gluten are recognized by HLA-DQ2-restricted CD4(+) T cells, which results in inflammation. Such immune-stimulatory peptides are found in both gliadins and glutenins. Monoclonal antibodies (mAbs) against these peptides can be used to screen food for the presence of such peptides. OBJECTIVE: We aimed to determine the specificity of 5 mAbs raised against T cell stimulatory peptides found in alpha- and gamma-gliadins and in low- and high-molecular-weight glutenins and to compare it with the specificity of patient-derived T cells. DESIGN: The reactivity of the mAbs with gluten peptides, enzymatic gluten digests, and intact gluten proteins was determined and compared with that of gluten-specific T cells by using a combination of immunologic and biochemical techniques. Furthermore, the reactivity of the mAbs with gluten homologues in barley, rye, and oat was determined. RESULTS: The specificity of the mAbs largely overlaps with that of gluten-specific T cells. Moreover, mAbs detect several homologous peptides present in gluten proteins. All except the LMW-specific mAbs also detect storage proteins present in barley and rye, whereas the gamma-gliadin-specific mAbs also recognize oat proteins. CONCLUSION: The mAbs raised against T cell stimulatory peptides in gliadins and glutenins allow a comprehensive screen for the presence of harmful gluten and gluten-like proteins and peptides in food products. They can thus be used to guarantee the safety of food for celiac disease patients.},

   abstract = {A persistent increase in non-virus non-alcohol related aminotransferase levels can have multiple causes, which differ in terms of prevalence and clinical importance. In the general population, the most frequent cause is non-alcoholic hepatic steatosis, which can evolve into steato-hepatitis and cirrhosis. The treatment for steatosis and non-alcoholic steato-hepatitis consists of modifying lifestyles, whereas the effectiveness of drug treatment remains to be determined. Other much less frequent (yet not rare) causes of persistent non-virus non-alcohol related elevations in aminotransferase levels are celiac disease and hemochromatosis, whereas autoimmune hepatitis, primary biliary cirrhosis, primary sclerosing cholangitis, and alpha-1-anti-trypsin deficit are rare. Given that some of these conditions are susceptible to treatment, early diagnosis is important. No epidemiological data are available for evaluating the prevalence of elevated aminotransferase levels correlated with the toxicity of drugs or other xenobiotics, including herbal products. The present document, created by a panel of experts based on a systematic review of scientific evidence, is mainly geared towards physicians working in General Medicine and Transfusion Centres, who generally represent the first contact of persons with elevated aminotransferase levels. The document includes suggestions for diagnosing causes of persistent non-virus non-alcohol related increases in aminotransferase levels, considering the frequency and response to treatment. The conditions requiring specialized visits are also indicated.},

   abstract = {BACKGROUND AND AIMS: Celiac disease is a permanent intolerance to gluten prolamins from wheat, barley, rye and, in some patients, oats. Partially digested gluten peptides produced in the digestive tract cause inflammation of the small intestine. High throughput, immune-based assays using monoclonal antibodies specific for these immunotoxic peptides would facilitate their detection in food and enable monitoring of their enzymatic detoxification. Two monoclonal antibodies, G12 and A1, were developed against a highly immunotoxic 33-mer peptide. The potential of each antibody for quantifying food toxicity for celiac patients was studied. METHODS: Epitope preferences of G12 and A1 antibodies were determined by ELISA with gluten-derived peptide variants of recombinant, synthetic or enzymatic origin. RESULTS: The recognition sequences of G12 and A1 antibodies were hexameric and heptameric epitopes, respectively. Although G12 affinity for the 33-mer was superior to A1, the sensitivity for gluten detection was higher for A1. This observation correlated to the higher number of A1 epitopes found in prolamins than G12 epitopes. Activation of T cell from gluten digested by glutenases decreased equivalently to the detection of intact peptides by A1 antibody. Peptide recognition of A1 included gliadin peptides involved in the both the adaptive and innate immunological response in celiac disease. CONCLUSIONS: The sensitivity and epitope preferences of the A1 antibody resulted to be useful to detect gluten relevant peptides to infer the potential toxicity of food for celiac patients as well as to monitor peptide modifications by transglutaminase 2 or glutenases.},

   abstract = {BACKGROUND: Celiac disease is an immune-mediated enteropathy caused by the ingestion of gluten, a protein fraction found in certain cereals. Immunotoxic gluten peptides that are recalcitrant to degradation of digestive enzymes appear to trigger celiac syndromes. A 33-mer peptide from alpha-2 gliadin has been identified as a principal contributor to gluten immunotoxicity. A gluten-free diet is the usual first therapy for celiac disease patients; therefore, the characterization and quantification of the toxic portion of the gluten in foodstuffs is crucial to avoid celiac damage. OBJECTIVE: We aimed to develop immunologic assays as a novel food analysis tool for measuring cereal fractions that are immunotoxic to celiac disease patients. DESIGN: The design focused on the production of monoclonal antibodies against the gliadin 33-mer peptide and the development of enzyme-linked immunosorbent assays (ELISAs) and Western blot analysis with the use of novel antibodies. RESULTS: A sandwich ELISA method showed a detection limit for wheat, barley, and rye of <1 ppm prolamine. However, the method required a sample that was > or =1 order of magnitude greater for the detection of low-toxic oats, and there was no signal with the safe cereals maize and rice. A competitive ELISA method was also developed for detection of the toxic peptide in hydrolyzed food, which had a detection limit of <0.5 ppm gliadin. CONCLUSIONS: Both ELISAs designed for use with the toxic gliadin 33-mer peptide suggested a high correlation between the presence of the peptide and the amount of cereal that was toxic to celiac disease patients. The sensitivity was significantly higher than that of equivalent methods recognizing other gluten epitopes.},

   abstract = {Celiac disease is a gluten-sensitive enteropathy that affects as much as 1% of the population. Patients with celiac disease should maintain a lifelong gluten-free diet, in order to avoid serious complications and consequences. It is essential to have methods of analysis to reliably control the contents of gluten-free foods, and there is a definitive need for an assay that is easy to use, and can be used on site, to facilitate the rapid testing of incoming raw materials or monitoring for gluten contamination, by industries generating gluten-free foods. Here, we report on the development of an electrochemical immunosensor exploiting an antibody raised against the putative immunodominant celiac disease epitope, for the measurement of gliadin content and potential celiac toxicity of a foodstuff. To develop the gliadin immunosensor, we explored the use of two surface chemistries, based on the use of dithiols, 22-(3,5-bis((6-mercaptohexyl)oxy)phenyl)-3,6,9,12,15,18,21-heptaoxadocosanoic acid (1) and 1,2-dithiolane-3-pentanoic acid (thioctic acid) (2), for anchoring of the capture antibody. The different surface chemistries were evaluated in terms of time required for formation of self-assembled monolayers, stability, susceptibility to nonspecific binding, reproducibility, and sensitivity. The thioctic acid self-assembled monolayer took more than 100 h to attain a stable surface and rapidly destabilized following functionalization with capture antibody, while the heptaoxadocosanoic acid surface rapidlyformed (less than 3 h) and was stable for at least 5 days, stored at room temperature, following antibody immobilization. Both surface chemistries gave rise to highly sensitive immunosensors, with detection limits of 5.5 and 11.6 ng/mL being obtained for 1 and 2, respectively, with nonspecific binding of just 2.7% of the specific signal attained. The immunosensors were extremely reproducible, with RSD of 5.2 and 6.75% obtained for 1 and 2 (n = 5, 30 ng/mL), respectively. Finally, the immunosensor was applied to the analysis of commercial gluten-free and gluten-containing raw and processed foodstuffs, and excellent correlation achieved when its performance compared to that of an ELISA.},

   abstract = {Celiac disease is becoming an increasingly recognized autoimmune enteropathy caused by a permanent intolerance to gluten. Once thought to be a rare disease of childhood characterized by diarrhea, celiac disease is actually a multisystemic disorder that occurs as a result of an immune response to ingested gluten in genetically predisposed individuals. Screening studies have revealed that celiac disease is most common in asymptomatic adults in the United States. Although considerable scientific progress has been made in understanding celiac disease and in preventing or curing its manifestations, a strict gluten-free diet is the only treatment for celiac disease to date. Early diagnosis and treatment, together with regular follow-up visits with a dietitian, are necessary to ensure nutritional adequacy and to prevent malnutrition while adhering to the gluten-free diet for life. The purpose of this review is to provide clinicians with current updated information about celiac disease, its diverse clinical presentation and increased prevalence, the complex pathophysiology and strong genetic predisposition to celiac disease, and its diagnosis. This review focuses in detail on the gluten-free diet and the importance of intense expert dietary counseling for all patients with celiac disease. Recent advances in the gluten-free diet include food allergen labeling as well as the US Food and Drug Administration's proposed definition of the food-labeling term gluten-free. The gluten-free diet is complex and patients need comprehensive nutrition education from a skilled dietitian.},

   abstract = {OBJECTIVES: Sweden experienced a unique epidemic of celiac disease in children <2 years of age. The epidemic was partly explained by changes in infant feeding over time and indicated a multifactorial pathogenesis. The main aim of this study was to analyze celiac disease risk in epidemic and postepidemic birth cohorts up to preschool age, to explore further the opportunity for primary prevention. METHODS: A population-based incidence register of celiac disease in children covering the entire nation from 1998 to 2003 and part of the country back to 1973 was analyzed. European Society for Pediatric Gastroenterology, Hepatology, and Nutrition diagnostic criteria for celiac disease were used. The annual incidence rate for each age group and the cumulative incidence according to age for each birth cohort were calculated. RESULTS: A considerable difference in cumulative incidences of celiac disease at comparable ages was demonstrated between birth cohorts from the epidemic and postepidemic periods. The difference persisted during the preschool years, although it decreased somewhat with age. During the last years of the follow-up period, there was again a successive increase in incidence rate among children <2 years of age. CONCLUSIONS: The difference in celiac disease risk between birth cohorts at comparable ages suggests an opportunity for primary prevention. This highlights the importance of further exploring the role of infant feeding and exogenous factors besides dietary gluten that might initiate or prevent disease development. Moreover, on the basis of postepidemic incidence trends, we speculate that the Swedish epidemic might not have been as unique as thought previously, although its magnitude was striking.},

However, knowledge is limited regarding their own perspectives and experiences of managing the disease and the prescription of a gluten-free diet. The aim of this study was to explore how adolescents with coeliac disease perceive and manage their everyday lives in relation to a gluten-free diet. METHODS: In total, 47 adolescents with coeliac disease, divided into 10 focus groups, were interviewed. In the qualitative analysis, themes emerged to illustrate and explain the adolescents' own perspectives on life with a gluten-free diet. RESULTS: The probability of compliance with the gluten-free diet was comprised by insufficient knowledge of significant others, problems with the availability and sensory acceptance of gluten-free food, insufficient social support and their perceived dietary deviance. Three different approaches to the gluten-free diet emerged: compliers, occasional noncompliers, and noncompliers. Each approach, as a coping strategy, was rational in the sense that it represented the adolescents' differing views of everyday life with coeliac disease and a prescription of a gluten-free diet. CONCLUSIONS: dolescents with coeliac disease experience various dilemmas related to the gluten-free diet. The study demonstrated unmet needs and implies empowerment strategies for optimum clinical outcomes.},

   abstract = {AIM: To determine if there is any regional celiac disease (CD) risk variation in the Swedish childhood population. METHODS: Prospective nationwide Swedish incidence register of CD in children 0-15 years of age, with the present analysis covering the period from 1998 to 2003. ESPGHAN diagnostic criteria for CD were used. Regions were classified according to the Nomenclature of Territorial Units for Statistics. The incidence rate for each region, gender, age group and year of diagnosis was calculated. RESULTS: A regional variation in CD risk was demonstrated. The childhood populations in 'West Sweden' and 'Smaland and the islands', situated in the southern part of the country, had a significantly higher incidence rate compared to in 'North Middle Sweden' and 'Stockholm', situated in the central part. This regional variation was not explained by variations in risk by gender, age at diagnosis or year of diagnosis. CONCLUSION: The Swedish regional variation in CD risk supports multifactorial disease aetiology. Continued efforts are warranted to define factors, besides gluten exposure, that modulate CD risk.},

   abstract = {The pulsed Doppler method theoretically enables human arterial blood flow (BF) to be determined in all of the abdominal-pelvic organs (BF(AP)) by subtracting the bilateral proximal femoral arterial BF from the upper abdominal aorta BF above the coeliac trunk. Evaluation of BF(AP) is a potentially useful indicator of exercise or food intake related flow distribution to organs; however, there is a lack of information regarding the physiological significance of BF(AP), and the measurements are yet to be validated. The aims of the present study are to examine the range in BF(AP) among subjects, monitor physiological day-to-day variability in BF(AP) over three different days and then determine whether mean BF(AP) (averaged over the three different measurement days) is related to body surface area (BSA). Forty healthy males (19-39 years) with a wide range of body weights (51-89 kg) were evaluated in a sitting position following a 12 h fast. The above-mentioned three conduit arteries were measured to determine BF(AP) using pulsed Doppler with spectral analysis. The mean BF(AP) was 2078 +/- 495 ml min(-1) (mean +/- SD) (range, 1153-3285 ml min(-1)), which is in agreement with a previous study that measured the sum of BF in the major part of the coeliac, mesenteric and renal arteries. The physiological day-to-day variability (mean coefficient of variation) was 14.5 +/- 10.0%. Significant (p < 0.05) positive linear relationships were observed between BF(AP) and BSA as well as body weight, which is in good agreement with the results of a previous study. The present data suggest that BF(AP) determined by three-conduit arterial hemodynamics may be a valid measurement that encompasses physiologic flow to multiple abdominal-pelvic organ systems.},

   abstract = {Recent evidence indicates that shock is accompanied by a failure of the mucosal barrier in the intestine and entry of pancreatic digestive enzymes into the wall of the intestine. To investigate the formation of cytotoxic mediators produced by enzymatic digestion of the intestine, we applied homogenates of rat small intestinal wall to human neutrophils and used flow cytometry measurements of propidium iodide uptake to determine cytotoxicity. We show that homogenates of the small intestine after ischemia by occlusion of the superior mesenteric and celiac arteries for 3 h, but not without ischemia, are cytotoxic. Digestion of homogenates of nonischemic intestinal wall with purified trypsin, chymotrypsin, or elastase, proteases normally present in the intestinal lumen, yielded cytotoxic mediators. Before cell death, we saw cell damage in the form of bleb formation and flow cytometry measurements of cell size changes due to blebbing. Cytotoxicity was prevented by serine protease inhibition with phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride (PMSF) before, but not after proteolytic digestion of the wall homogenates, indicating that enzymatic action of proteases on the homogenate is necessary for cytotoxicity. Cytotoxicity of wall homogenates digested by enzymes in the fluid collected from the lumen of the intestine was greater than digests by the individual purified proteases. Cytotoxicity is undetectable if digestive enzymes in the luminal fluid are inhibited with a combination of enzyme inhibitors PMSF and 6-amidino-2-naphthyl p-guanidinobenzoate dimethanesulfonate before addition of wall homogenates. Passage of digested intestinal wall homogenates across a hydrophobic glass-fiber filter reduced cytotoxicity. Furthermore, we found that luminal fluid itself may be cytotoxic, possibly because of digestion of ingested food. To test whether digested food can be cytotoxic, we homogenized rat food and digested it in vitro with chymotrypsin or endogenous enzymes in luminal fluid. Cytotoxicity was significantly increased after digestion of food by luminal fluid compared with luminal fluid or undigested food. These results indicate the presence of a previously unknown mechanism for hemorrhagic necrosis in shock.},

   abstract = {Rising rates of food allergies in early childhood reflect increasing failure of early immune tolerance mechanisms. There is mounting concern that the current recommended practice of delaying complementary foods until 6 months of age may increase, rather than decrease, the risk of immune disorders. Tolerance to food allergens appears to be driven by regular, early exposure to these proteins during a 'critical early window' of development. Although the timing of this window is not clear in humans, current evidence suggests that this is most likely to be between 4 and 6 months of life and that delayed exposure beyond this period may increase the risk of food allergy, coeliac disease and islet cell autoimmunity. There is also evidence that other factors such as favourable colonization and continued breastfeeding promote tolerance and have protective effects during this period when complementary feeding is initiated. This discussion paper explores the basis for concern over the current recommendation to delay complementary foods as an approach to preventing allergic disease. It will also examine the growing case for introducing complementary foods from around 4 months of age and maintaining breastfeeding during this early feeding period, for at least 6 months if possible.},

DESIGN: A pilot study during the period March-May 2005, filling out a questionnaire. SETTING: All nursery and primary schools in a Northern Italian region (Friuli Venezia Giulia). SUBJECTS: There were 479 eligible schools RESULTS: Global response rate was of 29.6%. In 77.5% (110/142) of the schools there were children with food-related pathologies. Programs about nutrition were carried out by 44.4% (63/142) of the schools in the previous two years; 9.5% (6/63) dealt with food-related pathologies and 57.1% (36/63) required the intervention of outside experts to have these projects realized. In the same period training courses about nutrition for teachers were conducted in 9.2% (13/142) of the schools. CONCLUSIONS: Data provide a first overview of the situation in Italy on food-related topics in children attending nursery and primary schools. Therefore many programs could not rely on funds to be developed, but had to use internal resources of the school.},

The successful application of these reagents in human diseases involving CD4+ T cells is limited. Celiac disease, an intestinal inflammation driven by mucosal CD4+ T cells recognizing wheat gluten peptides in the context of disease-associated HLA-DQ molecules, is an ideal model to test the potential clinical use of these reagents. We investigated whether gluten-specific T cells can be detected in the peripheral blood of celiac disease patients using DQ2 tetramers. Nine DQ2+ patients and six control individuals on a gluten-free diet were recruited to the study. Participants consumed 160 g of gluten-containing bread daily for 3 days. After bread-challenge, gluten-specific T cells were detectable in the peripheral blood of celiac patients but not controls both directly by tetramer staining and indirectly by enzyme-linked immunospot. These T cells expressed the beta(7) integrin indicative of gut-homing properties. Most of the cells had a memory phenotype, but many other phenotypic markers showed a heterogeneous pattern. Tetramer staining of gluten-specific T cells has the potential to be used for diagnosis of celiac disease.},

Although the elevation of hydrogen concentration above the fasting value after the administration of a test sugar is evidence of malabsorption, the level of the fasting value itself in untreated celiac patients is unknown. Therefore, we studied the fasting breath hydrogen (FBH(2)) concentration in 40 healthy controls, 35 subjects with functional bowel disorders, and 30 patients of untreated celiac disease with and without bread or wheat diet one day before the test. The fasting level of hydrogen concentration in untreated celiac patients (28.7 +/- 19.5 ppm) was significantly higher than those in healthy volunteers (9.5 +/- 3.4 ppm) and subjects with functional bowel disorders (10.6 +/- 4.5 ppm). The percentage of patients with elevated H(2) fasting levels in untreated celiac disease (82.5%) was significantly higher than that in healthy controls (10%) and subjects with functional bowel disorders (17.1%). In 30 celiac patients, studied with and without wheat-free diet one day before the test, the fasting hydrogen levels decreased from 28.7 +/- 19.5 ppm to 10.6 +/- 3.5 ppm, and becoming normal in all patients of celiac disease. Our results show that the patients of untreated celiac disease should be instructed not to eat things made up of wheat one day before hydrogen breath testing so that the normal fasting hydrogen concentration can be obtained and false-negative hydrogen breath test results can be avoided.},

In the past, oats were considered to be toxic to individuals with celiac disease and were not allowed in a gluten-free diet. However, recent evidence suggests that oats that are pure and uncontaminated with other gluten-containing grains, if taken in limited quantities, are safe for most individuals with celiac disease. For adults, up to 70 g (1/2 to 3/4 cup) of oats per day and for children, up to 25 g (1/4 cup) per day are safe to consume. These oats and oat products must fulfill the standards for a gluten-free diet set by the Canadian Food Inspection Agency and Health Canada. The Canadian Celiac Association, in consultation with Health Canada, Agriculture & Agri-Food Canada and the Canadian Food Inspection Agency, has established requirements for growing, processing, and purity testing and labelling of pure oats. These strategies have led to the production of pure, uncontaminated oats for the first time in Canada. Oats and oat products that are safe for consumption by individuals with celiac disease and dermatitis herpetiformis are now commercially available in Canada.},

   abstract = {Presently, the only effective treatment for celiac disease is a life-long gluten-free diet. In this work, we used a new mixture of selected sourdough lactobacilli and fungal proteases to eliminate the toxicity of wheat flour during long-time fermentation. Immunological (R5 antibody-based sandwich and competitive enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay [ELISA] and R5 antibody-based Western blot), two-dimensional electrophoresis, and mass spectrometry (matrix-assisted laser desorption ionization-time of flight, strong-cation-exchange-liquid chromatography/capillary liquid chromatography-electrospray ionization-quadrupole-time of flight [SCX-LC/CapLC-ESI-Q-TOF], and high-pressure liquid chromatography-electrospray ionization-ion trap mass spectrometry) analyses were used to determine the gluten concentration. Assays based on the proliferation of peripheral blood mononuclear cells (PBMCs) and gamma interferon production by PBMCs and intestinal T-cell lines (iTCLs) from 12 celiac disease patients were used to determine the protein toxicity of the pepsin-trypsin digests from fermented wheat dough (sourdough). As determined by R5-based sandwich and competitive ELISAs, the residual concentration of gluten in sourdough was 12 ppm. Albumins, globulins, and gliadins were completely hydrolyzed, while ca. 20% of glutenins persisted. Low-molecular-weight epitopes were not detectable by SCX-LC/CapLC-ESI-Q-TOF mass spectrometry and R5-based Western blot analyses. The kinetics of the hydrolysis of the 33-mer by lactobacilli were highly efficient. All proteins extracted from sourdough activated PBMCs and induced gamma interferon production at levels comparable to the negative control. None of the iTCLs demonstrated immunoreactivity towards pepsin-trypsin digests. Bread making was standardized to show the suitability of the detoxified wheat flour. Food processing by selected sourdough lactobacilli and fungal proteases may be considered an efficient approach to eliminate gluten toxicity.},

   abstract = {This review is intended to focus on the composition of oat and its therapeutic potential in the pharmacology that supports its use to cure various maladies. Oat (Avena sativa) is distinct among the cereals due to its multifunctional characteristics and nutritional profile. Recent advancement in food and nutrition has revealed the importance of its various components. It is a good source of dietary fiber especially beta-glucan, minerals and other nutrients. Oat and oat by products have been proven to be helpful in the treatment of diabetes and cardiovascular disorders. Oat bran in particular, is good source of B complex vitamins, protein, fat, minerals besides heart healthy soluble fiber beta-glucan. The beta-glucan has outstanding functional properties and is of immense importance in human nutrition. Different physiological effects of beta-glucan are related to its viscosity, attenuation of postprandial plasma glucose and insulin responses, high transport of bile acids towards lower parts of the intestinal tract and high excretion of bile acids thereby lowering of serum cholesterol levels. Moreover, it is helpful against coeliac disease. The incorporation of oat grains and oat bran in the food products improves not only the nutrition but also a therapy against various maladies.},

   abstract = {Enteropathy defines abnormalities of the small intestinal mucosa of various etiologies in which nutrition has a causal or a therapeutic role. Breast milk is the gold-standard feeding during infancy for optimal nutrition in health and the majority of diseases. Therapeutic formulae have decreased the need for enteral or parenteral support. Gastrointestinal infections are worldwide the most frequent cause of enteropathy by increasing mucosal permeability, local expression of costimulatory molecules allowing antigen penetration in the mucosa, and T-cell activation leading sometimes to disruption of oral tolerance. Concomitant malnutrition impairs not only the immunologic response but also the recovery of damaged mucosa with secondary intestinal and pancreatic enzymatic reductions. Optimal nutritional rehabilitation is the cornerstone of the management of persisting diarrhea. Celiac disease and cow's milk protein allergy are examples of chronic enteropathy. Multiple food allergies, even during breast-feeding, are increasingly reported due to an impaired development of oral tolerance. The dietary approach to allergic disease is currently evolving from passive allergen avoidance to active modulation of the immune system to (re)establish tolerance. The gastrointestinal flora provides maturational signals for the lymphoid tissue, improves balance of inflammatory cytokines, reduces bacterial invasiveness and dietary antigen load, and normalizes gut permeability. The clinical effects of nucleotides and zinc merit further clinical evaluation. Major attention has recently focused on the immune effects of dietary lipids in terms of possible prevention of allergic sensitization by downregulating inflammatory response and protecting the epithelial barrier and host-microbe interactions modifying the adherence of microbes to the mucosa.},

   abstract = {Enteropathy defines abnormalities of the small intestinal mucosa, visible with the light microscope, of various etiologies, that can be separated into acute versus chronic conditions. This review focuses on these areas in which recent progress has been made. Severe infections increase mucosal permeability and induce local expression of co-stimulatory molecules allowing antigen penetration in the mucosa, T cell activation and possible disruption of oral tolerance. Biotherapeutics are of importance in the prevention and treatment of (chronic) enteropathy of infectious origin. Celiac disease and cow's milk protein allergy are key examples of chronic enteropathy. The dietary approach to allergy has evolved to include active stimulation of the immature immune system in order to support the establishment of tolerance. Supplementation with probiotics may provide maturational signals for the lymphoid tissue and improve the balance of pro- and anti-inflammatory cytokines. Enteral polymeric feeding is effective in Crohn's disease. Dietary nucleotides may improve growth and immunity, optimize maturation, recovery and function of rapidly dividing tissue. Adequate dietary lipids are important not just for caloric value but also for immune-modulatory effects. Lipids may prevent allergic sensitization by downregulating inflammatory response (n-3 but not n-6 fatty acids) whilst protecting the epithelial barrier, regulating immune function and modifying the adherence of microbes to the mucosa, thereby contributing to host-microbe interactions.},

Four monoclonal antibodies (Abs) were prepared by immunization of animals kept on GFD with gliadin. The specificity of these Abs to decapeptides of alpha- and gamma-gliadin and omega-secalin was analyzed by the PEPSCAN technique. Repetitive sequences of alpha- and gamma-gliadin and omega-secalin containing the motifs QPFPXQ (X = Q, L, P) were recognized by all Abs tested. These Abs also frequently reacted with peptides containing the sequences QQSFPQQ, QQTFPQP, and QPFRPQ. On the basis of PEPSCAN results two Abs--8D4 and 7C6--were selected for the construction of a new ELISA kit for the detection of gliadin in food. The comparison of data obtained using the newly developed ELISA kit and commercially available ones indicated that Abs selection on the basis of their fine specificity to gliadin is useful for sensitive detection of gliadin in foods.},

She had severe skin changes with erythema, desquamation, erosions and diffuse hyperpigmentation involving the whole integument, particularly the perioral area, trunk and legs. She also had angular cheilitis, glossitis, conjunctivitis and diffuse alopecia. After treatment with a high-protein gluten-free diet and supplementation with vitamins and microelements there was a rapid improvement in the skin lesions. The severity of the skin lesions in this case can be explained by the coexistence of two metabolic diseases causing complex malnutrition.},

Our aim was to determine the presence of celiac disease and antibodies associated with celiac disease in patients with inflammatory myopathies and to investigate their relationship. Serum antigliadin, anti-tissue transglutaminase, and antiendomysial antibodies were determined in 51 patients with inflammatory myopathies. HLA-DQ2 and -DQ8 alleles were studied to assess their complementary diagnostic value. Jejunal biopsy was performed in patients with moderate to high levels of antigliadin antibodies. Patients with jejunal histology consistent with celiac disease initiated a gluten-free diet. Seventeen patients (31%) were positive for antigliadin antibodies, which were significantly more frequent in patients with inclusion-body myositis than dermatomyositis (P < 0.001). Positive status to HLA-DQ2 and/or -DQ8 did not differ between antigliadin-positive (75% and 12.5%) or -negative (60% and 15%) patients. Three of five jejunal biopsies were diagnostic for celiac disease with histological normalization after a gluten-free diet. Thus, celiac disease is more prevalent in patients with inflammatory myopathies than in the general population. Positive status to HLA-DQ2 allele, which is known to be more frequent in patients with inflammatory myopathies, could explain the high prevalence of antigliadin antibodies in this population. The diagnostic value of HLA-DQ2 or -DQ8 haplotypes to detect celiac disease in patients with inflammatory myopathy is limited.},

Indirect modalities such as barium follow-through have the disadvantage of attendant radiation exposure. Capsule endoscopy, a novel wireless method of investigation of the small bowel, has acquired an important role in both adult and paediatric medicine. RECENT FINDINGS: The clinical utility of capsule endoscopy has rapidly expanded since its approval by the Food & Drug Administration in the USA in 2001. It has developed an established role in adults, in the investigation of obscure gastrointestinal bleeding, small bowel Crohn's disease, complications of coeliac disease and surveillance of polyposis syndromes. Despite a lag in its use in paediatrics, capsule endoscopy offers an accurate and effective means of investigating the small bowel in children. It has opened up new horizons and permitted a noninvasive approach to identifying occult lesions in the small bowel of children when conventional imaging has been unhelpful. SUMMARY: This review appraises the current literature to define the clinical indications and practical aspects of capsule endoscopy that are of interest to the paediatrician.},

Investigations into the molecular pathogenesis of celiac sprue have identified the major histocompatibility complex protein HLA-DQ2 and the multi-functional enzyme transglutaminase 2 as potential pharmacological targets. Based upon the crystal structure of HLA-DQ2, we rationally designed an aldehyde-functionalized, gluten peptide analogue as a tight-binding HLA-DQ2 ligand. Aldehyde-bearing gluten peptide analogues were also designed as high-affinity, reversible inhibitors of transglutaminase 2. By varying the side-chain length of the aldehyde-functionalized amino acid, we found that the optimal transglutaminase 2 inhibitor was 5 methylene units in length, 2 carbon atoms longer than its natural glutamine substrate.},

METHODS: Three varieties of oats were tested by two in vitro assay based on the known ability of peptic-tryptic digests of coeliac-active proteins to agglutinate K562 cells and to disrupt lysosomes, respectively. RESULTS: Avenins from the Italian variety Astra and the Australian variety Mortlook were much more active than the Australian variety Lampton. Gliadin, digested in the same way, certainly displayed more activity than all three avenins, but rice (var. Roma) did not have measurable activity. CONCLUSIONS: The results indicate that some varieties of oats may be potentially harmful to individuals with coeliac disease and therefore should be excluded from the gluten-free diet required to maintain good health in coeliac disease. It is important to realize that constant, small amounts of active proteins in the diet, such as certain avenins, may prevent complete recovery of the intestinal mucosa in this disease.},

If oats is confirmed to be safe, it would be a valuable component and offer more variation in a gluten-free diet. The aim of this work was to evaluate whether avenins from different varieties of oats show different abilities in the activation of coeliac peripheral lymphocytes. MATERIAL AND METHODS: In order to assess whether the immunogenic effect of oats varies according to the cultivar, peripheral lymphocytes from 10 coeliac children were exposed to avenins from four different oats varieties: Lampton, Astra, Ava and Nave. Lymphocyte proliferation and interferon-gamma (IFN-gamma) release in the culture medium were measured as indexes of immune activation. RESULTS: All the varieties of oats tested were immunogenic, with Lampton and Ava avenins inducing lymphocyte activation similar to that activated by wheat gliadin, while Astra and Nave avenins showed less immunogenicity, but still with a measurable effect. CONCLUSIONS: There are still concerns about the suitability of including oats in a gluten-free diet. Coeliac patients consuming oats-containing food should be carefully monitored, until there is more evidence to show the safety of oats and varieties of low-toxicity oats.},

Molecules able to shift the immune response from a Th1- to a Th2-type response have been suggested as therapeutic agents for Th1 autoimmune diseases. OBJECTIVE: We sought to investigate the possibility that a decapeptide from durum wheat (p10mer, QQPQDAVQPF), which was previously shown to prevent the activation of celiac peripheral lymphocytes, may promote a shift from a Th1- to a Th2-type immune response in gluten-specific intestinal T cells of CD patients. DESIGN: Intestinal T lymphocyte lines derived from 8 children with CD were incubated with gliadin peptides both alone and simultaneously with p10mer. Cell proliferation and the production of interferon-gamma and interleukin-10 by these T cells were measured. RESULTS: The incubation of celiac intestinal T cells with deamidated gliadin peptides resulted in a significant (P < 0.008) increase in cell proliferation and interferon-gamma release, whereas the simultaneous exposure to p10mer totally abolished the cell proliferation and cytokine release. Moreover, incubation with p10mer maintained an elevated release of interleukin-10, whereas exposure of the cells to culture medium only did not. The replacement of the residues of aspartic acid in position 5 or those of alanine in position 6 in the sequence of p10mer resulted in peptides with no activity in the activation experiments. CONCLUSION: In vitro, p10mer showed the ability to shift the pathogenic immune response of a CD patient from a Th1- to a Th2-type response.},

The aim of this study was to evaluate the antagonist effect of 10mer, a decapeptide (sequence QQPQDAVQPF) from alcohol-soluble protein fraction of durum wheat, assessing its ability to prevent celiac peripheral blood lymphocytes from activation by gliadin peptides. Peripheral blood mononuclear cells (PBMC) were obtained from DQ2-positive untreated coeliac children and from healthy controls and incubated with the peptic-tryptic digest of bread wheat gliadin (GLP) and peptide 62-75 from alpha-gliadin both alone and with 10mer simultaneously. PBMC proliferation, release of pro-inflammatory Th1 cytokines interferon-gamma and tumor necrosis factor-alpha, release of immunoregulatory cytokine IL-10, and analysis of CD25 expression as indexes of lymphocytes activation were carried out. Enhanced lymphocytes activation was seen after exposure to GLP and p62-75, whereas the simultaneous incubation with 10mer inhibits the lymphocytes response. These data indicate that a peptide naturally occurring in durum wheat exerts in vitro an antagonist effect against gliadin toxicity and could have a protective effect in CD disease.},

The only available treatment for CD is the life-long withdrawal of gluten-containing foods from the diet. Complying with gluten-free diet is difficult and affects the quality of life. Therefore, alternative therapies are being investigated. In this paper, we review a new therapeutic strategy for CD, relying upon peptides that are analogs of gliadin T-cell epitopes that show the ability to down-modulate the immune response pathogenic of CD. These peptides have been obtained artificially by amino acids substitution of gliadin T-cell stimulatory sequences and an immunomodulatory sequence has been identified in the alcohol-soluble protein fraction of cultivars of durum wheat.},

   abstract = {BACKGROUND: The association between coeliac disease (CD) and neoplasms has been long established, but few data are available about the risk factors. The aim of this paper is to estimate the risk of developing a neoplasm among non diagnosed coeliac patients and to evaluate if this risk correlates with the age of patients at diagnosis of coeliac disease. METHODS: The study population consists of patients (n = 1968) diagnosed with CD at 20 Italian gastroenterology referral Centers between 1st January 1982 and 31st March 2005. RESULTS: The SIR for all cancers resulted to be 1.3; 95% CI = 1.0-1.7 p < 0.001. The specific SIRs for non Hodgkin lymphoma was 4.7; 95% CI = 2.9-7.3 p < 0.001, for the small bowel carcinoma 25; 95% CI = 8.5-51.4 p < 0.001, for non Hodgkin lymphoma 10; 95% CI = 2.7-25 p = 0.01, finally for the stomach carcinoma 3; 95% CI = 1.3-4.9 p < 0.08. The mean age at diagnosis of CD of patients that developed sooner or later a neoplasm was 47,6 +/- 10.2 years versus 28.6 +/- 18.2 years of patients who did not. CONCLUSION: Coeliac patients have an increased risk of developing cancer in relation to the age of diagnosis of CD. This risk results higher for malignancies of the gastro-intestinal sites. An accurate screening for tumors should be performed in patients diagnosed with CD in adulthood and in advancing age.},

We followed 1,757 celiac patients for a total period of 31,801 person-years, collecting data about the frequency of gluten intake and the incidence of the enteropathy-associated T-cell lymphoma. Out of the nine celiac patients who developed an intestinal lymphoma [standard morbidity ratio of 6.42 (95% CI = 2.9-12.2; P < 0.001)], only two kept a strict gluten-free diet after the diagnosis of celiac disease and developed the malignancy after the peridiagnosis period of 3 years, dropping therefore the standard morbidity ratio to 0.22 (95%CI = 0.02-0.88; P < 0.001). The risk of developing an intestinal lymphoma for the celiac patients that used to have dietary gluten was significant (X(2 )= 4.8 P = 0.01). These results show that a strict gluten-free diet is protective towards the development of enteropathy-associated T-cell lymphoma.},

We characterized postprandial BF responses in these arteries in the initial phase of digestion. After a baseline measurement in the overnight fasting state, healthy subjects ingested solid food (300 kcal) and water ad libitum within 5 min (4.6 +/- 0.2 min, means +/- SE), and then rested for 60 min in the postprandial state. Mean blood velocities (MBVs) in CA (n = 7) and SMA (n = 9) and mean arterial pressure (MAP) were measured throughout the procedure. The MAP was divided by the MBV to yield the resistance index (RI). The MBV in CA and SMA started increasing within a minute after beginning the meal. The MBV in CA rapidly reached its peak increase (60 +/- 8% change from baseline) at 5 +/- 1 min after the start of the meal, whereas the MBV in SMA gradually reached its peak increase (134 +/- 14%) at 41 +/- 4 min after the start of the meal, reflecting a decrease in the RI for both CA and SMA. These findings suggested an earlier increase in CA and SMA MBV, implying that the increase of BF in some parts of the small intestine precedes the arrival of chyme.},

After 5 min of baseline measurement, 15 healthy subjects repeated chewing and expectorating the FOOD or WAX every 20 s for 4 min followed by 10 min of recovery measurement. We measured the mean blood velocity (MBV) in the CA and SMA. The baseline MBVs in the CA and SMA did not differ between the FOOD and WAX trials. The MBV in the CA was lower than baseline at the 1st min of chewing in both trials. It was higher than baseline at the 3rd min of FOOD chewing, whereas it did not increase during and after WAX chewing. The MBV in the CA was higher in the FOOD trial than in the WAX trial at the 3rd min of chewing and thereafter. In contrast, the MBV in the SMA did not change throughout the protocols. These results suggest that the taste of food plays a role in meal-induced hyperemia in the CA but not the SMA.},

   abstract = {In 1997, a German group demonstrated that the antigen of the biomarker EMA (endomysial antibodies) in coeliac disease is a calcium-dependent thiol enzyme, transglutaminase type 2 (TG2). This most important discovery opened up an exciting field of research aimed at a better understanding of the pathogenesis of coeliac disease, a T-cell-driven autoimmune disorder with a prevalence of about 1%. The accidental activation of TG2, possibly caused by a stress-induced local deficiency of zinc in the intestinal wall, might play a key role where the enzyme catalyzes an atypical deamidation of specific glutamine residues of food gliadins. The genetic contribution is HLA DQ2 or DQ8, which can form a complex with the TG2-modified gliadin residues, resulting in an immune response with the formation of antibodies against both gliadin and the enzyme. Indeed, the immunopathogenesis of coeliac disease can now be recognized partly at the molecular level. Progress has already improved the opportunities for laboratory diagnostics and, hopefully, new ways of treating and preventing coeliac disease will become available. These exciting developments might stimulate research within other fields of autoimmune disorders. With its focus on TG2, this review highlights some of the intriguing mechanisms of the pathogenesis of coeliac disease, such as the structure of the neo-antigen, the involvement of calcium and zinc, and the effects of coeliac antibodies on TG2 activity. Moreover, the many pitfalls due to dubious laboratory practice are addressed, as is the potential when a fundamental biological mechanism is understood at the molecular level.},

In the current study, the prices of gluten-free foods and regular (gluten-containing) foods were compared to determine if and to what extent gluten-free products are more expensive. METHODS: Prices were compared for all food products labelled "gluten-free" and comparable gluten-containing food items in the same group available at two large-chain general grocery stores. The unit cost of each food, calculated as the price in dollars per 100 grams of each product, was calculated for purposes of comparison. RESULTS: All 56 gluten-free products were more expensive than regular products. The mean (+/- standard deviation) unit price for gluten-free products was $1.71 (+/- 0.93) compared with $0.61 (+/- 0.38) for regular products (p<0.0001). On average, gluten-free products were 242% more expensive than regular products (+/- 212; range, 5% to 1,000%). CONCLUSIONS: All the commercially available products labelled gluten-free were significantly more expensive than comparable products. This information will be useful to dietitians who counsel individuals and families with celiac disease, and to celiac advocacy groups for lobbying the government about financial compensation.},

Two types of allergy are particularly well characterized. The first is bakers' asthma, which results from the inhalation of flour and dust during grain processing. Although a number of wheat proteins have been shown to bind IgE from patients with bakers' asthma, there is no doubt a well-characterized group of inhibitors of alpha-amylase (also called chloroform methanol soluble, or CM, proteins) are the major components responsible for this syndrome. The second well-characterized form of allergy to wheat proteins is wheat-dependent exercise-induced anaphylaxis (WDEIA), with the omega(5)-gliadins (part of the gluten protein fraction) being the major group of proteins which are responsible. Other forms of food allergy have also been reported, with the proteins responsible including gluten proteins, CM proteins and non-specific lipid transfer proteins. Processing of wheat and of related cereals (barley and rye, which may contain related allergens) may lead to decreased allergenicity while genetic engineering technology offers opportunities to eliminate allergens by suppressing gene expression.},

People with celiac disease should feel confident that foods labeled "gluten-free" have been assessed for gluten using the same "best available" methodology. The Association of Analytical Communities and the Codex Alimentarius Commission endorse different methods. Both are used by manufacturers in the United States to determine the gluten-free status of food. The sandwich omega-gliadin enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay (ELISA) is the official method of the Association of Analytical Communities. It is able to quantify native and heated gluten. It is unable to accurately detect and quantify barley prolamins, can over- or underestimate gluten content, and cannot accurately quantify hydrolyzed gluten. The sandwich R5 ELISA was endorsed by Codex for gluten determination. It is able to quantify native and heated gluten. One criticism is that it overestimates barley hordein. It also is unable to accurately quantify hydrolyzed gluten. Foods that can be reliably assessed for gluten using a validated commercially available ELISA are those contaminated with native and heated proteins from wheat, barley, and rye. The degree of confidence that can be placed in a manufacturer's assertion that a product is gluten-free is based on the assay used to determine the gluten content and the specific food analyzed.},

   abstract = {OBJECTIVES: Anti-tissue transglutaminase (anti-TG2) immunoglobulin A (IgA) autoantibodies are detectable in the serum of most patients with untreated celiac disease (CD). Their deposits in the intestine of patients with CD with severe enteropathy are considered specific for this condition. The histological spectrum of CD includes cases with normal villous architecture. The aim of this study was to look for anti-TG2 IgA deposits in the intestine of children with normal villous architecture and to relate them with other markers of gluten sensitivity. PATIENTS AND METHODS: A total of 57 children with normal duodenal villous architecture and markers of gluten sensitivity were considered. Of those, 39 showed positive serum anti-endomysium antibodies and/or high levels of anti-TG2 antibodies (group 1), and 18 were seronegative with only a greater density of gammadelta intraepithelial lymphocytes (group 2). Thirty-four children with no markers of gluten sensitivity and a normal mucosa represented the control group (group 3). The duodenal sections of all patients were investigated for deposited anti-TG2 IgA by double immunofluorescence. Human lymphocyte antigen molecular typing was performed. RESULTS: In group 1 and in group 2, 33 of 39 children (85%) and 12 of 18 children (66%) showed subepithelial anti-TG2 IgA intestinal deposits, respectively. Only in 3 of 34 (8.8%) children with no markers of gluten sensitivity were anti-TG2 IgA deposits noted. CONCLUSIONS: A subgroup of children with no serum CD-associated autoantibodies, but greater density of gammadelta intraepithelial lymphocytes, shows a clear anti-TG2 IgA deposition in the duodenal mucosa. These children must be investigated further for possible gluten sensitivity.},

   abstract = {PURPOSE OF REVIEW: In the last few years, knowledge about coeliac disease has significantly improved, resulting in a better understanding of disease pathogenesis, diagnosis and therapy. This review describes the latest progress in research concerning treatment with gluten-free diet in patients with coeliac disease. RECENT FINDINGS: Gluten-free diet is generally admitted as effective therapy in symptomatic patients, but a life-long dietary treatment in some challenging cases such as 'silent' and 'latent' patients is under discussion. Tolerance to gluten may be acquired later in life, but, as latency may be transient, a strict follow-up is necessary in these patients. The composition of gluten-free diet needs a better definition; latest evidence demonstrates that oats are tolerated by most patients with coeliac disease. Finally, the amount of gluten permitted in gluten-free products is still a matter of debate; significant progress has been made in the sensitivity of techniques for gluten detection, but the daily amount of gluten that can be safely consumed is not yet defined. SUMMARY: Gluten-free diet remains the cornerstone of therapy of coeliac disease. More studies addressing the need of gluten-free diet for cases of 'potential' coeliac disease are necessary, as well as studies linking the best available analytical detection of gluten to the clinical threshold of tolerance.},

   abstract = {BACKGROUND: CDEUSSA is a Specific Support Action project from the Sixth Framework Programme Priority of the European Union (EU). Its aim is to bring together basic and applied research in the area of coeliac disease (CD). This paper reviews the main issues that are a result of the CDEUSSA initiative. AIM: To identify the major issues in need of investigation in the areas of clinical aspects, treatment, prevention and public health. METHODS: Key stakeholders, representing a wide range of knowledge with crucial importance for CD research and practice, have participated in two workshops aimed at identifying and proposing to the EU, as high priority research, topics in the areas of clinical aspects, treatment, prevention and public health. RESULTS: In public health, the overall goal should be to improve quality of life of the European population by implementing primary prevention strategies, early diagnosis and improved treatments for CD. New treatment strategies need to be developed. The option of primary prevention should be fully explored, which requires combined epidemiological, clinical and basic scientific research efforts. Such studies should also consider the importance of gene-environment interactions in the development of CD. Increased knowledge is needed on the natural history of CD. Diagnostic criteria need to be revised. CONCLUSIONS: To achieve these goals, a collaboration of the stakeholders is fundamental, including research and patient organizations, as well as industries within both diagnostics and food production.},

The magnitude of the beneficial effect of breastfeeding on blood pressure (-2 mmHg) and total cholesterol (-0.2 mmol/l) is likely to have public health implications. However, it is unknot known whether breastfeeding reduces the risk of cardiovascular mortality. Breastfeeding may protect against the development of celiac disease. The protective role of breastfeeding against type 1 diabetes seems likely, but the mechanisms involved are still under discussion. There is no convincing evidence that breastfeeding reduces the risk of leukemia and cancer. Breastfeeding is associated with a better cognitive development (-3 points) that is present as early as at 6 months of age and sustained throughout childhood and adolescence. The benefits of breast milk may be related to its high content in docosahexaenoic acid which plays an important role in brain development. Increasing the duration of breastfeeding is correlated with an increase in cognitive development.},

   abstract = {CONTEXT: Celiac sprue affects genetically susceptible individuals, who develop small intestinal injury and malabsorption following dietary exposure to gluten. The histologic features are nonspecific but characteristic. OBJECTIVES: To outline the histologic features of celiac sprue and the necessary clinical context to permit a diagnosis of celiac sprue, to assist the pathologist to identify artifactual biopsy changes that may mimic sprue, to define the differential diagnosis for conditions with a similar histology, and to review historic investigations of this disease. DATA SOURCES: Sources include the historic experiments and clinical work of members of the Gastroenterology Division of the Department of Medicine and experiences with gastrointestinal pathology consultation material at the University of Washington, Seattle, with reference to selected peer-reviewed articles. CONCLUSIONS: Confirmation of a diagnosis of celiac sprue is 2-fold: first, biopsy evidence of a characteristic, but nonspecific, pattern of injury including villous blunting or flattening, surface enterocyte damage, and increased intraepithelial lymphocytes; and second, dramatic clinical response to a gluten-free diet. Complete gluten removal from the diet is effective treatment for patients with symptoms of malabsorption; however, lifelong adherence to the diet is expensive, socially limiting, and nearly impossible on a contemporary diet with manufactured foodstuffs. Therefore, pathologists should avoid overdiagnosis of celiac disease based on minimal, nonspecific histologic changes.},

As gliadin is a complex mixture of proteins difficult to solubilize and to extract from food, it is difficult to develop an assay capable of accurate quantization of gliadin in food for celiac patients. In this work, we present an advanced fluorescence assay for the detection of traces of gliadin in food. The described assay is based on measurement of the fluctuations of fluorescein-labeled gliadin peptides (GP) in a focused laser beam in the absence and in the presence of anti-GP antibodies. A competitive assay based on the utilization of unlabeled GP was developed. The obtained results indicate that the combination of high-avidity IgG antibodies together with the innovative fluorescence immunoassay strategy resulted in a gluten detection limit of 0.006 ppm, which it is much lower than the values reported in the literature.},

   abstract = {The gastrointestinal system plays a central role in immune system homeostasis. It is the main route of contact with the external environment and is overloaded every day with external stimuli, sometimes dangerous as pathogens (bacteria, protozoa, fungi, viruses) or toxic substances, in other cases very useful as food or commensal flora. The crucial position of the gastrointestinal system is testified by the huge amount of immune cells that reside within it. Indeed, gut-associated lymphoid tissue (GALT) is the prominent part of mucosal-associated lymphoid tissue (MALT) and represents almost 70% of the entire immune system; moreover, about 80% of plasma cells [mainly immunoglobulin A (IgA)-bearing cells] reside in GALT. GALT interacts strictly with gastrointestinal functions in a dynamic manner; for instance, by increasing intestinal permeability in replay to particular stimulations, or orientating the immune response towards luminal content, allowing either tolerance or elimination/degradation of luminal antigens, or sometimes provoking damage to the intestinal mucosa, such as in coeliac disease or food allergy. The immune mechanisms implicated in these actions are very complex and belong to both innate and adaptive immunity; innate immunity supplies an immediate non-specific response that is indispensable before specific adaptive immunity, which needs 7-10 days to be efficacious, takes place. The results of their interactions depend upon different contexts in which contact with external agents occurs and may change according to different genetic settings of the hosts.},

   abstract = {BACKGROUND AND AIM: In the present paper, the toxicity of prolamines derived from three cereals with a different genome was investigated in human colon cancer Caco-2/TC7 and human myelogenous leukemia K562(S) cells. The purpose of this study was to investigate if species from ancient wheat could be considered as healthy food crops devoid or poor in cytotoxic prolamines for celiac disease. METHODS: Cytotoxicity was measured in terms of inhibition of cell growth, activation of apoptosis, release of nitric oxide (NO), detection of tissue transglutaminase (TG II) and alteration of transepithelial electrical resistance (TEER) on Caco-2/Tc7 and K562 (S) cell agglutination. Peptic-tryptic (PT) digest from bread wheat (T. aestivum S. Pastore) was used as a positive control. RESULTS: PT digests of prolamins from spelt wheat (T. aestivum ssp. spelta) were found to exert toxic effects on Caco-2/TC7 cells and to agglutinate K562(S) cells. Increased amounts of NO and TG II expression were observed in Caco-2/TC7 cells exposed to 1 mg/mL of spelt prolamins, suggesting that spelt wheat can induce cellular mechanisms implicated in the pathogenesis of celiac disease. By contrast, the PT digests from monoccum wheat (Triticum monococcum) and farro wheat (T. turgidum ssp. dicoccum) did not exhibit any negative effects on Caco-2/TC7 and K562(S) cells. CONCLUSIONS: The results have shown a constant and significant toxic effect of spelt wheat which is not shared by the two other ancient cereals. Future studies on celiac intestinal organ cultures are needed to increase the prospects of breeding programs aimed at developing wheat cultivars potentially tolerated by most celiac patients.},

   abstract = {Celiac Sprue is an inflammatory disease of the small intestine triggered by ingestion of dietary gluten, a family of glutamine and proline rich proteins found in common foodgrains such as wheat, rye, and barley. One potential therapy for this lifelong disease anticipates using an oral protease to detoxify gluten in vivo. Recent studies have shown that EP-B2 (endoprotease B, isoform 2) from barley is a promising example of such a glutenase, thus warranting its large-scale production for animal safety and human clinical studies. Here we describe a scaleable fermentation, refolding and purification process for the production of gram to kilogram quantities of pro-EP-B2 (zymogen form of EP-B2) in a lyophilized form. A fed-batch E. coli fermentation system was developed that yields 0.3-0.5 g purified recombinant protein per liter culture volume. Intracellular degradation of pro-EP-B2 during the fermentation was overcome by manipulating the fermentation temperature and duration of protein expression. A simple refolding protocol was developed using a fast dilution method to refold the enzyme at concentrations greater than 0.5 mg/mL. Kinetic analysis showed that pro-EP-B2 refolding is a first-order reaction with an estimated rate constant of 0.15 h(-1). A lyophilization procedure was developed that yielded protein with 85% recoverable activity after 7 weeks of storage at room temperature. The process was successfully scaled up to 100 L with comparable purity and recovery.},

   abstract = {We report the largest market basket survey of arsenic (As) in U.S. rice to date. Our findings show differences in transitional-metal levels between polished and unpolished rice and geographical variation in As and selenium (Se) between rice processed in California and the South Central U.S. The mean and median As grain levels for the South Central U.S. were 0.30 and 0.27 mimcrog As g(-1), respectively, for 107 samples. Levels for California were 41% lower than the South Central U.S., with a mean of 0.17 microg As g(-1) and a median of 0.16 microg As g(-1) for 27 samples. The mean and median Se grain levels for the South Central U.S. were 0.19 microg Se g(-1). Californian rice levels were lower, averaging only 0.08 and 0.06 microg Se g(-1) for mean and median values, respectively. The difference between the two regions was found to be significant for As and Se (General Linear Model (GLM): As p < 0.001; Se p < 0.001). No statistically significant differences were observed in As or Se levels between polished and unpolished rice (GLM: As p= 0.213; Se p= 0.113). No significant differences in grain levels of manganese (Mn), cobalt (Co), copper (Cu), or zinc (Zn) were observed between California and the South Central U.S. Modeling arsenic intake for the U.S. population based on this survey shows that for certain groups (namely Hispanics, Asians, sufferers of Celiac disease, and infants) dietary exposure to inorganic As from elevated levels in rice potentially exceeds the maximum intake of As from drinking water (based on consumption of 1 L of 0.01 mg L(-1) In. As) and Californian state exposure limits. Further studies on the transformation of As in soil, grain As bioavailability in the human gastrointestinal tract, and grain elemental speciation trends are critical.},

   abstract = {This review of the current scenario of celiac disease (CD) in India covers both pediatric and adult CD. CD is primarily reported from northern India with isolated case reports from the rest of the country. CD cases among Indian children are associated with multiple DR3-DQ2 haplotypes. Delay in diagnosis is contributed by multiple factors including atypical presentations. Use of serological tests, IgA EMA and anti-tTG antibodies, along with modified ESPGHAN criteria provides a definitive diagnosis of CD. Dietary management is often difficult due to non-availability of labeled and marketed gluten-free foods. A majority of children with CD show normalization of nutrition, substantial improvement in growth parameters and attainment of healthy percentile curves on gluten-free diet. Small bowel histology remarkably improves but does not normalize even after 2-3 years on gluten-free diet. The true burden of the disease should be addressed by large epidemiological studies.},

   abstract = {BACKGROUND AND AIMS: Intact protein absorption is thought to be a causative factor in several intestinal diseases, such as food allergy, celiac disease and inflammatory bowel disease. However, the mechanism remains unclear. The aim of this study was to characterize a novel signal transduction pathway via which heat stress compromises intestinal epithelial barrier function. METHODS: Heat stress was carried out by exposing confluent human intestinal epithelial cell line T84 cell monolayers to designated temperatures (37-43 degrees C) for 1 h. Transepithelial electric resistance (TER) and permeability to horseradish peroxidase (HRP, molecular weight = 44 000) were used as indicators to assess the intestinal epithelial barrier function. Phosphorylated myosin light chain (MLC), MLC kinase (MLCK) and protein kinase C (PKC) protein of the T84 cells were evaluated in order to identify the signal transduction pathway in the course of heat stress-induced intestinal epithelial barrier dysfunctions. RESULTS: The results showed that exposure to heat stress significantly increased intact protein transport across the intestinal epithelial monolayer; the amount of phospho-PKC, phospho-MLCK and phospho-MLC proteins in T84 cells decreased significantly at 41 degrees C and 43 degrees C although they increased at 39 degrees C. The heat stress-induced T84 monolayer barrier dysfunction was inhibited by pretreatment with PKC inhibitor, MLCK inhibitor, or HSP70. CONCLUSION: Heat stress can induce intestinal epithelial barrier dysfunction via the PKC and MLC signal transduction pathway.},

   abstract = {OBJECTIVE: To study the anti-inflammatory effects of Fu' an oral liquid ( FAOL). METHODS: The three experimental groups were administrated with FAOL of low, medium and high dosages, while the positive groups were given with aspirin and dexamethasone, and the control group was fed with distilled water. The effects of FAOL on the mice and rats were observed. RESULTS: FAOL could evidently inhibit the increase of celiac capillary permeability caused by acetic acid in mice and reduce the swelling of adjuvant arthritis in rats induced by injecting methanal and egg serum. It could also inhibit the proliferation of granulation tissue induced by cotton-pellet in rats. CONCLUSION: FAOL has certain anti-inflammatory effects on acute and chronic inflammation.},

METHOD: Immunodeficiency mice were fed IRRE with doses of 5, 2.5, 0.85 g x kg(-1) for 15 days before their immune function were observed. RESULT: IRRE could relieve retarded growth and viscera index drop of mice induced by CP, could heighten the response of delayed hypersensitivity and the amount of antibody in serum. The proliferation of ConA-induced mitogenic response for spleen lymphocyte were also increased, compared with the CP group (P < 0.05). IRRE could enhance the content of marrow DNA and NO of serum with no change of acid phosphatase and alkalinity phosphatase. CONCLUSION: IRRE could enhance the phagocytosis of celiac macrophage, protect the spleen from damage and improve marrow inhibition in immunodeficiency mice.},
