   abstract = {Growth retardation and delay in sexual maturation are the major complications of child-onset Crohn's disease (CD). Nutritional assessment and monitoring should comprise: weight and height measurement with calculation of respective velocities (growth velocity should be > or = 4-5 cm/year during the prepubertal period); pubertal staging; dietetic evaluation; laboratory analysis for mineral, vitamin and trace element deficiencies; bone age. At diagnosis, weight loss and growth delay are present in 80-90% and 1/3 of cases, respectively. In case of an acute flare-up in a CD child with normal nutritional status, nutritional therapy is limited to oral feeding, with a caloric intake at least equal to recommended dietary allowances for age and sex. A low-fiber diet is advised in case of small bowel stenosis. No diet has been shown as efficient in the long-term maintenance of remission. Exclusive enteral nutrition (EN) is an alternative to corticosteroids for the treatment of an acute flare-up of CD, especially in case of malnutrition. Prolonged nocturnal EN is of great interest for the treatment of growth retardation and delay of sexual maturation and in case of steroid-dependent or steroid-refractory CD. In case of steroid-dependent CD with no delay of growth and/or sexual maturation, immunomodulating agents are nowadays an alternative to long-term EN. Efficacy of polymeric solutions is identical to that of semi-elemental or elemental solutions. Parenteral nutrition is limited to an acute flare-up with resistance to medical treatment and/or EN, and contraindications to surgery; occlusion or fistula; short bowel syndrome.},

The aim of this study was to determine the effect of exclusive enteral nutrition, which is increasingly being used as primary therapy for CD, on plasma antioxidant concentrations in children with active CD. METHODS: In a double-blind randomised controlled trial, 15 children with active CD (mean age, 11.3 years, range 6.8-15.7) attending a paediatric gastroenterology referral centre, were assigned to receive either a standard polymeric diet (Group S, n=8) or a glutamine-enriched polymeric diet (Group G, n=7) as primary therapy for active CD. Plasma concentrations of selenium, urates, vitamin A, vitamin E, vitamin C, glutathione, and also malondialdehyde (MDA) were measured at baseline and after 4 weeks of exclusive enteral nutritional treatment. RESULTS: Mean (95% CI) selenium concentration of the cohort increased significantly from 0.82 micromol/l (0.72, 0.91) to 1.14 micromol/l (0.98, 1.3), P<0.001. There were, however, significant reductions in mean concentrations of vitamin C {11.8 mg/l (7.7, 15.8) to 6.5 mg/l (4.5, 8.7), P=0.01} and vitamin E {11.3 mg/l (10.3, 12.4) to 9.4 mg/l (8.7, 10.1), P=0.03}. The concentrations of vitamin A, urates, glutathione and MDA did not change significantly over the study period. Glutamine supplementation did not have any significant effect on plasma antioxidant concentrations. CONCLUSIONS: Significant changes in circulating antioxidant concentrations occurred in children with active CD receiving exclusive enteral nutritional treatment. Glutamine supplementation was not beneficial in improving plasma antioxidant status.},

   abstract = {OBJECTIVE: Selenoprotein-P is a selenium-rich serum protein that carries more than 50% of serum selenium. We evaluated changes in serum selenoprotein-P levels in patients with inflammatory bowel disease. METHODS: Serum selenoprotein-P levels were measured by enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay. Twenty healthy individuals (controls), 34 patients with ulcerative colitis, and 37 patients with Crohn's disease (CD) were studied. RESULTS: A highly significant correlation was found between the serum selenium and selenoprotein-P levels. There was no significant difference in serum selenoprotein-P levels between healthy controls (average 3.4+/-0.8 microg/mL, n=20) and patients with ulcerative colitis (3.0+/-1.0 microg/mL, n=34). Serum selenoprotein-P levels were significantly lower in patients with CD (average 1.8+/-0.5 microg/mL, n=37). Serum selenoprotein-P levels were significantly lower in the elemental diet group of patients who had CD (average 1.4+/-0.4 microg/mL, n=17) than in the non-elemental diet group of patients who had CD (average 2.1+/-0.3 microg/mL, n=20). CONCLUSION: We found that the serum selenoprotein-P level is decreased in patients with CD. It may be a useful marker to monitor the systemic selenium status in various disorders.},

In the present study, we investigated the effects of the free radical scavengers edaravone and tempol in the development of experimental dextran sulfate sodium (DSS)-induced colitis in mice. Male BALB/cA mice were fed 4% (w/w of diet) DSS in standard powder chow for 8 days. Edaravone, tempol, or vehicle saline were then injected subcutaneously twice per day. After the experimental period, the colonic length, histological damage score, and mucosal myeloperoxidase (MPO) and serum interleukin-6 (IL-6) levels were measured. Edaravone (15 mg/kg/day) and tempol (5-15 mg/kg/day) suppressed the colonic shortening and the damage score. In particular, tempol at 15 mg/kg/day significantly attenuated the colonic shortening and damage score. Edaravone and tempol suppressed the serum IL-6 levels, and significantly suppressed the increased colonic MPO levels. These results strongly support the involvement of ROS in the pathogenesis of DSS-induced colitis. A clinical effect for edaravone and tempol in IBD patients is strongly expected.},

Reports in Western literature have outlined the use of LACR for diverticulosis, ulcerative colitis, and Crohn's disease. We evaluated the use of LACR in patients with ileo-cecal tuberculosis (IC-TB) and describe our technique and results. METHODS: Twenty-six patients (20 F) between 16 and 45 years of age underwent a LACR for IC-TB over a 4-year period. Three access ports were used in 22 patients, four patients needed four ports. The cecum, ascending colon, proximal transverse colon, and terminal ileum were mobilized completely. The right colic vessels were divided intracorporeally. The specimen was delivered using a 5- to 6-cm incision. The ileo-colic pedicle and bowel were divided outside and an ileocolic anastomosis performed. After placing the bowel within the abdomen the pneumoperitoneum was recreated, saline irrigation done, and hemostasis achieved. RESULTS: No patient needed a formal laparotomy. Peristalsis returned within 48 h in 19 patients and after 72 h in the remaining seven. Oral liquids were started on all patients by the 3rd postoperative day (POD) and a soft diet by the 5th POD. Twenty patients had a bowel movement by the 4th POD and the rest by the 5th POD. Eighteen patients were discharged by the 5th day and the remaining by the 7th day. Three patients developed wound sepsis. Twenty-one patients could resume normal activity within 2 weeks, the rest within a month. CONCLUSION: Laparoscopic-assisted colon resection seems to be an ideal operation for patients with ileo-cecal tuberculosis. It has minimal morbidity and allows a quick return to normal activity.},

   abstract = {BACKGROUND: Environmental exposures in early life have been implicated in the aetiology of inflammatory bowel disease. OBJECTIVE: To examine environmental risk factors prior to the development of inflammatory bowel disease in a paediatric population based case control study. METHODS: A total of 222 incident cases of Crohn's disease and 60 incident cases of ulcerative colitis occurring before 17 years of age between January 1988 and December 1997 were matched with one control subject by sex, age, and geographical location. We recorded 140 study variables in a questionnaire that covered familial history of inflammatory bowel disease, events during the perinatal period, infant and child diet, vaccinations and childhood diseases, household amenities, and the family's socioeconomic status. RESULTS: In a multivariate model, familial history of inflammatory bowel disease (odds ratio (OR) 4.3 (95% confidence interval 2.3-8)), breast feeding (OR 2.1 (1.3-3.4)), bacille Calmette-Guerin vaccination (OR 3.6 (1.1-11.9)), and history of eczema (OR 2.1 (1-4.5)) were significant risk factors for Crohn's disease whereas regular drinking of tap water was a protective factor (OR 0.56 (0.3-1)). Familial history of inflammatory bowel disease (OR 12.5 (2.2-71.4)), disease during pregnancy (OR 8.9 (1.5-52)), and bedroom sharing (OR 7.1 (1.9-27.4)) were risk factors for ulcerative colitis whereas appendicectomy was a protective factor (OR 0.06 (0.01-0.36)). CONCLUSIONS: While family history and appendicectomy are known risk factors, changes in risk based on domestic promiscuity, certain vaccinations, and dietary factors may provide new aetiological clues.},

   abstract = {INTRODUCTION: In small bowel disease such as M. Crohn, the intestinal absorption of oxalate is increased. Severe calcium oxalate deposition in multiple organs as consequence of enteric hyperoxaluria may lead to severe organ dysfunction and chronic renal failure. The management of hemodialyzed patients with short bowel syndrome may be associated with vascular access problems and oxalate infiltration of the bone marrow leading to pancytopenia. Although the risk of recurrence of the disease is very high after renal transplantation, it may be the ultimate therapeutic alternative in secondary hyperoxaluria. CASE: Here, we report a patient with enteric oxalosis due to Crohn's disease. He developed end-stage renal disease, erythropoietin-resistant anemia, oxalate infiltration of the bone marrow and severe vascular access problems. Following high-urgency kidney transplantation, daily hemodiafiltration of 3 hours was performed for 2 weeks to increase oxalate clearance. Despite tubular and interstitial deposition of oxalate in the renal transplant, the patient did not require further hemodialysis and the hematocrit levels normalized. DISCUSSION: Early treatment of hyperoxaluria due to short bowel syndrome is essential to prevent renal impairment. Declining renal function leads to a further increase in oxalate accumulation and consecutive oxalate deposition in the bone marrow or in the vascular wall. If alternative treatments such as special diet or daily hemodialysis are insufficient, kidney transplantation may be a therapeutic alternative in severe cases of enteric oxalosis despite a possible recurrence of the disease.},

AIMS: To investigate the efficacy of nutritional therapy using three different formulas versus corticosteroids to achieve clinical remission as well as to induce intestinal mucosal healing in active Crohn's disease children. Duration of remission and effect on growth recovery were also assessed. PATIENTS AND METHODS: Clinical, laboratory, endoscopic and histological data of all new diagnosed active Crohn's disease paediatric cases were retrospectively recorded and reviewed. Thirty-seven children (median age 12.1 years) received nutritional therapy (12 polymeric; 13 semi-elemental; 12 elemental diet) and 10 subjects (median age 12.4 years) received corticosteroids. RESULTS: Similar clinical remission rate were observed after 8 weeks of treatment: 86.5% children receiving nutritional therapy versus 90% treated with corticosteroids. Improvement in mucosal inflammation occurred in 26 out of 37 (64.8%) patients on nutritional therapy and in 4 out of 10 (40%) children on steroids (p < 0.05). Finally, seven subjects on nutritional therapy and none on corticosteroids achieved complete mucosal healing (p < 0.005) at the end of the treatment. Nutritional therapy was more effective than corticosteroids in improving nutritional status and linear growth recovery. Compared to corticosteroids, the duration of clinical remission was longer in the nutritional therapy groups without differences among the three different formulas. CONCLUSIONS: In children with active Crohn's disease, nutritional therapy is more effective than corticosteroids to improve intestinal inflammation and to maintain a more sustained clinical remission.},

   abstract = {BACKGROUND: We aimed to pursue potential etiological clues to Crohn's disease (CD) and ulcerative colitis (UC) through a population-based case control survey study. METHODS: Cases with CD (n = 364) and UC (n = 217), ages 18-50 yr were drawn from the population-based University of Manitoba IBD Research Registry. Potential control subjects were drawn from the population-based Manitoba Health Registry by age, gender, and geographic residence matching to the cases (n = 433). Subjects were administered a multiitem questionnaire. RESULTS: By univariate analysis, some of the variables predictive of CD included lower likelihood of living on a farm, of having drunk unpasteurized milk or having eaten pork, and UC patients were less likely to have drunk unpasteurized milk and to have eaten pork. On multivariate analysis, variables significantly associated with CD were being Jewish (OR = 4.32, 95% CI 1.10-16.9), having a first degree relative with IBD (OR = 3.07, 95% CI 1.73-5.46), ever having smoked (OR = 1.54, 95% CI, 1.06-2.25), living longer with a smoker (OR = 1.03, 95% CI, 1.01-1.04). Being a first generation Canadian (OR = 0.33, 95% CI, 0.17-0.62), having pet cats before age 5 (OR = 0.66, 95% CI, 0.46-0.96) and having larger families (OR = 0.87, 95% CI, 0.79-0.96) were protective against CD. For UC being Jewish (OR = 7.46, 95% CI, 2.33-23.89), having a relative with IBD (OR = 2.23, 95% CI, 1.27-3.9), and ever smoking (OR = 1.62, 95% CI, 1.14-2.32) were predictive. CONCLUSION: This study reinforced the increased risk associated with family history, being Jewish, and smoking history, however, a number of significant associations with CD and UC on univariate and multivariate analysis may support the "hygiene hypothesis" and warrant further exploration in prospective studies.},

Postoperative complications are increased in patients with poor preoperative nutritional status, which is common in this patient population. We present a 49-year-old female with longstanding Crohn's disease admitted to our Digestive Health Center with four weeks of increasing abdominal symptoms and radiographic evidence of small-bowel obstruction caused by ileal stricture. Given her poor nutritional status, our team elected to pursue metallic enteral stenting as a bridge to surgical resection. Two Wallstents were placed; luminal patency was subsequently confirmed by a fluoroscopic study. The patient tolerated regular diet and was discharged. When seen in follow-up, she remained asymptomatic and wished to defer surgical intervention indefinitely.},

   abstract = {BACKGROUND & AIMS: Nutritional therapy has been reported to have an almost equivalent efficacy of corticosteroids in achieving clinical remission in active Crohn's disease (CD). However, the effects of both treatments on intestinal mucosal inflammation rarely are reported. In a randomized controlled trial in children with active CD we compared the efficacy of nutritional therapy alone or corticosteroids on clinical variables and intestinal mucosal healing. METHODS: In a prospective, 10-week open-label trial, children with active, naive CD were randomized to orally polymeric formula alone or oral corticosteroids. The clinical activity index and nutritional and activity serum variables were evaluated at week 0 and then every 2 weeks; intestinal mucosal inflammation was assessed through endoscopy and histology at weeks 0 and 10. Primary efficacy outcomes were clinical remission and mucosal healing. RESULTS: Of the 37 children randomized, 19 received polymeric formula and 18 received corticosteroids. At week 10, on an intention-to-treat basis, the proportion of patients achieving clinical remission was comparable between the 2 groups (polymeric formula: 15/19 [79%; 95% confidence interval (CI), 56%-92%]; corticosteroid group: 12/18 [67%; 95% CI, 44%-84%]; P = .4; not significant). On the contrary, the proportion of children showing mucosa healing was significantly higher in the polymeric (14/19; 74%; 95% CI, 51%-89%) than the corticosteroid group (6/18 [33%; 95% CI, 16%-57%]; P < .05). At week 10 both endoscopic and histologic scores significantly decreased only in the polymeric group (P < .001). CONCLUSIONS: In children with active and recently diagnosed CD, a short course of polymeric diet is more effective than corticosteroids in inducing healing of gut inflammatory lesions.},

   abstract = {Carrageenan is a high molecular weight sulfated polygalactan used to improve the texture of commercial food products. Its use increased markedly during the last half century, although carrageenan is known to induce inflammation in rheumatological models and in intestinal models of colitis. We performed studies to determine its direct effects on human intestinal cells, including normal human intestinal epithelial cells from colonic surgeries, the normal intestinal epithelial cell line NCM460, and normal rat ileal epithelial cells. Cells were treated with high molecular weight lambda-carrageenan at a concentration of 1 mug/ml for 1-96 h. IL-8, IL-8 promoter activity, total and nuclear NF-kappaB, IkappaBalpha, phospho-IkappaBalpha, and Bcl10 were assessed by immunohistochemistry, Western blot, ELISA, and cDNA microarray. Increased Bcl10, nuclear and cytoplasmic NF-kappaB, IL-8 promoter activation, and IL-8 secretion were detected following carrageenan exposure. Knockdown of Bcl10 by siRNA markedly reduced the increase in IL-8 that followed carrageenan exposure in the NCM460 cells. These results show, for the first time, that exposure of human intestinal epithelial cells to carrageenan triggers a distinct inflammatory pathway via activation of Bcl10 with NF-kappaB activation and upregulation of IL-8 secretion. Since Bcl10 contains a caspase-recruitment domain, similar to that found in NOD2/CARD15 and associated with genetic predisposition to Crohn's disease, the study findings may represent a link between genetic and environmental etiologies of inflammatory bowel disease. Because of the high use of carrageenan as a food additive in the diet, the findings may have clinical significance.},

Energy requirements of parenterally fed hospitalized pediatric patients with active CD were measured using indirect calorimetry, to assess whether Food Agriculture Organization (FAO)/World Health Organization (WHO)/United Nations University (UNU) equations provide appropriate estimations of energy requirements in this patient population. METHODS: Twenty hospitalized patients with active CD fed exclusively via parenteral nutrition (PN) were investigated. A chart review and patient interviews were conducted to assess disease duration, location, laboratory parameters, and symptomology associated with CD. Disease severity was quantified using the Pediatric Crohn's Disease Activity Index. Each subject underwent indirect calorimetry, bioelectrical impedance analysis, and anthropometric assessment once the ordered PN met estimated macronutrient requirements of each patient (predicted resting energy expenditure x1.3). Predicted resting energy expenditure (REE) was determined using the FAO/WHO/UNU equations. RESULTS: REE showed a strong correlation with predicted REE (r(2) = .73, p < .01). CONCLUSIONS: Measured REE did not significantly differ from predicted resting energy requirements. This indicates that REE for the parenterally fed pediatric patients with CD can be accurately predicted using the FAO/WHO/UNU equations.},

The question arises whether the absorption of alendronate, and thus its bioavailability, is further altered by the local inflammatory process in patients with Crohn's disease, thereby potentially affecting clinical outcome when used in the treatment of osteoporosis. To address this question, urinary excretion of alendronate was evaluated 3 months and 6 months after start of treatment with oral alendronate at a dose of 10 mg/day in 19 osteoporotic patients with stable Crohn's disease, 12 of whom had an intestinal resection. Biochemical parameters of bone turnover and BMD were also measured at start and at 6 months. Thirteen patients had been previously treated with glucocorticoids and five were currently using them. The average 24-h urinary excretion of alendronate was 0.5-0.6% of the dose administered, a figure comparable to that reported for osteoporotic patients without gut pathology. There was a significant decrease from baseline in urine N-telopeptides of collagen cross-links (NTx)/creatinine (60%) associated with an increase in lumbar spine BMD of already 2% after 6 months of treatment. Our data suggest that in patients with Crohn's disease, alendronate is adequately absorbed from the intestine and retained in the skeleton. This adequacy is confirmed by appropriate suppression of bone resorption and increase in lumbar spine BMD. These data hold significant implications for the clinical management of patients with Crohn's disease and osteoporosis.},

This proposition is based on the results of various studies where significantly elevated levels of antibodies against the whole bacteria or preparations from Klebsiella microbes and antibodies to collagen types I, III, IV, and V were detected in patients with CD and patients with ankylosing spondylitis (AS). Molecular similarities were found between Klebsiella nitrogenase and HLA-B27 genetic markers and between Klebsiella pullulanase and collagen fibers types I, III, and IV. Furthermore, significantly positive correlations and cross-reactivity binding activities were observed between anti-Klebsiella and anticollagen antibodies among patients with CD and AS. Early treatment of CD patients with anti-Klebsiella measures is proposed, which may involve the use of antibiotics and low starch diet together with other traditionally used immunomodulatory, immunosuppressive, or biologic agents.},

   abstract = {PURPOSE: This retrospective study was designed to determine risk factors for recurrence of Crohn's disease under enteral nutrition. METHODS: The clinical course of 145 patients with Crohn's disease, who were primarily induced into remission by total parenteral nutrition, was reviewed. The patients were classified into two groups: enteral nutrition group (n = 98; >/=1,200 kcal/day of enteral nutrition), or nonenteral nutrition group (n = 47;<1,200 kcal/day of enteral nutrition) according to the amount of their daily elemental or polymeric diet. Contributions of enteral nutrition and other clinical variables to the recurrence were analyzed retrospectively. A Crohn's disease activity index of >150 plus an increase in Crohn's disease activity index of >70 from the baseline value was defined as recurrence. RESULTS: Forty-two patients in the enteral nutrition group and 29 patients in the nonenteral nutrition group recurred during periods ranging from 3 to 159 months. The cumulative rate of recurrence was significantly higher in the nonenteral nutrition group than in the enteral nutrition group (P = 0.047). Among the Crohn's disease patients in the enteral nutrition group, penetrating type (relative risk, 3.89; 95 percent confidence interval, 1.58-9.62), colonic involvement (relative risk, 3.10; 95 percent confidence interval, 1.39-6.9), and previous history of surgery (relative risk, 2.48; 95 percent confidence interval, 1.16-5.33) were factors that significantly affected recurrence. In contrast, penetrating type was the only possible factor associated with recurrence in the nonenteral nutrition group (relative risk, 2.75; 95 percent confidence interval, 0.96-7.81). CONCLUSIONS: Among patients with Crohn's disease under maintenance enteral nutrition, the risk of recurrence differs according to the disease type and the site of involvement. The maintenance treatment by enteral nutrition alone seems insufficient for patients with penetrating type or with colonic involvement.},

Disturbances in this remarkable symbiosis can result in the development of inflammatory bowel diseases (IBD). Although the etiology of IBD is not entirely understood, it is known that the chronic inflammation of Crohn's disease, ulcerative colitis and chronic pouchitis are a result of an overly aggressive immune response to the commensal intestinal flora in genetically susceptible hosts. Recent studies have enhanced our ability to understand the interaction between the host and its intestinal microflora and the role the microflora plays in maintaining intestinal homeostasis. As we begin to understand the benefits conferred to the intestine by the microflora, the notion of modifying the composition of the bacterial load to improve human health has arisen. A significant body of research now exists investigating the role of probiotics and prebiotics in ameliorating chronic intestinal inflammation. This article will begin with an overview of the role of the commensal microflora in maintaining mucosal immune homeostasis, and how a dysregulated immune response to the intestinal microflora results in IBD. This will be followed by a summary of the use of probiotics and prebiotics in experimental and human IBD.},

The mechanism of action of this therapy, however, is still poorly understood. As part of our assessment of the action of 3 related polymeric enteral therapies, we have used a variety of techniques to document the histological and cytokine responses, in the mucosa and, systemically, to these treatments. The feeds studied (AL110, Modulen IBD and ACD004 [Nestle, Vevey, Switzerland]) all have casein as the protein source, are lactose free and are rich in transforming growth factor beta (TGF-beta). They have all been shown to induce clinical remission associated with mucosal healing. In the case of Modulen IBD, as well as mucosal macroscopic and histological healing there was a fall in mucosal proinflammatory cytokines: interleukin-1 mRNA in colonic and ileal, interleukin-8 mRNA in the colon and interferon gamma mRNA in the ileum, but a rise in the regulatory cytokine TGF-beta mRNA in the ileum. These results indicate that these formulas are influencing the disease process itself, and thus suggest that the clinical remission achieved is a result of a reduction in inflammation, rather than a consequence of some other nutrition effect.},

   abstract = {BACKGROUND: Patients with Crohn's disease (CD) are at risk of developing nutritional deficiencies, especially because of restrictive diets. The aim of our study was to assess food intake and the status for vitamins and trace elements in nonselected CD patients in clinical remission. METHODS: A total of 54 consecutive CD patients (28 females, 26 males, 39 +/- 2 years of age [mean +/- SD]) in clinical remission for >3 months underwent body composition, resting energy expenditure, nutrient intake, and plasma concentration assessment, and were compared with 25 healthy controls (16 females, 9 males, 38 +/- 3 years old). RESULTS: According to the nutritional risk index, 37 patients (70%) were not malnourished, 12 were at moderate risk, and 4 were at severe risk for malnutrition. Fat mass was lower in patients in remission compared with controls (P = 0.04). The mean daily energy intake was comparable between patients (2218 +/- 92 kcal/day) and controls (2066 +/- 101 kcal/day), covering their needs. No significant difference was observed for macronutrient intake in comparison with controls; compared to controls, female CD patients had lower intakes of beta-carotene (P < 0.005), vitamins B1 (P < 0.05), B6 (P < 0.01), and C (P < 0.005), and magnesium (P < 0.01). They had significantly higher intakes of zinc (P < 0.01). Male CD patients had lower intakes of beta-carotene and vitamin C (P < 0.05). More than 50% of patients had low plasma concentrations of vitamin C (84%), copper (84%), niacin (77%), and zinc (65%). CONCLUSIONS: In CD patients in remission, macronutrient needs are usually covered by food intake. However, micronutrient deficiencies are frequent and call for specific screening and treatment.},

   abstract = {The pathogenesis of inflammatory bowel disease (IBD) is complex, involving environmental, genetic, microbial, and immune factors. Therefore, treatment should target components that either predispose to or mediate the chronic inflammatory response of IBD. At the moment it is assumed that all components are necessary to have the typical manifestations of IBD but, in reality, it is unclear to what extent each factor contributes to the disease process, and whether some are more important than others. In addition, some factors are not practical targets; for example, environmental factors are poorly defined, too numerous, and require changes that cannot be implemented by the physician or the patient alone. The same is true for genetic factors that are still not amenable to therapeutic manipulations for technical and ethical reasons. This leaves microbial and immune factors as the two categories that can be selected for therapeutic intervention and where all current treatments are focused. The commensal gut flora can be qualitatively or quantitatively modified with antibiotics, probiotics, or diet, and a better characterization of enteric bacteria strains should help greatly in developing more effective therapies. Most current drugs are focused on inhibiting pro-inflammatory molecules produced by immune cells, including biological agents that block specific cytokines such as tumor necrosis factor-alpha. It is anticipated that combination therapies targeting multiple pathogenic components will prove more effective than those blocking single components of IBD pathogenesis.},

   abstract = {INTRODUCTION: Inflammatory bowel disease (Crohn's disease and ulcerative colitis) and irritable bowel syndrome are chronic, debilitating gastrointestinal (GI) disorders. There are no known causes of inflammatory bowel disease and/or irritable bowel syndrome. Both of these GI conditions significantly impair quality of life and the ability to complete activities of daily living. Unfortunately, there has been little education and research surrounding the evaluation of effective coping strategies with respect to GI disorders, particularly from the perspective of those diagnosed. As such, exploring the strategies of individuals with GI disorders would provide information concerning coping strategies from the perspective of those afflicted. PURPOSE: The overall objective of this research was to explore the lived experience of women who had been diagnosed with inflammatory bowel disease and/or irritable bowel syndrome. This article specifically explores the relationship between food and irritable bowel syndrome and/or inflammatory bowel disease. METHODS: Eight females, diagnosed with inflammatory bowel disease and/or irritable bowel syndrome, were recruited via on-campus posters from a university in southern Ontario, Canada. Qualitative information was collected in the form of background questionnaires, e-mail interviews, and face-to-face interviews, which were subsequently analyzed for trends. RESULTS: Every woman reported that one of the most significant means by which to cope with their condition centered around food consumption or controlling their food consumption. Subjects identified the importance of determining their "trigger foods," selecting healthy food choices, the impact of stress, and problems associated with food and travel. CONCLUSIONS: This research, predicated on the narratives of women diagnosed with GI disorders, substantiates the profound effect that food has on conditions of the GI tract. All of the women identified their relationship with food as a dynamic learning process, one that they thought would be a lifelong struggle. The implications for community health nurses in assisting individuals with GI disorders are discussed.},

   abstract = {The newborn infant leaves a germ-free intrauterine environment to enter a contaminated extrauterine world and must have adequate intestinal defences to prevent the expression of clinical gastrointestinal disease states. Although the intestinal mucosal immune system is fully developed after a full-term birth, the actual protective function of the gut requires the microbial stimulation of initial bacterial colonization. Breast milk contains prebiotic oligosaccharides, like inulin-type fructans, which are not digested in the small intestine but enter the colon as intact large carbohydrates that are then fermented by the resident bacteria to produce SCFA. The nature of this fermentation and the consequent pH of the intestinal contents dictate proliferation of specific resident bacteria. For example, breast milk-fed infants with prebiotics present in breast milk produce an increased proliferation of bifidobacteria and lactobacilli (probiotics), whereas formula-fed infants produce more enterococci and enterobacteria. Probiotics, stimulated by prebiotic fermentation, are important to the development and sustainment of intestinal defences. For example, probiotics can stimulate the synthesis and secretion of polymeric IgA, the antibody that coats and protects mucosal surfaces against harmful bacterial invasion. In addition, appropriate colonization with probiotics helps to produce a balanced T helper cell response (Th1=Th2=Th3/Tr1) and prevent an imbalance (Th1>Th2 or Th2>Th1) contributing in part to clinical disease (Th2 imbalance contributes to atopic disease and Th1 imbalance contributes to Crohn's disease and Helicobacter pylori-induced gastritis). Furthermore, a series of pattern recognition receptors, toll-like receptors on gut lymphoid and epithelial cells that interact with bacterial molecular patterns (e.g. endotoxin (lipopolysaccharide), flagellin, etc.), help modulate intestinal innate immunity and an appropriate adaptive immune response. Animal and clinical studies have shown that inulin-type fructans will stimulate an increase in probiotics (commensal bacteria) and these bacteria have been shown to modulate the development and persistence of appropriate mucosal immune responses. However, additional studies are needed to show that prebiotics can directly or indirectly stimulate intestinal host defences. If this can be demonstrated, then prebiotics can be used as a dietary supplement to stimulate a balanced and an appropriately effective mucosal immune system in newborns and infants.},

   abstract = {The chronic idiopathic inflammatory bowel diseases (IBDs), namely Crohn's disease and ulcerative colitis, appear to be derived from an inappropriate reaction towards a luminal agent, most probably driven by the intestinal microflora, which upregulates the synthesis and release of different pro-inflammatory mediators, thus contributing to tissue damage that characterizes these intestinal conditions. Several studies have reported that IBD is associated with impairment in short-chain fatty acid (SCFA) production, mainly acetate, propionate, and butyrate. They are produced in the large bowel by anaerobic bacterial fermentation of undigested dietary carbohydrates and fiber polysaccharides, with butyrate being considered as the major fuel source for colonocytes. These SCFAs have been proposed to play a key role in the maintenance of colonic homeostasis. Therefore, it is reasonable to consider therapeutic approaches that increase colonic SCFA production, as it can be achieved by administration of dietary fiber to IBD patients. Unfortunately, there is quite limited documentation of efficacy of dietary fiber in properly designed trials. This review discusses the rationale, available evidence for the use of dietary fiber and its mechanisms of action in the treatment and prevention of IBDs.},

   abstract = {Undigested carbohydrates reaching the colon can act as competitors for epithelial bacterial receptors, making it difficult for noncommensal bacteria to adhere to them. On the contrary, fermentation of these carbohydrates by anaerobic flora produces - among other substrates - butyrate that is involved in numerous important metabolic processes. These include the provision of energy to the colonocytes, the enhancement of sodium and water absorption and the synthesis of mucus and cell membranes. In addition, butyrate inhibits the nuclear translocation of the transcription factor NFkappaB, which exerts a potent anti-inflammatory activity. Clinical experience with probiotics in inflammatory bowel disease (IBD) is controversial. Whereas some probiotic preparations appear to be useful in ulcerative colitis (UC) and pouchitis, most attempts to use probiotics for treating or preventing recurrence in Crohn's disease have failed. It should be pointed out that - unlike in the small bowel - the colon and ileal pouches are well-established microbiological ecosystems with increasing amounts of a wide variety of bacterial strains. These bacterial strains have a high degree of metabolic interaction with luminal nutrients and a greater probability of developing dysbiosis. With this in mind, the rationale for using pre- and probiotics appears to be stronger for colonic IBD (UC or Crohn's colitis) and pouchitis than for IBD mostly involving the small bowel.},

Current dietetic practice during EN is to recommend an energy intake based on estimated average requirement (EAR) for energy for age. AIMS: To examine factors affecting energy intake and weight gain during EN in relation to disease site and nutritional status. METHODS: A retrospective cohort study examining energy intake and weight gain during the exclusive EN feeding period in 40 patients newly diagnosed with Crohn's in relation to EAR, nutritional status, disease site. RESULTS: All patients improved clinically and gained weight during EN with improvement in the CRP as a marker of the systemic inflammatory response. Energy intake was higher than EAR in 82% (33/40 patients), with the median 117.5% of EAR. Weight gain correlated with body mass index standard deviation score (P = 0.001) at start of treatment, but not energy intake or CRP. CONCLUSION: Estimated average requirement underestimates energy intakes in most children with newly diagnosed Crohn's disease. During EN, an energy intake in the range of 100-149% (median 117.5%) EAR for energy for age may be required. Energy balance studies in children with active disease are required.},

   abstract = {Susceptibility to the development of Crohn's disease involves a combination of genetic and environmental factors. The association of Crohn's disease with westernization has implicated lifestyle factors in pathogenesis. While diet is a likely candidate, evidence for specific changes in dietary habits and/or intake has been lacking. A new hypothesis is proposed, by which excessive delivery of highly fermentable but poorly absorbed short-chain carbohydrates and polyols (designated FODMAPs--Fermentable Oligo-, Di- and Mono-saccharides And Polyols) to the distal small intestinal and colonic lumen is a dietary factor underlying susceptibility to Crohn's disease. The subsequent rapid fermentation of FODMAPs in the distal small and proximal large intestine induces conditions in the bowel that lead to increased intestinal permeability, a predisposing factor to the development of Crohn's disease. Evidence supporting this hypothesis includes the increasing intake of FODMAPs in western societies, the association of increased intake of sugars in the development of Crohn's disease, and the previously documented effects of the ingestion of excessive FODMAPs on the bowel. This hypothesis provides potential for the design of preventive strategies and raises concern about current enthusiasm for putative health-promoting effects of FODMAPs. One of the greatest challenges in defining the pathogenesis of Crohn's disease is to identify predisposing environmental factors. Such an achievement might lead to the development of preventive strategies for, and the definition of, possible target for changing the natural history of this serious disease. The present paper describes a new hypothesis for one such environmental factor.},

DESIGN: A cross-sectional observational study. SETTING: Cork City, Ireland (52 degrees N). SUBJECTS: Crohn's Disease patients (n=58; mean age 38.1 years) were recruited from Cork University Hospital. RESULTS: Fifty and nineteen percent of Irish CD patients were vitamin D deficient (defined by serum 25 hydroxyvitamin (OH) D levels <50 nmol/l) during winter and summer, respectively. Multiple regression analysis showed that summer-time serum 25 (OH) D levels were positively associated with use of vitamin D supplements (P=0.033) and negatively associated with smoking (P=0.006) and being male (P=0.063). During winter-time, use of vitamin D supplements (P=0.041) and sun habits (P=0.066) were positively associated, whereas small intestinal involvement (P=0.005) and body mass index (BMI) (P=0.083) were negatively associated with serum 25 (OH) D levels. There was no significant association between other non-pathophysiologic (age, dietary calcium or vitamin D) or pathophysiologic factors (steroid use, resection), and serum 25 (OH) D levels, at either season. Approximately 41 and 60% of the total variation in summer- and winter-time serum 25 (OH) D, respectively, was explained by this model. CONCLUSION: A high proportion of Irish CD patents had some level of vitamin D deficiency (<50 nmol/l) during late-wintertime. Use of regular low-dose supplemental vitamin D, particularly by patients with small intestinal involvement, cessation of smoking and adequate, but responsible, exposure to summer sunlight as well as maintaining BMI in the normal range could help maintain adequate vitamin D levels during wintertime.},

AIM: To determine the prevalence of anti-S. cerevisiae and perinuclear anti-neutrophil cytoplasmic autoantibodies in a large series of coeliac disease patients before and after gluten free diet, and to correlate anti-S. cerevisiae-positivity with intestinal mucosal damage. METHODS: One hundred and five consecutive coeliac disease patients and 141 controls (22 ulcerative colitis, 24 Crohn's disease, 30 primary sclerosing cholangitis, 15 postenteritis syndrome, 50 blood donors) were tested for anti-S. cerevisiae by enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay and for perinuclear anti-neutrophil cytoplasmic autoantibodies by indirect immunofluorescence. RESULTS: In coeliac disease anti-S. cerevisiae (immunoglobulin G and/or immunoglobulin A) were slightly less frequent (59%) than in Crohn's disease (75%, P = 0.16) and significantly more frequent than in ulcerative colitis (27%), primary sclerosing cholangitis (30%), postenteritis syndrome (26%) and blood donors (4%) (P = 0.009, P = 0.0002, P = 0.025, P < 0.0001). No correlation was found between anti-S. cerevisiae and degree of mucosal damage. Perinuclear anti-neutrophil cytoplasmic autoantibodies were detected only in one coeliac. After gluten free diet the disappearance of anti-S. cerevisiae-immunoglobulin A (93%) was more frequent than that of immunoglobulin G (17%, P = 0.0001); perinuclear anti-neutrophil cytoplasmic autoantibodies disappeared in the only coeliac positive at diagnosis. CONCLUSION: More than half of untreated coeliacs are anti-S. cerevisiae-positive irrespective of the severity of mucosal damage. Differently from immunoglobulin A, anti-S. cerevisiae-immunoglobulin G persisted in more than 80% after gluten free diet. The high prevalence of anti-S. cerevisiae in coeliac disease suggests that they may be the effect of a non-specific immune response in course of chronic small bowel disease.},

Symbiosis between host and flora can be optimised by prebiotics. Inulin-type fructans have been shown to improve the metabolic functions of the commensal flora. Clinical and experimental data suggest that they also improve the gut mucosal barrier. Furthermore, modulation of the trophic functions of the flora by these prebiotics could help in the prevention of inflammatory bowel diseases. The anti-inflammatory effects of inulin or oligofructose have been assessed in the rat model of distal colitis induced by dextran sodium sulphate, which histologically resembles human ulcerative colitis, and in the trinitrobenzene sulphonic acid model that resembles human Crohn's disease. Both inulin and oligofructose stimulate colonic production of SCFA and favour the growth of indigenous lactobacilli and/or bifidobacteria. These effects are associated with reduced mucosal inflammation and decreased mucosal lesion scores. Inulin has also been tested in a placebo-controlled clinical trial in patients with relapsing pouchitis. Treatment reduced endoscopic and histological parameters of inflammation of the pouch mucosa. Inulin and oligofructose may offer an opportunity to prevent chronic inflammatory intestinal disorders, and this potential should be tested in further clinical studies.},

   abstract = {BACKGROUND: Genetics and environmental factors are implicated in the etiology of inflammatory bowel disease (IBD). We studied environmental factors in a population-based Swedish-Danish twin cohort using the co-twin control method. SUBJECTS AND METHODS: A questionnaire was sent to 317 twin pairs regarding markers of exposures in the following areas: infections/colonization and diet as well as smoking, appendectomy, and oral contraceptives. Odds ratios (OR) were calculated by conditional logistic regression. When confounding appeared plausible, multivariate conditional logistic regression was added. The questions were also divided into topic groups, and adjustment was made for multiple testing within each of the groups. RESULTS: The response rate to the questionnaire was 83%. In consideration of the study design, only discordant pairs were included (Crohn's disease [CD], n = 102; ulcerative colitis [UC], n = 125). Recurrent gastrointestinal infections were associated with both UC (OR, 8.0; 95% confidence interval [CI], 1.0-64) and CD (OR, 5.5; 95% CI, 1.2-25). Hospitalization for gastrointestinal infections was associated with CD (OR, 12; 95% CI, 1.6-92). Smoking was inversely associated with UC (OR, 0.4; 95% CI, 0.2-0.9) and associated with CD (OR, 2.9; 95% CI, 1.2-7.1). CONCLUSIONS: The observed associations indicate that markers of possible infectious events may influence the risk of IBD. Some of these effects might be mediated by long-term changes in gut flora or alterations in reactivity to the flora. The influence of smoking in IBD was confirmed.},

   abstract = {OBJECTIVES: Recent studies have indicated that bone mineral density is reduced in children with inflammatory bowel disease. The exact cause of this reduction is unclear, but it is often attributed to corticosteroid use. This study examined the prevalence of reduced bone mass in otherwise healthy children newly diagnosed with Crohn disease without previous corticosteroid exposure. METHODS: Eighteen steroid-naive children newly diagnosed with Crohn disease underwent dual energy x-ray absorptiometry. Disease activity, growth and pubertal development, nutritional assessment and bone mass measurements were recorded. z scores were adjusted for bone age. RESULTS: Five of the 18 patients (28%) had a total bone mineral density z score less than -1 (one had a z score less than -2). Ten (56%) subjects had lumbar spine bone mineral density z scores less than -1 (two had z score less than -2). The subjects had significantly reduced mean lumbar spine bone mineral density z scores (P = 0.002). Delayed pubertal development correlated with whole body bone mineral density z scores (r = 0.64; P = 0.004). Most subjects were not meeting United States recommended dietary allowances for daily intake of calcium, vitamin D and total calories. The majority of subjects were not participating in weight-bearing physical activity. CONCLUSION: Decreased bone mass is common in steroid naive children newly diagnosed with Crohn disease. Crohn disease appears to contribute to impaired bone mass independent of corticosteroid therapy.},

   abstract = {OBJECTIVE: Gastrointestinal (GI) damage caused by methotrexate (MTX) results in mucosal injury, bacterial invasion, and activation of an immune system that is reduced in function. Diets enriched with glutamine, short chain fatty acids (SCFAs), and transforming growth factor (TGF)-beta have demonstrated decreased infection, weight loss, and GI damage in Crohn disease. We, therefore, sought to study the cytoprotective effects of a diet enriched in glutamine, TGF-beta, and SFCAs (Modulen) in Fischer 344 rats exposed to MTX. METHODS: Rats were divided into five groups: two receiving normal saline and three receiving MTX and fed either normal chow, Modulen supplemented chow starting with the first MTX dose, or Modulen supplemented chow beginning 3 days before MTX injection. Rats were weighed daily. On day 5, albumin and bicarbonate levels were drawn, and rats were killed for examination of their intestinal mucosa by a pathologist unaware of groupings. RESULTS: Rats pretreated with Modulen supplemented chow maintained weight (2.6 vs, 12.3 g weight loss), albumin levels (3.13 vs, 2.43 mg/dL), and bicarbonate levels (23.8 vs. 18.1 mg/dL) as compared with rats fed normal chow throughout MTX treatment (P < 0.05). Pretreatment with Modulen also protected against crypt cell loss, villus atrophy, crypt abscesses, crypt/villus ratio, and overall histologic damage (P < 0.05). CONCLUSION: When administered before and during MTX treatment, Modulen supplementation provided statistically significant protection against weight loss, hypoalbuminemia, acidosis, and GI damage in a rat model. Future animal research of Modulen's protective effects with other chemotherapeutic agents is needed before human trials.},

   abstract = {BACKGROUND: The inflammatory bowel disease questionnaire (IBDQ) is a frequently used outcome parameter in clinical trials. Whereas the validity and reproducibility of the IBDQ have been extensively studied, there are limited data on its short-term responsiveness and cutoff values for remission and partial clinical response. METHODS: The IBDQ score and its bowel (BD), systemic (SysD), emotional (ED), and social (SocD) dimensions were tested for responsiveness in a cohort of 224 patients with Crohn's disease (CD) treated with infliximab for refractory luminal disease. Changes in the IBDQ score and its dimensions 4 weeks after therapy were analyzed and correlated with changes in the Crohn's Disease Activity Index (CDAI). The responsiveness ratios of the IBDQ and its dimensions were analyzed. Using regression line with DeltaCDAI, the cutoff values for the IBDQ remission and response were calculated. RESULTS: Overall, there was a good correlation between the CDAI and IBDQ at week 0 (correlation coefficient, 0.69; P < .001) and week 4 (-0.76; P < .001) and change after 4 weeks (0.74; P < .001). The correlation coefficients for DeltaCDAI and changes in BD, SysD, ED, and SocD were 0.753, 0.552, 0.620, and 0.631, respectively; all P < 0.001. The responsiveness ratios for DeltaIBDQ, BD, SysD, ED, and SocD were 2.6, 2.1, 1.9, 1.7, and 1.9, respectively. Regression line for the IBDQ (r = -0.76, P < .001) resulted in a cutoff value for remission of 168 points and for DeltaIBDQ resulted in a cutoff value of 22 and 27 points for clinical improvement based on DeltaCDAI > or = -70 and > or = -100 points. CONCLUSIONS: The IBDQ is a responsive instrument for reflecting quick change in the quality of life of patients with CD. Cutoff values for the IBDQ remission and partial response were 168 and > or = 27 points.},

   abstract = {BACKGROUND: Crohn's disease (CD) is a chronic relapsing disease. Especially acute period may be associated with metabolic disturbances. Alteration of lipid metabolism has been described in critically ill patients and hypocholesterolemia is associated with poor prognosis. The human organism acquires cholesterol by two principal processes - synthesis de novo, and absorption from the diet. It is possible to assess, using cholesterol synthesis markers (lathosterol) and cholesterol absorption markers (sitosterol, campesterol) the leading form of cholesterol acquisition. AIM: The aim of this study is assess the association between the lipid profile in plasma and the plasma concentration of sterols in active CD patients and in control subjects. METHOD: Routine laboratory tests, CDAI, lipid and non-cholesterol sterols plasma levels were performed on days 3, 14 and 28. The metabolic parameters have been compared with a control cohort of 100 healthy blood donors. RESULTS: Presently, complete data for 8 patients are available The serum total cholesterol, LDL and HDL cholesterol, and triglyceride concentrations were lower in patients with acute Crohn's disease than in the control group. Moreover lathosterol, campesterol and sitosterol concentrations were lower, whereas squalene concentration was higher than in controls. As mentioned above, complete data are not currently available. Therefore statistical analysis has not been finished. CONCLUSION: Our pre-results show substantial abnormalities in the concentrations of plasma lipids and non-cholesterol sterols, which are presented as markers of cholesterol requirement, in patients with acute CD.},

Two strongly associated cofactors have been identified: the presence of HLA-DQ2 or HLA-DQ8 in the host and specific antigenic peptides in the diet that are present in wheat, rye, and barley. Most patients have complete remission after dietary elimination of these foods. Crohn's disease is characterized by chronic, relapsing, recurrent, focal, transmural inflammation of the gastrointestinal tract that can lead to multiple serious problems requiring chronic medical and surgical therapy. Crohn's disease is associated with multiple genetic mutations, at least one of which has been clearly implicated in innate immunity. Multiple lines of evidence suggest that the disease involves abnormal immune responses to gut microbial flora.},

Research in the field of environmental factors in IBD is based upon epidemiological (geographical and case-control), clinical and experimental studies. The role of two environmental factors has clearly been established in IBD. Smoking is a risk factor for Crohn's disease and a protective factor for ulcerative colitis; appendectomy is a protective factor for ulcerative colitis. Many other environmental factors for IBD have been investigated, including infectious agents, diet, drugs, stress and social status. They are detailed in the present review. Among them, atypical Mycobacteria, oral contraceptives and antibiotics could play a role in Crohn's disease. To date, three hypotheses associate environmental factors with the pathophysiology of IBD (loss of tolerance of intestinal immune system towards commensal bacterial flora): the hygiene, infection and cold chain hypotheses. Much work remains to be done to identify risk factors for IBD. Research identifying environmental factors that might cause a predisposition to IBD is useful. It may lead to disease prevention in subjects who are genetically predisposed and disease improvement in patients.},

The distinction between physiological and pathological lymphoid hyperplasia of the intestinal tract is of importance in the context of a possible causative link with autism. A primary intestinal lesion may occur as part of the broad spectrum of immunological disorders to which autistic children are prone. This could result in increased intestinal permeability to peptides of dietary origin which may then lead to disruption of neuroregulatory mechanisms required for normal brain development. Alternatively, there could be a primary defect in the translocation and processing of factors derived from the intestinal lumen. These possibilities deserve further investigation and should not be lost in the fog of the controversy regarding the role of measles/mumps/rubella vaccination in the aetiology of autistic spectrum disorder.},

   abstract = {BACKGROUND AND AIMS: Total enteral nutrition (TEN) with a liquid formula can suppress gut inflammation and induce remission in active Crohn's disease. The mechanism is obscure. Studies have suggested that long term nutritional supplementation with a liquid formula (partial enteral nutrition (PEN)) may also suppress inflammation and prevent relapse. The aim of this study was to compare PEN with conventional TEN in active Crohn's disease. PATIENTS AND METHODS: Fifty children with a paediatric Crohn's disease activity index (PCDAI)>20 were randomly assigned to receive 50% (PEN) or 100% (TEN) of their energy requirement as elemental formula for six weeks. The PEN group was encouraged to eat an unrestricted diet while those receiving TEN were not allowed to eat. The primary outcome was achievement of remission (PCDAI<10). Secondary analyses of changes in erythrocyte sedimentation rate (ESR), C reactive protein, albumin, and platelets were performed to look for evidence of anti-inflammatory effects. RESULTS: Remission rate with PEN was lower than with TEN (15% v 42%; p=0.035). Although PCDAI fell in both groups (p=0.001 for both), the reduction was greater with TEN (p=0.005). Moreover, the fall in PCDAI with PEN was due to symptomatic and nutritional benefits. With both treatments there were significant improvements in relation to abdominal pain, "sense of wellbeing", and nutritional status. However, only TEN led to a reduction in diarrhoea (p=0.02), an increase in haemoglobin and albumin, and a fall in platelets and ESR. CONCLUSIONS: TEN suppresses inflammation in active Crohn's disease but PEN does not. This suggests that long term nutritional supplementation, although beneficial to some patients, is unlikely to suppress inflammation and so prevent disease relapse.},

In this study, we conducted a study of gastric motility in Crohn's disease using 20 healthy subjects (N group) and 15 patients with Crohn's disease (C group) by electrogastrography (EGG) using a Nipro electrogastrograph. An EGG was recorded for 30 minutes in a fasting state and after ingestion of 300 ml of a liquid meal. As an index of gastric emptying, the rate of change in the cross-sectional area of the gastric antrum was measured 1 and 15 minutes after ingestion of the liquid meal by external ultrasonography. In an EGG frequency analysis, waveforms with a peak of 3 cycles/minute (cpm) were noted in the N group, and the peak amplitude increased significantly after the ingestion of food. In the C group, division of the normal-gastria component was noted after the ingestion of food in 5 patients (33.3%). In a comparison of the peak amplitudes of fasting brady-gastria, normal-gastria, and tachy-gastria between the N and C groups, the peak amplitude was significantly increased in normal-gastria in the N group, and in brady-gastria and tachy-gastria in the C group. In a comparison of the rates of food ingestion-induced changes in the peak amplitudes for brady-gastria, normal-gastria, and tachy-gastria between the N and C groups, the peak amplitudes were significantly increased in normal-gastria in the N group, but not in the C group. In the case of gastric emptying investigated by external ultrasonography, the rate of food ingestion-induced change in the cross-sectional antrum area was significantly lower in the C group (50.5+/-9.2%) than in the N group (65.0+/-8.5%). For gastrointestinal motility, a 3 cpm normal-gastria represents efficient gastric motility. In the C group, the peak amplitudes of brady-gastria and tachy-gastria were significantly increased, but were low in normal-gastria in the fasting EGG, postprandial division of the normal-gastria component was noted, and the rate of food ingestion-induced increase in the normal-gastria peak amplitude was significantly lower than that in the N group, suggesting that patients with Crohn's disease have a functional abnormality in, not only the small and large intestine, but also the stomach.},

Numerous theories have been proposed in the past century concerning the cause of Crohn's disease and ulcerative colitis with implications for specific therapies. On further study, most of these ideas and therapies have failed to be accurate in theory or therapeutic approach. Others remain untested or are the focus of current investigation and controversy. This paper reviews the dominant theories of primary etiology. These hypotheses include infectious causes such as Mycobacteria paratuberculosis and measles. Allergic and nutritionally related causes have been the focus of considerable research. Microparticles, which is part of the concept behind toothpaste as a cause, have been suggested more broadly to be the principal factor initiating Crohn's disease. Several of these concepts rely on the idea that there is an increased intestinal permeability that is the central defect leading to Crohn's disease. Rather than being an excessive T cell driven process, Crohn's has been suggested to be an innate immune deficiency, leading to the use of colony stimulating factors to augment the intestinal barrier function and innate immunity. A variety of changes in the gut flora, ranging from a basic dysbiosis to the absence of helminths, have been proposed as the root cause of inflammatory bowel disease.},

   abstract = {A major advance in understanding diverticular disease occurred decades ago with the epidemiologic association between fiber intake and the development of diverticular disease. This association has been well documented with investigations into the emergence of diverticular disease in underdeveloped countries where the disease had been virtually unknown before the adoption of a westernized diet, low in fiber. The high frequency of right-sided diverticular disease in Asian countries diverges from what is seen in the West. The physiologic effects of insoluble fiber has been well examined as well, increasing bulk and decreasing transit time, with a deficiency contributing to the high pressures implicated in the physiology which leads to diverticular disease. However, at most, 10% to 25% of individuals with diverticular disease will develop diverticulitis. Risk factors for symptomatic diverticular have been increasingly described in recent years with obesity and red meat intake being of particular importance, in addition to age. However, the known factors poorly identify those at increased risk and the predisposing pathophysiology is incompletely understood as well. Insoluble fiber, but not soluble fiber, has been viewed as the principal component which has been deficient in western diets and is the culprit which leads to the establishment of diverticular disease and in turn, diverticulitis. Soluble fiber and its effect on the intestinal flora is proposed as having significant influence on the development of diverticulitis. This understanding, if demonstrated, would have important implications for the primary and secondary prevention of diverticulitis.},

   abstract = {Because of the wide variations in the clinical presentation of celiac disease and because treatment exists that is effective in most cases, screening of the general population for celiac disease has been considered. There is still no evidence that patients who have symptom-free celiac disease are at increased risk of small intestinal lymphoma or other complications. Prevention of osteoporosis seems to be the strongest indicator for widespread screening today [22]. The major cause of failure to respond to a gluten-free diet is continuing ingestion of gluten, but other underlying diseases must be considered. Many different drugs (eg, anti-tumor necrosis factor [TNF]-alpha) have been used in patients who have RCD [23]. Steroid treatment has been reported to be effective even in patients who have underlying early EATL. Histologic recovery in patients who have celiac disease usually takes several months but can take up to 1 year, even if the patient remains on a strict gluten-free diet. Some patients report celiac-related symptoms for months after a single gluten intake. The definitions for RCD in literature vary. The authors consider the definition give by Daum and colleagues [24] suitable. They defined true RCD as villous atrophy with crypt hyperplasia and increased IELs persisting for more than 12 months in spite of a strict gluten-free diet. If a patient is not responding well to a gluten-free diet, three considerations are necessary: (1) the initial diagnosis of celiac disease must be reassessed;(2) the patient should be sent to a dietician to check for errors in diet or compliance problems, because problems with the gluten-free diet are the most important cause for persisting symptoms; (3) other reasons for persisting symptoms (eg, pancreatic insufficiency, irritable bowel syndrome, bacterial overgrowth, lymphocytic colitis, collagenous colitis, ulcerative jejunitis, protein-losing enteropathy,T-cell lymphoma, fructose intolerance, cavitating lymphadenopathy, and tropical sprue) should be considered. Other causes for villous atrophy are Crohn's disease, collagenous sprue, and autoimmune enteropathy. Abdulkarim and colleagues [25] examined 55 patients who had a diagnosis of nonresponsive celiac disease. He found that 6 did not have celiac disease, and25 still had some gluten ingestion.Tursi and colleagues [26] reported 15 patients who had celiac disease with persisting symptoms. Because histology improved in all patients after several months, RCD was excluded. Of the 15 patients, 10 had small intestinal bacterial overgrowth, 2 showed lactose malabsorption causing the described symptoms, 1 had mistakenly taken an antibiotic containing gluten, and 1 patient each had Giardia lamblia and Ascaris lumbricoides. Thus, other entities must be considered in patients who have celiac disease and ongoing symptoms. In a follow-up clinical trial, 158 patients who had celiac disease underwent follow-up small intestine biopsies within 2 years after starting a gluten-free diet. Eleven patients (7.0%) with persisting (partial) villous atrophy were considered to have RCD; 5 of them developed EATL [27].RCD type I is characterized by normal expression of T-cell antigens and polyclonal TCR gene rearrangement.RCD type II is characterized by an abnormal IEL phenotype with the expression of intracytoplasmic CD3e, surface CD103, and the lack of classic surface T-cell markers such as CD8, CD4, and TCR-alpha/beta. This clonal IEL population can be considered crypt IEL [24]. RCD II has a poor prognosis, which is a problem for therapy. Clonal TCR gene rearrangements and loss of T-cell antigens such as CD8 and TCR-beta in IELs may indicate the development of an EATL in patients who have RCD. The markers for an overt EATL are a positive stool blood test, increased lactate dehydrogenase, or beta2-microglobulin [24]. If an overt lymphoma is suspected, upper and lower endoscopy, an ear, nose, and throat work-up, CT scan, capsule endoscopy, and possibly double-balloon enteroscopy should be performed. Most reports of the difficulties in treating patients who have true RCE are casereports. Turner and colleagues [28] reported on an induction of remission by useof the anti-TNF-alpha antibody infliximab and maintenance with prednisoloneand azathioprine. Olaussen and colleagues [29] and Mandal and colleagues [30]tried a nonimmunogenic elemental diet. Gillet and colleagues [31] reported successful treatment of a patient who hadRCD using anti-TNF-alpha antibodies (infliximab) for induction and azathioprinefor maintenance. Maurino and colleagues [32] studied seven consecutive patients diagnosed ashaving refractory sprue and no response to oral or parenteral steroids. Aftertreatment with azathioprine (2 mg/kg/d) and oral prednisone (1 mg/kg/d), fivepatients had a complete clinical remission. Two patients who did not respond totreatment at any time died. Goerres and colleagues [33] described 18 patients who had RCD, 10 of whomhad type I RCD, and 8 of whom had type II RCD. Treatment consisted ofazathioprine combined with prednisone for 1 year. Consistent with reports byother investigators, the response rates in the two groups differed. Eight of the10 patients who had type I RCD had a histologic response. Seven of the eightpatients who had type II RCD died, and six of the eight developed a lymphoma. At present there is no effective treatment for type II RCD.Fig. 3 presents a proposed algorithm for monitoring patients who have ce-liac disease.},

   abstract = {OBJECTIVES: Previous studies have suggested that inflammatory bowel disease (IBD) patients rank high among users of complementary and alternative medicine (CAM). To further elucidate this phenomenon, we sent questionnaires to a large sample of IBD patients in Germany to determine the patterns and predictors of their CAM use. METHODS: Pretested 73-item questionnaires were mailed to a randomly selected representative sample of 1000 IBD patients from the approximately 16,000 members and associates of the German Crohn's and Colitis Association. Predictors of CAM use were evaluated by logistic regression models. RESULTS: Completed questionnaires were returned by 684 patients (female patients, 61.4%; Crohn's disease patients, 58.3%; ulcerative colitis patients, 38.2%). Of the 671 adult respondents, 344 (51.3%) had experience with CAM, and significantly more of the ulcerative colitis patients (59.8%) than the Crohn's disease patients (48.3%) had experience with CAM. There was no difference by gender. Homeopathy (52.9%) and herbal medicine (43.6%) were the most commonly used types of CAM. The most frequent personal reasons for CAM use were the search for an "optimum treatment" (78.9%) and the wish to stop taking steroids (63.8%). Using logistic regression, we found that total cortisone intake (P = 0.0077), but not duration of disease, was a strong predictor of CAM use. Other predictors were experience with psychosomatic and psychotherapeutic support (P = 0.0029), relaxation techniques (P = 0.0284), an academic education (P = 0.0173), a diet utilizing whole grains (P = 0.0123), and a normal body weight (P = 0.0215). Although 80% of patients indicated that they were interested in using CAM in the future, only 24.7% felt sufficiently informed about it. CONCLUSIONS: More than 50% of a large group of German IBD patients had used CAM. Prolonged or intensive steroid treatment, an academic education, active ways of coping, and a health-conscious life-style are associated with CAM use. Given the potential side effects and interactions, the treating physician should focus on thorough information about the benefits and limitations of conventional and complementary treatment options, especially for IBD patients who have received prolonged or intensive steroid treatment.},

   abstract = {Crohn's disease (CD) is associated with a number of secondary conditions including osteoporosis, which increases the risk of bone fracture. The cause of metabolic bone disease in this population is believed to be multifactorial and may include the disease itself and associated inflammation, high-dose corticosteroid use, weight loss and malabsorption, a lack of exercise and physical activity, and an underlying genetic predisposition to bone loss. Reduced bone mineral density has been reported in between 5% to 80% of CD sufferers, although it is generally believed that approximately 40% of patients suffer from osteopenia and 15% from osteoporosis. Recent studies suggest a small but significantly increased risk of fracture compared with healthy controls and, perhaps, sufferers of other gastrointestinal disorders such as ulcerative colitis. The role of physical activity and exercise in the prevention and treatment of CD-related bone loss has received little attention, despite the benefits of specific exercises being well documented in healthy populations. This article reviews the prevalence of and risk factors for low bone mass in CD patients and examines various treatments for osteoporosis in these patients, with a particular focus on physical activity.},

   abstract = {OBJECTIVE: To present the case of a collegiate tennis player with celiac disease symptoms. BACKGROUND: Celiac disease is a common intestinal disorder that is often confused with other conditions. It causes severe intestinal damage manifested by several uncomfortable signs and symptoms. Failure by the sports medicine staff to recognize symptoms consistent with celiac disease and treat them appropriately can have deleterious consequences for the athlete. DIFFERENTIAL DIAGNOSIS: Irritable bowel syndrome, Crohn disease, Addison disease, lupus erythematosus, juvenile rheumatoid arthritis, lactose intolerance, herpes zoster, psychogenic disorder (depression), fibromyalgia, complex regional pain syndrome, hyperthyroidism, anemia, type I diabetes. TREATMENT: The athlete underwent a series of blood and allergen tests to confirm or refute a diagnosis of celiac disease. When celiac disease was suspected, dietary modifications were made to eliminate all wheat-based and gluten-based products from the athlete's diet. UNIQUENESS: The athlete was able to fully compete in a competitive National Collegiate Athletic Association Division I tennis program while experiencing the debilitating effects associated with celiac disease. The immediacy of symptom onset was notable because the athlete had no history of similar complaints. CONCLUSIONS: Celiac disease is a potentially life-threatening condition that affects more people than reported. A properly educated sports medicine staff can help to identify symptoms consistent with celiac disease early, so damage to the intestine is minimized. Prompt recognition and appropriate management allow the athlete to adjust the diet accordingly, compete at a high-caliber level, and enjoy a healthier quality of life.},

   abstract = {BACKGROUND: Exclusive enteral nutrition (EN) is an established primary therapy for pediatric Crohn's disease (CD). The mechanism of action of such treatment is still conjectural. The aim of the present study was to investigate if EN-induced remission is associated with modification of the fecal microflora in CD. METHODS: Stool samples were collected from 5 healthy children and adolescents over a period of 3 months, and from 9 children and adolescents with active CD. To induce disease remission, children with CD received a course of exclusive EN for 8 weeks with a polymeric formula (Modulen IBD, Nestle). At the end of the course of exclusive EN, children returned to a free diet but continued to take 40% of the daily caloric intake as polymeric formula. Fecal microflora was analyzed by 16S ribosomal DNA polymerase chain reaction and temperature gradient gel electrophoresis (TGGE) with direct visual comparison of band profiles of PCR products. RESULTS: In 8 of 9 children, the exclusive EN alone induced disease remission. In 1 child, it was necessary to add steroids to the exclusive EN course to achieve remission. In all children with CD, analysis of gel band distribution revealed profound modification of the fecal microflora after exclusive EN. Variations of band distribution corresponding to different bacterial species were observed also in children on partial EN and required time to achieve stability of the band profile. In contrast, control healthy children showed a host-specific and stable TGGE profile over time. CONCLUSION: These data suggest that a possible mechanism of action of EN in inducing disease remission in CD is the capacity of modification of gut microflora. Possible explanations of such capacity are both low residue and prebiotic properties of the polymeric liquid formula.},

   abstract = {BACKGROUND AND AIMS: Dietary microparticles, which are bacteria-sized and non-biological, found in the modern Western diet, have been implicated in both the aetiology and pathogenesis of Crohn's disease. Following on from the findings of a previous pilot study, we aimed to confirm whether a reduction in the amount of dietary microparticles facilitates induction of remission in patients with active Crohn's disease, in a single-blind, randomized, multi-centre, placebo controlled trial. METHODS: Eighty-three patients with active Crohn's disease were randomly allocated in a 2 x 2 factorial design to a diet low or normal in microparticles and/or calcium for 16 weeks. All patients received a reducing dose of prednisolone for 6 weeks. Outcome measures were Crohn's disease activity index, Van Hees index, quality of life and a series of objective measures of inflammation including erythrocyte sedimentation rate, C-reactive protein, intestinal permeability and faecal calprotectin. After 16 weeks patients returned to their normal diet and were followed up for a further 36 weeks. RESULTS: Dietary manipulation provided no added effect to corticosteroid treatment on any of the outcome measures during the dietary trial (16 weeks) or follow-up (to 1 year); e.g., for logistic regression of Crohn's disease activity index based rates of remission (P=0.1) and clinical response (P=0.8), in normal versus low microparticle groups. CONCLUSIONS: Our adequately powered and carefully controlled dietary trial found no evidence that reducing microparticle intake aids remission in active Crohn's disease.},

Several factors probably contribute to the development of this condition. Recently discovered technologies have clarified the role of bacterial species, which may account for intestinal dysbiosis, as a factor triggering ulcerative colitis. Genetic susceptibility together with abnormal innate immunoreactivity probably comprise the essential prerequisites for the initiation and perpetuation of ulcerative colitis. Although the genetic background has been more clearly recognised in patients with Crohn's disease than in those with ulcerative colitis, some candidate loci associated with ulcerative colitis have also been intensively studied. Additionally, environmental factors may interfere with inherent predispositions to ulcerative colitis, and either suppress or reinforce them. Whatever the origin, the search for the aetiology of ulcerative colitis must have the same goal: the improvement of treatment and the quality of life in patients with ulcerative colitis.},

   abstract = {Crohns disease is an inflammatory bowel disease that can have a significant impact on the health of those afflicted. The etiology of the disease is unknown, but genetic, environmental, dietary, and immunological factors are thought to be involved. Multiple nutrients can become depleted during active disease due to inadequate intake or malabsorption. Preventing these deficiencies is paramount in the care of those suffering from Crohns disease. Often the traditional treatments (medications) have limited effectiveness and negative side effects that inhibit their use. Enteral nutrition has promising therapeutic benefits, but its use is often limited to the pediatric population due to poor patient acceptability. Omega-3 fatty acids have been investigated for their anti-inflammatory properties as an alternative to traditional care. This article reviews the etiology of Crohns disease, nutritional deficiencies, traditional treatments, and the use of omega-3 fatty acids in the prevention of Crohns recurrence. The results from clinical trials have been conflicting, but a new fish oil preparation that limits the side effects of traditional fish oil therapy shows promise as an adjunctive treatment for Crohns disease.

   abstract = {This review highlights the huge advances made in the understanding of Crohn's disease in the last 15 years. The pathogenic immune response in the gut wall is a highly polarised T helper cell type 1 response, probably directed against antigens of the commensal flora. There is marked over-expression of pro-inflammatory cytokines such as tumor necrosis factor (TNF)-alpha and increased production of matrix degrading enzymes by fibroblasts and macrophages, which are probably responsible for ulceration and fistula formation. Crohn's disease runs in families and the susceptibility genes identified so far are associated with innate recognition of microbial products (Nod2) or epithelial barrier function (OCTN cation transporter genes and DLG5). Endogenous healing pathways mediated by transforming growth factor (TGF)-beta1 are inhibited because mucosal inflammatory cells express Smad7, the endogenous intracellular inhibitor of TGF-beta signalling. This makes it unlikely that enteral feeds containing TFG-beta are therapeutic by means of direct anti-inflammatory effects, however TGF-beta may still be involved because it is a well known epithelial motogen and may promote mucosal healing, in synergy with changes in mucosal bacterial populations as a result of the change in the diet.},

   abstract = {BACKGROUND: Prebiotics are short-chain carbohydrates that alter the composition, or metabolism, of the gut microbiota in a beneficial manner. It is therefore expected that prebiotics will improve health in a way similar to probiotics, whilst at the same time being cheaper, and carrying less risk and being easier to incorporate into the diet than probiotics. AIM: To review published evidence for prebiotic effects on gut function and human health. METHODS: We searched the Science Citation Index with the terms prebiotic, microbiota, gut bacteria, large intestine, mucosa, bowel habit, constipation, diarrhoea, inflammatory bowel disease, Crohn's disease, ulcerative colitis, pouchitis, calcium and cancer, focussing principally on studies in humans and reports in the English language. Search of the Cochrane Library did not identify any clinical study or meta-analysis on this topic. RESULTS: Three prebiotics, oligofructose, galacto-oligosaccharides and lactulose, clearly alter the balance of the large bowel microbiota by increasing bifidobacteria and Lactobacillus numbers. These carbohydrates are fermented and give rise to short-chain fatty acid and intestinal gas; however, effects on bowel habit are relatively small. Randomized-controlled trials of their effect in a clinical context are few, although animal studies show anti-inflammatory effects in inflammatory bowel disease, while calcium absorption is increased. CONCLUSIONS: It is still early days for prebiotics, but they offer the potential to modify the gut microbial balance in such a way as to bring direct health benefits cheaply and safely.},

   abstract = {BACKGROUND: Anti-Saccharomyces cerevisiae antibodies (ASCAs) are known to be positive in about 65% of Crohn's disease patients, in up to 43% of coeliac disease patients and in 0-5% of healthy controls. Coeliac disease might be an in-vivo model for unravelling the role of mucosal integrity in the formation of ASCAs since mucosal abnormalities normalize during a gluten-free diet (GFD). AIMS: Firstly, to evaluate, retrospectively, the frequency of ASCA positivity in coeliac patients both at diagnosis and during follow-up on a GFD. Secondly, to study the correlation between ASCA positivity and mucosal damage. METHODS: One hundred and eleven patients with histologically proven coeliac disease, positive endomysium antibodies on diagnosis and normalization of trans-glutaminase antibodies (t-TGAs) after successful adherence to a GFD were included. ASCAs, IgA and IgG were tested by enzyme-linked immunosorbent assays both at diagnosis and after the GFD. RESULTS: Eighty-three children and 28 adults were included in this study. The mean age at diagnosis was 4.6 years for children and 48 years for adults. At diagnosis 15/83 (18%) of children were ASCA positive (either IgG or IgA), compared to 17/28 (61%) of adults. After successful adherence to a GFD and normalization of t-TGAs only one child remained ASCA positive (1%) compared to eight adults (29%). Two out of 28 (7%) adults remained positive for both IgA and IgG ASCAs. CONCLUSION: In the majority of patients ASCAs disappeared during a GFD. In children this disappearance of ASCA positivity was more pronounced. This can be explained by the well-known fact that gut permeability normalizes much better in children than in adults. Also, the adults had higher levels of ASCAs at diagnosis. This was probably because they had been exposed to gluten for longer and therefore had more long-lasting damage.},

However, laparoscopy in inflammatory bowel disease has unique challenges that must be overcome. For the patient with uncomplicated terminal ileal Crohn's disease, there are definite reproducible advantages to a minimally invasive approach. As surgeons gain experience, more complex cases may be attempted laparoscopically with a low threshold to alternate the approach if difficulties are encountered. We will continue to "push the envelope" in patients with complex Crohn's disease to allow more to be done in complex cases. For the patient with Crohn's colitis and ulcerative colitis, the role of a minimally invasive approach is less well defined. In experienced hands, a laparoscopic total colectomy can be performed safely and offers the patient all the advantages seen with laparoscopic segmental resection. Outcomes are likely to improve with better training, techniques, and equipment. As the field of minimally invasive surgery continues to expand, what is being "pushed" today will be routine in the future.},

In some patients, adaptation is inadequate and may require special techniques to enhance and augment this process. This is a case of a 52-year-old woman who experienced increased stoma output 1 week after major intestinal resection, resulting in dehydration. She required IV fluids in order to maintain hydration. After the initiation of an intestinal rehabilitation program, which included modified diet, soluble fiber, oral rehydration solution (ORS), and medications, IV fluids were successfully weaned off in 3 months. She continues not to receive IV fluids and continues to follow the intestinal rehabilitation plan.},

   abstract = {In Japan, nutritional therapy as both a primary and as a secondary treatment is widely used for Crohn's disease (CD). The rationale for its use is based on a variety of reasons. The first is its ability to induce remission and to ameliorate the activity of intestinal lesions in the short term by enteral (EN) or by parenteral nutritional therapy in which overexpressions of chemokine receptors in an active stage are decreased significantly in the remission stage. Second is its ability to maintain remission over the long term through home-based enteral nutrition in which tube feeding during the nighttime is encouraged. Third is its ability to reduce the steroid dosage over the period of a long-term treatment course. However, several disadvantages of this therapy such as unpalatability and sluggish effect have been pointed out. Several studies have attempted to resolve this issue and determine the best components of EN, especially in fat composition. Some data have been suggestive of too much long-chained fatty acid having a hazardous effect on EN's clinical efficacy because it works as a precursor of inflammatory prostaglandins. Our recent data show that medium-chained triglyceride did not have such a hazardous effect on clinical efficacy. Several studies suggested that the patient factors that were resistant to inducing remission in the short term were a long period of suffering CD, a high activity (on Crohn's Disease Activity Index, CDAI), hemorrhagic colitis, and colitis with marked cobblestoning. Japanese guidelines for the treatment of CD recommended nutritional therapy as a first-line therapy and as a maintenance therapy after inducing remission. This treatment policy has led to Japanese CD patients having lower mortality rates than that of patients who do not receive EN. If this therapy could be combined with other drug therapies, including strong immunosuppressants, treatment strategies would be improved over those we have at present.},

   abstract = {OBJECTIVE: The aim of this investigation was to elucidate retrospectively the therapeutic effect of infliximab in patients with active Crohn's disease (CD) under nutritional therapy. MATERIAL AND METHODS: Using a review of the clinical records in 24 nationwide institutions specializing in inflammatory bowel disease, the short-term effect of infliximab in 97 patients with active CD was retrospectively investigated. The Crohn's disease activity index (CDAI) at baseline and after 2 weeks of a single infliximab administration (5 mg/kg) was compared among patients under total parenteral nutrition (TPN group, n=36), those following an elemental or polymeric diet (EN group, n=49) and those without TPN and EN (NN group, n=12). A decrease in CDAI >or= 70 or a CDAI value <150 at 2 weeks was regarded as effective. RESULTS: There was no difference in CDAI at baseline among the three groups. In each group, CDAI decreased significantly (from 250 (195-290) [median (interquartiles)] to 152 (123-233) in the TPN group, p<0.0001; from 259 (200-325) to 180 (130-238) in the EN group, p<0.0001; from 278 (222-291) to 164 (132-196) in the NN group, p=0.003). Infliximab was effective in 63.9% of patients in the TPN group, in 55.1% of those in the EN group and in 75% of the NN group. There was no statistical difference in efficacy among the three groups (p=0.4). Multivariate logistic regression analysis revealed younger age to be a significant factor related to the efficacy of infliximab. CONCLUSIONS: Infliximab is effective in patients with CD under TPN or EN. Age at infliximab administration may be predictive of response to infliximab.},

AIMS: To compare vitamin D status and bone turnover markers in Crohn's disease patients with age- and sex-matched controls during late-summer and late-winter. SUBJECTS: Crohn's disease patients (n = 44; mean age 36.9 years, currently in remission) and matched controls (n = 44) were recruited from Cork University Hospital and Cork City area, respectively. METHODS: Bloods were analysed for 25-hydroxyvitamin D, parathyroid hormone, bone-specific alkaline phosphatase, osteocalcin and urine analysed for N-telopeptides of type 1 collagen. RESULTS: Serum 25-hydroxyvitamin D concentrations were significantly (P < 0.003) lower in Crohn's disease patients than in control subjects during both seasons. In Crohn's disease patients, serum 25-hydroxyvitamin D concentrations were lower (P < 0.0001) whereas serum parathyroid hormone, osteocalcin and bone-specific alkaline phosphatase and urinary N-telopeptides of type 1 collagen levels were higher (P < 0.001) during late-winter than late-summer. CONCLUSION: There were notable seasonal variations in vitamin D status and bone turnover markers in Crohn's disease patients. The impact of winter decline in vitamin D status and increase in bone turnover on long-term risk of osteopenia/osteoporosis in Crohn's disease patients is unclear.},

   abstract = {PURPOSE OF REVIEW: This review reports on the recent progress understanding mechanisms of action and clinical applications of probiotics. RECENT FINDINGS: New insights on regulating mechanisms of intestinal commensal bacteria to prevent and treat different gastrointestinal diseases have been reported. Some probiotics, though not all, exert beneficial effects by modulating the mucosal barrier function and immune activity. It seems that a combination of different probiotics is more effective than a single strain. It was demonstrated that not only viable bacteria administered to the intestinal tract but also isolated probiotic DNA is active, even if injected subcutaneously. There is reasonable evidence to recommend probiotics in infectious diarrhoea for prevention and treatment (mainly in children) and to prevent antibiotic-induced gastrointestinal side effects. Furthermore, probiotics are effective in maintaining remission in ulcerative colitis and preventing and treating pouchitis. Promising positive effects were published in major surgery patients (gastric resection, pancreatic resection, liver transplantation) and in severe necrotising acute pancreatitis. SUMMARY: Increasing knowledge on probiotics is exciting, but in the near future it must be defined which probiotics (single strains or a combination) are most effective in specific diseases. Well-designed, randomized clinical trials are still required to further define the role of probiotics as preventive and therapeutic agents.},

   abstract = {AIM: To investigate the influence of fish oil enriched enteral diet on intestinal tissues taken from Crohn's disease (CD), ulcerative colitis (UC) and non-inflamed non-IBD control patients in vitro. METHODS: Colonoscopic biopsies from patients with active CD (n = 4), active UC (n = 7), and non-inflamed non-IBD control patients (n = 4) were incubated (three dilutions of 1:20, 1:10, and 1:5) with Waymouth's culture medium and enteral elemental diet (EO28, SHS, Liverpool, UK) modified in the fatty acid composition with fish oil (EF) in an organ culture system for 24 h. In each experimental set-up, incubation with Waymouth's medium alone as control was included. Tissue viability was assessed by adding bromodeoxyuridine (BrdU) to the culture fluid and immunohistochemically staining for BrdU uptake. Cytokine ratio of IL-1ra/IL-1beta (low ratio indicative of inflammation) and production of those cytokines as a percentage of medium control were assayed in the culture supernatant. RESULTS: Incubation of CD-affected tissue with EF (1:20, 1:10, and 1:5) modestly and non-significantly increased IL-1ra/IL-1beta ratio as compared with medium control (CD 39.1+/-16.1; 26.5+/-7.8, 47.1+/-16.8 vs control 13.0+/-2.2), but incubation of UC-affected tissues increased IL-1ra/IL-1beta ratio significantly in all three dilutions (UC 69.1+/-32.2, P<0.05; 76.1+/-36.4, P = 0.05; 84.5+/-37.3, P<0.02; vs control 10.2+/-3.7). Incubation of non-inflamed non-IBD control tissue did not increase the IL-1ra/IL-1beta ratio in any dilution compared to medium control (69.3+/-47.0, 54.1+/-30.6, 79.4+/-34.0 vs control 76.1+/-37.3). Average percentage production of IL-1beta indexed against medium control was significantly less in UC after EF incubation as compared with CD (UC 24.0+/-4.8 vs CD 51.8+/-8.1; P<0.05). Average percentage production of IL-1ra was markedly higher in UC (135.9+/-3.4) than that in control patients (36.5+/-4.3) (P<0.0001). CONCLUSION: IBD tissues, after incubation with elemental diet modified in its fatty acid composition with fish oil, show an increase in IL-1ra/IL-1beta cytokine ratio. This effect of omega-3 fatty acid modulation is significantly more marked in UC compared with CD and is accompanied by both a reduction of IL-1beta and increase of IL-1ra. The positive direct anti-inflammatory effect of elemental diet with fish oil in tissue affected with UC suggests dietary treatment of UC may be possible.},

Crohn's disease (CD) and Ulcerative colitis (UC) are collectively referred to as inflammatory bowel diseases (IBD). IBD appears to result from dysregulated immune response with contributions from genetic predisposition and environmental factors. Among environmental factors the enteric microflora and the components of food (eg. antigens) may play important role in the pathogenesis of IBD. The aim of the authors' study was to detect IgE type antibodies against the most frequent food allergens in patients with IBD and IBS. METHODS: Antibodies against food allergens (IgE type) with ELISA method in patients with CD, UC and IBS were quantitatively measured. The figures were compared to the result of a healthy control group contains the same number of participants, and the frequency of food allergy in these patient groups were determined. RESULTS: On the basis of the study the presence of increased IgE type immune response against any food allergens was 34.5% (p = 0.01) in the group of IBS. In patients with CD or UC the immune response against food allergens was also more frequent than in the control group. The order of frequency of food allergens in IBS was the following: milk protein, soybean, tomato, peanut, egg white. CONCLUSION: As the occurrence of food allergens was significantly higher in IBS group than in the control group, the role of food allergy in the symptoms of IBS can be come up. The frequency of food allergy in patients with diagnosis of IBS, and the similarity of symptoms of this two diseases give an obvious opportunity for the patients with IBS to use a diet avoiding the most frequent food allergens, or take e.g. Na-cromoglycate which is useful therapy in food allergy.},

Therefore, modulation of microflora with probiotics or prebiotics may offer a plausible therapeutic approach. While recent data support a potential therapeutic efficacy, such treatments need to be further assessed by large scale studies. A better understanding of the intestinal microflora and the mechanisms of their action may help us to develop more effective treatment for inflammatory bowel disease.},

   abstract = {OBJECTIVE: To report the results of the Home-based Parenteral Nutrition (HBPN) registry of the NADYA-SENPE working group, for the year 2003. MATERIAL AND METHODS: Gathering of registry data introduced by all units responsible of HBPN patient care. This an on-line registry available for authorized users of the working group web page (www.nadya-senpe.com). Epidemiological data, diagnosis, access route, complications, hospital admissions, disability degree, and course at December 31st, 2003 RESULTS: Data from 86 patients (62% female and 38% male) from 17 hospitals were gathered. Mean age of adult patients was 50.7 +/- 15.0 years, whereas for patients younger than 14 years was 2.4 +/- 1.5 years (n = 5 patients). Diseases that prone HBPN were neoplasm (21%), followed by mesenteric ischemia (20%), radiation enteritis (16.3%), motility impairments (10.5%), and Crohn's disease (4.6%). Tunneled catheters were used in 66.3% of the cases versus 29.1% of subcutaneous reservoirs. Mean treatment duration has been 8.5 +/- 4.6 months; 67.4% of patients had been on HBPN for a period of time longer than 6 months. Patient follow-up was mostly done from the reference area hospital (88.4%). In no case patient follow-up was done by the primary care team or by specialists other than those prescribing nutritional support. Nutritional support-related complications were seen in 98 occasions. The most frequent complications were infectious ones. They represented 1.60 hospital admissions per patient. The mean number of visits was 7.9 per patient (6.4 for scheduled visits and 1.5 for emergency visits). By the end of the year, we observed that 73.3% of the patients were still on the program, whereas in 23.3% HBPN had been withdrawn. The main reasons for withdrawal were decease (11 patients), and advancing to oral diet (9 patients). As for the disability degree, 13% were confined to a wheelchair or bed, and only 28% had no disability degree or only mild social disability. CONCLUSIONS: We observed a mild increase in HBPN prevalence rate in Spain (2.15 patients pmp). The main indication was cancer followed by short-bowel syndrome secondary to vascular pathology. Nutritional support-related complications were common, especially those of an infectious origin.},

MATERIALS AND METHOD: Compilation of the registry data loaded by the Units in charge of HPN patients care. It consists of an on-line registry available to the registered users of the group's web page (www.nadya-senpe.com). Epidemiological, diagnostic, access route, complications, hospital admissions, degree of disability, and course until December 31st of 2002. RESULTS: Data from 74 patients were gathered (56.8% women and 43.2% men), from 18 hospital centers. Mean age of adult patients was 49.4 +/- 15.5 years and 2.3-1.1 years for patients younger than 14 years (n=3 patients). Diseases that prompted the use of HPN were mesenteric ischemia (29.7%), followed by neoplasms (16.2%), radiation enteritis (12.2%), motility impairments (8.1%), and Crohn's disease (5.4%). Tunneled catheters were used in 52.7% of cases, as compared to 36.5% of subcutaneous reservoirs. Mean treatment duration was 8.7 +/- 4.4 months; 68.9% of patients remained on HPN for a duration longer than 6 months, and in 41.9% longer than one year. Patients' follow-up was mainly done from the reference hospital (87.8%), and the remaining patients (12.5%) by the home care team. In no case patients were followed by the primary care team or other specialists than the ones that prescribed nutritional support. In 94 cases there were complications related to nutritional therapy. The more frequent complications presented were infectious. These complications represented 1.84 admissions per patient. The mean number of visits was 12.9 per patient (10.2 routinary visits and 2.7 emergency visits). At the end of the year, we observed that 74.3% patients stayed in the program, whereas in the remaining 23.6% HPN had been discontinued. The main causes for discontinuation were death (52.9%), and switch to oral diet (23.5%) or enteral nutrition (11.8%). With regards to disability degree, 16.1% were confined to a wheelchair or bed, and 17.6% had no disability at all or only a mild social disability. CONCLUSIONS: We observed a sustained HPN prevalence rate in Spain (1.8 patient pmp). The main cause for its use was short bowel syndrome secondary to vascular disease, followed by cancer. Complications associated to nutritional therapy were common, especially of infectious origin.},

   abstract = {BACKGROUND: Studies in animal models of inflammatory bowel disease (IBD) suggest that supplementation of total parenteral nutrition with glutamine (gln), a conditionally essential amino acid in catabolic conditions, increases gln plasma concentrations, reduces intestinal damage, improves nitrogen balance and may improve the course of the disease. However, human data supporting this assumption are missing. METHODS: A total of 24 consecutive patients with an acute exacerbation of IBD (19 Crohn's disease; five ulcerative colitis) and scheduled for total parenteral nutrition (TPN) (>7 days) were randomised. Parallel to a standardised anti-inflammatory therapy, the patients received either a TPN with 1.5 g/kg body weight of a standard amino acid or an isonitrogenic, isocaloric TPN with 1.2 g/kg body weight of a standard amino acid and 0.3 g/kg L-alanine-L-glutamine. Primary end points were gln plasma concentrations and intestinal permeability assessed by urinary lactulose and D-xylose ratio. RESULTS: Gln plasma levels did not differ significantly in either group throughout the study. Intestinal permeability did not change within 7 days either with or without gln supplementation (Delta-lactulose/xylose ratio: 0.01+/-0.05 (gln+) vs 0.02+/-0.1 (gln-)). The observed changes in inflammatory and nutritional parameters, and also disease activity, length of TPN and hospital stay, were independent of glutamine substitution. Five (41%) patients in the gln+ group and three (25%) patients in the gln- group needed surgical intervention. CONCLUSION: Although limited by the sample size, these results do not support the hypothesis that glutamine substitution has an obvious biochemical or clinical benefit in patients with active IBD scheduled for total parenteral nutrition.},

This role includes the prevention and correction of malnutrition, the prevention of osteoporosis and in children the promotion of optimal growth and development. In active Crohn's disease nutritional therapy (in the form of enteral feeding) is an effective primary therapy for many patients. Corticosteroids, however, are more effective than enteral diet therapy in adults. Enteral diets should be considered as primary therapy in pediatric Crohn's disease, especially in children with poor nutritional status or growth impairment. Enteral nutrition does not have a proven primary therapeutic role in ulcerative colitis. There are many theories that suggest that diet may be implicated in the aetiology of inflammatory bowel disease, however, there are, as yet, no dietary approaches proven to reduce the risk of developing IBD.},

   abstract = {Salicylate intolerance is defined as a nonspecific antigen-induced pseudo-allergic hypersensitivity reaction which can occur upon contact of an organism with salicylic acid, its derivatives or other related organic or inorganic acids of similar chemical structure. Since the effects of nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drugs (NSAID) intolerance are by no means always severe or life-endangering but may just as well present as oligosymptomatic or local disorders (e.g. abdominal pain, diarrhea, we decided to evaluate the characteristics of patients with salicylate intolerance on the basis of gastroenterological case material of Medical Department I of Erlangen University. On the basis of the findings from the Erlangen interdisciplinary data register of chronic inflammatory gastrointestinal disease, the signs and symptoms of NSAID intolerance were found to constitute a diagnosis of great practical import to clinical medicine (allergology, dermatology, immunology, other disorders etc.) including gastroenterology. For approx. 2-7% of all patients with inflammatory bowel syndrome and food allergies this poses a new diagnostic and therapeutic challenge which may concern physicians from any of the disciplines involved. When presented with patients with chronic active disease who are suffering from these symptoms one should, therefore, in future give greater thought to the possibility of salicylate intolerance, all the more as there are meaningful dietetic, diagnostic and therapeutic options available for these persons.},

METHODS: Thirty-eight patients (20 males and 18 females, mean age 10.13 years, range 5-16 years) with CD in remission were randomized into two groups and treated for 12 mo. Group I (18 patients) received 5-ASA (50 mg/kg/d)+ omega-3 FAs as triglycerides in gastro-resistant capsules, 3 g/d (eicosapentanoic acid, EPA, 400 mg/g, docosahexaenoic acid, DHA, 200 mg/g). Group II (20 patients) received 5-ASA (50 mg/kg/d)+olive oil placebo capsules. Patients were evaluated for fatty acid incorporation in red blood cell membranes by gas chromatography at baseline 6 and 12 mo after the treatment. RESULTS: The number of patients who relapsed at 1 year was significantly lower in group I than in group II (P<0.001). Patients in group I had a significant increase in the incorporation of EPA and DHA (P<0.001) and a decrease in the presence of arachidonic acids. CONCLUSION: Enteric-coated omega-3 FAs in addition to treatment with 5-ASA are effective in maintaining remission of pediatric CD.},

   abstract = {To evaluate the role of dietary factors in the etiology of inflammatory bowel disease (IBD), we conducted a multicenter hospital-based case-control study in a Japanese population. Cases were IBD patients aged 15 to 34 years [ulcerative colitis (UC) 111 patients; Crohn's disease (CD) 128 patients] within 3 years after diagnosis in 13 hospitals. One control subject was recruited for each case who was matched for sex, age, and hospital. A semiquantitative food frequency questionnaire was used to estimate preillness intakes of food groups and nutrients. All the available control subjects (n = 219) were pooled, and unconditional logistic models were applied to calculate odds ratios (ORs). In the food groups, a higher consumption of sweets was positively associated with UC risk [OR for the highest versus lowest quartile, 2.86; 95% confidence interval (CI), 1.24 to 6.57], whereas the consumption of sugars and sweeteners (OR, 2.12; 95% CI, 1.08 to 4.17), sweets (OR, 2.83; 95% CI, 1.38 to 5.83), fats and oils (OR, 2.64; 95% CI, 1.29 to 5.39), and fish and shellfish (OR, 2.41; 95% CI, 1.18-4.89) were positively associated with CD risk. In respect to nutrients, the intake of vitamin C (OR, 0.45; 95% CI, 0.21 to 0.99) was negatively related to UC risk, while the intake of total fat (OR, 2.86; 95% CI, 1.39 to 5.90), monounsaturated fatty acids (OR, 2.49; 95% CI, 1.23 to 5.03) and polyunsaturated fatty acids (OR, 2.31; 95% CI, 1.12 to 4.79), vitamin E (OR, 3.23; 95% CI, 1.45 to 7.17), and n-3 (OR, 3.24; 95% CI, 1.52 to 6.88) and n-6 fatty acids (OR, 2.57; 95% CI, 1.24 to 5.32) was positively associated with CD risk. Although this study suffers from the shortcoming of recall bias, which is inherent in most retrospective studies (prospective studies are warranted to confirm the associations between diet and IBD risk), the present findings suggest the importance of dietary factors for IBD prevention.},

   abstract = {BACKGROUND: Crohn's disease is a chronic inflammatory disease of the intestine potentially affecting all parts of the intestine with predilection sites in the terminal ileum and proximal colon. Its prevalence in Western Europe is 20-40/100,000 with equal affection of both sexes and familiar accumulation. Histopathologically, it is characterized by a discontinuous, segmental manifestation and implication of all intestinal layers. Celiac disease, on the other hand, is defined by histologically proven villous atrophy associated with hyperplasia of crypts, lymphocytic infiltration and clinical improvement after a gluten-free diet. CASE REPORT: We report the case of a 52-year-old man presenting with long-term diarrhea and loss of weight associated with Crohn's disease. After interventional therapy for an unstable coronary artery syndrome and medical therapy for hyperthyroidism, the diarrhea stopped only after maintaining a gluten-free diet. A latent form of celiac disease (clinical symptoms, improvement after gluten-free diet, detection of anti-gliadin IgA antibodies, negative histology) was diagnosed. CONCLUSION: To our knowledge, this is the first report on the association of Crohn's disease and the latent form of celiac disease in the same patient. Whereas in most cases, Crohn's disease develops secondary to a pre-existing celiac disease, in our patient, latent celiac disease was diagnosed years after the onset of and therapy for Crohn's disease.},

   abstract = {BACKGROUND: A casein-based formula containing TGF-beta has been successfully used in adolescents during acute episodes of Crohn's disease. The role played by this molecule requires confirmation. We have examined the capacity of a TGF-beta containing diet to control the intestinal inflammation in HLA-B27 transgenic rats, and compared its effects with a similar diet devoid of TGF-beta. METHODS: Three groups of rats were studied. HLA-B27/hbeta2M transgenic rats were fed with a casein-based rat-adapted diet containing TGF-beta or a control casein-based diet without TGF-beta. Fischer control animals were fed the latter. Body weight, dietary intake, tissue weights, fecal samples, leukocyte counts, and acute phase response were analyzed. Intestinal inflammation was assessed by histology, myeloperoxidase, and mRNA expression of cytokines. MUC2 protein expression was assessed by immunohistochemistry. Breakdown of muscle protein was examined. RESULTS: The test diet improved diarrhea increasing the fecal dry matter and the colonic inflammation as shown by a lower inflammatory score (2.43 +/- 1.13 vs 4.42 +/- 0.53, p < .05), lower mucosal thickness (431.25 +/- 72.29 vs 508.57 +/- 81.32 microm, p = .08) and decreased IFNgamma mRNA expression. MUC2 protein expression was increased in HLA rats fed the TGF-beta diet compared with HLA rats fed the control diet, but restitution to normal pattern was not observed. The test diet also decreased leukocytosis and the acute phase response and improved the muscle catabolic response. CONCLUSION: The TGF-beta containing diet has a beneficial effect in an animal model of intestinal inflammation. Our observations support a potential role for dietary TGF-beta in the restoration of immune homeostasis.},

Ten to fifteen per cent of white adults in developed countries harbour gallstones. Frequency is further reduced in Black Americans, East Asia and sub-Saharan Africa. In developed countries, cholesterol gallstones predominate; 15% are black pigment. East Asians develop brown pigment stones in bile ducts, associated with biliary infection or parasites, or in intrahepatic ducts (hepatolithiasis). Certain risk factors for gallstones are immutable: female gender, increasing age and ethnicity/family (genetic traits). Others are modifiable: obesity, the metabolic syndrome, rapid weight loss, certain diseases (cirrhosis, Crohn's disease) and gallbladder stasis (from spinal cord injury or drugs like somatostatin). The only established dietary risk is a high caloric intake. Protective factors include diets containing fibre, vegetable protein, nuts, calcium, vitamin C, coffee and alcohol, plus physical activity.},

We analyzed the systemic and intestinal glutamine status in Crohn's disease (CD) and evaluated the therapeutic effect of glutamine supplementation in an animal model of ileitis. In CD, glutamine concentrations were decreased systemically and in noninflamed and inflamed ileal/colonic mucosa. Mucosal glutaminase activities were depressed in the ileum independent of inflammation but were not different from controls in the colon. In experimental ileitis, oral glutamine feeding prevented macroscopic inflammation, enhanced ileal and colonic glutaminase activities above controls, and normalized the intestinal glutathione redox status. However, glutamine supplementation enhanced myeloperoxidase activity along the gastrointestinal tract and potentiated lipid peroxidation in the colon. In conclusion, glutamine metabolism is impaired in CD. In experimental ileitis, glutamine supplementation prevents inflammatory tissue damage. In the colon, however, which does not use glutamine as its principal energy source, immune enhancement of inflammatory cells by glutamine increases oxidative tissue injury.},

   abstract = {BACKGROUND: Respiratory symptoms are over-represented in inflammatory bowel disease. There are similarities between the epidemiology of inflammatory bowel disease and that of respiratory conditions for which an adverse influence of salicylate has been identified. Natural salicylates exist within our diet. AIMS: To determine whether a lower intake of dietary salicylates is associated with less active inflammatory bowel disease and fewer concurrent respiratory symptoms. PATIENTS AND METHODS: Respiratory status, inflammatory bowel disease activity, quality of life, and dietary habits were established in 73 patients with Crohn's disease and 69 with ulcerative colitis, using a self-administered questionnaire and peak expiratory flow rate readings. Harvey-Bradshaw and Simple Birmingham/Royal Free Colitis indices, an internally validated respiratory score, and estimated weekly dietary salicylate intake, were calculated for each patient. RESULTS: There was at least one respiratory symptom in 63.4% of patients. The commonest underlying respiratory diagnosis was asthma. Respiratory impairment was similar in ulcerative colitis and Crohn's disease; 56.3% of Crohn's disease patients with an active respiratory diagnosis had other extra-intestinal manifestations. The dietary salicylate intake was independent of respiratory status, but inversely correlated with ulcerative colitis activity (dietary salicylate intake 37.0mg versus 21.4mg for low and higher Simple Birmingham/Royal Free Colitis index, respectively; p<0.02). A similar association was not seen in Crohn's disease. CONCLUSIONS: Respiratory impairment is common in inflammatory bowel disease. Higher intake of dietary salicylates is associated with less active colitis and possibly causally so.},

   abstract = {A physician's approach to patients with ulcerative colitis (UC) who are refractory to standard first-line therapies must be thoughtful and systematic and include the individual's physical and emotional state as the physician examines the various dietary, medical, and surgical options currently available. It is of foremost importance to confirm that the refractory patient's symptoms are not simply due to dietary indiscretion, concomitant bowel infection (especially with Clostridium difficile), an incorrect diagnosis (eg, colitis due to infection, NSAIDs, ischemia, diverticulitis, or Crohn's disease), or even a concomitant diagnosis (eg, celiac sprue, pancreatic insufficiency, functional bowel disorder, laxative or sorbitol intake). The ability to quickly assess the status of the colonic mucosa with flexible sigmoidoscopy aids in the ability to distinguish patients with refractory inflammation from those with other diagnoses. The initiation and optimization of the long-term purine analogues azathioprine (AZA) or 6-mercaptopurine (6-MP) remain the backbone of medical therapy for patients with refractory UC. For those unresponsive to corticosteroids, quicker induction of remission may necessitate infliximab, cyclosporine, or tacrolimus. Successful induction and maintenance with AZA, 6-MP, and/or infliximab should be followed by long-term therapy with these agents. Cessation of therapy often leads to relapse. Novel therapies under investigation hold the promise of offering more options for both the induction and maintenance of remission in refractory UC patients. Discussions of surgical intervention should not be put off as a last resort but rather included in the overall treatment plan offered to the patient.},

METHODS: A total of 78 CD patients and 80 healthy controls were evaluated in respect of nutritional status, dietary intake, and life styles factors. RESULTS: These 73/78 CD patients were on immunomodulating therapies. Mean body mass index (BMI) was lower in patients as compared to controls (P= 0.006) but 32% of CD patients and 33.8% of controls had a BMI > 25, whereas 8% and 23.8% in each group, respectively, were obese (BMI > 30Kg/m(2)). Fat free mass was significantly decreased in both genders (P < 0.05) whereas fat mass was decreased only in males (P= 0.01). Energy intake was significantly lower in CD patients (P < 0.0001) and we observed significantly lower adjusted mean daily intakes of carbohydrates, monounsaturated fat, fiber, calcium, and vitamins C, D, E, and K (P < 0.05). 29% of patients had excluded grains from their usual diet, 28% milk, 18% vegetables, and 11% fruits. Milk exclusion resulted in a significantly lower consumption of calcium and vitamin K (P < 0.001) and the exclusion of vegetables was associated to a lower consumption of vitamins C and E (P < 0.05). Physical activity was significantly lower in CD patients (P= 0.01) and this lack of physical activity was inversely correlated with increased fat mass percentage (r=-0.315, P= 0.001). CONCLUSIONS: Results showed that the most prevalent form of malnutrition in CD patients was an excess of body weight, which was concomitant with an inadequate dietary intake, namely micronutrients, clearly related to dietary exclusion of certain foods.},

The aim of this study was to identify foods causing intolerance and to determine the nature and severity of reported symptoms. Patients from the Dutch Crohn's and Ulcerative Colitis Association were mailed a survey on food intolerance; 105 (31% men) of 137 patients took part. They all reported intolerance to one or more foods. Common symptoms (scored from 0=absent to 10=severe), included diarrhea (mean score=5.8), fatigue (mean score=5.5), and thirst (mean score=4.6). Spicy foods, cabbage, and citrus fruits (or juice) were most likely to decrease stool consistency, increase stool frequency, or cause perianal irritation. Onions, cabbage, or leeks were reported by 28% of the patients to cause flatulence. The urge to defecate was stronger after a cooked meal (45% within (1/2) hour) than after sandwiches (15% within (1/2) hour). Foods reported to increase stool consistency were potato products, bread, and bananas. This study demonstrates that food intolerance is a common, albeit mild, problem after ileal pouch-anal anastomosis. Food and nutrition professionals should encourage patients to base their food choices on individual tolerance as long as no (patho-) physiological-based evidence to the contrary is available.},

We hypothesize that low dietary fat and amino acids used as the sole nitrogen source are the major contributors for the success of EDs. We examined the influences of the addition of dietary fat and protein to an ED using an indomethacin-induced inflammation model in rat small intestine. In the ED-fed rats, the intestinal damage score was decreased compared with that in the standard chow group with decreasing intestinal permeability. By supplementing an ED with soybean oil (SO), intestinal permeability was increased to a level similar to that of the standard chow group. For this group, the intestinal damage score also increased compared with that of the ED group but did not reach the levels observed in the standard chow group. The addition of dietary proteins (using heat-denatured pancreatin) resulted in intestinal damage scores that were significantly higher than those of the ED+SO-fed group. The dietary protein increased the intestinal damage score. These results suggest that EDs control inflammation by decreasing intestinal permeability and the elimination of dietary proteins.},

AIM: To evaluate the effectiveness of home enteral nutrition as a maintenance therapy regimen in which half of the daily calorie requirement is provided by an elemental diet and the remaining half by a free diet. We refer to this home enteral nutrition therapy as 'half elemental diet'. METHODS: Between 2002 and 2005, 51 patients in remission from two hospitals were randomly assigned to a half elemental diet group (n = 26) or a free diet group (n = 25). The primary outcome measure of this study was the occurrence of relapse over the 2-year period. RESULTS: The relapse rate in the half elemental diet group was significantly lower [34.6% vs. 64.0%; multivariate hazard ratio 0.40 (95% CI: 0.16-0.98)] than that in the free diet group after a mean follow-up of 11.9 months. Compliance was similar in the two groups. No adverse event occurred in any of the patients throughout the study. CONCLUSION: This randomized-controlled trial shows the effectiveness of an half elemental diet, which is a promising maintenance therapy for Crohn's disease patients.},

   abstract = {BACKGROUND: Infliximab and elemental diet (ED) have been shown to be effective in the management of Crohn's disease. However, few experiences have been reported regarding their combination therapy. The aim of the present study was to investigate the efficacy and safety of infliximab in Japanese patients, the first such study in Asia, as well as the effect of concomitant ED. METHODS: One hundred and ten consecutive patients receiving infliximab were followed up to week 16 after the last infusion, and clinical response and primary outcome were collected. A response was defined as a reduction in Harvey-Bradshaw Index for inflammatory disease and closure of fistula in fistulizing disease. RESULTS: Out of 75 inflammatory and 35 fistulizing disease patients, 68 (90.7%) and 25 (71.4%) responded at week 4, and 38 (50.7%) and 14 (40.0%) continued to respond until week 16, respectively. Interestingly, inflammatory disease patients with concurrent ED had a significantly higher response rate at week 16 (68.4%) than those without ED (32.4%, P = 0.0026). The effects of ED were independent of the usage of azathioprine and smoking habit. CONCLUSIONS: Infliximab was clinically useful in the treatment of Crohn's disease in Japanese patients as well as in those in Western countries. The efficacy of concurrent ED was suggestive and should be confirmed in a randomized controlled study.},

Thus, one of the increasingly accepted htypotheses to explain the origin of this disease, is the oxidative stress that occurs in the intestinal mucosa. Dietary factors including self administered vitamin and mineral supplements may play a role, especially when they contain excessive amounts of iron and copper, known for their prooxidant capacities. Unfortunately, little is known about how these metals may influence the antioxidant defenses in the intestinal mucosa. This article reviews the literature on the why and how these elements may act on individuals susceptible to develop Crohn disease, including the evidence supporting the hypothesis that oxidative stress in the intestinal mucosa is an important pathogenetic factor.},

   abstract = {Wireless capsule endoscopy is a diagnostic procedure to study the pathology of the small intestine physiologically and painlessly. The capsule dimensions are 11 x 26 mm, and takes 2 picture per second whilst 8 hours. Unexplained occult gastrointestinal tract bleeding is the main indication, but everyday new indications for its use come to the literature. Our objective were to review our experience about the clinical usefulness and impact in our clinic. We included 45 cases, excluding 3 because of technical problems. There were 24 women and 18 men, with an average age of 54 years old (18 to 86 years old). Indications for the study were: Gastrointestinal bleeding of obscure origin in 24 cases, anemia in 6 cases, chronic diarrhea in 8 cases, chronic abdominal pain in 2 cases and Crohn's disease in 2 cases. The source of bleeding in the first group was identified in 18 patients (75%), where jejunal and ileal angiodysplasias were found in 11 patients, in 4 cases there were ulcers or erosions, in one case a Meckel diverticulum was found and, in the last one an hammartomatous lesion with an active bleeding was found. In chronic diarrhea patients a lesion was found in 5 cases (62.5%), where mucosal atrophy were found in two patients who responded to a free gluten diet, and in 3 patients acute inflammations with ulcers were treated as Crohn's disease. In the patients with anemia a lesion was found in 2 cases (33%), where a submucosal tumor and a jejunal ulcer were the findings. No lesions were found in the patients with chronic abdominal pain. Finally in the patients with Crohn's disease we were able to know the extent and one patient presented two stenotic lesions. In conclusion, wireless capsule endoscopy is a useful diagnostic tool that let us study easily the small intestine and should be integrated to different study protocols as gastrointestinal bleeding of obscure origin, chronic diarrhea and evaluation of Crohn's disease. It is not useful for abdominal pain, nevertheless we just studied two patients.},

   abstract = {Crohn's disease is a chronic granulomatous inflammation of the gastrointestinal tract which was first described in the beginning of the 20th century. The histological similarity with intestinal tuberculosis has led to the assumption of an involvement of mycobacteria and mycobacterial antigens, respectively, in the etiology. A major defense mechanism against mycobacterial lipid antigens is the CD1 system which includes CD1 molecules for antigen presentation and natural killer T cells for recognition and subsequent production of cytokines like interferon-gamma and tumour necrosis factor-alpha. These cytokines promote granulomatous transformation. Various food additives, especially emulsifiants, thickeners, surface-finishing agents and contaminants like plasticizers share structural domains with mycobacterial lipids. It is therefore hypothesized, that these compounds are able to stimulate by molecular mimicry the CD1 system in the gastrointestinal mucosa and to trigger the pro-inflammatory cytokine cascade. The understanding of Crohn's disease as a CD1-mediated delayed-type hypersensitivity to certain food additives would lead to strong emphasis on a dietary treatment. Related aspects of pathology, physiology and epidemiology of Crohn's disease are presented.},

The responses of circulating immune cells and extra-intestinal manifestations to increased inflammatory activity and to modulation by dietary supplementation are uncertain. The relationships between disease status, bone turnover and body mass and composition, PBMC function and fatty acid availability have been investigated in patients with Crohn's disease. The availability of n-3 and n-6 PUFA is altered in adult patients and interferon (IFN)-gamma production by PBMC is lower. Increased inflammatory activity is associated with increased bone resorption in adult patients and decreased body mass in paediatric patients. In healthy male subjects there is a proportionate relationship between supplementary intake of EPA and DHA (0.3-2.0 g as fish oil/d) in combination with antioxidants (vitamins A, C and E and Se) and incorporation into plasma phospholipids and PBMC, and a non-linear relationship with PBMC synthesis of TNF-alpha, IL-6 and prostaglandin E2 (decrease) and IFN-gamma (increase). In adults with Crohn's disease high-dose fish oil (2.7 g EPA+DHA/d) in combination with antioxidants (vitamins A, C and E and Se) increases the EPA and DHA content of PBMC and decreases the production of IFN-gamma by PBMC, but is not associated with effects on bone turnover or nutritional status.},

High-dose fish oil is associated with reductions in disease relapse and inflammatory markers, and modulates PBMC function. The effect of fish oil plus antioxidants on bone turnover and PBMC function (the production of interferon-gamma and prostaglandin E2) in Crohn's disease was investigated in a randomised-controlled trial. Patients with currently or recently raised biochemical markers of inflammation (C-reactive protein > or = 6.9 mg/l or erythrocyte sedimentation rate > or =18 mm/h) received fish oil (providing 2.7 g/d EPA and DHA) and antioxidants (vitamins A, C and E, and Se) (n 31) or placebo (n 30) for 24 weeks. Bone turnover was assessed by measuring the concentrations of urinary deoxypyridinoline (bone resorption) and serum osteocalcin (bone formation). Fish oil plus antioxidants were associated with increases in EPA, DHA Se in plasma (all P < 0.01), and with a reduction in interferon-gamma production by mitogen-stimulated PBMC, which demonstrated a negative correlation with deoxypyridinoline/creatinine:osteocalcin ratio (r - 0.33, P = 0.009). There were no differences between the groups at 24 weeks in the response of deoxypyridinoline or osteocalcin or their ratio, or in nutritional status. Dietary supplementation in Crohn's disease with high intakes of EPA and DHA, as fish oil, plus antioxidants was associated with a modulated production of interferon-gamma by PBMC but not altered indices of bone turnover.},

She was first seen in October 2001, and initial assessment indicated that she was malnourished with fluid depletion, evidenced by the high volume of stomal fluid produced. There had been no sudden change in her medication, her Crohn's disease was quiescent and there was no evidence of any intra-abdominal sepsis. Despite a high calorific intake through her diet, she continued to lose weight. INVESTIGATIONS: Serum urea and electrolytes; magnesium; C-reactive protein; full blood count; urinary spot sodium; anthropometric measurements. DIAGNOSIS: High-output stoma with malabsorption as a consequence of repeated small-bowel surgery. MANAGEMENT: The patient was treated with oral hypotonic fluid restriction (0.5 l/day), 2 l of oral glucose-saline solution per day, high-dose oral antimotility agents (loperamide and codeine phosphate), a proton-pump inhibitor (omeprazole) and oral magnesium replacement. A year later, the patient's loop jejunostomy was closed and an end ileostomy fashioned, bringing an additional 35 cm of small bowel into continuity; macronutrient absorption improved but her problem of dehydration was only slightly reduced. She was stabilized on a twice-weekly subcutaneous magnesium and saline infusion and daily oral 1alpha-hydroxycholecalciferol.},

Our aim was to evaluate the prevalence of celiac disease in a consecutive series of patients affected by CD, in whom the disease was diagnosed for the first time. METHODS: From January to December 2004, we diagnosed 27 patients affected by CD (13 men and 14 women; mean age, 32.3 yrs; range, 16-69 yrs). In all patients, we performed antigliadin, antiendomysium, and antitransglutaminase antibody tests, and the sorbitol H2 breath test evaluation. In case of antibodies and/or sorbitol positivity, esophagogastroduodenoscopy was performed for a small bowel biopsy. RESULTS: Antigliadin, antiendomysium, and antitransglutaminase antibody tests were positive in 8/27 (29.63%), 4/27 (14.81%), and 5/27 (18.52%) patients, respectively, whereas the sorbitol H2 breath test was positive in 11/27 (40.74%) patients: all of them underwent esophagogastroduodenoscopy. Nine of 11 patients showed signs of duodenal endoscopic damage, and 5/9 (55.55%) showed histologic features of celiac disease (18.52% of overall CD population studied): 2 showed Marsh IIIc lesions (1 patient affected by ileal CD and 1 affected by ileo-colonic CD), 2 showed Marsh IIIb lesions (all of them affected by ileo-colonic CD), 1 showed a Marsh IIIa lesion (1 patient affected by colonic CD). CONCLUSIONS: Prevalence of celiac disease seems to be high among patients affected by CD, and this finding should be kept in mind at the time of the first diagnosis of CD; a gluten-free diet should be promptly started.},

   abstract = {OBJECTIVE: Undernutrition has been reported in 65-75% of patients with Crohn's disease. The present study aimed at identifying the relative contribution of malnutrition-causing factors in patients with Crohn's disease in remission. METHODS: Sixteen patients with Crohn's disease (age 19-57 y) in remission (Crohn's Activity Disease Index < 150) were included in the study. Their weight was stable for >3 mo and they were off steroids. They all completed 3-d food records and concomitantly collected stools. Self-reported food records were analyzed and energy content in stools was determined by a direct bomb calorimeter. Resting energy expenditure (REE) was studied by indirect calorimetry and body composition by dual-energy X-ray absorptiometry. The study cohort was divided into two groups, with a body mass index (BMI) equal to 18.5 kg/m(2) serving as a cutoff point. RESULTS: Subjects with lower BMIs tended to have less lean body mass (P = 0.006), less bone mineral density (P = 0.006), and lower REE (P = 0.003). No correlation was found between BMI and energy intake but the percentage of malabsorption was negatively correlated with BMI (P = 0.07). When dividing the study based on a BMI of 18.5 kg/m(2), no difference was found in caloric intake or REE between groups but subjects with lower BMIs had significant prominent malabsorption compared with the others (21.1 +/- 9.8% versus 11.7 +/- 3.5%, P = 0.015). CONCLUSION: In the presence of similar energy intake, REE does not seem to contribute to lower BMI, although nutrient malabsorption is higher in malnourished patients with Crohn's disease in remission. We suggest that malabsorption be evaluated in patients with Crohn's disease who fail to gain weight during disease remission to establish their extra caloric requirements.},

A 176-item questionnaire delved into first symptoms, childhood vaccinations and diseases, food items, potable water supplies, social activities, travel, pets, and home and surrounding environment. Questions were directed specifically for 2 time-frames, childhood until age 20 and a 10-year epoch before the onset of first symptoms within a family. The possible factors linked to disease were evaluated using univariate and multivariate logistic regression. RESULTS: There were significantly more smokers in the patients and their relatives than in controls. Patients had more appendicitis during adolescence, ate less oats, rye, and bran than controls, and consumed more unpasteurized cheese. Patients drank significantly less tap water and more well water than controls. Clustering of cases in time occurred in 13 of the 21 affected families. CONCLUSIONS: The less frequent consumption of oats, rye, and bran and the more frequent eating of unpasteurized cheeses imitate potential dietary influences on gastrointestinal flora. More importantly, our data suggest that the drinking of well water represents an important risk factor for CD.},

   abstract = {INTRODUCTION: Ulcerative colitis (UC) and Lesniowski-Crohn's disease together constitute a type of intestinal pathology known as Inflammatory Bowel Disease. The etiology of UC still remains unknown, however some epidemiological data suggest the role of bacteria and viruses and also some habitual as well as environmental factors like smoking, diet, drugs, geographical and social status, as well as stress. The genetic predisposition is also suggested. UC affects young people in 2nd - 4th decades of life. Exacerbations of the disease may result in the necessity of surgical treatment, typically in the form of total proctocolectomy accompanied by the subsequent formation of ileo-pouch-anal anastomosis. The aim of our study was to analyze morphological pictures of resected specimens. MATERIAL AND METHODS: We analyzed 67 cases (40 women and 27 men) of UC with the special interest being focused at macro- as well as microscopic features of the intestines resected. We reviewed macroscopic characteristics of intestines (i.e. the length of resected fragments, localization, shape and diameter of the ulcers, polyps, number of resected lymph nodes), as well as microscopic descriptions concerning, among others the character and localization of inflammatory infiltrate, the architecture of glands, the presence of crypt abscesses and Paneth's metaplasia. Special attention was paid to the morphology of intestinal wall vasculature. RESULTS: In 42% of the cases macroscopically the inflammation covered the whole length of the resected colon. In 58% macroscopically detected inflammatory changes were segmental in distribution. In four cases the disease had clinically the fulminant course and the inflammation was transmural. There were 3 cases, in which histological assessment revealed the presence of malignancy (2 cases of mucus producing adenocarcinoma and one case of carcinoma in situ situated in the anal canal). Generally, microscopic findings were typical for the active phase of UC. We found intensive vascularization and hyperemia of the intestinal wall to be the common features accompanying the inflammation. CONCLUSIONS: Young people in the 3rd and 4th decades of life constitute the group being relatively commonly affected by the UC, and undergo the surgical proctocolectomy. Some of the cases present with the fulminant course of the disease. A rich vascular network is a common finding in the inflamed intestinal wall. We hypothesize, that intensive vascularization may play a significant role in the pathogenesis of UC.},

The hypothesis developed from experiments on rodents that perinodal adipocytes are specialized to provision adjacent lymphoid tissues was tested by comparing the composition of triacylglycerol and phospholipid fatty acids in homologous samples of mesenteric adipose tissue and lymph nodes from patients with or without CD. METHODS: Mesenteric perinodal and other adipose tissue and lymph nodes were collected during elective surgery for CD and other conditions. Fatty acids were extracted, identified, and quantified by thin-layer and gas-liquid chromatography. RESULTS: Perinodal adipose tissue contained more unsaturated fatty acids than other adipose tissue in controls, as reported for other mammals, but site-specific differences were absent in CD. Lipids from adipose and lymphoid tissues had more saturated fatty acids but fewer polyunsaturates in patients with CD than controls. In adipose tissue samples, depletion of n-3 polyunsaturates was greatest, but n-6 polyunsaturates, particularly arachidonic acid, were preferentially reduced in lymphoid cells. Ratios of n-6/n-3 polyunsaturates were higher in adipose tissue but lower in lymphoid cells in patients with CD than in controls. CONCLUSIONS: Site-specific differences in fatty acid composition in normal human mesentery are consistent with local interactions between lymph node lymphoid cells and adjacent adipose tissue. These site-specific properties are absent in CD, causing anomalies in composition of lymphoid cell fatty acids, which may explain the efficacy of elemental diets containing oils rich in n-6 polyunsaturates.},

Although both patients followed a high-calorie diet combining solid foods and enteral nutrition by nasogastric tube, containing 16,000 kJ and 21,000 kJ, respectively, weight loss continued. Faecal fat excretion and basal metabolic rate were determined, but these could not explain the caloric deficit. Therefore, faecal bomb calorimetry, a measurement of total faecal energy content, was also performed, revealing a considerably higher faecal energy loss than had been calculated from faecal fat excretion; this indicates that faecal carbohydrate loss plays an important supplementary role. A stable weightwas achieved in both patients by prescribing extra food. Therefore, faecal fat excretion is an insufficient indicator of total faecal calorie loss in patients with high-output stomata and short-bowel syndrome. Bomb calorimetry may be considered as a tool to determine the remaining absorptive capacity in short-bowel patients.},

   abstract = {Crohn's disease (inflammatory bowel syndrome) is caused by gut exposure to harmful reactive oxygen species (ROS) derived from oxygen, such as the superoxide anion ((.)O(2)'), the hydroxyl radical ((.)OH) or the peroxide anion (O(2)''): the superoxide anion is generated by breakdown of oxygen-peroxidised phospholipids membranes. Crohn's disease predisposes to bowel cancer in susceptible human sub-populations. It may be preventable in these as yet unpredictable sub-populations by dietary-based intervention strategies, such as the daily consumption of appropriate quantities of soya isoflavones. These isoflavonoids are ROS-directed antioxidants, and they include the phytoestrogens, daidzin and genistin present in soya foods (consumed also in dietary supplements). Oxaliplatin is a platinum-containing Pt(II) organometallic therapeutic agent that binds to tumour DNA. Oxaliplatin may provide, therefore, a form of chemotherapy for some bowel cancers especially when administered in adjunct-chemotherapies that employ inhibitors of proliferation of the tumour cell. Such inhibitors include 5-fluorouracil, which prevents the correct replication of tumour cell DNA that is an essential prerequisite for bowel tumour growth. Furthermore, the therapeutic index for adjunct-chemotherapy with toxic inhibitors of DNA replication and expression could potentially be raised significantly by an associated dietary regime. This should include supplementation daily, per or, with antioxidant isoflavones (or other bioflavonoids) in selected cases of unresponsive cancer of the bowel, to possibly seek to trigger the pathway of apoptosis (programmed cell death) in the tumour cells preferentially.},

METHODS: Twenty-eight consecutive patients with active CD were treated with an elemental diet (Elental) for 4 weeks. The mucosal biopsies were obtained from the terminal ileum and large bowel before and after treatment. As a control group, mucosal biopsies were obtained from 20 patients without inflammation. Mucosal cytokine concentrations were measured by enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay. RESULTS: After treatment, clinical remission was achieved in 20 patients (71%). Endoscopic healing and improvement rates were 44% and 76% in the terminal ileum and 39% and 78% in the large bowel, respectively. Histologic healing and improvement rates were 19% and 54% in the terminal ileum and 20% and 55% in the large bowel, respectively. Before treatment, the mucosal concentrations of interleukin (IL)-1beta, IL-1 receptor antagonist (IL-1ra), IL-6, IL-8, and tumor necrosis factor-alpha in the ileum and large bowel were significantly higher than in controls. These cytokine concentrations decreased to the levels of control after treatment. IL-1ra/IL-1beta ratio in the ileum and large bowel was significantly lower than in controls before treatment. The ratio increased to the level of controls after treatment. The endoscopic and histologic healing of the mucosal inflammation was associated with a decline of the mucosal cytokines and an increase of the IL-1ra/IL-1beta ratio. CONCLUSIONS: The elemental diet (Elental) reduced mucosal cytokine production and corrected an imbalance between proinflammatory and anti-inflammatory cytokines in CD.},

A 28-year-old female developed acute duodenal Crohn's disease. Upper GI radiologic and endoscopic examinations showed a stricture in the duodenal bulb. Using the duodenal biopsy specimens, mucosal cytokine levels were measured; interleukin (IL)-1beta, IL-6, IL-8, and tumor necrosis factor-alpha levels were remarkably elevated. For initial 2 wk, powdered mesalazine was orally given but it was not effective. For the next 2 wk, she was treated with low-speed elemental diet therapy using a commercially available Elental(TM), which was infused continuously through a nasogastric tube using an infusion pump. The tip of the nasogastric tube was placed at an immediate oral side of the pylorus. The infusion speed was 10 mL/h (usual speed, 100 mL/h). After the 2-wk treatment, her symptoms were very much improved, and endoscopically, the duodenal stricture and inflammation improved. The duodenal mucosal cytokine levels remarkably decreased compared with those before the treatment. Although our experience was limited, low-speed elemental diet infusion through a nasogastric tube may be a useful treatment for acute duodenal Crohn's disease.},

METHODS: Thirty-two severely malnourished patients with Crohn's disease who had undergone surgery in our hospital were reviewed. Sixteen patients who received perioperative parenteral nutrition were enrolled in the study group, and the other 16 patients who did not receive parenteral nutrition were enrolled in the control group. Serum immunoglobulin, body mass index (BMI), liver function, weight change, and postoperative complications were evaluated. RESULTS: Serum IgM levels elevated 1 wk before surgery in both groups, and decreased to normal value (from 139+/-41 to 105+/-29 mg/dL, P = 0.04) 4 wk after operation in the study group, while no significant changes was noted in the control group (from 133+/-16 to 129+/-13 mg/dL, P = 0.34). There were no significant changes in concentrations of IgG and IgA. The BMI of the study group increased from 13.9+/-0.6 to 15.3+/-0.7 kg/m(2) (P = 0.02) with no significant change in the control group (14.1+/-0.7 and 14.5+/-0.5, respectively, P = 0.81). The percentage of resuming work was higher in the study group than in the control group. CONCLUSION: Perioperative parenteral nutrition possibly ameliorates the humoral immunity, reverses malnutrition, and facilitates rehabilitation.},

MATERIALS AND METHODS: A case-control study was conducted in the Department of Gastroenterology, Kaunas University of Medicine Hospital. A total of 101 patients with ulcerative colitis, 44 with Crohn's disease, and 178 healthy controls were examined with the help of standard self-report questionnaire about daily dietary habits. Healthy controls were evaluated in primary care centers during preventive examinations. Body mass index was calculated for all patients in a standard way. RESULTS: There was no statistically significant difference between patients and controls concerning consumption of coffee, tea, chewing gum, type of fat for meal preparation, white bread, cooked potatoes and sausages, non-carbonated water. Patients with inflammatory bowel diseases statistically significantly less frequently consumed fresh milk, cheese, fish, fried potatoes, and soda drinks. Patients with Crohn's disease statistically significantly less frequently consumed fresh fruits and patients with ulcerative colitis--fresh vegetables as compared to controls. Body mass index of patients with inflammatory bowel diseases was significantly lower compared to controls, and patients with Crohn's disease had significantly lower body mass index than ulcerative colitis patients. CONCLUSIONS: Patients with inflammatory bowel diseases have lower body mass index than healthy controls. Patients consume fresh milk, cheese, canned and fresh vegetables and fruits less frequently; therefore, primary care physicians and patients should be provided with teaching and more information about nutrition issues.},
