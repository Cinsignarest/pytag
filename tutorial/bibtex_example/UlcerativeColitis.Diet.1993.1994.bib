   abstract = {A multisite, hospital-based, case-control study examined the risk of ulcerative colitis in relation to dietary factors, smoking and drinking habits, past history of diseases, and childhood factors. Information was obtained from self-administered patient questionnaires. Study subjects included 101 ulcerative colitis patients who were 10-39 years old at the time of disease onset, which was within the previous 3 years, and 143 control subjects. Combined consumption of Western foods (bread for breakfast, butter, margarine, cheese, meats, and ham and sausage) was significantly related to an increased risk of ulcerative colitis (trend, p = 0.04). Margarine (as an individual Western food item) was positively associated with ulcerative colitis (trend, p = 0.005). There was also a tendency toward positive association of bread for breakfast with ulcerative colitis (trend, p = 0.07). The risk did not measurably vary with the consumption of typical Japanese foods, vegetables and fruits, confectioneries, or soft drinks. As compared with lifelong nonsmokers, current smokers tended to have a decreased risk of ulcerative colitis and former smokers had an increased risk. There was no association between breastfeeding in infancy and the risk of ulcerative colitis.},

   abstract = {BACKGROUND: The levels of antibodies against cow's milk proteins in ulcerative colitis (UC) were used to study whether mucosal inflammation leads to immune recognition, as a marker of enhanced permeability, of dietary proteins. A further purpose was to study the effect of proctocolectomy on the serum antibody levels against cow's milk proteins and their relation to biochemical and histologic liver abnormalities associated with ulcerative colitis. METHODS: Serum antibody levels against six cow's milk proteins, alpha-casein, alpha-lactalbumin (LA), beta-lactoglobulin A (LGA), beta-lactoglobulin B (LGB), bovine serum albumin (BSA), and whole milk powder (MP) were determined before and after (mean, 24 months) proctocolectomy in 15 patients with ulcerative colitis. Simultaneously, serum liver enzymes were analyzed. A liver biopsy specimen was also obtained at proctocolectomy. RESULTS: Before proctocolectomy IgA antibody levels were significantly increased against all antigens except BSA. Increased levels of IgM antibodies against LGA, LGB, and BSA were also detected. IgG antibodies were significantly increased only against LGA. After proctocolectomy IgA and IgM antibody levels decreased significantly (p < 0.05) against LGA, LGB, and LA, whereas IgG antibodies increased significantly (p < 0.01). In the patient group with abnormal liver histology (n = 9) the IgA antibodies to all cow's milk proteins were significantly higher (p < 0.02) than in the group with normal liver histology both before and after proctocolectomy. The IgA antibody levels showed a significant positive correlation with alanine amino-transferase and gamma-glutamyltransferase (r value from 0.460 to 0.721, p value from < 0.05 to < 0.01), but not with alkaline phosphatase. CONCLUSIONS: These results suggest that the inflamed mucosa in UC allows the antigenic contents of the bowel to escape. Proctocolectomy alters the antibody levels against certain milk proteins, which may serve as a model to suggest that proctocolectomy, probably by eliminating inflammation, may have positive effects by reducing the foreign pathogenic antigen and immune complex load.},

A classification for reporting small bowel Crohn's disease is proposed, where the disease is staged as early, advanced or complicated, and the extent of involvement measured directly from the film. The terminal ileum may be normal in 20% of children with proximal Crohn's disease, so that ileoscopy should not be used to exclude small bowel disease. Radiological assessment of the small bowel is important in management. Surgical referral was based on the radiological changes in 6% of patients, and in 24% the presence of extensive uncomplicated small bowel Crohn's disease led to treatment with elemental diet. The use of some specialized examinations, such as the instant and ileostomy enema, are discussed.},

In most patients, the ileal pouch-anal anastomosis is performed in two stages.

Stage two ET nursing interventions focus on perianal skin care, use of medications, sphincter reeducation, and prompt recognition of complications. Written instructions offer the best method of providing crucial information succinctly. Patients require significant physical and emotional support throughout the potentially complex, long-term course until an optimal steady state is achieved.},

   abstract = {OBJECTIVES: There has been concern in the literature and among physicians and patients that milk intolerance may contribute to disease activity in ulcerative colitis. We sought to define whether patients with ulcerative colitis have problems with milk tolerance. METHODS: 1) A questionnaire was administered to a group of gastroenterologists. 2) Consecutive unselected ulcerative colitis patients were administered a questionnaire regarding issues concerning their ingestion and tolerance of milk products. 3) Patients, and age- and ethnically matched controls, underwent lactose hydrogen breath testing at a 50-g dose, and if intolerant, returned for testing at a 12.5-g dose. RESULTS: Eighty percent of responding physicians stated that they recommend avoidance of milk products at some time to their patients. Thirteen of 29 (44%) ulcerative colitis patients were lactose intolerant compared with five of 14 (36%) controls (p = 0.57). Of 11 subjects returning for the 12.5-g test dose, only three (28%) were intolerant. Of 10 ulcerative colitis patients tested during a flare, only two (20%) were intolerant. Nineteen of 28 (66%) patients reduced or eliminated milk products from their diet, but only 10 (45%) of these patients were lactose intolerant. The discordance rate for predicting lactose tolerance status among patients was 35%. By logistic regression analysis, age (p = 0.04) and ethnicity (p = 0.006) were the only variables that were predictive of an abnormal lactose hydrogen breath test. CONCLUSIONS: There are common misperceptions among physicians and patients about lactose intolerance in ulcerative colitis. Lactose intolerance in patients with ulcerative colitis is dependent on their age and ethnicity and not any particular aspects of their disease. The proscription of milk products during flares of disease by many physicians is not supported by this study.},

This illness profoundly impairs the patient's professional life, family life, sex life, leading to an overall change in lifestyle, most particularly in cases of pancolitis. The majority of patients who benefit from a total colectomy for their ulcerative colitis, are those whose cases are severe, chronic, incapacitating, and who respond poorly to prolonged, appropriately administered medical treatment, mainly continuous steroid therapy. After the surgical procedure, the average number of defecations is from 5 to 6 evacuations in 24 hours, and the anal continence is good. Around 5% of patients have nocturnal leakage requiring to wear a protecting fad. Globally 9 out 10 patients are satisfied with their surgery and ileal pouch-anal anastomosis is the procedure of choice for the treatment of ulcerative colitis in subjects under 60 years of age, with a normal anal sphincter function and without neoplastic complication of the lower rectum.},

The knowledge about the interference between disease and pregnancy influences the management of pregnancy and delivery as well as of the disease itself. Intensive care, including genetic counseling, dietary management, and drug therapy ought to start even before pregnancy. In the care of the pregnant patient with Crohn's disease or ulcerative colitis corticosteroids and sulphasalazine may be used just as in the nonpregnant patient. An increased activity of the disease in the beginning of pregnancy causes high rates of prematurity, spontaneous abortions, and stillbirths. Frequency of defects in embryonic development varies between 0 and 4% and is even higher in severe cases of Crohn's disease. Prophylactic drug administration in pregnancy is not suitable to decrease the risk of exacerbation. Several studies revealed that the risk of exacerbation is not increased during pregnancy. Low activity in the onset of pregnancy is continued in 61%. Higher rates of abdominal and vaginal operative deliveries (26% in Crohn's disease) seems to be associated with active intervention on the base of activity indices.},

   abstract = {Circumstantial evidence indicates that immunological mechanisms are important in the pathogenesis of inflammatory bowel diseases. In Crohn's disease lesions the naive T cells are reduced and memory T cells are increased in number. Colonocytes of normal mucosa do not express MHC class II molecules but aberrant HLA-DR expression is induced in inflammatory conditions. Also in ileal epithelial cells there is increased MHC class II molecules expression suggesting augmented antigen presentation. Once the initiating event (environmental, dietary, infectious or enterobacterial products) has activated inflammatory cells, an auto-amplifying inflammatory immune cascade is induced by numerous agents such as cytokines, transforming growth factors, leukotrienes, prostaglandins and other mediators. Tissue injury may be caused by oxygen free radicals generated by neutrophils and macrophages. The inflammatory process can be perpetuated by a persistent antigenic stimulus or alternatively, by abnormal regulation of immune and inflammatory responses. This can mean exaggerated activation of inflammatory responses to "normal" stimuli or defective feedback mechanisms of down-regulation. The early lesions of inflammatory bowel disease are patchy necrosis of the surface epithelium, focal accumulations of leukocytes adjacent to crypts and an increased number of intraepithelial lymphocytes. In Crohn's disease the earliest lesions are aphthoid ulcers overlying lymphoid follicles in the terminal ileum. In patients with spondylarthropathy and asymptomatic intestinal inflammation we demonstrated lesions in the top of the follicle associated epithelium. The changes consist of increase in number of membranous (M) epithelial cells, ruptures, fissures and perforations of M cells. Aphthoid ulcers that may occur in the entire gastrointestinal tract are typically found at the M cell level.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS)},

A system of structured analysis is suggested, with separate consideration of destructive ulceration, inflammatory activity and other factors. Direct investigation of gut immunity by using whole gut lavage fluid (WGLF) is a valuable new technique of clinical investigation in IBD and related disorders. Recent studies have shown that the concentrations of plasma-derived proteins in WGLF provide objective measures of disease activity; and that this activity is a separate phenomenon from destructive ulceration and fibrosis. Neutrophils in the lumen can be in- investigated by cytology, or by assay of neutrophil elastase in WGLF. Cytokines and other immuno-regulatory mediators can also be detected. These new techniques can provide a description of intestinal immunity and inflammation, based on a non-invasive test of 2-4 h duration. Work in progress shows that patients who respond clinically to elemental diet treatment have unusually high concentrations of soluble IL2 receptor in WGLF; cytokine profiles may facilitate the selection of patients suitable for other new treatment modalities.},

On the last 2 d an antibiotic was given that suppressed microbial activity in the digesta and slightly reduced ileostomy outflow. Mean daily amino acid excretion in ileostomy fluid ranged from 32 mg/d for methionine to approximately 330 mg/d for aspartate and glutamate. These losses were compared with current international estimates of amino acid requirements.

   abstract = {N-3 fatty acids were supplied to a 36-year-old female patient suffering from ulcerative colitis and severe steroid side-effects, in a sequence of parenteral and enteral administration. During a moderately active period of disease, 200 ml d-1 fish oil-derived lipid emulsion (eicosapentaenoic acid [EPA], 4.2 g; docosahexaenoic acid [DHA], 4.2 g) was infused for 9 days, in parallel with rapid tapering of the steroid dose. Disease activity declined rapidly, and the patient was subsequently provided with 16 fish oil capsules per day (EPA, 2.9 g; DHA, 1.9 g) for 2 months. At the end of this period of therapy, severe colitis recurred with intestinal and extraintestinal manifestations. The n-3 lipid emulsion was then used for intravenous alimentation (29 days, maximum dose 300 ml per day); during this time, marked improvement of the inflammatory bowel disease was noted. During both periods of parenteral n-3 lipid administration, total plasma EPA and DHA contents increased several-fold, surpassing that of arachidonic acid; this plasma n-3 fatty acid enrichment was only maintained to a minor extent during the intermediate period of dietary fish oil supplementation. The intravenously administered EPA-containing triglycerides were rapidly hydrolyzed, as evidenced by the appearance of substantial quantities of EPA in the plasma free fatty acid fraction. Platelet and neutrophil total membrane content of EPA and DHA as well as n-3 fatty acid/AA membrane ratios similarly increased during the periods of intravenous n-3 lipid administration and declined during oral fish oil uptake.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS)},

The compound was administered in the diet for 119 weeks (rats) and 120 weeks (mice) at dose levels of 100, 300 and 900/1800 mg/kg b.w./d for mice and of 300, 900 and 2700/1800 mg/kg b.w./d for rats. The administration of benzalazine produced no effects on survival, appearance or behaviour. Body weights of the high-dosed male mice and rats (both sexes) were occasionally significantly decreased when compared to the controls. A slight but in most cases statistically significant reduction of the relative food consumption of the female mice of all treated groups was observed between test weeks 6 and 12. In the high-dosed rats a statistically significant increase of the relative food consumption was found between test weeks 17 and 109. At necropsy, there was no evidence of treatment-related changes, nor were these seen on histopathological examination. All microscopic changes seen in mice and rats were of the usual type commonly occurring in untreated aged NMRI mice and Sprague-Dawley rats. However, an increased incidence of thyroid cystic hyperplasia was found in the rats of the high dose-level group. In addition, an increased incidence of thyroid adenomas was found in the male rats of the high-dosed group only as compared to the control groups. This increased tumour incidence is regarded as a marginal finding and may be of a spontaneous nature within the normal range of the background data. However, a substance-related influence cannot completely be excluded. In conclusion, the administration of benzalazine for more than 24 months to NMRI mice and Sprague-Dawley rats produced only slight effects on body weight in the high-dosed male mice and in rats (both sexes) with a no-effect level of 300 mg/kg b.w./d in the diet for mice or 900 mg/kg b.w./d in the diet for rats. There was no evidence of an oncogenic effect of benzalazine.},

Interleukin-8 levels were compared with plasma interleukin-6 (IL-6) levels in 80 of these patients. Interleukin-8 levels were also measured in ten patients with active Crohn's disease, before and after treatment with a defined formula polymeric diet. Of these patients, 70 out of 93 IL-8 concentrations were below the detection limit of the assay. Levels were higher in patients with active ulcerative colitis (median < 20 pg/mL, 75th centile value = 190) compared with inactive disease (median and 75th centile value < 20; P < 0.05). Interleukin-8 concentrations correlated with a combined score for disease severity and extent (P = 0.01). Thirty-eight per cent (8/20) of patients with active Crohn's disease also had high levels of IL-8 but there was no significant difference between active and inactive disease. There was no correlation between serum IL-8 and plasma IL-6; on the contrary, very few patients had raised blood levels of both cytokines. In the diet treated group, serum IL-8 fell significantly after treatment (median = 37 pg/mL, range < 20-4615 before treatment, median < 20, range < 20-104 after treatment; P = 0.03). The results suggest that although IL-8 may be involved in the inflammatory process in inflammatory bowel disease, it is a poor marker of disease activity.},

   abstract = {Patients with extensive ulcerative colitis have a high risk of developing colon cancer. The etiology of mucosal dysplasia, a premalignant lesion that is used as a screening test in surveillance programs, is unknown. Previously, a case-control study [Lashner et al. (1989) Gastroenterology 97:255-259] suggested that folate supplementation was associated with a 62% reduction in the risk of developing dysplasia or cancer. The current case-control study was performed to obtain a better definition of this risk. All 67 patients with chronic ulcerative pancolitis having surveillance colonoscopy during a 1-year period were entered. There were 6 cases (4 with dysplasia and 2 with cancer) and 61 controls (no cancer or dysplasia). Red blood cell folate, reflecting intermediate-term stores, was a mean of 66.2 ng/ml lower in cases compared to controls. Serum folate, reflecting short-term stores, was not different between groups. Adjusting for confounding effects of age, sex, race, disease duration, and folate supplementation, the risk of dysplasia or cancer was significantly decreased by 18% for each 10 ng/ml increase in red blood cell folate (odds ratio 0.82, 95% confidence interval 0.68-0.99). Vitamins A, D, and E and carotene were lower in cases than in controls, but no water-soluble vitamin other than red blood cell folate was associated with an increased cancer risk. Depressed red blood cell folate is associated with an increased risk of dysplasia and cancer in patients with ulcerative colitis and may be a risk factor for neoplastic transformation.},

Preserving normal intestinal pattern, the goal of IPAA is to improve quality of life for patients. This study was designed to measure the impact of IPAA on quality of life in a series of 35 surgically treated UC. Four fields of quality of life were explored: diet, professional activity, sport practice, sexual activity. Interview with independent observer and prospective follow-up allowed to establish a score from 0 (excellent quality of life) to 19 (bad quality of life). In the same time, functional score evaluating pouch evacuation and continence was established (0 = excellent function, 30 = bad function) to be compared to quality of life. The series included 35 IPAA in function for more than 6 months (mean follow-up = 46 +/- 31 months), performed for UC (14 females and 21 males, mean age: 34 y-a). Respectively 30 (86%) and 5 (14%) of the patients had an excellent and fair quality of life, according to the scoring system: 25 had no diet, all but one had a normal professional activity and all were satisfied of sport practice; 33 had no sexual disturbances related to IPAA, but 3 female patients complained of infertility. Functional results were excellent, fair and bad respectively in 25 (72%), 9 (26%) and 1 patients: stool frequency was 4.6 +/- 2 per day, 60% of patients having no nocturnal emission, and 90% being able to delay for more than 1 hour.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS)},

   abstract = {The mechanisms of nutritional therapy in inflammatory bowel disease have not been thoroughly established. It is likely that a further understanding of the underlying disease process will allow better understanding of these forms of therapy, with a sounder rationale for the construction of specific diet constituents for therapy. Regardless, nutritional therapy is likely to be multidimensional, and various forms may affect different aspects of the disease process. Decreased inflammatory factors, decreased antigenic stimuli, provision of essential nutrients, improved immune function, and other factors may all be of varying importance in different patients with inflammatory bowel disease. Little work has been done on the role of diet therapy in the long-term treatment of patients with inflammatory bowel disease as a method of preventing relapse. Parenteral nutrition and elemental diets appear to have limited roles in this area. Some investigation has been done to see if minor modifications of the normal diet can prolong remission periods. Low-fiber diets are frequently recommended for patients with strictures. Whether this has any significant effect on symptoms, inflammation, or complications is unclear. Heaton et al suggested that a high-fiber, unrefined carbohydrate diet resulted in fewer and shorter hospitalizations. In a prospective follow-up study by Ritchie et al, however, these results were not able to be reproduced. Exclusion diets have also been suggested as a means of reducing relapse rates in patients with Crohn's disease. In a small, randomized, controlled trial of an exclusion diet versus an unrefined carbohydrate, fiber-rich diet, there were significantly fewer relapses among the patients treated with the exclusion diet at 6 months. These diets require intensive patient cooperation, but the potential side effects are minimal. Clearly, these findings need to be reproduced in large, prospective, randomized, controlled studies before widespread use can be advocated. A great deal of data exists on the use of nutritional supplementation in the treatment of inflammatory bowel disease, although little of it is in the form of large, randomized, controlled studies. Nutritional manipulation currently has a limited role in patients with ulcerative colitis; a much broader role exists in patients with Crohn's disease. The mechanisms by which nutritional therapy affects these diseases may include a combination of factors--decreased antigenic exposure, improved immune function, and provision of essential nutrients and calories needed for bowel regeneration.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 400 WORDS)},

   abstract = {Colorectal cancer affect the 15% of general population in developed countries. Cancer is a multistep process in which multiple genetic alterations must usually occur in several years. The premalignant step consists of one or multiple aberrant crypts due to hyperproliferation of cells and its shift from the deep third of the crypt to its surface. It has been suggested that abnormality in the APC gene is responsible for this. Furthermore, there exists DNA hypometilation, activation of the gene K-ras and ornithine decarboxylase activity. There is also a loss of MCC gene, that seems to interact with the APC gene. Entire alterations described make possible the Class I adenoma formation. This adenoma, needs the loss of the DCC gene (late stage in the carcinogenesis process), to become a Class II adenoma. The following alteration is deleted and mutation of the p53 gene. There is also an activation of the c-myc oncogene. These two genes are important mechanisms for the conversion of a benign adenoma to a malignant one, adenoma with in situ carcinoma or Class III adenoma. This type of adenoma becomes carcinoma and metastatic stage, throughout inactivation of several tumor suppressor genes. Besides the hereditary APC alteration and other acquired genetic changes as described above there are other associated genetics, antigenics, and enzymes that have an important role in the adenoma-carcinoma sequence. Several carcinogenic factors have been described which also contribute in the adenoma and carcinoma formation: ulcerative colitis, acromegaly, familial history of colonic neoplasia, certain professions, smoking and drinking, consumption of red or processed meat, etc.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS)},

   abstract = {Abnormal intestinal crypt cell proliferation is considered to be an important early risk marker for colorectal cancer but measurement of the rate and spatial distribution of cell division by histochemical localization of DNA synthesis is labour-intensive and expensive. We developed and evaluated a simpler technique for measurement of these parameters using direct visual analysis of mitotic figures in microdissected crypts. The direct crypt analysis technique was applied to colorectal biopsies from patients with ulcerative colitis or no mucosal abnormality. A characteristic shift of cell division toward the intestinal lumen was detected in patients with ulcerative colitis. The direct method was validated using rats fed diets containing cellulose, or guar gum to stimulate mucosal cell proliferation. The crypt cell proliferation rate (CCPR) was measured by the metaphase-arrest technique and the results were compared with direct crypt analysis. There was a fivefold range of CCPR values at three sampling sites across the dietary groups. An excellent linear correlation between the results by the two techniques was obtained (r = 0.98; P < 0.001). In a second experiment the spatial distribution of dividing cells between five zones in colonic crypts, determined by the new method or by staining with BrdU, was compared. Good agreement was again achieved. Visual analysis of intact crypts is a valid technique for the measurement of crypt cell cytokinetics and it is particularly suited for use in a clinical environment.},

   abstract = {BACKGROUND/AIMS: The TF antigen (galactose-beta 1,3-N-acetylgalactosamine alpha) is overexpressed in malignant and premalignant colonic epithelium. Previous studies have shown that peanut lectin (PNA), which binds TF, is mitogenic for normal human colonic epithelium. This study aimed to determine its effect on abnormal colonic epithelium. METHODS: Crypt cell proliferation rate (CCPR) was measured using vincristine arrest and mucus synthesis by incorporation of radiolabeled N-acetyl glucosamine in colonoscopic biopsy specimens cultured with and without PNA. RESULTS: Unstimulated CCPR was greater in patients with ulcerative colitis than in patients with histologically normal colon. PNA (25 micrograms/mL) produced a 25% average increase in CCPR in tissues from patients with ulcerative colitis, Crohn's disease, and colonic polyps. In ulcerative colitic biopsy specimens incubated with PNA, CCPR increased to more than double that of unstimulated normal colonic epithelium. In controls, the response to PNA was greater when adjacent specimens were positive for PNA (avidin-biotin) histochemistry than when they were negative. Mucus synthesis was increased by an average 75% over 24 hours by PNA. CONCLUSIONS: Increased TF expression by premalignant epithelia may allow stimulation of proliferation by dietary galactose N-acetylgalactosamine-binding lectins. If the hyperplasia-dysplasia cancer hypothesis is correct, this could explain the increased colon cancer risk in ulcerative colitis.},

   abstract = {In the irritable bowel syndrome gastrointestinal tract motility is disturbed from the esophagus to the colon, causing pain and altered function. When colonic motility is abnormal, the patient can experience either constipation or diarrhea in addition to abdominal pain and bloating. In constipated patients the postprandial colonic motility can increase normally after eating or the colon can remain motionless. Generally propagating contractions are absent in patients with constipation predominant irritable bowel syndrome. Propagating contractions are increased in frequency in patients with diarrhea, although the phasic contractions are decreased. Questionnaires discriminate between patients with structural disease such as ulcerative colitis and patients with functional disease, however they cannot differentiate between the different subgroups of patients with constipation predominant irritable bowel syndrome. Treatment strategies are beginning to focus on the underlying pathophysiologic abnormality.},

   abstract = {Colonic SCFA formation from fermentable carbohydrate is important for the maintenance of morphologic and functional integrity of the colonic epithelium. Carbohydrate-induced diarrhea occurs when the amount of carbohydrate entering the colon exceeds its fermentation capacity. Deficient availability or utilization of SCFA, mainly of n-butyrate, is the cause of diversion colitis and may play important roles in colonic carcinogenesis, in starvation and enterotoxigenic diarrhea, and in idiopathic UC.},

   abstract = {Disturbances in zinc metabolism have been documented in patients with inflammatory bowel disease. In this study we evaluated the effect of in vivo treatment with zinc on the in vitro natural killer cell activity in thirteen inflammatory bowel disease patients, with stable disease and mild-moderate disease activity, in a double-blind randomized cross-over trial. The results of our study show a long-lasting effect of in vivo zinc administration, which decreased peripheral blood natural killer cell activity in inflammatory bowel disease.},
