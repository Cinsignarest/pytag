   abstract = {The etiology of ulcerative colitis is essentially unknown. A hospital-based case-control study examined the risk of ulcerative colitis in relation to dietary and other factors. Recruited at 20 hospitals across the nation were 101 ulcerative colitis patients who were 10-39 years old at the time of disease onset and whose disease had been diagnosed within the past 3 years. One hundred and forty-three control subjects were also examined. Information on factors was obtained by using a self-administered questionnaire. Combined consumption of western foods (bread for breakfast, butter, margarine, cheese, meats, and ham/ sausage) was significantly related to an increased risk of ulcerative colitis (trend P = 0.04). Of the six food items of the western food group, margarine was positively and significantly associated with ulcerative colitis (trend P = 0.005), and bread for breakfast tended to be positively associated with the risk (trend P = 0.07). No appreciable association was found for the consumption of Japanese foods, vegetables and fruits, confectionery, or soft drinks. Compared with lifelong nonsmokers, current smokers had a decreased risk, and former smokers had an increased risk. This study confirmed a protective association between smoking and ulcerative colitis, and suggested that margarine or chemically modified fat may play an etiological role in the development of ulcerative colitis.},

DESIGN: The study was performed as a cross-over design. SETTING: The subjects were studied as outpatients except on the sampling days when all subjects were admitted to the research ward and stayed in a nearby patient hotel overnight. SUBJECTS: Six men and two women, all proctocolectomised for ulcerative colitis, volunteered to participate in the study. INTERVENTIONS: During each dietary period of 3 weeks, food and excreta were collected and analysed on days 3, 17 and 18. RESULTS: The excretion of crude protein and amino acids (free and bound) was generally higher during the high-fibre diet period, although the relative proportion of amino acids was similar in the ileal effluents from the two diets. The apparent digestibilities of crude protein and all amino acids except histidine, tyrosine and proline were significantly (P < 0.05) lower during the high-fibre diet period. CONCLUSION: It was indicated that the effect of the high-fibre rye-based diet was a generally impaired ileal amino acid absorption.},

DESIGN: The study was performed as a cross-over design. SETTING: The subjects were studied as outpatients except on the sampling days when all subjects were admitted to the research ward and stayed in a nearby patient hotel overnight. SUBJECTS: Seven men and three women, all proctocolectomised for ulcerative colitis, volunteered to participate in the study. One female subject was withdrawn from the study because of inflammation of the ileal stoma. INTERVENTIONS: During each dietary period of 3 weeks, food and excreta were collected and analysed on days 3 and 17. RESULTS: No significant differences in excretion of crude protein or amino acids (free and bound) were found between the two sampling days. Intake as well as excretion of all analysed amino acids was higher during the high-fibre diet period, although the relative proportion of amino acids was comparable in the two diets and their corresponding ileal effluents. Aspartic acid, glycine, threonine, alanine and serine were found in considerably higher relative proportions in the effluents from the subjects when they consumed each of the two diets than their concentrations in the diets. The apparent digestibilities were significantly (P < 0.05) lower for all analysed amino acids during the high-fibre diet period. Aspartic acid (10.7%), alanine (9.9%) and glycine (8.5%) showed a more pronounced decrease than the mean decrease in amino acid digestibility (6.6%) when subjects consumed the high-fibre diet. CONCLUSION: Intake of the oat bran high-fibre diet resulted in significantly lower amino acid and crude protein digestibility. The relative amino acid proportions in the diets and their corresponding excretas were, however, comparable for the two diets.},

   abstract = {The relationship between physical activity and risk of symptomatic diverticular disease has not been investigated directly. This association was examined in a prospective cohort of 47,678 American men, 40 to 75 years of age, and free of diagnosed diverticular disease, colon or rectal polyp, ulcerative colitis, and cancer before 1988. During four years of follow up, 382 newly diagnosed cases of symptomatic diverticular disease were documented. After adjustment for age, energy adjusted dietary fibre, and energy adjusted total fat, overall physical activity was inversely associated with the risk of symptomatic diverticular disease (for highest versus lowest extremes, relative risk (RR) = 0.63 (95% confidence interval (CI) 0.45, 0.88). Most of the inverse association was attributable to vigorous activity, for extreme categories RR = 0.60 (95% CI 0.41, 0.87). For activity that was not vigorous the RR was 0.93 (95% CI 0.67, 1.69). Several specific activities were inversely associated with the risk of diverticular disease, but jogging and running combined was the only individual activity that was statistically significant (p for trend = 0.03). For men in the lowest quintile for dietary fibre intake and total physical activity (compared with those in the opposite extreme), the RR was 2.56 (95% CI 1.36, 4.82). Physical activity, along with a high fibre diet, may be an important factor in the prevention of symptomatic diverticular disease.},

A case-control study that excluded secondary cases and patients with PFGE II and III patterns (n = 16) demonstrated that consumption of food from one supermarket was associated with illness (15/16 cases vs. 31/47 geographically matched controls, odds ratio [OR] undefined, lower 95% confidence interval OR = 1.45, P = .018). No one food was associated with illness. Inspection of the supermarket revealed deficiencies in hygiene and meat handling practices. The 2 cases with PFGE II ate raw beef and raw lamb from a second supermarket. These outbreaks demonstrate the value of PFGE in supporting epidemiologic investigations and the potential for outbreaks arising from retail outlets.},

   abstract = {Debate exists about the role of diet in both the aetiology and the management of ulcerative colitis. To examine the latter, a group of patients with documented ulcerative colitis was studied at the Groote Schuur Hospital Gastro-intestinal Clinic. A total of 18 subjects, 9 female and 9 male, were randomised into active or control groups and followed up weekly for 6 weeks. Subjects in the control group were asked to document but not alter their intake of food and drink. Those in the experimental group had their diets systematically manipulated to exclude foods that appeared to provoke symptoms. The symptoms, sigmoidoscopy and biopsy findings of all subjects were compared before and after. 'Remission' was defined as the passage of normal stools with absence of rectal bleeding. 'Improvement' was defined as a decrease in the number of diarrhoeal stools and/or a diminution of rectal bleeding. At the end of the trial the diet group displayed significantly fewer symptoms than did the controls (P = 0.009; Fisher's exact test). Sigmoidoscopic findings improved in 8 subjects in the diet group compared with 2 of the controls. Histological findings improved in 3 of the diet group as well as in 3 of the controls. There were no foods that provoked symptoms in all patients, though spiced and curried foods and fruits, especially grapes, melon and the citruses, commonly caused diarrhoea. In only 2 patients were symptoms reproduced consistently on reintroduction of a particular food, pork in 1 case and yellow cheese in another.},

   abstract = {5-Aminosalicylic acid-O-sulfate (5-ASA sulfate), a new agent for the treatment of ulcerative colitis and Crohn's disease of the large intestine, was investigated for its pharmacokinetic and toxicological properties, following local and systemic application. 5-ASA sulfate can be considered as a non-toxic agent after single oral intake in rats (14-day LD50 > 6000 mg/kg b.w.). Oral application of 2500 mg 5-ASA sulfate/kg b.w./d for 28 days to rats resulted in significantly increased body weight gain and food and water consumption. Alanine aminotransferase and alkaline phosphatase values were elevated in high-dosed (2500 mg/kg b.w./d p.o.) males. Relative liver weights were significantly increased in high-dosed males and females and the macroscopical inspection revealed thickened liver margins. The no-effect level following 28 days of oral application to rats was determined as 500 mg 5-ASA sulfate/kg b.w./d. In acute local tolerance studies in rabbits, 5-ASA sulfate is rated as non-irritant to the skin and the eye. After a single oral administration of 1800 mg 5-ASA sulfate to 5 healthy human test subjects, 5-ASA sulfate was almost completely metabolized by all test subjects within 3 days; mean urinary and faecal excretion of unchanged 5-ASA sulfate amounted to only 6.7% of the administered dose. A high faecal excretion of the active metabolite 5-aminosalicylic acid (5-ASA) (21.2% of the administered dose) and a low urinary excretion (1.4% of the administered dose) were observed.},

   abstract = {Although many foods have been suggested to play a role in the cause of IBD, there are not yet definitive data to support diet as a cause of either CD or UC. Malnutrition is a common occurrence in IBD, and this must be considered in the treatment of these diseases. Nutritional support in IBD has limited use as primary therapy (Table 2). Even though parenteral and enteral nutrition have been associated with remission, relapse frequently occurs when normal food intake is resumed. Likewise, fistulae may resolve with aggressive, nutritional therapy, but they frequently recur with reinstitution of food. In short bowel syndrome caused by extensive intestinal resection performed in CD, parenteral nutrition provides an important mode of therapy. In addition, perioperative use of nutritional support may decrease the incidence of postoperative complications in patients who are malnourished. Nutritional support in pediatric patients with CD who have growth failure has been effective in stimulating growth.},

The number of participating hospitals in 1429 and they are distributed throughout Japan. A total number of 10819 patients diagnosed with UC have been registered, including 197 patients with a positive family history. In this present study, genetic or environmental factors that may be operative in the development of UC were investigated. After 1966, the annual incidence of UC increased rapidly, to a peak in 1974, tending to remain at the same level since 1975. Since 1975, the daily intake of dairy products and meat increased, paralleling the increase in the incidence of UC. The trends of the increase in the incidence of UC and the increase in the daily intake of meat were very similar. The tendency for UC to occur in families was high, especially in first-degree relatives, and the age at onset of UC in patients where there was familial occurrence was younger. There was no difference in HLA antigens between UC patients with familial occurrence and the unaffected relatives studied. It is presumed that not only genetic factors but also environmental factors may be operative in the development of UC.},

Contradictory evidence from different studies on the pathogenic mechanisms may simply mean that there is not one but several types of ulcerative colitis. Chronic inflammation of the intestine would cover a heterogeneous group of conditions. Genetic susceptibility controlling one of more anomalies of the immune system would be triggered by external factors such as respiratory or food allergies, viral or bacterial infections or other factors including smoking or stress. The wide range of factors involved would explain the variety of findings reported by different groups searching for a single pathogenic mechanism. Finally, as emphasized by other authors, screening for subgroups of patients with allergy among the ulcerative colitis population would be useful in adapting treatment and developing a more specific therapeutic strategy not only for acute phases but perhaps also for preventive treatment.},

The aim of this research was to study, using the dextran sulfate induced acute colitis (AC) model, the effect of an EPA-rich shark fin supplemented diet on the mucosal lipid composition. The histology score increased in AC (p < 0.05), but only slightly in the EPA group. Similarly, colonic permeability to a intraluminally instilled water-soluble contrast medium significantly increased in the AC group, but not in EPA group. As compared with controls, the AC group showed lower levels of phosphatidylethanolamine, phosphatidylinositol, free fatty acid C20:5, and PL-FA C18:1 and C18:2 and higher levels of sphingomyelin, lysophosphatidylcholine, and C18:1 and free fatty acid C20:4 (p < 0.01) after 2 and 7 days. In the EPA group sphinogmyelin and lysophosphatidylcholine slightly increased and free fatty acid C20:4 decreased (p < 0.05) after 7 days, and no PL-FA change occurred. This study confirms the protective properties of EPA-rich marine food. EPA-enriched diet is protecting the colonic mucosa from the early derangements of lipid components occurring in this experimental AC model. This effect is likely to contribute to maintain an effective mucosal lining barrier.},

Though changes in dietary habits and incidence of inflammatory bowel disease during the last century were in parallel, no specific nutritional factor has been isolated. No dietary prophylaxis of inflammatory bowel disease is yet known; all dietary therapies in inflammatory bowel disease aim to improve nutritional support and to diminish inflammation by bowel rest. Children and adolescents gain in weight and height. Total parenteral nutrition will not substantially reduce disease activity and operation rates. Total parenteral nutrition can only be recommended in ulcerative colitis patients with severe disease in the initial phase and in Crohn's patients with severe malnutrition and intestinal complications. Enteral nutrition support is less effective in ulcerative colitis than in Crohn's disease. Reported remission rates on enteral nutrition are 25% for ulcerative colitis and up to 80% for Crohn. However, in active Crohn's disease enteral nutrition is less effective than standard therapy with methylprednisolone and sulfasalizine. It is generally believed that nutrition therapy in combination with drugs is the best treatment modality. There is no evidence to support the importance of any combination of the formula diets such as elemental, oligopeptide, or polymeric formulations. Administration of formula diets by nasogastric tubes all show similar remission rates. Whether newer diets supplemented with arginine, glutamine, omega-3-fatty acids or short chain fatty acids increase remission rates is not known. Further studies in this field are warranted.},

   abstract = {Fermentation, the process whereby anaerobic bacteria break down carbohydrates to short-chain (C2-C6) fatty acids (SCFAs), is an important function of the large bowel. SCFAs constitute approximately two-thirds of the colonic anion concentration (70-130 mmol/l), mainly as acetate, propionate, and butyrate. Gastroenterologists have, in spite of these facts, addressed this scientific field surprisingly late, in contrast to veterinarians, for whom the fermentative production of SCFAs has been acknowledged as a principal mechanism of intestinal digestion in plant-eating animals for decades. Interest in the effects of SCFA production on the human organism has been growing rapidly in the last 10 years, because gastrointestinal functions and beneficial effects are associated with these acids. SCFAs are of major importance in the understanding of the physiological function of dietary fibre and their possible role for colonic neoplasia. SCFA production and absorption are closely related to the nourishment of the colonic mucosa and sodium and water absorption, and mechanisms of diarrhoea. Patients with severe malabsorption compensate by the fermentation of otherwise osmotic active saccharides to SCFAs, which are readily absorbed and used as energy fuels in the organism. SCFA production from dietary carbohydrates is a mechanism whereby considerable amounts of calories can be salvaged in short-bowel patients with remaining colonic function if dietary treatment is adjusted. SCFA enemas are a new and promising treatment modality for patients with ulcerative colitis. The effect has been attributed to the oxidation of SCFAs in the colonocytes. An impressive number of papers have described the effects of butyrate on various cell functions, the significance of which is still unknown. Up until now, attention has been related especially to cancer prophylaxis and treatment. Diminished production of SCFAs appears to be involved in antibiotic-associated diarrhoea, diversion colitis, and possibly in pouchitis. The interaction between bacterial fermentation, ammonia metabolism, and bacterial growth and protein synthesis appears to be the main mechanism of action of lactulose treatment in hepatic coma. Pathological and extremely high rates of saccharide fermentation explain the severe deterioration in patients with D-lactate acidosis. Hence, this scientific field has come late to clinical working gastroenterologists, but as work is progressing the production of SCFAs in the large bowel becomes involved in several well-known intestinal disorders.},

   abstract = {Nutrition and intestinal function are intimately interrelated. The chief purpose of the gut is to digest and absorb nutrients in order to maintain life. Consequently, chronic gastrointestinal (GI) disease commonly results in malnutrition and increased morbidity and mortality. For example, studies have shown that 50-70% of adult patients with Crohn's disease were weight-depleted and 75% of adolescents growth-retarded. On the other hand, chronic malnutrition impairs digestive and absorptive function because food and nutrients are not only the major trophic factors to the gut but also provide the building blocks for digestive enzymes and absorptive cells. For example, recent studies of ours have shown that a weight loss of greater than 30% accompanying a variety of diseases was associated with a reduction in pancreatic enzyme secretion of over 80%, villus atrophy and impaired carbohydrate and fat absorption. Finally, specific nutrients can induce disease, for example, gluten-sensitive enteropathy, whilst dietary factors such as fibre, resistant starch, short-chain fatty acids, glutamine and fish-oils may prevent gastrointestinal diseases such as diverticulitis, diversion colitis, ulcerative colitis, colonic adenomatosis and colonic carcinoma. The role of dietary antigens in the aetiology of Crohn's disease is controversial, but controlled studies have suggested that elemental diets may be as effective as corticosteroids in inducing a remission in patients with acute Crohn's disease. In conclusion, nutrition has both a supportive and therapeutic role in the management of chronic gastrointestinal diseases. With the development of modern techniques of nutritional support, the morbidity and mortality associated with chronic GI disease can be reduced. On the other hand, dietary manipulation may be used to treat to prevent specific GI disorders such as coeliac disease, functional bowel disease, Crohn's disease and colonic neoplasia. The future development of nutria-pharmaceuticals is particularly attractive in view of their low cost and wide safety margins.},

The molecular characteristics, intracellular distribution, and source of this pigment is described. Laser scanning and electron microscopy showed that pigmented macrophages were often closely related to collagen fibres and plasma cells in GALT of both small and large intestine and contained numerous phagolysosomes, previously described as granules, that are rich in electron dense submicron sized particles. Morphological assessment, x ray microanalysis, and image electron energy loss spectroscopy showed three distinct types of microparticle: type I - spheres of titanium dioxide, 100-200 nm diameter, characterised as the synthetic food-additive polymorph anatase; type II - aluminosilicates, < 100-400 nm in length, generally of flaky appearance, often with adsorbed surface iron, and mostly characteristic of the natural clay mineral kaolinite; and type III - mixed environmental silicates without aluminium, 100-700 nm in length and of variable morphology. Thus, this cellular pigment that is partly derived from food additives and partly from the environment is composed of inert inorganic microparticles and loaded into phagolysosomes of macrophages within the GALT of all human subjects. These observations suggest that the pathogenicity of this pigment should be further investigated since, in susceptible individuals, the same intracellular distribution of these three types of submicron particle causes chronic latent granulomatous inflammation.},

Then she developed toxic megacolon, and was transferred to our hospital on the 1st of July and underwent subtotal colectomy the same day. After surgery, she received intravenous hyperalimentation (IVH) which contained 1,000 Kcal/day without vitamin supplementation. From the 8th to the 13th post-operative days, she took 3/4 or more of the liquid diet which contained 1,050 Kcal, protein 35 g, carbohydrate 166 g and vitamin B1 0.59 mg per day. From the 14th to the 23rd post-operative days, she ate 4/5 or more of the oral diet which contained 1,700 Kcal/day, protein 68 g, carbohydrate 236 g and vitamin B1 0.93 mg per day. During the 7th to the 23rd day, the IVH was reduced to 800 Kcal and then 500 Kcal per day. She talked less on the 19th post-operative day, and in a few days, her level of consciousness began to decline progressively. On the 27th post-operative day, neurological examinations revealed the following: semi-coma, almost fixed pupils which were 3 mm in diameter, absent doll's eye movement to all directions, flaccid extremities with abolished deep tendon reflexes. Pertinent abnormalities on laboratory data at that time consisted of hemoglobin 7.8 g/dl and serum total protein 5.4 g/dl. Lumbar puncture revealed normal cerebrospinal fluid under normal opening pressure. Cranial magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) taken on the 27th post-operative day demonstrated, on T2-weighted images, symmetrical high intensity lesions in the periventricular areas of the third and fourth ventricles, and periaqueductal area of the midbrain.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS)},

Thirty patients with IBD and thirty matched healthy controls were studied. Most antibodies were increased in IBD patients compared to controls. Statistically significant increases were more frequent in Crohn's disease (CD) than in ulcerative colitis (UC). An unexpected finding was that IBD patients treated with sulfasalazine had statistically higher levels of most IgA antibodies than healthy controls, while steroid treated patients had lower levels. These findings suggest differing effects on the immune systems of IBD patients by each of these commonly used drugs.},

The differences in diet between patients and healthy subjects matched for age, sex and city of residence were determined. RESULTS: Our data confirm that patients with Crohn's disease and ulcerative colitis have a high intake of total carbohydrate, starch and refined sugar. This resulted in a significantly higher relative risk (P < 0.001) in both ulcerative colitis and Crohn's disease patients. Total protein intake was significantly higher in ulcerative colitis, but not in Crohn's disease patients, than in controls. Fibre consumption did not differ between patients and controls. CONCLUSIONS: Our results confirm that carbohydrate consumption is significantly higher in IBD patients than in healthy controls. Ulcerative colitis patients also consumed more total protein than controls. The pathogenetic significance of these findings, however, remains unclear.},

   abstract = {The value of intense nutritional support in inflammatory bowel disease is still debated. Claims have been made that total enteral nutrition is as effective as total parental nutrition. In this review, the use of parenteral and enteral nutritional support as primary therapy in patients with inflammatory bowel disease has been critically evaluated. Most studies have been uncontrolled and nonrandomized with short-term follow-up. The literature does suggest, however, that intense nutritional support may have an adjunctive role to drug therapy in achieving remission in Crohn's disease, especially in corticosteroid-refractory patients. Nutritional support has a lesser role in chronic ulcerative colitis, except for assistance in pre- and postoperative management. The data do not support one variety of nutritional support over another, although enteral support should be used if possible, as it is less costly and potentially less complicated.},

   abstract = {Malnutrition is common in inflammatory bowel disease; deficiencies of multiple micronutrients and macronutrients can present a diagnostic and therapeutic challenge to the clinician. Enteral and parenteral nutrition have been used as adjunctive therapy to correct or prevent malnutrition in inflammatory bowel disease. In addition, some authors have advocated enteral and parenteral nutrition as primary therapy of acute inflammatory bowel disease. The efficacy of these nutritional therapies in the management of Crohn's disease and ulcerative colitis is reviewed.},
