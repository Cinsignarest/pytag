   abstract = {Individuals with celiac disease present with a wide array of symptoms and signs. Celiac disease can result in substantial injury to the small intestine, deleterious effects on other organ systems, and an overall doubling of mortality. The role of the gastroenterologist is primarily to make the diagnosis and then to ensure that patients with celiac disease receive up-to-date and accurate instructions on diet. It is our opinion that gastroenterologists should participate in the follow-up of what is in fact a form of inflammatory bowel disease. The failure to identify and treat patients with substantial problems may result in an excess of preventable morbidity and mortality. Intestinal biopsy is the definitive method of making the diagnosis of celiac disease, provided the patient has not excluded gluten from his or her diet, because exclusion of gluten results in negative serologic test results and normal small intestinal biopsy samples. The removal of gluten from the diet can result in a total recovery of gut function and a correction of most other consequences. The response is usually so complete that patients should consider themselves to be basically healthy as long as they stay away from the offending foods. However, the execution and maintenance of the "theoretically simple" exclusion of gluten is difficult. The condition is permanent and mandates adherence to a lifelong gluten-free diet; even small amounts of gluten can result in injury to the intestinal lining. The diet is restrictive and requires the patient to be careful about food choices. Therefore, patient education and motivation are crucial to a successful outcome. The correction of vitamin and mineral deficiencies may be helpful in aiding recovery; vitamin D and calcium supplementation often is recommended. No drug therapy has been proven to suppress the disease.},

   abstract = {BACKGROUND: Cereals are among the major foods that account for food hypersensitivity reactions. Salt-soluble proteins appear to be the most important allergens contributing to the asthmatic response. In contrast, very limited information is available regarding cereal allergens responsible for allergic reactions after ingestion of cereal proteins. OBJECTIVE: The aim of this study was to evaluate the allergenic reactivity of ingested and inhaled cereal allergens in different ages, in order to investigate if the response to different allergens would depend on the sensitization route. METHODS: We included 66 patients in three groups. Group 1: 40 children aged 3 to 6 months who suffered from diarrhoea, vomiting, eczema or weight loss after the introduction of cereal formula in their diet and in which a possibility of coeliac disease was discarded. Group 2: 18 adults with food allergy due to cereals tested by prick tests, specific IgE and food challenge. Group 3: eight patients previously diagnosed as having baker's asthma. Sera pool samples were collected from each group of patients and IgE immunoblotting was performed. RESULTS: We found an important sensitization to cereal in the 40 children. The most important allergens were wheat followed by barley and rye. Among the adults with cereal allergy, sensitization to other allergens was common, especially to Lolium perenne (rye grass) pollen. Immunoblotting showed similar allergenic detection in the three groups. CONCLUSION: Clinically significant reactivity to cereal may be observed in early life. Inhalation and ingestion routes causing cereal allergy seem to involve similar allergens. The diet control was more effective in children. The possibility of cereal allergy after the introduction of cereal formula during the lactation period should not be underestimated.},

Epidemiological studies indicate that environmental factors, like the infant feeding pattern, affect the clinical presentation while population-screening studies indicate that the prevalence, at least in Caucasian populations, is similar. Secondary complications, like malignancies, osteopenia - osteoporosis, gynaecological and obstetrical problems and autoimmune diseases, are common. The risk is reduced or prevented by treatment with a gluten-free diet. The basis for such a secondary prevention is: 1. early case-finding by a) knowledge about different presentations of the disease and factors affecting that, b) generous serological testing in patients with vague symptoms, c) screening of risk groups, and, 2. support for children and adolescents with coeliac disease to comply with the gluten-free diet.},

   abstract = {BACKGROUND: Macroamylasemia (MA) is a benign condition caused by circulating macroamylase complexes of pancreatic or salivary amylase bound to plasma proteins, which cannot be cleared by the renal glomeruli. In most cases, the macromolecular amylase represents a complex of normal amylase and either immunoglobulin A or G and may be a specific antigen-antibody complex. Celiac disease (CD) is a permanent intolerance to ingested gluten that results in immunologically mediated inflammatory damage of the small intestinal mucosa. Several recent population-based serologic surveys have shown CD to be a common disorder, possibly affecting 1 in 200 to 250 individuals in most countries studied, including the United States, where overt CD is rare, indicating a high proportion of subclinical disease. The diagnosis of CD currently rests on the histological demonstration of the characteristic lesion in the small intestine and the subsequent clinical response to the introduction of a gluten-free diet. MA associated with CD has been described in adult patients, and in a few cases, MA decreased or resolved after a strict gluten-free diet. A few single cases of MA have been described in childhood, but no association with CD has been reported so far. We report a girl with CD, autoimmune thyroiditis, and MA, in whom CD-related antibodies to amylase and to exocrine pancreas tissue resolved with a gluten-free diet. CASE REPORT: An 11-year-old girl was referred for chronic abdominal pain and growth retardation associated with persistent hyperamylasemia and suspected chronic pancreatitis. We confirmed elevated serum amylase, normal serum lipase, and very low 24-hour urine amylase and amylase clearance/creatinine clearance ratio, consistent with MA. Serologic tests for CD were positive, and the diagnosis was confirmed by small bowel biopsy showing subtotal villous atrophy. Thyroid function tests showed a pronounced hypothyroidism, associated with high titers of thyroid microsomal and thyroglobulin antibodies. Screening for other autoantibodies-including antinuclear, islet cell, glutamic acid decarboxylase, protein tyrosine phosphatase islet antigen 512, adrenal gland, and cytoplasmic neutrophil granulocyte antibodies-was negative. A diagnosis of CD, MA, and hypothyroidism attributable to autoimmune thyroiditis was made. A gluten-free diet and oral replacement with L-thyroxine was started with clinical improvement. Serum amylase and amylase clearance/creatinine clearance ratio normalized, consistent with resolution of MA. STUDY DESIGN AND METHODS: The patient's serum samples were obtained at the time of CD diagnosis and at 3 and 12 months after instituting a gluten-free diet. Serum samples from 10 consecutive untreated celiac children were disease controls, and 39 participants with no gastrointestinal symptoms and no family history of CD served as healthy controls. The origin of MA as determined by complexes of amylase with circulating immunoglobulins was tested by the measurement of amylase on supernatants after precipitation of immune complexes with either protein A Sepharose or polyethylene glycol. The precipitation of >60% of amylase activity was consistent with the presence of MA. Immunoglobulin G (IgG) and immunoglobulin A (IgA) circulating autoantibodies to amylase were measured using recently developed enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay (ELISA), using porcine amylase as antigen. Results were expressed as arbitrary units (AUs). Statistical analysis was performed by Student's t test for unpaired data. IgA and IgG antibodies to exocrine pancreas tissue were detected by indirect immunofluorescence on human pancreas cryosections. RESULTS: Serum immunoprecipitation with either protein A Sepharose or polyethylene glycol reduced amylase activity from 1698 to 89 U/L (94.8%) and to 75 U/L (95.6%), with only marginal reduction in control serum samples. The ELISA for autoantibodies to amylase detected high values, both IgA (3531 AU) and IgG (1855 AU), in the serum sample from the patient at CD diagnosis. IgA autoantibodies (mean +/- standard deviation) were 3.4 +/- 2.5 AU in healthy controls, and 2.1 +/- 1.2 AU in celiac controls; IgG autoantibodies were 10 +/- 4.8 AU in healthy controls and 8.5 +/- 3.2 AU, respectively. Autoantibodies to exocrine pancreas tissue were documented in patient sera at the time of CD diagnosis, both IgA and IgG, but not in control groups. Preincubation of patient's serum with excess of alpha-amylase specifically inhibited antibody binding to coated amylase in the ELISA, and partially inhibited immunoreactivity to exocrine pancreas. Autoantibodies to alpha-amylase and to exocrine pancreas declined in CD patients after institution of a gluten-free diet. CONCLUSIONS: Few cases of MA have been described in children, and in all amylase determination was part of the clinical investigation for abdominal pain or trauma. (ABSTRACT TRUNCATED)},

   abstract = {Differential diagnosis between ulcerative colitis (UC) and Crohn's disease (CD) is difficult in the initial phases in pediatric patients with inflammatory bowel diseases (IBD). This study was performed to determine the significance of anti-neutrophil cytoplasmic antibodies (ANCA) and anti-Saccharomyces cerevisiae antibodies (ASCA) in IBD. ANCA were specified with regard to their antigenic specifity, significance to the diagnosis, and correlation of titer with the disease activity. The occurrence of food allergy was questioned, too. Serum samples from 44 children with UC (n = 23) or CD (n = 21) and from disease-control children (coeliac disease, n = 21) were analyzed for IgG ANCA, ANCA target antigens, IgA and IgG ASCA, and IgE to food allergens. Results show that ANCA occur more frequently in UC than in CD and disease-control (74, 24, and 10%, respectively). The presence of ANCA does not reflect disease activity. Antigenic specificity does not differ in any group. IgA-ASCA are found more often in patients with CD (76% versus 17% in UC). The testing for both ANCA and ASCA enabled clear-cut differential diagnosis between UC and CD based on the high specificity (ANCA+ ASCA- 92.5% for UC, ANCA- ASCA+ 93.2% for CD). Specific IgE to food allergens were found in 8.7, 14.3, and 23.8% of patients with UC, CD, and coeliac disease, respectively. We conclude that combined testing of ANCA and ASCA represents a valuable tool in the differential diagnosis between UC and CD in pediatric patients, minimizing invasive diagnostic procedures. Monitoring of ANCA, its specificity, and titer determination does not bring more information. Testing for specific IgE to food allergens may be considered in individual patients.},

   abstract = {INTRODUCTION: Celiac disease (nontropical sprue, gluten-sensitive enteropathy, chronic intestinal malabsorption disorder) is caused by gluten intolerance. This hereditary disorder is caused by sensitivity to gliadin. Because the body's own immune system causes the damage, celiac disease is considered to be an autoimmune disorder. However, it is also classified as a disease of malabsorption because nutrients are not absorbed. When people with celiac disease eat foods containing gluten, their immune system responds by damaging the small intestine. Specifically, tiny finger-like protrusions, called villi, on the lining of the small intestine are lost. The diagnosis is suspected on the basis of symptoms and signs, enhanced by laboratory and x-ray studies, and confirmed by biopsy revealing flat mucosa and subsequent clinical and histologic improvement on a gluten-free diet. Gluten must be excluded from diet. Supplementary vitamins, minerals and hematinics may be given depending on deficiency. CASE REPORT: This is a case report of a 23-year old female patient with a mineralization defect (osteomalacia) and secondary osteoporosis caused by long-time unrecognized celiac disease. The patient had many symptoms: short stature, steatorrhea, anemia, weight loss and chronic bone pain. Laboratory and x-ray studies and jejunal biopsy revealed a chronic intestinal malabsorption disorder caused by gluten intolerance. Gluten-free diet and supplementary vitamins, minerals and hematinics were included with apparent clinical remission. DISCUSSION AND CONCLUSION: Some people with celiac disease may not have symptoms. The undamaged part of their small intestine is able to absorb enough nutrients to prevent symptoms. However, people without symptoms are still at risk for complications of celiac disease. Biopsy of the small intestine is the best way to diagnose celiac disease. Decreased bone density (osteoporosis and osteomalacia) is a serious problem for celiacs. If calcium is not absorbed, due to small intestinal damage caused by untreated celiac disease, bones are not as dense. The only treatment for celiac disease is gluten-free diet, that is, avoiding all foods that contain gluten. For most people, this diet stops symptoms, heals the existing intestinal damage, and prevents further damage.},

   abstract = {Since 1987, successive framework programmes have contributed to strengthen European food research through the establishment of networks between research institutions, universities and companies from various European countries. In the FAIR programme (1994-1998), 118 research projects comprising nearly 1,000 participants from the European Union and Associated States have been supported in the food area with a European funding of about [symbol: see text] 108 million. Within the Quality of Life and Management of Living Resources programme (1998-2002), food research is mostly supported within the key action 'food, nutrition and health' with a budget of [symbol: see text] 290 million. After the first four deadlines, 735 eligible research proposals have already been received. Further to their evaluation by a panel of independent experts, 108 proposals have been funded or selected for funding representing a total contribution of about [symbol: see text] 168 million. Among those, several clusters of projects are now running on important topics such as probiotics, coeliac diseases, mycotoxins, GMO, safety and food for the elderly. In addition, technology stimulation measures are largely benefiting SMEs to foster their innovation potential. In January 2000, the European Commission adopted a Communication entitled "Towards the European Research Area (ERA)" with the objective to contribute to developing better framework conditions for research in Europe. On 21 February 2001, the Commission adopted proposals to be submitted to the European Parliament and Council for the next framework programme for research and innovation (2002-2006). The new framework programme that is becoming one of the financial instruments of the ERA aims at catalysing the integration of European research by: strengthening of links between the Community research effort and national and regional research policies; concentrating on a limited number of priority fields or research to which activities at the Union level can add real value. One of the seven priority areas, entitled 'food safety and health risks', is intended to help establish the integrated scientific and technological bases needed to develop a system of production and distribution of safe and healthy food and control food-related risks, relying in particular on biotechnology tools, as well as health risks associated with environmental changes. A total budget of [symbol: see text] 600 million is proposed for this priority. In the priority areas, the new framework programme will work mainly by supporting the development of cooperation within networks of excellence bringing together the best research capabilities in Europe's regions to conduct common research programmes and integrated projects involving public and private partners, with clearly stated scientific and technological objectives.},

Before the onset of clinical symptoms, the patient had received a series of hepatitis B vaccinations but had not developed a measurable antibody response or any allergic reaction. Radioallergosorbent test results were positive to several foods, and the total serum immunoglobulin E (IgE) level was elevated. Adherence to a gluten-free diet caused a normalization in the endomysial antibody titer; however, the total serum IgE level continued to increase, and the total eosinophil count remained elevated. Symptoms of recurrent vomiting and abdominal pain necessitated prednisone burst therapy. The simultaneous occurrence of eosinophilic gastroenteritis and gluten-sensitive enteropathy is rare; therapy should be directed to each disorder individually.},

   abstract = {OBJECTIVE: To investigate the consequences of having a chronic digestive disorder on the social position of adolescents. METHODS: Five diagnostic groups, including inflammatory bowel disease (IBD), chronic liver diseases, congenital digestive disorders, coeliac disease and food allergy (total n = 758, ages 12-25 years), were each compared with a population-based control group in a multicentre study using a cross-sectional design. Social position was assessed by a mailed questionnaire measuring 24 aspects, categorized as education, leisure activities, friendship, labour participation, financial situation, partnership and sexuality. RESULTS: Eight aspects of social position were found to be affected negatively by one or more chronic digestive diseases: absence from school due to illness, going out, having a paid job, needing re-education in order to get a job, getting benefits as main income source, encountering bottlenecks in establishing financial commitments, having self-confidence in making a pass at someone, and restrictions in making love. Adolescents with chronic liver disease and IBD were found to experience more restrictions in social position. Adolescents with food allergy and congenital digestive disorders appear to experience some restrictions, but to a lesser degree, and adolescents with coeliac disease do not appear to have any problems regarding social position compared with controls. CONCLUSION: The social position of adolescents is affected negatively by having a chronic digestive disease, in particular chronic liver disease and IBD. Negative consequences occur in education, leisure activities, labour participation, financial situation, partnership and sexuality.},

   abstract = {Recent data suggest that celiac disease, or gluten-sensitive enteropathy, is a common disorder not only in populations of European ancestry, but also in developing areas, such as North Africa, Middle East and India. The world distribution of celiac disease apparently relates to the consumption of gluten-containing cereals. In the Arab people of Saharawi, the prevalence of celiac disease in children is so high (more than 5%) that this condition represents a primary health problem. In developing countries the clinical picture of celiac disease is often typical, characterized by chronic diarrhea, malnutrition, stunting and increased mortality, especially in younger children. The high prevalence of celiac disease in areas showing a poor sanitary condition could be explained by a protective role of the celiac enteropathy (against intestinal infections) in the context of a low gluten consumption. The problem of celiac disease in developing countries should by approached by a multifaceted strategy, based on (1) increasing disease awareness and diagnostic facilities and (2) a "flexible" dietary intervention that takes into account the nutritional habits and local food availability.},

   abstract = {BACKGROUND AND AIMS: Celiac disease is the most common severe food intolerance in the Western world and is due to gluten ingestion in genetically susceptible children and adults. Intestinal biopsy is the golden standard for evaluation of mucosal damage associated with celiac disease. Gluten-free diet is the key treatment for celiac disease. Data on the long-term control of celiac disease are few and limited to small series of patients. The study reports data on the control of celiac disease and on its correlates in a large cohort of celiac adults during long-term treatment with gluten-free diet. METHODS: The study cohort comprises 91 men and 299 women having undergone treatment with a gluten-free diet for at least 2 years and with complete records for visits at the time of diagnosis of celiac disease (baseline). Data collection included gender, age, education, weight, bowel habit, blood hemoglobin, plasma albumin and cholesterol, serum antiendomysium antibodies (EMA), dietary compliance to gluten-free diet (coded as good, low, or very low), and intestinal damage at biopsy (coded as absent, mild, or severe). RESULTS: The duration of follow-up was 6.9 +/- 7.5 years (mean +/- SD, range 2-22 years). At follow-up visit, intestinal damage was absent in 170 patients (43.6%), mild in 127 (32.6%), and severe in 93 (23.8%). At follow-up, intestinal damage was significantly associated with dietary compliance, EMA, and plasma albumin (follow-up value and change value from baseline to follow-up). Baseline education significantly predicted dietary compliance and intestinal damage at follow-up. CONCLUSIONS: Celiac disease is often poorly controlled in the majority of patients on long-term treatment with a gluten-free diet as demonstrated by intestinal biopsy. Lack of adherence to strict gluten-free diet is the main reason of poorly controlled disease in adults. Laboratory and clinical information have a high positive predictive value and low negative predictive value for intestinal damage on long-term treatment. Dietary compliance as assessed by interview is the best marker of celiac disease control due to low cost, noninvasivity, and strong correlation with intestinal damage.},

Treatment of the crude extract with an excess of pure ethanol resulted in the removal of the majority of these compounds. Prolamin extracts obtained following ethanol precipitation showed little difference to products of more complex, multi stage, selective extractions, when compared using MALDI-TOF mass spectrometry. Toxicity tests on enzymic digests of ethanol-precipitated prolamins from coeliac-toxic cereals, coeliac-non-toxic cereals and oats were carried out using a rat liver lysosome assay. The prolamins from the ethanol-precipitated extracts showed greater activity than those extracted using only 70% ethanol for extraction. As the ethanol precipitation method is simple and provides a prolamin extract of sufficient purity for further evaluation, this procedure has been adopted as an alternative to more tedious procedures for preparation of cereal prolamins.},

Although linoleic acid still produced significant suppression of intake in rats with celiac vagotomy, it was less effective in these animals than in controls. The temporal pattern of results suggested that celiac afferent fibers are involved in mediating both pre- and postabsorptive effects of infused fatty acids.},

A reaction to food proteins that is mediated by immunologic events is referred to as food allergy or food hypersensitivity. One of the most common types of food allergy is the IgE-mediated immediate hypersensitivity reaction to foods, which can give rise to dermatologic and respiratory tract symptoms in addition to GI complaints. Other GI forms of food allergy include food protein-induced enterocolitis or gastroenteropathy, celiac disease, and some cases of eosinophilic gastroenteritis. Because most patients complaining of adverse reactions to food have non-immune mechanisms for their complaints, it is important to distinguish the various types of ARF, as their management may differ substantially. Recent advances in the field of food allergy provide opportunities to improve diagnostic methods and develop new modalities for management that will complement the current practice of allergen avoidance.},

   abstract = {The gastrointestinal tract constitutes one of the largest sites of exposure to the outside environment. The function of the gastrointestinal tract in monitoring and sealing the host interior from intruders is called the gut barrier. A variety of specific and nonspecific mechanisms are in operation to establish the host barrier; these include luminal mechanisms and digestive enzymes, the epithelial cells together with tight junctions in between them, and the gut immune system. Disruptions in the gut barrier follow injury from various causes including nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drugs and oxidant stress, and involve mechanisms such as adenosine triphosphate depletion and damage to epithelial cell cytoskeletons that regulate tight junctions. Ample evidence links gut barrier dysfunction to multiorgan system failure in sepsis and immune dysregulation. Additionally, contribution of gut barrier dysfunction to gastrointestinal disease is an evolving concept and is the focus of this review. An overview of the evidence for the role of gut barrier dysfunction in disorders such as Crohn's disease, celiac disease, food allergy, acute pancreatitis, non-alcoholic fatty liver disease, and alcoholic liver disease is provided, together with critical insight into the implications of this evidence as a primary disease mechanism.},

The mechanism by which CCK release is impaired is poorly understood and seems to be related to the mucosal atrophy or to decreased stimulation due to reduced intraduodenal nutrient hydrolysis. The aims of our study were to evaluate basal and postprandial CCK in celiac patients presenting with distinctive types of mucosal lesions (normal, infiltrative and atrophic), and to study the role of protein hydrolysis on CCK release. Plasma CCK was measured in 20 celiac patients (normal mucosa: n=6; infiltrative type: n=6; atrophic type=8) and 9 controls, before and after ingestion of a polymeric or a semi-elemental meal. Significant decreases in basal CCK plasma (B 0.6 [95% CI, 0.3-1.3] pmol/l; p<0.003) and postprandial CCK area under curve (AUC 34 [19-61] pmol/l x 120 min, p<0.0001) were observed in patients with an atrophic mucosa compared with treated patients (B 1.6 [1.0-2.4] pmol/l, AUC 267 [172-414] pmol/l x 120 min) or healthy volunteers (B 1.0 [0.7-1.4] pmol/l, AUC 186 [131-264] pmol/l x 120 min). A significant defective CCK release was also observed in patients with an infiltrative type: B 0.4 [0.2-0.7] pmol/l and AUC 56 [31-101] pmol/l x 120 min; p<0.0001. Administration of a semi-elemental diet did not correct the defective CCK release. In conclusion, the decreased CCK levels observed in celiac patients are not strictly related to the mucosal atrophy but rather to the lymphocytic infiltrate. Administration of a predigested meal did not correct the impaired CCK release. Some inhibitory mechanism could be involved in the CCK cell dysfunction observed in celiac patients presenting with lesser degrees of disease activity.},

Based on their hydrolysis profile patterns, Lactobacillus alimentarius 15M, Lactobacillus brevis 14G, Lactobacillus sanfranciscensis 7A, and Lactobacillus hilgardii 51B were selected and used in sourdough fermentation. A fractionated method of protein extraction and subsequent two-dimensional electrophoresis were used to estimate proteolysis in sourdoughs. Compared to a chemically acidified (pH 4.4) dough, 37 to 42 polypeptides, distributed over a wide range of pIs and molecular masses, were hydrolyzed by L. alimentarius 15M, L. brevis 14G, and L. sanfranciscensis 7A. Albumin, globulin, and gliadin fractions were hydrolyzed, while glutenins were not degraded. The concentrations of free amino acids, especially proline and glutamic and aspartic acids, also increased in sourdoughs. Compared to the chemically acidified dough, proteolysis by lactobacilli positively influenced the softening of the dough during fermentation, as determined by rheological analyses. Enzyme preparations of the selected lactobacilli which contained proteinase or peptidase enzymes showed hydrolysis of the 31-43 fragment of A-gliadin, a toxic peptide for celiac patients. A toxic peptic-tryptic (PT) digest of gliadins was used for in vitro agglutination tests on K 562 (S) subclone cells of human myelagenous leukemia origin. The lowest concentration of PT digest that agglutinated 100% of the total cells was 0.218 g/liter. Hydrolysis of the PT digest by proteolytic enzymes of L. alimentarius 15M and L. brevis 14G completely prevented agglutination of the K 562 (S) cells by the PT digest at a concentration of 0.875 g/liter. Considerable inhibitory effects by other strains and at higher concentrations of the PT digest were also found. The mixture of peptides produced by enzyme preparations of selected lactobacilli showed a decreased agglutination of K 562 (S) cells with respect to the whole 31-43 fragment of A-gliadin.},

The LoVo (human colon adenocarcinoma) cell line grown in two-dimensional cultures was exposed to different concentrations of digested bread wheat gliadin (62, 125, 250, 500 and 750 microg/ml) for 48 h, after which cell growth and oxidative balance (the content of reduced glutathione (GSH), and peroxidase, transferase and reductase activity) was evaluated. Other food proteins were used as controls. Our data revealed a statistically significant inhibition of cell growth in proportion to the gliadin concentration (from 26 to 100%), combined with a decrease in GSH content (-38% at 500 microg/ml) and reduced enzymatic activity (-30% at 500 microg/ml). The controls did not show any noxious effect. Our results confirm the usefulness of LoVo cells in evaluating gliadin cytotoxicity and that they can be used to investigate the biological properties of gliadin.},

   abstract = {The pathogenesis of idiopathic chronic pancreatitis remains poorly understood despite the high expectations for ascribing the pancreatic damage in affected patients to genetic defects. Neither mutations in the cationic trypsinogen gene nor mutations of the cystic fibrosis conductance regulator gene account for the chronic pancreatitis noted in most patients with idiopathic chronic pancreatitis. Attempts to find an autoimmune basis for the pancreatitis in these patients have not been very successful. The diagnosis of small duct idiopathic chronic pancreatitis remains a great source of frustration for clinicians. Such patients with negative results of radiographic studies often cannot be diagnosed unless a hormone stimulation test such as a secretin test is performed. Although the porcine biologic form of secretin, which has been used to diagnose chronic pancreatitis, became unavailable because of widespread use in the treatment of children with autism, a synthetic form of porcine secretin has now been approved by the US Food and Drug Administration and is available. The true value of endoscopic ultrasonography in diagnosing small duct chronic pancreatitis remains to be fully defined. Endoscopic ultrasonography is becoming the test of choice in detecting radiographic abnormalities in both the parenchyma and ducts of the pancreas. Endoscopic ultrasonography-guided celiac plexus block can be performed relatively easily and very safely. It can provide excellent short-term pain relief in some patients, but reliable predictors of which patients will be successful with this therapy are not yet available. Because long-term follow-up data on the use of endoscopic ultrasonography in this respect are not available, and because the pain of chronic pancreatitis is, indeed, chronic, the role of endoscopic ultrasonography-guided celiac plexus block should be limited to treating those patients with chronic pancreatitis whose pain has not responded to other modalities.},

Linear IgA bullous dermatosis has a much lower prevalence of histological small bowel abnormalities, and lesions are not known to respond to gluten restriction. We report a patient with linear IgA bullous dermatosis and gluten-sensitive enteropathy. This report addresses the issue of whether linear IgA bullous dermatosis can be associated with gluten-sensitive enteropathy. We evaluated the response to gluten restriction and normal diet by following the status of the patient's jejunal biopsies and skin lesions. The patient responded to gluten restriction, as shown by resolution of jejunal abnormalities and skin lesions and subsequently by recurrence of jejunal abnormalities and skin lesions with reinstitution of a gluten-containing diet. This report demonstrates that linear IgA bullous dermatosis can respond to gluten restriction if an underlying gluten-sensitive enteropathy is present.},

   abstract = {Celiac disease (CD) is a syndrome characterized by damage of the small intestinal mucosa caused by the gliadin fraction of wheat gluten and similar alcohol-soluble proteins (prolamines) of barley and rye in genetically susceptible subjects. The presence of gluten in these subjects leads to self-perpetuating mucosal damage, whereas elimination of gluten results in full mucosal recovery. The clinical manifestations of CD are protean in nature and vary markedly with the age of the patient, the duration and extent of disease, and the presence of extraintestinal pathologic conditions. In addition to the classical gastrointestinal form, a variety of other clinical manifestations of the disease have been described, including atypical and asymptomatic forms. Therefore, diagnosis of CD is extremely challenging and relies on a sensitive and specific algorithm that allows the identification of different manifestations of the disease. Serologic tests developed in the last decade provide a noninvasive tool to screen both individuals at risk for the disease and the general population. However, the current gold standard for the diagnosis of CD remains histologic confirmation of the intestinal damage in serologically positive individuals. The keystone treatment of CD patients is a lifelong elimination diet in which food products containing gluten are avoided.},

The main food agent that provokes the strong and diffuse clinical symptoms has been known for several years to be gliadin, a protein present in a very large number of human foods derived from vegetables. Only recently, some biochemical and immunological aspects of this very common disease have been clarified, and tissue transglutaminase, a multifunctional and ubiquitous enzyme, has been identified as one of the major factors. This enzyme, through its catalytic activities, produces the main biochemical and immunological effects observed in patients affected by this disease. The aim of this review is to summarize the most recent findings concerning the relationships between the biochemical properties of tissue transglutaminase and the basic molecular mechanisms responsible for CD. In addition, we present some frequent clinical associations of CD with other human diseases, with particular reference to neuropsychiatric disorders. Possible molecular links between CD, neuropsychiatric disorders and biochemical activities of transglutaminase enzymes are discussed.},

In the present study of 23 males and females of the two species, wheat protein was tested but soy and milk products were excluded. One group had wheat and the other had rice in their diet. Blood samples and biopsies from the colon were taken. Results showed changes in the colon and an immune reaction to gliadin, a wheat protein related to coeliac disease in humans. A further immune reaction was also observed. Suggestions for further study and exclusion of cereal in the diet of these small, New World primates are discussed.},

   abstract = {BACKGROUND: Patients with coeliac disease are advised to keep to a lifelong gluten-free diet to remain well. Uncertainty still exists as to whether this gives a nutritionally balanced diet. AIM: To assess the vitamin nutrition status of a series of coeliac patients living on a gluten-free diet for 10 years. METHODS: Thirty adults with coeliac disease (mean age, 55 years; range, 45-64 years; 60% women), in biopsy-proven remission following 8-12 years of dietary treatment, were studied. We measured the total plasma homocysteine level, a metabolic marker of folate, vitamin B-6 and vitamin B-12 deficiency, and related plasma vitamin levels. The daily vitamin intake level was assessed using a 4-day food record. Normative data were obtained from the general population of the same age. RESULTS: Coeliac patients showed a higher total plasma homocysteine level than the general population, indicative of a poor vitamin status. In accordance, the plasma levels of folate and pyridoxal 5'-phosphate (active form of vitamin B-6) were low in 37% and 20%, respectively, and accounted for 33% of the variation of the total plasma homocysteine level (P < 0.008). The mean daily intakes of folate and vitamin B-12, but not of vitamin B-6, were significantly lower in coeliac patients than in controls. CONCLUSIONS: Half of the adult coeliac patients carefully treated with a gluten-free diet for several years showed signs of a poor vitamin status. This may have clinical implications considering the linkage between vitamin deficiency, elevated total plasma homocysteine levels and cardiovascular disease. The results may suggest that, when following up adults with coeliac disease, the vitamin status should be reviewed.},

   abstract = {The newborn has an immune system, very limited in size at birth and its postnatal expansion and maturation takes time. In the meantime the transplacental IgG antibodies from the mother play an important role for the protection of the infant. However, these antibodies act in tissues and induce inflammation and are energy-consuming. In contrast, the milk secretory IgA antibodies stop microbes already on the mucosa preventing infection, tissue engagement and energy loss. In addition, the milk contains many protective factors such as lactoferrin and oligosacharides functioning as analogues for microbial receptors preventing mucosal attachment, the initial step of most infections. As a result, breast-feeding significantly reduces the risk of neonatal septicemia, respiratory tract infections, otitis media, diarrhea, urinary tract infections, infection-induced wheezing and necrotizing enterocolitis. Via several mechanisms it seems that human milk can actively stimulate the immune system of the breast-fed infant. This reduces the risk of infections like otitis media, respiratory tract infections, diarrhea and infection-induced wheezing for several years after the termination of breast-feeding. Furthermore, it seems that breast-feeding decreases the risk of attracting celiac disease and allergic diseases. The latter has been much debated, but a recent critical review of published reports gives good support for long-term protection of allergic diseases, especially in high-risk children.},

   abstract = {Two recently identified immunodominant epitopes from alpha-gliadin account for most of the stimulatory activity of dietary gluten on intestinal and peripheral T lymphocytes in patients with celiac sprue. The proteolytic kinetics of peptides containing these epitopes were analyzed in vitro using soluble proteases from bovine and porcine pancreas and brush-border membrane vesicles from adult rat intestine. We showed that these proline-glutamine-rich epitopes are exceptionally resistant to enzymatic processing. Moreover, as estimated from the residual peptide structure and confirmed by exogenous peptidase supplementation, dipeptidyl peptidase IV and dipeptidyl carboxypeptidase I were identified as the rate-limiting enzymes in the digestive breakdown of these peptides. A similar conclusion also emerged from analogous studies with brush-border membrane from a human intestinal biopsy. Supplementation of rat brush-border membrane with trace quantities of a bacterial prolyl endopeptidase led to the rapid destruction of the immunodominant epitopes in these peptides. These results suggest a possible enzyme therapy strategy for celiac sprue, for which the only current therapeutic option is strict exclusion of gluten-containing food.},

   abstract = {The intestinal epithelium is a selective barrier where incompletely-digested food antigens are transmitted to the immune system. Food antigens are often the starting point of intestinal diseases such as food allergy or coeliac disease. The intestinal epithelial cells (IEC) take up and process food antigens mainly by fluid-phase transcytosis involving two functional pathways, one minor direct pathway without degradation and another major lysosomal degradative pathway. Among the peptidic metabolites generated during transepithelial transport of luminal antigens, some have a molecular mass compatible with a binding to restriction (major histocompatibility complex; MHC) molecules; the latter can be up regulated on enterocytes, especially in inflammatory conditions. Indeed, interferon-gamma not only increases the paracellular absorption of antigens, but also their transcytosis across epithelial cells. It has been reported that enterocytes may even directly present peptidic epitopes to underlying T-cells. As a new potential way of transmitting peptidic information to the local or systemic immune system, the secretion by IEC of antigen-presenting vesicles called exosomes and bearing MHC-peptide complexes has recently been proposed. Many other factors such as nutritional or environmental factors can also influence the properties of the epithelial barrier and the outcome of the immune response to lumen antigens.},

   abstract = {BACKGROUND: To further establish its role in the ileal brake mechanism, we determined the effect of the distal gut hormone peptide YY (PYY) on gallbladder motility and plasma gut hormones during the cephalic phase of meal stimulation. METHODS: Eight healthy volunteers were studied in a randomized crossover design, with or without intravenous infusion of a physiological dose of PYY. On each occasion, subjects underwent modified sham feeding followed by real feeding. RESULTS: PYY reduced gallbladder emptying in response to modified sham feeding from 23 +/- 5% to 5 +/- 7% (P < 0.01) and integrated plasma pancreatic polypeptide from 2337 +/- 397 pmol/L x 90 min to 903 +/- 232 pmol/L x 90 min (P < 0.01). PYY enhanced plasma cholecystokinin in response to real feeding from 53 +/- 9 pmol/L x 90 min to 82 +/- 17 pmol/L x 90 min (P < 0.05), but did not significantly affect maximum gallbladder emptying and tended to decrease plasma pancreatic polypeptide. CONCLUSION: Circulating PYY suppresses the cephalic phase of postprandial gallbladder emptying, but not meal stimulated maximum emptying. The results support the hypothesis that the effect of PYY on gallbladder emptying is mediated by vagal-dependent rather than cholecystokinin-dependent pathways.},

   abstract = {BACKGROUND: Celiac disease, or permanent gluten-sensitive enteropathy, is an immunologic disease strictly dependent on exposure to wheat gluten or related proteins in rye and barley. OBJECTIVE: The aim of this study was to explore whether breast-feeding and the mode of introducing dietary gluten influence the risk of celiac disease in childhood. DESIGN: A population-based incident case-referent study of Swedish children, 627 cases with celiac disease and 1254 referents, was conducted; 78% of the matched sets were included in the final analyses. A questionnaire was used to assess patterns of food introduction to infants. Models were built, based on current epidemiologic and immunologic knowledge of celiac disease, to study the potential influence of dietary patterns on disease risk and were evaluated by conditional logistic regression in multivariate analyses. RESULTS: The risk of celiac disease was reduced in children aged <2 y if they were still being breast-fed when dietary gluten was introduced [adjusted odds ratio (OR): 0.59; 95% CI: 0.42, 0.83]. This effect was even more pronounced in infants who continued to be breast-fed after dietary gluten was introduced (OR: 0.36; 95% CI: 0.26, 0.51). The risk was greater when gluten was introduced in the diet in large amounts (OR: 1.5; 95% CI: 1.1, 2.1) than when introduced in small or medium amounts. In older children, these risk factors were of no or only minor importance. CONCLUSIONS: The gradual introduction of gluten-containing foods into the diet of infants while they are still being breast-fed reduces the risk of celiac disease in early childhood and probably also during the subsequent childhood period.},

We sought to define the morphologic and immunohistochemical features of persistent CMSE. STUDY DESIGN: We studied 15 children with a definite diagnosis of CMSE on the basis of a blind challenge, 12 children with suspected cases of CMSE, 11 children with celiac disease, and 12 control children. RESULTS: Typical findings in children with CMSE were endoscopically visible lymphonodular hyperplasia of the duodenal bulb and lymphoid follicles without villous atrophy in biopsy samples. The patients with definite CMSE showed significantly increased densities of intraepithelial T cells skewed clearly to gammadelta(+) cells, compared with the control patients but fewer than in the patients with celiac disease. The study children showed no aberrant upregulation of HLA-DR expression in the duodenal mucosa, and the prevalence of HLA DQ2 antigen among them was equal to that in the control children. CONCLUSIONS: Our observations corroborated the claim that CMSE at school age is an identifiable clinical entity. Immunohistochemical findings suggest the abrogation of antigen tolerance locally on the gastrointestinal mucosa. A careful clinical assessment that includes a long elimination-challenge test supported by typical endoscopic and histologic findings form the basis for diagnosis.},

   abstract = {Food antigens and enteroviruses are possible triggers of type 1 diabetes. Because permeability of the intestinal epithelium may facilitate contact of these antigens with the mucosal immune system, we set out to study intestinal permeability in patients with type 1 diabetes. Children with type 1 diabetes (n = 26, mean age 12 years, mean duration of disease 4 years) and 24 healthy age-matched control children were given mannitol and lactulose orally, and their intestinal permeability was measured as a percentage of this dose recovered in urine. Patients with type 1 diabetes did not differ in their permeability to lactulose, nor was their lactulose/mannitol ratio any different from that of controls. However, patients with type 1 diabetes who had the HLA-DQB 1*02 allele and, therefore, a higher risk for celiac disease (CD) absorbed significantly more mannitol (mean + 95% CI): 17.7% (15.2-20.2) than did those negative for this allele: 12.3% (8.2-16.4), p = 0.04. Their lactulose permeability was also higher: 0.30 (0.16-0.44) and 0.09% (0-0.18), respectively, p = 0.02. Although the differences in permeability reach statistical significance, there was still much overlap between the two groups in terms of actual laboratory values. The higher permeability of patients with the HLA-DQB1*02 allele suggests that these patients may be more prone to develop abnormal immune responses to food antigens.},

   abstract = {BACKGROUND: Previously, a gluten challenge was customary to establish the diagnosis of celiac disease in children. There are no clear recommendations on how to perform this challenge or what markers to rely on for timing the biopsy after the challenge. The authors' aim was to monitor gluten intake, clinical symptoms, and antibody kinetics to evaluate the influence of gluten exposure during the challenge. METHODS: Twenty-five children under investigation for suspected celiac disease were challenged. One child was excluded because blood samples, food records, or biopsy was lacking. Median age at the postchallenge biopsy was 3.8 (2.7-8.8) years. The families kept daily records of the children's gluten intake and of symptoms that occurred. Blood samples were taken monthly for analysis of antigliadin and endomysium antibodies and total immunoglobulin A (IgA). A third biopsy was performed when clinical symptoms suggested a relapse. RESULTS: All 24 children showed deterioration of the mucosa or elevated antibodies during gluten challenge. Median duration of the challenge was 13 (5-51) weeks, and mean gluten intake was 1.7 (0.2-4.3) g/d and 0.1 (0.02-0.26) g/kg daily. CONCLUSIONS: Gluten intake during the challenge varied widely, and the parents were unable to give their children the recommended amount. Despite the small amounts given, all children showed signs of relapse at a clinical, laboratory, or histologic level. Much smaller amounts of gluten than previously suggested seem sufficient to cause relapse during gluten challenge in children.},

The etiology of CFS remains unclear; however, a number of recent studies have shown oxidative stress may be involved in its pathogenesis. The role of oxidative stress in CFS is an important area for current and future research as it suggests the use of antioxidants in the management of CFS. Specifically, the dietary supplements glutathione, N-acetylcysteine, alpha-lipoic acid, oligomeric proanthocyanidins, Ginkgo biloba, and Vaccinium myrtillus (bilberry) may be beneficial. In addition, research on food intolerance is discussed, since food intolerance may be involved in CFS symptom presentation and in oxidation via cytokine induction. Finally, recent evidence suggests celiac disease can present with neurological symptoms in the absence of gastrointestinal symptoms; therefore, celiac disease should be included in the differential diagnosis of CFS.},

   abstract = {Immunocytochemistry showed expression of aquaporin-1 (AQP1) water channels at sites involved in dietary fat processing, including intrahepatic cholangiocytes, gallbladder, pancreatic microvascular endothelium, and intestinal lacteals. To determine whether AQP1 has a role in dietary fat digestion and/or absorption, mice were placed on a diet that contained 50% fat. Whereas wild-type mice (3-3.5 wk of age, 10-12 g) gained 49 +/- 5% (SE, n = 50) body weight in 8 days, and heterozygous mice gained 46 +/- 4%, AQP1 null mice gained only 4 +/- 3%; weights became similar after return to a 6% fat diet after 6 days. The null mice on a high-fat diet acquired an oily appearance, developed steatorrhea with increased stool triglyceride content, and manifested serum hypotriglyceridemia. Supplementation of the high-fat diet with pancreatic enzymes partially corrected the decreased weight gain in null mice. Absorption of [(14)C]oleic acid from small intestine was not affected by AQP1 deletion, as determined by blood radioactivity after duodenal infusion. Lipase activity in feces and small intestine was remarkably greater in AQP1 null than wild-type mice on low- and high-fat diets. Fluid collections done in older mice (that are less sensitive to a high-fat diet) by ductal cannulation showed threefold increased pancreatic fluid flow in response to secretin/cholecystokinin, but volumes, pH, and amylase activities were affected little by AQP1 deletion, nor were bile flow rates and bile salt concentrations. Together, these results establish a dietary fat misprocessing defect in AQP1 null mice.},

If no immunological mechanism is responsible, it is termed intolerance. The following disorders are considered a consequence of food allergy: gastrointestinal reactions (oral allergy syndrome, vomiting, diarrhea, protein-induced enterocolitic syndrome, eosinophilic gastroenteritis); respiratory reactions (rhinitis, asthma, laryngeal edema); cutaneous reactions (urticaria-angioedema, atopic dermatitis); anaphylaxis. There is much recent evidence to consider celiac disease an immunological disorder. Food allergy diagnosis is based on history, SPT, specific IgE, food challenges. DBPCFC is fundamental for diagnosing true food allergy; patients who have had anaphylaxis to food must not undergo DBPCFC. Rapidly progressive respiratory reactions and anaphylactic shock are life-threatening reactions that can be caused by food allergy. The doses of food inducing anaphylaxis can be very low, therefore commercial cross-contamination with an unsuspected food during food processing can be risky for the food allergic patient. The prevention of severe anaphylactic food reactions may lie in interdisciplinary collaboration among allergologists, chemists, food technologists, and experts in food industry research.},

   abstract = {OBJECTIVES: Antibodies that detect coeliac-toxic prolamins from wheat, barley and rye are important tools for controlling the diet of coeliac disease patients. Recently, a monoclonal antibody R5 that recognizes wheat gliadin, barley hordein and rye secalin equally was described. In this study, the epitope recognized by R5 was investigated. METHODS: Both a phage-displayed heptapeptide library and overlapping peptides spanning the sequence of alpha- and gamma-type gliadins (pepscan) were screened for binding of R5. RESULTS: Both techniques yielded comparable pentapeptide consensus sequences (phage display QXPW/FP; pepscan QQPFP). According to recent observations, this peptide stretch may be of key importance in the pathogenicity of coeliac disease. This sequence occurs repetitively in prolamins (in gamma- and omega-type prolamins more frequently than in alpha-type prolamins) together with several homologous peptide stretches, which are recognized less strongly. CONCLUSIONS: R5 seems to be a good candidate for the specific detection of putative coeliac disease-active sequences in prolamins and thus represents a valuable tool for the quality control of gluten-free food.},

In the first part, structure and function of gut-associated mucosal tissue (GALT), including the role of secretory immunoglobulins and importance of oral tolerance are shown. In the second part, the pathogenesis of unknown origin gastrointestinal and liver diseases (gluten sensitive enteropathy, inflammatory bowel diseases, autoimmune liver diseases, autoimmune pancreatitis) is described. Then the immunology of some gastrointestinal infections (Helicobacter pylori, hepatitis virus B and C, and HIV) and of alcoholic and drug induced, liver diseases is briefly summarized.},

   abstract = {AIMS: The aim of this study was to investigate the association between the duration of breast-feeding and the age at the first gluten introduction into the infant diet and the incidence and age at onset of celiac disease. METHODS: In a case-control study, 143 children with celiac disease and 137 randomly recruited gender- and age-matched control children were administered a standardized questionnaire. Multivariate-adjusted odds ratios (OR) as estimates of the relative risk and corresponding 95% confidence intervals (95% CI) were calculated. RESULTS: The risk of developing celiac disease decreased significantly by 63% for children breast-fed for more than 2 months (OR 0.37, 95% CI 0.21-0.64) as compared with children breast-fed for 2 months or less. The age at first gluten introduction had no significant influence on the incidence of celiac disease (OR 0.72, 95% CI 0.29-1.79 comparing first gluten introduction into infant diet >3 months vs. < or =3 months). CONCLUSIONS: A significant protective effect on the incidence of celiac disease was suggested by the duration of breast-feeding (partial breast-feeding as well as exclusive breast-feeding). The data did not support an influence of the age at first dietary gluten exposure on the incidence of celiac disease. However, the age at first gluten exposure appeared to affect the age at onset of symptoms.},

Patients present with abdominal pain, weight loss, pancreatic calcifications, and glucose intolerance or diabetes mellitus. Etiologies include a protein-calorie malnourished state, a variety of exogenous food toxins, pancreatic duct anomalies, and a possible genetic predisposition. Chronic cyanide exposure from the diet may contribute to this disease, seen often in India, Asia, and Africa. The pancreatic duct of these patients often is markedly dilated, and may contain stones, with or without strictures. The risk of ductal carcinoma with this disease is accentuated. Treatment may be frustrating, and may include pancreatic enzymes, duct manipulations at endoscopic retrograde cholangiopancreatography, octreotide, celiac axis blocks for pain control, or surgery via drainage and/or resection.},

   abstract = {The finding of increased levels of immunoglobulin A (IgA) against food antigens in patients with IgA nephropathy prompted the hypothesis of an association between IgA nephropathy and celiac disease (CD). Attention was initially directed to antigliadin antibodies, then to IgA antiendomysial antibodies (IgA-EMA). IgG1-EMA have been found in patients with CD with IgA-EMA-negative results. The presence of IgA- and IgG1-EMA was investigated in 36 patients with IgA nephropathy, 15 patients with other primary glomerulonephritis, and 15 patients with lupus nephritis. IgA-EMA and IgG1-EMA were detected by indirect immunofluorescence analysis. At the time of renal biopsy, the following factors were evaluated: history of macroscopic hematuria, serum creatinine level, urinalysis, 24-hour proteinuria, blood pressure, and histological classification of IgA nephropathy. Sixteen of 36 patients with IgA nephropathy (44.4%) showed EMA positivity. Among patients with positive EMA, 12 patients (75%) were IgG1-EMA positive, 2 patients (12.5%) were IgA-EMA positive, and 2 patients (12.5%) were positive for both isotypes. No significant differences were observed between the two groups (EMA positive versus EMA negative) concerning age, serum creatinine level, macroscopic hematuria, blood pressure, 24-hour proteinuria, or degree of renal histological involvement. IgA- and IgG1-EMA were not detected in patients with other primary nephropathies or lupus nephritis. These results, based on the finding of IgG1-EMA, suggest a common pathogenetic pathway for CD and IgA nephropathy. On this basis, the presence of IgG1-EMA and/or IgA-EMA should be investigated in patients with IgA nephropathy. Furthermore, the role of a gluten-free diet in the natural history of IgA nephropathy, at least in EMA-positive patients, needs to be ascertained.},

   abstract = {Celiac Sprue is an HLA DQ2 (or DQ8)-associated autoimmune disorder of the human small intestine that is induced by dietary exposure to wheat gliadin and related proteins from barley, rye, and possibly other food grains. Recently, tissue transglutaminase (tTGase)-catalyzed deamidation of gliadin peptides has been shown to increase their potency for activating patient-derived, gliadin-specific T cells, suggesting that tTGase plays a causative role in the onset of an inflammatory response to toxic food grains. To dissect the molecular recognition features of tTGase for gluten derived peptides, the regioselectivity and steady-state kinetics of tTGase-catalyzed deamidation of known immunogenic peptides were investigated. The specificity of recombinant human tTGase for all immunogenic peptides tested was comparable to and, in some cases, appreciably higher than the specificity for its natural substrate. Although each peptide was glutamine-rich, tTGase exhibited a high degree of regioselectivity for a particular glutamine residue in each peptide. This selectivity correlated well with Q --> E substitutions that have earlier been shown to enhance the immunogenicity of the corresponding gliadin peptides. The specificity of tTGase toward homologues of PQPQLPY, a sequence motif found in immunodominant gliadin peptides, was analyzed in detail. Remarkably, the primary amino acid sequences of wheat-, rye-, and barley-derived proteins included many single-residue variants of this sequence that were high-affinity substrates of tTGase, whereas the closest homologues of this sequence found in rice, corn, or oat proteins were much poorer substrates of tTGase. (Rice, corn, and oats are nontoxic ingredients of the Celiac diet.) No consensus sequence for a high-affinity substrate of tTGase could be derived from our data, suggesting that the secondary structures of these food-grain peptides were important in their recognition by tTGase. Finally, under steady-state turnover conditions, a significant fraction of the tTGase active site was covalently bound to a representative high-affinity immunogenic gliadin peptide, suggesting a common mechanism by which cells responsible for immune surveillance of the intestinal tract recognize and generate an antibody response against both gliadin and tTGase. In addition to providing a quantitative framework for understanding the role of tTGase in Celiac Sprue, our results lay the groundwork for the design of small molecule mimetics of gliadin peptides as selective inhibitors of tTGase.},

Responses of hepatic vagal afferents were highly variable across individual rats, whereas those of celiac vagal afferents were remarkably consistent across individual rats. These data suggest that MA-induced enhanced feeding in rats given a fat-enriched diet does not depend on a stronger hepatic and/or celiac vagal afferent response than that of rats given a low-fat diet.},

   abstract = {OBJECTIVE: To characterize the clinical and nutritional impact of coeliac disease (gluten-sensitive enteropathy) among Saharawi children living as refugees in Algeria. METHODS: A total of 65 Saharawi children with coeliac disease were compared with 71 age-matched non-coeliac controls. For each participant, the clinical history was taken and a clinical examination, non-quantitative 24-hour dietary recall, anthropometric and skinfold measurements, bioelectric impedance analysis (BIA) of body composition, and venous blood sampling for haemoglobin determination were performed. RESULTS: Gluten-containing food, especially bread, was the staple diet of Saharawi children. Abdominal pain and distension were significantly commoner among children with coeliac disease than in controls (P < 0.05). The mean height-for-age was significantly lower in such children than in controls (-2.5 +/- 1.4 units vs -1.8 +/- 1.3 units, respectively, P < 0.01). No significant differences were found for either skinfold or BIA measurements. Haemoglobin values tended to be lower in children with coeliac disease than in controls. CONCLUSIONS: Coeliac disease has a negative effect on the health status of Saharawi refugee children. Because of the high prevalence of the condition in the Saharawi, a specific programme for treating all affected individuals should be established. Further studies are required to quantify the impact of coeliac disease in other areas of the developing world.},

   abstract = {OBJECTIVE: To characterize the energy and nutrient intake, and the degree of fat malabsorption in children with Alagille syndrome (AGS) and to examine their cross-sectional associations with growth and nutritional status. METHODS: Prepubertal children with AGS were evaluated for dietary intake, growth, bone age, and body composition. Children and their families collected a three-day, weighed diet record at home. Stools were collected for 72 hours and the coefficient of fat absorption (COA) was determined. RESULTS: Children (mean age 6.7 +/- 3.6 years) with AGS (n = 26) had low height-for-age z-scores (HAZ), weight-for-age z-scores (WAZ) (-1.9 +/- 1.3 and -1.7 +/- 1.1, respectively), and delayed skeletal maturation (-1.4 +/- 1.8 years). Fifty-eight percent of the subjects were less than the 5th percentile for height and 54% were less than the 5th percentile for weight. At least 20% of children with AGS had low dietary intake for several nutrients including: calories, fat, calcium, vitamin D, and vitamin E. Children who consumed <2/3 Dietary Reference Intake (DRI) for calcium (n = 6) had a statistically significantly lower HAZ (-3.2 +/- 1.3) than those who consumed >2/3 DRI (-1.5 +/- 1.0), (P < 0.003). Ninety-six percent of the subjects had steatorrhea with a mean COA of 75 +/- 16%. CONCLUSIONS: These data suggest that prepubertal children with AGS are at-risk for poor nutrient intake which, compounded with steatorrhea, may have a negative effect on growth and nutritional status. Intervention studies to increase energy and nutrient intake are needed to determine the effect of improved dietary intake on growth and nutritional status of children with AGS.},

The aim of the study was the evaluation of individual sensitivity to small doses of gluten in the group of 60 patients aged 2.65 to 17.92 (mean age 7.49) treated with gluten-free diet for at least 12 months due to coeliac disease diagnosed according to ESPGAN criteria (food allergy to gluten excluded). Gluten challenge with dose of 10 mg/kg body mass/day was controlled with serological tests (IgAEmA, IgAAGA, and IgGAGA antibodies) carried out every 3 to 6 months. Jejunal biopsy was performed before gluten challenge (normal mucosa), and after positive EmA/AGA antibodies tests to confirm diagnosis (flat mucosa). After 35 months of observation 53.7% of all patients presented of jejunal villious atrophy, and positive IgAEmA. In this group 3.7% presented symptoms after 3 months of gluten challenge, 5.5% after 6 months, 3.7% after 9 months, and 3.7% after 12 months. In some coeliac patients ingestion of small amounts of gluten (10 mg/kg/day) can lead to small intestinal villious atrophy.},

   abstract = {UNLABELLED: Magnesium (Mg) deficiency is often noted in patients with coeliac disease (CD). The aim of the study was the analysis of the reasons of this deficiency in children with CD, diagnosed according to ESPGAN criteria. MATERIAL: The study was performed on 41 patients aged 6-18 years adhering to strict gluten-free diet GFD(+) for mean 11 years, with normal small intestine mucosa, and IgAEmA(-), and on 32 patients aged 5-17 years on gluten containing diet, with classical CD, silent CD or after gluten challenge--GFD(-). In this group the villous atrophy of the small intestine and IgAEmA(+) were observed. In 18 of these patients Mg deficiency was found using Mg-loading test (30 mmol/1.73 m2). METHODS: The following parameters were analysed: type of the disease, observance of gluten-free diet, sex, and living place. Mg, Ca, Na, protein, fat, and dietary fiber intake was assessed using food frequency questionnaire method, and steatorrhea using faecal fat excretion (g/24 h). RESULTS: The frequency of Mg deficiency was similar in both sexes, occasionally in children from small towns (4.5%), and more often in children from big cities (31.5%), and village (34.4%). Dietary Mg intake below RDA was observed in 23% of children from GFD(+) group, in 19% from GFD(-) one, and in 17.6% in children with Mg deficiency. Insufficient Mg intake was found in 18.2% of children from small towns, in 17.6% from big cities, and in 12.5% from villages; Ca in 36.6%, 58.8%, and 59.3%, and protein in 18.2%, 35.3%, and in 34.4% respectively. In all groups of children high intake of fat and Na was observed. Dietary fiber intake was within the recommended values. All children with classical CD had increased fat excretion (mean 25.9 g/24 h), in other patients it was within normal values [GFD(+) mean 1.95 g/24 h, in GFD(-) without diarrhoea 1.7 g/24 h. CONCLUSIONS: Magnesium deficiency in children with CD depends on the form of the disease, adhering to GFD, diarrhoea with steatorrhea, and/or low Mg intake with the diet.},

   abstract = {BACKGROUND: Coeliac disease (CD) is caused by a T helper cell type 1 (Th1) response in the small intestinal mucosa to dietary gluten. Paradoxically, interleukin (IL)-12, the major Th1 inducing factor, is undetectable in the mucosa of active CD. IL-18 is a recently described cytokine capable of promoting T cell interferon (IFN)-gamma production and facilitating Th1 cell polarisation. AIM: To examine expression of IL-18 and IL-18-associated Th1 proteins in CD. METHODS: IL-18 and IFN-gamma RNA transcripts were determined by quantitative reverse transcriptase-polymerase chain reaction (RT-PCR). IL-18 and caspase-1 protein expression were assessed by western blotting. Caspase-1 activity was determined using a commercially available assay. RNA transcripts for the IL-18 receptor subunits, IL-1 receptor related protein (IL-1 Rrp) and accessory protein-like subunit (AcPL), and IL-18 induced Th1 specific T box transcription factor (T-bet) were measured by RT-PCR and Southern blotting. RESULTS: IL-18 RNA transcripts were found in all mucosal samples analysed, with no difference between CD patients and controls. By western blot analysis, a large protein of approximately 24 kDa, corresponding to the immature IL-18, was detected in all mucosal samples from CD patients and controls. In contrast, mature IL-18 was only seen in CD patients. Immunoreactivity corresponding to both immature and mature caspase-1 was present in both CD and control samples. Tissue homogenates from CD patients and controls expressed similar levels of caspase-1 activity. IL-1Rrp and AcPL were seen in all samples but were expressed at greater levels in the mucosa of CD patients. T-bet was also upregulated in CD. CONCLUSIONS: Active IL-18 is expressed in CD as well as other markers of Th1 polarisation.},

   abstract = {Among the numerous forms of chemical degradation of peptides or proteins, deamidation is one of the alterations observed most frequently. In this irreversible reaction, a glutamine or an asparagine side chain is hydrolyzed to glutamic acid or aspartic acid, respectively (conversion of NH2 to OH). Besides its influence in the deterioration of biotechnological and food products, deamidation represents a defined posttranslational modification reaction with respect to proteomics. Here mass spectrometric techniques play a leading role in determining posttranslational modifications. However, not all mass spectrometers are able to resolve signal differences of 0.0193 Da (mass difference of 12CO vs 13CNH) for singly charged molecules, the mass difference between the first isotopic signal of an asparagine/glutamine-containing peptide and the monoisotopic signal of the corresponding partially deamidated aspartate/glutamate derivative. To detect partial deamidation within peptides, advantage has been taken of the ability of Fourier transform ion cyclotron resonance mass spectrometry to perform very high mass resolution. In this work, we investigated up to triply charged ions produced by electrospray ionization using direct infusion. Although the special heterodyne detection mode enables higher mass resolution than the routinely used broadband detection, often only a small mass window can be investigated. Using broadband detection, we were able to resolve ions with a difference of m/z 0.0064 to detect partially deamidated peptides formed either enzymatically or under acidic and basic conditions.},

METHODS: One hundred ninety samples were analyzed: 108 homemade foods prepared in homes of patients with celiac disease, 81 processed products, and 1 positive control of homemade food. All samples were analyzed by EIA based on monoclonal antibodies to heat stable omega-gliadins and related prolamins from wheat, rye, and barley. Samples were also analyzed using the WB technique. RESULTS: Only one (0.9%) of 108 homemade foods contained detectable amounts of gliadin, as determined by EIA. Twelve of 81 processed products contained gliadin by EIA, as follows: 5 of 61 without gluten listed in the ingredients, 2 of 11 malt extracts, 1 of 2 wheat starches, 1 of 2 types of beer, and all 3 positive control products. Gliadin content of these products was between 4 and 10 mg of gliadin/100 g of product, except for the wheat starch sample (28 mg of gliadin/100 g) and all 3 samples with gluten (>4000 mg of gliadin/100 g). The positive control of homemade food contained 152 mg of gliadin/100 g. One hundred three of 190 samples were analyzed by WB, and 21 of these were gliadin positive. A comparison of results obtained by EIA and WB showed no statistical differences between the methods. CONCLUSIONS: The greater part of the foods prepared in homes of patients with celiac disease and most processed products supposed to be gluten-free did not contain gliadin. Therefore, celiac patients adequately prepare gluten-free homemade food and have the expertise to purchase processed gluten-free food in Sao Paulo, Brazil.},

   abstract = {Celiac Sprue, a widely prevalent autoimmune disease of the small intestine, is induced in genetically susceptible individuals by exposure to dietary gluten. A 33-mer peptide was identified that has several characteristics suggesting it is the primary initiator of the inflammatory response to gluten in Celiac Sprue patients. In vitro and in vivo studies in rats and humans demonstrated that it is stable toward breakdown by all gastric, pancreatic, and intestinal brush-border membrane proteases. The peptide reacted with tissue transglutaminase, the major autoantigen in Celiac Sprue, with substantially greater selectivity than known natural substrates of this extracellular enzyme. It was a potent inducer of gut-derived human T cell lines from 14 of 14 Celiac Sprue patients. Homologs of this peptide were found in all food grains that are toxic to Celiac Sprue patients but are absent from all nontoxic food grains. The peptide could be detoxified in in vitro and in vivo assays by exposure to a bacterial prolyl endopeptidase, suggesting a strategy for oral peptidase supplement therapy for Celiac Sprue.},

   abstract = {BACKGROUND: Deamidation of distinct glutamines in HLA-DQ2 restricted gliadin epitopes, considered critical in the pathogenesis of coeliac disease (CD), can be mediated by tissue transglutaminase (tTG). To elucidate the possible role of other transglutaminases in CD we investigated whether different mammalian, microbial and vegetable transglutaminases can use gliadin as substrate. METHODS: Studies in which small amounts of transglutaminase have been measured have led to our modifying a microtitre plate assay. We used proteolytically digested gliadin as solid phase substrate and Europium-labelled streptavidine to quantify the biotinylated product covalently linked by the enzyme to the plate. RESULTS: The modified assay is ultrasensitive and quantitative, measuring guinea pig liver transglutaminase concentrations between 0.5 and 50 ng/well. The specific activities of the enzymes (counts/min/mg) against gliadin and N,N-dimethylcasein, respectively, are: tTG 9800/4900, Factor XIII 97330/55620, epidermal transglutaminase 47650/50770, streptoverticillium transglutaminase 4290/2200, phytophora cactorum transglutaminase 6910/4110. For the first time, we have detected transglutaminase activity in bean sprouts, spinach leaves and green peas, which are commonly used Vegetables. CONCLUSION: Gliadin is a good substrate for endogenous, microbial and plant transglutaminases. An interesting altemative is that gliadins are deamidated by microbial or food transglutaminases in the intestinal lumen. The assay described provides an ultrasensitive method for measuring small amounts of transglutaminase and is considered a helpful tool in further studies of the possible role of transglutaminases in the pathogenesis of CD.},

As an observer organization to the Codex Alimentarius Commission, the group summarizes current data on analysis and effects of gluten in coeliac disease. All types of gliadin, the ethanol-soluble fraction of gluten, contain the coeliac-active factor. However, coeliac toxicity and immunogenicity (humoral and cellular) of various prolamins are not identical in coeliac patients. There are no conclusive data on the threshold of gluten sensitivity of coeliac patients. Information as to the long-term risk to coeliac patients exposed to small doses of gliadin is lacking. Therefore, every effort should be made to keep the diet of coeliac patients as gluten-free as possible. The prolamin group is currently evaluating a new enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay (ELISA) protocol for gluten analysis that could serve as a basis for further Codex regulations. The group recommends adherence to a single Codex limit for gluten-free foods. The current limit of 200 ppm gluten is questionable and requires reconsideration based on new information that will be available soon.},

Per capita consumer exposure to most of these food ingredients is rather low with a few notable exceptions such as sugar and starch. Some food ingredients including edible oils, hydrolyzed proteins, lecithin, starch, lactose, flavors and gelatin may, at least in some products, be derived from sources commonly involved in IgE-mediated food allergies. These ingredients should be avoided by consumers with allergies to the source material if the ingredient contains detectable protein residues. Other food ingredients, including starch, malt, alcohol and vinegar, may be derived in some cases from wheat, rye or barley, the grains that are implicated in the causation of celiac disease. If these ingredients contain gluten residues, then they should be avoided by celiac sufferers. A few food ingredients are capable of eliciting allergic sensitization, although these ingredients would be classified as rarely allergenic. These ingredients include carmine, cochineal extract, annatto, tragacanth gum and papain. Food manufacturers should declare the presence of allergenic food ingredients in the ingredient listings on product labels so that allergic consumers can know to avoid these potentially hazardous products.},

   abstract = {Individuals with celiac disease generally are advised to follow a lifelong gluten-free diet and avoid consumption of the prolamins gliadin (wheat), secalin (rye), and hordein (barley). Although the designation of the diet as glutenfree may imply that the diet contains zero gluten, this is not necessarily true. In some countries (eg, United States, Canada), the gluten-free diet is completely devoid of gluten and is based on foods such as rice and corn that are naturally gluten free. In others (eg, Scandinavia, United Kingdom), the gluten-free diet may include foods such as wheat starch that have been rendered gluten free but nonetheless contain small amounts of toxic prolamins. The discrepancy in the use of foods rendered gluten free exists because the amount of toxic prolamins that individuals with celiac disease may consume without damaging the mucosa of the small intestine is unknown. Minimal research has been conducted on the toxicity of foods rendered gluten free, and there are no definitive data about whether the small amount of prolamin found in these products is safe to consume. Nonetheless, the Codex Alimentarius Standard for gluten-free foods allows a certain amount of prolamin in foods designated gluten free, and these products have been used in many countries for several decades. Well-designed, scientifically sound studies are needed to help determine the amount of toxic prolamins, if any, that may be safely consumed by individuals with celiac disease. Until this research is conducted, dietitians in the United States should continue to advise their patients against the use of wheat starch and other foods rendered gluten free.},

   abstract = {BACKGROUND/AIMS: This article describes the surgical techniques and postoperative status for proximal gastrectomy reconstructed by interposition of a jejunal J pouch with preservation of the vagal nerve and lower esophageal sphincter. METHODOLOGY: We have performed a new technique for reducing postgastrectomy sequelae such as reflux esophagitis, early dumping syndrome, and microgastria in early gastric cancer located in the proximal third of the stomach. The technique consists of proximal gastrectomy with preservation of the hepatic, pyloric, celiac branch of the vagal nerve, and abdominal esophagus (lower esophageal sphincter), and reconstruction by interposition of a jejunal J pouch. To reserve pyloric function, pyloroplasty can be omitted by preservation of the pyloric branch from the vagal nerve. To restore loss of reservoir function, the reconstruction is performed with an interposed jejunal J pouch. Sacrifice of the mesenteric arcades is kept to a minimum to preserve the autonomic nerve and blood flow in the mesentery. RESULTS: All of the patients who underwent this operation were able to eat an adequate amount of food at 6 months after surgery and they were satisfied with their postoperative status. And that, we have not experienced postgastrectomy disorders such the dumping syndrome and reflux esophagitis. CONCLUSIONS: Therefore, this method is useful for preventing the postoperative disorders in patients with early gastric cancer located in the proximal third of the stomach.},

   abstract = {Nearly total gastrectomy preserving the vagal nerve, the lower esophageal sphincter (LES), and the pyloric sphincter was developed as a function-preserving surgical technique to improve postgastrectomy disorders. In this paper, application criteria and technique are outlined, and postoperative quality of life was clinically investigated. Ten subjects who underwent this surgical operation (group A: 7 male and 3 female subjects at age 48 to 68 years with a mean age of 58.3 years) were interviewed to inquire about reflux esophagitis, dumping syndrome, and microgastria. Group A was compared with 20 cases of conventional total gastrectomy with D2 lymphadenectomy, excision of the lower esophageal sphincter (LES), total vagotomy, and single jejunal interposition (group B: 16 male and 4 female subjects at age 48 to 72 years with a mean age of 63.9 years). Included were cases with early cancer (M or SM1 of N0) localizing at the middle third and lower stomach, which was not applicable to endoscopic excision of gastric mucosa or partial gastric excision in M cancer, 2 cm or farther from the margin of the cancer to the esophagogastric mucosa cephalad junction and 3.5 cm or farther from the margin of the cancer to the pyloric caudad sphincter; in SM1 cancer, 4 cm or farther from the oral-side margin of the cancer to esophagogastric mucosa junction and 5.5 cm or farther from the anal-side margin of the cancer to the pyloric sphincter. In excision with lymph nodes, hepatic and celiac branches bifurcating from anterior and posterior trunks of the vagal nerve were preserved. To preserve LES, the esophagus was severed at the His angle at right angle to the longitudinal axis of the esophagus. The antrum was severed at 1.5 cm from the pyloric sphincter, preserving the arteria supraduodenalis. An alternative gaster was created as a 15-cm jejunal pouch with a 5-cm jejunal conduit for orthodromic peristaltic movement, using an automatic suture instrument to complete side-to-side anastomosis of folded jejunum with 1- to 1.5-cm long upper end of the pouch not anastomosed. The abdominal esophagus was mechanically anastomosed with a jejunal J pouch, and anastomosis of the pyloric antrum with a jejunal conduit was manually completed by stratum anastomosis. In group A, food ingestion per time could be taken the same as that of a healthy person, with no reflux esophagitis and dumping syndrome being noticed. Reflux esophagitis developed more significantly in group B than in group A (p < 0.05). In food ingestion per time, group B was significantly delayed compared with group A (p < 0.05). The present results suggested that the surgical technique proposed is a function-preserving gastric surgery appropriate to prevent postgastrectomy disorder of subjects.},

In the present study, we have evaluated the immune response to local gliadin challenge in the nasal mucosa of coeliac patients preliminary to exploring the feasibility of immune modulation by the nasal route. The local response to gliadin was evaluated on non-invasive scrapings of nasal mucosa. Cells harvested from the nasal scrapings of 21 coeliac patients and 12 healthy controls were counted after immunohistochemical staining. Six hours after gliadin challenge, the total number of cells was increased in coeliacs but not in controls. The increase was due principally to lymphoid cells and granulocytes. CD3+ cells doubled after gliadin challenge, but not after albumin control challenge. There was a similar rise in CD25+ cells, whereas the number of ICAM-expressing cells did not increase significantly. In control subjects, both gliadin and albumin induced a moderate but not significant increase in total cell number. In conclusion, the gliadin antigen provokes a mild inflammatory response in coeliac nasal mucosa.},

   abstract = {OBJECTIVE: To investigate the humoral and cellular immune response against cow's milk proteins in Behcet's disease and to distinguish any behaviour during active or inactive disease. METHODS: Peripheral blood mononuclear cells from 16 patients and from eight normal controls were cultured in the presence of phytohaemagglutinin (PHA), beta-casein, beta-lactoglobulin, or chicken egg albumin. Interferon gamma (IFNgamma) and interleukin 4 (IL4) were measured in the culture supernatants by enzyme linked immunosorbent assay (ELISA). Serum samples from 46 patients with Behcet's disease and from 37 healthy subjects were also studied for antibody detection. Antibodies to beta-casein, beta-lactoglobulin, and chicken egg albumin were determined by ELISA. RESULTS: High IFNgamma but not IL4 levels were found in the supernatants of lymphocytes from patients with active disease cultured in the presence of cow's milk proteins. Levels were comparable with those obtained in cultures stimulated with PHA. A significantly higher level of anti-beta-casein and anti-beta-lactoglobulin IgG and IgA antibodies was found in patients with active Behcet's disease. No relation was found between their occurrence and the age of the patients, the duration of disease, or the presence of gastrointestinal abnormalities. Antibodies to chicken albumin were detected at low levels and with a prevalence similar to that of healthy subjects. CONCLUSION: The results indicate that an active immune response occurs in Behcet's disease. This response involves an increased frequency of antibodies to cow's milk protein and a strong Th1 polarisation after exposure to these antigens. The occurrence of these abnormalities supports a putative role for cow's milk proteins immune response in the pathogenesis of Behcet's disease.},

   abstract = {Celiac disease, induced by dietary gluten, is characterized by mucosal atrophy and local inflammation associated with cell infiltration and activation. Unlike other food proteins, gluten and its proteolytic fragments, besides inducing a specific immune response, were shown to activate components of innate immunity and cause, e.g., direct stimulation of TNF-alpha and IL-10 and a significant rise in NO production by peritoneal macrophages. The identity of the active fragments was established by separating the peptic digest of gliadin by RP-HPLC chromatography. The purest fraction with the highest activity was analyzed by mass spectrometry, and the gliadin peptide sequence was identified as VSFQQPQQQYPSSQ. This peptide (T) and its N- and C-terminally shortened forms (A, B, C and D, E, F) were synthesized. Peptide B (FQQPQQQYPSSQ) elicited the highest TNF-alpha, IL-10, and RANTES secretion and increase in IFN-gamma-primed NO production by mouse macrophages. In contrast, C-terminally shortened peptides had a lower ability to stimulate macrophages than the native form.},

   abstract = {OBJECTIVE: Splanchnic arterial occlusive disease is rare in childhood. The purpose of this study was to review the clinical relevance and operative treatment of these lesions in a unique experience from a single institution. METHODS: Seventeen children (11 boys and 6 girls) from 2 years to 17 years in age with critical narrowings of the celiac artery (CA) and superior mesenteric artery (SMA) underwent treatment at the University of Michigan from 1974 to 2000. Etiologic factors included embryologic fusion abnormalities of the fetal aortae during formation of the splanchnic arteries (n = 15), inflammatory aortoarteritis (n = 1), and radiation-induced arterial fibrosis (n = 1). Individual lesions included CA occlusions (n = 6) and stenoses (n = 7), SMA occlusions (n = 3) and stenoses (n = 11), and inferior mesenteric artery stenosis (n = 1). Fourteen children had abdominal aortic coarctations, and 15 had renal artery stenoses. Two patients had postprandial abdominal discomfort and food aversion, consistent with intestinal angina. Small stature affected five others, perhaps attributable to severe renovascular hypertension and failure to thrive. Ten children underwent intestinal revascularization, at the time of an aortoplasty or thoracoabdominal bypass for aortic coarctation (n = 7) or at the time of renal artery revascularization (n = 8). Primary splanchnic revascularization procedures included SMA-aortic implantation (n = 3), aorto-SMA and CA bypass with an internal iliac artery graft (n = 3) or a saphenous vein graft (n = 1), CA-aortic implantation at a stenotic SMA origin (n = 2), and CA and SMA intimectomy (n = 1). Secondary operations included SMA-aortic implantation (n = 2). RESULTS: All 10 children who underwent splanchnic revascularization have thrived, gained weight, and are free of abdominal pain, with follow-up periods averaging 9 years. No intestinal ischemic manifestations occurred in the seven children who did not undergo operation. CONCLUSION: Pediatric splanchnic arterial occlusive disease is a rare illness appropriately treated with operation in properly selected children.},

   abstract = {Celiac disease is caused by a selective lack of T cell tolerance for gluten. It is known that the enzyme tissue transglutaminase (tTG) is involved in the generation of T cell stimulatory gluten peptides through deamidation of glutamine, the most abundant amino acid in gluten. Only particular glutamine residues, however, are modified by tTG. Here we provide evidence that the spacing between glutamine and proline, the second most abundant amino acid in gluten, plays an essential role in the specificity of deamidation. On the basis of this, algorithms were designed and used to successfully predict novel T cell stimulatory peptides in gluten. Strikingly, these algorithms identified many similar peptides in the gluten-like hordeins from barley and secalins from rye but not in the avenins from oats. The avenins contain significantly lower percentages of proline residues, which offers a likely explanation for the lack of toxicity of oats. Thus, the unique amino acid composition of gluten and related proteins in barley and rye favors the generation of toxic T cell stimulatory gluten peptides by tTG. This provides a rationale for the observation that celiac disease patients are intolerant to these cereal proteins but not to other common food proteins.},

   abstract = {The mucosal immune system is an integral part of the whole-body immune system, however its regulation, maturation and function are to a great degree independent. Mucosal lymphoid tissue is the largest immune organ of the body, that stands in the first line of defence against foreign invaders. The goal of the immune system is immunity, however immunologic unresponsiveness (tolerance) is a key feature of the mucosal immune system, because the organism must tolerate thousands of ingested and inhaled harmless food and bacterial antigens. The phenomenon of oral tolerance is the unique feature of the mucosal immune system. If abrogated, severe autoimmune diseases like Crohn's disease, ulcerative colitis or coeliac sprue can develop. The quality of mucosal immune responses during newborn and infant age strongly influences the immune reactivity later in life. The most important factors influencing the development of mucosal immune reactivity are the feeding practices and microbial colonization. Manipulation of the mucosal immune system offers interesting possibilities to prevent infection as well as autoimmune diseases directly in the affected tissue, without participation of the whole-body immune system. In this review we present the most recent basic information about the mechanisms of mucosal immunity, ontogeny of mucosal immunity, mucosal tolerance and immunisation and the role of mucosal immunity in an inherited disease in which the main battlefield is the lung mucosa-cystic fibrosis.},

   abstract = {AIMS: Gluten ingestion in coeliac disease is associated with alterations of the intestinal mucosa, especially the expansion of the lamina propria. Antiendomysium and antireticulin antibodies may result from interactions between gliadin and extracellular matrix components. By behaving as autoantigens, connective tissue proteins could initiate mucosal damage. This study evaluates changes in the distribution of laminin, type IV collagen, and fibronectin in the mucosa of patients with coeliac disease in an attempt to explain the alterations of mucosal morphology. METHODS: Intestinal biopsies were obtained from patients with coeliac disease on admission and while on a gluten free diet. The distribution of type IV collagen, laminin, fibronectin, and alpha-smooth muscle actin was evaluated by immunofluorescence and by immunogold labelling and electron microscopy. RESULTS: In patients with coeliac disease, the intensity of type IV collagen, laminin, and fibronectin immunofluorescent staining was decreased and less well defined than in controls, with frequent breaches in the basement membrane; fibronectin staining was weak in the distal third of the elongated crypts and absent under the flat surface. The distribution of smooth muscle fibre in the distal lamina propria of flat mucosae was altered. The distribution of these proteins was normal as assessed by immunoelectron microscopy. CONCLUSIONS: The intensity of staining of some components of the basement membrane is decreased in coeliac disease and the distribution of smooth muscle fibres is altered. These changes may result from interactions between gliadin and components of the extracellular matrix and may play a role in the genesis of mucosal lesions and in the damage to the epithelium.},

   abstract = {BACKGROUND: Exocrine pancreatic insufficiency is a common problem in persons with cystic fibrosis causing malabsorption and poor growth. The 72-hour fecal fat study is the best qualitative measure of fat malabsorption used in clinical practice. This test has several drawbacks, which include cost and logistics. The steatocrit has been proposed as a rapid method to assess fat malabsorption. OBJECTIVES: The objective of this study was to determine whether the steatocrit is an accurate estimation of fat malabsorption in persons with cystic fibrosis. METHODS: Forty-nine stool samples for steatocrit processing were obtained from 72-hour fecal fat collections performed on twenty-seven persons with cystic fibrosis. Stools were weighed and homogenized with sand and water. The emulsified specimen was pipetted into heparinized capillary tubes and centrifuged for 15 minutes. The length of the fatty layer was compared to the length of the solid layer plus the fatty layer in each tube to determine the steatocrit value. Four steatocrit mixtures were evaluated: (1) standard steatocrit, (2) dilute steatocrit, (3) acid steatocrit, (4) dilute acid steatocrit. Steatocrit values were compared with the coefficient of fat absorption determined from the 72-hour fecal fat collection. RESULTS: The correlation coefficient of the steatocrit and the coefficient of fat absorption ranged from -.045 to -.491. Only the coefficient of fat absorption and the acid steatocrit had a significant correlation ( = 0.033). CONCLUSION: The steatocrit is an imprecise measure of fat absorption and not clinically useful in estimating steatorrhea.},

   abstract = {The distal gut hormone peptide YY (PYY) mediates feedback inhibition of gastric acid secretion, gastrointestinal motility, and pancreatic enzyme output. To investigate the influence of maldigestion on PYY, we determined plasma PYY levels in patients with celiac disease under basal conditions and in response to intraduodenal fat. Basal PYY was increased in untreated celiac patients (N = 13) compared to patients on a gluten free diet (N = 9) [15.6 (11.8-27.0) pM vs 12.2 (10.1-13.1) pM; P < 0.05] and compared to control subjects (N = 15) [9.5 (8.3-10.4) pM; P < 0.001]. Integrated PYY in response to intraduodenally infused predigested fat (1071+/-293 pM 80 min) was significantly (P < 0.05) greater than in response to undigested fat (322+/-223 pM 80 min) in six untreated celiacs. Plasma concentrations of PYY and cholecystokinin were strongly correlated (r = 0.79; P < 0.001). We conclude that basal PYY levels in untreated celiac disease are elevated, that predigestion of fat enhances PYY release in these patients, and that PYY secretion is correlated with CCK release.},

   abstract = {BACKGROUND: Fecal elastase-1 (E1) is a sensitive and reliable test in the assessment of exocrine pancreatic function in cystic fibrosis (CF). In patients with celiac disease (CD), different E1 values have been reported. E1 levels in other malabsorption conditions are unknown. Therefore, the aim of the present study was to evaluate E1 concentrations in various malabsorption syndromes. MATERIAL AND METHODS: The study was carried out in 54 patients, selected from patients referred with suspicion of CF, who had been diagnosed as celiac disease (CD; n = 16), secondary malabsorption syndrome (SMS, giardiasis- or cow milk-related enteropathy; n = 18) and food allergy (FA; n = 20). 70 age-matched healthy children (HC) and 131 cystic fibrosis (CF) patients served as control groups. In CD and SMS patients, a gluten-free diet was introduced. In addition, SMS patients were treated appropriately to underlying disease. In all subjects, E1 concentrations were measured. In CD and SMS patients, E1 concentrations were repeatedly measured after one year of the treatment. RESULTS: With a cut-off level of 200 microg g-1, abnormal E1 concentrations were found in 87.2% of the CF group and in 56.2% and 50.0% of the CD and SMS subgroups, respectively. In none of FA patients, were E1 values below the normal range. After mucosal recovery, E1 concentrations in patients with CD and SMS increased, suggesting that villous atrophy can diminish exocrine pancreatic secretion. In 18 out of 19 CD and SMS patients with abnormal E1 concentrations, monitored for at least 12 months of a gluten-free diet, abnormal E1 concentrations increased above the cut-off value to normal range. Two out of the 54 referred patients were finally diagnosed as having CF, one with stable low E1 levels and the second with finally normal values. CONCLUSIONS: The exocrine pancreatic function is decreased in villous atrophy regardless of underlying disease. The specificity of the fecal elastase-1 test in the differentiation between 'primary' exocrine pancreatic insufficiency and intestinal malabsorption with mucosal atrophy is low. After mucosal regeneration, fecal elastase-1 specificity is high.},

   abstract = {Clinically, celiac disease has always been regarded as a wasting, malabsorptive disorder due to disease of the small intestinal mucosa. It has been difficult for clinicians to recognize that this condition is primarily due to sensitization of mesenteric T lymphocytes to wheat protein (gluten) in genetically predisposed (DQ2+) individuals. On contact with dietary-derived gluten in the upper intestine, these sensitized T lymphocytes are activated leading to inflammation of and morphologically altered mucosal architecture: the latter reverts to normal with a gluten-free diet. The circulation of sensitized T lymphocytes to other parts of the intestinal mucosa explains why identical immunopathological inflammation can be induced in ileal and rectal mucosa. It appears, then, that in predisposed DQ2+ subjects, mesenteric T lymphocytes recognize gluten as foreign (non-self) antigen, thereby inducing mucosal pathology secondary to the initiating lymphocyte-protein interaction, analogously to the mucosal lesions that typify graft-vs-host reactions, or nematode or Giaraia infestations. Today, as this article describes, we recognize that celiac disease often exists in a subclinical, or "compensated-latent," form, or with symptoms that do not immediately suggest an origin in the gastrointestinal tract.},

   abstract = {BACKGROUND: In normal conditions human gut mucosa is infiltrated with a large number of mononuclear cells due to continuous stimulation by luminal antigens. This state of "physiological" inflammation is tightly controlled, as several mucosal cells interact to maintain an appropriate local immune response. Moreover, gut-associated lymphoid tissue must constantly distinguish harmless antigens that are present in food and on commensal bacteria from pathogenic microbes. INTERVENTIONS AND RESEARCH: The oral administration of soluble protein antigens induces a state of systemic immunological unresponsiveness specific to the fed protein, termed oral tolerance. The two major mechanisms to explain oral tolerance are anergy/deletion of autoreactive lymphocytes and active suppression. Changes in the pathways of immune activation are detected in chronic intestinal inflammation, such as inflammatory bowel disease or celiac disease. CONCLUSION: An appreciation of the current knowledge of the gut immune system is of importance for understanding and development of new treatment modalities in chronic intestinal inflammation.},

   abstract = {Effects of a chicken essence and one of its components, L-carnosine, on the hyperglycemia caused by intracranial injection of 2-deoxy-D-glucose (2DG-hyperglycemia) in unanesthetized rats were examined. The chicken essence inhibited the 2DG-hyperglycemia. Central or peripheral administration of specific doses of L-carnosine reduced the 2DG-hyperglycemia. L-carnosine inhibited neural activities of sympathetic efferent nerves innervating the adrenal gland and liver and facilitated the activity of vagal celiac nerve innervating the pancreas in urethane anesthetized rats. Specific doses of histamine also suppressed the 2DG-hyperglycemia, and thioperamide eliminated the inhibiting actions of both histamine and L-carnosine on the 2DG-hyperglycemia. Considering mammalian muscles contain L-carnosine, these facts suggest a possibility that L-carnosine might be an endogenous control factor of the blood glucose level through autonomic nerves via H3-receptor.},
