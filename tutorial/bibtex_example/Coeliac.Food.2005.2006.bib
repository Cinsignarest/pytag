   abstract = {BACKGROUND: Antibodies present in coeliac disease may occur in IgA-nephropathy. This raises the question of food intolerance in the disease. Evidence for a true correlation between the two disorders has however been scarce. DESIGN: Sera from 89 patients with IgA-nephropathy and 13 other patients with IgA deposits in the glomeruli of kidney biopsies were analysed for IgA-antibodies to gliadin, endomysium and tissue transglutaminase (92/102 patients). RESULTS: Eleven out of 89 (12.4%) of the patients with IgA-nephropathy and five of the 13 others (38%) had elevated titres of IgA-antibodies to gliadin but, in all cases but one, normal IgA-antibodies to endomysium. Patients with IgA-nephropathy and elevated IgA-antibodies to gliadin had elevated total serum IgA more frequently than patients who had not (p<0.01). Two patients with IgA-nephropathy and one with Hennoch Schonlein's purpura had elevated IgA-antibodies to tissue transglutaminase. Small bowel biopsy in 7 out of 11 IgA-antibodies to gliadin positive patients with IgA-nephropathy was pathologic in three cases (two with Marsh I) . One patient with chronic glomerulnephritis also had Marsh I. CONCLUSIONS: We found no increased frequency of verified coeliac disease in 89 patients with IgA-nephropathy. Two patients with IgA-nephropathy and one patient with chronic glomerulonephritis with IgA deposits in the kidney biopsy had a Marsh I histopathology. The findings suggest a possible link of celiac disease to IgA-nephropathy and a role for antibodies to food antigens in this disorder.},

   abstract = {Tissue transglutaminase (tTG or TG2; E.C. 2.3.2.13) belongs to the transglutaminase family, a group of closely related enzymes that share the ability to catalyze the cross-linking of a glutaminyl residue of a protein/peptide substrate to a lysyl residue of a protein/peptide co-substrate. tTG is a multifunctional enzyme since it is also capable of catalyzing other biochemical reactions. The distribution and physiological roles of tTG have been widely studied in numerous cell types and tissues, but only recently its role in human diseases has started to be clarified. For example, transglutaminase activity has been hypothesized to be involved in the pathogenetic mechanisms responsible for several human diseases, including neurodegenerative diseases, such as polyglutamine diseases hitherto identified. Among human diseases, a large and recent series of studies have clearly shown that the activity of the tTG is critical for a very diffuse human pathology known as Celiac Disease. This disease is due to intolerance to a food component, gliadin, and is characterized by a very complex clinical syndrome, including gastrointestinal pathological manifestations, often associated with extra-intestinal manifestations. Interestingly, a subset of celiac patients also develops certain neurological disorders. In this review we describe the roles played by tTG in the molecular mechanisms responsible for pathophysiology of Celiac Disease.},

   abstract = {INTRODUCTION: Gluten ataxia refers to the association of idiopathic ataxia despite exhaustive investigations with gluten sensitivity defined by anti-gliadin antibodies (AGA) presence in blood. This is a controversial concept. PATIENTS AND METHODS: We screened 33 patients, who were hospitalized in 2003 and had subacute or chronic ataxia for presence of circulating AGA. Twelve patients were positive and their clinical and biological features were studied. RESULTS: Among the twelve patients, we concluded that gluten ataxia was present in only eight, including one case of celiac disease. Among these eight patients, five had the usual features of gluten ataxia (progressive cerebellar ataxia affecting mainly lower limbs), but one patient presented unusual left cerebellar hemisyndrome and the two others displayed polyneuropathy with proprioceptive ataxia. Cerebellar atrophy was confirmed with magnetic resonance imaging in five cases and association with other antibodies was found in six cases. Among the four other patients positive for AGA, investigations revealed one case of multiple sclerosis, one case of late-onset Friedreich ataxia, one case of basilar tuberculous meningitis and one case of type 2 diabetes. CONCLUSION: Screening for AGA presence should be systematically performed at presentation of patients with unknown etiology ataxia; in the event AGA are present without any other etiology, treatment with gluten-free diet must be discussed. However, the responsibility of AGA in the pathogenesis of neurological signs is highly debatable and further experimental work is required. Two pathophysiological hypotheses are suggested: (1) overexpression of cerebellar epitopes, in case of primary cerebellar pathology, leading to excessive immune response directed against these epitopes; and (2) molecular mimicry with cross-reactivity of antigens usually directed against gliadin, but also recognizing Purkinje cells epitopes.},

The recognition of atypical clinical presentations by active screening of high risk groups is a successful global initiative. In Chile there is little awareness of the enormous changes occurred in this field. Available national information on typical presentation of the disease shows that it is found in 1:1836 live births, figure that is comparable to European societies. Two urgent tasks are required in our country. First, to asses the Chilean population using EMA and/or TTG. Second, to improve the legal aspects that regulate consumer information about gluten content in processed foods. We here review the most relevant aspects to be considered to improve the management of celiac patients and the tasks that require the participation of health authorities for their implementation.},

   abstract = {BACKGROUND: Cow's milk protein sensitive enteropathy (CMSE) and celiac disease (CD) associate with upregulation of local intestinal immune responses, including activation of cytotoxic lymphocytes. OBJECTIVE: We investigated whether this upregulation can be detected at the systemic level by analyzing serum concentrations of granzymes A (GrA) and B (GrB), soluble Fas, and CD30. METHODS: Fifty-seven children with a final diagnosis of CMSE in 23 subjects (18 untreated and 5 on a diet), 20 untreated CD patients, and 14 control subjects with no gastrointestinal disease were examined by endoscopy for gastrointestinal complaints. Duodenal biopsies were studied for basic histology, CD3, alphabeta and gammadelta T-cell receptors (TCRs), and serum samples by commercial ELISA assays. RESULTS: Concentrations of GrA and GrB were significantly higher in untreated CMSE and in CD as compared with the control subjects. Measurable GrB was present in only 20% of the control subjects but in 100% of patients with CMSE. CD30 was similarly increased in both untreated CMSE and CD cases, whereas in treated CMSE cases the concentrations were equal to the control subjects. All groups showed similar soluble Fas. The numbers of duodenal CD3 + , alphabeta- and gammadelta-TCRs correlated with the serum granzyme and CD30 levels. CONCLUSION: The intestinal immune response in CMSE and CD is manifested by the increase in serum GrA, GrB, and CD30; the measurement of these markers provides a new practical and objective complementary means for diagnosis and assessment of treatment response. However, this has to be confirmed by more studies before routine use.},

   abstract = {OBJECTIVE: Pathogenetic mechanisms of cow's milk protein-sensitive enteropathy (CMSE) are poorly defined, but elevated serum granzyme levels and an increase in duodenal intraepithelial lymphocytes (IELs) expressing TIA-1 suggest the involvement of abnormal lymphocyte cytotoxicity. To evaluate cytotoxicity in CMSE we analysed the expression of cytotoxic granule components in duodenal IELs. For comparison, we studied subjects with coeliac disease (CD), in which lymphocyte cytotoxicity is pathogenically important. MATERIAL AND METHODS: Fifty-four children were examined by endoscopy for gastrointestinal complaints. Twenty-one subjects had a final diagnosis of CMSE, 15 children had untreated CD and 18 controls showed no definite gastrointestinal disease. Mucosal samples furnished from the bulb and descending duodenum were stained for CD3, perforin, granzymes A and B and TIA-1. RESULTS: In both CMSE and CD, increase of mid-duodenal TIA-1, perforin and granzyme A expressing IELs was seen, the counts in CD being much higher, and increased expression was also seen in the bulb. Granzyme B expression was increased only in CD. In CMSE, no evidence of villous atrophy was seen. CONCLUSIONS: Increase in duodenal IELs expressing cytotoxic granules is a characteristic feature in CMSE, although to a lesser degree than in CD. Cytotoxicity is suggested to be involved in the pathogenesis of intestinal dysfunction in CMSE, but based on the absence of villous abnormalities may not be mainly targeted to enterocytes. The mechanisms leading to the accumulation of these cells in CMSE need further investigation.},

   abstract = {OBJECTIVES: Enterocyte apoptosis induced by activated intraepithelial lymphocytes (IELs) is increased in celiac disease (CD). A lesser increment in intraepithelial lymphocytes associated with normal villous structure is also characteristic of cow's milk sensitive enteropathy (CMSE), but no information is available about the apoptosis rate of this condition. METHODS: Endoscopic biopsy samples of 21 children with untreated CMSE were compared with samples from 15 children with CD and 18 controls. Apoptosis was analyzed using the TUNEL technique and the M30 antibody from duodenal bulb and mid-duodenum samples. Ki-67 was used to detect the proliferation rate and CD3(+) to count the overall number of T lymphocytes. RESULTS: In the mid-duodenum, CMSE patients showed a significantly increased intraepithelial and lamina propria density of TUNEL(+) cells, but no difference in the density of M30(+) epithelial cells was seen compared with controls. In CD subjects, TUNEL(+) counts in mid-duodenal villous epithelium were increased. CD3(+) intraepithelial lymphocytes were increased in both CMSE and CD and correlated with TUNEL(+) and M30(+) counts among all patients. No increase in proliferation rate was seen in CMSE, and no significant correlations between apoptosis and proliferation rates were detected. CONCLUSIONS: The observed increase in TUNEL(+) counts and the absence of any increase in M30(+) cells suggest that the apoptosis rate of intraepithelial lymphocytes, but not of enterocytes, is increased in the small IELs in CMSE. However, the number of intraepithelial lymphocytes is still elevated in CMSE, indicating that a disturbance of homeostasis of intraepithelial lymphocytes is important in its pathogenesis.},

   abstract = {BACKGROUND: Gliadins, a family of wheat proteins, are central to the pathogenesis of celiac disease (CD). In addition to 'immunogenic' effects, gliadin directly affects cultured cells and intestine preparations, and produces damage in vivo, via a separate 'toxic' peptide, such as A-gliadin p31-43 (P31-43). AIMS: Understanding the molecular mechanisms underlying direct non T-cell mediated effects of gliadin peptides, and assessing their potential role in promoting CD. METHOD: Gliadin effects were tested on a number of cell lines and on cultured mucosa samples by evaluating cytoskeleton rearrangements, endocytosis, proliferation and apoptosis. Standard biochemical methods were used to assess prolonged epidermal growth factor receptor (EGFR) activation. RESULTS: Crude gliadin peptic-tryptic peptides (PTG], or P31-43 alone, fully reproduce the effects of epidermal growth factor (EGF] on actin cytosketon, cell cycle and cell proliferation of various cell lines. Inhibitor studies demonstrate the role of EGFR in the early response to gliadin exposure, pointing to activation of the EGFR pathway. Peptide P31-43 is not similar to any EGFR ligand, but can delay inactivation of the EGFR interfering with its endocytosis. Gliadin-induced delay of EGFR endocytosis in cultured intestinal biopsies, together with S-phase entry of epithelial intestinal cells, confirm a role for EGFR activation in CD. CONCLUSION: The ability of gliadin peptides to delay EGFR inactivation through interference with the endocytic pathway suggests a model where gliadin fragments amplify the effects of trace amounts of EGF, and possibly of other growth factors, by prolonging receptor activation. The results, using cultures of coeliac intestinal biopsies, highlight the role of the EGF pathway in establishing and maintaining the typical atrophic and proliferative alterations of the small intestine in CD.},

   abstract = {BACKGROUND: Food allergy to wheat induces different symptoms as atopic eczema/dermatitis syndrome (AEDS), urticaria and more severe reactions as wheat-dependent exercise-induced anaphylaxis (WDEIA). Different gliadin classes are involved in this allergy but IgE-binding epitopes are known only on omega5-gliadins and for WDEIA cases. OBJECTIVES: The aim of the study was to identify IgE-binding epitopes on several gliadin classes and for several patients with different symptoms and ages. METHODS: Eleven sera were analysed by pepscan with overlapping synthetic peptides. RESULTS: Sera from five patients with anaphylaxis, urticaria or WDEIA, displayed strong IgE-binding to sequential epitopes of the repetitive domains of alphabeta, gamma, omega2 or omega5-gliadins with two immunodominant epitopes on omega5-gliadin and a consensus motif of the type QQX1PX2QQ (X1 being L, F, S or I and X2 Q, E or G). One patient allergic to deamidated wheat proteins also had IgE to a repetitive peptide of gamma and omega2-gliadins of the type QPQQPFP. Sera from four patients with AEDS detected no linear epitopes on gliadins, despite the fact that they contained specific IgE to alpha, beta, gamma or omega-gliadins. One child with AEDS recognized cysteine-containing sequences in the nonrepetitive domains of alphabeta and gamma-gliadins. CONCLUSION: B epitopes in wheat allergy were different from B epitopes of coeliac disease. Differences exist in IgE-binding epitopes between patients with food allergy to wheat. IgE from those suffering from WDEIA, anaphylaxis and urticaria detected sequential epitopes in the repetitive domain of gliadins whereas IgE from AEDS patients probably recognized conformational epitopes.},

   abstract = {Food incompatibilities affect approximately 20% of the general population in Western countries. In about one quarter of the affected children and one tenth of affected adults, the incompatibility is based on an allergy, that is, on an immunologically generated incompatibility reaction. Gastrointestinal symptoms occur in a third of these cases. Food allergies are caused by IgE-dependent orIgE-independent immunologic reactions, which lead to an inflammatory reaction, in which mast cells, eosinophilic granulocytes, and other cells are involved. Both genetic and environmental causes are under consideration. New findings concerning the interaction between the innate immune system and intestinal microflora have generated innovative therapeutic concepts, including the use of probiotics to prevent food allergies. The development of recombinant allergens and varieties of allergens will improve diagnostic possibilities and bring new therapeutic options, such as hyposensitization and induction of immunologic tolerance. Food intolerances (non-immunologic food incompatibilities often caused by specific enzyme deficiencies) must be diagnostically differentiated from food allergies.},

   abstract = {CONTEXT: An increased intraepithelial lymphocyte density in an architecturally normal proximal small intestinal mucosal biopsy is a common finding facing surgical pathologists dealing with gastrointestinal biopsy specimens. Approximately 1% to 2% of all proximal small intestinal biopsies will show this change. It is increasingly recognized by surgical pathologists that gluten-sensitive enteropathy is an important cause of this pattern; however, gluten-sensitive enteropathy accounts for the minority of all cases. A wide variety of immunologic stimuli can raise intraepithelial lymphocyte numbers. Among the other common associations are enteric infection, autoimmune disease, drugs, and gastric Helicobacter infection. OBJECTIVE: To outline the causes of intraepithelial lymphocytosis, to highlight the importance and the difficulties faced in establishing gluten-sensitive enteropathy as the cause, and to aid the surgical pathologist in the routine sign out of these cases. DATA SOURCES: A review of the literature detailing the causes or associations of proximal small intestinal intraepithelial lymphocytosis is presented. CONCLUSIONS: Increased lymphocyte numbers in the epithelium of architecturally preserved proximal small intestinal biopsies is a morphologic feature associated with a broad differential diagnosis.},

OBJECTIVES: To compare the employment status and disease burden in young adult patients with several chronic digestive disorders with healthy controls, and to determine whether labour participation depends on disease characteristics, such as type of diagnosis and burden of disease. PARTICIPANTS: In total 622 patients categorized into five diagnostic groups--inflammatory bowel disease (IBD) (n=274), chronic liver diseases (n=78), congenital digestive disorders (n=104), food allergy (n=77), celiac disease (n=89)--and a population-based control group (n=248), age 15-24 years. METHODS: Labour participation and burden of disease (i.e. consequences of the disease in daily life) were assessed by a postal questionnaire. Multivariate statistics were computed to investigate the relationship between disease characteristics and labour participation. RESULTS: Patients with IBD or chronic liver diseases were found to have limited job prospects. Patients with chronic liver diseases, IBD and food allergy reported more disease burden regarding several indicators compared with controls. Logistic regression analyses including background characteristics revealed socio-economic status (educational level of parents) and nocturnal toilet use as important determinants of employment. In addition, gender and medication intake were found to be most determinative for a full-time position. CONCLUSIONS: The possible impact of IBD and chronic liver diseases on the labour participation of young adults should be recognized and deserves extra attention from gastroenterologists so that young patients can be supported to increase their job opportunities.},

   abstract = {BACKGROUND: Celiac disease is a widely prevalent enteropathy caused by intolerance to gliadin, one of the gluten proteins. We developed two methods for the analysis of gliadin levels. Both methods use flow cytometry and rat antibodies against a 16-residue peptide of gliadin. The peptide is common to the alpha-, beta-, gamma-, and omega-gliadins. METHODS: In the one-site assay, the antigen (gliadin standard or food extract) was adsorbed on 3-mum latex particles. Sensitized particles were then incubated, in this order, with rat anti-gliadin peptide antibodies and anti-rat immunoglobulin G antibodies labeled with fluorescein isothiocyanate. In the two-site assay, the antigen was trapped on the latex particles by rat anti-gliadin antibodies and then measured by the same antibodies labeled with fluorescein. RESULTS: Detection limits were 1 ng/ml for the one-site assay and 10 pg/ml for the two-site assay. The two-site assay displayed gliadin at concentrations above the limit proposed by the Codex Alimentarius in 2 of 40 gluten-free products. CONCLUSION: There is a growing concern that gliadin, even when present in gluten-free foods within the limit fixed by the Codex Alimentarius, over the long term may become toxic to patients with celiac disease. The techniques described in this study provide an opportunity to further decrease the acceptable limit of gliadin in gluten-free foods.},

Successful management of CD requires a team approach, including the person with CD and his or her family, physician, dietitian, and celiac support group; an individualized approach; understanding of quality of life issues; use of evidence-based, current information and resources; and regular follow-up to monitor compliance, nutritional status, and additional information and support. The physician must clearly communicate, with a positive attitude, an overview of CD and strongly emphasize the importance of a GFD for life. It is essential that the physician initiate an immediate referral to a dietitian with expertise in CD for nutritional assessment, diet education, meal planning, and assistance with the adaptation to the challenging new gluten-free lifestyle. Good dietary compliance will reduce the risk of further complications and associated health care costs and improve quality of life in patients with CD.},

   abstract = {BACKGROUND: The widespread of serologic diagnosis for celiac disease has brought about an epidemiologic shift. Little up-to-date information is available on relevant epidemiologic issues regarding diagnosis, information, and therapy. OBJECTIVE: To examine forms of presentation, diagnostic difficulties, follow-up, information sources, and treatment-related issues regarding celiac disease. METHOD: A cross-sectional observational study using a self-completed questionnaire. RESULTS: Seventy-three adult patients were included; 15.0% of cases were diagnosed over 60 years of age. Most were non-smokers (91.8%). The rate of first-degree relatives with celiac sprue was 10.9%. The disease had a classic presentation in only 54.7% of cases. A functional gastrointestinal disorder was initially suspected in 42.4% of patients. Diet adherence is adequate, with unintentional lack of compliance in 15.5% of patients. Diet results in absent or improved symptoms in virtually all patients, but most of them consider compliance a challenge. Forty percent had difficulty finding gluten-free food, and 50.8% had problems in labelling recognition. CONCLUSIONS: Celiac disease presents at any age, has a great variety of manifestations, and responds very well to gluten-free diet. It is crucial that patients be highly motivated and informed, and that they know for certain which foods and manufactured products are to be to used. Therefore, adequate control will result from coordination and cooperation regarding all resources involved, including medical care, and information provided by associations and other sources such as the Web.},

The aim of the study was to evaluate rates, distribution, clinical features and environmental risk factors for food intolerances and allergies in immigrant children. Hospital records of 4,130 patients with celiac disease (CD), cow milk protein intolerance (CMPI) and food allergies (FA) diagnosed in 24 Italian Centres from 1999 to 2001 were retrospectively reviewed, comparing immigrant patients with Italian ones. 78/4,130 (1.9%) patients were immigrant: 36/1,917 (1.9%) had CD, 24/1,370 (1.75%) CMPI and 18/843 (2.1%) FA. They were evenly distributed across Italy and their native areas were: East Europe (23/78), Northern Africa (23/78), Southern Asia (14/78), Saharan and Sub-Saharan Africa (9/78), Southern America (4/78), Far East (3/7), Middle East (2/78). Despite differences in their origin, the clinical features of immigrant children were similar to the ones of Italian patients and among each ethnic group. The majority of them were born in Italy (57/78) or have been residing in Italy since several years (19/78). All of them had lost dietary habits of the native countries and had acquired those of the Italian childhood population. Food intolerances and allergies are present also in children coming from developing countries, and paediatricians will need to have a full awareness of them because the number of immigrant children in Italy is quickly increasing. The clinical features of food intolerances and allergies appear the same in each ethnic group, despite differences in races. Sharing of dietary habits with the Italian childhood population seems to be an important environmental risk factor.},

   abstract = {Intestinal intraepithelial lymphocytes (IELs) belong to a unique T-cell population interspersed between epithelial cells of both the small and large intestine. It is becoming increasingly recognised that an increased number of IELs with a normal villous architecture is within the wide spectrum of histological abnormalities observed in coeliac disease. An increased number of IELs is the earliest pathological change following gluten challenge and a high IEL count may be the only sign of gluten sensitivity. Therefore, the finding of a raised IEL count with normal villous architecture is of sufficient clinical importance to be reported in routine small bowel biopsies. However, it is evident that not all small intestinal biopsy specimens showing increased IELs are explained by gluten sensitivity. Increased IELs in small bowel mucosa have also been associated with autoimmune disorders, tropical sprue, food protein intolerance, Helicobacter pylori-associated gastritis, peptic duodenitis, parasitic and viral infections, as well as the development of intestinal lymphoma. Histological examination of a biopsy specimen of the small bowel remains the diagnostic gold standard for coeliac disease. There will be an ever increasing demand for histological confirmation of gluten sensitivity in patients in whom the classic microscopic appearance of flattened villi may not have fully developed. The more widespread recognition by histopathologists of the pattern of injury manifested by increased numbers of IELs in intestinal biopsy specimens will certainly help in early diagnosis of coeliac disease, lessen diagnostic confusion and influence the modern practice of gastrointestinal tract medicine. This review discusses some of the recent developments in clinical pathology pertaining to increased IELs in small bowel mucosal biopsies.},

   abstract = {Coeliac disease, the most common intestinal disorder of western populations, is an autoimmune enteropathy caused by an abnormal immune response to dietary gluten peptides that occurs in genetically susceptible individuals carrying the HLA-DQ2 or -DQ8 haplotype. Despite the recent progresses in understanding the molecular mechanisms of mucosal lesions, it remains unknown how increased amounts of gluten peptides can enter the intestinal mucosa to initiate the inflammatory cascade. Current knowledge indicates that different gluten peptides are involved in the disease process in a different manner, some fragments being 'toxic' and others 'immunogenic'. Those defined as 'toxic' are able to induce mucosal damage either when added in culture to duodenal endoscopic biopsy or when administered in vivo, while those defined as 'immunogenic' are able to specifically stimulate HLA-DQ2- or DQ8-restricted T cell clones isolated from jejunal mucosa or peripheral blood of coeliac patients. These peptides are able to trigger two immunological pathways: one is thought to be a rapid effect on the epithelium that involves the innate immune response and the other represents the adaptive immune response involving CD4+ T cells in the lamina propria that recognize gluten epitopes processed and presented by antigen presenting cells. These findings are the subject of the present review.},

Oats are tolerated by most patients with coeliac disease but are not totally innocent. There are considerable differences between individual patients with respect to clinical and mucosal responses to gluten challenge. In vitro and in vivo testing has identified synthetic peptides that are toxic to the coeliac small intestinal mucosa. This toxicity overlaps at least partly to the known epitopes that are recognised by small intestinal T-cells. However, the clinical significance of several of these epitopes is unclear, as is the maximum level of gluten intake that can be recommended to be safe for patients with coeliac disease. Future efforts may lead to better understanding of the disease processes as well as possible new therapeutic options.},

   abstract = {Pyridoxal phosphate is the cofactor for over 100 enzyme-catalysed reactions in the body, including many involved in the synthesis or catabolism of neurotransmitters. Inadequate levels of pyridoxal phosphate in the brain cause neurological dysfunction, particularly epilepsy. There are several different mechanisms that lead to an increased requirement for pyridoxine and/or pyridoxal phosphate. These include: (i) inborn errors affecting the pathways of B(6) vitamer metabolism; (ii) inborn errors that lead to accumulation of small molecules that react with pyridoxal phosphate and inactivate it; (iii) drugs that react with pyridoxal phosphate; (iv) coeliac disease, which is thought to lead to malabsorption of B(6) vitamers; (v) renal dialysis, which leads to increased losses of B(6) vitamers from the circulation; (vi) drugs that affect the metabolism of B(6) vitamers; and (vii) inborn errors affecting specific pyridoxal phosphate-dependent enzymes. The last show a very variable degree of pyridoxine responsiveness, from 90% in X-linked sideroblastic anaemia (delta-aminolevulinate synthase deficiency) through 50% in homocystinuria (cystathionine beta-synthase deficiency) to 5% in ornithinaemia with gyrate atrophy (ornithine delta-aminotransferase deficiency). The possible role of pyridoxal phosphate as a chaperone during folding of nascent enzymes is discussed. High-dose pyridoxine or pyridoxal phosphate may have deleterious side-effects (particularly peripheral neuropathy with pyridoxine) and this must be considered in treatment regimes. None the less, in some patients, particularly infants with intractable epilepsy, treatment with pyridoxine or pyridoxal phosphate can be life-saving, and in other infants with inborn errors of metabolism B(6) treatment can be extremely beneficial.},

   abstract = {Research regarding the production of gluten-free bread (GFB) is very important nutritionally, technically and economically speaking, both to celiac patients and to developing countries who import wheat. The main technological problem in the production of GFB is obtaining a gluten substitute that is both inexpensive and capable of retaining gas during bread fermentation and baking. The use of gelatinized starch as an alternative for gluten seems promising. In this project, rice bread was made using pregelatinized extruded rice flour as a gluten substitute. Pre-gelatinized rice flours (PRF) were manufactured in a single screw Brabender extruder, varying extrusion temperature (108-192 degrees C) and the moisture of the raw material (19.2 - 24.8%), and were used in a proportion of 10 g for every 100 g of raw rice flour, in the production of gluten-free bread. Results showed that rice flour extruded at a high temperature (180 degrees) and low moisture content (20%), rendered bread with the best technological characteristics, presenting crust and crumb color similar to those of conventional wheat bread, although with volume and texture not as satisfactory in the same comparison.},

   abstract = {BACKGROUND: Dietary intake of wheat can cause two distinct immunologically mediated diseases with severe gastrointestinal manifestations, coeliac disease (CD) and IgE-mediated food allergy. The pathomechanisms underlying these diseases are different, but the profile of the target antigens in wheat has not been compared for the two diseases. METHODS: We compared IgA- and IgE-reactive antigens in wheat using sera from patients with coeliac disease (n = 35) and food allergy to wheat (n = 16) by one- and two-dimensional immunoblotting. Furthermore, the IgG subclass (IgG1-IgG4) reactivity to wheat antigens was studied by enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay. RESULTS: IgA antibodies from CD patients and IgE antibodies from allergic patients recognised distinct profiles of wheat antigens. Furthermore, the IgG subclass responses to wheat antigens were different in CD and wheat-allergic patients. CONCLUSION: This study thus demonstrates that wheat contains antigens/epitopes which are preferentially recognised by CD patients, whereas others elicit IgE-mediated food allergy. This finding suggests that the nature of a food antigen may influence the quality of the pathological immune response in the gut and has implications for the diagnosis and therapy of hypersensitivity to wheat.},

   abstract = {Celiac disease (CD) is sustained by abnormal intestinal mucosal T-cell response to gluten and it is strongly associated with HLA class II molecules encoded by DQA1*0501/DQB1*02 (DQ2) or DQA1*03/DQB1*0302 (DQ8). The in vitro stimulatory activity of gliadin increases after treatment with tissue transglutaminase (tTG) which catalyses the deamidation of specific residues of glutamine to glutamate that can serve as anchors for binding to DQ2 as well as to DQ8 molecules. We modelled the three-dimensional structure of the DQ2 dimer protein, the most frequent in celiac patients, by using a homology modelling strategy, and deposited the model in the Protein Data Bank (PDB). Then, we simulated the interactions of DQ2 with different gluten peptides and the deamidation of specific peptide glutamines in the known p4, p6, p7 and p9 anchor positions, as well as in p1 and p5 positions, and other substitutions for which experimental effects on binding are available by previous experimental studies. By evaluating the energy of interaction and the H-bond interactions, we were able to distinguish what substitutions improve the interaction peptide-DQ2, in agreement with previously published experimental data. By analysing the peptide-DQ2 complex at the atom level, we observed that these glutamate side chains can interact with specific positively charged amino acids of DQ2, absent in other HLA alleles not related to celiac disease. The simulation was also extended to other peptides, related to celiac disease but for which no experimental data exists about the effects of glutamine deamidation. Our results give an interpretation at the molecular level of previously reported binding experimental data and open a new window to gain further insights about peptide recognition in celiac disease.},

A validated questionnaire was distributed to families of children with CD. One hundred forty-one children with biopsy-proven CD were included in the study. We found significant differences in the clinical spectrum of children based on their infant feeding history. Exclusively breastfed children were significantly less likely to report failure to thrive (69% vs 88%, p<0.05) and short stature (37% vs 62%, p<0.05), and had a higher rate of "atypical'' symptoms (p<0.01). Breastfeeding alters the presentation and contributes to atypical presentations of CD and diagnostic delay. Pediatricians need to be aware of the diverse manifestations of celiac disease to reduce diagnostic delay.},

   abstract = {The native structure and distribution of gliadin epitopes responsible for Celiac Sprue (CS) may be influenced by cereal food processing. This work was aimed at showing the capacity of probiotic VSL#3 to decrease the toxicity of wheat flour during long-time fermentation. VSL#3 (10(9) cfu/ml) hydrolyzed completely the alpha2-gliadin-derived epitopes 62-75 and 33-mer (750 ppm). Two-dimensional electrophoresis, immunological (R5 antibody) and mass spectrometry analyses showed an almost complete degradation of gliadins during long-time fermentation of wheat flour by VSL#3. Gliadins non-hydrolyzed during fermentation by VSL#3 were subjected to peptic-tryptic (PT) digestion and analyzed by CapLC-ESI-Q-ToF-MS (Capillary Liquid Chromatography-Electrospray Ionization-Quadrupole-Time of Flight-Mass Spectrometry). Search for several epitopes showed the only presence of alpha2-gliadin-fragment 62-75 at a very low concentration (sub-ppm range). Compared to IEC-6 cells exposed to intact gliadins extracted from the chemically acidified dough (control), VSL#3 pre-digested gliadins caused a less pronounced reorganization of the intracellular F-actin which was mirrored by an attenuated effect on intestinal mucosa permeability. The release of zonulin from intestinal epithelial cells treated with gliadins was considerably lower when digested with VSL#3. Agglutination test on K 562 (S) cells showed that the PT-digest of wheat flour treated with VSL#3 increased the Minimal Agglutinating Activity of ca. 100 times. Wheat proteins were extracted from doughs and subjected to PT digestion. Compared to PT-digest from chemically acidified dough, celiac jejunal biopsies exposed to the PT-digest from the dough fermented by VSL#3 did not show an increase of the infiltration of CD3(+) intraepithelial lymphocytes. Proteolytic activity by probiotic VSL#3 may have an importance during food processing to produce pre-digested and tolerated gliadins for increasing the palatability of gluten-free products.},

Mass spectrometry experiments demonstrated that GlnBP binds the following amino acid sequence: XXQPQPQQQQQQQQQQQQL, present only into the toxic prolamines. The binding of GlnBP to gliadin suggested us to design a new optical biosensor based on nanostructured porous silicon (PSi) for the detection of trace amounts of gliadin in food. The GlnBP, which acts as a molecular probe for the gliadin, was covalently linked to the surface of the PSi wafer by a proper passivation process. The GlnBP-gliadin interaction was revealed as a shift in wavelength of the fringes in the reflectivity spectrum of the PSi layer. The GlnBP, covalently bonded to the PSi chip, selectively recognized the toxic peptide. Finally, the sensor response to the protein concentration was measured in the range 2.0-40.0 microg/L and the sensitivity of the sensor was determined.},

After fermentation, the dough was freeze-dried, mixed with buckwheat flour at a ratio of 3:7, and used to produce the "fusilli" type Italian pasta. Pasta without prefermentation was used as the control. Ingredients and pastas were characterized for compositional analysis. As shown by two-dimensional electrophoresis, 92 of the 130 durum wheat gliadin spots were hydrolyzed almost totally during fermentation by lactic acid bacteria. Mass spectrometry matrix-assisted laser desorption/ionization time-of-flight and reversed phase high-performance liquid chromatography analyses confirmed the hydrolysis of gliadins. As shown by immunological analysis by R5-Western blot, the concentration of gluten decreased from 6280 ppm in the control pasta to 1045 ppm in the pasta fermented with lactic acid bacteria. Gliadins were extracted from fermented and nonfermented durum wheat dough semolina and used to produce a peptic-tryptic (PT) digest for in vitro agglutination tests on cells of human origin. The whole PT digests did not cause agglutination. Affinity chromatography on Sepharose-6-B mannan column separated the PT digests in three fractions. Fraction C showed agglutination activity. The minimal agglutinating activity of fraction C from the PT digest of fermented durum wheat semolina was ca. 80 times higher than that of durum wheat semolina. Pasta was subjected to sensory analysis: The scores for stickiness and firmness were slightly lower than those found for the pasta control. Odor and flavor did not differ between the two types of pasta. These results showed that a pasta biotechnology that uses a prefermentation of durum wheat semolina by selected lactic acid bacteria and tolerated buckwheat flour could be considered as a novel tool to potentially decrease gluten intolerance and the risk of gluten contamination in gluten-free products.},

The gluten levels in barley wheat, rye and spelt malts ranged 18.8-45.0, 44.0-68.0, 41.6 and 21.2 g kg-1, respectively. When various types of beer were compared, the gluten concentration increased as follows: alcohol-free beer (<3.0), lager beers (<3.0-8.7 mg l-1), stouts (9.0-15.2 mg l-1) and wheat beers (10.6-41.2 mg l-1). When 10 Czech lager beers were analysed, using both sandwich and competitive ELISA, the results showed that the latter method provided values several times higher than the former. Gluten balance was carried out during the brewing process, starting from the raw materials and terminating at the final beer. Gluten levels decreased due to precipitation during the mashing process, primary and secondary fermentation and, lastly, as a result of adsorption during beer stabilization. The gluten content in beer is, thus, approximately three orders of magnitude lower than in the raw malt.},

The long-term effect of a gluten-free diet on intestinal permeability and the correlation of intestinal permeability with a gluten-free diet are not known. The objectives of this study were to determine the responses of intestinal permeability and antibody testing to gluten free diet and the degree of correlation of these measurements with gluten ingestion. In this prospective study, patients with celiac disease were divided into three groups based on length of time on a gluten-free diet: Group A, < 1 month; Group B, 1 month-1 year; Group C, > 1 year. Patients in Groups B and C were tested at baseline and at 4-12 weeks later for the following: lactulose/mannitol intestinal permeability, endomysial antibody, and 3-day food record. Permeability tests were also performed in Group A and control subjects. Intestinal permeability was elevated in newly diagnosed celiac disease and in individuals on a gluten-free diet for less than 1 year. Intestinal permeability was normal in 80% at visit 1 and 87% at visit 2 in individuals with celiac disease on a gluten-free diet for more than a year. Trace gluten ingestion was associated with increased intestinal permeability on visit 2 (P = 0.0480). The sensitivity of detecting gluten ingestion as measured by a 3-day food record was higher for permeability testing (29 and 36%) compared with endomysial antibody testing (18 and 18%) for visits 1 and 2, respectively. Intestinal permeability normalizes in the majority of individuals with celiac disease on a gluten-free diet. Gluten ingestion as measured by a 3-day food record correlates with intestinal permeability measurements. The role of permeability testing in the follow-up of patients with celiac disease warrants further investigation.},

   abstract = {Gliadins and glutenins are the main protein fractions present in wheat gluten. They are responsible for technological and nutritional quality of wheat based products. In particular, glutenins are mainly responsible for dough visco-elastic properties, whereas gliadins confer extensibility to dough and are the most important factor triggering celiac disease, the major human intolerance to gluten. Gliadins are monomeric proteins, whereas glutenins are polymers stabilized by disulfide bonds. Although they have distinctive structural characteristics, it is possible that some gliadins become part of the glutenin fraction because of mutations that affect cysteine number and distribution. Here, we provide evidence that a naturally mutated gamma-gliadin with an extra cysteine residue is incorporated into the polymeric fraction. This goal was achieved using an integrated approach involving heterologous expression, 2-DE, RP-HPLC and MS.},

   abstract = {OBJECTIVES: In the past, one of the major problems in gluten analysis has been the unavailability of an efficient, universal, extraction procedure of gliadins - the alcohol-soluble proteins of gluten - from both heat processed and unprocessed products. This study was designed to develop a universal, extraction procedure capable of extracting the totality of gliadins from both unprocessed and heat processed foods for coeliac patients. METHODS: A simple quantitative extraction solution containing 250 mM 2-mercaptoethanol and 2 M guanidine hydrochloride ('cocktail'), was developed to extract gliadins from heated foods. RESULTS: The diluted reducing and disaggregating agents reaching the micro plate at low concentration do not affect the ELISA system based on the R5 monoclonal antibody. The recovery of gliadins extracted by the cocktail from spiked samples was nearly complete, with an average mean value of 95.5%, which is clearly superior to 44.4% obtained with conventional 60% aqueous ethanol. The cocktail always yielded either slightly similar or higher values than 60% aqueous ethanol depending on the type of foods: 1.1-fold in unheated foods, 1.4-fold in wheat starches and 3.0-fold in heated foods. False positives or negatives were never observed using the cocktail solution. CONCLUSION: We present a general complete gliadin extraction procedure based on reducing and disaggregating agents for both heated and unheated foods as a crucial tool for gliadin analysis. The new extraction solution is used for corresponding proteins from rye (secalins) and barley (hordeins). The cocktail was employed as the extraction method in the international ring trial evaluation of sandwich R5-ELISA as proposed by the Codex Alimentarius and organized by the Working Group on Prolamin Analysis and Toxicity.},

   abstract = {Celiac disease (CD) is a complex small intestinal disorder due to a dysregulated immune response to wheat gliadin and related proteins which leads to a small intestinal enteropathy. It is generally accepted that CD is a T-cell mediated disease, in which, gliadin derived peptides, either in native form or deamidated by tissue transglutaminase, activate lamina propria infiltrating T lymphocytes which release proinflammatory cytokines. Recent studies indicate that gliadin contains also peptides able to activate an innate immune response. In particular, they induce a selective expansion of IEL, particularly TCRgamma/delta+ and CD8+TCR alpha/beta+ lymphocytes bearing the CD94 NK receptor, as well as a strong epithelial expression of MICA molecules which interact with NKG2D receptor expressed on TCRgamma/delta+ and NK cells. Most of the events of innate immune activation events are inhibited by antibodies neutralizing IL-15, thus confirming the key role of this cytokine as a mediator of intestinal mucosa damage induced by ingestion of gliadin. It remains to be established to what extent the ability of gliadin peptides to activate innate immunity relates to other biological properties exerted not only on celiac cells and tissues; the specificity of celiac patients is probably related to their genetic make up.},

   abstract = {Celiac disease (CD) is an intestinal disorder caused by an altered immune response against wheat gluten, a common dietary antigen, and related cereal proteins. Both CD4+ and CD8+ T cells have a role in inducing the intestinal damage, although recent studies have also pinpointed the involvement of the innate immune response in CD pathogenesis. So far, the only available treatment for CD is the strict avoidance of gluten in the diet, but the poor compliance and the associated complications demand alternative therapies. During the last decade, the knowledge of genetic, molecular and cellular mechanisms leading to CD pathogenesis made great progress. The improved understanding of gluten peptides activating either adaptive or innate immune response, of HLA restriction molecules, as well as of cytokines that mediate most of the inflammatory reactions, opens several new promising perspectives for therapeutic intervention. This review discusses both molecular and cellular strategies to treat CD, including the use of proteolytic enzymes active on gluten peptides, antibodies neutralising IL-15 and IFN-gamma, drugs targeting HLA, regulatory cytokines and T cells.},

   abstract = {Celiac disease (CD) results from a permanent intolerance to dietary gluten and is due to a massive T cell-mediated immune response to gliadin, the main component of gluten. In this disease, the regulation of immune responses to dietary gliadin is altered. Herein, we investigated whether IL-10 could modulate anti-gliadin immune responses and whether gliadin-specific type 1 regulatory T (Tr1) cells could be isolated from the intestinal mucosa of CD patients in remission. Short-term T cell lines were generated from jejunal biopsies, either freshly processed or cultured ex vivo with gliadin in the presence or absence of IL-10. Ex vivo stimulation of CD biopsies with gliadin in the presence of IL-10 resulted in suppression of Ag-specific proliferation and cytokine production, indicating that pathogenic T cells are susceptible to IL-10-mediated immune regulation. T cell clones generated from intestinal T cell lines were tested for gliadin specificity by cytokine production and proliferative responses. The majority of gliadin-specific T cell clones had a Th0 cytokine production profile with secretion of IL-2, IL-4, IFN-gamma, and IL-10 and proliferated in response to gliadin. Tr1 cell clones were also isolated. These Tr1 cells were anergic, restricted by DQ2 (a CD-associated HLA), and produced IL-10 and IFN-gamma, but little or no IL-2 or IL-4 upon activation with gliadin or polyclonal stimuli. Importantly, gliadin-specific Tr1 cell clones suppressed proliferation of pathogenic Th0 cells. In conclusion, dietary Ag-specific Tr1 cells are present in the human intestinal mucosa, and strategies to boost their numbers and/or function may offer new therapeutic opportunities to restore gut homeostasis.},

   abstract = {OBJECTIVE: The threshold of gluten contamination in gluten-free products of both dietary and normal consumption is under debate. The objective of this study was to gather information on consumption of gluten-free products intended for dietary use of people under a gluten-free diet. This information is essential to ascertain the exposure of coeliac patients to gluten through their diet and deduce the maximum gluten content that these products should contain to guarantee a safe diet. METHODS: A diet diary of consumption of gluten-free products intended for dietary use was distributed to the coeliac societies of two typical Mediterranean countries (Italy and Spain) and two Northern countries (Norway and Germany). The diet diary included a self-weigh table of the selected food items and a 10-day consumption table. Results were reported in percentiles as distributions were clearly right skewed. RESULTS: The respondents included in the study accounted for 1359 in Italy, 273 in Spain, 226 in Norway and 56 in Germany. Gluten-free products intended for dietary use contributed significantly to the diet of coeliac patients in Italy, Germany and Norway and to a lesser degree in Spain. The most consumed gluten-free product in all countries was bread, and it was double consumed in the Northern countries (P<0.001). Mediterranean countries showed consumption of a wider variety of gluten-free foods and pasta was eaten to a large degree in Italy. CONCLUSIONS: The differences between Northern and Mediterranean countries were not in the total amount of gluten-free products but in the type of products consumed. The observed daily consumption of gluten-free products results in the exposure to rather large amounts of gluten, thus the limit of 200 p.p.m. should be revised. A limit of 20 p.p.m. for products naturally gluten-free and of 100 p.p.m. for products rendered gluten-free is proposed to guarantee a safe diet and to enable coeliac patients to make an informed choice. These limits should be revised as new data become available.},

   abstract = {Celiac disease (CD) is one of the most common food intolerance. The only effective treatment for CD is a strict adherence to a gluten-free diet throughout the patient's lifetime. Gluten-free products are not widely available and are usually more expensive than their gluten-containing counterparts. There is, therefore, an urgent need to develop safe and effective therapeutic alternatives, to develop high-quality gluten-free products and to investigate the potential of the bread making biotechnology following ancient protocols which include long-time fermentation by selected sourdough lactic acid bacteria. This review describes the most relevant results related to biotechnologies that use selected sourdough lactic acid bacteria and probiotics as starters for sourdough fermentation to investigate their potential to decrease the risk of gluten contamination in gluten-free products. As shown by studies in vitro on celiac intestinal tissue and in vivo on CD patients, the bacterial proteolytic activity is rather promising not only as currently demonstrated for eliminating traces of contaminant gluten but probably also in perspective for the manufacture of tolerated baked goods.},

   abstract = {BACKGROUND: Small intestinal malignancies in humans are rare; however, patients with coeliac disease have a relatively high risk for such tumours. Intestinal UDP-glucuronosyltransferases are phase II drug metabolism enzymes also involved in the detoxification of ingested toxins and carcinogens. As many toxins and carcinogens are ingested via food, the human gastrointestinal tract not only has an important role in the uptake of essential nutrients, but also acts as a first barrier against such harmful constituents of the food. Therefore, the gastrointestinal mucosa contains high levels of detoxification enzymes such as cytochromes-P450, glutathione S-transferases and UDP-glucuronosyltransferases. AIM: To compare the UDP-glucuronosyltransferase detoxification capacity in small intestinal mucosa of patients with coeliac disease vs. that in normal controls. METHODS: We assessed UDP-glucuronosyltransferase enzyme activities towards 4-methylumbelliferone in small intestinal biopsies of patients with coeliac disease (n = 22) and age- and sex-matched controls (n = 27). RESULTS: Small intestinal UDP-glucuronosyltransferase enzyme activity in controls was significantly higher than in patients with coeliac disease: 0.55 +/- 0.27 vs. 0.35 +/- 0.16 nmol/min mg protein, respectively (mean +/- s.d., P = 0.005). DISCUSSION: The low small intestinal UDP-glucuronosyltransferase detoxification activity in patients with coeliac disease may result in a deficient detoxification of potential carcinogens, and thus could explain in part the relatively high small intestinal cancer risk in these patients.},

It uses a study that examined the management of food and diet in families where one member had been diagnosed with one of two medical conditions: coronary heart disease (CHD) and coeliac disease (CD). The data revealed a propensity for family members, especially female partners/wives, to see the tasks and activities related to the special diet in terms of family practices rather than individual (patients') responsibilities. These family practices could be seen to be gendered but also part of the ongoing lived experience of the family relationship. It is speculated that this is part of a desire for what Giddens has described as 'ontological security'. Thus, the special diet tends to be assimilated into family practices in ways that promote a sense of continuity that is described as 'normality' or 'leading a normal life'.},

The patient was a 71-year-old woman with a massive gastric tumor (signet ring cell carcinoma), occupying most of the stomach. A computed tomographic (CT) scan revealed para-aortic, celiac, and common hepatic lymph-node metastases. Stage IV disease was diagnosed. Palliative total gastrectomy was performed to control bleeding and to improve oral intake of food. Two courses of induction therapy with MTX, 5-FU, and Leucovorin were started 3 weeks after surgery. A CT scan revealed residual lymph node metastasis. The response was assessed to be no change, but the levels of carcinoembryonic antigen (CEA) and carbohydrate antigen (CA) 19-9 improved from 7,028 ng/ml and 726 U/ml 3 weeks after surgery to 2,832 ng/ml and 281 U/ml, respectively. Secondary treatment with oral TS-1 was begun, and a CT scan showed distinct shrinkage of lymph-node metastases. There was no serious toxicity. The levels of CEA and CA19-9 decreased markedly to 2.9 ng/ml and 16 U/ml, respectively, about 6 months after surgery and remained at 3.7 ng/ml and 16 U/ml, respectively, about 1 year after surgery.},

   abstract = {For both wheat allergy and coeliac disease the dietary avoidance of wheat and other gluten-containing cereals is the only effective treatment. Estimation of the maximum tolerated amount of gluten for susceptible individuals would support effective management of their disease. Literature was reviewed to evaluate whether an upper limit for gluten content in food, which would be safe for sufferers from both diseases, could be identified. When setting gluten limits for coeliac disease sufferers, the overall potential daily intake should be considered, while for wheat allergy limits should be based on single servings. For coeliac disease sufferers this limit should lie between 10 and 100 mg daily intake. For wheat allergy, lowest eliciting doses for children lie in the lower milligram range, while for adults they are most significantly higher. Gliadins (part of the gluten proteins) not only trigger coeliac disease, but are also major allergens in wheat allergy. Therefore, measurement of gliadins with validated enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay methods provides an appropriate marker for assessing gluten and/or wheat protein contents in food. Available data suggest that a maximum gluten content for 'gluten-free' foods could be set, which protects both wheat allergy sufferers and coeliac patients.},

   abstract = {In most patients the clinical course of celiac disease is unproblematic after the diagnosis has been made and a strict gluten-free diet is established. However, in rare cases complications like refractory sprue or lymphoma can occur. Individual management is required since the clinical presentation of celiac disease can be very heterogeneous. For example, it is a matter of controversy if asymptomatic patients, who have the same typical histological changes in their small bowel like patients with symptomatic celiac disease, should adhere to a gluten-free diet. A major problem is the compliance and the unintentional intake of gluten. A 100 % gluten-free diet is not possible since most food components are contaminated with trace amounts of gluten. Fortunately most patients tolerate these contaminations. Furthermore, the threshold for gluten contamination can differ highly among patients. One central point in patient care is the monitoring of a gluten-free diet and the timely recognition of complications. Therefore, the role of antibodies and duodenal histology in monitoring the course of the disease will be discussed.},

   abstract = {Celiac disease is a chronic intestinal disease caused by intolerance to gluten. It is characterized by immune-mediated enteropathy, associated with maldigestion and malabsorption of most nutrients and vitamins. In predisposed individuals, the ingestion of gluten-containing food such as wheat and rye induces a flat jejunal mucosa with infiltration of lymphocytes. The main symptoms are: stomach pain, gas, and bloating, diarrhea, weight loss, anemia, edema, bone or joint pain. Prevalence for clinically overt celiac disease varies from 1:270 in Finland to 1:5000 in North America. Since celiac disease can be asymptomatic, most subjects are not diagnosed or they can present with atypical symptoms. Furthermore, severe inflammation of the small bowel can be present without any gastrointestinal symptoms. The diagnosis should be made early since celiac disease causes growth retardation in untreated children and atypical symptoms like infertility or neurological symptoms. Diagnosis requires endoscopy with jejunal biopsy. In addition, tissue-transglutaminase antibodies are important to confirm the diagnosis since there are other diseases which can mimic celiac disease. The exact cause of celiac disease is unknown but is thought to be primarily immune mediated (tissue-transglutaminase autoantigen); often the disease is inherited. Management consists in life long withdrawal of dietary gluten, which leads to significant clinical and histological improvement. However, complete normalization of histology can take years.},

   abstract = {BACKGROUND: For young people with celiac disease, adherence to the gluten-free diet may be difficult to achieve and gluten restriction may lead to insufficient nutrient intake and unbalanced food intake resulting in overweight. In The Netherlands, no nutritional information is available. Therefore, we evaluated the nutritional management and nutritional state in young celiac patients. METHODS: The Dutch Celiac Society invited all its members aged 12 to 25 years to complete a food record and a questionnaire. Nutrient intakes were compared with the recommendations and the intake in the general population. Total immunoglobin A, endomysial antibody, tissue transglutaminase and IgA gliadin were determined, and height and weight were assessed. RESULTS: Strict dietary compliance was reported by 75%. The fiber and iron intakes were significantly lower, and the saturated fat intake significantly higher than recommended but comparable with the general population. Most of the patients (61%) found the diet easy to follow. Regular medical controls were reported by 86% but regular dietary controls by only 7% of the patients. Mean and SD scores for height and body mass index were -0.3 +/- 1.1 and -0.3 +/- 0.8, respectively. CONCLUSIONS: The dietary compliance in this group is high, the nutritional state is adequate, but the nutrient intake is not. Better medical and dietary support is necessary to prevent long-term complications and to achieve an ongoing satisfying management in this group of young patients with a chronic disorder.},

   abstract = {PURPOSE OF REVIEW: This paper will review new developments in the etiology and management of gastric and duodenal diseases affecting children. RECENT FINDINGS: Despite dropping prevalence rates in developed nations, most new Helicobacter pylori infections are primarily acquired during childhood. Resistance to standard triple therapy and falling eradication rates are increasing problems for clinicians, necessitating the study of alternative treatment strategies. Eosinophilic diseases of the gastrointestinal tract are being increasingly recognized. Although population-based epidemiology and the natural history of eosinophilic diseases are not yet fully characterized, biologic therapies are in development for the treatment of these chronic, often refractory, conditions. A recent US National Institutes of Health celiac disease consensus conference suggested that infants' diet constituents and timing of solid food introduction are potential environmental influences in the development of celiac disease. SUMMARY: New methods of diagnosis and treatment are greatly impacting care of pediatric patients with gastric and duodenal diseases. Less invasive but highly accurate tools for diagnosis are becoming better validated. Early diagnosis and effective intervention in most gastroduodenal disorders of childhood can alter natural history and improve overall quality of life.},

   abstract = {OBJECTIVE: To characterize the clinical, radiological, and electrophysiological laboratory profiles and histological features of patients who developed cognitive impairment temporally associated with celiac disease. DESIGN: Case series. SETTING: Referral center. PATIENTS: Patients with the onset of progressive cognitive decline within 2 years of symptomatic onset or with a severe exacerbation of biopsy-proved adult celiac disease were identified from the Mayo Clinic medical records from January 1, 1970, to December 31, 2005. Patients were excluded if an alternate cause of their cognitive impairment was identified. RESULTS: Thirteen patients (5 women) were identified. The median age at cognitive impairment onset was 64 years (range, 45-79 years), which coincided with symptom onset or exacerbation of diarrhea, steatorrhea, and abdominal cramping in 5 patients. Amnesia, acalculia, confusion, and personality changes were the most common presenting features. The average initial Short Test of Mental Status score was 28 of a total of 38 (range, 18-34), which was in the moderately impaired range. The results of neuropsychological testing suggested a trend of a frontosubcortical pattern of impairment. Ten patients had ataxia, and 4 of them also had peripheral neuropathy. Magnetic resonance imaging of the head showed nonspecific T2 hyperintensities, and electroencephalography showed nonspecific diffuse slowing. Deficiencies in folate, vitamin B(12), vitamin E, or a combination were identified in 4 patients, yet supplementation did not improve their neurological symptoms. Three patients improved or stabilized cognitively with gluten withdrawal. A detailed histological analysis revealed nonspecific gliosis. CONCLUSIONS: A possible association exists between progressive cognitive impairment and celiac disease, given the temporal relationship and the relatively high frequency of ataxia and peripheral neuropathy, more commonly associated with celiac disease. Given the impact for potential treatment of similar cases, recognition of this possible association and additional studies are warranted.},

We investigated the development of transglutaminase antibodies and analysed potential risk factors for coeliac disease autoimmunity in first-degree relatives of patients with type 1 diabetes. METHODS: The study was conducted by prospective observational follow-up from birth of 1,511 children at increased risk of type 1 diabetes or coeliac disease born in Germany between 1989 and 2000. Mean follow-up was to age 7.6 years. Children were tested for transglutaminase and islet autoantibodies. Children were classified as transglutaminase antibody-positive if antibodies were detected by both ELISA and radiobinding assays. RESULTS: The risk of developing transglutaminase antibodies was 4.9% by age 8 years (n=63; 95% CI, 3.7-6.1%). Transglutaminase antibodies developed at an older age than islet autoantibodies (median age, 4.9 vs 2.3 years; p<0.005), and only three children developed both transglutaminase antibodies and islet autoantibodies. Multivariate analysis indicated an increased risk of transglutaminase antibodies in children with the HLA-DRB1*03 allele (hazard ratio for heterozygous DR3, 5.5; 95% CI, 2.9-10.2; hazard ratio for homozygous DR3, 16.2; 95% CI, 6.7-39; p<0.0001) and in children with impaired uterine growth (birth weight < or = 1st percentile, hazard ratio, 3.1; 95% CI, 1.1-7.8, p=0.03). Neither breast-feeding or its duration nor the age of first exposure to gluten was associated with the risk of developing transglutaminase antibodies. CONCLUSIONS/INTERPRETATION: Coeliac disease autoimmunity is initiated later than islet autoimmunity in children who are at risk. An influence of infant nutrition on the development of coeliac disease autoimmunity could not be confirmed in this prospective study.},

   abstract = {Sweden has experienced an epidemic of symptomatic coeliac disease that has no likeness anywhere else in the world. This is quite unique for a disease that is genetically dependent, immune-mediated and chronic, and suggests an abrupt increase and decrease, respectively, of one or a few causal factors influencing a large proportion of Swedish infants during the period in question. We have shown that half of the epidemic was explained by an increase in the proportion of infants introduced to gluten in comparatively large amounts after breast-feeding had been ended. This was partly an effect of societal changes in national dietary recommendations and the food content of industrially produced infant foods. Thus, these changes over time in infant feeding practices had a large public health impact. In fact, when the Swedish epidemic began, the increase in incidence rate was larger in girls than in boys, as was the decrease during the post-epidemic period. Moreover, children born during summer had an increased risk for coeliac disease, possibly as they were mostly introduced to dietary gluten during winter when infections are more common. Notably, birth cohorts of the epidemic and post-epidemic periods differ considerably regarding coeliac disease occurrence at comparable ages, even when followed up to school age. A longer follow-up will reveal to what extent new cases develop later in life, and to what extent this difference in cumulative incidence remains. However, mass screening studies of both the epidemic and post-epidemic cohorts at comparable ages are also planned to determine to what extent 'silent' disease cases develop. Continuing to explore the Swedish epidemic of coeliac disease by means of an epidemiological approach provides a unique opportunity. This may include increasing our understanding of what determines the clinical expression of the disease, exploring the potentially causal role of environmental exposures, and possibly also identifying strategies for primary prevention.},

Two strongly associated cofactors have been identified: the presence of HLA-DQ2 or HLA-DQ8 in the host and specific antigenic peptides in the diet that are present in wheat, rye, and barley. Most patients have complete remission after dietary elimination of these foods. Crohn's disease is characterized by chronic, relapsing, recurrent, focal, transmural inflammation of the gastrointestinal tract that can lead to multiple serious problems requiring chronic medical and surgical therapy. Crohn's disease is associated with multiple genetic mutations, at least one of which has been clearly implicated in innate immunity. Multiple lines of evidence suggest that the disease involves abnormal immune responses to gut microbial flora.},

   abstract = {Multiple myeloma is malignant disease that is characterized in most patients, by the presence in the serum of monoclonal gamma globulins, which in agarose gel after electrophoresis appear as protein band of restricted mobility, "M" component. The aim of this study was to determine are the antibodies contained in M-component directed to some antigen chronically present in the organism, to some of food antigens. Seventeen patients with secretory plasmacytoma were included in the study: eight of them had IgG(kappa), three had IgG(lambda), and one had biclonal IgG(kappa) and IgA(kappa), while two had IgA(kappa), the other two IgA(lambda) and one IgM(lambda) as paraproteins. M-proteins were detected analyzing patients' sera by agarose gel electrophoresis in 0.09 M barbital buffer. The each M-protein was confirmed by immunotyping (immunofixation) with corresponding antihuman antibodies directed to heavy or light chains of immunoglobulins. After the patients serum separation on agarose gel by electrophoresis, fresh 0.4% solution of crude gliadin (Sigma) in 1% SDS was put over the slides for immunoprecipitation. Preliminary results showed the interaction of gliadin with patient's serum proteins present in the protein fraction of the same mobility as it was the mobility of the M-component, in 6 from 17 investigated sera. These results are the first reporting that in sera of some patients with multiple myeloma antibodies from M-component could be directed to some of gliadin antigens. As the serum antigliadin immunoreactivity is present in patients with gluten intolerance, celiac disease, it could be of importance to elucidate is the multiple myeloma more severe form of gluten intolerance than celiac disease.},

   abstract = {BACKGROUND: For patients with coeliac disease (CD), compliance with a gluten-free diet, when eating food not prepared at home may be difficult. AIMS: We assessed whether there are differences in the eating habits of coeliac patients when compared to the general public. In addition, we compared chefs' knowledge with the public's knowledge about CD. METHOD: A questionnaire survey about CD was performed on coeliac patients, chefs and the general public from the United Kingdom (UK). RESULTS: Three hundred and nineteen coeliac patients [mean age 53.8 years, 65.8% female], 513 members of the public [49.2 years, 62.6% female] and 322 chefs [37.6 years, 15.2% female] were interviewed. Chefs were less likely to have heard of CD when compared to the public (17.1% (55/322) versus 44.2% (227/513), respectively, P<0.0001). Coeliac patients ate less frequently at a friend's house than the general public (P = 0.003). Coeliac patients ate less frequently from take-away establishments (P<0.0001). However, coeliac patients' ate as frequently in restaurants (P = 0.078). CONCLUSIONS: In the UK, chefs appear to know less about CD than the general public. Patients with CD feel justifiably cautious when eating food not prepared at home. Educating chefs about a gluten-free diet may alleviate the social restrictions on coeliac patients.},

   abstract = {Celiac disease is caused by sensitivity to wheat gluten in genetically susceptible individuals. The etiological role of the other wheat-related cereals, barley, rye, and oats, is still debated. In order to investigate this issue further, in this study we examined the immune response of celiac mucosal T cell lines to fractions from all four cereals. Cell stimulation was assessed by measuring proliferation (employing (3)H-thymidine incorporation) or cytokine (IL-2, IFN-gamma) production. All five T cell lines demonstrated immunoreactivity to protein fractions from the four related cereals. In some cell lines, reactivity to wheat, barley, and rye was only evident when these cereal fractions had been pretreated with tissue transglutaminase. This study confirms the similar T cell antigenic reactivity of these four related cereals and has implications for their exclusion in the gluten-free diet. However, despite oats stimulation of T cell lines, this cereal does not activate a mucosal lesion in most celiac patients.},

   abstract = {Celiac disease (CD) is a small intestinal disorder caused by adaptive and innate immune responses triggered by the gluten proteins present in wheat. In the intestine, gluten is partially degraded and modified, which results in gluten peptides that bind with high affinity to HLA-DQ2 or HLA-DQ8 and trigger an inflammatory T cell response. Simultaneously, gluten exposure leads to increased production of IL15, which induces the expression of NKG2D on intraepithelial lymphocytes and its ligand MICA on epithelial cells, leading to epithelial cell destruction. The gluten-specific T cell response results in the production of antibodies against tissue transglutaminase and these are specific indicators of disease. CD is one of the most common inherited diseases, the HLA-DQ locus being the major contributing genetic factor. However, as the inheritance does not follow a Mendelian segregation pattern, multiple other genes, each with relative weak effect, contribute to disease development. An important role for environmental factors, however, can not be ignored as the concordance rate in monozygous twins is considerably less than 100%. The identification of these environmental factors and susceptibility genes may allow a better understanding of disease etiology and provide diagnostic and prognostic markers. The current treatment for CD consists of a life-long gluten-free diet. Although long thought to be impossible, recent results suggest that the development of nontoxic wheat varieties may be feasible, which would aid disease prevention and provide an alternative food source for patients.},

   abstract = {Medical nutrition therapy is the only accepted treatment for celiac disease. This paper summarizes a review of scientific studies using the gluten-free diet, nutritional risk factors, controversial elements of the diet, and its implementation in treating celiac disease. Treatment for celiac disease requires elimination of the storage proteins found in wheat, rye, and barley. The inclusion of oats and wheat starch is controversial. Research supports that oats may be acceptable for patients with celiac disease and can improve the nutritional quality of the diet. However, use of oats is not widely recommended in the United States because of concerns of potential contamination of commercial oats. Studies assessing the contamination of commercial oats are limited. Research indicates no differences in patients choosing a strict wheat starch-containing, gluten-free diet vs. a naturally gluten-free diet. Factors other than trace gluten may be the cause of continued villous atrophy in some patients. The impact of nutrient malabsorption caused from untreated celiac disease is well documented. The diet and gluten-free products are often low in B vitamins, calcium, vitamin D, iron, zinc, magnesium, and fiber. Few gluten-free products are enriched or fortified, adding to the risk of nutrient deficiencies. Patients newly diagnosed or inadequately treated have low bone mineral density, imbalanced macronutrients, low fiber intake, and micronutrient deficiencies. Also troubling is the increased incidence of obesity seen in persons with celiac disease following a gluten-free diet. Because of the nutritional risks associated with celiac disease, a registered dietitian must be part of the health care team that monitors the patient's nutritional status and compliance on a regular basis.},

   abstract = {Celiac disease (CD) is an autoimmune condition occurring in genetically susceptible individuals characterized by inflammatory injury to the mucosa of the small intestine after the ingestion of wheat glutens or related barley and rye products. Originally thought to be highly prevalent only in Northern European populations, growing evidence indicates a much higher prevalence in many other regions, including the US as well as South America, North Africa, and Asia. The growing awareness that pediatric patients may present with quite diverse and protean manifestations and the significant impact of CD on childhood development has prompted efforts to increase CD awareness for the early diagnosis and treatment of this disease. The current diagnostic criteria for CD requires characteristic histologic findings in small bowel biopsies and clinical remission when placed on a gluten-free diet. Serologic testing for CD can provide additional support for the diagnosis of CD or a means to assess efficacy and adherence to a gluten-free diet. The mainstay of treatment remains the institution of a gluten-free diet. However, patients with refractory CD may require treatment with immunosuppressant medications. With the increased identification of specific gluten epitopes and understanding of the pathogenesis of CD, future therapies may rely on genetically altering gluten proteins, immunization techniques, or therapies focused on either the development of specific immune tolerance or regulation of mucosal inflammation.},

   abstract = {BACKGROUND: Patients with inflammatory bowel disease have a 10- to 100-fold increased risk of nephrolithiasis, with enteric hyperoxaluria being the major risk factor for these and other patients with fat malabsorptive states. Endogenous components of the intestinal microflora can potentially limit dietary oxalate absorption. METHODS: Ten patients were studied with chronic fat malabsorption, calcium oxalate stones, and hyperoxaluria thought to be caused by jejunoileal bypass (1) and Roux-en-Y gastric bypass surgery for obesity (4), dumping syndrome secondary to gastrectomy (2), celiac sprue (1), chronic pancreatitis (1), and ulcerative colitis in remission (1). For 3 months, patients received increasing doses of a lactic acid bacteria mixture (Oxadrop), VSL Pharmaceuticals), followed by a washout month. Twenty-four-hour urine collections were performed at baseline and after each month. RESULTS: Mean urinary oxalate excretion fell by 19% after 1 month (1 dose per day, P < 0.05), and oxalate excretion remained reduced by 24% during the second month (2 doses per day, P < 0.05). During the third month on 3 doses per day oxalate excretion increased slightly, so that the mean was close to the baseline established off treatment. Urinary oxalate again fell 20% from baseline during the washout period. Calcium oxalate supersaturation was reduced while on Oxadrop, largely due to the decrease in oxalate excretion, although mean changes did not reach statistical significance. CONCLUSION: Manipulation of gastrointestinal (GI) flora can influence urinary oxalate excretion to reduce urinary supersaturation levels. These changes could have a salutary effect on stone formation rates. Further studies will be needed to establish the optimal dosing regimen.},

The typical form mainly affecting children shows failure to thrive and/or gastrointestinal symptoms. The adult form is less typical, presenting vague gastrointestinal symptoms, iron deficiency (with or without anemia) or nonspecific serum chemistry abnormalities. The present study aims to analyze clinical and biochemical differences of celiac disease (CD) according to sex and age. PATIENTS AND METHODS: The present study reviewed clinical and biochemical features of patients with suspected CD admitted to the Hospital General of Mostoles (Madrid, Spain) between July 2001 and June 2005. Two hundred fifty-two patients were analyzed, in whom intestinal biopsy was performed due to clinical and/or biochemical abnormalities suggestive of CD. One hundred seventy-eight asymptomatic relatives of the affected patients were also included. Overall, 125 patients showed diagnostic features of CD in the intestinal biopsy. RESULTS: The results confirmed higher prevalence of typical forms of CD in children (67% in children compared with only 14.3% in adults). CD seemed to be more frequent in adult women than in men (ratio of women to men 4:1), but it is worth noting that men diagnosed were most often referred with a typical clinical picture, so atypical forms of the disease in men may have been underdiagnosed. CONCLUSIONS: CD shows atypical features in adults, and physicians must include this disorder in the differential diagnosis of adults with iron deficiency or slight hypertransaminasemia. Increased awareness of the disease and extensive availability of accurate sero-logical tests will lead to improved diagnosis of this disorder, both in children and adults.},

However, anti-gliadin antibodies lack disease specificity being found in 10% of healthy blood donors. We report a study comparing anti-gliadin antibody with other food antibodies in patients with idiopathic ataxia (20), hereditary ataxias (seven), or idiopathic peripheral neuropathy (32). Patients were HLA typed. IgA anti-tissue transglutaminase antibodies (tTG) were measured. No case was positive for IgA anti-tTG making occult coeliac disease unlikely. HLA DQ2 and HLA DQ8 were found distributed equally across all patient groups and unrelated to gliadin antibody status. HLA DQ2 expressing, anti-gliadin antibody positive cases (so called "gluten ataxia") were rare in our clinics (four cases in 2 years from a population of 2 million). We conclude that coeliac disease per se is not commonly associated with either idiopathic ataxia or idiopathic peripheral neuropathy. Our study also casts doubt on the nosological status of "gluten ataxia" as a discreet disease entity. All food antibodies tested, particularly IgG, were a common finding in both ataxia and peripheral neuropathy groups. No particular food antibody was associated with any patient group. Food antibodies were equally common in hereditary ataxias. We conclude they are a non-specific finding.},

   abstract = {OBJECTIVE: To study the effect of HLA DQ2, dietary history and development of coeliac disease (CD) on the induction of antibody response to wheat gliadin and cow's milk, beta-lactoglobulin between 1 and 2.5 years of age in children who developed CD and in healthy children. MATERIAL AND METHODS: Infants participating in a birth cohort study (the ABIS study) in Sweden were studied. Thirty-nine children developed CD (=cases), confirmed through biopsy, during follow-up until 2.5-5 years of age. A total of 181 healthy control children were matched for duration of exclusive breast-feeding, birth-weight, gender, maternal smoking and season of birth. IgG and IgA antigliadin and anti-beta-lactoglobulin antibodies were measured using enzyme immunoassay (EIA). The effects of HLA-risk genotypes, DQ2 and DQ8, on CD were also considered. RESULTS: Children who developed CD had higher IgG and IgA antigliadin and anti-beta-lactoglobulin antibody levels at 1 year of age than controls (all comparisons: p<0.001). Similar differences were seen between cases with as yet undiagnosed CD by 1 year of age and controls, and also when cases were compared with HLA-matched controls. Higher levels of IgG and IgA antibodies to beta-lactoglobulin (p=0.003; p=0.001), but not to gliadin, were found in treated cases versus controls at 2.5 years of age. HLA-DQ2-positive healthy children had lower levels of IgG and IgA antigliadin antibodies than HLA-DQ2 negative controls at 1 year of age (p=0.004; p=0.012). CONCLUSIONS: Enhanced humoral response emerging not only to gliadin, but also to other food antigens seems to be primarily associated with CD. Poor induction of antibody response to wheat gliadin in healthy children with the HLA-DQ2 risk molecule could at least partly explain the genetic predisposition to gluten intolerance and CD.},

In the developed world, this ability appears to be breaking down, with chronic inflammatory diseases of the gut commonplace in the apparent absence of overt infections. In both mouse and man, mutations in genes that control innate immune recognition, adaptive immunity, and epithelial permeability are all associated with gut inflammation. This suggests that perturbing homeostasis between gut antigens and host immunity represents a critical determinant in the development of gut inflammation and allergy.},

   abstract = {Wheat is the staple cereal in many countries and its uses in manufactured foods are ever growing due to the technological qualities of gluten proteins. Transglutaminases (TG) are ubiquitous enzymes with many functions. They are able to transform proteins by deamidation and/or transamidation. This last reaction can cross-link proteins together. Intestinal tissue TG has been shown to play an important role in two kinds of immune reactions to wheat: celiac disease and wheat-dependent exercise-induced anaphylaxis. In addition, new epitopes have been suspected in cases of anaphylaxis to wheat isolates, a food ingredient consisting mainly of deamidated gluten proteins. As a microbial TG is included in many food technological processes, its safe use should be checked. This assessment must cover not only the safety of the TG itself but also that of the deamidated/cross-linked proteins generated by this enzyme. This article aims at discussing the possible consequences of using TG in food industry in the light of today knowledge about immune reactions to wheat.},

   abstract = {Following the application of simple serological tests for the diagnosis of coeliac disease (CD) in the 1980s, it gradually became clear that the prevalence of CD in different countries in the Middle East, North Africa and India is almost the same as that in Western countries. The prevalence of CD in at-risk populations in these regions is reported to range between 3 and 20% and the prevalence in people with type 1 diabetes is approximately 3-5%. Clinical manifestations of CD vary markedly with age, the duration and the extent of disease. Clinical studies showed that presentation with non-specific symptoms or no symptoms is as common in the Middle East as it is in Europe. Wheat has been the major staple food in these regions for many centuries and it is possible that the continuous and high level of exposure to wheat proteins has induced some degree of immune tolerance, leading to milder symptoms, which are misdiagnosed as irritable bowel syndrome or unexplained gastrointestinal disorders. A high index of suspicion for CD should be maintained in all developing countries for patients who present with chronic diarrhoea or iron deficiency anaemia. The best method for diagnosing CD in patients with diarrhoea is the panel of coeliac serological tests followed by small-bowel biopsy. In the absence of supplies for a gluten-free diet in Middle Eastern countries, maintaining this diet represents a real challenge to both patients and clinicians.},

   abstract = {BACKGROUND & AIMS: By using colorimetric tests, reports have indicated that occult gastrointestinal bleeding is common in celiac disease. These results suggest that bleeding is a significant contributor to iron deficiency in this disorder and imply a significant inflammatory hemorrhagic component. Both these concepts are contrary to previous understanding of pathology of celiac disease. Furthermore, colorimetric tests provide an indirect and nonspecific assessment of blood loss. We therefore hypothesized that an accurate, quantitative, and specific method for blood loss, rather than a guaiac test, might give different findings. We report the results of stool blood loss measurement by using such a method. METHODS: We measured stool blood loss directly by using 51Cr radiolabeled red cells in 18 consecutive patients with celiac disease who consented to the study, 12 with total villous atrophy and 6 with partial villous atrophy, before initiation of a gluten-free diet. RESULTS: Average daily blood loss exceeded 1.5 mL in only 1 of 18 subjects. It is suspected, but unproven, that this subject had an alternate transient source of gastrointestinal bleeding. CONCLUSIONS: Colorimetric tests give a high prevalence of positive results for occult gastrointestinal blood loss in celiac disease, whereas the more specific and direct radiochromium method gives a low prevalence. These results suggest that bleeding is uncommon in celiac disease, and that positive results with colorimetric tests might be due to excess loss of intestinal cells and/or malabsorption of peroxidase-containing foods. Our results suggest that bleeding is not an important contributor to the iron deficiency often found in these subjects.},

   abstract = {Celiac Sprue is a widely prevalent immune disease of the small intestine induced by dietary gluten intake in genetically susceptible individuals. It has been suggested that prolyl endopeptidases (PEPs) may be useful catalysts for gluten detoxification. We have investigated this hypothesis using food-grade gluten as the target antigen, and a combination of mass spectrometry and patient-derived T cells as quantitative assay systems. Spectrometric characterization of physiologically proteolyzed gluten revealed a number of 10 to 50 residue peptides containing known T cell epitopes involved in Celiac Sprue pathogenesis. Several of these peptides were multivalent, suggesting they may be potent triggers of the inflammatory response to gluten in celiac patients. Treatment of proteolyzed gluten with recombinant bacterial PEP decreased the number of potentially immunostimulatory peptides. Substantially reduced immunogenicity was also quantified in 12 of 14 intestinal polyclonal T cell lines from celiac patients. Kinetic investigations using eight T cell clones showed rapid destruction of alpha-gliadin epitopes, but less complete processing of gamma-gliadin epitopes. Given the difficulty associated with a strict lifelong gluten-exclusion diet, the ability of a single enzyme to greatly reduce the antigenic burden of grocery store gluten reinforces the case for developing oral peptidase therapy against Celiac Sprue.},

   abstract = {Coeliac disease is a lifelong intolerance to the gluten found in wheat, barley and rye, and some patients are also sensitive to oats. The disease is genetically determined, with 10% of the first-degree relatives affected and 75% of monozygotic twins being concordant. Of the patients with coeliac disease 95% are human leucocyte antigen (HLA)-DQ2 or HLA-DQ8 positive. Characteristically, the jejunal mucosa becomes damaged by a T-cell-mediated autoimmune response that is thought to be initiated by a 33-mer peptide fragment in A2 gliadin, and patients with this disorder have raised levels of anti-endomysium and tissue transglutaminase antibodies in their blood. Coeliac disease is the major diagnosable food intolerance and, with the advent of a simple blood test for case finding, prevalence rates are thought to be approximately 1:100. Classically, the condition presented with malabsorption and failure to thrive in infancy, but this picture has now been overtaken by the much more common presentation in adults, usually with non-specific symptoms such as tiredness and anaemia, disturbance in bowel habit or following low-impact bone fractures. Small intestinal biopsy is necessary for diagnosis and shows a characteristically flat appearance with crypt hypoplasia and infiltration of the epithelium with lymphocytes. Diet is the key to management and a gluten-free diet effectively cures the condition. However, this commitment is lifelong and many aisles in the supermarket are effectively closed to individuals with coeliac disease. Compliance can be monitored by measuring antibodies in blood, which revert to negative after 6-9 months. Patients with minor symptoms, who are found incidentally to have coeliac disease, often ask whether it is necessary to adhere to the diet. Current advice is that dietary adherence is necessary to avoid the long-term complications, which are, principally, osteoporosis and small bowel lymphoma. However, risk of these complications diminishes very considerably in patients who are on a gluten-free diet.},

   abstract = {OBJECTIVE: Analytical methods for measurements of gluten in the low level range of 20-200 ppm of gluten, as required for gluten-free food, have never been endorsed by the Codex Alimentarius. With the aim of investigating standardized and reliable methods for the detection of gliadin in food with detection limits lower than 200 ppm, as proposed by the Codex Alimentarius, the Working Group on Prolamin Analysis and Toxicity (WGPAT) coordinated a large collaborative study to validate a monoclonal antibody based ELISA, which uses an antibody (R5) against rye secalins. METHODS: Twelve food samples in which gliadin was present in the range of 0-168 ppm were analysed with two different commercially available R5 ELISA tests and a special extraction solvent, based on a reducing and a dissociating agent designed to extract heat denatured proteins. Twenty laboratories participated in this study. RESULTS: Recovery values ranged from 65 to 110% in general. The repeatability (RSDr) and reproducibility (RSDR) figures ranged between 13 and 25, resp. 23 and 47 for one test, and between 11 and 22, resp. 25 and 33 for the other. CONCLUSION: Both assays are comparable and robust. The repeatability and reproducibility data are in a range that is acceptable for ELISAs. Kits from both suppliers fulfilled performance criteria of regular ELISA methods, and it is shown that both ELISA kits guarantee a sensitivity of 1.5 ppm gliadin for gluten-free food.},

   abstract = {Man ingests food to mitigate hunger (mediated by physiological and biochemical signals), satisfy appetite (subjective sensation) and because of psychosocial reasons. Satiation biomarkers (stop feeding) are gastric distention and hormones (CCK, GLP-1) and satiety biomarkers (induce feeding) are food-induced thermogenesis, body temperature, glycaemia and also hormones (insulin, leptin and ghrelin). Oxidative metabolism/body composition, tryptophan/serotonin and proinflammatory cytokines are also implicated on hunger physiology. At the present time, ghrelin is the only known circulating orexigenic with potential on hunger/body weight regulation. It is a neuropeptide (endogenous ligand for the GH secretagogue) recently isolated from the oxyntic mucosa and synthesized mainly in the stomach. Its blood concentration depends on diet, hyperglucemia and adiposity/leptin. It is secreted 1-2 hours preprandially and its concentration decreases drastically during the postprandium. Ghrelin acts on the lateral hypothalamus and theoretically inhibits proinflammatory cytokine secretion and antagonizes leptin. Ghrelin physiologically increases food intake and stimulates adipogenesis, gastrointestinal motility and gastric acid secretion, and has other hormonal and cardiovascular functions. Ghrelin blood concentration is reduced in massive obesity, non-alcoholic steatohepatitis, polycystic ovary syndrome, acromegaly, hypogonadism, ageing, short bowel syndrome and rheumatoid arthritis; and increased in primary or secondary anorexia, starvation, chronic liver disease and celiac disease. Cerebral and peritoneal ghrelin administration (rats) and systemic administration (rats and healthy volunteers, cancer patients or patients on peritoneal dialysis) promotes food consumption and increases adiposity, of utmost importance in the treatment of patients with anorexia.},

   abstract = {BACKGROUND AND AIMS: Celiac disease is a prevalent disorder characterized by a chronic intestinal inflammation driven by HLA-DQ2 or -DQ8-restricted T cells specific for ingested wheat gluten peptides. The dominant T-cell responses are to epitopes that cluster within a stable 33mer fragment formed by physiologic digestion of distinct alpha-gliadins. Celiac disease is treated by excluding all gluten proteins from the diet. Conceivably, a diet based on baking-quality gluten from a wheat species that expresses no or few T-cell stimulatory gluten peptides should be equally well tolerated by the celiac patients and, importantly, also be beneficial for disease prevention. METHODS: To identify baking quality, harmless wheat, we followed the evolution of the wheat back to the species that most likely have contributed the AA, BB, and DD genomes to the bread wheat. Gluten were extracted from a large collection of these ancient wheat species and screened for T-cell stimulatory gluten peptides. RESULTS: Distinct differences in the intestinal T-cell responses to the diploid species were identified. Interestingly, we found that the fragments identical or equivalent to the immunodominant 33mer fragment are encoded by alpha-gliadin genes on the wheat chromosome 6D and thus absent from gluten of diploid einkorn (AA) and even certain cultivars of the tetraploid (AABB) pasta wheat. CONCLUSIONS: These findings have implications for celiac disease because they raise the prospect of identifying or producing by breeding wheat species with low or absent levels of harmful gluten proteins.},

   abstract = {Coeliac disease frequency increases by obscure reasons and affects in some Western countries as much as 1% of the populations. The second one of monozygotic twins does not develop the disease in 100% but only in 20-50%. To unravel these mysteries, literature was searched to determine the disease background and find suggestions for research and prevention. The causal antigen of coeliac disease is gluten of wheat that is neutralised in the intestine by secretory immune globulin A (sIgA). SIgA is secreted by the secondary (lymphoid) immune system that develops in a newborn infant after the primary (central) immune organs thymus and bone marrow have been primed with antigens of the intestine. Predisposed infants are sensitive for development of coeliac disease during the time without sIgA secretion into the intestine. The risk of the disease diminishes when sIgA cycles of gluten neutralisation develop. Peyer's patches (PP) of the secondary immune system play a central role in the cycles and possibly do not function well in the case of coeliac disease. Coeliac disease in predisposed infants may be prevented by delay of bread consumption till the time of normal sIgA secretion and by application of a challenge period with gluten (see Discussion). It is concluded that sIgA secretion into body cavities and malfunction of immune cells in PP should be included in the future research of coeliac disease as well as in more allergic diseases (type 1 diabetes, Crohn disease, asthma, hay fever).},

   abstract = {It has been shown that glucagon like peptide-1 (GLP-1) acts on the central nervous system (CNS), in addition to its peripheral actions. Central administration of glucagon like peptide-1 (GLP-1) delays liquid gastric emptying via non-adrenergic, non-cholinergic neurons in rats. However, it remains unclear how central GLP-1 delays solid gastric emptying in rats. GLP-1 receptors at the CNS mediates the endocrine and anxiety responses to psychogenic and interoceptive stress. Corticotropin-releasing factor (CRF) is also known as a stress-related peptide, which delays gastric emptying of liquid and solid food via the autonomic nervous system. We have recently showed that central CRF delays solid gastric emptying via sympathetic pathways in rats. However, it remains unknown how central GLP-1 and CRF interact in mediating the inhibitory effect on solid gastric emptying. After a 24 h-fasting, GLP-1 was administered by intracisternal (ic)-injection immediately after the solid meal ingestion. Ninety minutes after the peptide injection, gastric contents were measured. Ic-injection of GLP-1 (30-3000 pmol) dose-dependently inhibited solid gastric emptying. Ic-injection of GLP-1 (3000 pmol)-induced delay of gastric emptying was partially antagonized by celiac ganglionectomy but not by atropine or N(G)-nitro-l-arginine methyl ester (L-NAME). Ic-injection of a CRF antagonist, astressin (2.8 nmol), partially antagonized GLP-1-induced delay of solid gastric emptying. These results indicate that central CRF and peripheral sympathetic pathway are, at least in part, involved in mediating central GLP-1-induced delay of solid gastric emptying in rats.},

   abstract = {The cytokine pattern of T lymphocytes has not been characterized in children with combinations of paediatric immunological disorders. We describe cytokine secretion in children with type 1 diabetes, coeliac disease and allergy and combinations of two of these diseases after stimulation with 'disease-specific' antigens. Peripheral blood mononuclear cells (PBMC) were collected from 68 children with type 1 diabetes, allergy or coeliac disease, two of these diseases in combination or none of these diseases. Using the enzyme-linked immunospot (ELISPOT) technique, interferon (IFN)-gamma and interleukin (IL)-4 were analysed from fresh PBMC spontaneously and after in vitro stimulation with antigens associated with one or more of these diseases (insulin, gluten, birch and cat extract, beta-lactoglobulin, ovalbumin and phytohaemagglutinin) in order to divide T helper (Th)1- from Th2-like lymphocytes. Stimulation with birch and cat extract caused increased IL-4 secretion in allergic children. A low IFN-gamma response to insulin was found in type 1 diabetic children, whereas allergic children responded to insulin by increased IL-4 secretion. Children suffering from both type 1 diabetes (Th1-prone) and allergy (Th2-prone) reacted distinctly to general mitogen stimulation. Children suffering from two Th1-dominated diseases (type 1 diabetes and coeliac disease) showed hardly any response to either food or inhalation allergens. Our results indicate an important interplay between common immunological diseases in children. The combination of two Th1-deviated diseases is associated with a suppressed immune response, whereas a combination of Th1- and Th2-dominated diseases appears to increase the general immune response.},

   abstract = {CONTEXT: While gluten ingestion is responsible for the signs and symptoms of celiac disease, it is not known what factors are associated with initial appearance of the disease. OBJECTIVE: To examine whether the timing of gluten exposure in the infant diet was associated with the development of celiac disease autoimmunity (CDA). DESIGN, SETTING, AND PATIENTS: Prospective observational study conducted in Denver, Colo, from 1994-2004 of 1560 children at increased risk for celiac disease or type 1 diabetes, as defined by possession of either HLA-DR3 or DR4 alleles, or having a first-degree relative with type 1 diabetes. The mean follow-up was 4.8 years. MAIN OUTCOME MEASURE: Risk of CDA defined as being positive for tissue transglutaminase (tTG) autoantibody on 2 or more consecutive visits or being positive for tTG once and having a positive small bowel biopsy for celiac disease, by timing of introduction of gluten-containing foods into the diet. RESULTS: Fifty-one children developed CDA. Findings adjusted for HLA-DR3 status indicated that children exposed to foods containing wheat, barley, or rye (gluten-containing foods) in the first 3 months of life (3 [6%] CDA positive vs 40 [3%] CDA negative) had a 5-fold increased risk of CDA compared with children exposed to gluten-containing foods at 4 to 6 months (12 [23%] CDA positive vs 574 [38%] CDA negative) (hazard ratio [HR], 5.17; 95% confidence interval [CI], 1.44-18.57). Children not exposed to gluten until the seventh month or later (36 [71%] CDA positive vs 895 [59%] CDA negative) had a marginally increased risk of CDA compared with those exposed at 4 to 6 months (HR, 1.87; 95% CI, 0.97-3.60). After restricting our case group to only the 25 CDA-positive children who had biopsy-diagnosed celiac disease, initial exposure to wheat, barley, or rye in the first 3 months (3 [12%] CDA positive vs 40 [3%] CDA negative) or in the seventh month or later (19 [76%] CDA positive vs 912 [59%] CDA negative) significantly increased risk of CDA compared with exposure at 4 to 6 months (3 [12%] CDA positive vs 583 [38%] CDA negative) (HR, 22.97; 95% CI, 4.55-115.93; P = .001; and HR, 3.98; 95% CI, 1.18-13.46; P = .04, respectively). CONCLUSION: Timing of introduction of gluten into the infant diet is associated with the appearance of CDA in children at increased risk for the disease.},

   abstract = {UNLABELLED: The aim of this study was to evaluate the concept that pancreatic dysfunction in patients having gluten sensitivity (celiac disease [CD]) or cow's milk protein enteropathy (CMPE) may result from the lack of pancreatic enzyme stimulation in the absence or decrease of cholecystokinin (CCK) secretion caused by villous atrophy. PATIENTS AND METHODS: The following parameters were measured: plasma CCK in response to a fatty meal and human pancreatic fecal elastase in 24 patients with CD while on gluten-free diet and after gluten provocation and in 12 patients with CMPE at diagnosis and after a 6-month period of cow's milk-free diet. Intestinal mucosa morphology was examined by small bowel biopsy. Sixty-three controls having no organic gastrointestinal problems were investigated once at the time of diagnostic evaluation. RESULTS: Fasting CCK, obtained at a time when patients with CD or CMPE had normal intestinal mucosa, was significantly different from postprandial and comparable to that of the control group. Fasting CCK obtained from patients with villous atrophy was also statistically different, but not significantly, from the postprandial. Fasting and postprandial plasma CCK and fecal pancreatic elastase values from patients having normal intestinal mucosa were significantly higher than those obtained from patients with villous atrophy. Significant correlation of intestinal mucosa morphology and CCK with fecal elastase concentration was documented. CONCLUSION: Exocrine pancreatic dysfunction in individuals having villous atrophy may be the consequence of decreased CCK secretion. Cholecystokinin and pancreatic secretion is restored to normal, with intestinal mucosa regeneration.},

   abstract = {BACKGROUND & AIMS: Patients with celiac disease (CD) who do not improve or exhibit villous atrophy on a gluten-free diet may have type 1 refractory CD (RCD) with a polyclonal mucosal T-cell infiltrate, or type 2 RCD with a monoclonal infiltrate, also termed cryptic T-cell lymphoma. Both conditions are difficult to treat. Here we describe the effects of a nonimmunogenic elemental diet on clinical symptoms and mucosal immunopathology in type 1 RCD. METHODS: Ten CD patients on a strict gluten-free diet were diagnosed with type 1 RCD after extensive clinical evaluation in a tertiary referral hospital. A 4-week amino-acid-based liquid elemental diet regimen was given with no other treatment, except in 1 patient who also received methotrexate. Duodenal biopsy specimens were obtained before and after treatment for histologic assessment, immunophenotyping of intraepithelial lymphocytes, T-cell receptor clonality, mucosal interleukin (IL)-15 expression, flow-cytometric analysis of interferon (IFN)-gamma-secreting T cells, and whole biopsy specimen IFN-gamma messenger RNA determination. RESULTS: Nine patients completed the treatment; however, 1 patient did not tolerate the diet. Histologic improvement and reduced epithelial IL-15 were seen in 8 patients, whereas IFN-gamma-secreting mucosal T cells and IFN-gamma messenger RNA levels decreased in 4 and 7 patients, respectively. Clinical improvement was noted in 6 patients, with 1 patient showing normalization of hypoalbuminemia. Three patients could discontinue their total parenteral nutrition. CONCLUSIONS: Persistent mucosal IFN-gamma and IL-15 production often occurs in type 1 RCD despite conventional treatment. Elemental diet is a therapeutic option that can provide long-term immunopathologic and clinical improvement of this difficult condition.},

   abstract = {BACKGROUND: Gastrointestinal hypersensitivity to cow milk (CM) may be more common among school-aged children and young adults than previously thought. OBJECTIVE: The objective was to study various gastrointestinal complaints and the immunologic mechanisms associated with food-related, especially CM-related, gastrointestinal disorders in young adults. DESIGN: Of 827 subjects aged 16-21 y who completed a questionnaire on food-related gastrointestinal symptoms, 49 symptomatic subjects agreed to a clinical examination, including an interview, blood tests, a lactose-maldigestion test, a blinded CM challenge and, in severely symptomatic subjects (n = 12), an endoscopic examination. Twenty-nine subjects served as controls. RESULTS: Approximately 10% of the subjects reported having major gastrointestinal symptoms, mainly food-related (n = 70 of 86), during the preceding year. Specific organic disease was found in 2 symptomatic subjects: 1 case of celiac disease and 1 of colitis. The result of the lactose-maldigestion test was positive in 16 of the remaining 47 symptomatic subjects, but only 4 carried the C/C(-13910) genotype for adult-type hypolactasia. The symptomatic subjects had restricted their consumption of certain foods, particularly CM. However, in a blinded challenge, CM-induced symptoms were rare. The symptomatic subjects had higher plasma soluble intercellular adhesion molecule 1 (P = 0.007) and lower granzyme A (P = 0.001) concentrations than did the control subjects. Duodenal biopsy samples tended to have higher intraepithelial CD3(+) cell counts (P = 0.065) and a higher expression of transforming growth factor beta (P = 0.073) and interleukin 12p35 messenger RNA (P = 0.075) than did the control subjects. CONCLUSIONS: In an unselected cohort of young adults, 8% reported food-related gastrointestinal symptoms. The finding of immunologic activity implied the existence of a food-related gastrointestinal syndrome but not one induced by CM.},

   abstract = {Celiac disease is a chronic inflammatory disease developing in genetically predisposed individuals. Ingested gliadin, the triggering agent of the disease, can cross the epithelial barrier and elicit a harmful T cell-mediated immune response. Dendritic cells (DC) are supposed to play a pivotal role in shaping the immune response. The direction of the immune response toward immunity or tolerance depends on the stage of maturation and the functional properties of the DC. DC become fully functional APC upon maturation by various stimuli. We investigated the effect of a peptic digest of gliadin on the maturation of human monocyte-derived DC. Stimulation of cells with gliadin, in contrast with other tested food proteins, led to enhanced expression of maturation markers (CD80, CD83, CD86, and HLA-DR molecules) and increased secretion of chemokines and cytokines (mainly of IL-6, IL-8, IL-10, TNF-alpha, growth-related oncogene, MCP-1, MCP-2, macrophage-derived chemokine, and RANTES). Maturation was accompanied by a greater capacity to stimulate proliferation of allogeneic T cells and significantly reduced endocytic activity. Furthermore, gliadin-induced phosphorylation of members of three MAPK families (ERK1/2, JNK, and p38 MAPK) was demonstrated. The largest contribution of p38 MAPK was confirmed using its inhibitor SB203580, which markedly down-regulated the gliadin-triggered up-regulation of maturation markers and cytokine production. Gliadin treatment also resulted in increased NF-kappaB/DNA binding activity of p50 and p65 subunits. Taken together, gliadin peptides can contribute to overcoming the stage of unresponsiveness of immature DC by inducing phenotypic and functional DC maturation, resulting in more efficient processing and presentation of gliadin peptides to specific T lymphocytes.},

A small percentage of subjects positive for these antibodies have a small intestinal mucosa hitherto considered normal. OBJECTIVES: The aim of this study was to characterize the clinical, serological, immunogenetic, and immunohistological features of these subjects. METHODS: From 409 patients who were positive for celiac-related antibodies, we selected 24 (5.9%) patients who had an architecturally normal small intestinal mucosa. One hundred age-matched celiac patients with a "flat" small intestinal mucosa, and 50 age-matched nonceliac children were also studied. The number of CD3+ and gammadelta+ intraepithelial lymphocytes and of CD25+ lamina propria mononuclear cells, and the expression of crypt HLA-DR and lamina propria ICAM-1 were assessed. HLA haplotyping was also performed. RESULTS: Eleven (45.8%) of the 24 patients had a distinct infiltrative pattern, i.e., an increase in CD3+ intraepithelial lymphocytes (> 2SD of the nonceliac group), whereas 17 (70.8%) had a higher density of intraepithelial gammadelta+ cells. In 17 (70.8%) patients, the number of lamina propria CD25+ cells was increased and/or the expression of ICAM-1 and crypt HLA-DR was enhanced. All 24 patients carried the celiac disease-associated HLA haplotypes. Two of the six patients who remained on a normal diet and underwent a second jejunal biopsy developed villous atrophy. CONCLUSIONS: Most of the patients with serum antiendomysium antibodies and normal jejunal histology showed immunohistochemical signs of immune activation in the epithelium, lamina propria, and crypts. We recommend that such patients be monitored to assess their progress and to determine whether they need a gluten-free diet.},

   abstract = {Gluten-free diet is the current treatment of celiac disease. We decided to verify the occurrence of histological and serological modification and/or clinical manifestations during a gradual and progressive introduction of gliadin in the diet and if it may induce a tolerance to food, as it occurs in allergic patients. We studied the case of a celiac woman with complete clinical and histological remittance after 10 years of gluten free diet. She took increasing daily doses of gliadin, reaching the final dose of 9 g of gliadin (15 g of gluten) in 6 months. Then she started a free dietary regimen. During the 15-month follow-up period esophago-gastro-duodenoscopy showed normal Kerckring folds and villi. Anti-gliadin, anti-endomysium and anti-tissue-transglutaminase antibodies, as well as the haematological and biochemical parameters remained normal. Our results represent a new approach in research concerning celiac disease, and could provide a future line of study for its management.},

   abstract = {Leptin is a hormone secreted into the systemic blood primarily by white adipose tissue. However, leptin also is synthesized and stored by cells in the gastric mucosa. Because gastric mucosal leptin is secreted in response to ingestion of a meal, we hypothesized that it might contribute to satiation (meal termination) by acting on gastrointestinal vagal afferent neurons. To test whether leptin is capable of acutely reducing short-term food intake, we measured consumption of a liquid meal (15% sucrose) following low-dose leptin administration via the celiac artery, which perfuses the upper gastrointestinal tract. Leptin (1, 3, 10 mug) was infused via a chronically implanted, nonocclusive celiac arterial catheter or via a jugular vein catheter with its tip in the right cardiac atrium. Fifteen percent sucrose intake was then measured for 30 min. We found that leptin dose dependently inhibited sucrose intake when infused through the celiac catheter but not when infused into the general circulation via a jugular catheter. Plasma leptin concentrations in the general circulation following celiac arterial or jugular leptin infusions were not significantly different. Celiac arterial leptin infusion did not reduce meal size in vagotomized or capsaicin-treated rats. Finally, we also found that reduction of meal size by celiac leptin infusion was markedly enhanced when coinfused with cholecystokinin, a gastrointestinal satiety peptide whose action depends on vagal afferent neurons. Our results support the hypothesis that leptin contributes to satiation by a mechanism dependent on gastrointestinal vagal afferent innervation of the upper gastrointestinal tract.},

   abstract = {Celiac disease is the only autoimmune condition for which we know the environmental trigger: gluten. Complete removal of gluten from the diet in a patient with celiac disease should result in symptomatic, serologic, and histologic remission. However, compliance with the gluten-free diet, especially in the United States, is extremely challenging. Compliance can be measured both noninvasively, by dietary history and measurement of serum antibodies, and invasively, by using endoscopic and histologic criteria. The advantages and disadvantages of these various modalities are discussed. The highest rates of compliance are reported in patients who are diagnosed as young children, whereas adolescents and those diagnosed via mass serologic screening have the most transgressions. Barriers to compliance include the poor palatability of gluten-free foods, confusing food-labeling practices, and common comorbid psychologic burdens such as anxiety and depression. Because celiac disease is a multisystemic disorder, physicians need to be aware of the potential autoimmune, nutritional, and malignant complications. An algorithm for the follow-up and management of the newly diagnosed celiac disease patient is presented, which includes regular follow-up; measurement of serum antibodies; eliciting a detailed dietary history; and examination for signs and symptoms of nutritional deficiencies, malignancy, and other autoimmune diseases. Ideally, a team approach to the follow-up of the newly diagnosed patient should include regular supervision by an interested physician, medical nutritional counseling by a registered dietician, and access to local and national support groups knowledgeable about this condition.},

   abstract = {OBJECTIVE: The treatment of celiac disease is based on lifelong withdrawal of foods containing gluten. Unfortunately, compliance with a gluten-free diet has proved poor in many patients (mainly due to its low palatability), emphasizing the need for cereal varieties that are not toxic for celiac patients. In evolutionary terms, Triticum monococcum is the oldest and most primitive cultivated wheat. The aim of this study was to evaluate the toxicity of T. monococcum on small intestinal mucosa, using an in vitro organ culture system. MATERIAL AND METHODS: Distal duodenum biopsies of 12 treated celiac patients and 17 control subjects were cultured for 24 h with T. aestivum (bread) gliadin (1 mg/ml) or with T. monococcum gliadin (1 mg/ml). Biopsies cultured with medium alone served as controls. Each biopsy was used for conventional histological examination and for immunohistochemical detection of CD3 + intraepithelial lymphocytes (IELs) and HLA-DR. Secreted cytokine protein interferon-gamma (IFN-gamma) was measured in the culture supernatant using an enzyme-linked immunoadsorbent assay. RESULTS: Significant morphological changes, HLA-DR overexpression in the crypt epithelium and an increased number of CD3 + IELs, found after bread gliadin exposure, were not observed in celiac biopsies cultured with T. monococcum gliadin. In contrast, with bread gliadin, there was no significant IFN-gamma response after culture with monococcum gliadin. Similarly, biopsies from normal controls did not respond to bread or monococcum gliadin stimulation. CONCLUSIONS: These data show a lack of toxicity of T. monococcum gliadin in an in vitro organ culture system, suggesting new dietary opportunities for celiac patients.},

   abstract = {OBJECTIVE: Early exposure to solid foods in infancy has been associated with the development of allergy. The aim of this study was to examine the association between cereal-grain exposures (wheat, barley, rye, oats) in the infant diet and development of wheat allergy. METHODS: A total of 1612 children were enrolled at birth and followed to the mean age of 4.7 years. Questionnaire data and dietary exposures were obtained at 3, 6, 9, 15, and 24 months and annually thereafter. The main outcome measure was parent report of wheat allergy. Children with celiac disease autoimmunity detected by tissue transglutaminase autoantibodies were excluded. Wheat-specific immunoglobulin E levels on children reported to have wheat allergy were obtained. RESULTS: Sixteen children (1%) reported wheat allergy. Children who were first exposed to cereals after 6 months of age had an increased risk of wheat allergy compared with children first exposed to cereals before 6 months of age (after controlling for confounders including a family history of allergic disorders and history of food allergy before 6 months of age). All 4 children with detectable wheat-specific immunoglobulin E were first exposed to cereal grains after 6 months. A first-degree relative with asthma, eczema, or hives was also independently associated with an increased risk of wheat-allergy development. CONCLUSIONS: Delaying initial exposure to cereal grains until after 6 months may increase the risk of developing wheat allergy. These results do not support delaying introduction of cereal grains for the protection of food allergy.},

   abstract = {BACKGROUND & AIMS: We sought to determine whether prolyl endopeptidase (PEP) treatment of food gluten would obviate the intestinal dysfunction produced by small amounts of dietary gluten supplement in patients with celiac sprue. METHODS: Twenty asymptomatic patients with histologically proven celiac sprue completed a randomized, double-blind, cross-over study involving two 14-day stages. Each patient consumed a low dose of a gluten supplement daily (5 g; equivalent to 1 slice of bread) in 1 stage and gluten pretreated with PEP in the other stage. Patients completed a daily symptom questionnaire and a D-xylose urine excretion and a 72-hour quantitative fecal fat were monitored before and after each stage. RESULTS: Despite clinical remission at baseline, 40% of patients had at least 1 abnormal celiac antibody, 20% had an abnormal urine xylose, and 63% had an abnormal fecal fat test result. There was no difference in symptoms as a function of the type of gluten consumed. In response to gluten not treated with PEP, an appreciable proportion of patients developed malabsorption of fat (7 of 17, 41%) or xylose (8 of 14, 57%). When the gluten was pretreated with PEP, fat malabsorption was avoided in 5 of 7 and xylose malabsorption in 4 of 8 of these same patients. CONCLUSIONS: A significant proportion of asymptomatic patients with celiac sprue have abnormal celiac antibodies and fat or carbohydrate malabsorption. Pretreatment of gluten with PEP avoided the development of fat or carbohydrate malabsorption in the majority of those patients who developed fat or carbohydrate malabsorption after a 2-week gluten challenge.},

   abstract = {OBJECTIVES: We sought to characterize the clinical features at presentation as well as the associated disorders, family history, and evaluation of compliance with a gluten-free diet in children with celiac disease from across Canada. STUDY DESIGN: All members (n = 5240) of the Canadian Celiac Association were surveyed with a questionnaire. Of the 2849 respondents with biopsy-confirmed celiac disease, 168 who were < 16 years old provided the data reported here. RESULTS: The mean age when surveyed was 9.1 +/- 4.1 years, and 58% were female. Median age at diagnosis was 3.0 years with a range of 1 to 15 years. Presenting symptoms included abdominal pain (90%), weight loss (71%), diarrhea (65%), weakness (64%), nausea/vomiting (53%), anemia (40%), mood swings (37%), and constipation (30%). Almost one third of families consulted > or = 2 pediatricians before confirmation of the diagnosis. Before the recognition of celiac disease, other diagnoses received by these children included anemia (15%), irritable bowel syndrome (11%), gastroesophageal reflux (8%), stress (8%), and peptic ulcer disease (4%). A serological test was performed to screen for celiac disease in 70% of those in this population. Eight percent had either type 1 diabetes mellitus or a first-degree relative with celiac disease. Almost all respondents (95%) reported strict adherence to a gluten-free diet, and 89% noted improved health. Reactions after accidental gluten ingestion developed in 54% of the children between 0.5 and 60 hours after ingestion with a median of 2.0 hours. Reactions included abdominal discomfort (87%), diarrhea (64%), bloating (57%), fatigue (37%), headache (24%), and constipation (8%), and most displayed > 1 symptom. Although most adjusted well to their disease and diet, 10% to 20% reported major disruptions in lifestyle. Twenty-three percent felt angry all or most of the time about following a gluten-free diet. Only 15% avoided traveling all or most of the time, and during travel, 83% brought gluten-free food with them all of the time. More than half of the families avoided restaurants all or most of the time. Twenty-eight percent of the respondents found it extremely difficult to locate stores with gluten-free foods, and 27% reported extreme difficulty in finding gluten-free foods or determining if foods were free of gluten. Sixty-three percent of the respondents felt that the information supplied by the Canadian Celiac Association was excellent. Gastroenterologists provided excellent information to 44%, dietitians to 36%, and the family physician to 11.5%. When asked to select 2 items that would improve their quality of life, better labeling of gluten-containing ingredients was selected by 63%, more gluten-free foods in the supermarket by 49%, gluten-free choices on restaurant menus by 49%, earlier diagnosis of celiac disease by 34%, and better dietary counseling by 7%. CONCLUSIONS: In Canada, children with celiac disease present at all ages with a variety of symptoms and associated conditions. Delays in diagnosis are common. Most children are compliant with a gluten-free diet. A minority of these children experience difficulties in modifying their lifestyles, and gluten-free foods remain difficult to obtain.},

   abstract = {AIMS: To characterize the peptide hydrolase system of Lactobacillus plantarum CRL 759 and CRL 778 and evaluate their proteolytic activity in reducing gliadin-like fractions. METHODS AND RESULTS: The intracellular peptide hydrolase system of Lact. plantarum CRL 759 and CRL 778 involves amino-, di- (DP), tri- (TP) and endopeptidase activities. These peptidases are metalloenzymes inhibited by EDTA and 1,10-phenanthroline and stimulated by Co2+. DP and TP activities of Lact. plantarum CRL 759 and CRL 778, respectively, were completely inhibited by Cu2+. Lactobacillus plantarum CRL 778 showed the highest proteolytic activity and amino acids release in fermented dough. The synthetic 31-43 alpha-gliadin fragment was hydrolysed to 36% and 73% by Lact. plantarum CRL 778 and CRL 759 respectively. CONCLUSIONS: Lactobacillus plantarum CRL 759 and CRL 778 have an active proteolytic system, which is responsible for the high amino acid release during sourdough fermentation and the hydrolysis of the 31-43 alpha-gliadin-like fragment. SIGNIFICANCE AND IMPACT OF THE STUDY: This work provides new information of use when obtaining sourdough starters for bread making. Moreover, knowledge regarding lactobacilli capable of reducing the level of gliadin-like fractions, a toxic peptide for coeliac patients, has a beneficial health impact.},

The identification of gluten-specific T cells in the lamina propria of celiacs and the strong association with HLA-DQ2 and -DQ8 genes support a central role of CD4(+) T cells in CD pathogenesis. Studies focused on the modulation of autoimmunity in different experimental models highlighted possible immune therapeutic protocols useful also for the management of CD. On the basis of these observations, a series of strategies have been designed: some of them are based on the identification of immunogenic epitopes and their suppression via enzymatic treatment or by using peptide analogues; others rely on the delivery of unmodified antigen through the nasal route or coadministered with downregulatory cytokines. studies are generally early stage but encouraging in paving a way for an alternative treatment for celiac disease.},

However, this tolerance plan sometimes fails and in the final steps of this immunological dysreaction, other cellular elements, usual residents of the digestive mucous, such as eosinophil granulocytes, generally participate, together with the main cells of this system. This is the case, among others, of the so-called EGE-Eos. The authors summarize the spectrum of pathogenic options of these immunological food intolerances that range from those in which "all" depend on a specific IgE (GI food anaphylaxis) and those others in which "nothing" depends on this reagin (celiac sprue). An intermediate position would be occupied by the EGE-Eos in which there seems to be overlapping of immune reactions of cellular character together with a certain role of the IgE. These pathogenic pathways frequently cross a tangle of cellular and molecular events that cannot be untangled with either an image or one thousand words.},

   abstract = {PURPOSE OF REVIEW: This review discusses the long-term health effects of breast feeding, based on the most relevant publications from the second half of 2004 and 2005. RECENT FINDINGS: The positive effect of breast feeding on later cognitive function continues to be the most consistent and important effect. Also, breast feeding is likely to protect against some immune-related diseases later in life, such as type 1 diabetes, coeliac disease, inflammatory bowel diseases and perhaps cancer. The evidence for an effect on allergic disease continues to be inconclusive. Furthermore, breast feeding seems to be associated with a lower blood pressure and serum cholesterol, but there is no clear association with cardiovascular disease or death. Most new studies and meta-analyses show a protective effect against later obesity, but this seems to be small. A new hypothesis suggests that breast feeding programmes the insulin-like growth factor axis and results in higher growth velocity later in childhood. SUMMARY: Evidence is increasing that breast feeding, beyond its well-established beneficial effects during the breast-feeding period, also confers long-term benefits. These effects are not strong at the individual level, but are likely to be of importance at the population level. Since the majority of the studies are observational, however, it is difficult to prove causality.},

   abstract = {Celiac sprue (also known as celiac disease) is an inheritable, gluten-induced enteropathy of the upper small intestine with an estimated prevalence of 0.5%-1% in most parts of the world. The ubiquitous nature of food gluten, coupled with inadequate labeling regulations in most countries, constantly poses a threat of disease exacerbation and relapse for patients. Here, we demonstrate that a two-enzyme cocktail comprised of a glutamine-specific cysteine protease (EP-B2) that functions under gastric conditions and a PEP, which acts in concert with pancreatic proteases under duodenal conditions, is a particularly potent candidate for celiac sprue therapy. At a gluten:EP-B2:PEP weight ratio of 75:3:1, grocery store gluten is fully detoxified within 10 min of simulated duodenal conditions, as judged by chromatographic analysis, biopsy-derived T cell proliferation assays, and a commercial antigluten antibody test.},

   abstract = {Celiac disease is a disorder of the small intestine caused by an inappropriate immune response to wheat gluten and similar proteins of barley and rye. At present, the only available treatment is a strict gluten-exclusion diet; hence the need for alternative treatments. Recent advances have improved our understanding of the molecular basis for this disorder and there are several attractive targets for new treatments. Oral enzyme supplementation is designed to accelerate gastrointestinal degradation of proline-rich gluten, especially its proteolytically stable antigenic peptides. Complementary strategies aiming to interfere with activation of gluten-reactive T cells include the inhibition of intestinal tissue transglutaminase activity to prevent selective deamidation of gluten peptides, and blocking the binding of gluten peptides to the HLA-DQ2 or HLA-DQ8 molecules. Other possible treatments include cytokine therapy, and selective adhesion molecule inhibitors that interfere with inflammatory reactions, some of which are already showing promise in the clinic for other gastrointestinal diseases.},

More recently, for its implication as the major autoantigen in the coeliac disease, availability of human tissue transglutaminase as recombinant form is required for accurate diagnostic tests. The aim of this study was to find an alternative and inexpensive source to produce human tissue transglutaminase. To date, plant systems are proposed as heterologous hosts to produce recombinant proteins for use in disease diagnosis and therapy. Here, we describe the stable expression of human tissue transglutaminase into Nicotiana tabacum cultured cells (cultivar Bright Yellow 2 (BY-2)). The recombinant enzyme was successfully expressed in different plant cell compartments and both apoplast (apo) and chloroplast (chl) purified proteins were shown to be catalytically active and able to bind GTP, a property possessed by the natural counterpart. Importantly, plant produced human tissue transglutaminase recognized autoantibodies in the serum of coeliac patients, suggesting possible applications in the diagnosis of coeliac disease.},

   abstract = {Patients complaining of 'chronic diarrhoea' usually mean the passage of loose, urgent stools. Chronic diarrhoea is a feature of malabsorption; it may also be seen in the 'dumping syndrome' which follows gastric surgery, small intestinal bacterial overgrowth, bile salt malabsorption and in malabsorption of simple sugars including most commonly lactose, fructose and sorbitol. Excessively rapid entry of chyme into the small or large intestine generates propulsive motor patterns leading to accelerated transit. Inflammation is associated with decreased normal mixing motor patterns but increased propulsive motility including high amplitude propagated contractions (HAPCs). Evidence for abnormal small intestinal motility in the diarrhoea associated with irritable bowel syndrome (IBS) is conflicting and any difference appears small. Increased colonic HAPCs with increased propulsion is seen in IBS with diarrhoea (IBS-D). Stress-induced colonic motility is increased in IBS-D with hyper-responsiveness to corticotrophin releasing factor (CRF). Long-lasting increases in mucosal serotonin availability may contribute to the chronic diarrhoea seen in IBS-D and coeliac disease. Treatments for abnormal motility in chronic diarrhoea include those designed to correct specific underlying abnormalities including octreotide, antibiotics, colestyramine, specific food avoidance and anti-inflammatory agents. There are also treatments aimed primarily at altering motility directly including opiates, 5HT3 receptor antagonists and amitriptyline.},

Affinity chromatography experiments together with mass spectrometry experiments demonstrated that GlnBP can bind the following amino acid sequence XXQPQPQQQQQQQQQQQQL. Sequence alignment experiments pointed out that this sequence is exclusively representative of the gliadin and the other prolamines considered toxic for celiac patients.

   abstract = {PURPOSE OF REVIEW: The default response to protein antigens in the intestine is the induction of systemic and local hyporesponsiveness, ensuring the prevention of coeliac disease and food allergies. Interest is increasing in the role of dietary manipulation and probiotics in treating allergic and other diseases, but less is known about how these regimens might influence systemic and local immune responses. This paper addresses the mechanisms at the interface of innate and adaptive immunity that determine how the body responds to orally administered proteins and how local bacteria modify these. RECENT FINDINGS: This paper discusses evidence that dendritic cells in the intestinal mucosa are the critical cells that take up dietary proteins and migrate to the draining mesenteric lymph node, where they induce regulatory CD4 T-cell differentiation. The properties of tolerized T cells are discussed and it is proposed that the gut microenvironment maintains homeostasis by conditioning dendritic cells to remain in a quiescent state. Inhibitory signalling by commensal bacteria possibly contributes to this process. SUMMARY: A regulatory network controls how dietary antigens are taken up and presented to T lymphocytes by specialized antigen-presenting cells. Elucidating their nature and how they are influenced by external factors such as probiotics may help develop novel therapies for allergy and help understand diseases such as coeliac disease.},

METHODS: We interviewed 43 informants, aged 20-40 years, using 'The Critical Incident Technique'. Interviews focused on situations that gave rise to confusion or discomfort in relation to disease. The interviews were transcribed verbatim and analysed qualitatively. RESULTS: We found 195 dilemmas, experienced in five arenas: food situation at work, during purchases, when travelling, in relation to meals at home and meals outside the home. Emotions, relationships and the management of daily life were the three main categories of dilemmas that emerged through the analysis. Specific emotions were experienced in relation to the disease, such as isolation, shame, fear of becoming contaminated by gluten and worries about being a bother. In the relationship with other persons the informants experienced a number of complicating dilemmas such as unwanted visibility, neglect, being forgotten, disclosure avoidance and risk taking. Dilemmas related to the management of daily life were restricted product choice, double work and constantly being on call. CONCLUSIONS: The lived experiences of coeliac disease were more varied and profound than expected. It is important to take psychological and social aspects into account in the treatment of patients with coeliac disease.},

   abstract = {OBJECTIVE: This survey was conducted to assess nutrient intakes and food consumption patterns of adults with coeliac disease who adhere to a strict gluten-free diet. DESIGN: Three-day estimated self-reported food records were used to assess daily intakes of calories, percent daily calories from carbohydrates, dietary fibre, iron, calcium and grain food servings. SUBJECTS: Volunteers for this survey were recruited through notices placed in coeliac disease support group newsletters, as well as a national magazine for persons with coeliac disease. Forty-seven volunteers met all criteria for participation and returned useable food records. RESULTS: Group mean daily intake of nutrients by gender: Males (n = 8): 2882 calories; 55% carbohydrate; 24.3 g dietary fibre; 14.7 mg iron; 1288.8 mg calcium; 6.6 grain food servings. Females (n = 39): 1900 calories; 52% carbohydrate; 20.2 g dietary fibre; 11.0 mg iron; 884.7 mg calcium; 4.6 grain food servings. Recommended amounts of fibre, iron and calcium were consumed by 46, 44 and 31% of women and 88, 100 and 63% of men, respectively. CONCLUSIONS: Nutrition therapy for coeliac disease has centred around food allowed/not allowed on a gluten-free diet. Emphasis also should be placed on the nutritional quality of the gluten-free diet, particularly as it concerns the iron, calcium and fibre consumption of women. The use of the estimated food record as the dietary survey method may have resulted in the under-reporting of energy intake. Due to the small sample size and possible bias of survey participants, the findings of this survey may not be representative of the larger coeliac community.},

   abstract = {Initial events and effector mechanisms of most inflammatory and autoimmune diseases remain largely unknown. Dysfunction of the innate and adaptive immune systems associated with mucosae (the major interface between the organism and its environment, e.g., microbiota, food) can conceivably cause impairment of mucosal barrier function and development of localized or systemic inflammatory and autoimmune processes. Animal models help in elucidating the etiology and pathogenetic mechanisms of human diseases, such as the inflammatory bowel diseases, Crohn's disease and ulcerative colitis, severe chronic diseases affecting the gut. To study the role of innate immunity and gut microbiota in intestinal inflammation, colitis was induced by dextran sulfate sodium (DSS) in mice with severe combined immunodeficiency (SCID). Conventionally reared (microflora-colonized) SCID mice displayed severe inflammation like that seen in immunocompetent Balb/c mice, whereas only minor changes appeared in the intestinal mucosa of DSS-fed gnotobiotic germ-free SCID mice. The presence of microflora facilitates the inflammation in DSS-induced colitis that develops in immunodeficient SCID mice, that is, in the absence of T and B lymphocytes. Celiac disease, a chronic autoimmune small bowel disorder, afflicts genetically susceptible individuals with wheat gluten intolerance. We showed that, in contrast with any other food proteins, wheat gliadin and its peptic fragments activate mouse macrophages and human monocytes to produce proinflammatory cytokines through the nuclear factor-kappaB signaling pathway. Activation of innate immunity cells by food proteins or components from gut microbiota thus could participate in the impairment of intestinal mucosa and the development of intestinal and/or systemic inflammation.},

   abstract = {Celiac axis compression syndrome has generated much controversy since its original description in 1963. The main symptoms are postprandial epigastric abdominal pain, regurgitation of undigested food, and weight loss, all of which are caused by gastric ischemia from impingement of the celiac axis by the median arcuate ligament of the diaphragm. These symptoms are seen in other common disorders such as chronic mesenteric ischemia and gastroparesis. This makes the diagnosis of celiac axis compression syndrome a true challenge for the clinician. We present data on three patients successfully treated. The pre- and postoperative studies clearly demonstrate a resolution of the condition. The duplex ultrasound images clearly show variable compression on the celiac axis. The angiogram presented shows a classic image of the disease. A review of the data has enabled us to develop an algorithm for the diagnosis of this disease.},

   abstract = {BACKGROUND: Bread wheat (Triticum aestivum) is an important staple food. However, wheat gluten proteins cause celiac disease (CD) in 0.5 to 1% of the general population. Among these proteins, the alpha-gliadins contain several peptides that are associated to the disease. RESULTS: We obtained 230 distinct alpha-gliadin gene sequences from severaldiploid wheat species representing the ancestral A, B, and D genomes of the hexaploid bread wheat. The large majority of these sequences (87%) contained an internal stop codon. All alpha-gliadin sequences could be distinguished according to the genome of origin on the basis of sequence similarity, of the average length of the polyglutamine repeats, and of the differences in the presence of four peptides that have been identified as T cell stimulatory epitopes in CD patients through binding to HLA-DQ2/8. By sequence similarity, alpha-gliadins from the public database of hexaploid T. aestivum could be assigned directly to chromosome 6A, 6B, or 6D. T. monococcum (A genome) sequences, as well as those from chromosome 6A of bread wheat, almost invariably contained epitope glia-alpha9 and glia-alpha20, but never the intact epitopes glia-alpha and glia-alpha2. A number of sequences from T. speltoides, as well as a number of sequences fromchromosome 6B of bread wheat, did not contain any of the four T cell epitopes screened for. The sequences from T. tauschii (D genome), as well as those from chromosome 6D of bread wheat, were found to contain all of these T cell epitopes in variable combinations per gene. The differences in epitope composition resulted mainly from point mutations. These substitutions appeared to be genome specific. CONCLUSION: Our analysis shows that alpha-gliadin sequences from the three genomes of bread wheat form distinct groups. The four known T cell stimulatory epitopes are distributed non-randomly across the sequences, indicating that the three genomes contribute differently to epitope content. A systematic analysis of all known epitopes in gliadins and glutenins will lead to better understanding of the differences in toxicity among wheat varieties. On the basis of such insight, breeding strategies can be designed to generate less toxic varieties of wheat which may be tolerated by at least part of the CD patient population.},

   abstract = {BACKGROUND: The benefits of serologic screening for coeliac disease in asymptomatic individuals are debatable. AIM: To investigate dietary compliance, quality of life and bone mineral density after long-term treatment in coeliac disease patients found by screening in risk groups. METHODS: The study comprised 53 consecutive screen-detected coeliac patients diagnosed 14 years (median) ago. Dietary compliance was assessed by interview, 4-day food record and serology. Quality of life was evaluated by the Psychological General Well-Being and SF-36 questionnaires, gastrointestinal symptoms by the Gastrointestinal Symptom Rating Scale and bone mineral density by dual-energy x-ray absorptiometry. Comparisons were made to 44 symptom-detected-treated coeliac patients, 110 non-coeliac subjects and the general population. RESULTS: A total of 96% of screen-detected and 93% of symptom-detected coeliac patients adhered to a strict or fairly strict gluten-free diet. In screen-detected patients, quality of life and gastrointestinal symptoms were similar to those in symptom-detected patients or non-coeliac controls and bone mineral density was similar to that in the general population. CONCLUSIONS: Long-term dietary compliance in screen-detected patients was good. Quality of life and bone mineral density were comparable with those in non-coeliac subjects and the general population. Active screening in coeliac disease risk groups seems to be reasonable rather than harmful.},

Here, we investigated 6000 randomly selected children from the large All Babies in Southeast Sweden (ABIS) cohort, including 17 055 newborns recruited between 1997 and 1999. Questionnaires at birth and at 1 yr of age and the levels of autoantibodies to glutamic acid decarboxylase (GADA) and autoantibodies to tyrosine phosphatase (IA-2A) at 1 yr of age were analyzed. The 99th percentile cutoff for autoantibodies was proposed to identify children at risk of type 1 diabetes (T1D) and the 90th percentile cutoff to identify children in whom beta-cell autoimmunity has been induced. Using the 90th percentile cutoff level, 1156 children had either IA-2A (n = 574) or GADA (n = 582), while 126 children had both GADA and IA-2A. When the 99th percentile cutoff level was used, 114 children had either IA-2A (n = 57) or GADA (n = 57), and six children had both GADA and IA-2A. In logistic regression analysis, celiac disease in grandparents [odds ratio (OR) 2.2] and maternal gastrointestinal infection (OR 1.1) represented a risk for simultaneous occurrence of both IA-2A and GADA above the 90th percentile. Birth in spring (March to May) (OR 1.5) and male gender (OR 1.3) were risk factors for induction of IA-2A. Mother's low education represented a risk for induction of IA-2A (OR 1.5) and GADA (OR 1.4). T1D in first-degree relatives increased the risk for beta-cell autoimmunity above the 99th percentile (OR 2.6), whereas type 2 diabetes in grandparents was associated with GADA (OR 2.1). Exposure to cow's milk formulas <2 months of age implied an OR of 2.9 for IA-2A above the 99th percentile.},

A total of 657 children had either IA-2A (n 360) or GADA (n 335), and thirty-eight children had both GADA and IA-2A. In univariate analysis, male gender and maternal coeliac disease implied a risk of possessing IA-2A. Maternal type 2 diabetes, a high consumption of fresh cows milk at the age of 1 year and a late introduction of gluten were associated with a risk of GADA. Early cessation of breast-feeding (< 2 months of age) was associated with a risk of the simultaneous occurrence of both IA-2A and GADA. In logistic regression analysis, a high consumption of milk at the age of I year (odds ratio 2.6)represented a risk for GADA, and maternal coeliac disease (odds ratio 2.9) represented a risk for IA-2A. The combination of an early introduction of cows milk formula and a late introduction of gluten-containing food gave an odds ratio of 6.0 for positivity for at least one autoantibody at 1 and 21 years of age. The induction of autoantibodies by the age of 2(1/2) years has a male preponderance and is more common in children with maternal type 2 diabetes or maternal coeliac disease. Dietary risk factors for the induction of beta-cell autoantibodies in 21-year-old children are a short duration of breast-feeding, an early introduction of cows milk formula and a late introduction of gluten, as well as a high consumption of milk at the age of I year.},

   abstract = {Celiac disease is a gastrointestinal disorder characterized by inflammation, leading to injury to the mucosal lining of the small intestine. The inflammation occurs when gliadin, a protein found in such gluten-containing foods as wheat, rye, and barley, is ingested by genetically susceptible individuals. The mucosal damage and subsequent malabsorption of nutrients leads to various complications. Researchers estimate that more than 2 million people in the United States have celiac disease-a prevalence that is greater than was previously believed. Approximately 60,000 Americans are diagnosed annually with celiac disease. Until recently, diagnosis has been complicated by the fact that the indicators of celiac disease are nonspecific. However, because of the development of new, easy-to-administer serology tests, diagnosis has become much less complicated. After conducting a review of the literature, the authors recommend a serologic testing sequence for diagnosis of celiac disease and urge that adults and children with an assortment of symptoms be tested for this disease. Common signs and symptoms of celiac disease include anemia, arthralgia, fatigue, infertility, neuropathy, and weight loss, in addition to such gastrointestinal symptomatology as abdominal pain, anorexia, bloating, constipation, and diarrhea. The only treatment for patients with celiac disease remains a gluten-free diet.},

Data are presented on 2,681 adults (>or=16 years) with biopsy-proven celiac disease (CD). METHODS: A mail-out survey was used. Quality of life was evaluated using the 'SF12', and celiac-specific questions. RESULTS: Mean age was 56 years, mean age at diagnosis was 45 years, and 75% were female. The 'SF12' summary scores were similar to normative Canadian data, but were significantly lower for females and newly diagnosed patients. Respondents reported: following a gluten-free (GF) diet (90%), improvement on the diet (83%), and difficulties following the diet (44%), which included: determining if foods were GF (85%), finding GF foods in stores (83%), avoiding restaurants (79%), and avoiding travel (38%). Most common reactions to consumed gluten (among 73%) included pain, diarrhea, bloating, fatigue, nausea, and headache. Excellent information on CD and its treatment was provided by the CCA (64%), gastroenterologists (28%), dietitians (26%) and family doctor (12%). CONCLUSIONS: Quality of life in those with CD could be increased with early diagnosis, increased availability of gluten-free foods, improved food labelling, and better dietary instruction. Education of physicians and dietitians about CD and its treatment is essential.},
