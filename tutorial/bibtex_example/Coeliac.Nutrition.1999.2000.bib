   abstract = {With worldwide use of oral rehydration solutions, the treatment of acute diarrhea does not pose much of a problem. However, chronic diarrhea is still harmful, especially for the growth and development status of the children. Between January 1993 to December 1996, patients who suffered from chronic diarrhea for more than one month duration and admitted to Dr. Sami Ulus Children's Hospital were evaluated for epidemiological and etiologic factors. Seventy consecutive patients were evaluated. The mean age was 40.8 months and 52% were males. Malnutrition was detected in 80% of cases. Etiologic factors included celiac disease 30%, cow milk allergy 17%, bacterial and parasitic factors 26%, cystic fibrosis 10% and postinfectious gastroenteritis 10%. Eosinophilic gastroenteritis, chronic nonspecific diarrhea, pseudo-obstruction, neurofibromatosis and inflammatory bowel disease were rarely detected. Celiac disease and cow milk allergy were implicated as the most common causes of chronic diarrhea. The vicious cycle of faulty nutrition, malnutrition and infection and postinfectious enteropathy were also significant factors in the etiology of chronic diarrhea. It may be considered that cow milk protein prick test, sweat test, immunologic tests and mucosal biopsies should be performed for the definite diagnosis of chronic diarrhea.},

PATIENTS AND METHODS: 105 alcoholic patients with neither diagnosis nor clinical symptoms of pancreopathy were studied, from detoxification units for alcoholics with over 30 days abstinence. The nutritional status was evaluated by means of clinico-anthropometric parameters (body mass index, nutritional risk index, degree and type of malnutrition) and biological parameters (albumin, transferrin, and total lymphocyte count). The pancreas was morphologically examined by means of plain X-rays, ultrasonography and/or computer tomography, applying the Cambridge criteria; also functionally (Pancreolauryl test and fats in stools). RESULTS: The average (SD) consumption of alcohol was 195 (76) g/day (range 60-450), for 16 (8) years (3-40). Nutritional abnormalities were observed between 12.3% and 28% in the clinico-anthropometric parameters, and between 2% and 32% according to the biological parameters. These abnormalities were only light or moderate. The morphologic study showed abnormalities in 3.5% of the cases. Abnormalities in the exocrine function were observed in 26% of the cases, of which one third showed steathorrhea. A significant association between the nutritional condition and the scores of the tests of exocrine function was observed, especially in those cases with steathorrea. CONCLUSION: A large number of asymptomatic alcoholic subjects present a subclinical pancreopathy and signs of malnutrition. Both facts may be related and justify a pancreatic examination with more sensitive techniques in alcoholic individuals with malnutrition.},

   abstract = {BACKGROUND: Although clinical manifestations of celiac disease may change throughout life, clinical, histologic, immunologic, and genetic studies show that there are incomplete forms of this condition, making it difficult to define the disease at a given moment. Because there is no information published in the Latin American-Amerindian population, this study was conducted to assess relations between these parameters in Chileans with celiac disease and their first-degree relatives. METHODS: Sixty-two persons with confirmed celiac disease (mean age, 17.9 +/- 5.1 years; 78.3% females) and 126 relatives (mean age, 27.9 +/- 17.2 years; 65.1% females) were evaluated. Clinical manifestations, antiendomysial antibodies (EMAs), and human leukocyte antigen (HLA) haplotypes were studied in patients. Additionally, jejunal biopsy specimens were assessed (light microscopy) in EMA-positive (EMA+) relatives. RESULTS: Of the patients, 24.1% adhered to a strict gluten-free diet; 26% were oligosymptomatic, and none were malnourished; 45% were EMA+; 13.8% who ingested gluten were EMA-negative (EMA-); one patient consuming a strict gluten-free diet was EMA+. The DQA1*0501 allele was present in the highest frequency (48%, P < 0.0005), whereas combinations of DQ8 were predominant. Of the relatives, 4.8% were EMA+; they had a significantly higher frequency of diarrhea, weight loss, and anorexia (P < 0.03); and all had abnormal histology in biopsy specimens. CONCLUSIONS: After childhood, celiac disease is oligosymptomatic and is often unrecognized by patients. Disease in 13.8% of patients and in 4.8% relatives appeared as incomplete forms of celiac disease. Predominance of DQ8 HLA haplotypes reflects the genetic Spanish-Mapuche heritage of this population.},

   abstract = {BACKGROUND: Upper gastrointestinal motor abnormalities could account for some of the dyspeptic symptoms of celiac patients. However, the data on gastric emptying time are conflicting, and the pathophysiology of motor disturbances is still unclear. Neurotensin modulates upper gastrointestinal motor activity, and its postprandial increase is a reliable index of nutrient delivery to the ileum. We therefore assessed both plasma neurotensin levels and gastric emptying in untreated celiacs. METHODS: The gastric antral area of nine untreated celiac patients and nine controls was measured with ultrasound at base line and every 30 min after a fatty meal (227 kcal, 45% fat); the base-line and postprandial neurotensin plasma levels were determined by means of radioimmunoassay. The data are mean values +/- standard deviation and were analyzed by using non-parametric tests. RESULTS: The overall and half gastric emptying time were significantly longer in the patients (203+/-32 versus 133+/-15 min, P = 0.0117, and 137+/-32 versus 78+/-11 min, P = 0.0001). The pattern of the changes in antral area was similar in both groups during the observation period as a whole but differed significantly in the first 120 min (P = 0.0343). Base-line neurotensin levels were significantly higher in the patients (41.6+/-23.9 versus 18.2+/-5.5 pg/ml, P = 0.0214) and their net postprandial increase was lower than in controls (15.0+/-15.9 versus 29.8+/-13.0 pg/ml, P = 0.046). In both groups the base-line neurotensin levels were related to the half gastric emptying time (P = 0.023). CONCLUSIONS: In untreated celiac patients gastric emptying time is longer than in controls and is concomitant with an increase in base-line plasma neurotensin levels.},

OBJECTIVE: Our aim was to evaluate the nutritional status and body composition of adult celiac disease patients consuming a gluten-free diet who were in clinical, biochemical, and histologic remission. DESIGN: We studied 71 patients (51 women and 20 men; mean age: 27 y; range: 17-58 y) and 142 healthy control subjects matched by sex and age. The subjects' height, weight, body mass index, fat and lean mass, and bone mineral content (evaluated by dual-energy X-ray absorptiometry) were measured; a 3-d dietary questionnaire was administered; and total daily energy, fat, carbohydrate, and protein intakes were calculated. RESULTS: The weight, height, and body mass index of male celiac disease patients and the weight and body mass index of female celiac disease patients were significantly lower than the corresponding measurements in control subjects. The fat and lean mass of both male and female patients was significantly different from that of control subjects; however, bone mineral content was significantly lower only in females in whom celiac disease was diagnosed in adulthood. Total energy intake was lower in the patients than in the control subjects (9686 +/- 1569 and 11297 +/- 1318 kJ/d in males and 6736 +/- 1318 and 7740 +/- 1715 kJ/d in females), and the diet of the patients was unbalanced, with a higher percentage of energy as fat and a lower percentage of energy as carbohydrates. CONCLUSIONS: Although strictly compliant with their gluten-free diet and in complete remission, patients with celiac disease showed differences in body composition and dietary intakes compared with control subjects. Strict follow-up and dietary advice in terms of the choice and composition of foods seem necessary to prevent malnutrition.},

OBJECTIVE: The objective was to measure body composition in children at the time celiac disease was diagnosed and after consumption of a gluten-free diet (GFD). DESIGN: We assessed body composition by dual-energy X-ray absorptiometry in 29 children and adolescents with a mean (+/-SD) age of 9.5 +/- 3.4 y at the time celiac disease was diagnosed and in a subset of 20 patients after 1.2 +/- 0.2 y of a GFD. We also studied 23 patients aged 21.2 +/- 4.6 y who consumed a GFD for 10.6 +/- 4.5 y. Each patient was matched with a healthy control subject of the same age and sex. RESULTS: Untreated patients weighed less than control subjects (P = 0.04). Fat mass and bone mineral content were lower in the patients than in the control subjects (P < 0.01), as was lean mass of the limbs (P = 0.0013). After approximately 1 y of the GFD, there were no significant differences in body-composition values between patients and control subjects. Similarly, body-composition values of celiac disease patients who consumed the GFD long term were comparable with those of healthy subjects. CONCLUSIONS: Remarkable abnormalities in body composition were found in children at the time of diagnosis of celiac disease. Appropriate dietary treatment reverses body-composition abnormalities quickly and the beneficial effects of gluten withdrawal are persistent. Because these results are harder to achieve if celiac disease is first diagnosed in adulthood, efforts to encourage early diagnosis of celiac disease should be made.},

   abstract = {BACKGROUND: The xanthine oxidoreductase system has been identified as one of the main sources of free radicals responsible for various forms of tissue injury. Because the intestinal villi are an important location of this enzyme, it was of interest to study the role of xanthine oxidase in gluten-sensitive celiac enteropathy, associated with characteristic villous atrophy. Measured by a noninvasive method, the ratio of caffeine metabolites excreted in the urine after a caffeine challenge had previously been shown to be indicative of the total xanthine oxidase activity of the patient. METHODS: The study involved 22 children with gluten-challenged celiac disease, exhibiting subtotal villous atrophy in specimens from the third intestinal biopsy in accordance with ESPGHAN criteria. Ten of the patients displayed overt clinical symptoms (active form), whereas 12 had no symptoms (silent form). Urinary caffeine metabolites were determined by high-pressure liquid chromatography. The total in vivo xanthine oxidase activity was expressed as the caffeine metabolite index. RESULTS: In patients with active celiac disease the xanthine oxidase activity index was considerably higher, whereas in those with silent disease it was significantly lower than the control value. A significant negative correlation was shown between the index indicative of xanthine oxidase activity and the serum iron level of the patients. CONCLUSIONS: Activation of xanthine oxidase may play a role in the pathogenesis of active celiac disease with definite malabsorption, gastrointestinal symptoms, and anemia. The caffeine test reflects the difference in the pathogenetic mechanism leading to the mucosal lesion and clinical symptoms of active and silent forms of celiac disease.},

   abstract = {BACKGROUND: The incidence of celiac disease has been on the rise in both Europe and the United States. Celiac disease patients are at high risk of undernutrition because of nutrient malabsorption. OBJECTIVE: The aim of the present study was to evaluate changes in body composition and energy metabolism in a group of patients with celiac disease before and after consumption of a gluten-free diet (GFD). DESIGN: Body composition (by anthropometry and isotopic dilution), resting metabolic rate (RMR), and substrate oxidation rates (by indirect calorimetry) were assessed in 39 adult celiac disease patients (16 men and 23 women) with a mean (+/-SD) age of 29. 9 +/- 7.6 y, weight of 58.3 +/- 6.6 kg, and percentage body fat of 20.1 +/- 6.7%, and in 63 (29 men and 34 women) age- and height-matched control subjects (age: 33.2 +/- 8.1 y; weight: 66.8 +/- 6.6 kg; and percentage body fat: 25.4 +/- 3.7%). Celiac disease patients were studied twice, at diagnosis and 1 y after treatment with a GFD. RESULTS: Before treatment, celiac disease patients had a lower body weight (P < 0.05) and a higher carbohydrate oxidation rate (P < 0.01) than did control subjects. Carbohydrate oxidation rates correlated positively with fecal lipid loss in untreated celiac disease patients (r = 0.80, P < 0.0001). After the GFD, percentage body fat was higher in celiac disease patients than in control subjects (P < 0.01), and lipid intakes tended to be higher than before treatment. CONCLUSIONS: This longitudinal study showed that the GFD treatment significantly increased body fat stores. Untreated patients preferentially utilized carbohydrates as a fuel substrate, probably as a consequence of both lipid malabsorption and a high carbohydrate intake, and lipid utilization increased with the restoration of the intestinal mucosa.},

   abstract = {An impairment of nutritional status up to real malnutrition can frequently be associated to gastrointestinal diseases. The diseases of the gastrointestinal tract can be divided into five groups: those hampering the nutrient physiological transit (especially neoplastic diseases); those affecting the intestinal mucosa (such as chronic inflammatory bowel disease); those determining intraluminal maldigestion; the hepato-biliary diseases and finally, the diseases of the pancreas. In order to correctly evaluate the nutritional status of an individual, besides the determination of the common biochemical parameters, body composition by direct and indirect techniques and energy metabolism by indirect calorimetry should be measured. Patients affected by Crohn's disease showed a lower fat mass content along with higher lipid oxidation compared to patients affected by ulcerative colitis. Patients with coeliac disease at diagnosis had a reduction in both fat and fat-free mass content along with an increased utilisation of carbohydrates as fuel substrate. There are many factors potentially leading to severe malnutrition in pancreatic diseases, especially in the acute form. Due to the primary role played by the liver in the metabolism of energy substrates, an impaired nutritional status might be commonly found in cirrhotic patients. In this connection, our group reported an increased energy expenditure and lipid oxidation, and an insulin-resistant state in compensated liver cirrhotic patients. These alterations seemed to precede and probably to lead to liver-disease-related malnutrition.},

   abstract = {BACKGROUND: Intestinal permeability has seldom been investigated in diabetes mellitus, even though patients frequently report gastrointestinal symptoms, and it has recently been shown that the prevalence of celiac disease associated with diabetes mellitus is higher than expected. METHODS: Intestinal permeability to cellobiose and mannitol was investigated in 31 patients affected by type I uncomplicated diabetes mellitus. Values were compared with those obtained in 32 normal subjects. RESULTS: The percentage of mannitol recovery was far higher than normal in two thirds of the investigated patients and correlated with the length of disease, even though the probes' ratio (cellobiose/mannitol) was in the normal range. CONCLUSIONS: A not previously reported increase of intestinal permeability to mannitol, clear-cut and not associated with that of the larger probe, is found in type I uncomplicated diabetes mellitus. These results may describe a primary feature of type I diabetes mellitus and the initial steps of evolution to celiac disease.},

   abstract = {BACKGROUND: Anti-gliadin antibody (AGA) determination has been widely used in the screening test to detect celiac patients in the general population and in risk groups. Serological assays present variable efficiency, probably caused by differences in the antigenic mixtures employed as antigen. The objective of this work is to evaluate the use of purified gliadin fractions in an enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay (ELISA) test. METHODS: Anti-gliadin antibody reactivity was characterized in the sera of patients with celiac disease, and AGA levels were determined by immunoblot analysis using purified gliadin fractions after separation of wheat proteins by sodium dodecyl sulfate-polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis (SDS-PAGE) and acid-PAGE and after indirect ELISA. Seven antigenic mixtures were tested: commercial gliadin, ethanolic wheat extract, and five fast protein liquid chromatography-purified fractions (omega-gliadins, two mixtures of alpha-/beta- and beta-/gamma-gliadins). Immunoblot analysis after A-PAGE separation showed that immunoglobulin (Ig)A reactivity was frequently more restricted than that of IgG. Serum IgA in 15 of 23 patients showed intense reactivity against omega-gliadins. RESULTS: In seven cases, only omega-gliadins were detected. To compare the efficiency of ELISA tests, serum samples of 28 patients with celiac disease and 31 control subjects were tested against the seven gliadin fractions. Immunoglobulin G AGAs demonstrated similar levels against the different gliadin fractions, whereas IgA AGAs showed a heterogeneous reactivity that depended on the fraction tested. The lowest number of false-positive and false-negative results was obtained when the omega-gliadin fraction was used. Parameters for ELISA showed that the omega-gliadin fraction elicited the highest assay efficiency for determinations of both IgA and IgG AGAs. A good correlation was found between IgG and IgA anti-omega-gliadin and antiendomysial antibody determinations. Of the 28 biopsy-confirmed patients with celiac disease, 26 samples (23 positive and 3 negative) were found to have concordant results among the three determinations. CONCLUSIONS: In this study, an intense and, in many cases, selective recognition of omega-gliadins was observed. Results suggest that a higher performance in AGA determination could be achieved using omega-gliadin as an antigen in indirect ELISA.},

   abstract = {OBJECTIVES: Because there is controversy regarding the prevalence, familial occurrence, and possible factors inducing splenic hypofunction in celiac disease, we have reassessed them in a large series of untreated patients and their first-degree relatives. METHODS: Pitted red cell counting was used to measure splenic function and the effect that age at diagnosis has on it, while severity of intestinal lesions and nutritional status were estimated by multiple linear regression analysis. Moreover, serum tuftsin activity was assayed by measuring its ability to stimulate phagocytosis of opsonized Staphylococcus aureus. RESULTS: We found that 32.8% of untreated celiacs and none of their relatives had pitted red cell values in the range of splenic hypofunction (>4%). Only age at diagnosis, but not the other two covariates, was significantly associated with the degree of splenic hypofunction. Tuftsin activity was depressed in celiac disease and this reduction was significantly greater in hyposplenic patients. CONCLUSIONS: In celiac disease the prevalence of splenic hypofunction is lower than formerly believed. The duration of preexposure to gluten is a crucial factor for the prevalence and severity of this complication that does not affect celiac relatives. In celiac disease splenic hypofunction is accompanied by a reduced phagocyte activity linked to the decreased release of tuftsin.},

We aimed to evaluate body composition by dual-energy x-ray absorptiometry and bioelectrical impedance in celiac adolescents on a gluten-free diet to investigate whether impedance may provide an alternative method to assess nutritional status in these patients. METHODS: We studied body composition in 43 adolescents affected by celiac disease on a gluten-free diet for > or = 1 yr and 30 healthy subjects. Fat, fat-free, and bone masses were assessed by dual-energy x-ray absorptiometry. Fat and fat-free masses were also assessed by bioelectrical impedance. All anthropometric measurements were performed according to standard procedures. RESULTS: All patients had a significantly lower body weight, height, fat-free mass, bone mineral density (p < 0.001), and body mass index (p < 0.01) compared with controls. In contrast, parameters predicting fat compartment (sum of skinfolds and fat mass) did not differ from those of controls. No significant difference was found between patients strictly adherent to a gluten-free diet and patients partially compliant. Compared with dual-energy x-ray absorptiometry measurements, bioelectrical impedance showed a high accuracy to estimate fat-free mass (R2 = 0.97) and limited accuracy for fat mass (R2 = 0.75). Furthermore, impedance was more reliable for estimating hydration of soft tissue underlying the fat-free mass changes. CONCLUSIONS: In adolescents with celiac disease, after a mean of 1 yr of gluten-free diet all the parameters assessing body compartments, except fat mass, were affected, compared with healthy controls. Bioelectrical impedance holds promise for routine assessment of body composition changes in celiac adolescents on a gluten-free diet.},

While several studies have shown the occurrence of osteopenia in celiac disease, bone mass and metabolism have never before been evaluated in dermatitis herpetiformis. Therefore, in 16 untreated patients, 16 sex- and age-matched untreated celiac patients, and 16 sex- and age-matched healthy volunteers, lumbar and femoral bone mineral density were measured and bone and mineral metabolism and nutritional status were evaluated. All these parameters were significantly altered in the two groups of patients and although the degree of these alterations was milder in patients with dermatitis herpetiformis than in celiac patients, the presence of subtotal villous atrophy in patients with dermatitis herpetiformis was associated with the presence of more severe alterations. Bone mineral density was significantly correlated with nutritional status, and patients showing bone loss were characterized by a body mass index lower than 20. Alterations of bone mass and mineral metabolism complicate dermatitis herpetiformis when severe intestinal lesions coexist. A low nutritional status may be predictive of the presence of bone loss.},

In this condition the degree of malabsorption is a major determinant of bone loss. However, the role of lifestyle factors such as exposure to sunlight, physical activity and cigarette smoking, which have been demonstrated to influence bone mass and mineral metabolism in other conditions, has never been investigated in coeliac disease. DESIGN: We evaluated the impact of potential co-factors on bone homeostasis in coeliac disease by means of a multivariate analysis model. METHODS: Thirty-nine adult patients with untreated coeliac disease (18 symptomatic, 21 subclinical/silent) were studied. Bone mineral density was measured by dual-energy X-ray absorptiometry at lumbar spine and femoral neck levels. Age at diagnosis, gender, duration of symptoms and severity of symptoms were recorded. Nutritional status, cigarette smoking habit, exposure to sunlight, and physical activity were evaluated. The impact of each independent variable on lumbar and femoral bone mineral density was evaluated by means of a multivariate analysis model. RESULTS: The severity of symptoms and nutritional status were significant sources of variability of both lumbar and femoral bone mineral density. Physical activity was a significant source of variability at femoral level, while gender was at lumbar level. Cigarette smoking habit and exposure to sunlight showed no significant effect on bone mineral density. CONCLUSIONS: Gender, malnutrition, global severity of the disease and physical activity are important co-factors in the pathogenesis of bone loss in coeliac disease.},

METHODS: High-performance liquid chromatography of low-molecular-weight peptides in the urine was performed over 6 months, before and after a gluten-free diet was instituted in children who clinically improved while consuming the diet. RESULTS: A significant decrease of peptide levels was observed in children consuming the gluten-free diet. Certain peptide peaks thought to be gluten related decreased the most after the patients began the diet. CONCLUSIONS: Because the peptides decrease in patients consuming a gluten-free diet, it is reasonable to conclude that such peptides have a mostly dietary origin.},

In our case the interval between the appearance of arthritis and the diagnosis of CD was 2 years. The boy was asymptomatic for bowel disease and his nutritional status was normal. The diagnosis of CD was established using anti-gliadin (AGA) and anti-endomysium (EMA) antibody tests and was confirmed by small bowel biopsy. The introduction of a gluten-free diet resulted in the persistent remission of arthritis. As the treatment of CD-associated arthritis is based on dietary therapy, physicians should be alert to the possibility of occult CD in any child with arthritis of unclear origin.},

   abstract = {BACKGROUND: Whereas many people with coeliac disease (CD) are asymptomatic when consuming a gluten-free diet (GFD), a proportion continues to experience symptoms. The reasons for this are unclear. METHODS: Thirty-nine adult members of The Coeliac Society of New South Wales, all of whom had persistent gastrointestinal symptoms despite adhering to a GFD, were evaluated. Dietary analysis indicated that 22 (56%) were consuming a GFD as defined by the WHO/FAO Codex Alimentarius (Codex-GFD), in which foods containing up to 0.3% of protein from gluten-containing grains can be labelled as 'gluten free'. The remaining 17 were following a no detectable gluten diet (NDG)-GFD, as defined by Food Standards Australia. All subjects were required to follow a NDG-GFD during the study. Those in whom symptoms persisted after changing from a Codex-GFD and those who entered the study already on a NDG-GFD began an elimination diet followed by open and double-blind challenges to identify specific non-gluten food or food chemical intolerances. RESULTS: Of 22 patients who switched to a NDG-GFD symptoms resolved in 5 (23%) and were reduced in 10 others (45%). Thirty-one subjects commenced the elimination diet. Symptomatic improvement was experienced in 24 (77%). Subsequent food or food chemical challenges resulted in a mean of five positive challenges per individual. Diarrhoea was the most commonly provoked symptom, followed by headache, nausea, and flatulence. Symptoms were especially provoked by amine, salicylate and soy. CONCLUSION: The consumption of trace amounts of gluten, traditionally allowed in a Codex-GFD, may be responsible for the continuing symptoms seen in some patients with CD. Further investigation for non-gluten food intolerances should follow if symptoms persist after adherence to a NDG-GFD.},

   abstract = {OBJECTIVE: Adult celiac disease is a genetically determined condition resulting from intolerance to gluten. This familial disease is associated with HLA B8 DR3 and is characterized by cytotoxic T-lymphocyte reaction in the digestive wall leading to a maladsorption syndrome. Adult celiac disease would be an expression of a silent disease already present in childhood. PATIENTS AND METHODS: We conducted a retrospective study in 19 patients. Diagnosis was established in a department of internal medicine in adulthood. We analyzed histological findings and the clinical history and course. RESULTS: The age curve at diagnosis peaked at 22 years and 67 years. Female sex predominated. Average delay to diagnosis was 3.1 years. The patients were admitted for reasons other than digestive disorders in 17 out of 19 cases. Careful history taking did however disclose subtle digestive signs. The principal manifestations were hematological disorders such as chronic anemia, abnormal liver function tests, and poor control of associated diseases. Type 1 diabetes mellitus was the main associated disease (4/19). Patients with prolonged nutritional deficiencies experienced serious situations. CONCLUSION: Adult celiac disease is a clinical variant suggesting the presence of other non-digestive disorders. Specific antibodies should be assayed in patients with even minimal signs of deficiency in order to identify associated diseases. The principal cause of mortality is digestive T-cell lymphoma. A gluten-free diet is essential to control the course of this chronic disease.},

   abstract = {PURPOSE: We report the clinical features and treatment of 31 patients with a diagnosis of enteropathy-type intestinal T-cell lymphoma treated at the Wessex Regional Medical Oncology Unit in Southampton between 1979 and 1996 (23 men, eight women). PATIENTS AND METHODS: Patients were identified from our lymphoma database. Details of history, physical examination, staging investigations, treatment, and outcome were taken from patient records. RESULTS: Twelve patients (35%) had a documented clinical history of adult-onset celiac disease, and a further three had histologic features consistent with celiac disease in resected areas of the small bowel not infiltrated with lymphoma. After diagnosis, 24 (77%) of the 31 patients were treated with chemotherapy; the remaining seven had surgical treatment alone. More than half were unable to complete their planned chemotherapy courses, often because of poor nutritional status; 12 patients required enteral or parenteral feeding. A response to initial chemotherapy was observed in 14 patients (complete response, n = 10; partial response, n = 4). Observed complications of treatment were gastrointestinal bleeding, small-bowel perforation, and the development of enterocolic fistulae. Relapses occurred 1 to 60 months from diagnosis in 79% of those who responded to initial therapy. Of the total 31 patients, 26 (84%) have died, all from progressive disease or from complications of the disease and/or its treatment. The actuarial 1- and 5-year survival rates are 38.7% and 19.7%, respectively, with 1- and 5-year failure-free survival rates of 19.4% and 3.2%, respectively. CONCLUSION: The prognosis for these patients is poor. This, in part, reflects late diagnosis and poor performance status at the time of presentation. The role of salvage treatments and high-dose chemotherapy at relapse is not clear. However, it is encouraging that there are five long-term survivors in our patient population.},

METHODS: The study includes 26 patients (11 boys and 15 girls) with typical celiac disease who were younger than 2.5 at diagnosis and were followed by means of a growth longitudinal monitoring from the introduction of a gluten-free diet (mean age, 1.7 +/- 0.5 years) until adulthood, over a median period of 15.3 years. Growth indicators used were: height, skeletal age, weight and BMI. RESULTS: At the time of admission, the patients had a general tendency to short stature, underweight and retarded skeletal maturation. They did not catch up completely in height and skeletal age after a dietary treatment period of 3 years. Most of them were seen to be slightly below average height for age during childhood and adolescence with skeletal maturity retardation, even if a fairly large interindividual variation of height profiles was evident. CONCLUSIONS: Notwithstanding the early treatment, the careful follow-up, and the good adhesion to the dietary rules of the patients under study, slight negative effects of the disease on growth were not avoided.},

STUDY DESIGN: Data from 116 families were collected, and patients conforming to our predetermined diagnostic criteria were analyzed. Phenotypic manifestations of affected siblings and singletons were compared with the use of t tests, Wilcoxon scores, and chi2 analysis. RESULTS: Eighty-eight patients (33 female, 55 male; median age 5.20 years) fulfilled our predetermined diagnostic criteria for Shwachman syndrome; 63 patients were isolated cases, and 25 affected siblings were from 12 multiplex families. Steatorrhea was present in 86% (57 of 66), and 91% (78 of 86) displayed a low serum trypsinogen concentration. Patients older than 4 years more often had pancreatic sufficiency. Neutropenia occurred in 98%, anemia in 42%, and thrombocytopenia in 34%. Myelodysplasia or cytogenetic abnormalities were reported in 7 patients. Short stature with normal nutritional status was a prominent feature. CONCLUSIONS: Clinical features among patients with Shwachman syndrome varied between patients and with age. Similarities in phenotype between isolated cases and affected sibling sets support the hypothesis that Shwachman syndrome is a single disease entity.},

   abstract = {BACKGROUND: Calcium and vitamin D homeostasis seem to be abnormal in patients with exocrine pancreatic dysfunction resulting from cystic fibrosis. Only a few studies have evaluated and described bone mineral metabolism in patients with chronic pancreatitis and pancreatic insufficiency. METHODS: Thirty-two patients with chronic pancreatitis and residual exocrine pancreatic function (group 1) and 26 patients with pancreatic exocrine insufficiency (i.e., meal-stimulated intraduodenal lipase <10% of lowest normal range and steatorrhea) (group 2) were studied. Serum levels of total calcium, phosphate, 25 (OH)D, 1.25(OH)2D, alkaline phosphatase, and parathyroid hormone were measured. Bone mineral density (BMD), bone mineral content (BMC), lean body mass (LBM), and fat mass (FM) were measured using a dual-energy X-ray absorptiometry (DXA) scanner. RESULTS: Alcohol was a causative factor in 79% of the patients. Fifty-six percent in group 1 and 69% in group 2 had Z-scores of the BMD < -1. The mean Z-score was -1.16 +/- 1.29 in group 1 and -1.32 +/- 0.90 in group 2. The mean Z-score of the BMC was -1.02 +/- 1.17 vs -1.39 +/- 0.987. In both groups mean 25 (OH)D and mean 1.25(OH)2D were below reference range. Plasma concentrations of albumin-corrected calcium, alkaline phosphatase, and parathyroid hormone were in the upper range of the reference range. Mean Z-scores of LBM were -0.69 +/- 1.34 in group 1 vs -1.01 +/- 1.12 in group 2 and Z-scores of FM were -0.27 +/- 1.70 in group 1 vs -0.95 +/- 1.01 in group 2 (p <0.05). CONCLUSION: Patients with chronic pancreatitis, in particular patients with advanced disease and steatorrhea, are at risk of developing significant bone loss. Despite normal body mass index the patients are characterized by loss of lean body mass and fat mass. The present study shows that these patients have decreased serum levels of vitamin D metabolites and low bone mass.},

This study was conducted to determine the association between childhood celiac disease and Down syndrome in the county of Uppsala, Sweden. METHODS: All 76 children with Down syndrome (1-18 years) were screened for the occurrence of anti-gliadin antibodies (AGA) and anti-endomysium antibodies (EMA). Twelve children with suspected celiac disease were investigated further. RESULTS: Increased levels of both IgA and IgG AGA were found in 26% of the children and of EMA in and 5 of 76. Celiac disease was diagnosed in at least three of the children (3.9%; 95% confidence interval 0%-8.3%), and it could have been present in as many as eight. Three of the five EMA-positive children with suspected celiac disease had the HLA phenotype DR3, DQ2. CONCLUSIONS: The results show that determination of EMA is more useful as a screening test for celiac disease and for follow-up than is AGA in children with Down syndrome. The present study also confirms that celiac disease is overrepresented among Swedish children with Down syndrome and that celiac disease should be considered in all persons with Down syndrome.},

The purposes of this study were to evaluate the clinical potential of circulating anti-tissue transglutaminase (tTG) immunoglobulin (Ig)A antibodies in the diagnosis of childhood celiac disease and to investigate the extent of autoreactivity of these antibodies. METHODS: Included in this retrospective study were samples from 22 children with biopsy-verified celiac disease, 23 control subjects with disease, and 22 healthy control subjects without any known gastrointestinal or inflammatory disorders. An enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay (ELISA) was used to measure the serum levels of IgA antibodies specific for human and guinea pig tTGs. All samples were also analyzed for antibodies to gliadin and endomysium (EMA). RESULTS: The concentrations of IgA specific for human and guinea pig tTGs correlated with the small intestinal villous structure and the serum levels of IgA EMA. The tTG ELISAs exhibited a high specificity and sensitivity for detection of untreated celiac disease. The human erythrocyte IgA tTG ELISA had the highest sensitivity (100%) and a specificity of 98%. The IgA EMA method had a sensitivity of 95% and the highest specificity (100%) of all tests. CONCLUSIONS: Our results provide additional support to the concept that anti-tTG IgA antibodies can be used as a highly discriminatory serologic marker for celiac disease and that measurements of these autoreactive antibodies may in the future be used as an alternative to the EMA test.},

We aimed to determine the prevalence of CD in children presenting with symptoms or conditions associated with CD. STUDY DESIGN: Individuals aged 6 months to 20 years were screened for IgG and IgA antigliadin (AGA-IgG and AGA-IgA) and antiendomysium (EMA) antibodies. Those with only elevated AGA-IgG were screened for selective IgA deficiency. Patients with elevated EMA, or AGA-IgG elevation and selective IgA deficiency, were advised to undergo small intestinal biopsy. RESULTS: A total of 1200 individuals were studied; 34 were EMA positive-26 (19 EMA positive) consented to biopsy and 21 had CD, giving a prevalence of 1 in 57 (21/1200). Including the 15 EMA positive patients who refused a biopsy, the prevalence of CD in this study could be as high as 1 in 33 (36/1200). CONCLUSIONS: CD is not rare in the United States and may be as common as in Europe. AGA and EMA are useful for identifying patients who should undergo a small intestinal biopsy.},

We sought to determine the positive predictive value of this test in asymptomatic children at genetic risk for celiac disease. STUDY DESIGN: Asymptomatic children with a genetic risk for celiac disease were studied to investigate the relationships between TG antibody titer, small bowel histology, growth, and clinical features. Small bowel biopsy histology was graded by using the system of Marsh. RESULTS: Of 30 children with a positive TG antibody test result, 21 (70%) had definite (Marsh score 2 or 3) and 4 (13%) had possible (Marsh score 1) biopsy evidence of celiac disease. TG antibody titer correlated with Marsh score (r = 0.569, P <.01). There was an inverse correlation between Marsh score and height z score (r = -0.361, P =. 05). CONCLUSIONS: In this group of asymptomatic children screened because of a genetic risk, TG antibodies have a positive predictive value of 70% to 83% for biopsy evidence of celiac disease and may identify children before clinical features of celiac disease develop.},

   abstract = {OBJECTIVE: To determine whether consumption of oats is safe in children with newly diagnosed celiac disease who are starting a gluten-free diet. STUDY DESIGN: We conducted a self-controlled, open-label, 6-month trial of a commercial oat breakfast cereal product. Primary outcome variables were small bowel histomorphology and anti-tissue transglutaminase IgA antibody titer. RESULTS: The 10 children who completed the study were 6.8 +/- 4.0 (mean +/- SD) years of age and 5 were male. Over 6.6 +/- 0.7 months, they consumed 24 grams of oat cereal per day, or 1.2 +/- 0.9 g/kg/d. Compared with start of study, at completion there was a significant decrease in biopsy score (P <.01), intra-epithelial lymphocyte count (P <.005), anti-tissue transglutaminase IgA antibody titer (P <.01), and number of symptoms (P <.01). CONCLUSIONS: We conclude that consumption of a commercially available oat cereal product for 6 months is safe for children with celiac disease beginning a gluten-free diet. Studies are needed to determine the long-term safety of including oat cereal in the gluten-free diet.},

   abstract = {Celiac disease and dermatitis herpetiformis are caused by the alcohol soluble fractions of wheat, barley, and rye. Reliable serological tests are available for both mass and risk group screening and recent epidemiological studies on celiac disease suggest that the prevalence varies between 1:100-300 in different continents. The clinical manifestations of the disease has changed in the West and the classical symptomatic cases represent only approximately 1/7th of all diagnosed cases. Symptoms such as, anemia, short stature, dental enamel defect or osteoporosis can be the only manifestations of the atypical disease. There is an increased prevalence of celiac disease in patients with autoimmune diseases. Recent data suggest that there is a correlation between the prevalence of autoimmune diseases and the number of years that an individual consumes gluten-containing foods. Genetic studies revealed a high prevalence of certain HLA antigens in celiac patients, however, there is likelihood that non-HIA genes are also important in the pathomechanism. An interesting new development is the recognition of tissue transglutaminase (tTG), an enzyme that probably forms an autoantigen with gluten. It is generally accepted that antibodies to tTG are identical to the previously described antiendomysium antibodies. Whether or not tTG is responsible for the initiation of an immunoreaction against prolamines or just exacerbates the immune response is a subject of further investigations.},

In this cross-sectional study the data on the severity of celiac disease and BMD were collected from 77 celiac patients (28 newly diagnosed and 49 previously diagnosed celiac patients), and BMD results were compared with those of 157 control subjects matched for age, gender, and menopausal status. The celiac patients had significantly lower BMD than the control subjects at the lumbar spine (-6%) and femoral neck (-5%). The mean BMD did not differ significantly among celiac patients classified by severity of disease. Based on Z scores, 35% of the celiac patients and 17% of the control subjects had low BMDs for age at the lumbar spine (p = 0.005), whereas 31% of celiac patients and 16% of control subjects had Z scores of < or =-1 at the femoral neck (p = 0.01). Altogether, 26% of all celiac patients, but only 5% of control subjects, were classified as having osteoporosis (T score < or =-2.5 SD) at the lumbar spine (p = 0.03), whereas osteoporosis was rare at the femoral neck in both groups (3% vs. 1%, p = 1.00). Prevalence of osteopenia and osteoporosis was highest in newly diagnosed celiac patients and in patients with disease not in remission. A low 25-(OH)D vitamin concentration was a typical biochemical abnormality in our patients (64% of men and 71% of women). The main associated variables of low BMD were age (men), low serum vitamin D level, low body weight, and postmenopausal status (women). The present study suggests that celiac disease constitutes a risk factor for osteoporosis. This finding applies particularly to untreated and poorly treated patients.},

The study group consisted of 28 newly diagnosed celiac patients (9 men, 19 women) recruited between 1990 and 1991. Six patients withdrew from the 5-year follow-up. Compliance with the gluten-free diet was good: 96% at 1 year and 82% at 5 years. During the follow-up period, the body mass index increased significantly (8%). Both in men and women, bone mineral density (BMD) values determined by dual X-ray absorptiometry (DXA) increased at the lumbar spine (2%), the femoral neck (1%), the trochanter (6%), and the Wards' area (3%) during the follow-up. The increase in BMD was found already during the first year of follow-up. After 1 year, BMD increased or remained the same in 69% of the patients at the lumbar spine and in 67% of the patients at the femoral neck, 89% of patients at the throchanter, and 67% of patients at the Wards' area. During the 5-year follow-up, these figures were 52%, 46%, 68%, and 59%, respectively. At the baseline, 19 out of 28 patients, after 1 year, 14 out of 26 patients, and after 5 years, 2 out of 26 patients had low serum 25(OH)D vitamin values (p = 0.0001). A high serum parathormone value was noticed in 6 out of 25 patients at the baseline, but after 1 year, 5 of them showed normalized values (p = 0.03). According to our results, bone disease in celiac patients is cured in most patients during 5 years on a gluten-free diet. The improvement in BMD mostly occurred already within the first year after the establishment of a gluten-free diet.},

This frequently results in malabsorption of a range of important nutrients including iron, folic acid, calcium and fat-soluble vitamins. Coeliac disease in now considered to be a common disorder, possibly affecting 1:300 of the general population. Many patients present in adulthood, have minimal symptoms, and gastrointestinal manifestations are frequently absent. The diagnosis and screening for coeliac disease has been dramatically facilitated by testing for endomysial autoantibodies, although biopsy and demonstration of a characteristic histological lesion remains the definitive diagnostic investigation. Treatment with a gluten-free diet is effective but requires good patient compliance and monitoring to succeed.},

   abstract = {BACKGROUND: Gastric autoantibodies are common in Helicobacter pylori-infected adults, and the presence of these antibodies is associated with atrophic gastritis. The role of H. pylori in the autoimmune type of atrophic gastritis is unresolved, and it is not known at what stage the autoantibodies appear in serum during H. pylori infection. Therefore, we screened children with and without H. pylori infection for gastric parietal cell antibodies. METHODS: Seventy-one children with H. pylori infection verified by examination of gastric biopsy specimens (mean age, 9.4 years), 8 children with positive serology but negative histology for H. pylori (mean age, 11.6 years), and 130 children with negative serology for H. pylori (mean age, 7.7 years) were screened for the presence of gastric parietal cell antibodies in serum by indirect immunofluorescence. In addition, 61 children with celiac disease (mean age, 7.1 years) were screened for gastric parietal cell antibodies and H. pylori antibodies. RESULTS: None of the children with H. pylori infection had gastric parietal cell antibodies in serum. Only three positive parietal cell antibody reactions were found: a 14-year-old boy with positive serology for H. pylori but no other signs of infection (titer 5000), a 14-year-old girl with tuberculosis (titer 1250, seronegative for H. pylori) and a 10-year-old girl with insulin-dependent diabetes mellitus (titer 6250, seronegative for H. pylori). CONCLUSIONS: Although gastric autoantibodies are often found in adults with chronic H. pylori gastritis, it seems that H. pylori-infected children are not positive for gastric parietal cell antibodies. It remains to be studied in which H. pylori infections and at what stages gastric autoantibodies appear.},

   abstract = {BACKGROUND: Because of the different sensitivity and specificity of serologic tests, the search for silent celiac disease is usually performed with the combined or sequential use of several tests. Among these, the IgA-class endomysium antibody test has the highest specificity and positive predictive value, but it may overlook IgA-deficient patients. METHODS: To test a new one-step screening approach, serum samples from 427 apparently healthy, 3- to 6-year-old Hungarian children were investigated for IgA-class and IgG-class endomysium antibodies using monkey esophagus and human jejunum as substrates. RESULTS: Five new cases with flat mucosa were identified by strong endomysium antibody positivity and subsequent jejunal biopsy, yielding a celiac disease prevalence of 1:85. An additional child may have latent celiac disease (slight histologic changes at present). Two of the screening-detected celiac patients exhibited only IgG-class endomysium antibodies due to associated IgA-deficiency. Despite the young age of the screened population, antigliadin antibodies were positive in only three of the five celiac patients. CONCLUSIONS: Prevalence of celiac disease in the study population was much higher than expected on the basis of antigliadin antibody-based studies. The screening system used detected celiac cases in which there was IgA-deficiency and those in which there was not and also those negative for antigliadin antibodies. The findings suggest the importance of the primary testing of autoantibodies in future celiac disease screening policies.},

This study was undertaken to investigate whether the tissue distribution of transglutaminase is also compatible with reticulin, jejunal, and fibroblast autoantibody binding patterns. METHODS: Sera from patients with and without celiac disease, monoclonal tissue transglutaminase antibodies, and sera from mice parenterally immunized against commercially available tissue transglutaminase, transglutaminase complexed with gliadin, or gliadin were used in indirect immunofluorescence and double-staining studies using both rodent and primate tissues as substrates. Also, antibody competition, affinity chromatography, and potassium thiocyanate extraction studies were undertaken. RESULTS: Tissue transglutaminase antibody binding patterns were identical with the extracellular binding patterns seen with celiac patient sera. Human umbilical cord-derived fibroblasts exhibited both cytoplasmic and extracellular matrix staining. Double staining with patients' sera and tissue transglutaminase antibodies showed complete overlapping. Tissue transglutaminase effectively absorbed reticulin-endomysial antibodies from celiac sera, and patients' sera blocked the staining of the monoclonal tissue transglutaminase antibodies. Potassium thiocyanate extraction abolished the staining patterns, but they were elicited again after readdition of tissue transglutaminase. CONCLUSIONS: Reticulin, endomysial, and jejunal antibodies detect transglutaminase in both rodent and primate tissues, indicating that these tissue autoantibodies are identical.},

METHODS: To evaluate height velocity of patients with confirmed celiac disease before their diagnosis and treatment, anthropometric measurements taken by the general pediatricians in charge of the primary care of the patients before they were sent to the authors' hospital were studied. Forty-two growth periods (available velocities) were measured at varying intervals (ranging from 6 to 27 months) in 23 patients aged 0.1 to 10.66 years were analyzed. RESULTS: All patients studied during the first semester of life (n = 5) showed normal growth velocity, and 6 of 10 patients showed normal growth velocity during the second semester of life. Ten of 12 patients between the ages of 1.0 and 1.99 years of age showed normal height velocity, and 7 of 9 patients aged 2.0 to 10.66 years showed normal height velocity. Normal height velocities were found not only during the first year of life, but also in children aged 1 to 8 years. CONCLUSIONS: Results should alert pediatricians and those in gastroenterology and growth clinics. In the latter case, norms for studying children who have short stature but are growing at a normal rate should not be a condition for excluding a child from screening for celiac disease.},

   abstract = {BACKGROUND: Celiac disease is an autoimmune disorder of the small intestine characterized by intolerance to gluten. Traditionally, diagnosis is made by intestinal biopsy. Testing for immunoglobulin (Ig) A endomysial antibodies in the serum also is used for diagnosis. Biopsy and serology revert to normal with adherence to a gluten-free diet. Often, after an index case is diagnosed, siblings with symptoms adhere to a gluten-free diet without biopsy or serologic confirmation. More than 90% of patients with celiac disease have the human leukocyte antigen (HLA) DQA1*0501-DQB1*0201 genotype. Non-HLA genes also have been implicated. METHODS: One hundred ninety-five individuals with confirmed or suspected celiac disease were identified in 73 families affected by the disease. IgA endomysial antibody testing was performed for all symptomatic family members who did not have biopsy-confirmed diagnoses. DNA samples were genotyped at D6S276 and the HLA class II loci DQA and DQB. RESULTS: At the time sampling was begun in families, 88 of 177 (49.7%) individuals were self-diagnosed and adhering to a gluten-free diet. Ninety percent (91/101) of confirmed cases (biopsy or serology) had at least 1 copy of the DQA1*0501-DQB1*0201 genotype, whereas only 67% (46/69) of cases self-diagnosed (adherence to gluten-free diet without confirmation) had at least 1 copy. Of confirmed cases, 61% carried two copies of DQB*0201. It is estimated that the HLA association and other unlinked genes contribute approximately equally to the sibling risk of celiac disease. CONCLUSIONS: A dosage effect of DQB1*0201 may be associated with an increased risk of celiac disease. Self-diagnosis of celiac disease is as common as confirmed diagnosis in families in the United States. Diagnosis of celiac disease on the basis of clinical response to gluten restriction is inaccurate. With long-term adherence to a gluten-free diet, serologic test results are likely to be negative. Based on HLA genotype, approximately one third of self-diagnosed individuals are unlikely to have celiac disease. However, it is not possible to determine which individuals consuming a gluten-free diet have the disease. Therefore, before starting a gluten-free diet, serologic screening and biopsy confirmation are necessary.},

   abstract = {BACKGROUND: Growth-inhibitory autocrine polypeptides such as transforming growth factor (TGF)-beta may play a role in the control of normal epithelial cell proliferation and differentiation. In addition, TGF-beta has a central role in extracellular matrix homeostasis and regulates the immune response at the local level. In this study immunohistochemistry was used to examine the pattern of TGF-beta protein distribution and quantitative reverse transcription-polymerase chain reaction (RT-PCR) to determine levels of TGF-beta messenger RNA expression in normal intestinal mucosa and in the flat mucosa of children with celiac disease. METHODS: Small intestinal biopsies were performed in children with active celiac disease and in histologically normal control subjects. Frozen sections were single stained using an anti-TGF-beta monoclonal antibody and were double stained for TGF-beta and T cell, macrophages, and the activation marker CD25. Total RNA was extracted from frozen specimens and competitive quantitative RT-PCR performed for TGF-beta mRNA using internal synthetic standard RNA. RESULTS: In normal intestinal mucosa, by immunohistochemistry, TGF-beta expression was most prominent in the villous tip epithelium, whereas in the lamina propria, weak immunoreactivity was present. The celiac mucosa showed weak and patchy epithelial TGF-beta immunoreactivity. In contrast, an intense staining positivity was present in the lamina propria localized mostly in the subepithelial region where T cells, macrophages, and CD25+ cells were detected by double staining. By quantitative RT-PCR, levels of TGF-beta mRNA transcripts appeared to be increased in celiac intestinal mucosa compared with that in control subjects, although the difference did not reach statistical significance. CONCLUSIONS: These observations suggest that TGF-beta expression is associated with differentiated enterocyte function. In celiac disease the lower TGF-beta epithelial cell expression could be a consequence of the preponderance of a less differentiated epithelial cell phenotype also present in the surface epithelium. In contrast, the prominent TGF-beta positivity of the subepithelial lamina propria suggests an association with the local immune and inflammatory response, as well as a potential role of these peptides in mesenchymal-epithelial cell interaction.},

There is a concern, therefore, that routine serum immunoglobulin (Ig) A testing of all cases of suspected coeliac disease may lead to unnecessary biopsy. METHODS: Four hundred eighty-two routine consecutive samples from cases of suspected coeliac disease or malabsorption (109 children) were tested for IgA anti-endomysium and total IgA. Four hundred twenty-four sera samples also had IgG antigliadin checked for high-titre antibody. Archived adult sera from 31 patients with coeliac disease and 52 disease control subjects were included in the study. RESULTS: Seven routine cases with serum IgA less than 15% of the mean normal for age and four cases with undetectable IgA were identified. Four patients, including three of four with clear deficiency, underwent small bowel biopsy, and all four had normal histologic findings and normal intraepithelial lymphocyte counts. Only one of the seven had high-titre IgG antigliadin antibody but that patient had normal histologic findings. One (3%) of 31 adults with established coeliac disease and 1 (2%) of 52 control subjects were IgA deficient. CONCLUSIONS: Of patients with IgA deficiency, only those with both IgA deficiency and high-titre IgG antigliadin antibody should be routinely considered for biopsy.},

   abstract = {Life-long gluten-free diet is the established therapy of coeliac disease. Patients suffering from dermatitis herpetiformis benefit from the same treatment. In Norway the gluten-free diet has excluded oats as well as wheat, rye and barley. The basis for this recommendation was a 1972 report indicating that ten out of 23 children consuming oats as part of their gluten-free diet for at least 18 months developed signs of damage to the intestinal mucosa. During the last decades, the clinical picture of coeliac disease has changed as a result of better diagnostic tools. Controlled clinical trials during the last few years indicate that some patients may tolerate small amounts of oats in their gluten-free diet. As a consequence, patients may be confused with regard to what dietary regime is recommended in coeliac disease. Compliance with gluten-free diet is important to secure growth and development, the all-round condition, fertility, bone density and a reduced risk of nutrient deficiency and malignancy. Consensus on dietary treatment is essential. A number of controlled trials are under way and the outcome of these studies will in a few years determine whether oats might be included in the standard gluten-free diet. So far oats are not recommended. The physician who makes the diagnosis is responsible for all patients getting adequate dietary counselling and management. Dietary advice given by health personnel must be consistent.},

The aim of this study was to assess the prevalence of H. pylori, the related symptoms, and the endoscopic and histologic gastric features in children with celiac disease. METHODS: Eight-one (24 boys, 57 girls; age range: 1.4-17.7 years, median 6.8) children with celiac disease were studied. All children had a blood sample taken. In a subgroup of 30 children who underwent endoscopy, three gastric biopsy specimens were taken for histology (hematoxylin and eosin, Giemsa, immunohistochemistry) and urease quick test. Symptom complaints were recorded. Age- and sex-matched (one case, one control) children without celiac disease were used for comparison. Serum H. pylori IgG were measured by means of a locally validated commercial enzyme-linked immunoassay. RESULTS: Overall, 15 of 81 (18.5%) children with celiac disease and 14 of 81 (17.3%) control children were positive for H. pylori. The percentage of H. pylori positivity was similar in children with untreated and treated celiac disease. Recurrent abdominal pain was the only symptom that helped to distinguish between H. pylori-positive and H. pylori-negative children. However, symptoms disappeared in patients with celiac disease after gluten withdrawal, irrespective of H. pylori status. All endoscopic (erythema, nodularity) and histologic (superficial-, interstitial-, lymphocytic-gastritis, activity, lymphoid follicles) findings did not differ between celiac and nonceliac H. pylori-positive children. CONCLUSIONS: Prevalence and clinical expressivity of H. pylori infection is not increased in children with celiac disease. The clinicopathologic pattern of the infection is not specifically influenced in this condition.},

The cumulative incidence was 1.9:1000 life-births. The disease presented typically in more than 60% of cases. In 65% of patients, symptoms appeared during the first 2 years of life, while, when diagnosed, 45% were below 2 years. Also, it was shown that coeliac disease presented significantly later in children diagnosed during the last five years (p < 0.05). In conclusion, coeliac disease in Croatia is more frequent than previously suspected. It presents early, mostly with classical symptoms, although a tendency towards later ages of diagnosis was observed during the last few years.},

   abstract = {Trehalose is a disaccharide, the main dietary source being mushrooms. It has been approved as an additive in the preparation of dried food. Isolated intestinal trehalase deficiency is found in 8% of Greenlanders, but is rare elsewhere. The normal range of trehalase activity and the incidence of isolated trehalase deficiency in the UK have not been reported. Patients (n 400) were investigated for suspected malabsorption. Endoscopic distal duodenal biopsies were taken for histological assessment and maltase, sucrase, lactase and trehalase estimation. Disaccharidase activities were determined by Dahlqvist's technique (Dahlqvist, 1968). Most patients (n 369) had normal duodenal histology. In these, square root transformation of trehalase activity produced a normal distribution. The normal range (mean +/- 2 SD) was 4.79-37.12 U/g protein. One patient had an isolated borderline trehalase deficiency. The thirty-one patients with villous atrophy had significantly reduced disaccharidase activities. With ingestion of a gluten-free diet, maltase, sucrase and trehalase activities recovered to normal in most patients, whereas lactase activity did not. The normal range and very low incidence of isolated enzyme deficiency is comparable with that described in populations from the USA and mainland Europe. Activity is significantly reduced in untreated coeliac disease and recovers with treatment with a gluten-free diet. There is no place for routine determination of trehalase activity in the UK population and there should be no concern over the introduction of trehalose-containing dried foods.},

   abstract = {Celiac disease is a permanent intolerance to ingested gluten that results in immunologically mediated inflammatory damage to the small-intestinal mucosa. Celiac disease is associated with both human leukocyte antigen (HLA) and non-HLA genes and with other immune disorders, notably juvenile diabetes and thyroid disease. The classic sprue syndrome of steatorrhea and malnutrition coupled with multiple deficiency states may be less common than more subtle and often monosymptomatic presentations of the disease. Diverse problems such as dental anomalies, short stature, osteopenic bone disease, lactose intolerance, infertility, and nonspecific abdominal pain among many others may be the only manifestations of celiac disease. The rate at which celiac disease is diagnosed depends on the level of suspicion for the disease. Although diagnosis relies on intestinal biopsy findings, serologic tests are useful as screening tools and as an adjunct to diagnosis. The treatment of celiac disease is lifelong avoidance of dietary gluten. Gluten-free diets are now readily achievable with appropriate professional instruction and community support. Both benign and malignant complications of celiac disease occur but these can often be avoided by early diagnosis and compliance with a gluten-free diet.},

In support of this notion, the findings summarized in this report demonstrate that the infusion of monosodium glutamate (MSG) into the stomach (150 mmol/L, 3 mL), duodenum (150 mmol/L, 3 mL) and portal vein (10 mmol/L, 0.1 mL) increases afferent activity in the vagal gastric, celiac and hepatic nerves, suggesting the existence of glutamate sensors in the gastric wall, intestinal wall and hepatoportal region. Further, oral, gastric and intestinal infusions of MSG (150 mmol/L, isotonic solution) and the infusion of MSG (10 mmol/L, 0.1 mL) into the portal vein resulted in reflex activation of the efferent gastric and pancreatic branches of the vagus. The intravenous injection of 10 mmol/L MSG (0.1 mL) also induced a reflex activation of the efferent discharges of the gastric branch of the vagus; however, in hepatic and celiac vagotomized rats, the intravenous injection of MSG (1 or 3mol/L, 1 mL) produced no effect on gastric vagal activity. The results of these experiments demonstrate the importance of the afferent nerve signals from visceral glutamate sensors in generating the reflex activation of gastrointestinal and pancreatic functions in response to MSG administration.},

   abstract = {BACKGROUND: Concurrent exocrine pancreatic dysfunction may be one of the factors implicated in malabsorption in untreated celiac disease, as shown by studies on bicarbonate and pancreatic enzyme secretion. The purpose of this study was to evaluate exocrine pancreatic function in relation to jejunal morphology in celiac disease. METHODS: Thirty-six patients fulfilling the ESPGHAN criteria for celiac disease, aged 3 to 18 years and 36 control subjects matched for age and sex were investigated. The design of the study included measurement of serum pancreatic isoamylase by a chromogenic method after selective inhibition of sialic isoamylase in the untreated phase in patients consuming a gluten-containing diet and after gluten elimination for a period of 1 year; fecal human elastase activity determined by enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay in patients consuming a gluten-free diet and again after gluten challenge for 6 months; correlation of serum pancreatic isoamylase and fecal elastase to the jejunal morphology, classified by criteria described by Marsch; the enzymes in the control group; and ultrasonography of the pancreas in both groups. RESULTS: Enzyme values obtained from celiac disease patients with normal mucosa were significantly higher than those obtained from patients with villous atrophy (p < 0.001) and comparable to those obtained from the control group. Serum pancreatic isoamylase activity increased to normal after gluten elimination, and human elastase activity decreased to values below 200 microg/g of stool after gluten challenge. Enzyme activity was related inversely to the degree of intestinal damage. The echogenicity of the pancreas was normal, regardless of enzyme activity or gut morphology. CONCLUSIONS: Exocrine pancreatic function is abnormal in celiac disease when mucosal atrophy is present. Exocrine pancreatic function parameters are associated with the changes of intestinal mucosal morphology in three consecutive phases of the disease.},

   abstract = {Epidemiological studies have demonstrated a marked negative relationship between diarrhoea and physical growth and development of a child. Each day of illness due to diarrhoea produces a weight deficit of 20-40 gms. Poor nutrition is associated with more serious prolonged diarrhoea. 'Catch-up growth' often does not occur in malnourished children. Malnutrition, particularly wasting, is a strong predictor of diarrhoeal duration and the prolonged illness could exacerbate nutritional faltering, thereby increasing the subsequent risk of death. Poor appetite, vomiting, deliberate withholding of food resulting in poor intake; malabsorption of macro and micronutrients; hastening of intestinal transit time; disturbance of metabolic and endocrine functions; and direct loss of protein and other nutrients in gastrointestinal tract are some of the known mechanisms which have an impact on the nutrition during an episode of diarrhea. In addition diarrhoea of infectious origin causes cytokine induced malnutrition which results from the actions of proinflammatory cytokines like tumour necrosis factor and interleukin 1, 6 and 8. Preexisting malnutrition is associated with decreased turnover of epithelial cells resulting in delayed recovery which may prolong an episode of infectious diarrhoea by itself as well as by promoting tissue invasion by other enteropathogens. Malnutrition may also alter protective host factors and thereby favour intestinal colonization by the pathogenic microbes. Mucosal damage varying from moderately severe changes to flat lesions indistinguishable from those of celiac disease may occur in kwashiorkar. Diarrhoea malnutrition interaction represents a dangerous web which can be distangled by prevention of disease transmission by promoting exclusive breast feeding, hygienic weaning practices, safe drinking water and handwashing, improved host defences by breast feeding, improved nutrition, measles vaccine and other vaccines against enteropathogens in the offing; and promotion of standard case management with special emphasis on nutritional support and rehabilitation.},

   abstract = {Celiac disease is a permanent gluten intolerance strongly associated with HLA class II antigens. The over presentation of particular HLA alleles and haplotypes has been described in several populations. Different lines of evidence obtained during the last years suggest that a particular HLA-DQ heterodimer, encoded by the DQA1*0501 and DQB1*0201 genes in cis or trans conformation, confers the primary disease susceptibility. We report the HLA class II allelic distribution and DQA1/ DQB1 genotypes in 62 Chilean celiac patients compared with 124 control subjects in Santiago, Chile. We found a pronounced increase of the "susceptible" alleles :DQA1*0501 (0.480 vs 0.169, Pc < 0.0005), DQB1*0302 (0.430 vs 0.242, Pc = 0.002) and DQB1*0201 (0.250 vs 0.125, Pc = 0.037) in celiac patients in comparison with control children. As for "protective" alleles, we detected a high frequency of DQA1*0101 (0.310 vs 0.160, Pc = 0.01), DQA1*0201 (0.105 vs 0.010, Pc < 0.0075) and DQB1*0301 (0.250 vs 0.100, Pc = 0.010) in controls. In relation to risk haplotypes, the main combination observed was the conformation DQ8 (DQB1*0302/DQA1*0301) over DQ2 (DQB1*0201/DQA1*0501). In conclusion, results show that celiac disease in Chilean patients is primarily associated with DQ8 conformation. This is concordant with the high frequency of DR4 alleles (in linkage disequilibrium with DQB1*0302) detected in Amerind groups in Chile, where DQB1*0302 is more frequent than DQB1*0201.},

   abstract = {UNLABELLED: Several gastrointestinal motor abnormalities have been detected in patients with celiac disease, but it is unclear whether they are able to influence the gastric emptying rate. The aim of this work was to evaluate the gastric emptying rate of solids in children with celiac disease before and after a gluten-free diet. Nine children with celiac disease and nine healthy controls (age range 4-16 y) underwent a 13C-octanoic acid breath test to measure gastric emptying. Half emptying time (t1/2) and lag phase (t(lag)) were calculated. After 6 mo of a gluten-free diet, all celiac children underwent a repeat 13C-octanoic acid breath test. The gastric motility parameters, t1/2 and t(lag), were significantly longer in patients than in controls. No significant correlation between abnormal gastric emptying and specific symptom patterns or severity of histological damage was found. On a gluten-free diet, the gastric emptying rate normalized in all celiac patients. This finding supports the hypothesis that gluten-driven mucosal inflammation might determine motor abnormalities by affecting smooth muscle contractility or impairing the release of neurotransmitters. Alternatively, nutrient malabsorption might determine significant changes in intraluminal milieu, which, in turn, may affect intestinal motor functions. CONCLUSION: patients affected by celiac disease have a markedly delayed gastric emptying of solids, which returns to normal after gluten withdrawal.},

The aim of this study is to evaluate the faecal composition in celiac children with malabsorption syndrome at the moment of diagnosis by using near-infrared reflectance spectroscopy and to compare it with that of healthy children. Thirty children with biopsy-proven celiac disease and 86 age-matched control children were recruited in our study. Children collected 24 hour faecal specimens and the analyses of faeces, water, fat, nitrogen and sugar were performed using near-infrared reflectance spectroscopy. Results show that celiac children daily eliminate a significantly greater quantity of water, fat, nitrogen and sugar than those in the control group. This might be due to the higher weight of faeces eliminated in the celiac group and, of course, to their celiac condition. Of all the nutrients, faecal fat is the substance which undergoes the greatest change, indicating that this nutrient continues to be the best parameter for dealing with patients with malabsorption syndrome. Near-infrared reflectance spectroscopy appears to be a useful tool for assessing stool composition in celiac disease.},

The histologic features of refractory/unclassified sprue have been published as case reports, often without long-term follow up, and no clear histologic picture has emerged. We present the results of a long-term study of the clinical and histologic features of 10 patients with refractory/unclassified sprue. The histologic features of small bowel biopsies in this group of patients were compared with those of 10 patients with responsive celiac disease and with 10 patients without malabsorption who had normal duodenal biopsies. Five of the 10 refractory patients ultimately developed collagenous sprue as a distinct histologic marker of refractory disease. Additional distinctive findings found in small bowel biopsies in the refractory group were subcryptal chronic inflammation (10 of 10) and marked mucosal thinning in three patients. Other nonspecific findings included acute inflammation and gastric metaplasia. One patient with collagenous sprue developed a B-cell lymphoma of the ileum, and in general collagenous sprue was associated with a poor prognosis. Two of five patients died whereas two others require total parenteral nutrition for survival. Pathologists evaluating small bowel biopsies in the setting of malabsorption should be aware of the subtle histologic changes described here that may portend a refractory course.},

   abstract = {Plasma levels of glucagon-like peptide-1 (GLP-1) rise rapidly after nutrient ingestion, suggesting the existence of a proximal gut signal regulating GLP-1 release from the L cells of the distal small intestine. Glucose-dependent insulinotropic peptide (GIP) has been shown to be one such proximal signal; however, the dependence of GIP on gastrin-releasing peptide, a neuromodulator, suggested a role for the nervous system in this proximal-distal loop. Investigations into the nature of this proximal signal were therefore conducted in an in situ model of the rat gastrointestinal system. Infusions of corn oil into a 10-cm segment of duodenum that was isolated by loose ligation (to ensure that the luminal contents did not progress to the ileal L cell) increased the secretion of GLP-1 in parallel with that of gut glucagon-like immunoreactivity (gGLI; r = 0.85; P < 0.05). Infusion of fat into a transected segment of duodenum also significantly raised gGLI secretion compared with saline infusion, reaching a peak value of 132 +/- 37 pg/ml above basal (P < 0.05). However, peak secretion was significantly delayed when the gut was transected compared with that after ligation alone (19 +/- 4 vs. 6 +/- 1 min, respectively; P < 0.05). Furthermore, bilateral subdiaphragmatic vagotomy in conjunction with gut transection completely abolished the fat-induced rise in gGLI secretion (P < 0.001). Consistent with a role for the vagus in the regulation of the L cell, stimulation of the distal end of the celiac branch of the subdiaphragmatic vagus nerve significantly stimulated the secretion of gGLI to a level of 71 +/- 14 pg/ml above basal (P < 0.05). As found previously, supraphysiological infusion of GIP significantly increased gGLI secretion in control animals by 123 +/- 32 pg/ml (P < 0.05); this was not prevented by hepatic branch vagotomy (96 +/- 25 pg/ml; P < 0.05). In contrast, although infusion of GIP at physiological levels into sham-vagotomized animals also increased gGLI secretion, by 40 +/- 6 pg/ml (P < 0.05), selective hepatic branch vagotomy abolished GIP-induced gGLI secretion (P < 0.05). The results of these experiments therefore demonstrate that the secretion of GLP-1 and gGLI from the ileal L cell in response to fat is regulated by a complex neuroendocrine loop, involving the enteric nervous system, the afferent and efferent vagus nerves, as well as the duodenal hormone GIP.},

Two hundred and four diabetic patients, less than 20 years old, were studied in order to diagnose these diseases. The prevalence of thyroid autoimmune disorders was 17.6% and, of those, chronic autoimmune thyroiditis was the most frequent. Microsomal autoantibodies correlated more accurately with the presence of chronic autoimmune thyroiditis than thyroglobulin autoantibodies. The thyroid status of most of the patients with positive markers was euthyroidism (77%), but subclinical hypothyroidism (11%), overt hypothyroidism (3%), subclinical hyperthyroidism (3%) and overt hyperthyroidism (6%) were also present. Autoimmune thyroid disorders were the most prevalent immunological processes affecting diabetic patients. No significant associations of thyroid autoimmunity and other autoimmunological disorders, such as celiac disease or presence of other autoimmune antibodies, were found.},

DESIGN: Sera were tested prospectively for IgA and IgG AGA by enzymed-linked immunosorbent assay and IgA EMA by immunofluorescence techniques on monkey esophagus and human umbilical cord sections in 95 pediatric patients referred for duodenal biopsies. PATIENTS: Ninety-five pediatric patients were referred for duodenal biopsies, with a clinical suspicion of celiac disease; 24 of those patients had celiac disease by criteria of the European Society for Pediatric Gastroenterology and Nutrition. SETTING: A pediatric gastroenterology clinic of a tertiary care pediatric university hospital. RESULTS: EMA testing on human umbilical cords was the most specific but was also the least sensitive. All the patients with biopsy-proven celiac disease were identified by either one or both serologic tests (100% combined sensitivity). The combination of AGA and EMA on monkey esophagus resulted in a negative predictive value of 100% accuracy. CONCLUSIONS: A combination of AGA and EMA tests resulted in 100% sensitivity and 100% negative predictive value, useful in selecting patients for duodenal biopsy.},

   abstract = {OBJECTIVES: To evaluate the impact of a 1-year gluten-free diet on bone metabolism and nutritional status in coeliac disease. METHODS: Bone mineral density, serum indices of bone remodelling, clinical and biochemical nutritional assessment were evaluated in 86 consecutive newly-diagnosed, biopsy proven, coeliac disease patients (untreated). A complete reevaluation, including intestinal biopsy, was repeated within 1 year of dietary treatment (treated). RESULTS: Untreated: according to WHO criteria, 34% of patients had a normal bone mineral density, 40% had osteopenia and 26% osteoporosis. Between males and females there were no statistical differences in bone metabolism or in most of the nutritional indices, while, between fertile and postmenopausal women, bone mineral density and several bone metabolism markers were significantly different. Compared to subjects with a normal bone mineral density, osteopenics had higher bone specific alkaline phosphatase (BAP) and Bone-Gla-protein (BGP) values. In patients with a concomitant BAP increase and 25OH vitamin D serum level reduction, bone mineral density and several bone turnover markers were statistically different compared to patients without such a serological pattern. Treated: notwithstanding intestinal biopsy which showed a mucosal recovery in only 57%, gluten-free diet led, even in postmenopausal women, to a significant improvement in bone mineral density, bone metabolism and nutrition, except for folic acid, albumin and pre-albumin serum levels which persisted as abnormal in patients with obdurate mucosal impairment. CONCLUSIONS: Coeliac disease patients are at high risk for developing a low bone mineral density and bone turnover impairment. A gluten-free diet can improve this situation even in postmenopausal women and in patients with incomplete mucosal recovery.},

   abstract = {BACKGROUND: Unrecognized celiac disease (CD) may be found in a substantial proportion of patients with type I diabetes mellitus. METHODS: A cohort of 403 Austrian children and adolescents with type I diabetes mellitus (210 males and 193 females; age range, 1-22 years) was screened for celiac disease using the IgA anti-endomysium antibody test (EMA) and the immunoglobulin (Ig)G anti-gliadin (AGA-IgG) and IgA anti-gliadin (AGA-IgA) antibody test. RESULTS: Twelve patients' sera (2.98%) yielded positive EMA results and two patients' sera (0.49%) with IgA deficiency had high AGA-IgG values. All but one of these patients underwent intestinal biopsy. Six (1.49%) had clear histologic evidence of CD (flat mucosa), whereas three (0.74%) showed minor histologic changes (increase in intraepithelial lymphocytes) and four (0.99%), including the EMA-negative patients with IgA deficiency, had a normal mucosa. When the cases with silent and potential CD were combined, the overall prevalence in the current cohort was 2.98%. There was no difference in the hemoglobin (Hb)A1c level between antibody-positive and -negative patients, and subsequent gluten-free diet did not change this metabolic parameter. CONCLUSION: The prevalence of clinically unrecognized CD, found by EMA screening, is much higher in Austrian children with diabetes than in a comparable population without diabetes. The prevalence of CD in diabetic children in Austria is distinctly lower, however, than in several other countries.},

However, in many this is not the case. This study aims to determine whether this persistent villous atrophy (VA) could be due to continued ingestion of the trace amounts of gluten in 'gluten-free' foods, as defined by the WHO/FAO Codex Alimentarius. METHODS: Duodenal biopsy specimens from 89 adults with long-standing coeliac disease were examined, and the findings correlated with their form of gluten-free diet. RESULTS: In 51 subjects the duodenal specimen was normal, whereas in 38 there was villous atrophy (partial, 28; subtotal, 8; total, 2). There was no relationship between the presence or absence of VA and ingestion of either a GFD as defined by the Codex Alimentarius (Codex-GFD; 39 patients) or a GFD that contained no detectable gluten (NDG diet: 50 patients). Intraepithelial lymphocyte counts were higher, and lactase levels lower, in subjects with an abnormal biopsy specimen than in those in whom it was normal. However, within each of these biopsy groups there was no difference in these variables between patients on a Codex-GFD and those on an NDG-GFD. IgA antigliadin antibody was detected in 4 of 29 patients on a Codex-GFD and in 3 of 13 on a NDG-GFD (NS). CONCLUSION: The persistent mucosal abnormalities seen in patients with coeliac disease on a GFD are not due to the ingestion of trace amounts of gluten. The consequences of these abnormalities have yet to be determined.},

   abstract = {Several gastrointestinal and liver diseases impair the absorption of calcium, phosphate, and/or vitamin D, and are associated with an increased incidence of bone disease. Changes in bone mineral density (BMD) using dual-energy X-ray absorptiomety (DXA) have been best studied in the malabsorptive disorder, celiac disease. Celiac disease is an inflammatory condition of the small intestine triggered by ingesting gluten present in wheat, rye, or barley. Chronic inflammation leads to intestinal atrophy and nutrient malabsorption. The disease affects the proximal small bowel; the site where calcium is best absorbed. About 70% of adults with celiac disease have abnormally low BMD values. Treatment with a gluten-free diet increases BMD, but not to normal values. As celiac disease may not be detected until adult life, the failure to reach normal BMD on a gluten-free diet can be explained, at least in part, by the failure to reach peak bone mass. All individuals with malabsorptive disorders should be screened for secondary bone disease. The development of easier and less expensive methods to assess BMD will facilitate screening those at risk for bone disease.},

   abstract = {UNLABELLED: It has recently been suggested that in adults with coeliac disease, faecal blood loss may play a role in the development of iron deficiency. A group of 45 children diagnosed with coeliac disease during 1996 and 1997 were therefore prospectively evaluated for the presence of gluten in their diet, iron deficiency anaemia, and faecal occult blood. Sixty children admitted for elective surgery or asthma served as controls. Faecal occult blood was found in four iron deficient children on normal diet, of whom three were newly diagnosed. Occult blood loss disappeared in three of the four children when gluten was removed from their diet. Faecal occult blood was found in 26.7% of children on gluten-containing diet, but not in children on gluten-free diet (P = 0.01), or in control children (P = 0.001). CONCLUSION: Our data suggest that the incidence of occult blood loss in coeliac disease occurs mainly in newly diagnosed cases and responds to a gluten-free diet. Occult blood testing may not be warranted in the absence of iron deficiency anaemia nor in children with iron deficiency anaemia who are on a gluten-free diet.},

   abstract = {BACKGROUND: Duodenal gastric metaplasia is rarely reported in untreated celiac disease, although it is seen in 60% to 100% of duodenal biopsy specimens in nonceliac patients with histologic duodenitis. The low incidence could represent underreporting, a decreased incidence in pediatric patients generally, or the more distal sampling site that is customary for most biopsy specimens that are obtained to diagnose celiac disease. It could also be a unique feature of the inflammatory reaction that characterizes this disease. The purpose of this study was to examine the incidence of gastric metaplasia in duodenal specimens from children with untreated celiac disease with special reference to patient age and biopsy site. METHOD: Formalin-fixed paraffin-embedded specimens of duodenal mucosa were selected from the pathology department's archival material. Sections were either stained histochemically or by immunochemical methods, according to an antigen-retrieval protocol. Forty-four duodenal specimens from untreated patients with celiac disease (n = 22) and control subjects of similar age with normal histology (n = 22) were examined. Ten of each were obtained during upper endoscopy from the proximal duodenum (proximal site) and 12 of each by Crosby capsule near the ligament of Treitz (distal site). RESULTS: All specimens from patients with celiac disease exhibited marked villous atrophy. None had been noted to have gastric metaplasia during routine examination of sections stained by hematoxylin and eosin. Fifteen (68%) of 22 of the celiac specimens and 2 of 22 (9%) control specimens contained gastric metaplasia, identified as patches of gastric-type cells containing MUC5AC (gastric mucin), pS2 (gastric trefoil factor) and neutral (periodic acid-Schiff-positive) mucin. Five of the seven celiac specimens that had no metaplasia showed increased numbers of goblet cells expressing gastric markers. The incidence of gastric metaplasia was not different for endoscopic (70%) or capsule (67%) specimens. Sixty-eight percent (7/11) of patients aged less than 3 years had gastric metaplasia. CONCLUSION: The presence of gastric metaplasia has been previously underreported in celiac disease specimens. Detection would be improved by the routine use of period acid-Schiff/ alcian blue staining. The incidence of gastric metaplasia in celiac disease is not significantly influenced by biopsy site or age at time of the biopsy.},

   abstract = {BACKGROUND: Celiac disease (CD) is a permanent gluten intolerance disorder characterized by malabsorption, intestinal mucosa villus atrophy, and crypt hyperplasia. Clinical and histologic features improve in persons consuming a gluten free diet. The pathogenesis of CD involves environmental, genetic, and immunologic factors. METHODS: The frequencies of human leukocyte antigen (HLA) class II alleles were evaluated in white Brazilian patients who had CD and compared with those observed in healthy individuals from the same geographical area (Ribeirao Preto, Sao Paulo) and of similar ethnic background. Twenty-five patients with CD, 11 females and 14 males, and 91 control individuals were studied. The HLA class II alleles were typed using amplified DNA hybridized with sequence-specific primers. Statistical analysis was performed using the two-tailed Fisher exact test. The relative risk (RR), etiologic fraction (EF), and preventive fraction (PF) were also estimated. The EF represents the attributable risk for the development of CD at the population level, whereas PF represents the protective risk. RESULTS: The frequency of the HLA-DRB1*03, HLA-DRB1*07, and HLA-DQB1*02 alleles was significantly increased in patients. The RR conferred by these alleles was 5.35, 7.15, and 10.6, respectively, and the EF was 48.7%, 44.7%, and 76%, respectively. The frequency of HLA-DQB1*06 alleles was significantly decreased in CD patients, conferring an RR of 0.08 and a PF of 48%. CONCLUSIONS: The results show that HLA-DRB1*03, HLA-DRB1*07, and HLA-DQB1*02 alleles conferred susceptibility to CD in Brazilian patients. In contrast, HLADQB1*06 alleles conferred protection against development of the disease.},

INVESTIGATIONS: Serum levels of potassium (2.2 mmol/l) and calcium (1.45 mmol/l) were low, as well as the levels of total protein (5.1 g/dl) and albumin (2.94 g/dl). Clotting time was prolonged (Quick 51%). The ECG showed a ventricular bigeminus and a prolonged QT-period (120% rel). Endoscopy and biopsy showed a total villous atrophy suggesting celiac disease as probable cause. This was emphasized by the high antibody levels against gliadin (1:80) and endomyosin (1:40). Furthermore, the Human Leukocyte Antigen molecules HLA-B8 and HLA-DR3 showed increased expression. TREATMENT AND COURSE: After normalizing the electrolyte imbalance intravenously the neurological symptoms disappeared as well as the arrhythmia. The QT-period went back to normal. Under initial drip feeding and a strict gluten-free diet the general condition improved quickly and the diarrhea stopped. A follow-up investigation 3 months later showed the woman in a good condition having gained 10 kg weight and an improvement in histological findings, so that diagnosis of celiac disease could be proved. CONCLUSIONS: The possibility of ventricular arrhythmia and a prolonged QT-period in the ECG should be taken into account for patients diagnosed with celiac disease, especially in case of electrolyte imbalance. In these cases addition to a strict gluten free diet a rapid correction of the electrolyte imbalance is necessary because of the risk of sudden cardiac death. Furthermore associated disorders like autoimmune diseases expressing the same HLA-antigens (HLA-B8 and HLA-DR3) must be considered. Combined incidence of celiac disease and autoimmune hypothyroidism is well documented. For patients with celiac disease we therefore recommend a routine testing of thyroid hormone levels.},

   abstract = {BACKGROUND: Patients with cystic fibrosis who have steatorrhea frequently are underweight and have essential fatty acid (EFA) depletion, which is associated with a poor clinical course. It has been stated that poor EFA status is difficult to correct in patients with cystic fibrosis, and an impaired EFA metabolism with reduced synthesis of long-chain polyunsaturated fatty acids has been proposed. In this study, the effects of an oral energy supplement rich in linoleic acid were investigated in patients with cystic fibrosis who had a body weight below 95% of normal for height. METHODS: Thirty-six patients (16 girls) more than 4 years of age were randomized either to a control group (n = 20, age 13.3 +/- 3.8 years, mean +/- SD) receiving intensive dietary counseling only, or an intervention group (n = 16, age, 10.4 +/- 4.3 years) treated for 3 months with dietary counseling plus 628 +/- 254 mL (= kcal) per day of an energy supplement rich in fat (31% of energy) and linoleic acid (16% of energy). RESULTS: In contrast to the control group, the patients with supplemented diets achieved significant increases of energy intake (2189 +/- 731 kcal/day vs. 2733 +/- 762 kcal/day), weight for height (82.8% +/- 8.6% vs. 84.8% +/- 9.6% of normal), and body fat (5.1 +/- 1.7 kg vs. 5.8 +/- 2.2 kg) as well as the initially low values of plasma phospholipid linoleic acid (11.8% +/- 1.1% vs. 17.6% +/- 1.6% of total phospholipid fatty acids) and its main metabolite arachidonic acid (4.4% +/- 0.4% vs. 5.9% +/- 0.3%). CONCLUSIONS: Patients with cystic fibrosis with low body weight and poor EFA status benefit from EFA-rich energy supplements and can synthesize arachidonic acid from the precursor linoleic acid.},

   abstract = {BACKGROUND: Serologic methods have been used widely to test for celiac disease and have gained importance in diagnostic definition and in new epidemiologic findings. However, there is no standardization, and there are no reference protocols and materials. METHODS: The European working group on Serological Screening for Celiac Disease has defined robust noncommercial test protocols for immunoglobulin (Ig)G and IgA gliadin antibodies and for IgA autoantibodies against endomysium and tissue transglutaminase. Standard curves were linear in the decisive range, and intra-assay variation coefficients were less than 5% to 10%. Calibration was performed with a group reference serum. Joint cutoff limits were used. Seven laboratories took part in the final collaborative study on 252 randomized sera classified by histology (103 pediatric and adult patients with active celiac disease, 89 disease control subjects, and 60 blood donors). RESULTS: IgA autoantibodies against endomysium and tissue transglutaminase rendered superior sensitivity (90% and 93%, respectively) and specificity (99% and 95%, respectively) over IgA and IgG gliadin antibodies. Tissue transglutaminase antibody testing showed superior receiver operating characteristic performance compared with gliadin antibodies. The K values for interlaboratory reproducibility showed superiority for IgA endomysium (0.93) in comparison with tissue transglutaminase antibodies (0.83) and gliadin antibodies (0.82 for IgG, 0.62 for IgA). CONCLUSIONS: Basic criteria of standardization and quality assessment must be fulfilled by any given test protocol proposed for serologic investigation of celiac disease. The working group has produced robust test protocols and reference materials available for standardization to further improve reliability of serologic testing for celiac disease.},

   abstract = {BACKGROUND & AIMS: Treatment of human exocrine pancreatic insufficiency is suboptimal. This study assessed the effects of bacterial lipase, porcine lipase, and diets on carbohydrate, fat, and protein absorption in pancreatic-insufficient dogs. METHODS: Dogs were given bacterial or porcine lipase and 3 diets: a 48% carbohydrate, 27% fat, and 25% protein standard diet; a high-carbohydrate, low-fat, and low-protein diet; or a low-carbohydrate, high-fat, and high-protein diet (66%/18%/16% and 21%/43%/36% calories). RESULTS: With the standard diet, coefficient of fat absorption increased dose-dependently with both lipases (P < 0.05), but more fat was absorbed with porcine lipase (P < 0.05); 600, 000 IU of bacterial lipase (240 mg) and 300,000 IU of porcine lipase (18 g) nearly abolished steatorrhea. With 300,000 IU of bacterial lipase or 135,000 IU of porcine lipase, fat absorption was greater with the high-fat and -protein diet (P < 0.05 vs. low-fat and -protein diet). There were no interactions among carbohydrate, fat, and protein absorption. CONCLUSIONS: Correcting steatorrhea requires 75 times more porcine than bacterial lipase (18 vs. 240 mg). High-fat and high-protein diets optimize fat absorption with both enzymes. High-fat diets with bacterial or porcine lipase should be evaluated in humans with pancreatic steatorrhea.},

Bone mass is maintained by this delicate equilibrium between bone formation and bone resorption. In growing children, the balance is tilted toward bone formation until peak bone mass is achieved in the second decade of life. Alterations in bone metabolism can result in decreased bone mass (osteopenia and osteoporosis) or impaired mineralization of the bone protein matrix (rickets and osteomalacia). Diseases of the alimentary tract such as celiac disease, inflammatory bowel diseases, gastrectomy, cholestatic liver diseases, liver transplantation, and hepatitis C can affect bone mineralization, remodeling, or bone mass.

   abstract = {Our laboratory has investigated the role of the neuropeptide galanin in the sympathetic neural control of both the canine endocrine pancreas and liver. Galanin mRNA and peptide were found in the neuronal cell bodies of the celiac ganglion, which projects fibers to both organs. Galanin fibers formed dense networks around the islets. Galanin was released from these nerves and the amount released appeared sufficient to markedly inhibit basal insulin secretion. We therefore propose that galanin is a sympathetic neurotransmitter in canine endocrine pancreas. Galanin was also found in hepatic nerves usually co-localized with tyrosine hydroxylase, a sympathetic marker. Further, intraportal administration of the sympathetic neurotoxin, 6-hydroxydopamine, abolished galanin staining in the hepatic parenchyma. We evaluated the role of galanin in mediating the actions of sympathetic nerves to increase hepatic glucose production and decrease hepatic arterial conductance. Local infusion of synthetic galanin had little effect by itself, but it did potentiate the action of norepinephrine to stimulate hepatic glucose production, demonstrating a neuromodulatory action. In contrast, galanin had no effect on hepatic arterial blood flow. We therefore propose that in the liver galanin functions as a neuromodulator of norepinephrine's metabolic action.},

Diagnosis of this treatable condition is often delayed or missed because of a failure to appreciate that celiac disease can present at any age and that symptoms are often subtle and not clearly related to gastrointestinal disease. Nonspecific symptoms and nutritional deficiencies are especially common in older patients and may not always be investigated thoroughly. Use of serological screening tests has improved ease of detection of celiac disease in patients without classical symptoms.},

There are unusual manifestations like refractory anemia, rickets, recurrent abdominal pain and short stature without other gastrointestinal manifestations. Definitive diagnosis still requires undertaking multiple intestinal biopsies, before and after wheat withdrawal from the diet. Additional difficulty in diagnosing celiac in tropical countries like India includes confounding factors of malnutrition and parasitic infestations like giardia. Serological tests like antigliadin antibodies (IgG and IgA), anti-reticulin antibodies and endomysial antibodies have shown some promise in screening and definitive evaluation of the disease. Gluten free diet gives dramatic results.},

   abstract = {BACKGROUND: Cereal grains are recognized as the cause of adverse reactions in some patients exposed to grain or flour by either inhalation or ingestion. Cereal-related diseases, such as celiac disease and baker's asthma, have been well studied and the causative cereal proteins have been characterized. Although cereals form an essential part of daily nutrition, the allergenic proteins causing symptoms on ingestion in atopic dermatitis (AD) have remained obscure. In this study, we have investigated the allergenic fraction of wheat in AD. METHODS: Skin prick tests (SPT) with a NaCl wheat suspension and the ethanol-soluble wheat gliadin were performed on 18 wheat-challenge-positive or -negative children with AD, six adult AD patients with suspected cereal allergy, and one adult with wheat-dependent exercise-induced urticaria/anaphylaxis. Serum total IgE and specific IgE-antibody levels to wheat and gluten were measured with the radioallergosorbent test (RAST) simultaneously. In addition serum samples of all 25 patients were analyzed by IgE immunoblotting with the ethanol-soluble wheat-protein extract. RESULTS: Thirteen of the AD children were wheat-challenge-positive, 11/12 of them appeared to be positive with gliadin SPT, and all had an elevated gluten RAST value. Those challenge-negative were negative with both gliadin SPT and gluten RAST. Positive wheat SPT and RAST alone were not associated with positive challenges. Four of the adult patients responded to a cereal-free diet, although only two of them appeared to be positive with gliadin SPT and gluten RAST. A broad and intensive staining of gliadin peptides in IgE-immunoblotting studies was seen in challenge-positive children with positive gliadin SPT and/ or gluten RAST. Besides staining of peptides in the main gliadin area of 30-46 kDa, a characteristic finding was the staining of small, <14-kDa proteins with sera of challenge- and gliadin-SPT-positive patients. CONCLUSIONS: We found that wheat-allergic AD patients have IgE antibodies against gliadin that can be detected by both SPT and the sensitive immunoblotting method. This suggests that gliadin peptides are important allergens, and ingestion of wheat causes symptoms of AD. A broad and intensive IgE staining was seen of gliadin peptides against both the previously characterized peptides in the main gliadin area and small, previously uncharacterized peptides of less than 14 kDa. The gliadin SPT and gluten RAST are good screening methods. Further characterization of the IgE-stained gliadin proteins is needed.},

   abstract = {BACKGROUND: Tissue transglutaminase has recently been identified as the main autoantigen recognized by antiendomysial antibodies in celiac disease. Serum immunoglobulin (Ig)A antibodies to tissue transglutaminase (tTG-ab) determined by an enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay (ELISA) technique have been reported to correlate closely with IgA antiendomysial antibodies (EMA). The purpose of this study was to assess the sensitivity, specificity, and predictive value of tTG-ab measured by a commercially available ELISA technique, compared with those of EMA and IgA antigliadin antibodies (AGA) for the diagnosis of celiac disease. METHODS: Twenty-seven serum samples were obtained from patients with untreated celiac disease, 37 from patients who had had gluten withdrawn from their diets for varying time spans, and 34 from control subjects without celiac disease. All were younger than 14 years. Presence of tTG-ab and AGA was determined by ELISA and of EMA by indirect immunofluorescence. RESULTS: Twenty-six of 27 serum samples obtained from patients at the time of diagnosis of celiac disease were AGA positive. All 27 (concordance rate 100%) were positive for EMA and tTG-ab. Of the 34 control subjects, 1 was for AGA and 2 for tTG-ab. All 34 were negative for EMA. Sensitivity, specificity, positive predictive value, and negative predictive value within this group were, for tTG-ab: 100%, 94%, 93%, and 100%, respectively; for EMA: all four indexes were 100%; and for AGA: 96%, 97%, 96%, and 97%, respectively. Of the 37 with treated celiac disease, 2 were AGA positive, 9 were EMA positive, and 6 were tTG-ab positive. The concordance rate between EMA and tTG-ab was 100% in the group with untreated celiac disease, 94% in the control subjects, and 76% in the group with treated celiac disease. CONCLUSIONS: Immunoglobulin A antibodies to tissue transglutaminase are new, highly sensitive, and specific markers of celiac disease. They can be determined easily by an accurate, comparatively cheap technique and thereby may advantageously replace the EMA marker traditionally used.},

   abstract = {Coeliac disease is a gluten-sensitive enteropathy which results in a permanent malabsorption of nutrients in that portion of the small intestine (the jejunum) that is damaged. A genetic, inheritable disease, it is directly related to ingestion of certain wheat proteins especially found in rye secalins, barley hordeins and, in a much lower amount, oat avenins. A fundamental role in the pathological response is played by grain prolamins (gliadins). The actual damage to intestinal mucosa is almost certainly mediated by the immune system but its mechanism has not been so far clarified. Coeliac disease incidence rate is ever increasing among children and adolescents and it is rather frequently reported as relapsing in the third and fourth decade. The most distressing problems of malabsorption syndrome are diarrhea, weight loss, meteorism, abdominal pain, vomiting and asthenia; nonetheless, not all patients report symptoms. Both diagnosis and differential diagnosis--intestinal lymphoma, refractory sprue--prove difficult: a diagnosis of gluten intolerance can be made through careful consideration of a series of laboratory findings which are being improved by researchers in order to avoid delays for patients with probable gluten-sensitive enteropathy with non-specific symptoms. Although there may be many clinical signs and laboratory tests indicating probable malabsorption, the likely gold standard of diagnosing coeliac disease remains to be the jejunal biopsy.},

   abstract = {We aimed to assess the growth, diabetes control, dietary intake and compliance with a gluten-free diet in children with insulin dependent diabetes mellitus (IDDM) and coeliac disease in a major paediatric and adolescent diabetes clinic. Children with IDDM and biopsy-proven coeliac disease aged <18 years were included and compared with IDDM controls matched for age, sex and duration of diabetes. Twenty patients with coeliac disease and IDDM participated (15 female, age 7.4-17.3 yr), with two matched IDDM controls for each (age 6.9-17.4 yr). The prevalence of coeliac disease in this diabetes clinic population was 2.6%. All patients completed a 3 day food record (3DFR) and a 7 day food frequency questionnaire (FFQ) to assess dietary intake and gluten-free compliance. Diabetes control measured by HbA1c was not different between groups or compared to the overall clinic population (8.48 +/- 0.98% for coeliac patients vs 8.87 +/- 1.46 for IDDM controls vs 8.60 +/- 1.30 for overall clinic population aged 5.0-17.9 yr). Height, weight and BMI standard deviation scores were not different between coeliac patients and IDDM controls. No clinically significant differences were found in intake of energy, macronutrients or micronutrients. The proportion of energy intake from carbohydrate, protein and fat was within recommended ranges, except for a higher saturated fat intake. Only 30% of coeliac patients complied with a strict gluten-free diet, but growth parameters were unaffected by dietary compliance. Thus, we found that children and adolescents with coexisting IDDM and coeliac disease have normal growth, equivalent diabetes control and no differences in energy or nutrient intake compared to matched IDDM controls in our clinic population.},

   abstract = {BACKGROUND: Numerous studies in Europe have documented a high prevalence of celiac disease in Down syndrome. This study was undertaken to estimate the prevalence of celiac disease in Down syndrome in the southeastern United States. METHODS: Seventy-five patients with Down syndrome were screened using immunoglobulin (Ig)A-anti antiendomysium antibodies, IgA-antigliadin antibodies, and total IgA level. When either antiendomysium or antigliadin antibodies produced positive findings, patients were referred to a pediatric gastroenterologist for consideration of a duodenal biopsy. RESULTS: Thirteen percent (10/75) were positive for antiendomysium antibodies. Half of these patients were also positive for antigliadin antibodies. Six of 10 patients positive for antiendomysium antibodies underwent intestinal biopsy. Changes consistent with celiac disease were documented in five. Histologic findings ranged from focal to total villous atrophy. None had IgA deficiency. CONCLUSIONS: There was a high prevalence of positivity to antiendomysium antibody in Down syndrome. Antiendomysium antibody was a more sensitive screening test than antigliadin antibody. The prevalence of celiac disease in Down syndrome in the southeastern United States was 1 in 14 cases. Screening with antiendomysium antibody and IgA for all children with Down syndrome is recommended, even if there are no gastrointestinal symptoms.},

   abstract = {The gut and the liver are the key organs in nutrient absorption and metabolism. Bile acids, drugs, and toxins undergo extensive enterohepatic circulation. Bile acids play a major role in several hepatic and intestinal diseases. Endotoxins deriving from intestinal Gram-negative bacteria are important in the pathogenesis of liver and systemic diseases. Chronic liver diseases can influence gastrointestinal motility, which together with other factors may contribute to bacterial overgrowth and in patients with ascites to an increased risk of spontaneous bacterial peritonitis. Patients with end-stage liver disease frequently develop portal hypertension leading to varices, gastric vascular ectasia, and portal hypertensive gastroenteropathy. Several liver and biliary abnormalities are observed in patients with inflammatory bowel disease (primary sclerosing cholangitis, autoimmune hepatitis, cholelithiasis). The primary defect in hemochromatosis is located in the intestine, causing an inappropriate increase in iron absorption, and the liver is the site of earliest and heaviest iron deposition. Elevated transaminases are observed in many patients with celiac disease, and steatohepatitis frequently develops in patients with jejunoileal bypass and short bowel syndrome. Furthermore, the liver is the primary organ for metastasis of intestinal cancer. Many viral, bacterial, fungal, and parasitic diseases affect the intestine as well as the liver and the biliary tract.},
