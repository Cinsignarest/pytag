   abstract = {BACKGROUND: Enterocyte damage is the hallmark of coeliac disease (CD) resulting in malabsorption. Little is known about the recovery of enterocyte damage and its clinical consequences. Serum intestinal fatty acid binding protein (I-FABP) is a sensitive marker to study enterocyte damage. AIMS: To evaluate the severity of enterocyte damage in adult-onset CD and its course upon a gluten-free diet (GFD). Furthermore, the correlation among enterocyte damage, CD autoantibodies and histological abnormalities during the course of disease is studied. METHODS: Serum I-FABP levels were determined in 96 biopsy-proven adult CD patients and in 69 patients repeatedly upon a GFD. A total of 141 individuals with normal antitissue transglutaminase antibody (IgA-tTG) levels served as controls. I-FABP levels were related to the degree of villous atrophy (Marsh grade) and IgA-tTG. RESULTS: I-FABP levels were elevated in untreated CD (median 691 pg/mL) compared with controls (median 178 pg/mL, P < 0.001) and correlated with Marsh grade (r = 0.265, P < 0.05) and IgA-tTG (r = 0.403, P < 0.01). Upon a GFD serum levels decreased significantly, however, not within the range observed in controls, despite the common observed normalisation of IgA-tTG levels and Marsh grade. CD patients with elevated I-FABP levels nonresponding to GFD showed persistent histological abnormalities. CONCLUSIONS: Enterocyte damage assessed by serum I-FABP correlates with the severity of villous atrophy in coeliac disease at the time of diagnosis. Although enterocyte damage improves upon treatment, substantial enterocyte damage persists despite absence of villous atrophy and low IgA-tTG levels in the majority of cases. Elevated I-FABP levels nonresponding to gluten-free diet are indicative of histological abnormalities and warrant further evaluation.},

   abstract = {Complementary food is needed when human milk (or infant formula) alone is no longer sufficient for nutritional reasons. The timing of introduction needs to be determined on an individual basis although 6 months of exclusive breastfeeding can be recommended for most healthy term infants. Solid foods are intended to 'complement' ongoing breastfeeding with those dietary items whose intake has become marginal or insufficient. Both breastfeeding and complementary feeding can have direct or later consequences on health. Possible short-term health effects concern growth velocity and infections while possible long-term effects may relate to obesity, cardiovascular disease, autoimmunity (celiac disease and type 1 diabetes) and atopic disorders. For most of these it is impossible on the basis of the available evidence to conclude on the age when risks related to the start of complementary feeding are lowest or highest, with the possible exception of infections and early growth velocity. For undesirable health consequences, whilst potential mechanisms are recognized, the evidence from mostly observational studies is insufficient and requires more and prospective research. While the 6-month goal is desirable, introduction of suitable complementary food after 4 completed months with ongoing breastfeeding can be considered without adverse health consequences for infants living in affluent countries. Even less evidence on the consequences of the timing of complementary food introduction is available for formula-fed infants.},

   abstract = {Disintegration of the colonic epithelial barrier is considered a key event in the initiation and progression of inflammatory bowel and celiac disease. As the primary etiology of these diseases remains unknown, we hypothesized that the trichothecene deoxynivalenol (DON), a fungal metabolite found in grain-based human diets, might be one of the triggers resulting in an impairment of the intestinal tight junction network preceding an inflammatory response. Using horizontal impedance measurements, we demonstrate that DON disintegrates a human Caco-2 cell monolayer within <1 h after exposure to concentrations as low as 1.39 muM. This initial trigger is followed by a decrease in transepithelial resistance and an increased permeability of marker molecules, such as lucifer yellow and FITC-labeled dextran. In parallel, the increase in paracellular transport of FITC-dextran is demonstrated in vivo in B6C3F1 mice, challenged orally with DON. In vitro claudin protein levels are decreased and correlated with a displacement within the cells in vitro and in vivo, accompanied by a compensatory up-regulation of mRNA levels of claudins and their binding partner ZO-1. In treated mice, alterations in villus architecture in the entire intestinal tract resemble the disintegration of the epithelial barrier, a characteristic of chronic inflammatory bowel disease.},

   abstract = {Multiple animal models have been employed to study human atherosclerosis, the principal cause of mortality in the United States. Each model has individual advantages related to specific pathologies. Initiation, the earliest disease phase, is best modeled by the White Carneau (WC-As) pigeon. Atherosclerosis develops spontaneously in the WC-As without either external manipulation or known risk factors. Furthermore, susceptibility is caused by a single gene defect inherited in an autosomal recessive manner. The Show Racer (SR-Ar) pigeon is resistant to atherosclerosis. Breed differences in the biochemistry and metabolism of celiac foci cells have been described. For example, WC-As have lower oxidative metabolism but higher amounts of chondroitin-6-sulfate and nonesterified fatty acids compared with SR-Ar. Gene expression in aortic smooth muscle cells was compared between breeds using representational difference analysis and microarray analysis. Energy metabolism and cellular phenotype were the chief gene expression differences. Glycolysis and synthetic cell types were related to the WC-As but oxidative metabolism and contractile cell types were related to the SR-Ar. Rosiglitazone, a PPARgamma agonist, blocked RNA binding motif (RBMS1) expression in WC-As cells. The drug may act through the c-myc oncogene as RBMS1 is a c-myc target. Proteomic tests of aortic smooth muscle cells supported greater glycosylation in the WC-As and a transforming growth factor beta effect in SR-Ar. Unoxidized fatty acids build up in WC-As cells because of their metabolic deficiency, ultimately preventing the contractile phenotype in these cells. The single gene responsible for the disease is likely regulatory in nature.},

   abstract = {BACKGROUND: The oat seed storage proteins are mainly composed of two classes: the globulins and avenins. Among the major cereals, the globulins are the major seed protein class in rice and oats, and along with the higher protein content of oats is the basis for the relative higher nutrition content in oats compared to the other cereals. The second major class of oat seed proteins is the avenins; also classified as prolamins - seed proteins high in proline and glutamine amino acids. The prolamins are associated with celiac disease, an autoimmune disorder of the gastrointestinal tract. In spite of their importance, neither the oat globulins nor the avenins have been completely analyzed and described for any single germplasm. RESULTS: Using available EST resources for a single hexaploid oat cultivar, the spectrum of avenin and globulin sequences are described for the gene coding regions and the derived protein sequences. The nine unique avenin sequences are suggested to be divided into 3-4 distinct subclasses distributed in the hexaploid genome. The globulins from the same germplasm include 24 distinct sequences. Variation in globulin size results mainly from a glutamine-rich domain, similar to as in the avenins, and to variation in the C-terminal sequence domain. Two globulin genes have premature stop codons that shorten the resulting polypeptides by 9 and 17 amino acids, and eight of the globulin sequences form a branch of the globulins not previously reported. CONCLUSIONS: A more complete description of the major oat seed proteins should allow a more thorough analysis of their contributions to those oat seed characteristics related to nutritional value, evolutionary history, and celiac disease association.},

Even though several tests are available to assist the diagnosis, CD remains a biopsy-defined disorder, thus any non-invasive or less invasive diagnostic tool may be beneficial. The analysis of volatile metabolites in exhaled breath, given its non-invasive nature, is particularly promising as a screening tool of disease in symptomatic or non-symptomatic patients. In this preliminary study the proton transfer reaction time of flight mass spectrometry coupled to a buffered end-tidal on-line sampler to investigate metabolites in the exhaled breath of patients affected by coeliac disease under a gluten free diet was applied. Both H3O(+) or NO(+) were used as precursor ions. In our investigation no differences were found in the exhaled breath of CD patients compared to healthy controls. In this study, 33 subjects were enrolled: 16 patients with CD, all adhering a gluten free diet, and 17 healthy controls. CD patients did not show any symptom of the disease at the time of breath analysis; thus the absence of discrimination from healthy controls was not surprising.},

   abstract = {Celiac disease (CD) is now considered, more than a just gluten sensitivity enteropathy, a multiple and systemic immune-mediate disorder triggered by the ingestion of wheat gluten and related proteins. Following the discovery of a link between gluten and CD, it was demonstrated that gliadin, one of the two principal protein groups comprising gluten, plays a key role in CD. It has since become clear that the different and crucial roles of gliadin in CD result from its ability to activate multiple signaling pathways that modulate CD pathology. Most of these pathways involve the host innate and adaptive immune responses, but some pathways are activated when gliadin interacts with the intestinal cellular compartment. The long pentraxin (PTX3), a marker of the acute-phase inflammatory response, plays an important role in innate immunity and in modulation of the adaptive immune response. We investigated whether CD patients, considered as a model of gluten-sensitivity condition, have increased PTX3 levels. Our data showed that PTX3 serum levels were high in active CD patients and serum levels of PTX3 correlated with DGP IgA levels. We provide evidences that the bad compliance of GFD in patients 2 concurred with a pathological PTX3 concentration that could follow the improvement of both gastrointestinal and extraintestinal symptoms. We hypothesized that PTX3 is able to modulate the innate response to gliadin in CD and it could regulate the adaptive immune response. It is also evidenced that a common "wooden horse" of CD and Non Celiac Gluten Sensitivity (NCGS) is the ingestion of gluten and related toxic peptides. At the moment we don't have adequate elements to suggest the use of PTX3 in diagnosis of NCGS, but we are obliged to speculate about the possible role of PTX3 molecules in NCGS pathogenesis. The identified new strategies and uses of PTX3 could improve the management of gluten sensitivity conditions in the next future.},

The aim of this study was to examine the frequency of diagnosis of celiac disease among children with unexplained rickets in Saudi children at a tertiary hospital setting. DESIGN AND SETTING: Retrospective review of records of patients referred over 10 years to a pediatric gastroenterology and hepatology unit. PATIENTS AND METHODS: The study included all patients referred for evaluation of unexplained rickets and osteomalacia and screened for celiac disease. The diagnosis of rickets was made on the basis of history, physical examination, biochemical and radiological investigations. The diagnosis of celiac disease was made based on the ESPGHAN (European Society for Pediatric Gastroenterology, Hepatology, and Nutrition) criteria. RESULTS: Twenty-six children with a mean (SD) age of 9.5 (4.6) years (5 males, range 1-15 years) were referred for evaluation of unexplained rickets and were screened for celiac disease. The diagnosis of celiac disease based on small bowel biopsy findings was confirmed in 10 (38.4%) patients with rickets. Serological markers for celiac disease including antiendomyseal antibodies and antitissue transglutaminase antibodies were positive in all ten children. CONCLUSION: Rickets is not an uncommon presentation of celiac disease in Saudi children and pediatricians should consider celiac disease as an underlying cause for rickets.},

In this short report we demonstrate a period prevalence of CD in the T1DM population of 5.8% at a large tertiary centre. In addition to this, using a questionnaire circulated to paediatricians, we assessed present practice in the diagnosis of CD in T1DM 16 months following the European Society for Gastroenterology, Hepatology, and Nutrition guideline publication. Our results indicate that present practice and adherence to guidelines varies substantially. Further dissemination and perhaps simplification of guidelines may be required.},

   abstract = {BACKGROUND AND AIMS: Advanced glycation end (AGE) products play a role in the progression of diabetic complications. Gluten-free diet (GFD) might affect AGE levels in patients who adhere to a GFD because of coeliac disease (CD). The aim of our study was to compare skin AGE levels and soluble receptor AGE levels (sRAGE) in patients with type 1 diabetes (T1DM) with (T1DM + CD) and without CD (T1DM - CD) and healthy controls. METHODS AND RESULTS: We recruited 25 T1DM + CD and 25 T1DM - CD patients, matched for age, gender, diabetes duration, and glycaemic control alongside 25 healthy controls. We collected demographic, clinical and biochemical characteristics, including skin autofluorescence (AF), sRAGE and hs-CRP levels. The duration of T1DM in patients was 30 +/- 14 (+CD) and 29 +/- 14 years (-CD), whereas CD duration in T1DM + CD patients was 14 +/- 10 years. Skin AF levels in T1DM patients were higher compared to healthy controls (2.5 +/- 0.6 versus 1.9 +/- 0.4, p < 0.01) and skin AF was independently associated with age (r = 0.72, p < 0.01). sRAGE levels were higher in T1DM - CD patients compared to healthy controls (1554 +/- 449 versus 1309 +/- 400, p = 0.049) and independently associated with creatinine levels (r = 0.32, p < 0.01). CONCLUSION: Our study demonstrates that skin AGE and sRAGE levels are elevated in T1DM patients compared with healthy controls. No difference in skin AF or sRAGE levels between T1DM patients with or without CD were observed. The present study suggests that differences in microvascular complications between T1DM and T1DM + CD patients are not due to differences in skin AF or sRAGE levels.},

   abstract = {Gustatory and visceral stimulation from food regulates digestion and nutrient use. Free L-glutamate (Glu) release from digested protein is responsible for umami taste perception in the gut. Moreover, monosodium Glu (MSG) is widely used as a flavor enhancer to add umami taste in various cuisines. Recent studies indicate that dietary Glu sensors and their signal transduction system exist in both gut mucosa and taste cells. Oral Glu sensing has been well studied. In this review, we focus on the role of Glu on digestion and absorption of food. Infusion of Glu into the stomach and intestine increase afferent nerve activity of the gastric and the celiac branches of the vagus nerve, respectively. Luminal Glu also evokes efferent nerve activation of the abdominal vagus nerve branches simultaneously. Additionally, intragastric infusion of Glu activates the insular cortex, limbic system, hypothalamus, nucleus tractus solitaries, and amygdala, as determined by functional magnetic resonance imaging, and is able to induce flavor-preference learning as a result of postingestive effects in rats. These results indicate that Glu signaling via gustatory and visceral pathways plays an important role in the processes of digestion, absorption, metabolism, and other physiological functions via activation of the brain.},

   abstract = {OBJECTIVES: Assessment of treatment response in children with celiac disease (CD) after commencing a strict gluten-free diet (GFD) is generally based on the resolution of clinical features and normalization of serology. Recent adult studies have shown that serologic markers do not correlate with mucosal recovery. We aimed (i) to determine whether anti-tissue transglutaminase immunoglobulin (Ig)A (tTG) and anti-deamidated gliadin peptide IgG (DGP) antibodies are sensitive and specific markers of mucosal recovery in children with CD on a GFD for at least 12 months, and (ii) to determine whether a validated dietary questionnaire of compliance can identify patients with mucosal recovery. METHODS: A total of 150 children with biopsy-proven CD were prospectively evaluated with duodenal biopsies at >/=12 months on GFD, paired with repeat tTG and DGP serology. The biopsies were reviewed in a blinded manner by two histopathologists and graded by Marsh criteria. A validated questionnaire of dietary compliance was also administered. RESULTS: Of 150 children recruited, 27 (18%) had positive serology, 97 (65%) had negative serology, and 26 (17%) had equivocal serology. Of the 97 children with negative serology, none had Marsh type 3 enteropathy. Of the 27 patients with positive serology, only 6 had Marsh type 3 changes. The sensitivity and specificity of serology as a marker of significant mucosal pathology was 75 and 85%, respectively, with a positive predictive value of 22% but a negative predictive value of 98%. Of the 129 (86%) questionnaires completed, 88% reported good or excellent compliance with a GFD (negative predictive value 97%). CONCLUSIONS: This study suggests that follow-up using two serological tests in children with CD on a GFD may obviate the need for repeat mucosal biopsy in the majority of patients. A standardized dietary questionnaire may be useful in identifying patients who require further evaluation.},

   abstract = {Celiac disease is a complex immune-mediated disorder that is triggered by ingestion of gluten and related proteins in genetically susceptible individuals. Under conditions of increased intestinal permeability, gluten-derived peptides can travel across the intestinal epithelium and undergo deamidation catalyzed by the tissue transglutaminase (TTG) enzyme. This renders them immunogenic in individuals expressing specific human leukocyte antigen (HLA) DQ heterodimers. The resulting immune response is characterized by the production of antibodies against both deamidated gliadin peptides (DGP) and TTG, generation of pro-inflammatory cytokines and activation of cytotoxic T cells. This response damages the intestinal epithelium resulting in the wide range of gastrointestinal and systemic symptoms observed in those with celiac disease. Celiac disease diagnosis has traditionally been based on biopsy and histological examination of the small intestine. While this approach is still considered the gold standard, it is invasive and susceptible to both false-positive and false-negative results. Several laboratory tests have become available to aid in the diagnosis and monitoring of celiac disease, and are the focus of this review. These include serological tests for celiac disease-specific antibodies such as anti-endomysial antibodies, anti-TTG antibodies and anti-DGP antibodies of both the immunoglobulin A (IgA) and immunoglobulin G (IgG) class, genetic tests to elucidate HLA DQ status and ancillary tests such as total IgA. While some have suggested that laboratory tests may replace intestinal biopsy in specific circumstances, others maintain that this procedure remains a critical component of celiac disease diagnosis. We review the analytical methodology, strengths, weaknesses, diagnostic performance and clinical utility of the various laboratory tests for celiac disease. Potential future markers and tests that are now considered obsolete are also discussed. Current clinical practice guidelines for the diagnosis and management of celiac disease from the European Society for Pediatric Gastroenterology, Hepatology and Nutrition, the American College of Gastroenterology and the World Gastroenterology Organisation are summarized, and important differences between these guidelines are highlighted.},

We tested the hypothesis that this T cell reactivity could be abolished by using prolyl-endopeptidase (PEP), an enzyme that cleaves peptide bonds after proline. Peripheral blood mononuclear cells (PBMCs) were isolated from T1D patients and healthy controls. PBMCs were stimulated with a peptic-tryptic digest of wheat gluten; a peptic-tryptic-PEP digest of wheat gluten; and a 13 amino acid peptide from wheat gluten. Fluorescent-labelled antibodies to CD3, CD4 and CD8 cell marker proteins were utilized to determine proliferative responses of CD3, CD4 and CD8 T cells. There were no significant differences in proliferative responses of CD3 or CD4 T cells to the wheat gluten antigens. A significantly higher proportion of CD8(+) T cells from T1D patients proliferated in the presence of the 13 amino acid peptide than when challenged with the peptic-tryptic or the peptic-tryptic-PEP digests of wheat gluten. PEP treatment had no significant effect on CD8 T cell reactivity to the peptic-trytic digest of wheat gluten. Our results suggest that wheat gluten-derived peptides, containing </= 13 amino acids, may evoke T cell responses in T1D patients.},

   abstract = {BACKGROUND: Follow-up of celiac disease (CD) patients is recommended for gluten-free diet (GFD) adherence monitoring and complication detection. We recently showed that 35% of children with CD were lost to follow-up (LTFU). We aimed to characterize LTFU population, and thus identify compliance barriers to GFD and follow-up. METHODS: 50 LTFU patients were investigated using a telephone questionnaire, regarding frequency of follow-up, serology testing, and adherence to GFD (using the validated Biagi score). Fifty two regular follow-up patients served as controls. RESULTS: LTFU patients had poor adherence to GFD (average Biagi score of 2.0 +/- 1.4) compared to controls (3.0 +/- 1.0, p < 0.001). Only 22% of LTFU performed periodic celiac serology testing compared to 82% of controls (p < 0.001). LTFU had higher prevalence of positive celiac serology tests (50% compared to 25% of controls, p = 0.01). Fewer LTFU were National Celiac Association members (24%) compared with controls (44%, p = 0.05). Regression analysis showed positive relationships between LTFU and poor adherence to GFD (R(2) = 0.26737, p = 0.001), older age at diagnosis (R(2) = 0.30046, p = 0.03), and non-membership in a celiac association (R(2) = 0.18591, p = 0.0001). CONCLUSION: LTFU is associated with non-adherence to GFD and positive serology. Risk factors for LFTU should be identified and addressed in order to improve patient care.},

   abstract = {INTRODUCTION: In Australia, faecal incontinence, the involuntary loss of liquid or solid stool with or without a person's awareness, has been reported in 8% of the South Australian and 11% of the urban New South Wales community-dwelling populations. Studies conducted in 2004 and 2005 reported faecal incontinence in more than 20% of colorectal and urogynaecological clinic patients at Townsville Hospital (a referral centre serving rural North Queensland). This prompted concern regarding the level of faecal incontinence in the community. The aim of this study was to investigate the prevalence of faecal incontinence in the North and Far North Queensland urban and rural communities. METHODS: The sample size was based on the New South Wales postal surveys (11% prevalence). Higher rates were expected in North/Far North Queensland, so prevalence there was estimated at 12.1% (confidence interval +/- 2%, ie the true level to be between 10.1% and 14.1%). The sample for each of the Townsville, Cairns (in Far North Queensland) and rural/remote settings was calculated at 1022. The database for the present study was compiled using a systematic randomised process selecting two private names from each column on each page of the Cairns and Townsville White Pages(R) (Cairns: 1112 urban, 481 rural, 226 remote; Townsville: 1049 urban, 432 rural, 320 remote). The questionnaire covered personal demographics, health/risk factors, bowel habits, nutrition (fibre and fluid intake) and physical activity. Faecal incontinence was defined as accidental leakage of solid or liquid stool in the past 12 months that was not caused by a virus, medication or contaminated food. To improve the response rate a participation incentive of a chance to win a $250 voucher or one of ten $50 vouchers was offered in the initial mail-out. The initial survey was mailed out in July 2007; two follow-up surveys were mailed out to non-responders in September 2007 and January 2008. One hundred randomly selected non-responders were telephoned in February 2008. RESULTS: A total of 1523 responses provided a 48.1% response rate. Faecal incontinence prevalence was 12.7% (174/1366) with no gender or locality differences. Prevalence increased significantly with age in men (p=0.034), but not in women. Only 10 respondents with faecal incontinence consulted their doctor in the previous year for this reason. Incontinent respondents had significantly more medical conditions including urinary incontinence, coeliac disease, irritable bowel syndrome, injury to the anus, bowel cancer, spinal cord disease, neurological disease and psychiatric problems (all, p< 0.05). Stool-related accidental bowel leakage including faecal incontinence (defined), soiling with flatus or urgency, was 18.2%. An additional 3% were possibly incontinent, having disclosed leakage of mucus, bothersome or passive staining. Of the remaining respondents, 16.2% reported incontinent episodes due to an acute illness, 22.9% could not always differentiate between flatus and stool, and only 35.2% reported neither concerns with nor accidental bowel leakage. CONCLUSIONS: There is a high level of untreated faecal incontinence in North/Far North Queensland communities. Demand for treatment will increase because of the ageing population and the expectations of younger, more assertive cohorts.},

   abstract = {The main objective of the study was to prospectively assess if the prevalence of celiac disease (CD) in patients with anorexia nervosa (AN) is higher than that reported in the general population to require a regular screening program. The study was conducted at the Neuropsychiatry Unit of "Bambino Gesu" Children's Hospital in Rome from January 2005 to December 2010. All patients with diagnosis of AN according to the Diagnostic and Statistical Manual of Mental Disorders 4th edition criteria were screened for CD. One hundred and seventy-seven patients (33 males and 144 females) were enrolled. Only one patient was found to be affected with CD as confirmed by intestinal biopsy. The overall prevalence of CD in AN patients was 0.6 % which is similar to that observed in the general population. In conclusion, AN patients do not seem to require a regular screening program for CD. The screening for CD may be useful in selected AN patients in which the symptoms are only partially responding to psychiatric interventions.},

   abstract = {Cookies were prepared by replacing a mixture of brown rice flour (70%) and corn starch (30%) (BRFCS) by buriti endocarp flour (BEF) (0, 5, 10, 15 or 20%). BEF figured as a potential source of dietary fiber (70.53 g 100 g(-1)), especially of insoluble fiber (67.50 g 100 g(-1)), and gluten-free whole cookies showed increased dietary fiber content by adding 5, 10, 15 and 20% BEF (8.58 to 20.02 g 100 g(-1)) when compared to control cookie (6.91 g 100 g(-1)). The addition of BEF affected diameter, spread ratio, color and texture of cookies. All cookies added with BEF were darker, harder and presented smaller diameter and smaller spread ratio than the control cookie. These difference increased proportionally to level of substitution of BRFSC by BEF. Gluten-free whole cookies with up to 15% BEF were well accepted by consumers. Therefore, the use of BEF in cookies may increase the availability of functional ingredients source of dietary fiber for celiac consumers, add economic value to buriti processing by-products and decrease environmental impacts due to the high amounts of waste generated by buriti processing industries.},

RECENT FINDINGS: This review first identifies diseases with which eating disorders are often confused and then explores features in the history, physical examination, and laboratory studies, which can provide clues to the cause of the patient's symptoms. In addition, it discusses the recommended evaluation and treatments for the gastrointestinal diseases that most commonly mimic the presentation of eating disorders including Crohn disease (CrD), celiac disease, gastroesophageal reflux disease (GERD), and eosinophilic esophagitis (EoE). SUMMARY: The ubiquitous nature of the gastrointestinal complaints requires the clinician to consider a broad differential diagnosis when evaluating a patient for an eating disorder.},

Endosonographers are looking at various techniques to improve yield of fine needle aspiration and core biopsies, assess circulating tumor cells, apply EUS for personalized medicine and develop devices to ensure the adequacy of sampling. EUS may open new vistas in understanding of neurogastroenterology and gastrointestinal motility disorders as discussed in this paper. EUS guided drainage of pancreatic fluid collections, bile duct and gallbladder is feasible, and many randomized trials are being done to compare different techniques. EUS guided delivery of fiducials, drugs, coils or chemo loaded beads in possible. EUS has come off age, has matured and is here to stay! The DDW in 2014 in Chicago was a very active year for EUS. There were numerous papers on different aspects of EUS, some perfecting and improving old techniques, others dealing with randomized trials and many with novel concepts. In this paper, I will highlight some of the papers that were presented. It is not possible to discuss all the abstracts in detail. I have, therefore, chosen selected papers in different aspects of EUS to give the readers a flavor of the kind of research that was presented at DDW.},

Gluten avoidance, which is the only available treatment for CD, could impact on quality of life of children with CD. We present the results of a qualitative study on the emotional impact of gluten free diet (GFD) on the everyday life of children affected with CD. We investigated 76 celiac patients aged 2-18 years (average age: 9.5 years). By using the Critical Incident Technique (CIT), we defined emotions related to difficulties and awkward situations experienced by the patients. Written answers to open-ended questions from either children (older than 8 years) and parents (children younger than 8 years) were analyzed qualitatively. We found 80 dilemmas experienced in three different arenas (food situations at school, meals at home, meals outside) and characterized lived experiences of children with CD in everyday life (specific emotions, difficulties in relationships and in management of daily life). Children with CD experience strong emotions related to the GFD, permeating several aspects of everyday life. These dilemmas may be missed by a conventional, questionnaire-based approach to the psycho-social consequences of CD treatment.},

   abstract = {BACKGROUND: The serological diagnosis of celiac disease (CD) often relies on the presence of anti-tissue transglutaminase (tTG) IgA autoantibodies. Patients suffering from selective IgA deficiency (IgAD) are often not aware of their IgA deficiency and are tested as CD negative, delaying considerably the diagnosis. The detection of IgG against deamidated gliadin peptides (DGP) has high specificity and better sensitivity than IgG anti-tTG. A multi-analytic lateral-flow immunochromatographic assay (CD-LFIA) based on the detection of IgA and IgG anti-DGP and total IgA was shown to have a good diagnostic accuracy for CD. The aim of this study was to evaluate the clinical accuracy of its use in children suffering from IgAD. METHODS: 45 IgAD children ranging from 1.1 to 17.4 years and suspected of CD or having high CD risk factors were referred from outpatient clinics located in the area of Rhone-Alpes (France) to the Hospices Civils de Lyon, Paediatric Hospital-Gastroenterology-Hepatology- Nutrition Department for further CD investigations. The CD investigations, including the sample collection, were performed within the Paediatric Hospital-Gastroenterology-Hepatology- Nutrition Department, and the serological testing was performed at the Lyon-Sud Hospital-Immunology Laboratory. The diagnosis of CD was based on IgG anti-tTG serology, biopsy results and patient follow-up. The serum samples were retrospectively tested on the CD-LFIA test. RESULTS: A total of eight (8) patients were diagnosed as new CD. All were correctly identified by the CD-LFIA. The test yielded four (4) false positive results. Two patients with positive IgG anti-tTG were negative on CD-LFIA, but were classified as CD negative based on biopsy results and patient follow-up. The remaining 33 patients were found negative by both methods. The specificity and sensitivity of CD-LFIA was of 89.2% [74.6-97.0] and of 100% [63.1-100] respectively. The negative predictive value (NPV) was of 100% [89.4-100], and the Likelihood Ratio for Negative Test (LR-) was of 0 [0.0-0.91]. CONCLUSIONS: CD-LFIA is a useful, non-invasive and rapid tool to rule out CD in primary care paediatric patients having CD-related symptoms and IgAD. Patients having a positive CD-LFIA result could be then readily directed to secondary care setting for further evaluation by standard serology and biopsy.},

   abstract = {Background: Nonceliac gluten sensitivity (NCGS), occurring in patients without celiac disease yet whose gastrointestinal symptoms improve on a gluten-free diet (GFD), is largely a self-reported diagnosis and would appear to be very common. The aims of this study were to characterize patients who believe they have NCGS. Materials and Methods: Advertising was directed toward adults who believed they had NCGS and were willing to participate in a clinical trial. Respondents were asked to complete a questionnaire about symptoms, diet, and celiac investigation. Results: Of 248 respondents, 147 completed the survey. Mean age was 43.5 years, and 130 were women. Seventy-two percent did not meet the description of NCGS due to inadequate exclusion of celiac disease (62%), uncontrolled symptoms despite gluten restriction (24%), and not following a GFD (27%), alone or in combination. The GFD was self-initiated in 44% of respondents; in other respondents it was prescribed by alternative health professionals (21%), dietitians (19%), and general practitioners (16%). No celiac investigations had been performed in 15% of respondents. Of 75 respondents who had duodenal biopsies, 29% had no or inadequate gluten intake at the time of endoscopy. Inadequate celiac investigation was common if the GFD was initiated by self (69%), alternative health professionals (70%), general practitioners (46%), or dietitians (43%). In 40 respondents who fulfilled the criteria for NCGS, their knowledge of and adherence to the GFD were excellent, and 65% identified other food intolerances. Conclusions: Just over 1 in 4 respondents self-reporting as NCGS fulfill criteria for its diagnosis. Initiation of a GFD without adequate exclusion of celiac disease is common. In 1 of 4 respondents, symptoms are poorly controlled despite gluten avoidance.},

   abstract = {Data are accumulating that emphasize the important role of the intestinal barrier and intestinal permeability for health and disease. However, these terms are poorly defined, their assessment is a matter of debate, and their clinical significance is not clearly established. In the present review, current knowledge on mucosal barrier and its role in disease prevention and therapy is summarized. First, the relevant terms 'intestinal barrier' and 'intestinal permeability' are defined. Secondly, the key element of the intestinal barrier affecting permeability are described. This barrier represents a huge mucosal surface, where billions of bacteria face the largest immune system of our body. On the one hand, an intact intestinal barrier protects the human organism against invasion of microorganisms and toxins, on the other hand, this barrier must be open to absorb essential fluids and nutrients. Such opposing goals are achieved by a complex anatomical and functional structure the intestinal barrier consists of, the functional status of which is described by 'intestinal permeability'. Third, the regulation of intestinal permeability by diet and bacteria is depicted. In particular, potential barrier disruptors such as hypoperfusion of the gut, infections and toxins, but also selected over-dosed nutrients, drugs, and other lifestyle factors have to be considered. In the fourth part, the means to assess intestinal permeability are presented and critically discussed. The means vary enormously and probably assess different functional components of the barrier. The barrier assessments are further hindered by the natural variability of this functional entity depending on species and genes as well as on diet and other environmental factors. In the final part, we discuss selected diseases associated with increased intestinal permeability such as critically illness, inflammatory bowel diseases, celiac disease, food allergy, irritable bowel syndrome, and--more recently recognized--obesity and metabolic diseases. All these diseases are characterized by inflammation that might be triggered by the translocation of luminal components into the host. In summary, intestinal permeability, which is a feature of intestinal barrier function, is increasingly recognized as being of relevance for health and disease, and therefore, this topic warrants more attention.},

   abstract = {BACKGROUND AND AIM: Studies of adults and children with celiac disease (CD) performed mostly in tertiary care centers have reported an increased risk of overweight during gluten-free diet (GFD). We measured body mass index (BMI) of CD children followed by family pediatricians in order to estimate prevalence of underweight and overweight at diagnosis and to describe BMI changes during GFD. METHODS AND RESULTS: We compared 150 CD children (age range 2-16 yrs) under GFD from a median (IQR) time of 4.4 (4.2) years with 288 healthy children matched for gender and age. We also evaluated retrospectively BMI changes between CD diagnosis and the current evaluation. The median (IQR) BMI of CD patients was significantly lower than that of controls [-0.38 (1.46) vs. 0.09 (1.18) SDS, p < 0.0001, Italian reference data]. Using the International Obesity Task Force classifications, CD children were less frequently overweight or obese (12% vs. 23.3%, p = 0.014) and more frequently underweight (16% vs. 4.5%, p < 0.001) than controls. During GFD, there was a marked decrease of number of underweight subjects (13 vs. 27) and a minimal increase of number of overweight subjects (9 vs. 6) (p < 0.001). CONCLUSIONS: The frequency of overweight and obesity at diagnosis of CD and during GFD in children followed by family pediatricians is substantially lower than that reported in tertiary care centers. On the other hand, the high frequency of underweight at diagnosis confirms the need of careful personalized nutritional management.},

   abstract = {The aim of this review was to identify, evaluate and summarize all relevant studies reporting on the clinical response to gluten challenge by adult or pediatric patients with suspected or diagnosed coeliac disease (CD) on a gluten-free diet. We evaluated the effect of gluten challenge on changes in symptoms, intestinal mucosa histology, and serum antibodies. A systematic electronic search was performed for studies published as of 1966 using PubMed and Scopus databases. In the reviewed studies, doses ranged from 0.2 to 30 g/day of wheat gluten or comprised a gluten-containing diet. The onset of symptoms upon gluten intake varied largely from days to months and did not parallel serum antibody or histological changes. Within 3 months of gluten challenge, 70%-100% of pediatric CD patients became positive for AGA-IgA and EMA-IgA antibodies and 50%-70% for AGA-IgG. A limited number of trials suggest that no more than half of adult patients developed positive AGA-IgA, EMA-IgA, tTG-IgA or DGP-IgA/IgG titers. Approximately 50%-100% of pediatric and adult patients experienced mucosal relapse of gluten provocation within 3 months, which was preceded by increased mucosal intra-epithelial lymphocytes within several days of challenge. A 3-month high-dose gluten challenge should be suitable to diagnose the majority of CD patients. In some cases prolonged challenge may be needed to verify diagnosis. Combination testing for antibodies and mucosal histology may fasten the diagnosis.},

The etiology remains unclear and the diagnosis is based upon patient s clinical picture and anatomopathological findings. Clinically, collagenous sprue is characterized by persistent diarrhoea, severe malabsorption, multiple nutrient deficiencies and progressive weight loss. Differential diagnosis includes celiac disease, which is mandatory to rule out because of their frequent association. Glutenfree diet is the first therapeutic step, but it usually is not effective. However, recent studies show high success rates with immunomodulators, mainly corticosteroids. We report the case of a patient presenting with chronic diarrhea and severe malabsorption who was diagnosed with collagenous sprue, with no response to gluten free diet, but with excellent response to budesonida.},

   abstract = {AIM: The aim was to determine the prevalence and clinical and temporal relationship of celiac disease (CD) in a population of Swedish children with type 1 diabetes mellitus (T1DM) before, during, and after the Swedish epidemic of CD (birth cohorts 1984-1996). METHODS: Retrospective chart review between 1995 and 2005 was conducted of 1151 children (0-18 years old, born 1981-2004) with T1DM. RESULTS: A prevalence of 9.1% (95% CI: 7.2-11.2) of CD in T1DM children was found. No significant difference in prevalence of CD was observed in different birth years, in contrast to the Swedish epidemic of CD. Sixty-two percent of children diagnosed with CD after T1DM onset had pathological levels of antibodies within the first 24 months. The presence or absence of gastrointestinal symptoms had no predictable value for biopsy-confirmed CD or not. CONCLUSION: The onset of CD in the T1DM population does not follow the pattern of the general population during the Swedish epidemic of CD. The shared genetic component in the human leukocyte antigen region in cases with comorbidity of CD and T1DM may overrule other CD-causing factors in the general population. Children with T1DM should be screened for CD at diagnosis and repeatedly at least during the first 2 years, even if asymptomatic.},

The induction of Treg activity by probiotics might be effective for promoting tolerance towards food allergens. Nasal cytology is useful in patients with rhinitis for diagnosing chronic non-allergic non-infectious diseases. Atopic eczema is associated both with an aberrant skin matrix and impaired systemic immune response. Therefore, isolated topical treatment may have suboptimal effect. Diagnostic work-up of exercise-induced anaphylaxis, including exercise challenge test, is necessary to reach a diagnosis. Studies may support a role for nutrition on prevention of asthma and cardiovascular diseases. Clinicians need to early identify adolescent menstrual abnormalities to minimize sequelae, and to promote health information. In Multiple Endocrine Neoplasia type 2B investigations include acetylcholinesterase study of rectal mucosa followed by the molecular analysis of RET mutation. Low adherence to gluten-free diet and osteopenia are common problems in children with diabetes mellitus type 1 and celiac disease. In infantile colic, laboratory tests are usually unnecessary and the treatment is based on reassurance. Prevalence of obesity and stunting is elucidated by several studies. Evidences are growing that dietetic measures are needed to prevent obesity in children with acute leukemia. Treatment studies for infectious diseases show promise for probiotics along with standard triple therapy in children with Helicobacter pilori infection, while zinc has no effect on pneumonia. Educational programs about the proper management of the febrile child are warranted. A new hour-specific total serum bilirubin nomogram has been shown to be able to predict newborns without hyperbilirubinemia after 48 to 72 hours of life. Newborns with hypoxic-ischemic encephalopathy present ECG and cardiac enzymes alterations leading to reduced neonatal survival. Rehabilitation programs including sensory integration therapy and motor performance, may improve activities of daily life in children with developmental coordination disorder. Aerobic exercise training in addition to chest physiotherapy might be useful in children with cystic fibrosis. Studies on effectiveness of leukotriene receptor antagonists, alone or with other drugs in preschool wheezing are needed.},

Recommendations for interpretation of skin prick test to foods in atopic eczema, management of allergic conjunctivitis, hypertension and breastfeeding in women treated with antiepileptic drugs and healthy breakfast have been reported. Epidemiological studies have given emphasis to high incidence of autoimmune disorders in patients with Turner syndrome, increasing prevalence of celiac disease, frequency of hypertension in adolescents, incidence and risk factor for retinopathy of prematurity. Advances in prevention include elucidation of the role of probiotics in reducing occurrence of allergies and feeding intolerance, and events of foetal life that influence later onset of diseases. Mechanistic studies suggested a role for vitamin D deficiency in asthma and type 1 diabetes and for reactivation of Varicella-Zoster virus in aseptic meningitis. Regarding diagnosis, a new mean for the diagnosis of hyperbilirubinaemia in newborns, a score for recognition of impaired nutritional status and growth and criteria for early Dyke-Davidoff-Masson Syndrome have been suggested. New therapeutic approaches consist of use of etanercept for reducing insulin dose in type 1 diabetes, probiotics in atopic eczema, and melatonin in viral infections.},

The sensitivity, specificity, positive (PPV) and negative predictive value (NPV), positive (PLR) and negative likelihood ratio (NLR) and accuracy of the test combining genotyping and tTG-IgA positivity and the simple scoring system for the diagnosis of CD were evaluated. The combination of genotyping and strong tTG-IgA positivity had a sensitivity of 93.5%, specificity of 61.5%, PPV of 93.5%, NPV of 61.5%, PLR of 2.4, NLR of 0.1 and accuracy of 89% for "CD." SSS had a higher specificity (84.6%), higher PPV (97.3%), higher NPV (68.7%), higher PLR and higher accuracy (92.3%). The combination of genotyping and strong tTG-IgA positivity missed two patients with typical CD (4%) and three patients with atypical CD (10.7%). Two cases with malabsorptive symptoms (33.3%) and three patients without malabsorptive symptoms (42.8%) would have been misdiagnosed as CD if these tests were used. Intestinal biopsy is still mandatory for diagnosis of CD in Turkish children.},

   abstract = {Gluten, a common component in the human diet, is capable of triggering coeliac disease pathogenesis in genetically predisposed individuals. Although the function of human digestive proteases in gluten proteins is quite well known, the role of intestinal microbiota in the metabolism of proteins is frequently underestimated. The aim of this study was the isolation and characterisation of the human gut bacteria involved in the metabolism of gluten proteins. Twenty-two human faecal samples were cultured with gluten as the principal nitrogen source, and 144 strains belonging to 35 bacterial species that may be involved in gluten metabolism in the human gut were isolated. Interestingly, 94 strains were able to metabolise gluten, 61 strains showed an extracellular proteolytic activity against gluten proteins, and several strains showed a peptidasic activity towards the 33-mer peptide, an immunogenic peptide in patients with coeliac disease. Most of the strains were classified within the phyla Firmicutes and Actinobacteria, mainly from the genera Lactobacillus, Streptococcus, Staphylococcus, Clostridium and Bifidobacterium. In conclusion, the human intestine exhibits a large variety of bacteria capable of utilising gluten proteins and peptides as nutrients. These bacteria could have an important role in gluten metabolism and could offer promising new treatment modalities for coeliac disease.},

Four patients had splenomegaly, 3 had esophageal varices, one had hepatopulmonary syndrome and had been transplanted. Smooth muscle antibody was found positive in 4 patients, without autoimmune hepatitis findings in liver biopsy. One patient had celiac disease and another patient had positive celiac disease serology but pathology findings. Another patient had Turner's syndrome. Mean follow-up time was 39 months (3.3 yr) after biopsy. Hepatoportal sclerosis does not necessarily present with portal hypertension in children.},

To satisfy the increasing demand for healthier products, this research focused on the effects of the supplementation of Psyllium (P) and sugar beet fibre (SB) on the mixing and leavening behaviour of gluten-free doughs. Four doughs, having different consistencies that made them suitable to be poured into moulds or to be shaped, and their corresponding breads were evaluated. The results obtained suggested that a lower consistency is preferred to assure good dough performances during leavening, in particular when ingredients having a high water affinity are included into the recipe. Both P and SB improved the workability of the doughs, but P played a central role on GF bread development, thanks to its film forming ability, and evidenced a more effective antistaling effect, thanks to its high water binding capacity.},

   abstract = {Reduced levels of iron, folate, vitamin B12, vitamin D, zinc, and magnesium are common in untreated celiac disease (CD) patients probably due to loss of brush border proteins and enzymes needed for the absorption of these nutrients. In the majority of patients, removal of gluten from the diet leads to histological recovery and normalization of iron, vitamin, and mineral levels. Iron deficiency anemia is the most common extra-intestinal sign of CD and usually resolves with adherence to a gluten-free diet. However, deficiencies of both folate and vitamin B12 may persist in some patients on a gluten-free diet, thus requiring vitamin supplementation to improve subjective health status. Similarly, exclusion of gluten from the diet does not always normalize bone mineral density; in these cases, supplementation of vitamin D and calcium is recommended. Resolution of mucosal inflammation may not be sufficient to abrogate magnesium deficiency. Since gluten-free cereal products have a lower magnesium content as compared with gluten-containing counterparts, a magnesium-enriched diet should be encouraged in CD patients. In this article we discuss the frequency and clinical relevance of nutrient deficiency in CD and whether and when nutrient supplementation is needed.},

   abstract = {Non Celiac Gluten sensitivity (NCGS) was originally described in the 1980s and recently a "re-discovered" disorder characterized by intestinal and extra-intestinal symptoms related to the ingestion of gluten-containing food, in subjects that are not affected with either celiac disease (CD) or wheat allergy (WA). Although NCGS frequency is still unclear, epidemiological data have been generated that can help establishing the magnitude of the problem. Clinical studies further defined the identity of NCGS and its implications in human disease. An overlap between the irritable bowel syndrome (IBS) and NCGS has been detected, requiring even more stringent diagnostic criteria. Several studies suggested a relationship between NCGS and neuropsychiatric disorders, particularly autism and schizophrenia. The first case reports of NCGS in children have been described. Lack of biomarkers is still a major limitation of clinical studies, making it difficult to differentiate NCGS from other gluten related disorders. Recent studies raised the possibility that, beside gluten, wheat amylase-trypsin inhibitors and low-fermentable, poorly-absorbed, short-chain carbohydrates can contribute to symptoms (at least those related to IBS) experienced by NCGS patients. In this paper we report the major advances and current trends on NCGS.},

The increase in prevalence can be partially attributed to the improvement in diagnostic techniques and disease awareness; however the equally well documented rise in incidence in the last 30-40 years cannot be so easily explained. The new epidemiology of CD is now characterized by an increase of new cases in the historical CD areas (northern Europe and the United States) and more interestingly in a spread of the disease in new regions (Asian countries). A significant change in diet habits, particularly in gluten consumption as well as in infant feeding patterns are probably the main factors that can account for these new trends in CD epidemiology.},

   abstract = {BACKGROUND/OBJECTIVE: A strict and lifelong commitment to a gluten-free diet (GFD) remains one of the most challenging issues in children with coeliac disease. The present study aimed to record compliance rates and investigate the connection between dietary compliance and demographics, disease-related factors and parental knowledge. SUBJECTS/METHODS: Parents of 90 Greek children diagnosed with coeliac disease were recruited from the outpatient gastroenterology clinic of a children's hospital in Athens, Greece. Dietary compliance and a range of demographic and clinical data were obtained from parents through a specially constructed questionnaire. Further data included parental perceived and actual knowledge about coeliac disease and GFD. Compliant and noncompliant groups were compared for measured factors and a multivariate approach was followed to elicit independent effects of compliance determinants. RESULTS: Overall, 44.4% of children with coeliac disease were reported to be compliant to a strict GFD. A 1-year increase in the age of the child was associated with 15% lower odds of adhering to a strict diet after adjusting for other variables (odds ratio (OR)=0.85, 95% CI: 0.75-0.96). Parental perceived knowledge was also independently and significantly associated with dietary compliance (OR=3.3, 95% CI=1.1-9.8). No statistically significant correlation emerged between dietary compliance and other clinical or demographic variables. DISCUSSION: Low compliance rates to GFD were observed in children with coeliac disease. Information based on children's age and perceived parental knowledge can be used to develop risk profiles that health care professionals can utilise to identify children likely to be noncompliant and thus adjust their counselling strategy accordingly.},

   abstract = {Celiac disease (CD) is an immune-mediated disease of considerable incidence, which negatively influences the quality of life of affected individuals and their families. The only currently available treatment is a lifelong gluten-free diet. Possible prevention strategies for CD focus on early infant feeding practices, namely breastfeeding and the time and mode of gluten introduction into the infant's diet. A systematic review of available data suggested that the risk of developing CD may be decreased by breastfeeding and breastfeeding at the time of gluten introduction. It is not clear whether this strategy prevents the disease or only delays the onset of symptoms. Gluten introduction should not be done earlier than at 4 months of age and not later than 7 months of age since both early and late introduction of gluten have been shown to increase the risk of CD. A large randomized controlled trial is being conducted in 10 European countries to clarify whether breastfeeding and early gluten introduction are effective in preventing CD in genetically susceptible individuals.},

Recent epidemiological studies provide evidence that elective cesarean section (CS) is associated with aberrant short-term immune responses in the newborn infant, and a greater risk of developing immune diseases such as asthma, allergies, type 1 diabetes, and celiac disease. However, it is still unknown whether CS causes a long-term effect on the immune system of the offspring that contributes to compromised immune health. With the dramatic increase in the rate of CS today, a greater emphasis should be placed on the discussion among both professionals and childbearing women on potential consequences of CS on the health of the offspring.},

METHODS: Retrospective review of children with a primary complaint of chronic abdominal pain referred to a tertiary care children's hospital for pediatric gastroenterology evaluation over a 2-year period was conducted. Children with at least two visits and without an identified organic etiology for the pain were included. RESULTS: 160 children were evaluated by 16 pediatric gastroenterologists and one nurse practitioner. Celiac serologic testing was completed in 63 (39.4%) children. There was no significant variance in the frequency of celiac serologic testing between providers. Child age, gender, body mass index, and baseline gastrointestinal symptoms did not predict whether celiac serologic testing occurred, though Caucasians (P < 0.01) were more likely to be tested. Eighty-two (51.3%) children underwent either serologic testing and/or esophagogastroduodenoscopy. Four (4.9%, 95% CI: 1.6-11.3%) of the 82 tested were diagnosed with celiac disease. CONCLUSIONS: Though interprovider variation for celiac disease testing in children with chronic abdominal pain did not occur, a large number of these children were not evaluated for celiac disease. Children's race/ethnicity but not their associated gastrointestinal symptoms predicted whether celiac testing was undertaken. In those tested, celiac disease was identified in a higher percentage than that expected in the general population.},

Our aim was to examine the relationship of stressful events assessed by the standardized interview of Paykel with the diagnosis of celiac disease in comparison to patients, with a diagnosis of gastroesophageal reflux disease used as the control group. Adults with celiac disease (n = 186) reported more frequent and more severe life events in the years prior to the diagnosis than control patients (n = 96) (67.2% vs. 37.5%, p < 0.001, mean Paykel score 11.5 vs. 13.4, p = 0.001, respectively). Findings were not significantly different between celiac disease and control patients for the time lapse between the event and the diagnosis (mean 5.5 vs. 5.7 months). Pregnancy was defined as a negative event by 20.3% of celiac women, but never by control women. Findings were confirmed when analyses were repeated in the subgroup of patients of both groups with diagnosis made within one year of onset of symptoms. Data indicate that, before diagnosis, the number of stressful events in celiac disease was more frequent although less severe than in the control group suggesting that life events may favor the clinical appearance of celiac disease or accelerate its diagnosis.},

   abstract = {OBJECTIVES: The aim of this study was to assess the incidence and clinical pattern of celiac disease (CD) presently diagnosed in Spanish children. METHODS: A prospective, multicenter, nationwide registry of new cases of CD in children <15 years was conducted from June 1, 2006 to May 31, 2007. The parameters studied were age at diagnosis, sex, clinical symptoms, associated diseases, nutritional status, CD serology, histological lesions, and HLA-DQ2/-DQ8. The crude incidence rate of CD was calculated as new cases per 1000 live births and as new cases per 100,000 person-years <15 years of age. RESULTS: A total of 974 new cases of CD were included. The median age at diagnosis was 2.3 years; 39.5% of CD diagnoses occurred in the first 2 years, 42% between 2 and 6, and 18.4% from 6 to 15. Total number of cases in each age group was 385, 409, and 180, respectively. Regarding clinical presentation 70.9% showed classical symptoms, 21.9% were nonclassical, and 7% were asymptomatic. A total of 95.7% of 931, 94.7% of 611, and 86.7% of 651 children tested positive, respectively, for immunoglobulin A (IgA) anti-transglutaminase type 2 antibodies, IgA endomysial antibodies, and IgA anti-gliadin antibodies. Villous atrophy was observed in 92.4% and increased intraepithelial lymphocytes with crypt hyperplasia in 3.3%. Of the children, 55% had normal growth, and 3.4% were overweight. The HLA phenotype was DQ2: 88.3%, DQ2/DQ8: 8.4%, and DQ8: 2.3%. The incidence rate was 7.9 cases of CD per 1000 live births and 54 cases per 100,000 person-years. CONCLUSIONS: In Spain, the most frequent clinical presentation of CD is the classical form, mainly diagnosed during the first 2 years of life. The observed incidence of CD in Spanish children is much higher than the present CD incidence rates observed in other European countries.},

   abstract = {Osteoporosis, a metabolic skeletal disease characterised by decreased bone mass and increased fracture risk, is a growing public health problem. Among the various risk factors for osteoporosis, calcium and vitamin D have well-established protective roles, but it is likely that other nutritional factors are also implicated. This review will explore the emerging evidence supporting a role for certain B-vitamins, homocysteine and the 677 C --> T polymorphism in the gene encoding the folate-metabolising enzyme methylenetetrahydrofolate reductase, in bone health and disease. The evidence, however, is not entirely consistent and as yet no clear mechanism has been defined to explain the potential link between B-vitamins and bone health. Coeliac disease, a common condition of malabsorption, induced by gluten ingestion in genetically susceptible individuals, is associated with an increased risk both of osteoporosis and inadequate B-vitamin status. Given the growing body of evidence linking low bone mineral density and/or increased fracture risk with low B-vitamin status and elevated homocysteine, optimal B-vitamin status may play an important protective role against osteoporosis in coeliac disease; to date, no trial has addressed this possible link.},

   abstract = {A strict gluten-free diet (GFD) is the only currently available therapeutic treatment for patients with celiac disease, an autoimmune disorder of the small intestine associated with a permanent intolerance to gluten proteins. The complete elimination of gluten proteins contained in cereals from the diet is the key to celiac disease management. However, this generates numerous social and economic repercussions due to the ubiquity of gluten in foods. The research presented in this review focuses on the current status of alternative cereals and pseudocereals and their derivatives obtained by natural selection, breeding programs and transgenic or enzymatic technology, potential tolerated by celiac people. Finally, we describe several strategies for detoxification of dietary gluten. These included enzymatic cleavage of gliadin fragment by Prolyl endopeptidases (PEPs) from different organisms, degradation of toxic peptides by germinating cereal enzymes and transamidation of cereal flours. This information can be used to search for and develop cereals with the baking and nutritional qualities of toxic cereals, but which do not exacerbate this condition.},

Celiac disease is associated with an increased risk of autoimmune diseases (type 1 diabetes, thyroiditis), and cancer (upper digestive tract, hepatocellular carcinoma, lymphoma). The main digestive complications are microscopic colitis and refractory sprue, which are resistant to gluten-free diet. It can be associated with a monoclonal proliferation of intraepithelial lymphocytes (type 2 refractory sprue), which may be considered as a cryptic lymphoma and can lead to invasive T lymphoma, which occurs in one celiac patient in 1000. Gluten-free diet protects from the occurrence of most complications and correct the over-mortality related to these complications.},

In the last few years, however, several study results have been published that have proved that gluten intolerance can also affect people who do not suffer from any of the above mentioned diseases. The new syndrome has been named non-celiac gluten sensitivity (NCGS) or gluten sensitivity (GS). It has been included in the new list of gluten-related disorders published in 2012. Researchers believe that NCGS is the most common syndrome of gluten intolerance. This review discusses many aspects of NCGS epidemiology, pathophysiology, clinical spectrum, and treatment and current tools to identify patients suffering from CD, WA, and NCGS.},

The non-celiac gluten sensitivity (NCGS) is a less known syndrome whose prevalence is under-estimated. The last decades have seen changes in the clinical presentation of both diseases. One possible explanation is that changes in the gluten-rich cereals themselves were the principal causes. Celiac-triggering gluten proteins are indeed expressed to higher levels in modern cereals while non-triggering proteins are expressed less. Sophisticated hybridization techniques have been used to produce new strains of modern wheat, the most high-yielding of which have since made their way into human foods in the absence of animal or human safety testing. The dramatic changes in the clinical presentation of celiac disease and NCGS have taken place when new cereal hybrids were introduced into human foods. This is a critical medical and environmental issue which needs to be investigated by appropriate studies.},

To date, the only therapy for CD is the complete exclusion of dietary sources of grains and any food containing gluten. It has been hypothesized that the intestinal microbiota is somehow involved in CD. For this reason, probiotics are appearing as an interesting adjuvant in the dietetic management of CD. This review aims to discuss the characteristics of the microbiota in CD subjects and the use of probiotics as a novel therapy for CD. Comparisons between children with CD and controls show that their microbiota profiles differ; the former have fewer lactobacilli and bifidobacteria. Specific probiotics have been found to digest or alter gluten polypeptides. It has also been demonstrated that some bacterial species belonging to the genera Lactobacillus and Bifidobacterium exert protective properties on epithelial cells from damage caused by gliadin.},

   abstract = {OBJECTIVES: Clinical inference suggests the prevalence of non-celiac gluten sensitivity is substantially higher than that of celiac disease in the USA. Unfortunately, there are currently no data supporting these claims. The authors analyzed nationally representative data to estimate the prevalence of adherence to a gluten-free diet among participants without celiac disease and also to characterize the demographics and general health status of these participants. STUDY DESIGN AND SETTING: The Continuous National Health and Nutrition Examination Survey (NHANES) 2009-2010 enrolled 7762 individuals representing the civilian, non-institutionalized, US population free of celiac disease. Participants responded to interviewer administered questionnaires regarding current adherence to a gluten-free diet. Prevalence estimates were computed using SAS survey procedures. RESULTS: There were 49 individuals who reported current adherence to a gluten-free diet reflecting a weighted prevalence of 0.548% (95% CI 0.206-0.889). The prevalence of a gluten-free diet was higher in females (0.58%) than males (0.37%), although this was not statistically significant (p = 0.34). Participants reporting a gluten-free diet were older (46.6 vs. 40.5 years, p = 0.005), had higher high-density lipoprotein, lower iron and lower body mass index. CONCLUSIONS: The estimated national prevalence of non-celiac gluten sensitivity is 0.548%, approximately half that of celiac disease. Future studies are merited in order to better understand the population burden of non-celiac gluten sensitivity.},

A total of 324 products' labels were analyzed for content (162 from gluten-free products), and ingredient diversity in gluten-free products was 28% lower. Raw materials used as ingredients of gluten-free products were limited to five varieties: rice, cassava, corn, soy, and potato. Sugar was the most frequently mentioned ingredient on both types of products' labels. Salt and sodium also were among these ingredients. Presence of hydrocolloids, enzymes or raw materials of high nutritional content such as pseudocereals, suggested by academic studies as alternatives to improve nutritional and sensorial quality of gluten-free food products, was not identified in the present study. Nutritional quality of gluten-free diets and health of celiac patients may be compromised.},

A survey was used to collect information. Descriptive analysis, chi(2) tests and Multiple Logistic Regressions were conducted. Ninety-one questionnaires were analyzed. Limited variety and availability, the high price of products and the social restrictions imposed by the diet were the factors that caused the most dissatisfaction and difficulty. A total of 71% of the participants confirmed having moderate to high difficulty finding GF products. The logistic regression identified a significant relationship between dissatisfaction, texture and variety (p < 0.05) and between variety and difficulty of finding GF products (p < 0.05). The sensory characteristics were the most important variables considered for actual purchases. Bread was the most desired product. The participants were dissatisfaction with GF products. The desire for bread with better sensory characteristics reinforces the challenge to develop higher quality baking products.},

   abstract = {BACKGROUND: Currently , the only treatment for coeliac disease is life long adherence to a strict gluten-free diet. Strict adherence to a gluten-free diet is challenging, with recent reports suggesting that adherence rates range from 42% to 91%. The present study aimed to: (i) identify motives for adhering to a gluten-free diet and (ii) explore factors implicated in adherence and non-adherence behaviour in terms of accidental and purposeful gluten consumption among adults with coeliac disease. METHODS: Two hundred and three adults with coeliac disease completed an online questionnaire. Using a qualitative design, relationships were examined between reported adherence and motivation to follow a gluten-free diet, as well as the onset, duration and severity of symptoms. RESULTS: Feelings of desperation ('hitting rock bottom') and needing to gain or lose weight were associated with the strictest adherence to a gluten-free diet. Participants who accidentally consumed gluten over the past week developed symptoms the most quickly and reported the most pain over the past 6 months. Participants who consumed gluten on purpose over the past week reported a shorter duration of symptoms and less pain over the past 6 months. CONCLUSIONS: Hitting rock bottom and needing to gain or lose weight were factors associated with the strictest adherence, when considered in the context of both accidental and purposeful gluten consumption. Future research is warranted to develop resources to help people with coeliac disease follow a strict gluten-free diet.},

   abstract = {CD is defined as T-lymphocyte-mediated gluten sensitivity. Although CD is known to affect the small intestine, it is nonetheless a multisystem disorder. Liver involvement in CD may vary from isolated hypertransaminasemia to cirrhosis. Because CD is an inappropriate immune response to gluten proteins, strict gluten-free diet is the principal therapy, along with management of liver dysfunction. In patients who fail to respond to a gluten-free diet, immunosuppressive drugs may improve intestinal inflammatory activity in untreated CD. The present case report is of a 25-yr-old woman with diarrhea lasting several weeks. The patient had received a liver transplant 13 yr earlier, and presented with cryptogenic cirrhosis diagnosed as CD. This appears to be the first case of its kind in which a pediatric long-term liver transplant patient presents with diarrhea eventually diagnosed as CD whose diet included gluten, and who was treated by an immunosuppressive drug regimen. Because of the normalization of CD-related antibodies in the post-transplantation period without gluten restriction, CD should be part of a list of diagnostic possibilities in liver transplant patients presenting with diarrhea of unknown etiology.},

(3)(4)(8). On the basis of some research evidence and consensus, guidelines recommend celiac testing in symptomatic children with typical and atypical symptoms and consideration of testing in those with associated conditions and first-degree relatives of those with celiac disease. (3)(9). On the basis of strong research evidence, measurement of tTG IgA and total serum IgA level has been reported to be the most cost-effective and accurate means of serologic testing for celiac disease and is the test of choice unless the child is younger than 2 years or IgA deficient. (9). On the basis of strong research evidence, children with elevated titers of celiac antibodies or strong clinical suspicion for celiac disease should be referred to a gastroenterologist for upper endoscopy and biopsy. Until this procedure is performed, the child should continue on a diet with ingestion of gluten. (3)(9). On the basis of strong research evidence, all those with a confirmed diagnosis of celiac disease should follow a strict gluten-free diet for life, with avoidance of all foods that contain wheat, barley, and rye ingredients. (3)(4). Referral to a health care professional with specialized knowledge of celiac disease and the gluten-free diet is critical because of the numerous ways, often hidden, in which gluten may be present in the diet and environment.},

It seems that the recommendations of exclusive breastfeeding until the age of 4 months and subsequently exposure to various solid foods has beneficial effect in terms of allergic, immunologic, and cardiovascular diseases prevention. Will these recommendations change the natural course of these diseases is unknown yet, but there is accumulating evidence that indeed this is the case.

   abstract = {Celiac disease (CD) is regarded as the most common autoimmune enteropathy in western countries. Epidemiological studies indicate that approximately 1:100 individuals may present with histologically proven CD. CD develops in genetically predisposed subjects after gluten ingestion. It usually subsides after gluten is withdrawn from their diet. Gluten is the only known environmental factor that affects the progression/regression of the intestinal villous atrophy, which is the hallmark of this disease. CD generally follows a benign course after gluten elimination. However, it is also associated with the development of other autoimmune disorders or of intestinal malignancies. The issue of whether such complications, sometimes of significant clinical and prognostic impact, are or are not the result of ongoing gluten ingestion, is an important one that has been investigated over the recent years with conflicting results. In terms of practical implications, the presence of a positive correlation between gluten intake and the development of severe complications would lead to the need for early diagnosis and mass screening. The lack of such correlation would instead suggest a less aggressive diagnostic strategy. This review aims at critically summarizing the evidence supporting either hypothesis.},

Iron-deficiency anemia is the most commonly encountered anemia in humans. Iron-deficiency anemia also is a common extraintestinal manifestation of celiac disease. To determine the celiac disease prevalence in children with iron-deficiency anemia and to compare the hematologic parameters in iron-deficiency anemia patients with and without celiac disease. MATERIALS AND METHODS: A total of 61 patients aged 2-16 years who presented with iron-deficiency anemia were included in this study. Hemoglobin, red cell indices (mean corpuscular volume, mean corpuscular hemoglobin, mean corpuscular hemoglobin concentration, red cell distribution width), serum iron, and serum ferritin were determined. Venous blood samples for anti-tissue transglutaminase antibody immunoglobuline A were obtained from these patients. Upper gastrointestinal endoscopy was recommended to patients who had positive serology. RESULTS: Of 61 patients with iron-deficiency anemia, 13 (21,3%) had positive serology for celiac disease. The small intestine biopsy of all patients with positive serology showed villous atrophy (Marsh 3). The mean hemoglobin level was significantly lower in iron-deficiency anemia patients with celiac disease when compared to those without celiac disease (7,8+/-2,6 vs. 11,3+/-0,9 g/dL, p>0,05). There was a statistically significant negative correlation of tissue transglutaminase titers with hemoglobin, red cell indices, serum iron, and serum ferritin levels. CONCLUSIONS: Screening of celiac disease by anti-tissue transglutaminase antibody should be done as a routine investigation in children with iron-deficiency anemia. Biopsy should be recommended in patients with iron-deficiency anemia who have positive celiac disease serology.},

Nevertheless, healthcare providers often avoid addressing diet with their patients because of a lack of training, guideline consensus, and high-quality data. Recent literature supports the existence of a subgroup of IBS patients with undiagnosed nonceliac gluten sensitivity (NCGS), a term that is used to describe individuals who experience gastrointestinal and extraintestinal symptoms as a result of immunologic, morphologic, or symptomatic abnormalities that are precipitated by the ingestion of gluten. NCGS represents an important subgroup of patients with IBS who are highly treatable via dietary modification. Gluten may influence gastrointestinal symptoms through immune activation or alteration of intestinal permeability, but the true role of food in functional gastrointestinal symptomatology remains unclear. For example, gluten is just 1 component of the complex milieu of nutrients found in wheat and related grains, and NCGS likely represents only the tip of the iceberg as it pertains to the role of food in IBS.},

   abstract = {Celiac disease (CD) is a chronic disease causing the inflammation of the proximal small intestine, in genetically predisposed individuals. This is triggered by the consumption of the gluten protein and the side effects of the disease are mitigated by a lifelong gluten-free diet (GFD) treatment. The predominant consequence of CD is malnutrition due to malabsorption (with diarrhea, weight loss, nutritional deficiencies, and altered blood parameters), especially in patients who do not show strict adherence to GFD treatment. Recent evidence shows that, despite a lifelong GFD, some functional disorders persist, such as compromised gallbladder function and motility, exocrine pancreatic insufficiency, increased gut permeability, small-intestinal bowel overgrowth, nonalcoholic fatty liver disease (NAFLD), lactose intolerance, and milk allergy. These abnormalities may predispose to the occurrence of overweight and obesity even in CD patients. This review focuses on the principal functional and metabolic disorders in both treated and untreated CD, ranging from alterations of the gastrointestinal system to impaired glucose and lipid metabolism and insulin secretion with the aim of providing new implications beyond a GFD, for an ad hoc nutrition treatment in these patients.},

BACKGROUND: Celiac disease (CD) is characterized by small intestinal malabsorption of nutrients as a consequence of ingestion of wheat gluten. Zinc is an essential trace element that it has vital biological functions. PATIENTS AND METHODS: Sera of 30 celiac cases and 30 healthy normal cohorts as control group were obtained. Atomic absorption spectrophotometer was employed for estimating serum zinc level. RESULTS: Zinc concentrations in patients diagnosed with CD were significantly lower than healthy subjects (75.97+/-12 compared with 92.83+/-18, P-value < 0.0001). CONCLUSION: The result of this study shows that serum zinc concentration is decreased in celiac patients compare to healthy controls. Serum zinc may thus be a marker of CD in adults presenting with gastrointestinal symptoms.},

   abstract = {Gluten-free diet (GFD) is the cornerstone treatment for celiac disease (CD). This diet excludes the protein gluten a protein forum in in grains such as wheat, barley, rye and triticale. Gluten causes small intestines inflammation in patients with CD and eating a GFD helps these patients in controlling signs and symptoms and prevent complications. Following a GFD may be frustrating, however, it is important to know that plenty of foods are naturally gluten-free and nowadays is relatively easy to find substitutes for gluten-containing foods. Certain grains, such as oats, are generally safe but can be contaminated with wheat during growing and processing stages of production. For this reason, it is generally recommended avoiding oats unless they are specifically labelled gluten-free. Other products that may contain gluten include food additives, such as malt flavouring, modified food starch and some supplement and/or vitamins that use gluten as a binding agent. Cross-contamination occurs when gluten-free foods come into contact with foods that contain gluten. It can happen during the manufacturing process or if the same equipment is used to make a variety of products. Cross-contamination can also occur at home if foods are prepared on common surfaces or with utensils that have not been cleaned after being used to prepare gluten-containing foods (using a toaster for gluten-free and regular bread). Although safe and effective, the GFD is not ideal: it is expensive, of limited nutritional value, and not readily available in many countries. Consequently, a need exists for novel, non-dietary therapies for celiac disease. Advances in understanding the immunopathogenesis of CD have suggested several types of therapeutic strategies alternative to the GFD. Some of these strategies attempt to decrease the immunogenicity of gluten-containing grains by manipulating the grain itself or by using oral enzymes to break down immunogenic peptides that normally remain intact during digestion. Other strategies focus on preventing the absorption of these peptides, preventing tissue transglutaminase from rendering gluten peptides more immunogenic, or inhibiting their binding to CD-specific antigen-presenting molecules. Strategies that limit T cell migration to the small intestine or that re-establish mucosal homeostasis and tolerance to gluten antigens are also being explored.},

   abstract = {The introduction of cereals in human nutrition 10 000 years ago caused the occurrence of gluten induced diseases. This protein complex is involved in pathogenesis of wheat allergy, celiac disease, and gluten sensitivity. Wheat allergy and celiac disease are mediated by the system of adaptive immunity. Gluten sensitivity is a recently defined entity induced by innate immune mechanisms. These subjects present various intestinal and particularly extraintestinal symptoms. The differences between celiac disease and gluten intolerance include permeability of the intestinal mucosal barrier, histology of duodenal biopsy, and mucosal gene expression. The symptoms of gluten sensitivity may also have another genetic background of food intolerance independent of the HLADQ2, - DQ8 system and tissue transglutaminase (eg. in some psychiatric disorders). At present, there is no specific bio-marker of gluten sensitivity. The diagnosis is possible only by exclusion of other causes of symptoms and improvement on a glutenfree diet applied in a doubleblind placebo controlled manner with optional sequence of both stages to exclude the placebo effect due to nutritional intervention.},

   abstract = {BACKGROUND AND OBJECTIVE: Genomic instability and reduced glutathione S-transferase (GST) activity have been identified as potential risk factors for malignant complications in celiac disease (CD). In this study, we assessed the possible influence of GST polymorphisms on genome instability phenotypes in a genetically characterised group of celiac patients from previous studies. METHODS: The deletion polymorphisms in GSTM1 and GSTT1 genes and the single-nucleotide polymorphism GSTP1 c.313A>G were genotyped using PCR in a set of 20 untreated adult patients with a known genomic instability phenotype and 69 age- and sex-matched healthy individuals. RESULTS: The frequencies of variant genotypes in patients were GSTM1-null (30%), GSTT1-null (5%), GSTP1-AG (60%) and GSTP1-GG (15%), and they showed no differences from controls. No significant differences were found in the genotype distribution based on telomere length. Cases with GSTM1-null genotype (83%) and microsatellite stability were more frequent than those with genomic instability. Moreover, carriers of GSTP1-variant genotype (73%) and stable phenotype were significantly increased compared to unstable patients (27%) (P=0.031). No differences were found according to the clinical-pathological characteristics of celiac cases. CONCLUSIONS: No association between GST polymorphic variants and celiac-associated genomic instability was proven in our cohort. Future studies should explore the usefulness of other biomarkers to distinguish celiac patients who are susceptible to cancer development.},

   abstract = {Throughout the world, cereals have always been recognized as a fundamental food. Human evolution, through the development of cooking, led to the production of food rich in gluten, in order to take full advantage of the nutritional properties of this food. The result has been that gluten intolerance has arisen only in those populations that developed the art of cooking wheat. It is also recognized that wheat, one of the central elements of the Mediterranean diet, cannot be tolerated in some individuals. Among the wheat-related pathologies, coeliac disease is the best known: it is a chronic inflammatory condition affecting the gastrointestinal tract, which develops in genetically predisposed individuals. The most common manifestation is the malabsorption of nutrients. Recently, another wheat-related disease has appeared: non-coeliac gluten sensitivity, defined as the onset of a variety of manifestations related to wheat, rye and barley ingestion, in patients in whom coeliac disease and wheat allergy have been excluded. In this paper we will explore the damaging power of wheat, analysing the harmful process by which it realizes the onset of clinical manifestations associated with wheat-related disorders.},

   abstract = {A gluten-free diet (GFD) is currently the only available treatment for patients with celiac disease (CD). Several clinical trials have demonstrated that most celiac patients can tolerate a medium-high quantity of oats without any negative clinical effects; however, the inclusion of oats in GFD is still a matter of debate. In this study, Italian children with CD were enrolled in a 15-month, randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled multicenter trial. Participants were randomized in two groups following either A-B treatment (6 months of diet "A", 3 months of standard GFD, 6 months of diet "B"), or B-A treatment (6 months of diet "B", 3 months of standard GFD, 6 months of diet "A"). A and B diets included gluten-free (GF) products (flour, pasta, biscuits, cakes and crisp toasts) with either purified oats or placebo. Clinical data (Gastrointestinal Symptoms Rate Scale [GSRS] score) and intestinal permeability tests (IPT), were measured through the study period. Although the study is still blinded, no significant differences were found in GSRS score or the urinary lactulose/mannitol (L/M) ratio between the two groups after 6 months of treatment. These preliminary results suggest that the addition of non-contaminated oats from selected varieties in the treatment of children with CD does not determine changes in intestinal permeability and gastrointestinal symptoms.},

Interest in teff has increased noticeably due to its very attractive nutritional profile and gluten-free nature of the grain, making it a suitable substitute for wheat and other cereals in their food applications as well as foods for people with celiac disease. The main objective of this article is to review researches on teff, evaluate its suitability for different food applications, and give direction for further research on its applications for health food market. Teff is a tropical low risk cereal that grows in a wider ecology and can tolerate harsh environmental conditions where most other cereals are less viable. It has an excellent balance of amino acid composition (including all 8 essential amino acids for humans) making it an excellent material for malting and brewing. Because of its small size, teff is made into whole-grain flour (bran and germ included), resulting in a very high fiber content and high nutrient content in general. Teff is useful to improve the haemoglobin level in human body and helps to prevent malaria, incidence of anaemia and diabetes. The nutrient composition of teff grain indicates that it has a good potential to be used in foods and beverages worldwide. The high levels of simple sugars and alpha-amino acids as a result of breakdown of starch and protein, respectively, are essential for fermentation and beer making.},

We aimed to assess the rate of mucosal healing and indications for repeat small bowel (SB) biopsy in children with CD. METHODS: We retrospectively reviewed records of children (ages 1-18 years) with CD who underwent a second SB biopsy. All of the children were seen at Mayo Clinic (Rochester, MN) from January 1997 through June 2013. RESULTS: Forty children were identified (14 boys); average age at diagnosis was 8.5 years. Indications for second SB biopsy were abdominal pain (n = 20), diarrhea (n = 7), constipation (n = 5), non-celiac-related concern (n = 2), follow-up (n = 5), and persistent serology (n = 1). Average time between biopsies was 24 months (range 4-120 months). Histology on the second biopsy showed complete healing (n = 25), intraepithelial lymphocytes (n = 9), and persistent villous atrophy (n = 6). Of these, 3 patients had partial villous atrophy and 3 had with complete villous atrophy. Persistent villous atrophy was observed in 2 of 20 patients with abdominal pain and 1 of 7 with diarrhea. All of the patients with persistent constipation (n = 5) had complete resolution. CONCLUSIONS: Mucosal healing in children with CD may not be complete as previously assumed. Abdominal pain was the most common indication for repeating the SB biopsy. Persistence of abdominal pain, diarrhea, and constipation was poorly associated with persistence of mucosal injury.},

   abstract = {BACKGROUND: In patients with treated celiac disease (CD), the ingestion of gluten traces contained in gluten-free (GF) wheat substitutes (eg, GF bread, flour, and pasta) could cause persisting intestinal mucosal damage. OBJECTIVE: The objective was to evaluate the proportion of CD patients at risk of mucosal damage due to the consumption of GF products in 4 European countries (Italy, Spain, Germany, and Norway). DESIGN: A probabilistic modeling approach was used to assess the risk of gluten intake at the population level. The input variables were 1) consumption of GF products, 2) concentration of gluten traces in GF products determined by the sandwich R5 ELISA method, and 3) the gluten threshold for mucosal damage of 10 to 50 mg/d. Different population and product availability scenarios were examined for risk assessment. RESULTS: The gluten content of 205 commercially available GF products ranged between <5 and 27.8 mg/kg. Overall, 99.5% of the analyzed samples had a gluten concentration <20 mg/kg. Most (94%) had a gluten concentration below the limit of quantification (5 mg/kg). The mean percentage of the CD European population at risk of mucosal damage resulting from consumption of GF products ranged between 0.01 (Germany) and 0.15 (Italy) and remained very low, even in the worst-case scenario (<1%). CONCLUSIONS: The adoption of a single gluten threshold (20 mg/kg) for gluten contamination is suggested. GF products in Europe constitute a very safe option for patients with CD. The dietary follow-up of CD patients should focus on other potential sources of gluten contamination.},

   abstract = {BACKGROUND: The aim of this study was to analyze and compare the epidemiological and presenting features, clinical patterns, and complications of celiac disease (CD) in children. METHODS: The clinical charts of children with CD were retrospectively analyzed. Data for children who presented during the first time period (January 2005-October 2008; group 1) were compared to those of children who presented during the second time period (November 2008-April 2012; group 2). RESULTS: Group 1 and 2 consisted of 96 and 95 children, respectively. There were no differences in gender distribution, weight, or height z-scores between the two groups. Mean age at the time of diagnosis in group 2 (9.3 +/- 4.5 years) was significantly higher than in group 1 (6.9 +/- 3.9 years; P < 0.001). Non-classical presentation was more frequent in group 2 (P = 0.01). Associated disorders were observed in 49 children (25.7%) overall. There were significantly more children with type 1 diabetes mellitus in group 2 (P = 0.030). In all, 11 patients (5.8%) were overweight (either obese or at risk of obesity) at presentation. Isolated short stature was the presenting feature in 15 children (7.9%) overall, but was more frequently observed in group 2 (P = 0.003). In total, 15 patients (7.9%) presented with refractory iron deficiency anemia; the frequency was similar in both groups. Dual-energy X-ray absorptiometry was performed in 102 patients, and 82 (80.4%) had metabolic bone disease (MBD). CONCLUSION: The mode of presentation and clinical features of CD in childhood continue to change. Of note, a substantial percentage of patients were overweight at presentation. MBD is a frequent complication, necessitating routine evaluation.},

   abstract = {CONTEXT: The ingestion of gluten is responsible for the symptoms of Celiac disease, but other environmental factors can also influence. Strains of the Bifidobacterium genus have been shown to afford protection against the inflammatory response and mucosal damage caused by gliadin peptides in vitro. OBJECTIVES: This study was designed to compare the concentration of fecal bifidobacteria and pH of patients with celiac disease on gluten-free diet and control subjects in order to identify if the imbalance on fecal microbiota still remain during the treatment of celiac disease and identify the necessity of dietary supplementation with pre- or probiotics. METHODS: It was analyzed the feces of 42 healthy subjects and 14 celiac patients. The bifidobacteria count in feces was done in selective medium BIM-25. Microscopic analysis of the colonies was performed by Gram stain. The identification of the genus Bifidobacterium was performed by determination of fructose-6-phosphate phosphoketolase. Fecal pH was measured using a pH meter. RESULTS: The concentration of bifidobacteria per gram of feces was significantly higher in healthy subjects (controls) (1.5 +/- 0.63 x108 CFU/g) when compared to celiac patients (2.5 +/- 1.5 x107 CFU/g). The fecal pH was not different between celiac patients (7.19 +/- 0.521) and controls (7.18 +/- 0.522). CONCLUSIONS: These results suggest that with lower levels of bifidobacteria, celiac patients have an imbalance in the intestinal microbiota, regardless of pH, even while on a gluten-free diet. This fact could favor the pathological process of the disorder.},

   abstract = {OBJECTIVE: To assess the prevalence of and explanations for wheat avoidance, including reported symptoms, diagnoses and information sources influencing the decision to avoid wheat, and to investigate potential psychological predictors of this behaviour. DESIGN: Cross-sectional population survey. SETTING: The study was conducted in Australia, using a nationwide postal omnibus survey. SUBJECTS: Adults aged 18 years and over (n 1184; 52.9% female) selected at random from the Australian Electoral Roll. RESULTS: With cases of stated and suspected coeliac disease (1.2%) excluded, 7.3% of the sample reported adverse physiological effects, predominantly gastrointestinal, that they associated with wheat consumption. Few among this group (5.7%) claimed a formally diagnosed intolerance or allergy requiring avoidance of wheat-based foods. Symptomatic wheat avoidance was highly correlated with dairy avoidance and predicted by gender (female), lesser receptiveness to conventional medicine and greater receptiveness to complementary medicine, but not by neuroticism, reasoning style or tendency to worry about illness. CONCLUSIONS: The data indicate that many adult Australians are consciously avoiding consumption of wheat foods, predominantly without any formal diagnosis. Reported symptoms suggest a physiological but not allergenic basis to this behaviour. Questions to be answered concern whether symptoms are attributed correctly to wheat, the agents (wheat components, dietary factors or additives) and physiological mechanism(s) involved, the nutritional adequacy of avoiders' diets, and the clinical and psychosocial processes that lead a substantial number of adults to avoid consuming wheat (or any other dietary factor) apparently independently of a medical diagnosis.},

   abstract = {OBJECTIVES: Although a diagnosis of coeliac disease (CD) may be confronting to children with type 1 diabetes and their families, we hypothesize that children with CD have lower urinary albumin excretion, a marker of renal dysfunction. RESEARCH DESIGN: Twenty-four children with type 1 diabetes and biopsy-proven CD, on a gluten-free diet for at least 1 yr, were recruited from a single paediatric diabetes clinic alongside 55 children with type 1 diabetes but without CD matched for age, gender, duration of diabetes, and glycaemic control. RESULTS: Despite comparable diabetes exposure, glycaemic control and nutritional status, children with type 1 diabetes and CD had a lower urinary albumin creatinine ratio than in diabetic subjects without CD (0.9 +/- 0.3 mg/mmol vs. 1.6 +/- 0.3 mg/mmol; p = 0.01). Participants with CD also showed slower progression in albuminuria over 5-yr of follow-up while a small but significant increase was observed in the children with diabetes alone (1.6 +/- 0.3 mg/mmol; follow-up 2.4 +/- 0.5 mg/mmol; p = 0.02). CONCLUSIONS: As urinary albumin excretion is continuously associated with the risk of kidney disease, it is possible to speculate that CD or its management confers a degree of renoprotection. Larger studies are required to test this hypothesis.},

   abstract = {Abnormalities of transmembrane and cytoplasmic proteins of tight junctions (TJ) have been implicated in pathogenesis of both celiac (CeD) and Crohn's diseases (CD). Since disease pathogenesis in CeD and CD are different, we planned to study if there is any differential expression pattern of TJ marker proteins and ultrastructural changes, respectively, in duodenal villi vs crypts. Endoscopic duodenal biopsies from treatment naive patients with CeD (n = 24), active CD (n = 28), and functional dyspepsia (as controls, n = 15), both at baseline and 6 months after treatment, were subjected to light microscopic analysis (modified Marsh grading); immune-histochemical staining and Western blot analysis to see the expression of key TJ proteins [trans-membrane proteins (claudin-2, claudin-3, claudin-4, occludin, and JAM) and cytoplasmic protein (ZO-1)]. Transmission electron microscopy and image analysis of the TJs were also performed. There was significant overexpression of claudin-2 (pore-forming) and occludin (protein maintaining cell polarity) with under-expression of claudin-3 and claudin-4 (pore-sealing proteins) in treatment naive CeD and active CD with simultaneous alteration in ultrastructure of TJs such as loss of penta-laminar structure and TJ dilatation. Normalization of some of these TJ proteins was noted 6 months after treatment. These changes were not disease specific and were not different in duodenal villi and crypts. Overexpression of pore-forming and under-expression of pore-sealing TJ proteins lead to dilatation of TJ. These changes are neither disease specific nor site specific and the end result of mucosal inflammation.},

   abstract = {The human gut is a unique organ in which hundreds of different microbial species find their habitat and in which different host physiologic functions, such as digestion, nutrition, and immunity, coexist. Although all these players were studied separately for decades, recently, there has been an explosion of studies demonstrating the essential role for interactions between these components in gut function. Furthermore, new systems biology methods provide essential tools to study this complex system as a whole and to identify key elements that define the crosstalk between the gut microbiota, immunity, and metabolism. This review is devoted to several human diseases resulting from the disruption in this crosstalk, including immunodeficiency-associated and environmental enteropathies, celiac disease, inflammatory bowel disease, and obesity. We describe findings in experimental models of these diseases and in germ-free animals that help us understand the mechanisms and test new therapeutic strategies. We also discuss current challenges that the field is facing and propose that a new generation of antibiotics, prebiotics, and probiotics coupled with novel, systems biology-driven diagnostics will provide the basis for future personalized therapy.},

   abstract = {Triggered by the ingestion of gluten in genetically predisposed individuals, celiac disease is the most common genetically based food intolerance in the world, with a prevalence among approximately 1% of the general population. This enteropathy may appear at any age and is characterized by a wide variety of clinical signs and symptoms that go well beyond the gastrointestinal tract. In young children, gastrointestinal presentations are common and include chronic diarrhea, failure to thrive, and abdominal distention; however, extraintestinal manifestations are becoming increasingly more common. They include numerous conditions such as dermatitis herpetiformis, anemia, dental enamel hypoplasia, recurrent oral aphthae, short stature, osteoporosis, arthritis, neurologic problems, unexplained elevation of transaminase levels, and female infertility. Therefore, diagnosing celiac disease requires a high degree of suspicion, followed by correct screening and a confirmatory test with an intestinal biopsy. After diagnosis, a strict gluten-free diet must be followed, which in most cases will bring a marked improvement of symptoms. However, there are important compliance and quality-of-life problems, especially in adolescents.},

   abstract = {OBJECTIVE: Although it is well known that celiac disease (CD) is associated with neurologic disorders, association with psychiatric problems is not well defined. In this report, we aimed to detect CD prevalence in patients with attention-deficit hyperactivity disorder (ADHD). METHODS: A total of 362 patients between the ages 5 and 15 years with the diagnosis of ADHD according to the Diagnostic and Statistical Manual of Mental Disorders, Fourth Edition, Text Revision (DSM-IV-TR) diagnostic criteria and 390 sex- and age-matched healthy children were included in the present study. Serum levels of tissue transglutaminase (tTg) immunoglobulin (Ig) A and IgG were studied in both groups. Serum IgA levels were also studied in patients with positive tTG IgG for the exclusion of selective IgA deficiency. Endoscopic duodenal biopsy was provided in seropositive patients, whose parents approved the procedure. Biopsy samples were evaluated according to Marsh-Oberhuber classification. RESULTS: tTg IgA was positive in 4 patients with ADHD (1.1%). Endoscopic duodenal biopsy was suggestive of CD in one of them (0.27%). tTg IgA was positive in 3 of control group patients (0.8%). Duodenal biopsy of the only patient from control group, who underwent upper gastrointestinal endoscopy, revealed normal intestinal mucosa. CONCLUSIONS: The seropositivity rates for CD were found similar in ADHD and control groups. Thus, neither routine screening for CD nor empirical recommendation of gluten-free diet seems necessary in children with ADHD.},

   abstract = {BACKGROUND: Increased numbers of duodenal intraepithelial lymphocytes (IELs) characterise coeliac disease (CD) but have also been described in noncoeliacs. Controversy exists regarding an association between increased IELs and infection with Helicobacter pylori, which is commonly found in children. AIM: To assess the relationship between H. pylori infection and duodenal IELs in a large cohort of children, with and without CD. METHODS: We reviewed gastric and duodenal biopsies of children who underwent esophagogastroduodenoscopy between January 2006 and February 2013 because of either recurrent abdominal pain (RAP) or suspected CD at Schneider Children's Medical Center of Israel, a referral centre for Israel's largest Health Maintenance Organization. The duodenal IEL count and H. pylori presence in antral biopsies were determined for each specimen. RESULTS: Children with RAP (n = 693) or CD (n = 306) were included. Among children with RAP, H. pylori was present in 33.8%. The mean IEL count in the H. pylori positive RAP group was 17.8(+/-8.8)/100 enterocytes, vs. 15.8(+/-8.3) in the H. pylori negative patients (P = 0.004). Increased IEL counts (>/=25 IELs/100 enterocytes) were found in 15.7% of H. pylori negative, noncoeliac children. Among children with CD, there was no significant difference in IEL counts according to H. pylori status: 73.1(+/-26.1) vs. 72.6 (+/-26.5) in H. pylori positive and negative patients respectively. CONCLUSIONS: Our study suggests that slightly elevated duodenal intraepithelial lymphocyte counts are common in the paediatric population. Helicobacter pylori infection has no major influence on the intraepithelial lymphocyte counts in children with recurrent abdominal pain or children with coeliac disease.},

   abstract = {The 33 amino acid peptide hormone GLP-2 is produced by enteroendocrine L-cells, the density of which is highest in the ileum and the colon, in response to the presence of nutrients in the lumen. The biological effect of GLP-2 is mediated by activation of a G-protein-coupled 7-transmembrane receptor. GLP-2 receptors are expressed in the brainstem, lungs, stomach, small intestine and colon, but not in the heart. It has been shown in several animal studies that GLP-2 infusion increases intestinal blood flow and that this increase is confined to the small intestine. The aim of the three studies, on which the thesis is based, was to investigate basic physiological effects of GLP-2, in healthy volunteers and in SBS patients, with focus on the effects on mesenteric blood flow, blood flow at other vascular sites and effects on cardiac parameters. These parameters have been evaluated after both meal stimulation and GLP-2 administration. The studies showed the following results: Blood flow: In all three studies, blood flow changes in the SMA after GLP-2 administration were similar regarding changes over time and degree of change. Blood flow changes were similar to changes seen after a standard meal. Only RI changes were registered in all three studies, but the TAMV changes in study 2 and 3 had similar characteristics. Cardiovascular parameters: In all three studies no significant changes in blood pressure were registered in relation to GLP-2 administration. In study two and three, where cardiac parameters also were registered by impedance cardiography, increases in CO and SV were seen. Plasma GLP-2: There were, as expected, supraphysiological GLP-2 plasma levels after SC administration. All three studies have shown rapid changes in mesenteric blood flow after administration GLP-2. The changes have been the same both in regards to time to maximum changes (increase) and relatively close in regards to maximum extent of change. The changes in the SBS patients were less than in the healthy test subjects. The findings leave no doubt about that GLP-2 is a potent regulator of upper splanchnic blood flow. The study findings also support the notion that the observed increased mesenteric blood flow, isolated to the SMA, is secondary to the metabolic responses to GLP-2, and that these are likely due to a paracrine action by GLP-2 acting on GLP-2R bearing cells such as enteric neurons, probably expressing NO. In conclusion GLP-2 increases mesenteric blood flow in healthy subjects and in SBS patients, the increase is equivalent to a standard meal and dose dependent. The blood flow is not increased at other arterial vascular sites. GLP-2 does not acutely alter blood pressure, but increases, probably as compensation, pulse rate and cardiac output. GLP-2 induced vascular response in the superior mesenteric artery is related with the length of remaining intestine in SBS patients. The effect is therefore likely to reflect the metabolic activity in the tissue rather than direct effect on the vascular system.},

   abstract = {BACKGROUND: It is conceivable that overstimulation of chemo- and mechano-sensors in the Roux and common limbs by uncontrolled influx of undigested nutrients after Roux-en-Y gastric bypass surgery (RYGB) could lead to exaggerated satiety signaling via vagal afferents and contribute to body weight loss. Because previous clinical and preclinical studies using vagotomy came to different conclusions, the aim was to examine the effects of selective and histologically verified celiac branch vagotomy on reduced food intake and body weight loss induced by RYGB. METHODS: Male Sprague-Dawley rats underwent either RYGB + celiac branch vagotomy (RYGB/VgX, n=15), RYGB + sham celiac branch vagotomy (RYGB/Sham VgX; n=6), Sham RYGB + celiac branch vagotomy (Sham/VgX; n=6), or sham RYGB + sham celiac branch vagotomy (Sham/Sham; n=6), and body weight, body composition, and food choice were monitored for 3 months after intervention. RESULTS: In rats with RYGB, histologically confirmed celiac branch vagotomy significantly moderated weight loss during the first 40 days after surgery, compared to either sham or failed vagotomy (P<0.05). In contrast, celiac branch vagotomy slightly, but non-significantly, reduced body weight gain in sham RYGB rats compared to sham/sham rats. Furthermore, the significant food intake suppression during the first 32 days after RYGB (P<0.05) was also moderated in rats with verified celiac branch vagotomy. CONCLUSIONS: The results suggest that signals carried by vagal afferents from the mid and lower intestines contribute to the early RYGB-induced body weight loss and reduction of food intake.},

Currently, a life-long gluten-free diet is the only available treatment for patients with celiac disease. However, adherence to gluten-free diet is difficult due to the widespread use of wheat-derived gluten in the food industry. Therefore, there is a pressing need for the development of novel non-dietary therapies. In this article, we will review several promising strategies focusing on reducing gluten immunogenicity or sequestering to gluten prevent its uptake by the intestinal epithelium. Other possible treatment strategies that will be reviewed include the suppression of the adaptive immune response, permeability modulation and the use of systemic T-cell or cytokine blockers.},

MATERIAL AND METHODS: A systematic review of observational studies published between 1966 and May 2004 on the subject was conducted in 2005. This update is a systematic review of observational studies published between June 2004 and April 2011. Pubmed, EMBASE and Cinahl were searched for published studies that examined the association between breastfeeding and CD. RESULTS: After duplicates were removed 90 citations were screened. Four observational studies were included in the review. Two of three studies which had examined the duration of breastfeeding and CD reported significant associations between longer duration of breastfeeding and later onset of CD (OR ranged from 0.18 to 0.665). Breastfeeding during the introduction of gluten to the infant was reported to have a protective effect in two studies. CONCLUSIONS: Our findings support previous published findings that breastfeeding seems to offer a protection against the development of CD in predisposed infants. Breastfeeding at time of gluten introduction is the most significant variable in reducing the risk. Timing of gluten introduction may also be a factor in the development of CD.},

   abstract = {UNLABELLED: Celiac crisis is a life-threatening presentation of celiac disease which is described in the context of classic gastrointestinal (GI) symptoms of diarrhea, leading to dehydration and electrolyte imbalance. Neurologic manifestations are atypical symptoms of celiac crisis. To the best of our knowledge, there is no published report on seizure or encephalopathy as the presenting manifestation of celiac crisis. We describe a 2-year-old boy presenting with acute status epilepticus and lethargy. Prior to presentation, he had mild abdominal distention and intermittent diarrhea. Laboratory analysis revealed hyponatremia, anemia, hypocalcemia, transaminitis, and hyperglycemia. Electroencephalography revealed severe diffuse encephalopathy, and complete infectious work-up was negative. Initial brain magnetic resonance imaging was normal; however, repeat imaging showed osmotic demyelination syndrome. Given the history of GI symptoms and hyperglycemia, celiac serology was obtained revealing elevated tissue transglutaminase, and a diagnosis was confirmed by Marsh 3c lesions in the duodenum. He significantly improved with steroid therapy in addition to adequate nutrition, fluids, and initiation of a gluten-free diet. CONCLUSION: We report herein on the first case of celiac crisis presenting with status epilepticus and encephalopathy in the absence of profound GI symptoms. Our case suggests that celiac crisis should be considered in the differential of seizures and encephalopathy in children.},

METHODS: During the period of 30 months, we included 44 patients. Chromosome aberrations were analyzed in peripheral blood lymphocytes by a single cytogeneticist. Multicolor flow cytometric was used for immunophenotyping of peripheral blood lymphocytes. RESULTS: We found a significantly higher number of chromosomal aberrations/100 metaphases in the celiac and Crohn's disease group compared with the controls (P=0.01) and they also had a significantly higher number of aberrant cells compared with the controls (P<0.001). There was no statistically significant difference between the groups with respect to the percentage of CD103+ and CD8+CD103+ cells between groups (P=0.16 and 0.41, respectively) and no correlation between the total number of chromosomal aberrations and the percentage of CD103+ and CD8+CD103+ cells (P=0.06 and 0.06, respectively). CONCLUSION: Patients with active celiac and newly diagnosed Crohn's disease, before treatment initiation, have a significantly increased number of chromosomal aberrations in peripheral blood lymphocytes. No dissemination of intraepithelial cells in the blood and correlation to the chromosomal aberration was found.},

   abstract = {BACKGROUND: Patients with persistent symptoms and/or villous atrophy despite strict adherence to a gluten-free diet (GFD) have non-responsive celiac disease (NRCD). A subset of these patients has refractory celiac disease (RCD), yet some NRCD patients may simply be reacting to gluten cross-contamination. Here we describe the effects of a 3-6 month diet of whole, unprocessed foods, termed the Gluten Contamination Elimination Diet (GCED), on NRCD. We aim to demonstrate that this diet reclassifies the majority of patients thought to have RCD type 1 (RCD1). METHODS: We reviewed the records of all GFD-adherent NRCD patients cared for in our celiac center from 2005-2011 who were documented to have started the GCED. Response to the GCED was defined as being asymptomatic after the diet, with normal villous architecture on repeat biopsy, if performed. RESULTS: Prior to the GCED, all patients were interviewed by an experienced dietitian and no sources of hidden gluten ingestion were identified. 17 patients completed the GCED; 15 were female (88%). Median age at start of the GCED was 42 years (range 6-73). Fourteen patients (82%) responded to the GCED. Six patients met criteria for RCD prior to the GCED; 5 (83%) were asymptomatic after the GCED and no longer meet RCD criteria. Of the 14 patients who responded to the GCED, 11 (79%) successfully returned to a traditional GFD without resurgence of symptoms. CONCLUSIONS: The GCED may be an effective therapeutic option for GFD-adherent NRCD patients. Response to this diet identifies a subgroup of patients, previously classified as RCD1, that is not truly refractory to dietary treatment. Preventing an inaccurate diagnosis of RCD1 avoids immunotherapy. Most patients are able to return to a traditional GFD without return of symptoms.},

   abstract = {OBJECTIVE: The aim of the present study was to evaluate a panel of different antibody assays, including second-generation antigliadin kits, in a local paediatric population thought to be at risk for coeliac disease (CD). METHODS: Seventy-nine children, who tested positive for immunoglobulin A (IgA) antibodies to tissue transglutaminase (TG), underwent duodenal biopsy. At endoscopy, serum was collected from all of the patients, and 9 different coeliac antibody assays were performed, both as isolated assays and in combination. These included immunoglobulin A (IgA) anti-tissue transglutaminase (TGA), and IgA plus IgG anti-deamidated gliadin peptide (DGPAG). A diagnosis of CD was made if the biopsies showed Marsh grade 3 lesions. RESULTS: Twenty-four of 79 children had CD confirmed histologically. Only 39 of 79 were positive for Inova TGA, and 35 of 79 were positive for Inova DGPAG. Twenty-four of 39 who were TGA positive and 24 of 35 who were DGPAG positive had confirmed CD on biopsy. There was good correlation between TGA and DGPAG-positive predictive values. None of the modified gliadin tests produced false-negative results, and neither did the TGA. CONCLUSIONS: The Inova DGPAG and TGA assays have similar use in predicting CD in a selected paediatric population; however, in children who are positive for TGA when screened for CD, more than half have negative TGA serology when repeat testing is done at the time of biopsy. Those with persistent TGA positivity have only a 61.5% probability of having histologic CD, compared with 68.6% of those children positive for DGPAG.},

In particular, variation in gluten intake during the complementary feeding period may be an independent risk factor in CD pathogenesis. We determined the intake of gluten from wheat, barley, rye and oats in a cross-sectional National Danish Survey of Dietary Habits among Infants and Young Children (2006-2007). The study population comprised a random sample of 1743 children aged 6-36 months, recruited from the National Danish Civil Registry. The protein contents from wheat, rye, barley and oats were found in the National Danish Food Composition Table, and multiplied with the amounts in the recipes. The amounts of gluten were calculated as the amount of cereal protein x 0.80 for wheat and oats, x0.65 for rye and x0.50 for barley. Dietary intake was recorded daily for seven consecutive days in pre-coded food records supplemented with open-answer possibilities. Gluten intake increased with age (P < 0.0001). Oats were introduced first, rapidly outpaced by wheat, the intake of which continued to increase with age, whereas oats started to decrease at 12 months. Boys had a higher intake of energy (P </= 0.0001) and all types of gluten, except for barley (P </= 0.87). In 8-10-month-old (P < 0.0001) and 10-12-month-old (P = 0.007), but not in 6-8-month-old infants (P = 0.331), non-breast-fed infants had higher total gluten intake than partially breast-fed infants. In conclusion, this study presents representative population-based data on gluten intake in Danish infants and young children.},

The initial literature search resulted in 2,011 abstracts; 416 identified as potentially relevant. Full paper review resulted in 60 quality assessed papers (6A, 48B, and 6C). A complementary search found some additional papers. The grade of evidence was classified as convincing, probable, limited-suggestive, and limited-no conclusion. The evidence was convincing of a protective dose/duration effect of breastfeeding against overweight and obesity in childhood and adolescence, overall infections, acute otitis media, and gastrointestinal and respiratory tract infections. The evidence was probable that exclusive breastfeeding for longer than 4 months is associated with slower weight gain during the second half of the first year which could be part of the reason behind the reduced risk of later overweight or obesity. There was also probable evidence that breastfeeding is a protective factor against inflammatory bowel disease, celiac disease, and diabetes (type 1 and 2), provides beneficial effects on IQ and developmental scores of children as well as a small reductive effect on blood pressure and blood cholesterol levels in adulthood. Other associations explored were limited-suggestive or inconclusive. In conclusion, convincing and probable evidence was found for benefits of breastfeeding on several outcomes. The recommendation in NNR2004 about exclusive breastfeeding for 6 months and continued partial breastfeeding thereafter can stand unchanged. The relatively low proportion of infants in the Nordic countries following this recommendation indicates that strategies that protect, support and promote breastfeeding should be enhanced, and should also recognize the benefits for long-term health.},

   abstract = {Gut microbiota is the community of live microorganisms residing in the digestive tract. There are many groups of researchers worldwide that are working at deciphering the collective genome of the human microbiota. Modern techniques for studying the microbiota have made us aware of an important number of nonculturable bacteria and of the relation between the microorganisms that live inside us and our homeostasis. The microbiota is essential for correct body growth, the development of immunity, and nutrition. Certain epidemics affecting humanity such as asthma and obesity may possibly be explained, at least partially, by alterations in the microbiota. Dysbiosis has been associated with a series of gastrointestinal disorders that include non-alcoholic fatty liver disease, celiac disease, and irritable bowel syndrome. The present article deals with the nomenclature, modern study techniques, and functions of gut microbiota, and its relation to health and disease.},

   abstract = {BACKGROUND: The purpose of this study was to identify the frequency of fat-soluble vitamin deficiencies in children with celiac disease (CD) and to determine the value of routine testing for these deficiencies. METHODS: We conducted a retrospective medical record review of patients with a confirmed diagnosis of CD and fat-soluble vitamin levels measured at diagnosis between 1995 and 2012 at Mayo Clinic. Patients' demographics, fat-soluble vitamin levels, and pertinent clinical factors at the time of diagnosis were collected. RESULTS: Eighty-three patients were included in the final analysis: 51 girls and 32 boys, with an average age at diagnosis of 12.8 years in girls and 13.0 years in boys. The most commonly reported symptoms were abdominal pain in 49 patients and diarrhea in 30 patients. Family history of CD was reported in 32 patients. Average vitamin levels for vitamin E, 25-hydroxyvitamin D (25 (OH) D), and vitamin A were 7.5 mg/L, 32.8 ng/mL, and 334.5 mug/dL, respectively. No patients had vitamin A deficiency, 2 patients had vitamin E deficiency, and 9 patients had mild-to-moderate vitamin D deficiency (none had severe deficiency). Both patients with vitamin E deficiency were symptomatic and had complete villous atrophy. Thirty-one patients had insufficiency of 25 (OH) D, which was less than the reported frequency of vitamin D insufficiency in the general pediatric population in the United States in 2004. None of the patients were receiving vitamin supplements at the time of diagnosis. CONCLUSIONS: Fat-soluble vitamin deficiencies are uncommon in children with new diagnosis of CD. Routine measuring of fat-soluble vitamins levels may not be necessary.},

   abstract = {BACKGROUND: The aim of this retrospective cohort study was to clarify the effectiveness of preserving the celiac branch (CB) of the vagal trunk after the Roux-en-Y (R-Y) reconstruction in laparoscopy-assisted distal gastrectomy (LADG). METHODS: One hundred twenty patients with pathological stage I gastric cancer underwent R-Y reconstruction after LADG with D1 + beta lymphadenectomy between January 2004 and March 2009 and were followed up for 5 years. The patients were divided into 2 groups: the preservation group (P-CB) and the resection group (R-CB). Evaluated variables included symptoms, endoscopic findings, nutritional status, and gallstone formation at 5 years after gastrectomy. RESULTS: Gallstone formation was significantly less common in P-CB than in R-CB (16 vs. 33%, p = 0.035). One patient (2%) in P-CB and 4 (7%) in R-CB underwent surgery for symptomatic gallstones. On multivariate analysis of gallstone formation, R-CB was an independent risk factor for gallstone formation (odds ratio = 2.5, 95% confidential interval: 1.0-6.1, p = 0.049). Symptoms and endoscopic findings did not differ significantly between the groups. Relative values of body weight, serum albumin level, and total cholesterol level also did not significantly differ between the groups. CONCLUSION: Preserving the CB independently contributes to the prevention of gallstone formation during long-term follow-up after R-Y reconstruction following LADG.},

We describe an 8-year-old patient with non-scarring alopecia and diagnosed with trichotillomania. Furthermore, she presented with a 3-year history of poor appetite and two or three annual episodes of mushy, fatty stools. Laboratory investigations showed a normal hemoglobin concentration and a low ferritin level. Serologic studies showed an elevated tissue immunoglobulin G anti-tissue transglutaminase level. A duodenal biopsy showed subtotal villous atrophy and crypt hyperplasia, and a large gastric trichobezoar was found in the stomach. Immediately after beginning a gluten-free diet, complete relief of trichotillomania and trichophagia was achieved. In this report, we describe a behavioral disorder as a primary phenomenon of celiac disease, irrespective of nutritional status.},

OBJECTIVES: The aim of the study was an analysis of clinical findings, selected laboratory features and coexisting diseases in children and adolescents with celiac disease. MATERIAL AND METHODS: Material of the study comprised a series of 78 children aged 8 months - 13 years. Celiac disease was diagnosed basing on clinical symptoms, histological studies of intestinal specimens and positive serologic tests (EmA, TG2). RESULTS: Classical celiac disease was diagnosed in 40 children (51.3%), atypical celiac disease in 26 children (33.3%) and silent celiac disease in 12 children (15.4%). The most frequent clinical symptoms of classical form of celiac disease were chronic diarrhea (90.0%), recurrent abdominal pain (70.0%), development retardation (65%), hypocholesterolemia (35.0%) and IgA deficiency (22.5%). In atypical form of the disease dominated the following symptoms: recurrent abdominal pain (76.9%), failure to thrive (38.4%), short stature (42.3%), anemia (15.3%), hypertransaminasemia (11.5%), food allergy (19.2%) and thyroid diseases (11.5%). In silent celiac disease hypercholesterolemia was present in 33.3%, hypertriglycerydemia in 16.6%, type 1 diabetes in 50%, and celiac disease in parents or siblings in 33.3%. CONCLUSIONS: Classical celiac disease is the most frequently diagnosed clinical form of the disease. Silent celiac disease occurs frequently in children with type 1 diabetes mellitus whose parents or siblings have celiac disease. Frequent diagnosis of atypical and silent forms of celiac disease is an indication to serological examination in children with unclear clinical picture and genetic predisposition.},

   abstract = {BACKGROUND: Short-chain fatty acids (SCFAs), particularly propionic and butyric acids, have been shown to have many positive health effects. The amount and type of SCFAs formed from dietary fibre by the colonic microbiota depends on the substrate available and is reflected in blood. The total intake and type of dietary fibre in people with gastrointestinal diseases differs considerably from healthy subjects. OBJECTIVE: To compare fasting SCFA concentrations in subjects with microscopic colitis (MC), celiac disease and controls without these diseases. SCFAs were also analysed over 6.5 h in young healthy subjects, who had eaten a fibre-rich breakfast, to identify a possible peak concentration of SCFAs after a meal. METHODS: SCFAs in serum were pre-concentrated using hollow fibre-supported liquid membrane extraction and gas chromatography. RESULTS: The MC group had a higher concentration of valeric acid than the control group (p < 0.01). No significant differences in other SCFA concentrations were seen between groups, but the control group tended to have higher concentration of acetic acid (p = 0.1). Furthermore, males had higher concentrations of SCFAs (with the exception of valeric acid) than females (p < 0.05), which were independent of groups. The peaks for acetic, propionic and butyric acids came approximately 5 h, 6.5 h and 2-3 h, respectively, after breakfast. CONCLUSION: The fasting concentrations of SCFAs were quite similar, although the fibre intake had probably been quite different for a long time. The results might have been different if SCFAs had been recorded over a longer period.},

   abstract = {BACKGROUND: Celiac disease (CD) has emerged as a common, but largely undiagnosed health problem. Numerous studies examined the influence of infant nutrition on the development of diagnosed CD. However, results are still inconsistent. In addition, the effect of infant feeding practices on the development of potential forms of CD might be different. OBJECTIVE: The objective was to examine whether the timing of gluten introduction and breastfeeding duration are associated with CD autoimmunity (CDA) in children at the age of 6 y. DESIGN: This study was embedded in the Generation R Study, a population-based prospective cohort study. Participants included 1679 Dutch children who were positive for human leukocyte antigen (HLA) DQ2/DQ8. Data on the timing of gluten introduction (<6 mo compared with >/=6 mo) and duration of breastfeeding (<6 mo compared with >/=6 mo) were obtained by questionnaire. Serum samples were analyzed for anti-tissue transglutaminase (anti-tTG) concentrations at age 6 y. Anti-tTG concentrations were categorized into negative (<7 U/mL) and positive (>/=7 U/mL) values. Positive anti-tTG concentrations were further categorized based on >/=10 times the upper limit of normal (ULN) values of the test kit (>/=7-70 and >/=70 U/mL). Multivariable logistic regression analyses were performed. RESULTS: Positive anti-tTG concentrations were found in 43 children, 26 of whom had concentrations >/=10 times the ULN (>/=70 IU/mL). The introduction of gluten from the age of 6 mo onward and breastfeeding for >/=6 mo were not significantly associated with positive anti-tTG concentrations. In addition, the timing of gluten introduction and duration of breastfeeding were not significantly associated with positive anti-tTG concentrations below or above 10 times the ULN. CONCLUSIONS: Delayed introduction of gluten beyond the age of 6 mo does not increase the risk of CDA. In addition, breastfeeding for >/=6 mo does not decrease the risk of CDA in children at 6 y of age.},

RESULTS: Nine genes showed altered expression levels in patients with active disease (CLDN2, PARD6A, ZAK, SYMPK, MYH14, and ACTB were upregulated, whereas MAGI1, TJP1, and PPP2R3A were downregulated). Alterations were reversible after 2 years on treatment, except for PPP2R3A, implicated in the negative control of cell growth and division. At the biological network level, important dysfunctions in several processes within the pathway were observed, including intestinal permeability, apicobasal polarity, and cell proliferation. CONCLUSIONS: Our work confirms the involvement of tight junction genes related to permeability, polarity, and cell proliferation in the epithelial destruction observed in CD. Coexpression patterns of several genes support the idea of a common regulatory mechanism that seems to be altered in active CD. In general, GFD normalization confirms the reversibility of the process, except for the constitutive downregulation of PPP2R3A suggestive of a genetic implication. Further studies in proteins and cells or tissues are necessary to confirm these findings.},

   abstract = {OBJECTIVE: Given the social constraints imposed by a gluten-free diet, it can be hypothesized that children with celiac disease (CD) living in the United States have a reduced health-related quality of life (HRQOL); however, there is no validated CD-specific HRQOL instrument for children living in the United States. The goals of this study were to develop and validate a CD-specific HRQOL instrument for children 8 to 18 years of age with CD and to report HRQOL in these children using both generic- and disease-specific instruments. METHODS: This was a prospective study using focus group methodology to develop a CD-specific HRQOL instrument that was then administered to children 8 to 18 years of age with CD living throughout the United States. Instrument validation methods included construct, convergent, and divergent validities. RESULTS: Two instruments were developed: CD-specific pediatric HRQOL instrument (CDPQOL) 8 to 12 and CDPQOL 13 to 18. A total of 181 children with CD completed the CDPQOL as well as a comparator generic instrument. Exploratory factor analysis restructured the CDPQOL and reduced the total number of items. The CDPQOL showed a moderate agreement with the Psychosocial dimensions of the generic instrument confirming convergent validity and low-to-moderate agreement with the Physical Health Summary dimension of the generic instrument confirming divergent validity. CONCLUSIONS: The CDPQOL, consisting of 13 to 17 questions, is a validated instrument for the measurement of HRQOL in children 8 to 18 years of age with CD living in the United States.},

   abstract = {BACKGROUND AND STUDY AIMS: Coeliac autoimmunity (CA) has a known association with type 1 diabetes mellitus (T1DM) for which screening is routinely recommended but less frequently followed. The impact of CA in T1DM has been variably reported. The aims of this study are as follows: (1) to study the prevalence of CA in patients with T1DM and (2) to study the impact of CA not only on nutritional parameters but also on glycaemic control, endocrine axes and bone health. PATIENTS AND METHODS: Eighty-six consecutive patients with T1DM were screened for CA using immunoglobulin A (IgA) tissue transglutaminase as a marker (TTG; IgG anti-gliadin in IgA-deficient case). CA positive (CA+) cases were compared with age-matched and sex-matched CA negative (CA-) T1DM cases for anthropometry, glycaemic control (assessed by glycated haemoglobin (HbA1c) and hypoglycaemic/hyperglycaemic episodes), endocrine (thyroid function, cortisol, growth hormone (GH) axis, gonadal axes), haematological (haemoglobin, iron profile and vitamin B12 status) and calcium metabolism parameters and bone densitometry (by dual-energy X-ray absorptiometry (DXA)). Consenting patients with CA also underwent upper gastrointestinal (GI) endoscopy with duodenal biopsy. RESULTS: Out of 86 patients, 11 (12.75%) screened positive for CA (seven patients underwent duodenal biopsies which were suggestive of Marsh grade III(2), II(3) and I(2) disease). The CA+ T1DM patients were comparable with CA- T1DM in terms of anthropometry. CA+ patients had higher HbA1c (10.7+/-1.8 vs. 8.4+/-1.0 (93+/-19 vs. 68+/-11 mmol/mol); p<0.01), more hypoglycaemic episodes (five vs. two; p<0.05), higher prevalence of iron and vitamin B12 deficiency, lower insulin-like growth factor-1 (IGF-1) levels and lower bone mineral density (BMD) z-score at total body (-1.91+/-1.05 vs. -0.63+/-0.73; p<0.05) and lumbar spine (-1.69+/-0.92 vs. -0.36+/-0.93; p<0.05). The incidence of fractures in the past 3years was also more in CA+ patients than in CA- patients (four vs. one; p<0.05). CONCLUSION: CA has an important autoimmune association with T1DM. The concomitant presence of CA adversely affects stature, bone health, glycaemic control and iron and B12 levels in T1DM. IgA sufficiency should be ensured before using an IgA-based screening test for CA.},

   abstract = {BACKGROUND & AIMS: We investigated whether risk for non-insulin-dependent diabetes mellitus (NIDDM) and metabolic syndrome are affected by celiac disease. We examined the prevalence of NIDDM and metabolic syndrome among adults with celiac disease, compared with matched controls. METHODS: We assessed medical records of 840 patients with biopsy-proven celiac disease for diagnoses of NIDDM, hypertension, or hyperlipidemia; body mass index (BMI); lipid profile; and levels of glucose or glycosylated hemoglobin, to identify those with metabolic syndrome. Patients without celiac disease were matched for age, sex, and ethnicity (n = 840 controls). The prevalence of NIDDM and metabolic syndrome in the celiac disease cohort was compared with that of the controls and subjects included in the National Health and Nutrition Examination Survey. RESULTS: Twenty-six patients with celiac disease (3.1%) had NIDDM compared with 81 controls (9.6%) (P < .0001). Similarly, the prevalence of metabolic syndrome was significantly lower among patients with celiac disease than controls (3.5% vs 12.7%; P < .0001). The mean BMI of patients with celiac disease was significantly lower than that of controls (24.7 vs 27.5; P < .0001). However, celiac disease was still associated with a lower risk of NIDDM, after controlling for BMI. CONCLUSIONS: The prevalence of NIDDM and metabolic syndrome are lower among patients with celiac disease than in matched controls and the general population. These differences are not explained by differences in BMI. Studies are needed to determine the mechanisms by which celiac disease affects the risk for NIDDM and metabolic syndrome.},

   abstract = {OBJECTIVES: Differentiating between celiac disease (CD) and non-celiac gluten sensitivity (NCGS) is important for appropriate management but is often challenging. METHODS: We retrospectively reviewed records from 238 patients who presented for the evaluation of symptoms responsive to gluten restriction without prior diagnosis or exclusion of CD. Demographics, presenting symptoms, serologic, genetic, and histologic data, nutrient deficiencies, personal history of autoimmune diseases, and family history of CD were recorded. NCGS was defined as symptoms responsive to a gluten-free diet (GFD) in the setting of negative celiac serology and duodenal biopsies while on a gluten-containing diet or negative human leukocyte antigen (HLA) DQ2/DQ8 testing. RESULTS: Of the 238 study subjects, 101 had CD, 125 had NCGS, 9 had non-celiac enteropathy, and 3 had indeterminate diagnosis. CD subjects presented with symptoms of malabsorption 67.3% of the time compared with 24.8% of the NCGS subjects (P<0.0001). In addition, CD subjects were significantly more likely to have a family history of CD (P=0.004), personal history of autoimmune diseases (P=0.002), or nutrient deficiencies (P<0.0001). The positive likelihood ratio for diagnosis of CD of a >2x upper limit of normal IgA trans-glutaminase antibody (tTG) or IgA/IgG deaminated gliadan peptide antibody (DGP) with clinical response to GFD was 130 (confidence interval (CI): 18.5-918.3). The positive likelihood ratio of the combination of gluten-responsive symptoms and negative IgA tTG or IgA/IgG DGP on a regular diet for NCGS was 9.6 (CI: 5.5-16.9). When individuals with negative IgA tTG or IgA/IgG DGP also lacked symptoms of malabsorption (weight loss, diarrhea, and nutrient deficiencies) and CD risk factors (personal history of autoimmune diseases and family history of CD), the positive likelihood ratio for NCGS increased to 80.9. CONCLUSIONS: On the basis of our findings, we have developed a diagnostic algorithm to differentiate CD from NCGS. Subjects with negative celiac serologies (IgA tTG or IgA/IgG DGP) on a regular diet are unlikely to have CD. Those with negative serology who also lack clinical evidence of malabsorption and CD risk factors are highly likely to have NCGS and may not require further testing. Those with equivocal serology should undergo HLA typing to determine the need for biopsy.},

   abstract = {OBJECTIVES: To evaluate the markers of lymphocyte activation (sIL-2R, IL-6 and TNF alpha) in the peripheral blood of newly diagnosed patients with celiac disease (CD) and patients with CD on Gluten free diet (GFD) for at least 2 y. The markers were correlated with conventional serological tests Anti-tissue transglutaminase (Anti-TTG) used for diagnosis and follow up of the disease; wherever possible. METHODS: Thirty newly diagnosed cases of CD (on the basis of histopathology and serology) not on GFD were enrolled as Group 1 of the study. Thirty age and sex matched controls from the Pediatric Surgery OPD formed Group 2. Thirty cases of CD on GFD for at least 2 y (Group 3) were also enrolled in the study. Upper G.I. endoscopy was performed in all Group 1 patients and cytokine levels assayed by ELISA on serum obtained from all patients in Groups 1, 2, 3. RESULTS: Mean sIL-2R level in Group 1(1498.1+/-1234.31 pg/ml) and Group 3 (488.78+/-396.18 pg/ml) were significantly higher than the controls (336.27+/-218.67 pg/ml p < 0.05). Among the patients with CD, mean serum levels in Group 1 were higher than in Group 3 (p < 0.05). sIL-2R levels showed good correlation with tTg levels in Group 1 patients (p < 0.000, r = 0.69). Mean IL-6 levels in Group 1 were significantly higher (28.43+/-28.32 pg/ml) than Group 2(15.03+/-7.72 pg/ml p < 0.05) and Group 3(11.26+/-5.13 pg/ml p < 0.05). IL-6 levels were comparable between Groups 2 and 3 (p > 0.05).IL-6 levels showed good correlation with tTg levels in Group 1(p < 0.008, r = 0.471). Mean TNFalpha levels in Group 1(179.66+/-102.93 pg/ml), Group 2 (153.16+/-27.02 pg/ml) and Group 3 (166.67+/-28.95 pg/ml) were comparable (p > 0.05). TNFalpha levels showed poor correlation with tTg levels in Group 1 patients (p > 0.604, r = -0.099). CONCLUSIONS: sIL-2R and IL-6 levels have a good correlation with CD activity and can be used as reliable markers for detecting minimal transgression from GFD.},

METHODS: The project consists of two parts: (i) a pilot study of preschool children aged 2-6 years to test the feasibility and diagnostic accuracy of community-based screening and (ii) a CD prevalence study, by random clustered sampling and proportionate stratification of various geographical areas in Greece. Trained nonmedical staff performed a rapid immunochromatographic test to detect IgA antibodies to tTG-IgA and IgA deficiency. Toddlers with positive results were referred to a paediatric gastroenterologist for further assessment with serum anti-tTG IgA and EMA-IgA. Children with positive serum anti-tTG and anti-EMA underwent upper gastrointestinal tract endoscopy and small bowel biopsy and were subsequently in gluten-free diet. RESULTS: In this project participated 1136 toddlers, who were tested at school. The prevalence of positive rapid anti-tTG screening was 1:154, of IgA deficiency 1:120 and of biopsy-proven CD 1:154. The prevalence of CD from this pilot study served as expected prevalence value for sample size calculation for the main prevalence study. CONCLUSION: This protocol using rapid immunochromatographic test for the detection of both IgA deficiency and CD is easy to be performed by nonmedical staff in a community setting, enabling the accurate identification of new CD cases among asymptomatic population.},

The aim of the present study was to examine the frequency of scalloping in pediatric patients undergoing EGD and to assess its significance in the diagnosis of CD. We also evaluated the association of scalloping with the histopathology and celiac serology in the subgroup of celiac patients. PATIENTS AND METHODS: All children (0-18 years) who underwent EGD at Shaare Zedek Medical Center for any reason during a 2.5-year period were retrospectively included, yielding a consecutive cohort without selection bias. Relevant data were obtained from the patient files. RESULTS: During the study period, 623 children underwent EGD of whom 149 (24%) were eventually diagnosed with CD. In 74/623children (12%), scalloping was seen and had a sensitivity of 48% (95% CI 0.40-0.57), specificity of 99% (0.98-0.99) and positive predictive value of 97% (0.9-0.99) to diagnose CD. The prevalence of scalloping increased with advancing stage of the Marsh classification from 33% (7/21) in Marsh 1 to 63% (34/54) in Marsh 3c (P < 0.001). Scalloping was associated with a significantly higher median tissue transglutaminase level (153 [IQR 98-168] versus 49 [IQR 11-143]; P = 0.011). CONCLUSION: The results suggest that the diagnosis of CD is almost certain if isolated scalloping is observed during EGD done to rule out CD. Thus, attention to this finding may serve as an additional tool in the diagnosis of CD.},

   abstract = {Celiac disease (CD) is a multifactorial, inflammatory small bowel disorder characterized by nutrient malabsorption resulting from mucosal damage, the latter induced by cereal products like barley, oat, and wheat. Oxidative stress has previously been reported to play an important role in the pathogenesis of CD. In the present study, we aimed to evaluate the frequency of polymorphisms that affects the structure of the enzymes superoxide dismutase (SOD) and glutathione peroxidase (GSH-Px), with levels being dependent on the amount of oxidative stress and whether or not there is an association with the mutations DQA1*0501, DQB1*0201, and DRB1*04 that are frequently reported for CD. SOD and GSH-Px polymorphisms were investigated by real-time quantitative polymerase chain reaction in 265 cases. Of the 117 cases that had at least one of DQA1*0501, DQB1*0201, or DRB1*04, 98 (83.75%) also had SOD enzyme polymorphisms and 68 (58.12%) also had GSH-Px polymorphisms. In conclusion, although the etiology of CD is not yet entirely clear, many mechanisms have been suggested. This study supports the notion that SOD and GSH-Px polymorphisms are involved in CD development, even though our findings were not statistically significant, and, furthermore, are influenced at various levels. SOD polymorphisms and activities were more frequently identified than those of GSH-Px.},

   abstract = {Many celiac disease patients tolerate oats, but limited data are available on its long-term consumption. This was evaluated in the present study, focusing on small-bowel mucosal histology and gastrointestinal symptoms in celiac adults maintaining a strict gluten-free diet with or without oats. Altogether 106 long-term treated celiac adults were enrolled for this cross-sectional follow-up study. Daily consumption of oats and fiber was assessed, and small-bowel mucosal morphology and densities of CD3+, alphabeta+ and gammasigma+ intraepithelial lymphocytes determined. Gastrointestinal symptoms were assessed by a validated Gastrointestinal Symptom Rating Scale questionnaire. Seventy (66%) out of the 106 treated celiac disease patients had consumed a median of 20 g of oats (range 1-100 g) per day for up to eight years; all consumed oat products bought from general stores. Daily intake and long-term consumption of oats did not result in small-bowel mucosal villous damage, inflammation, or gastrointestinal symptoms. Oat-consumers had a significantly higher daily intake of fiber than those who did not use oats. Two thirds of celiac disease patients preferred to use oats in their daily diet. Even long-term ingestion of oats had no harmful effects.},

   abstract = {BACKGROUND: Food habits, nutrient needs and intakes differ between males and females, although few nutritional studies on patients with coeliac disease (CD) have reported results stratified by gender. OBJECTIVES: To compare energy and nutrient intakes among 13-year olds diagnosed with CD in early childhood with those of a non-coeliac (NC) age- and gender-matched control group, and also with estimated average requirements (EAR). METHODS: A case-control study was conducted in Sweden 2006-2007 within the coeliac screening study ETICS (Exploring The Iceberg of Coeliacs in Sweden). Dietary intake was assessed among 37 adolescents (23 girls) diagnosed with CD at median age 1.7 years (CD group) and 805 (430 girls) NC controls (NC group) using a food-frequency questionnaire covering 4 weeks. Reported energy intake was validated by comparison with the calculated physical activity level (PAL). RESULTS: Regardless of CD status, most adolescents reported an intake above EAR for most nutrients. However, both groups had a low intake of vitamin C, with 13% in the CD-group and 25% in the NC-group below EAR, and 21% of boys in the CD-group below EAR for thiamine. The intake of fatty acids was unbalanced, with a high intake of saturated and a low intake of unsaturated fats. Girls and boys in the CD-group had an overall lower nutrient density in reported food intake compared to girls and boys in the NC-group. CONCLUSIONS: Nutrient intake of adolescent girls and boys with CD was mostly comparable to intakes of NC controls. Dietitians should take the opportunity to reinforce a generally healthy diet when providing information about the gluten-free diet.},

   abstract = {A dietary survey was performed during a large screening study in Sweden among 13-year-old adolescents. The aim was to study how the intake of food groups was affected by a screening-detected diagnosis of coeliac disease (CD) and its gluten-free (GF) treatment. Food intake was reported using a FFQ, and intake reported by the adolescents who were diagnosed with CD was compared with the intake of two same-aged referent groups: (i) adolescents diagnosed with CD prior to screening; and (ii) adolescents without CD. The food intake groups were measured at baseline before the screening-detected cases were aware of their CD, and 12-18 months later. The results showed that food intakes were affected by screen-detected CD and its dietary treatment. Many flour-based foods were reduced such as pizza, fish fingers and pastries. The results also indicated that bread intake was lower before the screened diagnosis compared with the other studied groups, but increased afterwards. Specially manufactured GF products (for example, pasta and bread) were frequently used in the screened CD group after changing to a GF diet. The present results suggest that changing to a GF diet reduces the intake of some popular foods, and the ingredients on the plate are altered, but this do not necessarily include a change of food groups. The availability of manufactured GF replacement products makes it possible for adolescents to keep many of their old food habits when diagnosed with CD in Sweden.},

   abstract = {BACKGROUND: While anemia occurs in 80 % to 90 % of patients with celiac disease (CD), it may be the sole manifestation of CD. The prevalence of CD in Indian patients with nutritional anemia is not known. PATIENTS AND METHODS: Adolescent and adult patients presenting with nutritional anemia were prospectively screened for CD using IgA anti-tissue transglutaminase antibody (anti-tTG Ab) followed, if positive, by upper gastrointestinal endoscopy and duodenal biopsy. RESULTS: Ninety-six patients [mean +/- SD age 32.1 +/- 13.1 years and median duration of anemia 11 months (range 1 to 144 months)] were screened. Of these patients, 80 had iron deficiency anemia, 11 had megaloblastic anemia, and 5 had dimorphic anemia. Seventy-three patients were on hematinics and 36.4 % had received blood transfusions. Nineteen had a history of chronic diarrhea and the mean +/- SD duration of diarrhea in them was 9.7 +/- 35.8 months. IgA anti-tTG Ab was positive in 13 patients, of whom 12 agreed to undergo duodenal biopsy. Ten patients had villous atrophy (Marsh grade 3a in three, 3b in one, and 3c in six) and two did not. Thus, 10 patients with nutritional anemia (iron deficiency 9, vitamin B12 deficiency 1) were diagnosed to have CD. On multivariate logistic regression, age, duration of symptoms, and presence of diarrhea were found to be the predictors of CD. All the patients with CD were put on gluten-free diet and with iron and vitamin supplementations and showed a significant improvement in hemoglobin concentration. CONCLUSIONS: CD screening should be included in the work up of otherwise unexplained nutritional anemia.},

H. pylori associated LG (HpLG) has more enhanced cytotoxic and apoptotic tendencies than chronic H. pylori gastritis. A 12-year-old girl with postprandial epigastric pain was diagnosed HpLG on endoscopic biopsy. After the 1st eradication therapy, H. pylori bacilli were still found, and urea breathing test was positive. Although the endoscopic finding was partially improved, clinical symptoms and histologic finding were persisted. We could achieve the improvement of clinical symptoms and disappearance of IELs after the 2nd eradication. The discordant of histopathologic and endoscopic improvement occurred after the 1st eradication therapy of HpLG. Therefore the clinical and histopathologic evaluation should be considered as well as endoscopic findings.},

METHODS: We performed a retrospective review of all of the patients suspected of having CD who had undergone a small bowel biopsy in our gastroenterology unit. All symptomatic children with serological marker at time of biopsy (immunoglobulin A-tissue transglutaminase antibody, endomysial antibody, and HLA genotype) were included. The triple test (TT) was positive if immunoglobulin A-tissue transglutaminase antibody was 10 times the upper limit of normal, plus positive endomysial antibody plus human leukocyte antigen-DQ2/DQ8. RESULTS: A total of 150 patients met the inclusion criteria and were enrolled in the study. One hundred sixteen were positive for the TT; 113 of 116 (97.4%) had a Marsh 2/3 histological lesion and had been considered to have CD. Thus, positive predictive value of the TT was 97.4%. The other 3 cases (2.6%) had Marsh 0/1 lesion, so we consider them to be false-positives for the TT; however, on follow-up, all 3 children developed histological damage after a gluten challenge. Finally, the positive predictive value of the TT was 100%. Thirty-four patients were negative for the TT: 22 patients are celiac, 3 are celiac but challenge gluten diet is pending, and the 9 patients left have other gastrointestinal disorder. CONCLUSIONS: Our study supports the view that in selected children who are symptomatic and positive for the TT, CD diagnosis could be established independent of histological findings.},

   abstract = {Celiac disease (CD) is strongly associated with HLA-DQ2 and HLA-DQ8, HLA-class II molecules that present antigen-derived peptides to CD4 T cells. Indeed, proinflammatory CD4 T cells specific for gluten-derived peptides bound to HLA-DQ2 or HLA-DQ8 are present in the lamina propria of patients, and not found in nonceliac controls. While gluten peptides bind poorly to HLA-DQ2/8, modification by tissue tranglutaminase converts the neutral amino acid glutamine into glutamic acid, introducing a negative charge that allows high affinity binding. Thus, the association between CD and HLA-DQ2/8 is well understood. What is less clear is why only a small minority of HLA-DQ2/8 positive individuals develops CD, why disease can develop at any stage in life and present with highly variable symptoms. I discuss this in the framework of the multiple hit model: next to genetic predisposition, multiple other factors-some extrinsic, some intrinsic-can favour or protect from disease development.},

   abstract = {Celiac disease (CD) is triggered by the consumption of gluten-containing cereals to which patients mount a T-lymphocyte and antibody response in both immunoglobulin A and immunoglobulin G classes coupled with autoantibody production against self-proteins, predominantly type-2 (tissue) transglutaminase (TG2). TG2 autoantibodies are biologically active and bind to their target protein in the patients' tissues, including the gut and extraintestinal tissues. This peculiar systemic anti-TG2 reaction is dependent on the presence of dietary gluten and stops after its elimination. As both anti-TG2 and anti-gliadin antibodies are activity markers, their detection is valuable for the disease recognition and therapy monitoring. High concentrations of serum anti-TG2 antibody positivity supported by highly specific positivity for endomysial antibodies became the critical component of celiac disease diagnosis, although serum antibodies as indirect markers have limitations and are not able to replace histology analysis in all cases. Studies focusing on tissue-bound antibodies may further improve our understanding of their role.},

The etiology of pathologic bone alterations in CD is multifactorial; however, two main mechanisms are involved: intestinal malabsorption and chronic inflammation. A strict gluten-free diet (GFD) is thought to be the only effective treatment for CD; but treating bone complications related to CD remains complex. The objective of this review is to elucidate the bones problems related to CD and to increase awareness of osteoporosis development, considered as a sign of atypical CD presentation. Currently, a question of whether GFD alone is an effective treatment to correct the bone alterations in patients with CD is under debate. This review presents factors contributing to pathologic bone derangement, recent research on the epidemiology of low BMD, osteoporosis, and fractures, and the treatment of bone problems in patients with CD. The roles of calcium and transport mechanisms are additionally presented.},

Particular attention should be paid to typical dental enamel defects with a various degree of advancement: discolorations, horizontal groves and pits, and even significant structural destruction causing the change of the dental crown. Symmetric location of defects within all dentition sections, and within the same anatomic groups of teeth (the most frequently: incisors and first permanent molars), is specific for celiac disease. The changes described above may be the only manifestation of celiac disease; therefore, in the case of their occurrence further studies towards gluten intolerance are recommended even when other symptoms are not present. In celiac patients, recurrent aphthae and other disorders of the oral mucosa such as ulceration, erythema, atrophic glossitis, as well as dryness and a burning sensation (particularly of the tongue) may be present, which may be caused by malnutrition. Delayed tooth eruption may also be a consequence of alimentary deficiency in celiac disease.},

   abstract = {BACKGROUND: Common marmosets (Callithrix jacchus) are susceptible to gastrointestinal diseases. Sensitivity to nutritional elements, for example gluten, has been suggested, but a serological screening has not been performed yet. METHODS: A gluten-containing diet was offered to 24 animals, followed by a gluten-free diet. During these diets, serum IgA antibodies to gliadin (AGA), tissue transglutaminase (tTG), deamidated gliadin (ADGA), and glycoprotein 2 (AGP2A) were determined. Body weight, diarrhea, and other clinical symptoms were recorded. RESULTS: Gluten increased AGA, tTG, and AGP2A concentrations in 13 of 24 animals. A significant decline of AGA and AGP2A was seen on gluten withdrawal. Positive (AGA, tTG) animals presented diarrhea more frequently on gluten-containing diet and showed significantly increased body weight on gluten-free diet compared to negative animals. CONCLUSION: Gluten ingestion caused gastrointestinal symptoms in common marmosets, which disappeared on gluten withdrawal. Considering the immunological response to both diets, gluten sensitivity seems to be most likely.},

   abstract = {Kafirin is a natural, hydrophobic and celiac safe prolamin protein obtained from sorghum seeds. Today kafirin is found to be useful in designing delayed delivery systems and coatings of pharmaceuticals and nutraceuticals where its purity is important and this can be obtained by adsorptive chromatography. This study is the first scientific insight into the isotherm and kinetic studies of kafirin adsorption on anion- and cation-exchange resins for practical applications in preparative scale chromatography. Adsorption isotherms of kafirin were determined for five anion- and two cation-exchange resins in batch systems. Isotherm parameters such as maximum binding capacity and dissociation constant were determined from Langmuir isotherm, and adsorptive capacity and affinity constant from Freundlich isotherm. Langmuir isotherm was found to fit the adsorption equilibrium data well. Batch uptake kinetics for kafirin adsorption on these resins was also carried out and critical parameters including the diffusion coefficient, film mass transfer coefficient, and Biot number for film-pore diffusion model were calculated. Both the isotherm and the kinetic parameters were considered for selection of appropriate resin for kafirin purification. UNOsphere Q (78.26 mg/ml) and Toyopearl SP-650M (57.4 mg/ml) were found to offer better kafirin binding capacities and interaction strength with excellent uptake kinetics under moderate operating conditions. With these adsorbents, film diffusion resistance was found to be major governing factor for adsorption (Bi<10 and delta<1). Based on designer objective function, UNOsphere Q was found be best adsorbent for binding of kafirin. The data presented is valuable for designing large scale preparative adsorptive chromatographic kafirin purification systems.},

   abstract = {Avoiding exposure to gluten is currently the only effective treatment for celiac disease. However, the evidence suggests that for most affected individuals, exposure to less than 10 mg/day is unlikely to cause histological changes to the intestinal mucosa. The daily diet of people with celiac disease does not rely solely on gluten-free pre-packaged foods, but also on naturally gluten-free grains (e.g., rice, buckwheat, ...) and foods with grain-derived ingredients (i.e., flour and starches) used for cooking and baking at home. The objective of this study was to estimate the level of incidental gluten potentially present in gluten-free diets from a Canadian perspective. We have conducted gluten exposure estimations from grain-containing foods and foods with grain-derived ingredients, taking into consideration the various rates of food consumption by different sex and age groups. These estimates have concluded that if gluten was present at levels not exceeding 20 ppm, exposure to gluten would remain below 10 mg per day for all age groups studied. However, in reality the level of gluten found in naturally gluten-free ingredients is not static and there may be some concerns related to the flours made from naturally gluten-free cereal grains. It was found that those containing a higher level of fiber and that are frequently used to prepare daily foods by individuals with celiac disease could be a concern. For this category of products, only the flours and starches labelled "gluten-free" should be used for home-made preparations.},

   abstract = {The gluten-free diet is, to date, the only efficacious treatment for patients with Celiac Disease. In recent years, the impressive rise of Celiac Disease incidence, dramatically prompted changes in the dietary habit of an increasingly large population, with a rise in demand of gluten-free products. The formulation of gluten-free bakery products presents a formidable challenge to cereal technologists. As wheat gluten contributes to the formation of a strong protein network, that confers visco-elasticity to the dough and allows the wheat flour to be processed into a wide range of products, the preparation of cereal-based gluten-free products is a somehow difficult process. This review focuses on nutritional and technological quality of products made with gluten-free cereals available on the market. The possibility of using flour from naturally low toxic ancient wheat species or detoxified wheat for the diet of celiacs is also discussed.},

The present study evaluates the effects of the oral administration of Bifidobacterium longum CECT 7347 on gliadin-mediated alterations in hepatic Fe deposition and Hb concentration, liver transferrin receptor (TfR)-2, IL-6, TNF-alpha and hepcidin (Hamp) expression (mRNA), and active hepcidin peptide production by liquid chromatography-MS/MS. Weanling rats, sensitised or not with interferon (IFN)-gamma, were fed with gliadins and/or the bifidobacterial strain. Gliadin feeding increased hepatic Fe deposition; however, only gliadin-fed sensitised animals showed lower Hb concentrations than the controls. TfR2 expression decreased after gliadins were fed to both sensitised and non-sensitised animals,and restored by the administration of B. longum. These observations were accompanied by increases in IL-6 expression levels in all the treatment groups; however, TNF-alpha expression only increased significantly in animals fed gliadins alone or together with B. longum if they had previously been sensitised with IFN-gamma. Liver expression levels of Hamp diminished in all cases to the lowest values in animals sensitised with IFN-gamma after being fed with gliadins and/or bifidobacteria. In these animals, plasma Hamp active peptide concentrations significantly increased when compared with the controls. Significant correlations were calculated between Hamp expression and liver Fe contents (liver Fe = 1/0.0032 + 0.032 x Hamp(exp)), and Hb concentrations (Hb = 11.49 + 10.13 x (Hamp(exp))1/2). These data indicate that oral administration of B. longum ameliorates gliadin-mediated perturbations in liver Fe deposition and mobilisation.},

   abstract = {BACKGROUND: Chronic non-bloody diarrhoea affects up to 5% of the population. Microscopic colitis is one of the most common causes, encompassing the subtypes collagenous colitis and lymphocytic colitis. The diagnosis of microscopic colitis is made by histological examination of colonic mucosal biopsy specimens. The aim of this investigation was to determine whether laboratory parameters or questions about disease history or concomitant disease could be helpful in discriminating patients with MC from those with a histologically normal colonic mucosa. FINDINGS: Patients admitted for colonoscopy because of chronic non-bloody diarrhoea (>2 loose stools for >3 weeks) at endoscopy units in Malmo during 2007 and 2009, were enrolled. A total number of 78 patients were included (60 women, 18 men, median age 59, IQR 45-69 years). Out of these 78, 15 patients (19%) had microscopic colitis (CC; n = 10, LC; n = 5). MC was especially prevalent in patients above the age of 50 (25%). No differences were found between those with normal histology and MC in laboratory analyses (inflammatory and liver parameters). Neither were differences shown in questions regarding symptoms, environmental factors or concomitant diseases except for an association with celiac disease (p = 0.019) and a trend maybe indicating an inverse association with appendectomy (p = 0.057). CONCLUSIONS: Microscopic colitis is associated with female gender, celiac disease and consumption of NSAIDs. Trends were observed indicating that age above 50 years, acute onset and absence of appendectomy may be associated with MC. No associations were observed with other symptoms, calprotectin levels or liver parameters.},

   abstract = {OBJECTIVE: Celiac disease is associated with decreased bone density; however, the risk of fractures in celiac disease patients is unclear. We compared the prevalence of celiac disease between a group of women with hip fractures and a group of women undergoing elective joint replacement surgery and the association between celiac disease and vitamin D levels. METHODS: Two hundred eight community dwelling and postmenopausal women were recruited from Boston, MA (n=81) and Baltimore, MD (n=127). We measured tissue transglutaminase IgA by ELISA to diagnose celiac disease and 25-hydroxyvitamin D (25(OH)D) levels by radioimmunoassay in both women with hip fractures (n=157) and a control group (n=51) of total hip replacement subjects from Boston. Subjects were excluded if they took any medications or had medical conditions that might affect bone. RESULTS: Median serum 25(OH)D levels were significantly lower (p< 0.0001) in the hip fracture cohorts compared to the elective joint replacement cohort (14.1 ng/ml vs. 21.3 ng/ml, respectively). There were no differences in the percentage of subjects with a positive tissue transglutaminase in the women with hip fractures versus the control group (1.91% vs. 1.96%, respectively). CONCLUSION: Vitamin D levels are markedly reduced in women with hip fractures, however hip fracture patients did not show a higher percentage of positive tissue transglutaminase levels compared with controls. These data suggest that routine testing for celiac disease among hip fracture patients may not be necessary in the absence of clinical signs and symptoms, although data from larger studies among hip fracture subjects are needed.},

Potential CD (positive serology but normal duodenal biopsy) is associated with neuropathy but patients with coexisting Type 1 diabetes were excluded. The aim was to determine whether potential CD is associated with increased microvascular complications in patients with Type 1 diabetes. METHODS AND RESULTS: Four groups were recruited; 1) patients with Type 1 diabetes and potential CD, 2) patients with Type 1 diabetes and newly identified CD, 3) patients with Type 1 diabetes alone and 4) patients with CD alone. Glycaemic control, quality of life, lipid profile and microvascular complication rates were examined. As many as 76 individuals were included in the study: 22 in group 1, 14 in group 2, 24 in group 3 and 16 in group 4. There were no differences in age, gender, BMI and diabetes duration between the groups. Patients in group 1 had significantly lower total cholesterol compared to group 3 (p = 0.003) but higher than group 2 (p = 0.027). There were no significant differences in HbA1c, HDL cholesterol, cholesterol:HDL ratio, creatinine, quality of life scores or prevalence of neuropathy between individuals in group 1 and the other groups. CONCLUSIONS: This is the first study to assess the effects of potential CD in patients with Type 1 diabetes. It appears that an enteropathy is required as well as antibody positivity in order to increase the risk of diabetes related complications. This pilot data requires further longitudinal validation.},

There are few published studies describing the occurrence of RFS in children. We describe two cases of RFS in children. The first case is a boy with unrecognised coeliac disease and second case is a girl with cerebral palsy. In both cases, the RFS has developed without clinical symptoms and it was shown only through laboratory findings. Electrolyte disturbances have been successfully corrected and treatment of the underlying disease continued.},

   abstract = {The association between coeliac disease and type 1 diabetes has long been established. The combination of genetic susceptibility along with a potential role for gluten in the pathogenesis of autoimmunity makes defining gluten's role in type 1 diabetes extremely important. Evidence supporting the role of a gluten-free diet to improve complications associated with type 1 diabetes is not robust. However there is evidence to support improved growth, bone density and potentially the prevention of additional autoimmune diseases in patients with coeliac disease and type 1 diabetes. The gluten free diet is expensive and challenging to adhere to in people already on a modified diet. Early identification of those who have coeliac disease and would benefit from a gluten-free diet is of utmost importance to prevent complications associated with type 1 diabetes and coeliac disease.},

   abstract = {The prevalence of celiac disease (CD) is increasing. Despite an increased awareness and an improvement in diagnostic testing, the majority of individuals with CD remain undiagnosed. Currently, genetic testing in screening for CD is used only to exclude a diagnosis or reinforce a strong clinical suspicion. In this paper, we review the most current literature regarding genetic testing in CD. In response to important data revealing that an individual's HLA haplotype is one of the strongest known predictors of CD, we propose genetic screening for at-risk infants to stratify individuals based on genetic risk to ultimately create genetic specific screening algorithms.},

   abstract = {BACKGROUND: Celiac disease is a life-long autoimmune condition, affecting genetically susceptible individuals that may present with thromboembolic phenomena. This thrombophilia represents a puzzle with multiple constituents: hyperhomocysteinemia, B12 and\or folate deficiency, methylenetetrahydrofolate reductase mutations, and protein C and S deficiency due to vitamin K deficiency. However, the well known thrombogenic factors, antiphosphatidylserine/prothrombin and antiprothrombin have never been explored in celiac disease. METHODS: The serum autoantibody levels were determined in 248 individuals, classified into three groups. Group 1 comprised 70 children with definitive celiac disease (age: 7.04 +/-4.3 years, male to female ratio 1.06) and group 2 comprised 88 normal children (age: 6.7 +/-4.17 years, male to female ratio 0.87), representing controls. The pediatric populations were compared to group 3, which included 90 adults who were family members (parents) of group 1 (age: 34.6 +/-11.35 years, male to female ratio 1.2). Antibodies were checked by enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay. RESULTS: Mean optical density levels of serum antiphosphatidylserine/prothrombin immunoglobulin G antibodies were 32.4 +/-19.4, 3.6 +/-2.5 and 16.1 +/-15.8 absorbance units in groups 1, 2 and 3 respectively (P <0.0001), with 45.7%, 0% and 7.8% of groups 1, 2 and 3 respectively positive for the antibody (P <0.01). Mean optical density levels of serum antiphosphatidylserine/prothrombin immunoglobulin M antibodies were 14.2 +/-8.7, 6.7 +/-6.4 and 12.4 +/-15.5 absorbance units in groups 1, 2 and 3 respectively (P <0.0001), with 7.1%, 3.4% and 9.9% of groups 1, 2 and 3 positive for the antibody. Mean optical density levels of serum antiprothrombin and antiphospholipid immunoglobulin G antibodies were higher in groups 1 and 3 compared with 2 (P <0.005) and in groups 1 and 2 compared with 3 (P <0.01), respectively. Groups 1, 2 and 3 were positive for antiphospholipid immunoglobulin G antibodies (groups 1 and 2 compared with 3) . Celiac disease sera harbor a higher antiprothrombin immunoglobulin G level compared with controls. CONCLUSIONS: It is suggested that the intestinal injury, endothelial dysfunction, platelet abnormality and enhanced apoptosis recently described in celiac disease are at the origin of the increased exposure of phospholipids or new epitopes representing autoantigens. Those autoantibodies might play a pathogenic role in the thrombophilia associated with celiac disease and represent markers for potential anticoagulant preventive therapy.},

One of the extra intestinal manifestations of the disease is thromboembolic events like strokes, veins' thrombosis, and pregnancy losses. Hypercoagulable autoimmune diseases like lupus erythematosus and antiphospholipid syndrome, associated with celiac disease just add risk to the patients. Pathogenic predisposing avenues increasing the hypercoagulability in celiac disease are multiple: nutritional deficiencies (B12, folate, and vitamin K), genetic predisposition (MTHFR mutations), thrombophilic autoantibodies, hyperhomocysinemia, endothelial dysfunction and platelet abnormalities. Primary pharmacologic thromboprophylaxis or treating the predisposing factors should be considered on a personal basis.},

   abstract = {BACKGROUND: Mild impairments of cognition or 'Brain fog' are often reported by patients with coeliac disease but the nature of these impairments has not been systematically investigated. AIM: This longitudinal pilot study investigated relationships between cognitive function and mucosal healing in people with newly diagnosed coeliac disease commencing a gluten-free diet. METHODS: Eleven patients (8 females, 3 males), mean age 30 (range 22-39) years, were tested with a battery of cognitive tests at weeks 0, 12 and 52. Information processing efficacy, memory, visuospatial ability, motoric function and attention were tested. Small bowel biopsies were collected via routine gastroscopy at weeks 12 and 52 and were compared to baseline Marsh scores. Cognitive performance was compared to serum concentrations of tissue transglutaminase antibodies, biopsy outcomes and other biological markers. RESULTS: All patients had excellent adherence to the diet. Marsh scores improved significantly (P = 0.001, Friedman's test) and tissue transglutaminase antibody concentrations decreased from a mean of 58.4 at baseline to 16.8 U/mL at week 52 (P = 0.025). Four of the cognitive tests assessing verbal fluency, attention and motoric function showed significant improvement over the 12 months and strongly correlated with the Marsh scores and tissue transglutaminase antibody levels (r = 0.377-0.735; all P < 0.05). However, no meaningful patterns of correlations were found for nutritional or biochemical markers, or markers of intestinal permeability. CONCLUSIONS: In newly diagnosed coeliac disease, cognitive performance improves with adherence to the gluten-free diet in parallel to mucosal healing. Suboptimal levels of cognition in untreated coeliac disease may affect the performance of everyday tasks.},

   abstract = {BACKGROUND: The relationship between the risk of celiac disease and both the age at which gluten is introduced to a child's diet and a child's early dietary pattern is unclear. METHODS: We randomly assigned 832 newborns who had a first-degree relative with celiac disease to the introduction of dietary gluten at 6 months (group A) or 12 months (group B). The HLA genotype was determined at 15 months of age, and serologic screening for celiac disease was evaluated at 15, 24, and 36 months and at 5, 8, and 10 years. Patients with positive serologic findings underwent intestinal biopsies. The primary outcome was the prevalence of celiac disease autoimmunity and of overt celiac disease among the children at 5 years of age. RESULTS: Of the 707 participants who remained in the trial at 36 months, 553 had a standard-risk or high-risk HLA genotype and completed the study. At 2 years of age, significantly higher proportions of children in group A than in group B had celiac disease autoimmunity (16% vs. 7%, P=0.002) and overt celiac disease (12% vs. 5%, P=0.01). At 5 years of age, the between-group differences were no longer significant for autoimmunity (21% in group A and 20% in group B, P=0.59) or overt disease (16% and 16%, P=0.78 by the log-rank test). At 10 years, the risk of celiac disease autoimmunity was far higher among children with high-risk HLA than among those with standard-risk HLA (38% vs. 19%, P=0.001), as was the risk of overt celiac disease (26% vs. 16%, P=0.05). Other variables, including breast-feeding, were not associated with the development of celiac disease. CONCLUSIONS: Neither the delayed introduction of gluten nor breast-feeding modified the risk of celiac disease among at-risk infants, although the later introduction of gluten was associated with a delayed onset of disease. A high-risk HLA genotype was an important predictor of disease. (Funded by the Fondazione Celiachia of the Italian Society for Celiac Disease; CELIPREV ClinicalTrials.gov number, NCT00639444.).},

   abstract = {Celiac disease is an immune-mediated disorder triggered by gluten in genetically susceptible persons. Despite its detrimental effects on human health, it has not disappeared over time. The current evolutionary theory is that celiac disease is more common in areas reached later by agricultural revolution than in countries that started consumption of wheat earlier, due to negative selection caused by celiac disease. We reviewed data on worldwide prevalence of celiac disease, wheat consumption, and frequencies of HLA-celiac-disease-predisposing-genotypes to investigate their mutual relationship. Studies assessing prevalence of celiac disease were identified through a MEDLINE search. Wheat consumption and frequencies of HLA-DQ2-DQ8 were obtained from Food and Agriculture Organization of the United Nations and allelefrequencies.net database. Correlations between celiac disease, wheat consumption, and HLA were analyzed by linear regression. We observed a significant correlation between wheat consumption and HLA DQ2 (p=0.01) and the sum of DQ2 and DQ8 (p=0.01) frequencies. Wheat consumption and HLA-DQ2 tend to co-localize in different continents. The correlation between the prevalence of celiac disease and either DQ2 and/or DQ8, or the product of DQ2+DQ8*wheat consumption was not statistically significant. Co-localization of gluten consumption and HLA-celiac-disease-predisposing-genotypes can be explained by positive selection of HLA-DQ2 genes in wheat-consuming areas, and "demic diffusion" of Middle East farmers into Europe.},

   abstract = {Adherence to a gluten-free diet (GFD) for nonceliac athletes (NCA) has become increasingly popular despite a paucity of supportive medical or ergogenic evidence. This study aimed to quantify the demographics of NCA and determine associated experiences, perceptions, and sources of information related to GFD. Athletes (n = 910, female = 528, no gender selected = 5) completed a 17-question online survey. Forty-one percent of NCA respondents, including 18-world and/or Olympic medalists, follow a GFD 50-100% of the time (GFD > 50): only 13% for treatment of reported medical conditions with 57% self-diagnosing their gluten sensitivity. The GFD > 50 group characteristics included predominantly endurance sport athletes (70.0%) at the recreationally competitive level (32.3%), between 31 and 40 years of age (29.1%). Those who follow a GFD > 50 reported experiencing, abdominal/gastrointestinal (GI) symptoms alone (16.7%) or in conjunction with two (30.7%) or three (35.7%) additional symptoms (e.g., fatigue) believed to be triggered by gluten. Eighty-four percent of GFD > 50 indicated symptom improvement with gluten-removal. Symptom-based and non-symptom-based self-diagnosed gluten-sensitivity (56.7%) was the primary reason for adopting a GFD. Leading sources of GFD information were online (28.7%), trainer/coach (26.2%) and other athletes (17.4%). Although 5-10% of the general population is estimated to benefit clinically from a GFD a higher prevalence of GFD adherence was found in NCA (41.2%). Prescription of a GFD among many athletes does not result from evidence-based practice suggesting that adoption of a GFD in the majority of cases was not based on medical rationale and may be driven by perception that gluten removal provides health benefits and an ergogenic edge in NCA.},

   abstract = {BACKGROUND: In recent years, three national gastroenterology societies established guidelines for the diagnosis and therapy of pancreatic exocrine insufficiency (PEI). In addition, the Cochrane Collaboration issued a review. OBJECTIVE: The purpose of this paper is to present an overview of the recommendations and concordance between the four recent published guidelines and stimulate further discussion. METHODS: A review of the Australian, German and Italian guidelines and the Cochrane review was conducted, and a synthesis was made of common statements. RESULTS: There is a high degree of agreement on almost all items within these guidelines, both in the diagnosis of PEI and in terms of therapy and approach to management of PEI. In addition, novel emerging developments are highlighted, such as the fecal elastase-1 test, which is widely used but is not suitable for measuring mild-to-moderate PEI despite its ability to positively establish the diagnosis of severe PEI. One of the few novel tests proving to be useful is the (13)C mixed-chain triglycerides (MCT) breath test. This test, albeit an excellent quantitative test, is not widely used and is rarely available. The use of this test is making it apparent that there is a difference between treating the symptoms of PEI and treating malnutrition, the broader underlying defect. This may have direct consequences for the dosing of pancreatic enzymes (pancreatin), in that the consensus starting dose of all guidelines may be too low for some patients. Although chronic pancreatitis in adults and cystic fibrosis in children account for the main evidence base used for PEI, other indications are also discussed. CONCLUSIONS: There is good concordance between recommendations provided by international groups. More prospective studies are required in many areas, including the use of pancreatic enzymes in other gastrointestinal disorders, such as celiac disease and irritable bowel syndrome (IBS). We also need to assess the feasibility of the (13)C MCT breath test. At the same time, it needs to be confirmed that higher doses of pancreatic enzymes are really necessary to not only relieve the symptoms of PEI but also treat malnutrition appropriately.},

   abstract = {BACKGROUND: The treatment of celiac disease is a strict, life-long gluten-free (GF) diet. This diet is complex and can be challenging. Factors affecting adherence to the GF diet are important to identify for improving adherence. OBJECTIVE: To identify factors that inhibit or improve adherence to a GF diet in children with celiac disease. METHODS: Patients (<18 years of age) with biopsy-confirmed celiac disease followed by the gastroenterology service at a tertiary care paediatric institution were surveyed using a mailed questionnaire. Factors influencing adherence to a GF diet were scored from 1 to 10 based on how often they were problematic (1 = never, 10 = always). Parents of patients <13 years of age were instructed to complete the survey with their child. Adolescents >/=13 years of age were asked to complete the survey themselves. RESULTS: Of 253 subjects, 126 completed the survey; the median age was 12 years (range two to 18 years). Forty percent were adolescents. Overall, participants reported good adherence at home and school, but lower adherence at social events. Adolescents reported lower adherence compared with parents. Availability of GF foods and cost were the most significant barriers. Other factors identified to help with a GF diet included education for schools/restaurants and improved government support. CONCLUSIONS: Availability, cost and product labelling are major barriers to adherence to a GF diet. Better awareness, improved labelling and income support are needed to help patients.},

   abstract = {BACKGROUND: The consequences of subclinical coeliac disease (CD) in Type 1 diabetes mellitus (T1DM) remain unclear. We looked at growth, anthropometry and disease management in children with dual diagnosis (T1DM + CD) before and after CD diagnosis. METHODS: Anthropometry, glycated haemoglobin (HbA1c) and IgA tissue transglutaminase (tTg) were collected prior to, and following CD diagnosis in 23 children with T1DM + CD. This group was matched for demographics, T1DM duration, age at CD diagnosis and at T1DM onset with 23 CD and 44 T1DM controls. RESULTS: No differences in growth or anthropometry were found between children with T1DM + CD and controls at any time point. Children with T1DM + CD, had higher BMI z-score two years prior to, than at CD diagnosis (p < 0.001). BMI z-score change one year prior to CD diagnosis was lower in the T1DM + CD than the T1DM group (p = 0.009). At two years, height velocity and change in BMI z-scores were similar in all groups. No differences were observed in HbA1c between the T1DM + CD and T1DM groups before or after CD diagnosis. More children with T1DM + CD had raised tTg levels one year after CD diagnosis than CD controls (CDx to CDx + 1 yr; T1DM + CD: 100% to 71%, p = 0.180 and CD: 100% to 45%, p < 0.001); by two years there was no difference. CONCLUSIONS: No major nutrition or growth deficits were observed in children with T1DM + CD. CD diagnosis does not impact on T1DM glycaemic control. CD specific serology was comparable to children with single CD, but those with dual diagnosis may need more time to adjust to gluten free diet.},

   abstract = {A gluten-free diet (GFD) is the treatment for celiac disease (CD), but due to its complexity, dietitian referral is uniformly recommended. We surveyed patients with CD to determine if dietitian use is associated with quality of life, symptom severity, or GFD adherence. The survey utilized three validated CD-specific instruments: the CD quality of life (CD-QOL), CD symptom index (CSI) and CD adherence test (CDAT). Four hundred and thirteen patients with biopsy-proven CD were eligible for inclusion. The majority (77%) were female and mean BMI was 24.1. Over three-quarters of patients (326, 79%) had seen a dietitian, however, 161 (39%) had seen a dietitian only once. Age, sex, and education level were not associated with dietitian use; nor was BMI (24.6 vs. 24.0, p = 0.45). On multivariate analysis, adjusting for age gender, education, duration of disease, and body mass index, dietitian use was not associated with CD-QOL, CSI, or CDAT scores. Our survey did not show an association between dietitian use and symptom severity, adherence, or quality of life. Delay in diagnosis was associated with poorer outcomes. This is a preliminary study with several limitations, and further prospective analysis is needed to evaluate the benefits and cost-effectiveness of dietitian-referral in the care of celiac disease patients.},

   abstract = {At present, strict and lifelong gluten-free diet is the only effective treatment for celiac disease. Even small amounts of gluten (50 mg/day) can be immunogenic; therefore all food and food items and drugs that contain gluten and its derivatives must be eliminated completely from the diet. While prescribing gluten-free diet is easy; the key to the success is the dietary counseling by a nutrition specialist and maintenance of adherence to GFD by the patient. In recent times, a number of targets to halt the process of immunological injury have been explored to find out alternative treatment for celiac disease. These targets include exploration of ancient wheat if they are less immunogenic, intra-luminal digestion of gluten using prolylendopeptidases, pretreatment of whole gluten with bacterial-derived peptidase before ingestion; prevention of passage of immunogenic peptides through the tight junctions such as zonulin antagonists, Blocking of HLA-DQ2 to prevent binding of immunogenic peptides, inhibition of transglutaminase 2, immune-modulation, and induction of tolerance to gluten using gluten tolerizing vaccines, use of gluten-sequestering polymers, use of anti-inflammatory drugs (glucocorticoids, budesonides) and anti-cytokines such as anti TNF-alpha, and anti-interleukin-15. While many of these targets are still in the pre-clinical phase, some of them including zonulin antagonist and endopeptidases have already reached phase II and phase III clinical trials. Furthermore, while these targets appear very exciting; they at best are likely to be used as adjunctive therapy rather than a complete replacement for gluten-free diet.},

   abstract = {The basis for celiac disease (CD) treatment is a strict lifelong gluten-free diet. On the diet, the small intestinal mucosal injury heals and gluten-induced symptoms and signs disappear. The mucosal healing is a prerequisite for sustaining health and is also obtained with a diet containing oats and trace amounts of gluten, industrially purified wheat starch-based gluten-free products. The small intestinal mucosa does not heal in noncompliant people, nor when a patient is inadvertently ingesting gluten. Development of adjunctive or alternative therapies is on its way. There are several novel treatment pipelines within academy and industry. Examples are the ideas of using glutenases as a drug to degrade the ingested gluten, polymers to bind and sequester the gluten to the feces, and also vaccine development for an immunotherapy to induce tolerance towards gluten. Clinical drug trials are to be foreseen in CD, soon also in children.},

   abstract = {BACKGROUND: A significant percentage of the general population report problems caused by wheat and/or gluten ingestion, even though they do not have celiac disease (CD) or wheat allergy (WA), because they test negative both for CD-specific serology and histopathology and for immunoglobulin E (IgE)-mediated assays. Most patients report both gastrointestinal and nongastrointestinal symptoms, and all report improvement of symptoms on a gluten-free diet. This clinical condition has been named non-celiac gluten sensitivity (NCGS). AIM: We attempt to define the current pathogenic, clinical, and diagnostic criteria of this "new" disease, to provide a practical view that might be useful to evaluate, diagnose, and manage NCGS patients. METHODS: We reviewed the international literature through PubMed and Medline, using the search terms "wheat (hyper)sensitivity," "wheat allergy," "wheat intolerance," "gluten (hyper)sensitivity," and "gluten intolerance," and we discuss current knowledge about NCGS. RESULTS: It has been demonstrated that patients suffering from NCGS are a heterogeneous group, composed of several subgroups, each characterized by different pathogenesis, clinical history, and, probably, clinical course. NCGS diagnosis can be reached only by excluding CD and WA. Recent evidence shows that a personal history of food allergy in infancy, coexistent atopy, positive for immunoglobulin G (IgG) antigliadin antibodies and flow cytometric basophil activation test, with wheat and duodenal and/or ileum-colon intraepithelial and lamina propria eosinophil counts, could be useful to identify NCGS patients. CONCLUSIONS: Future research should aim to identify reliable biomarkers for NCGS diagnosis and to better define the different NCGS subgroups. Key teaching points: * Most patients report both gastrointestinal and nongastrointestinal symptoms, and all agree that there is an improvement of symptoms on a gluten-free diet. * NCGS diagnosis can be reached only by excluding celiac disease and wheat allergy. * Patients suffering from NCGS are a heterogeneous group, composed of several subgroups, each characterized by different pathogenesis, clinical history, and, probably, clinical course. * A personal history of food allergy in infancy, coexistent atopy, positive IgG antigliadin antibodies (AGA) and flow cytometric basophil activation test, with wheat and duodenal and/or ileum-colon intraepithelial and lamina propria eosinophil counts, could be useful to identify NCGS patients. * Future research should aim to identify reliable biomarkers for NCGS diagnosis and to better define the different NCGS subgroup.},

   abstract = {BACKGROUND: Currently, the only treatment for celiac disease (CD) is a lifelong gluten-free diet (GFD). Research has been carried out in various countries into the nutritional adequacy of the GFD in terms of macro- and micronutrients, mostly presenting conflicting results. However, no data for Germany are available to date. AIM: To elucidate the nutritional composition of a GFD and to compare it with non-GFD in a representative German non-CD population. METHODS AND PATIENTS: A total of 1,000 patients who were members of the German Celiac Society (DZG) were invited to fill out a prospective 7-day food diary and a questionnaire. Data from 88 patients aged 14-80 years were analyzed and compared to the DACH reference values and to data from the German National Diet and Nutrition Survey (NVS II). RESULTS: No significant difference was observed for the intake of energy and macronutrients in male celiac patients compared to the NVS II. Only the fiber intake of male patients was significantly lower than that of the general population. Female patients, however, showed a significantly higher fat intake, but lower carbohydrate consumption. The average daily micronutrient intake of male and female patients, specifically of vitamin B1, B2, B6, folic acid, magnesium and iron, was significantly lower in celiac patients compared to the NVS II. CONCLUSION: This study reveals inadequate nutrient intake by male and female celiac patients in Germany. Based on our findings, regular (laboratory) monitoring of celiac patients should be recommended.},

   abstract = {BACKGROUND: Coeliac disease is an autoimmune disorder that is considered to affect approximately one in 100 people. In the UK, gluten-free (GF) foods can be prescribed by general practitioners (GPs) to treat this condition and there are national guidelines on the quantities of GF food an individual should receive on prescription. Information on actual prescribing behaviour by GPs, and how this compares with guideline recommendations, is scarce. The present study aimed to describe GPs prescribing practice of GF foods, within one locality in the UK, comparing this with national guidelines. METHODS: A retrospective evaluation of GP electronic medical records for all patients with a gluten-sensitive enteropathy diagnosis and/or those prescribed GF food between April 2010 and March 2011 was carried out in 16 GP practices in the west of Scotland, serving a total of 85 667 patients. RESULTS: Of 175 (0.18% of the total practice population) patients, 152 were identified with coeliac disease, eight with dermatitis herpetiformis and six with both conditions. A further nine patients received GF foods on prescriptions with no recorded diagnosis. There was a positive association between adherence to the prescribing guidelines and female sex (P < 0.0001) and (for those with a recorded diagnosis) increasing age (P = 0.001). There was no significant association between either socio-economic deprivation or co-morbidities and adherence to the prescribing guidelines. CONCLUSIONS: There was significant under prescribing of GF foods in those identified. Further research is required to establish whether these results are representative of wider practice in the UK.},

We sought to investigate C. difficile infection in pediatric patients with IBD in comparison with a group of children with celiac disease and to evaluate IBD disease course of C. difficile infected patients. METHODS: In this prospective, comparative, multicenter study, 211 pediatric patients with IBD were enrolled from October 2010 to October 2011 and tested for the presence of C. difficile toxins A and B in their stools at 0, 6, and 12 months. During the same study period, stool specimens for C. difficile toxins analysis were collected from 112 children with celiac disease as controls. RESULTS: Clostridium difficile occurrence was significantly higher in patients with IBD compared with patients with celiac disease (7.5% versus 0.8%; P = 0.008). Clostridium difficile was associated with active disease in 71.4% of patients with IBD (P = 0.01). Colonic involvement was found in 85.7% of patients with C. difficile. Antibiotics, proton pump inhibitors, hospitalization, and IBD therapies were not associated with increased C. difficile detection. At 12 months, a higher number of C. difficile-positive patients at the enrollment started immunosuppressant/biological therapy compared with patients without C. difficile (P = 0.01). At 6 and 12 months, patients with C. difficile were more frequently in active disease than patients without C. difficile (P = 0.04; P = 0.08, respectively). Hospitalizations were higher at 6 months in C. difficile group (P = 0.05). CONCLUSIONS: In conclusion, this study demonstrates that pediatric IBD is associated with increased C. difficile detection. Patients with C. difficile tend to have active colonic disease and a more severe disease course.},

   abstract = {UNLABELLED: Patients with recently-diagnosed adult celiac disease were evaluated with the Gastrointestinal Symptom rating Scale (GSRS) and Psychological General Well-Being Index (PGWBI) to evaluate their psychological alterations, the association between any alterations and gastrointestinal symptoms, and their outcome after starting a gluten-free diet. The patients underwent nutritional assessment and then started a gluten-free diet; they were reassessed 6 months later. Quantitative variables are expressed as the median and 25th-75th percentiles. RESULTS: We included 21 patients, 17 women and 4 mena, with a mean age of 43 years (31-47). The results of histological analysis were compatible with Marsh I lesions in 6 patients, Marsh IIIa in 6 and Marsh IIIb in 9. At baseline, 8 patients showed severe psychological distress, 4 showed moderate distress and 9 showed no distress. The GSRS score was 34 (17-43) and the PGWBI was 64 (48-87), with a significant correlation between the 2 indexes (rho=-.58, P=.006). At 6 months, 3 patients had severe psychological distress, 5 had moderate distress, 9 showed no distress and 4 showed psychological well-being. The GSRS score at 6 months was 13 (8-17) and the PGWBI was 83 (68-95) (P<.05 compared with baseline data for the 3 indicators). The 6 axes of the PGWBI showed significant improvement. At 6 months, no correlation was found between the GSRS and PGWBI. CONCLUSIONS: Patients with celiac disease have psychological alterations whose intensity is related to gastrointestinal symptoms. These symptoms improve after the start of a gluten-free diet.},

   abstract = {INTRODUCTION: Anorexia nervosa (AN) is characterised by a refusal to normal body weight accompanied by a marked restriction of food intake, frequently leading to severe malnutrition. In severe malnutrition and wasting syndromes, mucosal atrophy, altered gastrointestinal motility and pancreatic atrophy, which alter digestive function and can exacerbate malnutrition, have been described. The objective of this work was to determine intestinal absorption and pancreatic function in severely malnourished AN patients before and after recovery. METHODS: Ten severely malnourished AN women were studied at hospital admittance (body mass index = 11.44-16.16 kg/m(2)) and after weight recovery with artificial nutrition (body mass index >/= 20 kg/m(2)). A (13)C-labelled triglycerides digestion test, faecal elastase test and d-xylose absorption test were performed. RESULTS: In nine patients, (13)C-labelled triglycerides digestion tests and the faecal elastase and d-xylose tests were normal both before and after weight recovery. In one patient, the results were abnormal, and they led to the detection of a previously undiagnosed celiac disease in addition to her AN. CONCLUSION: In this series, there was neither intestinal absorption nor pancreatic function disturbances in severely malnourished AN patients either before or after weight recovery. The usefulness of these tests in the differentiation of functional versus structural changes needs further studies.},

   abstract = {In the last decade the development of gluten-free foodstuffs has attracted great attention as a result of better diagnoses of coeliac disease and a greater knowledge of the relationship between gluten-free products and health. The increasing interest has prompted extensive research into the development of gluten-free foodstuffs that resemble gluten-containing foods. This review aims to provide some insights on dough functionality and process conditions regarding bread quality and to point out recent research dealing with the nutritional composition of those products. Gluten-free dough results from the combination of different ingredients, additives, and the processing aids required for building up network structures responsible for bread quality. Some relationships between dough rheology and bread characteristics were established to identify possible predictor parameters. Regarding bread-making processes, the impact of mixing, dough treatment and baking is stated. Nutritional quality is an important asset when developing gluten-free breads, and different strategies for improving it are reviewed. Gluten-free bread quality is dependent on ingredients and additives combination, but also processing can provide a way to improve bread quality. Nutritive value of the gluten-free breads must be always in mind when setting up recipes, for obtaining nutritionally balanced bread with adequate glycaemic index.},

   abstract = {OBJECTIVES: Prevalence of celiac disease in children is approximately 1%, but most patients remain unrecognized by reason of variable clinical presentation. Undetected patients may have an increased burden of illness and use of health care services because of nonspecific complaints. We investigated these issues prospectively in newly detected patients with celiac disease before and after diagnosis in a large nationwide cohort of children. METHODS: A validated questionnaire was sent to consecutive families whose children had been diagnosed as having celiac disease within 1 year. The survey contained questions about the use of medical consultations, on-demand drugs, vitamins and herbal products, children's absenteeism from day care or school and, parents' work absenteeism. A follow-up questionnaire was sent after 1 year of receiving a gluten-free diet. RESULTS: A total of 132 families responded. A total of 44 children were diagnosed because of gastrointestinal and 88 because of extraintestinal symptoms or by risk-group screening. On treatment, outpatient visits to primary health care decreased from a mean of 3.0 to 1.3 visits per year (P < 0.001), the number of hospitalizations from 0.2 to 0.1 (P = 0.008), and antibiotic prescriptions from 1.0 to 0.5/year (P < 0.001). Visits to secondary and tertiary health care increased from 0.6 to 1.4 (P < 0.001), mostly for celiac surveillance. Use of vitamins, micronutrients, and herbal products increased from 7.3 to 10.2 pills per month (P = 0.028). CONCLUSIONS: Implementation of a gluten-free diet resulted in reduced use of health care services and antibiotic prescriptions in children. Our findings support active case-finding and risk-group screening for celiac disease.},

Subjects performed individually six sensory tests, two for each product in different days separated by a week. In the test day, children had to evaluate the liking of the same type of product but of different four brands, before and after tasting them with a 5-point facial rating scale. Overall, the results showed that the majority of children appreciated more the appearance than the taste of all the GF products analysed. The present study provides the first and useful indications on the hedonic perceptions of celiac children about some commercial GF products.},

DESIGN: The database was built using the nutritional composition of the products, taking into consideration both the composition of the ingredients and the nutritional information reported on the product label. SETTING: The nutrient composition of each ingredient was obtained from two Italian databases (European Institute of Oncology and the National Institute for Food and Nutrition). SUBJECTS: The study developed a food composition database including a total of sixty foods representative of different categories of gluten-free products sold on the Italian market. The composition of the products included in the database is given in terms of quantity of macro- and micronutrients per 100 g of product as sold, and includes the full range of nutrient data present in traditional databases of gluten-containing foods. RESULTS: As expected, most of the products had a high content of carbohydrates and some of them can be labelled as a source of fibre (>3 g/100 g). Regarding micronutrients, among the products considered, breads, pizzas and snacks were especially very high in Na content (>400-500 mg/100 g). CONCLUSIONS: This database provides an initial useful tool for future nutritional surveys on the dietary habits of coeliac people.},

   abstract = {OBJECTIVE: To assess the prevalence and determinants of haematinic deficiency (lack of B12 folate or iron) and macrocytosis in blood from a national population-based study of middle-aged and older adults. METHODS: A cross-sectional study involving 1,207 adults aged >/=45 years, recruited from a sub-study of the Irish National Survey of Lifestyle Attitudes and Nutrition (SLAN 2007). Participants completed a health and lifestyle questionnaire and a standard food frequency questionnaire. Non-fasting blood samples were obtained for measurement of full blood count and expert morphological assessment, serum ferritin, soluble transferrin receptor assay (sTfR), B12, folate and coeliac antibodies. Blood samples were also assayed for thyroid function (T4, TSH), liver function, aminotransferase (AST) and gamma-glutamyl transferase (GGT). RESULTS: The overall prevalence (95% C.I.) of anaemia (Hb <13.5 g/dl men and 11.3 g/dl women) was 4.6% (2.9%-6.4%) in men and 1.0% (0.2%-1.9%) in women. Iron deficiency (ferritin <17 ng/ml men and <11 ng/ml in women) was detected in 6.3% of participants (3.7% in males and 8.7% in females, p<0.001). Based on both low ferritin and raised sTfR (>21 nmol/ml) only 2.3% were iron-deficient. 3.0% and 2.7% were found to have low levels of serum folate (<2.3 ng/ml) and serum B12 (<120 ng/l) respectively. Clinically significant macrocytosis (MCV>99fl) was detected in 8.4% of subjects. Strong, significant and independent associations with macrocytosis were observed for lower social status, current smoking status, moderate to heavy alcohol intake, elevated GGT levels, deficiency of folate and vitamin B12, hypothyroidism and coeliac disease. The population attributable fraction (PAF) for macrocytosis associated with elevated GGT (25.0%) and smoking (24.6%) was higher than for excess alcohol intake (6.3%), folate deficiency (10.5%) or vitamin B12 (3.4%). CONCLUSIONS: Haematinic deficiency and macrocytosis are common in middle-aged/older adults in Ireland. Macrocytosis is more likely to be attributable to an elevated GGT and smoking than vitamin B12 or folate deficiency.},

   abstract = {Wheat prolamins, commonly known as "gluten", are a complex mixture of 71-78 proteins, which constitute ~80% of the proteins in the wheat grains and supply 50% of the global dietary protein demand. Prolamins are also responsible for numerous gluten-induced disorders and determine the unique visco-elastic properties of the wheat dough. These properties necessitate the reliable determination of the prolamin composition in wheat grains and their derived products. Therefore, this study examined the impact of HPLC conditions, including column type, column temperature, flow rate, and the gradient of polar and non-polar solvents in the mobile phase, to improve the analytical resolution of prolamins. The following conditions were found optimal for analyses: column temperature 60 degrees C, flow rate 1.0 mL/min and an elution gradient of 20%-60% of 0.1% trifluoroacetic acid + acetonitrile in 60 min. For further improvement of resolution, gliadin and glutenin extracts were analyzed using MALDI-TOF-MS in combination with HPLC fractionation. Two semi-quantitative methods, densitometry of stained polyacrylamide gels and HPLC, were used to determine relative prolamin quantities and the correspondence between the methods was established. The combinatorial gluten analyses approach developed during the present study was used to analyze prolamin profiles of wheat transformants expressing DEMETER silencing artificial microRNA, and the results are discussed.},

   abstract = {Beginning with the observation that birth weight correlates with increased risk of cardiovascular disease, the concept of neonatal programming, that the environmental influence on fetal and neonatal development results in modification of the risk profile for adult disease, has begun to emerge as an important component to understanding the origin of chronic diseases of many different organ systems. Until recently, the gastrointestinal system has not been considered. Our understanding of the pathogenesis of many intestinal inflammatory disorders is still incomplete; however, a brief review of what is known reveals several opportunities for the early intraluminal environment to affect the development of the intestinal immune system. Early clinical observations such as the increased risk of celiac disease observed in those born by cesarean section and the protective effect of breast-feeding against inflammatory bowel disease and celiac disease support the role of neonatal programming in the development of chronic inflammatory gastrointestinal disease. Additional, more robust clinical studies are needed to confirm this role. Furthermore, examination of the possible mechanisms of immune phenotype modification is necessary.},

   abstract = {The gluten-free (GF) products market represents one of the most prosperous markets in the field of food and beverages in the immediate future. Historically, counselling for celiac disease has focused on the absence of gluten in foods, however the nutritional quality of GF foodstuffs is an important aspect to consider. The aim of the present work was to compare the nutritional composition of the 206 GF rendered products most consumed in Spain, against the composition of 289 equivalent foods with gluten, and to make a comparison between the diet including GF products and the same diet with equivalent products with gluten in a 58 adult celiac population. The results of the present collaborative study pointed out differences in calorie, macronutrient, fiber, sodium, salt and cholesterol content between GF rendered and gluten-containing foodstuffs. Thus, calorie and nutrient intake in a GF diet is different when compared to its equivalent diet with gluten. Following a diet based on GF products could suppose a nutritional imbalance for celiac patients as well as for non-celiacs who follow a diet that includes many GF rendered foodstuffs.},

   abstract = {BACKGROUND AND AIM: To diagnose coeliac disease (CD) in children younger than 2 years, the old ESPGHAN criteria based on 3 small bowel biopsies were recommended until recently. The aim of the present study was to investigate the applicability of only 1 small intestinal biopsy plus positive serology for the diagnosis of CD in children younger than 2 years. METHODS: A prospective cohort study included 81 patients younger than 2 years with symptoms suggestive of CD, who all completed the diagnostic procedure based on 3 small bowel biopsies. According to the finding of the third biopsy, patients were divided into group A-CD confirmed (N = 44), and group B-CD not confirmed, after the gluten challenge (N = 37). RESULTS: At the time of the first biopsy, total villous atrophy (Marsh IIIc) was found more often in group A than in group B (77% vs 27%, P < 0.01). Also, all of the studied antibodies were more frequently positive in group A than in group B (P < 0.01 for all of the tested antibodies). Positive anti-endomysial antibodies and Marsh IIIc finding were the best discriminators between the group A and the group B and considerably contributed to the prediction of CD. CONCLUSIONS: The second and the third biopsies (before and after the gluten challenge) may also be avoided when diagnosing CD in children younger than 2 years provided that the child, at the time of presentation, has positive anti-endomysial antibodies and Marsh IIIc on the small bowel biopsy. A gluten challenge should be still considered in all other children younger than 2 years.},

   abstract = {IgA nephropathy is the most common form of primary glomerulonephritis worldwide. Mucosal infections and food antigens, including wheat gluten, have been proposed as potential contributing environmental factors. Increased immune reactivity to gluten and/or association with celiac disease, an autoimmune disorder triggered by ingestion of gluten, have been reported in IgA nephropathy. However, studies are inconsistent about this association. We aimed to evaluate the proposed link between IgA nephropathy and celiac disease or immune reactivity to gluten by conducting a comprehensive analysis of associated serologic markers in cohorts of well-characterized patients and controls. Study participants included patients with biopsy-proven IgA nephropathy (n = 99), unaffected controls of similar age, gender, and race (n = 96), and patients with biopsy-proven celiac disease (n = 30). All serum specimens were tested for IgG and IgA antibodies to native gliadin and deamidated gliadin, as well as IgA antibody to transglutaminase 2 (TG2). Anti-TG2 antibody-positive nephropathy patients and unaffected controls were subsequently tested for IgA anti-endomysial antibody and genotyped for celiac disease-associated HLA-DQ2 and -DQ8 alleles. In comparison to unaffected controls, there was not a statistically significant increase in IgA or IgG antibody reactivity to gliadin in individuals with IgA nephropathy. In addition, the levels of celiac disease-specific serologic markers, i.e., antibodies to deamidated gliadin and TG2, did not differ between IgA nephropathy patients and unaffected controls. Results of the additional anti-endomysial antibody testing and HLA genotyping were corroborative. The data from this case-control study do not reveal any evidence to suggest a significant role for celiac disease or immune reactivity to gluten in IgA nephropathy.},

Therefore, absence of these genotypes is commonly used to exclude the diagnosis of CD. To investigate whether this approach is justified, the HLA-distribution in 155 children with CD was studied. A total of 139 (89.7%) patients carried HLA-DQ2.5. Of the remaining patients, 7 (4.5%) carried HLA-DQ8. Interestingly, the 9 (5.8%) patients lacking HLA-DQ2.5 and HLA-DQ8 carried HLA-DQA1*02:01 and -DQB1*02:02 (HLA-DQ2.2). Therefore, HLA-DQ2.2 should be included as an important HLA-type related to CD.},

   abstract = {AIM: To investigate celiac disease (CD) clustering at different geographical levels and to examine the association between neighborhood demographic and socioeconomic conditions and the risk of neighborhood CD. METHODS: We included 2080 children diagnosed with CD between 1998 and 2003, identified from 43 of the 47 reporting hospitals in Sweden. A total of 8036 small area market statistics (SAMS) areas were included; these were nested in 253 municipalities that were further nested into eight 'nomenclature of territorial units for statistics' (NUTS) 2 regions. We performed multilevel logistic regression analyses. RESULTS: We found the highest geographical variation in CD incidence at the municipality level, compared to the region level. The probability of having CD increased in the statistical areas of (SAMS) areas with higher average annual work income, with an odds ratio (OR) of 2.24 and 95% CI of 1.76-2.85. Reduced CD risk in neighborhoods was associated with higher average age (OR 0.96; 95% CI 0.95-0.97), higher proportion of residents with a university education (OR 0.98; 95% CI 0.97-0.99), and higher level of industrial and commercial activity (OR 0.59; 95% CI 0.44-0.82). We found no significant association between CD risk and population density, proportion of Nordic to non-Nordic inhabitants, nor share of the population with only a compulsory education. CONCLUSIONS: Neighborhood composition influences cd risk this is one of the first attempts to identify factors explaining geographical variation in CD.},

   abstract = {BACKGROUND: On ingestion of gliadin, the major protein component of wheat and other cereals, the celiac intestine is characterized by the proliferation of crypt enterocytes with an inversion of the differentiation/proliferation program. Gliadins and A-gliadin peptide P31-43, in particular, act as growth factors for crypt enterocytes in patients with celiac disease (CD). The effects of gliadin on crypt enterocyte proliferation and activation of innate immunity are mediated by epidermal growth factors (EGFs) and innate immunity mediators [interleukin 15 (IL15)]. OBJECTIVE: The aim of this study was to determine the molecular basis of proliferation and innate immune response to gliadin peptides in enterocytes. DESIGN: The CaCo-2 cell line was used to study EGF-, IL15-, and P31-43-induced proliferation. Silencing messenger RNAs and blocking EGF receptor and IL15 antibodies have been used to study proliferation in CaCo-2 cells and intestinal biopsy samples from patients with CD and control subjects. RESULTS: In the CaCo-2 cell model, IL15 and EGF cooperated to induce proliferation in intestinal epithelial cells at both the transcriptional and posttranscriptional levels, and the respective receptors interacted to activate each other's signaling. In addition, the effects of the P31-43 peptide on CaCo-2 cell proliferation and downstream signaling were mediated by cooperation between EGF and IL15. The increased crypt enterocyte proliferation in intestinal biopsy samples from patients with CD was reduced by EGF receptor and IL15 blocking antibodies only when used in combination. CONCLUSIONS: EGF receptor/IL15R-alpha cooperation regulates intestinal epithelial cell proliferation induced by EGF, IL15, and the gliadin peptide P31-43. Increased proliferation of crypt enterocytes in the intestine of CD patients is mediated by EGF/IL15 cooperation.},

   abstract = {OBJECTIVE: Microscopic colitis (MC) is prevalent in adults investigated for chronic watery diarrhea, yet characterization of pediatric MC is limited. METHODS: Our pathology database was searched from 1995 to 2011 for pediatric cases of lymphocytic colitis (LC) or collagenous colitis (CC). Those with diarrhea persisting for >2 weeks and visually normal colonoscopy were accepted as cases. Demographics, laboratory results, medication use within 3 months of presentation, medical and family history of autoimmune disease, and response to treatment were abstracted. RESULTS: A total of 27 cases were histologically consistent with MC on biopsy; 5 with concomitant enteric infection or isolated abdominal pain were excluded. Twenty-two cases of MC (female patients, 59%; median age at diagnosis, 15.3 years) were included (19 LC and 3 CC). Two had type 1 diabetes mellitus, 2 were anti-nuclear antibody positive, and 2 had common variable immunodeficiency. Of 20 patients who underwent an esophagogastroduodenoscopy, 1 had collagenous sprue and 4 had celiac disease. One presented after the clearance of recurrent Clostridium difficile infection. Previous drug exposures included nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drugs (n = 7), proton pump inhibitors (n = 6), and selective serotonin reuptake inhibitors (n = 3). Common symptoms in addition to diarrhea included abdominal pain (77.3%) and weight loss (27.3%). Of 17 patients with follow-up, all of the 8 treated with steroids had some response: 57.1% (4/7) responded to mesalamine and 42.9% (3/7) responded to bismuth subsalicylate. CONCLUSIONS: In this cohort of pediatric patients, LC was much more common than CC. As described in adults, we observed associations with celiac disease, type 1 diabetes mellitus, and medications; we additionally saw an association with immunodeficiency. Our patients showed greater response to steroids than mesalamine or bismuth.},

The aim of the present study was to analyze the features and the long-term response to immunosuppressive treatment in children with autoimmune hepatitis (AIH) associated with CD. METHODS: Retrospective and prospective evaluation of patients followed at a single center. RESULTS: Among 79 patients with AIH, 15 (19%) had CD (9 type 1, 3 type 2, 3 seronegative). In the group of patients with AIH and CD, female sex was significantly more represented than in the group of patients with AIH alone; also, in the former group, diagnosis was made significantly earlier (P < 0.05). All of the 15 patients on a gluten-free diet achieved sustained remission when treated with prednisone and azathioprine or cyclosporine. The mean period of follow-up was 73 months; discontinuation of therapy was attempted in 9 patients while in remission: 4 patients relapsed, 5 (33%) could definitively stop immunosuppressive treatment with a mean period of treatment-free sustained remission of 89 months (range 26-174). In the same period, treatment discontinuation, attempted in 24 of 64 patients with AIH without CD, was successful in 5 patients (8%; P < 0.05). CONCLUSIONS: Patients with AIH coexisting with CD achieve treatment-free sustained remission in a significantly higher proportion, when compared with patients with AIH without CD, suggesting a possible long-term adjuvant effect of a gluten-free diet.},

   abstract = {OBJECTIVE: Celiac disease (CD) has a prevalence of 0.55% to 1% in Italy. Identifying CD in schoolchildren to characterize CD iceberg and evaluate the effect of diagnosis in screening-detected children. METHODS: A total of 7377 5- to 8-year-old children were invited to participate. A total of 5733 salivary samples were collected and tested for anti-transglutaminase antibodies (tTGAb), using a fluid-phase radioimmunoassay. Salivary tTGAb-positive children were analyzed for serum antibodies (anti-endomysium antibodies, radioimmunoassay, and enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay tTGAb). Positive children underwent endoscopy and then started gluten-free diet (GFD) and periodical follow-up. RESULTS: Forty-six subjects were found salivary tTGAb-positive and 16 border-line. Forty-five of 46 and 5 of 15 of them were also serum antibody-positive. Forty-two children showed duodenal villous atrophy and 1 had only type 1 lesions. Three children started GFD without performing endoscopy. CD prevalence (including 23 previously diagnosed children with CD) was 1.2%. Considering all 65 celiacs in our sample, a silent CD was found in 64%, typical in 28%, atypical in 7%, and potential in 1%. All patients showed strict adherence to GFD, weight and stature increase, and well-being improvement. Eighty-five percent and all but 2 screening-detected children with CD had Italian parents. CONCLUSIONS: Our sample size, representative of primary schoolchildren of our region, demonstrated that CD prevalence is growing in Italy, with a modified clinical spectrum and iceberg deepness.},

   abstract = {The aim of this study was to assess the accuracy of serological tests in combination with clinical symptoms for diagnosing celiac disease (CD) according to the new proposed European Society for Pediatric Gastroenterology, Hepatology and Nutrition (ESPGHAN) criteria. We retrospectively assessed children and adolescents aged 16 months -19 years who were examined for suspicion of CD (n = 345). Evaluation of clinical symptoms and the presence of tissue transglutaminase (anti-TG-IgA) and endomysial antibodies (EMA-IgA) as well as intestinal biopsies was performed in all patients. Human leukocyte antigens (HLAs) were not included. Among 345 biopsied children, 213 (62 %) children had anti-TG titers >10 times the upper limit of normal (ULN) and positive EMA antibodies. Ninety-nine (29 %) children also had symptoms suggestive of CD in addition to EMA positivity and elevated titers of anti-TG >10 times the ULN. In patients who were asymptomatic, but positive for EMA, and had anti-TG antibodies >10 times the ULN, the specificity of tests for Marsh 2-3 was only 85 %, while in symptomatic patients with the same antibodies levels, the specificity was 99 %. Conclusion: Our results reveal that intestinal biopsies could be omitted in 28 % of patients when the new ESPGHAN guidelines are applied. Due to high accuracy of serological tests in combination with clinical symptoms for diagnosis of CD, the new guideline seems to be applicable even without the use of HLA testing.},

There is limited evidence and guidance on the effective management of these patients. We describe a case of severe RCD in our hospital, with symptoms controlled effectively only by total parenteral nutrition (TPN). This 68-year-old woman initially presented to the clinic with persistent non-bloody diarrhoea and vomiting. A diagnosis of coeliac disease was confirmed with a positive tissue transglutaminase assay and histology. A strict gluten-free diet was ineffective and she represented 6 months later with 13 kg weight loss (16.7%), ongoing abdominal pain and diarrhoea, with bowels opening 16 times a day. She was oedematous, had an albumin of 12 g/l and required hospital admission. She was treated for pancreatic insufficiency and presumptively for small bowel bacterial overgrowth with no resolution of symptoms. We ruled out infectious causes and investigated for small bowel malignancy; all results were negative. Small bowel enteroscopy showed ulcerative jejunitis. She was given 5 days of TPN, following which her symptoms improved and albumin normalised. This was sustained with symptom resolution and weight gain seen at follow-up. TPN successfully and rapidly induced remission in this case. Thus, a short period of TPN should be considered as a potential component of management in patients with severe RCD.},

   abstract = {PURPOSE: To investigate whether breast-milk composition and microbiota differ in healthy mothers and mothers with celiac disease (CD) to ultimately contribute to identify additional factors determining CD risk. METHODS: Breast-milk samples from healthy mothers (n = 12) and mothers with CD (n = 12) were collected. Cytokines and secretory immunoglobulin A (sIgA) were analyzed by bead-arrays and flow cytometry and human milk oligosaccharides (HMOs) were assessed by capillary electrophoresis with laser-induced fluorescence (CE-LIF) detection. Breast-milk microbiota composition was analyzed by conventional and quantitative real-time PCR. RESULT: Breast milk from CD mothers showed significantly lower levels of interleukin (IL) 12p70 (P < 0.042), transforming growth factor (TGF)-beta1 (P < 0.018) and sIgA (P < 0.003) and almost significantly lower levels of interferon (IFN)-gamma (P < 0.058). Six mothers in each group belonged to the secretor Le(a-b+) type, one to the secretor Le(a-b-) type and five to the non-secretor Le(a+b-) type. CD mothers of non-secretor Le(a+b-) type showed increased Lacto-N-tetraose content (P < 0.042) compared with healthy mothers. CD mothers' milk showed reduced gene copy numbers of Bifidobacterium spp. (P < 0.026) and B. fragilis group (P < 0.044). CONCLUSION: CD mothers' breast milk is characterized by a reduced abundance of immunoprotective compounds (TGF-beta1 and sIgA) and bifidobacteria. The reduction in these components could theoretically diminish the protective effects of breast-feeding on the child's future risk of developing CD.},

   abstract = {Interactions between the immune system and the intestinal microbiota may play a role in coeliac disease (CD). In the present study, the potential effects of Bifidobacterium longum CECT 7347 in children with newly diagnosed CD were evaluated. A double-blind, randomised, placebo-controlled trial was conducted in thirty-three children who received a capsule containing either B. longum CECT 7347 (10(9) colony-forming units) or placebo (excipients) daily for 3 months together with a gluten-free diet (GFD). Outcome measures (baseline and post-intervention) included immune phenotype of peripheral blood cells, serum cytokine concentration, faecal secretory IgA (sIgA) content, anthropometric parameters and intestinal microbiota composition. Comparisons between the groups revealed greater height percentile increases (P= 0.048) in the B. longum CECT 7347 group than in the placebo group, as well as decreased peripheral CD3(+) T lymphocytes (P= 0.004) and slightly reduced TNF-alpha concentration (P= 0.067). Within-group comparisons of baseline and final values did not reveal any differences in T lymphocytes and cytokines in the placebo group, while decreased CD3(+) (P =0.013) and human leucocyte antigen (HLA)-DR(+) T lymphocytes (P =0.029) and slightly reduced TNF-alpha concentration (P= 0.085) were detected in the B. longum CECT 7347 group. Comparison between the groups showed that the administration of B. longum CECT 7347 reduced the numbers of the Bacteroides fragilis group (P= 0.020) and the content of sIgA in stools (P= 0.011) compared with the administration of placebo. Although this is a first exploratory intervention with limitations, the findings suggest that B. longum CECT 7347 could help improve the health status of CD patients who tend to show alterations in gut microbiota composition and a biased immune response even on a GFD.},

   abstract = {Intestinal microbiota may influence human physiology and disease risk due to the role it plays in mediating appropriate immune responses to harmful and innocuous antigens. Colonisation of the intestine in early life seems particularly important as it is the main environmental stimulus for immune system maturation. This is a dynamic process, which depends on both environmental and genetic factors. The pathogenesis of inflammatory bowel disease, such as Crohn's disease, involves genetic polymorphisms (e.g. CARD15/nucleotide-binding oligomerisation domain 2) related to an excessive inflammatory response to commensal microbiota and to its unbalanced composition. Atopic diseases have also been linked to imbalances in microbiota and to related genetic factors (e.g. TLR4 and CD14 genes), although these associations are still controversial. Research into the relationship between the genetic risk of developing celiac disease (human leukocyte antigen (HLA)-DQ2/DQ8) and the early colonisation process in infants at family risk of the disease has also reported that the HLA-DQ genotype could influence staphylococcal colonisation. Future observational studies considering both host genetics and microbiota could be critical in defining the complex host-microbe interactions and the respective role each plays in inflammatory disorders.},

   abstract = {OBJECTIVE: Intestinal dysbiosis has been associated with coeliac disease (CD), but whether the alterations are cause or consequence of the disease is unknown. This study investigated whether the human leukocyte antigen (HLA)-DQ2 genotype is an independent factor influencing the early gut microbiota composition of healthy infants at family risk of CD. DESIGN: As part of a larger prospective study, a subset (n=22) of exclusively breastfed and vaginally delivered infants with either high genetic risk (HLA-DQ2 carriers) or low genetic risk (non-HLA-DQ2/8 carriers) of developing CD were selected from a cohort of healthy infants with at least one first-degree relative with CD. Infant faecal microbiota was analysed by 16S rRNA gene pyrosequencing and real time quantitative PCR. RESULTS: Infants with a high genetic risk had significantly higher proportions of Firmicutes and Proteobacteria and lower proportions of Actinobacteria compared with low-risk infants. At genus level, high-risk infants had significantly less Bifidobacterium and unclassified Bifidobacteriaceae proportions and more Corynebacterium, Gemella, Clostridium sensu stricto, unclassified Clostridiaceae, unclassified Enterobacteriaceae and Raoultella proportions. Quantitative real time PCR also revealed lower numbers of Bifidobacterium species in infants with high genetic risk than in those with low genetic risk. In high-risk infants negative correlations were identified between Bifidobacterium species and several genera of Proteobacteria (Escherichia/Shigella) and Firmicutes (Clostridium). CONCLUSIONS: The genotype of infants at family risk of developing CD, carrying the HLA-DQ2 haplotypes, influences the early gut microbiota composition. This finding suggests that a specific disease-biased host genotype may also select for the first gut colonisers and could contribute to determining disease risk.},

   abstract = {Celiac disease (CD) is an autoimmune-mediated enteropathy triggered by dietary gluten in genetically prone individuals. The current treatment for CD is a strict lifelong gluten-free diet. However, in some CD patients following a strict gluten-free diet, the symptoms do not remit. These cases may be refractory CD or due to gluten contamination; however, the lack of response could be related to other dietary ingredients, such as maize, which is one of the most common alternatives to wheat used in the gluten-free diet. In some CD patients, as a rare event, peptides from maize prolamins could induce a celiac-like immune response by similar or alternative pathogenic mechanisms to those used by wheat gluten peptides. This is supported by several shared features between wheat and maize prolamins and by some experimental results. Given that gluten peptides induce an immune response of the intestinal mucosa both in vivo and in vitro, peptides from maize prolamins could also be tested to determine whether they also induce a cellular immune response. Hypothetically, maize prolamins could be harmful for a very limited subgroup of CD patients, especially those that are non-responsive, and if it is confirmed, they should follow, in addition to a gluten-free, a maize-free diet.},

   abstract = {Celiac disease (CD) is widespread and is often under diagnosed. It can affect a variety of genetically susceptible people from the young to the old. Presently, the only treatment for celiac patients is lifelong avoidance of any food, drink, sauce, or dressing containing gluten. Scientists and technologists continue in their quest to improve the quality of gluten-free products. Their main goal is to create a product of a similar standard to the gluten-containing products, currently on the market. However, the quality of these products still tends to be poor. Bread products have a low volume, pale crust, crumbly texture, bland flavor and a high rate of staling. Other gluten-free products contain minimal nutrition and substandard product characteristics, for example, pasta having an inferior texture, sauces which separate more easily. The main focus of this review is to discuss the most recent advances in gluten-free research which have arisen between the years 2011 and 2013. In particular, the manuscript focuses on ingredients and processing methods which have been documented to develop or improve the processing characteristics and nutritional properties of gluten-free products.},

   abstract = {The development of gluten-free bread creates many challenges; producing bread that will match the properties of its wheat counterpart can be difficult. Fruit by-products are know from literature to contain a high level of dietary fibre which could improve the bread properties and fibre contents of gluten-free bread. Therefore, a mathematical design was created; three variables were identified from preliminary tests (water (85-100% flour weight, OP 0-8% flour weight and proofing time 35-100 min) as being crucial in the development of acceptable bread. Results illustrated longer proofing times (p<0.05) and lower orange pomace levels (OP) (p<0.001) produced a bread with a greater specific volume. OP had the most significant (p<0.0001) effect on hardness at 2h and 24h post-baking. The optimised formulation was calculated to contain 5.5% OP, 94.6% water and a proofing time of 49 min. Total fibre content of the control bread (2.1%) was successfully increased t o 3.9% in the OP containing bread. Substituting gluten-free flours with orange pomace flour can help improve the total dietary intake of a coeliac while not negating on the quality properties of the bread.},

   abstract = {Malabsorption encompasses dysfunctions occurring during the digestion and absorption of nutrients. A small proportion of patients presents with chronic diarrhoea. A clinical history supportive of malabsorption may guide investigations toward either the small bowel or pancreas. Serological testing for coeliac disease will determine most cases without invasive investigations. In the clinical context of persisting weight loss and malnutrition, small bowel enteropathy may be investigated with small intestinal biopsies. Small bowel absorptive capacity and permeability might be measured by oral sugar-mix ingestion. Further, approaches to the investigation of malabsorption might also involve the detection in faeces of a substance that has not been absorbed. A variation of the latter is the use of breath testing which relies on the breakdown of the malabsorbed test substance by colonic flora. Measurement of protein absorption is difficult and unreliable; it is, therefore, rarely advocated in clinical settings. No single biological marker confirming a diagnosis of small bowel malabsorption or small bowel integrity is presently available in clinical practice. Plasma citrulline concentration, an amino acid not incorporated into endogenous or exogenous proteins, has been extensively used in research studies and supportive results are establishing its concentration as a reliable quantitative biomarker of enterocyte absorptive capacity.},

Social media represents potentially unique communication interface between gastroenterologists and active social media users - especially young adults and adolescents with celiac disease-regarding adherence to the strict gluten-free diet, gastrointestinal symptoms, and meaningful discussion about disease management. Yet, various social media platforms may be underutilized for research purposes to collect patient-reported outcomes data. In this commentary, we summarize the scientific rationale and potential for future growth of social media in patient-reported outcomes research, focusing on college freshmen with celiac disease as a case study and provide overview of the methodological approach. Finally, we discuss how social media may impact patient care in the future through increasing mobile technology use.},

   abstract = {BACKGROUND & AIMS: Patients with asymptomatic or poorly managed celiac disease can experience bone loss, placing them at risk for hip and vertebral fractures. We analyzed the cost-effectiveness of universal serologic screening (USS) vs symptomatic at-risk screening (SAS) strategies for celiac disease because of the risk of nontraumatic hip and vertebral fractures if untreated or undiagnosed. METHODS: We developed a lifetime Markov model of the screening strategies, each with male or female cohorts of 1000 patients who were 12 years old when screening began. We screened serum samples for levels of immunoglobulin A, compared with tissue transglutaminase and total immunoglobulin A, and findings were confirmed by mucosal biopsy. Transition probabilities and quality of life estimates were obtained from the literature. We used generalizable cost estimates and Medicare reimbursement rates and ran deterministic and probabilistic sensitivity analyses. RESULTS: For men, the average lifetime costs were $8532 and $8472 for USS and SAS strategies, respectively, corresponding to average quality-adjusted life year gains of 25.511 and 25.515. Similarly for women, costs were $11,383 and $11,328 for USS and SAS strategies, respectively, corresponding to quality-adjusted life year gains of 25.74 and 25.75. Compared with the current standard of care (SAS), USS produced higher average lifetime costs and lower quality of life for each sex. Deterministic and probabilistic sensitivity analyses showed that the model was robust to realistic changes in all the variables, making USS cost-ineffective on the basis of these outcomes. CONCLUSIONS: USS and SAS are similar in lifetime costs and quality of life, although the current SAS strategy was overall more cost-effective in preventing bone loss and fractures among patients with undiagnosed or subclinical disease. On the basis of best available supportive evidence, it is more cost-effective to maintain the standard celiac screening practices, although future robust population-based evidence in other health outcomes could be leveraged to reevaluate current screening guidelines.},

OBJECTIVE: To translate and adapt CCHS questionnaire to be used by the Spanish-speaking population since it is a specific questionnaire for celiac disease. METHOD: To adapt the CCHS, which consists of 76 items divided into 11 different sections, was performed using translation-back-translation method and after being reviewed and agreed proceeded to conduct a pilot test with 25 people with celiac disease, individually and a member of the research group to assess the understanding of the items and their sections. The contributions were introduced, setting the final questionnaire. RESULTS: The greatest difficulty in the translation in question occurred where there were active and trade names of drugs, opting for it to those marketed nationwide. On the other hand, for the pilot study questionnaire showed a good value of the naturalness of understanding with values between 8.4 and 10.0. CONCLUSIONS: The specific tool CHCS allow the use of a questionnaire that can be used by the Spanish speaking population studies, clinical trials or health professional practice everyday, allowing a better understanding of the health of celiacs.},

   abstract = {Celiac disease is a chronic, immune-mediated disorder, characterized by small intestinal inflammation and villous atrophy after the ingestion of gluten by genetically susceptible individuals. Several extraintestinal manifestations have been associated to celiac disease. Eosinophilic esophagitis is a primary disorder of the esophagus characterized by upper gastrointestinal symptoms, absence of gastroesophageal reflux disease and more than 15 eosinophils per high-power field in biopsy specimens. Both celiac disease and eosinophilic esophagitis are caused by aberrant, but distinct, immune responses to ingested antigens and can be responsive to restricted food intake. The aim of this review is to assess whether there is an association between these two pathologies. In the majority of the studies examined, including the studies in pediatric population, the prevalence of eosinophilic esophagitis in subjects with celiac disease was about 10-times that of the general population. We suggest searching for eosinophilic esophagitis in all children undergoing endoscopy for suspicious celiac disease.},

   abstract = {Gluten-free diet (GFD) is the cornerstone treatment for celiac disease (CD). GFD implies a strict and lifelong elimination from the diet of gluten, the storage protein found in wheat, barley, rye and hybrids of these grains, such as kamut and triticale. The absence of gluten in natural and processed foods, despite being the key aspect of GFD, may lead to nutritional consequences, such as deficits and imbalances. The nutritional adequacy of GFD is particularly important in children, this the age being of maximal energy and nutrient requirements for growth, development and activity. In recent years, attention has focused on the nutritional quality of gluten-free products (GFPs) available in the market. It is well recognized that GFPs are considered of lower quality and poorer nutritional value compared to the gluten-containing counterparts. The present review focuses on the nutritional adequacy of GFD at the pediatric age, with the aim being to increase awareness of the potential complications associated with this diet, to identify strategies in order to avoid them and to promote a healthier diet and lifestyle in children with CD.},

Pseudocereals are receiving considerable attention as interesting alternatives for the formulation of gluten-free products, and quinoa grains arise as nutritive substitutes of conventional cereals. The aim of this study was the characterization of different quinoa samples corresponding to 11 quinoa varieties, using polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis in the presence of sodium dodecyl sulfate (SDS-PAGE) and immunoblotting techniques to assess their suitability for celiac subjects. Some of these varieties were grown in Italy to assess if the reproduction in a new habitat can guarantee the retention of the "safe" protein pattern. None of the quinoa varieties studied presented protein bands with electrophoretic mobility comparable with those of wheat gliadins, the toxic protein for celiac subjects. All the quinoa samples showed a low binding affinity for both specific anti-gliadin antibodies and IgAs from celiac subjects, confirming that quinoa can be considered as a safe ingredient for celiac patients. However, reliable varieties should be previously selected since the immuno cross-reactivity with anti-gliadin antibodies can vary significantly.},

   abstract = {Although malabsorption is generally considered to be a gastrointestinal problem, the effects of malabsorption extend far beyond the gastrointestinal tract and can include neurologic dysfunction. Malabsorption may occur by a variety of mechanisms, both genetic and acquired, that interfere with the absorption of basic nutrients, vitamins, minerals, and trace elements. Disorders that interfere with fat absorption can lead to neurologic dysfunction as a consequence of associated impairment of fat-soluble vitamin absorption. Thus, individuals with genetic vitamin E deficiency and the familial hypocholesterolemias may develop symptoms of peripheral neuropathy, cerebellar ataxia, and other neurologic signs and symptoms. Disease processes that damage the enteric mucosa and produce malabsorption can trigger neurologic dysfunction both by immune-related processes, as in celiac disease, and by impairing absorption of essential vitamins and other nutrients, as in tropical sprue. Deficiencies of water-soluble vitamins, such as thiamine and niacin, can also develop in the setting of malabsorption and lead to neurologic dysfunction. Neurologists are aware of the neurologic damage that copper excess can cause in Wilson's disease, but copper deficiency due to malabsorption can also produce neurologic dysfunction in the form of myelopathy. It is vitally important for neurologists to be aware of the potential for malabsorptive processes to produce neurologic dysfunction, because effective treatment for such disorders is often available.},

   abstract = {PURPOSE: In addition to genetic risk, environmental factors might influence coeliac disease (CD) development. We sought to assess the effect of the interaction between milk-feeding practices and the HLA-DQ genotype on peripheral lymphocyte subsets and their activation markers in infants at familial risk for CD. METHODS: 170 newborns were classified in 3 different genetic risk groups (high risk, HR; intermediate risk, IR; and low risk, LR) after DQB1 and DQA1 typing. Lymphocyte subsets were studied at the age of 4 months by flow cytometry analysis. RESULTS: 79 infants were receiving exclusive breastfeeding (BF) and 91 partial breastfeeding or formula feeding (FF). Regarding genetic risk, 40 infants were classified in HR group, 75 in IR group and 55 in LR group. Two-way ANOVA did not show significant interactions between the type of milk feeding and genetic risk group on the lymphocyte subsets analysed. One-way ANOVA for milk-feeding practice alone showed that the percentage of CD4 + CD25+ cells was significantly higher in BF group than in FF group (BF, 10.92 +/- 2.71; FF, 9.94 +/- 2.96; p = 0.026), and absolute counts of CD4 + CD38+ cells were significantly higher in FF group than in BF group (FF, 2,881.23 +/- 973.48; BF, 2,557.95 +/- 977.06; p = 0.038). One-way ANOVA for genetic risk alone showed that absolute counts of NK cells were significantly higher in IR group than HR and LR groups (IR, 539.24 +/- 340.63; HR, 405.01 +/- 239.53; LR, 419.86 +/- 262.85; p = 0.028). CONCLUSION: Lymphocyte subset profiles in the early stages of life could be modulated by milk-feeding practices and genetic risk separately. Breastfeeding might have a positive immunomodulatory effect on lymphocyte subsets in infants at risk of CD.},

   abstract = {INTRODUCTION: It is known that the HLA genotype can explain about a 40% of the genetic risk of celiac disease (CD), thus, other genetic predisposing factors as well as factors that subtly modulate T cell activation and differentiation need to be studied. This includes environmental factors that are currently believed to impact on the immune system and gut microbiota development. AIM: To assess the associations between early environmental factors (EEF), lymphocyte subsets, and intestinal microbiota composition in infants at familial risk for CD. STUDY DESIGN: Prospective observational study. SUBJECTS: Fifty-five 4 month-old infants with at least a first-degree relative suffering CD. Infants were classified according to type of delivery, mother's antibiotic intake during pregnancy and during labor, milk-feeding practices, early infections and antibiotic intake, rotavirus vaccine administration, and allergy incidence within the first 18 months of life. METHODS: Lymphocyte subsets and gut microbiota composition were studied at the age of 4 months. RESULTS: Formula feeding and infant's infections were associated with higher CD3+, CD4+, CD4+CD38+, CD4+CD28+ and CD3+CD4+CD45RO+ counts (P0.01). Infant s infections were also associated with higher CD4+CD25+, CD4+HLA-DR+ and NK cell counts (P0.01). Cesarean delivery and rotavirus vaccine administration were associated with lower percentage of CD4+CD25+ cells. Infant's antibiotic intake was associated and correlated with lower counts of Bifidobacterium longum and higher counts of Bacteroides fragilis group. CONCLUSIONS: Infant s infections and antibiotic intake in the first 4 months of life are the EEF more strongly and/or frequently associated to lymphocyte subpopulations and microbiota composition, respectively, in infants at risk of CD.},

   abstract = {BACKGROUND: The present study aimed to determine whether psychological well-being and weight-teasing history of young adults with bowel conditions (i.e. coeliac disease, inflammatory bowel diseases and irritable bowel syndrome) differed from those without bowel conditions. METHODS: Young adults (aged 18-26 years) completed an online survey that collected demographic information and assessed psychological well-being (mentally and physically unhealthy days, self-esteem, and depression, anxiety and obsessive compulsive disorder severity) and weight-teasing history (Perception of Teasing Scale). Each bowel condition participant (cases = 135) was matched to four healthy participants (controls = 504) based on sex and body mass index (BMI) (+/-0.50 BMI units). Conditional logistic regression analyses were conducted and odds ratios (OR) and 95% confidence intervals (CI) were presented for all measures and demographics. RESULTS: Cases were significantly more likely to have poorer overall psychological well-being. Specifically, cases were significantly (P </= 0.05) more likely to have more mentally and physical unhealthy days, depression, anxiety, and obsessive compulsive disorder symptoms than controls. Cases were also significantly more likely to recall being weight teased as a child (P = 0.02, OR = 1.26, 95% CI = 1.04-1.53) and being more upset from the weight-teasing insults (P = 0.006, OR = 1.19, 95% CI = 1.05-1.35) than controls. Cases were also more than 1.5 times more likely to be made fun of (P = 0.03, OR = 1.63, 95% CI = 1.09-2.43) or laughed at (P = 0.01, OR = 1.77, 95% CI = 1.15-2.73) because of their weight than controls. CONCLUSIONS: The findings of the present study suggest that healthcare providers should monitor the psychological well-being of young adults with bowel conditions and incorporate opportunities for them to develop skills and strategies for coping.},

Although it remains unclear whether the prevalence of eating disorders is higher in those with DRCHCs compared with the general population, overall findings suggest that young people with DRCHCs may be at risk of endorsing disordered eating behaviors that may lead to diagnosis of an eating disorder and other health problems over the course of their treatment. Thus, health care providers should be aware that young people with DRCHCs may be at risk of eating disorders and carefully monitor psychological changes and the use of unhealthy weight control methods. It is also important to develop and evaluate theory-based interventions and disease-specific eating disorder risk screening tools that are effective in halting the progression of eating disorders and negative health outcomes in young people with chronic health conditions.},

The current communication presents a review of published studies in recent years on the topic and looks at possible future trends in the improved nutritional and health qualities which have been applied in the bakery industry, directing it further to the formulation design and production of functional breads. The results show that many beneficial ingredients such as dietary fibers, phenolic antioxidants, marine ingredients, and n-3 fatty acids can be used in the bread industry to increase its functionality and result in healthy products, low in calories, cholesterol and celiac disease. Moreover, the use of psyllium seed, amaranth seed, chestnut flour and prebiotics in gluten-free bread (GFB) baking may be the promising frontier to improve overall appearance, quality, sensory properties, and shelf-life of GFB.},

   abstract = {OBJECTIVE: To assess patient and parent satisfaction with a primarily nurse- and dietitian-led celiac disease clinic in a tertiary pediatric centre. METHODS: An online survey was sent to families and patients attending the Stollery Children's Hospital's Multidisciplinary Pediatric Celiac Clinic (Edmonton, Alberta) since 2007. The survey focused on clinic attendance, satisfaction with clinic structure, processes, and education and preference for alternatives to the current process. Respondents were asked to rank satisfaction or preference on a five-point Likert scale, with 1 being lowest and 5 being highest. RESULTS: Most satisfaction related to follow-up with serology (4.6) and with a dietitian (4.3). The most preferred changes included either meeting the entire multidisciplinary team after the biopsy (4.7), or meeting with only the dietitian and nurse after the biopsy (4.4). The preferred education resources were the Internet (4.3) and the dietitian (4.2). The mean overall satisfaction score of the Multidisciplinary Pediatric Celiac Clinic was 4.0. CONCLUSIONS: Results of the present survey suggested that patients and families value a multidisciplinary follow-up clinic for children with celiac disease. In particular, feedback based on repeat blood work and regular contact with a dietitian were highly valued. The present survey, outlining the most valued aspects of the clinic, may be useful for service delivery in other regions. In addition, it provides information on how to better support pediatric patients with celiac disease.},

While there is a large pool of patients with celiac disease in India, until now, only a fraction of them have been diagnosed. With increasing awareness about celiac disease amongst health care providers and the general population, a massive increase in the number of patients with celiac disease is expected now and in the subsequent decade in India. While the number of patients with celiac disease is increasing, the country's preparedness towards the emerging epidemic of this disease is minimal. There are a number of issues, which requires urgent attention. Some of the key issues include increased awareness amongst health care professionals and the general public about the disease and its management, team-based management of patients with celiac disease, proper counseling and supervision of patients, training of dietitians in the management of patients with celiac disease, industrial production of reliable and affordable gluten-free food, and food labeling for gluten contents.},

   abstract = {BACKGROUND: The transcription factor 7-like 2 (TCF7L2) gene has the strongest genetic association with type 2 diabetes. TCF7L2 also associates with latent autoimmune diabetes in adults, which often presents with a single islet autoantibody, but not with classical type 1 diabetes. METHODS: We aimed to test if TCF7L2 is associated with single islet autoantibody expression in pediatric type 1 diabetes. We studied 71 prospectively recruited children who had newly diagnosed type 1 diabetes and evidence of islet autoimmunity, that is, expressed >/=1 islet autoantibody to insulin, glutamic acid decarboxylase 65, islet cell autoantigen 512, or zinc transporter 8. TCF7L2 rs7903146 alleles were identified. Data at diagnosis were cross-sectionally analyzed. RESULTS: We found that 21.1% of the children with autoimmune type 1 diabetes expressed a single islet autoantibody. The distribution of TCF7L2 rs7903146 genotypes in children with a single autoantibody (n=15) was 40% CC, 26.7% CT and 33.3% TT, compared with children with >/=2 islet autoantibodies (50% CC, 42.9% CT and 7.1% TT, p=0.024). Furthermore, compared with children with >/=2 autoantibodies, single-autoantibody children had characteristics reflecting milder autoimmune destruction of beta-cells. Restricting to lean children (body mass index<85th centile; n=36), 45.5% of those expressing a single autoantibody were rs7903146 TT homozygotes, compared with 0% of those with >/=2 autoantibodies (p<0.0001). CONCLUSION: These results suggest that, in children with only mild islet autoimmunity, mechanisms associated with TCF7L2 genetic variation contribute to diabetogenesis, and this contribution is larger in the absence of obesity.},

MATERIAL AND METHODS: The study included a cohort of 25 individuals aged 20-54. Nutrient intakes were assessed based on a 24-hour diet recall interview and an original questionnaire prepared by the authors specifically for this study. Anthropometric measurements were recorded in order to assess the nutritional status of the patients. RESULTS AND DISCUSSION: A low energy intake and an excessive share of fat were observed in daily food rations of coeliac disease patients. Uptake of most minerals with the diet was too low, while that of vitamins too high. Most participants declared the administration of supplements, which greatly contributed to the coverage of requirements for these nutrients. CONCLUSIONS: It was observed that the administered supplementation was frequently unjustified, which led to the allowances being considerably exceeded for many vitamins and minerals.},

Although more common among children, intussusception has not been linked with childhood CD aside from isolated case reports. Our aim was to investigate the frequency of IS among children with CD. METHODS: A patient database containing children with biopsy-proven CD was reviewed, in addition to radiology records contained in a hospital-maintained clinical data repository. RESULTS: Of 254 children with biopsy-proven CD and complete records available for review, abdominal imaging was performed in 21%, mainly because of abdominal pain. Among children with CD, 1.2% experienced an IS <9 months before their diagnosis with CD. Among children seen at our institution in the same time period, 0.07% experienced an IS. The majority of those children with CD who were found to have IS had no evidence of nutritional deficit at the time of IS. IS was not identified in any children with CD who had been treated with a gluten-free diet. CONCLUSIONS: IS was far more common among children in our cohort with untreated CD than in the general pediatric population simultaneously seen at our center. The diagnosis of CD should be considered in children with IS, even in the absence of signs of nutritional compromise.},

   abstract = {Celiac disease (CD) is an autoimmune disorder of the small intestine with highly variable clinical presentation and frequently associated with various immune-mediated diseases. Among these immune-mediated diseases, atopy has been found frequently in individuals with CD. We aimed to study the prevalence of CD in Estonian children with atopic dermatitis (AD), a common multifactorial chronic inflammatory skin disease. We recruited 351 consecutive children with active AD (mean age 5.8 yrs, 57.6% boys) at Tallinn Children's Hospital, Estonia. Sera of all patients were tested for total serum immunoglobulin (Ig) A, for IgA- and IgG-type autoantibodies to tissue transglutaminase (IgA-anti-TG2, IgG-anti-TG2) and to deamidated gliadin peptides (IgA-anti-DGP, IgG-anti-DGP). The diagnosis of CD was confirmed histologically by small intestine biopsy according to the European Society of Paediatric Gastroenterology, Hepatology and Nutrition diagnostic criteria. IgA deficiency was detected in nine patients with AD (2.6%), none of whom had IgG-anti-TG2 or IgG-anti-DGP seropositivity. IgA-anti-TG2 positivity was found in 4 (1.1%), IgG-anti-TG2 positivity in 2 (0.6%), IgA-anti-DGP positivity in 11 (3.1%), and IgG-anti-DGP in 10 (2.8%) patients. Celiac disease was confirmed in five (1.4%) patients with AD (95% confidence interval 0.46, 3.32) and all were histologically characterized as Marsh IIIa-IIIc stages and two presented with silent CD. In AD patients, CD prevalence was more than four times as high as in previously studied randomly selected schoolchildren in Estonia. Two patients with AD diagnosed with CD had no symptoms indicative of CD, in spite of extensive histologic changes in the small intestine mucosa. Therefore our study emphasizes the need for evaluating the cost-effectiveness of screening individuals with AD for CD in time to prevent long-term complications.},

   abstract = {Coeliac disease (CD) patients may exhibit a pro-inflammatory profile and fatty acids (FA) can influence inflammation through a variety of cellular pathways in them. The aims of the present study were to (1) evaluate the FA composition of erythrocytes obtained from newly diagnosed CD patients by lipidomic analysis and compare it with that in healthy subjects and (2) determine the effects of 1-year gluten-free diet (GFD) intervention. A total of twenty CD patients (five men and fifteen women; mean age 34.0 (sem 1.7) years) were evaluated at diagnosis and after 1 year of GFD intervention. A total of twenty healthy subjects (seven men and thirteen women; mean age 40.2 (sem 2.5) years) served as controls. CD patients on an unrestricted diet exhibited a significant 2.08-fold higher concentration of arachidic acid when compared with healthy subjects, suggesting that it can be considered as a putative marker of CD. Besides, the arachidonic acid (AA):dihomo-gamma-linolenic acid ratio was 2.01-fold significantly lower in CD patients than in healthy subjects (P< 0.01), underlying an inefficient synthesis of PUFA from their precursors in terms of desaturase activity. In addition, mainly due to lower concentrations of docosahexaenoic acid, the inflammation marker AA:docosahexaenoic acid ratio was 1.40-fold significantly higher in CD patients than in healthy subjects. After 1 year of GFD intervention, FA concentrations in CD patients were still different from those observed in healthy subjects. The lipidomic analysis of erythrocyte membranes confirmed the presence of an altered FA composition in CD patients and the GFD's ability to modify FA profile, even if 1-year GFD intervention seems to be not sufficient to restore FA concentrations to normality. This procedure, being easier and non-invasive compared with the evaluation of the FA pattern of the intestinal mucosa, could offer more potentiality for also evaluating therapeutic interventions in CD patients by using FA supplementation.},

   abstract = {Celiac disease, with a prevalence around 1% of the general population, is the most common genetically-induced food intolerance in the world. Triggered by the ingestion of gluten in genetically predisposed individuals, this enteropathy may appear at any age, and is characterized by a wide variety of clinical signs and symptoms. Among them, gastrointestinal presentations include chronic diarrhea, abdominal pain, weight loss or failure to thrive in children; but extra-intestinal manifestations are also common, and actually appear to be on the rise. They include a large variety of ailments, such as dermatitis Herpetiformis, anemia, short stature, osteoporosis, arthritis, neurologic problems, unexplained elevation of transaminases, and even female infertility. For the clinician interested in oral diseases, celiac disease can lead to delayed tooth eruption, dental enamel hypoplasia, recurrent oral aphthae. Diagnosing celiac disease requires therefore a high degree of suspicion followed by a very sensitive screening test: serum levels of the autoantibody anti-tissue transglutaminase. A positive subject will then be confirmed by an intestinal biopsy, and will then be put on a strict gluten-free diet, that in most cases will bring a marked improvement of symptoms. Newer forms of treatment which in the future will probably be available to the non-responsive patients are currently being actively pursued.},

As estimated by R5-ELISA, the degree of degradation of immune reactive gluten was ca. 28%. Two-dimensional electrophoresis and RP-FPLC analyses showed marked variations of the protein fractions compared to the untreated flour. The comparison was also extended to in vitro effect of the peptic/tryptic-digests towards K562 and T84 cells. The flour with the intermediate content of gluten (ICG) was used for bread making, and compared to whole gluten (WG) bread. The chemical, structural and sensory features of the ICG bread approached those of the bread made with WG flour. The protein digestibility of the ICG bread was higher than that from WG flour. Also the nutritional quality, as estimated by different indexes, was the highest for ICG bread.},

   abstract = {BACKGROUND: Coeliac disease can be controlled only through adherence to a gluten-free diet. This diet is highly restrictive and can be challenging to maintain. It has been linked with elevated levels of psychological distress, including depression, anxiety and social phobia. METHODS: Narratives on living with coeliac disease were written by 130 adult members of Coeliac UK (mean age 52.7 years; mean time since diagnosis 10.2 years; 67% sample female; 28% male). Qualitative analysis using grounded theory methods identified five key categories: living with widespread ignorance; social invisibility; creating a coeliac community; a changed identity; grief - and accepting the trade-off. RESULTS: A psychosocial model of living with coeliac disease was constructed from the findings, the central category of which was the changed identity of those diagnosed with the condition. Grief was experienced in relation to a loss of the former diet, changed personal and social identities, loss of social confidence and loss of social activities. Grief was generally mitigated over time as adjustments were made to changes in identity and lifestyle. Creating (or becoming part of) a coeliac community was a strategy enabling those with coeliac disease to re-establish their identities and increase social recognition and acceptance of the condition. CONCLUSIONS: Gluten-free living entails a substantial restriction of food choice. The losses and changes entailed impact on the personal and social identities of those living with coeliac disease, and on the behaviour of others towards them. Psychosocial interventions focussed on facilitating coping and adjustment may benefit those experiencing difficulties.},

There are no quality outcome measures (QOM) in use nationally to assess hospital management of this condition. This study applied QOM devised by the East of England paediatric gastroenterology network to 99 patients reviewed at two tertiary hospitals in the Network, to assess the quality of care provided by nurse led and doctor led care models. The average performance across all QOM was 96.2% at Addenbrooke's Hospital (AH), and 98.7% at Norfolk and Norwich Hospital (NNUH), whilst 95% (n = 18) of QOM were met. Patient satisfaction was high at both sites (uptake of questionnaire 53 of 99 patients in the study). The study showed a comparably high level of care delivered by both a nurse and doctor led service. Our quality assessment tools could be applied in the future by other centres to measure standards of care.},

   abstract = {OBJECTIVES: Celiac disease (CD) is a chronic immune-mediated enteropathy caused by the ingestion of gluten in genetically predisposed individuals. In some reports, sensorineural hearing loss (SNHL) has been identified as an extraintestinal symptom of CD. We aimed to further investigate the possible association between CD and SNHL by examining a greater number of pediatric CD patients. METHODS: The study was carried out from March to September 2014 and included 110 pediatric patients with biopsy-confirmed CD (220 ears) and 41 age- and sex-matched controls (82 ears); participants were evaluated by tympanometry and pure tone audiometry (frequency, 250-8000Hz frequency). RESULTS: Audiometric bone conduction thresholds were significantly different between the CD patients and the controls (p<0.05), but there were no significant differences in pure tone averages for air conduction (p>0.05). When the results for CD patients were analyzed according to duration of disease (</=36 months and >36 months), a significant difference in bone conduction thresholds (p<0.05) was noted, with significant increments at the later stages of disease. However, this difference was not sufficient to define clinical hearing loss, as the pure tone average thresholds remained below 20dB. CONCLUSION: These results indicate that subclinical hearing loss may be present in children with CD, which could presage more serious hearing impairments at older ages and later stages of the disease. Hearing screenings should be recommended for children with CD in order to prevent the potentially unfavorable effects of hearing loss on the emotional, behavioral, cognitive, and sensorimotor development of these patients.},

   abstract = {INTRODUCTION: The gluten-free diet has traditionally been accepted as a healthy diet, but there are articles advocating that it may have some nutritional deficiencies. The current study assesses whether there was any change in the contributions of calories, essential elements, proportion of fatty acids, vitamins, minerals and fiber in children who were diagnosed with celiac diseases, comparing the diet with gluten prior one year after diagnosis with the diet without gluten to the year of diagnosis. The level of clinical or analytical impact that nutritional deficits could have was also assessed. MATERIAL AND METHODS: A prospective,descriptive, observational study in which information was collected from a dietary survey, anthropometric and analytical data at pre-diagnosis of celiac disease and following a gluten diet and one year after celiac disease diagnosis, under gluten-free diet. RESULTS: A total of 37 patients meet the study criteria. A decrease in the intake of saturated fatty acids was found, with an increase of monounsaturated fatty acids and an increase in the intake of phosphorus in the diet without gluten. A deficient intake of vitamin D was found in both diets. Clinically, at year of gluten-free diet there was an improvement in weight and size. Analytically, there was an improvement in hemoglobin, ferritin, vitamin D, and parathyroid hormone in plasma. CONCLUSION: The gluten-free diet has minimal deficiencies, similar to those present in the diet with gluten, with an improvement in the lipid profile by increasing the proportion of monounsaturated fatty acids to the detriment of saturated fatty acids.},

METHODS: The case-control study was conducted at the Military Hospital, Rawalpindi, from October 2011 to January 2012, and analysed 25 children diagnosed to have coeliac disease as per the criteria set by the European Society of Paediatric Gastroenterology and Nutrition, which included histopathological alterations in duodenal biopsies, clinical response to gluten withdrawal, and presence of anti-endomyseal antibodies. Patients were compared with a group of 150 healthy subjects. Dioxyribonucleic acid was extracted from peripheral blood collected in ethylenediaminetetraacetic acid.K3. Human leukocyte antigen DRB1 typing was carried out on allele level (DRB1*01--DRB1*16) using sequence specific primers. Human leukocyte antigen type was determined by agarose gel electrophoresis and results were recorded. Phenotype frequency of various alleles among the patient group and the control group was calculated by direct counting, and significance of their association was determined by Fisher Exact Test. RESULTS: A total of 11 (44%) female paediatric coeliac patients in age range 1-9 (mean 7.2 +/- 4.8 years) and 14 (56%) male paediatric patients in the age range 6-14 (mean 8.6 +/- 5.1 years) were genotyped for HLA-DRB1 loci. A statistically significant positive association of the disease with HLA-DRB1*03 (n = 23; 92% versus n=31; 21% in controls, p < 0.01) was observed. CONCLUSION: HLA-DRB1*03 is associated with increased risk of developing coeliac disease.},

   abstract = {Celiac disease has become extensively studied. What could be the cause? Increasing the accuracy of diagnostic tests for celiac disease has led to more discovered cases. Serological diagnosis of celiac disease has undergone important changes in recent years. Application of serological tests has reflected the diagnostic performance of tissue transglutaminase antibody and endomysial antibody as screening tests for celiac disease but also the progress of new serological tests as the antibodies against synthetic deamidated gliadin peptides. Serological tests are largely responsible for the recognition that celiac disease is not a rare disease. The Consensus in celiac disease from 2008 conducted under the aegis of the European Society of Pediatric Gastroenterology, Hepatology and Nutrition jointly with North American Society of Pediatric Gastroenterology, Hepatology and Nutrition which agreed that "Celiac disease is an immune-mediated enteropathy that can affect any system or organ and that can present itself with a wide range of clinical manifestations of variable severity" was confirmed. But increasing prevalence of this disease has led to the need for new methods of treatment among patients with celiac disease. Studies on quality of life of patients with celiac disease have questioned the gluten-free diet. As such new therapies, like TG2 inhibitors, the copolymer P (HEMA-co-SS) and other new experimental therapies, have emerged in celiac disease. The new therapies in celiac disease are based on new investigations in gluten toxicity screening, like K562(S)-cell agglutination, A1 and G12 monoclonal antibodies and proteomics. In this paper we want to present the investigative developments in celiac disease. We also want to find whether a new treatment in celiac disease is necessary.},

   abstract = {Many recent studies overshadow the effects of gluten-free diet. Gluten-free diet positive effects were observed in celiac disease patients: increase in body mass index, higher energy intakes, reducing adiposity gain, moderates the risk of the associated complications. However, adhering to a gluten-free diet is difficult for many people. A new solution is needed for quality of life of celiac disease patients, not for celiac disease treatment. Health education on gluten-free diet at home and in society seems to be the solution. The aim of our study is to evaluate the recent research on gluten-free diet as a nutritional therapy for patients with celiac disease. To achieve this purpose we have analyzed the published studies from 2008 to the present on nutrition in celiac disease.},

   abstract = {INTRODUCTION: Gluten is a glycoprotein present in some cereals. The incidence of disorders related to gluten, including the EC, is increasing, even pathologies far from an etiology or treatment with GF D. AIMS: Review the scientific literature related to the ingestion of gluten and pathogenesis of different diseases. METHODS: A literature search in major scientific database. RESULTS: We obtained from the following diseases, gluten ataxia, multiple sclerosis, autism spectrum disorder, schizophrenia, attention deficit hyperactivity disorder, depressive disorders, headaches, irritable bowel syndrome, fibromyalgia, dermatitis herpetiformis and epilepsy, studies in which either a determination of gliadin was refered or a treatment, with/without gluten, was applied and evaluated. CONCLUSION: The ingestion of gluten seems to be related to disease, when there is no EC, SGNC or wheat allergy. Suspicions about the benefit of GF D as a complementary treatment is borne in semi-clinical trials and cohorts, either as a causal factor in the pathogenesis, or improvement of symptoms.},

   abstract = {Celiac disease (CD) is an immune-mediated enteropathy triggered by the ingestion of cereal gluten proteins. This disorder is associated with imbalances in the gut microbiota composition that could be involved in the pathogenesis of CD. The aim of this study was to characterize the composition and diversity of the cultivable duodenal mucosa-associated bacteria of CD patients and control children. Duodenal biopsy specimens from patients with active disease on a gluten-containing diet (n = 32), patients with nonactive disease after adherence to a gluten-free diet (n = 17), and controls (n = 8) were homogenized and plated on plate count agar, Wilkins-Chalgren agar, brain heart agar, or yeast, Casitone, and fatty acid agar. The isolates were identified by partial 16S rRNA gene sequencing. Renyi diversity profiles showed the highest diversity values for active CD patients, followed by nonactive CD patients and control individuals. Members of the phylum Proteobacteria were more abundant in patients with active CD than in the other child groups, while those of the phylum Firmicutes were less abundant. Members of the families Enterobacteriaceae and Staphylococcaceae, particularly the species Klebsiella oxytoca, Staphylococcus epidermidis, and Staphylococcus pasteuri, were more abundant in patients with active disease than in controls. In contrast, members of the family Streptococcaceae were less abundant in patients with active CD than in controls. Furthermore, isolates of the Streptococcus anginosus and Streptococcus mutans groups were more abundant in controls than in both CD patient groups, regardless of inflammatory status. The findings indicated that the disease is associated with the overgrowth of possible pathobionts that exclude symbionts or commensals that are characteristic of the healthy small intestinal microbiota.},

   abstract = {OBJECTIVES: The aim of this study was to evaluate hypothetical screening strategies in a Swedish celiac disease (CD) mass screening. METHODS: Of 10,041 Swedish sixth graders born in 1993 invited to a population-based CD mass screening, 7208 participated. Anti-tissue transglutaminase (tTG) immunoglobulin (Ig) A were analyzed in all children and total serum IgA (s-IgA) in 7161 children. Additional analyses of tTG-IgG, endomysial antibodies (EMA) IgA and IgG, and human leukocyte antigen (HLA) alleles were performed according to a standardized protocol. Children with elevated levels of serological markers were recommended to undergo a small intestinal biopsy to verify diagnosis, and 153 children with CD were thus identified. Sensitivity, specificity, positive predictive values (PPVs) and negative predictive values (NPVs) were calculated and receiver operating characteristic curves were plotted. RESULTS: By lowering the cutoff for tTG-IgA, 17 additional cases of CD were identified at the cost of 32 biopsies. All children with tTG-IgA >50 U/mL (10 times the recommended upper limit of normal) had gluten enteropathy. Area under the receiver operating characteristic curve for tTG-IgA was 0.988. All cases carried HLA-DQ2 or HLA-DQ8, as did 53% of the controls. For different hypothetical screening strategies, sensitivity, specificity, PPV, and NPV ranged between 87.6% and 100%, 99.5% and 99.9%, 79.7% and 89.7%, and 99.7% and 100%, respectively. Efforts to increase sensitivity by lowering tTG-IgA cutoff would result in increased number of small intestinal biopsies and lower PPV. Sequential testing for both EMA and HLA-DQ genotyping would reduce the number of negative small intestinal biopsies. CONCLUSIONS: tTG-IgA is a robust marker when used in CD mass screening and its performance can be enhanced by sequential testing for EMA or HLA-DQ genotyping.},

   abstract = {OBJECTIVE: To assess whether patients with celiac disease (CD) are more likely than controls to develop abdominal pain (AP) and AP-associated functional gastrointestinal disorders (FGID) in long-term follow-up. STUDY DESIGN: In a retrospective study, data on children (3-22 years old) with CD diagnosed between 2000 and 2010 were obtained. Parents were contacted by telephone at least 6 months after the diagnosis of CD and invited to participate in the study. Consenting parents completed: (1) a telephone questionnaire on the presence of gastrointestinal symptoms; and (2) the parent report version of the Questionnaire on Pediatric Gastrointestinal Symptoms-Rome III for cases and selected controls. RESULTS: Forty-nine cases (mean 11.3 years, 20 male participants) and 48 controls (mean 11.1 years, 24 male participants) were enrolled. Twelve children in the CD group (24.5%) and 7 children in the control group (14.6%) had AP at the time of the study (P = .3). Nine children in the CD group (18.3%) and 4 children in the control group (8.3%) met criteria for an AP-associated FGID according to the Questionnaire on Pediatric Gastrointestinal Symptoms-Rome III (P = .23). CONCLUSION: It was found that children with CD and controls have a similar risk of AP and AP-FGIDs. Methodologic limitations prevent generalization of results, but large prospective studies should confirm the findings.},

Two undigested A-gliadin peptides, P31-43 and P57-68, are central to CD pathogenesis, inducing an innate and an adaptive immune response, respectively. They enter enterocytes and localize to vesicular compartment to induce their toxic/immunogenics effects. In this article, we tested the effect of probiotic Lactobacillus paracasei (LP) CBA L74 (International Depository Accession Number LMG P-24778), its supernatant and LP-fermented cereals on gliadin peptides, P31-43 and P57-68, entrance in Caco-2 cells. Both LP CBA L74 and its supernatant inhibit P31-43 (intensity of fluorescence; FI: 75%) and P57-68 (FI: 50%) entrance in Caco2 cells, indicating that this biological effect is due to some product included in LP CBA L74 supernatant. This effect was present also after fermentation of cereals. This study describes a novel effect of probiotics in the prevention of undigested gliadin peptides toxic effects.},

After a diagnosis of celiac disease is confirmed by small bowel biopsy, patients are advised to commence a gluten-free diet (GFD). This dietary restriction may be particularly difficult for the child with diabetes, but in Europe (and in Italy) many food stores have targeted this section of the market with better labeling of products and more availability of specific GFD products. Treatment with a GFD in symptomatic patients has been shown to improve the symptoms, signs and complications of celiac disease. However, the effects of a GFD on diabetic control are less well established. Initial reports of improved hypoglycemic control were based on children who were diagnosed with celiac disease associated with malabsorption, but there have subsequently been reports of improvement in patients with type 1 diabetes with subclinical celiac disease. There are other studies reporting no effect, improved control and an improvement of hypoglycemic episodes. Moreover, in this review we wish to focus on low glycemic index foods, often suggested in people with type 1 diabetes, since they might reduce postprandial glycemic excursion and enhance long-term glycemic control. In contrast, GFD may be rich in high glycemic index foods that can increase the risk of obesity, insulin resistance and cardiovascular disease, worsening the metabolic control of the child with diabetes. Hence, it is important to evaluate the impact of a GFD on metabolic control, growth and nutritional status in children with type 1 diabetes.},

It combines symptoms associated with CD, high anti-transglutaminase type 2 antibody (anti-TG2) levels, anti-endomysium-IgA antibodies (EMA), and at-risk HLA. Our aims were (i) to evaluate retrospectively in 227 individuals (149 CD patients and 78 controls) the algorithm-1, (ii) to reduce the number of duodenal biopsies among CD patients for whom algorithm-1 is not applicable through the addition of antiactin IgA antibodies (AAA-IgA), and (iii) to evaluate prospectively algorithm-1 and AAA-IgA in 50 patients with suspected CD. Algorithm-1 identified 70 out of 149 CD patients with Marsh 3 lesions. Adding AAA-IgA to the remaining patients with anti-TG2 levels comprised between 4 and 10 times upper limit of normal (ULN) allowed the detection of further 20 patients with a Marsh 3 damage. In our prospective study, algorithm-1 identified 23 out of 50 patients, whilst further 7 were recognized adding AAA-IgA. We confirm that algorithm-1 may avoid the duodenal biopsy in many CD patients and underscores the usefulness of AAA-IgA in reducing the number of duodenal biopsies in patients with moderate anti-TG2 levels.},

   abstract = {New guidelines for celiac disease (CD) diagnosis from the European Society for Paediatric Gastroenterology, Hepatology, and Nutrition (ESPGHAN) propose the option to omit the duodenal biopsy in the diagnosis of CD. For this option, all four of the following criteria have to apply in children and adolescents: signs and symptoms suggestive of CD, anti-transglutaminase type 2 antibody (anti-TG2) levels more than 10 times the upper limit of normal, positive confirmation tests of anti-endomysium-IgA antibodies (EMA), and at-risk HLA-DQ2 or HLA-DQ8. Here, we report the case of a female patient, 2 years old, with chronic diarrhea that started after an acute viral gastroenteritis. The patient had anti-TG2 levels of more than 10 times the upper limit of normal, positivity for EMA, antigliadin IgA, and IgG (AGA-IgA, AGA-IgG, respectively), and the at-risk HLA-DRB1*0301, DQB1*0201/DRB1*10, DQB1*0501 genotype, thus fulfilling all criteria for the diagnosis of CD. Although the diarrhea disappeared after about 5 weeks, anti-TG2, EMA, and AGA-IgG remained positive. Therefore, a duodenal biopsy was performed and evidenced a normal mucosa (Marsh 0). After about 18 months, the antibody titer for AGA-IgG, anti-TG2, and EMA became negative. The patient was all the time on a normal, gluten-containing diet. This clinical case represents an exception to the new ESPGHAN guidelines for CD diagnosis. During 5 weeks, the new ESPGHAN criteria were all fulfilled, allowing to propose for this patient the diagnosis of CD without performing a duodenal biopsy. Therefore, a prudent approach is suggested when the pediatric gastroenterologist makes a diagnosis of CD without duodenal biopsy.},

In the last 10 years, the method has been extended to the pathological investigation. Stable isotope analysis to better understand a diet-related disease: celiac disease in ancient human bones was carried out. To do this, we analyzed the nitrogen and carbon isotopic composition of human (n = 37) and faunal (n = 8) bone remains from the archaeological site of Cosa at Ansedonia, on the Tyrrhenian coast near Orbetello (Tuscany), including the skeletal remains of a young woman (late 1st century-early 2nd century Common Era [CE]) with morphological and genetic features suggestive of celiac disease. We compared the young woman's isotopic data with those of other individuals recovered at the same site but from two later time periods (6th century CE; 11-12th century CE) and with literature data from other Italian archaeological sites dating to the same period. Her collagen delta(13) C and delta(15) N values differed from those of the samples at the same site, and from most but not all of the contemporary sites. Although the woman's diet appears distinct, chronic malnutrition resulting from severe malabsorption of essential nutrients due to celiac disease may have affected the isotopic composition of her bone collagen.},

   abstract = {AIM: To examine the possible ameliorative effect of breastfeeding and the uptake of human colostrum against coeliac disease in autistic rats. METHODS: Female rats were fed a standard diet and received a single intraperitoneal injection of 600 mg/kg sodium valproate on day 12.5 after conception. In study 1, neonatal rats were randomly subjected to blood tests to investigate autism. In study 2, the 1(st) group was fed by the mother after an injection of interferon-gamma (IFN-gamma) and administration of gliadin. The pups in the 2(nd) group were prevented from accessing maternal milk, injected IFN-gamma, administered gliadin, and hand-fed human colostrum. The normal littermates fed by the table mothers were injected with physiological saline and served as normal controls in this study. RESULTS: The protein concentration was higher in group 2 than in group 1 in the duodenum (161.6 +/- 9 and 135.4 +/- 7 mg/g of tissue, respectively, P < 0.01). A significant increase (P < 0.001) in body weight was detected in human colostrum-treated pups on post natal day (PND) 7 and 21 vs suckling pups in group 1. A delay in eye opening was noticed in the treated rats in group 1 on PND 13 compared with the control group and group 2. Administration of a single intraperitoneal injection of 600 mg/kg sodium valproate on day 12.5 after conception resulted in significantly reduced calcium and vitamin D levels in study 1 compared with the control groups (P < 0.001). However, human colostrum uptake inhibited increases in the level of transglutaminase antibody in autistic pups with coeliac disease. CONCLUSION: The effects of early-life nutrition and human colostrum on the functional maturation of the duodenal villi in autistic rats with coeliac disease that might limit or prevent the coeliac risk with autism.},

   abstract = {BACKGROUND AND GOALS: Growth retardation is one of the most important signs of childhood celiac disease (CD); however, it is not very well known whether craniofacial growth is also affected. We aimed to carry out a detailed craniofacial morphological study to derive a conclusion on the craniofacial features of children with CD. PARTICIPANTS AND METHODS: Eighty-four 2-16-year-old children with biopsy-proven CD and 84 age-matched and sex-matched healthy children were included. Of these, 37 children (44.0%) had been newly diagnosed and 47 (56.0%) were on a gluten-free diet. Anteroposterior and lateral photographs were evaluated using the Scion Image software program for the measurements of the distances between reference points on the face. RESULTS: Except for nasofrontal angle (nfa), nasolabial angle (nla), pronasale height (prnh), nasal dorsum height (ndh), and nasal radix height (nrh), all measurements were significantly greater in patients compared with controls. In celiac children, all facial proportions except forehead/face height (t-gl/t-gn) and nose length/face height (n-ns/t-gn) were significantly different from those of controls. Except for nla, prnh, ndh, nrh, t-gl/t-gn, face height to total face height ratio (sn-gn/t-gn), n-sn/t-gn, ear length to face height ratio (s-sba/t-gn), and face width to face height ratio (z-z/t-gn), all measurements were statistically different in those on a gluten-free diet and newly diagnosed children. CONCLUSION: Most of the facial measurements and proportions of celiac children were different from those of controls. Our data confirm those of a previous study reporting that the forehead proportion is not altered in childhood CD. Pathophysiological mechanisms underlying these alterations are not clear but disruptions of growth during certain critical periods may be responsible.},

   abstract = {OBJECTIVE: Measuring serum tissue transglutaminase immunoglobulin A (tTG IgA) levels is the most widely used screening test for coeliac disease. However, given an increased prevalence of IgA deficiency among coeliac patients there is a risk of false negative results. Hence, in addition to specific serum tTG IgA, screening tests frequently include total IgA levels. The objective of this study was to determine whether tTG IgA antibody levels might be used to predict IgA deficiency and hence avoid unnecessary testing of total IgA levels in all individuals. DESIGN: Retrospective analysis of 9429 serum tTG IgA and corresponding total IgA levels obtained from children and young adults in the East of England between 2007 and 2011. RESULTS: The overall prevalence of IgA deficiency was found to be very low with only 0.9% of individuals affected. Using receiver operating characteristic curve analysis we identified a cut-off value for tTG IgA of >/=0.10 mu/mL to be predictive for the absence of total IgA deficiency (IgA<0.06 g/L). Specifically, using this cut-off value, total IgA deficiency could be excluded with a sensitivity of 0.92 and specificity of 0.84. In our cohort, only 16.4% of our patient sample would have needed total IgA measurement to rule out a false negative result due to IgA deficiency. CONCLUSIONS: Our data provide a simple means of avoiding unnecessary total IgA measurements in the assessment of coeliac disease. By using tTG IgA value quantitatively, only values <0.10 mu/mL require total IgA measurements to rule out IgA deficiency and hence a potentially false negative screening result.},

   abstract = {CONTEXT: The data on status of apoptosis in patients with celiac disease are conflicting. Furthermore, complex interaction between intrinsic and common apoptotic pathways, apoptotic inhibitors, and epithelial cell proliferation is largely unclear for patients with celiac disease. OBJECTIVES: To determine the role of apoptosis and epithelial cell regeneration in celiac disease. DESIGN: Twenty-five treatment-naive patients with celiac disease and 6 patients with functional dyspepsia, as controls, were included and duodenal biopsy specimens from all were subjected to immunohistochemistry with markers of intrinsic apoptotic pathway (AIF, H2AX, p53), common pathway (CC3, M30), apoptotic inhibitors (XIAP, Bcl2), and epithelial proliferation (Ki-67). Apoptotic and proliferation indices were calculated. RESULTS: Expression of end-apoptotic products, that is, H2AX in the cell nuclei (P = .01) and M30 in the cell cytoplasm (P < .01), was significantly upregulated in celiac disease in comparison to controls. Cleaved caspase-3 was also upregulated in villous cytoplasm in celiac disease. Apoptotic inhibitor Bcl2 was significantly down-regulated in celiac disease in comparison to controls. In addition, Ki-67 proliferation index was upregulated both in the crypts and villous mucosal epithelium in comparison to the crypts of the controls. CONCLUSIONS: Treatment-naive patients with celiac disease have significantly higher level of apoptosis that involves both the common and intrinsic apoptotic pathways. Increased apoptosis and unequaled cell regeneration in crypts probably results in villous atrophy. Down-regulation of apoptotic inhibitors in treatment-naive celiac disease imparts an additional pro-apoptotic effect.},

   abstract = {BACKGROUND: The majority of deleterious health consequences of coeliac disease (CD) are most likely to be secondary to intestinal inflammation; hence, mucosal recovery is a desirable goal of therapy. Follow-up in CD is controversial and serological response is often used as a surrogate for histological recovery. AIMS: To inform the clinical management of CD using comparative serological and histological data from a biopsy-driven pathway of care. METHODS: A retrospective analysis of the Cambridge Coeliac Clinic database of 595 patients routinely followed up by biopsy and serology. RESULTS: Paired biopsy results were available for 391 patients (15% seronegative). Persisting villous atrophy (VA) occurred in 182 patients (47%). The sensitivity of anti-tissue transglutaminase (TTG) antibody for ongoing VA was only 43.6%. Information on dietetic management and further biopsy to assess response was available for 94 initially unresponsive patients, in whom targeted dietetic intervention by removal of identified gluten sources or avoidance of trace amounts of gluten led to resolution of persistent VA in 50%. The effects of institution of a formal care pathway are analysed in 298 patients. Discharge to primary care and clinical management was facilitated by the information derived from repeat biopsy. CONCLUSIONS: Serology appears to be a poor surrogate marker for mucosal recovery on a gluten-free diet; dietary assessment fails to identify a potential gluten source in many patients with ongoing villous atrophy. The benefits of re-biopsy on diet include stratification of patients with coeliac disease suitable for early discharge from secondary care or those requiring more intensive clinical management.},

Immunoassays, such as enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay (ELISA) and lateral flow device (LFD), are commonly used to detect gluten traces in foods. However, the performance of immunoassays can be affected by non-assay-related factors, such as food matrix and processing conditions. Gluten (0-500 ppm) and wheat flour (20-1000 ppm) incurred cornbread was prepared at different incurred levels and baking conditions (204.4 degrees C for 20, 27, and 34 min) to study the accuracy and precision of gluten measurement by seven immunoassay kits (three LFD and four ELISA kits). The stability and immunoreactivity of gluten proteins, as measured by western blot using three different antibodies, were not adversely affected by the baking conditions. However, the gluten recovery varied depending upon the ELISA kit and the gluten source used to make the incurred cornbread, affecting the accuracy of gluten quantification (BioKits, 9-77%; Morinaga, 91-137%; R-Biopharm, 61-108%; and Romer Labs, 113-190%). Gluten recovery was reduced with increased baking time for most ELISA kits analyzed. Both the sampling and analytical variance increased with an increase in the gluten incurred level. The predicted analytical coefficient of variation associated with all ELISA kits was below 12% for all incurred levels, indicative of good analytical precision.},

METHODS: We retrospectively reviewed the case records of 233 consecutive patients with celiac disease who were diagnosed at 12-18 years or >18 years of age. The diagnosis of celiac disease was made on the basis of the modified European Society of Pediatric Gastroenterology, Hepatology and Nutrition criteria. RESULTS: The diagnosis of celiac disease was made after 18 years of age in 153 (65.7%) patients. Median duration of symptoms at the diagnosis was 54 months (range 1 month to 29 years). In all, 103 (44.2%) patients with atypical manifestations were referred by other departments for evaluation. Chronic diarrhea (48.5%), short stature (27.0%) and chronic anemia (9.0%) were the common modes of presentation. Elevated level of aminotransaminase were present in 50 (24.3%) patients. Chronic diarrhea, hypocalcemia and hypoalbuminemia were present in significantly higher number of adult than adolescent patients. In all, 227 (97.4%) patients responded to a 6-month gluten-free diet and six non-responders were non-compliant. CONCLUSIONS: More than 40% of the patients with celiac disease present to clinicians other than gastroenterologists or internists with atypical manifestations. A high index of suspicion is required for diagnosing its variant forms.},

   abstract = {BACKGROUND: Life-long gluten-free diet (GFD) is the only recognised treatment for coeliac disease (CD). The present study aimed to determine the nutritional adequacy of the 'no detectable gluten' diet. METHODS: Seven-day prospective food intake was assessed in 55 patients who were adherent to a GFD for more than 2 years and in 50 newly-diagnosed age- and sex-matched patients (18-71 years, 24% male) studied prospectively over 12 months on GFD. Historical precoeliac intake was also assessed in the latter group. Intake was compared with Australian Nutritional Recommendations and the Australian population data. RESULTS: Nutritional intake was similar between groups. Of macronutrients, only starch intake fell over 12 months (26% to 23%, P = 0.04). Fibre intake was inadequate for all except in diet-experienced men. More than one in 10 of both newly-diagnosed and experienced women had inadequate thiamin, folate, vitamin A, magnesium, calcium and iron intakes. More than one in 10 newly-diagnosed men had inadequate thiamin, folate, magnesium, calcium and zinc intakes. Inadequate intake did not relate to nutrient density of the GFD. Inadequacies of folate, calcium, iron and zinc occurred more frequently than in the Australian population. The frequency of inadequacies was similar pre- and post-diagnosis, except for thiamin and vitamin A, where inadequacies were more common after GFD implementation. CONCLUSIONS: Dietary intake patterns at 12 months on a GFD are similar to longer-term intake. Dietary inadequacies are common and may relate to habitual poor food choices in addition to inherent deficiencies in the GFD. Dietary education should also address the achievement of adequate micronutrient intake. Fortification of GF foods also need to be considered.},

   abstract = {OBJECTIVES: Small bowel intraepithelial lymphocytosis (IELs) with normal villous architecture is a relatively common finding, often of uncertain significance. The aims of our study were to determine the prevalence of this finding, its clinical associations, its specificity for celiac disease (CD), and whether histologic clues exist that increase the specificity for CD in this setting, all in the pediatric population. METHODS: The Mayo Clinic electronic pathology database was searched between January 1, 2000 and December 31, 2009 for patients younger than 18 years who had the terms "normal villi" and "increased intraepithelial lymphocytes" in their small bowel biopsy reports. All of the slides were reviewed to confirm the histologic findings. Demographic, serologic, pathologic, and clinical informations were obtained. RESULTS: Among 1290 duodenal biopsies obtained from children during the years 2000 and 2009, 56 (4.3%) were noted to have "normal villous architecture with increased intraepithelial lymphocytes." In the 54 patients not known to have CD before biopsy, 48 (89%) had serologic testing for CD. Of these 48 patients, 9 were labeled with CD, although only 5 of 9 met the definite criteria for the diagnosis, based on a combination of serologic markers, human leukocyte antigen haplotyping, and response to gluten-free diet. No clinical features pointed to a diagnosis of CD. There was no correlation between CD and number of IELs, but patients with newly diagnosed CD were more likely to have a tip-heavy lymphocyte distribution. Other diagnoses made during the study period and in follow-up were inflammatory bowel disease (5), Helicobacter pylori infection (3), medication-related injury (10), and systemic autoimmune disorders (2). CONCLUSIONS: Increased IELs with normal villous architecture in small bowel biopsies are clinically important in children, and are associated with a new definite diagnosis of CD in 9% of pediatric patients. Even at this low sensitivity, clinical work-up for CD is mandated in all of the patients with this finding.},

   abstract = {BACKGROUND: Patients with celiac disease (CD) have a wide variety of symptoms, from being asymptomatic to having chronic diarrhea, abdominal pain, and extraintestinal symptoms. In the oral cavity, enamel defects and recurrent aphthous stomatitis are the most common symptoms. The aim of the study was to assess oral health, bacterial colonization and salivary buffering capacity of patients with CD at diagnosis were compared with patients with CD receiving a gluten-free diet (GFD) and healthy children. METHODS: Three groups were prospectively investigated: newly diagnosed CD, CD treated with GFD, and a control group. All of the children were examined by pediatric dentists, and saliva samples were collected for bacterial and pH analysis. RESULTS: Ninety children were enrolled in the study, 30 in each group. A higher prevalence of enamel hypoplasia (66%) was found in children with CD. Plaque index was significantly lower in the celiac-treated group, which correlated with oral health behavior: teeth brushing and frequency of eating between meals. Children receiving GFD brushed their teeth and used fluoride significantly more often than other children in the study. No difference between groups was found in snack consumption, mutans streptococci and lactobacilli counts in saliva, as well as pH and buffer capacity. CONCLUSIONS: A lower degree of plaque was found in children with CD receiving GFD. This finding could not be explained by salivary properties or bacteria, but rather by better oral hygiene. The results should raise the awareness of pediatric gastroenterologists toward oral health-related issues in children with CD.},

   abstract = {PURPOSE: Celiac disease (CD) is an autoimmune enteropathy, triggered by dietary gluten. The only treatment is a strict gluten-free diet. Oats are included in the list of gluten-free ingredients by European Regulation, but the safety of oats in CD is still a matter of debate. The present study examined the capability of different oat cultivars of activating the gliadin-induced transglutaminase-2 (TG2)-dependent events in some in vitro models of CD. In addition, we compared this capability with the electrophoresis pattern of peptic-tryptic digests of the proteins of the oat cultivars. METHODS: K562(S) cells agglutination, transepithelial electrical resistance of T84-cell monolayers, intracellular levels of TG2 and phosphorylated form of protein 42-44 in T84 cells were the early gliadin-dependent events studied. RESULTS: The results showed that the Nave oat cultivar elicited these events, whereas Irina and Potenza varieties did not. The ability of a cultivar to activate the above-described events was associated with the electrophoretic pattern of oat proteins and their reactivity to anti-gliadin antibodies. CONCLUSION: We found significant differences among oat cultivars in eliciting the TG2-mediated events of CD inflammation. Therefore, the safety of an oat cultivar in CD might be screened in vitro by means of biochemical and biological assays, before starting a clinical trial to definitely assess its safety.},

   abstract = {OBJECTIVE: The purpose of this study was to investigate screening practices for celiac disease in patients with type 1 diabetes across North America. The research question investigated was whether diabetes centers screen for celiac disease in type 1 diabetes more frequently than other facilities. RESEARCH DESIGN AND METHODS: A survey with 27 questions on screening practices for celiac disease in patients with type 1 diabetes was designed by experts in celiac disease and diabetes. Surveys were sent by email to diabetes educators and dietitians throughout the United States and Canada between December 2010 and May 2011. RESULTS: There were 514 respondents from 484 endocrine clinics, diabetes clinics, private practices, community nutrition centers, and inpatient centers. Thirty-five percent of work locations screened for celiac disease, with endocrine clinics reporting screening at the highest frequency (80%). Tissue transglutaminase was the most common screening test used. The most frequently recommended treatment of confirmed celiac disease was a gluten-free diet. However, only 71% of respondents recommended biopsy in patients with positive serologies. Most respondents (55.3%) reported that the gluten-free diet resulted in symptom improvement in the majority of patients. CONCLUSIONS: Staff at endocrine clinics were more likely to suggest screening for celiac disease in patients with type 1 diabetes. Both low screening frequency as well as inconsistency in management of positive celiac disease serological tests indicated an increase in education regarding celiac disease in patients with type 1 diabetes is required. In addition uniform guidelines should be developed.},

The diagnosis of celiac disease was made on the basis of the modified European Society of Pediatric Gastroenterology, Hepatology, and Nutrition criteria. Of 25 patients (nine males; mean age 28.8 +/- 16.6 years) with celiac disease and cirrhosis, 17 patients presented predominantly with cirrhosis, while 8 presented primarily with celiac disease. Five patients had known cause of cirrhosis (autoimmune hepatitis, three; PBC, one; hepatic venous outflow tract obstruction, one); the remaining 20 were cryptogenic. Gluten-free diet led to improvement in diarrhea and anemia and to a better control of ascites and other features of liver failure. Some patients with cryptogenic cirrhosis have coexistent celiac disease, and they show response to gluten-free diet. Patients with cryptogenic cirrhosis should be screened for celiac disease.},

   abstract = {Most of celiac disease (CeD) patients have anemia, and its diagnosis is seldom considered in the presence of normal hemoglobin. However, over the past few years, we have observed a few CeD patients having normal hemoglobin. Therefore, we reviewed our CeD database to find out what proportion of CeD patients had normal hemoglobin levels and if there were any differences in characteristics of those with and without anemia. Of 338 CeD patients, 14.8 % had normal hemoglobin levels at diagnosis. When compared with CeD patients without anemia, those with anemia had significantly longer duration of symptoms, lower albumin levels, and higher anti-tissue transglutaminase fold rise, and a higher proportion had abnormal d-xylose tests and severe villous abnormalities. Thus, CeD patients with anemia had more severe disease than those without anemia. It is therefore important to diagnose these patients at an earlier stage of the disease even when the classical feature such as anemia is not clinically evident.},

   abstract = {OBJECTIVE: Some of the conventional serological tests for coeliac disease (CD) are expensive, time-consuming and not readily available in developing countries, leading to a delay in diagnosis. Recently, point-of-care tests (POCT) have been manufactured and tested in Europe but have not been validated in our setting. We therefore aimed to study the diagnostic accuracy of the POCT 'Biocard' test in diagnosing CD in Indian children. DESIGN: Cross-sectional study. SETTING: Tertiary care centre in north India. PATIENTS: Children, aged 2-18 years, with chronic diarrhoea, short stature or refractory anaemia underwent serological testing for CD with antiendomysial antibodies (AEA), antitissue transglutaminase (tTG) antibodies and Biocard test followed by duodenal biopsy irrespective of serological results. CD was diagnosed with positive AEA and duodenal biopsy showing >grade 2 changes using modified Marsh criteria. Those who were both AEA negative and had normal histology were considered CD negative. RESULTS: Of 319 children who underwent the serological testing, 170 agreed for biopsy. Of these, 110 were diagnosed with CD and 30 were found to be CD negative. Remaining 30 had discordant AEA and histology results and were not included in analysis. Biocard test agreed with 92/110 positive and 27/30 negative diagnoses based on reference tests (83.6% sensitivity and 90% specificity). tTG was found to be 93.8% sensitive and 96.4% specific. CONCLUSIONS: We successfully validated the POCT for CD in our setting. It could be used to increase case detection rates in developing countries with a large undiagnosed CD burden.},

   abstract = {Gluten exclusion (protein complex present in many cereals) has been proposed as an option for the prevention of diseases other than coeliac disease. However, the effects of gluten-free diets on obesity and its mechanisms of action have not been studied. Thus, our objective was to assess whether gluten exclusion can prevent adipose tissue expansion and its consequences. C57BL/6 mice were fed a high-fat diet containing 4.5% gluten (Control) or no gluten (GF). Body weight and adiposity gains, leukocyte rolling and adhesion, macrophage infiltration and cytokine production in adipose tissue were assessed. Blood lipid profiles, glycaemia, insulin resistance and adipokines were measured. Expression of the PPAR-alpha and gamma, lipoprotein lipase (LPL), hormone sensitive lipase (HSL), carnitine palmitoyl acyltransferase-1 (CPT-1), insulin receptor, GLUT-4 and adipokines were assessed in epidydimal fat. Gluten-free animals showed a reduction in body weight gain and adiposity, without changes in food intake or lipid excretion. These results were associated with up-regulation of PPAR-alpha, LPL, HSL and CPT-1, which are related to lipolysis and fatty acid oxidation. There was an improvement in glucose homeostasis and pro-inflammatory profile-related overexpression of PPAR-gamma. Moreover, intravital microscopy showed a lower number of adhered cells in the adipose tissue microvasculature. The overexpression of PPAR-gamma is related to the increase of adiponectin and GLUT-4. Our data support the beneficial effects of gluten-free diets in reducing adiposity gain, inflammation and insulin resistance. The data suggests that diet gluten exclusion should be tested as a new dietary approach to prevent the development of obesity and metabolic disorders.},

   abstract = {OBJECTIVES: The aim of the present study was to conduct a systematic review with meta-analysis on the epidemiology of eosinophilic esophagitis (EoE) in children. METHODS: Studies investigating incidence and prevalence of EoE in children (</= 18 years) were identified in a systematic review of MEDLINE (1950-2011) and Embase (1980-2011). Meta-analyses were performed for incidence and subgroups with >/= 5 studies: esophagogastroduodenoscopy (EGD) for any indication, histologic esophageal disease, and celiac disease, and EGD for abdominal pain. We used a random effects model, Q statistic to assess heterogeneity, and joinpoint analysis to assess time trends. RESULTS: We included 25 studies. The incidence of EoE varied from 0.7 to 10/100,000 per person-year and the prevalence ranged from 0.2 to 43/100,000. The incidence and prevalence increased over time. Prevalence was highest in children with food impaction or dysphagia (63%-88%). The pooled prevalence was 3.7% (95% confidence interval [CI] 2.4-5.1) in EGD for any indication, 24% (95% CI 19-28) in histologic esophageal disease, 2.3% (95% CI 1.0-3.6) in celiac disease, and 2.6% (95% CI 1.2-4.1) in EGD for abdominal pain. CONCLUSIONS: During the last 2 decades, the incidence and prevalence of EoE in children have increased significantly; however, the population-based incidence and prevalence of EoE vary widely across geographic variations, potentially because of variations in case of ascertainment between centers. Because EoE is common among children with food impaction and dysphagia, children with this presenting complaint should be rapidly identified at triage for timely endoscopic assessment.},

   abstract = {BACKGROUND: Celiac disease (CD) is an autoimmune enteropathy induced by dietary wheat gluten that can have serious consequences if not diagnosed and treated early. It is important to be familiar with other alterations associated with gluten ingestion due to the multiplicity of clinical presentations. OBJECTIVES: To describe the most common CD presentation patterns and alterations associated with gluten in children from the northwest region of Mexico, with an incipient knowledge of its prevalence. PATIENTS AND METHODS: Age, sex, family history, and gastrointestinal and extraintestinal symptoms were recorded in 24 patients within the time frame of 2006 to 2010. Biochemical and hematologic data were collected. Anti-gliadin and anti-transglutaminase antibodies were analyzed in all the cases, and haplotypes (HLA-DQ2/DQ8) and duodenal biopsy were evaluated in some of the cases. RESULTS: Of the 24 patients (14 girls and 10 boys), 13 presented with typical CD with symptoms of poor gastrointestinal absorption; 7 patients with a mean age of 5 years presented with atypical CD; 2 had disease onset with gastrointestinal and extraintestinal (neurologic) problems; and 2 with other gluten-related disorders. All of the patients had positive serology; 11/15 presented with HLA-DQ2/DQ8 and 4 with at least one allele; damaged mucosa was observed in the 6 biopsies taken. A third of the patients were anemic, 6 presented with an albumin value of<3.5g/dL, and 4 with mineral deficiencies. A total of 83% of the patients improved with a gluten-free diet. CONCLUSIONS: The presentation patterns were: 1) typical CD, 2) atypical CD, 3) CD with gastrointestinal and extraintestinal (neurologic) symptoms, and 4) gluten-related disorders other than CD.},

   abstract = {BACKGROUND & AIMS: Celiac disease shares features of other disorders. It can be diagnosed conclusively only based on duodenal histology analysis, which is not practical for screening purposes. Serologic analysis might be used to identify candidates for biopsy analysis. We aimed to develop a simple diagnostic approach that all clinicians could follow to increase the percentage of patients accurately diagnosed with celiac disease at initial presentation. METHODS: We performed a retrospective analysis of data from 752 patients (88 with celiac disease, none were IgA deficient) who attended a UK district general hospital from January 2007 through December 2008 and underwent biopsy analysis and serologic tests to measure endomyseal antibodies and IgA antibodies against tissue transglutaminase (tTG). Patients avoiding gluten in their diet were excluded. Patients were assigned to 1 of 4 groups: high-risk (based on presence of anemia, chronic diarrhea, unintentional weight loss, or dermatitis herpetiformis), low-risk (based on such factors as dyspepsia, abnormal liver function, ataxia, or chronic cough), nutrient deficiency (based on levels of iron, vitamins B12 and D, or folate), or screening (because they had type 1 diabetes or a family history of celiac disease). Patients with celiac disease were identified using the modified Marsh criteria (grades 1-3) for interpreting duodenal histology. We compared clinical category, serology profiles, and biopsy results between patients with and without celiac disease. RESULTS: Celiac disease was diagnosed in 64 of 565 patients in the high-risk group (11%), 14 of 156 patients in the low-risk group (9%; P = .47 compared with high-risk group), 7 of 28 patients in the nutrient-deficiency group, and 3 of 3 patients in the screening group. Among 71 patients who tested positive for both antibodies (tTG and endomyseal antibodies), the positive predictive value for celiac disease was 97%; a negative test result for tTG had a negative predictive value of 98%. Among 708 patients with normal-looking biopsy samples, only 62 had celiac disease (9%). Among 44 patients with abnormal biopsy samples, 26 had celiac disease (59%). CONCLUSIONS: Based on a retrospective analysis, patients with and without celiac disease cannot be distinguished based on clinical features. Patients who present with symptoms of celiac disease should be tested for tTG, to identify candidates for duodenal biopsy analysis.},

   abstract = {Coeliac disease (CD) is one of the most common diseases worldwide, resulting from a combination of environmental (gluten) and genetic (human leucocyte antigen (HLA) and non-HLA genes) factors. Depending on the geographical location, the prevalence of CD has been estimated to approximate 0.5-1%. The only treatment currently available for CD is a gluten-free diet (GFD) excluding gluten-containing cereals such as wheat, rye, and barley, and other foodstuffs with natural or added gluten. However, adherence rates and patient acceptance are often poor. Moreover, even in fully adherent patients, the diet may fail to induce clinical or histological improvement. Hence, it is unsurprising that studies show CD patients to be highly interested in non-dietary alternatives. The following review focuses on current pathophysiological concepts of CD, spotlighting those pathways which may serve as new possible, non-dietary therapeutic targets in the treatment of CD.},

   abstract = {OBJECTIVES: Undernourishment is common in children with cerebral palsy (CP), but the reasons are unknown. We previously reported elevated levels of immunoglobulin (Ig) A and IgG antibodies against gliadin (AGA) and tissue transglutaminase (tTG) in 99 children and young adults with CP without characteristic findings of gluten enteropathy in small bowel biopsies. Our aim was to perform a case-control study of IgG antibodies against other dietary antigens, AGA, anti-tTG, and IgE antibodies against wheat and gluten. METHODS: Sera from 99 cases with CP and 99 healthy, age- and sex-matched controls were analysed with fluorescence enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay for detection of IgG antibodies against beta-lactoglobulin, casein, egg white, IgG- and IgA-AGA, IgA-anti-tTG, and IgE antibodies against gluten and wheat. RESULTS: Compared with controls, the odds ratio in cases with CP for having elevated levels of IgG antibodies against beta-lactoglobulin was 17.0 (95% confidence interval [CI] 2.3-128), against casein 11.0 (95% CI 2.6-46.8), and against egg white 7.0 (95% CI 1.6-30.8). The IgE responses for wheat/gluten were generally low. The tetraplegic and dyskinetic CP subtypes had significantly higher frequencies of elevated levels for all of the tested antibodies except IgG against egg white, and IgA-anti-tTG. A significantly lower weight was seen in cases with CP with positive versus negative serology. CONCLUSIONS: Elevated levels of IgG against dietary antigens were more frequent in the CP group compared with controls, and particularly in the tetraplegic and dyskinetic CP subtypes with the most severe neurologic handicap and undernourishment. Hypothetically, malnourishment may cause increased intestinal permeability and thus immunization against dietary antigens.},

   abstract = {OBJECTIVES: The aim of this study was to describe the occurrence of clinically diagnosed coeliac disease in children ages 0 to 12 years in Norway, including regional variation and coexisting type 1 diabetes mellitus, thyroid disease, and Down syndrome. METHODS: The Norwegian Patient Register (NPR) contains individual-level hospital data from 2008 onward. Small-bowel biopsies for establishing the coeliac disease diagnosis are only performed at public hospitals reporting to the NPR. Data on all hospital contacts during 2008-2011 when a diagnosis of coeliac disease was registered were retrieved from the NPR for patients born between 1999 and 2011, allowing estimation of the proportion registered with coeliac disease at ages 0 to 12 years in a cohort study. RESULTS: A total of 3006 individuals (58.2% girls) were recorded as having coeliac disease among 797,360 children, corresponding to a proportion of 3.8/1000 (95% confidence interval [CI] 3.7-3.9/1000) children, 4.5 (CI 4.3-4.7) among girls and 3.1 (CI 2.9-3.3/1000) among boys (P < 0.001). The proportion increased with age up to approximately 6 years and was 5.0/1000 (CI 4.5-5.6) at the age of 12 years, and was slightly higher in the south/west (3.9/1000) as compared to the middle/north (3.5/1000) regions of Norway (P = 0.013). A total of 214 of 3006 (7.1%) patients with coeliac disease were registered with coexisting conditions: type 1 diabetes mellitus (n = 142, 4.7%), Down syndrome (n = 47, 1.6%), or thyroid disease (n = 41, 1.4%). CONCLUSIONS: In this first nationwide study of clinically diagnosed coeliac disease in Norwegian children, we found a high occurrence, comparable with that in Sweden. Comorbidity was common, but routine screening of high-risk groups contributed to a limited number of cases.},

   abstract = {OBJECTIVES: Timing of gluten introduction has been associated with the risk of celiac disease (CD) in children, but the optimal time window is unknown. We aimed to study the effect of age of gluten introduction on the risk of CD, adjusting for continued breastfeeding. METHODS: In The Norwegian Mother and Child Cohort Study, a prospective birth cohort including 107,000 children, CD was identified by questionnaires and by linkage to the Norwegian Patient Register. Gluten introduction was reported monthly from 0 to 6 months of age, and breastfeeding from 0 to 18 months. RESULTS: After exclusion of cases with insufficient information, 324 children with CD in a cohort of 82,167 were used in the analyses. Gluten was introduced before or at 4 months in 8.0%, 5 to 6 months in 45.3%, and after 6 months in 46.6%, whereas continued breastfeeding was stable at approximately 78% at 6 months age. CD was diagnosed in 3.68/1000 of the infants with gluten introduction at 5 to 6 months compared with 4.15/1000 with late and 4.24/1000 with early gluten introduction. After adjustment for the child's age and gender, breastfeeding, and maternal CD, delayed gluten introduction was associated with an increased risk of CD (adjusted odds ratio, 1.27 [95% confidence interval, 1.01-1.65], P = .045). Breastfeeding >12 months was also associated with increased risk (adjusted odds ratio, 1.49 [95% confidence interval, 1.01-2.21], P = .046). CONCLUSIONS: We found an increased risk of CD in children introduced to gluten after 6 months and a higher risk in children breastfed after 12 months age.},

   abstract = {Celiac disease is an autoimmune disorder resulting from gluten intolerance and is based on a genetically predisposition. Symptoms occur upon exposure to prolamin from wheat, rye, barley and related grain. The pathogenesis of celiac disease has not yet been sufficiently elucidated but is being considered as an autoimmune process. At its core are the deamidation of prolamin fragments, the building of specific antibodies and the activation of cytotoxic T-cells. The immunological inflammatory process is accompanied by structural damages of the enterocytes (villous atrophy, colonization and crypt hyperplasia). The symptoms and their extent depend on the type of the celiac disease; classic and non-classic forms are being distinguished (atypical, oligosymptomatic, latent and silent celiac disease). Characteristics of the classic presentation are malabsorption syndrome and intestinal symptoms such as mushy diarrhea and abdominal distension. The diagnosis of celiac disease is based on four pillars: Anamnesis and clinical presentation, serological evidence of coeliac specific antibodies (IgA-t-TG; IgA-EmA), small intestine biopsy and improvement of symptoms after institution of a gluten-free diet. The basis of the therapy is a lifelong gluten-free diet, i. e. wheat, rye, barley, spelt, green-core, faro-wheat, kamuth and conventional oats as well as food items obtained therefrom. Small amounts of up to 50 mg gluten per day are usually tolerated by most patients; amounts of > or = 100 mg/day lead mostly to symptoms. Gluten-free foods contain < or = 20 ppm or 20 mg/kg (Sign: symbol of the 'crossed ear' or label 'gluten-free'). At the beginning of the therapy the fat and lactose intake may need to be reduced; also the supplementation of single micronutrients (fat-soluble vitamins, folic acid, B12, iron, and calcium) may be required. Alternative therapies are being developed but have not yet been clinically tested.},

   abstract = {BACKGROUND & AIMS: Coeliac disease is a chronic small intestinal immune-mediated enteropathy triggered by dietary gluten in genetically predisposed individuals. Since it is unknown if all wheat varieties are equally toxic to coeliac patients seven Triticum accessions showing different origin (ancient/modern) and ploidy (di-, tetra- hexaploid) were studied. MATERIALS AND METHODS: Selected strains of wheat were ancient Triticum monococcum precoce (AA genome) and Triticum speltoides (BB genome), accessions of Triticum turgidum durum (AABB genome) including two ancient (Graziella Ra and Kamut) and two modern (Senatore Cappelli and Svevo) durum strains of wheat and Triticum aestivum compactum (AABBDD genome). Small intestinal gluten-specific T-cell lines generated from 13 coeliac patients were tested with wheat accessions by proliferation assays. RESULTS: All strains of wheat independent of ploidy or ancient/modern origin triggered heterogeneous responses covering wide ranges of stimulation indices. CONCLUSION: Ancient strains of wheat, although previously suggested to be low or devoid of coeliac toxicity, should be tested for immunogenicity using gluten-specific T-cell lines from multiple coeliac patients rather than gluten-specific clones to assess their potential toxicity. Our findings provide further evidence for the need for a strict gluten-free diet in coeliac patients, including avoidance of ancient strains of wheat.},

Very few large series of lymphocytic colitis of childhood occurrence are available in the medical literature. Ten cases each of lymphocytic colitis and of colonic lymphocytosis of other diagnosis, all with duodenal disaccharidases analysis data, were collected from the files of our institution. The electronic medical records were reviewed and multiple variables were analyzed. The ten patients with lymphocytic colitis presented with diarrhea. Of these, three had abdominal pain. The age range was 2-18 years. Nearly all patients were Caucasian (90%) and 70% were female. Endoscopically, most had normal appearing colonic mucosa. Significant past medical history, family medical history and associated comorbidities included celiac disease, Down syndrome, juvenile arthritis and other autoimmune diseases. Interestingly, the most revealing observation was that the majority of cases (80%) were associated with lactase deficiency and, for the most part, gastrointestinal symptoms improved simply by treatment with Lactaid or avoidance of dairy products. This association is statistically significant. Our clinicopathological study indicates that the typical pediatric patient is a female Caucasian. A large of portion of the patients had associated lactase deficiency and improved on Lactaid supplement alone.},

Using repeat service audit, we demonstrate that a combination of TG2 followed by IgA endomysial antibodies (EMA) is the best strategy for all degrees of mucosal abnormality using our test combination. Reliance upon immunoassay titre is not as effective, and cannot be applied consistently across populations in the absence of assay standardization. Guidelines advocating the use of tests should involve experts in laboratory diagnostics and external quality assurance to ensure that errors of generalization do not occur and that test performance is achievable in routine diagnostic use.},

   abstract = {INTRODUCTION: Celiac disease (CD) is a permanent intolerance to gluten that occurs in genetically predisposed individuals and leads to small intestinal mucosa damage. According to ESPGHAN guidelines from 2012, CD can be diagnosed in a patient with characteristic clinical symptoms, in whom, anti-tissue transglutaminase antibodies (> 10 times the upper limit) are found, endomysial antibodies (EMA) is confirmed and a positive genetic test is obtained. In these conditions no small-bowel biopsies are required. AIM: Evaluation of the presence of HLA-DQ2 and HLA-DQ8 haplotypes in children with previously diagnosed CD, hospitalised in 2012 at the Department of Paediatrics and Immunology and/or the Gastroenterological Outpatient Clinic, and their relatives. MATERIAL AND METHODS: Blood samples of 22 subjects, including 9 children with CD diagnosed on the basis of clinical symptoms, serological investigations and small-intestine biopsy, 7 diagnosed on the basis of clinical symptoms and serological investigations, 2 with the suspicion of CD on the basis of clinical symptoms and 4 relatives of a child with CD. METHODS: HLA-DQ2/DQ8 test, automatic evaluation by EUROArrayScan. RESULTS: The presence of HLA-DQ2 and/or HLA-DQ8 genotype was confirmed in 16 children with CD diagnosed on the basis of clinical symptoms and serological tests with/without intestinal biopsy, in 2 with the suspicion of CD and in 1 relative of a celiac child. CONCLUSIONS: The evaluation of HLA-DQ2/DQ8 haplotype confirms the genetic predisposition to CD in subjects with the disease diagnosed previously on the basis of clinical symptoms, serological tests or intestinal biopsy. Genetic testing is particularly indicated for the diagnosis of CD in infants consuming gluten for a short time and in small amounts.},

   abstract = {Gluten-sensitive enteropathy, also known as coeliac disease (CD), is an autoimmune disorder occurring in genetically susceptible individuals that damages the small intestine and interferes with the absorption of other nutrients. As it is triggered by dietary gluten and related prolamins present in wheat, rye and barley, the accepted treatment for CD is a strict gluten-free diet. However, a complete exclusion of gluten-containing cereals from the diet is often difficult, and new therapeutic strategies are urgently needed. A class of proteins that have already emerged as drug targets for other autoimmune diseases are the heat shock proteins (HSPs), which are highly conserved stress-induced chaperones that protect cells against harmful extracellular factors. HSPs are expressed in several tissues, including the gastrointestinal tract, and their levels are significantly increased under stress circumstances. HSPs exert immunomodulatory effects, and also play a crucial role in the maintenance of epithelial cell structure and function, as they are responsible for adequate protein folding, influence the degradation of proteins and cell repair processes after damage, and modulate cell signalling, cell proliferation and apoptosis. The present review discusses the involvement of HSPs in the pathophysiology of CD. Furthermore, HSPs may represent a useful therapeutic target for the treatment of CD due to the cytoprotective, immunomodulatory, and anti-apoptotic effects in the intestinal mucosal barrier.},

   abstract = {OBJECTIVE: Prior studies have shown that dietary gluten avoidance (DGA) is relatively common in children without previously diagnosed celiac disease (CD), and several clinical predictors of DGA have been found. However, available data on predictors of DGA in adults without diagnosed CD are limited. The aim of this study was to determine the independent predictors of DGA in this population. METHODS: We performed a structured medical record review of 376 patients, ages >/= 20 y, who had never been formally diagnosed with CD, presenting for an initial CD evaluation (ICD-9-CM 579.0) between January 2000 and December 2010 at two large Boston teaching hospitals. We collected data including demographic characteristics, medical history, history of CD serology before referral, and self-reported DGA. Predictors of DGA were determined using multivariable logistic regression. RESULTS: Mean age was 47 (SD = 17) years. We found that 41 patients (10.9%; 95% confidence interval [CI], 7.9-14.5) had avoided gluten at some time in their lives. Most patients had subjective abdominal complaints or bowel movement changes. History of CD seropositivity before referral was noted in 14%. Independent predictors of DGA (P < 0.05) were lactose intolerance (odds ratio [OR], 2.8; 95% CI, 1.1-7.5), food allergy (OR, 3.8; 95% CI, 1.04-13.7), and history of positive serology of less-specific CD markers before the referral (OR, 3.2; 95% CI, 1.3-7.9). CONCLUSIONS: Gluten avoidance is common in a clinic population of adults without prior CD diagnosis. The recognized predictors suggest that DGA may associate with conditions presenting with nonspecific gastrointestinal complaints and perhaps with the perceived benefits of DGA among patients with prior history of positive CD serology.},

CD is a condition with dysregulated systemic and intestinal mucosal immune responses to dietary gluten proteins among genetically predisposed individuals. We recently described spring birth as a novel risk factor for CD in children. We believe that the association between season of birth and CD is due to seasonal differences in sunlight exposure and subsequent vitamin D status. Concomitant with global increases in CD prevalence, vitamin D deficiency also is increasingly recognized in children worldwide. Recent studies have shown that vitamin D deficiency can cause improper immune responses, abnormal intestinal mucosal integrity and impaired local defence to pathogenic microbial agents. In conjunction with other potential aetiological factors, we propose a hypothesis model of early-life vitamin D deficiency in the pathogenesis of childhood-onset CD.},

   abstract = {OBJECTIVE: To investigate whether season of birth is associated with celiac disease (CD). STUDY DESIGN: We performed a medical record review of 1964 patients with biopsy-proven CD at 3 teaching hospitals (2 pediatric centers and 1 adult center) between 2000 and 2010. The first positive small intestinal biopsy result defined age of diagnosis. The observed proportions of births in each season (spring [March-May], summer [June-August], fall [September-November], and winter [December-February]) were compared with the expected proportions using binomial probability tests. RESULTS: The mean age at diagnosis was 9.8 +/- 5.0 years in the 2 pediatric centers and 43.6 +/- 15.8 years in the adult center. The cohort was predominately female (69%). Overall, more patients were born in spring (27%) than in any other season: summer (25%), fall (25%), and winter (23%). In patients diagnosed before age 15 years, the spring birth excess was present in boys (33%; P = .0005), but not in girls (26%; P = .43). The sex difference in season of birth was less striking in patients with CD diagnosed at age >/=15 years. CONCLUSION: Season of birth is an environmental risk factor for CD, particularly in boys diagnosed before age 15 years. The results are consistent with a new theoretical model that integrates potential environmental factors (eg, gluten introduction, ultraviolet-B exposure, vitamin D status) and acute viral gastrointestinal infections in early childhood.},

   abstract = {The only known treatment for celiac disease is a gluten-free diet (GFD), which initially meant abstention from wheat, rye, barley, and oats. Recently, oats free from contamination with wheat have been accepted in the GFD. Yet, reports indicate that all celiac disease patients may not tolerate oats. We hypothesized that celiac children comply well with a GFD and that most have included oats in their diet. A food questionnaire was used to check our patients; 316 questionnaires were returned. Mean time on the GFD was 6.9 years, and 96.8% of the children reported that they were trying to keep a strict GFD. However, accidental transgressions occurred in 263 children (83.2%). In 2 of 3 cases, mistakes took place when the patients were not at home. Symptoms after incidental gluten intake were experienced by 162 (61.6%) patients, mostly (87.5%) from the gastrointestinal tract. Small amounts of gluten (<4 g) caused symptoms in 38% of the cases, and 68% reported symptoms during the first 3 hours after gluten consumption. Oats were included in the diet of 89.4% of the children for a mean of 3.4 years. Most (81.9%) ate purified oats, and 45.3% consumed oats less than once a week. Among those who did not consume oats, only 5.9% refrained because of symptoms. General compliance with the GFD was good. Only the duration of the GFD appeared to influence adherence to the diet. Most patients did not report adverse effects after long-term consumption of oats.},

   abstract = {BACKGROUND: Gastrointestinal symptoms that respond to the removal of wheat and/or gluten are becoming more common. Patients who avoid wheat and/or gluten (PWAWG) are a heterogeneous group and predominantly self-diagnosed prior to presenting for clinical evaluation. SPECIFIC AIM: We characterized PWAWGs seen at a tertiary care referral center and compared them to patients with celiac disease (CD) and subjects in the National Health and Nutrition examination survey (NHANES). METHODS: This was a cross-sectional study evaluating patients seen by four gastroenterologists at a CD referral center. Baseline characteristics, laboratory values, and medical comorbidities were compared to CD patients who presented at the same center and subjects enrolled in NHANES. RESULTS: Eighty-four PWAWGs were identified and compared to 585 CD patients and 2,686 NHANES patients. Thirty-two alternative diagnoses were made in 25 (30%) PWAWGs, including small intestinal bacterial overgrowth and fructose/lactose intolerance. When compared to patients with CD, PWAWGs had similar body mass index (BMI, 23.1 vs. 23.5, p = 0.54) and mean hemoglobin value (13.4 vs. 13.3, p = 0.6). When compared to male and female patients in NHANES, BMI, folate, and mean hemoglobin values were lower in PWAWGs. Both male and female PWAWGs had a lower prevalence of hypertension. CONCLUSION: While there are similarities between CD and PWAWGs that could possibly be due to shared HLA haplotypes or an effect of the gluten-free diet, alternative diagnoses are common in these patients. PWAWGs have a similar cardiovascular profile as CD patients in terms of lower BMI and lower prevalence of hypertension.},

   abstract = {BACKGROUND: Coeliac disease (CD) is an under-diagnosed and often misunderstood disease, yet is one of the most common food intolerance disorders. The only treatment available to prevent the health impacts of CD is a lifelong, strict gluten-free diet (GFD). There are few studies that explore the experiences of diagnosis and the everyday experiences of living with this chronic condition. METHODS: Utilising a qualitative study design, and purposive sampling, the present study describes the experiences of 10 women with coeliac disease in Victoria, Australia. Individual interviews were conducted with women aged between 31 and 60 years who had been diagnosed with CD for at least 2 years. RESULTS: A thematic analysis of the interview transcripts highlighted a number of issues for those living with the disease. Reactions to diagnosis, transition to a GFD and the changes needed to live with CD are discussed. CONCLUSIONS: A range of recommendations including the need to increase CD awareness and education and further research on the impacts of living with the disease are made.},

   abstract = {Celiac Disease (CD) is an immune reaction to gluten containing foods such as rye, wheat and barley. This condition affects individuals with a genetic predisposition; it targets the small bowel and may cause symptoms including diarrhea, malabsorption, weight loss, abdominal pain and bloating. The diagnosis is made by serologic testing of celiac-specific antibodies and confirmed by histology. Certain endoscopic characteristics, such as scalloping, reduction in the number of folds, mosaic-pattern mucosa or nodular mucosa, are suggestive of CD and can be visualized under white light endoscopy. Due to its low sensitivity, endoscopy alone is not recommended to diagnose CD; however, enhanced visual identification of suspected mucosal abnormalities through the use of new technologies, such as narrow band imaging with magnification (NBI-ME), could assist in targeting biopsies and thereby increasing the sensitivity of endoscopy. This is a case series of seven patients with serologic and histologic diagnoses of CD who underwent upper endoscopies with NBI-ME imaging technology as part of their CD evaluation. By employing this imaging technology, we could identify patchy atrophy sites in a mosaic pattern, with flattened villi and alteration of the central capillaries of the duodenal mucosa. We refer to this epithelial pattern as "Leopard Skin Sign". Since epithelial lesions are easily seen using NBI-ME, we found it beneficial for identifying and targeting biopsy sites. Larger prospective studies are warranted to confirm our findings.},

   abstract = {OBJECTIVE: The objective of this study is to compare the efficacy of central (single) vs bilateral (2-injections) endoscopic ultrasound (EUS)-celiac plexus neurolysis (CPN) for palliation of patients with pain related to pancreatic cancer. MATERIALS AND METHODS: Patients with unresectable pancreatic cancer were included. Central EUS CPN was used in the first group and bilateral EUS CPN in the second. The measurement of pain was made with a visual analog pain scale (VAPS) applied before and after the procedure. Follow-up was made at weeks 2 and 4 after the procedure. The use of morphine before and after EUS CPN was evaluated. Complications related to the procedure were recorded. RESULTS: A total of 53 patients underwent EUS CPN, 21 (39.6%) with the central technique and 32 (60.4%) with bilateral injection; 29 were women (54.7%) and the median age was 59 (30-85) years. The tumor was located in the head of the pancreas in 24 (45.3%) patients, the neck in 14 (26.4%), the body in 26 (49.1%) and in the tail of the pancreas in 8 (15.1%). Nearly, 14 (26.4%) patients had more than one pancreatic segment involved. There was no difference in the median (range) percent pain reduction from baseline-4 weeks later was 50% (0-100) vs 60% (0-100), for central and bilateral techniques, respectively; P = 0.18. In total, 60.4% of patients had a reduction of 50% punctuation in the VAPS. No major complications were detected. CONCLUSIONS: EUS CPN is useful for the management of pain in patients with unresectable pancreatic cancer, but there is no significant difference between central vs bilateral techniques.},

However, little is known about the accuracy of EGD-based diagnosis or the outcomes of the patients who undergo this procedure. We examined the diagnostic yield of EGD and short-term outcomes of children who underwent this procedure for chronic abdominal pain. METHODS: We conducted a prospective study of 290 children (4-18 years old; mean age, 11.9 +/- 3.5 years; 93 girls) who underwent EGD for the primary indication of chronic abdominal pain (216 with at least 1 alarm feature) at a US pediatric gastroenterology referral center. We collected data on demographic features (age, sex), clinical characteristics (alarm features, Rome III criteria), and EGD results for each patient. All subjects with diagnostic lesions were followed for at least 1 year after EGD to determine short-term outcomes. RESULTS: Overall, EGD provided an accurate diagnosis for 109 children (38%). Diagnoses included esophagitis (21.0%), eosinophilic gastroenteritis (4.1%), eosinophilic esophagitis (3.8%), Helicobacter pylori infection (2.0%), celiac disease (0.6%), and Crohn's disease (0.4%). Short-term outcomes were available for 81% of patients with diagnostic findings, and medical therapy was effective in approximately 67% of these children. CONCLUSIONS: EGD is valuable for the diagnosis of children with abdominal pain, with a 38% diagnostic yield. EGD identified disorders for which medical therapy was effective in 67% of children during the year after diagnosis.},

   abstract = {Whole-grain foods such as oats may protect against colorectal cancer and have benefits on inflammatory bowel disease and coeliac disease. The present study aimed to systematically review the literature describing intervention studies that investigated the effects of oats or oat bran on risk factors for bowel disease. A literature search was conducted using Embase, Medline and the Cochrane library, which identified 654 potential articles. Thirty-eight articles describing twenty-nine studies met the inclusion criteria. Two studies carried out in participants with a history of colorectal adenomas found no effects of increased oat-bran intake on indirect risk makers for colorectal cancer. One of two interventions with oat bran in patients with ulcerative colitis showed small improvements in the patients' conditions. Most of the eleven studies carried out in adults with coeliac disease showed no negative effects of uncontaminated oat consumption. The fourteen studies carried out in volunteers with no history of bowel disease suggest that oats or oat bran can significantly increase stool weight and decrease constipation, but there is a lack of evidence to support a specific effect of oats on bowel function compared with other cereals. A long-term dietary intake of oats or oat bran could benefit inflammatory bowel disorders, but this remains to be proven. A protective effect on colorectal adenoma and cancer incidence has not yet been convincingly shown. The majority of patients with coeliac disease could consume up to 100 g/d of uncontaminated oats, which would increase the acceptability of, and adherence to, a gluten-free diet.},

The following two themes associated with health risks were covered: (1) the impact of age and diet on the gut microbiota and (2) the gut microbiota's interaction with the host. The strong influence of the maternal gut microbiota on neonatal colonisation was reported, as well as rapid changes in the gut microbiome of older people who move from community living to residential care. The effects of dietary changes on gut metabolism were described and the potential influence of inter-individual microbiota differences was noted, in particular the presence/absence of keystone species involved in butyrate metabolism. Several speakers highlighted the association between certain metabolic disorders and imbalanced or less diverse microbiota. Data from metagenomic analyses and novel techniques (including an ex vivo human mucosa model) provided new insights into the microbiota's influence on coeliac, obesity-related and inflammatory diseases, as well as the potential of probiotics. Akkermansia muciniphila and Faecalibacterium prausnitzii were suggested as targets for intervention. Host-microbiota interactions were explored in the context of gut barrier function, pathogenic bacteria recognition, and the ability of the immune system to induce either tolerogenic or inflammatory responses. There was speculation that the gut microbiota should be considered a separate organ, and whether analysis of an individual's microbiota could be useful in identifying their disease risk and/or therapy; however, more research is needed into specific diseases, different population groups and microbial interventions including probiotics.},

This host-microbiota interaction may influence the development of CD and possibly other diseases with autoimmune components. We examined duodenal biopsies from a total of 30 children, of which 10 had both celiac disease (CD) and type 1 diabetes (T1D); 10 had CD alone; and 10 were suspected of having gastrointestinal disease, but had normal duodenal histology (non-CD controls). Patients with both CD and T1D were examined before and after remission following a gluten-free diet. We performed lectin histochemistry using peanut agglutinin (PNA) and Ulex europaeus agglutinin (UEA) staining for Gal-beta(1,3)-GalNAc and Fucalpha1-2Gal-R, respectively, of the glycocalyx/mucous layer. The staining was scored based on dissemination of stained structures on a scale from 0 to 3. Evaluation of the scores revealed no difference between biopsies obtained before and after remission in the group of children with both CD and T1D. A comparison of this pre-remission group with the children who had CD alone or the non-CD controls also showed no significant differences. Based on our material, we found no indication that the presence of Gal-beta(1,3)-GalNAc or Fucalpha1-2Gal-R is involved in the susceptibility to CD, or that the disease process affects the expression of these carbohydrates.},

   abstract = {Dietary interventions like gluten-free and casein-free diets have been reported to improve intestinal, autoimmune and neurological symptoms in patients with a variety of conditions; however, the underlying mechanism of benefit for such diets remains unclear. Epigenetic programming, including CpG methylation and histone modifications, occurring during early postnatal development can influence the risk of disease in later life, and such programming may be modulated by nutritional factors such as milk and wheat, especially during the transition from a solely milk-based diet to one that includes other forms of nutrition. The hydrolytic digestion of casein (a major milk protein) and gliadin (a wheat-derived protein) releases peptides with opioid activity, and in the present study, we demonstrate that these food-derived proline-rich opioid peptides modulate cysteine uptake in cultured human neuronal and gastrointestinal (GI) epithelial cells via activation of opioid receptors. Decreases in cysteine uptake were associated with changes in the intracellular antioxidant glutathione and the methyl donor S-adenosylmethionine. Bovine and human casein-derived opioid peptides increased genome-wide DNA methylation in the transcription start site region with a potency order similar to their inhibition of cysteine uptake. Altered expression of genes involved in redox and methylation homeostasis was also observed. These results illustrate the potential of milk- and wheat-derived peptides to exert antioxidant and epigenetic changes that may be particularly important during the postnatal transition from placental to GI nutrition. Differences between peptides derived from human and bovine milk may contribute to developmental differences between breastfed and formula-fed infants. Restricted antioxidant capacity, caused by wheat- and milk-derived opioid peptides, may predispose susceptible individuals to inflammation and systemic oxidation, partly explaining the benefits of gluten-free or casein-free diets.},

   abstract = {Celiac disease (CD) has a multifactorial etiology with complex genetics and frequently occurs in association with other autoimmune disorders. Even though triggered by a dietary antigen, it shows many autoimmune features, the most peculiar being the presence of high titers of anti-tissue transglutaminase 2 autoantibodies, produced in the small intestinal mucosa since the early stages of the disease. More than 60% of CD-associated susceptibility loci are shared with at least another autoimmune condition, suggesting common pathogenic mechanisms. In particular, recognition of peptides by HLA molecules, posttranslational modifications required for optimal peptide binding and immune mechanisms leading to tissue damage have been found in CD as well as in other autoimmune diseases. This review briefly summarizes the main autoimmune features of CD, underlining the similarities with other autoimmune disorders, in particular with type 1 diabetes mellitus. Furthermore, the role of gluten and microbiome in driving autoimmunity is discussed.},

   abstract = {OBJECTIVES: Metabolic bone disease remains a significant and common complication of celiac disease (CD). Several studies have demonstrated low bone mineral density (BMD) at the time of CD diagnosis in both children and adults. Low BMD in children and adolescents is defined as an areal BMD <2 SD below the age-adjusted mean value (z score <-2 SD). The aim of the study was to evaluate the BMD in a pediatric population with CD at diagnosis and to correlate z score value, anti-tissue transglutaminase type 2 antibody (anti-tTG2) titer, symptoms, and Marsh-Oberhuber (MO) grading. METHODS: We enrolled 99 patients with celiac disease (male 35, female 64) ages 4 to 15 years at the diagnosis. All of the patients had positive test results for anti-tTG2 antibodies and histological lesions graded according to MO classification, and underwent lumbar dual-energy x-ray absorptiometry. BMD was estimated by z score. RESULTS: Low BMD (z score </=-2 SD) was found in 13 (13.13%) patients; 22 (22.22%) patients with CD showed -2 < z score </= -1; -1 < z score < 0 was found in 41 (41.41%) patients. z score >/= 0 was detected only in 23 (23.23%) patients with CD. Mean BMD value in patients with CD is z score -0.68. No correlations were found between z score value and anti-tTG2 titer (Spearman rho 0.13), between z score value and MO degree (Spearman rho -0.17), and between z score and symptoms (Spearman rho-0.10). CONCLUSIONS: BMD of patients with CD at diagnosis does not seem to correlate with MO degree, anti-tTG2 titer, and symptoms. At the moment, we do not have clinical predictors for low mineral density in children with CD.},

   abstract = {BACKGROUND/OBJECTIVES: In the era of modern multidisciplinary clinical management, very little is known about the prevalence and presentation of malnutrition in children with gastrointestinal disorders (GastroD) particularly employing composite, global measures of nutritional status. SUBJECTS/METHODS: Anthropometry, body composition, dietary intake, eating habits and grip strength were assessed with bedside methods in 168 patients from outpatient gastroenterology clinics (n, median (IQR) years; Crohn's disease (CD): n=53, 14.2 (11.6:15.4); ulcerative colitis (UC): n=27, 12.2 (10.7:14.2); coeliac disease: n=31, 9.3 (7.5:13.6); other GastroD: n=57, 9.8 (7.2:13.8)) and compared with 62 contemporary healthy controls (n, median (IQR): 9.8 (6.9:13.8)) and the results of the recent UK, National Diet and Nutritional Survey (NDNS). RESULTS: Children with CD had lower BMI z-scores than controls (median (IQR): -0.3 (-0.9:0.4) vs 0.3 (-0.6:1.4); P=0.02) but only 2% were classified as thin (BMI z-score <-2 s.d.). The prevalence of obesity in children with UC was 19%, 6% in CD, 11% in children with other GastroD and 15% in controls. No difference was found in grip strength measurement between groups. Except for CD children, the proportion of patients with suboptimal micronutrient intake was similar to that of controls and the cohort of children from the latest NDNS. A higher proportion of children with CD had suboptimal intake for riboflavin, vitamin B6 and calcium and consumed significantly more meat products, juices (including carbonated drinks), spreads/jams and crisps and savoury snacks and significantly fewer portions of dairy, fish, fruits and vegetables compared with healthy controls. CONCLUSIONS: GastroD affect children's body composition, growth, strength, dietary intake and eating habits, particularly CD, but to a lesser extent than expected.},

   abstract = {Approximately half of the children with ulcerative colitis (UC) have refractory, relapsing or steroid-dependent disease. UC in children is more extensive than in adults, presents more often with severe attacks and carries a more aggressive disease course. Therefore, although a step-up approach is usually recommended in UC, aggressive therapy will often be indicated in children since steroid dependency should never be tolerated. It is vital to ensure that in every resistant case, the symptoms are truly related to the inflammatory disease activity and not to other conditions such as poor adherence to treatment, infections, adverse reactions to drugs, irritable bowel syndrome, lactose intolerance, celiac disease and bacterial overgrowth. The clinician should be ready to escalate therapy in a timely manner but only after ensuring optimization of current treatments. Optimization may include, among others, appropriate dosage, utilization of assays that determine thiopurine, calcineurin inhibitors and anti-tumor necrosis factor levels, introduction of combination therapy when indicated (enemas and immunomodulators) and a long enough time for treatment to become effective. Colectomy is always a valid option and should be discussed before major treatment escalations. Experimental therapies can be considered when all else fails and the family prefers to avoid colectomy. The management of refractory and relapsing disease is particularly challenging in children, and this review summarizes the available evidence to guide treatment decisions in this setup.},

   abstract = {BACKGROUND & AIMS: Women with coeliac disease may have a lower bone mineral density due to the malabsorption of calcium before diagnosis. A high sodium excretion is associated with increased calcium and bone loss. Our aim was to describe the bone mineral density (BMD) and sodium excretion in women with coeliac disease. METHODS: In a cross-sectional study BMD of the lumbar spine and hip was assessed by dual energy X-ray absorptiometry. Sodium, potassium and calcium excretion were measured from a 24 h urine collection. RESULTS: In 33 women (51 +/- 16 yr) BMD was 1.14 +/- 0.19 g/cm(2) and 0.94 +/- 0.14 g/cm(2) at the lumbar spine and hip respectively. Age matched Z-scores were -0.1 +/- 1.2 and -0.3 +/- 1.1 at lumbar spine and hip respectively. Sodium excretion was 107 +/- 51 mmol/d; 14 (42%) had a sodium excretion >100 mmol Na/d (145 +/- 45 mmol/d). Potassium and calcium excretion were 87 +/- 25 mmol/d and 4.1 +/- 2.0 mmol/d respectively. In women with Na excretion >100 mmol Na/d, Ca excretion was significantly greater than those with <100 mmol/d (4.9 +/- 2.0 vs 3.4 +/- 1.8, p < 0.05). Sodium excretion and BMI were positively correlated (r = 0.61, p < 0.001) as were sodium and calcium excretion (r = 0.43, p < 0.05). Sodium excretion was inversely related to femoral neck BMD (t = -2.4 p = 0.023) after adjustment for weight, age, years since diagnosis and potassium excretion. Weight, but no other variable, was a predictor of BMD at the lumbar spine (t = 2.58 p = 0.018). CONCLUSIONS: Sodium excretion was inversely related and potassium excretion positively related to femoral neck density which was similar to age matched women without coeliac disease.},

METHODS: Thirty patients with CD ages 1 to 15 years were compared with 50 healthy age-, sex-, and body mass index-matched controls. Screening for hepatitis A and B serology was carried out before vaccination. Susceptible cases received 20 mug of recombinant DNA vaccine for hepatitis B (0,1, and 6 months) and 720 milliELISA units of inactivated hepatitis A virus (HAV) vaccine (0 and 6 months). Postvaccination serologic evaluation was performed 1 month after the last dose of primary vaccination, 1 month after the booster dose, and once every year during follow-up. RESULTS: Sixteen patients and 35 controls received hepatitis A vaccine; protective anti-HAV antibodies were developed in 12 (75%) of the patients and all of the controls (75% vs 100%, respectively; 95% confidence interval [CI] 0.47-0.92, P=0.007). Thirty patients and 50 controls received hepatitis B vaccine, and 70% of the patients vs 90% of the controls achieved seroprotection (anti-HBs titers >/=10 mIU/mL) 1 month after primary vaccination (95% CI 0.74-0.90, P=0.03). Four patients were unresponsive to both of the vaccines. The overall seroprotection rates were 96% in controls and 80% in patients after the whole hepatitis B vaccination series (95% CI 0.04-0.18, P=0.04). No significant reduction was observed in antibody response among patients and controls during follow-up period. CONCLUSIONS: The rate of seroconversion to the hepatitis B virus- and HAV vaccine is lower in patients with CD than in healthy controls.},

   abstract = {OBJECTIVE: The association between celiac disease (CD) and liver disease in pediatrics is widely recognized, but its prevalence is unknown. This study aims to conduct a systematic review and meta-analysis to evaluate the prevalence of CD in children with cryptogenic persistent hypertransaminasemia (HTS) or autoimmune hepatitis (AIH), and vice versa. METHODS: We searched MEDLINE/PubMed, the Cochrane Library, Web of Science, and MD Consult from 1977 to May 2012 for studies reporting either CD and HTS or AIH. Pooled prevalences with 95% confidence intervals (CI) and relative risk (RR) were calculated. RESULTS: Nine studies (2046 patients) were identified. Pooled prevalences of CD in children with mild, nonspecific cryptogenic persistent HTS and vice versa were 12.0% (95% CI 4.17-29.96) and 36.0% (95% CI 32.15-40.11), respectively. A gluten-free diet normalized transaminase levels in 77% to 100% of patients with CD within 4 to 8 months. Pooled prevalences of CD in children with AIH and vice versa were 6.3% (95% CI 3.87-11.73) and 1.4% (95% CI 0.84-2.15), respectively. The RR of HTS in children with CD versus the general population, and of CD in children with HTS was 6.55 (95% CI 5.65-7.60) and 11.59 (95% CI 3.80-35.33), respectively. The corresponding RR of AIH in children with CD was 188.54 (95% CI 92.23-385.43). The RR of CD in children with AIH was 6.63 (95% CI 3.86-11.40). CONCLUSIONS: CD is associated with elevated transaminase levels in about one-third of newly diagnosed children. Cryptogenic persistent HTS may signal gluten-dependent nonspecific mild hepatitis (12.0% of cases) or more rarely (6.3%) severe CD-related autoimmune hepatopathy. RRs confirm these trends in the considered associations.},

   abstract = {BACKGROUND: Despite great improvements in serologic testing, duodenal biopsies are still required to diagnose the majority of celiac disease (CD) cases. Nevertheless, the histologic pattern of CD is often patchy, leading to the risk of missing the diagnosis. OBJECTIVE: To evaluate the patchiness of the CD histologic lesions along the small bowel (SB), push enteroscopy has been performed instead of conventional upper GI endoscopy. DESIGN: Prospective, single-center study. SETTING: Tertiary-care referral center. PATIENTS: A total of 41 pediatric patients with suspected CD. INTERVENTION: Prospective evaluation of bulb, duodenal, and jejunal biopsy specimens in the diagnosis of CD. MAIN OUTCOME MEASUREMENTS: Pattern of lesion distribution along the SB (from bulb up to 60 cm beyond the ligament of Treitz) and yield as well accuracy of pediatric CD diagnosis by using push enteroscopy. RESULTS: There was a homogeneous pattern of histologic damage in 17 patients (41.5%), whereas 24 patients (58.5%) had a lesion pattern of patchiness. The second and fourth duodenal regions were involved in 38 children (92.7%) and 37 children (90.2%), respectively; the bulb was involved in 37 patients (90.2%); both distal and proximal jejunal samples showed histologic lesions in 38 children (92.7%). In 1 patient, without lesions in the bulb and duodenum, CD was diagnosed according to proximal and distal jejunal biopsies only (3B and C, respectively). A significant correlation was found between the degree of villous atrophy and the serum anti-transglutaminase titer. LIMITATIONS: Small sample size; academic tertiary-care setting. CONCLUSION: CD histologic lesions often have a discontinuous distribution along the SB, occasionally with an exclusive jejunal involvement. A high degree of villous atrophy correlates with a high anti-transglutaminase titer. When the new ESPGHAN "biopsy-sparing" criteria are not applicable, in case of potential CD, push enteroscopy might be a valuable second-step tool to re-evaluate and identify false "potential" CD hiding exclusive jejunal lesions.},

   abstract = {OBJECTIVES: Celiac disease (CD), a genetically predisposed intolerance for gluten, is associated with an increased risk of major depressive disorder (MDD). We investigated whether dietary intake and serum levels of the essential n-3 polyunsaturated fatty acids (PUFA) eicosapentaenoic acid (EPA) and docosahexanoic acid (DHA) found in fatty fish play a role in this association. METHODS: Cross-sectional study in 71 adult CD patients and 31 healthy volunteers, matched on age, gender and level of education, who were not using n-3 PUFA supplements. Dietary intake, as assessed using a 203-item food frequency questionnaire, and serum levels of EPA and DHA were compared in analyses of covariance, adjusting for potential confounders. Serum PUFA were determined using gas chromatography. RESULTS: Mean serum DHA was significantly higher in CD patients (1.72 mass%) than controls (1.28 mass%) after multivariable adjustment (mean diff. 0.45 mass%; 95% CI: 0.22-0.68; p = 0.001). The mean intake of EPA plus DHA did not differ between CD patients and controls after multivariable adjustment (0.15 and 0.22 g/d, respectively; p = 0.10). There were no significant differences in intake or serum levels of EPA and DHA between any of the CD patient groups (never depressed, current MDD, minor/partially remitted MDD, remitted MDD) and controls. CONCLUSIONS: Patients on a long term gluten-free diet had similar intakes of EPA plus DHA compared to controls. Contrary to expectations, DHA serum levels were significantly higher in CD patients compared to healthy controls and were unrelated to MDD status.},

   abstract = {Recent studies suggest that migraine may be associated with gastrointestinal (GI) disorders, including irritable bowel syndrome (IBS), inflammatory bowel syndrome, and celiac disease. Here, an overview of the associations between migraine and GI disorders is presented, as well as possible mechanistic links and clinical implications. People who regularly experience GI symptoms have a higher prevalence of headaches, with a stronger association with increasing headache frequency. Children with a mother with a history of migraine are more likely to have infantile colic. Children with migraine are more likely to have experienced infantile colic compared to controls. Several studies demonstrated significant associations between migraine and celiac disease, inflammatory bowel disease, and IBS. Possible underlying mechanisms of migraine and GI diseases could be increased gut permeability and inflammation. Therefore, it would be worthwhile to investigate these mechanisms further in migraine patients. These mechanisms also give a rationale to investigate the effects of the use of pre- and probiotics in migraine patients.},

   abstract = {BACKGROUND: Celiac disease (CD) is an intestinal inflammation driven by gluten-reactive CD4(+) T cells. Due to lack of selective markers it has not been determined whether defects in inducible regulatory T cell (Treg) differentiation are associated with CD. This is of importance as changes in numbers of induced Treg could be indicative of defects in mucosal tolerance development in CD. Recently, we have shown that, after encounter of retinoic acid during differentiation, circulating gut-imprinted T cells express CD62L(neg)CD38(+). Using this new phenotype, we now determined whether alterations occur in the frequency of natural CD62L(+)Foxp3(+) Treg or mucosally-imprinted CD62L(neg)CD38(+)Foxp3(+) Treg in peripheral blood of CD patients. In particular, we compared pediatric CD, aiming to select for disease at onset, with adult CD. METHODS: Cell surface markers, intracellular Foxp3 and Helios were determined by flow cytometry. Foxp3 expression was also detected by immunohistochemistry in duodenal tissue of CD patients. RESULTS: In children, the percentages of peripheral blood CD4(+)Foxp3(+) Treg were comparable between CD patients and healthy age-matched controls. Differentiation between natural and mucosally-imprinted Treg on the basis of CD62L and CD38 did not uncover differences in Foxp3. In adult patients on gluten-free diet and in refractory CD increased percentages of circulating natural CD62L(+)Foxp3(+) Treg, but normal mucosally-imprinted CD62L(neg)CD38(+)Foxp3(+) Treg frequencies were observed. CONCLUSIONS: Our data exclude that significant numeric deficiency of mucosally-imprinted or natural Foxp3(+) Treg explains exuberant effector responses in CD. Changes in natural Foxp3(+) Treg occur in a subset of adult patients on a gluten-free diet and in refractory CD patients.},

   abstract = {Celiac disease (CD) is caused by inflammatory CD4(+) T-cell responses to dietary gluten. It is unclear whether interleukin (IL)-21 and IL-17A contribute to CD onset and lesion severity; therefore, we investigated IL-21 and IL-17A expression in biopsies from pediatric CD patients with different histopathological scores. High numbers of IL-21-producing cells were observed in pediatric CD lesions, even Marsh 1-2 lesions, whereas increased numbers of IL-17 secreting cells were not observed. Intraepithelial lymphocytes, CD4(+) T cells and also neutrophils secreted IL-21. Flow cytometry of lamina propria cells revealed a large population of IL-21- and interferon-gamma (IFN-gamma)-secreting CD3(+) T cells that did not secrete IL-17A. Adult CD patient biopsies also contained high numbers of IL-21-positive cells; however, enhanced numbers of IL-17-positive cells were observed in a small subgroup of patients with severe lesions. As duodenal tissue damage increases contact with microbe-associated molecular patterns, we hypothesized that microbial sensing by Toll-like receptors (TLRs) modulates T cell-derived cytokine secretion. Costimulation with TLR3 ligands during polyclonal T-cell activation significantly increased IL-21 secretion, whereas TLR2 ligands selectively enhanced IL-17A. These results demonstrate that an IL-17A-independent increase in IL-21 production by CD4(+) T cells is characteristic of pediatric CD. We hypothesize that incidental IL-17 secretion is caused by tissue damage rather than gluten-specific responses.},

   abstract = {BACKGROUND & AIMS: The European Society for Pediatric Gastroenterology and Nutrition proposed guidelines for the diagnosis of celiac disease, stating that duodenal biopsy is no longer needed if patients have symptoms and levels of immunoglobulin A anti-tissue transglutaminase (IgA anti-tTG) more than 10-fold the cut-off value. We evaluated the accuracy of this guideline in a well-characterized population using different commercial assays. METHODS: We analyzed levels of IgA anti-tTG in serum samples from 104 consecutive pediatric and adult patients who were not deficient in IgA and were diagnosed with celiac disease from August 1, 2000, to December 31, 2009. We also analyzed serum samples from 537 consecutive patients without celiac disease (controls), collected from May 1, 2004, to October 12, 2006, who underwent intestinal biopsy analysis. Serum levels of antibodies were quantified using assays from Bio-Rad, INOVA, Genesis, and Thermo Fisher. RESULTS: The likelihood ratio (probability of a specific result in patients divided by the probability of the same result in controls) for celiac disease increased with levels of IgA anti-tTG in all assays. Depending on the assay, the likelihood ratio for levels greater than 10-fold the cut-off value ranged from 111 to 294. The percentage of patients with celiac disease with levels of IgA anti-tTG greater than 10-fold the cut-off value ranged from 41% to 61%, depending on the assay. For levels of anti-tTG greater than 10-fold the cut-off value, the post-test probabilities for celiac disease (probability of disease, based on pretest probability and test result) were, depending on the assay, 89%-96% and 53%-75% for pretest probabilities (probability of disease depending on symptoms) of 7% and 1%, respectively. CONCLUSIONS: To diagnose celiac disease based on serologic factors, it might be best to define thresholds for levels of IgA anti-tTG based on a predefined likelihood ratio or post-test probability, instead of a multiple of a cut-off value. Patients with a high pretest probability and levels of anti-tTG greater than 10-fold the cut-off value have a high probability for having celiac disease, aiding clinical decision making.},

METHODS: The present study surveyed adults with CD (n = 1,583) and adults with GS (n = 797) about their reported difficulty following a GFD, including assessing the role of food labels and GF claims, as well as other factors known to contribute to this difficulty. A two-sample t-test and chi-squared tests for equality of means or proportions were used for the descriptive data and ordinal logistic regression (OLR) was used to model associations. RESULTS: On average, individuals with GS reported slightly more difficulty following the GFD than did participants with CD. According to the OLR results, reading the food label often was significantly associated with less reported difficulty following a GFD, whereas consuming packaged processed foods and looking for GF claims more often were significantly associated with more reported difficulty for both respondent groups. CONCLUSIONS: Individuals with GS may rely more heavily on the GF claim for information about a product's gluten content. Individuals with CD, on the other hand, may be more experienced food label readers and may rely more on the ingredient list for finding GF foods. More studies are needed aiming to understand the role of the food label in facilitating consumers' ability to follow a GFD.},

   abstract = {Steady advances in our knowledge of the composition and function of the human microbiome at multiple body sites including the gut, skin and airways will likely contribute to our understanding of mechanisms of probiotic action by beneficial microbes. Microbe:microbe and microbe:human interactions are important considerations as we select probiotics for pediatric patients in the future. Although our knowledge about the composition of the microbiome is progressing rapidly, many gaps exist about the functional capacity and metabolic machinery of the human microbiome. Based on a limited amount of data, probiotics appear capable of altering the composition and function of the microbiome. Probiotics may be part of dietary strategies that combine ways to enhance microbiome function with nutrients that may be converted to active compounds promoting human health. Probiotics have yielded beneficial effects in numerous studies in the context of different diseases in pediatric gastroenterology. These disease states include necrotizing enterocolitis, antibiotic-associated diarrhea and colitis, acute gastroenteritis and irritable bowel syndrome. In the skin and airways, it is unclear if probiotics can affect the function of the microbiome to reduce the impact of diseases such as asthma and atopic dermatitis. An enhanced understanding of the effects of probiotics on the microbiome should facilitate selection of optimal probiotic strains for specific diseases in the future.},

   abstract = {The downstream cascade of the inflammatory response to gliadin in celiac intestinal mucosa encompasses the early activation of the innate immunity that triggers the adaptive response. Therefore, the in vitro study of the pathogenic mechanism of celiac disease (CD) on enterocytes alone or mucosal T lymphocytes alone does not fully consider all the aspects of gliadin-dependent inflammation. Although the in vitro culture of specimens of intestinal mucosa obtained from celiac patients is the gold standard for the study of CD, this technique presents several technical challenges and the bioptic specimens are not easily available. So, in this paper, we described the gliadin-dependent cytokine production in a bidimensional cellular system, which is able to mimic both the innate and the adaptive steps of the mucosal immune response of CD. In the upper compartment, the intestinal epithelial cells are grown on a filter, and in the lower compartment, the mononuclear cells isolated from peripheral blood of celiac patients are cultured. Cells were apically exposed to the toxic gliadin peptide p31-43 for 3 h and then with the immunodominant gliadin fragment palpha-9 for 21 h. The incubation with gliadin peptides resulted in increased levels of IL-15, INF-gamma, IL-6, tumor necrosis factor (TNF)-alpha, IL-1beta, and CCL 2, 3 and 4 in the basal supernatants, with respect to cells exposed to medium alone. The p31-43-driven epithelial priming of mucosal response consists of transglutaminase (TG2)-mediated deamidation of the immunostimulatory gliadin peptides, as demonstrated by the inhibition of palpha-9 activity, when the system is exposed to blocking anti-TG2 antibody.},

Drainage of the mesenteric blood supply to the portal vein permits absorbed and/or translocated nutrients, toxins, bacterial elements, cytokines, and immunocytes to gain hepatic access. Liver problems in digestive disorders may range from nonspecific hepatocellular enzyme elevations to significant pathologic processes that may progress to end-stage liver disease. Hepatobiliary manifestations of primary GI diseases in childhood and adolescence are not uncommon and include several well-described associations, such as sclerosing cholangitis with inflammatory bowel disease. Liver damage may also result from the effects of drugs used to treat GI diseases, for example, the hepatotoxicity of immunomodulatory therapies. This review highlights the important features of the hepatic and biliary abnormalities associated with 3 common pediatric GI conditions: inflammatory bowel disease, celiac disease, and cystic fibrosis.},

   abstract = {BACKGROUND: A window of opportunity has been suggested for reducing the risk of celiac disease by introducing gluten to infants at 4 to 6 months of age. METHODS: We performed a multicenter, randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled dietary-intervention study involving 944 children who were positive for HLA-DQ2 or HLA-DQ8 and had at least one first-degree relative with celiac disease. From 16 to 24 weeks of age, 475 participants received 100 mg of immunologically active gluten daily, and 469 received placebo. Anti-transglutaminase type 2 and antigliadin antibodies were periodically measured. The primary outcome was the frequency of biopsy-confirmed celiac disease at 3 years of age. RESULTS: Celiac disease was confirmed by means of biopsies in 77 children. To avoid underestimation of the frequency of celiac disease, 3 additional children who received a diagnosis of celiac disease according to the 2012 European Society for Pediatric Gastroenterology, Hepatology, and Nutrition diagnostic criteria (without having undergone biopsies) were included in the analyses (80 children; median age, 2.8 years; 59% were girls). The cumulative incidence of celiac disease among patients 3 years of age was 5.2% (95% confidence interval [CI], 3.6 to 6.8), with similar rates in the gluten group and the placebo group (5.9% [95% CI, 3.7 to 8.1] and 4.5% [95% CI, 2.5 to 6.5], respectively; hazard ratio in the gluten group, 1.23; 95% CI, 0.79 to 1.91). Rates of elevated levels of anti-transglutaminase type 2 and antigliadin antibodies were also similar in the two study groups (7.0% [95% CI, 4.7 to 9.4] in the gluten group and 5.7% [95% CI, 3.5 to 7.9] in the placebo group; hazard ratio, 1.14; 95% CI, 0.76 to 1.73). Breast-feeding, regardless of whether it was exclusive or whether it was ongoing during gluten introduction, did not significantly influence the development of celiac disease or the effect of the intervention. CONCLUSIONS: As compared with placebo, the introduction of small quantities of gluten at 16 to 24 weeks of age did not reduce the risk of celiac disease by 3 years of age in this group of high-risk children.

   abstract = {The paradigm of disease burden in the developed world has changed drastically in the last few decades from predominately infections to immune-mediated diseases (autoimmunity and allergy) because of alterations in the Western lifestyle (improved sanitation, immunizations, antibiotic usage and altered dietary intake). A diverse balanced microbiota is necessary for the development of an appropriate innate and adaptive immune response. There is strong evidence that disruption of the normal colonization process can lead to alterations in the important symbiotic relationship that is necessary for immune homeostasis. For example, infants born by cesarean section or receiving excessive perinatal antibiotics have inadequate initial colonization and aberrant mucosal immune function. As a result, later in childhood, they express an increased incidence in asthma and autoimmune diseases (e.g. celiac disease). An important component of initial colonization is the infant's diet. Breast milk contains a variety of nondigestible oligosaccharides which function as prebiotics preferentially stimulating proliferation of Bifidobacteria and Lactobacilli, important health-promoting bacteria, and cause fermentation of the oligosaccharides into short-chain fatty acids. In the absence of breastfeeding for the first 6 months of life, formula containing pre- and probiotics may overcome an initial inadequate colonization process and help establish a normal mucosal immune system.},

   abstract = {OBJECTIVES: Both breast-feeding duration and age at gluten introduction have been implicated in the pathogenesis of celiac disease (CD). We hypothesized that parental CD affects the feeding pattern of the offspring, mediated by parental health awareness increasing adherence to infant feeding guidelines. METHODS: Prospectively collected infant feeding data were obtained through the All Babies in Southeast Sweden study. Information regarding infant feeding was available in 9414 children. Twenty-two mothers had a history of biopsy-verified CD before delivery of a child in the study, and 9392 mothers had no diagnosis of CD before birth and thus constituted the unexposed or control population. Cox regression was used to compare the risk of early weaning and gluten introduction according to parental CD status, and logistic regression to assess whether mothers with CD were more likely to breast-feed their children at gluten introduction. RESULTS: Some 63% of children were breast-fed for at least 9 months. We found no association between maternal CD and early weaning (adjusted hazard ratio [HR] 1.0, 95% confidence interval [CI] 0.6-1.7), or between paternal CD and early weaning (HR 0.5, 95% CI 0.1-1.9). Sixty percent of children were introduced to gluten in months 5 and 6. Maternal CD was not associated with age at gluten introduction (adjusted HR 0.8, 95% CI 0.6-1.3). There was no statistically significant association between maternal CD and breast-feeding at the time of gluten introduction (odds ratio 1.4, 95% CI 0.4-4.7). CONCLUSIONS: Feeding patterns do not seem to vary between offspring and mothers with CD and those without.},

   abstract = {OBJECTIVES: To establish the incidence of childhood coeliac disease (CD) in Scotland between 1 September 2009 and 31 August 2010, to determine clinical features at presentation and reasons for diagnosis, and to identify any differences in incidence and practice between regions. DESIGN: Prospective data collection through the Scottish Paediatric Surveillance Unit (SPSU). Strategic contacts in each tertiary gastrointestinal region (East, West and North) were emailed monthly to report new cases of CD (<16 years). A clinical questionnaire was completed for each case. Additionally, regional laboratories were asked to report the number of diagnostic antibody tests for CD performed over the year. SETTING: This national study looked at the total cases within Scotland. Scotland has a population of 5.2 million, with the mid-year estimate in 2009 of 912 144 children under the age of 16. RESULTS: 91 new cases were reported, giving an overall adjusted incidence of 10.0/100 000/year. Incidence in the East was 16.3/100 000/year, West 8.1/100 000/year and North 7.7/100 000/year. Cases diagnosed due to active screening in the East (4.6/100 000/year) were more than twice the number observed in the West (2.0/100 000/year) and North (1.3/100 000/year), as was the incidence of classic cases. The most frequent symptoms reported were abdominal pain (50/91; 54.9%), failure to thrive (29/91; 31.9%), fatigue (29/91; 31.9%), diarrhoea (27/91; 29.7%) and bloating (19/91; 20.9%). Twenty-two children (24.2%) were diagnosed due to active screening, of which 14 had associated type 1 diabetes mellitus, one Down syndrome and seven had family history. Fifty-five per cent (12/22) of the patients diagnosed through active screening were asymptomatic. Significantly more CD diagnostic antibody tests were performed per head of population in the East compared with the West (OR 1.65, 95% CI 1.57 to 1.73) and North (OR 1.81, 95% CI 1.70 to 1.92). CONCLUSIONS: Approximately double the incidence of paediatric CD was observed in the East of Scotland. Evidence of more actively screened cases diagnosed and more antibody tests performed in the region suggests a lower threshold to test. An environmental influence cannot be dismissed since more classic cases were also captured. Further research is needed to highlight the role of any exogenous factors.},

   abstract = {BACKGROUND AND OBJECTIVES: Although the incidence of pediatric celiac disease (CD) is increasing globally, it is uncertain whether this is attributed to improved case ascertainment or signifies a true rise. We aimed to identify all incident cases of childhood CD in southeast Scotland over the period 1990 to 2009 to assess trends in total incidence and cases diagnosed as a result of (1) a classic presentation, (2) a nonclassic presentation, or (3) targeted screening. METHODS: Twenty-year retrospective cohort study of case notes, pathology databases, endoscopy, and patient records for all children (<16 years of age) diagnosed with CD on biopsy in southeast Scotland (at-risk population of 225000-233000). Data were age-gender standardized and Poisson regression models used to calculate changes in incidence over time. RESULTS: A total of 266 children were diagnosed from 1990 to 2009 with an increase in incidence from 1.8/100000 (95% confidence interval [CI] 1.1-2.7) to 11.7/100000 (95% CI 9.8-13.9) between the epochs 1990 to 1994 and 2005 to 2009, respectively (P < .0001). The incidence of nonclassic presentation (children with a monosymptomatic presentation and those with extraintestinal symptoms) and actively screened cases increased by 1566% (P < .05) and 1170% (P < .001) from 1990 to 1999 to 2000 to 2009, respectively. However, a rise in the incidence of Oslo classic cases from 1.51/100000 (95% CI 0.91-2.38) in 1990 to 1994 to 5.22/100000 (95% CI 3.98-6.75) in 2005 to 2009 (P < .01) remained evident. CONCLUSIONS: The incidence of pediatric CD increased 6.4-fold over the 20 years. This study demonstrates that this rise is significant for classic CD, indicating a true rise in the incidence of pediatric CD.},

   abstract = {Autism spectrum disorders represent a diverse and heterogeneous array of conditions unified by the variable presence of specific behaviours impacting social and communicative functions (social affect) alongside other presentation. Common overt characteristics may come about as a consequence of several different genetic and biological processes differentially manifesting across different people or groups. The concept of plural 'autisms' is evolving, strengthened by an increasingly important evidence base detailing different developmental trajectories across the autism spectrum and the appearance of comorbidity variably interacting with core symptoms and onwards influencing quality of life. Reports that dietary intervention, specifically the removal of foods containing gluten and/or casein from the diet, may impact on the presentation of autism for some, complement this plural view of autism. Evidence suggestive of differing responses to the use of a gluten- and casein-free diet, defined as best- and non-response, has combined with some progress on determining the underlying genetic and biological correlates potentially related to such dietary elements. The preliminary suggestion of a possible diet-related autism phenotype is the result. This review will highlight several pertinent aspects onwards to an effect of food in some cases of autism including research on the pharmacological activity of food metabolites, immune response, issues with gut barrier function and some contribution from the gut microbiota. These represent promising areas in need of far greater research inspection in order to potentially define such a diet-related subgroup on the autism spectrum.},

   abstract = {Malabsorption, weight loss and vitamin/mineral-deficiencies characterize classical celiac disease (CD). This study aimed to assess the nutritional and vitamin/mineral status of current "early diagnosed" untreated adult CD-patients in the Netherlands. Newly diagnosed adult CD-patients were included (n = 80, 42.8 +/- 15.1 years) and a comparable sample of 24 healthy Dutch subjects was added to compare vitamin concentrations. Nutritional status and serum concentrations of folic acid, vitamin A, B(6), B(1)(2), and (25-hydroxy) D, zinc, haemoglobin (Hb) and ferritin were determined (before prescribing gluten free diet). Almost all CD-patients (87%) had at least one value below the lower limit of reference. Specifically, for vitamin A, 7.5% of patients showed deficient levels, for vitamin B(6) 14.5%, folic acid 20%, and vitamin B(1)(2) 19%. Likewise, zinc deficiency was observed in 67% of the CD-patients, 46% had decreased iron storage, and 32% had anaemia. Overall, 17% were malnourished (>10% undesired weight loss), 22% of the women were underweight (Body Mass Index (BMI) < 18.5), and 29% of the patients were overweight (BMI > 25). Vitamin deficiencies were barely seen in healthy controls, with the exception of vitamin B(1)(2). Vitamin/mineral deficiencies were counter-intuitively not associated with a (higher) grade of histological intestinal damage or (impaired) nutritional status. In conclusion, vitamin/mineral deficiencies are still common in newly "early diagnosed" CD-patients, even though the prevalence of obesity at initial diagnosis is rising. Extensive nutritional assessments seem warranted to guide nutritional advices and follow-up in CD treatment.},

Apart from the well-known association to HLA, there are currently 40 genomic loci associated to CD. Most of these loci show pleiotropic effects across many autoimmune diseases and highlight the importance of a dysregulated immune system in the predisposition to CD. It is still too early, however, to use genetics in clinical practice for predicting individual risk. The major challenge for the future is to translate genetic findings into a better understanding of the underlying disease mechanism and to design new ways to treat CD and prevent its development.},

A recent study (Kimura et al., 2011) demonstrated functional expression of FFA3 in the rodent sympathetic nervous system (SNS) providing a potential link between nutritional status and autonomic function. However, little is known of the source of endogenous ligands, signaling pathways, or effectors in sympathetic neurons. In this study, we found that FFA3 and FFA2 are unevenly expressed in the rat SNS with higher transcript levels in prevertebral (e.g., celiac-superior mesenteric and major pelvic) versus paravertebral (e.g., superior cervical and stellate) ganglia. FFA3, whether heterologously or natively expressed, coupled via PTX-sensitive G-proteins to produce voltage-dependent inhibition of N-type Ca(2+) channels (Cav2.2) in sympathetic neurons. In addition to acetate and propionate, we show that beta-hydroxybutyrate (BHB), a metabolite produced during ketogenic conditions, is also an FFA3 agonist. This contrasts with previous interpretations of BHB as an antagonist at FFA3. Together, these results indicate that endogenous BHB levels, especially when elevated under certain conditions, such as starvation, diabetic ketoacidosis, and ketogenic diets, play a potentially important role in regulating the activity of the SNS through FFA3.},

The aim of this study is to assess the feasibility of laparoscopic ischemic preconditioning of the stomach prior to thoracotomy, esophagectomy, and gastric pull-up with an intrathoracic anastomosis. A retrospective review of 24 consecutive patients between October 2008 and July 2011 with esophageal adenocarcinoma (stage I-III) undergoing laparoscopic gastric ischemic conditioning prior to esophagectomy was conducted. Conditioning included laparoscopic ligation of the left and short gastric arteries, celiac node dissection, and jejunostomy tube placement. Formal resection and reconstruction was then performed 4-10 days later. Of the 24 patients, 88% received neoadjuvant chemotherapy/radiation therapy. Twenty-three of the 24 patients underwent successful laparoscopic ischemic conditioning and subsequent esophagectomy. Total mean number of lymph nodes harvested was 21.8 (+/-8.0), and a mean of 5.3 (+/-2.4) celiac lymph nodes identified. There were no conversions to an open procedure. Length of stay was 3.8 (+/-4.8) days with a median length of stay of 2 (1-24) days. Three patients experienced anastomotic leak, six patients experience delayed gastric emptying, and two patients developed anastomotic stricture. There were no surgical site infections. R0 resection was achieved in all patients who underwent laparoscopic ischemic conditioning followed by esophagectomy. Laparoscopic ischemic conditioning of the gastric conduit has been shown to be feasible and safe.},

   abstract = {BACKGROUND AND AIM: Leonardo da Vinci's face symmetry derives from 3 equal craniofacial segments: trichion-nasion (tn), which represents the superior third of the face, nasion-subnasal (ns) that is the medium third of the face, and subnasal-gnathion (sg) that is the length of the lower third of the face. It has been reported that adult subjects with celiac disease (CD) can be identified on the basis of a greater extension of the forehead in comparison to the medium third of the face, with a high tn/ns ratio. The aim of the present study was to investigate the correlation between facial asymmetry and CD in childhood and adulthood. METHODS: We studied 126 biopsy-proven patients with CD (76 children and 50 adults) and 102 healthy controls (43 children and 59 adults). Their faces were photographed; the pictures were edited using a software program to calculate the facial segments. RESULTS: The tn length was significantly different between adult celiac and adult controls (7.43 +/- 1.46 cm vs 6.38 +/- 1.73 cm, P = 0.001). The cutoff of 6.5 cm tn, derived from receiver operating characteristic curve analysis, identified 43 of 50 patients (sensitivity 86%), but 34 of 59 controls were positive (specificity 54.2%). The positive predictive value was 56%; however, the tn/ns ratio was not significantly different between celiacs and controls. Neither the tn length nor the tn/ns ratio in celiacs correlated to the time of gluten exposure. CONCLUSIONS: Adults, but not children, with celiac disease show a forehead extension significantly greater than controls, but this test's specificity appears too low to be used in the screening of CD.},

   abstract = {Western countries are finding health care costs to be a continuously increasing financial burden in excess of previous budgetary allocations. Medical nutrition therapies (MNT) have proven to be an efficient cost minimising tool whilst concurrently improving the patient's quality of life. These MNTs are defined as specially processed or formulated foods that are used for the dietary management of patients. Among the medical foods, low-protein/protein-free (LP/PF) foods have been shown to improve the physical manifestation of metabolic disorders in patients with amino acid or protein-related diseases, such as Phenylketonuria, Tyrosinaemia type I, as well as chronic kidney, and coeliac. Most of the cereal-based LP/PF foods currently marketed are a blend of refined or chemically-based food ingredients with unpalatable frequently artificial flavours, having excessive sweetness to mask the chemical taste of ingredients (drug-like approach). However, the adoption of an alternative to convention, such as a food-like approach to developing medical foods, it is a surprisingly complex process. This is specifically true when the technological aspects of LP/PF foods and, in particular, protein-free cereal foods are considered. The primary processing issues arise while trying to replace gluten in baked cereal products. This represents a significant technological challenge, since gluten is an essential structural network-building protein necessary for baked goods. In this article, the suitable food technology challenges and strategies for developing LP/PF cereal foods able to overcome the significant limitations of a food-like approach will be addressed.},

The gluten-free diet is complex, costly and impacts on all activities involving food, making it difficult to maintain for a lifetime. The purpose of this cross-sectional study was to evaluate the difficulties experienced, the strategies used and the emotional impact of following a gluten-free diet among Canadians with coeliac disease. METHODS: A questionnaire was mailed to all members (n = 10 693) of both the Canadian Celiac Association and the Fondation quebecoise de la maladie coeliaque in 2008. RESULTS: The overall response rate was 72%. Results are presented for the 5912 respondents (>/=18 years) reporting biopsy-confirmed coeliac disease and/or dermatitis herpetiformis. Two-thirds never intentionally consumed gluten. Women reported significantly greater emotional responses to a gluten-free diet but, with time, were more accepting of it than men. Difficulties and negative emotions were experienced less frequently by those on the diet for >5 years, although food labelling and eating away from home remained very problematic. Frustration and isolation because of the diet were the most common negative emotions experienced. CONCLUSIONS: The present study quantifies the difficulties experienced, the strategies used and the emotional impact of following a gluten-free diet. It highlights the need to improve the training and education of dietitians, other health providers and the food service industry workers about coeliac disease and a gluten-free diet, with the aim of better helping individuals improve their adherence to a gluten-free diet and their quality of life.},

   abstract = {OBJECTIVES: Celiac disease is an enteropathy triggered by dietary gluten found in wheat, rye, and barley. Treatment involves a strict gluten-free diet (GFD). Quinoa is a highly nutritive plant from the Andes that has been recommended as part of a GFD. However, in-vitro data suggested that quinoa prolamins can stimulate innate and adaptive immune responses in celiac patients. Therefore, we aimed to evaluate the in-vivo effects of eating quinoa in adult celiac patients. METHODS: Nineteen treated celiac patients consumed 50 g of quinoa every day for 6 weeks as part of their usual GFD. We evaluated diet, serology, and gastrointestinal parameters. Furthermore, we carried out detail histological assessment of 10 patients before and after eating quinoa. RESULTS: Gastrointestinal parameters were normal. The ratio of villus height to crypt depth improved from slightly below normal values (2.8:1) to normal levels (3:1), surface-enterocyte cell height improved from 28.76 to 29.77 mum and the number of intra-epithelial lymphocytes per 100 enterocytes decreased from 30.3 to 29.7. Median values for all the blood tests remained within normal ranges, although total cholesterol (n=19) decreased from 4.6 to 4.3 mmol/l, low-density lipoprotein decreased from 2.46 to 2.45 mmol/l, high-density lipoprotein decreased from 1.8 to 1.68 mmol/l and triglycerides decreased from 0.80 to 0.79 mmol/l. CONCLUSIONS: Addition of quinoa to the GFD of celiac patients was well tolerated and did not exacerbate the condition. There was a positive trend toward improved histological and serological parameters, particularly a mild hypocholesterolemic effect. Overall, this is the first clinical data suggesting that daily 50 g of quinoa for 6 weeks can be safely tolerated by celiac patients. However, further studies are needed to determine the long-term effects of quinoa consumption.},

The research aim was to study the composition of amaranth flour of two types compared with semolina which is traditionally used for nutrition by Russian population, as well as to compare the composition of milk amaranth flour porridge with milk semolina porridge. The composition of amaranth whole-ground flour and amaranth flour of premium grade processed from amaranth seeds grown in Voronezh region has been researched. It is to be noted that protein content in amaranth flour was 10.8-24.3% higher than in semolina, and its biological value and NPU-coefficient were higher by 22.65 and 46.51% respectively; lysine score in amaranth flour protein of premium grade came up to 107.54%, and in semolina protein only 40.95%. The level of digestible carbohydrates, including starch, was lower in amaranth flour than in semolina by 2.79-12.85 and 4.76-15.85% respectively, while fiber content was 15.5-30 fold higher. Fat content in amaranth flour of premium grade was 2,4 fold lower than in whole-ground amaranth flour but it was 45% higher than in semolina. The main advantage of amaranth flour protein compared to wheat protein is the predominance of albumins and globulins and a minimal content of prolamines and alpha-gliadin complete absence. The specifics of chemical composition allow the amaranth flour to be recommended for being included into nutrition of both healthy children and adults and also celiac disease patients.},

   abstract = {Wheat is an important source of proteins and metabolites for human and animal nutrition. To assess the nutritional quality of wheat products, various protein and diverse metabolites have to be evaluated. The grain storage protein family of the alpha-gliadins are suggested to be the primary initiator of the inflammatory response to gluten in Celiac disease patients. With the technique of RNAi, the alpha-gliadin storage protein fraction in wheat grains was recently knocked down. From a patient's perspective, this is a desired approach, however, this study aims to evaluate whether such a down-regulation of these problematic alpha-gliadins also has unintended side-effects on other plant metabolites. Such uncontrolled and unknown arbitrary effects on any metabolite in plants designated for food production would surely represent an avoidable risk for the consumer. In general, alpha-gliadins are rich in sulfur, making their synthesis and content depended of the sulfur supply. For this reason, the influence of the application of increasing sulfur amounts on the metabolome of alpha-gliadin-deficient wheat was additionally investigated because it might be possible that e.g., considerable high/low amounts of S might increase or even induce such unintended effects that are not observable under moderate S nutrition. By silencing the alpha-gliadin genes, a recently developed wheat line that lacks the set of 75 corresponding alpha-gliadin proteins has become available. The plants were subsequently tested for RNAi-induced effects on metabolites that were not directly attributable to the specific effects of the RNAi-approach on the alpha-gliadin proteins. For this, GC-MS-based metabolite profiles were recorded. A comparison of wild type with gliadin-deficient plants cultivated in pot experiments revealed no differences in all 109 analyzed metabolites, regardless of the S-nutritional status. No unintended effects attributable to the RNAi-based specific genetic deletion of a storage protein fraction were observed.},

The present study aimed to evaluate the dietary intake of CD affected children on a GFD and compare it with non-celiac children and with Italian nutritional intakes recommendations, as well as evaluate the contribution of commercially available gluten-free products (GFPs). METHODS: Eighteen celiac children, median age 7.6 years, median GFD duration 4.2 years, and 18 non-celiac controls, were enrolled in a cross-sectional age-matched study. Dietary intakes of both groups were collected using a food frequency questionnaire and a 24-hour dietary recall. Nutritional intakes were compared between the group and controls and with Italian dietary reference values. The contribution of GFPs to energy and macronutrient intakes was evaluated. RESULTS: Median energy intake was significantly higher in CD patients than in controls (8961.8 and 5761.0 kJ day(-1); P < 0.001). CD subjects showed higher carbohydrate intakes and lower fat intakes compared to controls. Protein-derived energy did not differ. By contrast to control subjects, energy derived from carbohydrate intakes in CD children met the Italian recommendations. Both children groups showed higher protein and fat intakes than recommended in Italy. GFPs consumption accounted for 36.3% of daily total energy intake. CONCLUSIONS: Intakes of simple sugars, fats and protein exceeded the National recommendations for health. Children with CD had significantly higher energy intakes than controls, although body mass index was comparable across the groups. Lack of nutritional information for GFPs prevented complete dietary analysis of subfractions of fat and micronutrient intakes. This aspect need to be addressed if studies in this field are to be meaningful in the future.},
