   abstract = {Alpha-1-antitrypsin is a glycoprotein which is excreted in feces under three different forms of molecular weight 38, 45 and 51 kDa. The 45 and 38 kDa forms are the result of a partial or total removal of the carbohydrate moiety, respectively. We determined the molecular forms of fecal alpha-1-antitrypsin in 10 controls, 13 patients with protein-losing enteropathy other than inflammatory bowel disease, 70 patients with active (n = 55) (CDAI greater than 150) and inactive (n = 15) (CDAI less than 150) Crohn's disease, 14 patients with active (n = 12) and inactive (n = 2) ulcerative colitis, and 17 patients with ileostomy. Fecal 38 kDa alpha-1-antitrypsin was found in all controls, all patients with protein-losing enteropathy, in 82 percent of patients with inactive inflammatory bowel disease, and in 20 percent of patients with active inflammatory bowel disease. In contrast, the 51 kDa and 45 kDa forms were present in feces of 80 percent of patients with active inflammatory bowel disease, and in only 17 percent of patients with inactive inflammatory bowel disease. Patients with Crohn's disease and the 51 kDa form (n = 39) had significantly higher values of activity index (CDAI) and orosomucoid than patients with Crohn's disease and the 38 kDa form (n = 26) (P less than 0.01). Deglycosylated 38 kDa alpha-1-antitrypsin was never recovered in ileostomy samples. This suggests that deglycosylation of alpha-1-antitrypsin occurred in the colon and is impaired in patients with active inflammatory bowel disease.},

The aim of the present study was to determine if experimental folate deficiency increases the likelihood of developing neoplasia in rats treated with the carcinogen dimethylhydrazine. Weanling male Sprague-Dawley rats were fed with an amino acid-defined diet containing either 8 or 0 mg/kg folic acid. After 5 weeks of defined diet, weekly s.c. injections of dimethylhydrazine (20 mg/kg) were administered to both groups. Serum, whole blood, liver, and colonic folate concentrations at the time of sacrifice were significantly lower in folate-depleted animals (P less than 0.001). There were significant differences in the incidence of colonic neoplasia between the two groups after 20 weeks of dimethylhydrazine exposure: folate-deficient rats had a greater incidence of dysplasia (6 of 7 versus 2 of 7 animals; P less than 0.05) and carcinoma (6 of 7 versus 1 of 7 animals; P less than 0.01). Furthermore, a significantly greater proportion of folate-replete rats than folate-deficient rats were free of neoplastic lesions (5 of 7 versus 0 of 7 animals; P less than 0.05). These results suggest that, in this animal model, folate deficiency increases the risk of malignancy when there is an underlying predisposition to colorectal cancer.},

Infants in developed settings experience twice the hospitalization rate and more severe illness from lower respiratory tract infection, primarily respiratory syncytial virus. In developing countries the mortality risk is 4-fold. for otitis media, the relative risks were 3.3-4.3 for Finnish infants. Bacterial meningitis and/or bacteremia had a 4-fold risk for hospitalization in a Connecticut study, and a 3-fold relative risk in 2 developing country studies. Human milk was the best preventative for bacteremia and necrotizing enterocolitis in prematures in British neonatal units. A 20-fold reduction in neonatal deaths occurred in Philippine study of breastfeeding, especially in low birth weight babies. Diarrhea causes the most infant mortality in developing nations, where bottle-feeding raises rates 14-fold. In the U.S. estimated relative risks is 3.7 for diarrheal mortality. Sudden infant death is about 1/5 less common in U.S. breast fed babies than in bottle fed. There is evidence for better long-term health after breast feeding in disorders such as celiac disease, Crohn disease, ulcerative colitis, insulin-dependent diabetes mellitus, thyroid disease, malignant lymphoma, chronic liver disease, atopic dermatitis, and food allergies. The design of good studies of protection conferred by breast feeding, and the possible modes of action of breast milk are discussed.

   abstract = {Malnutrition is a frequent occurrence in patients with acute inflammatory bowel disease. Total nutritional support provided either parentally (TPN) or enterally (TEN) has been advocated not only as an adjunct for improving nutrition but also as primary therapy. For patients with acute Crohn's disease, short-term rates of remission after TEN are equivalent to TPN. Coupled with certain advantages when compared with TPN, including simpler administration, fewer side effects, and preservation of the intestinal mucosal barrier, TEN may therefore be the preferred route for nutrient delivery. Controlled trials indicate equivalent or superior efficacy when enteral polymeric diets are compared with elemental diets for inducing remission in acute Crohn's disease. Moreover, when provided as an elemental diet, TEN is as effective as corticosteroids for achieving remission in acute Crohn's disease, but corticosteroids appear to be more effective than polymeric diets. Although the provision of nutritional support rather than bowel rest is the major factor contributing to symptomatic improvement, the optimal nutrient composition and the precise mechanisms whereby nutritional support achieves clinical remission remain to be clarified. In contrast to Crohn's disease, nutritional support is not effective for achieving remission in patients with ulcerative colitis. Thus, enteral nutritional support is an effective therapy for the short-term management of acute Crohn's disease. Whether long-term remission is equivalent to treatment with drugs or surgery requires prospective evaluation. Future avenues of investigation also include defining the optimal nutrient composition and the underlying mechanisms that achieve maximal nutritional repletion, promote mucosal cell renewal, and potentially directly retard production of inflammatory mediators.},

Nutritional parameters were evaluated initially and at the time of repeat study in those with abnormal emptying after a period of nutritional rehabilitation. All UC patients and 30 of 45 with CD (67%) had normal emptying of both liquid and solid components of the meal. Fifteen children with CD had delayed emptying of the solid liquid. Fourteen of these had preceding weight loss and one had no weight gain for 3 months prior to the study. Twelve complained of upper gastrointestinal symptoms (nausea, early satiety, postprandial epigastric pain, and anorexia), and five had evidence of growth retardation. The group averaged 4.8 abnormal nutritional parameters, compared with an average of 2.2 in those with CD and normal gastric emptying. Twelve of the 15 with abnormal emptying had abnormal gastric and/or duodenal biopsies: 10 were treated with sulfasalazine and prednisone, whereas five were taking only sulfasalazine. Studies repeated 6-15 months later after establishment of weight gain by caloric supplementation showed significant improvements in gastric emptying, nutritional status, and disease activity for the group, despite persistence of upper gastrointestinal disease documented in eight patients who underwent reexamination.},

   abstract = {The notion that requirements for folic acid may be higher in some tissues than others, resulting in localized deficiencies in spite of blood levels in the normal range was first suggested by the observation of megaloblastic changes in the cervical epithelium that responded to folate supplementation. Theoretically, such deficiencies may arise from elevated folate turnover in response to rapid tissue proliferation or repair; inactivation or alteration of its function by external agents such as tobacco, alcohol, or drugs; or altered metabolism or tissue uptake caused by an inborn error. Marginal dietary intake could aggravate these effects on cells at risk. Evidence for the possible existence of localized folate deficiencies in the aerodigestive tract includes lower circulating folate levels in smokers as compared with nonsmokers; yet lower circulating levels in smokers with bronchial metaplasia; lower folate levels in scrapings of the buccal mucosa of smokers than non-smokers; apparent improvement in bronchial atypical metaplasia in smokers supplemented with folic acid; lower erythrocyte folate levels and higher prevalence of cellular features compatible with folate deficiency in geographic areas and individuals in South Africa at high risk for esophageal cancer; and a trend toward a lower prevalence of colonic dysplasia in ulcerative colitis patients who use folic acid supplements. These observations, as well as animal and in vitro studies, also suggest that folate deficiency may be co-carcinogenic. Further research in this area will be aided by the development of animal models of localized folate deficiency and of methodologies capable of measuring folate levels in minute quantities of tissues and exfoliated cells.},

   abstract = {Chronic undernutrition and high-dose daily corticosteroid therapy are well-accepted causes of growth failure in children with inflammatory bowel disease. Occasionally, children are seen with minimal gastrointestinal symptoms but in whom severe anorexia and profound growth impairment are evident. Recent observations that elevated serum levels of tumor necrosis factor-alpha (TNF) in cachexia associated with a number of disease states have suggested a similar possible role in inflammatory bowel disease. Accordingly, we determined TNF levels in 45 children and adolescents with inflammatory bowel disease (18 ulcerative colitis, 27 Crohn's disease) at varying times during their clinical course and compared them to values obtained from a group of 25 children with functional bowel disease. No differences were noted in serum TNF levels between the children with inflammatory bowel disease and the control population. Values were generally within the range of the lower limit of detection of the assay. In the children with inflammatory bowel disease, there was no significant correlation between TNF levels and disease activity or growth parameters. Our observations suggest that elevated TNF levels are not associated with inflammatory bowel disease in children.},

   abstract = {The aim of this study was to determine serum retinol levels in patients with inflammatory bowel disease and to attempt to elucidate the mechanism of changes in vitamin A metabolism in these disorders. It was found that in 15 patients with active ulcerative colitis, 14 patients with active Crohn's disease and in 3 operated patients with recurrent Crohn's disease serum retinol levels and retinol-binding protein were significantly lower than in controls. Concentrations of vitamin A did not depend on the localization of inflammatory bowel disease, previous ileal resections, duration of the disease or age and sex of the patients. During successful treatment of active ulcerative colitis normalization of serum retinol levels without substitution of vitamin A was observed. Repeated determinations in patients with Crohn's disease who had low serum retinol levels in an active phase of disease revealed normal vitamin A levels in an inactive phase. The absorption of vitamins A and E in patients with inflammatory bowel disease was normal. The normal serum retinol concentrations in patients with diarrhea due to irritable bowel syndrome, and in those with anorexia nervosa exclude the influence of diarrhea and body weight itself on vitamin A levels. The results of this study indicate that serum retinol levels in patients with active inflammatory bowel disease are secondary to the decreased serum retinol-binding protein concentrations, and probably depend on the increased protein catabolism in these disorders.},

Several features of this case distinguish it from previous reports of chronic ipecac ingestion in childhood: the development of grossly bloody stools; radiologic, endoscopic, and biopsy evidence of a chronic moderate colitis resembling ulcerative colitis; and the histologic finding of pseudomelanosis coli, providing an important clue to toxic ingestion. The significance and possible mechanism for genesis of pseudomelanosis coli is discussed. This case emphasizes the variability in presentation and difficulty in diagnosing long-term ipecac ingestion by proxy. Ipecac toxicity should be considered in children with unexplained colitis and vomiting.},

In the two men the protein C deficiency was diagnosed only after the onset of severe thromboembolic complications (cavernous sinus thrombosis; pulmonary embolism) during heparin treatment. But in the woman protein C activity was measured immediately after hospital admission (in the knowledge of the first two cases) even before heparin administration was started. All three patients received treatment with sulphasalazine (3 g daily) and fluocortolone (60 mg daily), as well as full heparinization (22,500-36,000 IU daily). Protein C activity returned to normal on remission of the ulcerative colitis (in one case only after subtotal colectomy).

Fifty-six of the patients (81%) were operated on during the first hospitalization period: 33 patients (48%) underwent an emergency or urgent operation, and 23 (33%) received elective surgical treatment. The mortality rate was 4.3%; three patients died after emergency operations. Excluding the 14 patients who underwent immediate surgery within the first 48 hours, a significant difference could be observed in the response to conservative treatment with and without TPN: with TPN remission was achieved in 34 of 44 cases (77%), without it in only two cases of 11 (18%), P less than 0.001. Proctocolectomy used as an emergency or urgent measure resulted in two deaths, and 93% of the patients showed complications, whereas subtotal colectomy with ileostomy resulted in no deaths and significantly fewer patients (31%) had complications, P less than 0.001. The findings suggest that TPN and bowel rest, in addition to corticosteroid treatment, may be advantageous in all cases of fulminant UC. If this 'Oxford regimen' is insufficient, subtotal colectomy with ileostomy is the safest emergency operation.},

An appreciable rise in TNF alpha was found only in children in relapse of ulcerative colitis and colonic Crohn's disease. The group of children with small bowel Crohn's disease in relapse did not show increases of TNF alpha above control concentrations, despite an equivalent rise in disease indices. Height velocity was depressed in children with relapse of large bowel Crohn's disease and ulcerative colitis compared with the equivalent condition in remission. The impairment of growth velocity was significantly greater in relapse of large bowel Crohn's disease and ulcerative colitis than in small bowel Crohn's disease alone, although for the subgroups in stage 1 puberty (prepubertal) the differences were not significant. Inadequate growth in chronic inflammatory bowel disease is currently ascribed to inadequate nutrition and TNF alpha may contribute to this through its cachexia inducing effects. It may, in addition, diminish pituitary growth hormone release. These results suggest that production of TNF alpha may be associated with growth failure in relapse of colonic inflammatory bowel disease.},

Fever, growth retardation and oral and perianal lesions were more frequent in CD. Articular, mucocutaneous and hepatic were the more usual extraintestinal manifestations. All of them were more frequent in CD. The same comment can be made with respect to the abnormal laboratory test results. Colonoscopy including histological studies was the useful diagnostic method.

A progressive increase in sIL-2R levels was noted to correlate with endoscopic measurement of disease extent, while sIL-2R levels did not correlate with other markers of systemic lymphocyte activation, suggesting possible local mucosal production. Sequential determinations in individual patients revealed a good correlation between sIL-2R and clinical course. More important, elevated levels of sIL-2R preceded clinical relapse of asymptomatic patients. We conclude that sIL-2R measurement may be a useful adjunct to clinical assessment and routine laboratory testing in pediatric and adolescent patients with Crohn's disease and that serial levels may be predictive of clinical course and the response to therapy.},

In the jejunum olsalazine at 1.0 g/l significantly inhibited water, sodium, chloride, and potassium absorption (p less than 0.05). In the ileum olsalazine at 0.5 and 1 g/l significantly inhibited glucose uptake (p less than 0.04) and water absorption (p less than 0.03). In the jejunum sulphasalazine had a dose related and significant inhibitory effect on water, bicarbonate, and sodium absorption and at 2.0 g/l an inhibitory effect on chloride, potassium (p less than 0.005), and glucose (p less than 0.05) absorption. In the ileum sulphasalazine had no significant effect on water and electrolyte absorption. All inhibitory effects were rapidly reversible. These data show that unexplained diarrhoea in patients with ulcerative colitis treated with olsalazine may occur as a consequence of inhibition of water and electrolyte absorption in the small intestine and that the mechanisms of inhibition of sulphasalazine and olsalazine are different.},

Because passive smoking may also have other health consequences, the authors examined the effect of exposure to environmental tobacco smoke during childhood on adult risk of ulcerative colitis in a case-control study of 172 cases drawn in 1986-1987 from the rosters of North Carolina chapters of the Crohn's & Colitis Foundation of America and 131 peer-nominated neighborhood controls. Active smokers were less likely to develop ulcerative colitis than were nonexposed nonsmokers (odds ratio = 0.53, 95% confidence interval 0.24-1.14). The risk was also decreased in passive smokers, i.e., those whose parents had smoked (odds ratio = 0.50, 95% confidence interval 0.25-1.00). Risk estimates were not related to sex, education, age at onset of symptoms, or year of onset of symptoms. Both active smoking in adulthood and passive childhood exposure to environmental tobacco smoke appear to decrease the risk of ulcerative colitis. The results indicate that childhood passive smoke exposures can influence adult susceptibility to ulcerative colitis.},

   abstract = {It is clear that the nutritional state of patients with inflammatory bowel disease is often impaired and can be improved by the provision of nutritional support. Improvement in nutritional status can be achieved as effectively with enteral as with parenteral nutrition. Nutritional support appears to have no primary therapeutic effect in patients with ulcerative colitis. With regard to nutritional support in Crohn's disease, parenteral nutrition should be restricted to use as supportive rather than primary therapy. Available information now seems to suggest that most of the benefits of parenteral nutrition in Crohn's disease are related to an improvement in nutritional state rather than as primary therapy, and its use should be restricted to the treatment of specific complications of Crohn's disease, such as intestinal obstruction related to stricture formation or short bowel syndrome following repeated resection. Although some doubt exists over the efficacy of oligopeptide-containing elemental and polymeric enteral diets, the present evidence indicates that chemically defined free amino acid-containing elemental diets have primary therapeutic efficacy in the management of acute exacerbations of Crohn's disease. As such, these diets are worthy of therapeutic trial in patients with severe Crohn's disease involving the distal colon and rectum, particularly in those patients who are malnourished and who prove to be resistant to treatment with a combination of topical corticosteroids and 5-aminosalicylic acid-containing compounds. Clinicians should be aware, though, that the beneficial effects are likely to be restricted to the short term, with high relapse rates by 1 year, this being particularly so in patients with distal Crohn's proctocolitis (Teahon et al, 1988). Volatile fatty acid enemas clearly have potential in the management of patients with severe steroid-resistant proctitis. Finally, one of the most important observations made in recent years is the one concerning the large losses of nitrogen that will occur in patients with inflammatory bowel disease treated with corticosteroids in the absence of adequate protein intake (O'Keefe et al, 1989). Hopefully the days of treating patients with severe inflammatory bowel disease with high dose corticosteroids and a peripheral dextrose or dextrose-saline drip have passed into history.},

   abstract = {Several sources of information suggest that man evolved on a diet with a ratio of omega 6 to omega 3 fatty acids of approximately 1 whereas today this ratio is approximately 10:1 to 20-25:1, indicating that Western diets are deficient in omega 3 fatty acids compared with the diet on which humans evolved and their genetic patterns were established. Omega-3 fatty acids increase bleeding time; decrease platelet aggregation, blood viscosity, and fibrinogen; and increase erythrocyte deformability, thus decreasing the tendency to thrombus formation. In no clinical trial, including coronary artery graft surgery, has there been any evidence of increased blood loss due to ingestion of omega 3 fatty acids. Many studies show that the effects of omega 3 fatty acids on serum lipids depend on the type of patient and whether the amount of saturated fatty acids in the diet is held constant. In patients with hyperlipidemia, omega 3 fatty acids decrease low-density-lipoprotein (LDL) cholesterol if the saturated fatty acid content is decreased, otherwise there is a slight increase, but at high doses (32 g) they lower LDL cholesterol; furthermore, they consistently lower serum triglycerides in normal subjects and in patients with hypertriglyceridemia whereas the effect on high-density lipoprotein (HDL) varies from no effect to slight increases. The discrepancies between animal and human studies most likely are due to differences between animal and human metabolism. In clinical trials eicosapentaenoic acid (EPA) and docosahexaenoic acid (DHA) in the form of fish oils along with antirheumatic drugs improve joint pain in patients with rheumatoid arthritis; have a beneficial effect in patients with ulcerative colitis; and in combination with drugs, improve the skin lesions, lower the hyperlipidemia from etretinates, and decrease the toxicity of cyclosporin in patients with psoriasis. In various animal models omega 3 fatty acids decrease the number and size of tumors and increase the time elapsed before appearance of tumors. Studies with nonhuman primates and human newborns indicate that DHA is essential for the normal functional development of the retina and brain, particularly in premature infants. Because omega 3 fatty acids are essential in growth and development throughout the life cycle, they should be included in the diets of all humans. Omega-3 and omega 6 fatty acids are not interconvertible in the human body and are important components of practically all cell membranes. Whereas cellular proteins are genetically determined, the polyunsaturated fatty acid (PUFA) composition of cell membranes is to a great extent dependent on the dietary intake.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 400 WORDS)},

In this review, the use of enteral and parenteral nutrition support as primary therapy for active Crohn's disease and ulcerative colitis is discussed. Other roles for nutrition support in patients with inflammatory bowel disease, including preoperative nutrition support, nutritional treatment of intestinal fistulas and growth retardation, and home parenteral nutrition for gut failure, are also reviewed.},

The sensitivity of indium-111 scan was 18%, specificity was 62.5%, and accuracy for diagnosing colonic disease was only 37%. In comparison, sensitivity and specificity for colonoscopy were 100 and 57%, respectively. Furthermore, accuracy with colonoscopy was 84%.
