   abstract = {OBJECTIVE: The objective of this evidence-based analysis was to evaluate the clinical utility of serologic testing for celiac disease in asymptomatic individuals presenting with one of the non-gastrointestinal conditions evaluated in this report. The clinical utility was based on the effects of a gluten-free diet (GFD) on outcomes specific to each of these conditions. The prevalence of celiac disease in asymptomatic individuals and one of these non-gastrointestinal conditions was also evaluated. CLINICAL NEED AND TARGET POPULATION: CELIAC DISEASE: Celiac disease is an autoimmune disease characterized by a chronic inflammatory state of the proximal small bowel mucosa accompanied by structural and functional changes. TECHNOLOGY UNDER EVALUATION: SEROLOGIC TESTS FOR CELIAC DISEASE: There are a number of serologic tests for celiac disease available. Serologic tests are automated with the exception of the anti-endomysial antibody test, which is more time-consuming and operator-dependent than the other tests. RESEARCH QUESTIONS: What is the prevalence of asymptomatic celiac disease in patients presenting with one of the non-gastrointestinal conditions evaluated?What is the effect of the gluten-free diet on condition-specific outcomes in patients with asymptomatic celiac disease presenting with one of the non-gastrointestinal conditions evaluated?What is the clinical utility of serologic testing for celiac disease in asymptomatic patients presenting with one of the non-gastrointestinal conditions evaluated? The clinical utility was defined as the impact of the GFD on disease specific outcomes.What is the risk of all-cause mortality and lymphoma in individuals with asymptomatic celiac disease?What is the budget impact of serologic testing for celiac disease in asymptomatic subjects presenting with one of the non-gastrointestinal conditions evaluated? RESEARCH METHODS: STUDY POPULATION: The study population consisted of individuals with newly diagnosed celiac disease without any symptoms consistent with the disease presenting with one of the non-gastrointestinal conditions evaluated. When evaluating the risk of lymphoma and all-cause mortality, the study population consisted of asymptomatic individuals with a positive celiac disease serologic test and/or small bowel biopsy. LITERATURE SEARCH: SEARCH STRATEGY: Literature searches were performed for each disease/condition evaluated between December 2010 and March 2011 using OVID MEDLINE, the Cochrane Library, and the International Agency for Health Technology Assessment (INAHTA). No restrictions for start date of search were used. Abstracts were reviewed by a single reviewer and, for those studies meeting the eligibility criteria, full-text articles were obtained. Reference lists were also examined for any additional relevant studies not identified through the search. Articles with an unknown eligibility were reviewed with a second clinical epidemiologist and then a group of epidemiologists until consensus was established. INCLUSION CRITERIA: Studies, systematic reviews, and meta-analyses that assessed the effects of a GFD in patients with newly diagnosed asymptomatic celiac disease presenting with one of the non-gastrointestinal conditions evaluated. If symptoms were not reported in the study but subjects were identified through screening for celiac disease the study was included.Studies, systematic reviews, and meta-analyses that assessed the prevalence of newly diagnosed asymptomatic celiac disease in patients with one of the non-gastrointestinal conditions evaluated. If symptoms were not reported in the study but subjects were identified through screening for celiac disease the study was included.Studies, systematic reviews, and meta-analyses that evaluated the risk of all-cause mortality or lymphoma in individuals with asymptomatic celiac disease.Sample size >/= 10.Publications in English. EXCLUSION CRITERIA: Studies that retrospectively assessed the prevalence of asymptomatic celiac disease.Studies that reported the prevalence of one of the non-gastrointestinal conditions evaluated in subjects already diagnosed with celiac disease.Studies in individuals with one of the non-gastrointestinal conditions evaluated if the condition could be explained by other causes.Studies in subjects with celiac disease and symptoms consistent with the disease. If the study included individuals with and without symptoms consistent with celiac disease and their results were analysed separately, the results in individuals without symptoms were included in the analysis.Studies in which individuals did not report any symptoms consistent with celiac disease at study start but that either retrospectively reported the presence of such symptoms after following a GFD, or that previously presented with symptoms consistent with celiac disease.Study results published in letters to the editor or comments about other studies.Studies with a sample size >/= 10, however, in which less than 10 patients were included in the analysis. OUTCOMES OF INTEREST: The effects of a GFD on disease-specific outcomes for each condition evaluated in patients with asymptomatic celiac disease was assessed. The prevalence of asymptomatic celiac disease in patients presenting with one of the conditions evaluated was also assessed. RESULTS OF EVIDENCE-BASED ANALYSIS: Three eligible observational studies evaluated the effects of GFD on growth parameters in subjects with asymptomatic celiac disease and idiopathic short stature. Four eligible observational studies evaluated the effects of GFD on metabolic control in subjects with asymptomatic celiac disease and type 1 diabetes. Five eligible observational studies evaluated the risk of all-cause mortality and five eligible observational studies evaluated the risk of lymphoma in subjects with asymptomatic celiac disease. No eligible studies on the effects of the GFD for the other conditions evaluated were identified. Twenty-three eligible studies measured the prevalence of asymptomatic celiac disease in subjects presenting with one of the conditions evaluated. PREVALENCE OF CELIAC DISEASE IN ASYMPTOMATIC PATIENTS: The prevalence of celiac disease in asymptomatic patients presenting with one of the conditions evaluated was analysed. Most studies also included a control group that generally consisted of individuals randomly selected from the general population. Although there was a trend to a higher prevalence of asymptomatic celiac disease in individuals with the conditions evaluated compared to the controls, it only reached statistical significance in type 1 diabetes. No eligible prevalence studies were identified in patients with amenorrhea, delayed puberty, alopecia, and depression. THE EFFECTS OF A GLUTEN-FREE DIET ON DISEASE-SPECIFIC OUTCOMES IN PATIENTS WITH ASYMPTOMATIC CELIAC DISEASE: THE EFFECTS OF GFD ON METABOLIC CONTROL IN PATIENTS WITH ASYMPTOMATIC CELIAC DISEASE AND TYPE 1 DIABETES: The effects of a GFD on metabolic control (HbA1c, number of hypoglycemic episodes, and changes in insulin dosage) in subjects with asymptomatic celiac disease and type 1 diabetes were evaluated. One prospective case-control study reported an increase in HbA1c levels in cases with type 1 diabetes and asymptomatic celiac disease after the introduction of a GFD, however, the clinical significance of this change is unclear. Only one eligible retrospective case-control study evaluated the effects of a GFD on hypoglycemia episodes and since there were inadequate details in the study about both the ascertainment and severity of hypoglycemia episodes in both cases and controls, it is not possible to draw conclusions regarding the effects of a GFD on hypoglycemia episodes based on this study. One prospective case-control study did not show a statistically significant change in insulin dosage between cases with type 1 diabetes and asymptomatic celiac disease and controls with type 1 diabetes either before or after the introduction of a GFD. No eligible studies that evaluated the effects of a GFD on the long-term outcomes of type 1 diabetes such as cardiovascular or renal events in patients with asymptomatic celiac disease were identified. THE EFFECTS OF A GLUTEN-FREE DIET IN PATIENTS WITH IDIOPATHIC SHORT STATURE AND ASYMPTOMATIC CELIAC DISEASE: A total of 3 eligible studies were identified. All studies consisted of case series that compared growth parameters in subjects with asymptomatic celiac disease and idiopathic short stature before and after the celiac disease was diagnosed and the GFD was instituted. Most subjects included in the studies demonstrated an improvement in growth parameters. Compliance with the GFD was not reported in the studies. The results of the studies suggest an increase in growth velocity in pediatric patients with asymptomatic celiac disease and idiopathic short stature once a GFD is introduced. RISK OF LYMPHOMA IN PATIENTS WITH ASYMPTOMATIC CELIAC DISEASE: One retrospective cohort study evaluated the risk of lymphoma in patients with asymptomatic celiac disease. The authors concluded that the number of events identified was low during the long follow-up period and that the risk of overall malignancies was not increased among patients with asymptomatic celiac disease. RISK OF ASYMPTOMATIC CELIAC DISEASE IN PATIENTS WITH LYMPHOMA: Four case-control studies, one of which retrospective, evaluated the risk of asymptomatic celiac disease in patients newly diagnosed with lymphoma. One retrospective cohort study did not show an increase in the risk of lymphoma among subjects with asymptomatic celiac disease. Three prospective case-control studies did not find a statistically significant risk of asymptomatic celiac disease in patients with newly diagnosed lymphoma. (ABSTRACT TRUNCATED)},

Transglutaminase-specific IgA deposits in mucosal tissue provide the most accurate method of detecting early coeliac disease without villous atrophy. In refractory coeliac disease, the response to diet is lacking. Refractory disease is classified into types I and II. In type II, epithelial T-cells are negative for CD4/CD8 and there is monoclonal T-cell gamma-gene rearrangement, with an increased risk of lymphoma. The EU states that a 'gluten-free diet' should contain less than 20 mg, and a 'very low gluten diet' less than 100 mg, of gluten per kilogram.},

RESULTS: Elevated levels of IGA-tTG deposits were found in 98% patients with GSCD. This elevation in the controls occurred in patients with autoimmune pathology and in patients with such levels of the serum markers which were in the range of reference limits in the absence of GSCD morphometric characteristics in biopsy specimen but with verified diagnosis celiac disease. CONCLUSION: This method showed high diagnostic efficacy in detection of subepithelial IGA-tTG deposits for diagnosis of GSCD and monitoring of pathogenetic diet therapy.},

   abstract = {AIM: To characterize cell adhesion molecules (CAM), components of intercellular matrix (ICM) in gluten-sensitive celiac disease (GSCD). MATERIAL AND METHODS: A histological examination was made of biopsies of small intestinal mucosa (SIM) obtained from 890 patients with clinical and laboratory symptoms of GSCD. Of them, 124 (14%) patients had signs of chronic atrophic duodenitis of different severity corresponding to GSCD. Newly diagnosed GSCD was in 63 (7.1%) patients, 61 (6.9%) patients kept a glutenic diet. Biopsy specimens from unaffected mucosa of distal parts of the duodenum from 10 patients served control. Immunohistochemical examination of CAM and ICM was made using antibodies to E-cadgerin, beta-catenin, CD44, type IV collagen, matrix metalloproteinase of type 9 (MMP-9). RESULTS: Interrupted weak reaction in epithelial basal membrane and enhanced expression of this antigen in stroma were observed in SIM in GSCD of stage IIIC by Marsh. Subnormal irregular expression of E-cadgerin and beta-catenin were seen in membrane of surface epithelium and cryptal epithelium. Moreover; high CD44 expression was detected in membrane of SIM stroma cells and high expression of MMP-9 in the cytoplasm of stromal cells and intercellular matrix. CONCLUSION: The detected disorders of intercellular and cellular-matrix interaction in GSCD promote tissue lesion, increased permeability of epithelial barrier and changes in histogenesis processes. Further study of minimal disorders in SIM in GSCD on the molecular level will facilitate diagnosis of early stages of the disease and prognosis of its course.},

   abstract = {AIM: To determine prevalence of gluten-sensitive celiac disease (GSCD) in women with reproductive dysfunction (RD). MATERIAL AND METHODS: Tests for blood serum antibodies to tissue transglutaminase (ABtTG) of IgA class were made in 217 women with RD. Tests for antibodies to gliadin (ABG) were performed in 180 of them. Esophagogastroduodenoscopy (EGDS) with biopsy to verify GSCD was conducted in patients with elevated ABtTG. The control group consisted of 15 healthy females of a reproductive age. RESULTS: The examinees exhibited IgA ABtTG in the range 1 to 280 IU/ml, while 16 of them had elevated level - 50.2 +/- 194 IU/ml, on the average. The controls had 0-10 IU/ml level of ABtTG, mean level 4.3 +/- 1.5 IU/ml. EGDS with duodenobiopsy was performed in 14 women. The examination of biopsies from small intestinal mucosa has detected pathohistological signs of celiac disease in 7 of 14 women. At the moment of the study, two women with a history of spontaneous abortion were pregnant. Their ABtTG was 21.7 and 15.9 IU/mg, respectively EGDS was not performed because of potential pregnancy complication but in view of possible celiac disease they received recommendations on aglutenic diet. CONCLUSION: Incidence rate of GSCD in women with RD is 4,1%. Aglutenic diet in GSCD women with RD contributes to reproductive function recovery and normal outcome of pregnancy. Elevation of ABtTG titers in women with RD is an indication to histological examination of small intestinal mucosa to detect GSCD.},

   abstract = {Celiac disease is a T cell-mediated immune disorder induced by dietary gluten that is characterized by the development of an inflammatory anti-gluten CD4 T cell response, anti-gluten antibodies, and autoantibodies against tissue transglutaminase 2 and the activation of intraepithelial lymphocytes (IELs) leading to the destruction of the intestinal epithelium. Intraepithelial lymphocytes represent a heterogeneous population of T cells composed mainly of cytotoxic CD8 T cells residing within the epithelial layer, whose main role is to maintain the integrity of the epithelium by eliminating infected cells and promoting epithelial repair. Dysregulated activation of IELs is a hallmark of CD and is critically involved in epithelial cell destruction and the subsequent development of villous atrophy. In this review, we compare and contrast the phenotype and function of human and mouse small intestinal IELs under physiological conditions. Furthermore, we discuss how conditions of epithelial distress associated with overexpression of IL-15 and non-classical MHC class I molecules induce cytotoxic IELs to become licensed killer cells that upregulate activating NKG2D and CD94/NKG2C natural killer receptors, acquiring lymphokine killer activity. Pathways leading to dysregulated IEL activation could eventually be targeted to prevent villous atrophy and treat patients who respond poorly to gluten-free diet.},

Celiac disease (CD) is a permanent immunological intolerance to gluten proteins in genetically predisposed individuals. CD has been reported in 4-13 % of the cases with steatohepatitis, although the pathogenesis of the liver steatosis in CD patients is unclear. Based on the literature data, it can be concluded that the inclusion of serological markers of CD should be a part of the general workup in the patients with steatosis when other causes of the liver disease are excluded and in the patients with NAFLD when metabolic risk factors are not evident.},

   abstract = {BACKGROUND: Following the recommendations of The International Society for Pediatric and Adolescent Diabetes (ISPAD) in 2000, our clinic started routine screening of children with type 1 diabetes (T1D) for coeliac disease (CD). OBJECTIVES: To determine the short-term clinical and metabolic effects of gluten free diet (GFD) in a group of children with T1D and confirmed CD. METHODS: Data were collected on all children with T1D and CD between November 2000 and November 2007 before and 12 months after commencement of GFD. Data included the presence of gastrointestinal (GI) symptoms, episodes of severe hypoglycaemia, daily insulin requirements, height, weight, body mass index (BMI), glycosylated haemoglobin (HbA1c), haemoglobin, and persistence of autoantibodies. The effects of GFD on these parameters were studied and compared with those from the revised ISPAD Guidelines in 2007. RESULTS: Four hundred and sixty-eight children with T1D were screened, of whom 23 patients were diagnosed with CD. The mean age at diagnosis of T1D and CD was 6.8 years and 11.1 years, respectively. Ten out of 11 children showed improvement in their GI symptoms, while 6 out of 8 patients had no further severe hypoglycaemic episodes. Nine patients remained positive for antiendomysial antibodies after GFD. There was no significant change in the standard deviation score for height, weight, and BMI or the mean HbA1c and Hb before and after GFD. However the mean insulin requirement increased from 0.88 to 1.1 units/kg/day, which was statistically significant (p < 0.005). CONCLUSION: In our experience, GFD showed short-term benefits by reducing GI symptoms and severe hypoglycaemia while the insulin requirement increased significantly.},

   abstract = {BACKGROUND: Celiac disease and eosinophilic esophagitis are usually considered to be separate gastrointestinal diseases; however, it appears that they may coexist more often than would be expected. It is unknown whether eosinophilic esophagitis in patients with celiac disease responds to a gluten-free diet. OBJECTIVES: To examine the clinical, endoscopic and histological features of children with both conditions to evaluate whether eosinophilic esophagitis responds to a gluten-free diet. METHODS: From January 1, 2009, to June 30, 2011, the medical records of children <18 years of age diagnosed with eosinophilic esophagitis andor celiac disease were reviewed. Patients with clinical, endoscopic and histological diagnoses of both diseases were identified and included. These findings were analyzed, as were laboratory results, treatment and follow-up. RESULTS: During the study period, there were 206 celiac disease patients, 86 eosinophilic esophagitis patients and nine (4.4% of total celiac) patients with both diagnoses. Gluten-free diet was the primary treatment for both conditions in seven of nine (78%) cases. In six of these seven (86%) patients, no endoscopic or histological improvement of eosinophilic esophagitis was observed, while in one patient, histological remission of esophageal eosinophilia occurred while on a gluten-free diet. CONCLUSION: The prevalence of eosinophilic esophagitis in patients with celiac disease was 4.4%, confirming a higher than expected prevalence of eosinophilic esophagitis compared with the general population. In patients with celiac disease, a gluten-free diet did not appear to induce remission of coexistent endoscopic and histological features of eosinophilic esophagitis.},

   abstract = {Inappropriate food labeling and unwillingness of food companies to officially register their own gluten-free products in the Greek National Food Intolerance Database (NFID) result in a limited range of processed food products available for persons with celiac disease (CDP). The objective of the study was to evaluate the feasibility of developing a gluten-free food product database based on the assessment of the gluten content in processed foods available for CDP. Gluten was assessed in 41 processed food products available for CDP. Group A consisted of 26 products for CDP included in the NFID, and group B contained 15 food products for CDP not registered in the NFID but listed in the safe lists of the local Celiac Association (CA). High-sensitivity omega-gliadin enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay (ELISA) was used for analysis. Gluten was lower than 20 ppm in 37 of 41 analyzed products (90.2%): in 24 of 26 (92.3%) products in group A and in 13 of 15 (86.7%) products in group B (P = .61). No significant difference was found between the 2 groups regarding gluten content. No product in either group contained gluten in excess of 100 ppm. Most of the analyzed products included in the Greek NFID or listed in the lists of the local CA, even those not officially labeled "gluten free," can be safely consumed by CDP. The use of commercially available omega-gliadin ELISA is able to identify those products that contain inappropriate levels of gluten, making feasible it to develop an integrated gluten-free processed food database.},

   abstract = {OBJECTIVES: The clinical presentations of celiac crisis and refeeding syndrome in celiac disease are almost similar, but information about refeeding syndrome is scarce. We are reporting for the first time 5 cases of refeeding syndrome in children with celiac disease that could have otherwise been labeled as celiac crisis. METHODS: From January to December 2010, a chart review of hospital records of all celiac disease cases was performed, and refeeding syndrome was ascribed in those celiac patients who deteriorated clinically after initiation of a gluten-free diet and had biochemical parameters suggestive of refeeding syndrome such as hypophosphatemia, hypokalemia, hypocalcemia, and hypoalbuminemia. RESULTS: Of the total 35 celiac disease patients, 5 (median age 6.5 [range 2.2-10] years, 3 boys) were identified as having refeeding syndrome. All 5 children were severely malnourished (body mass index <14 kg/m) and all of them had anemia, hypophosphatemia, hypokalemia, hypoalbuminemia, and hypocalcemia, meaning that they had the perfect setting for developing refeeding syndrome. At the same time, their clinical features fulfilled the criteria for celiac crisis except that their symptoms have worsened after the introduction of a gluten-free diet. Nevertheless, instead of using steroids, they were managed as refeeding syndrome in terms of correction of electrolytes and gradual feeding, and that led to a successful outcome in all of them. CONCLUSIONS: Severely malnourished patients with celiac disease are at risk of developing potentially life-threatening refeeding syndrome, which may mimic celiac crisis, especially in developing countries. Early recognition and appropriate treatment are the keys to a successful outcome.},

   abstract = {BACKGROUND AND AIM: Celiac disease is characterized by sensitivity to gluten that results in inflammation and atrophy of the small intestine mucosa. The aim of this research was to document the presence of celiac disease and to describe its clinical presentations in the tribes living in the Red Sea state of Sudan. METHODS: 172 patients suspected to have celiac disease, were examined at the Red Sea Medical Center laboratory, Port Sudan, Sudan, from August 2008 to September 2011. All clinical data was collected using questionnaires. Serum samples were obtained from all patients for serological detection of anti-gliadin (AG) and anti-tissue transglutamase (ATTG) antibodies (IgG and IgA) using the enzyme-linked immuno-sorbent assay (ELISA). RESULTS: 128 patients were found to have celiac disease. The commonest presenting symptom was chronic diarrhea (20.3%) followed by weight loss (14%). Males and females were nearly equally affected. All age groups were affected with a peak incidence between 5 to 10 years. CONCLUSIONS: Celiac disease occurs in the Red Sea state and may well be under-diagnosed. The combination of IgA AGA and IgA ATTG tests represent a good diagnostic method to confirm celiac disease in suspected cases. Special attention needs to be given to methods that encourage adherence to gluten-free diet in affected people in this region.},

Screening of asymptomatic individuals in the general population is not currently recommended; instead, a strategy of case finding is the preferred approach, taking into account the myriad modes of presentation of celiac disease. Although a gluten-free diet is the treatment of choice in symptomatic patients with celiac disease, there is no consensus on whether institution of a gluten-free diet will improve the quality of life in asymptomatic screen-detected celiac disease patients. A review of the studies that have been performed on this subject is presented. Certain patient groups such as those with autoimmune diseases may be offered screening in the context of an informed discussion regarding the potential benefits, with the caveat that the data on this issue are sparse. Active case finding seems to be the most prudent option in most clinical situations.},

   abstract = {Celiac disease is a common autoimmune disease caused by sensitivity to the dietary protein gluten. Forty loci have been implicated in the disease. All disease loci have been characterized as low-penetrance, with the exception of the high-risk genotypes in the HLA-DQA1 and HLA-DQB1 genes, which are necessary but not sufficient to cause the disease. The very strong effects from the known HLA loci and the genetically complex nature of the major histocompatibility complex (MHC) have precluded a thorough investigation of the region. The purpose of this study was to test the hypothesis that additional celiac disease loci exist within the extended MHC (xMHC). A set of 1898 SNPs was analyzed for association across the 7.6 Mb xMHC region in 1668 confirmed celiac disease cases and 517 unaffected controls. Conditional recursive partitioning was used to create an informative indicator of the known HLA-DQA1 and HLA-DQB1 high-risk genotypes that was included in the association analysis to account for their effects. A linkage disequilibrium-based grouping procedure was utilized to estimate the number of independent celiac disease loci present in the xMHC after accounting for the known effects. There was significant statistical evidence for four new independent celiac disease loci within the classic MHC region. This study is the first comprehensive association analysis of the xMHC in celiac disease that specifically accounts for the known HLA disease genotypes and the genetic complexity of the region.},

Therefore, the purpose of this study was to evaluate organ-specific autoantibodies and autoimmune diseases in JSLE and JDM patients. METHODS: Forty-one JSLE and 41 JDM patients were investigated for autoantibodies associated with autoimmune hepatitis, primary biliary cirrhosis, type 1 diabetes mellitus (T1DM), autoimmune thyroiditis (AT), autoimmune gastritis and coeliac disease (CD). Patients with positive antibodies were investigated for the respective organ-specific autoimmune diseases. RESULTS: Mean age at diagnosis was higher in JSLE compared to JDM patients (10.3+/-3.4 vs. 7.3+/-3.1years, p=0.0001). The frequencies of organ-specific autoantibodies were similar in JSLE and JDM patients (p>0.05). Of note, a high prevalence of T1DM and AT autoantibodies was observed in both groups (20% vs. 15%, p=0.77 and 24% vs. 15%, p=0.41; respectively). Higher frequencies of ANA (93% vs. 59%, p=0.0006), anti-dsDNA (61% vs. 2%, p<0.0001), anti-Ro, anti-Sm, anti-RNP, anti-La and IgG-aCL were observed in JSLE (p<0.05). Organ-specific autoimmune diseases were evidenced only in JSLE patients (24% vs. 0%, p=0.13). Two JSLE patients had T1DM associated with Hashimoto thyroiditis and another had subclinical thyroiditis. Another JSLE patient had CD diagnosis based on iron deficiency anaemia, anti-endomysial antibody, duodenal biopsy compatible to CD and response to a gluten-free diet. CONCLUSIONS: Organ-specific diseases were observed solely in JSLE patients and required specific therapy. The presence of these antibodies recommends the evaluation of organ-specific diseases and a rigorous follow-up.},

   abstract = {OBJECTIVES: Positivity of both immunoglobulin A anti-tissue transglutaminase (TTG) and anti-endomysium antibodies (EMA) has a positive predictive value of nearly 100% for celiac disease (CD). The objective of the present study was to evaluate whether patients of any age, with high pretest probability of CD and high titre of anti-TTG and EMA positivity, have a high probability of intestinal damage and may not require the biopsy for final diagnosis. METHODS: A retrospective analysis of 412 consecutively referred patients, age range 10 months to 72 years, who underwent small-bowel biopsy for suspicion of CD and positivity to both anti-TTG and EMA, was performed at 4 Italian centers. Biopsies were evaluated independently by 2 pathologists using Marsh modified classification; in cases of dissimilar results, a third pathologist examined the biopsy. The final histological finding diagnosis was expressed as the prevalent or highest score assigned by the pathologist board. RESULTS: Three hundred ninety-six patients (96.1%) had histological findings consistent with CD (grade 2 and 3a, 3b, or 3c of modified Marsh classification). An anti-TTG ratio >/= 7 was able to identify with the 3 assays used (Celikey, anti-TTG immunoglobulin A, EuTTG) all of the patients with significant mucosal damage (Marsh >/= 2) independent of age and sex; specificity and positive predictive value were 100%. An anti-TTG ratio >20 was more specific (99.8%) for identification of patients with villous atrophy (Marsh 3 a, b, or c). CONCLUSIONS: Patients with positivity of anti-TTG >/= 7-fold cutoff, confirmed by positivity to EMA, have a high-degree probability of duodenal damage. In selected conditions, a duodenal biopsy may be avoided and a confirmed greatly positive anti-TTG result could be the basis to prescribe a gluten-free diet.},

   abstract = {Eosinophilic esophagitis (EE) is a recently recognized form of pan-esophagitis, which is characterized by the presence of at least 15 eosinophils per high power field on esophageal histology. EE is closely associated with atopic disorders and occurs predominantly in male patients. Young children are more likely to be sensitized to food allergens whilst aeroallergen sensitization predominates in older children and adults--a pattern reminiscent of the "atopic march". EE presents with a diverse range of gastrointestinal symptoms, including regurgitation, vomiting, feeding difficulties or refusal in infancy, in addition to dysphagia and food bolus impaction in older children and adults. The diagnosis may also be ascertained incidentally in patients undergoing gastroscopy for other suspected gastrointestinal conditions, such as gastroesophageal reflux disease or celiac disease. Complications mainly relate to subepithelial remodeling and fibrosis which may result in dysmotility, dysphagia and esophageal strictures. The proportion of EE patients at risk of these complications is unknown due to a paucity of data on the natural history of EE. There are only few randomized controlled trials assessing the efficacy of treatment modalities for EE, which currently either involve food allergen elimination or use of swallowed aerosolized corticosteroids. This article aims to discuss the complex issues of the diagnosis and long-term management that confront clinicians who care for children with EE.},

AIM: Determine the prevalence of celiac disease in Sub-Saharan African-derived Brazilian communities using serological screening. SUBJECTS AND METHODS: Inhabitants from 10 African-derived communities from Northeastern of Brazil were screened for celiac disease. All sera were tested for endomysial class IgA antibody using indirect immunofluorescence. RESULTS: No positive test for IgA-endomysial was observed in the 860 individuals tested. CONCLUSION: Our data suggests a low prevalence of celiac disease in African-derived Brazilian populations.},

   abstract = {UNLABELLED: Coeliac disease is an important clinical disorder affecting the human gastrointestinal tract leading to multiple signs and symptoms in different body organs. This disease was the subject of a cross sectional descriptive-analytic study conducted in the Gaza Strip during 2010. Objectives were oriented to identify and verify several variables and attributes affecting the prognosis of coeliac disease in the patients. Ninety five children out of 113 patients were arranged into two groups according to age from 2 to 11 years and from 12 to 18 years old. Results showed the poor interest of health professionals regarding coeliac disease in the Gaza Strip. The mean age of study population was 5.47 years for males and 8.93 years for females. The lifestyle of coeliac patients was directly proportional with better nutritional indictors. Poor recognition of the emblem illustrating gluten in foods implicates effective health awareness or promotion. The more knowledgeable patients or mothers (P = 0.036) were the more compliant. The compliance to giving gluten free foods outside home was statistically significant (P = 0.037). Similarly, cautious approach when buying foods or detergents (P = 0.011). According to BMI 74.4%, 23.4% and 3.2% of all patients were normal, underweight and overweight respectively. Albumin blood level was normal in 32.6% and low in 67.4%. Meanwhile, blood calcium level was normal in 76.8%, low in 21.1% and high in 2.1% of all patients. CONCLUSION: The study showed that recreation and social activities for coeliac patients are substantially missing in the Gaza Strip. Moreover, the study proved that AEI is a reliable centre for care of coeliac disease patients and conducting relevant studies. RECOMMENDATION: There is a need for thorough and continuous community and institutional mobilization regarding coeliac disease in the Gaza Strip and in Palestine.},

   abstract = {Coeliac disease is a gluten-sensitive enteropathy of varying severity. Osteomalacia and hypocalcaemia can result from malabsorption of vitamin D and calcium, which, in turn, can lead to secondary hyperparathyroidism. If coeliac disease remains untreated for long, tertiary hyperparathyroidism can also develop through autonomy of the parathyroid glands via chronic stimulation. Primary hyperparathyroidism also has been reported in some cases of coeliac disease. We report the case of an adolescent with coeliac disease presenting with severe hypercalcaemia from a parathyroid adenoma. A 14 year-old girl was admitted to our department for delayed puberty and growth retardation. Laboratory examination revealed iron deficiency anaemia, low 25OH vitamin D level (7 ng/ml), high parathyroid hormone level (PTH) (955 pg/ml), and hypercalcaemia (13.4 mg/dl). Endoscopic biopsy was compatible with gluten enteropathy. Endomysium antibody was positive. A gluten-free diet was started. Her calcium returned to normal after excision of the parathyroid adenoma. After four months of the gluten-free diet, she began to mature, and puberty began with development of breasts and axillary-pubic hair growth. It has been suggested that autonomous four-gland hyperplasia or tertiary hyperparathyroidism may progress to adenoma formation, and that this should be termed "quaternary hyperparathyroidism". More studies are required to explain the relationship between coeliac disease and hyperparathyroidism.},

Adherence and obedience to a gluten-free diet requires self-determination on the part of the person with Coeliac disease, as well as their family members. The objective of this research is to identify the main difficulties noted by people with Coeliac disease in their eating habits, the frequency of consumption and their satisfaction with gluten-free products. We employed an adapted already validated questionnaire, with open, closed, and multiple choice questions. Of the 105 participants with Coeliac disease, 90.38% of them followed, where possible, a gluten-free diet; 67.12% consumed food with gluten inadvertently or because of a lack of alternatives and/or information in food found in public places. Seventy percent affirmed that their diet provided all the energy and nutrients they need; 77.67% of the Coeliac participants prepared their meals by themselves or this task was assumed by their caregivers; 77.14% read the manufacturers labels on products, and, 74.49% expressed dissatisfaction regarding the price and availability of gluten-free products. The data show an association only between the energy and nutrients needed for good health and gluten-free dietary tracking (p=0.0315). That is, people with Coeliac disease who avoided gluten consumed more calories and were more likely to have adequate nutrients in their diet.},

   abstract = {Celiac disease (CD) is an immune-mediated disease, triggered in genetically susceptible individuals by ingesting gluten from wheat, rye, barley, and other closely related cereal grains. Currently, the estimated prevalence of CD is around 1 % of the population in the western world and medical nutritional therapy (MNT) is the only accepted treatment for celiac disease. To date, the replacement of gluten in bread presents a significant technological challenge for the cereal scientist due to the low baking performance of gluten free products (GF). The increasing demand by the consumer for high quality gluten-free (GF) bread, clean labels and natural products is rising. Sourdough has been used since ancient times for the production of rye and wheat bread, its universal usage can be attributed to the improved quality, nutritional properties and shelf life of sourdough based breads. Consequently, the exploitation of sourdough for the production of GF breads appears tempting. This review will highlight how sourdough LAB can be an efficient cell factory for delivering functional biomolecules and food ingredients to enhance the quality of gluten free bread.},

   abstract = {OBJECTIVE: Although the physical consequences of Celiac Disease are well studied, less is known about co-occurring psychiatric symptoms. This study examines psychiatric risk and comorbidities of women with Celiac Disease, who may be at increased risk for psychiatric symptoms (e.g. depression, and disordered eating behaviours). METHODS: Women (N = 177) with Celiac Disease responded to an extensive web-mediated survey assessing dietary compliance, illness symptoms, psychiatric functioning, and disordered eating. RESULTS: Despite high reported dietary compliance, patients reported marked illness symptoms and impaired quality of life. A substantial minority endorsed symptoms that met criteria for the diagnosis of psychiatric disorders: 37% (n = 65) met the threshold suggesting depression, and 22% (n = 39) for disordered eating. Participants whose symptoms exceeded these clinical thresholds reported greater perceived stress and reduced overall mental health, relative to women below the clinical cutoffs. CONCLUSIONS: Despite largely adhering to a gluten-free diet, a substantial subset of women with Celiac Disease report clinically relevant symptoms of depression and disordered eating; such symptoms are associated with increased psychosocial distress in other domains. These results suggest potential to improve the patient well-being through attention to psychosocial care, in addition to existing dietary recommendations for individuals with Celiac Disease.},

It is well known that immunoglobulin A tissue transglutaminase levels correlate with the degree of intestinal damage, and that values can fluctuate in patients over time. Serological testing can be used to identify symptomatic individuals that need a confirmatory biopsy, to screen at-risk populations or to monitor diet compliance in patients previously diagnosed with celiac disease. Thus, interpretation of serological testing requires consideration of the full clinical scenario. Antigliadin tests are no longer recommended for the diagnosis of classical celiac disease. However, our understanding of the pathogenesis and spectrum of gluten sensitivity has improved, and gluten-sensitive irritable bowel syndrome patients are increasingly being recognized. Studies are needed to determine the clinical utility of antigliadin serology in the diagnosis of gluten sensitivity.},

   abstract = {PURPOSE OF REVIEW: This article critically summarizes the recent scientific and clinical advances in coeliac disease. RECENT FINDINGS: Epidemiological studies have shown that coeliac disease is as common in parts of Asia, Africa and Eastern Europe as in the western world. Genome-wide association studies continue to identify genetic susceptibilities that are both unique to coeliac disease and overlap with other autoimmune diseases. Human leukocyte antigen genotyping offers additional sensitivity in detecting coeliac disease in individuals who have self-prescribed gluten-free diets (GFD) or have atypical presentations. Immunological advances have highlighted the potential proinflammatory pitfalls of vitamin A supplementation in active coeliac disease and have enabled identification of oat and barley subsets that may be safely incorporated into coeliac diets. Large population-based studies have expanded our knowledge of the long-term risks of coeliac disease, in addition to excluding infertility as a cause for concern once a GFD has been established. SUMMARY: The long-term implications of active coeliac disease emphasize the need for early detection and strict adherence to GFD, which remains the cornerstone of management. Technological advances in food modulation and immuno-therapies offer promise, but remain in the translational phases of clinical trials at present.},

The only treatment for celiac disease is lifelong adherence to a gluten-free diet to prevent future complications and malignancies. The ratio of occurrence between children and adolescents is 1:104. When the phase of adolescence is coalesced with having celiac disease, normal developmental tasks become more challenging, therefore impacting adherence with the gluten-free diet. An abundance of both qualitative and quantitative studies from the Netherlands, Europe, and Canada focusing on adolescents with celiac disease and adherence to the gluten-free diet was found in the literature. Conversely, in the United States, there was a dearth of literature examining adolescents diagnosed with celiac disease, their adherence to a gluten-free diet, and their lived experience of having celiac disease. The relevance to nursing practice and recommendations for future research are discussed in light of these findings.},

Intestinal dendritic cells (DCs) have a central role in the development of immunosuppressive regulatory T cells owing to their ability to produce TGF-beta and retinoic acid (RA). However, the article under evaluation shows an unexpected effect of RA - that of promoting a proinflammatory phenotype in intestinal DCs involved in the generation of inflammatory immune responses to dietary antigens. By using a double transgenic murine model that resembles human celiac disease, it was demonstrated that RA synergizes with IL-15 in promoting the breakdown of gluten tolerance and the development of enteropathy. The tissue microenvironment modulates DC function, and immune therapies that are based on RA aiming to restore oral tolerance should be used with caution because the presence of IL-15 (and/or other proinflammatory cytokines) may have undesirable effects.},

   abstract = {Iron is necessary for the normal development of multiple vital processes. Iron deficiency (ID) may be caused by several diseases, even by physiological situations that increase requirements for this mineral. One of its possible causes is a poor dietary iron intake, which is infrequent in developed countries, but quite common in developing areas. In these countries, dietary ID is highly prevalent and comprises a real public health problem and a challenge for health authorities. ID, with or without anemia, can cause important symptoms that are not only physical, but can also include a decreased intellectual performance. All this, together with a high prevalence, can even have negative implications for a community's economic and social development. Treatment consists of iron supplements. Prevention of ID obviously lies in increasing the dietary intake of iron, which can be difficult in developing countries. In these regions, foods with greater iron content are scarce, and attempts are made to compensate this by fortifying staple foods with iron. The effectiveness of this strategy is endorsed by multiple studies. On the other hand, in developed countries, ID with or without anemia is nearly always associated with diseases that trigger a negative balance between iron absorption and loss. Its management will be based on the treatment of underlying diseases, as well as on oral iron supplements, although these latter are limited by their tolerance and low potency, which on occasions may compel a change to intravenous administration. Iron deficiency has a series of peculiarities in pediatric patients, in the elderly, in pregnant women, and in patients with dietary restrictions, such as celiac disease.},

   abstract = {BACKGROUND: Nonresponsive celiac disease (CD) is defined by persistent or recurrent symptoms, common after treatment with a gluten-free diet (GFD). OBJECTIVE: To evaluate the utility of capsule endoscopy (CE) in nonresponsive CD. DESIGN: Case-control study. SETTING: Tertiary-care center. PATIENTS: Forty-two consecutive patients with nonresponsive CD and 84 age- and sex-matched CD-free controls who underwent CE were included. In addition, capsules taken after treatment with a GFD were retrospectively evaluated in 30 patients with uncomplicated CD. INTERVENTION: CE. MAIN OUTCOME MEASUREMENTS: Diagnostic accuracy of CE for the detection of mucosal abnormalities in nonresponsive CD. RESULTS: Macroscopic features of villous atrophy were detected in 13 of 42 patients (31%) with nonresponsive CD compared with none among 84 CD-free controls and 14 of 30 patients (47%) with uncomplicated CD. Among nonresponsive CD cases, the overall sensitivity and specificity of CE for the detection of any degree of villous atrophy as graded by histology were 56% and 85%, respectively. Single or multiple erosions/ulcerations of the gut were observed in 19% of nonresponsive CD patients, 18% of CD-free controls, and 31% of patients with uncomplicated CD (P = .35). The presence of erosions/ulcerations was associated with increased aspirin/nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drug use in nonresponsive CD (P =.05). Two severe complications (ulcerative jejunitis and adenocarcinoma) were detected by CE in nonresponsive CD. LIMITATIONS: Single-center, retrospective study. CONCLUSIONS: Mucosal abnormalities were observed by CE in patients with both nonresponsive CD and uncomplicated CD. CE can detect severe complications in patients with nonresponsive CD.},

   abstract = {BACKGROUND & AIMS: The cornerstone of treatment for coeliac disease is a gluten-free diet (GFD). However, adherence to a GFD is variable. Recently investigators have been reporting their preliminary findings using novel therapies. In addition, there is a growing interest in the use of complementary or alternative medicine (CAM) in gastrointestinal illnesses. These observations suggest that patients with coeliac disease may be dissatisfied with a GFD and possibly are seeking/using alternative therapies for their disease. Our aim was to assess the satisfaction levels of adults with coeliac disease towards a GFD, their use of oral CAM and views regarding novel therapies. METHODS: 310 patients with coeliac disease completed a questionnaire survey while attending their out-patient appointment. The control group comprised 477 individuals. RESULTS: Over 40% of patients with coeliac disease were dissatisfied with a GFD. The frequency of CAM use in patients with coeliac disease was 21.6% (67/310) vs 27% in the control group (129/477), p=0.09. All patients expressed an interest in novel therapies, with a vaccine being the first choice in 42% of patients, 35% and 23% for anti- zonulin and peptidases, respectively. Universally, patients placed genetically modified wheat as the lowest preference. CONCLUSIONS: A large proportion of patients with coeliac disease are dissatisfied with a GFD. Coeliac patients are not taking CAM any more than controls, suggesting they do not view CAM as an alternative to a GFD. However, all the patients in this survey were keen to consider novel therapies, with a vaccine being the most preferred option.},

   abstract = {This review will try to address the question of whether we are diagnosing too many people with coeliac disease. The key reasons for diagnosing coeliac disease may be that it is a common condition affecting up to 1% of the adult population. Delays in diagnosis are common. The average time delay reported by Coeliac UK (National Medical Patient Charity), for patients with symptoms prior to the diagnosis being made is 13 years. For every adult case detected, it is estimated that there are eight cases not detected. Patients with coeliac disease have an associated morbidity and mortality. In addition, quality of life studies suggest that the majority of patients benefit from a gluten-free diet (GFD). Furthermore, the GFD reduces or alleviates the risk of the associated complications. All of these facts could even be used to support the argument for screening! However, conversely the tests for coeliac disease are not 100% sensitive and specific. In addition, we do not know whether patients with milder symptoms will derive less benefit from treatment and are at less risk of complications. Furthermore, evidence presented in this review suggests that actual outcomes for screening studies in an adult population have revealed poor uptake and subsequently difficulties with adherence. What little published data that are available also infers that individuals recognised through screening programmes could have been detected if carefully questioned for symptoms. There is evidence to suggest that diagnosing celiac disease is cost-effective and that the diagnostic costs are offset by reduced medical expenditures, reduced hospital and general practice attendances, but this view depends on the population prevalence of coeliac disease. We believe on the basis of the evidence presented in this review that we are not diagnosing too many adults with coeliac disease. However, the authors consider case-finding with a low threshold for serological testing to be the optimal approach. If you look for coeliac disease you will find it.},

   abstract = {The rise in gluten consumption over time has led to the increasing recognition of coeliac disease (CD) with associated complications. However, only recently has there been an appreciation that the spectrum of gluten-related disorders is greater than just CD, which may explain the growing global popularity in gluten-free products. Current literature suggests that a newly recognised clinical entity in the form of non-coeliac gluten sensitivity (NCGS) may be the most common gluten-related disorder encountered by healthcare professionals, although its exact prevalence is as yet unknown. This article will review the historical relationship between mankind and gluten as well as the progressive recognition that it is possible for gluten to have a deleterious effect on our health. To this effect we discuss the prevalence, diagnosis and complications of CD including the benefits derived from a gluten-free diet (GFD). Finally, we discuss our current understanding of NCGS, in addition to highlighting the need for further research to determine the extent, clinicopathological features and serological biomarkers to help recognise this emerging condition in clinical practice.},

PLACE AND DURATION OF STUDY: Paediatrics Unit, Sheikh Zayed Medical College and Hospital, Rahim Yar Khan, from September 2009 to September 2010. METHODOLOGY: Forty children aged between 4 to 13 years of either gender, presenting with complaints of recurrent diarrhea, abdominal distention, severe emaciation and dehydration were included. The information about breast feeding, weaning diets, age of introduction of wheat diets, onset of diarrhea, characteristics and frequency of stools, growth, vaccination status, symptoms in 1st degree relatives, restriction of Gluten diet in the past and anthropometric measures were recorded. Serological tests against anti-Tissue Transglultaminase (anti-tTG) antibodies were obtained in all cases. Upper gastrointestinal endoscopies were performed and multiple biopsies were taken from distal parts of duodenum. RESULTS: Among the forty children, twenty four (60%) were females and 16 were males (40%). The mean age was 6.35 +/- 2.83 years. Thirty five (87.5%) parents were cousins. Breast feeding was not exclusively given and the Gluten containing weaning diets were given as early as 3.5 months of age. Thirty (75%) children presented with typical sign and symptoms of CD. Celiac crisis presented with profuse diarrhea, severe dehydration; abdominal distention; pedal edema, carpopedal spasm due to tetany; wasted muscles; head drop and inability to stand. The serum TtG antibodies in thirty-eight cases (95%) were above the cut off level of 7 u/ml ranging from 35-99 u/ml. The histopathology of specimens from distal duodenum revealed lesions of M3 type in thirteen (32.5%) and M2 type in eighteen cases (45%). All cases recovered and improved on follow-up after strict adherence to gluten-free diet (GFD). CONCLUSION: Majority of children with Celiac disease presented with typical symptom, while Celiac crisis was characterized by severe dehydration, weakness and calcium deficiency signs. Most were the product of consanguineous marriages and were given Gluten-containing weaning foods as early as the 4th month of life.},

Objective of the study is to investigate (1) the course of glycemic control at CD diagnosis and after the initiation of a gluten-free diet (GFD) in T1DM patients; (2) the prevalence of diabetic complications in T1DM patients with adult onset of CD. In 20 hospitals in the Netherlands, we identified T1DM patients diagnosed with CD at adult age. We retrospectively collected glycated hemoglobin (HbA1c) levels before CD diagnosis, at CD diagnosis, and the most recent HbA1c levels as well as the presence of nephropathy and retinopathy. The control group consisted of patients with T1DM and negative CD serology matched for age, gender, T1DM duration, and HbA1c levels. Thirty-one patients were eligible with a median duration of T1DM and CD of 27 years (IQR 14-37) and 3 years (IQR 1-8), respectively. The matched control group consisted of 46 patients. HbA1c levels at the moment of CD diagnosis were 7.5 % (IQR 7.1-8) [58 mmol/mol] and at the most recent visit 7.4 % (IQR 6.9-7.9, P = 0.15) [57 mmol/mol] indicating no difference. Prevalence of retinopathy was lower in T1DM + CD group compared with controls, (38.7 vs 67.4 %, P < 0.05), whereas no difference in the prevalence of nephropathy was found between the groups (P = 0.09). In conclusion, T1DM + CD patients have less retinopathy compared to T1DM patients without CD. A GFD possibly favorable affects the development of vascular complications in T1DM patients.},

   abstract = {Celiac disease is an autoimmune disorder of the small intestine that is more common than was previously thought. This disease is caused by an inappropriate immune response to wheat gluten, barley, and rye. Three main pathways cause celiac disease: the environmental trigger (gluten), genetic susceptibility, and unusual gut permeability. The only treatment currently available is a strict gluten-free diet. Unfortunately, a majority of patients have difficulty complying with this diet, and the response to therapy is poor. Therefore, alternative treatments are being developed, and new insights into the pathophysiology of celiac disease have led to research into novel therapies. New treatments include engineering gluten-free grains, decreasing intestinal permeability by blockage of the epithelial zonulin receptor, inducing oral tolerance to gluten with a therapeutic vaccine, and degrading immunodominant gliadin peptides using probiotics with endopeptidases or transglutaminase inhibitors. These nondiet-based therapies provide hope for enhanced, lifelong celiac disease management with improved patient compliance and better quality of life.},

   abstract = {BACKGROUND/AIMS: The aim of this study was to compare the fecal calprotectin concentration in children with newly diagnosed celiac disease, children with celiac disease strictly adhering to a gluten-free diet and healthy controls. We also tried to correlate the fecal calprotectin concentration with the clinical presentation, degree of neutrophilic infiltration and the severity of histopathological injury (Marsh grade) in the small bowel mucosa. MATERIAL AND METHODS: The study included three groups: children with untreated celiac disease, children with treated celiac disease, and healthy controls. Moreover, we obtained a second fecal sample from nine newly diagnosed children when their endomysial antibody became negative after gluten-free diet. RESULTS: Fecal calprotectin concentrations were significantly higher in newly diagnosed celiac patients (n=31) compared to patients on gluten-free diet (n=33) and healthy controls (n=34) (117.2 mug/g (3.2-306) vs. 3.7 mug/g (0.5-58.2) and 9.6 mug/g (1-70), respectively, p<0.001). Patients presenting with gastrointestinal symptoms had higher fecal calprotectin concentration compared to the patients presenting with nongastrointestinal symptoms [142.8 (12.2-306) vs. 79.7 (3.2-243.2) respectively, p=0.04]. Nine newly diagnosed patients gave a second fecal sample after starting gluten-free diet when endomysial antibody became negative. Their fecal calprotectin concentration had decreased from 113.7 mug/g (8.7-295.2) to 4.2 mug/g (0.5-20.7) (p<0.01). CONCLUSIONS: Increased fecal calprotectin concentration can be used as a non-invasive marker that might aid in the diagnosis of celiac disease, especially in patients with gastrointestinal presentation. Fecal calprotectin concentration returns to normal on a strict gluten-free diet. Fecal calprotectin may be used as a marker of diet adherence and improvement in gastrointestinal inflammation in children with celiac disease. Additionally, it may be used for the differentiation of celiac disease from functional disorders of the gastrointestinal system.},

Reproductive disorders and pregnancy complications have been associated with CD. Conflicting results have been published concerning CD and the risk of impaired fetal growth with reduced birthweight. The aim of our multicentric, perspective, case-control study was to determine the prevalence of undiagnosed CD in mothers of small for gestational age (SGA) newborns in two regions of Italy. The study included 480 mothers: group A consisted of 284 SGA newborns' mothers and group B consisted of 196 appropriate for gestational age (AGA) newborns' mothers. Tissue transglutaminase type 2 antibodies (TG2) IgA and IgG were measured in blood samples. We diagnosed two new cases of CD in asymptomatic mothers. It may be appropriate to include the TG2 to the panel of prenatal blood test.},

   abstract = {Celiac disease is a food intolerance triggered by the ingestion of gluten-containing cereals; the only therapy is a strict gluten-free diet for life. In recent years, amaranth flour has received considerable attention as an interesting source for the formulation of gluten-free products due to its high nutritional value and low content of prolamins, the toxic proteins for celiacs. The aim of this study was to characterize 40 amaranth varieties using both SDS-PAGE/immunoblotting and ELISA to assess their possible tolerance by celiac subjects. All of the amaranth samples studied showed similar binding affinities for both specific anti-gliadin antibodies and human IgAs. In most amaranth grains, the content of gluten-like proteins measured by ELISA was <20 ppm. The molecular characterization of amaranth proteins suggests that amaranth is safe for celiacs to consume. It is recommended that the most suitable amaranth varieties are those having the lowest content of proteins cross-reacting with anti-gliadin antibodies.},

The disorder is underestimated because of lack of disease awareness. CD is strongly associated with HLA-DQ2 in developing countries. Clinical presentation may be characterized by chronic diarrhea, anemia, stunting and increased mortality. Few studies have addressed atypical or silent CD. Diagnosis is initially made by serologic tests and is confirmed by small intestinal biopsies. In developing countries the adherence to the treatment is still difficult because of poor availability of dedicated gluten-free food.},

   abstract = {The potential relevance of systemic and gastrointestinal immune activation in the pathophysiology and symptom generation in the irritable bowel syndrome (IBS) is supported by a number of observations. Infectious gastroenteritis is the strongest risk factor for the development of IBS and increased rates of IBS-like symptoms have been detected in patients with inflammatory bowel disease in remission or in celiac disease patients on a gluten free diet. The number of T cells and mast cells in the small and large intestine of patients with IBS is increased in a large proportion of patients with IBS over healthy controls. Mediators released by immune cells and likely from other non-immune competent cells impact on the function of enteric and sensory afferent nerves as well as on epithelial tight junctions controlling mucosal barrier of recipient animals, isolated human gut tissues or cell culture systems. Antibodies against microbiota antigens (bacterial flagellin), and increased levels of cytokines have been detected systemically in the peripheral blood advocating the existence of abnormal host-microbial interactions and systemic immune responses. Nonetheless, there is wide overlap of data obtained in healthy controls; in addition, the subsets of patients showing immune activation have yet to be clearly identified. Gender, age, geographic differences, genetic predisposition, diet and differences in the intestinal microbiota likely play a role and further research has to be done to clarify their relevance as potential mechanisms in the described immune system dysregulation. Immune activation has stimulated interest for the potential identification of biomarkers useful for clinical and research purposes and the development of novel therapeutic approaches.},

   abstract = {OBJECTIVES: To assess the usefulness of a new class of antibodies, the anti-deamidated gliadin peptides, in the diagnostic approach to children less than 2 years with suspected celiac disease. PATIENTS AND METHODS: We investigated 40 children (median age: 16.8 months; age range: 4-24 months), with symptoms and signs of chronic enteropathy and high serum levels of conventional anti-gliadin antibodies, but normal values of anti-transglutaminase and anti-endomysial antibodies; all underwent measurement of anti-deamidated gliadin peptides serum levels, upper gastrointestinal endoscopy with biopsies and HLA typing; 40 subjects served as controls. RESULTS: In 29 patients (group A) serum levels of anti-deamidated gliadin peptides were normal and duodenal histology showed a spectrum of abnormalities ranging from mucosal inflammatory infiltrates to villous damage (in almost all cases compatible with Marsh 1-to-2 lesions). All improved on a cow's and soy milk free diet containing gluten. In 11 patients (group B) there were high serum levels of anti-deamidated gliadin peptides and histology showed features suggestive of celiac disease (Marsh 2-to-3 lesions) in all; furthermore, human leucocyte antigen typing was consistent with a celiac disease genetic pattern in all. Group B patients significantly improved on a gluten free diet containing cow's and soy milk proteins. None of the control group was anti-deamidated gliadin peptides positive. CONCLUSIONS: In children younger than 2 years with signs of chronic enteropathy and normal values of classical serum markers of celiac disease, the latter can be predicted by high serum levels of anti-deamidated gliadin peptides.},

   abstract = {BACKGROUND: Coeliac Disease (CD) is an increasingly common autoimmune condition, the treatment of which is a gluten-free diet (GFD). Previous studies fail to reach consensus of the impact this restrictive diet has on an individual's quality of life (QoL). Furthermore, how patient characteristics, such as demographic and educational background, may predict GFD adherence is poorly understood. We aimed to assess which factors had an impact on Qol in patients with CD. METHODS: Case-control postal survey (n=573). Biopsy-proven CD patients (n=225; mean disease duration 8yrs; range 0.5-52yrs; male 26%) and age and sex matched controls (n=348; male 36%) completed The Short-Form 36-Item (SF-36) QoL measure, The Hospital Anxiety & Depression Scale (HADS), GFD assessment, and demographic questionnaire. RESULTS: We found a high proportion of GFD adherence: 'Full Adherence' 65%, 'Partial Adherence' 31%, 'None Adherence' 4%, accompanied however, by 80% of patients reporting difficulty adhering to the GFD: 'Impossible' 5%, 'Mostly difficult' 14%, 'Sometimes difficult' 61%, 'No difficulty' 20%. Negligible differences in QoL scores were observed when comparing full versus partial/none GFD patients (P=>0.05), however, stepwise reductions in QoL and increasing likelihood of anxiety/depression were found in association with increasing degree of difficulty adhering to the GFD (P=<0.0001). Demographic assessment suggests that an affluent background and a university education promote greater GFD adherence. CONCLUSIONS: Most coeliac patients adhere to a GFD but encounter difficulty doing so (potentially influenced by social and educational background). The degree of GFD difficulty is associated with reductions in patient wellbeing and psychological distress that the dietician is critically placed to address.},

   abstract = {Celiac disease (CD) is an autoimmune disorder of the small intestine that occurs in genetically predisposed people at all ages. However, it can be associated also to other immunopathological disorders, and may be associated with abnormal histology in segments of the gut other than the small bowel including colonic inflammation. While guidelines for endoscopic investigation of the jejunum are well defined, no indication is defined for colonic investigation. We describe four cases of concurrent CD and microscopic colitis (MC) diagnosed at our department over a 10-year period and analyzed the main features and outcomes of CD in this setting. The symptoms of these patients were improved initially by a gluten-free diet before the onset of MC symptoms. Two of the patients were siblings and had an atypical form of CD. The other two patients with CD and MC also presented with fibrosing alveolitis and were anti-Saccharomyces cerevisiae antibody positive. The co-existence of immune-mediated small bowel and colonic inflammatory and pulmonary diseases are not well-known, and no systematic approach has been used to identify the lifelong patterns of these immune-based diseases. Patients can develop, or present with CD at any stage in life, which can co-exist with other gastrointestinal diseases of (auto-) immune origin. In addition, the familial co-existence and prevalence of MC in patients with a prior diagnosis of CD are unclear. Clinicians managing celiac disease should be aware of these associations and understand when to consider colon investigation.},

   abstract = {The endocannabinoid system has been extensively investigated in experimental colitis and inflammatory bowel disease, but not in celiac disease, where only a single study showed increased levels of the major endocannabinoid anandamide in the atrophic mucosa. On this basis, we aimed to investigate anandamide metabolism in celiac disease by analyzing transcript levels (through quantitative real-time reverse transcriptase-polymerase chain reaction), protein concentration (through immunoblotting) and activity (through radioassays) of enzymes responsible for anandamide synthesis (N-acylphosphatidyl-ethanolamine specific phospholipase D, NAPE-PLD) and degradation (fatty acid amide hydrolase, FAAH) in the duodenal mucosa of untreated celiac patients, celiac patients on a gluten-free diet for at least 12 months and control subjects. Also, treated celiac biopsies cultured ex vivo with peptic-tryptic digest of gliadin were investigated. Our in vivo experiments showed that mucosal NAPE-PLD expression and activity are higher in untreated celiac patients than treated celiac patients and controls, with no significant difference between the latter two groups. In keeping with the in vivo data, the ex vivo activity of NAPE-PLD was significantly enhanced by incubation of peptic-tryptic digest of gliadin with treated celiac biopsies. On the contrary, in vivo mucosal FAAH expression and activity did not change in the three groups of patients, and accordingly, mucosal FAAH activity was not influenced by treatment with peptic-tryptic digest of gliadin. In conclusion, our findings provide a possible pathophysiological explanation for the increased anandamide concentration previously shown in active celiac mucosa.},

Our improved diagnostic modalities have allowed us to diagnose more and more patients with atypical symptoms who improve on gluten-free diet (GFD). We discuss here the latest findings regarding the various hematological manifestations of celiac disease and their management. Anemia remains the most common hematological manifestation of celiac disease due to many mechanisms, and can be the sole presenting symptom. Other manifestations include thrombocytosis and thrombocythemia, leukopenia, thromboembolism, increased bleeding tendency, IgA deficiency, splenic dysfunction, and lymphoma. The diagnosis of celiac disease should always be kept in mind when a patient presents with unexplained and isolated hematological finding. Once diagnosed, patients should adhere to GFD and be educated about the potential complications of this disease. We herein present an algorithm for adequate management and follow-up.},

   abstract = {BACKGROUND: Of antigen-presenting cells (APCs) expressing HLA-DQ molecules in the celiac disease (CD) lesion, CD11c(+) dendritic cells (DCs) co-expressing the monocyte marker CD14 are increased, whereas other DC subsets (CD1c(+) or CD103(+)) and CD163(+)CD11c(-) macrophages are all decreased. It is unclear whether these changes result from chronic inflammation or whether they represent early events in the gluten response. We have addressed this in a model of in vivo gluten challenge. METHODS: Treated HLA-DQ2(+) CD patients (n = 12) and HLA-DQ2(+) gluten-sensitive control subjects (n = 12) on a gluten-free diet (GFD) were orally challenged with gluten for three days. Duodenal biopsies obtained before and after gluten challenge were subjected to immunohistochemistry. Single cell digests of duodenal biopsies from healthy controls (n = 4), treated CD (n = 3) and untreated CD (n = 3) patients were analyzed by flow cytometry. RESULTS: In treated CD patients, the gluten challenge increased the density of CD14(+)CD11c(+) DCs, whereas the density of CD103(+)CD11c(+) DCs and CD163(+)CD11c(-) macrophages decreased, and the density of CD1c(+)CD11c(+) DCs remained unchanged. Most CD14(+)CD11c(+) DCs co-expressed CCR2. The density of neutrophils also increased in the challenged mucosa, but in most patients no architectural changes or increase of CD3(+) intraepithelial lymphocytes (IELs) were found. In control tissue no significant changes were observed. CONCLUSIONS: Rapid accumulation of CD14(+)CD11c(+) DCs is specific to CD and precedes changes in mucosal architecture, indicating that this DC subset may be directly involved in the immunopathology of the disease. The expression of CCR2 and CD14 on the accumulating CD11c(+) DCs indicates that these cells are newly recruited monocytes.},

STUDY DESIGN: We studied 156 subjects on a GFD (mean age, 10 years) and 353 healthy controls (mean age, 12 years). All subjects completed tests on the Nowicki-Strickland Locus of Control Scale; the subjects with CD also completed a questionnaire to measure compliance with dietary treatment and the disease's impact on QoL. RESULTS: There was no difference in LoC values between patients with CD and controls. Subjects with CD with good dietary compliance had a more internal LoC compared with those who were not compliant (P = .01). Patients who reported a satisfactory QoL had a more internal LoC compared with those who reported negative affects on QoL due to CD (P = .01). CONCLUSIONS: Our study confirms the usefulness of the LoC concept for identifying those patients who might be at risk for dietary transgression. Given the enhanced, psychological, and social well being that can result from adherence to a GFD, educational and psychological support can help internalize the LoC in those patients at risk for dietary transgression.},

   abstract = {Miscarriage concerns approximately 15% of pregnancies and recurrent fetal loss (RFL) constitute a particular situation concerning approximately 1% of women. The etiologic inquiry is often disappointing. Nutritional factors represent a promising aspect, insufficiently investigated even if numerous studies underline their impact on fertility, gametogenesis, embryonic development and pregnancies outcome. Obesity is considered as an independent risk factor for miscarriage, involved in oocyte and embryo quality, but also in endometrial receptivity. The male part involved in miscarriage was for a long time underestimated, neglecting the role of sperm in embryo development. If conventional sperm analysis remains essential, new investigations have to be considered such as sperm DNA or oxidant stress evaluation. It is particularly important to take into account nutritional factors as favoring miscarriage because they represent a flexible factor on which intervention is possible to improve pregnancy outcome, with toxics eviction and recommendations for diversified and well-balanced food. At last, effects of nutritional complements for miscarriage prevention remain controversial.},

   abstract = {BACKGROUND: Alterations of small intestinal transit and gallbladder (GB) motility have been reported in celiac disease (CD) in studies involving, in most cases, non-physiological experimental conditions and artificial stimuli to motility. Our aims were to quantitate non-invasively small intestinal transit time and GB emptying during administration of a physiological and palatable solid meal, and to assess the effect of gluten-free diet (GFD). METHODS: We simultaneously measured mouth-to-cecum transit time (MCTT) using a validated H(2) breath test, and GB motility using ultrasonography. We studied CD patients before (n = 19) and during (n = 14) GFD, and healthy volunteers (n = 24) following administration of a physiological solid meal (Kcal 539). KEY RESULTS: Mouth-to-cecum transit time was more prolonged in CD (mean +/- SEM: 235 +/- 96 min) than in controls (169 +/- 65 min, P = 0.0039). The GB fasting volume and postprandial residual volume were significantly higher in CD than in controls, and GB emptying constant was slower in CD than in controls. During GFD, GB emptying reverted to normal, but MCTT remained unchanged (229 +/- 69 min) and more prolonged in CD than in controls (P = 0.0139). During GFD, duodenal infiltration with lymphocytes and mast cells persisted higher than that in controls, and the number of mast cells lying in proximity of nervous endings did not change. CONCLUSIONS & INFERENCES: Slow postprandial MCTT in response to a physiological meal does not revert to normal during GFD, an effect mirroring incomplete histopathologic recovery.},

   abstract = {SCOPE: The involvement of oxidative stress in gluten-induced toxicity has been evidenced in vitro and in clinical studies but has never been examined in vivo. We recently demonstrated the protective activity of conjugated linoleic acid (CLA), which functions by the activation of nuclear factor erythroid 2-related factor2 (Nrf2), a key transcription factor for the synthesis of antioxidant and detoxifying enzymes (phase 2). Here, we evaluate the involvement of nuclear factor erythroid 2-related factor2 in gliadin-mediated toxicity in human Caco-2 intestinal cells and in gliadin-sensitive human leukocyte antigen-DQ8 transgenic mice (DQ8) and the protective activity of CLA. METHODS AND RESULTS: Gliadin effects in differentiated Caco-2 cells and in DQ8 mice, fed with a gliadin-containing diet with or without CLA supplementation, were evaluated by combining enzymatic, immunochemical, immunohistochemical, and quantitative real-time PCR (qRT-PCR) assays. Gliadin toxicity was accompanied by downregulation of phase 2 and elevates proteasome-acylpeptide hydrolase activities in vitro and in vivo. Notably, gliadin was unable to generate severe oxidative stress extent or pathological consequences in DQ8 mice intestine comparable to those found in celiac patients and the alterations produced were hampered by CLA. CONCLUSION: The beneficial effects of CLA against the depletion of crucial intestinal cytoprotective defenses indicates a novel nutritional approach for the treatment of intestinal disease associated with altered redox homeostasis.},

We established the immune reactivity of the alcohol-soluble fraction from two minor cereals (tef and millet) and two pseudocereals (amaranth and quinoa) which are believed to be nontoxic based on taxonomy. Grains were examined in intestinal T-cell lines (iTCLs), cultures of duodenal explants from HLA-DQ2(+) CD patients and HLA-DQ8 transgenic mice for signs of activation. Our data indicated that tef, millet, amaranth, and quinoa did not show any immune cross-reactivity toward wheat gliadin, and therefore confirming their safety in the diet of CD patients.},

   abstract = {Celiac disease (CD) is an autoimmune disorder caused by a permanent sensitivity to gluten in genetically susceptible individuals. Accurate diagnosis of CD at an early stage and its treatment with a gluten-free diet (GFD) are important for optimum treatment and prognosis. Recently, by employing a noninvasive metabonomic approach, we have shown that CD has a well-defined metabonomic signature. Here we address potential CD patients, defined as subjects who do not have, and have never had, a jejunal biopsy consistent with clear CD, and yet have immunological abnormalities similar to those found in celiac patients. Sixty-one overt CD patients at diagnosis, 29 patients with potential CD, and 51 control subjects were examined by (1)H NMR of their serum and urine: out of 29 potential CD patients, 24 were classified as CD and 5 as control subjects. Potential CD largely shares the metabonomic signature of overt CD. Most metabolites found to be significantly different between control and CD subjects were also altered in potential CD. Our results demonstrate that metabolic alterations may precede the development of small intestinal villous atrophy and provide a further rationale for early institution of GFD in patients with potential CD, as recently suggested by prospective clinical studies.},

   abstract = {BACKGROUND: Intestinal mucosa is leaky in celiac disease (CD), and this alteration may involve changes in hydrophobicity of the mucus surface barrier in addition to alteration of the epithelial barrier. The aims of our study were i) to compare duodenal hydrophobicity as an index of mucus barrier integrity in CD patients studied before (n = 38) and during gluten- free diet (GFD, n = 68), and in control subjects (n = 90), and ii) to check for regional differences of hydrophobicity in the gastro-intestinal tract. METHODS: Hydrophobicity was assessed by measurement of contact angle (CA) (Rame Hart 100/10 goniometer) generated by a drop of water placed on intestinal mucosal biopsies. RESULTS: CA (mean +/- SD) of distal duodenum was significantly lower in CD patients (56 degrees +/- 10 degrees )) than in control subjects (69 degrees +/- 9 degrees , p < 0.0001), and persisted abnormal in patients studied during gluten free diet (56 degrees +/- 9 degrees ; p < 0.005). CA was significantly higher (62 degrees +/- 9 degrees ) in histologically normal duodenal biopsies than in biopsies with Marsh 1-2 (58 degrees +/- 10 degrees ; p < 0.02) and Marsh 3 lesions (57 degrees +/- 10 degrees ; p < 0.02) in pooled results of all patients and controls studied. The order of hydrofobicity along the gastrointestinal tract in control subjects follows the pattern: gastric antrum > corpus > rectum > duodenum > oesophagus > ileum. CONCLUSIONS: We conclude that the hydrophobicity of duodenal mucous layer is reduced in CD patients, and that the resulting decreased capacity to repel luminal contents may contribute to the increased intestinal permeability of CD. This alteration mirrors the severity of the mucosal lesions and is not completely reverted by gluten-free diet. Intestinal hydrophobicity exhibits regional differences in the human intestinal tract.},

The recent identification of immunodominant gluten peptides, the discovery of their cogent properties, and the elucidation of the mechanisms by which they engender immunopathology in genetically susceptible individuals have advanced our understanding of the molecular pathogenesis of this complex disease, enabling the rational design of new therapeutic strategies. The most clinically advanced of these is oral enzyme therapy, in which enzymes capable of proteolyzing gluten (i.e., glutenases) are delivered to the alimentary tract of a celiac sprue patient to detoxify ingested gluten in situ. In this chapter, we discuss the key challenges for discovery and preclinical development of oral enzyme therapies for celiac sprue. Methods for lead identification, assay development, gram-scale production and formulation, and lead optimization for next-generation proteases are described and critically assessed.},

   abstract = {BACKGROUND AND AIM: There is scanty data on the occurrence of celiac disease in patients with type 1 diabetes mellitus in South Asia. Our aim was to study the prevalence and clinical profile of celiac disease in patients with type 1 diabetes mellitus in a tertiary care referral centre in north India. METHODS: Consecutive patients of type 1 diabetes mellitus attending the Endocrine clinic of our institute between January 2002 and December 2008 were screened using anti-tissue transglutaminase antibodies (tTGAb), and those positive were subjected to duodenal biopsy. Clinical profile of these patients was recorded. RESULTS: Out of 189 patients of type 1 diabetes mellitus, 21 (11.1%) were diagnosed to have celiac disease on the basis of positive serology (tTGAb) and duodenal histology. The mean age at diagnosis of diabetes was 10.81 +/- 7.3 years and that of celiac disease was 13.74 +/- 5.71 years, with a difference of 5.18 +/- 4.75 years between the two. Only 2/21 patients with celiac disease had been diagnosed before detection of diabetes mellitus. Short stature was the commonest (52.3%) manifestation of celiac disease, followed by anemia (47.3), weight loss (42.8%), diarrhea (28.6%) and abdominal pain (14.2%). After initiating gluten free diet, 14/16 symptomatic patients had reversal of anemia, weight loss and diarrhea. Growth rate velocity improved from 2.3 +/- 1.0 cm/year to 5.5 +/- 2.4 cm/year in those with short stature. CONCLUSION: Celiac disease is highly prevalent in patients with type 1 diabetes mellitus (11.1%) and majority of them (90.5%) were diagnosed on screening. Routine screening is required for early diagnosis and combat associated co-morbidities.},

We report an 8-year-old girl with previously undiagnosed celiac disease who presented with flaccid quadriparesis secondary to severe hypokalemia associated with celiac crisis. Diagnosis was expedited by an elevated anti-tissue transglutaminase antibody titer. The patient improved with correction of hypokalemia, corticosteroids and gluten-free diet. In tropical countries such as India, where both acute flaccid paresis and diarrhea are usually of infective etiologies, this rare clinical condition should also be considered in the differential diagnosis of both.},

   abstract = {BACKGROUND: Nondiarrheal celiac disease (NDCD) is being increasingly reported but data from India is limited. AIM: We undertook this study to compare the clinical spectrum of NDCD with that of diarrheal/classical celiac disease (CCD). METHOD: This facility-based retrospective observational study included consecutive patients diagnosed with celiac disease (CD) (as per modified ESPGHAN criteria) from October 2009 to August 2011. RESULTS: A total of 381 patients were diagnosed with CD during the study period. NDCD was present in 192 (51.8 %). NDCD had higher mean age at presentation (5.8 +/- 2.8 vs. 6.9 +/- 2.9 years respectively; p = 0.003) and longer duration of symptoms prior to diagnosis (2.9 +/- 1.7 years vs. 3.6 +/- 2.2 years; p = 0.02) as compared to CCD. In the NDCD group, the most frequent gastrointestinal (GI) symptoms were recurrent abdominal pain [122 (63.5 %)] and abdominal distension [102 (53.1 %)] followed by constipation [48 (25 %)], vomiting [76 (39.6 %)] and recurrent oral ulcers [89 (46.4 %)]. Vomiting and constipation were more frequently seen in NDCD as compared to CCD (p < 0.001 in both). Commonly enumerated extraintestinal manifestations in NDCD included failure to thrive [109 (56.8 %)], isolated short stature [36 (18.8 %)], persistent anemia [83 (43.2 %)] and hepatomegaly/splenomegaly or both [56 (29.2 %)]. Associated comorbidities included autoimmune thyroiditis [11 (5.7 %)], type 1 diabetes mellitus [8 (4.2 %)], bronchial asthma [23 (11.9 %)], idiopathic pulmonary hemosiderosis [4 (2.1 %)], Down's syndrome [3 (1.6 %)], alopecia areata [6 (3.1 %)], polyarthritis [2 (1.0 %)], dermatitis herpetiformis [6 (3.1 %)] and chronic liver disease [6 (3.1 %)]. The number of patients with a Marsh score IIIb and above of duodenal biopsy was significantly more in the CCD group (p < 0.001). CONCLUSIONS: NDCD is not uncommon in India. Long-term follow up is needed to evaluate the impact of the disease and of treatment in these children.},

We previously developed a score based on four fast and simple questions that can be administered even by non-expert personnel. The aim of the present study is to verify the reliability of our questionnaire in a new cohort of patients. The questionnaire has a five-level score. From March 2008 to January 2011, the questionnaire was administered to 141 coeliac patients on a GFD, who were undergoing re-evaluation. The score obtained was compared with persistence of both villous atrophy and endomysial antibodies (EMA). The rate of lower scores was higher among the patients with persistence of either villous atrophy (Fisher's exact, P < 0.001; test for trend, P < 0.001) or positive EMA (Fisher's exact, P = 0.001; test for trend, P = 0.018). Given that the coeliac patients have been well instructed on what a GFD means and on how to follow it, our questionnaire is a reliable and simple method to verify compliance to a GFD.},

In some patients, infectious agents may be responsible, whereas in others, celiac disease (CD) may be the cause. In this study, we investigate the causes and the histopathologic features seen in patients with CVID. Eleven patients with CVID and villous atrophy underwent duodenal biopsies, human leukocyte antigen (HLA) typing, and testing for all celiac antibodies. Fifteen patients with CVID and normal villi and 6 patients with CD but without CVID served as controls. Histologic response to a gluten-free diet (GFD) allowed a diagnosis of CD in 3 of 11 patients. In the remaining 8, the lack of a histologic response to a GFD or HLA typing excluded CD. Celiac antibodies gave conflicting results and were of no help. Polymorphonuclear infiltrates and lesions like graft-versus-host disease are seen more often in flat mucosa unresponsive to a GFD. However, the specificity of these findings remains to be determined and response to a GFD remains the only diagnostic criteria for CD in these patients. Villous atrophy was gluten-sensitive in 3 of 11 patients with CVID. It was not related to gluten-responsive CD in most patients.},

   abstract = {OBJECTIVES: Despite increased prescription of a gluten-free diet for gastrointestinal symptoms in individuals who do not have celiac disease, there is minimal evidence that suggests that gluten is a trigger. The aims of this study were to determine whether gluten ingestion can induce symptoms in non-celiac individuals and to examine the mechanism. METHODS: A double-blind, randomized, placebo-controlled rechallenge trial was undertaken in patients with irritable bowel syndrome in whom celiac disease was excluded and who were symptomatically controlled on a gluten-free diet. Participants received either gluten or placebo in the form of two bread slices plus one muffin per day with a gluten-free diet for up to 6 weeks. Symptoms were evaluated using a visual analog scale and markers of intestinal inflammation, injury, and immune activation were monitored. RESULTS: A total of 34 patients (aged 29-59 years, 4 men) completed the study as per protocol. Overall, 56% had human leukocyte antigen (HLA)-DQ2 and/or HLA-DQ8. Adherence to diet and supplements was very high. Of 19 patients (68%) in the gluten group, 13 reported that symptoms were not adequately controlled compared with 6 of 15 (40%) on placebo (P=0.0001; generalized estimating equation). On a visual analog scale, patients were significantly worse with gluten within 1 week for overall symptoms (P=0.047), pain (P=0.016), bloating (P=0.031), satisfaction with stool consistency (P=0.024), and tiredness (P=0.001). Anti-gliadin antibodies were not induced. There were no significant changes in fecal lactoferrin, levels of celiac antibodies, highly sensitive C-reactive protein, or intestinal permeability. There were no differences in any end point in individuals with or without DQ2/DQ8. CONCLUSIONS: "Non-celiac gluten intolerance" may exist, but no clues to the mechanism were elucidated.},

   abstract = {BACKGROUND: Coeliac disease (CD) affects approximately 1% of the population in the UK and is managed by the life-long adherence to a strict gluten-free diet (GFD). Adhering to a GFD is practically difficult and not only affects dietary patterns, but also can affect many other aspects of daily life. The present study aimed to investigate the effect of CD and a GFD on dietary habits and quality of life of a cohort of adult biopsy diagnosed coeliac patients who reside in England. METHODS: The cohort was composed of 146 adult biopsy-diagnosed CD patients, who were all members of the Coeliac UK charity. Participants responded to a self-administered questionnaire considering dietary habits and quality of life. A food frequency questionnaire (FFQ) was used to assess dietary compliance. RESULTS: Generally, English CD patients reported to be in good physical and emotional health, although there were reports of anxiety and depression as a result of CD, most likely as a result of exclusion from social and leisure activities. The cohort reported high levels of dietary compliance (96%) which was supported by FFQ responses. However, there were reports of intentional gluten intake during social situations and when eating take-away foods. The FFQ revealed further examples of gluten ingestion, presumably unintentional, particularly through the consumption of breakfast cereals and starch-based sauces such as cheese sauce, custard and ketchup. CONCLUSIONS: The present study revealed that CD affects a wide range of daily activities and that gluten consumption may be more common than anticipated with possible consequences on health.},

   abstract = {Food intolerance is becoming increasingly prevalent, and increasing numbers of athletes have celiac disease. This poses challenges as dietary recommendations for exercise are largely based on gluten-containing carbohydrate-rich foods. The K4 cycle race covers 384 km around the Coromandel Peninsula, New Zealand. Lack of sleep, darkness, and temperature variations pose a number of nutritional challenges. Limited food choices present those with celiac disease with even greater challenges. This case study describes the intakes of one such athlete during training and competing in the K4. Nutritional intakes were obtained during training using weighed-food records and during the race via dietary recall and the weighing of foods pre- and post-race. As simple substitution of gluten-containing foods for gluten-free foods leads to increased energy intake, alternatives need to be considered. During the race, insufficient energy was consumed to meet the nutritional guidelines for endurance performance. This was probably due to the nature of the course, racing conditions, the consistency of gluten-free food, and, toward the end of the race, sensory-specific satiety.},

   abstract = {INTRODUCTION: Plasma citrulline is not incorporated in endogenous or exogenous proteins so it is a theoretical marker of villous atrophy. Our aim was to correlate plasma citrulline levels with severity of villous atrophy in celiac patients. METHODS: Observational case-control study longitudinal in children 16 month-old to 14 year-old: 48 with untreated celiac disease, 9 celiac children under gluten free diet and 35 non-celiac healthy children. Plasma amino acids concentration is determined, expressed in mumol/L, and so are other clinical and analytical data. RESULTS: No statistically significative difference found in the referring to BMI, age or renal function. Small increase in fecal fat in celiac children. Citrulline, arginine and glutamine are significantly lower in cases (17.7 mumol/l, 38.7 mumol/l, 479.6 mumol/l respectively) than in controls (28.9 mumol/l, 56.2 mumol/l, 563.7 mumol/l). Citrulline levels are significantly lower in the severe degrees of atrophy than in mild ones (13.8 mumol/l vs. 19.7 mumol/l, p < 0.05), not happening so with rest of amminoacids. SUMMARY: Postabsortive mean of plasma citrulline is a good marker of reduction in enterocyte mass in celiac patients with villous atrophy; secondary reduction in plasma arginine too. Just a small histological alteration in intestinal biopsy is enough to differentiate citrulline in cases and controls and besides it can be seen that high levels of atrophy present with lower plasma citrulline.},

   abstract = {BACKGROUND & AIMS: Celiac disease is a diet-induced, T cell-mediated enteropathy. The HLA variant DQ2.5 increases risk of the disease, and the homologous DQ2.2 confers a lower level of risk. As many as 5% of patients with celiac disease carry DQ2.2 without any other risk alleles. Epitopes commonly recognized by T cells of patients with HLA-DQ2.5 bind stably to DQ2.5 but unstably to DQ2.2. We investigated the response to gluten in patients with HLA-DQ2.2. METHODS: We generated intestinal T-cell lines and clones from 7 patients with HLA-DQ2.2 (but not DQ2.5) and characterized the responses of the cells to gluten. The epitope off-rate was evaluated by gel filtration and T cell-based assays. Peptide binding to DQ2.2 was studied with peptide substitutes and DQ2 mutants. RESULTS: Patients with DQ2.2 and no other risk alleles had gluten-reactive T cells that did not respond to the common DQ2.5-restricted T-cell epitopes. Instead, many of the T cells responded to a distinct epitope that was not recognized by those from patients with HLA-DQ2.5. This immunodominant epitope bound stably to DQ2.2. A serine residue at P3 was required for the stable binding. The effect of this residue related to a polymorphism at DQalpha22 that was previously shown to determine stable binding of peptides to DQ2.5. CONCLUSIONS: High levels of kinetic stability of peptide-major histocompatibility complexes are required to generate T-cell responses to gluten in celiac disease; the lower risk from DQ2.2 relates to constraints imposed on gluten peptides to stably bind this HLA molecule. These observations increase our understanding of the role of the major histocompatibility complex in determining T-cell responses in patients with celiac disease and are important for peptide-based vaccination strategies.},

   abstract = {Tolerable gluten thresholds in gluten free products have long been debated together with issues of cross contamination of gluten free cereals during the milling process. It is well established that a totally gluten free diet is virtually impossible owing to the presence of traces of gluten. It is estimated that daily consumption of gluten from contaminated gluten free foods is in the range of 5 to 50 mg. We believe evidence is mounting that it may be possible for some coeliac patients to tolerate gluten above the limits considered permissible at threshold levels. Conversely, it seems there is evidence that some patients might have a much lower threshold for gluten. Whatever would be the individual threshold, GFD may be of benefit to any symptomatic patients even those with milder enteropathy like microscopic enteritis.},

   abstract = {OBJECTIVE: The high prevalence of celiac disease (CD) prompted us to evaluate a new, noninvasive disease screening strategy. The aim was to identify CD in 6- to 8-year-old children for a timely diagnosis, start gluten-free diet (GFD) in compliant subjects, achieve the growth target, and prevent CD complications. METHODS: Five thousand subjects were invited to participate in the study. Four thousand forty-eight saliva samples were tested for anti-tissue transglutaminase (tTG) immunoglobulin (Ig)A using a fluid-phase radioimmunoprecipitation method. Positive children were tested for serum radioimmunoassay tTG IgA, enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay tTG IgA, and anti-endomysium IgA. Children confirmed as positive by serum assays underwent endoscopy with duodenal biopsies and, at the diagnosis of CD, were suggested to start GFD. RESULTS: Consent was obtained from 4242 parents (84.8%) for the screening to be performed, and adequate saliva samples were collected from 4048 children (95.4%). Thirty-two children were found to be salivary tTG IgA positive and 9 with borderline autoantibody levels. Thirty-one of the 32 and 3 of the 9 subjects were also serum positive. Twenty-eight children showed villous atrophy when undergoing intestinal biopsy, whereas 1 had Marsh 1 lesions; 3 children were suggested to start GFD without performing endoscopy. CD prevalence in the population investigated (including 19 CD known cases) was 1.16%. The ratio between screening-detected patients and those diagnosed before the screening was 3:2. The ratio between symptomatic and asymptomatic patients was 1:1.6. CONCLUSIONS: We demonstrated that it is possible to perform a powerful, simple, well-accepted, and sensitive CD screening using saliva. Until now, the compliance with GFD in children with CD has been optimal.},

   abstract = {BACKGROUND: Dermatitis herpetiformis (DH) is a rare gluten-sensitive blistering itchy skin disease, strictly related to coeliac disease (CD). Direct immunofluorescence, demonstrating IgA granular deposits localized either in the dermal papillae or along the dermo-epidermal junction, is currently the gold standard for diagnosis of DH. It has been shown that DH immunocomplexes contain epidermal transglutaminase (eTG) and that sera from patients with DH contain antibodies specifically directed against eTG. OBJECTIVES: We studied the usefulness of serum eTG antibodies in discriminating between DH, CD and other gastrointestinal and dermatologic diseases. METHODS: eTG antibodies were tested in 308 adult patients' sera: 44 patients with untreated dermatitis herpetiformis (UDH), 99 patients with untreated coeliac disease (UCD), 70 dermatological controls and 95 gastrointestinal controls. RESULTS: In UDH eTG antibody levels were significantly higher than in DH patients on gluten-free diet, UCD, gastrointestinal controls and dermatological controls. In UCD eTG antibodies strongly correlated with tissue transglutaminase (tTG) antibodies, whereas in UDH no significant correlation was observed. CONCLUSION: Serum IgA eTG antibody determination can efficiently distinguish UDH from other dermatological itchy diseases and is highly sensitive to gluten-free diet.},

   abstract = {UNLABELLED: Thrombosis events may occur in celiac disease. Thrombophilic risk factors have been reported. INTRODUCTION: To report two cases of cerebral venous thrombosis in celiac disease patients and to determine associated thrombophilic factors. Case 1: a 63-year-old woman was admitted for cerebral venous thrombosis. Her past history included celiac disease which was untreated for the last 10 years. Biological data showed moderate hyperhomocysteinemia and positive reaction for antiphospholipid antibodies. Case 2: a 19-year-old girl was hospitalized for seizures and impaired consciousness. MRA demonstrated longitudinal sinus thrombosis with parietal infarction. Biological findings showed: protein S deficiency and positive reaction for antiendomysium and antigliadin antibodies. Gastroesophageal endoscopy with biopsy showed villous atrophy. Both patients improved under anticoagulant treatment. CONCLUSION: The sites of associated venous thrombosis are generally unusual in celiac disease, yet the cerebral localization is only exceptionally reported. It is essential to search for risk factors. Gluten-free diet remains the mainstay treatment for patients with celiac disease.},

   abstract = {As gut immaturity precludes full enteral feeding, very low birth weight (VLBW) preterm infants receive parenteral nutrition (PN) during the first few weeks of life. Weaning VLBW infants off PN, however, is a top priority since PN is associated with a high risk of complications. The decision making is purely empirical, as there is currently no suitable index of gastrointestinal (GI) maturity. Plasma citrulline concentration is considered an index of GI function in conditions such as short-bowel syndrome and coeliac disease in adults. To identify the factors determining urinary citrulline excretion, and determine whether urinary citrulline excretion could be used as a non-invasive index of GI tolerance to enteral feeding, nutritional intake and urinary citrulline were monitored bi-weekly in forty-seven preterm infants < 1500 g (interquartiles 880-1320 g), during their stay in the Neonatology unit. Median urinary citrulline was 24.7 mumol/mmol creatinine (14.5-38.6 mumol/mmol creatinine). No relationship was observed with the percentage of energy tolerated enterally. In multivariate regression analysis, weak correlations were found with post-conceptional age (P = 0.001), parenteral amino acid supply (P = 0.001) and the daily volume of enteral mixture administered (P = 0.043). A significant correlation was found with urinary nitrite+nitrate excretion (r 0.47; P < 0.001). We conclude that in preterm infants: (1) one of the major determinants of urinary citrulline may be the biosynthesis of citrulline from arginine by NO-synthase; (2) urinary citrulline cannot be used to predict GI tolerance. This is consistent with the observations that, in neonatal gut, citrulline is converted to arginine in situ rather than exported towards the kidneys as observed in adults.},

   abstract = {Celiac disease (CD) is identified by histopathologic changes in the small intestine which normalize during a gluten-free diet. The histopathologic assessment of duodenal biopsies is usually routine but can be difficult. This study investigated gene expression profiling as a diagnostic tool. A total of 109 genes were selected to reflect alterations in crypt-villi architecture, inflammatory response, and intestinal permeability and were examined for differential expression in normal mucosa compared with CD mucosa in pediatric patients. Biopsies were classified using discriminant analysis of gene expression. Fifty genes were differentially expressed, of which eight (APOC3, CYP3A4, OCLN, MAD2L1, MKI67, CXCL11, IL17A, and CTLA4) discriminated normal mucosa from CD mucosa without classification errors using leave-one-out cross-validation (n = 39) and identified the degree of mucosal damage. Validation using an independent set of biopsies (n = 27) resulted in four discrepant cases. Biopsies from two of these cases showed a patchy distribution of lesions, indicating that discriminant analysis based on single biopsies failed to identify CD mucosa. In the other two cases, serology support class according to discriminant analysis and histologic specimens were judged suboptimal but assessable. Gene expression profiling shows promise as a diagnostic tool and for follow-up of CD, but further evaluation is needed.},

   abstract = {BACKGROUND AND AIM: Studies of adults and children with celiac disease (CD) performed mostly in tertiary care centers have reported an increased risk of overweight during gluten-free diet (GFD). We measured body mass index (BMI) of CD children followed by family pediatricians in order to estimate prevalence of underweight and overweight at diagnosis and to describe BMI changes during GFD. METHODS AND RESULTS: We compared 150 CD children (age range 2-16 yrs) under GFD from a median (IQR) time of 4.4 (4.2) years with 288 healthy children matched for gender and age. We also evaluated retrospectively BMI changes between CD diagnosis and the current evaluation. The median (IQR) BMI of CD patients was significantly lower than that of controls [-0.38 (1.46) vs. 0.09 (1.18) SDS, p < 0.0001, Italian reference data]. Using the International Obesity Task Force classifications, CD children were less frequently overweight or obese (12% vs. 23.3%, p = 0.014) and more frequently underweight (16% vs. 4.5%, p < 0.001) than controls. During GFD, there was a marked decrease of number of underweight subjects (13 vs. 27) and a minimal increase of number of overweight subjects (9 vs. 6) (p < 0.001). CONCLUSIONS: The frequency of overweight and obesity at diagnosis of CD and during GFD in children followed by family pediatricians is substantially lower than that reported in tertiary care centers. On the other hand, the high frequency of underweight at diagnosis confirms the need of careful personalized nutritional management.},

   abstract = {Celiac disease (CD) is an autoimmune disorder occurring in genetically susceptible subjects. The incidence of CD is around 1%, and it is much more common in first-degree relatives of CD patients, 10%-18%. However, the pattern of the genetic inheritance is still obscure. Environmental factors are undoubtedly affecting the disease's clinical presentation, time at presentation, and may have an effect on the characteristics of the disease. The clinical presentation of CD has shifted during the previous decades from the classical presentation in which the toddler suffers from diarrhea, constipation, vomiting, failure to thrive, abdominal distension, etc., to the child with a monosymptomatic presentation, such as anemia, as well as an enlarged list of extra-intestinal disorders. The diagnosis of CD is being established by symptoms consistent with CD and positive serology. The ultimate diagnosis should be made upon histological evaluation of the small bowel mucosa. The treatment of CD is a lifelong, strict gluten-free diet (GFD). Compliance with a GFD is quite difficult. Therefore, new strategies for prevention and treatment modalities other than GFD are greatly needed. Recently several promising therapeutic modalities have been developed; these include resuming traditional baking techniques. Another methodology is using probiotic-driven prolylendopeptidase. Another pathway to tackle the therapeutic option in CD is by down-regulation of the activity of zonulin-the active pump enabling gluten to enter the enterocytes. We are facing an era where other modalities beyond a GFD might allow CD patients to be able to tolerate occasionally a small amount of gluten in their diet.},

We evaluated HLA-DQ2-gliadin tetramers for detection of gluten-specific T cells in peripheral blood and histological changes in the duodenum after a short gluten challenge as a diagnostic tool. METHODS: HLA-DQ2+ individuals on a GFD for at least 4 weeks were investigated; 35 with uncertain diagnosis, 13 CD patients, and 2 disease controls. All participants had a challenge with four slices of gluten-containing white bread, daily for 3 days (d1-d3). An esophagogastroduodenoscopy with biopsy sampling was done on d0 and d4. Biopsies were scored according to revised Marsh criteria. Peripheral blood CD4+ T cells were isolated, stained with HLA-DQ2-gliadin peptide tetramers, and analyzed by flow cytometry on d0 and d6. RESULTS: After challenge, a positive tetramer test was seen in 11/13 CD patients. Four of these subjects also showed typical histological changes on challenge. Of the 35 patients with uncertain diagnosis, 3 were diagnosed with CD. Two of these three patients had both positive tetramer staining and histological changes in biopsies after challenge. CONCLUSIONS: Tetramer staining for gluten-specific T cells is a sensitive method in detecting an immune response in CD patients after a short gluten challenge. The prevalence of CD in the group with self-prescribed GFD was about 10%.},

   abstract = {OBJECTIVE: In contrast to coeliac disease (CD), the mechanism behind non-coeliac gluten sensitivity (NCGS) is unclear. The aims of the study were to measure the presence of somatization, personality traits, anxiety, depression, and health-related quality of life in NCGS individuals compared with CD patients and healthy controls, and to compare the response to gluten challenge between NCGS and CD patients. MATERIAL AND METHODS: We examined 22 CD patients and 31 HLA-DQ2+ NCGS patients without CD, all on a gluten-free diet. All but five CD patients were challenged orally for 3 days with gluten; symptom registration was performed during challenge. A comparison group of 40 healthy controls was included. Patients and healthy controls completed questionnaires regarding anxiety, depression, neuroticism and lie, hostility and aggression, alexithymia and health locus of control, physical complaints, and health-related quality of life. RESULTS: The NCGS patients reported more abdominal (p = 0.01) and non-abdominal (p < 0.01) symptoms after gluten challenge than CD patients. There were no significant differences between CD and NCGS patients regarding personality traits, level of somatization, quality of life, anxiety, and depressive symptoms. The somatization level was low in CD and NCGS groups. Symptom increase after gluten challenge was not related to personality in NCGS patients. CONCLUSIONS: NCGS patients did not exhibit a tendency for general somatization. Personality and quality of life did not differ between NCGS and CD patients, and were mostly at the same level as in healthy controls. NCGS patients reported more symptoms than CD patients after gluten challenge.},

   abstract = {Celiac disease is a human leukocyte antigen (HLA)-DQ2- and/or DQ8-associated T cell-mediated disorder that is induced by dietary gluten. Although it is established how gluten peptides bind HLA-DQ8 and HLA-DQ2, it is unclear how such peptide-HLA complexes are engaged by the T cell receptor (TCR), a recognition event that triggers disease pathology. We show that biased TCR usage (TRBV9( *)01) underpins the recognition of HLA-DQ8-alpha-I-gliadin. The structure of a prototypical TRBV9( *)01-TCR-HLA-DQ8-alpha-I-gliadin complex shows that the TCR docks centrally above HLA-DQ8-alpha-I-gliadin, in which all complementarity-determining region-beta (CDRbeta) loops interact with the gliadin peptide. Mutagenesis at the TRBV9( *)01-TCR-HLA-DQ8-alpha-I-gliadin interface provides an energetic basis for the Vbeta bias. Moreover, CDR3 diversity accounts for TRBV9( *)01(+) TCRs exhibiting differing reactivities toward the gliadin epitopes at various deamidation states. Accordingly, biased TCR usage is an important factor in the pathogenesis of DQ8-mediated celiac disease.},

   abstract = {Gluten sensitivity appears to be emerging as a separate condition from celiac disease, yet no clear definition or diagnosis exists. As a result, patients with gluten sensitivity experience delayed diagnosis and continuing symptoms if they consume gluten. This emerging medical problem may involve human genetics, plant genetic modifications, gluten as a food additive, environmental toxins, hormonal influences, intestinal infections and autoimmune diseases. The treatment is similar to that for celiac disease - a gluten-free diet. The use of a gluten-free diet or an elimination diet is encouraged in assisting people to determine whether or not they are gluten sensitive. It is time to not only recognize, but to treat and further research gluten sensitivity, as unconfirmed environmental factors continue to spread this problem further into the general population.},

   abstract = {The gastrointestinal (GI) microbiota is the collection of microbes which reside in the GI tract and represents the largest source of non-self antigens in the human body. The GI tract functions as a major immunological organ as it must maintain tolerance to commensal and dietary antigens while remaining responsive to pathogenic stimuli. If this balance is disrupted, inappropriate inflammatory processes can result, leading to host cell damage and/or autoimmunity. Evidence suggests that the composition of the intestinal microbiota can influence susceptibility to chronic disease of the intestinal tract including ulcerative colitis, Crohn's disease, celiac disease and irritable bowel syndrome, as well as more systemic diseases such as obesity, type 1 diabetes and type 2 diabetes. Interestingly, a considerable shift in diet has coincided with increased incidence of many of these inflammatory diseases. It was originally believed that the composition of the intestinal microbiota was relatively stable from early childhood; however, recent evidence suggests that diet can cause dysbiosis, an alteration in the composition of the microbiota, which could lead to aberrant immune responses. The role of the microbiota and the potential for diet-induced dysbiosis in inflammatory conditions of the GI tract and systemic diseases will be discussed.},

   abstract = {UNLABELLED: It seems there is a positive correlation between rice content and arsenic level in foods. This is of extraordinary importance for infants below 1 y of age because their diet is very limited and in some cases is highly dependent on rice-based products; this is particularly true for infants with the celiac disease because they have no other option than consume gluten-free products, such as rice or corn. Arsenic contents were significantly higher (P < 0.001) in gluten-free infant rice (0.057 mg kg(-)(1)) than in products with gluten, based on a mixture of cereals (0.024 mg kg(-)(1)). Besides, especial precaution must be taken when preparing rice-based products at home, because arsenic content in Spanish rice was high, with levels being above 0.3 mg kg(-)(1) in some cases. PRACTICAL APPLICATION: From the data presented in this manuscript, it seems imperative that legislation on maximum residues of arsenic in food should be available as soon as possible to protect consumers worldwide. Research is needed to identify or breed rice cultivars with low accumulation of arsenic in the grain; otherwise the rice percentage in infant foods should be reduced.},

   abstract = {UNLABELLED: Violation of reproductive function in patients with celiac disease can manifest as delayed puberty, infertility, amenorrhea, premature menopause, spontaneous abortion, low birth weight. The aim of the study was to establish the frequency and nature of reproductive function violation in patients with CD in the Russian Federation. MATERIALS AND METHODS: The study included 132 women (average age 38,5 +/- 1,17 years) with CD observed in CSRIG in the period from 2000 to 2010. Comparison group consisted 105 women (average age 38,7 +/- 1,6 years) with predominantly functional bowel disorders (irritable bowel syndrome, functional constipation, functional bloating, inert colon). Were took into account information regarding obstetric history, physical and laboratory signs of malabsorption syndrome (MS) study of antibodies to alpha-gliadin immunoglobulin (IG) A class (AGA) and tissue transglutaminase (AtTG). RESULTS: The average age of onset of menses was 14,3 +/- 1,4 years, and in the control group - 13,0 +/- 1,3 years (p > 0.05), half of patients with C (43.9%) had menstruation begun at age 15 years and older, while 7.6% of the women--aged 17 and older. In the comparison group menses beginning after 15 years was only at 13.3% of women. In 61.3% of patients with CD was irregular menstrual cycle while in the comparison group such violations were noted in 13.3% (p < 0.001). Prolonged periods of amenorrhea we observed in women with newly diagnosed GC 3 times more likely than the comparison group: 43.9% and 11.4% respectively (p < 0.01). They also had nearly 3 times more likely to occur spontaneous miscarriage: at 46.9% and 14.3% respectively (p < 0.01). The frequency of dead children birth was about the same: 2.3% and 1.9% respectively (p > 0.05). The frequency of reproductive disorders increased with the growth of the severity of MS. In 43% of women after 6-8 months of strict adherence to a gluten-free diet (GFD) had disappeared amenorrhea and there were regular menses. Three women of childbearing age, strictly abided the GFD and had a history of repeated spontaneous abortion during the year managed to get pregnant and give birth to healthy full-term baby. CONCLUSIONS: Reproductive disorders in women with celiac disease are significantly more likely than at women with functional bowel disease. One of the reasons of reproductive disorders in patients with CD can be malabsorption of necessary nutrients in the small intestine. The presence of reproductive disorders should be considered as a risk factor for celiac disease, so these women should be screened for celiac disease.},

To examine how celiac children and adolescents on gluten-free diet valued their health-related quality of life, and if age and severity of the disease at onset affected the children's self-valuation later in life. We also assessed the parents' valuation of their child's quality of life. Methods. The DISABKIDS Chronic generic measure, short versions for both children and parents, was used on 160 families with celiac disease. A paediatric gastroenterologist classified manifestations of the disease at onset retrospectively. Results. Age or sex did not influence the outcome. Children diagnosed before the age of five scored higher than children diagnosed later. Children diagnosed more than eight years ago scored higher than more recently diagnosed children, and children who had the classical symptoms of the disease at onset scored higher than those who had atypical symptoms or were asymptomatic. The parents valuated their children's quality of life as lower than the children did. Conclusion. Health-related quality of life in treated celiac children and adolescents was influenced by age at diagnosis, disease severity at onset, and years on gluten-free diet. The disagreement between child-parent valuations highlights the importance of letting the children themselves be heard about their perceived quality of life.},

In this study, the celiac IgA-immunoreactivity to zeins from raw or nixtamalized grains, before and after peptic/tryptic digestion was evaluated and their possible immunogenicity was investigated by in silico methods.IgA from some celiac patients with HLA-DQ2 or DQ8 haplotypes recognized two alpha-zeins even after peptic/ tryptic proteolysis. However, digestion affected zeins after denaturation, reduction, and alkylation, used for identification of prolamins as alpha-zein A20 and A30 by MS/MS sequencing. An in silico analysis indicated that other zeins contain similar sequences, or sequences that may bind even better to the HLA-DQ2/DQ8 molecules compared to the already identified ones. Results concur to indicate that relative abundance of these zeins, along with factors affecting their resistance to proteolysis, may be of paramount clinical relevance, and the use of maize in the formulation and preparation of gluten-free foods must be reevaluated in some cases of celiac disease.},

These seemingly distinct medical entities curiously share many common epidemiological, psychosocial, and pathophysiological similarities. Considerable evidence is emerging to support a concept that experiencing significant threatening adverse events creates a state of hypervigilance in the nervous system, which associates with exaggerated response to future threats and episodic attacks of migraine and IBS. While this sensitizing response is generally considered to reside in the central nervous system, it may be possible that the initiation resides in the enteric nervous system as well. What appears to link migraine, IBS, and CD is a disease model of a genetically sensitive nervous system transformed into one that is hypervigilant, and that over time can often develop disabling and pervasive disease.},

   abstract = {The pathogenesis of celiac disease (CD) is associated with polymorphisms in human leukocyte antigen (HLA) genes; however, compelling evidence suggests that additional non-HLA genes are associated with CD and related complications. The present study investigated whether killer cell immunoglobulin-like receptor (KIR)/HLA gene combinations are associated with CD and its clinical complications in the population of northeast Italy. The study included 61 adults affected by CD: 48 patients were at first diagnosis and 13 patients had CD-related complications (8 with refractory CD and 5 with cancer). Controls were 69 blood donors genotyped for KIR and HLA. Several statistically significant differences emerged between CD patients and blood donors. The results herein presented show that susceptibility to CD with refractory disease or cancer is associated with various genotypes including the 2DS2/2DL2+C1, 2DS3, 3DL1, and 2DL5B genes. In addition, the absence of the Bw4 ligand may be a predisposing factor for cancer. These results suggest that a KIR haplotype and HLA ligands may be involved in the susceptibility to important clinical CD complications such as tumors or refractoriness as a result of a gluten-free diet.},

   abstract = {Celiac disease is a multisystemic dietary, gluten-induced autoimmune disorder characterized by the presence of transglutaminase (TG) 2 serum autoantibodies. Distinct autoantibodies targeting members of the TG family (TG2, TG3 and TG6) are found deposited in small-bowel mucosa and in extraintestinal tissues affected by the disease. Serum autoantibodies against other self-antigens also emerge in untreated celiac disease patients. Although villous atrophy and crypt hyperplasia in small-bowel biopsy samples are still the gold standards in diagnostics, celiac disease-specific antibodies are widely used as diagnostic aids. Gluten-induced small-bowel mucosal T-cell response is the cornerstone in the pathogenesis of the disorder, but humoral immunity may also play a central role. This review article is focused on the autoantibodies that occur in the context of celiac disease. The article summarizes the diagnostic utility of different celiac-related antibodies and discusses their roles in the pathogenesis of the disease.},

   abstract = {PURPOSE: This study aimed at investigating the effect of corn, rice and amaranth gluten-free (GF) sourdoughs on the release of nitric oxide (NO) and synthesis of pro-inflammatory cytokines by duodenal mucosa biopsies of eight coeliac disease (CD) patients. METHODS: Selected lactic acid bacteria were used as starters for the manufacture of corn, rice or amaranth sourdoughs. Chemically acidified doughs, without bacterial starters, and doughs started with baker's yeast alone were also manufactured from the same GF matrices. Pepsin-trypsin (PT) digests were produced from all sourdoughs and doughs, and used to assay the rate of recovery of biopsy specimens from eight CD patients at diagnosis. The release of NO and the synthesis of pro-inflammatory cytokines interferon-gamma (IFN-gamma) were assayed. RESULTS: During fermentation, lactic acid bacteria acidified and grew well (ca. log 9.0 CFU/g) on all GF matrices, showing intense proteolysis. Duodenal biopsy specimens still released NO and IFN-gamma when subjected to treatments with basal medium (control), PT-digest from chemically acidified doughs and PT-digest from doughs fermented with baker's yeast alone. On the contrary, the treatment of all the biopsy specimens with PT-digests from all GF matrices subjected to sourdough fermentation significantly decreased the release of NO and the synthesis of IFN-gamma. CONCLUSIONS: During manufacture of GF baked goods, the use of sourdough fermentation could be considered as an adjuvant to enhance the recovery from intestinal inflammation of coeliac patients at the early stage of the gluten-free diet.},

   abstract = {BACKGROUND: Intraepithelial lymphocytes (IEL) are a heterogeneous population of lymphocytes raised in celiac disease (CD), whose role in CD pathogenesis remains to be defined. AIMS: To investigate how the age of diagnosis, diet, and the severity of the histological lesions are related to the changes observed in unconventional IEL populations. METHODS: Prospective analysis of 101 confirmed celiac patients from a single center, including 66 at diagnosis (45 children, 21 adults) and 112 non-celiac controls (12 children, 100 adults). IEL from duodenal biopsies were studied by six-color flow cytometry. The results were analyzed in relationship with age, diet (gluten intake), and histopathology (Marsh type). RESULTS: In comparison with respective age controls, both children and adult patients showed duodenal intraepithelial lymphocytosis with significant differences in every single non-conventional IEL population: CD3+ TCR gammadelta, NK (CD3-, CD16+, CD56+), NKT (CD3+, CD161+, CD56+), and iNKT (CD3+ Valpha24) (P < 0.001 for all). Gluten intake was not only directly associated with severe atrophy, but also with decreased percentages of NK (P = 0.02), NKT (P = 0.003), and iNKT (P = 0.03). Changes in iNKT and gammadelta IEL were more marked in celiac children compared with celiac adults (P = 0.02 and 0.01, respectively). In contrast, increased CD3+ TCR gammadelta were diet- and Marsh grade-independent. CONCLUSIONS: The typical phenotypical profile of intraepithelial lymphocytosis in untreated pediatric and adult celiacs consists of increased CD3+ TCR gammadelta populations with decreased NK, NKT, and iNKT cells. NK, NKT, and iNKT IEL, but not gammadelta IEL, are dynamic populations associated with diet, age, and histopathology.},

   abstract = {It has been reported that interferon (IFN)-gamma-secreting T cells reactive to gluten can be detected in the peripheral blood of individuals with treated coeliac disease (CD) after a short consumption of wheat-containing food. By contrast, very little is known about the reproducibility of this in-vivo procedure in the same patient cohort which underwent two, or more, gluten consumptions. Fourteen coeliac patients in remission consumed wheat bread for 3 days; 13 underwent a second gluten challenge after a wash-out of 3-10 months on a strict gluten-free diet. Immune reactivity to gluten was analysed in peripheral blood by detecting IFN-gamma before and 6 days after commencing a gluten diet. Gliadin-specific IFN-gamma-secreting CD4(+) T cells increased significantly on day 6 of the first challenge. These cells resulted as prevalently human leucocyte antigen (HLA)-DQ restricted and with a phenotype of gut homing, as suggested by the expression of beta7-integrin. Similarly, reactiveness to gliadin was observed after the second wheat consumption, although with an individual variability of responses at each challenge. Our findings confirmed that the short wheat challenge is a non-invasive approach to investigate the gluten-related immune response in peripheral blood of subjects intolerant to gluten. Furthermore, we demonstrated that the in-vivo procedure can be reproduced in the same subject cohort after a gluten wash-out of at least 3 months. Our study has important implications for the application of this procedure to clinical practice.},

   abstract = {Celiac Disease (CD) occurs in patients with Type 1 Diabetes (T1D) ranging the prevalence of 4.4-11.1% versus 0.5% of the general population. The mechanism of association of these two diseases involves a shared genetic background: HLA genotype DR3-DQ2 and DR4-DQ8 are strongly associated with T1D, DR3-DQ2 with CD. The classical severe presentation of CD rarely occurs in T1D patients, but more often patients have few/mild symptoms of CD or are completely asymptomatic (silent CD). In fact diagnosis of CD is regularly performed by means of the screening in T1D patients. The effects of gluten-free diet (GFD) on the growth and T1D metabolic control in CD/T1D patient are controversial. Regarding of the GFD composition, there is a debate on the higher glycaemic index of gluten-free foods respect to gluten-containing foods; furthermore GFD could be poorer of fibers and richer of fat. The adherence to GFD by children with CD-T1D has been reported generally below 50%, lower respect to the 73% of CD patients, a lower compliance being more frequent among asymptomatic patients. The more severe problems of GFD adherence usually occur during adolescence when in GFD non compliant subjects the lowest quality of life is reported. A psychological and educational support should be provided for these patients.},

   abstract = {Dietary olive oil supplementation and more recently, olive oil phenols have been recommended as important therapeutic interventions in preventive medicine. Ole has several pharmacological properties, including antioxidant, anti-inflammatory, antiatherogenic, anticancer, antimicrobial, and antiviral and for these reasons, is becoming an important subject of study in recent years. The aim of this study was to investigate the effects of Ole aglycone on the modulation of the secondary events in mice subjected to intestinal IRI. This was induced in mice by clamping the superior mesenteric artery and the celiac trunk for 30 min, followed by release of the clamp, allowing reperfusion for 1 h. After 60 min of reperfusion, animals were killed for histological examination of the ileum tissue and immunohistochemical localization of proinflammatory cytokines (TNF-alpha and IL-1beta) and adhesion molecules (ICAM-1 and P-sel); moreover, by Western blot analysis, we investigated the activation of NF-kappaB and IkappaBalpha. In addition, we evaluated the apoptosis process, as shown by TUNEL staining and Bax/Bcl-2 expressions. The results obtained by the histological and molecular examinations showed in Ole aglycone-treated mice, a decrease of inflammation and apoptosis pathway versus SAO-shocked mice. In conclusion, we propose that the olive oil compounds, in particular, the Ole aglycone, could represent a possible treatment against secondary events of intestinal IRI.},

   abstract = {OBJECTIVES: The diagnosis of celiac disease (CD) is based on the histological identification of gluten-sensitive enteropathy and detection of anti-tissue transglutaminase antibodies (tTGA) and/or endomysial antibodies. Serial measurements of tTGA are now recommended as a follow-up strategy to monitor compliance with a gluten-free diet (GFD). We evaluated the performances of a quantitative radiobinding assay (RBA) of tTGA immunoglobulin A at diagnosis and during monitoring of GFD in pediatric CD. METHODS: Eighty children with confirmed CD were selected. Levels of serum tTGA measured by RBA and a commercial enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay (ELISA) were compared at diagnosis. The relation between RBA-tTGA levels and histological damage was analyzed, as well as the time course of tTGA clearance during GFD. RESULTS: Both RBA and ELISA showed high sensitivity and specificity for tTGA detection at diagnosis. There was no relation between RBA-tTGA levels at diagnosis and severity of mucosal damage. Upon initiation of GFD, the rate of RBA-tTGA positivity declined slower than that of endomysial antibodies positivity, with >50% of the children still tTGA positive at year 5; however, tTGA levels decreased rapidly during the first year of GFD and more slowly thereafter. Children who seroreverted had lower tTGA levels at diagnosis (2080+/-1554 cpm) than those who remained tTGA positive throughout follow-up (3688+/-1435 cpm). CONCLUSIONS: The high sensitivity of RBA is likely responsible for higher tTGA positivity rates during GFD than previously reported with ELISA. A decreasing trend for tTGA levels may represent a better surrogate marker of compliance with GFD than absolute normal tTGA levels.},

The objectives of this study were to (1) study the occurrence of fumonisins in Catalonia (north-eastern region of Spain) and (2) assess the exposure of the Catalonian population to these mycotoxins. Contamination data was provided by a wide survey where 928 individual samples were pooled to analyse 370 composite samples. Fumonisins were extracted and purified using immunoaffinity columns and determined by HPLC with fluorescence detection. The raw consumption data came from a nutritional study specifically designed to assess the dietary intake of the main foodstuffs related to fumonisin contamination for all population age groups. In addition, two specific groups were selected with respect to maize consumption: immigrants and celiac sufferers. Contamination and consumption data were combined by simulation using an essentially parametric-parametric (P-P) method. The P-P method draws sampling values from distribution functions fitted to consumption and contamination datasets. Moreover, to quantify the accuracy and reliability of the statistical estimates, we built related confidence intervals using a Pseudo-Parametric bootstrap method. The results of this study show that fumonisins are commonly found in some commodities on the Catalonian market, such as beer, corn snacks and ethnic foods; however, the values were well below the permitted maximum EU levels. The most exposed group were infants followed by immigrants but, in all cases, they were below the TDI of 2 microg/kg bw/day.},

Thus, two sub-objectives were considered: (1) to assess the occurrence of AFs in food marketed in Catalonia, and (2) to assess the consumption of those foods susceptible to AFs contamination by Catalonian population. AFs were analysed in a total of 603 samples considering special commodities as free-gluten, ethnic or baby foods. Analytical method consisted of an extraction and clean-up of aflatoxins step using immunoaffinity columns, and determination by HPLC with post-column photochemical derivatization and fluorescence detection. Food dietary intake was assessed using a food frequency questionnaire, administered to 1387 individuals by trained interviewers. Contamination and consumption raw datasets were combined by means of a direct method and a stochastic method, building the pseudo-parametric bootstrap confidence intervals of the main outputs. Margins of exposure (MoE) and cancer incidence were estimated for the different collectives. The highest percentages of positive samples were found in red pepper, pistachios and peanuts. Considering our results, the most exposed group was the celiac sufferer collective followed by the adolescents; however health concern should not be expected in the population groups.},

   abstract = {The effect of adding increasing levels of prebiotic inulin-type fructans (ITFs) (0, 4, 8, 10 and 12%) on the sensory and nutritional quality of gluten-free bread (GFB) was assessed. ITFs can provide structure and gas retention during baking, thus improving GFB quality by yielding better specific volume, softer crumb, improved crust and crumb browning with enhanced sensory acceptance. During baking, approximately one-third of the ITFs was lost. The addition of 12% ITFs to the basic formulation is required in order to obtain GFB enriched with 8% ITFs (4 g of fructans per 50 g bread serving size), levels that can provide health benefits. 12% ITFs-addition level decreased GFB glycemic index (from 71 to 48) and glycemic load (from 12 to 8). Prebiotic ITFs are a promising improver for GFB that can provide nutritional (11% dietary fiber content, low glycemic response) and functional benefits to patients with celiac disease, since ITFs are prebiotic ingredients that can also increase calcium absorption.},

   abstract = {MiRNAs play a relevant role in regulating gene expression in a variety of physiological and pathological conditions including autoimmune disorders. MiRNAs are also important in the differentiation and function of the mouse intestinal epithelium. Our study was aimed to look for miRNA-based modulation of gene expression in celiac small intestine, and particularly for genes involved in cell intestinal differentiation/proliferation mechanisms. A cohort of 40 children (20 with active CD, 9 on a gluten-free diet (GFD), and 11 controls), were recruited at the Paediatrics Department (University of Naples Federico II). The expression of 365 human miRNAs was quantified by TaqMan low-density arrays. We used bioinformatics to predict putative target genes of miRNAs and to select biological pathways. The presence of NOTCH1, HES1, KLF4, MUC-2, Ki67 and beta-catenin proteins in the small intestine of CD and control children was tested by immunohistochemistry. The expression of about 20% of the miRNAs tested differed between CD and control children. We found that high miR-449a levels targeted and reduced both NOTCH1 and KLF4 in HEK-293 cells. NOTCH1, KLF4 signals and the number of goblet cells were lower in small intestine of children with active CD and in those on a GFD than in controls, whereas more nuclear beta-catenin staining, as a sign of the WNT pathway activation, and more Ki67 staining, as sign of proliferation, were present in crypts from CD patients than in controls. In conclusion we first demonstrate a miRNA mediated gene regulation in small intestine of CD patients. We also highlighted a reduced NOTCH1 pathway in our patients, irrespective of whether the disease was active or not. We suggest that NOTCH pathway could be constitutively altered in the celiac small intestine and could drive the increased proliferation and the decreased differentiation of intestinal cells towards the secretory goblet cell lineage.},

   abstract = {BACKGROUND: Celiac disease (CD) is an intestinal inflammatory condition that develops in genetically susceptible individuals after exposure to dietary wheat gliadin. The role of post-translational modifications of gliadin catalyzed by tissue transglutaminase (tTG) seems to play a crucial role in CD. However, it remains to be established how and where tTG is activated in vivo. We have investigated whether gliadin peptides modulate intracellular Ca(2+) homeostasis and tTG activity. METHODS/PRINCIPAL FINDINGS: We studied Ca(2+) homeostasis in Caco-2 cells by single cell microfluorimetry. Under our conditions, A-gliadin peptides 31-43 and 57-68 rapidly mobilized Ca(2+) from intracellular stores. Specifically, peptide 31-43 mobilized Ca(2+) from the endoplasmic reticulum (ER) and mitochondria, whereas peptide 57-68 mobilized Ca(2+) only from mitochondria. We also found that gliadin peptide-induced Ca(2+) mobilization activates the enzymatic function of intracellular tTG as revealed by in situ tTG activity using the tTG substrate pentylamine-biotin. Moreover, we demonstrate that peptide 31-43, but not peptide 57-68, induces an increase of tTG expression. Finally, we monitored the expression of glucose-regulated protein-78 and of CCAAT/enhancer binding protein-homologous protein, which are two biochemical markers of ER-stress, by real-time RT-PCR and western blot. We found that chronic administration of peptide 31-43, but not of peptide 57-68, induces the expression of both genes. CONCLUSIONS: By inducing Ca(2+) mobilization from the ER, peptide 31-43 could promote an ER-stress pathway that may be relevant in CD pathogenesis. Furthermore, peptides 31-43 and 57-68, by activating intracellular tTG, could alter inflammatory key regulators, and induce deamidation of immunogenic peptides and gliadin-tTG crosslinking in enterocytes and specialized antigen-presenting cells.},

   abstract = {BACKGROUND: Natural or induced variations in the noxiousness of gluten proteins for celiac disease (CD) patients are currently being investigated for their potential in breeding wheat crops with reduced toxicity. AIMS: We evaluated the bread wheat line C173 for its effects on the in vitro-grown duodenal mucosa of CD patients. METHODS: In vitro-grown duodenal mucosa biopsies of 19 CD patients on a gluten-free diet were exposed to peptic/tryptic-digested prolamins from bread wheat line C173 lacking gliadin-glutenin subunits, analyzed for morphology, cytokine and anti-tTG antibody production, and compared with mucosa biopsies exposed to prolamins from wild-type cv. San Pastore. RESULTS: Duodenal mucosa biopsies exposed to prolamins from C173 and San Pastore released higher amounts of IFN-gamma, IL-2, IL-10 and anti-tTG antibodies in the culture medium than untreated controls. The line C173 differed from cv. San Pastore as it did not produce negative effects on enterocyte height, suggesting that manipulating prolamin composition can affect innate immune responses of CD mucosa to wheat gluten. CONCLUSIONS: Our data demonstrated that this gliadin-deficient wheat has a lower direct toxicity but activates an immunologic reaction of the duodenal mucosa like that of the common wheat species.},

AIM: To evaluate the diagnostic accuracy of antiendomysium (EmA) assay in the culture medium of intestinal biopsies for CD diagnosis. PATIENTS AND METHODS: The clinical charts of 418 patients with CD and 705 non-CD controls who had all undergone EmA assay in the culture medium were reviewed. RESULTS: EmA assay in the culture medium had a higher sensitivity (98 vs. 80%) and specificity (99 vs. 95%) than serum EmA/antibodies to tissue transglutaminase (anti-tTG) assay. All patients with CD who were tested as false-negatives for serum EmA and/or anti-tTG (32 adults and 39 children) carried the human leukocyte antigen alleles associated to CD. Furthermore, during the follow-up, four patients with negative-serum EmA/anti-tTG, normal villi architecture, and positive-EmAs in the culture medium, developed villous atrophy and underwent gluten-free diet with consequent resolution of the symptoms and complete intestinal histology recovery. CONCLUSION: EmA assay in the culture medium should be included in the diagnostic criteria for CD diagnosis in 'seronegative' patients.},

Organ-specific gluten reaction involves immune response toward other transglutaminase (TG) isoforms including tTG3 (expressed in the skin, leading to dermatitis herpetiformis) and tTG6 (expressed in the brain, causing gluten ataxia). This analysis focuses on tTG6 antibodies, which have never been studied before in schizophrenia (SZ) and its relationships to tTG2 and to antigliadin antibodies. We previously showed an increased prevalence of tTG2 antibodies in gluten sensitive SZ patients compared with healthy controls (HC) that was not paralleled by an increased prevalence of antiendomysial antibody. To elucidate this discrepancy, we examined those tTG2 positive SZ patients for the presence of tTG6 antibody. We also searched for tTG6 antibodies in our sample of antigliadin (AGA) positive and AGA and tTG2 negative SZ patients. Seventy-four tTG2 positive SZ patients were compared with 148 age and gender-matched HC. Of the 74 tTG2 positive SZ patients, 16 were positive for tTG6 IgA for a prevalence of 22%. Only 4 HC were positive for tTG6 IgA for a prevalence of 2.7%. Among the AGA positive SZ patients, the prevalence of tTG6 IgA was 21.3% while 13.1% of the AGA and tTG2 negative SZ patients were positive for tTG6 IgA. The HC had a prevalence of 6%. Our results indicate a higher prevalence of tTG6 antibodies in SZ that may represent a biomarker useful to identify SZ patients who would benefit from a gluten-free diet.},

   abstract = {INTRODUCTION: Retrospective studies and case reports suggest an association between coeliac disease and impaired cognitive function. AIM: To evaluate functional and cognitive performances in coeliac disease vs. control patients older than 65 years. METHOD: Eighteen coeliac disease patients (75+/-4 years, group A) on gluten free diet since 5.5+/-3 years and 18 age-sex matched controls (76+/-4 years, group B) were studied using a battery of neuropsychological tests. Results of functional and cognitive tests are expressed as "row scores" and as "equivalent scores" by relating "raw scores" to reference rank categories. RESULTS: Barthel Index of functional performance was similar in the 2 groups. "Raw score" was significantly lower in coeliac disease than controls for Mini Mental Test Examination (p=0.02), Trail Making Test (p=0.001), Semantic Fluency (p=0.03), Digit Symbol Test (p=0.007), Ideo-motor apraxia (p<0.001) and Bucco-facial apraxia (p<0.002). "Equivalent score" was also lower in coeliac disease than controls for Semantic memory (p<0.01) and for Ideo-motor apraxia (p=0.007). CONCLUSION: Cognitive performance is worse in elderly coeliac disease than control patients, despite prolonged gluten avoidance in coeliacs. Awareness on the increasing phenomenon of late-onset coeliac disease is important to minimize diagnostic delay and prolonged exposure to gluten that may adversely and irreversibly affect cognitive function.},

DESIGN: Retrospective retrieval of information prospectively entered into a structured database. SETTING: CD clinic, University and Spedali Civili, Brescia, Italy. PARTICIPANTS: Two cohorts were identified (older, Group A, n = 59, >65; younger, Group B, n = 1,166, 18-64), and Group B was subgrouped (B1, n = 600, 18-34; B2, n = 440, 35-49; and B3, n = 26, 50-64). MEASUREMENTS: Clinical, serological, and histological characteristics of individuals with CD studied before and during a GFD. RESULTS: At presentation, weight loss (37% vs 21%, P = .005) and dyspepsia (22% vs 12%, P = .04) were more frequent in older than younger participants. Incidence at diagnosis of non-Hodgkin's lymphoma (NHL) was much higher in older (5%) than younger participants (0.3%, P = .003). Prevalence of osteoporosis was 67% in older and 14% in younger male participants and 70% in older and 9% in younger female participants ( P < .001). During treatment, adherence to a GFD was 90%, normal villous structure was reconstituted, and t-transglutaminase antibodies were negative in 80% of older and younger participants. Lumbar-sacral and femoral T scores increased significantly during a GFD in pooled results of 48 older and younger participants studied before and during GFD. CONCLUSION: NHL is already present at CD diagnosis in most cases in individuals aged 50 and older, emphasizing the importance of early diagnosis. Older and younger individuals are equally adherent and equally benefit from a GFD, indicating that older age is not a barrier to dietary treatment.},

   abstract = {UNLABELLED: Celiac disease (CD) is an enteric disease caused by dietary gluten in individuals with genetic predisposition. One of the clinical manifestations of CD is the peripheral arthritis that may simulate RA. OBJECTIVE: To determine the frequency of anti-gliadin (aGL), anti-tissue transglutaminase (aTGT) and ultra purified anti-gliadin (AGLU) antibodies in patients with RA. METHODS: Cross-sectional study. We included consecutive patients diagnosed as RA (ACR). Demographic and clinical data was registered by direct interview and serum levels of aGL, aTGT y aGLU were determined using ELISA. RESULTS: Eighty-five RA patients were included; 87% were women. Mean age was 44+/-12 years, mean disease duration 12 +/-9 years. aGL IgG antibodies were positive in 16 patients, IgA aGL antibodies in 29 patients, aGLU in 14 patients and only one patient had aTGT. CONCLUSIONS: It is possible that CD may be the correct diagnosis in a patient with polyarthritis, even if the patient meets the ACR criteria for RA. In other words, CD should be considered among the differential diagnoses in a patient with poly-arthritis.},

   abstract = {BACKGROUND: This study explores how a child's coeliac disease (CD) influences the daily life of families because such knowledge can enhance the understanding of how to support family adjustment to a gluten-free diet (GFD). METHODS: We used an interpretative phenomenological approach, interviewing 20 parents of 14 children diagnosed with CD about their individual thoughts and beliefs. RESULTS: Once parents know, especially when their children are young, they seem to have the capacity to rapidly adapt to GFD, mainly because they notice how quickly their children recover. Parents may have problems controlling how staff at daycare and at school complies with their information about a GFD. CONCLUSIONS: To ensure that children with CD are given a GFD at daycare and school, it is necessary for municipalities to educate staff about the disease and to give them the prerequisites for serving a GFD. There is also a need of early identification of children who may have CD. When parents express their worries, not just at the hospital but also at the well-baby clinic and primary care units, supporting treatment could prevent children from suffering from inappropriate food.},

The aim of this study was to determine the prevalence of celiac disease in patients with iron deficiency anemia of obscure origin. MATERIALS AND METHODS: Eighty-four patients with the diagnosis of iron deficiency anemia of obscure origin were included in the study. Histologic findings for celiac disease were investigated in biopsy specimens taken from the second part of the duodenum of all subjects. Patients were also screened using anti-endomysial and anti-gliadin antibodies. The diagnosis of celiac disease was confirmed by both serological positivity and histopathological findings. RESULTS: In 6 of 84 patients (7.14%), both serologic and histopathologic findings were correlated with celiac disease. After six months under a gluten-free diet, their mean hemoglobin levels increased from 10.3 +/- 0.64 to 12.97 +/- 1.48 g/dl (p=0.002). One patient with positive serology for celiac disease but normal duodenal mucosal biopsies also improved clinically after a gluten-free diet at the end of the follow-up and was considered as celiac disease. Six of these 7 celiac disease patients (85.7%) were premenopausal women, with a mean age of 37.5 +/- 8.45 years. CONCLUSIONS: Clinicians should consider celiac disease as a possible cause of anemia in all patients with iron deficiency anemia of obscure origin, even in menstruating women. Serologic screening tests should be performed in premenopausal women with iron deficiency anemia, especially when anemia is refractory to oral iron treatment.},

Some physical, chemical, rheological, mechanical and fluidity properties, as well as the color of these mixtures for a period of conservation of 90 days were evaluated. At the end of the storage, the sweet mixture turned out to be of "little flow" and the dessert mixture changed from "little flow" to "easy flow". Viscosity for the dessert mixture, with its two types of dilutions, water and milk, presented a behavior of pseudoplastic fluid. It was possible to guess that the time of shelf life of the mixtures would be of 9 months before achieving the rancidity limit (10 mEq of oxigen/kg of fat, which would disqualify the product for consumption). The CIEL*a*b* color coordinates did not show significant differences keeping the colour in "a beige" tonality.},

In the present work, the percentage composition of each flour in the mixture was determined by means of Linear Programming by means of the Solver form from the Excel spreadsheet. Prolamines were determined in the quinua and lupin flours by the ELISA test and the HPLC technique was used in both products obtained called "sweet mix" and "dessert mix", to define the quantity of amino acids with the purpose of providing around the 15% of the proteins required in the day. The flour mixtures selected as optimum, sweet mix, suitable for the preparation of sweet pancakes, as well as for the dessert mix, that by addition of water or milk produce a semi solid dessert, were evaluated after three months of storage, being acceptable their microbiological, bromatological and sensorial requirements, corroborating the results with the good acceptance of the products, prepared from the formulated mixtures, by the children of two Day Care centers of the City of Antofagasta-Chile.},

Rifaximin has been reported to improve symptoms in non-controlled trials. AIMS: To determine the effect of rifaximin on gastrointestinal symptoms and lactulose-hydrogen breath tests in patients with poorly responsive celiac disease. METHODS: A single-center, double-blind, randomized, controlled trial of patients with biopsy-proven celiac disease and persistent gastrointestinal symptoms despite a GFD was conducted. Patients were randomized to placebo (n = 25) or rifaximin (n = 25) 1,200 mg daily for 10 days. They completed the Gastrointestinal Symptom Rating Scale (GSRS) and underwent lactulose-hydrogen breath tests at weeks 0, 2, and 12. An abnormal breath test was defined as: (1) a rise in hydrogen of >/=20 parts per million (ppm) within 100 min, or (2) two peaks >/=20 ppm over baseline. RESULTS: GSRS scores were unaffected by treatment with rifaximin, regardless of baseline breath tests. In a multivariable regression model, the duration of patients' gastrointestinal symptoms significantly predicted their overall GSRS scores (estimate 0.029, p < 0.006). According to criteria 1 and 2, respectively, SIBO was present in 55 and 8% of patients at baseline, intermittently present in 28 and 20% given placebo, and 28 and 12% given rifaximin. There was no difference in the prevalence of SIBO between placebo and treatment groups at weeks 2 and 12. CONCLUSIONS: Rifaximin does not improve patients' reporting of gastrointestinal symptoms and hydrogen breath tests do not reliably identify who will respond to antibiotic therapy.},

METHODS: We report a single center case series of 8 patients with suspected celiac disease who were diagnosed by VCE. RESULTS: EGD and biopsy had been performed in 4 patients resulting in a negative biopsy, declined by 2, and contraindicated in 2 due to hemophilia and von Willebrand disease. In all patients, mucosal changes of scalloping, mucosal mosaicism and reduced folds were seen in either the duodenum or jejunum on VCE. Follow-up in 7 patients demonstrated improvement in either their serological abnormalities or their presenting clinical features on a gluten-free diet. CONCLUSIONS: Our case series demonstrates that VCE and the visualization of the characteristic mucosal changes of villous atrophy may replace biopsy as the mode of diagnosis when EGD is either declined or contraindicated, or when duodenal biopsies are negative and there remains a high index of suspicion. Further study is needed to clarify the role and cost of diagnosing celiac disease with VCE.},

OBJECTIVE: To determine the prevalence of celiac disease in siblings of patients with confirmed celiac disease. METHODS: Siblings of confirmed celiac disease patients in our center were identified and enrolled in this study. Their serum immunoglobulin A and tissue transglutaminase antibody-enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay (anti-tissue transglutaminase, immunoglobulin A, and immunoglobulin G) were measured and multiple endoscopic duodenal biopsy specimens were obtained with parental consensus. Celiac disease was confirmed by observation of characteristic histological changes. RESULTS: A total of 49 children (male, 29; female, 20; age, 2-16 years) with confirmed celiac disease in a pediatric gastroenterology ward were studied from 1999 to 2006. We found 30 siblings (female, 16) all shared in both parents. The only measurement available was for immunoglobulin A tissue transglutaminase antibody. A duodenal biopsy was performed in all 30 siblings. Clinical findings such as abdominal pain, fatigue, growth retardation and diarrhea were found in 53.3% of the completely studied siblings, and positive serology without histological changes was identified in four cases. Both serology and biopsy (confirmed new cases) were positive in 2 of the 30 siblings. CONCLUSION: High prevalence of celiac disease among siblings of patients with confirmed celiac disease necessitates serologic screening (and confirmatory biopsy if indicated) in families having celiac disease. It is advantageous to diagnose the disease as soon as possible because early diagnosis and diet intervention may prevent serious complications such as growth retardation, short stature, chronic diarrhea, and malignancy.},

   abstract = {GOALS: To determine the prevalence and significance of immunoglobulin A (IgA) deficiency and partial deficiency in patients with celiac disease (CD). BACKGROUND: Selective IgA deficiency is a common primary immunoglobulin deficiency and has a higher prevalence in patients with CD. The prevalence and significance of IgA deficiency and partial deficiency in patients with CD in the United States has not previously been examined. STUDY: A retrospective, cohort study of 1498 adults and 317 children seen in a University Medical Center was conducted. RESULTS: There were 26 patients (22 adults, 4 children) with CD who were IgA deficient and 11 (9 adults, 2 children) with CD who were partially IgA deficient. The prevalence of IgA deficiency/partial deficiency was similar among adults and children (2.1% and 1.9%, respectively, P=0.99). Among adults, concomitant autoimmune disease was present in 29% of IgA-deficient/partially deficient patients versus 12% of CD patients with normal IgA levels (P=0.0081). All 4 IgA-deficient patients who had persistently positive IgG celiac serologies while adherent to a gluten-free diet and were rebiopsied had a normal repeat biopsy. Both positive tissue transglutaminase IgG and antigliadin IgG were found in these patients. CONCLUSIONS: Selective IgA deficiency/partial deficiency is present in 2% of CD patients at this referral center and is equally prevalent among adults and children. IgA-deficient/partially deficient adults had a higher prevalence of concomitant autoimmune disease than those without IgA deficiency. In patients who are IgA deficient, IgG serologies may be persistently elevated despite histologic recovery.},

   abstract = {BACKGROUND: In Czech population celiac disease is diagnosed infrequently and on the contrary frequently too late. AIM: The present quality of diagnostics, therapy, follow-up and relation of celiacs to causal therapy has been evaluated. METHODS: A structured questionnaire was offered to celiacs followed at different out-patient departments (medicine, gastroenterology, dermatology, hematology, and endocrinology) of one institution (Central Military Hospital Prague) in the years 2000-2010. The following topics were analyzed: the health care provided to probands before the diagnosis of celiac disease (number and speciality of involved physicians, symptoms and suggested conditions), methods of celiac disease diagnosis, screening of the disease in first degree relatives, compliance of gluten-free diet and its limiting factors. RESULTS: 102 (77.3%) out of 132 distributed questionnaires were evaluated. The diagnosis of celiac disease remains a late issue. 36.8% of celiac patients were diagnosed after a period of more than 10 years of symptoms. Diarrhea has been frequently combined with extraintestinal symptoms (anemia, decreased body mass, depression, and osteoporosis). Gluten-free diet is an expensive dietary regimen and its adherence brings various restrictions to celiacs in every-day life. CONCLUSION: The present state of celiac disease diagnostics and follow-up requires interdisciplinary cooperation and increased interest of health and social care institutions including their leading representatives.},

   abstract = {OBJECTIVES: The role of T lymphocytes in the pathogenesis of Celiac disease (CD) is well established. However, the mechanisms of T-cell involvement remain elusive. Little is known on the distribution of T subpopulations: T-regulatory (Treg), Th17, CD103, and CD62L cells at disease onset and after gluten-free diet (GFD). We investigated the involvement of several T subpopulations in the pathogenesis of CD. METHODS: We studied T cells both in the peripheral blood (PB) and the tissue-infiltrating lymphocytes (TILs) from the mucosa of 14 CD patients at presentation and after a GFD, vs. 12 controls. RESULTS: Our results extend the involvement of Treg, Th1, and Th17 cells in active CD inflammation both in the PB and at the TILs. At baseline, Tregs, Th1, and Th17 cells are significantly higher in active CD patients in TILs and PB. They decreased after diet. Moreover, CD62L+ TILs were increased at diagnosis as compared with GFD patients. CONCLUSIONS: Our data show significant modifications of the above-mentioned subpopulations both in the PB and TILs. The increase of suppressive Tregs in active CD both in the PB and TILs is intriguing. T lymphocytes are known to have a crucial role in the pathogenesis of CD. We have shown that gluten trigger results in systemic recruitment of T lymphocytes, the unbalance between pro-inflammatory and anti-inflammatory populations and the increase of CD62L+ T cells in TILs. Our results delineate a more complete picture of T-cell subsets in active vs. GFD disease. Our data of T-cell subpopulations, combined with known data on cytokine production, support the concept that duodenal micro-environment acts as an immunological niche and this recognition may have an important role in the diagnosis, prognosis and therapeutical approach of CD.},

   abstract = {BACKGROUND AND AIMS: Celiac disease (CD) is a chronic inflammatory disorder of the small intestine that is induced by dietary wheat gluten proteins (gliadins) in genetically predisposed individuals. The overgrowth of potentially pathogenic bacteria and infections has been suggested to contribute to CD pathogenesis. We aimed to study the effects of gliadin and various intestinal bacterial strains on mucosal barrier integrity, gliadin translocation, and cytokine production. METHODOLOGY/PRINCIPAL FINDINGS: Changes in gut mucosa were assessed in the intestinal loops of inbred Wistar-AVN rats that were reared under germ-free conditions in the presence of various intestinal bacteria (enterobacteria and bifidobacteria isolated from CD patients and healthy children, respectively) and CD-triggering agents (gliadin and IFN-gamma) by histology, scanning electron microscopy, immunofluorescence, and a rat cytokine antibody array. Adhesion of the bacterial strains to the IEC-6 rat cell line was evaluated in vitro. Gliadin fragments alone or together with the proinflammatory cytokine interferon (IFN)-gamma significantly decreased the number of goblet cells in the small intestine; this effect was more pronounced in the presence of Escherichia coli CBL2 and Shigella CBD8. Shigella CBD8 and IFN-gamma induced the highest mucin secretion and greatest impairment in tight junctions and, consequently, translocation of gliadin fragments into the lamina propria. Shigella CBD8 and E. coli CBL2 strongly adhered to IEC-6 epithelial cells. The number of goblet cells in small intestine increased by the simultaneous incubation of Bifidobacterium bifidum IATA-ES2 with gliadin, IFN-gamma and enterobacteria. B. bifidum IATA-ES2 also enhanced the production of chemotactic factors and inhibitors of metalloproteinases, which can contribute to gut mucosal protection. CONCLUSIONS: Our results suggest that the composition of the intestinal microbiota affects the permeability of the intestinal mucosa and, consequently, could be involved in the early stages of CD pathogenesis.},

   abstract = {OBJECTIVE: A complete examination of the small intestine is possible by video capsule endoscopy (VCE). The aim of this study was to evaluate current indications for performing VCE in celiac disease. METHODS: In all 84 celiac disease patients on a gluten-free diet who had undergone VCE were enrolled at five centers in Europe. The indications, findings and clinical impact of VCE were recorded by a structured questionnaire. VCE was also carried out in 34 consecutive patients with untreated celiac disease (controls) in another center. RESULTS: Out of the 84 patients, 34 had overt symptoms and small intestinal histology compatible with refractory celiac disease. VCE was normal in 9 patients, and 7 had only proximal and one distal atrophy, 14 had intestinal ulcer and 2 an intestinal stricture. VCE was used in the adjustment of immunosuppressive treatment in 9 patients. In the remaining 50 patients, a VCE was performed because of less severe symptoms, 31 of which had an earlier histological recovery. The VCE showed proximal small bowel atrophy in 21 and distal atrophy in 3 patients, and 3 ulcers were seen. In this group the patients received mainly advice with a view to achieving better dietary compliance. Of the 34 newly detected celiac patients, 4 were normal, 27 proximal and 3 had distal small intestinal atrophy in the VCE. CONCLUSIONS: VCE has a definite impact on the management of refractory sprue. In the remaining patients with established celiac disease, the procedure plays a more limited role.},

   abstract = {In the present paper, the controversial hypothesis suggesting ancient grains might show lower immunogenic properties and therefore the possibility to introduce them in the diet of wheat-sensitive people, including celiac patients, was investigated. The immunogenic potential of the ancient durum wheats Graziella Ra and Kamut was studied by comparison to the durum accessions Cappelli, Flaminio, Grazia and Svevo. Experiments were carried out with two monoclonal antibodies (mAbs) raised against alpha-gliadin peptides p31-49 and p56-75 (the latter containing the overlapping DQ2-Glia-alpha1 and DQ2-Glia-alpha2 epitopes), toxic for celiac patients. For all accessions, a few alpha-gliadin alleles were also cloned, sequenced and translated into aminoacid sequences. Several aminoacid substitutions or deletions were detected in p31-49, DQ2-Glia-alpha1 and DQ2-Glia-alpha2 epitopes, nevertheless, ELISA constantly showed antibody-antigen positive reactions which led us to suggest that mAbs binding was not apparently affected by polymorphisms. Moreover, a few substitutions were also observed in DQ2-Glia-alpha3 and DQ8-Glia-alpha1 epitopes. Although some DQ2-Glia-alpha1 and DQ2-Glia-alpha2 variants evidenced herein were previously reported to have a diminished or abolished T cell stimulatory capacity, present results cannot confirm that ancient durum wheats would be less CD-toxic. In conclusion, we strongly advice celiac patients from consuming ancient wheats including Graziella Ra or Kamut.},

   abstract = {BACKGROUND AND AIMS: Coeliac disease (CD) is triggered by an abnormal reaction to gluten. Peptides resulting from partially digested gluten of wheat, barley or rye cause inflammation of the small intestinal mucosa. Previous contradictory studies suggest that oats may trigger the abnormal immunological response in patients with CD. Monoclonal antibodies (moAbs) against the main immunotoxic 33-mer peptide (A1 and G12) react strongly against wheat, barley and rye but have less reactivity against oats. The stated aim of this study is to test whether this observed reactivity could be related to the potential toxicity of oats for patients with CD. METHODS: In the present study, different oat varieties, controlled for their purity and by their distinct protein pattern, were used to examine differences in moAb G12 recognition by ELISA and western blot. Immunogenicity of oat varieties was determined by 33-mer concentration, T cell proliferation and interferon gamma production. RESULTS: Three groups of oat cultivars reacting differently against moAb G12 could be distinguished: a group with considerable affinity, a group showing slight reactivity and a third with no detectable reactivity. The immunogenicity of the three types of oats as well as that of a positive and negative control was determined with isolated peripheral blood mononuclear T cells from patients with CD by measurement of cell proliferation and interferon gamma release. A direct correlation of the reactivity with G12 and the immunogenicity of the different prolamins was observed. CONCLUSIONS: The results showed that the reactivity of the moAb G12 is proportional to the potential immunotoxicity of the cereal cultivar. These differences may explain the different clinical responses observed in patients suffering from CD and open up a means to identify immunologically safe oat cultivars, which could be used to enrich a gluten-free diet.},

   abstract = {SCOPE: The only treatment available for coeliac disease (CD) is a strict diet in which the intake of wheat, barley, rye, or oats is avoided. Barley is a major cereal crop, grown mainly for its use in brewing, and it has high nutritional value. The identification of varieties with a reduced toxicity profile may contribute to improve the diet, the quality of life and health of CD patients. METHODS AND RESULTS: Searching for harmless barleys, we investigated accessions of malting and wild barley, used for developing new cultivated cereals. The CD toxicity profile of barleys was screened using G12 antibody and cell proliferation and IFN-gamma release from peripheral blood mononuclear cells and intestinal biopsies from CD patients. We found a direct correlation between the reactivity with G12 and the immunogenicity of the different barleys. CONCLUSION: The malting barleys were less immunogenic, with reduced levels of toxic gluten, and were possibly less harmful to CD patients. Our findings could raise the prospect of breeding barley species with low levels of harmful gluten, and the attractive goal of developing nontoxic barley cultivars, always taking into account the Codex standard for foods for special dietary use for persons intolerant to gluten.},

The gluten remaining after processes of malting and brewing is mostly hydrolyzed, which makes practical evaluation of the immunotoxicity of the gluten pools challenging. RESULTS: We analyzed the presence of gluten peptides equivalent to the major immunotoxic protease-resistant gliadin 33-mer in 100 Belgium beers, using monoclonal antibodies (G12/A1). Immunochromatographic strips and enzyme-linked immonosorbent assay G12/A1 methods estimated at least 20 ppm gluten equivalents in 90 beers and gluten-free in 10 beers. The G12/A1 reactivity of beer high-performance liquid chromatographic fractions correlated to the presence of T-cell-reactive epitopes identified by peptide sequencing. CONCLUSION: The determination of equivalent gliadin 33-mer epitopes in beers has been shown to be practical, specific, and sensitive for the measurement of potential immunotoxicity for celiac patients.},

   abstract = {BACKGROUND: Certain immunotoxic peptides from gluten are resistant to gastrointestinal digestion and can interact with celiac-patient factors to trigger an immunologic response. A gluten-free diet (GFD) is the only effective treatment for celiac disease (CD), and its compliance should be monitored to avoid cumulative damage. However, practical methods to monitor diet compliance and to detect the origin of an outbreak of celiac clinical symptoms are not available. OBJECTIVE: We assessed the capacity to determine the gluten ingestion and monitor GFD compliance in celiac patients by the detection of gluten and gliadin 33-mer equivalent peptidic epitopes (33EPs) in human feces. DESIGN: Fecal samples were obtained from healthy subjects, celiac patients, and subjects with other intestinal pathologies with different diet conditions. Gluten and 33EPs were analyzed by using immunochromatography and competitive ELISA with a highly sensitive antigliadin 33-mer monoclonal antibody. RESULTS: The resistance of a significant part of 33EPs to gastrointestinal digestion was shown in vitro and in vivo. We were able to detect gluten peptides in feces of healthy individuals after consumption of a normal gluten-containing diet, after consumption of a GFD combined with controlled ingestion of a fixed amount of gluten, and after ingestion of <100 mg gluten/d. These methods also allowed us to detect GFD infringement in CD patients. CONCLUSIONS: Gluten-derived peptides could be sensitively detected in human feces in positive correlation with the amount of gluten intake. These techniques may serve to show GFD compliance or infringement and be used in clinical research in strategies to eliminate gluten immunotoxic peptides during digestion. This trial was registered at clinicaltrials.gov as NCT01478867.},

   abstract = {AIM: The coeliac disease deprives affected individual of the main nutritive factors, which are essential to promote body development: coeliac children are often subject to weight loss and have a lower somatic growth rate compared to healthy children. In addition, it is proven that prolonged malnutrition can have irreversible effects on dental eruption: teeth development also suffers a delay or it is slowed down in coeliac children. The purpose of this study was to evaluate and quantify the persistence of a delay in the dental age in children with coeliac disease and the presence of a possible constant relationship between the estimated delay in skeletal development and that referred to the dental age. MATERIALS AND METHODS: Seventy children (24 males and 46 females) were selected, all affected by coeliac disease, aged between 5.3 and 13.8 years, with a mean age of 9 years +/- 22 months SD. Through teleradiography of the skull in latero-lateral projection and orthopantomography of the dental arches, the estimate of the skeletal development and dental age was carried out for each patient, applying two specific methods extensively described in the literature. RESULTS AND CONCLUSION: The results obtained, in agreement with the literature, show how the dental age, which is delayed in children affected by coeliac disease, may be considered as a reliable indicator of somatic growth and also of biological age. Furthermore, a gluten-free diet has considerable beneficial effects on skeletal development in relation to the dental age, in agreement with the hypothesis that dental development is controlled by different regulatory mechanisms, totally independent from those that influence skeletal development and the somatic and sexual development of the individual, even if the delay of dental development decreases progressively from the time of diagnosis of coeliac disease to introduction of a gluten-free diet.},

Celiac disease is associated with an increased risk of autoimmune diseases (type 1 diabetes, thyroiditis), and cancer (upper digestive tract, hepatocellular carcinoma, lymphoma). The main digestive complications are microscopic colitis and refractory sprue, which are resistant to gluten-free diet. It can be associated with a monoclonal proliferation of intraepithelial lymphocytes (type 2 refractory sprue), which may be considered as a cryptic lymphoma and can lead to invasive T lymphoma, which occurs in one celiac patient in 1000. Gluten-free diet protects from the occurrence of most complications and correct the over-mortality related to these complications.},

   abstract = {Coeliac disease is a permanent immunological intolerance to gluten proteins in genetically predisposed individuals. The only management is life-long strict adherence to a gluten-free diet. Unfortunately, compliance with gluten-free diet is very difficult in practice due to the widespread presence of gluten in Western diets. For this reason, about 50% of coeliacs following a gluten-free diet continue to suffer from symptoms and present with autoantibodies and/or villous atrophy while on a gluten-free diet. It is therefore important to explore new therapies to improve the management of coeliac disease. To date, five experimental therapies have been tested in randomized and controlled clinical trials. Larazotide acetate reduces the para-cellular passage of gluten to the lamina propria by preventing the opening of intercellular tight junctions. The endopeptidases ALV003 and AN-PEP break down gluten to produce less or non-toxic peptide fragments. A therapeutic vaccine is being tested with the aim of developing gluten tolerance. Finally, infection with the nematode Necator americanus and treatment with the CCR9 antagonist Traficet-EN have also been reported. While substantial progress has been made in the last few years, it is important to remember that all these investigational therapies are in research stage and are generally being considered as "adjunctive" therapies to the gluten-free diet and not as substitutes of the gluten-free diet at this point in time.},

   abstract = {BACKGROUND: Recent data suggest the involvement of both the adaptive and the innate immune system in celiac disease (CD). However, little is known about the immune phenotype of children with CD and its alteration upon dietary intervention. AIMS: We characterized the prevalence of major interacting members of the adaptive and innate immune system in peripheral blood of newly diagnosed children with CD and tested its alteration with the improvement of clinical signs after the introduction of gluten-free diet (GFD). METHODS: Peripheral blood was taken from ten children with biopsy-proven CD at the time of diagnosis and after the resolution of clinical symptoms following GFD. As controls, 15 children with functional abdominal pain were enrolled. The prevalence of the cells of adaptive and innate immunity was measured with labeled antibodies against surface markers and intracellular FoxP3 using a flow cytometer. RESULTS: Patients with CD were found to have lower T helper, Th1 and natural killer (NK), NKT and invariant NKT cell prevalence and with higher prevalence of activated CD4(+) cells, myeloid dendritic cells (DC) and Toll-like receptor (TLR) 2 and TLR-4 positive DCs and monocytes compared to controls. After resolution of symptoms on GFD, the majority of these changes normalized, although the prevalence of NK and NKT cell, DC and TLR-2 expressing DCs and monocytes remained abnormal. CONCLUSIONS: The immune phenotype in childhood CD indicates the implication of both adaptive and innate immune system. The normalization of immune abnormalities occurs on GFD, but the kinetics of this process probably differs among different cell types.},

   abstract = {OBJECTIVE: Hereditary angioedema due to C1-inhibitor deficiency is a life-threatening condition, which manifests as edematous attacks involving subcutaneous tissues and/or the upper airway/gastrointestinal mucosa. Celiac disease is a gluten-sensitive small intestinal disorder that can lead to severe villous atrophy, malabsorption, and malignancy. Both hereditary angioedema and celiac disease may present with abdominal symptoms. Our aim was to study the occurrence of celiac disease in the hereditary angioedema population, as well as to analyze the clinical course of cases with both diseases. METHODS: One hundred and twenty-eight patients with hereditary angioedema were screened for celiac disease, using serological methods [antiendomysial antibodies-immunoglobulin A (IgA), antiendomysial antibodies-IgG and tissue transglutaminase-IgA, tissue transglutaminase-IgG]. Clinical data of a child with hereditary angioedema and celiac disease diagnosed earlier were added to the dataset to be analyzed. Thus, the total number of patients was 129, comprising 107 adults and 22 pediatric patients. In patients with celiac disease, molecular genetics analysis (human leukocyte antigen-DQA1, human leukocyte antigen-DQB1) was carried out along with the introduction of a gluten-free diet and regular follow-up. RESULTS: Four out of the 22 children were diagnosed with celiac disease in our hereditary angioedema population. The prevalence of celiac disease among our pediatric patients with hereditary angioedema (22 children) was higher than in the general population (18.1 vs. 1.2%). Switching from the wheat starch-containing tranexamic acid product to danazol and introducing a gluten-free diet mitigated abdominal symptoms of hereditary angioedema. CONCLUSION: Similarities between the symptoms of hereditary angioedema and celiac disease may cause difficulties in differential diagnosis, as well as in choosing the appropriate therapy. In our opinion, screening hereditary angioedema patients for celiac disease is warranted if abdominal attacks or neurological symptoms persist despite adequate management. Complement testing is recommended whenever abdominal symptoms persist despite the histological and serological remission of gluten-sensitive enteropathy after the introduction of a gluten-free diet.},

   abstract = {BACKGROUND AND AIM: Morbid obesity is a highly prevalent condition. In selected cases, bariatric surgery is indicated. Although for decades celiac disease (CD) has been associated with chronic diarrhea and weight loss, now it becomes clear that the clinical spectrum is extremely wide. METHODS: We report 5 morbidly obese patients that were diagnosed of CD during preoperative work-up for bariatric surgery. Diagnosis was suspected during routine upper endoscopy, and confirmed by histology and positive CD-specific serology. RESULT: Four of the 5 cases were asymptomatic. One complained of chronic diarrhea and anemia. All cases initiated a gluten-free diet. Due to CD, patients were offered a purely restrictive bariatric procedure. Three patients underwent a sleeve gastrectomy while the other two are still undergoing pre-operative evaluations. CONCLUSION: This report enlarges the clinical spectrum of untreated CD. Although prevalence of CD in obese patients seems to be similar to that in the general population, morbid obese patients should be tested for CD in order to establish the best surgical strategy and outcome.},

   abstract = {OBJECTIVES: The Marsh classification is a semiquantitative method for the diagnosis and monitoring of changes in duodenal biopsies in celiac disease. We have explored the possibility that quantitative changes in villous area and crypt length (morphometry) may provide better information on changes in duodenal morphology, particularly after the introduction of a gluten-free diet. METHODS: We measured villous height, apical and basal villous widths, and crypt length in 57 adults with celiac disease and 83 control subjects. Villous area was calculated as a trapezoid approximation. Serial changes in villous area and crypt length were determined at regular intervals for up to 4 years after the introduction of a gluten-free diet. Morphometric changes were also correlated with Marsh grade, self-reported adherence to a gluten-free diet, and changes in celiac serology. RESULTS: The gluten-free diet resulted in a progressive increase in villous area and a progressive decrease in crypt length. Morphometric improvement reached a plateau after 6-12 months with mean villous area attaining a value approximately half that of control subjects. Morphometric data were more sensitive than Marsh grade. Improvement in morphometric indices was significantly associated with the disappearance of anti-endomysial IgA antibody but not with dietary compliance. CONCLUSIONS: Morphometry is a sensitive way to document changes in duodenal biopsies in celiac disease. In adults treated with a gluten-free diet, it is uncommon for villous area to return to values observed in control subjects, but morphometric improvement is associated with the disappearance of anti-endomysial IgA antibody.},

   abstract = {OBJECTIVES: To examine the extent of brain abnormality in patients with coeliac disease referred for neurological opinion and evaluate MR imaging sequences as biomarkers for neurological dysfunction, given the lack of readily available serological markers of neurological disease in this cohort. METHODS: Retrospective examination of a consecutive cohort of patients (n = 33, mean age = 44 +/- 13 years (range 19-64)) with biopsy proven coeliac disease referred for neurological opinion. Patients were divided into subgroups based on their primary neurological complaint (balance disturbance, headache and sensory loss). 3T MR was used to evaluate differences in brain grey matter density, cerebellar volume, cerebellar neurochemistry and white matter abnormalities (WMAs) between subjects and controls. RESULTS: Cerebellar volume was significantly less in the patient group than in controls (6.9 +/- 0.7% vs 7.4 +/- 0.9% of total intracranial volume, p<0.05). Significantly less grey matter density was found in multiple brain regions, both above and below the tentorium cerebelli, than in controls (p<0.05). 12 (36%) patients demonstrated WMAs unexpected for the patient's age, with the highest incidence occurring in the headache subgroup. This subgroup averaged almost twice the number of WMAs per MR imaging than the subgroup with balance disturbance and six times more than the subgroup with sensory loss. CONCLUSION: Patients with established coeliac disease referred for neurological opinion show significant brain abnormality on MR imaging. MR imaging may provide valuable biomarkers of disease in this patient cohort.},

   abstract = {Transglutaminase 2 (TG2) is an allosterically regulated enzyme with transamidating, deamidating and cell signaling activities. It is thought to catalyze sequence-specific deamidation of dietary gluten peptides in the small intestines of celiac disease patients. Because this modification has profound consequences for disease pathogenesis, there is considerable interest in the design of small molecule TG2 inhibitors. Although many classes of TG2 inhibitors have been reported, thus far an animal model for screening them to identify promising celiac drug candidates has remained elusive. Using intraperitoneal administration of the toll-like receptor 3 (TLR3) ligand, polyinosinic-polycytidylic acid (poly(IratioC)), we induced rapid TG2 activation in the mouse small intestine. Dose dependence was observed in the activation of TG2 as well as the associated villous atrophy, gross clinical response, and rise in serum concentration of the IL-15/IL-15R complex. TG2 activity was most pronounced in the upper small intestine. No evidence of TG2 activation was observed in the lung mucosa, nor were TLR7/8 ligands able to elicit an analogous response. Introduction of ERW1041E, a small molecule TG2 inhibitor, in this mouse model resulted in TG2 inhibition in the small intestine. TG2 inhibition had no effect on villous atrophy, suggesting that activation of this enzyme is a consequence, rather than a cause, of poly(IratioC) induced enteropathy. Consistent with this finding, administration of poly(IratioC) to TG2 knockout mice also induced villous atrophy. Our findings pave the way for pharmacological evaluation of small molecule TG2 inhibitors as drug candidates for celiac disease.},

   abstract = {SCOPE: The main objectives of this study were to estimate dietary fumonisin exposure and nutrient intake in a group of patients diagnosed with celiac disease compared to non-celiac subjects. METHODS AND RESULTS: The fumonisin level in 118 frequently consumed corn-based products was determined and dietary habits were recorded using a 7-day weighed food record. Data were then compared to those obtained for a control group. The fumonisin intake in the celiac patients was significantly higher than in controls, with mean values (+/- SE) of 0.395 +/- 0.049 and 0.029 +/- 0.006 mug/kg body weight per day, respectively. With regard to nutritional habits, celiac patients showed a preference for a high fat diet, coupled with a high intake of sweets and soft drinks and a low intake of vegetables, iron, calcium and folate. CONCLUSION: These findings may have serious health implications for the celiac population due to the widespread occurrence of fumonisins in most of the widely consumed gluten-free products, leading to continuous exposure to this particular mycotoxin. Moreover, the recorded nutritional quality of the celiac patient's diet raises concerns regarding its long-term adequacy and its potential impact on chronic conditions such as type 2 diabetes and cardiovascular diseases.},

   abstract = {BACKGROUND AND AIMS: The association between hygiene and prevalence of autoimmune disease has been attributed in part to enteric helminth infection. A pilot study of experimental infection with the hookworm Necator americanus was undertaken among a group of otherwise healthy people with celiac disease to test the potential of the helminth to suppress the immunopathology induced by gluten. METHODS: In a 21-week, double-blinded, placebo-controlled study, we explored the effects of N. americanus infection in 20 healthy, helminth-naive adults with celiac disease well controlled by diet. Staged cutaneous inoculations with 10 and 5 infective 3(rd) stage hookworm larvae or placebo were performed at week-0 and -12 respectively. At week-20, a five day oral wheat challenge equivalent to 16 grams of gluten per day was undertaken. Primary outcomes included duodenal Marsh score and quantification of the immunodominant alpha-gliadin peptide (QE65)-specific systemic interferon-gamma-producing cells by ELISpot pre- and post-wheat challenge. RESULTS: Enteric colonisation with hookworm established in all 10 cases, resulting in transiently painful enteritis in 5. Chronic infection was asymptomatic, with no effect on hemoglobin levels. Although some duodenal eosinophilia was apparent, hookworm-infected mucosa retained a healthy appearance. In both groups, wheat challenge caused deterioration in both primary and several secondary outcomes. CONCLUSIONS: Experimental N. americanus infection proved to be safe and enabled testing its effect on a range of measures of the human autoimmune response. Infection imposed no obvious benefit on pathology. TRIAL REGISTRATION: ClinicalTrials.gov NCT00671138.},

Considering that Celiac Disease was first documented in Scandinavian Europe, a population exposed to a high fat diet, perhaps the polymorphic genetics of the disease provides balanced polymorphism against this environmental stimulus. Celiac Disease has been associated with higher levels of the T cell receptor (TCR)gammadelta, receptors that have played a greater role in recognizing microbial lipids. Furthermore, obesity has been associated with lower levels of CD-3 expression while Celiac Disease has been associated with an up regulation of this molecule. These finding might help to describe a balance polymorphism that exists in Celiac Disease as well as an etiological factor that lead to the development of the disease.},

   abstract = {BACKGROUND: Maize, one of the suitable grains for coeliac consumption, is, together with rice, the most cultivated cereal in the world. However, the inclusion of maize flour in gluten-free bread is a minority and studies are scarce. This paper analyses the influence of different maize flour types and their particle sizes on the quality of two types of bread without gluten (80% and 110% water in the formulation) obtained from them. We also analysed the microstructure of the dough and its behaviour during the fermentation. RESULTS: Finer flours had a lower dough development during fermentation in all cases. Among the different types of flour, those whose microstructure revealed compact particles were those which had higher specific bread volume, especially when the particle size was greater. Among the formulations, the dough with more water gave breads with higher specific volume, an effect that was more important in more compact flours. The higher volume breads had lower values of hardness and resilience. CONCLUSION: The type of corn flour and mainly its particle size influence significantly the dough development of gluten-free bread during fermentation and therefore the final volume and texture of the breads obtained. The flours having coarser particle size are the most suitable for making gluten-free maize bread.},

   abstract = {The link between the gluten component of wheat and celiac disease (CD) was discovered in 1952 by a team of physicians from Birmingham, England. Villous atrophy was described by John W. Paulley in 1954. During the 1960s, other features of CD were elucidated; its hereditary nature was recognized in 1965, and in 1966, dermatitis herpetiformis was linked to gluten sensitivity. Following the discovery of a link between gluten and CD, it was demonstrated that gliadin, one of the two principal protein groups comprising gluten, plays a critical role in CD. It has since become clear that the different and crucial roles of gliadin in CD result from its ability to activate multiple signaling pathways that modulate CD pathology. Most of these pathways involve the host innate and adaptive immune responses, but some pathways are activated when gliadin interacts with the intestinal cellular compartment. This review covers the current knowledge of the role of gliadin peptides in CD disorders that are characterized by intraepithelial T-cells infiltration (IEL), production of autoantibodies, endosomal trafficking, alteration of intestinal barrier function and intestinal cell proliferation. In addition, it examines the ability of these characteristics to determine the main clinicopathological features of gluten sensitivity for the purpose of identifying new strategies, other than maintaining a gluten-free diet, to improve the management of CD patients in the future.},

   abstract = {Under physiological conditions the gut-associated lymphoid tissues not only prevent the induction of a local inflammatory immune response, but also induce systemic tolerance to fed antigens. A notable exception is coeliac disease, where genetically susceptible individuals expressing human leukocyte antigen (HLA) HLA-DQ2 or HLA-DQ8 molecules develop inflammatory T-cell and antibody responses against dietary gluten, a protein present in wheat. The mechanisms underlying this dysregulated mucosal immune response to a soluble antigen have not been identified. Retinoic acid, a metabolite of vitamin A, has been shown to have a critical role in the induction of intestinal regulatory responses. Here we find in mice that in conjunction with IL-15, a cytokine greatly upregulated in the gut of coeliac disease patients, retinoic acid rapidly activates dendritic cells to induce JNK (also known as MAPK8) phosphorylation and release the proinflammatory cytokines IL-12p70 and IL-23. As a result, in a stressed intestinal environment, retinoic acid acted as an adjuvant that promoted rather than prevented inflammatory cellular and humoral responses to fed antigen. Altogether, these findings reveal an unexpected role for retinoic acid and IL-15 in the abrogation of tolerance to dietary antigens.},

   abstract = {Usually, celiac disease has a benign course, though the overall morbidity and mortality have increased. Treatment with a gluten-free diet restores the damaged intestinal mucosa. In rare cases a small bowel adenocarcinoma develops. Unfortunately, the clinical presentation is not always recognized and prognosis is bad. We present a 69-year-old man with a history of dermatitis herpetiformis who presented to our tertiary center for a second opinion for a suspected gastric motility disorder. This diagnosis was based on the combination of upper abdominal pain for over 2 years and repetitive episodes of vomiting. Immediately after referral, celiac disease was diagnosed and a gluten-free diet was started. In the next half year of follow-up, additional anemia and weight loss developed and eventually a small bowel adenocarcinoma was diagnosed. Revision of a small bowel follow-through, which had been performed 2 years earlier, showed that the tube had been positioned just distal from the process. Therefore, this diagnosis had not been made at that time. Unfortunately, curative therapy was not possible and the patient died a few months later. In conclusion, all patients with dermatitis herpetiformis have a gluten-sensitive enteropathy and should be treated with a gluten-free diet. Next to this it is important to notice that patients with celiac disease have an increased risk of developing a small bowel malignancy. Unexplained upper abdominal pain, weight loss and anemia should lead to additional investigations to exclude a small bowel malignancy in these patients. At last, the diagnosis of a small bowel carcinoma is difficult. Together with the radiologist, the optimal techniques for visualization of this malignancy should be considered.},

   abstract = {AIM: To investigate all patients referred to our center with non-responsive celiac disease (NRCD), to establish a cause for their continued symptoms. METHODS: We assessed all patients referred to our center with non-responsive celiac disease over an 18-mo period. These individuals were investigated to establish the eitiology of their continued symptoms. The patients were first seen in clinic where a thorough history and examination were performed with routine blood work including tissue transglutaminase antibody measurement. They were also referred to a specialist gastroenterology dietician to try to identift any lapses in the diet and sources of hidden gluten ingestion. A repeat small intestinal biopsy was also performed and compared to biopsies from the referring hospital where possible. Colonoscopy, lactulose hydrogen breath testing, pancreolauryl testing and computed tomography scan of the abdomen were undertaken if the symptoms persisted. Their clinical progress was followed over a minimum of 2 years. RESULTS: One hundred and twelve consecutive patients were referred with NRCD. Twelve were found not to have celiac disease (CD). Of the remaining 100 patients, 45% were not adequately adhering to a strict gluten-free diet, with 24 (53%) found to be inadvertently ingesting gluten, and 21 (47%) admitting non-compliance. Microscopic colitis was diagnosed in 12% and small bowel bacterial overgrowth in 9%. Refractory CD was diagnosed in 9%. Three of these were diagnosed with intestinal lymphoma. After 2 years, 78 patients remained well, eight had continuing symptoms, and four had died. CONCLUSION: In individuals with NRCD, a remediable cause can be found in 90%: with continued gluten ingestion as the leading cause. We propose an algorithm for investigation.},

   abstract = {BACKGROUND: Epidemiology of celiac disease (CD) is increasing. CD mainly presents in early childhood with small intestinal villous atrophy and signs of malabsorption. Compared to healthy individuals, CD patients seemed to be characterized by higher numbers of Gram-negative bacteria and lower numbers Gram-positive bacteria. RESULTS: This study aimed at investigating the microbiota and metabolome of 19 celiac disease children under gluten-free diet (treated celiac disease, T-CD) and 15 non-celiac children (HC). PCR-denaturing gradient gel electrophoresis (DGGE) analyses by universal and group-specific primers were carried out in duodenal biopsies and faecal samples. Based on the number of PCR-DGGE bands, the diversity of Eubacteria was the higher in duodenal biopsies of T-CD than HC children. Bifidobacteria were only found in faecal samples. With a few exceptions, PCR-DGGE profiles of faecal samples for Lactobacillus and Bifidobacteria differed between T-CD and HC. As shown by culture-dependent methods, the levels of Lactobacillus, Enterococcus and Bifidobacteria were confirmed to be significantly higher (P = 0.028; P = 0.019; and P = 0.023, respectively) in fecal samples of HC than in T-CD children. On the contrary, cell counts (CFU/ml) of presumptive Bacteroides, Staphylococcus, Salmonella, Shighella and Klebsiella were significantly higher (P = 0.014) in T-CD compared to HC children. Enterococcus faecium and Lactobacillus plantarum were the species most diffusely identified. This latter species was also found in all duodenal biopsies of T-CD and HC children. Other bacterial species were identified only in T-CD or HC faecal samples. As shown by Randomly Amplified Polymorphic DNA-PCR analysis, the percentage of strains identified as lactobacilli significantly (P = 0.011) differed between T-CD (ca. 26.5%) and HC (ca. 34.6%) groups. The metabolome of T-CD and HC children was studied using faecal and urine samples which were analyzed by gas-chromatography mass spectrometry-solid-phase microextraction and 1H-Nuclear Magnetic Resonance. As shown by Canonical Discriminant Analysis of Principal Coordinates, the levels of volatile organic compounds and free amino acids in faecal and/or urine samples were markedly affected by CD. CONCLUSION: As shown by the parallel microbiology and metabolome approach, the gluten-free diet lasting at least two years did not completely restore the microbiota and, consequently, the metabolome of CD children. Some molecules (e.g., ethyl-acetate and octyl-acetate, some short chain fatty acids and free amino acids, and glutamine) seems to be metabolic signatures of CD.},

   abstract = {Enteropathy-associated T-cell lymphoma (EATL) is a complication of celiac disease (CD). This tumor derives from the neoplastic transformation of aberrant intraepithelial T lymphocytes emerging in celiac patients unresponsive to a gluten-free diet. Poor adherence to a gluten-free diet, HLA-DQ2 homozygosity, and late diagnosis of CD are recognized as risk factors for malignant evolution of CD. Recurrence of diarrhea, unexplained weight loss, abdominal pain, fever, and night sweating should alert physicians to this complication. The suspicion of EATL should lead to an extensive diagnostic workup in which magnetic resonance enteroclysis, positron emission tomography scan, and histologic identification of lesions represent the best options. Treatment includes high-dose chemotherapy preceded by surgical resection and followed by autologous stem cell transplantation, although biologic therapies seem to be promising. Strict adherence to a gluten-free diet remains the only way to prevent EATL.},

   abstract = {OBJECTIVES: Cognate interaction between CD40 on antigen-presenting cells and CD40 ligand (CD40L) on T cells is a crucial costimulatory signal in T-cell activation. In this study, we investigated CD40-CD40L expression in the duodenum of uncomplicated and refractory celiac disease patients, and explored the ex vivo effects of CD40L blockade on cytokine production and the T-helper cell type 1-specific transcription factor T-bet. METHODS: CD40L and colocalization of CD40 with the dendritic cell markers CD11c and CD123 were investigated by confocal microscopy on tissue sections of duodenal biopsy samples obtained from 14 uncomplicated celiac patients before and after 12 months of gluten-free diet, 5 refractory celiac patients, and 12 controls. CD40 was also analyzed by flow cytometry on single cell suspension of mucosal biopsies. Treated celiac biopsies were stimulated with peptic-tryptic digest of gliadin (PT-gliadin) with or without an anti-CD40L-neutralizing antibody. Interferon (IFN)-gamma and interleukin (IL)-17 were measured by ELISA (enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay). T-bet, CD40, and CD40L were determined by immunoblotting. RESULTS: CD40 and CD40L expression was higher in uncomplicated untreated and refractory celiac patients than in controls; the expression returned to normal after gluten-free diet in uncomplicated patients. Flow cytometric analysis confirmed that most CD40(+) cells were dendritic cells. The addition of the anti-CD40L antibody to treated celiac biopsies significantly inhibited the PT-gliadin-induced production of IFN-gamma and IL-17, and mucosal T-bet. CONCLUSIONS: Our results indicate that the CD40-CD40L pathway has a key role in celiac disease. Disruption of CD40-CD40L interaction may offer a therapeutic alternative in refractory celiac disease.},

   abstract = {BACKGROUND: Thyroid autoimmunity (TA) is often associated with coeliac disease (CD). OBJECTIVE: To evaluate, in children and adolescents with CD on a gluten-free diet (GFD): (1) the prevalence of TA; (2) the impact of TA on growth and the need for L-thyroxine (L-T4) treatment, during a longitudinal survey. METHOD: Between January and December 2005, 545 patients with CD, prospectively followed up until December 2007, and 622 controls were screened for TA. Antithyroperoxidase and antithyroglobulin antibodies were assayed and, if positive, serum free tri-iodothyronine, free thyroxine and thyroid-stimulating hormone (TSH) assays and thyroid ultrasound were performed. L-T4 was started if TSH was >5.5 mU/ml at two successive measurements. RESULTS: There was no significant difference in TA prevalence between patients with CD on a GFD (10%) and controls (8.2%). Duration of GFD differed significantly in coeliac patients with TA in comparison with those without TA (7.9+/-0.9 and 10.2+/-0.3 years, p<0.001), but no significant difference was found for weight and height gain (1.8+/-1.0 vs 3.7+/-1.5 and 2.1+/-1.2 kg/year vs 4.0+/-1.1 cm/year, respectively). At the end of the follow-up an increase of 7% in the prevalence of patients with CD with TA requiring L-T4 was found. CONCLUSIONS: TA seems no more common in paediatric and adolescent patients with CD on a GFD than in controls; its clinical evolution does not seem to impact on growth. Therefore, a long-term regular screening programme for thyroid disease may not be necessary for all patients with CD on a GFD, but only for those who are suspected of having thyroid diseases.},

   abstract = {Gluten is a commonly used cereal derivative found in bakery products, among other items. In some susceptible individuals, however, it triggers immune responses of different kinds; there is, to a lesser extent, the wheat allergy that is immunoglobulin E (IgE)-mediated and leads to histamine release and typical allergic symptoms. In this case, other water-soluble proteins, like albumins, are also involved. On the other hand, there is, more frequently, celiac disease (CD), where the gluten causes immune reactions in the intestines of certain individuals, leading to degeneration of villi, which typically leads to malabsorption of nutrients and, consequently, malnutrition. The only currently effective health strategy for affected consumers is avoidance of gluten-containing products, based on clear labeling rules. However, despite unanimously accepted Codex definitions by all member jurisdictions, the national implementation of equivalent laws shows significant differences. In the context of CD and in support of the gluten-free statement, regulatory enforcement, as well as manufacturers' quality controls are mostly based on analytical results. However, numerous methods are available, some of which have been validated better than others, and many provide different results on identical samples. Reasons include detection of different gluten components and variability in extraction efficiency due to different buffer compositions, especially from processed foods. Last but not least, the lack of reference materials is hindering the process of generating comparable data across different ELISA kits, as well as other methods. How can such data still be used to support a gluten-free claim? New methodologies, in particular mass spectrometric analysis of gluten derived peptides, are being introduced in numerous laboratories. This methodology is not only capable of detecting gluten derived peptides but can also differentiate between and quantitate wheat, barley, rye, and oat. This paper presents analytical limitations, as well as promising new approaches in support of industry and enforcement activities to ensure compliance with the gluten-free claim under the current regulatory framework.},

In this study, we examine the levels of antibody reactivity to gliadin, deamidated gliadin, and tissue transglutaminase (tTG) in individuals with bipolar disorder and compare these levels to those in individuals who do not have any history of psychiatric disorder. METHODS: The sample of 275 individuals included 102 with bipolar disorder and 173 controls without a psychiatric disorder. Immunoglobulin G (IgG) and immunoglobulin A (IgA) antibodies to gliadin and tTG and IgG antibodies to deamidated gliadin were measured by enzyme immunoassay. Participants' levels of antibodies to deamidated gliadin and tTG were classified based on the cutoffs for positivity that are predictive of celiac disease. Quantitative levels of antibodies were compared between groups employing regression models which were controlled for demographic variables. RESULTS: Individuals with bipolar disorder had increased levels of IgG antibodies to gliadin compared with controls in multivariate analyses. We also found evidence of increased levels of antibodies to deamidated gliadin in the bipolar disorder population. The levels of IgA class antigliadin antibodies and antibodies to tTG did not differ significantly between groups. There was also not a significant difference between groups in the number of persons who were classified as having levels of antibodies to deamidated gliadin or tTG that are predictive of celiac disease. CONCLUSIONS: Individuals with bipolar disorder have increased levels of IgG antibodies to gliadin. However, such antibody increase is not accompanied by an elevation in IgA antibodies to gliadin or the celiac disease-associated antibodies against deamidated gliadin and tTG. These results warrant further detailed examination of the molecular specificity and pattern of reactivity of the antibody response to gluten antigens in bipolar disorder.},

   abstract = {OBJECTIVE: To assess the prevalence of headache in clinic and support group patients with celiac disease and inflammatory bowel disease (IBD) compared with a sample of healthy controls. BACKGROUND: European studies have demonstrated increased prevalence of headache of patients with celiac disease compared with controls. METHODS: Subjects took a self-administered survey containing clinical, demographic, and dietary data, as well as questions about headache type and frequency. The ID-Migraine screening tool and the Headache Impact Test (HIT-6) were also used. RESULTS: Five hundred and two subjects who met exclusion criteria were analyzed - 188 with celiac disease, 111 with IBD, 25 with gluten sensitivity (GS), and 178 controls (C). Chronic headaches were reported by 30% of celiac disease, 56% of GS, 23% of IBD, and 14% of control subjects (P<.0001). On multivariate logistic regression, celiac disease (odds ratio [OR] 3.79, 95% confidence interval [CI] 1.78-8.10), GS (OR 9.53, 95%CI 3.24-28.09), and IBD (OR 2.66, 95%CI 1.08-6.54) subjects all had significantly higher prevalence of migraine headaches compared with controls. Female sex (P=.01), depression, and anxiety (P=.0059) were independent predictors of migraine headaches, whereas age >65 was protective (P=.0345). Seventy-two percent of celiac disease subjects graded their migraine as severe in impact, compared with 30% of IBD, 60% of GS, and 50% of C subjects (P=.0919). There was no correlation between years on gluten-free diet and migraine severity. CONCLUSIONS: Migraine was more prevalent in celiac disease and IBD subjects than in controls. Future studies should include screening migraine patients for celiac disease and assessing the effects of gluten-free diet on migraines in celiac disease.},

   abstract = {INTRODUCTION: Coeliac disease is a common disease that affects approximately 1% of Northern European and American populations. Evidence suggests it is caused by an inappropriate immune response in genetically susceptible patients to dietary gluten found in wheat, rye, barley and, in a small minority of patients, oats. Treatment involves a lifelong gluten-free diet. This diet limits nutritional variety and is costly and difficult to maintain. AREAS COVERED: This review covers the current treatment options available and discusses novel emerging therapies for coeliac disease. EXPERT OPINION: Novel therapies are still in early stages of development and therefore, at present, a gluten-free diet remains the treatment of choice in coeliac disease due to its low side-effect profile. A replacement for a gluten-free diet would be superior to an adjunct; in this case dietary modification of gluten may well have the least side effects, be tolerated by a wider group of coeliac patients and therefore be accepted. Search terms used: Pubmed, Medline and clinicaltrials.gov were searched with 'celiac disease' and 'therapy' as MESH terms. Patent database was searched using the term 'celiac disease'. Conference attendance at DDW Chicago 2011 and Columbia 2010 was also used to gain further information from conference abstracts.},

   abstract = {BACKGROUND: Chronic mesenteric ischemia (CMI) is a rare diagnosis for patients in their third decade of life. Other conditions can mimic the signs and symptoms of CMI, including median arcuate ligament syndrome (MALS), primary arteritides, and congenital anomalies. Here, we present the case of a 26-year-old man who presented with CMI and multivessel mesenteric occlusive disease. METHODS: A 26-year-old man presented with a 6-month history of 40-pound weight loss, postprandial abdominal pain, and food fear. His physical examination showed a scaphoid abdomen with no tenderness. Findings from laboratory evaluation were normal. Computed tomography angiogram revealed celiac artery (CA) occlusion and >80% superior mesenteric artery (SMA) stenosis, with a large marginal artery of Drummond supplying collateral circulation. RESULTS: A retroperitoneal exposure of the perivisceral aorta was performed. Surgical exposure revealed compression of both CA and SMA by the MAL. The total distance of caudal arterial displacement was >3 cm. Both the CA and SMA were chronically stenotic/occluded secondary to this compression. After division of the MAL, a retrograde aortoceliac and aortomesenteric bypass was performed for mesenteric revascularization. The patient recovered uneventfully and was discharged home on the third day after surgery tolerating a full diet. CONCLUSIONS: MALS is a pathologic entity that can affect more than the CA. This case demonstrates multivessel, mesenteric arterial insufficiency secondary to MALS sufficient to promote IMA collateralization of the SMA circulation. In young patients with CMI, multivessel MALS must be considered. In addition to MAL release, arterial revascularization may be necessary owing to stenoses from chronic compression.},

   abstract = {The term oral (or mucosal) tolerance has been classically defined as the suppression of T- and B-cell responses to an antigen by prior administration of the antigen by the oral route. In recent years, it has become clear that both innate and acquired regulatory immune responses are essential for the development of oral tolerance. As such, mucosal microenvironmental factors such as transforming growth factor- beta, prostaglandins but also dietary vitamin A create conditioning of an adaptive regulatory T-cell response that suppresses subsequent antigen-specific responses. Particular resident subsets of antigen presenting dendritic cells are pivotal to convey conditioning signals next to the presentation of antigen. This review discusses the primary mechanisms of adaptive regulatory T-cell induction to ingested soluble protein antigen. However, we also discuss the limitations of our knowledge with respect to understanding the very common food hypersensitivity Celiac disease caused by an aberrant adaptive immune response to the food protein gluten.},

   abstract = {BACKGROUND: Wheat flour is one of the world's major food ingredients, in part because of the unique end-use qualities conferred by the abundant glutamine- and proline-rich gluten proteins. Many wheat flour proteins also present dietary problems for consumers with celiac disease or wheat allergies. Despite the importance of these proteins it has been particularly challenging to use MS/MS to distinguish the many proteins in a flour sample and relate them to gene sequences. RESULTS: Grain from the extensively characterized spring wheat cultivar Triticum aestivum 'Butte 86' was milled to white flour from which proteins were extracted, then separated and quantified by 2-DE. Protein spots were identified by separate digestions with three proteases, followed by tandem mass spectrometry analysis of the peptides. The spectra were used to interrogate an improved protein sequence database and results were integrated using the Scaffold program. Inclusion of cultivar specific sequences in the database greatly improved the results, and 233 spots were identified, accounting for 93.1% of normalized spot volume. Identified proteins were assigned to 157 wheat sequences, many for proteins unique to wheat and nearly 40% from Butte 86. Alpha-gliadins accounted for 20.4% of flour protein, low molecular weight glutenin subunits 18.0%, high molecular weight glutenin subunits 17.1%, gamma-gliadins 12.2%, omega-gliadins 10.5%, amylase/protease inhibitors 4.1%, triticins 1.6%, serpins 1.6%, purinins 0.9%, farinins 0.8%, beta-amylase 0.5%, globulins 0.4%, other enzymes and factors 1.9%, and all other 3%. CONCLUSIONS: This is the first successful effort to identify the majority of abundant flour proteins for a single wheat cultivar, relate them to individual gene sequences and estimate their relative levels. Many genes for wheat flour proteins are not expressed, so this study represents further progress in describing the expressed wheat genome. Use of cultivar-specific contigs helped to overcome the difficulties of matching peptides to gene sequences for members of highly similar, rapidly evolving storage protein families. Prospects for simplifying this process for routine analyses are discussed. The ability to measure expression levels for individual flour protein genes complements information gained from efforts to sequence the wheat genome and is essential for studies of effects of environment on gene expression.},

   abstract = {BACKGROUND/AIMS: Infantile persistent diarrhea series are not well documented in the literature. Evaluating the literature, the aim of this study was to document persistent diarrhea cases followed in our center and to constitute a practical diagnostic algorithm for the pediatrician by means of surveying methods. METHODS: Diarrheas lasting more than 14 days were accepted as persistent diarrhea. Forty-one persistent diarrhea cases aged 0-24 months were investigated in this study. The cases were evaluated for the presence of mucus and/or leukocytes in stool and were thus divided into two major groups as colitis or enteropathies. For the differential diagnosis of the persistent colitis group, stool cultures, dietary restrictions, complete blood count, acute phase reactants, pathergy test, gene analysis for familial Mediterranean fever and Behcet's disease, colonoscopy, and biopsies were performed. In the persistent enteropathy group, differential diagnosis was made with the following tests: serum and stool electrolytes, arterial blood gases, serum albumin, total protein, lipid profile, stool alpha-1 antitrypsin level, stool pH, presence of stool fat and reducing substance, endoscopy, and biopsies. RESULTS: The 27 persistent enteropathy cases included 7 celiac disease, 5 intestinal lymphangiectasia, 2 microvillus inclusion disease, 2 abetalipoproteinemia, and 11 cow's milk allergy. The 13 cases of the infantile colitis group included 1 Behcet's disease, 1 colitis ulcerosa and 11 cow's milk allergy. Two cases presenting as pancreatic insufficiency were diagnosed as cystic fibrosis. One case was diagnosed as cystic fibrosis plus cow's milk allergy. CONCLUSIONS: Reviewing the literature, these cases represent the largest non-infectious infantile group of persistent diarrheas. A practical diagnostic algorithm for persistent diarrheas has been constituted.},

This cross-sectional study included 146 patients with chronic diarrhea. They were 87 males and 59 females, with age ranging between 2 and 198 months and a mean age of 27.3 +/- 34.5 months. Each patient was subjected to medical history taking including age of onset and duration of diarrhea, consistency of stools, presence of blood and mucus, vomiting with or without hematemesis, fever, allergic manifestations and family history of atopy. Dietetic history included milk feeding during the first 6 months and age of weaning and age of introduction of cow's milk products. Anthropometric measurements included weight and height and weight for height were assessed and z-scores were calculated using software WHO anthro v3.2.2. Laboratory investigations included stool analysis and culture, CBC and all other investigations necessary for diagnosis of the definite cause including RAST for specific IgE against cow's milk proteins, serology for celiac disease (anti-gliadin and anti tTG), Breath hydrogen test, endoscopy (colonoscopy or esophago-gastrodudenoscopy) and histopathologic assessment of endoscopic biopsies. CMA was diagnosed on basis of withdrawal and open re-challenge technique. Causes included chronic infections (40.4%), CMA (34.9%), celiac disease (10.3%), inflammatory bowel disease (6.8%) and lactose intolerance (3.4%). Rare causes were chronic non-specific diarrhea (1.3%), cystic fibrosis (0.7%), post-surgery short bowel syndrome (0.7%), neuroblastoma (0.7%) and IBS (0.7%).78.7% of patients enrolled in the study had a low WFA z-score (< -2), 75% had low length for age z-score (<-2) and 50.7% showed wasting with low weight for height z-scores (< -2). Patients with IBD had the lowest mean value of WFA and HFA z-scores (-4.03 +/- 3.23, -6.31 +/- 3.74 respectively). Infants with CMA had the lowest mean value of WFH z-score (-2.26 +/- 1.78).},

   abstract = {Coeliac disease is a chronic inflammatory condition of the small intestine, triggered by dietary exposure to gluten in genetically susceptible individuals. Risk alleles at HLA-DQA1 and HLA-DQB1 are necessary for disease development, but are alone not sufficient for disease onset. We aimed to identify novel loci underlying susceptibility to coeliac disease through the use of extended Finnish and Hungarian families with multiple affected individuals. An initial whole-genome linkage approach yielded several loci that were followed up further using the Immunochip custom array. Loci with a parametric logarithm of odds (LOD) score of >1.3 were identified at 4q, 6p [human leukocyte antigen (HLA) region], 6q, 7p, 17p, 17q and at 22p. The 4q and 6q loci have been identified previously in coeliac disease risk, whereas follow-up analyses indicate that the 17p and 22p loci may be novel risk loci for coeliac disease. These loci harbour previously described risk variants for other autoimmune diseases, but their segregation patterns do not explain the linkage to coeliac disease. We followed up the linkage to the 4q region, containing the previously described interleukin (IL)2 and IL21 genes. The risk variants at 4q in the studied pedigrees are most likely distinct from previously described risk variants, indicating that the observed linkage may be due to rare high-risk variants of still unknown nature. The importance of this locus to coeliac disease risk was further shown by the finding that serum levels of IL21 were elevated in both untreated and treated coeliac patients compared to controls.},

   abstract = {BACKGROUND: Toll-like receptors (TLRs) have achieved an extraordinary amount of interest in inflammatory diseases due to their role in the inflammatory activation. By activating the production of several biological factors, TLRs induce type I interferons and other cytokines, which drive the inflammatory response and activate the adaptive immune system. AIMS: The aim of this study was to investigate and compare the expression and clinical relevance of TLRs and interleukins in pediatric and adult celiac disease (CD), defined as intolerance to dietary proteins found in wheat, barley, and rye. METHODS: The expression levels of TLR3, TLR4, and TLR7, interleukins, and different transcription factors were analyzed on duodenal biopsies from ten children and 31 adults with CD, and 21 duodenal controls biopsies without CD (ten children and 11 adults). The analyses were performed by immunohistochemistry and real-time PCR. RESULTS: There were no significant differences in the studied parameters between adults and children. TLR4 expression level was increased twofold in CD specimens compared to controls. CD patients with high levels of TLR4 also showed high levels of interleukins (IL1, IL6, IL8, and IL17) as well as transcription factors (IRAK4, MyD88, and NF-kappaB). CONCLUSIONS: TLR4 expression is associated with CD independently of age at diagnosis. Pediatric patients and adult patients have a similar inflammatory profile, making it possible to treat both with the same immunological therapy in the future.},

   abstract = {Background. Dental enamel defects (DEDs) are seen in celiac disease (CD). Aim was to detect frequency of CD among such patients. Methods. This study included 140 children with DED. They were tested for CD. Gluten-free diet (GFD) was instituted for CD patients. A cohort of 720, age and sex-matched, normal children represented a control group. Both groups were evaluated clinically. Serum calcium, phosphorus, alkaline phosphatase, serum IgA, and tissue transglutaminase (tTG) IgG and IgA types were measured. Results. CD was more diagnosed in patients with DEDs (17.86%) compared to controls (0.97%) (P < 0.0001). Majority of nonceliac patients showed grade 1 DED compared to grades 1, 2, and 3 DED in CD. Five children had DED of deciduous teeth and remaining in permanent ones. After 1 year on GFD, DED improved better in CD compared to nonceliac patients. Gastrointestinal symptoms did not vary between celiac and nonceliac DED patients. Lower serum calcium significantly predicted CD in this cohort. Conclusion. CD is more prevalent among children with DED than in the general population. These DEDs might be the only manifestation of CD; therefore, screening for CD is highly recommended among those patients especially in presence of underweight and hypocalcemia.},

   abstract = {PURPOSE: Coeliac disease is frequently associated with other immunomediated diseases. Our aim was to identify immunological comorbidities and possible risk factors for their development in coeliac patients. METHODS: We recruited a cohort of 1,015 coeliac patients followed from 0 to 46 years in a single tertiary referral centre. Data were collected from the yearly scheduled clinical and serological evaluations. Possible risk factors such as demographic parameters, type of symptomatic presentation, gluten exposure, gluten-free diet compliance and family history were all evaluated. Subjects (848,606) from the regional health registry were investigated as controls. RESULTS: The prevalence of immunomediated diseases was higher in patients with coeliac disease compared to the registry population (23 % vs 0.4 %, p < 0.001). Diagnosis during paediatric age represented a risk factor for the presence of at least an immunomediated disease (hazard ratio = 1.62, 95 % confidence interval 1.15-2.29, p = 0.0061). Type of presentation and dietetic compliance did not represent risk factors. Long-standing gluten exposure reduced the risk of developing immunomediated diseases in coeliac subjects (hazard ratio for 1 year longer exposure 0.23, 95 % confidence interval 0.16-0.33, p < 0.0001). A familiar background characterized by the presence of immunological disorders was not a risk factor, although 419 (13 %) first degree relatives of coeliac patients out of 3,195 had an immunomediated disease. CONCLUSIONS: Our study suggests the need to investigate coeliac patients for other associated immunomediated diseases, independently of sex, gluten exposure and compliance to therapy; also subjects diagnosed in paediatric age should be carefully screened during follow up.},

   abstract = {Coeliac disease pathogenesis is characterized by an immune response triggered, in genetically predisposed subjects, by ingested gluten and its withdrawal from the diet is the only available therapy. However, enzymatic modification of gluten through the insertion of lysine to avoid antigen presentation could represent a new therapeutical approach for patients. Sixty-six duodenal biopsies from 17 coeliac patients were cultured for 48 h with gluten or enzymatically-modified gluten (treated with human recombinant transglutaminase type 2 or bacterial transglutaminase, with or without lysine). Interferongamma, anti endomisium and anti transglutaminase IgA antibodies, lactate dehydrogenase and transglutaminase activity were measured in the culture medium. Transglutaminase type 2 expression was evaluated on biopsies by immunohistochemistry. Gluten and transglutaminase-treated gluten increased by 13-15 fold interferon gamma release, as well as antibodies, transglutaminase activity, and the immunohistochemical expression of transglutaminase type 2. Addition of lysine to the enzymatic modification of gluten normalized interferon gamma, antibodies, transglutaminase activity and immunohistochemical expression of transglutaminase type 2. Lactate dehydrogenase did not differ among the studied groups. Enzymatic modification of gluten by transglutaminase plus lysine prevents the immunologic effects on cultured duodenal biopsies from coeliac patients and could be tested as an alternative therapy in coeliac disease.},

As there is no precise data from our country in this regard, we investigated the prevalence of CD in patients presenting with abnormal LFT. METHODS: From 2003 to 2008, we measured IgA anti-tissue transglutaminase (t-TG) antibody (with ELISA technique) within the first-level screening steps for all patients presenting with abnormal LFT to three outpatient gastroenterology clinics in Isfahan, IRAN. All subjects with an IgA anti-tTG antibody value of >10 mu/ml (seropositive) were undergone upper gastrointestinal endoscopy and duodenal biopsy. Histopathological changes were assessed according to the Marsh classification. CD was defined as being seropositive with Marsh I or above in histopathology and having a good response to gluten free diet (GFD). RESULTS: During the study, 224 patients were evaluated, out of which, 10 patients (4.4%) were seropositive for CD. Duodenal biopsies were performed in eight patients and revealed six (2.7%) cases of Marsh I or above (four Marsh IIIA, two Marsh I), all of them had good response to GFD. The overall prevalence of CD among patients with hypertransaminasemia, autoimmune hepatitis, and cryptogenic cirrhosis was determined as 10.7% (3/28), 3.4% (2/59), and 5.3% (1/19), respectively. CONCLUSION: Serological screening with IgA anti-tTG antibody test should be routinely performed in patients presenting with abnormal LFT and especially those with chronic liver diseases including hypertransaminasemia, autoimmune hepatitis, and cryptogenic cirrhosis.},

According to the lack of data from our population in this regard, we determined the prevalence of CD in patients presenting with IDA to see if it is worthwhile to do a precise screening for CD in such patients. METHODS: This cross-sectional study was conducted on patients referred with IDA to Poursina Hakim Gastroenterology Clinic, Isfahan (IRAN). All included patients underwent upper gastrointestinal endoscopy and duodenal biopsy. Histopathological changes were assessed according to the Marsh classification. Also, patients were evaluated for IgA anti-tissue transglutaminase (t-TG) antibody with enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay (ELISA) technique. CD was defined as having Marsh II or above histopathology or being seropositive with Marsh I histopathology and having a good response to gluten free diet (GFD). RESULTS: During the study, 130 patients with the mean age of 35.5+/-13.7 (67.7% female [20.4% post-menopausal]) were undergone seropathological studies. According to histopathological study and a clinical response to GFD, 13 patients (10%) were ultimately diagnosed with CD. Nine patients (6.9%) were seropositive, from which, five patients (3.8%) were ultimately diagnosed as CD cases. IgA anti-tTG became negative in all of these patients after six months of GFD. CONCLUSION: CD should be considered in any adult patient presenting with unexplained IDA, even if not accompanied with gastrointestinal symptoms. Routine duodenal biopsy performed during diagnostic upper gastrointestinal endoscopy is worthwhile in order to investigate for CD as an underlying cause of IDA in adult patients.},

   abstract = {INTRODUCTION: The aim of this case report is to show how an oral condition, such as atrophic glossitis, can be the only clinical sign that allows an early diagnosis of celiac disease. CASE PRESENTATION: Atrophic glossitis was detected by a dentist during a first routine examination of the oral cavity of a 17-year-old Sardinian young woman and then differential diagnosis was carried out to identify the etiology of her tongue condition. Considering the high prevalence of celiac disease in the patient's birth area, the clinician took a blood sample to search for vitamin deficiency and immunological anomalies typically linked to celiac disease. Positive blood sample results allowed the patient to be referred to a gastroenterologist in order to perform a small intestine biopsy. The biopsy showed a strong atrophy of the intestinal villus so that it was possible to make a sure diagnosis of celiac disease. After five months on a gluten-free diet, the oral clinician was not able to find any signs of atrophic glossitis. CONCLUSIONS: Two important conclusions can be reached from this case report; first, the fundamental role played by the oral condition alone in finding and highlighting atypical forms of celiac disease and second, the importance of investigating systemic anomalies, in cases where there is a tongue condition such as atrophic glossitis and when it is impossible to identify local causes.},

   abstract = {OBJECTIVES: Celiac disease (CD) is an autoimmune disorder that can be divided into typical and atypical forms. Atypical forms can show extraintestinal manifestations among which oral signs are very frequent. Considering that the pathogenesis of CD is related to a positivity to specific HLA-DQB1 haplotypes, we tested whether the presence of the HLA-DQB1*02 allele could be a hypothetical cause of the development of oral manifestations. SUBJECTS AND METHODS: For this study was been examined the oral condition of 98 Sardinian patients, all affected by CD and all on a gluten-free diet for at least 1 year. Then was been determined each patient's HLA-DQB1 haplotype and compared these results with clinical information. RESULTS: The statistical analysis evidenced that the absence of the HLA-DQB1*02 allele predisposes to oral manifestations such as dental enamel defects (DED) and recurrent aphthous stomatitis (RAS) (Pvalue=5.98x10(-05), OR = 0.23, CI: (0.10 - 0.45) per each copy of the HLA allele). CONCLUSIONS: These results showed that the presence of the HLA-DQB1*02 allele influences the development of oral signs in a dose-dependent manner and also how the HLA haplotype connected to oral signs could have a fundamental role for the diagnosis of atypical forms of CD.},

   abstract = {BACKGROUND: Celiac disease (CD) is an autoimmune disease characterized by immunemediated inflammatory damage of the small intestinal mucosa, precipitated by the ingestion of gluten-containing foods. Since human leucocyte antigen DQ2 (HLA-DQ2) is a marker of nonresponsiveness to hepatits B virus (HBV) vaccine, CD may also be associated with this nonresponsiveness. OBJECTIVES: The aim of this study was to compare the responses to HBV vaccine between children with CD and healthy children. We also investigated the relationship between the patients' responses to hepatitis B vaccine, the clinical presentation of CD, and dietary compliance in the patients. PATIENTS AND METHODS: We recruited 52 children with CD and 20 age- and sex-matched healthy children who received HBV vaccination according to the standard immunization schedule. The production of specific antihepatitis B surface antigen (HBsAg) antibodies was evaluated in all patients and control participants. Subjects with less than 10 IU/L anti-HBs were consided nonresponders to the vaccination. RESULTS: 31 of the 52 patients (59.6%) were female and 21 (40.4%) were male. The mean age of the CD patients was 10.7 +/- 4 years (range, 4-18 years). Anti-HBs titers were positive in 32 (61.5%) patients and negative in 20 (38.5%) patients, while they were positive in 18 (90%) of the children in the control group (P < 0.05). We found statistically significant differences between negative anti-HBs titers, clinical presentation of CD, and dietary compliance in patients with CD (P < 0.05). CONCLUSIONS: Nonresponsiveness to hepatitis B vaccination was more frequently found in children with CD than in the control group. Therefore, the response to HBV vaccination should be investigated in children with CD, and a different immunization schedule may need to be developed. Further, compliance to the prescribed gluten-free diet (GFD) may improve the immune response to HBV vaccination in children with CD.},

Its prevalence in Europe and the USA is 0.5 to 1%. AIM: To analyze epidemiological aspects and degree of compliance with gluten-free diet (GFD) among Chilean individuals with CD. MATERIAL AND METHODS: Subjects with confirmed or suspected CD were invited to answer an online survey published on the web at www.fundacionconvivir.cl. The answers were reinforced with a telephone interview. RESULTS: The survey was answered by 1212 subjects (79% females). Median age at diagnosis was 25.8 years (range 1 to 84 years), with a bimodal curve with two peaks at less than 3 years and at 20 to 40 years of age. The diagnosis was made only by serologic markers in 9%, only by intestinal biopsy in 17.5%, and by a combination of both methods in 70%o. Conditions associated with CD were reported by 30% > of subjects and 20% > had relatives with CD. The GFD was strictly adhered to by 70% >, occasionally by 27% > and never by 3% >. Seventy five percent of subjects with a strict adherence to GFD had a favorable clinical response compared with 42% > of those with incomplete or lack of adherence (odds ratio 4.0, 95% > confidence intervals 2.8-5.7p < 0.01). CONCLUSIONS: In 30% of respondents, the diagnosis of CD was not confirmed according to international guidelines that require serology and duodenal biopsy. One third of subjects recognized a poor compliance with GFD. Those with a strict adherence to it had a more favorable clinical course. However, 25% > did not experience a clinical improvement despite a strict GFD, a finding which requires further study.},

   abstract = {PURPOSE OF REVIEW: To describe whether a gluten-free diet (GFD) is indicated in Marsh I gluten-sensitive enteropathy where gastrointestinal symptoms are not present. Arguments are provided to prescribe a GFD to manage extraintestinal symptoms. By contrast, there are not enough reasons to prescribe a GFD to prevent long-term complications. RECENT FINDINGS: Population-based and prospective observational studies have found that lymphocytic duodenosis may be due to not just gluten-sensitive enteropathy but also due to other aetiologic factors. Marsh I type lesions may be the cause of iron-deficiency anaemia of unknown aetiology which is reverted by a GFD. A similar effect seems to occur with bone mineralization and hypertransaminasemia. The beneficial influence of a GFD reducing lymphoma and coeliac disease-related mortality remains controversial. SUMMARY: An appropriate differential diagnosis of the lymphocytic duodenosis is essential before a GFD is indicated. As a third of patients remained undiagnosed, in spite of genetic study and specific coeliac serology, flow cytometry and transglutaminase antibodies in duodenal tissue may be helpful in establishing gluten-sensitive enteropathy diagnosis. Future studies should assess whether lymphoma risk is reduced by a GFD in Marsh I patients. Also a more precise benefit in bone mineralization in this setting is needed.},

We discuss the diagnosis that was established by contrast-enhanced spiral computed tomography scan and magnetic resonance angiography. Once diagnosed the patient was treated conservatively by enteral high caloric diet in order to obtain a weight gain, however as it did not relieve the symptomatology of pain and vomit we opted for a surgical procedure. The therapeutic options were reviewed, highlighting the laparoscopic approach, which was the one we chose since it provides a less invasive procedure than open surgery but is an equally effective method of treatment.},

   abstract = {To meet the principles of screening as described by Wilson and Jungner a disease must be common, a significant health burden, detectable and treatable. The key lies in the early detection and alteration of the natural history of disease. Coeliac disease affects 1 in 100 people. Despite this patients frequently have delays in diagnosis or may remain undetected. There is an associated morbidity and mortality which can be effectively treated by simple means of a gluten-free diet. For these reasons coeliac disease has been suggested as appropriate for mass screening. However, there are caveats to this: a complex clinical spectrum, a natural history that is imperfectly understood, overestimation of morbidity and mortality, poor adherence to treatment, and costs of service provision may argue against the time being right for mass screening. This review article provides the most contemporary overview and reference base to allow any clinician to understand the benefits or limitations of a screening programme for adult coeliac disease.},

   abstract = {Celiac disease (CD) is frequently associated with neurological disorders, but very few reports concern the association with ischemic stroke. A 26-year-old woman affected by CD with secondary amenorrhea, carrier of a homozygous 5,10-methylenetetrahydrofolate reductase mutation with hyperhomocysteinemia, was affected by two occipital ischemic strokes within a period of 5 mo. At the time of the second stroke, while she was being treated with folic acid, acetylsalicylic acid and a gluten-free diet, she had left hemianopsia, left hemiparesthesias, and gait imbalance. Brain magnetic resonance imaging showed a subacute right occipital ischemic lesion, which was extended to the dorsal region of the right thalamus and the ipsilateral thalamo-capsular junction. Antitransglutaminase and deamidated gliadin peptide antibodies were no longer present, while antinuclear antibodies, antineuronal antibodies and immune circulating complexes were only slightly elevated. Since the patient was taking folic acid, her homocysteine levels were almost normal and apparently not sufficient alone to explain the clinical event. A conventional cerebral angiography showed no signs of vasculitis. Finally, rare causes of occipital stroke in young patients, such as Fabry's disease and mitochondrial myopathy, encephalomyopathy, lactic acidosis and stroke-like symptoms, were also excluded by appropriate tests. Thus, the most probable cause for the recurrent strokes in this young woman remained CD, although the mechanisms involved are still unknown. The two main hypotheses concern malabsorption (with consequent deficiency of vitamins known to exert neurotrophic and neuroprotective effects) and immune-mediated mechanisms. CD should be kept in mind in the differential diagnosis of ischemic stroke in young patients.},

   abstract = {BACKGROUND: Several studies have shown the prevalence of celiac disease (CD) to be around 1% in Iran, which is similar to the worldwide prevalence. There is scant information on occult CD in apparently healthy school age children. This study, as the first such study in Iran, aims to determine the prevalence of occult CD in healthy Iranian school age children. METHODS: In this cross-sectional study, we screened healthy school age children for CD by serum IgA and IgA anti-tissue transglutaminase antibody (tTG) levels. Measurement of these antibodies was by enzyme linked immunosorbent assay. A recheck of positive tTG tests was performed and patients who tested positive underwent endoscopic duodenal biopsies. The biopsy samples were scored according to the Marsh classification by an experienced pathologist. RESULTS: A total of 634 children (314 males, 320 females; mean age: 12.8 years) were included in the study. All children and/or their parents completed a questionnaire and children underwent an initial physical examination to determine study eligibility. Positive serum tTG was noted in 3 (0.5%; 2 females) out of 634 patients. Duodenal biopsies were consistent with CD in these 3 subjects. The mean age of patients with CD was 14.3 years (range: 12-17 years). The female to male ratio was 2:1. These cases had no signs and symptoms, but a gluten-free diet was recommended according to pathologic changes in their small bowels and results of the tTG test. CONCLUSION: The prevalence of occult CD in these children is 0.5%, which is half of the prevalence of CD in Iranian adults. The anti-tTG concentration at initial serological CD screening is highly informative in determining occult cases of CD. The question is whether all non-symptomatic cases should be treated with a gluten-free diet or not.},

Qualitative expression of 16 KIR genes was determined in biopsies from 22 CD patients at diagnosis and after >2 years on a gluten-free diet (GFD). Quantitative expression analysis of KIR2DL4, KIR3DL1, KIR3DL3, and KLRC2 (a marker of an NK-reprogrammed T-cell subpopulation augmented in CD) was performed in 35 additional CD biopsy pairs and 14 non-CD control biopsies. No specific KIR expression profile was observed in CD. KIR3DL1 was more frequently expressed in active CD compared with GFD (p = 0.0312) and controls (p = 0.0008), with slightly increased levels in active disease. KLRC2 was overexpressed in active (p = 0.0037) and GFD (p = 0.0469) patients compared with non-CD controls and coexpressed with KIR3DL1. Results suggest the participation of KIR3DL1 overexpression in the overall immune activation seen in CD mucosa, which could be partly explained by the NK-like T-cell subpopulation increase.},

   abstract = {Celiac disease (CD), a common heritable chronic inflammatory condition of the small intestine caused by permanent intolerance to gluten/gliadin (prolamin), is characterized by a complex interplay between genetic and environmental factors. Developments in proteomics have provided an important contribution to the understanding of the biochemical and immunological aspects of the disease and the mechanisms involved in toxicity of prolamins. It has been demonstrated that some gliadin peptides resistant to complete proteolytic digestion may directly affect intestinal cell structure and functions by modulating gene expression and oxidative stress. In recent years, the creation of the two research fields Nutrigenomics and Nutrigenetics, has enabled the elucidation of some interactions between diet, nutrients and genes. Various dietary components including long chain omega-3 fatty acids, plant flavonoids, and carotenoids have been demonstrated to modulate oxidative stress, gene expression and production of inflammatory mediators. Therefore their adoption could preserve intestinal barrier integrity, play a protective role against toxicity of gliadin peptides and have a role in nutritional therapy of celiac disease.},

   abstract = {Paraoxonase-1 (PON1) plays an antioxidant and anti-inflammatory role. Aim of the study was to investigate the alteration of paraoxonase-1 activity in celiac disease (CD), an intestinal disorder characterized by toxic injury exerted by gluten peptides. Activities of PON1, levels of biochemical markers of lipid peroxidation and total antioxidant capacity were evaluated in serum obtained from 27 celiac patients (11 at diagnosis, 16 treated with gluten free diet) and 25 healthy subjects. Moreover, the serum susceptibility of Cu(2+)-induced lipid peroxidation was investigated in controls and patients. The results showed a lower PON1 activity in serum of both groups of celiac patients with respect to control subjects. PON1 activity in CD was related with markers of disease severity and was negatively correlated with the levels of lipid hydroperoxide and with the susceptibility of serum to lipid peroxidation induced in vitro by metal ions. The alteration of PON1 activity and markers of lipid peroxidation realized at lower extent in patients who were on a gluten-free diet.},

   abstract = {The celiac disease is traditionally viewed as the children's disease with a typical form accompanied mainly by intestinal symptoms and malabsorption. This opinion is still generally accepted by the medical community. Findings based on the area-wide screening show that the prevalence has risen from the original 1 : 1 000-1 500 to 1 : 70-550. The average prevalence in the western countries is nearly 1 : 100. The prevalence of the celiac disease in the Czech republic is estimated to be approximately 1 : 200-250. It means that the number of people in the Czech republic who are likely to be affected is about 40,000-50,000 people. Currently only 10-15% of the total number of the ill people are diagnosed and monitored. Adult patients represent the main diagnostic problem because their clinical pictures are individual and the main symptoms are atypical (nonenteral). These are anaemia (mainly sideropnic), early/premature osteoporosis, herpetiformic (Duhring) dermatitis, polyneurititis, ataxia, depression, behavioural disorders, menstrual cycle disorders and infertility. Therefore our attention is currently focused on the screening of these groups of subjects. The purpose of our study was to check the frequency of the celiac disease with patients with diagnosed osteoporosis and osteopenia. In our study we have confirmed the assumption that the prevalence ofthe celiac disease in the group of subjects was 1 : 50, which means that 2.2% of patients with osteoporosis and osteopenia are affected by celiac sprue and therefore screening examination of these patients with the subsequent causal treatment (gluten-free diet) is recommended.},

   abstract = {OBJECTIVES: Coeliac disease (CD) is an autoimmune condition managed by a lifelong therapeutic gluten-free diet. Previous research suggests that the chronicity of CD, the limitations imposed by the gluten-free diet, and the risk of other associated diseases can have a negative impact on health-related quality of life (HRQoL) and psychological well-being. The aim of this study was to explore the illness perceptions and self-efficacy beliefs of adults with CD in the United Kingdom and to report their subjective levels of HRQoL and psychological well-being. DESIGN: The study employed a cross-sectional postal questionnaire design. METHOD: Participants (n= 288) were adults with CD recruited via Coeliac UK. Measures of well-being, HRQoL, self-efficacy, illness perceptions, and dietary self-management were analysed. Preliminary descriptive and univariate procedures were employed before bivariate tests of association or difference were carried out. Backward stepwise multiple regression analysis was used to investigate the predictive strength of variables on well-being, quality of life, and self-efficacy. Logistic regression was used to look at the influence of variables on adherence. RESULTS. Results indicate that HRQoL and psychological well-being were comparable to those found in previous related studies. Participants with weak beliefs in the serious consequences of CD and poorer emotional reactions to the condition had a greater likelihood of having enhanced HRQoL, improved psychological well-being, and higher self-efficacy. Strong beliefs in personal control and a greater perceived understanding of CD were associated with greater self-efficacy. CONCLUSIONS: Perceived self-efficacy and illness perceptions could play a role in informing psychological interventions for individuals with CD.},

   abstract = {OBJECTIVE: To review the evaluation and management of skeletal health in patients with celiac disease (CD), and to make recommendations on screening, diagnosis, treatment and follow-up of low bone mineral density (BMD) in CD patients. METHODS: A multidisciplinary team developed clinically relevant questions for review. An electronic search of the literature was conducted using the MEDLINE and EMBASE databases from 1996 to 2010. All original studies, reviews and guidelines, both pediatric and adult, were included. A document summarizing the results of the review and proposed recommendations was prepared and underwent multiple revisions until consensus was reached. RESULTS: At diagnosis, approximately one-third of adult CD patients have osteoporosis, one-third have osteopenia and one-third have normal BMD. Children with CD have low bone mass at diagnosis. Adult and pediatric CD patients are at increased risk of fractures. DISCUSSION: For adults, serum calcium, albumin, 25(OH) vitamin D3, parathyroid hormone and 24 h urine calcium testing should be performed at diagnosis; patients with 'classic' CD and those at risk for osteoporosis should undergo a dual x-ray absorptiometry scan. An abnormal baseline dual x-ray absorptiometry scan should be repeated one to two years after initiation of a gluten-free diet (GFD). For children, BMD should be assessed one year after diagnosis if GFD adherence is not strict. A GFD is the most important treatment for bone loss. Supplemental antiresorptives may be justified in those who remain at high fracture risk (eg, postmenopausal women, older men) after implementation of a GFD. CONCLUSION: Current evidence does not support the screening of all CD patients for low BMD at diagnosis. Follow-up BMD assessment should be performed one to two years after initiation of a GFD.},

   abstract = {AIMS: To describe the prevalence of potential celiac disease (pot-CD) in young patients with type 1 diabetes mellitus (T1DM) and characterize their clinical features. METHODS: This cross-sectional multicenter study involved 8717 T1DM patients from 31 Italian centers. Information was collected on the total number of T1DM patients, CD patients and pot-CD patients. The following data were collected on pot-CD patients: gender, age at T1DM diagnosis, age at the first CD serological positivity, presence of CD-related symptoms, presence of other autoimmune disorders and treatment with gluten free diet (GFD). One thousand-three-hundred-sixty-one patients who were positive for CD serology were the control group. RESULTS: CD serological positivity was found in 7.2% T1DM patients. Prevalence of pot-CD was 12.2% (n=77) among CD positive patients: symptoms were present in 12/77; a third autoimmune disorder was found in 15 patients. Prevalence of pot-CD in the control population was 8.4% (n=114; p=0.005). No difference was found with regard to clinical features. Only few symptomatic patients were on GFD both in T1DM and control patients. CONCLUSIONS: A higher prevalence of pot-CD was found in T1DM patients, that may be ascribed to the routine screening, although the influence of genetic factors cannot be excluded.},

   abstract = {Collagenous sprue is a small bowel mucosal lesion that has been historically associated with persistent diarrhea, progressive weight loss and severe malabsorption causing multiple nutrient deficiencies. A severe to variably severe mucosal lesion with distinct subepithelial collagen deposits occurs. Celiac disease has been intimately linked to collagenous sprue and, similar to celiac disease, small bowel ulceration, perforation and lymphoma may complicate the clinical course of collagenous sprue. In collagenous sprue, concomitant collagen deposits may also occur in gastric or colonic mucosal sites (or both), indicating that this unusual mucosal process may be very heterogeneous and far more extensive in the intestinal tract than previously appreciated. Moreover, reports of diagnosis during infancy suggest that the natural history of the disorder could be more prolonged than is currently appreciated. Finally, the collagen deposits, per se, may be due to different causes and, in some, even represent a novel paraneoplastic histopathological marker. Future studies are needed to more precisely define molecular and genetic biomarkers that identify homogeneous groups and permit the development of improved treatment strategies for this increasingly recognized disorder.},

About 0.5-1% of most populations studied are affected, with up to 2% in Finland. In families, specifically first-degree relatives, up to 20% may have the disease. Despite increased awareness among physicians and the public, celiac disease is still markedly under-diagnosed at all ages, including the elderly. Although serological screening is now widely used, celiac disease remains a biopsy-defined disorder, and a critical element to the correct diagnosis is documentation of a response to a gluten-free diet (since it is a gluten-sensitive disease). Sometimes, after the diagnosis has been established with a treatment response, changes re-appear and seem resistant to a gluten-free diet. Usually, poor or limited diet compliance, possibly from an unrecognized gluten source is responsible. In others, another superimposed cause, such as an infectious agent, could be important. Finally, another associated disease causing similar clinical and biopsy features or, alternatively, a complicating disorder may develop, such as a lymphoma. Some with biopsy features suggestive of celiac disease may not respond to a gluten-free diet. These may not have celiac disease at all, but instead, a sprue-like intestinal disease, or so-called unclassified sprue.},

In order to produce oats that are safe for all celiac patients, the following topics should be addressed: selection of oat cultivars with low avenin content, research on such recombinant varieties of oats, development of assay methods to detect avenins in oat products, guidelines for the agricultural processing of oats and the manufacture of oat products, as well as guidelines for following up with celiac patients who consume oats.},

   abstract = {OBJECTIVE: The aim of this study was to evaluate eating habits and nutritional behaviors of women in the perimenopausal period with celiac disease diagnosed within the last 4 years. MATERIAL AND METHOD: The study covered a group of 26 women, at the age of 51-54 years, with celiac disease diagnosed in the last 4 years and staying on a gluten-free diet for 6 months to 4 years and agreed to participate in this studies. Information of nutrition were collected from the women, who, after an appropriate instruction, recorded the timing, type and amount of food consumed in the three days a week, selected at random. The amount of consumed portions was defined on the basis of the "Book of portions, products and dishes". The menus (78) were recorded in April and May. Collected data were prepared, based on a computer program Dietetyk 2009 Prof. RESULTS: The analysis of results achieved in this study enabled concluding that--from the viewpoint of the diagnosed disease--the nutritional patterns of the women were very appropriate. However, it failed to meet basic nutritional guidelines, which was reflected in, among other things, unsatisfactory intake of vegetables, fruits, oils and water, and in excessive intake of protein of animal origin. In addition, it did not cover demands resulting from the perimenopausal period the surveyed women were in, which is likely to facilitate, e.g. disorders in lipid metabolism and water-mineral balance, as well as development of osteoporosis. CONCLUSIONS: The general picture of behaviors, including the nutritional ones, pointed to a strong predominance of the diagnosed disease but also to the need of compensating for the resultant restrictions, with the latter being perceived by the surveyed women as health-promoting actions.},

Malabsorption syndrome may be responsible for weight loss, diarrhea, osteomalacia, and vitamins deficiency. Herein we report a patient with coeliac disease (CD) who presented with osteomalacia and psoriasis without classical symptoms of CD. A 25-year-old North African Tunisian white woman was admitted to the hospital because of a 1-year history of bone pain, weight loss and weakness. She had cutaneous psoriasis on dermatologic examination. She had also anemia, hypocalcemia and pathological fracture. She was diagnosed to have osteomalacia on the basis of clinical, biological and radiological findings. Further investigations revealed the presence of antiglutaminase antibodies, and histopathologic findings of the duodenal biopsy were consistent with celiac disease. The patient showed a fast response to gluten-free diet, and full recovery with calcium and vitamin D replacement. Coeliac disease is frequently misdiagnosed leading to major complications such as osteolamacia. In the other hand, osteomalacia can still be the presenting feature of undiagnosed celiac disease. Association between osteomalacia and cutaneous psoriasis is rarely reported.},

   abstract = {Ingestion of dietary fat stimulates production of the small-intestinal satiety factors oleoylethanolamide (OEA) and N-palmitoyl-phosphatidylethanolamine (NPPE), which reduce food intake through a combination of local (OEA) and systemic (NPPE) actions. Previous studies have shown that sympathetic innervation of the gut is necessary for duodenal infusions of fat to induce satiety, suggesting that sympathetic activity may engage small-intestinal satiety signals such as OEA and NPPE. In the present study, we show that surgical resection of the sympathetic celiac-superior mesenteric ganglion complex, which sends projections to the upper gut, abolishes feeding-induced OEA production in rat small-intestinal cells. These effects are accounted for by suppression of OEA biosynthesis, and are mimicked by administration of the selective beta2-adrenergic receptor antagonist ICI-118,551. We further show that sympathetic ganglionectomy or pharmacological blockade of beta2-adrenergic receptors prevents NPPE release into the circulation. In addition, sympathetic ganglionectomy increases meal frequency and lowers satiety ratio, and these effects are corrected by pharmacological administration of OEA. The results suggest that sympathetic activity controls fat-induced satiety by enabling the coordinated production of local (OEA) and systemic (NPPE) satiety signals in the small intestine.},

   abstract = {Previous genome-wide scans of positive natural selection in humans have identified a number of non-neutrally evolving genes that play important roles in skin pigmentation, metabolism, or immune function. Recent studies have also shown that a genome-wide pattern of local adaptation can be detected by identifying correlations between patterns of allele frequencies and environmental variables. Despite these observations, the degree to which natural selection is primarily driven by adaptation to local environments, and the role of pathogens or other ecological factors as selective agents, is still under debate. To address this issue, we correlated the spatial allele frequency distribution of a large sample of SNPs from 55 distinct human populations to a set of environmental factors that describe local geographical features such as climate, diet regimes, and pathogen loads. In concordance with previous studies, we detected a significant enrichment of genic SNPs, and particularly non-synonymous SNPs associated with local adaptation. Furthermore, we show that the diversity of the local pathogenic environment is the predominant driver of local adaptation, and that climate, at least as measured here, only plays a relatively minor role. While background demography by far makes the strongest contribution in explaining the genetic variance among populations, we detected about 100 genes which show an unexpectedly strong correlation between allele frequencies and pathogenic environment, after correcting for demography. Conversely, for diet regimes and climatic conditions, no genes show a similar correlation between the environmental factor and allele frequencies. This result is validated using low-coverage sequencing data for multiple populations. Among the loci targeted by pathogen-driven selection, we found an enrichment of genes associated to autoimmune diseases, such as celiac disease, type 1 diabetes, and multiples sclerosis, which lends credence to the hypothesis that some susceptibility alleles for autoimmune diseases may be maintained in human population due to past selective processes.},

The monitoring was carried out within the context of their routine everyday diet regimen. The daily intake of gliadin in the diet was quantified on the basis of gliadin determination in their current daily food. The gluten-free diet was followed for 30 days. The patients were taking regular daily meals, drinks, and sometimes medicines or food supplements. The patients were provided with instructions, survey forms, digital scales, polyethylen bottles and sacks. The patients took out the stipulated amount, which served as a sample of each of their daily meals. The samples included both homemade meals as well as commercial products. The content of gliadin in daily meal was determined by the sandwich ELISA method. The daily gliadin intake was calculated on the base of the reported amount of meals ingested. 1,900 food samples were analyzed within the framework of this study. Several contaminated commercial foods were found; nevertheless this fact did not influence the otherwise satisfactory overall picture of the daily gliadin intake by the patients followed. The results in 14 patients revealed a satisfactory adherence to the gluten-free diet. It was proved that conscientiousness and awareness on the part of coeliac patients, or those taking care of them, is of paramount importance in determining the choice of foods comprising a gluten-free diet.},

   abstract = {Phenylketonuria, galactosemia and celiac disease are disorders in which elimination diets are the only known therapy, which reverses many clinical manifestations of acute phase in the patients. Unfortunately, most of them develop long-term complications, including bone turnover impairment and low bone mineral density. These disturbances are not only observed in adulthood but also in childhood and adolescence. Insufficient accumulation of peak bone mass in these periods is a risk factor for osteoporosis and fractures in later life. The pathological mechanisms leading to a diminished bone mineral content in these disorders are not well known. The patients might be at risk for a decreased bone mineral content because of either dietary deficiencies secondary to the elimination diets and/or unknown intrinsic factors. This article overviews bone metabolism disturbances in phenylketonuria, galactosemia and celiac disease during childhood and adolescence, when growth and bone turnover are most intensive. The available data and own results concerning bone markers in children with these disorders and proposal for the prevention of osteoporosis in pediatric patients treated with elimination diets are discussed.},

   abstract = {Celiac disease (CD) is frequently diagnosed in patients with type 1 diabetes (T1D), and T1D patients can exhibit Abs against tissue transglutaminase, the auto-antigen in CD. Thus, gliadin, the trigger in CD, has been suggested to have a role in T1D pathogenesis. The objective of this study was to investigate whether gliadin contributes to enteropathy and insulitis in NOD-DQ8 mice, an animal model that does not spontaneously develop T1D. Gliadin-sensitized NOD-DQ8 mice developed moderate enteropathy, intraepithelial lymphocytosis, and barrier dysfunction, but not insulitis. Administration of anti-CD25 mAbs before gliadin-sensitization induced partial depletion of CD25(+)Foxp3(+) T cells and led to severe insulitis, but did not exacerbate mucosal dysfunction. CD4(+) T cells isolated from pancreatic lymph nodes of mice that developed insulitis showed increased proliferation and proinflammatory cytokines after incubation with gliadin but not with BSA. CD4(+) T cells isolated from nonsensitized controls did not response to gliadin or BSA. In conclusion, gliadin sensitization induced moderate enteropathy in NOD-DQ8 mice. However, insulitis development required gliadin-sensitization and partial systemic depletion of CD25(+)Foxp3(+) T cells. This humanized murine model provides a mechanistic link to explain how the mucosal intolerance to a dietary protein can lead to insulitis in the presence of partial regulatory T cell deficiency.},

Its has a wide clinical spectrum of manifestations, particularly varied in adult patients, in whom, because of their frequent negative serology and mild, nonspecific symptoms, there is a considerable delay in diagnosis. The intestinal lesion caused by CD leads to various deficiencies of nutrients, vitamins, and dietary minerals, with ferropenia, vitamin B12, folic acid, and fat-soluble vitamin deficiencies being especially frequent. The deficiencies, together with dairy intolerance, cause low bone density and an increased risk of fractures. Treatment using a gluten-free diet (GFD) does involve certain complications, since gluten is found in up to 70% of manufactured food products and manufacturing regulations are not standard in all countries. In addition, certain nutrient deficiencies require specific management. This article reviews the nutritional aspects of CD and provides practical guidelines to correct these deficiencies and to ensure optimum GFD compliance.},

   abstract = {Celiac disease (CD) is a chronic inflammatory enteropathy caused by the ingestion of gluten. A safe and efficient but unpleasant treatment exists for CD in form of a strict gluten-free diet. Thus, there is a need for new treatment strategies, which are based on the improved and advanced understanding of the pathophysiology of CD. The first strategy consists in reducing or even eliminating major antigenic motifs in gluten, responsible for the inflammatory reaction. The use of less immunogenic wheat was suggested but this seems rather difficult to realize. However, a complete digestion of the immunogenic parts of gluten looks very promising. This can be obtained by the use of polymers, capable to sequester gluten proteins or even better via the exogenous administration of propyl-endopeptidases, with two different enzymes under development. Another approach could be the use of inhibitors of tissue transglutaminase, a strategy which is under clinical investigation. Alternatively, inhibition of the site of liaison of immunostimulatory peptides with HLA molecules was suggested and is also under investigation in vivo. For patients suffering from refractory sprue, the inhibition of IL15 might be of therapeutic interest with the hope to improve the fatal outcome of many of these patients. However, the ultimate treatment approach is in form of prevention and the role of infectious agents, such as Rotavirus, in disease onset has to be considered.},

   abstract = {BACKGROUND: Celiac sprue (gluten sensitive enteropathy) is an autoimmune disease which is hereditary and its pathology mainly bases on immunologic intolerance to gluten. It has a vast variety of signs and symptoms and its clinical features range from a silent disease to a typical gastrointestinal disorder. In this study we reviewed and summarized some other related issues about this disease and its relation with infertility. CASE: The case is a 26 years old lady who had referred to a gynecologist because of infertility for 2 years and later it revealed that she has celiac sprue. CONCLUSION: Screening for its silent or subtle types especially among suspicious cases such as unexplained infertility seems to be a cost effective action. Meanwhile, in time administration of a gluten-free diet can lead to an almost complete cure.},

   abstract = {BACKGROUND: Research is intense to find wheat of low or null toxicity for patients with celiac disease (CD). Among candidates, there are diploid wheat species. OBJECTIVE: We compared the immunological properties of 2 lines of diploid monococcum wheat (Triticum monococcum ssp. monococcum), Monlis and ID331, with those of common wheat (Triticum aestivum). DESIGN: Interferon-gamma production and the proliferation of intestinal gliadin-specific T cell lines and clones were measured as evidence of T cell activation by peptic and tryptic (PT) digests of gliadins from 2 monococcum lines. Furthermore, organ cultures of jejunal biopsies from 28 CD patients were set up to assess the effects of PT gliadin on innate and adaptive immune response by using immunohistochemistry. RESULTS: Monlis and ID331 induced interferon-gamma production and proliferation in celiac mucosal T cells. In organ cultures, Monlis PT digest induced a significant increase of IL-15 epithelial expression and crypt enterocyte proliferation, whereas ID331 had no effect. Both monococcum lines caused intraepithelial T cell infiltration and lamina propria T cell activation. CONCLUSIONS: Our data show that the monococcum lines Monlis and ID331 activate the CD T cell response and suggest that these lines are toxic for celiac patients. However, ID331 is likely to be less effective in inducing CD because of its inability to activate the innate immune pathways.},

   abstract = {BACKGROUND: In patients with treated celiac disease (CD), the ingestion of gluten traces contained in gluten-free (GF) wheat substitutes (eg, GF bread, flour, and pasta) could cause persisting intestinal mucosal damage. OBJECTIVE: The objective was to evaluate the proportion of CD patients at risk of mucosal damage due to the consumption of GF products in 4 European countries (Italy, Spain, Germany, and Norway). DESIGN: A probabilistic modeling approach was used to assess the risk of gluten intake at the population level. The input variables were 1) consumption of GF products, 2) concentration of gluten traces in GF products determined by the sandwich R5 ELISA method, and 3) the gluten threshold for mucosal damage of 10 to 50 mg/d. Different population and product availability scenarios were examined for risk assessment. RESULTS: The gluten content of 205 commercially available GF products ranged between <5 and 27.8 mg/kg. Overall, 99.5% of the analyzed samples had a gluten concentration <20 mg/kg. Most (94%) had a gluten concentration below the limit of quantification (5 mg/kg). The mean percentage of the CD European population at risk of mucosal damage resulting from consumption of GF products ranged between 0.01 (Germany) and 0.15 (Italy) and remained very low, even in the worst-case scenario (<1%). CONCLUSIONS: The adoption of a single gluten threshold (20 mg/kg) for gluten contamination is suggested. GF products in Europe constitute a very safe option for patients with CD. The dietary follow-up of CD patients should focus on other potential sources of gluten contamination.},

   abstract = {Recognition of food components that induce functional gut symptoms in patient's functional bowel disorders (FBD) has been challenging. Food directly or indirectly provides considerable afferent input into the enteric nervous system. There is an altered relationship between the afferent input and perception/efferent response in FBD. Defining the nature of food-related stimuli may provide a means of minimizing such an input and gut symptoms. Using this premise, reducing the intake of FODMAPs (fermentable oligo-, di-, and mono-saccharides and polyols)--poorly absorbed short-chain carbohydrates that, by virtue of their small molecular size and rapid fermentability, will distend the intestinal lumen with liquid and gas--improves symptoms in the majority of patients. Well-developed methodologies to deliver the diet via dietician-led education are available. Another abundant source of afferent input is natural and added food chemicals (such as salicylates, amines, and glutamates). Studies are needed to assess the efficacy of the low food chemical dietary approach. A recent placebo-controlled trial of FODMAP-poor gluten provided the first valid evidence that non-celiac gluten intolerance might actually exist, but its prevalence and underlying mechanisms require elucidation. Food choice via the low FODMAP and potentially other dietary strategies is now a realistic and efficacious therapeutic approach for functional gut symptoms.},

   abstract = {BACKGROUND & AIMS: Celiac disease (CD) is characterized by an inflammatory response to wheat gluten, rye, and barley proteins. Fermentation of wheat flour with sourdough lactobacilli and fungal proteases decreases the concentration of gluten. We evaluated the safety of daily administration of baked goods made from this hydrolyzed form of wheat flour to patients with CD. METHODS: Patients were randomly assigned to consumption of 200 g per day of natural flour baked goods (NFBG) (80,127 ppm gluten; n = 6), extensively hydrolyzed flour baked goods (S1BG) (2480 ppm residual gluten; n = 2), or fully hydrolyzed baked goods (S2BG) (8 ppm residual gluten; n = 5) for 60 days. RESULTS: Two of the 6 patients who consumed NFBG discontinued the challenge because of symptoms; all had increased levels of anti-tissue transglutaminase (tTG) antibodies and small bowel deterioration. The 2 patients who ate the S1BG goods had no clinical complaints but developed subtotal atrophy. The 5 patients who ate the S2BG had no clinical complaints; their levels of anti-tTG antibodies did not increase, and their Marsh grades of small intestinal mucosa did not change. CONCLUSIONS: A 60-day diet of baked goods made from hydrolyzed wheat flour, manufactured with sourdough lactobacilli and fungal proteases, was not toxic to patients with CD. A combined analysis of serologic, morphometric, and immunohistochemical parameters is the most accurate method to assess new therapies for this disorder.},

   abstract = {Celiac disease (CD) is one of the most common diseases, resulting from both environmental (gluten) and genetic factors [human leukocyte antigen (HLA) and non-HLA genes]. The prevalence of CD has been estimated to approximate 0.5%-1% in different parts of the world. However, the population with diabetes, autoimmune disorder or relatives of CD individuals have even higher risk for the development of CD, at least in part, because of shared HLA typing. Gliadin gains access to the basal surface of the epithelium, and interact directly with the immune system, via both trans- and para-cellular routes. From a diagnostic perspective, symptoms may be viewed as either "typical" or "atypical". In both positive serological screening results suggestive of CD, should lead to small bowel biopsy followed by a favourable clinical and serological response to the gluten-free diet (GFD) to confirm the diagnosis. Positive anti-tissue transglutaminase antibody or anti-endomysial antibody during the clinical course helps to confirm the diagnosis of CD because of their over 99% specificities when small bowel villous atrophy is present on biopsy. Currently, the only treatment available for CD individuals is a strict life-long GFD. A greater understanding of the pathogenesis of CD allows alternative future CD treatments to hydrolyse toxic gliadin peptide, prevent toxic gliadin peptide absorption, blockage of selective deamidation of specific glutamine residues by tissue, restore immune tolerance towards gluten, modulation of immune response to dietary gliadin, and restoration of intestinal architecture.},

   abstract = {Identifying disease-associated variants can improve the predictive models of disease risk and provide mechanistic insights into disease development. Coeliac disease (CD) is the only autoimmune trait with a known environmental trigger, which makes it an excellent model for studying the complexity of genetic and environmental factors in the development of autoimmunity. In this review, we will focus on the genetic loci that have recently been associated with CD and that contain genes involved in innate and adaptive immunity. Some of these loci are shared with other immune-mediated diseases, suggesting an overlap of the genetic mechanisms involved in the development of such diseases. Some therapies, e.g. tumour necrosis factor inhibitors or a gluten-free diet, are already proving effective for more than one autoimmune disease. Follow-up of individuals with a high genetic risk of CD and other autoimmune diseases could help to elucidate the role of environmental factors (such as infectious agents or alterations in the microbiome) and prevent disease development.},

METHODS: We used ELISA assays for anti-GAD and for serological markers of gluten sensitivity. Patients were recruited from clinics based at the Royal Hallamshire hospital, Sheffield, UK. Patients with gluten sensitivity were followed up after the introduction of a gluten-free diet and serological testing was repeated. RESULTS: Six of seven (86%) patients with SPS were positive for anti-GAD, mean titre 109 U/ml; This compared with 9/90 (11%) patients with idiopathic sporadic ataxia, mean titre 32 U/ml, 16/40 (40%) patients with gluten ataxia, mean titre 25 U/ml, and 6/10 patients with type 1 diabetes only, mean titre 8 U/ml. None of 32 patients with celiac disease only, and of 40 patients with genetic ataxia were positive for anti-GAD. The titre of anti-GAD reduced following the introduction of a gluten-free diet in patients with SPS who had serological evidence of gluten sensitivity. The same was observed in patients with gluten ataxia and anti-GAD antibodies. This was also associated with clinical improvement. CONCLUSION: These findings suggest a link between gluten sensitivity and GAD antibody-associated diseases.},

   abstract = {There is growing evidence that many aspects of our lifestyle and the environment we now live in contribute to the development of disease. The luminal digestive tract is a clear target of the influence of dietary components, alcohol, microbial organisms, and other ingested materials. External factors including obesity, lack of physical exercise, and tobacco consumption also impact diseases of the luminal gastrointestinal (GI) tract. A growing understanding of the microbiome which forms an integral part of the human organism indicates that this is another important external force that impacts human health and disease. The luminal GI tract conditions that arise, at least in part, from these external factors range from malignancies (squamous cell esophageal cancer, Barrett's esophagus and associated esophageal adenocarcinoma, gastric cancer, and colorectal cancer), idiopathic inflammatory disorders such as inflammatory bowel diseases, and post-infectious syndromes including post-infectious irritable bowel syndrome, post-infectious dyspepsia and other functional GI disorders. Of particular interest, given their increase in prevalence in much of the world, are immune-mediated conditions in which food antigens are the driving force behind disease development. These entities include celiac disease, eosinophilic esophagitis, and food allergies. Celiac disease is a prime example of a condition mediated by dietary factors whose pathogenesis has only recently been determined, providing opportunities for developing treatment options beyond the gluten-free diet. While a genetic basis for this disease clearly exists, it is believed that environmental factors such as an increase in gluten in the human diet account for its rising prevalence, now roughly 1% of genetically susceptible populations in all continents. Proposed therapeutic strategies span from preventing disease by modulating the time of gluten introduction in infants, to reducing exposure to gluten by developing strains of wheat with lower levels of gluten, degrading ingested gluten peptides within the intestinal lumen via endopeptidases or modulating uptake of these peptides across intestinal tight junctions. Other novel treatments in development focus on interfering with the immune events that lead to disease once gluten accesses the lamina propria including altering the immune milieu from a Th1-predominant response via hookworm infection, inhibiting tissue transglutaminase, and blocking antigen presentation and/or T-cell responses to gluten peptides. While new treatment options for celiac disease reflect the complex interaction of diet, genetic factors and the host immune response, the implications for treatment of many conditions of the large and small intestine that arise from environmental and lifestyle are as basic as ensuring adequate nutrition, regular exercise and cessation of tobacco use. Much more needs to be learned about the microbiome, dietary and other factors and their interaction with the human host in order to develop potential new treatment strategies for diseases that result from the environment and lifestyle.},

A careful history and physical examination may reveal clues that suggest a coexisting or alternative diagnosis, such as small intestinal bacterial overgrowth or celiac disease (CD). Testing for bacterial overgrowth has limitations, but emerging data suggest that antibiotics may be of some benefit in patients with IBS with diarrhea and bloating. CD seems to have a higher prevalence in patients with IBS. Some patients with IBS may have symptomatic improvement on gluten-restricted diets, without histologic or serologic evidence of CD.},

   abstract = {The current essential therapy of celiac disease is a strict adherence to a gluten-free diet. Besides food products that are naturally gluten-free, "very low gluten" and "gluten-free" bakery products have become available. The availability of immunochemical and other analytical methods to determine gluten markers in foods is of utmost importance to ensure the well being of gluten-sensitive individuals. The aim of this review was to evaluate if currently available methodologies are suitable to meet the requirements of food labeling standards for individual gluten source declaration, in order to achieve policy objectives. Codex Alimentarius and European Union (EU) legislation and gluten detection methodologies applicable at present have been summarized and compared. In 2009, the European Commission issued Regulation No. 41/2009 concerning the composition and labeling of foodstuffs suitable for people intolerant to gluten. This review constitutes a basis to investigate the possibility to develop a proteomic-based method for the specific detection of gluten-containing cereals in food products, especially at or around the limits specified in EU legislation.},

We retrospectively reviewed the medical records of 127 consecutive cases of adult-onset celiac disease evaluated at a single United States center to determine the distribution of the associated human leukocyte antigen DQA1 and DQB1 alleles. The median patient age of diagnosis was 41 (range, 16-81) years. Ninety-five adults underwent human leukocyte antigen DQ typing. Eighty patients were DQ2 positive, 24 were DQ8 positive, and 11 were DQ2 and DQ8 positive. Four patients carried the uncommon, low-risk haplotype DQ2.2 (DQA1*02 and DQB1*02) without DQA1*05. Two patients did not carry human leukocyte antigen DQ2 or DQ8. All of the patients with atypical human leukocyte antigen DQ responded to a gluten-free diet. Although the majority of patients carry the human leukocyte antigen DQ2 or DQ8, gluten-dependent enteropathy periodically presents in adults with low-risk alleles.},

However, the advent of sensitive serological investigations has revealed that over half of childhood CD remains asymptomatic or presents with more subtle non-gastrointestinal symptoms, with a significant risk to the health of undiagnosed children. In view of its changing presentation there is an increasing need for clinicians to have a low threshold to investigate patients for this disease. Rare cases of CD associated with respiratory symptoms have been reported. The authors report an interesting case presenting as chronic cough in an otherwise asymptomatic 8-year-old girl. As a result of having a low threshold of suspicion for underlying CD, a diagnosis has been made and the long-term health risks of undiagnosed disease have been improved in both the patient and her immediate family.},

   abstract = {BACKGROUND & AIMS: Adherence to a gluten-free diet is the only effective treatment for celiac disease. It has been recommended that patients be followed up, make regular visits to the clinic, and undergo serologic analysis for markers of celiac disease, although a follow-up procedure has not been standardized. We determined how many patients with celiac disease are actually followed up. METHODS: We collected data on 122 patients with biopsy-proven celiac disease, diagnosed between 1996 and 2006 in Olmsted County, Minnesota (70% women; median age, 42 y), for whom complete medical records and verification of residency were available. We determined the frequency at which patients received follow-up examinations, from 6 months to 5 years after diagnosis. The Kaplan-Meier method was used to estimate event rates at 1 and 5 years. Patients were classified according to categories of follow-up procedures recommended by the American Gastroenterological Association (AGA). RESULTS: We estimated that by 1 and 5 years after diagnosis with celiac disease, 41.0% and 88.7% of the patients had follow-up visits, 33.6% and 79.8% were assessed for compliance with a gluten-free diet, 3.3% and 15.8% met with a registered dietitian, 2.5% and 18.1% had an additional intestinal biopsy, and 22.1% and 65.6% received serologic testing for markers of celiac disease, respectively. Among 113 patients (93%) who were followed up for more than 4 years, only 35% received follow-up analyses that were consistent with AGA recommendations. CONCLUSIONS: Patients with celiac disease are not followed up consistently. Follow-up examinations often are inadequate and do not follow AGA recommendations. Improving follow-up strategies for patients with celiac disease could improve management of this disease.},

It can appear at any age, then becoming a permanent condition. It is more frequent in women, as happens with other autoimmune diseases. Celiac disease is the intestinal form and the most important manifestation among a set of gluten-induced autoimmune pathologies that affect different systems. Neurological manifestations of gluten sensitivity, with or without enteropathy, are also frequent, their pathogenesis including an immunological attack on the central and peripheral nervous tissue accompanied by neurodegenerative changes. The clinical manifestations are varied, but the most common syndromes are cerebellar ataxia and peripheral neuropathy. Finally, gluten sensitivity is associated to a varying degree, with other complex diseases and could influence their evolution. The early detection of cases of gluten sensitivity with neurological manifestations and subsequent treatment with the gluten-free diet could provide remarkable benefits to the patients.},

   abstract = {BACKGROUND: Dermatitis herpetiformis (DH) is an extra-intestinal manifestation of coeliac disease and most patients adhere to a life-long gluten free diet (GFD). Increased mortality rates have been reported in coeliac disease but knowledge in DH is scanty. OBJECTIVES: To survey the mortality rate and causes of death in a large cohort of patients with DH. MATERIAL AND METHODS: Patients with DH (n = 476 consecutive patients) diagnosed from 1970 onwards at the Tampere University Hospital were analysed for causes of death during 1971-2010. A questionnaire survey on key aspects of health behaviour was performed in patients with DH and comparisons were made with the Finnish population. RESULTS: The total number of deaths during 9079 person years followed up was 77 whereas 110 were expected. The standardized mortality rate (SMR) for all causes of death was significantly reduced, being 0.70 (95% CI 0.55-0.87), and similar in both sexes. The SMR was equal in the patients with DH with (0.73) and without (0.77) small bowel villous atrophy. The SMR was significantly reduced (0.38) for deaths due to cerebrovascular diseases. The SMR due to lymphoproliferative malignancies was significantly increased (6.86) in the first 5 years of follow-up but not thereafter. The questionnaire survey documented that 97.7% of the patients with DH adhered to a GFD. The patients reported significantly less hypercholesterolaemia and there were fewer current and past smokers compared with the age- and sex-matched control population. CONCLUSIONS: The present long-term follow-up study of DH documented significantly reduced all-cause and cerebrovascular disease mortality. Strict adherence to a GFD, less smoking and hypercholesterolaemia may play a role in the observed health benefit.},

   abstract = {Coeliac disease is a gut disease driven by an abnormal immune response towards dietary gluten in genetically susceptible individuals. Whether and, if so, how abnormal transport of gluten across the gut epithelium may participate in the pathogenesis of coeliac disease remains debatable. This paper summarises the interactions of gluten-derived peptides with the intestinal epithelium and discusses the mechanisms that control their transport across the epithelium. It shows how recent data point to a key role for the transcellular pathway and highlights the 'Trojan horse' role of secretory IgA which can hijack the transferrin receptor and allow the rapid translocation of intact gluten peptides into the mucosa. These recent findings might be useful for the design of new treatments.},

   abstract = {OBJECTIVES: Regulatory T cells (Tregs) are instrumental for tolerance to self-antigens and dietary proteins. We have previously shown that interleukin (IL)-15, a cytokine overexpressed in the intestine of patients with celiac disease (CD), does not impair the generation of functional Tregs but renders human T cells resistant to Treg suppression. Treg numbers and responses of intestinal and peripheral T lymphocytes to suppression by Tregs were therefore compared in CD patients and controls. METHODS: Intraepithelial lymphocytes (IELs) and lamina propria lymphocytes (LPLs) were isolated from duodenal biopsy specimens of CD patients and controls. Concomitantly, CD4+CD25+ T lymphocytes (Tregs) were purified from blood. Responses of IELs and of LPLs, and peripheral lymphocytes (PBLs) to suppression by Tregs were tested by analyzing anti-CD3-induced proliferation and interferon (IFN)-gamma production in the presence or absence of peripheral Tregs. Lamina propria and peripheral CD4+CD25+FOXP3+ T cells were assessed by flow cytometry. RESULTS: Although percentages of CD4+CD25+FOXP3+ LPLs were significantly increased in patients with active CD, proliferation and IFN-gamma production of intestinal T lymphocytes were significantly less inhibited by autologous or heterologous Tregs in CD patients than in controls (P < 0.01). In all tested CD patients, IEL were unable to respond to Tregs. Resistance of LPLs and PBLs to Treg suppression was observed in patients with villous atrophy who had significantly enhanced serum levels of IL-15 compared with patients without villous atrophy and controls. CONCLUSIONS: Our results indicate that effector T lymphocytes from active CD become resistant to suppression by Tregs. This resistance might cause loss of tolerance to gluten, but also to self-antigens.},

   abstract = {OBJECTIVE: Celiac disease (CD) is characterized by histologic alterations in small bowel biopsies. Circulating specific CD antibodies at the time of diagnosis and their disappearance after a gluten-free diet support the diagnosis of CD. We aimed to determine the behavior of the CD antibodies immunoglobulin A anti-tissue transglutaminase (anti-TG2) and immunoglobulin A endomysium (EMA) in children with CD after starting a gluten-free diet. METHODS: This was a retrospective multicenter study in the Netherlands between 2001 and 2009. Inclusion criteria were all newly diagnosed patients with CD younger than 19 years who had at least 1 anti-TG2 and/or EMA measurement before and after starting a gluten-free diet. Eight different anti-TG2 kits were used with substrates of guinea pig TG2 in 1 (Sigma) and 7 human-recombinant TG2: Varelisa and EliA Celikey Phadia-GmbH; Orgentec Diagnostica-GmbH; Diarect AG; Roboscreen GmbH; Aeskulisa Diagnostics; Binding Site Ltd. EMA was analyzed with indirect immunofluorescence tests. Statistical analyses were performed by using mixed-model repeated measurements and survival analysis. RESULTS: There were 129 children with CD included (mean age: 5.6 years; SD +/- 4.2). The mean concentration of anti-TG2 decreased significantly within 3 months after starting a gluten-free diet (P < .0001). The cumulative percentage of children who became negative for EMA after (1/2), 1, 1(1/2), and 2 years was 31%, 60%, 74%, and 87%, respectively. For anti-TG2, a comparable trend was shown: 35%, 55%, 64%, and 78%, respectively. CONCLUSIONS: Doctors taking care of children with CD should be aware that the mean concentration of anti-TG2 will show a 74% decrease (95% confidence interval: 69%-79%) after 3 months of gluten-free diet, and approximately 80% of the children will be sero-negative for EMA and anti-TG2 after 2 years of the diet.},

   abstract = {OBJECTIVES: A food questionnaire (FQ) to assess gluten intake in infants 0 to 12 months old has been developed and validated (FQ-gluten), but an instrument to assess gluten intake in children 1 to 4 years is not available. Development and validation of such an instrument (FQ-gluten4) was the aim of the present study. METHODS: The FQ-gluten was adapted according to age-related food consumption. The results of this FQ-gluten4 were compared with the results of a 2-day food record. RESULTS: Seventy-one parents filled in both instruments. The mean amount of gluten consumption calculated from the FQ-gluten4 was comparable with that of the food record, but significant differences were found in the amount of gluten intake in 1- to 2-year-old children and in the percentage of gluten from porridge among the 1- to 3-year-olds. The Blant-Altman limits of agreement with standard deviation of 2600 mg were -5118 to 5630 mg. CONCLUSIONS: The new, short, standardized, validated, and easy-to-use FQ-gluten4 may be a useful instrument in the assessment of gluten intake in young children. Using this standardized method provides opportunity for better comparison of the results of gluten consumption in studies throughout the world. Furthermore, such an instrument can be used to quantify the gluten intake in individuals suspected to have celiac disease but in whom the diagnoses cannot be confirmed.},

   abstract = {Gastric leptin and cholecystokinin (CCK) act on vagal afferents to induce cardiovascular effects and reflex inhibition of splanchnic sympathetic nerve discharge (SSND) and may act cooperatively in these responses. We sought to determine whether these effects are altered in animals that developed obesity in response to a medium high-fat diet (MHFD). Male Sprague-Dawley rats were placed on a low-fat diet (LFD; n = 8) or a MHFD (n = 24) for 13 wk, after which the animals were anesthetized and artificially ventilated. Arterial pressure was monitored and blood was collected for the determination of plasma leptin and CCK. SSND responses to leptin (15 mug/kg) and CCK (2 mug/kg) administered close to the coeliac artery were evaluated. Collectively, MHFD animals had significantly higher plasma leptin but lower plasma CCK levels than LFD rats (P < 0.05), and this corresponded to attenuated or reversed SSND responses to CCK (LFD, -21 +/- 2%; and MHFD, -12 +/- 2%; P < 0.05) and leptin (LFD, -6 +/- 2%; and MHFD, 4 +/- 1%; P < 0.001). Alternatively, animals on the MHFD were stratified into obesity-prone (OP; n = 8) or obesity-resistant (OR; n = 8) groups according to their weight gain falling within the upper or lower tertile, respectively. OP rats had significantly higher resting arterial pressure, adiposity, and plasma leptin but lower plasma CCK compared with LFD rats (P < 0.05). The SSND responses to CCK or leptin were not significantly different between OP and OR animals. These results demonstrate that a high-fat diet is associated with blunted splanchnic sympathoinhibitory responses to gastric leptin and CCK and may impact on sympathetic vasomotor mechanisms involved in circulatory control.},

RESEARCH DESIGN AND METHODS: A total of 150 infants with a first-degree family history of type 1 diabetes and a risk HLA genotype were randomly assigned to a first gluten exposure at age 6 months (control group) or 12 months (late-exposure group) and were followed 3 monthly until the age of 3 years and yearly thereafter for safety (for growth and autoantibodies to transglutaminase C [TGCAs]), islet autoantibodies to insulin, GAD, insulinoma-associated protein 2, and type 1 diabetes. RESULTS: Adherence to the dietary-intervention protocol was reported from 70% of families. During the first 3 years, weight and height were similar in children in the control and late-exposure groups, as was the probability of developing TGCAs (14 vs. 4%; P = 0.1). Eleven children in the control group and 13 children in the late-exposure group developed islet autoantibodies (3-year risk: 12 vs. 13%; P = 0.6). Seven children developed diabetes, including four in the late-exposure group. No significant differences were observed when children were analyzed as per protocol on the basis of the reported first gluten exposure of the children. CONCLUSIONS: Delaying gluten exposure until the age of 12 months is safe but does not substantially reduce the risk for islet autoimmunity in genetically at-risk children.},

DESIGN: Retrospective case-finding study using pathology, dietetic and clinical records held in hospitals and general practice within Cardiff and the Vale of Glamorgan. All local consultants including those at private hospitals were contacted. Incidence rates were calculated using the Welsh Assembly Government's mid-year estimates. RESULTS: In total, 347 newly diagnosed cases of CD (42 children, 305 adults) were detected. Compared with previous published data, incidence rates in adults per 100 000 have increased from 3.08 at the end of 1995 to 11.13 in 2005. In children, the disease incidence has trebled to 6.89 per 100 000. There have been some changes in presenting symptoms, with a marked preponderance of abdominal pain and bloating in women (P<0.05). There has been a 14-fold increase in the numbers of patients undergoing coeliac serology testing from 1996 to 2005, associated with an increased absolute number of new cases. However, the proportion of new cases diagnosed compared with numbers of serological tests performed decreased from 5.8 to 1.1%. CONCLUSION: The incidence of CD in children and adults has markedly increased. One of the most striking features of our data in adult CD is the increasing frequency of abdominal pain and bloating in the female cohort. Incorporation of antibody testing into clinical guidelines is likely to result in a wider spectrum of individuals with nonspecific gastrointestinal symptoms being investigated and diagnosed with CD in the future.},

   abstract = {BACKGROUND: Researchers have made every effort to assess the role of gut microbiota in pediatric diseases like inflammatory bowel disease (IBD), celiac disease, asthma, allergy, and autism. The leading hypothesis is that an altered microbial composition is present (other than the presence of a specific pathogen) and that it could be involved in the pathogenesis or progression of such disorders. METHODS: Cultural, molecular, metabolomic, and metagenomic approaches are trying to define the pediatric gut microbiota imbalances in different diseases. RESULTS AND CONCLUSION: In pediatric IBD, a marked increase in aerobes and facultative anaerobes was found, along with an increase in Enterobacteriaceae members (Escherichia coli). In both pediatric IBD and celiac disease (Th1-mediated disorders), higher bacterial cell counts were observed, jointly with a general gain of biodiversity. A preponderance of Bacteroidetes and a parallel decrease of Firmicutes was also reported in IBD, celiac disease and autism. Contrarily, dietary changes due to Western lifestyles increase Firmicutes populations and lower short-chain fatty acids production, possibly exposing 'developed' children to the infectious challenge (Escherichia and Shigella spp.). Lactobacillus and Bifidobacterium species could be protective agents for atopic diseases, while Clostridia, Enterobacteriaceae, and staphylococci can be associated with an increased risk of such Th2-mediated disorders. In the brain-gut axis view, gut microbiota could also play a role in autism.},

   abstract = {BACKGROUND: Dermatitis herpetiformis (DH) is a rare auto-immune bullous disease characterized by its almost constant association to gluten sensitivity. OBJECTIVE: Review of literature about epidemiology, physiopathology, clinical data and treatment of DH. METHODS: Research on Medline and Embase database without any time limit until April 2010. Because of the lack of randomized therapeutic trials in DH, retrospective series and case reports have been analyzed. RESULTS: DH is related to auto-antibodies against epidermal transglutaminase, which belongs to the same family as tissue transglutaminase, the auto-antigen of celiac disease. Physiopathology is complex, occurring in HLA DQ2 or DQ8 predisposed patients, and implies gluten, immunological reaction in the intestinal wall then in the skin. DH and celiac disease may be encountered in the same family. DH is characterized by a very pruritic microvesicular eruption typically located on elbows, knees and buttocks. Digestive manifestations of celiac disease occur in 15% of cases. Direct immunofluorescence is necessary to confirm the diagnosis, showing granular IgA+/-C3 deposits in the papillary dermis. Circulating IgA and IgG antiendomysium and antitransglutaminase antibodies are detected in almost all patients at the acute phase and follow the clinical course of the disease. Gastro-intestinal endoscopy with multiple duodenal biopsies shows partial or complete villous atrophy in two thirds of cases, intraepithelial lymphocyte infiltrate in the other cases. Other auto-immune diseases may be associated in 10-20% of cases. The main long-term risk is the occurrence of T or B nodal or intestinal tract lymphoma in 2% of cases (relative risk close to 6 in several studies, but not admitted by all authors), especially if adherence to gluten-free diet is not strict. Treatment is based on dapsone, which is quickly efficient on cutaneous manifestations, but not on the digestive involvement and on strict and definitive gluten-free diet, which cures villous atrophy and reduces the risk of lymphoma. CONCLUSION: DH is associated to a gluten enteropathy and its physiopathology is better known. Even if the risk of secondary lymphoma seems little, most of the authors recommend a definitive gluten-free diet.},

   abstract = {OBJECTIVE: Citrulline is a nonprotein amino acid synthesized in the small intestine. The aim of this study is to explore plasma citrulline levels in children with celiac disease (CD) and monitor the time-related changes of these levels after initiation of a gluten-free diet (GFD). METHODS: Fasting-plasma citrulline levels were determined by high-performance liquid chromatography in (i) 23 patients with CD before the institution of GFD, (ii) 20 patients with CD under treatment for more than 2 years responsive to a GFD, (iii) 10 children with gastrointestinal symptoms and normal small bowel biopsy, and (iv) 20 healthy controls. In group A, citrulline levels were also measured after 1, 3, 6, and 12 months on a GFD. RESULTS: Mean plasma citrulline levels were lower in untreated patients with CD (24.5+/-4.9) than in patients on a GFD (31.2+/-6.7 mumol/l, P<0.001), patients with gastrointestinal symptoms and normal intestinal mucosa (30.3+/-4.7 mumol/l, P<0.01), and healthy controls (32.4+/-7.5 mumol/l, P<0.001). In untreated patients with CD,an inverse correlation was observed between citrulline concentrations and the severity of villous atrophy (r=-0.67, P<0.01). After 1 month on a GFD, patients had significantly higher levels than before diet (P<0.05) and after 3 months on diet, levels were similar to those observed in the healthy controls. CONCLUSIONS: Plasma citrulline levels are lower in celiacs reflecting small bowel involvement in this disease. After a short period on GFD, citrulline levels increased rapidly, indicating that citrulline is a sensitive marker of the positive effect of GFD on intestinal repair.},

   abstract = {BACKGROUND: Chromo-zoom endoscopy has been demonstrated to be valuable in assessing the degree of intestinal villous atrophy in patients with suspected celiac disease. OBJECTIVE: To evaluate the diagnostic accuracy of chromo-zoom endoscopy in patients with difficult diagnosis because of nonconcordant test results and/or the confounding of a gluten-free diet initiated before an appropriate diagnosis of celiac disease and to compare the findings to a recent reference standard, the in vitro gliadin challenge test. DESIGN: Prospective, case-control study. SETTING: Tertiary-care referral hospital. PATIENTS: Patients without celiac disease (negative control group, n = 9), patients with celiac disease (positive control group, n = 41), and patients with difficult diagnosis (n = 27). INTERVENTION: Chromo-endoscopy with indigo carmine and endoscopic zoom-magnification were performed. Duodenal fragments were collected for the in vitro gliadin challenge test. The area under the receiver operating characteristic curve (ROC) was used for statistical analyses on accuracy. MAIN OUTCOME MEASUREMENTS: Diagnostic accuracy of chromo-zoom endoscopy for detection of mucosal abnormalities in patients with difficult diagnosis. RESULTS: Chromo-zoom endoscopy had a high accuracy for celiac disease diagnosis in analyses on negative controls and positive controls (area under roc = 0.99). In the difficult diagnosis group, the accuracy of chromo-zoom endoscopy was lower (area under roc = 0.83), but it increased after exclusion of patients with celiac disease on gluten-free diet (area under roc = 0.88). LIMITATIONS: There was a 4% failure rate in the ability to cultivate biopsies. Also, the study was done at an academic medical center. CONCLUSION: Chromo-zoom endoscopy has high accuracy for cases of difficult diagnosis of celiac disease but only in untreated patients with celiac disease.},

This study was designed to assess the impact of active patient education on gastrointestinal symptoms in women with a gluten-free diet. A total of 106 Swedish women, aged 20 years or older, with celiac disease on a gluten-free diet for a minimum of 5 years took part in a randomized controlled trial. The intervention group (n = 54) underwent a 10-session educational program, "Celiac School," based on problem-based learning. Controls (n = 52) were sent information regarding celiac disease at home. The outcome measure was gastrointestinal symptoms at 10 weeks and 6 months after intervention, assessed with the Gastrointestinal Symptom Rating Scale. After 10 weeks of "Celiac School," the participating women reported significant improvements that remained 6 months later (p = .029). The controls did not improve significantly. A comparison of the development of scores, from baseline to 10 weeks, could not demonstrate a significant difference in the overall index between the 2 groups but showed a significant improvement concerning 1 of its components, namely the index reflecting Abdominal Pain (p = .007). Intervention methods should be refined to reach an even more pronounced effect.},

   abstract = {AIMS AND OBJECTIVES: To describe what life is like as a woman living with coeliac disease. BACKGROUND: The therapy for coeliac disease is a gluten-free diet, and if sufferers keep strictly to this, it is suggested that they will stay well. However, previous studies point out that people who are treated for coeliac disease, particularly women, experience various kinds of inconvenience in relation to having coeliac disease and to being treated with gluten-free diet. DESIGN: A qualitative research design was chosen. METHODS: A phenomenological approach as devised by Giorgi was used. Tape-recorded qualitative interviews with a total of 15 women who were being treated for coeliac disease were conducted in 2008 in Sweden. RESULTS: The results demonstrated that coeliac disease can influence women's lives in different ways. The general structure of being a woman with coeliac disease was described as a striving towards a normalised lifeworld. Three conditions necessary to achieve a normalised life were described, namely being secure, being in control and being seen and included. CONCLUSION: Understanding factors affecting the ability to live with coeliac disease as normally as possible can help caregivers, and others, to support these women in their aims. RELEVANCE TO CLINICAL PRACTICE: Nurses should help women to adopt facilitating thoughts in relation to the disease and, in so doing, help them to select appropriate coping strategies.},

Upon examination, she was found to have a full range of motion and no tenderness in the hip joint or lower back. The pain was aggravated by walking. She had a limping gait with a lean to her right side. She had low calcium, low hemoglobin, high parathyroid hormone and high alkaline phosphatase levels. X-rays of her hip and lumbosacral areas were normal. Her spinal magnetic resonance imaging findings were also normal. A bone mineral density (BMD) study revealed severe osteoporosis with a lumbar spine T-score of -4.6 and femoral neck T-scores of -4.1 (left) and -3.9 (right). A celiac disease work-up included tests for anti-endomysial antibodies and anti-tissue transglutaminase antibodies, which were positive, and the results of an endoscopy and biopsy confirmed the diagnosis of celiac disease. Gluten-free diet with calcium and vitamin D supplementation resulted in the complete resolution of her symptoms and a normal gait. The patient returned to normal calcium and parathyroid hormone levels and experienced a significant improvement in her BMD to normal. Celiac disease may initially presents during pregnancy result in severe osteoporosis that causes significant pain and disability.},

   abstract = {BACKGROUND AND AIMS: The incidence of celiac disease (CD) shows large, worldwide variation. However, whether its causes are environmental (gluten-containing diet) or genetic (specific haplotype) have not been established. The aim of the present study is to examine the incidence of CD among second-generation immigrants and adoptees from abroad to disentangle genetic/ethnic versus environmental influences (assuming that immigrants have similar gluten exposures to native Swedes, and thus differ from them only in terms of their genetic background). METHODS: Second-generation immigrants and adoptees from abroad were identified in the MigMed 2 Database and were followed until diagnosis of CD, death, or the end of study. Standardized incidence ratios (SIRs) were calculated among these immigrants with native Swedes as the reference group. RESULTS: A total of 1,050,569 children were defined as second-generation immigrants and the overall SIR of CD (SIR = 0.89, 95% confidence interval 0.84-0.94) was significantly lower than that of native Swedes. The incidence of CD among children with parents from Western, Eastern, and Northern European countries was similar to that in native Swedes, but was lower for those with parents from low-prevalence countries, especially Eastern and Southeast Asian countries. A total of 51,557 children born in foreign countries were adopted by Swedes. Adoptees from Eastern Asia had a significantly decreased SIR of CD. CONCLUSIONS: The decreased incidence of CD in second-generation immigrants and some groups of adoptees from abroad strongly suggests that ethnic genetic heterogeneity may contribute to the worldwide variation in CD incidence.},

   abstract = {The mechanism of activation of transglutaminase 2 (TG2) in the extracellular matrix remains a fundamental mystery in our understanding of the biology of this multifunctional mammalian enzyme. Earlier investigations have highlighted the role of a disulfide bond formed by vicinal Cys residues in maintaining calcium-bound TG2 in an inactive state. Here, we have shown that the redox potential of this disulfide bond is approximately -190 mV, a high value for a disulfide bond in proteins. Consistent with this observation, TG2 activity in a freshly wounded fibroblast culture depends upon the redox potential of the environment. We sought to identify a physiological mechanism for the activation of oxidized TG2. With a k(cat)/K(m) of 1.6 mum(-1) min(-1), human thioredoxin (Trx) was a highly specific activator of oxidized human TG2. Trx-mediated activation of TG2 was blocked by PX-12, a small molecule Trx inhibitor that is undergoing clinical trials as a cancer chemotherapeutic agent. In a mixed culture containing fibroblasts and monocytic cells, interferon-gamma stimulated Trx release from monocytes, which in turn activated TG2 around the fibroblasts. Recombinant human Trx could also activate extracellular TG2 in cryosections of human and mouse small intestinal biopsies. In addition to explaining how TG2 can be activated by dietary gluten in the small intestinal mucosa of celiac sprue patients, our findings reveal a new strategy for inhibiting the undesirable consequences of TG2 activity in this widespread, lifelong disease.},

High levels of immunoglobulin-A directed against transglutaminase isoenzyme 6 (TG6) were found in the patient's serum. The positive response to the diet, TG6 antibodies, and neuronal antibody binding suggest that CEC might be autoimmune in nature, as in other extra-intestinal manifestations of gluten-related diseases, such as gluten ataxia.},

   abstract = {UNLABELLED: Coeliac disease (gluten-sensitive enteropathy, sprue) is a chrocic disorder of the small bowel leading to malabsorption. AIMS: charts of all patients with coeliac disease treated at the 2nd Department of Medicine, Semmelweis University were evaluated. PATIENTS AND METHODS: The authors retrospectively analysed the results of a total of 132 patients with coeliac disease (107 females and 25 males; mean age, 37 years; median, 35 years; range, 19-78 years) attending the centre between 1999 and 2010. The authors routinely performed the following investigations in patients with suspected coeliac disease: multiple biopsies taken from the duodenum, tissue transglutaminase antibody or endomysial antibody based serology, body mass index calculation, osteodensitometry, evaluation of disorders associated with coeliac disease, family history for coeliac disease, and implementation of family-screening for coeliac disease given the agreement of the index patients. RESULTS: Histological samples were available in 101 cases, and distributions of data according to the Marsh-classification were as follows: negative in 9%, M3a in 27%, M3b in 18%, and M3c in 46% of cases, respectively. Serological results were available in 117 cases. 93/117 (79%) showed seropositivity. Body mass index was calculated for 95 patients, and the mean value for males was 22.4 kg/m(2) (range, 17-30.3 kg/m(2)), whereas the mean value for females was 20.7 kg/m(2) (range, 15.2-30.4 kg/m(2)). Osteodensitometry was performed in 90 patients; 45 patients (50%) proved normal, 31 (34%) had osteopenia, and 15 (26%) had osteoporosis. Coeliac disease associated disorders were present in 45/132 patients (34%; 6 males). Associated disorders were as follows: 15 dermatitis herpetiformis Duhring, 15 thyroid diseases (5 hypo- and 10 hyperthyroidism), 6 Crohn's disease, 3 selective IgA-deficiency, 2 endometrioses, 1 systemic lupus erythematosus, 1 myasthenia gravis, and 1 type-1 diabetes mellitus. Sixty-four of the 132 index patients brought 133 first-degree relatives for family screening (serology), where 26/133 (19.5%; 17 females) first-degree relatives proved to suffer from coeliac disease. CONCLUSIONS: The age distribution of this cohort demonstrates that coeliac disease can present at any age. Similarly to those of other coeliac disease centres, female predominance is significant. Histology usually showed advanced villous atrophy. Serological results were usually in conjunction with the histological results and proved to be useful for monitoring dietary compliance and for accomplishing family screening. The mean body mass index values were in the normal range confirming that adult patients with coeliac disease are usually not malnourished. The 20% prevalence of coeliac disease among first-degree relatives underlines the necessity of family screening.},

   abstract = {BACKGROUND: Coeliac disease is increasingly diagnosed and weight changes are common after adoption of a gluten-free diet (GFD), however data on body mass index (BMI) changes are limited. AIM: To assess changes in BMI after diagnosis in a large coeliac population. METHODS: A total of 1018 patients with biopsy confirmed coeliac disease seen at our centre were studied retrospectively. Initial and follow-up BMIs were recorded, as was GFD adherence as assessed by an expert dietitian. RESULTS: A total of 679 patients with at least two recorded BMIs and GFD adherence data were included in the study. Mean follow-up was 39.5 months. Compared to regional population data, the coeliac cohort was significantly less likely to be overweight or obese (32% vs. 59%, P < 0.0001). Mean BMI increased significantly after GFD initiation (24.0 to 24.6; P < 0.001). 21.8% of patients with normal or high BMI at study entry increased their BMI by more than two points. CONCLUSIONS: Individuals with coeliac disease have lower BMI than the regional population at diagnosis. BMI increases on the GFD, especially in those that adhere closely to the GFD. On the GFD, 15.8% of patients move from a normal or low BMI class into an overweight BMI class, and 22% of patients overweight at diagnosis gain weight. These results indicate that weight maintenance counselling should be an integral part of coeliac dietary education.},

The role of gut microbiota has been addressed previously with inconsistent findings. Our aim was to evaluate microbiota, its receptors (Toll-like receptors [TLRs]), and regulators of the TLRs in the small intestinal mucosa in celiac disease. METHODS: Microbiota was analyzed by quantitative polymerase chain reaction (total bacteria and 10 bacterial group- and species-specific primers) and gene expression of interleukin-8 (IL-8), TLR2, TLR3, TLR4, TLR5, TLR9, and regulators of TLRs, Toll-interacting protein (TOLLIP), and single immunoglobulin IL-1R-related molecule, by relative quantitative reverse transcription-polymerase chain reaction in 10 children with celiac disease (untreated celiacs), 9 children with normal small intestinal mucosa (controls), and 6 adults with celiac disease with normal small intestinal mucosa after following a gluten-free diet (treated celiacs). RESULTS: Small intestinal microbiota was comparable among controls, untreated celiacs, and treated celiacs. Expression of IL-8 mRNA, a marker of intestinal inflammation, was significantly increased in untreated celiacs as compared with treated celiacs (P=0.002) and controls (P=0.001). Expression of TLR-2 mRNA was significantly decreased in untreated (P=0.001) and treated (P=0.03) celiacs, whereas expression of TLR-9 mRNA was increased in untreated celiacs (P=0.001) as compared with controls. Expression of TOLLIP mRNA was downregulated in untreated celiacs as compared with controls (P=0.02). CONCLUSIONS: Altered gene expression of TLR2, TLR9, and TOLLIP in small intestinal biopsies in celiac disease suggests that microbiota-associated factors may be important in the development of the disease.},

   abstract = {BACKGROUND: Constipation is a frequent cause of seeking paediatric advice and concerns up to 15% of the child population. AIM OF THE STUDY: Estimation of the role of allergy in the etiology of constipation in children during the fi rst three years of life. MATERIAL AND METHODS: Retrospective analysis was performed in 9489 children treated in 2nd Department of Pediatrics and Allergology of the Polish Mother's Memorial Hospital in Lodz in the years 1998- 2008. Among them there was a group of children with constipation diagnosed according to the Rome III Criteria. Anamnesis, course of disease and physical examination performed of each child guided further differential diagnosis Confirmation of food allergy diagnosis was positive result of provocation-elimination challenge with harmful food, and in case of some children additionally increased serum concentrations of allergenspecific IgE antibodies. In children with food allergy elimination diet was implemented. RESULTS: Chronic constipation was diagnosed in 136 children (1.43%). The most frequent cause of constipation in the examined children was allergy to cow's milk proteins, (n=99; 72.8%). The others were: psychogenic factors (n=10; 7.3%), dysbacteriosis of digestive system (n=7; 5.1%), anatomical defects of digestive tract (n=6; 4.4%), disorders of nervous system (n=6; 4.4%), overdose of Vit. D3 (n=3; 2.2%), Down Syndrome (n=2; 1.4%), celiac disease (n=1; 0.7%), abdominal tumour (neuroblastoma) (n=1; 0.7%) and cystic fibrosis (n=1; 0.7%). Clinical improvement after introduction of the elimination diet was observed in all children with food allergy. CONCLUSIONS: 1. In the fi rst three years of life cow milk allergy was the most frequent cause of constipation; 2. Incidence of food allergy as the reason of constipation decreased with age of the examined children.},

   abstract = {We previously reported that mild deoxycorticosterone acetate (DOCA)-salt hypertension develops in the absence of generalized sympathoexcitation. However, sympathetic nervous system activity (SNA) is regionally heterogeneous, so we began to investigate the role of sympathetic nerves to specific regions. Our first study on that possibility revealed no contribution of renal nerves to hypertension development. The splanchnic sympathetic nerves are implicated in blood pressure (BP) regulation because splanchnic denervation effectively lowers BP in human hypertension. Here we tested the hypothesis that splanchnic SNA contributes to the development of mild DOCA-salt hypertension. Splanchnic denervation was achieved by celiac ganglionectomy (CGX) in one group of rats while another group underwent sham surgery (SHAM-GX). After DOCA treatment (50 mg/kg) in rats with both kidneys intact, CGX rats exhibited a significantly attenuated increase in BP compared with SHAM-GX rats (15.6 +/- 2.2 vs. 25.6 +/- 2.2 mmHg, day 28 after DOCA treatment). In other rats, whole body norepinephrine (NE) spillover, measured to determine if CGX attenuated hypertension development by reducing global SNA, was not found to be different between SHAM-GX and CGX rats. In a third group, nonhepatic splanchnic NE spillover was measured as an index of splanchnic SNA, but this was not different between SHAM (non-DOCA-treated) and DOCA rats during hypertension development. In a final group, CGX effectively abolished nonhepatic splanchnic NE spillover. These data suggest that an intact splanchnic innervation is necessary for mild DOCA-salt hypertension development but not increased splanchnic SNA or NE release. Increased splanchnic vascular reactivity to NE during DOCA-salt treatment is one possible explanation.},

   abstract = {OBJECTIVES: To evaluate the markers of lymphocyte activation (sIL-2R, IL-6 and TNF alpha) in the peripheral blood of newly diagnosed patients with celiac disease (CD) and patients with CD on Gluten free diet (GFD) for at least 2 y. The markers were correlated with conventional serological tests Anti-tissue transglutaminase (Anti-TTG) used for diagnosis and follow up of the disease; wherever possible. METHODS: Thirty newly diagnosed cases of CD (on the basis of histopathology and serology) not on GFD were enrolled as Group 1 of the study. Thirty age and sex matched controls from the Pediatric Surgery OPD formed Group 2. Thirty cases of CD on GFD for at least 2 y (Group 3) were also enrolled in the study. Upper G.I. endoscopy was performed in all Group 1 patients and cytokine levels assayed by ELISA on serum obtained from all patients in Groups 1, 2, 3. RESULTS: Mean sIL-2R level in Group 1(1498.1+/-1234.31 pg/ml) and Group 3 (488.78+/-396.18 pg/ml) were significantly higher than the controls (336.27+/-218.67 pg/ml p < 0.05). Among the patients with CD, mean serum levels in Group 1 were higher than in Group 3 (p < 0.05). sIL-2R levels showed good correlation with tTg levels in Group 1 patients (p < 0.000, r = 0.69). Mean IL-6 levels in Group 1 were significantly higher (28.43+/-28.32 pg/ml) than Group 2(15.03+/-7.72 pg/ml p < 0.05) and Group 3(11.26+/-5.13 pg/ml p < 0.05). IL-6 levels were comparable between Groups 2 and 3 (p > 0.05).IL-6 levels showed good correlation with tTg levels in Group 1(p < 0.008, r = 0.471). Mean TNFalpha levels in Group 1(179.66+/-102.93 pg/ml), Group 2 (153.16+/-27.02 pg/ml) and Group 3 (166.67+/-28.95 pg/ml) were comparable (p > 0.05). TNFalpha levels showed poor correlation with tTg levels in Group 1 patients (p > 0.604, r = -0.099). CONCLUSIONS: sIL-2R and IL-6 levels have a good correlation with CD activity and can be used as reliable markers for detecting minimal transgression from GFD.},

   abstract = {Dermatitis herpetiformis (DH) is a chronic, polymorphic, pruritic skin disease that develops mostly in patients with latent gluten-sensitive enteropathy. DH patients usually present with skin manifestations only and are not aware of the underlying small-bowel problems. Owing to the granular immunoglobulin (Ig) A deposition at the tips of the papillary dermis and to the subepidermal blister formation associated with neutrophilic accumulations underlying the basement membrane, DH is considered to be an autoimmune blistering disease. Contrary to the other bullous disorders, DH patients have no circulating autoantibodies binding to the cutaneous basement membrane components or to other adherent structures of the skin, but they have gluten-induced IgA autoantibodies against transglutaminase (TG) 2 and TG3. The serum IgA against tissue TG2 is a most specific and sensitive serologic marker of gluten-sensitive enteropathy and is equivalent to the perviously described IgA endomysium antibodies. DH could be a cutaneous IgA-epidermal TG3 immunocomplex disease, developing only in a few patients with gluten-sensitive enteropathy as a second gluten-dependent disease. The main treatment of DH today is a strict, life-long gluten-free diet. Untreated DH patients should be regularly monitored for malabsorption and lymphomas. Associated autoimmune diseases are more common among DH patients. Family screening for gluten sensitivity is also strongly suggested.},

The distribution of these polymorphic symptoms around the elbow, knee, buttock, and back is suggestive of the diagnosis. DH is further confirmed by the accumulation of granulocytes at the papillary dermis, resulting in a subepidermal split formation and by the presence of a unique, granular IgA precipitate in the uppermost dermis. Prognosis is predominantly determined by other autoimmune pathologies, malabsorption, or very rarely by lymphomas. Some of these diseases can be prevented by an early-onset, strict gluten-free diet, which is therefore the suggested treatment option.},

The most common indications for CE were chronic abdominal pain alone (33 patients) or combined with chronic diarrhea (31 patients) and chronic diarrhea alone (30 patients). Among the 165 patients, 129 underwent CE for evaluation of gastrointestinal symptoms and 36 for surveillance or disease staging. RESULTS: CE findings were positive, suspicious and negative in 73 (44.2%), 13 (7.9%) and 79 (47.9%) of cases, respectively. The diagnostic yield was highest in patients with refractory celiac disease (10/10, 100%) and suspected Crohn's disease (5/6, 83.3%), followed by patients with chronic abdominal pain and chronic diarrhea (13/31, 41.9%), established Crohn's disease (2/6, 33.3%), chronic diarrhea alone (8/30, 26.7%), chronic abdominal pain alone (8/33, 24.2%) and other indications (3/13, 23.1%) (p < 0.005). The CE findings led to a change of medication in 74 (47.7%) patients, surgery in 15 (9.7%), administration of a strict gluten-free or other special diet in 13 (8.4%) and had other consequences in 11 (6.7%). Management was not modified in 42 (27.1%) patients. Among symptomatic patients (n = 129), 29 (22.5%) were lost to follow-up. The remaining 100 patients were followed up for 8.7 +/- 4.0 months (range 2-19). Among the latter, resolution or improvement of symptoms was observed in 86 (86%) patients, no change in 11 (11%) and 3 (3%) died. All 86 patients who experienced resolution or improvement of their symptoms had a modification of their management after CE; only 7/11 patients whose symptoms did not change (63.6%) and 2/3 patients who died (66.7%) had a modification of management (p < 0.001). CONCLUSIONS: CE appears to be a useful tool in the evaluation of patients with nonbleeding indications. The outcome of most patients with negative findings was excellent.},

In rare refractory celiac disease symptoms and small bowel mucosal morphological damage do not heal despite a strict diet. In such cases it is important to distinguish between type I and II refractory celiac disease by using small bowel lymphocyte markers and clonality of inflammatory cells. Increased risk of small intestinal lymphoma is especially associated with type II disease, which has a poorer prognosis. Type I is often treated with corticosteroids and azathioprine.},

   abstract = {Celiac disease (CD) is an autoimmune inflammatory disease of the small intestine as a result of reaction to wheat protein, gluten. Exclusion of dietary gluten is the mainstay of the treatment that necessitates a precise diagnosis of the disease. Serological screening may aid in identifying patients with suspected CD, which should be confirmed by intestinal biopsy. It has been shown that duodenal biopsies are good for detection of the disease in most patients. However, there is a group of patients with positive serology and inconclusive pathology. As a result of the widespread use of serology, many patients with equivocal findings grow quickly. Unfortunately current endoscopic methods can only diagnose villous atrophy, which can be present in the later grades of disease (i.e., Marsh III). To diagnose CD correctly, going deeper in the intestine may be necessary. Enteroscopy can reveal changes in CD in the intestinal mucosa in 10%-17% of cases that have negative histology at initial workup. Invasiveness of the method limits its use. Capsule endoscopy may be a good substitute for enteroscopy. However, both techniques should be reserved for patients with suspected diagnosis of complications. This paper reviews the current literature in terms of the value of enteroscopy for diagnosis of CD.},

   abstract = {BACKGROUND: Coeliac disease, an autoimmune disorder triggered by gluten ingestion, is managed by a gluten-free diet (GFD), which is difficult for many patients. Larazotide acetate is a first-in-class oral peptide that prevents tight junction opening, and may reduce gluten uptake and associated sequelae. AIM: To evaluate the efficacy and tolerability of larazotide acetate during gluten challenge. METHODS: This exploratory, double-blind, randomised, placebo-controlled study included 184 patients maintaining a GFD before and during the study. After a GFD run-in, patients were randomised to larazotide acetate (1, 4, or 8 mg three times daily) or placebo and received 2.7 grams of gluten daily for 6 weeks. Outcomes included an experimental biomarker of intestinal permeability, the lactulose-to-mannitol (LAMA) ratio and clinical symptoms assessed by Gastrointestinal Symptom Rating Scale (GSRS) and anti-transglutaminase antibody levels. RESULTS: No significant differences in LAMA ratios were observed between larazotide acetate and placebo groups. Larazotide acetate 1-mg limited gluten-induced symptoms measured by GSRS (P = 0.002 vs. placebo). Mean ratio of anti-tissue transglutaminase IgA levels over baseline was 19.0 in the placebo group compared with 5.78 (P = 0.010), 3.88 (P = 0.005) and 7.72 (P = 0.025) in the larazotide acetate 1-, 4-, and 8-mg groups, respectively. Adverse event rates were similar between larazotide acetate and placebo groups. CONCLUSIONS: Larazotide acetate reduced gluten-induced immune reactivity and symptoms in patients with coeliac disease undergoing gluten challenge and was generally well tolerated; however, no significant difference in LAMA ratios between larazotide acetate and placebo was observed. Results and design of this exploratory study can inform the design of future studies of pharmacological interventions in patients with coeliac disease.},

   abstract = {OBJECTIVES: Because of a variable clinical picture, most children with celiac disease remain unrecognized without active serologic screening. Because, however, many patients are asymptomatic, the justification for screening remains unclear. We assessed health and well-being and the effect of a 1-year gluten-free diet in a nationwide cohort of children with celiac disease detected by screening in at-risk groups. METHODS: A total of 222 newly detected children received a validated questionnaire covering aspects of the burden caused by the undiagnosed celiac disease. After 1 year, adherence to the diet and difficulties attending this, attitudes toward and effects of disease and diet on daily life, and parents' satisfaction with the diagnosis were inquired about. The children's health and parents' concern for it were asked about at diagnosis and on treatment. The outcomes of screen-detected children were compared with those of children diagnosed on the basis of clinical symptoms. RESULTS: Forty-three screen-detected and 88 symptom-detected children responded. Also, 65% of the screen-detected patients experienced symptoms; these, however, being less troublesome and of shorter duration than in symptom-detected subjects. There were no differences between the groups in dietary adherence (71% vs 84% strict diet), management of the diet (80% vs 80%), alleviation of symptoms (78% vs 86%), and improvement in daily life (73% vs 69%), or in satisfaction with the diagnosis (93% vs 88%). Improved health and reduced parental concern were observed in both groups. CONCLUSIONS: Screen-detected children with celiac disease can attain satisfactory dietary adherence and benefit from treatment similarly to symptom-detected patients. The results support intensified screening for celiac disease in at-risk children.},

   abstract = {The gustatory and visceral stimulation from food regulates digestion and nutrient utilization, and free glutamate (Glu) release from food is responsible for the umami taste perception that increases food palatability. The results of recent studies reveal a variety of physiological roles for Glu. For example, luminal applications of Glu into the mouth, stomach, and intestine increase the afferent nerve activities of the glossopharyngeal nerve, the gastric branch of the vagus nerve, and the celiac branch of the vagus nerve, respectively. Additionally, luminal Glu evokes efferent nerve activation of each branch of the abdominal vagus nerve. The intragastric administration of Glu activates several brain areas (e.g., insular cortex, limbic system, and hypothalamus) and has been shown to induce flavor-preference learning in rats. Functional magnetic resonance imaging of rats has shown that the intragastric administration of Glu activates the nucleus tractus solitarius, amygdala, and lateral hypothalamus. In addition, Glu may increase flavor preference as a result of its postingestive effect. Considering these results, we propose that dietary Glu functions as a signal for the regulation of the gastrointestinal tract via the gut-brain axis and contributes to the maintenance of a healthy life.},

A 28-year-old woman presented with diarrhea, oral ulcers, and refractory uveitis of 2.5-years duration. She was treated with prednisone, mydriatic drops, and infliximab with no response. She was referred to our hospital at which point her previous diagnosis of uveitis was confirmed; she was also diagnosed with right-sided sacro-iliitis. The patient did not have arthritis or any skin conditions. Three tests for fecal parasites and a fecal leukocyte were negative. Endoscopy revealed atrophic appearance of the duodenal mucosa. Biopsy showed atrophy of the duodenal villi with intra-epithelial lymphocytes, hyperplasia of the crypts, and chronic inflammatory infiltrate. The search for antiendomysial antibody was >1/1,280. The patient was started on a gluten-free diet and after 3 months demonstrated significant improvement of gastrointestinal symptoms and uveitis, as well as a reduction of antiendomysial antibodies (1/80). After 6 months, there was complete remission of gastrointestinal symptoms and total control of uveitis. The antiendomysial antibody was negative at that time. Clinical uveitis as a manifestation of celiac disease has been described in only two cases in the literature. This case study is the third to demonstrate that uveitis is a clinical symptom that can be addressed in patients with celiac disease.},

   abstract = {A number of lines of evidence suggest that transglutaminase 2 (TG2) may be one of the earliest disease-relevant proteins to encounter immunotoxic gluten in the celiac gut. These and other investigations also suggest that the reaction catalyzed by TG2 on dietary gluten peptides is essential for the pathogenesis of celiac disease. If so, several questions are of critical significance. How is TG2 activated in the celiac gut? What are the disease-specific and general consequences of activating TG2? Can local inhibition of TG2 in the celiac intestine suppress gluten induced pathogenesis in a dose-responsive manner? And what are the long-term consequences of suppressing TG2 activity in the small intestinal mucosa? Answers to these questions will depend upon the development of judicious models and chemical tools. They also have the potential of yielding powerful next-generation drug candidates for treating this widespread but overlooked chronic disease.},

   abstract = {UNLABELLED: Coeliac disease (CD) is an immune-mediated systemic condition elicited by gluten and related prolamines in genetically predisposed individuals and characterised by gluten-induced symptoms and signs, specific antibodies, a specific human leukocyte antigen (HLA) type and enteropathy. The risk of coeliac disease is increased in first-degree relatives, certain syndromes including Down syndrome and autoimmune disorders. It is thought to occur in 1 in 100-200 individuals, but still only one in four cases is diagnosed. Small-bowel biopsy is no longer deemed necessary in a subgroup of patients, i.e. when all of the following are present: typical symptoms or signs, high titres of and transglutaminase antibodies, endomysial antibodies, and HLA-type DQ2 or DQ8. In all other cases, small-bowel biopsy remains mandatory for a correct diagnosis. Therapy consists of a strictly gluten-free diet. This should result in complete disappearance of symptoms and of serological markers. Adequate follow-up is considered essential. CONCLUSION: Although small-bowel biopsy may be omitted in a minority of patients, small-bowel biopsy is essential for a correct diagnosis of CD in all other cases. Diagnostic work-up should be completed before treatment with gluten-free diet instituted.},

   abstract = {Type 1 diabetes (T1D) is perceived as a progressive immune-mediated disease, the clinical diagnosis of which is preceded by an asymptomatic preclinical period of highly variable duration. It has long been postulated that the disease process leading to overt T1D is triggered by an infectious agent, the strongest candidate being a diabetogenic enterovirus. The initiation and progression of the disorder likely requires, in addition to genetic T1D susceptibility, a trigger, an exogenous antigen capable of driving the development of this disease. This may be a dietary antigen similar to gluten in celiac disease. Recent data further suggests that the initiation of autoimmunity is preceded by inflammation reflected by a proinflammatory metabolic serum profile. The cause of the inflammation remains open, but given that the intestinal microbiome appears to differ between individuals who progress to clinical T1D and nonprogressors, one may speculate that changes in the gut microflora might contribute to the inflammatory process.},

This study has confirmed that the commercial oat supply in Canada is heavily contaminated with gluten from other grains. Approximately 88% of the oat samples (n = 133) were contaminated above 20 mg kg(-1) and there were no differences between the oat types tested. Only one gluten-free variety of oats was analysed and it consistently provided negative results in all analyses. It is difficult to determine where the contamination originates, but there are possibilities for cross-contamination in the field, in the transport of the grain, in the storage of the grain, and in the milling and packaging facilities. It is clear from this study that only those products that have been certified 'pure' oats would be appropriate for a gluten-free diet.},

   abstract = {PURPOSE: Computer simulations are utilized during pharmaceutical development in order to design appropriate formulation based on the absorption, distribution, metabolism, and excretion (ADME) and physicochemical properties of target compounds, so that adequate prescriptions are offered to patients. Oro-cecal transit time (OCTT) is an important factor affecting these simulations because the absorption of drug that administered orally and the resultant pharmacokinetic profile are expressed as a function of time. Given the large intra- and inter-individual variance in OCTT, it is unsurprising that an accurate model has not yet been proposed. METHODS: We conducted a meta-analysis using subject-level data to construct a statistical model that predicted OCTT. Literature that utilized lactulose to measure OCTT was identified and analyzed using a mixed-effects model. RESULTS: The OCTTs of fasting healthy subjects were expressed using a linear model, with the amount of lactulose as the single significant explanatory factor. We found that this model could statistically distinguish the OCTTs of subjects with altered physical status from those of healthy people. Specifically, cystic fibrosis and celiac disease most significantly affected OCTT. CONCLUSION: The OCTT models developed herein incorporate inter-subject variations and can contribute to providing more accurate predictions of drug pharmacokinetic profiles.},

   abstract = {Stress, which is defined as an acute threat to homeostasis, shows both short- and long-term effects on the functions of the gastrointestinal tract. Exposure to stress results in alterations of the brain-gut interactions ("brain-gut axis") ultimately leading to the development of a broad array of gastrointestinal disorders including inflammatory bowel disease (IBD), irritable bowel syndrome (IBS) and other functional gastrointestinal diseases, food antigen-related adverse responses, peptic ulcer and gastroesophageal reflux disease (GERD). The major effects of stress on gut physiology include: 1) alterations in gastrointestinal motility; 2) increase in visceral perception; 3) changes in gastrointestinal secretion; 4) increase in intestinal permeability; 5) negative effects on regenerative capacity of gastrointestinal mucosa and mucosal blood flow; and 6) negative effects on intestinal microbiota. Mast cells (MC) are important effectors of brain-gut axis that translate the stress signals into the release of a wide range of neurotransmitters and proinflammatory cytokines, which may profoundly affect the gastrointestinal physiology. IBS represents the most important gastrointestinal disorder in humans, and is characterized by chronic or recurrent pain associated with altered bowel motility. The diagnostic testing for IBS patients include routine blood tests, stool tests, celiac disease serology, abdominal sonography, breath testing to rule out carbohydrate (lactose, fructose, etc.) intolerance and small intestinal bacterial overgrowth. Colonoscopy is recommended if alarming symptoms are present or to obtain colonic biopsies especially in patients with diarrhoea predominant IBS. The management of IBS is based on a multifactorial approach and includes pharmacotherapy targeted against the predominant symptom, behavioural and psychological treatment, dietary alterations, education, reassurance and effective patient-physician relationship. When evaluating for the stress-induced condition in the upper GI tract, the diagnostic testing includes mainly blood tests and gastroscopy to rule out GERD and peptic ulcer disease. The therapy for these conditions is mainly based on the inhibition of gastric acid by proton pump inhibitors and eradication of Helicobacter pylori-infection. Additionally, melatonin an important mediator of brain gut axis has been shown to exhibit important protective effects against stress-induced lesions in the gastrointestinal tract. Finally, probiotics may profoundly affect the brain-gut interactions ("microbiome-gut-brain axis") and attenuate the development of stress-induced disorders in both the upper and lower gastrointestinal tract. Further studies on the brain-gut axis are needed to open new therapeutic avenues in the future.},

   abstract = {OBJECTIVES: Earlier studies suggest that 40-50% of untreated celiac disease patients have elevated transaminase levels. Celiac disease can also be the underlying reason for unexplained hypertransaminasemia or even liver failure. We investigated the prevalence and gluten dependency of hypertransaminasemia in celiac patients also diagnosed with minor or atypical symptoms. METHODS: In the cross-sectional study, serum aspartate (AST) and alanine (ALT) transaminase levels were measured in 313 untreated and 339 treated adult celiac patients and 237 non-celiac controls. In the prospective part, transaminase levels were investigated in 130 celiac patients at diagnosis and after 1 year on a gluten-free diet and in 25 treated celiac patients in clinical remission before and after gluten challenge. RESULTS: The proportion of subjects with elevated serum AST values in the untreated celiac disease group (11%) did not differ significantly from that in the treated celiac disease (8%) or non-celiac control groups (9%) (P=0.587). Although the serum transaminase values were within normal range in the majority of untreated patients, initially normal liver enzyme levels decreased significantly on a gluten-free diet. In treated celiac disease, gluten challenge led to mild and transient hypertransaminasemia. CONCLUSIONS: In our area, where the prevalence of celiac disease is high, hypertransaminasemia is less frequent in untreated celiac disease patients than previously reported. The regular screening of transaminases in celiac disease needs to be re-evaluated. Although the liver enzyme levels were within the reference values in the majority of celiac patients, an obvious gluten dependence of transaminase levels was observed even in these subjects.},

According to ESPGHAN and EFSA introduction of solid foods in the diet of infants between 4-6 months of age is safe. AIM OF STUDY: Evaluation of feeding practices in healthy full-term infants after implementation of the recommendations of coeliac disease prevention. MATERIAL AND METHODS: Conducted analysis concerned 54 healthy full-term infants, living in Warsaw, aged 6 to 12 months. Of these, 27 children were exclusively breastfed for the first 6 months of life and 27 children were non-breastfed. The differences between selected parameters of nutritional status and diets of breastfed and nonbreastfed infants were evaluated by using t-Student test. Relations between quantitative variables were assessed by chi2 test. RESULTS: Products containing gluten were introduced into the breastfed children's diet in the 5th month of life in 22% of studied subgroup, in the 6th month - in 15%, in the 7th or 8th month - in 30%, between 9th and 11th month - in 22% and 11% of these children have not received food containing gluten in the first year of life. In the group of non-breastfed infants 15% received products with gluten before 5th month of life, 15% in 5th month, 11% at age of 6 months, 22% between 7th and 8th month, 15% in 11th month and 22% of children have not received food containing gluten in the first 12 months of life. An average daily intake of foods with varying content of gluten amounted to 55 g in breastfed infants and 70.5 g in non-breastfed infants (p <0.05). CONCLUSIONS: In the pilot study it was found out that nutritional recommendations concerning prophylaxis of coeliac disease were not implemented correctly by the majority of mothers of studied infants. Products containing gluten were introduced to the infant's diet too early or too late and mostly in larger quantities than it was recommended. Due to the small number of studied children it is important to carry out the investigation on a larger sample. At the same time it is necessary to introduce more effective methods of implementing nutritional recommendations concerning prophylaxis of celiac disease.},

The patient was immunosuppressed with hypogammaglobulinemia, which is common in CLL. Thus, the patient had negative serological studies for celiac disease. An endoscopic evaluation and HLA typing supported the diagnosis of celiac disease. Although the differential diagnosis was broad, exclusion of other etiologies for diarrhea, prompt diagnosis of celiac disease and initiation of gluten-free diet resolved the crisis.

And also you can find comprehensive method for the treatment of patients with varying severity of disease. The fundamental method of therapy glutensensitive celiac disease is strict lifelong adherence to a gluten-free diet (GFD), which eliminated protein cereal--gluten contained in wheat, rye and barley. Recently, there is large number of products which include the "hidden gluten". Its elimination from the diet of GFD is mandatory for patients with celiac disease. In the presence of diarrhea and malabsorption syndrome are used adsorbents, astringents, enzymes, intestinal antiseptic, probiotics. With the purpose of correction of metabolic disorders intravenous electrolyte mixture containing potassium, calcium and magnesium. To eliminate protein deficiency drugs used solid protein mixture of pure amino acids, gluten-free mixes for enteral feeding. Clinical examination of patients with celiac disease is aimed at monitoring compliance with GFD, early detection of cancer, autoimmune and other related diseases.},

Despite decades of research, the mechanisms behind celiac disease etiology are still not fully understood, although it is clear that both genetic and environmental factors are involved. To improve the understanding of the disease, the genetic component has been extensively studied by genome-wide association studies. These have uncovered a wealth of information that still needs further investigation to clarify its importance. In this review, we summarize and discuss the results of the genetic studies in celiac disease, focusing on the "non-HLA" genes. We also present novel approaches to identifying the causal variants in complex susceptibility loci and disease mechanisms.},

In recent years the health-related quality of life has become an important issue in this context, and most studies carried out so far have shown diminished quality of life in untreated patients compared with healthy controls. Furthermore, there has generally been a beneficial response to treatment with a gluten-free diet. However, the majority of trials have been carried out among adults with gastrointestinal disease, while in fact several extraintestinal and atypical forms of celiac disease might be even more common than the classical disorder. In addition, only a small proportion of these studies have been conducted among children. This article highlights the studies of health-related quality of life and celiac disease conducted to date. Particular attention is paid to the extraintestinal and atypical forms of the disorder.},

   abstract = {AIMS: Diagnostics and follow-up of celiac disease have gradually shifted from tertiary centers to secondary and primary health care. In order to establish whether this has affected the success of treatment, and to identify predictors for dietary non-adherence, we carried out a study in a nationwide cohort of treated celiac patients. PATIENTS AND METHODS: 843 biopsy-proven patients, 94 children and 749 adults, were enrolled and interviewed. Adherence to a gluten-free diet was determined by means of an interview and serological testing. RESULTS: Altogether, 88% were on a strict gluten-free diet; the rest had occasional dietary transgressions. Younger age at diagnosis, being currently a teenager, and current symptoms were associated with non-adherence. There was no association between non-adherence and place of diagnosis, gender, disease phenotype or severity of symptoms before diagnosis, presence of comorbidities, family history of celiac disease, smoking, duration of diet, use of oats, self-efficacy for the diet or lack of follow-up. CONCLUSIONS: Good dietary adherence can be achieved also in patients diagnosed and followed in primary health care. In a country with a high prevalence and good general knowledge of celiac disease, only age at diagnosis and age at present would appear to be major determinants for adherence.},

   abstract = {BACKGROUND AND GOALS: The widely used serum endomysial (EmA) and transglutaminase 2 (TG2-ab) antibodies predict forthcoming villous damage and celiac disease when the small-bowel mucosa structure is still normal. However, these autoantibodies may remain negative in this early stage of the disease. We hypothesized that the antibodies against deamidated gliadin peptides (DGP-AGA) might appear before the other antibodies and would thus be useful in the diagnosis and follow-up of patients with early-stage celiac disease. STUDY: Serum DGP-AGA, TG2-ab, and EmA were measured at baseline and after 1 year on a gluten-free diet in 42 adults proven to have early-stage celiac disease despite normal small-bowel mucosal morphology (Marsh I-II), and in 20 celiac subjects evincing villous atrophy (Marsh III). Thirty-nine subjects with no signs of celiac disease served as nonceliac controls. RESULTS: Sensitivity to detect early-stage celiac disease was 79% for DGP-AGA, 64% for TG2-ab, and 81% for EmA. Specificities were 95%, 100%, and 100%, respectively. The corresponding efficiencies of the tests were 89% for DGP-AGA, 81% for TG2-ab, and 91% for EmA. All 3 antibodies were significantly decreased on a gluten-free diet. CONCLUSIONS: This study showed that the sensitivity of DGP-AGA was superior to TG2-ab and comparable to EmA in celiac patients having early-stage celiac disease with normal villous morphology. On the basis of these results, DGP-AGA would seem to offer a promising new method for case-finding and follow-up in this entity.},

METHODS: Besides subjects with classical gastrointestinal presentation of celiac disease, the study cohort included a substantial number of individuals with extraintestinal symptoms and those found by screening in at-risk groups. Altogether 405 patients underwent clinical, serological and histological evaluations. After collection of data, the antibody values were further graded as low [endomysial (EmA) 1:5-200, transglutaminase 2 antibodies (TG2-ab) 5.0-30.0 U/L] and high (EmA 1: >/= 500, TG2-ab >/= 30.0 U/L), and the serological results were compared with the small intestinal mucosal histology and clinical presentation. RESULTS: In total, 79% of the subjects with low and 94% of those with high serum EmA titers showed small-bowel mucosal villous atrophy. Furthermore, 96% of the 47 EmA positive subjects who had normal mucosal villi and remained on follow-up either subsequently developed mucosal atrophy while on a gluten-containing diet, or responded positively to a gluten-free diet. CONCLUSION: Irrespective of the initial serum titers or clinical presentation, EmA positivity as such is a very strong predictor of a subsequent celiac disease diagnosis.},

   abstract = {INTRODUCTION: Celiac disease is a common autoimmune condition induced by dietary gluten in genetically susceptible individuals. So far, the only available treatment for the disorder is a lifelong strict gluten-free diet, because of which small intestinal histological changes recover and symptoms disappear. However, gluten-free dieting is restrictive, and nutritionally less than optimal, and gluten is difficult to avoid. AREAS COVERED: With improving insight into the pathogenesis of celiac disease, several possible drug targets have been suggested. The new strategies include degradation of gluten intraluminally, reduction of mucosal permeability, inhibition of the transglutaminase 2 enzyme, blocking antigen presentation by HLA-DQ2 or HLA-DQ8, modulation of the immune responses of many cytokines, and vaccination. EXPERT OPINION: Non-dietary treatment options are warranted either as adjunctive therapy together with dieting or to replace the gluten-free diet. The key question is whether the envisaged novel drug is able to prevent gluten-induced small intestinal mucosal injury as efficiently as a strict gluten-free diet, alleviating symptoms and signs of the disease. Furthermore, the gluten dose that can be detoxified, if at all, must be established. The new drug should also be as safe as dietary treatment. Several novel treatment options are under development.},

   abstract = {BACKGROUND: Due to the restrictive nature of a gluten-free diet, celiac patients are looking for alternative therapies. While drug-development programs include gluten challenges, knowledge regarding the duration of gluten challenge and gluten dosage is insufficient.We challenged adult celiac patients with gluten with a view to assessing the amount needed to cause some small-bowel mucosal deterioration. METHODS: Twenty-five celiac disease adults were challenged with low (1-3 g) or moderate (3-5g) doses of gluten daily for 12 weeks. Symptoms, small-bowel morphology, densities of CD3+ intraepithelial lymphocytes (IELs) and celiac serology were determined. RESULTS: Both moderate and low amounts of gluten induced small-bowel morphological damage in 67% of celiac patients. Moderate gluten doses also triggered mucosal inflammation and more gastrointestinal symptoms leading to premature withdrawals in seven cases. In 22% of those who developed significant small- intestinal damage, symptoms remained absent. Celiac antibodies seroconverted in 43% of the patients. CONCLUSIONS: Low amounts of gluten can also cause significant mucosal deterioration in the majority of the patients. As there are always some celiac disease patients who will not respond within these conditions, sample sizes must be sufficiently large to attain to statistical power in analysis.},

   abstract = {OBJECTIVE: To study T-helper (Th)1-Th2-Th3 gene activation profile in the small intestine and peripheral blood of children with celiac disease (CD) with special interest in the response to the gluten-free diet (GFD) treatment in order to elucidate an immune dysregulation not triggered by gluten. MATERIAL AND METHODS: Small intestinal biopsies and venous blood were taken from seven children with CD (mean age: 8 years, four girls) at presentation and after 1 year of strict GFD. The Th1-Th2-Th3 gene expression profile was examined by real-time PCR arrays. The findings were compared with the corresponding expressions in peripheral blood and small intestinal biopsies from six reference children without CD (mean age: 6 years, four girls). RESULTS: The Th1 gene expression profile including interferon (IFN)-gamma, signal transducer and activator of transcription (STAT) 1 and interferon regulatory factor (IRF) 1 together with reduced interleukin (IL)-2 expression was pronounced in small intestinal biopsies from children with untreated CD. A downregulation of IFN-gamma transcripts was seen after 1 year of GFD, but there was still increased expression of STAT1 and IRF1 in association with low IL-2 expression in spite of eliminated exposure to wheat gluten. By contrast, the decreased intestinal expression of Th2 gene markers observed at presentation was normalized with GFD. The alterations in the mucosal gene expression profile were not reflected in peripheral blood. CONCLUSION: The GFD did not correct the increased activation of the IFN-gamma signaling pathway related markers and reduced IL-2 expression, suggesting that they represent an immune dysregulation not dependent on gluten exposure.},

   abstract = {Up-regulation of interleukin (IL)-17 in small intestinal mucosa has been reported in coeliac disease (CD) and in peripheral blood in type 1 diabetes (T1D). We explored mucosal IL-17 immunity in different stages of CD, including transglutaminase antibody (TGA)-positive children with potential CD, children with untreated and gluten-free diet-treated CD and in children with T1D. Immunohistochemistry was used for identification of IL-17 and forkhead box protein 3 (FoxP3)-positive cells and quantitative polymerase chain reaction (qPCR) for IL-17, FoxP3, retinoic acid-related orphan receptor (ROR)c and interferon (IFN)-gamma transcripts. IL-1beta, IL-6 and IL-17 were studied in supernatants from biopsy cultures. Expression of the apoptotic markers BAX and bcl-2 was evaluated in IL-17-stimulated CaCo-2 cells. The mucosal expression of IL-17 and FoxP3 transcripts were elevated in individuals with untreated CD when compared with the TGA-negative reference children, children with potential CD or gluten-free diet-treated children with CD (P < 0.005 for all IL-17 comparisons and P < 0.01 for all FoxP3 comparisons). The numbers of IL-17-positive cells were higher in lamina propria in children with CD than in children with T1D (P < 0.05). In biopsy specimens from patients with untreated CD, enhanced spontaneous secretion of IL-1beta, IL-6 and IL-17 was seen. Activation of anti-apoptotic bcl-2 in IL-17-treated CaCo-2 epithelial cells suggests that IL-17 might be involved in mucosal protection. Up-regulation of IL-17 could, however, serve as a biomarker for the development of villous atrophy and active CD.},

   abstract = {Nutritional factors, as sources of luminal antigens, have been thought to be important factors in the immunopathogenesis of numerous gastrointestinal diseases. In some diseases, the role of the nutritional component is causal in the susceptible host. Such diseases include celiac disease, a common heritable chronic inflammatory condition of the small intestine induced by dietary wheat, rye and barley, in susceptible individuals. Specific HLA-DQ2 and HLA-DQ8 risk alleles are necessary, but not sufficient, for disease development. The well-defined role of HLA-DQ heterodimers encoded by these alleles is to present cereal peptides to CD4+ T cells, activating an inflammatory immune response in the intestine. Genome-wide association studies have been performed which identified the IL2-IL21 risk locus and other genes with immune functions and key roles in thymic T-cell selection. Another example for this group is Wilson's disease, an autosomal recessive disorder of copper metabolism caused by mutation of the ATP7B gene, resulting in a defect of biliary copper excretion and toxic accumulation in the body, especially in the liver, brain and cornea, resulting in hepatic and/or neurological symptoms. In other diseases, however, the association is less well established. In such endeavor, epidemiological observations may become a valuable part of the overall investigations aimed at identifying dietary factors, which are involved in the initiation and perpetuation of the specific disease. As an example, relationships between nutrition and colorectal cancer have been hypothesized early on (e.g. folate, calcium, vitamin D, red meat). Similarly, intake of certain diet constituents like fat, refined sugar, fruits, vegetables and fiber was reported to be associated with the expression of inflammatory bowel diseases. In addition, in children with active Crohn's disease, enteral nutrition was found to be equally effective as corticosteroids in induction of remission, with mucosal healing induced by downregulation of mucosal pro-inflammatory cytokine profiles in both the ileum and the colon after enteral nutrition. However, the particular effect of the consumption of each type of food remains questionable in most cases, at least in part because of insufficient data and serious methodological limitations (e.g. recall bias, heterogeneity between collected data, lack of correction for covariates, difficulties in double blinding).},

Patients may present with typical symptoms of enteropathy with diarrhoea and failure to thrive, but atypical symptoms, or even silent forms are more often recognized since serologic markers are available. This progress led to the increase of the incidence of the celiac disease during the last 30 years, which reflect probably the improvement in diagnosing atypical forms of the disease. The prevalence is comparable from a country to another, around 0,7 to 2%. There is a progression with time from latent to silent form, and then to the active disease. The exclusion of the gluten from the diet leads to the regression from the active to the latent form of the disease.},

   abstract = {T cell recognition of gliadin from dietary gluten is essential for the pathogenesis of coeliac disease (CD). The aim of the present study was to analyse whether gliadin-specific T cells are detectable in the circulation of children with newly diagnosed coeliac disease by using a sensitive carboxfluorescein diacetate succinimidyl ester (CFSE) dilution method. Peripheral blood CD4(+) T cell responses were analysed in 20 children at diagnosis of CD and compared to those in 64 healthy control children carrying the CD-associated human leucocyte antigen (HLA)-DQ2 or -DQ8 alleles. Deamidated gliadin (gTG)-specific T cells were detectable in the peripheral blood of more than half the children with CD (11 of 20, 55%) compared to 15 of 64 (23.4%) of the control children (P = 0.008). Proliferative responses to gTG were also significantly stronger in children with CD than in controls (P = 0.01). In contrast, T cells specific to native gliadin were detectable at comparable frequencies in children with CD (two of 19, 10.5%) and controls (13 of 64, 20.3%). gTG-specific T cells had a memory phenotype more often than those specific to native gliadin in children with CD (P = 0.02), whereas controls had similar percentages of memory cells in both stimulations. Finally, gTG-specific CD4(+) T cells had a higher expression of the gut-homing molecule beta7 integrin than those specific to the control antigen tetanus toxoid. Collectively, our current results demonstrate that the frequency of circulating memory CD4(+) T cells specific to gTG but not native gliadin is increased in children with newly diagnosed CD.},

   abstract = {Various mechanisms detect the presence of dietary triacylglycerols (TAG) in the digestive tract and link TAG ingestion to the regulation of energy homeostasis. We here propose a novel sensing mechanism with the potential to encode dietary TAG-derived energy by translating enterocyte fatty acid oxidation (FAO) into vagal afferent signals controlling eating. Peripheral FAO has long been implicated in the control of eating (141). The prevailing view was that mercaptoacetate (MA) and other FAO inhibitors stimulate eating by modulating vagal afferent signaling from the liver. This concept has been challenged because hepatic parenchymal vagal afferent innervation is scarce and because experimentally induced changes in hepatic FAO often fail to affect eating. Nevertheless, intraperitoneally administered MA acts in the abdomen to stimulate eating because this effect was blocked by subdiaphragmatic vagal deafferentation (21), a surgical technique that eliminates all vagal afferents from the upper gut. These and other data support a role of the small intestine rather than the liver as a FAO sensor that can influence eating. After intrajejunal infusions, MA also stimulated eating in rats through vagal afferent signaling, and after infusion into the superior mesenteric artery, MA increased the activity of celiac vagal afferent fibers originating in the proximal small intestine. Also, pharmacological interference with TAG synthesis targeting the small intestine induced a metabolic profile indicative of increased FAO and inhibited eating in rats on a high-fat diet but not on chow. Finally, cell culture studies indicate that enterocytes oxidize fatty acids, which can be modified pharmacologically. Thus enterocytes may sense dietary TAG-derived fatty acids via FAO and influence eating through changes in intestinal vagal afferent activity. Further studies are necessary to identify the link between enterocyte FAO and vagal afferents and to examine the specificity and potential physiological relevance of such a mechanism.},

   abstract = {Evidence indicates a well-established relationship between low bone mineral density (BMD) and celiac disease (CD), but data on the pathogenesis of bone derangement in this setting are still inconclusive. In patients with symptomatic CD, low BMD appears to be directly related to the intestinal malabsorption. Adherence to a strict gluten-free diet (GFD) will reverse the histological changes in the intestine and also the biochemical evidence of calcium malabsorption, resulting in rapid increase of BMD. Nevertheless, GFD improves BMD but does not normalize it in all patients, even after the recovery of intestinal mucosa. Other mechanisms of bone injury than calcium and vitamin D malabsorption are thought to be involved, such as proinflammatory cytokines, parathyroid function abnormalities, and misbalanced bone remodeling factors, most of all represented by the receptor activator of nuclear factor B/receptor activator of nuclear factor B-ligand/osteoprotegerin system. By means of dual-energy X-ray absorptiometry (DXA), it is now rapid and easy to obtain semiquantitative values of BMD. However, the question is still open about who and when submit to DXA evaluation in CD, in order to estimate risk of fractures. Furthermore, additional information on the role of nutritional supplements and alternative therapies is needed.},

   abstract = {AIM: To investigate risk factors for low bone mineral density (BMD) in celiac disease (CD) patients, focusing on circulating autoantibodies against osteoprotegerin (OPG). METHODS: Seventy asymptomatic CD adult patients on gluten-free diet (GFD) and harbouring persistent negative CD-related serology were recruited. Conventional risk factors for osteoporosis (e.g., age, sex, menopausal status, history of fractures, smoke, and body mass index) were checked and BMD was assessed by dual energy X ray absorptiometry. Serum calcium and parathyroid hormone (PTH) levels were evaluated. Thirty-eight patients underwent repeat duodenal biopsy. Serum samples from a selected sub-group of 30 patients, who were also typed for human leukocyte antigen (HLA) DQ2 and DQ8 haplotype, were incubated with homodimeric recombinant human OPG and tested by western blotting with an anti-OPG antibody after immunoprecipitation. RESULTS: Despite persistent negative CD-related serology and strict adherence to GFD, 49 out of the 70 (74%) patients displayed low BMD. Among these patients, 13 (24%) showed osteoporosis and 36 (76%) osteopenia. With the exception of age, conventional risk factors for osteoporosis did not differ between patients with normal and low BMD. Circulating serum calcium and PTH levels were normal in all patients. Duodenal mucosa healing was found in 31 (82%) out of 38 patients who underwent repeat duodenal biopsy with 20 (64%) still displaying low BMD. The remaining 7 patients had an incomplete normalization of duodenal mucosa with 6 (84%) showing low BMD. No evidence of circulating antibodies against OPG was found in the serum of 30 celiac patients who were tested for, independent of BMD, duodenal histology, and HLA status. CONCLUSION: If any, the role of circulating autoantibodies against OPG in the pathogenesis of bone derangement in patients with CD is not a major one.},

Its detection is of high interest for food safety of celiac patients, since the only treatment known until now is a lifelong avoidance of this protein in the diet. Therefore, it is essential to have an easy and reliable method of analysis to control the contents in gluten-free foods. An electrochemical magneto immunosensor for the quantification of gliadin or small gliadin fragments in natural or pretreated food samples is described for the first time and compared to a novel magneto-ELISA system based on optical detection. The immunological reaction was performed on magnetic beads as solid support by the oriented covalent immobilization, of the protein gliadin on tosyl-activated beads. Direct, as well as indirect competitive immunoassays were optimized, achieving the best analytical performance with the direct competitive format. Excellent detection limits (in the order of mug L(-1)) were achieved, according to the legislation for gluten-free products. The matrix effect, as well as the performance of the assays was successfully evaluated using spiked gluten-free foodstuffs (skimmed milk and beer), obtaining excellent recovery values in the results.},

   abstract = {BACKGROUND: Coeliac disease (CD), characterised by the presence of villous atrophy (VA) in the small intestine, is associated with increased mortality, but it is unknown if mortality is influenced by mucosal recovery. AIMS: To determine whether persistent VA is associated with mortality in CD. METHODS: Through biopsy reports from all pathology departments (n = 28) in Sweden, we identified 7648 individuals with CD (defined as VA) who had undergone a follow-up biopsy within 5 years following diagnosis. We used Cox regression to examine mortality according to follow-up biopsy. RESULTS: The mean age of CD diagnosis was 28.4; 63% were female; and the median follow-up after diagnosis was 11.5 years. The overall mortality rate of patients who underwent follow-up biopsy was lower than that of those who did not undergo follow-up biopsy (Hazard Ratio 0.88, 95% CI: 0.80-0.96). Of the 7648 patients who underwent follow-up biopsy, persistent VA was present in 3317 (43%). There were 606 (8%) deaths. Patients with persistent VA were not at increased risk of death compared with those with mucosal healing (HR: 1.01; 95% CI: 0.86-1.19). Mortality was not increased in children with persistent VA (HR: 1.09 95% CI: 0.37-3.16) or adults (HR 1.00 95% CI: 0.85-1.18), including adults older than age 50 years (HR: 0.96 95% CI: 0.80-1.14). CONCLUSIONS: Persistent villous atrophy is not associated with increased mortality in coeliac disease. While a follow-up biopsy will allow detection of refractory disease in symptomatic patients, in the select population of patients who undergo repeat biopsy, persistent villous atrophy is not useful in predicting future mortality.},

   abstract = {BACKGROUND: The only treatment for coeliac disease is lifelong adherence to a rigorous gluten-free diet. The present study aimed to evaluate the influence of coeliac disease on the social aspects of daily life of individuals in the U.S.A. METHODS: The present study used a self-administered survey including the standard Quality of Life questionnaire (12-item short-form) with validated disease-specific questions. sas statistical software 2010 (SAS Institute, Cary, NC, U.S.A.) was used to calculate the mean (SD). RESULTS: Individuals with coeliac disease overall had a low positive health perception. Validated diet and disease-specific questions revealed a significant negative impact on quality of life in social settings. Specifically, the areas of travel, dining out and family life are most affected. The negative impact of diet significantly decreased over time, although it did not resolve for the domains of dining out of the home and travel. Those diagnosed in childhood and maintained on the diet had less of an impact on the quality of life as an adult. CONCLUSIONS: Individuals with coeliac disease in the U.S.A. have a diminished quality of life, especially in the social aspects of life.},

   abstract = {OBJECTIVE: The implications of celiac disease (CD) in adult patients with type 1 diabetes are unknown, with respect to diabetes-related outcomes including glycemic control, lipids, microvascular complications, quality of life, and the effect of a gluten-free diet (GFD). We identified CD in adults with type 1 diabetes and investigated the effect of a GFD on diabetes-related complications. RESEARCH DESIGN AND METHODS: This was a case-control study conducted at a U.K. teaching hospital. Patients with type 1 diabetes aged >16 years (n = 1,000) were assessed for CD. HbA(1c), lipid profile, quality of life, retinopathy stage, nephropathy stage, and degree of neuropathy before and after 1 year on a GFD were assessed. RESULTS: The prevalence of CD was 33 per 1,000 subjects (3.3% [95% CI 2.3-4.6]). At diagnosis of CD, adult type 1 diabetic patients had worse glycemic control (8.2 vs. 7.5%, P = 0.05), lower total cholesterol (4.1 vs. 4.9, P = 0.014), lower HDL cholesterol (1.1 vs. 1.6, P = 0.017), and a higher prevalence of retinopathy (58.3 vs. 25%, P = 0.02), nephropathy (41.6 vs. 4.2%, P = 0.009), and peripheral neuropathy (41.6 vs. 16.6%, P = 0.11). There was no difference in quality of life (P > 0.1). After 1 year on a GFD, only the lipid profile improved overall, but in adherent individuals HbA(1c) and markers for nephropathy improved. CONCLUSIONS: Adults with undetected CD and type 1 diabetes have worse glycemic control and a higher prevalence of retinopathy and nephropathy. Treatment with a GFD for 1 year is safe in adults with type 1 diabetes and does not have a negative impact on the quality of life.},

Based on serologic studies, the prevalence of celiac disease in many populations is estimated to be approximately 1% and has been increasing steadily over the last 50 years. Evaluation for celiac disease is generally straightforward and uses commonly available serologic tests; however, the signs and symptoms of celiac disease are nonspecific and highly heterogeneous, making diagnosis difficult. Although celiac disease is often considered a mild disorder treatable with simple dietary changes, in reality celiac disease imparts considerable risks, including reduced bone mineral density, impaired quality of life, and increased overall mortality. In addition, a gluten-free diet is highly burdensome and can profoundly affect patients and their families. For these reasons, care of individuals with celiac disease requires prompt diagnosis and ongoing multidisciplinary management.},

   abstract = {OBJECTIVE: Coeliac disease is defined by gluten responsiveness, yet there are few data on gluten challenge (GC) in adults on a gluten-free diet. Lack of data regarding the kinetics of responses to gluten is a limitation in clinical practice and research when GC is performed. DESIGN: 20 adults with biopsy-proven coeliac disease participated. The study included two run-in visits followed by a 14-day GC at a randomly assigned dose of 3 or 7.5 g of gluten/day. Study visits occurred 3, 7, 14 and 28 days after starting GC. Duodenal biopsy was performed during the run-in and at days 3 and 14 of GC. Villous height to crypt depth ratio (Vh:Cd) and intraepithelial lymphocyte (IEL) count/100 enterocytes were measured by two pathologists. Antibodies to tissue transglutaminase and deamidated gliadin peptides, lactulose to mannitol ratio (LAMA) and symptoms were assessed at each visit. RESULTS: Significant reduction in Vh:Cd (2.2-1.1, p<0.001) and increase in IELs (32.6-51.8, p<0.001) were seen from baseline to day 14. Antibody titres increased slightly from baseline to day 14 of GC but markedly by day 28. LAMA did not change significantly. Gastrointestinal symptoms increased significantly by day 3 and returned to baseline by day 28. No differences were seen between the two gluten doses. CONCLUSIONS: 14 day GC at >/= 3 g of gluten/day induces histological and serological changes in the majority of adults with coeliac disease. These data permit accurate design of clinical trials and indicate that many individuals will meet coeliac diagnostic criteria after a 2-week GC.},

   abstract = {OBJECTIVES: In patients with celiac disease, enteropathy is caused by the entry of gluten peptides into the lamina propria of the intestine, in which their immunogenicity is potentiated by tissue transglutaminase (tTG) and T-helper type 1-mediated immune responses are triggered. Tight junction disassembly and paracellular permeability are believed to have an important role in the transport of gluten peptides to the lamina propria. Larazotide acetate is a tight-junction regulator peptide that, in vitro, prevents the opening of intestinal epithelial tight junctions. The aim of this study was to evaluate the efficacy and tolerability of larazotide acetate in protecting against gluten-induced intestinal permeability and gastrointestinal symptom severity in patients with celiac disease. METHODS: In this dose-ranging, placebo-controlled study, 86 patients with celiac disease controlled through diet were randomly assigned to larazotide acetate (0.25, 1, 4, or 8 mg) or placebo three times per day with or without gluten challenge (2.4 g/day) for 14 days. The primary efficacy outcome was the urinary lactulose/mannitol (LAMA) fractional excretion ratio. Secondary endpoints included gastrointestinal symptom severity, quality-of-life measures, and antibodies to tTG. RESULTS: LAMA measurements were highly variable in the outpatient setting. The increase in LAMA ratio associated with the gluten challenge was not statistically significantly greater than the increase in the gluten-free control. Among patients receiving the gluten challenge, the difference in the LAMA ratios for the larazotide acetate and placebo groups was not statistically significant. However, larazotide acetate appeared to limit gluten-induced worsening of gastrointestinal symptom severity as measured by the Gastrointestinal Symptom Rating Scale at some lower doses but not at the higher dose. Symptoms worsened significantly in the gluten challenge-placebo arm compared with the placebo-placebo arm, suggesting that 2.4 g of gluten per day is sufficient to induce reproducible gluten toxicity. Larazotide acetate was generally well tolerated. No serious adverse events were observed. The most common adverse events were headache and urinary tract infection. CONCLUSIONS: LAMA variability in the outpatient setting precluded accurate assessment of the effect of larazotide acetate on intestinal permeability. However, some lower doses of larazotide acetate appeared to prevent the increase in gastrointestinal symptom severity induced by gluten challenge.},

   abstract = {This article reviews the multiple uses of flow cytometry in the diagnosis, monitoring and research of celiac disease, the most prevalent chronic autoimmune gastrointestinal disease. The phenotyping of intraepithelial lymphocytes (IELs) is of clinical relevance in the diagnosis of the disease given the characteristic features of elevated CD3+ IELs (alphabeta and gammadelta TcR) and the decrease in CD3- IELs. IEL biomarkers are also useful in the assessment of the response to the gluten-free diet and, importantly, in the diagnosis of the severe complications of celiac disease: refractory celiac disease and enteropathy-associated T-cell lymphoma. Novel applications of flow cytometry for the detection of anti-transglutaminase antibodies (a validated biomarker of celiac disease) and of gluten (the triggering antigen of the autoimmune process) are also discussed. The assessment of diagnostic and prognostic biomarkers by flow cytometry in celiac disease is performed routinely in a growing number of centers and it is an example of the versatility of this technique and its applicability to the research and clinical study of solid tissues.},

   abstract = {AIM: To compare intradermal (ID) and intramuscular (IM) booster doses, which have been used in healthy and high risk subjects, such as healthcare workers, haemodialysis patients, human immunodeficiency virus patients, and renal transplant recipients unresponsive to initial hepatitis B vaccination, in celiac individuals. METHODS: We conducted our study on 58 celiac patients, vaccinated in the first year of life, whose blood analysis had showed the absence of protective hepatitis B virus (HBV) antibodies. All patients had received the last vaccine injection at least one year before study enrolment and they had been on a gluten free diet for at least 1 year. In all patients we randomly performed an HBV vaccine booster dose by ID or IM route. Thirty celiac patients were revaccinated with recombinant hepatitis B vaccine (Engerix B) 2 mug by the ID route, while 28 celiac patients were revaccinated with Engerix B 10 mug by the IM route. Four weeks after every booster dose, the anti-hepatitis B surface (HBs) antibody titer was measured by an enzyme-linked immune-adsorbent assay. We performed a maximum of three booster doses in patients with no anti-HBs antibodies after the first or the second vaccine dose. The cut off value for a negative anti-HBs antibody titer was 10 IU/L. Patients with values between 10 and 100 IU/L were considered "low responders" while patients with an antibody titer higher than 1000 IU/L were considered "high responders". RESULTS: No significant difference in age, gender, duration of illness, and years of gluten intake was found between the two groups. We found a high percentage of "responders" after the first booster dose (ID = 76.7%, IM = 78.6%) and a greater increase after the third dose (ID = 90%, IM = 96.4%) of vaccine in both groups. Moreover we found a significantly higher number of high responders (with an anti-HBs antibody titer > 1000 IU/L) in the ID (40%) than in the IM (7.1%) group, and this difference was evident after the first booster dose of vaccination (P < 0.01). No side effects were recorded in performing delivery of the vaccine by either the ID or IM route. CONCLUSION: Our study suggests that both ID and IM routes are effective and safe options to administer a booster dose of HBV vaccine in celiac patients. However the ID route seems to achieve a greater number of high responders and to have a better cost/benefit ratio.},

   abstract = {Celiac disease is a common autoimmune disease affecting 1% of the Western populations. It is an inappropriate immune response, in genetically susceptible patients to dietary wheat, rye, barley and oats. Treatment involves a Lifelong gluten-free diet that predisposes to low compliance due to limited variety, high cost and low palatability, imposing social pressure and affecting quality of life. The result is an urgent need for alternative therapeutic strategies. Based on the growing actual knowledge on the intestinal inflammatory cascade, mucosal immunology and genetics of celiac disease, new attractive potential therapies are emerging. Possibilities include: searching for low immunogenic wheat variants or strains pretreated with enzymes or binders for lower toxicity. Other strategies involve decreasing transepithelial uptake or dampening of the adaptive immune response by transglutaminase inhibitors or blockage of the HLA groove and immune modulation to shift the TH1 to TH2 profile. Developing biological therapy aims to decrease intestinal homing, adhesion and activity of inflammatory cells, counteract the pro-inflammatory cytokines, clonal intestinal T cells or mesenchymal stem cell replacement or mitogenic intestinal repair safety, cost, affordability and clinical effectiveness are of prime concern. Most of the above strategies showed promising results ex-vivo. The future will highlight the in-vivo winner.},

Vitamin D serum levels were investigated in CD populations in order to challenge its routine supplementation. Israeli (61), Spanish (59), CD children (groups 1 and 5, respectively) were compared to children with nonspecific abdominal pain (56), their parents (84) and Spanish adult CD patients (22) (group 2, 3, 4, respectively). 25(OH)-vitamin D was checked by LIAISON chemiluminescent immunoassays.

Concerning 25(OH)-vitamin D sera levels, only the difference between group 5 and 4 was statistically significant (30.3 +/- 12.3 and 20.2 +/- 10.5 ng/ml, respectively p=0.003). When vitamin D was splitted above and below 20 ng/ml level, 54.5% of Spanish adult CD had vitamin D deficiency compared to 16.9% of the local CD children (p=0.001). 29.6% of group 2 had deficient levels compared to their parents with 50% (p=0.019). In conclusion, Vitamin D sera levels negatively correlate with age. Thus, mainly adult CD population should be assessed for vitamin D levels and supplemented accordingly.},

   abstract = {OBJECTIVES: Traditional celiac disease guidelines recommend follow-up endoscopy and duodenal biopsies at 6-12 months after commencing a gluten-free diet (GFD). However, histology may remain abnormal even 1-2 years later. We evaluated the role of capsule endoscopy in patients with celiac disease after treatment with a GFD. METHODS: Twelve adult patients with newly diagnosed celiac disease were prospectively enrolled. All patients had baseline symptom assessment, celiac serology (tissue transglutaminase antibody, tTG), and capsule endoscopy. Twelve months after commencing a GFD, patients underwent repeat symptom assessment, celiac serology, upper gastrointestinal endoscopy, and capsule endoscopy. RESULTS: At baseline, capsule endoscopy detected endoscopic markers of villous atrophy in the duodenum and extending to a variable distance along the small intestine. On the basis of small bowel transit time, the mean+/-s.e.m. percentage of small intestine with villous atrophy was 18.2+/-3.7%. After 12 months on a GFD, repeat capsule endoscopy demonstrated mucosal healing from a distal to proximal direction, and the percentage of small intestine with villous atrophy was significantly reduced to 3.4+/-1.2% (P=0.0014) and this correlated with improvement in the symptom score (correlation 0.69, P=0.01). There was a significant improvement in symptom score (5.2+/-1.0 vs. 1.7+/-0.4, P=0.0012) and reduction in immunoglobulin A-tTG levels (81.5+/-10.6 vs. 17.5+/-8.2, P=0.0005). However, 42% of subjects demonstrated persistent villous abnormality as assessed by duodenal histology. CONCLUSIONS: After 12 months on a GFD, patients with celiac disease demonstrate an improvement in symptoms, celiac serology, and the extent of disease as measured by capsule endoscopy. Mucosal healing occurs in a distal to proximal direction. The extent of mucosal healing correlates with improvement in symptoms. Duodenal histology does not reflect the healing that has occurred more distally.},

   abstract = {BACKGROUND: Celiac disease (CD) is induced by wheat gluten and related prolamines. Its prevalence may be underestimated in many geographic regions and populations, and has recently increased in several countries. In 1998 and 1999, a random sample of Estonian schoolchildren was screened with IgA-type tissue transglutaminase antibodies (IgA-tTG) for CD. The results revealed a CD prevalence of 0.34%, which is lower compared with many other European countries. OBJECTIVE: We rescreened the same population for CD using IgA-tTG after a 10-year interval. MATERIALS AND METHODS: A total of 891 patients from the initial sample were rescreened using the IgA-tTG assay for a participation rate of 76.8% (median age, 24.3 years). As in the initial study, the IgA-tTG results were evaluated by ImmunoCAP EliA Celikey using an IgG-tTG and deamidated gliadin antibody assay for IgA-deficient cases. RESULTS: No new cases of CD were found in this follow-up study. Of note, 75% of patients with initial IgA-tTG-positive results and biopsy-proven CD remained seropositive. One patient with a negative seroconversion at the time of rescreening followed a strict gluten-free diet during the follow-up years. CONCLUSION: In a 10-year follow-up period, no new cases of CD were found in this Estonian population of school-children and young adults. Therefore, we presume no increase in CD during the last decade among this age group in Estonia. Additional studies are needed to determine whether similar results would be obtained in other age groups, because of differences in the CD prevalence between Estonian and other European populations.},

We studied diagnostic accuracy of serodiagnostic assays using TG2 in its open and closed conformation as antigens in patients with diagnostic difficulties. The open TG2 antibody (TG2ab) test identified 93% of untreated celiac patients in contrast to 44%, 27%, and 68% detected by closed and conventional TG2ab and endomysial antibody (EmA) tests, respectively. The assay was able to detect 60% of non-responding celiac patients seronegative for conventional TG2ab and EmA. The titers of the open TG2abs were higher than those of the closed TG2abs. The serological test utilizing TG2 in an open conformation was more accurate than the other assays in finding active celiac disease even in patients having negative or borderline conventional celiac autoantibodies and in revealing poor dietary response non-invasively. It thus offers a promising tool in the diagnostics and follow-up of celiac disease.},

   abstract = {BACKGROUND: It has been suggested that antibodies against transglutaminase (TG) 6 could serve as a biomarker to identify a subgroup of gluten-sensitive patients who may be at risk of developing neurological disease. We here investigated whether TG6-targeted autoantibodies are a characteristic feature of celiac patients, especially those with neurological symptoms, and further, whether such antibodies are gluten-dependent. METHODS: Serum IgA-class TG6 autoantibodies were measured in untreated and treated celiac patients with and without neurological manifestions and in non-celiac controls. The results were compared to TG2 autoantibody levels. RESULTS: During a gluten-containing diet the number of TG6 autoantibody-positive celiac patients with neurological problems (25%) did not significantly differ from that of TG6-seropositive patients without neurological impairment (16%) or from non-celiac controls (15%). This was in contrast to our finding in TG2 autoantibody-positive individuals, whose numbers differed significantly between all three study groups. On a gluten-free diet the levels of TG6 autoantibodies remained unchanged. CONCLUSIONS: We conclude that the serum IgA-class TG6 autoantibody assay is not able to distinguish gluten-sensitive patients with neurological manifestations from celiac patients without neurological problems or from control subjects, and further, that TG6 autoantibodies are not gluten-dependent.},

   abstract = {INTRODUCTION: Ingestion of dietary gluten in wheat, rye and barley by celiac patients leads to small-bowel mucosal villous atrophy, crypt hyperplasia and massive inflammation, often coupled with clinical symptoms and signs. Currently, the only effective treatment is a strict life-long gluten-free diet excluding all gluten-containing food products. In view of the extremely restricted nature of the diet, new treatment options would clearly be desirable. AREAS COVERED: The improved understanding of celiac disease pathogenesis has enabled researchers to suggest alternative strategies to treat the disorder. This review covers current approaches toward developing an appropriate drug and discusses the possible problems associated with these approaches. EXPERT OPINION: Phase II clinical trials are already ongoing to test the efficacy of novel alternative treatments for celiac disease. Before any of the candidates can enter Phase III trials, however, researchers must develop novel reliable non-invasive surrogate markers for intestinal injury and disease activity which also accurately reflect patient-related outcomes. Any novel medication for celiac disease should be as effective and safe as the gluten-free diet, and this constitutes a challenge for drug development. It is thus likely that the first medication entering the market will be supplementary to rather than substitute the gluten-free diet.},

   abstract = {In genetically predisposed individuals, dietary gluten in wheat, rye and barley triggers celiac disease, a systemic autoimmune disorder hallmarked by an extensive small-bowel mucosal immune response. The current conception of celiac disease pathogenesis is that it involves components of both innate and adaptive immunity whose activation typically leads to small-bowel villous atrophy with crypt hyperplasia. Currently, the only effective treatment for celiac disease is a strict lifelong gluten-free diet excluding all wheat-, rye- and barley-containing food products. During the diet, the clinical symptoms improve and the small-bowel mucosal damage recovers, while re-introduction of gluten into the diet leads to re-appearance of the symptoms and deterioration of the small-bowel mucosal architecture. In view of the restricted nature of the diet, alternative treatment is warranted. Improved understanding of the molecular basis of celiac disease has enabled researchers to suggest other therapeutic approaches. Although there is no animal model reproducing all features of celiac disease, the use of in vitro approaches including a variety of cell lines and the celiac patient small-bowel mucosal biopsy organ culture has generated knowledge about pathogenesis of celiac disease. In these culture systems, gluten induces different effects that can be quantified, thus also enabling studies concerning the efficacy of candidate therapeutic compounds for celiac disease. This review describes the intestinal epithelial cell models, celiac patient T-cell lines and clones, as well as the small-bowel mucosal organ culture methods widely used in studies of celiac disease, and summarizes the major findings obtained with these systems.},

   abstract = {In celiac disease, gluten ingestion provokes small-bowel mucosal injury and production of IgA autoantibodies against transglutaminase 2 (TG2). It has been suggested that in celiac patients IgA could mediate the transepithelial passage of gluten peptides in a mechanism involving the transferrin receptor. As IgA1 with galactose-deficient O-linked glycans has elevated affinity for the transferrin receptor, we assessed whether total serum IgA1 and IgA1 anti-TG2 autoantibodies in celiac patients are aberrantly glycosylated. We report that males with celiac disease have higher total serum levels of galactose-deficient IgA1 than non-celiac males. Furthermore, O-glycans of the disease-specific TG2 IgA1 autoantibodies in celiac patients exhibited elevated galactose deficiency. A gluten-free diet had no effect on the total serum levels of galactose-deficient IgA1, whereas the amount of galactose-deficient anti-TG2 IgA1 decreased. Thus, the undergalactosylated IgA1 molecules are not pathognomonic for celiac disease, but galactose deficiency in IgA1 could be an aggravating factor.},

   abstract = {OBJECTIVE: To evaluate the frequency and the natural history of potential (serology positive/Marsh 0-1 histology) celiac disease (CD) in children with a family risk of CD and factors associated with potential instead of overt (serology positive/Marsh 2-3 histology) CD expression. STUDY DESIGN: Two-year follow-up study of 96 children (57 females; mean age: 29 +/- 12 months) prospectively investigated from birth with: (1) a CD-affected first-degree relative; (2) positivity of serum IgA anti-tissue transglutaminase (tTG) or IgG antigliadin and IgA deficiency; and (3) the results of small intestinal biopsy. Children with potential CD were advised to remain on a gluten containing diet, repeat the celiac antibodies every 6 months, and to have an intestinal biopsy performed in case of persistently high anti-tTG level. Factors discriminating between potential and overt CD were analyzed by decision tree analysis based on the C4.5 algorithm. RESULTS: Twenty-four children had potential and 72 overt CD. The stronger predictors of potential CD were lack of symptoms, anti-tTG level lower than 11-fold the upper normal limit, age lower than 24 months, and breastfeeding longer than 8 months. Eighteen out of 21 (86%) patients with potential CD continuing a gluten-containing diet became antibody negative, 1/21 (5%) developed overt CD, and 2/21 (9%) had fluctuating antibodies levels after 2 years. CONCLUSIONS: The prevalence of potential CD and the percentage of short-term loss of CD-related-antibodies are high in infants at-family-risk for CD. In symptomless children with a positive celiac serology, the decision of performing an intestinal biopsy should be preceded by a period of repeated serological testing.},

   abstract = {The aim of the present work was to assess the prevalence of early cardiac involvement in children with celiac disease (CD), and the impact of a gluten free diet (GFD) on this issue. Sixty CD children was compared with a control group of 45 healthy children by an echocardiographic examination. CD patients were re-evaluated 1-year after 1-year GFD. Main outcome measures were ejection fraction (EF), fractional shortening (FS), left ventricular end-diastolic diameter (LVDD), left ventricular end-systolic diameter (LVSD), any regurgitating valve lesions. Mild cardiac involvement was found in 13 CD children and in one control (21.7% vs. 2.2%; p=0.003), and was secondary to regurgitation of mitral valve, aortic valve, pulmonary and tricuspid valve, or to impaired ejection fraction. CD children as compared to controls had significantly lower contractility indices, and higher left ventricular dimensions. In patients adhering to the GFD all valve regurgitations resolved, and the echocardiographic parameters significantly improved. Subclinical cardiac involvement in CD children is quite frequent, and GFD may exert a beneficial effect on the overall cardiac performance.},

   abstract = {Oxidatively damaged DNA may be important in carcinogenesis. 8-Oxo-7,8-dihydroguanine (8-oxoGua) is an abundant and mutagenic lesion excised by oxoguanine DNA glycosylase 1 (OGG1) and measurable in urine or plasma by chromatographic methods with electrochemical or mass spectrometric detectors, reflecting the rate of damage in steady state. A common genetic OGG1 variant may affect the activity and was associated with increased levels of oxidized purines in leukocytes without apparent effect on 8-oxoGua excretion or major change in cancer risk. 8-OxoGua excretion has been associated with exposure to air pollution, toxic metals, tobacco smoke and low plasma antioxidant levels, whereas fruit and vegetable intake or dietary interventions showed no association. In rodent studies some types of feed may be source of 8-oxoGua in collected urine. Of cancer therapies, cisplatin increased 8-oxoGua excretion, whereas radiotherapy only showed such effects in experimental animals. Case-control studies found high excretion of 8-oxoGua in relation to cancer, dementia and celiac disease but not hemochromatosis, although associations could be a consequence rather than reflecting causality of disease. One prospective study found increased risk of developing lung cancer among non-smokers associated with high excretion of 8-oxoGua. Urinary excretion of 8-oxoGua is a promising biomarker of oxidatively damaged DNA.},

   abstract = {Celiac disease (CD) may often be associated with various motor disorders affecting the different segments of the digestive tract, including the esophagus. Although it has not been universally reported, some available evidences indicate that pediatric and adult celiac patients could manifest a higher frequency of esophagitis and gastroesophageal reflux disease-related symptoms compared to nonceliac patients. In addition, several published studies have consistently shown the efficacy of a gluten-free diet in rapidly controlling esophageal symptoms and in preventing their recurrence. Since the participation of gluten in the esophageal symptoms of CD seems clear, its intimate mechanisms have yet to be elucidated, and several hypothesis have been proposed, including the specific immune alterations characterizing CD, the reduction in nutrient absorption determining the arrival of intact gluten to distal gastrointestinal segments, and various dysregulations in the function of gastrointestinal hormones and peptides. Recent studies have suggested the existence of a possible relationship between CD and eosinophilic esophagitis, which should be more deeply investigated.},

However, patients with CD do not seem to be at an increased risk of malignancy, except for an increased risk of lymphoproliferative malignancy and gastrointestinal cancer. The evidence that a GFD reduces the risk of mortality is weak, but there is some evidence suggesting that a GFD may reduce the risk of lymphoproliferative malignancy.},

Many complementary foods contain gluten, but gluten exposure is associated with the risk of developing celiac disease (CD). CD is a disease with considerable morbidity and mortality. Although CD is associated with certain genetic features, carrying the human leukocyte antigen haplotypes DQ2 or DQ8 (a prerequisite for CD development) cannot fully explain who will or who will not develop CD. Potential risk factors for CD include perinatal events and infant feeding practice. With the exception that children who are breastfed at and beyond gluten introduction into the diet probably may be at a lower risk of developing CD, and that heavy gluten load early in life may increase the risk of future CD, data on the impact of infant feeding are inconsistent.},

   abstract = {OBJECTIVE: To describe the prevalence of Coeliac disease (CD) and its clinical management. METHODS: Narrative review. RESULTS: Coeliac disease (CD) is an immune-mediated disorder that primarily affects the gastrointestinal (GI) tract. Recent data suggest a prevalence of about 1% in most Western countries, a figure that likely represents an increase in the prevalence of CD. Risk groups include those who are members of families with individuals who have CD as well as those with Type I diabetes and a variety of autoimmune diseases. Whereas biopsy is the gold standard in diagnosis, serological tests are crucial in determining who should undergo endoscopy and biopsy. HLA testing should be used only to rule out CD. Currently, a gluten-free diet is the only available therapy. CONCLUSION: In conclusion, CD is one of the most common immune-mediated disorders in the Western world. It should be considered in patients with a number of varying GI and non-GI symptoms, as well as in high-risk groups that include first-degree relatives.},

   abstract = {OBJECTIVE: The literature suggests a lack of consensus on the use of terms related to coeliac disease (CD) and gluten. DESIGN: A multidisciplinary task force of 16 physicians from seven countries used the electronic database PubMed to review the literature for CD-related terms up to January 2011. Teams of physicians then suggested a definition for each term, followed by feedback of these definitions through a web survey on definitions, discussions during a meeting in Oslo and phone conferences. In addition to 'CD', the following descriptors of CD were evaluated (in alphabetical order): asymptomatic, atypical, classical, latent, non-classical, overt, paediatric classical, potential, refractory, silent, subclinical, symptomatic, typical, CD serology, CD autoimmunity, genetically at risk of CD, dermatitis herpetiformis, gluten, gluten ataxia, gluten intolerance, gluten sensitivity and gliadin-specific antibodies. RESULTS: CD was defined as 'a chronic small intestinal immune-mediated enteropathy precipitated by exposure to dietary gluten in genetically predisposed individuals'. Classical CD was defined as 'CD presenting with signs and symptoms of malabsorption. Diarrhoea, steatorrhoea, weight loss or growth failure is required.' 'Gluten-related disorders' is the suggested umbrella term for all diseases triggered by gluten and the term gluten intolerance should not to be used. Other definitions are presented in the paper. CONCLUSION: This paper presents the Oslo definitions for CD-related terms.},

Our aim is to verify anti-Neo-tTg IgA and IgG in adults with dermatitis herpetiformis (DH). METHODS: Multi-centric retrospective evaluation of the IgA/G autoantibodies in sera of DH patients on a regular diet (n=40) and a gluten restricted diet (GRD, n=53) and control adults with autoimmune skin diseases (n=107) by ELISA. RESULTS: The sensitivities of Celicheck Neo IgA/G (76%, 95% CI 67-84%) and the Neo tTg-A (85%, 95% CI 70-97%) ELISA were significantly greater than that of tTg-A (56%, 95% CI 46-67%), eTg-A (62%, 95% CI 52-72%), DGP-A (55%, 95% CI 55-65%), DGP-G (61%, 95% CI 51-71%), Glia-A (55%, 95% CI 45-65%) and Glia-G (56%, 95% CI 46-66%) ELISA. The specificities of all 8 ELISA were in the range of 90-100%. The area under the curve (AUC) of receiver operator characteristic curve (ROC) for the two Neo-tTg ELISA (0.863 and 0.949) were higher than the AUCs for ROCs of tTg, DGP and eTG ELISA (range between 0.657 and 0.783). The autoantibody levels of DH patients on a normal diet were significantly higher than those on GRD in the Celicheck Neo IgA/IgG, NeotTg-A; tTg-A and the eTg-A; ELISA (p<0.01) and of no significance in the DGP and Gliadin ELISA. CONCLUSION: Neo-epitope IgA autoantibodies represent a new and sensitive serological marker of DH.},

The study objective was to determine the interrelationships between vitamin K/D status and lifestyle variables on BMD in children and adolescents with CD at diagnosis and after 1 year on the gluten-free diet (GFD). SUBJECTS/METHODS: Children and adolescents aged 3-17 years with biopsy proven CD at diagnosis and after 1 year on the GFD were studied. BMD was measured using dual-energy X-ray absorptiometry. Relevant variables included: anthropometrics, vitamin D/K status, diet, physical activity and sunlight exposure. RESULTS: Whole-body and lumbar-spine BMD-z scores were low (< or = -1) at diagnosis (10-20%) and after 1 year (30-32%) in the children, independent of symptoms. Whole-body BMD-z scores (-0.55+/-0.7 versus 0.72+/-1.5) and serum levels of 25(OH) vitamin D (90.3+/-24.8 versus 70.5+/-19.8 nmol/l) were significantly lower in older children (>10 years) when compared with younger children (< or =10 years) (P<0.001). Forty-three percent had suboptimal vitamin D status (25(OH)-vitamin D <75 nmol/l) at diagnosis; resolving in nearly half after 1 year on the GFD. Twenty-five percent had suboptimal vitamin K status at diagnosis; all resolved after 1 year. CONCLUSIONS: Children and adolescents with CD are at risk for suboptimal bone health at time of diagnosis and after 1 year on GFD; likely due in part to suboptimal vitamin D/K status. Therapeutic strategies aimed at optimizing vitamin K/D intake may contribute to improved BMD in children with CD.},

   abstract = {BACKGROUND AND AIM: While celiac disease is estimated to affect about 1% of the world's population, it is thought to be uncommon not only in India but in Asia also. There is a lack of studies on the prevalence of celiac disease from Asian nations. The aim of the present study was to estimate the prevalence of celiac disease in the community. METHODS: In a cross sectional study, we estimated the prevalence of celiac disease in urban and rural populations in the National Capital Region, Delhi, India. A structured questionnaire was administered, by door-to-door visits, to all participants to collect socio-demographic data and to screen for features of celiac disease, namely chronic or recurrent diarrhea and, anemia. In children, additional features, namely short stature (linear height below 5th percentile for age) and failure to thrive/gain weight were also used. All respondents who were screen positive (any one of above) and 10% of screen negative individuals were called for serological testing, which is anti-tissue transglutaminase antibody. All serologically positive respondents were invited to undergo further evaluation including endoscopic biopsy. Celiac disease was diagnosed on the basis of a positive serology, the presence of villous atrophy and/or response to gluten free diet. RESULT: Among 12,573 contacted, 10,488 (83.4%) (50.6% male) agreed to participate. Based on screening, 5622 (53.6%) participants were screen positive. Of all those screen positive, 2167 (38.5%) agreed for serological testing; additionally 712 (14%) negatives were also tested. The overall sero-prevalence of celiac disease was 1.44% (95% confidence interval [CI] 1.22 1.69) and the overall prevalence of celiac disease was 1.04% (95% CI 0.85 1.25). CONCLUSION: The prevalence of celiac disease in this north Indian community is 1 in 96. Celiac disease is more common than is recognized in India.},

   abstract = {Celiac disease is an enteropathy due to gluten intake in genetically predisposed persons (HLA DQ2/DQ8). Celiac disease occurs in adults and children at rates approaching 1% of population in Europe and USA. Celiac disease is extremely various and anaemia, oral aphthous stomatis, amenorrhea or articular symptoms may be the only revealing symptoms. Diagnosis releases on evidence of histological villous atrophy in proximal small bowel and presence of specific serum antibodies. Treatment relies on eviction of gluten. Gluten free diet allows prevention of malignant complications such as small bowel adenocarcinoma and lymphoma and osteopenia. The main cause of resistance to gluten free diet is its bad observance. On the contrary, serious complications of celiac disease, such as clonal refractory celiac sprue and intestinal T-cell lymphoma need to be screen.},

   abstract = {Refractory celiac disease is defined by the persistence of symptoms of malnutrition and intestinal villous atrophy for more than 6-12 months despite strict gluten-free diet in celiac patients. Diagnosis of this rare condition is made after excluding other causes of chronic small intestinal inflammation and villous atrophy and inadvertent intake of gluten. Over the past 15 years, multidisciplinary approaches have been developed to assess the mechanism of resistance to the diet, and two distinct entities have been delineated. Type II refractory celiac disease (RCD) can be defined as a low-grade intraepithelial lymphoma. RCD II is characterised by a massive accumulation of abnormal IEL that display an aberrant hybrid NK/T cell phenotype, contain clonal T cell rearrangement(s) and can mediate a cytolytic attack of the gut epithelium. This condition has a severe prognosis, largely due to the frequent transformation of RCDII IEL into overt aggressive enteropathy-type-associated T cell lymphoma. In contrast, in type I RCD, intestinal lymphocytes have a normal phenotype, and this generally milder condition remains often difficult to differentiate from uncomplicated CD except for the resistance to gluten-free diet (GFD). Several mechanisms may underlie resistance to gluten. Herein, we review the distinctive characteristics of RCD I and RCD II, the mechanisms underlying the onset of resistance to GFD, the risk of developing high grade lymphoma and possible clues to improve their treatment.},

We describe 2 patients with celiac disease who no longer responded to gluten-free diets after they developed T-cell LGL, with intestinal localization of malignant lymphocytes. Flow cytometry phenotyping of isolated intestinal intraepithelial and lamina propria cells eliminated type II refractory celiac disease, identifying large-sized CD8(+)CD57(+) T cells. Treatment with a combination of cyclosporine and methotrexate restored the patients' sensitivity to gluten-free diets. LGL therefore might be a cause of refractory celiac disease that is sensitive to immunosuppressive therapy.},

   abstract = {Owing to its extensive use in the human diet, wheat is among the most common causes of food-related allergies and intolerances. Allergies to wheat are provoked by ingestion, inhalation or contact with either the soluble or the insoluble gluten proteins in wheat. Gluten proteins, and particularly the gliadin fraction, are also the main factor triggering celiac disease, a common enteropathy induced by ingestion of wheat gluten proteins and related prolamins from oat, rye and barley in genetically susceptible individuals. The role of gliadin and of its derived peptides in eliciting the adverse reactions in celiac disease are still far from being completely explained. Owing to its unique pathogenesis, celiac disease is widely investigated as a model immunogenetic disorder. The structural characterization of the injuring agents, the gluten proteins, assumes a particular significance in order to deepen the understanding of the events that trigger this and similar diseases at the molecular level. Recent developments in proteomics have provided an important contribution to the understanding of several basic aspects of wheat protein-related diseases. These include: the identification of gluten fractions and derived peptides involved in wheat allergy and intolerance, including celiac disease, and the elucidation of their mechanism of toxicity; the development and validation of sensitive and specific methods for detecting trace amounts of gluten proteins in gluten-free foods for intolerant patients; and the formulation of completely new substitute foods and ingredients to replace the gluten-based ones. In this article, the main aspects of current and prospective applications of mass spectrometry and proteomic technologies to the structural characterization of gluten proteins and derived peptides are critically presented, with a focus on issues related to their detection, identification and quantification, which are relevant to the biochemical, immunological and toxicological aspects of wheat intolerance.},

Sports medicine physicians need to recognize that celiac disease can present with a number of different symptoms and, therefore, should consider celiac disease as part of their differential in evaluating athletes with prolonged unexplained illnesses. Sports medicine physicians must be familiar with the appropriate laboratory tests and diagnostic procedures used to establish the diagnosis of celiac disease. A multidisciplinary approach in helping the newly diagnosed athlete with celiac disease is important to the successful treatment of the disease. Athletes with celiac disease often have problems with iron absorption (leading to anemia) and/or vitamin D and calcium absorption (leading to osteoporosis and poor bone health). Even athletes with known and long-standing celiac disease need additional care and supervision in ensuring there is no disruption in their gluten-free diet, which can lead to a flare-up of symptoms or a decrease in performance.},

   abstract = {BACKGROUND: Coeliac disease (CD) is a chronic condition requiring a gluten-free diet, which is a very demanding diet to maintain on a life-long basis. For this reason it is a condition that can have serious repercussions on the quality of life (QOL). Therefore the need to elaborate a questionnaire on QOL specifically for patients with CD (CDQ): its original language is German, and the translation/validation process represents a considerable challenge involving not only a translation into Italian but also an adaptation to the country's specific cultural differences. METHODS: The questionnaire has been translated according to a "German --> Italian --> Italian --> German" algorithm with reconciliation of the differences. Scores for CDQ are computed overall and over four areas of four items each: emotion, gastrointestinal symptoms, gastrointestinal worries, social problems. RESULTS: CDQ was administered to 171 coeliacs (F 132, mean age 38 yrs +/- 14). Completeness was optimal. Item internal consistency was satisfied for 100% and 97% of patients for the specific and generic part, respectively. Cronbach's alpha coefficient was 0.7 for all scales. The general CDQ was higher in patients reporting subjective well-being (discriminant validity). CONCLUSIONS: The Italian translation of CDQ sounds natural, is easy to understand and reduces possible cultural biases to a minimum. A field test gave results comparable to the original validation, supporting the use of CDQ in cross-national surveys.},

METHODS: Forty-five children at the time of diagnosis of CD (group A, 77.8% girls) and 36 children receiving GFD for >2 years (group B, 75% girls) were included. Sixteen children in group A were reexamined 12 months after initiation of GFD. Serum measurements of biochemical bone health indices and BMD, assessed by dual x-ray absorptiometry, were obtained. RESULTS: Patients after 1 year of receiving GFD had higher BMD z scores compared with baseline (-1.45 +/- 0.28 vs -0.61 +/- 0.25, respectively, P = 0.004). BMD z scores were significantly lower than expected for the normal population, after 1 (P = 0.03) or at least 2 (P < 0.001) years of receiving GFD. In group B, BMD z score was positively correlated with 25-hydroxy vitamin D levels (P = 0.009). In the repeated measurements group, 25-hydroxy vitamin D differed between pre- and post-GFD (P = 0.018). No biochemical index was capable of predicting an abnormal BMD z score (receiver operating characteristic curve analysis, all of the areas under the curve <0.66). CONCLUSIONS: GFD has a beneficial effect on bone health. Two years receiving diet do not ensure normalization. Biochemical markers are not indicative of BMD disturbances. Dual x-ray absorptiometry should be included in the standard management of children with CD.},

   abstract = {The initial development and maintenance of tolerance to dietary antigens is a complex process that, when prevented or interrupted, can lead to human disease. Understanding the mechanisms by which tolerance to specific dietary antigens is attained and maintained is crucial to our understanding of the pathogenesis of diseases related to intolerance of specific dietary antigens. Two diseases that are the result of intolerance to a dietary antigen are celiac disease (CD) and dermatitis herpetiformis (DH). Both of these diseases are dependent upon the ingestion of gluten (the protein fraction of wheat, rye, and barley) and manifest in the gastrointestinal tract and skin, respectively. These gluten-sensitive diseases are two examples of how devastating abnormal immune responses to a ubiquitous food can be. The well-recognized risk genotype for both is conferred by either of the HLA class II molecules DQ2 or DQ8. However, only a minority of individuals who carry these molecules will develop either disease. Also of interest is that the age at diagnosis can range from infancy to 70-80 years of age. This would indicate that intolerance to gluten may potentially be the result of two different phenomena. The first would be that, for various reasons, tolerance to gluten never developed in certain individuals, but that for other individuals, prior tolerance to gluten was lost at some point after childhood. Of recent interest is the concept of non-celiac gluten sensitivity, which manifests as chronic digestive or neurologic symptoms due to gluten, but through mechanisms that remain to be elucidated. This review will address how animal models of gluten-sensitive disorders have substantially contributed to a better understanding of how gluten intolerance can arise and cause disease.},

   abstract = {INTRODUCTION: It is well known that to improve the feeding of the students it would improve its health and wellbeing, contributing to the reduction of the risk of chronic diseases in adults. In Spain, this is especially important considering the data of prevalence of infantile obesity. OBJECTIVES: To know the number of users of school cafeterias in Spain as well as different considerations on its management, nutritional supervision and the number of special diets served to students with specific requirements due to pathologies or other causes. RESULTS: The II national Survey has been realized on school cafeterias: 7,710 used daily by 678,587 users. They provide near the 2.8% of special diets (allergies 38.9%, other pathologies 23.2%, religious causes 26.7% causes and celiac disease 11.1%). CONCLUSIONS: The numbers of prevalence of obesity and infantile overweight indicate that it is necessary to improve the diet of the students.},

Evaluation of the patient revealed elevated levels of serum amylase, lipase, and transaminase without any biliary obstruction. He had elevated serum IgG4 levels, and his computed tomography scan showed features consistent with autoimmune pancreatitis. Further evaluation revealed celiac disease. He was treated as a patient with autoimmune pancreatitis and was started on steroids in addition to a gluten-free diet. His liver function improved in 6 weeks. He gained weight and his glycemic control also improved. Magnetic resonance cholangiopancreatography after 3 months revealed complete resolution of pancreatic enlargement. The patient is being followed up in our clinic since the past 3 years. To the best of our knowledge and according to the Medline search, this is the first case report of celiac disease as an association of autoimmune pancreatitis.},

   abstract = {BACKGROUND: The aim of this study was to determine the occurrence of gluten sensitivity (GS) in a group of allergic patients and to assess the efficacy of a gluten-free diet (GFD) on the improvement of the symptomatology in those who were diagnosed with GS. METHODS: 262 unrelated allergic patients with gastrointestinal symptoms of obscure origin were tested for GS condition by biopsy. All patients were also genotyped for the typical celiac DQ2 and DQ8 molecules and investigated for several hematological parameters such as antigliadin and antiendomysial antibodies. Patients displaying mucosal lesions were invited to follow a GFD. RESULTS: Seventy-seven of the 262 allergic patients were positive to mucosal lesions, but negative to the antiAGA, antiEMA and to DQ2 and DQ8 molecules. We found, instead, a prevalence of the DQA1*05 allele, whereas anemia of inflammatory origin represented the predominant complaint in our subjects. The positive patients, who, after the GS diagnosis, followed a GFD, exhibited control of symptoms as well as stabilization of the hematological parameters even if allergic manifestations were not abated. CONCLUSIONS: A nonceliac gluten-sensitive enteropathy (NCGSE) commonly occurs in allergic patients. Based on the high prevalence of NCGSE in allergy, it is recommended that biopsy should be part of the routine investigation of allergic disease to offer the benefits of treatment with a GFD to the patients.},

   abstract = {BACKGROUND: Liver involvement in celiac disease (CD) is clinically relevant and could require specific treatment in addition to gluten-free diet (GFD). Transient elastography (TE), a noninvasive tool for assessing liver stiffness (LS), has widely been reported as an accurate surrogate marker of liver fibrosis. AIMS: To prospectively identify celiac patients with liver involvement by TE and to assess the effect of GFD. MATERIAL AND METHODS: Ninety-five histologically confirmed CD patients (24 newly diagnosed) were consecutively evaluated by TE and compared with 146 patients with chronic hepatitis C (HCV) and 54 healthy subjects. RESULTS: LS ranged between 2.8 and 6.7 kPa (median 4.9) in healthy subjects, defining 6.9 kPa as the upper reference limit (2 SD above the mean levels). TE was above 6.9 kPa in 10 (10.5%) CD patients. Median TE values resulted significantly higher in CD patients with hypertransaminasemia than those without [6.1 vs. 4.2 kPa (p < 0.01)]. Among the 24 newly diagnosed patients with CD, median TE values declined from 4.4 to 4 kPa, after 6 months of GFD, resulting below 6.9 kPa in 100% of the patients. CONCLUSIONS: A subset of CD patients with hypertransaminasemia showed liver involvement by TE. Accordingly, based on its accuracy in predicting liver fibrosis, TE could be used to identify those CD patients suitable for liver biopsy.},

There is a need to update the information available on this subject in Indian context. PROCESS: This review has analyzed the available published data on the subject with particular focus on developing countries. It has also outlined the current diagnostic and management practices in India based on the experience of the participants from major hospitals in different parts of the country. OBJECTIVES: Problem areas in both persistent and chronic diarrhea have been identified and remedial measures relevant to India are presented. RECOMMENDATIONS: Micronutrient supplementation, algorithm based diet regimens, and good supportive care are sufficient in most children above 6 months of age with persistent diarrhea. Paucity of diagnostic facilities limits evaluation of chronic diarrhea in most parts of the country and regional laboratories need to be set up urgently. Lack of awareness regarding cows milk protein allergy, celiac disease and immunodeficiency associated diarrhea is of particular concern.},

   abstract = {Celiac disease (CD) is an immune-mediated enteropathy triggered by the ingestion of gluten-containing grains that affects ~1% of the white ethnic population. In the last decades, a rise in prevalence of CD has been observed that cannot be fully explained by improved diagnostics. Genetic predisposition greatly influences the susceptibility of individuals towards CD, though environmental factors also play a role. With no pharmacological treatments available, the only option to keep CD in remission is a strict and permanent exclusion of dietary gluten. Such a gluten-free diet is difficult to maintain because of gluten's omnipresence in food (e.g., additive in processed food). The development of adjuvant therapies which would permit the intake of small amounts of gluten would be desirable to improve the quality of life of patients on a gluten-free diet. Such therapies include gluten-degrading enzymes, polymeric binders, desensitizing vaccines, anti-inflammatory drugs, transglutaminase 2 inhibitors, and HLA-DQ2 blockers. However, many of these approaches pose pharmaceutical challenges with respect to drug formulation and stability, or application route and dosing interval. This perspective article discusses how pharmaceutical scientists may deal with these challenges and contribute to the implementation of novel therapeutic options for patients with CD.},

   abstract = {A lifelong gluten-free diet (GFD) is mandatory for celiac disease (CD) but has poor compliance, justifying novel strategies. We found that wheat flour transamidation inhibited IFN-gamma secretion by intestinal T cells from CD patients. Herein, the primary endpoint was to evaluate the ability of transamidated gluten to maintain GFD CD patients in clinical remission. Secondary endpoints were efficacy in prevention of the inflammatory response and safety at the kidney level, where reaction products are metabolized. In a randomized single blinded, controlled 90-day trial, 47 GFD CD patients received 3.7 g/day of gluten from nontransamidated (12) or transamidated (35) flour. On day 15, 75% and 37% of patients in the control and experimental groups, respectively, showed clinical relapse (P = 0.04) whereas intestinal permeability was mainly altered in the control group (50% versus 20%, P = 0.06). On day 90, 0 controls and 14 patients in the experimental group completed the challenge with no variation of antitransglutaminase IgA (P = 0.63), Marsh-Oberhuber grading (P = 0.08), or intestinal IFN-gamma mRNA (P > 0.05). Creatinine clearance did not vary after 90 days of treatment (P = 0.46). In conclusion, transamidated gluten reduced the number of clinical relapses in challenged patients with no changes of baseline values for serological/mucosal CD markers and an unaltered kidney function.},

In the present study, children and adolescent suffering from celiac disease (CD) were compared with healthy controls to assess differences in the psychological profile. METHODS: A total of 100 well-treated and compliant CD patients (65 females/35 males; age mean +/- SD: 10.38 +/- 2.71) were compared to 100 normal controls (58 females/42 males; age mean +/- SD: 11.47 +/- 2.61). Emotional and behavioral problems were assessed by the Child Behavior Checklist (CBCL), the Children's Depression Inventory (CDI) and the Multidimensional Anxiety Scale for Children (MASC). RESULTS: Subjects with CD self-reported an increased rate of anxiety and depression symptoms and showed higher scores in "harm avoidance" and "somatic complaints", in the CBCL parent-report questionnaire, as compared to healthy control subjects. Furthermore, gender differences could be observed in the group of CD patients, with males displaying significantly higher CBCL externalizing scores, in social, thought and attention problems, as compared to female, who in turns showed more prominent internalizing symptoms such as depression. CONCLUSIONS: The increased rate of emotional and behavioral problems in children and adolescent with CD emphasizes the importance of an early detection of mental health problems in these children.},

   abstract = {Celiac disease is a T cell-mediated autoimmune inflammatory disease of the small intestine that is activated by gluten. The diagnosis of celiac disease is challenging as patients display a wide range of symptoms and some are asymptomatic. A lifelong gluten-free diet is the only currently approved treatment of celiac disease. Although the diet is safe and effective, the compliance rates and patient acceptance vary. Furthermore, many patients treated with a gluten-free diet continue to be mildly to severely symptomatic with persistent histological abnormalities, and a small number of patients develop refractory celiac disease. New therapeutic adjuncts and potential alternatives to the gluten-free diet could improve the treatment options for these patients. Advances in understanding the immunopathogenesis of celiac disease have suggested several types of therapeutic strategies that may augment or supplant the gluten-free diet. Some of these strategies attempt to decrease the immunogenicity of gluten-containing grains by manipulating the grain itself or by using oral enzymes to break down immunogenic peptides that normally remain intact during digestion. Other strategies focus on preventing the absorption of these peptides, preventing tissue transglutaminase from rendering gluten peptides more immunogenic, or inhibiting their binding to celiac disease-specific antigen-presenting molecules. Strategies that limit T cell migration to the small intestine or that reestablish mucosal homeostasis and tolerance to gluten antigens are also being explored. Additionally, it is vital to develop new therapeutic options for refractory celiac disease patients. This review highlights therapeutic strategies that may ultimately improve the health and well-being of individuals with celiac disease.},

   abstract = {Cavitating mesenteric lymph node syndrome (CMLNS) is a rare and poorly understood complication of coeliac disease (CD), with only 37 cases reported in the literature. CD is an immune-mediated enteropathy, with alterations seen in the small bowel architecture on exposure to ingested gluten. Those who fail to respond to a strict gluten-free diet are termed to have refractory coeliac disease (RCD). This is associated with serious complications such as enteropathy-associated T-cell lymphoma (EATL). We present the case of a 71-year-old female investigated for weight loss and a palpable intraabdominal mass. Abdominal computed tomographic (CT) scan showed multiple necrotic mesenteric lymph nodes. At operation, multiple cavitating mesenteric lymph nodes, containing milky fluid, were found. An incidental EATL was found at the terminal ileum, which was resected. The patient subsequently tested positive for CD. This is the second case report to document an association between CMLNS and EATL. This paper highlights the varied presentation of CD. In this case, the diagnosis of CD was made retrospectively after the complications were dealt with. This paper is followed by a review of relevant literature.},

More widespread serologic testing indicates that celiac disease affects 0.5% to 1% of the U.S. population, but presentation is highly variable and diagnosis is often missed or delayed. Strict adherence to a gluten-free diet remains the only treatment but can be challenging. This article outlines the pathophysiology of celiac disease, discusses signs and symptoms and the four disease types, describes testing, and addresses treatment and nursing implications.},

   abstract = {BACKGROUND: Celiac disease is an autoimmune disease that affects approximately 1% of the US population. Disease is characterized by damage to the small intestinal lining and malabsorption of nutrients. Celiac disease is activated in genetically susceptible individuals by dietary exposure to gluten in wheat and gluten-like proteins in rye and barley. Symptoms are diverse and include gastrointestinal and extraintestinal manifestations. Treatment requires strict adherence to a gluten-free diet. The Internet is a major source of health information about celiac disease. Nonetheless, information about celiac disease that is available on various websites often is questioned by patients and other health care professionals regarding its reliability and content. OBJECTIVES: To determine the accuracy, comprehensiveness, transparency, and readability of information on 100 of the most widely accessed websites that provide information on celiac disease. METHODS: Using the search term celiac disease, we analyzed 100 of the top English-language websites published by academic, commercial, nonprofit, and other professional (nonacademic) sources for accuracy, comprehensiveness, transparency, and reading grade level. Each site was assessed independently by 3 reviewers. Website accuracy and comprehensiveness were probed independently using a set of objective core information about celiac disease. We used 19 general criteria to assess website transparency. Website readability was determined by the Flesch-Kincaid reading grade level. Results for each parameter were analyzed independently. In addition, we weighted and combined parameters to generate an overall score, termed website quality. RESULTS: We included 98 websites in the final analysis. Of these, 47 (48%) provided specific information about celiac disease that was less than 95% accurate (ie, the predetermined cut-off considered a minimum acceptable level of accuracy). Independent of whether the information posted was accurate, 51 of 98 (52%) websites contained less than 50% of the core celiac disease information that was considered important for inclusion on websites that provide general information about celiac disease. Academic websites were significantly less transparent (P = .005) than commercial websites in attributing authorship, timeliness of information, sources of information, and other important disclosures. The type of website publisher did not predict website accuracy, comprehensiveness, or overall website quality. Only 4 of 98 (4%) websites achieved an overall quality score of 80 or above, which a priori was set as the minimum score for a website to be judged trustworthy and reliable. CONCLUSIONS: The information on many websites addressing celiac disease was not sufficiently accurate, comprehensive, and transparent, or presented at an appropriate reading grade level, to be considered sufficiently trustworthy and reliable for patients, health care providers, celiac disease support groups, and the general public. This has the potential to adversely affect decision making about important aspects of celiac disease, including its appropriate and proper diagnosis, treatment, and management.},

   abstract = {We present immunological data from two clinical trials where the effect of experimental human hookworm (Necator americanus) infection on the pathology of celiac disease was evaluated. We found that basal production of Interferon- (IFN-)gamma and Interleukin- (IL-)17A from duodenal biopsy culture was suppressed in hookworm-infected participants compared to uninfected controls. Increased levels of CD4+CD25+Foxp3+ cells in the circulation and mucosa are associated with active celiac disease. We show that this accumulation also occurs during a short-term (1 week) oral gluten challenge, and that hookworm infection suppressed the increase of circulating CD4+CD25+Foxp3+ cells during this challenge period. When duodenal biopsies from hookworm-infected participants were restimulated with the immunodominant gliadin peptide QE65, robust production of IL-2, IFN-gamma and IL-17A was detected, even prior to gluten challenge while participants were strictly adhering to a gluten-free diet. Intriguingly, IL-5 was produced only after hookworm infection in response to QE65. Thus we hypothesise that hookworm-induced TH2 and IL-10 cross-regulation of the TH1/TH17 inflammatory response may be responsible for the suppression of these responses during experimental hookworm infection.},

   abstract = {The only treatment for coeliac disease is to follow a strict, life-long gluten-free diet. It is therefore essential to use a highly sensitive, specific technique for gluten analysis in foods. Nowadays, the usual method for determining gluten content in gluten-free foods, internationally accepted by the Codex Alimentarius Commission, is the R5 antibody-based sandwich ELISA, combined with the cocktail-extraction solution. This technique requires at least two epitopes in the protein, but in hydrolysed foods, proteins are fragmented during food processing and converted into peptides in which only one toxic epitope may appear. Consequently, it was necessary to develop a new competitive immunoassay that, together with a reliable, compatible extraction solution, would provide a complete gluten analysis in any kind of food. We analysed commercial foods and home-made maize breads spiked with a known amount of gliadins using the sandwich R5 ELISA and the new competitive R5 ELISA that has been developed. These foods had previously been extracted with 60% ethanol/water, the cocktail solution or the new extracting solution called UPEX (universal prolamin and glutelin extractant solution). The complementary SDS-PAGE and western blot techniques were also used to confirm the gluten content. The limits of detection and quantification of the competitive R5 ELISA were 0.36 and 1.22 ng/ml of gliadins, respectively. The intra- and inter-assay precisions based on two samples were, respectively, 7.3% and 5.4% for the first sample and 9.9% and 6.3% for the second. This new assay was a better technique than the sandwich R5 ELISA for detecting gliadins quantitatively in hydrolysed foods. Regarding the extraction procedure, we did not find any significant interference from components of the UPEX solution at the concentration used. In addition, the UPEX solution extraction was compatible with the R5 western blot and mass spectrometry techniques. The competitive R5 ELISA we developed, combined with the UPEX solution described here, is a very useful tool for detecting and quantifying gluten in any kind of food samples, including heat-treated and/or hydrolysed ones.},

   abstract = {Celiac disease (CD) is a chronic enteropathy induced by dietary gluten in genetically predisposed people. The keystone of CD pathogenesis is an adaptive immune response orchestrated by the interplay between gluten and MHC class II HLA-DQ2 and DQ8 molecules. Yet, other factors that impair immunoregulatory mechanisms and/or activate the large population of intestinal intraepithelial lymphocytes (IEL) are indispensable for driving tissue damage. Herein, we summarize our current understanding of the mechanisms and consequences of the undesirable immune response initiated by gluten peptides. We show that CD is a model disease to decipher the role of MHC class II molecules in human immunopathology, to analyze the mechanisms that link tolerance to food proteins and autoimmunity, and to investigate how chronic activation of IEL can lead to T cell lymphomagenesis.},

We investigated the course of autoimmune thyroid diseases in newly diagnosed celiac disease patients before and after gluten-free dietary treatment. MATERIAL AND METHODS: Twenty-seven consecutive adults with newly diagnosed celiac disease were investigated at the time of diagnosis and after 1 year on gluten-free diet. Earlier diagnosed and subclinical autoimmune thyroid diseases were recorded and examined. Thyroid gland volume and echogenicity were measured by ultrasound. Autoantibodies against celiac disease and thyroiditis, and thyroid function tests were determined. For comparison, 27 non-celiac controls on normal gluten-containing diet were examined. RESULTS: At the time of diagnosis, the celiac disease patients had more manifest (n = 7) or subclinical (n = 3) thyroid diseases than the controls (10/27 vs. 3/27, p = 0.055). During the follow-up, the thyroid volume decreased significantly in the patients with celiac disease compared with the controls, indicating the progression of thyroid gland atrophy despite the gluten-free diet. CONCLUSIONS: Celiac patients had an increased risk of thyroid autoimmune disorders. A gluten-free diet seemed not to prevent the progression of autoimmune process during a follow-up of 1 year.},

Controversies include the appropriate surgical technique, the surgical approach, and the utility of postoperative stents. The literature is reviewed, and a case of CACS is presented in which a robotic-assisted division of the median arcuate ligament (MAL) was performed. METHODS: Robotic-assisted treatment of celiac artery syndrome was carried out using six (five 1 cm and one 2 cm) abdominal incisions. The robotic device was used to expose the aorta and celiac artery and divide the median arcuate ligament. RESULTS: Postoperatively, the patient's postprandial abdominal pain subsided. On 16 month follow-up, the patient was doing well, tolerated an unrestricted diet without symptoms, and exhibited weight gain. CONCLUSION: This case is the second reported in the literature and demonstrates that the robotic approach to division of the MAL is feasible, safe, and efficacious.},

A number of autoimmune and other disorders are highly associated with celiac disease. Cardiomyopathy associated with celiac disease has been rarely reported in the literature. CASE OUTLINE: We present a case of a 27-year-old male with one month history of diarrhea, weight loss, fatigue, dyspeptic symptoms, peripheral edema, and cardiac palpitations. After positive serological screening with immunoglobulin A anti-tissue transglutaminase antibody test, the diagnosis of celiac disease was confirmed with histopathology examination of duodenal biopsy specimen. Echocardiographic findings were consistent with acute myocarditis. After common causes of myocarditis had been excluded, probable celiac disease-associated autoimmune myocarditis was diagnosed. The patient was recommended to undergo a strict life-long gluten-free diet. IgA anti-transglutaminase antibodies, and anti-gliadin antibodies, were both significantly elevated during the 6-, 12- and 18-month follow-up. Low compliance to gluten-free diet in our patient led to progressive worsening of the left ventricular ejective fraction and other serious cardiac complications which warranted invasive cardiac interventions. CONCLUSION: Dilated cardiomyopathy associated with celiac disease is a serious condition which requires multidisciplinary approach involving gastroenterologist and cardiologist. Compliance with gluten-free diet is mandatory if patients are to avoid progression of cardiomyopathy. Screening of patients with idiopathic dilated cardiomyopathy for celiac disease is advisable.},

   abstract = {OBJECTIVE: The aims of this work were (1) to assess the oral health status of children with celiac disease (CD) with or without compliance with a gluten-free diet and in non-celiac children in a follow-up study and (2) to identify oral ecosystem changes that could be used as non-invasive monitoring methods for CD patients. STUDY DESIGN: An 18-month follow-up study in children of both genders, who were 4-12 years old during the study period, was performed. Decayed-missing-filled in temporary (dmft) and permanent teeth (DMFT), enamel alterations, oral hygiene, and gingival index were measured. Oral smears were collected by brushing. Flow rate, calcium, phosphate, pH, buffer capacity, fluoride, and Ca/P ratio were measured in saliva. Salivary protein profiles were performed. RESULTS: Most CD patients (80%) presented typical symptoms between 12 and 24 months old. Children with CD had a significantly low frequency of enamel alterations (30%) (p=0.0001). A high percentage of patients (63.15%) reported having had aphthous ulcers at several times. The celiac group showed significantly more polymorphonuclear neutrophils (PMNs) in smears (20% PMNs per area, p=0.0459) than the control group (0% PMNs per area) at baseline. In CD children, 90% of the samples that showed PMNs at baseline did not present them after 18 months. However, 10% of the smears of CD patients presented PMNs at the end of this study. Compliance with the gluten-free diet was controlled to detect the maintenance or worsening of signs and symptoms during the medical controls. CONCLUSIONS: The main differences amongst CD children who did or did not comply with a gluten-free diet and control children are the presence of PMNs in oral mucosa and protein salivary patterns; these findings could be considered as markers for CD, in conjunction with other signs and symptoms.},

There is paucity of data regarding the effect of gluten-free diet (GFD) on sexual maturity in patients with CD in India. We did a cross-sectional observational study to assess the sexual maturity in 30 adolescents with CD on GFD for at least 1 year, and evaluated factors which affect their sexual maturity. Sexual maturation was assessed using Tanner's stages of sexual development. All adolescents had completed 2 years of GFD and 53 % had completed 4 years of GFD. Sexual maturation was delayed in 30 %. Age at initiation of GFD was associated with attaining appropriate sexual maturity (p = 0.048). We conclude that delayed sexual maturation is not uncommon in adolescents with CD and may be corrected by early diagnosis and initiation of GFD.},

   abstract = {Abstract Coeliac disease (CD, sometimes called gluten-sensitive enteropathy or nontropical sprue) is an inflammatory disorder of the small intestine of autoimmune origin. It occurs in genetically predisposed people and is induced by a gluten protein, which is a component of wheat. The prevalence of histologically confirmed CD is estimated in screening studies of adults in the United States and Europe to be between 0.2% and 1.0%. The results of previous studies have indicated that the prevalence of CD is increased in patients with other autoimmune disorders such as: autoimmune thyroid diseases, type 1 diabetes mellitus, and Addison's disease. A coincidence of the above diseases constitutes autoimmune polyglandular syndrome (APS). The high prevalence of CD in APS is probably due to the common genetic predisposition to the coexistent autoimmune diseases. The majority of adult patients have the atypical or silent type of the disease. This is the main reason why CD so often goes undiagnosed or the diagnosis is delayed. CD, if undiagnosed and untreated, is associated with many medical disorders including haematological (anaemia), metabolical (osteopenia/osteoporosis), obstetric-gynaecological (infertility, spontaneous abortions, late puberty, early menopause), neurological (migraine, ataxia, epilepsy) as well as with an increased risk of malignancy, especially: enteropathy-associated T-cell lymphoma, small intestine adenocarcinoma, and oesophageal and oropharyngeal carcinomas. Early introduction of a gluten-free diet and lifelong adherence to this treatment decreases the risk of these complications.},

   abstract = {INTRODUCTION: The celiac disease (CD) is characterized by a permanent sensitivity to gluten. The treatment for this disease is the life-long strict compliance with a gluten-free diet (GFD). The average of compliance with GFD ranges between 15% and 80%. Antibodies' role in the follow up of these patients regarding the adherence to the GFD is not well established. Objective. To determine the relationship between the antibodies for CD and the adherence to the GFD in patients with over a year of treatment. MATERIAL AND METHODS: Patients with CD with a minimum of one year of GFD were prospectively included They were asked to complete a self-survey regarding to the compliance to GFD and the level of adherence was determined: low (no compliance or more than 2 gluten intakes per week), medium (1 or 2 gluten intakes per week or 2 or 3 gluten intakes per month), or high (1 gluten intake per month or less than 3 intakes per year). The follow up was performed by their general practitioners. From one year of GFD onwards, the results of the available antibodies at the time of the last follow up were assessed: antigliadine IgA (AGA) and IgG (AGG), anti-endomysium IgA (EMA) and IgG (EMG), anti-transglutaminase (ATG), and deaminated peptides of gliadine IgA and IgG, considering them as positive or negative. Through an univariate analysis, the above-mentioned antibodies were correlated (independent variables) in order to identify predicting factors of high and low adherence to the GFD (dependent variables). RESULTS: Ninety patients were analyzed, age 43.6 +/- 15.3 years old, 89% women, 58% classic celiacs. The average time of GFD was 7.9 years and 63% had been on a GFD for over 3 years. A 71% of patients (95% CI 69%-80%) showed high adherence to the GFD, and a 67% (95% CI 2%-13%) showed low adherence. GFD of less than 3 years was a determining factor for low adherence [relative risk (RR) 2.41 (95% CI 1.2-2.89)]. The predictive antibodies for GFD high adherence were: (1) negative EMA [RR 1.27 (95% CI 1.03-1.54)], (2) negative ATG [RR 1.62 (95% CI 1.12-2.47)], and (3) all negative requested ones [RR 1.60 (95% CI 1.17-2.18)]. The predictive antibodies for GFD low adherence were: (1) positive AGA [RR 15.5 (95% CI 2.29-105)], (2) positive EMA [RR 10.2 (95% CI 2.19-47.7)], (3) positive ATG [RR 9.63 (95% CI 1.53-63.4)], and 4) all negative requested ones [RR 0.11 (95% CI 0.018-0.71)]. CONCLUSION: After one year of treatment, the negativity of EMA or ATG antibodies had a significant correlation with the high adherence to GFD and the positivity of AGA, EMA or ATG antibodies had a significant correlation with a low adherence.},

QoL was assessed in the course of AD treatment of CD with application of universal standard questionnaire MOS SF-36. RESULTS: CD was diagnosed in 56 (8.6%) patients. Classic CD was diagnosed in 44 (78.6%) patients, atypical CD--in 12 (21.4%). Significant lowering of QoL characteristic psychological health" was observed in CD patients under 30 and over 50 and "physical health" in 30-50-year-old CD patients. Women had low points on "mental health" scale. After 3 AD months QoL worsened by all the scales, but after 12 months QoL significantly improved. CONCLUSION: QoL in patients with classic CD is associated with gender and age. First, AD deteriorates QoL, but 1-year diet therapy improves QoL.},

   abstract = {A major function of the enzyme intestinal alkaline phosphatase (iAP) is the detoxification of lipopolysaccharide (LPS), the ligand of Toll-like receptor 4 (TLR4). Hence, iAP has a role in the defence of maintaining intestinal barrier integrity. As intestinal barrier integrity is impaired in coeliac disease (CD), we tested the expression and localization of iAP in duodenal mucosa specimens from children with newly diagnosed CD (n = 10), with CD on gluten-free diet (GFD) (n = 5) and compared to those from ten healthy children. The mRNA and protein expression was determined by RT-PCR and Western blot analysis, respectively. Tissue localization of iAP and TLR4 was determined by immunofluorescence staining. iAP protein expression level was significantly lower than normal in newly diagnosed CD, while it was normalised in children on GFD. iAP and TLR4 colocalized at the epithelial surface of duodenal mucosa in each group of subjects enrolled. The finding of decreased iAP protein levels in newly diagnosed CD is consistent with its role in decreased intestinal barrier integrity. The latter may be the result of decreased LPS-detoxifying ability.},

   abstract = {OBJECTIVE: The aim of this study was to evaluate performance of serum antibodies against deamidated gliadin peptides (a-DGPs) in detecting compliance with gluten-free diet (GFD) in children with celiac disease (CD). PATIENTS AND METHODS: Serum samples were collected the same day of endoscopy in 95 children with CD and 106 controls. We preliminarily calculated the cutoff of a-DGP immunoglobulin A (IgA) and a-DGP IgA+G in our population by receiver operating characteristic (ROC) curves. Of 95 children with CD, 28 were studied during the first year after GFD introduction, with interview and serum collection every 3 months. In addition, serum samples were collected in 106 children with CD on GFD for more than 1 year (range 1-14). In both groups of children with CD on GFD, we compared a-DGP IgA and IgA+G performance in monitoring compliance with GFD with anti-tissue transglutaminase antibodies (anti-tTG) IgA and anti-gliadin antibody (AGA) IgA. RESULTS: The cutoff resulted in 13.1 arbitrary units (AU) for a-DGP IgA (sensitivity 87.4, 95% confidence interval [CI] 79%-92%, specificity 97.2, 95% CI 92%-99%) and 16.5 for a-DGP IgA+G (sensitivity 94.7, 95% CI 88%-98%, specificity 89.6, 95% CI 84%-95%). In the first year of GFD, at 6 to 8 months prevalence of positive a-DGPs was significantly higher in partially versus strictly compliant children, and at 9 to 12 months only prevalence of positive a-DGP IgA+G remained significantly higher. Moreover, at 9 to 12 months sensitivity to detect transgressions to GFD was 44% for a-DGP IgA and 100% for a-DGP IgA+G (P = 0.03). In the 106 children on GFD for more than 1 year, sensitivity to detect transgressions to GFD was 60% for a-DGP IgA and 76% for a-DGP IgA+G. Anti-tTG IgA and AGA IgA sensitivity was much lower (24% and 4%, respectively). The 4 tests showed comparable high specificity. CONCLUSIONS: Both a-DGPs showed higher sensitivity than anti-tTG IgA and AGA IgA in monitoring compliance with GFD, but a-DGP IgA+G seemed to perform better. a-DGPs did not outperform anti-tTG IgA for CD screening.},

   abstract = {BACKGROUND AND AIMS: We assessed whether mild enteropathy with negative coeliac serology may be gluten-dependent, and a cause of iron-deficiency anaemia. In cases not responding to gluten-free diet, the role of Helicobacter pylori infection was evaluated. METHODS: 55 consecutive unexplained iron-deficiency anaemia patients were included. In all of them we performed: HLA-DQ2/DQ8 coeliac genetic study, distal duodenum biopsies, and tests to assess H. pylori infection. A gluten-free diet or H. pylori eradication was used as indicated. Final diagnosis was established based on response to specific therapy after a 12-month follow-up period. RESULTS: Histological findings were: (1) group A (positive genetics): 21 Marsh I, 2 Marsh IIIA, 12 normal; (2) group B (negative genetics): 16 Marsh I, 4 normal. Final diagnosis of anaemia in patients with enteropathy were: group A, gluten-sensitive enteropathy, 45%; H. pylori infection, 20%; gluten-sensitive enteropathy plus H. pylori, 10%; other, 10%; unknown, 15%; group B, gluten-sensitive enteropathy, 10%; H. pylori infection, 0% (1 non-eradicated case, 10%); non-steroidal anti-inflammatory drug intake, 20%; other, 20%; unknown, 40% (p=0.033). CONCLUSIONS: Mild enteropathy is frequent in patients with unexplained iron-deficiency anaemia and negative coeliac serology. Most cases are secondary to either gluten-sensitive enteropathy or H. pylori infection, or both; however, there is also a substantial number of patients without a definitive diagnosis.},

Whilst the majority of patients will respond to a gluten free diet with resolution of symptoms and an improvement in histology, a significant minority have persistent problems. Refractory coeliac disease is a relatively uncommon cause of non-response to gluten free diet with potentially serious consequences of severe malabsorption and a high rate of progression to lymphoma. This review provides a practical guide to the investigation of patients who do not respond to a gluten free diet. We will highlight the differences between the more common non-responsive coeliac disease and the rare entity of refractory coeliac disease and discuss current management and treatment options for both non-responsive coeliac disease and refractory coeliac disease.},

   abstract = {PURPOSE OF REVIEW: To critically summarize recent research in celiac disease. RECENT FINDINGS: There are new serological markers with potential use not only in the diagnosis of celiac disease but also as important follow-up tools. As our understanding of celiac disease increases with further isolation of nonhuman leukocyte antigen genes and clarification of the intracellular pathways that underlie its pathogenesis, there are new modalities which will not only allow improved risk stratification of individuals but also facilitate the development of novel therapeutic agents. SUMMARY: Small bowel biopsy remains the gold standard for both diagnosis and monitoring. A gluten-free diet currently remains the only treatment option, with potential other options being discovered such as glutenases for predigestion of gluten.},

   abstract = {Descriptive reports of liver histologic features in celiac disease (CD) are sparse, and the effect of a gluten-free diet (GFD) on the course of liver injury is poorly understood. We reviewed liver biopsy specimens in 30 patients with CD and performed immunostains for IgG, IgG4, IgM, and IgA. Subsequent liver biochemical tests and compliance with the GFD were recorded. Of the patients, 19 had autoimmune-mediated liver disease (AILD; autoimmune hepatitis, 9; primary sclerosing cholangitis, 7; and primary biliary cirrhosis, 3). The remaining 11 patients had cryptogenic hepatitis (5), hepatitis C (2), steatohepatitis (2), sarcoidosis (1), and T-cell lymphoma (1). The liver disease diagnosis preceded the CD diagnosis in all groups except steatohepatitis. Although 82% of patients without AILD had symptomatic CD, only 26% of patients with AILD had such symptoms. The pathology of the specific liver disease was not atypical in histologic features or IgG/IgM ratios. While GFD improved cryptogenic hepatitis, it did not seem to affect AILD. We propose that AILD and cryptogenic hepatitis in patients with CD represent distinct clinical, histologic, and immunohistochemical entities rather than 2 ends of a spectrum of liver injury.},

   abstract = {BACKGROUND: Celiac disease (CD) is a prevalent condition with a broad spectrum of presentations requiring a lifelong gluten-free diet (GFD). Our aims were to examine the presentation and adherence to a GFD as well as the adequacy of follow-up of children diagnosed with CD at a tertiary referral center. METHODS: A retrospective electronic chart review of pediatric patients suspected of CD (n = 581) who were seen at our institute between January 1999 and December 2008 was performed. RESULTS: 387 children were diagnosed with CD (F/M ratio of 1.54, median age: 6.25 years). Presenting symptoms were iron deficiency anemia (n = 82, 34%), short stature (n = 59, 24.5%) and abdominal pain (n = 59, 24.5%). In 63 patients (16.3%) an associated autoimmune disease was recorded. Only 42.7% of the patients (165/387) had regular out-patient gastroenterologist visits; 22% (86/387) were followed by their primary care physician. Over 35% (136/387) were completely lost to follow-up. Negative serology on follow-up was present in 91% of the CD patients(150/165) followed at our center in comparison to 70% (60/86) in those followed up by their primary physician (p = 0.0002). CONCLUSIONS: At least in our referral center, follow-up of children diagnosed with CD is far from satisfactory. Initiatives aimed at improving adherence to regular follow-up are needed as this intervention is associated with a significant increase in patient compliance with a long-term GFD.},

   abstract = {Celiac disease (CD) is one of the most common immune-mediated diseases with a worldwide prevalence of around 1%, although a couple of decades ago the disease was thought to be very rare. CD is characterized by an inadequate inflammatory response to gluten in genetically susceptible individuals. In this inflammatory response both the adaptive and innate immunity are involved. The clinical picture of CD is variable ranging from severe malabsorption syndrome to silent cases. Disease specific antibodies can aid in selecting patients for a small intestinal biopsy, which is thought to be the gold standard investigation to diagnose CD. However, in selected patients, serology can be sufficient to confirm the diagnosis and a biopsy is not needed. Hitherto, the only treatment for CD is adherence to a lifelong strict gluten-free diet. The purpose of this review was to summarize current literature on the epidemiology and pathophysiology of CD and to discuss diagnostic and therapeutic approaches.},

   abstract = {OBJECTIVE: A small intestinal biopsy is considered to be the gold standard for the diagnosis of celiac disease (CD). However, the assessment of small intestinal histology may vary between pathologists. Our aim was, therefore, to determine the interobserver variability in the histological diagnosis of CD. MATERIAL AND METHODS: Biopsy specimens of 297 pediatric patients suspected of having CD were revised by a single experienced pathologist and compared to the original reports. Mucosal changes were scored using the Marsh classification. In patients with a discrepancy in diagnosis, clinical and serological data were used to determine the most probable diagnosis. RESULTS: Although the interobserver variability for the Marsh classification was found to be moderate with a Kappa value of 0.486, the Kappa value for the diagnosis reached an almost perfect agreement (0.850). Nevertheless, in 22 patients a different diagnosis was made by the second observer. Interestingly, in this subgroup relatively more biopsies were classified to be of suboptimal quality. Based on clinical presentation, serology and follow-up, 19 of those patients truly had CD. In 14 of them the diagnosis was originally missed by the first observer while five cases were under-diagnosed by the second pathologist. CONCLUSIONS: CD can be missed histologically due to assessment variation between pathologists. A final diagnosis of CD should be based on histology, serology as well as response to the diet.},

   abstract = {OBJECTIVES: Small intestinal histology is the criterion standard for the diagnosis of celiac disease (CD). However, results of serological tests such as anti-endomysium antibodies and anti-tissue transglutaminase antibodies (tTGA) are becoming increasingly reliable. This raises the question of whether a small intestinal biopsy is always necessary. The aim of the present study was, therefore, to investigate whether a small intestinal biopsy can be avoided in a selected group of patients. PATIENTS AND METHODS: Serology and histological slides obtained from 283 pediatric patients suspected of having CD were examined retrospectively. The response to a gluten-free diet (GFD) in patients with a tTGA level >/= 100 U/mL was investigated. RESULTS: A tTGA level >/= 100 U/mL was found in 128 of the 283 patients. Upon microscopic examination of the small intestinal epithelium, villous atrophy was found in 124 of these patients, confirming the presence of CD. Three patients had crypt hyperplasia or an increased number of intraepithelial lymphocytes. In 1 patient no histological abnormalities were found. This patient did not respond to a GFD. CONCLUSIONS: Pediatric patients with a tTGA level >/= 100 U/mL in whom symptoms improve upon consuming a GFD may not need a small intestinal biopsy to confirm CD.},

   abstract = {AIM: To investigate whether a tissue-transglutaminase antibody (tTGA) level >/= 100 U/mL is sufficient for the diagnosis of celiac disease (CD). METHODS: Children suspected of having CD were prospectively included in our study between March 2009 and September 2011. All patients with immune globulin A deficiency and all patients on a gluten-free diet were excluded from the study. Anti-endomysium antibodies (EMA) were detected by means of immunofluorescence using sections of distal monkey esophagus (EUROIMMUN, Luebeck, Germany). Serum anti-tTGA were measured by means of enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay using human recombinant tissue transglutaminase (ELiA Celikey IgA kit Phadia AB, Uppsala, Sweden). The histological slides were graded by a single experienced pathologist using the Marsh classification as modified by Oberhuber. Marsh II and III lesions were considered to be diagnostic for the disease. The positive predictive values (PPVs), negative predictive values (NPVs), sensitivity and specificity of EMA and tTGA along with their 95% CI (for the cut off values > 10 and >/= 100 U/mL) were calculated using histology as the gold standard for CD. RESULTS: A total of 183 children were included in the study. A total of 70 (38.3%) were male, while 113 (61.7%) were female. The age range was between 1.0 and 17.6 years, and the mean age was 6.2 years. One hundred twenty (65.6%) patients had a small intestinal biopsy diagnostic for the disease; 3 patients had a Marsh II lesion, and 117 patients had a Marsh III lesion. Of the patients without CD, only 4 patients had a Marsh I lesion. Of the 183 patients, 136 patients were positive for EMA, of whom 20 did not have CD, yielding a PPV for EMA of 85% (95% CI: 78%-90%) and a corresponding specificity of 68% (95% CI: 55%-79%). The NPV and specificity for EMA were 91% (95% CI: 79%-97%) and 97% (95% CI: 91%-99%), respectively. Increased levels of tTGA were found in 130 patients, although only 116 patients truly had histological evidence of the disease. The PPV for tTGA was 89% (95% CI: 82%-94%), and the corresponding specificity was 78% (95% CI: 65%-87%). The NPV and sensitivity were 92% (95% CI: 81%-98%) and 97% (95% CI: 91%-99%), respectively. A tTGA level >/= 100 U/mL was found in 87 (47.5%) patients, all of whom were also positive for EMA. In all these 87 patients, epithelial lesions confirming CD were found, giving a PPV of 100% (95%CI: 95%-100%). The corresponding specificity for this cut-off value was also 100% (95% CI: 93%-100%). Within this group, a total of 83 patients had symptoms, at least gastrointestinal and/or growth retardation. Three patients were asymptomatic but were screened because they belonged to a group at risk for CD (diabetes mellitus type 1 or positive family history). The fourth patient who lacked CD-symptoms was detected by coincidence during an endoscopy performed for gastro-intestinal bleeding. CONCLUSION: This study confirms based on prospective data that a small intestinal biopsy is not necessary for the diagnosis of CD in symptomatic patients with tTGA >/= 100 U/mL.},

   abstract = {The performance of Gluten-Tec (EuroProxima, Arnhem, The Netherlands) was tested through an interlaboratory study in accordance with AOAC guidelines. Gluten-Tec is a competitive ELISA that detects an immunostimulatory epitope of a-gliadin in dietary food for celiacs. Fifteen laboratories, representing 14 different countries, announced their interest in taking part in this study. Of the 12 laboratories that sent the results within the established timeframe, two submitted inappropriate standard curves and were excluded from the statistical analysis. Four different food matrixes (rice-based baby food, maize bread, chocolate cake mix, and beer) were selected for preparing the test samples. Two gliadin extraction procedures were used: the conventional 60% ethanol, and a new method based on the reducing reagent dithiothreitol. The 38 samples (19 blind duplicates) tested in this study were prepared by diluting the different extracts in order to cover a wide range of gliadin levels. Both sample extraction and dilution were performed by EuroProxima; the present interlaboratory study was focused only on testing the ELISA part of the Gluten-Tec kit protocol. Repeatability values (within-laboratory variance), expressed as RSD(r) ranged from 6.2 to 25.7%, while reproducibility values (interlaboratory variance), expressed as RSD(R), ranged from 10.6 to 45.9%. Both statistical parameters were in the acceptable range of ELISAs under these conditions, and the method will be presented to the Codex Alimentarius as a preferred method for gluten analysis.},

Dual-energy x-ray absorptiometry (DXA) confirmed osteoporosis at the L3/L4 vertebral bodies. Parathyroid hormone (PTH), calcium, and vitamin D levels were normal. He had no gastrointestinal complaints, but serologic studies were positive to include an elevated gliadin IgA Ab, gliadin IgG Ab, and an elevated tissue transglutaminase IgA Ab. He was treated with a gluten-free diet, calcium, and vitamin D supplementation as well as teriparatide. Follow up bone density showed improvement and has no further fractures to date. Primary care physicians, gastroenterologists, and endocrinologists must have a high index of clinical suspicion for celiac disease in any patient who presents with low bone density regardless of the serum 25-OH vitamin D levels or presence of gastrointestinal complaints.},

   abstract = {BACKGROUND: Celiac disease is defined as a 'chronic small intestinal immune-mediated enteropathy precipitated by exposure to dietary gluten in genetically predisposed individuals'. Sweden has experienced an "epidemic" of celiac disease in children below two years of age. Celiac disease etiology is considered multifactorial; however, little is known regarding potential risk- or protecting factors. We present data on the possible association between early infectious episodes and celiac disease, including their possible contribution to the Swedish celiac disease epidemic. METHODS: A population-based incident case-referent study (475 cases, 950 referents) with exposure information obtained via a questionnaire (including family characteristics, infant feeding, and the child's general health) was performed. Celiac disease cases were diagnosed before two years of age, fulfilling the diagnostic criteria of the European Society for Pediatric Gastroenterology, Hepatology and Nutrition. Referents were randomly selected from the national population register after fulfilling matching criteria. The final analyses included 954 children, 373 (79%) cases and 581 (61%) referents, with complete information on main variables of interest in a matched set of one case with one or two referents. RESULTS: Having three or more parental-reported infectious episodes, regardless of type of infection, during the first six months of life was associated with a significantly increased risk for later celiac disease, and this remained after adjusting for infant feeding and socioeconomic status (odds ratio [OR] 1.5; 95% confidence interval [CI], 1.1-2.0; P=0.014). The celiac disease risk increased synergistically if, in addition to having several infectious episodes, infants were introduced to dietary gluten in large amounts, compared to small or medium amounts, after breastfeeding was discontinued (OR 5.6; 95% CI, 3.1-10; P<0.001). CONCLUSION: This study suggests that having repeated infectious episodes early in life increases the risk for later celiac disease. In addition, we found a synergistic effect between early infections and daily amount of gluten intake, more pronounced among infants for whom breastfeeding had been discontinued prior to gluten introduction. Regarding contribution to the Swedish celiac disease epidemic, which partly was attributed to concurrent changes in infant feeding, early infections probably made a minor contribution via the synergistic effect with gluten amount.},

   abstract = {OBJECTIVES: The efficacy of celiac disease (CD)-related antibodies in monitoring clinical outcome of patients remains unclear. Our aims were to determine dynamics of antibodies after diagnosis and to assess their performances in monitoring patients' long-term compliance with the gluten-free diet (GFD). METHODS: We prospectively estimated the performance of seven celiac disease-related antibody tests at diagnosis and at 1 year and more than 4 years after treatment initiation in 53 adults. The ability of antibodies to identify patients partially compliant to treatment was explored by the receiver operating characteristic curve analysis. The derived cut-off values ('compliance' cutoffs) were compared with cut-off values used for diagnosis ('diagnostic' cutoffs). The degree of compliance with the GFD was assessed using a standardized, multidisciplinary approach. RESULTS: Concentrations of all antibodies decreased significantly at 1 year after diagnosis. The decline continued for more than 4 years in strictly compliant patients (P<0.05-0.001). The gap between 'compliance' and 'diagnostic' cut-offs values was wider at 1 year than at more than 4 years. The predictability of partial compliance determined by the area under receiver operating characteristic curves was relevant for most tests examined at 1 year (areas ranging: 0.64-0.72) and more than 4 years (0.58-0.78). Immunoglobulin A antibodies to deamidated gliadin peptides and tissue transglutaminase had the best performance for monitoring long-term compliance. CONCLUSION: Decreased concentrations of antibodies were significantly associated with the degree of compliance with the GFD. Immunoglobulin A antibodies to deamidated gliadin peptides and tissue transglutaminase had the best and more consistent performances. The serial measurement of antibody levels seems to be more reliable in monitoring compliance than the positive/negative expression of results.},

   abstract = {BACKGROUND & AIMS: Celiac disease (CD) patients often complain of symptoms consistent with gastroesophageal reflux disease (GERD). We aimed to assess the prevalence of GERD symptoms at diagnosis and to determine the impact of the gluten-free diet (GFD). METHODS: We evaluated 133 adult CD patients at diagnosis and 70 healthy controls. Fifty-three patients completed questionnaires every 3 months during the first year and more than 4 years after diagnosis. GERD symptoms were evaluated using a subdimension of the Gastrointestinal Symptoms Rating Scale for heartburn and regurgitation domains. RESULTS: At diagnosis, celiac patients had a significantly higher reflux symptom mean score than healthy controls (P < .001). At baseline, 30.1% of CD patients had moderate to severe GERD (score >3) compared with 5.7% of controls (P < .01). Moderate to severe symptoms were significantly associated with the classical clinical presentation of CD (35.0%) compared with atypical/silent cases (15.2%; P < .03). A rapid improvement was evidenced at 3 months after initial treatment with a GFD (P < .0001) with reflux scores comparable to healthy controls from this time point onward. CONCLUSIONS: GERD symptoms are common in classically symptomatic untreated CD patients. The GFD is associated with a rapid and persistent improvement in reflux symptoms that resembles the healthy population.},

   abstract = {Celiac disease (CD) is an enteropathy-induced immune response that occurs on exposure to toxic gluten in the diet and is reversible once gluten is withdrawn. A gluten-free diet is the preferred treatment for CD and leads to reversal of villous atrophy. Counseling, nutritional support, and follow-up are vital aspects in CD management. The pickup rate of CD has improved with the availability of serologic tests, and this has led to a reduction in morbidity in treated CD cases. Managing CD can potentially prevent or cure some of the associated conditions, such as neurologic complications, nutritional deficiencies, and osteoporosis.},

   abstract = {AIM: To determine the evidence for the effect of gluten ingestion on gastrointestinal symptoms, intestinal permeability and other indices of small intestinal injury in non-coeliac, gluten intolerant individuals. METHODS: A literature review was performed searching for interventional studies that addressed the issue. RESULTS: One unblinded study that identified symptomatic response to gluten did not effectively exclude patients with coeliac disease, since many had intraepithelial lymphocytosis. A double-blinded, randomised, placebo-controlled rechallenge trial was recently reported in patients in whom coeliac disease had been excluded by either normal duodenal histology on a gluten containing diet, or absence of the HLA DQ2 or DQ8 haplotype (56%). Participants were randomly assigned to receive either 16 g/day carbohydrate-free gluten or placebo for six weeks. Participants were enrolled if they had gastrointestinal symptoms that had improved on a GFD and had been on a gluten free diet for at least 6 weeks prior to enrollment. 19 received gluten and 15 received placebo. Change between baseline and final weeks were greater for patients receiving gluten in overall symptom severity compared with those receiving placebo (p=0.047). and were worse with gluten within one week for pain (p=0.016), bloating (p=0.031), satisfaction with stool consistency (p=0.024), and tiredness (p=0.001). Mechanisms for symptom induction were not identified. CONCLUSIONS: Non-coeliac gluten intolerance does exist. Future studies need to identify issues of the dose of gluten needed and mechanisms of action.},

The objective of this study was to observe whether a gluten-free diet could alleviate the behavioral symptoms in patients with celiac disease and ADHD. METHOD: Sixty-seven subjects aged 7 to 42 years (mean = 11.4 years) with ADHD were enrolled in the study in South Tyrol, Italy, from 2004 to 2008. Hypescheme, an operational criteria checklist that incorporates DSM-IV and ICD-10 criteria, was used to assess ADHD-like symptomatology. Additionally, blood serum levels of all subjects were assessed for possible celiac disease by examining antigliadine and antiendomysium antibodies. A gluten-free diet was initiated for at least 6 months in celiac disease-positive patients with ADHD. RESULTS: Of the 67 patients with ADHD, 10 were positive for celiac disease. After initiation of the gluten-free diet, patients or their parents reported a significant improvement in their behavior and functioning compared to the period before celiac diagnosis and treatment, which was evident in the overall mean score on the Hypescheme questionnaire (t = 4.22, P = .023). CONCLUSIONS: Celiac disease is markedly overrepresented among patients presenting with ADHD. A gluten-free diet significantly improved ADHD symptoms in patients with celiac disease in this study. The results further suggest that celiac disease should be included in the ADHD symptom checklist.},

The objective of this work is the study of bacterial differences in the upper small intestine in both adults (healthy, untreated celiac disease [CD], and CD treated with a gluten-free diet) and children (healthy and untreated CD). METHODS: Intestinal bacterial communities were identified by 16S rRNA gene sequencing of DNA extracted from duodenal biopsies. RESULTS: Analysis of the sequences from adults and children showed that this niche was colonized by bacteria affiliated mainly with three phyla: Firmicutes, Proteobacteria, and Bacteroidetes. In total, 89 different genera were identified in adults and 46 in children. Bacterial richness was significantly lower in the children than in the adults. A global principal component analysis of the bacterial communities of both healthy and untreated CD patient groups (including both children and adults) revealed a strong effect of age in principal component 1--clustering all adults and children separately--and a possible effect of the disease in adults with untreated patients clustering separately. CONCLUSIONS: There are bacterial differences in the upper small intestine between untreated children CD patients and untreated CD adults due to age. There are bacterial differences in the upper small bacteria microbiota between treated and untreated CD adults due to treatment with a gluten-free diet.},

   abstract = {UNLABELLED: Differences in the intestinal microbiota between children and adults with celiac disease (CD) have been reported; however, differences between healthy adults and adults with CD have not been clearly demonstrated. The aim of this study was to evaluate the differences in the intestinal microbiota between adults with CD and healthy individuals. Microbial communities in faecal samples were evaluated by PCR-denaturing gradient gel electrophoresis (DGGE) and gas-liquid chromatography of short chain fatty acids (SCFAs). The study group included 10 untreated CD patients, 11 treated CD patients and 11 healthy adults (in normal gluten diet and in GFD). UPGMA clustered the dominant microbial communities of healthy individuals together and separated them from the dominant microbial communities of the untreated CD patients. Most of the dominant microbial communities of the treated CD patients clustered together with those of healthy adults. The treated CD patients showed a reduction in the diversity of Lactobacillus and Bifidobacterium species. The presence of Bifidobacterium bifidum was significantly higher in untreated CD patients than healthy adults. There was a significant difference between untreated CD patients and healthy adults, as well as between treated CD patients and healthy adults, regarding acetic acid, propionic acid, butyric acid, and total SCFAs. IN CONCLUSION: healthy adults have a different faecal microbiota from that of untreated CD patients. A portion of the treated CD patients displayed a restored "normal" microbiota. The treated CD patients significantly reduce the Lactobacillus and Bifidobacterium diversity. Healthy adults have a different faecal SCFAs content from that of CD patients.},

   abstract = {BACKGROUND: A gluten-free diet is the only available treatment for celiac disease. Our aim was to investigate the effect of a gluten-free diet on celiac disease related symptoms, health care consumption, and the risk of developing associated immune-mediated diseases. METHODS: A questionnaire was sent to 1,560 randomly selected members of the Swedish Society for Coeliacs, divided into equal-sized age- and sex strata; 1,031 (66%) responded. Self-reported symptoms, health care consumption (measured by health care visits and hospitalization days), and missed working days were reported both for the year prior to diagnosis (normal diet) and the year prior to receiving the questionnaire while undergoing treatment with a gluten-free diet. Associated immune-mediated diseases (diabetes mellitus type 1, rheumatic disease, thyroid disease, vitiligo, alopecia areata and inflammatory bowel disease) were self-reported including the year of diagnosis. RESULTS: All investigated symptoms except joint pain improved after diagnosis and initiated gluten-free diet. Both health care consumption and missed working days decreased. Associated immune-mediated diseases were diagnosed equally often before and after celiac disease diagnosis. CONCLUSIONS: Initiated treatment with a gluten-free diet improves the situation for celiac disease patients in terms of reduced symptoms and health care consumption. An earlier celiac disease diagnosis is therefore of great importance.},

   abstract = {BACKGROUND AND OBJECTIVE: Antitransglutaminase (anti-TG2) antibodies are synthesised in the intestine and their presence seems predictive of future coeliac disease (CD). This study investigates whether mucosal antibodies represent an early stage of gluten intolerance even in the absence of intestinal damage and serum anti-TG2 antibodies. METHODS: This study investigated 22 relatives of patients with CD genetically predisposed to gluten intolerance but negative for both serum anti-TG2 antibodies and intestinal abnormalities. Fifteen subjects were symptomatic and seven were asymptomatic. The presence of immunoglobulin A anti-TG2 antibodies in the intestine was studied by creating phage-antibody libraries against TG-2. The presence of intestinal anti-TG2 antibodies was compared with the serum concentration of the intestinal fatty acid-binding protein (I-FABP), a marker for early intestinal mucosal damage. The effects of a 12-month gluten-free diet on anti-TG2 antibody production and the subjects' clinical condition was monitored. Twelve subjects entered the study as controls. RESULTS: The intestinal mucosa appeared normal in 18/22; 4 had a slight increase in intraepithelial lymphocytes. Mucosal anti-TG2 antibodies were isolated in 15/22 subjects (68%); in particular symptomatic subjects were positive in 13/15 cases and asymptomatic subjects in 2/7 cases (p=0.01). No mucosal antibodies were selected from the controls' biopsies. There was significant correlation between the presence of intestinal anti-TG2 antibodies and positive concentrations of I-FABP (p=0.0008). After a gluten-free diet, 19/22 subjects underwent a second intestinal biopsy, which showed that anti-TG2 antibodies had disappeared in 12/15 (p=0.002), while I-FABP decreased significantly (p<0.0001). The diet resolved both extraintestinal and intestinal symptoms. CONCLUSIONS: A new form of genetic-dependent gluten intolerance has been described in which none of the usual diagnostic markers is present. Symptoms and intestinal anti-TG2 antibodies respond to a gluten free-diet. The detection of intestinal anti-TG2 antibodies by the phage-antibody libraries has an important diagnostic and therapeutic impact for the subjects with gluten-dependent intestinal or extraintestinal symptoms.

   abstract = {Celiac disease (CD) is a chronic intestinal disorder of public health concern caused by gluten ingestion in sensitive individuals. Gluten is a protein found not only in gluten-containing food but also as normal component of drugs and dietary supplements. Detection of gluten in dietary supplements is a very important task required for establishing their gluten status, which is highly important for the safety of products consumed by CD and gluten-sensitive patients. In this paper, we investigated the presence of gluten in twenty one common dietary supplements from the national market using the immunochromatographic assay. This visual assay proved to be an efficient rapid tool for gluten screening as an alternative to the ELISA techniques. The results have shown the presence of gluten in 23.8% of the investigated samples (vitamins, minerals, plant extracts, probiotics supplements, lactoferrin, propolis supplements). The results provide information which may contribute to the completion of the existing lists of gluten-free pharmaceuticals. It is known that for CD patients obtaining accurate information about the gluten content of a particular item is a difficult and time-consuming process.},

   abstract = {OBJECTIVE: The purpose of this case report is to describe the use of acupuncture and a gluten-free diet (GFD) for urticaria and severe eczema in a patient with undiagnosed dermatitis herpetiformis and atypical or extraintestinal celiac disease. CLINICAL FEATURES: A 48-year-old woman presented with intense urticaria, eczema, worsening heartburn, chronic constipation, headaches, and an intense feeling of heat for 4 months. Results of punch biopsies of the skin lesions and laboratory tests were inconclusive. After the acupuncture sessions reported here ended, human leukocyte antigen blood typing revealed celiac disease and dermatitis herpetiformis-associated human leukocyte antigen DQ-8. Results of an endoscopy and colonoscopy were negative. INTERVENTION AND OUTCOME: The patient received 3 acupuncture treatments a week for 12 weeks. The patient's symptoms began in March 2008. She began using topical and oral steroids and felt that her symptoms were not responding. Acupuncture began in July 2008. At the end of the first 12 treatments, during which she was using topical and oral steroids, the urticaria and constipation resolved completely; and she had temporary relief from the heartburn. It is thought that the urticaria and constipation resolved because of the acupuncture as that was the only change. At the end of the second 12 treatments, during which time she had started Optifast, a GFD, the heartburn, headache, and eczema resolved. At the end of the third 12 treatments, all her symptoms remained resolved. Steroid treatment was discontinued after the first 12 treatments. CONCLUSION: Acupuncture and diet changes appeared to provide relief from the urticaria and eczema of dermatitis herpetiformis beyond that obtained by traditional treatment of a GFD alone.},

We investigated the importance of coeliac disease characteristics and diet compliance for risk of lymphoma. METHODS: In a nested case-control design, we identified 59 patients with lymphoma and 137 matched controls from a population-based cohort of 11,650 inpatients with coeliac disease. We assessed coeliac disease characteristics at diagnosis and dietary compliance collected prospectively from medical records during follow-up. RESULTS: Poor compliance was not significantly associated with risk of lymphoma overall (odds ratio 1.83, 95% confidence interval 0.78-4.31) nor of lymphoma subtypes. Risk estimates differed by subtype; risk of T-cell lymphoma (odds ratio 1.01, confidence interval 0.32-3.15) or intestinal lymphoma (odds ratio 0.66, confidence interval 0.17-2.56) was unelevated, whereas there was an indication of a risk increase of B-cell lymphoma (odds ratio 4.74, confidence interval 0.89-25.3) or extraintestinal lymphoma (odds ratio 3.00, confidence interval 0.73-12.3) following poor compliance. History of weight loss (odds ratio 2.89, confidence interval 1.00-8.29) at coeliac disease diagnosis was associated with an increased risk of lymphoma when excluding tumours occurring with short latency (<3 years). CONCLUSIONS: Compliance to a gluten-free diet did not significantly alter lymphoma risk, but a moderate effect cannot be excluded. Weight loss, a potential marker of coeliac disease severity, may be associated with lymphoma risk.},

OBJECTIVE: In order to determine the prevalence of celiac disease in a group of first degree relatives of children with proven gluten intolerance, we conducted a prospective study that consisted in the screening of celiac disease, using a capillary immunoassay rapid test that allows a qualitative detection of IgA antibody to human recombinant tissue transglutaminase (IgA-TTG). METHODS: When the screening test was positive subjects were advised to proceed with further investigation. The screening test was performed in 268 first degree relatives (143 mothers, 89 fathers, 36 siblings) corresponding to 163 children with celiac disease. RESULTS: Screening test was positive in 12 relatives (4.5%), of which 1 refused to continue the investigation. In the remaining 11 relatives celiac disease was diagnosed in 7 cases (2.6%, 5 mothers, 2 fathers) who had a median age of 39 years (27-56 years), mild gastrointestinal symptoms, high titre of IgA-TTG and histology abnormalities confirming the diagnosis. All these patients are currently on a gluten-free diet. CONCLUSION: The prevalence of celiac disease among first degree relatives (2.6%) was 5 times higher than that in the general population. Although the recommendations for screening asymptomatic high risk groups, such as first degree relatives, are not unanimous the early diagnosis is crucial in preventing complications, including nutritional deficiency and cancer.},

The literature was searched for studies on vitamin D status in children with inflammatory bowel disease (IBD), celiac disease, and liver disease. Vitamin D supplementation in healthy children was also reviewed. CONCLUSIONS: Those with gastrointestinal diseases are more likely to have vitamin D deficiency as a result of malabsorption. Current recommendations for supplementation may be too low to achieve optimal levels. PRACTICE IMPLICATIONS: It is important to monitor vitamin D levels in pediatric populations with gastrointestinal diseases and appropriately treat levels that are insufficient.},

Several support layer-biorecognition element combinations were tested in order to maximize the electrochemical response, and the assay was optimized in terms of incubation times and resistance to nonspecific interactions. The developed supramolecular biosensor was then applied to the amperometric detection of antigliadin IgA and IgG autoantibodies in real samples of celiac disease patients under follow-up treatment; the results were compared with a commercial enzyme linked immunosorbent assay (ELISA) test, and an excellent correlation was observed between both methods.},

   abstract = {INTRODUCTION: Coeliac disease (CD) is a common diagnosis among children and adults in Iraq; however, removal of gluten from the diet is essential for patients with CD. The aim of this study, the first such study in Iraq, was to assess the serological and histological recovery profiles of coeliac patients, in both children and adults groups after commencing a gluten-free diet (GFD) for at least 1 year +/- 1 month. MATERIAL AND METHODS: The study group comprised 78 proved coeliac patients (46 children and 32 adults, median age: 15 years, range: 1-66 years) who all agreed to undergo endoscopy in addition to serological assessment before and after treatment. The duodenal biopsies were interpreted histologically according to modified Marsh criteria and the sera were tested for anti-gliadin antibody (AGA), endomysium antibody (EMA) and anti-tissue transglutaminase antibody (tTG). RESULTS: Complete histological remission was seen in 29 (63.1%) of 46 treated children CD patients, while only 5 (10.9%) showed Marsh IIIa changes compared with 11 (24%) before GFD. Similarly none of the 32 adults after GFD showed Marsh IIIb and Marsh IIIc compared with 46.9% and 28.1% before treatment respectively (p = 001). Meanwhile, there was strongly significant reduction in AGA, EMA, and tTG antibodies levels (p = 0.00001) following GFD. CONCLUSIONS: Repeating the duodenal biopsy 1 year +/-1 month after diagnosis and starting a GFD supports the routine measurement of using histological findings as a gold standard test to confirm recovery of Iraqi CD patients along with using known coeliac serology antibodies.},

   abstract = {The prolamin peptides in wheat gluten and in the homologous storage proteins of barley and rye cause painful chronic erasure of microvilli of the small intestine epithelium in celiac patients. If untreated, it can lead to chronic diarrhea, abdominal distension, osteoporosis, weight-loss due to malabsorption of nutrients, and anemia. In addition to congenital cases, life-long exposure to gluten proteins in bread and pasta can also induce development of celiac sprue in adults. To date, the only effective treatment is life-long strict abstinence from the staple food grains. Complete exclusion of dietary gluten is, however, difficult due to use of wheat in many foods, incomplete labeling and social constraints. Thus, finding alternative therapies for this most common foodborne disease remained an active area of research, which has led to many suggestions in last few years. The pros and cons associated with these therapies were reviewed in the present communication. As different celiac patients are immunogenic to different members of the undigestible proline/glutamine rich peptides of ~149 gliadins and low molecular weight glutenin subunits as well as the six high molecular weight glutenin subunits, an exhaustive digestion of the immunogenic peptides in the stomach, duodenum, jejunum, and ileum of celiacs is required. In view of the above, we evaluated the capacity of cereal grains to synthesize and store the enzymes prolyl endopeptidase from Flavobacterium meningosepticum and the barley cysteine endoprotease B2, which in combination are capable of detoxifying immunogenic gluten peptides in a novel treatment of celiac disease.},

   abstract = {UNLABELLED: Celiac disease (CD) is an autoimmune systemic enteropathy triggered by gluten intake in patients with genetic susceptibility, characterized by clinic polymorphism: classic forms, mainly with digestive features, and atypical forms, liver involvement being a part of them. In present, any unknown cytolysis requires screening serologic determinations for CD. AIMS: to assess the presence of liver manifestations in children diagnosed with CD, the outcome of liver function with gluten-free diet (GFD) and also to emphasize the importance of the immunological screening for CD in patients with unknown etiology liver dysfunctions. MATERIAL AND METHODS: The trial was formed by 120 patients diagnosed with CD between January 2007 - December 2010 in 2nd and 3rd Pediatric Clinics of "Sf. Maria" Hospital Iasi; liver function was assessed; viral hepatitis and autoimmune hepatitis markers were determined; all patients were given GFD, hepatoprotective agents and antivirals specific to each form of hepatitis; the transaminases level variation was followed in time. RESULTS: 12 of the CD diagnosed patients (10, 14%) had altered liver function at the onset of disease; the only abnormality was the increased transaminases level in 57, 14% of cases; HBsAg was found positive in 33, 33% (4 cases); liver biopsy in one patient evidenced steatosis. The study has shown that 4% of the patients with cryptogenetic hepatitis have a silent form of CD, the serologic screening for AGA, AEA, ATGA being essential for diagnosis. CONCLUSIONS: we have to rule out CD in patients with liver disease of unknown etiology, before we consider it as "cryptogenetic"; occurrence of cytolysis in the absence of positive viral markers requires the assessment of screening tests for CD.},

   abstract = {UNLABELLED: Celiac disease is one of the most common forms of food intolerance in children, being an autoimmune enteropathy occurring in genetically susceptible individuals. The only treatment of celiac disease consists in a lifelong strict gluten-free diet. After gluten free diet patients with normal weight or growth failure risk become obese on the one hand because of recovery intestinal absorption and, on the other hand, nutritionally unbalanced diet, high in fat and protein. AIM: The aim of this study was to assess the nutritional status and the presence and prevalence of various changes dyslipidemia in gluten free diet. MATERIAL AND METHODS: The trial was formed by 92 patients (mean age at diagnosis 88,5 months) diagnosed with CD between January 2008 - December 2010 in 2nd and 3rd Pediatric Clinics of "Sf. Maria" Hospital Iasi. Patients were divided into two groups: group I included 36 patients younger than 2 years and group II included 52 patients aged over 2 years at time of diagnosis of celiac disease. All patients received gluten free diet. Were evaluated periodically anthropometric indices (weight, height, body mass index and Z scores in children over 2 years and weight and nutritional index in children under 2 years) and lipid profile (total lipids, total cholesterol, HDL cholesterol, triglycerides). Assessing food intake was achieved by interviewing parents and children on dietary habits and daily food ration. RESULTS: Assessment of nutritional status: group I:--after 24 months of gluten free diet 5 cases presented overweight; group II: after 24 months of gluten free diet obesity (BMI > 30) was found in 16.07% of cases (9 patients) and overweight (BMI > 25) was found in 28.57% of cases (16 patients). Food intake: in all cases was observed increased calorie intake by an excess of lipids and carbohydrates in the diet. Investigation of lipid metabolism: in group II high values of cholesterol were found in 12 cases (21,42 of cases). In conclusions, in celiac disease gluten free diet should be balanced caloric, fat and protein to ensure an optimal nutritional status and prevent long-term complications.},

   abstract = {BACKGROUND: Active serological screening has proved an effective means of increasing the diagnostic rate in celiac disease. The effects of a long-term gluten-free diet on possible gastrointestinal symptoms and psychological well-being in screen-detected patients have nevertheless remained obscure. METHODS: Abdominal symptoms and quality of life were measured in a large cohort of treated screen-detected celiac adults. Comparisons were made with corresponding symptom-detected patients and with non-celiac controls. Dietary adherence was assessed both by structured interview and by serological testing. RESULTS: In both screen- and symptom-detected celiac groups, 88% of the patients were adherent. On a diet, both screen- and symptom-detected patients reported significantly more gastrointestinal symptoms than non-celiac controls. Those screen-detected patients who reported having no symptoms at the time of diagnosis, also remained asymptomatic during the diet. Despite persistent symptoms, psychological well-being in screen-detected patients was comparable with that in non-celiac controls, whereas the symptom-detected patients showed lower quality of life. CONCLUSION: Long-term treated screen-detected celiac patients, especially women, suffer from gastrointestinal symptoms on a gluten free diet similarly to symptom-detected patients. However, despite a similar frequency of persistent symptoms, the quality of life was unimpaired in the screen found, but remained low in the symptom-detected group.},

   abstract = {Oral tolerance is the state of local and systemic immune unresponsiveness that is induced by oral administration of innocuous antigen such as food proteins. An analogous but more local process also regulates responses to commensal bacteria in the large intestine and, together, mucosally induced tolerance appears to prevent intestinal disorders such as food allergy, celiac disease, and inflammatory bowel diseases. Here we discuss the anatomical basis of antigen uptake and recognition in oral tolerance and highlight possible mechanisms underlying the immunosuppression. We propose a model of stepwise induction of oral tolerance in which specialized populations of mucosal dendritic cells and the unique microenvironment of draining mesenteric lymph nodes combine to generate regulatory T cells that undergo subsequent expansion in the small intestinal lamina propria. The local and systemic effects of these regulatory T cells prevent potentially dangerous hypersensitivity reactions to harmless antigens derived from the intestine and hence are crucial players in immune homeostasis.},

   abstract = {OBJECTIVES: Anti tissue-transglutaminase antibody is the mainstay of celiac disease serologic testing. Whilst it has high sensitivity in patients on an unrestricted diet, sensitivity is poor for evaluation of gluten free diet adherence. AIM: To assess the utility of a novel assay measuring Immunoglobulin-A antibodies to catalytically active open conformation tissue-transglutaminase in assessment of ongoing gluten exposure in celiac disease patients on an alleged gluten free diet. METHODS: Through prospective assessment, 147 patients with celiac disease were divided into good and poor adherence. Open and closed (conventional) tissue-transglutaminase titres were measured using standard enzyme linked immunosorbent assay. 50 patients with inflammatory bowel disease served as disease controls. RESULTS: Overall 128 patients had been on gluten free diet for more than six months and 19 were found to be poorly adherent on dietary review. Within this group 13 (68.4%) and 10 (52.6%) patients respectively were positive for the open conformation and conventional assay (p=0.51). Two and one control patients tested positive for closed and open assays respectively. CONCLUSIONS: Compared to native assays open conformation tissue-transglutaminase may have higher sensitivity in the poor gluten free diet adherence group and higher specificity in the control population. Larger population studies are warranted to assess whether the open conformation tissue-transglutaminase assay may be superior to the conventional assay.},

AIM: To identify conditions causing noncoeliac enteropathy (NCE) with villous atrophy and methods to differentiate between CD and NCE in clinical practice. METHODS: Through record review we identified patients with DVA due to conditions other than CD. Patient demographics, clinical features and relevant investigations were compared with CD patients. Rates of CD misdiagnosis, and response to treatments were recorded. RESULTS: Thirty cases of NCE were identified with ten different aetiologies. Unspecified immune-mediated enteropathy was the most common aetiology; affecting 10 patients. Gastrointestinal symptoms were more common in NCE than those in CD patients (P < 0.01). Twenty of the 24 NCE patients tested were HLA-DQ2/DQ8 negative. Twenty-six NCE patients were negative for IgA tissue transglutaminase (tTG) (P = 0.0001). Intraepithelial lymphocytosis was absent in 10 (33.3%) patients. Twenty-one NCE patients initially misdiagnosed with CD and one with gluten intolerance were prescribed a gluten free diet (GFD). Fifteen of 22 had repeat biopsy and none showed histological improvement. CONCLUSIONS: Although coeliac disease is the most common cause of DVA, noncoeliac enteropathy is not rare and may easily be mistaken for coeliac disease. Noncoeliac enteropathy is suggested by a normal initial tTG (87%), lack of intraepithelial lymphocytosis on biopsy, and lack of histological response to a gluten free diet. Subjective response to gluten free diet has poor predictive value for coeliac disease. Noncoeliac enteropathy can often be confirmed by negative HLA-DQ2/DQ8 testing and targeted investigations can ascertain a definitive aetiology in most cases.},

   abstract = {Celiac disease (CD) is defined as a permanent intolerance to ingested wheat gliadins and other cereal prolamins, occurring in genetically susceptible people. Persistent elevation of serum aminotransferase activity is expression of liver damage related to CD, which occurs in two distinctive forms. The most frequent is a mild asymptomatic liver injury, with a moderate increase of serum aminotransferase activities and a mild inflammatory portal and lobular infiltrate on liver biopsy (celiac hepatitis), reversible on a gluten-free diet (GFD). More rarely, severe and progressive inflammatory liver damage, induced by an autoimmune process and identified as autoimmune hepatitis (AIH), can develop and it is generally unaffected by gluten withdrawal. Surveys that included only pediatric patients report a wide range of prevalence of CD in AIH of 11.5-46% (mean 21.5%). CD and AIH share selected combinations of genes coding for class II human leukocyte antigens, which could explain their coexistence. Increased intestinal permeability and circulation of anti-tissue transglutaminase (tTG) have also been considered as further potential causes of liver damage in CD patients. tTG in the liver and in other extraintestinal tissues could modify other external- or self-antigens and generate different neo-antigens, which are responsible for liver injury in patients with CD. Patients with AIH represent a population at high risk for developing CD; screening for CD should be integrated into the diagnostic routine of all patients with AIH, with or without gastrointestinal manifestations, before starting immunosuppressive treatments. The only currently available treatment for CD is the GFD and the supportive nutritional care for iron, calcium, and vitamin deficiencies. Due to the difficulties of a GFD, in the past decade researchers have become increasingly interested in therapeutic alternatives to continuous or intermittent use of a GFD in patients with CD. Interventions addressed to correct the defect in the intestinal barrier are currently at the most advanced stage of clinical trials. The impact of a GFD on the outcome of AIH is not clear but it seems to be ineffective in the treatment of AIH. The early detection and treatment of CD, however, may prevent progression to end-stage liver failure.},

   abstract = {Coeliac disease (CD) is a malabsorptive enteropathy resulting from intolerance to gluten. Environmental factors and the microbiota are suggested to have critical roles in the onset of CD. The CD71 IgA receptor on epithelial cells is responsible for abnormal retrotranscytosis of IgA-gluten peptide complexes from the intestinal lumen into the lamina propria, inducing intestinal inflammation. However, understanding the role of gluten in the CD physiopathology has been hindered by the absence of relevant animal models. Here, we generated a mouse model for CD to study the factors controlling its pathogenesis as well as to investigate the influence of oral delivery of probiotics on disease development. Gluten sensitivity was established by feeding three generations of BALB/c mice a gluten-free diet (G-) followed by gluten challenge (G+) for 30 days. The G+ mice developed villous atrophy, crypt hyperplasia and infiltration of T cells and macrophages in the small intestine. Inflammation was associated with an overexpression of CD71 on the apical side of enterocytes and an increase of plasma cells producing IgA, which colocalised with the CD71. Moreover, IgA colocalised with the transglutaminase 2 (TG2), the production of which was increased in the lamina propria of G+ mice. These mice displayed increased production of cyclooxygenase-2 (COX-2), pro-inflammatory cytokines and IL-15, as well as anti-gliadin and anti-TG2 autoantibodies. The commensal flora-isolated presumptive probiotic Saccharomyces boulardii KK1 strain hydrolysed the 28-kDa alpha-gliadin fraction, and its oral delivery in G+ mice improved enteropathy development in association with decrease of epithelial cell CD71 expression and local cytokine production. In conclusion, the G+ BALB/c mouse represents a new mouse model for human CD based on histopathological features and expression of common biomarkers. The selected probiotic treatment reversing disease development will allow the study of the role of probiotics as a new therapeutic approach of CD.},

   abstract = {The global prevalence of celiac disease is of one person per 250 inhabitants. The disease is induced by gluten, a peptide contained in wheat, rye and barley that during small intestinal digestion generates smaller peptides. Some of these are resistant to hydrolysis and cross through the epithelium into the mucosa, inducing a cascade of immune reactions leading to the appearance of the disease in susceptible individuals. Gluten appeared as a consequence of agricultural practices initiated 10000 years ago in the Fertile Crescent of southwest Asia. Celiac disease epidemiology is complicated since consumption of gluten differs depending on the origin of populations. Treatment of celiac disease consists of withdrawing gluten from the diet, a task that becomes difficult in the long term. The concept of gluten-free food has changed along time. This article updates the concept of celiac disease, the history of gluten consumption in the world, the characteristics of a gluten free diet and the difficulties to adhere to it.},

Some patients with GSCD have blood changes, anemia in particular, which precede clinical symptoms of celiac disease. Anemia can arise as a result of disorders in iron, folic acid and/or vitamin B12 absorption. Celiac disease can be associated with thrombocytosis, thrombocytopenia, leucopenia, vein thrombosis, hyposplenism, immunoglobulin A deficiency. Patients with celiac disease have a high risk of lymphoma, especially of T-cell lymphoma associated with enteropathy, B-cell non-Hodgkin's lymphoma. Aglutenic diet, recovery of structure and function of the small intestine eliminate or attenuate hematological disorders associated with GSCD.},

   abstract = {BACKGROUND AND AIM: Celiac patients report fatigue and reduced social activities, which may decrease physical activity. This study investigated the physical activity, fatigue and bone mineral density in celiac women at diagnosis and during diet. MATERIALS AND METHODS: The first group (n=48) had the bone mineral density measured at diagnosis and after 2 years of a gluten-free diet; in the second group (n=47) bone mineral density was measured at diagnosis and after 5 years of a gluten-free diet. Both groups completed a physical activity questionnaire and visual analogue scale for the perception of fatigue at diagnosis and follow-up. Data about smoking habits, alcohol use, presence of gastrointestinal symptoms, drug therapy and body mass index were also collected. RESULTS: At diagnosis, the two groups were similar for all considered variables. At follow-up, the mean body mass index and physical activity questionnaire's score were similar to baseline. The bone density increased in both groups, whilst the physical activity questionnaire and visual analogue scale remained unchanged. CONCLUSION: The improvement in bone density following a gluten-free diet was significant after 2 years; physical activity is frequently low and plays a minor role in determining the changes in bone mineral density.},

   abstract = {INTRODUCTION: In adult patients, the diagnostic process for celiac disease (CD) is often very late and generates health complications that would be avoided by earlier diagnosis. The diseases of wich these patients were diagnosed before setting the diagnosis of CD were many and diverse. In addition, following a gluten-free diet (GFD) leads to a reduction in the quality of life for patients, who find it difficult to travel, to find accredited restaurants with menus without gluten, to interpretate food labels or to go to friends' houses. OBJECTIVE: To determine the delay in diagnosis, the satisfaction of the information provided by different sources and circumstances related to the quality of life. METHOD: A retrospective cross-sectional observational study in 98 adult celiac through a validated questionnaire for celiac patientes. RESULTS: The average delay in diagnosis was 11 years and the average of doctors consulted prior to confirmation of the CD was 6. Osteoporosis or osteopenia were nearly twice as common among those who took more than five years to be diagnosed. Some 90% say they transgress the dietary pattern, however, 58% show clinical symptoms due to unnoticed consumption of gluten. The impact of GFD on the quality of life is very high. CONCLUSIONS: Long delays in diagnosis suggest the need for greater awareness among physicians about the EC and the use of serological tests in potential patients or risk groups.},

Pregnant women who are vegetarian or vegan, have Crohn's or celiac disease, or have undergone gastric bypass surgery are at increased risk of B12 deficiency. Low serum levels of B12 have been linked to negative impacts in cognitive, motor, and growth outcomes. Low cobalamin levels also may be related to depression in adults. Some studies indicate that B12 supplementation may improve outcomes in children, although more research is needed in this area. Overall, the mechanisms of B12 action in development remain unclear. Further studies in this area to elucidate the pathways of cobalamin influence on development, as well as to prevent B12 deficiency in pregnant women and children are indicated.},

For this food matrix, the device had sensitivity towards gliadins of 1-2mg/kg and overall sensitivity and specificity of 77% and 78%, respectively. Moreover, the device never identified an ethanolic extract containing gliadins as "Gluten-free". Finally, the system also allowed distinguishing "Gluten-free" and "Gluten-containing" foodstuffs (15 foods, including breads, flours, baby milked flours, cookies and breakfast cereals) with an overall sensitivity and specificity greater than 83%, using the signals of only 4 selected polymeric membranes (selected using a stepwise procedure). Since only one "Gluten-containing" foodstuff was misclassified as "Gluten-free", the device could be used as a preliminary tool for quality control of foods for celiac patients.},

   abstract = {With a prevalence of 1% in western populations, Celiac disease (CD) is one of the most common inflammatory disorders of the small intestine. CD is often assumed to have its onset in childhood, but it has recently been suggested that adults can also develop CD. Clinical manifestations vary according to age group: infants and young children present with diarrhea, abdominal distention, and failure to thrive, whereas adults that develop CD not only present with diarrhea, but also with silent manifestations such as anemia, osteoporosis, or neurological symptoms. In the small intestine of celiac disease patients, dietary wheat gluten and similar proteins in barley and rye trigger an inflammatory response. While strict adherence to a gluten-free diet induces full recovery in most patients, a small percentage of patients fail to recover. In a subset of these refractory celiac disease patients, an (aberrant) oligoclonal intraepithelial lymphocyte population develops into overt lymphoma. Celiac disease is strongly associated with HLA-DQ2 and/or HLA-DQ8, as both genotypes predispose for disease development. mmunohistochemistry of the small intestine of patients shows villous atrophy, crypt hyperplasia, and elevated levels of intraepithelial lymphocytes (IELs). The only therapy until now is a gluten-free diet, which will normalize the clinical and histological manifestations and allows the patients to live an otherwise normal life. part of the symptoms are oral manifestations as dental enamel defects, aphthous ulcers and Atrophic Glossitis. The prevalence of caries in CD patiens is law as compared to the healthy population and in some cases the normal eruption sequence of the teeth was damaged. Part of the undiagnosed CD patients are among our patients and the enamel defects they present are misdiagnosed as tetracycline pigmentation or white spot lesions it is the practitioners responsibility to add CD as a possible cause to the findings and refer the patient to further examination. The case report in this paper presents a 47 years old female patient who was a patient in my practice for 25 years. When she became 40 she was diagnosed as CD and treated accordingly over the years enamel defects were treated conservatively. As the lesions became more frequent and unpredictable the patient demanded a full mouth solution that would restore both the functional and esthetical problems she had with her dentition. A full Porcelane Fused to Metal (PFZ) crowns were fabricated and the patient got a solution to both here demands. The crowns used were 3M Lava zirconia crowns and the case is presented as step by step sequence.},

   abstract = {The existence of mild forms of celiac disease (CD) can make the histology-based diagnosis difficult to reach. Since anti-endomysium (EMA) and anti-tissue transglutaminase (anti-tTG) are detectable in culture supernatants of duodenal biopsies from CD patients, our aim was to assess if this system can support the histology in the diagnostic work-up. A total of 559 suspected CD patients underwent serum EMA/anti-tTG detection, upper endoscopy with duodenal biopsy sampling, histologic analysis, and organ culture to detect EMA/anti-tTG in supernatants. A subgroup of 30 patients with organ culture positive results were put on a gluten-free diet (GFD). Their gluten-dependency was evaluated by the psychological general well-being and beck depression inventory indexes. Statistical analysis was performed by Cohen k inter-test, Friedman test, and Dunn multiple comparison. Two hundred forty-one out of 559 (43.1%) patients showed intestinal villous atrophy, whereas serum and organ culture EMA/anti-tTG were positive in 293/559 (52.4%) and 334/559 (59.7%) patients, respectively. The strength of agreement resulted good for serology vs histology (k = 0.730), good for organ culture vs histology (k = 0.662), and very good for serology vs organ culture (k = 0.852). After 12 months of GFD, psychological general well-being index significantly increased, and beck depression inventory index significantly decreased (P < 0.001 for each one). Data highlight the organ culture system as a useful tool to assist the histology in diagnosing CD, mainly in cases without villous atrophy or in seronegative patients. The marked improvement in quality of life after a GFD further supports the reliability of this system in diagnosing CD.},

   abstract = {On contact with the skin, nickel may cause allergic contact dermatitis, which can be diagnosed by an epicutaneous patch test. Nickel exposure via the intestinal mucosa can induce diarrhea, abdominal pain, and swelling. The aim of the present study was to investigate the relationship between these symptoms and nickel intake by means of a novel oral mucosa patch test. Eighty-six patients with intestinal symptoms related to ingestion of nickel-containing foods were submitted to epicutaneous and oral mucosa patch tests for nickel. All patients with positive oral mucosa patch test results were subject to a low-nickel diet and monitored over time. Skin lesions were observed in 33 out of 86 (38.4%) patients evaluated by the epicutaneous patch test. Mucosal lesions were seen in 53 out of 86 (61.6%) patients given the oral mucosa patch test. After 2 months of a low-nickel diet, 52 out of 53 (98.1%) patients showed an improvement of their symptoms. There is a significant correlation between response time of the oral mucosa patch test and the latency of symptoms after ingestion of nickel-containing foods. Consequently, the oral mucosa patch test can be used to recognize and study the adverse effects of dietary nickel exposure that could be defined as allergic contact mucositis. A low-nickel diet is also shown to be an effective treatment for this condition.},

   abstract = {UNLABELLED: The treatment of the celiac disease implies lifelong alimentary restrictions, with impact on social and family activities. Therefore, it is important to consider the health-related quality of life (HRQL) in the approach. OBJECTIVE: To validate the Argentinian version of the specific tool CDDUX in order to measure HRQL in children and adolescents with celiac disease. METHODS: In this prospective and transversal investigation, children and adolescents from 8 to 18 years-old who attended the "Prof Dr. J P Garrahan" Hospital and their father or tutor were recruited, between June 2009 and May 2010. Participants were given the informed consent sheet, the Argentinian version of CDDUX, a visual analogue scale (VAS) and the PedsQL 4.0, generic questionnaire. Sociodemographic data were also registered. RESULTS: We included 193 patients, female 56.5%, with these age categories: 8 to 11 years-old 48.7%, 12 to 15 years-old 43%, 16 to 18 years-old 8.3%. Schooling was below the standard level in children in 23.4% of cases, primary school incomplete in adults in 11.4%. Socioeconomic status was poor in 24.4% of cases and indigent in 4.7%. Unsatisfied basic needs were observed in 41.5% of patients. The feasibility was: average filling time: 4 minutes in children and parents. All completed the questionnaire. Without help: 91.7% in children and 79.8% in parents. The reliability was: Cronbach alpha's internal consistency 0.84 in children and 0.88 in parents. The construction validity was: moderate correlation between CDDUX and PedsQL (P < 0.001), low between parents and children in CDDUX (P < 0.001), moderate and negative between CDDUX and VAS (P < 0.001). Scores of CDDUX were lower in poor people and significant for parents (P = 0.04). Higher scores of CDDUX were observed in those patients who complied with the gluten-free diet (P < 0001). Conclusion. The Argentinian version of CDDUX was both feasible and easy to administer in the studied population. It shows good psychometric properties in children and parents.},

   abstract = {As the gluten-free diet (GFD) gains in popularity with the general public, health practitioners are beginning to question its real health benefits. For those patients with celiac disease (CD), the GFD is considered medical nutrition therapy, as well as the only proven treatment that results in improvements in symptomatology and small bowel histology. Those with wheat allergy also benefit from the GFD, although these patients often do not need to restrict rye, barley, and oats from their diet. Gluten sensitivity is a controversial subject, where patients who have neither CD nor wheat allergy have varying degrees of symptomatic improvement on the GFD. Conditions in this category include dermatitis herpetiformis (DH), irritable bowel syndrome (IBS), and neurologic diseases such as gluten-sensitive ataxia and autism. It is important for patients and healthcare practitioners to understand the differences between these conditions, even though they may all respond to a GFD. Patients with CD can experience comorbid nutrition deficiencies and are at higher risk for the development of cancers and other autoimmune conditions. Those with wheat allergy and gluten sensitivity are thought not to be at higher risk for these complications. Defining the symptoms and biochemical markers for gluten-sensitive conditions is an important area for future investigations, and high-quality, large-scale randomized trials are needed to prove the true benefits of the GFD in this evolving field.},

   abstract = {OBJECTIVE: Previous studies have shown a high cardiovascular risk in patients with autoimmune diseases, such as type 1 diabetes mellitus (T1DM). Conversely, few data are available about patients with celiac disease (CD). The aim of our study was to assess carotid intima-media thickness (c-IMT), in patients with T1DM, CD or both (T1DM+CD) as compared with age- and sex-matched healthy individuals (H). METHODS: We enrolled 120 patients, 30 with T1DM, 30 with CD, 30 with T1DM+CD and 30 H. Clinical, metabolic and anthropometric data were collected. All T1DM patients were on insulin while all CD patients were on a gluten-free diet. c-IMT was evaluated by high frequency linear digital ultrasound. RESULTS: c-IMT was significantly greater in patients with T1DM+CD than in patients with T1DM or CD (P<0.001 for both), while no difference was found between T1DM and CD. Moreover, c-IMT was greater in CD than in H (P<0.001). Glycemic control and disease duration were similar between T1DM+CD and T1DM. Lipid and anthropometric parameters were similar among groups. Furthermore, in a pooled multivariate analysis, only age and disease type were significantly correlated with c-IMT (P<0.001 for both). CONCLUSION: Our study demonstrates that celiac patients have greater c-IMT as compared with healthy individuals. Thus, non-invasive monitoring of c-IMT in CD might be useful in preventing cardiovascular disease. Moreover, patients with T1DM+CD show more severe subclinical atherosclerosis as compared with those presenting T1DM or CD only, suggesting that the association of these autoimmune diseases might accelerate the atherosclerotic process.},

   abstract = {The regenerating gene (REG) is a multigene family in humans that plays a role in tissue regeneration. The REG Ialpha protein is expressed in the pancreas and the gastrointestinal tract and is involved in the pathophysiology of gastritis, pancreatitis, cancer, inflammatory bowel disease, and type 1 diabetes (T1D). Celiac disease (CD) is an autoimmune disease caused by the ingestion of gluten in genetically susceptible individuals. Our aim was to determine whether the serum REG Ialpha concentration reflects the destructive/regenerative process in the small bowel in CD. REG Ialpha was determined by enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay (ELISA) in 40 patients with active CD, and in 19 of them, REG Ialpha was assessed after following a gluten free diet. As controls, 35 healthy subjects were included in the study. Autoantibodies to transglutaminase, gliadin, and endomisium were measured also. We found a significant increase in REG Ialpha in the sera of CD patients when compared with controls. REG Ialpha levels decreased after a gluten-free diet together with a significant reduction in antitransglutaminase antibodies. T1D and pernicious anemia patients displayed normal serum REG Ialpha concentrations. This preliminary study suggests that REG Ialpha protein levels can be used as a biomarker for the diagnosis and monitoring of CD.},

   abstract = {Celiac disease (CD) is an immune-mediated enteropathy, triggered by dietary wheat gluten and similar proteins of barley and rye in genetically susceptible individuals. The etiology of this disorder is complex, involving both environmental and genetic factors. The major genetic risk factor for CD is represented by HLA-DQ genes, which account for approximately 40% of the genetic risk; however, only a small percentage of carriers develop the disease. Gluten is the main environmental factor responsible for the signs and symptoms of the disease, but exposure to gluten does not fully explain the manifestation of CD. Epidemiological and clinical data suggest that environmental factors other than gluten might play a role in disease development, including early feeding practices (e.g., breast milk versus formula and duration of breastfeeding), infections, and alterations in the intestinal microbiota composition. Herein, we review what is known about the influence of dietary factors, exposure to infectious agents, and intestinal microbiota composition, particularly in early life, on the risk of developing CD, as well as the possible dietary strategies to induce or increase gluten tolerance.},

A wide spectrum of hepatobiliary diseases has been described, including asymptomatic elevations of liver enzyme levels, nonspecific hepatitis, nonalcoholic fatty liver disease, and autoimmune and cholestatic liver disease. Moreover, in the majority of patients, liver enzyme levels will normalize on a gluten-free diet. In addition, celiac disease may be associated with rare hepatic complications, such as hepatic T-cell lymphoma. Because many celiac patients do not have overt gastrointestinal symptoms, a high index of suspicion is required. Simple methods of detecting celiac disease such as serum antibody tests help in the early identification of the disease, thus preventing serious complications of the disorder. The IgG DGP antibody test and IgA tTG antibody test used in combination are an excellent screening test for suspected cases of celiac disease.},

   abstract = {BACKGROUND: Celiac disease (CD) is an autoimmune disease that develops in patients with a genetic predisposition, incurring a susceptibility to gluten-containing foods such as barley, wheat, and rye. The elimination of gluten from the diet is the main therapeutic approach and usually leads to clinical and laboratory improvement. There are no ideal markers that objectively assess dietary compliance in CD patients. MATERIALS AND METHODS: Sixty newly diagnosed CD patients (male/female: 43/17) and 40 healthy subjects (male/female: 23/17) were enrolled in this study. The diagnosis of CD was established by both histological findings of duodenum biopsy (total villous atrophy and lymphocytic infiltration) and positive antibodies against endomysium or gliadin. RESULTS: A significantly higher mean platelet volume (MPV) was observed in the CD group compared with healthy subjects (8.45 +/- 0.96 fL versus 7.93 +/- 0.63 fL; p = 0.004). After introduction of a gluten-free diet, the MPV of CD patients in the dietary adherent group was significantly lower than that of the non-adherent group (8.09 +/- 0.6 fL versus 8.9 +/- 1.08 fL; p = 0.001). Overall dietary adherence rate was 71.6% (43/60 CD patients). In the dietary compliant group, initiation of gluten-free diet was associated with a significant decrease in MPV from base-line values (8.56 fL versus 8.25 fL; p = 0.008). In the non-adherent group, MPV on 3-month follow-up was higher than at base-line (8.05 fL versus 8.91 fL; p = 0.001). CONCLUSION: MPV could be a promising and easily available biomarker for monitoring of dietary adherence in CD patients at a low cost in comparison with other modalities.},

The purpose of this study was to determine if young adults with and without DRCHCs differed with regard to disturbed eating behaviors and related psychographics characteristics (i.e., body image attributes, mental disorders, intrapersonal characteristics and sociocultural environment [i.e., media and family]). Each DRCHC participant (cases=166) was matched to 4 healthy participants (controls=664) based on gender and BMI (+/-0.50 BMI units). Conditional logistic regression analyses indicate cases were twice as likely to have been diagnosed by a healthcare provider with an eating disorder (p=0.08, OR=1.99, CI(90) [1.03-3.83]). Cases were significantly more likely to use Inappropriate Compensatory Behaviors to manage their weight, i.e., excessive exercise (p=0.04, OR=1.41, CI(95) [1.02-1.94]) and misuse medication (p=0.04, OR=1.14, CI(95) [1.00-1.29]) than controls. Depression and anxiety were significantly higher, and health status was significantly poorer in cases compared with controls. DRCHC participants were less likely to report feeling body image pressures from the media, placed a greater value on their health, used social diversion, and recalled a greater emphasis being placed on their mothers' weights and mealtimes being less structured than control participants. Findings indicate that nutrition and other healthcare professionals should incorporate screening DRCHC patients for disturbed eating behaviors and eating disorders in their standards of care.},

She had lived in the Netherlands all her life and was born of Moroccan parents. Her medical history revealed iron deficiency, growth retardation, and celiac disease, for which she was put on a gluten-free diet. She had progressive bone pain since 2 years, difficulty with walking, and about 15 kg weight loss. She had a short stature, scoliosis, and pronounced kyphosis of the spine and poor condition of her teeth. Laboratory results showed hypocalcemia, an immeasurable serum 25-hydroxyvitamin D level, and elevated parathyroid hormone and alkaline phosphatase levels. Spinal radiographs showed unsharp, low contrast vertebrae. Bone mineral density measurement at the lumbar spine and hip showed a T-score of -6.0 and -6.5, respectively. A bone scintigraphy showed multiple hotspots in ribs, sternum, mandible, and long bones. A duodenal biopsy revealed villous atrophy (Marsh 3C) and positive antibodies against endomysium, transglutaminase, and gliadin, compatible with active celiac disease. A bone biopsy showed severe osteomalacia but normal bone volume. She was treated with calcium intravenously and later orally. Furthermore, she was treated with high oral doses of vitamin D and a gluten-free diet. After a few weeks of treatment, her bone pain decreased, and her muscle strength improved. DISCUSSION: In this article, the pathophysiology and occurrence of osteomalacia as a complication of celiac disease are discussed.

The results show that many beneficial ingredients such as dietary fibers, phenolic antioxidants, marine ingredients, and n-3 fatty acids can be used in the bread industry to increase its functionality and result in healthy products, low in calories, cholesterol and celiac disease. Moreover, the use of psyllium seed, amaranth seed, chestnut flour and prebiotics in gluten-free bread (GFB) baking may be the promising frontier to improve overall appearance, quality, sensory properties, and shelf-life of GFB.},

   abstract = {Gluten, a complex protein group in wheat, rye, and barley, causes celiac disease (CD), an autoimmune enteropathy of the small intestine, in genetically susceptible individuals. CD affects about 1% of the general population and causes significant health problems. Adverse inflammatory reactions to gluten are mediated by inappropriate T-cell activation leading to severe damage of the gastrointestinal mucosa, causing atrophy of absorptive surface villi. Gluten peptides bind to the chemokine receptor, CXCR3, and induce release of zonulin, which mediates tight-junction disassembly and subsequent increase in intestinal permeability. Proinflammatory cytokine IL-15 also contributes to the pathology of CD, by driving the expansion of intra-epithelial lymphocytes that damage the epithelium and promote the onset of T-cell lymphomas. There is no cure or treatment for CD, except for avoiding dietary gluten. Current gluten thresholds for food labeling have been established based on the available analytical methods, which show variation in gluten detection and quantification. Also, the clinical heterogeneity of celiac patients poses difficulty in defining clinically acceptable gluten thresholds in gluten-free foods. Presently, there is no bioassay available to measure gluten-induced immunobiological responses. This review focuses on various aspects of CD, and the importance of gluten thresholds and reference material from an immunological perspective.},

   abstract = {BACKGROUND: Gluten sensitive enteropathy or celiac disease (CD) is a disorder of small bowel that occurs upon exposure to gluten. A total of 67 children of either sex in the age group of 1-12 years with unexplained failure to thrive were studied for the prevalence of CD. METHODS: This was a cross-sectional study. It included detailed history, clinical assessment, estimation of anti gliadin (AGA), tissue transglutaminase antibodies (tTGA) and duodenal biopsy. Treatment with gluten free diet and follow-up of diagnosed cases was done for one year. RESULT: Sixteen cases (23.88%) had villous atrophy and positive serology, essential criteria for the diagnosis of CD. Forty six (69%) children were between 4-12 years of age. Male to female ratio was 2.3:1. Main symptoms were irritability (63%), diarrhea (56%) and weight loss (56%). Thirty seven (56%) children had weight less than 3(rd) percentile. tTGA was 100% sensitive and 90.2% specific. Duodenal biopsy showed decreased villious-crypt ratio in 81.25% and intra epithelial lymphocytosis in 81% children (p<0.000001). All the confirmed cases were advised strict gluten free diet for one year. On follow-up at six months, all children showed improvement in their symptoms and weight gain. CONCLUSION: CD is an important cause of unexplained failure to thrive in children.},

   abstract = {BACKGROUND: Coeliac disease is managed by life-long gluten withdrawal from the diet. However, strict adherence to a gluten-free diet is difficult and is not always effective. Novel therapeutic approaches are needed to supplement or even replace the dietary treatment. AIM: To review recent advances in new therapeutic options for coeliac disease. METHODS: A literature search was performed on MEDLINE, EMBASE, Web of Science, Scopus, DDW.org and ClinicalTrials.gov for English articles and abstracts. The search terms used included, but not limited to, 'Celiac disease', 'new', 'novel', 'Advances', 'alternatives' and 'Drug therapy'. The cited articles were selected based on the relevancy to the review objective. RESULTS: Several new therapeutic approaches for coeliac disease are currently under development by targeting its underlying pathogenesis. Alternative therapies range from reproduction of harmless wheat strains to immunomodulatory approaches. Some of these therapies such as enzymatic cleavage of gluten and permeability inhibitors have shown promise in clinical studies. CONCLUSIONS: Gluten-free diet is still the only practical treatment for patients with coeliac disease. Novel strategies provide promise of alternative adjunctive approaches to diet restriction alone for patients with this disorder.},

   abstract = {INTRODUCTION: Celiac disease (CD) is a highly prevalent autoimmune disease. The symptoms of CD are varied and atypical, with many patients having no gastrointestinal symptoms. Metabolic bone disease (MBD) is a less recognized manifestation of CD associated with spectrum of musculoskeletal signs and symptoms, viz. bone pains, proximal muscle weakness, osteopenia, osteoporosis, and fracture. We here report five patients who presented with severe MBD as the only manifestation of CD. MATERIALS AND METHODS: Records of 825 patients of CD diagnosed during 2002-2010 were retrospectively analyzed for clinical features, risk factors, signs, biochemical, and radiological parameters. RESULTS: We were able to identify five patients (0.6%) of CD who had monosymptomatic presentation with musculoskeletal symptoms and signs in the form of bone pains, proximal myopathy, and fragility fractures without any gastrointestinal manifestation. All the five patients had severe MBD in the form of osteopenia, osteoporosis, and fragility fractures. Four of the five patients had additional risk factors such as antiepileptic drugs, chronic alcohol consumption, malnutrition, and associated vitamin D deficiency which might have contributed to the severity of MBD. CONCLUSION: Severe metabolic disease as the only presentation of CD is rare. Patients show significant improvement in clinical, biochemical, and radiological parameters with gluten-free diet, calcium, and vitamin D supplementation. CD should be looked for routinely in patients presenting with unexplained MBD.},

   abstract = {Celiac disease (CeD) is a disease more prevalent and multisymptomatic than was earlier recognized. Whereas prompt initiation of gluten-free diet (GFD) is beneficial in relieving the symptoms, an accurate CeD diagnosis is necessary also to avoid years of restricted diet on uncertain grounds. We propose a new diagnostic method, based on elution of deposited antibodies against transglutaminase (anti-tTG) from duodenal biopsies in patients with symptoms and screening serology analyses suggestive of CeD. The eluates were analyzed in a Phadia 250 fluoroimmunoassay, demonstrating elevated concentrations of anti-tTG in CeD patients, corresponding to serology and histopathology findings. In one case histology was inconclusive, displaying only unspecific inflammation, but eluted anti-tTG was positive. This patient has clinically improved following GFD. We conclude that our novel method represents a new tool in the diagnostic work up in CeD. The detection of deposited anti-tTG at the site of inflammation appears to provide a high sensitivity and specificity using a technique that is quick, simple and reliable. Further studies are needed for optimization and elucidation of suitable applications for this elution method.},

   abstract = {PURPOSE: Celiac disease is an autoimmune-mediated enteropathy characterized by adaptive and innate immune responses to dietary gluten in wheat, rye and barley in genetically susceptible individuals. Gluten-derived gliadin peptides are deamidated by transglutaminase 2 (TG2), leading to an immune response in the small-intestinal mucosa. TG2 inhibitors have therefore been suggested as putative drugs for celiac disease. In this proof-of-concept study we investigated whether two TG2 inhibitors, cell-impermeable R281 and cell-permeable R283, can prevent the toxic effects of gliadin in vitro and ex vivo. METHODS: Intestinal epithelial Caco-2 cells were treated with peptic-tryptic-digested gliadin (PT-gliadin) with or without TG2 inhibitors and thereafter direct toxic effects (transepithelial resistance, cytoskeletal rearrangement, junction protein expression and phoshorylation of extracellular-signal-regulated kinase 1/2) were determined. In an organ culture of celiac-patient-derived small-intestinal biopsies we measured secretion of TG2-autoantibodies into the culture medium and the densities of CD25- and interleukin (IL) 15-positive cells, forkhead box P3 (FOXP3)-positive regulatory T cells (Tregs) and Ki-67-positive proliferating crypt cells. RESULTS: Both TG2 inhibitors evinced protective effects against gliadin-induced detrimental effects in Caco-2 cells but the cell-impermeable R281 seemed slightly more potent. In addition, TG2 inhibitor R281 modified the gluten-induced increase in CD25- and IL15-positive cells, Tregs and crypt cell proliferation, but had no effect on antibody secretion in celiac-patient-derived biopsies. CONCLUSIONS: Our results suggest that TG2 inhibitors are able to reduce certain gliadin-induced effects related to responses in vitro and ex vivo.},

We examined the effect of coeliac patient IgA on the apical-to-basal passage of gluten-derived gliadin peptides p31-43 and p57-68 in intestinal epithelial cells. We demonstrate that coeliac IgA enhances the passage of gliadin peptides, which could be abolished by inhibition of TG2 enzymatic activity. Moreover, we also found that both the apical and the basal cell culture media containing the immunogenic gliadin peptides were able to induce the proliferation of deamidation-dependent coeliac patient-derived T cells even in the absence of exogenous TG2. Our results suggest that coeliac patient IgA could play a role in the transepithelial passage of gliadin peptides, a process during which they might be deamidated.},

   abstract = {A strict gluten-free diet (GFD) is the only currently available therapeutic treatment for patients with celiac disease (CD). Traditionally, treatment with a GFD has excluded wheat, barley and rye, while the presence of oats is a subject of debate. The most-recent research indicates that some cultivars of oats can be a safe part of a GFD. In order to elucidate the toxicity of the prolamins from oat varieties with low, medium, and high CD toxicity, the avenin genes of these varieties were cloned and sequenced, and their expression quantified throughout the grain development. At the protein level, we have accomplished an exhaustive characterization and quantification of avenins by RP-HPLC and an analysis of immunogenicity of peptides present in prolamins of different oat cultivars. Avenin sequences were classified into three different groups, which have homology with S-rich prolamins of Triticeae. Avenin proteins presented a lower proline content than that of wheat gliadin; this may contribute to the low toxicity shown by oat avenins. The expression of avenin genes throughout the development stages has shown a pattern similar to that of prolamins of wheat and barley. RP-HPLC chromatograms showed protein peaks in the alcohol-soluble and reduced-soluble fractions. Therefore, oat grains had both monomeric and polymeric avenins, termed in this paper gliadin- and glutenin-like avenins. We found a direct correlation between the immunogenicity of the different oat varieties and the presence of the specific peptides with a higher/lower potential immunotoxicity. The specific peptides from the oat variety with the highest toxicity have shown a higher potential immunotoxicity. These results suggest that there is wide range of variation of potential immunotoxicity of oat cultivars that could be due to differences in the degree of immunogenicity in their sequences.},

   abstract = {OBJECTIVES: There are few data on pediatric celiac disease in the United States. The aim of our study was to describe the presentation of celiac disease among children with a normal and an elevated body mass index (BMI) for age, and to study their BMI changes following a gluten-free diet (GFD). PATIENTS AND METHODS: One hundred forty-two children (age 13 months-19 years) with biopsy-proven celiac disease, contained in a registry of patients studied at our center from 2000 to 2008, had follow-up growth data available. Patients' height, weight, and BMI were converted to z scores for age and grouped by BMI as underweight, normal, and overweight. Compliance was confirmed using results of serological assays, and data of noncompliant patients were analyzed separately. Data were analyzed during the observation period and were expressed as change in height, weight, and BMI z score per month of dietary treatment. RESULTS: Nearly 19% of patients had an elevated BMI at diagnosis (12.6% overweight, 6% obese) and 74.5% presented with a normal BMI. The mean duration of follow-up was 35.6 months. Seventy-five percent of patients with an elevated BMI at diagnosis decreased their BMI z scores significantly after adherence to a GFD, normalizing it in 44% of cases. Of patients with a normal BMI at diagnosis, weight z scores increased significantly after treatment, and 13% became overweight. CONCLUSIONS: Both normal weight and overweight frequently occur in North American children presenting with celiac disease. A GFD may have a beneficial effect upon the BMI of overweight and obese children with celiac disease.},

After the gluten intake, an immune reaction against the protein occurs and damages villi of small intestine in celiac patients gradually. OBJECTIVES: The OSC, a filtering method for minimization of inter- and intra-spectrometer variations that influence on data acquisition, was applied to biofluid NMR data of CD patients. PATIENTS AND METHODS: In this study, metabolites of total 56 serum samples from 12 CD patients, 15 CD patients taking gluten-free diet (GFD), and 29 healthy cases were analyzed using nuclear magnetic resonance (NMR) and associated theoretical analysis. Employing ProMetab (version ProMetab_v3_3) software, data obtained from NMR spectra were reduced and orthogonal signal correction (OSC) effect on celiac disease metabonomics before and after the separation by principle component analysis (PCA) was investigated. RESULTS: The three groups were separated by OSC and findings were analyzed by partial least squares discriminant analysis (PLS-DA) method. Root mean square error of calibration (RMSEc) and correlation coefficient of calibration (Rc) for PLS-DA referred to an efficient group separation filtered by OSC. CONCLUSIONS: The applied leave-one-out cross-validation to PLS-DA method performed along with OSC confirmed validation of data analysis. Finally four metabolites are introduced as CD biomarkers.},

   abstract = {Coeliac disease is a permanent inflammatory disorder of the small bowel affecting approximately 1% of the population. The only effective treatment that exists is exclusion of gluten from the diet. The present paper aims to review the literature as to whether oats are safe to eat for people with coeliac disease. Much data exist on the restrictive nature that adhering to a gluten-free diet imposes on an individual. If oats could be eaten, this would help reduce the restrictive nature of the diet. This in turn could lead to an increase in the quality of life. Oats are of high-nutritional value, providing a rich source of fibre, vitamins and minerals. The fibre source contains soluble fibre which is believed to help reduce LDL-cholesterol. A systematic review of the literature was conducted. Earlier studies conducted are difficult to compare as they used different methodologies and it is not known whether samples of oats in the studies were contaminated with gluten from other cereals. Many studies reviewed do not state the strain of oat used. Recent research has suggested that it may only be in certain strains of oats which could produce a toxic response to people with coeliac disease. In conclusion, research suggests that the risk from consuming oats may be less harmful than first thought; however, may vary according to the strain of oat. Handling that risk in clinical practice remains controversial.},

   abstract = {OBJECTIVE: Assays for antibodies against native gliadin (anti-nGli) are still often assumed to perform better in the diagnosis of coeliac disease in young children than tests for antibodies to deamidated gliadin (anti-dGli), tissue transglutaminase (anti-tTG), and endomysium (EmA). We compared the performance of assays for anti-nGli, anti-dGli, anti-tTG, and EmA in this age group. METHODS: We investigated retrospectively 184 children (42 with coeliac disease under normal diet and 142 controls) up to 2 years of age. Immunoglobulin (Ig) A- and IgG-anti-dGli, IgA- and IgG-anti-nGli, IgA- and IgG-anti-tTG, and IgA-EmA were measured in serum. Areas under receiver operating characteristics curves, sensitivities, specificities, positive and negative predictive values, positive and negative likelihood ratios, as well as diagnostic odds ratios were calculated. RESULTS: From all of the tests investigated, only assays for IgG-anti-dGli, IgA-anti-tTG, and IgA-EmA had high specificity (>/= 0.96) connected with high sensitivity (>/= 0.86), with high positive predictive values (>/= 0.52 and >/= 0.69 at pretest probabilities of 0.05 and 0.1, respectively) and negative predictive values (>/= 0.99 and >/= 0.98 at pretest probabilities of 0.05 and 0.1, respectively). These assays also showed high positive likelihood ratio (>/= 24) at low negative likelihood ratio (</= 0.15) and high diagnostic odds ratios (>/= 136). CONCLUSIONS: Our results do not support the use of assays of anti-nGli to diagnose coeliac disease in young children. IgA-anti-tTG, IgA-EmA, and IgG-anti-dGli perform better than anti-nGli.},

BACKGROUND: Despite remission with a gluten-free diet, adults with coeliac disease and especially women experience a subjective poor health. Self-management education seems to be promising tool to help patients suffering from coeliac disease to cope with their disorder. DESIGN: A randomised controlled trial. METHODS: A total of 106 women, >/= 20 years, with confirmed coeliac disease, who had been on a gluten-free diet for a minimum of five years. The intervention group (n = 54) underwent a 10-session educational programme, 'Coeliac School', based on problem-based learning. The controls (n = 52) received information regarding coeliac disease sent home on a regular basis. The primary outcomes were psychological general well-being measured with a validated questionnaire. RESULTS: Participants in the Coeliac School reported a significant improvement in psychological well-being at 10 weeks, whereas the controls given usual care reported a worsening in psychological well-being. After six months, a significant improvement remained for the index of vitality. CONCLUSIONS: Patient education increased psychological well-being in women with coeliac disease. There is a need to refine the methods of patient education to make the effects of well-being more pronounced over time. RELEVANCE TO CLINICAL PRACTICE: Patient education using problem-based learning promotes self-management in coeliac disease by improving the well-being of patients who have been struggling with the gluten-free diet for years.},

   abstract = {Bile acids deactivate certain enzymes, such as prolyl endopeptidases (PEPs), which are investigated as candidates for protease-based therapy for celiac sprue. Deactivation by bile acids presents a problem for therapeutic enzymes targetted to function in the upper intestine. However, enzyme deactivation by bile acids is not a general phenomenon. Trypsin and chymotrypsin are not deactivated by bile acids. In fact, these pancreatic enzymes are more efficient at cleaving large dietary substrates in the presence of bile acids. We targeted the origin of the apparently different effect of bile acids on prolyl endopeptidases and pancreatic enzymes by examining the effect of bile acids on the kinetics of cleavage of small substrates, and by determining the effect of bile acids on the thermodynamic stabilities of these enzymes. Physiological amounts (5 mM) of cholic acid decrease the thermodynamic stability of Flavobacterium meningosepticum PEP from 18.5 +/- 2 kcal/mol to 10.5 +/- 1 kcal/mol, while thermostability of trypsin and chymotrypsin is unchanged. Trypsin and chymotrypsin activation by bile and PEP deactivation can both be explained in terms of a common mechanism: bile acid-mediated protein destabilization. Bile acids, usually considered non-denaturing surfactants, in this case act as a destabilizing agent on PEP thus deactivating the enzyme. However, this level of global thermodynamic destabilization does not account for a more than 50% decrease in enzyme activity, suggesting that bile acids most likely modulate enzyme activity through specific local interactions.},

Its mean prevalence in the general population is 1-2% worldwide. Our aim was to study the prevalence of celiac disease in a prospective series of Multiple Sclerosis (MS) patients and their first-degree relatives. METHODS: We analyzed the prevalence of serological, histological and genetic CD markers in a series of 72 MS patients and in their 126 first-degree relatives, compared to 123 healthy controls. RESULTS: Tissue IgA-anti-transglutaminase-2 antibodies were positive in 7 MS patients (10%), compared to 3 healthy controls (2.4%) (p < 0.05). OR: 5.33 (CI-95%: 1.074-26.425). No differences were found in HLA-DQ2 markers between MS patients (29%) and controls (26%) (NS).We detected mild or moderate villous atrophy (Marsh III type) in duodenal biopsies, in 8 MS patients (11.1%). We also found a high proportion of CD among first-degree relatives: 23/126 (32%). Several associated diseases were detected, mainly dermatitis 41 (57%) and iron deficiency anemia in 28 (39%) MS patients. We also found in them, an increased frequency of circulating auto-antibodies such as anti-TPO in 19 (26%), ANA in 11 (15%) and AMA in 2 (3%). CONCLUSIONS: We have found an increased prevalence of CD in 8 of the 72 MS patients (11.1%) and also in their first-degree relatives (23/126 [32%]). Therefore, increased efforts aimed at the early detection and dietary treatment of CD, among antibody-positive MS patients, are advisable.},

Its association with other metabolic processes is rarely described. We present the clinical case of a female adult patient of 43 years. From her infancy, she has had multiple fractures, needing several surgical interventions, and she was diagnosed of OI type 2 at adolescence age. Due mainly to difficulties in walking remaining in wheel-chair in the last three years, she was overweight with morbid obesity (BMI = 45.4) and had a type-II DM associated. She suffered from recurrent abdominal pain and chronic diarrhea and was diagnosed of celiac disease (CD) with increased intraepithelial duodenal infiltration, being classified as lymphocytic enteritis, Marsh I type. She was put on a gluten-free diet (GFD), having lost 6 kg of weight after 6 months, with a good control of DM-II and presenting a significant clinical improvement. It is rewarding to search the presence of two coincidental metabolic diseases associated to OI, specially CD, because of the dramatic clinical benefit in the general found after putting on a GFD.},

   abstract = {OBJECTIVE: To examine whether the perceived poor outcome of dietary treatment makes Swedish women with coeliac disease (CD) prone to use more health care services than other women. MATERIAL AND METHODS: The health care consumption over 36 consecutive months was examined for 137 Swedish women aged 20-80 years with CD in remission after living on a gluten-free diet for a median of 4 years (range 1-8 years). Comparisons were made with the health care consumption of 411 women in the general population matched for age and residence. RESULTS: The results show that women with CD use health care services annually a median of 5.0 times (range 0-76) that is more than female controls 3.6 (0-311) (p < 0.05) mainly in primary care and for complaints related to mental and behavioral disorders (ICD F), diseases of the digestive system (ICD K) and diseases of the musculoskeletal system and connective tissue (ICD M). CONCLUSIONS: Women with CD used health care services in keeping with studies indicating reduced health-related quality of life of people with this condition. The results provide evidence that women with CD in remission suffer from co-morbidities that may signal a need for a multidisciplinary follow-up of subjects with CD in Sweden.},

Although the terminologies like latent, silent and potential have expressed different aspects of clinical and pathological behaviour of CD, they also have contributed in some extent to confusion between clinicians and patients due to the multiple definitions and uncertainty around them. In the light of new advances and the discovery of entities such as non-celiac gluten sensitivity, using subclinical instead of silent and atypical instead of potential/latent may simplify the understanding behind the clinical behaviour of atypical CD. The evidence behind a lower threshold for starting a gluten free diet (GFD) in non-celiac gluten sensitive patients would strongly support applying a GFD treatment strategy in any forms of CD.},

   abstract = {Celiac disease (CD) was traditionally believed to be a chronic enteropathy, almost exclusively affecting people of European origin. Celiac disease is the permanent intolerance to dietary gluten, the major protein component of wheat. The availability of new, simple, very sensitive and specific serological tests has shown that CD is as common in Middle Eastern countries as in Europe, Australia and New Zealand where the major dietary staple is wheat. A high prevalence of CD has been found in Iran, in both the general population and the at-risk groups, i.e. patients with type 1 diabetes or irritable bowel syndrome (IBS). In developing countries, serological testing in at risk groups is necessary for early identification of celiac patients. Clinical studies show that presentation with non-specific symptoms or a lack of symptoms is as common in the Middle East as in Europe. Wheat is a major component of the Iranian diet and exposure to wheat proteins induces some degree of immune tolerance, leading to milder symptoms that may be mistaken with other GI disorders. The implementation of gluten free diet (GFD) is a major challenge for both patients and clinicians in Iran, especially since commercial gluten-free products are not available in this area.},

   abstract = {Screening studies using high-sensitivity and specificity markers indicate a prevalence of celiac disease of up to 1% in European and North-American populations. Celiac disease is a frequent condition that has become an important public health issue. Yet the majority of cases remain undiagnosed due to the polymorphism of its clinical manifestations. The new insight in the pathogenesis of celiac disease has lead to the development of new diagnostic tools. Early screening of symptomatic patients and pre-identified at-risk groups significantly improves the quality of life while reducing morbidity and mortality. However, prophylactic benefits of early diagnosis by assessing the general population have not been shown in any study. French and Northern American scientific societies have introduced serological testing in their newly revised strategies to diagnose celiac disease. Older markers judged insufficiently accurate like anti-gliadin and anti-reticulin antibodies have recently been withdrawn from the list of reimbursed medical expenses in France. Anti-endomysium and tissue transglutaminase IgA antibodies have proven to be at this day the most sensitive and specific markers for the diagnosis and follow-up of patients on gluten-free diet, at the exception of IgA-deficient patients. Assays testing for IgG antibodies are recommended upon IgA-deficiency. Although very accurate, a better standardisation of current assays may enable serological testing to replace in a near future histological confirmation brought by small bowel biopsies which remains today the gold standard test to diagnose celiac disease. Indeed, serological testing represents and attractive alternative as it is less invasive, less expansive, laboursaving and more objective in interpretation.},

   abstract = {UNLABELLED: In predisposed individuals dietary intake of cereal products may lead to the development of food allergy or celiac disease. These diseases may also coexist with each other. In recent years, a change in the clinical picture of celiac disease has been observed and the incidence of atypical forms has increased. The disease is currently either diagnosed late or often remains undiagnosed. The article presents a case of an underweight 11- year old girl with height deficiency and recurrent respiratory infections, as well as chronic rhinitis, occurring from the age of three. On the basis of complex differential diagnosis, sensitization to tree pollens, and to cow's milk protein and gluten were identified. Despite the detection of antibodies specific for celiac disease, such as the antibodies against smooth muscle endomysium (IgAEMA) and anti-tissue transglutaminase antibodies (IgAtTGAb), the histological confirmation of the diagnosis was not obtained. Implementation of the gluten and milk protein-free - elimination diet and the use of antihistamines resulted in clinical improvement and the disappearance of markers of both food sensitization and celiac disease. The second food provocation test was negative for previously detected markers of food sensitization but showed the presence of IgAEMA and IgAtTGAb and the histological features of intestinal mucosa typical for celiac disease. CONCLUSIONS: The diagnosis of food allergy or other chronic diseases which can cause growth disturbance (short stature and/or impaired weight gain ) should not exempt from the obligation of estimating the markers specific for celiac disease.},

   abstract = {Celiac disease (CD) affects at least 1% of the Western population but remains largely unrecognized. In our laboratory, we utilize a novel algorithm to diagnose pediatric CD that offers both high sensitivity and high specificity for diagnosis in an outpatient setting. The aim of the present study was to challenge this algorithm and to test its performance in children and adults suspected of having CD. Using a three-assay algorithm, screening with the most sensitive tissue transglutaminase (tTG) complexed with deamidated gliadin peptide neoepitope immunoglobulin A (IgA)+IgG assay and confirming with the two specific tTG IgA and tTG IgA+IgG assays, we examined the serological results from 112 children aged 0-17 years old and 60 adults in comparison to their respective biopsy results. The algorithm performance was calculated by statistical analysis. The use of the new algorithm enabled us to diagnose CD with 98% sensitivity, 93% specificity and 95% accuracy in the pediatric group and 94% sensitivity, 92% specificity and 93% accuracy in the total population studied. The false-negative cases in the adult group were attributed to previous adherence to a gluten-free diet, and the single false-negative result in a young child became a true positive after 6 months. We have also monitored three celiac patients before and after diagnosis and found that the algorithm may be suitable for disease monitoring. The newly proposed three-assay algorithm for celiac detection is very reliable in both children and adults. Due to the high performance of this assay, the further need for confirmatory intestinal biopsies will be reassessed.},

   abstract = {OBJECTIVE: To report the response to discontinuation of olmesartan, an angiotensin II receptor antagonist commonly prescribed for treatment of hypertension, in patients with unexplained severe spruelike enteropathy. PATIENTS AND METHODS: All 22 patients included in this report were seen at Mayo Clinic in Rochester, Minnesota, between August 1, 2008, and August 1, 2011, for evaluation of unexplained chronic diarrhea and enteropathy while taking olmesartan. Celiac disease was ruled out in all cases. To be included in the study, the patients also had to have clinical improvement after suspension of olmesartan. RESULTS: The 22 patients (13 women) had a median age of 69.5 years (range, 47-81 years). Most patients were taking 40 mg/d of olmesartan (range, 10-40 mg/d). The clinical presentation was of chronic diarrhea and weight loss (median, 18 kg; range, 2.5-57 kg), which required hospitalization in 14 patients (64%). Intestinal biopsies showed both villous atrophy and variable degrees of mucosal inflammation in 15 patients, and marked subepithelial collagen deposition (collagenous sprue) in 7. Tissue transglutaminase antibodies were not detected. A gluten-free diet was not helpful. Collagenous or lymphocytic gastritis was documented in 7 patients, and microscopic colitis was documented in 5 patients. Clinical response, with a mean weight gain of 12.2 kg, was demonstrated in all cases. Histologic recovery or improvement of the duodenum after discontinuation of olmesartan was confirmed in all 18 patients who underwent follow-up biopsies. CONCLUSION: Olmesartan may be associated with a severe form of spruelike enteropathy. Clinical response and histologic recovery are expected after suspension of the drug.},

   abstract = {OBJECTIVES: The prevalence of celiac disease (CD) in the United States is unknown. We sought to estimate CD prevalence nationwide by using a nationally representative sample. METHODS: This study included 7,798 persons aged 6 years or older who participated in the National Health and Nutrition Examination Survey 2009-2010. Serum samples from all participants were tested for immunoglobulin A (IgA) tissue transglutaminase antibodies and, if findings were abnormal, also for IgA endomysial antibodies. Information about prior diagnosis of CD and use of a gluten-free diet (GFD) was obtained by direct interview. CD was defined as having either double-positive serology (serologically diagnosed CD) or a reported diagnosis of CD by a doctor or other health-care professional and being on a GFD (reported clinical diagnosis of CD). RESULTS: CD was found in 35 participants, 29 of whom were unaware of their diagnosis. Median age was 45 years (interquartile range, 23-66 years); 20 were women and 29 were non-Hispanic white. The prevalence of CD in the United States was 0.71% (95% confidence interval (CI), 0.58-0.86%), with 1.01% (95% CI, 0.78-1.31%) among non-Hispanic whites. In all, 55 participants reported following a GFD, which corresponded to a prevalence of 0.63% (95% CI, 0.36-1.07%). CONCLUSIONS: The prevalence of CD in the United States was 0.71% (1 in 141), similar to that found in several European countries. However, most cases were undiagnosed. CD was rare among minority groups but affected 1% of non-Hispanic whites. Most persons who were following a GFD did not have a diagnosis of CD.},

   abstract = {The preferred treatment for hypothyroidism is oral levothyroxine (LT4) ingestion, in doses that ensure a sustained state of hormonal balance. Many different factors may significantly influence the absorption of LT4, including: interval between the ingestion of the drug and the last meal, eating habits, and different functional and organic pathologies of the gastro-intestinal tract. The main purpose of this paper is to review and systematise the available literature on the subject of the influence of different malabsorption syndromes on the effectiveness of LT4 preparations. The need to use high LT4 doses in the substitutional treatment of hypothyroidism is often the very first sign of one of the pathologies that are connected with malabsorption syndrome, which might have been asymptomatic and undiagnosed previously. Patients who require more than 2 mug/kg body weight of LT4 per day, with constantly increased thyrotropin level, should be diagnosed with the suspicion of pseudomalabsorption or real absorption disorder. An LT4 absorption test, using high doses of LT4, may be useful in the diagnosis of pseudomalabsorption. After excluding non-compliance, the differential diagnosis should include such disorders as lactose intolerance, coeliac disease, atrophic gastritis, Helicobacter pylori infection, bowel resection, inflammatory bowel disease, and parasite infection. Where there is a diagnosis of lactose intolerance, both a low lactose diet and a lactose-free LT4 preparation should be administered to restore euthyroidism or make it possible to decrease the dose of the LT4 preparation. In coeliac disease, a gluten-free diet usually allows a normalisation of the need for LT4, as do eradication of the H. pylori infection or parasite colonisation. In cases of atrophic gastritis or inflammatory bowel disease, treating the underlying diseases and regaining the state of remission may improve the absorption of LT4. In patients after gastro-intestinal tract surgery, a dose of LT4 higher than that typically used is needed to restore euthyroidism.},

   abstract = {Pancreatic exocrine insufficiency is a major consequence of pancreatic diseases (e. g. chronic pancreatitis and cystic fibrosis), extrapancreatic diseases like celiac disease and Crohn's disease, and gastrointestinal and pancreatic surgical resections. Recognition of this entity is highly relevant to avoid malnutrition-related morbidity and mortality. The main clinical consequence of PEI is fat maldigestion and malabsorption, resulting in steatorrhoea. Pancreatic exocrine function should be assessed by measuring levels of faecal elastase-1. Pancreatic enzyme replacement therapy is the mainstay of treatment for PEI. Administration of enzymes in form of enteric-coated minimicrospheres avoids acid-mediated lipase inactivation and ensures gastric emptying of enzymes in parallel with nutrients. In adults, the initial recommended dose of pancreatic enzymes is 25.000 units of lipase per meal, titrating up to a maximum of 80000 units of lipase per meal. Large meals require 25.000 - 80.000 units of lipase per meal while snacks require 10.000 - 40.000 units of lipase per meal. Oral pancreatic enzymes should be taken with meals to ensure adequate mixing with the chyme. Adjunct therapy with acid-suppressing agents may be useful in patients who continue to experience symptoms of PEI despite high-dose enzyme therapy. Patients with PEI should be encouraged to consume small, frequent meals and to abstain from alcohol. Dietary fat restriction is not recommended for patients with PEI.},

Through multiple diagnostic and screening tools such as small intestinal biopsy sample, serological testing, and human leukocyte antigen testing, healthcare providers can diagnose this disease that contains components related to genetic predisposition and intake of gluten proteins found in wheat, barley, and rye. There are some who believe that having an autoimmune disease may predispose one to acquiring another disease. With patients experiencing mostly diarrhea, abdominal pain, and weight loss, the implementation of a gluten-free diet is the treatment that healthcare providers recommend. Through monitoring gluten intake and providing nutritional supplementation, those diagnosed with celiac disease can lead a relatively normal life without complications. With celiac disease affecting all age ranges in the population, and with a documented higher frequency, there is a growing awareness in society that can be easily seen in grocery stores, restaurants, and food manufacturers.},

   abstract = {BACKGROUND AND OBJECTIVES: Celiac disease (CD) is an immune-mediated enteropathy, induced by gluten in genetically susceptible individuals. The objective of this study was to describe the clinical pattern of CD in children from the western region of Saudi Arabia. DESIGN AND SETTING: Retrospective, hospital-based. PATIENTS AND METHODS: This study included children with a biopsy-proven diagnosis of CD made between September 2002 and July 2007. Children were admitted to the endoscopy unit for a small-bowel biopsy if they had gastrointestinal symptoms suggestive of CD or if they were positive for a CD-antibody screen performed for the high-risk groups. RESULTS: Eighty children were identified with a diagnosis of CD. Their mean (SD) age was 9.6 (4.9) years (range, 0.5-18 years). There were 44 (55%) female patients. Forty-one (51%) patients were detected during screening of high-risk groups, while 39 (49%) patients had classical symptoms of malabsorption. The screening also detected asymptomatic patients. Of 65 patients tested, 11 (17%) had elevated liver function tests, which reverted to normal after introduction of a gluten-free diet (GFD) except in one case. Seventy-three (91%) patients were positive for anti-tissue transglutaminase antibodies, 18 (23%), for IgG anti-gliadin antibodies; and 46 (58%), for IgA anti-gliadin antibodies. Forty-one (56%) patients showed good adherence to GFD as assessed by dietary history and the decline in anti-tTG level. CONCLUSION: CD may present with classical symptoms or be identified through screening programs. Growth and laboratory abnormalities usually improve after introduction of a GFD. Adherence to a GFD remains a problem; therefore, thorough assessment and counseling at the time of diagnosis and ongoing care are crucial.},

   abstract = {The prevalence of celiac disease is about 1% in the population and is growing due to the wide use of immunological methods of diagnosis. In recent years, in-depth research of the celiac disease has led not only to an increase in the number of patients with celiac disease, but also to the emergence of a broad spectrum of diseases associated with the ingestion of gluten. In this regard, a new pathology, known as "gluten intolerance or gluten sensitivity", attracted special attention of researchers. Studies in recent years have established that patients with this pathology may have both gastrointestinal symptoms and extraintestinal manifestations. Examinations of such patients usually do not find histological changes of the mucous membrane of the small intestine and autoimmune antibodies (to tissue transglutaminase (tTG) and endomysial (EMA)); however an increased level of gliadin antibodies (AGA) is often observed. Allergy to gluten is also absent. A gluten-free diet for such patients, like in case of the celiac disease, leads to the disappearance of clinical symptoms. Exact criteria for the diagnosis of this nosology have not been identified so far, but most researchers believe that prevalence of "gluten intolerance" is much higher than that of celiac disease.},

   abstract = {INTRODUCTION: refractory iron-deficiency anemia has a multifactorial origin related to various gastrointestinal conditions, with celiac disease plus malabsorption and IBD together with isolated gluten intolerance being most common. OBJECTIVES: to determine the prevalence of serum, genetic, and histological markers for gluten intolerance, and to analyze the response to gluten withdrawal from the diet in these patients. METHODS: a number of patients with refractory anemia were prospectively and consecutively enrolled. A protocol to measure serum (TGt-2), genetic (HLA-DQ2/DQ8), and histological markers for celiac disease was applied. All followed a gluten-free diet for a median 3.6 years. Sustained remission of anemia during follow-up was interpreted as positive response. RESULTS: ninety-eight patients (84% females) with a mean age of 54 years were studied. Anti-TGt2 antibodies were positive in 5% of cases. A total of 67 cases (68%) were haplotype HLA-DQ2 or -DQ8 (+). We found villous atrophy (Marsh III) in 13% of patients, and an inflammatory pattern (Marsh I or II) in 13%. All remaining 72 patients (74%) had no histological duodenal changes.Age, anemia duration, number of transfusions, number of parenteral iron doses, and time on a gluten-free diet were all compared according to the presence or absence of villous atrophy and HLA-DQ2/8 positivity, and no significant differences were found for any of the analyzed variables. Response was positive in 92% of subjects. CONCLUSIONS: celiac disease with villous atrophy is rarely a cause of refractory anemia. Gluten intolerance with no histological lesions is seen in almost 75% of patients, and therefore plays a relevant role in its development.},

CD can manifest with classic symptoms; however, some unusual features like osteomalacia that has become more and more rare, may be the presenting symptom. We describe here a case of osteomalacia secondary to delayed diagnosis of celiac disease. This patient complained about progressive limping, weakness, short stature, and skeletal deformities. Radiological and laboratory findings were all in favor of osteomalacia. Celiac disease was mentioned according to the history of subtle intermittent diarrhea, abdominal discomfort and confirmed with intestinal biopsy and detection of specific autoantibodies. Improvement of patient's weakness and laboratory abnormalities was obvious after treatment with gluten free diet, vitamin D, calcium and other trace elements. In conclusion, this case affirms that chronic celiac disease especially untreated one, can lead to irreversible complications like skeletal deformities and short stature.},

   abstract = {BACKGROUND: There may be a positive association between coeliac disease and serum hypertransaminasaemia but evidence is conflicting. AIMS: To conduct a systematic review and meta-analysis to determine the prevalence of coeliac disease in adults presenting with cryptogenic serum hypertransaminasaemia and the prevalence of hypertransaminasaemia in patients with newly diagnosed coeliac disease. METHODS: MEDLINE and EMBASE were searched up to August 2010. Case series and case-control studies recruiting adults with either cryptogenic hypertransaminasaemia that applied serological tests for coeliac disease and/or distal duodenal biopsy to participants or newly diagnosed biopsy-proven coeliac disease that assessed serum transaminases were eligible. The pooled prevalence of coeliac disease in individuals presenting with abnormal serum transaminases and the pooled prevalence of hypertransaminasaemia in newly diagnosed coeliac disease were calculated with 95% confidence intervals (CI). RESULTS: Eleven eligible studies were identified. Pooled prevalences of positive coeliac serology and biopsy-proven coeliac disease in cryptogenic hypertransaminasaemia were 6% (95% CI 3% to 10%) and 4% (95% CI 1% to 7%) respectively. Pooled prevalence of abnormal serum transaminases in newly diagnosed coeliac disease was 27% (95% CI 13% to 44%). Exclusion of gluten led to normalisation of serum transaminase levels in 63% to 90% of patients within 1 year. CONCLUSIONS: Undetected coeliac disease is a potential cause for cryptogenic hypertransaminasaemia in 3% to 4% of cases. More than 20% of individuals with newly diagnosed coeliac disease may have abnormal serum transaminases and these normalise on a gluten-free diet in the majority of cases.},

However, the prevalence of these symptoms in patients with CD and their relation to adherence to a gluten-free diet (GFD) have not been assessed systematically. METHODS: We searched MEDLINE, EMBASE, and EMBASE Classic (through July 2012) to identify cross-sectional surveys or case-control studies reporting prevalence of IBS-type symptoms in adult patients (>/= 16 years old) with established CD. The number of individuals with symptoms meeting criteria for IBS was extracted for each study, according to case or control status and adherence to a GFD. Pooled prevalence and odds ratios (ORs), with 95% confidence intervals (CIs), were calculated. We analyzed data from 7 studies with 3383 participants. RESULTS: The pooled prevalence of IBS-type symptoms in all patients with CD was 38.0% (95% CI, 27.0%-50.0%). The pooled OR for IBS-type symptoms was higher in patients with CD than in controls (5.60; 95% CI, 3.23-9.70). In patients who were nonadherent with a GFD, the pooled OR for IBS-type symptoms, compared with those who were strictly adherent, was 2.69 (95% CI, 0.75-9.56). There was also a trend toward a higher OR for IBS-type symptoms among patients who did not adhere to the GFD, compared with controls (12.42; 95% CI, 6.84-11.75), compared with that observed for adherent CD patients vs controls (4.28; 95% CI, 1.56-11.75). CONCLUSIONS: IBS-type symptoms occur frequently in patients with CD and are more common than among controls. Adherence to a GFD might be associated with a reduction in symptoms.},

This questionnaire was administered to 265 CD participants with adherence and quality of life (QOL) measures, a GFD knowledge test, and self-reported psychiatric history. Regression analyses were used to test the fit of the TPB in predicting adherence, and to determine the nature of the relationships between adherence, QOL, knowledge, and psychiatric history. The TPB combined with self-reported depression and anxiety, and QOL explained significant variance in intention (41.0%) and adherence (33.7%). Poorer dietary adherence and psychiatric history were also associated with lower QOL. Findings suggest that the TPB provides an adequate model for predicting GFD adherence in CD, and the presence of psychiatric conditions represents a potential intervention target to improve adherence and QOL.},

   abstract = {This study examined the potential role of psychological symptoms in limiting the translation of positive intention into strict gluten free diet (GFD) adherence in coeliac disease (CD) within a theory of planned behaviour (TPB) framework. It was hypothesised that participants with more symptomatic psychological profiles would exhibit poorer adherence, primarily in the context of positive intentions. Coeliac disease participants (N=390) completed online measures of gluten free diet adherence, psychological symptoms, coping behaviour, and TPB items. Intention and behaviour were moderately correlated, confirming the existence of the intention-behaviour gap. Psychological symptoms accounted for additional variance over and above TPB variables in GFD adherence but not intention. Participants who failed to act on their positive intentions displayed more psychological symptoms and greater reliance on maladaptive coping strategies than those with consistent intention-behaviour relationships (p<.01). The heightened incidence of psychological symptoms in CD has a small but significant negative impact on the ability to translate positive intentions into strict adherence. Directions for future research including interventions to improve GFD adherence are discussed.},

Two hundred and seventy-four subjects served as controls (114 healthy blood donors, 80 healthy children and 80 patients with primary biliary cirrhosis). a-DGP (IgG and IgA) and anti-tissue transglutaminase antibodies (AtTG) were detected by enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay (Elisa). Anti-endomysium antibodies (AEA) were detected by indirect immunofluorescence on human umbilical cord. RESULTS: The sensitivitiy of IgG and IgA a-DGP were 94% and 97% respectively, compared to 96% for AEA and AtTG. The specificity of a-DGP was 93.6% for IgG and 92% for IgA. The specificity of AEA and AtTG were 100%. The frequency of IgG and IgA a-DGP was significantly higher in patients with CD than in control group (94% vs. 4.4%, P<10(-7); 97% vs. 8%, P<10(-7)). The frequency of IgG a-DGP was the same in children and adult (94%). The frequency of IgA a-DGP were similar in children and adults (95.5% vs. 100%). CONCLUSION: Our study shows that a-DGP increases neither the sensitivity nor the specificity of AEA and AtTG.},

   abstract = {AIM: To determine the incidence of peripheral fractures in patients with celiac disease (CD) and the effect of treatment on fracture risk. METHODS: We compared the incidence and risk of peripheral fractures before and after diagnosis between a cohort of 265 patients who had been diagnosed with CD at least 5 years before study entry and a cohort of 530 age- and sex-matched controls who had been diagnosed with functional gastrointestinal disorders. Data were collected through in-person interviews with an investigator. The overall assessment window for patients was 9843 patient-years (2815 patient-years after diagnosis). RESULTS: Compared with the control group, the CD cohort showed significantly higher incidence rate and risk of first peripheral fracture before diagnosis [adjusted hazard ratio (HR): 1.78, 95% CI: 1.23-2.56, P < 0.002] and in men (HR: 2.67, 95% CI: 1.37-5.22, P < 0.004). Fracture risk was significantly associated with the classic CD presentation with gastrointestinal symptoms (P < 0.003). In the time period after diagnosis, the risk of fractures was comparable between the CD cohort and controls in both sexes (HR: 1.08, 95% CI: 0.55-2.10 for women; HR: 1.57, 95% CI: 0.57-4.26 for men). CONCLUSION: CD patients have higher prevalence of fractures in the peripheral skeleton before diagnosis. This is associated with male sex and classic clinical presentation. The fracture risk was reduced after the treatment.},

   abstract = {Historically, it has been reported that patients with undetected celiac disease (CD) may present with irritable bowel syndrome (IBS) type symptoms. This has led to the recommendation by the American College of Gastroenterology Task force that patients presenting with diarrhea predominant IBS type symptoms should be serologically tested for CD. Concurrently speculative media data suggest that the US general public have increased their uptake of a gluten-free diet (GFD) far in excess of the known prevalence of CD. This may suggest that individuals with gastrointestinal symptoms are deriving benefit from a GFD even if they do not have CD. This has led to the scientific community considering the evidence for an emerging concept of non-celiac wheat sensitivity. There is a significant disparity in our views about what this phenomenon may be. There is also confusion about the nomenclature for this entity and indeed whether patients are suffering due to symptoms related to gluten or perhaps other components of wheat, for example fructans. In this month's edition of the American Journal of Gastroenterology, we see evidence to support the clinical concept of wheat sensitivity or intolerance. Irrespective of the nomenclature Carroccio provides a clinically applicable approach that may be adopted internationally by clinicians. This offers a new option in our armamentarium when seeing patients with IBS type symptoms.},

   abstract = {OBJECTIVE: Celiac disease is an intestinal disorder identified by mucus inflammation, villous atrophy and crypt hyperplasia. This disorder can be controlled by elimination of gluten from daily diet. Patients with celiac disease are at greater risk of gastrointestinal malignancy and non-Hodgkin lymphoma than are the general population. This study tries to present the value of gluten patch test for diagnosis of celiac disease. METHODS: In this investigation, the study population was divided into case and control groups. The case group consisted of patients with celiac disease. The control group were patients involved in celiac disease but suffering from other gastrointestinal disorders. Both gluten patch and placebo patch were attached to the skin between the scapulas. The results were read twice: 48 hours and 96 hours after the patch was applied. Patients who showed irritation reactions were withdrawn from this study. The results were analysed by SPSS software, Spearman's test, chi square, and Mann-Whitney tests. FINDINGS: The value obtained from the gluten patch test after 96 hours are as follows: specification at 95%, sensitivity at 8%, positive prediction value at 67%, and negative prediction value at 43%. CONCLUSION: It can be concluded that the gluten patch test is not an efficient test for screening of celiac disease, however, it can be useful for diagnosis of celiac disease if employed and studied with clinical symptoms and serologic and biopsy tests. Furthermore, we should doubt our judgment if the result of gluten patch test for the patient with celiac disease is positive.},

   abstract = {Strategies to prevent or reduce the risk of allergic diseases are needed. The time of exclusive breastfeeding and introduction of solid foods is a key factor that may influence the development of allergy. For this reason, the aim of this review was to examine the association between exposure to solid foods in the infant's diet and the development of allergic diseases in children. Classical prophylactic feeding guidelines recommended a delayed introduction of solids for the prevention of atopic diseases. Is it really true that a delayed introduction of solids (after the 4th or 6th month) is protective against the development of eczema, asthma, allergic rhinitis and food or inhalant sensitisation? In recent years, many authors have found that there is no statistically significant association between delayed introduction of solids and protection for the development of allergic diseases. Furthermore, late introduction of solid foods could be associated with increased risk of allergic sensitisation to foods, inhalant allergens and celiac disease in children. Tolerance may be driven by the contact of the mucosal immune system with the allergen at the right time of life; the protective effects seem to be enhanced by the practice of the breastfeeding at the same time when weaning is started. Therefore, recent guidelines propose a "window" approach for weaning practice starting at the 17th week and introducing almost all foods within the 27th week of life to reduce the risk of chronic diseases such as allergic ones and the celiac disease. Guidelines emphasize the role of breastfeeding during the weaning practice.},

Current data suggest that patients with mild enteropathy may be present with gluten-sensitive symptoms and complications. AIM: To investigate the prevalence of GSE, including mild enteropathy, in patients with dysmotility-like dyspepsia symptoms. METHODS: We retrospectively studied 142 patients who presented dysmotility-like dyspepsia symptoms and normal upper gastrointestinal endoscopy. Endoscopic duodenal biopsies were taken and processed using hematoxylin-eosin staining and CD3 immunophenotyping. In patients with enteropathy (number of intraepithelial lymphocytes greater than 25 per 100 enterocytes) we also performed coeliac serology (anti-tissue transglutaminase IgA) and HLA-DQ2/DQ8 genotyping. A gluten-free diet was offered if one of these markers was positive. The final GSE diagnosis was established based on clinical and histopathological response to the gluten-free diet after 18 months of follow-up. RESULTS: Fifty-one patients (35.9%) had enteropathy; 4 (2.8%) Marsh type 3b, 24 (16.9%) Marsh type 3a, 3 (2.1%) Marsh type 2, and 20 (14.1%) Marsh type 1. A positive serology result was extremely low (6.7%) in mild enteropathy (Marsh type 1-3a) in contrast with Marsh type 3b patients (50%). Most patients with enteropathy had positive HLA DQ2 or -DQ8 genotyping (84.1%). Out of the 37 patients who started a gluten-free diet, 34 (91.9%) improved their symptoms, and 28 of 32 (87.5%) had a histopathological or serological response. A final GSE diagnosis was established in 28 of the 142 patients (19.7%). CONCLUSION: Gluten-sensitive enteropathy can be a frequent and unsuspected cause of dysmotility-like dyspepsia.},

   abstract = {OBJECTIVE: We evaluated menopause-associated disorders and fertile life span in women with celiac disease (CD) under untreated conditions and after long-term treatment with a gluten-free diet. METHODS: The participants were 33 women with CD after menopause (untreated CD group), 25 celiac women consuming a gluten-free diet at least 10 years before menopause (treated CD group), and 45 healthy volunteers (control group). The Menopause Rating Scale questionnaire was used to gather information on menopause-associated disorders. The International Physical Activity Questionnaire was used to acquire information on physical activity. RESULTS: Untreated celiac women had a shorter duration of fertile life span than did the control women because of an older age of menarche and a younger age of menopause (P < 0.01). The scores for hot flushes, muscle/joint problems, and irritability were higher in untreated celiac women than in the control women (higher by 49.4%, 121.4%, and 58.6%, respectively; P < 0.05). In comparison with untreated CD, long-lasting treatment of CD was not associated with a significant difference in the duration of fertile life span, but was only associated with a significant reduction in muscle/joint problems (a reduction of 47.1%; P < 0.05). CONCLUSIONS: Late menarche and early menopause causes a shorter fertile period in untreated celiac women compared with control women. A gluten-free diet that started at least 10 years before menopause prolongs the fertile life span of celiac women. The perception of intensity of hot flushes and irritability is more severe in untreated celiac women than in controls. Low physical exercise and/or poorer quality of life frequently reported by untreated celiac women might be the cause of reduced discomfort tolerance, thus increasing the subjective perception of menopausal symptoms.},

Gluten proteins are responsible for the symptoms of celiac disease, but other environmental factors that influence the intestinal ecosystem, including the milk-feeding type and gastrointestinal infections, may also play a role. Moreover, intestinal dysbiosis, characterized by increased Gram-negative bacteria and reduced bifidobacteria, has been detected in celiac disease patients. This review summarizes current knowledge of the associations between the intestinal microbiota and celiac disease and its possible modes of action in pathogenesis. Deeper understanding of these interactions can help redefine how this disorder is investigated.},

   abstract = {A decade ago celiac disease was considered extremely rare outside Europe and, therefore, was almost completely ignored by health care professionals. In only 10 years, key milestones have moved celiac disease from obscurity into the popular spotlight worldwide. Now we are observing another interesting phenomenon that is generating great confusion among health care professionals. The number of individuals embracing a gluten-free diet (GFD) appears much higher than the projected number of celiac disease patients, fueling a global market of gluten-free products approaching $2.5 billion (US) in global sales in 2010. This trend is supported by the notion that, along with celiac disease, other conditions related to the ingestion of gluten have emerged as health care concerns. This review will summarize our current knowledge about the three main forms of gluten reactions: allergic (wheat allergy), autoimmune (celiac disease, dermatitis herpetiformis and gluten ataxia) and possibly immune-mediated (gluten sensitivity), and also outline pathogenic, clinical and epidemiological differences and propose new nomenclature and classifications.},

   abstract = {Objectives. To our knowledge, the occurrence of esophagitis in children with celiac disease (CD) has never been evaluated. The aim of this study is to determine the prevalence of esophagitis in children with CD. Patients and Methods. Between 2003 and 2007, children with biopsy confirmed CD were retrospectively identified. Biopsy reports were reviewed for esophageal inflammation. Biopsy reports of 2218 endoscopies performed during the same period were also evaluated for inflammation. Results. Forty-nine children diagnosed with CD (47% boys). Nineteen of 49 (39%) patients with CD had esophagitis (95% CI 0.23-0.5). Thirty percent of boys and 46% of girls with CD had esophagitis (95% CI 0.12-0.40). Overall, 45% of patients who underwent upper endoscopy had esophagitis. The prevalence of esophagitis in CD (39%) compared to the prevalence of esophagitis (45%) in our practice was not significantly different, P = 0.2526. Conclusion. There was no difference in the prevalence of esophagitis between children diagnosed with CD at the time of their diagnostic EGD and the prevalence of esophagitis in children without CD. A prospective study to determine whether the esophagitis should be treated with acid suppression or whether the esophagitis heals with the gluten-free diet is warranted.},

The aim of this study is to investigate the effects of coeliac disease on cardiac function in children using conventional transthoracic echocardiography (TTE) and tissue Doppler echocardiography (TDE). Methods. Coeliac disease patients were evaluated in two different groups based on serum endomysial antibody (EmA) titers (EmA (+) and EmA (-)), and the data obtained by conventional and TDE studies were compared between the patient groups and healthy controls. Results. There was no significant difference between EmA (+) and EmA (-) groups in terms of the conventional TTE parameters, including ejection fraction (EF), fractional shortening (FS), and left ventricle end diastolic diameter (LVEDD), that show the left ventricular systolic function (P = 0.727, P = 0.317, P = 0.118). TDE showed a significant difference in left ventricle (LV) isovolumic relaxation time (LV IVRT) and LV myocardial performance index (LV MPI) parameters between EmA (+) and EmA (-) patient groups (P < 0.0001). Conclusion. The measurement of LV MPI and LV IVRT parameters by TDE would be beneficial in early determination of the cardiac involvement and establishing appropriate treatment and followup of patients with coeliac disease as well as in making distinction between EmA (+) and EmA (-) patients.},

This immune-mediated enteropathy is characterized by villous atrophy, intraepithelial lymphocytosis, and crypt hyperplasia. Once thought a disease that largely presented with malnourished children, the wide spectrum of disease activity is now better recognized and this has resulted in a shift in the presenting symptoms of most patients with CD. New advances in testing, both serologic and endoscopic, have dramatically increased the detection and diagnosis of CD. While the gluten-free diet is still the only treatment for CD, recent investigations have explored alternative approaches, including the use of altered nonimmunogenic wheat variants, enzymatic degradation of gluten, tissue transglutaminase inhibitors, induction of tolerance, and peptides to restore integrity to intestinal tight junctions.},

   abstract = {HISTORY AND ADMISSION FINDINGS: A 49-year-old man presented with a four-week history of fatigue and physical weakness. He was of slender build (BMI 19,5 kg/m (2)) and pale. He also had vitiligo. Diabetes mellitus type 1 and Hashimoto thyreoiditis had been previously diagnosed. INVESTIGATIONS: Laboratory tests revealed iron deficiency anemia with depleted iron reserves (hemoglobin 5,9 g/dl; normal range 14,0 - 18,0). Vitamin B (12) and folic acid were also low. A probable cause was thought to be malabsorption. Antibodies against endomysium and tissue transglutaminase were elevated. Esophagogastroduodenoscopy and videocapsule endoscopy showed villous atrophy in the duodenum and jejunum. Histomorphological findings were compatible with celiac disease (Marsh stage 3a). Osteodensitometry showed significantly lowered bone density. DIAGNOSIS, TREATMENT AND COURSE: These investigations indicated atypical celiac disease with malabsorption, anemia and osteoporosis. The patient received nutritional counseling and was put on a gluten-free diet. Supplementary iron, folic acid and vitamin B (12) were prescribed. A bloodtransfusion was given for the symptomatic anemia. The osteoporosis was treated with calcium and vitamin D3. A follow-up examination after four months revealed complete remission of the abnormal clinical and laboratory findings with partial remission of endoscopic and histologic changes (reduced to Marsh stage 2). CONCLUSION: Because of the lack of gastrointestinal symptoms, the diagnosis of atypical celiac disease is often made only at an advanced stage and advanced age. The disease is often associated with other autoimmune disorders.},

   abstract = {In celiac disease, the gut-associated immune system is activated in response to the ingestion of gluten, causing an atrophy of the small intestinal mucosa. Although this condition is, in most cases, responsive to a gluten-free diet, celiac disease refractory to treatment occurs in a small percentage of celiacs. An epithelial barrier defect is known to be an integral part of celiac pathophysiology. However, the mucosa in refractory celiac disease underlies a constant inflammatory process. The epithelial barrier has not been addressed in this condition so far. Herein, the tight junction-associated barrier in refractory celiac disease is investigated functionally and structurally. Although normally expressed in celiac disease, claudin-4 is shown to be downregulated in refractory cases, presumably by two mechanisms, reduced protein expression and increased claudin endocytosis. Furthermore, the tightening claudin-5 is downregulated and the pore-forming claudin-2 is upregulated.},

   abstract = {Celiac disease (CD) is a unique autoimmune disorder in which the genetic factors (DQ2/DQ8) and the environmental trigger (gluten) are known and necessary but not sufficient for its development. Other environmental components contributing to CD are poorly understood. Studies suggest that aspects of gluten intake might influence the risk of CD occurrence and timing of its onset, i.e., the amount and quality of ingested gluten, together with the pattern of infant feeding and the age at which gluten is introduced in the diet. In this study, we hypothesize that the intestinal microbiota as a whole rather than specific infections dictates the switch from tolerance to immune response in genetically susceptible individuals. Using a sample of infants genetically at risk of CD, we characterized the longitudinal changes in the microbial communities that colonize infants from birth to 24 months and the impact of two patterns of gluten introduction (early vs. late) on the gut microbiota and metabolome, and the switch from gluten tolerance to immune response, including onset of CD autoimmunity. We show that infants genetically susceptible to CD who are exposed to gluten early mount an immune response against gluten and develop CD autoimmunity more frequently than at-risk infants in which gluten exposure is delayed until 12 months of age. The data, while derived from a relatively small number of subjects, suggest differences between the developing microbiota of infants with genetic predisposition for CD and the microbiota from infants with a non-selected genetic background, with an overall lack of bacteria of the phylum Bacteriodetes along with a high abundance of Firmicutes and microbiota that do not resemble that of adults even at 2 years of age. Furthermore, metabolomics analysis reveals potential biomarkers for the prediction of CD. This study constitutes a definite proof-of-principle that these combined genomic and metabolomic approaches will be key to deciphering the role of the gut microbiota on CD onset.},

   abstract = {Tissue transglutaminase 2 (tTG2) is an intestinal digestive enzyme which deamidates already partially digested dietary gluten e.g. gliadin peptides. In genetically predisposed individuals, tTG2 triggers autoimmune responses that are characterized by the production of tTG2 antibodies and their direct deposition into small intestinal wall. The presence of such antibodies constitutes one of the major hallmarks of the celiac disease (CD). Epidermal transglutaminase (eTG) is another member of the transglutaminase family that can also function as an autoantigen in a small minority of CD patients. In these relatively rare cases, eTG triggers an autoimmune reaction (a skin rash) clinically known as dermatitis herpetiformis (DH). Although the exact mechanism of CD and DH pathogenesis is not well understood, it is known that tTG2 and eTG share antigenic epitopes that can be recognized by serum antibodies from both CD and DH patients. In this study, the confocal microscopy examination of biopsy samples from skin lesions of two rhesus macaques (Macaca mulatta) with dermatitis (Table 1, Fig. 1 and 2) was used to study the affected tissues. In one animal (EM96) a spectral overlap of IgA and tTG2 antibodies (Fig. 3) was demonstrated. The presence of double-positive tTG2+IgA+ cells was focused in the deep epidermis, around the dermal papillae. This is consistent with lesions described in DH patients. When EM96 was placed on a gluten-free diet, the dermatitis, as well as tTG2+IgA+ deposits disappeared and were no longer detectable (Figs. 1-3). Dermatitis reappeared however, based on re-introduction of dietary gluten in EM96 (not shown). In other macaques including animal with unrelated dermatitis, the tTG2+IgA+ deposits were not detected. Gluten-free diet-dependent remission of dermatitis in EM96 together with presence of tTG2+IgA+ cells in its skin suggest an autoimmune, DH-like mechanism for the development of this condition. This is the first report of DH-like dermatitis in any non-human primate.},

The Canadian Celiac Association recently released guidelines governing the production of pure oats. The objective was to test the safety of a product manufactured under these guidelines. METHODS: Fifteen adults with established, biopsy-confirmed celiac disease of >/= 1 year duration were challenged with 350 g/wk of pure oats for 12 weeks. Symptom scores, weight, hemoglobin, ferritin, albumin, and tissue transglutaminase (tTG) were assessed at weeks 0, 6, and 12. Duodenal biopsies were obtained before and after oat challenge and assessed based on the modified Marsh-Oberhuber score. Compliance with a gluten-free diet was monitored with random food diaries. RESULTS: Fifteen patients completed the study and were analyzed in intention-to-treat and per-protocol analyses. There were no significant changes in symptom scores, weight, hemoglobin, ferritin, or albumin during oat consumption. The tTG remained negative in all patients, and the histology scores did not significantly change during oat challenge. The only relapse occurred in a patient who became noncompliant with her gluten-free diet. CONCLUSION: The findings support the safety of pure, uncontaminated oats manufactured under Canadian Celiac Association guidelines for patients with celiac disease.},

   abstract = {BACKGROUND: Identification of adjuvant treatment is necessary for rapid and effective treatment in patients with celiac disease. In a pilot randomized controlled trial, the effect of prednisolone on enterocyte apoptosis and regeneration in celiac disease was investigated. PATIENTS AND METHODS: Thirty-three treatment-naive patients with celiac disease were randomized to either gluten-free diet (GFD, n = 17) or GFD + prednisolone (1 mg/kg for 4 weeks, n = 16). Duodenal biopsies were taken at baseline and at 4 and 8 weeks posttreatment. Six patients with functional dyspepsia were recruited as controls. All these biopsies were stained for markers of intrinsic apoptotic pathway (AIF, H2AX, p53), common apoptotic pathway (CC3, M30), apoptotic inhibitors (XIAP, Bcl2), and epithelial proliferation (Ki-67). Apoptotic (AI) and proliferation indices (PI) were compared. RESULTS: At baseline duodenal biopsies, the end apoptotic products H2AX and M30 were significantly increased. In comparison with those treated with GFD alone, after 4 weeks of GFD + prednisolone treatment, some markers of both intrinsic and common apoptotic pathways showed rapid decline. After prednisolone withdrawal, there was overexpression of H2AX, CC3, and p53 in the latter group. In comparison with those treated with only GFD, patients treated with prednisolone showed suppression of mucosal PI, which started rising again after withdrawal of prednisolone. CONCLUSIONS: Apoptosis takes place in mucosal epithelium in celiac disease. Addition of short course of prednisolone suppresses apoptosis rapidly. However, it also suppresses epithelial regeneration; hence, if used, it should be withdrawn after an initial short course.},

   abstract = {Screening for coeliac disease is recommended for children from certain risk groups, with implications for diagnostic procedures and dietetic management. The risk of a malignant complication in untreated coeliac disease is not considered high in children. We present the case of a girl with type I diabetes who developed weight loss, fatigue, and inguinal lymphadenopathy. Four years before, when she was asymptomatic, a screening coeliac tTG test was positive, but gluten was not eliminated from her diet. Based on clinical examination, a duodenal biopsy, and an inguinal lymph node biopsy were performed, which confirmed both coeliac disease and an anaplastic large-cell lymphoma. HLA-typing demonstrated that she was homozygous for HLA-DQ8, which is associated with higher risk for celiac disease, more severe gluten sensitivity, and diabetes susceptibility. She responded well to chemotherapy and has been in remission for over 4 years. She remains on a gluten-free diet. This is the first case reporting the association of coeliac disease, type I diabetes, and anaplastic large-cell lymphoma in childhood. The case highlights the malignancy risk in a genetically predisposed individual, and the possible role of a perpetuated immunologic response by prolonged gluten exposure.},

METHODS: Patients with CD and/or inflammatory bowel disease (IBD) were recruited from the gastroenterology clinics at a medical center and local support groups. Control subjects without CD or IBD were recruited from the staff of the medical center as well as relatives and attendees at support groups. Each participant completed a survey that used two validated PN instruments to define and characterize PN. RESULTS: In the CD group, 38.9% met criteria for PN compared with 38.7% in the IBD group (P = 0.97) and 20.5% in the control group (P < 0.001). On multiple logistic regression, the odds of PN after adjusting for age, gender, diabetes, vitamin B12 deficiency, and cancer history were increased for CD (odds ratio, 2.51; 95% confidence interval, 1.82-3.47) and IBD (odds ratio, 2.78; 95% confidence interval, 1.85-4.18). CONCLUSIONS: PN is more often found in patients with CD and/or IBD than in the general population.},

   abstract = {BACKGROUND: Life-long gluten-free diet (GFD) is the only recognised treatment for coeliac disease (CD). The present study aimed to determine the nutritional adequacy of the 'no detectable gluten' diet. METHODS: Seven-day prospective food intake was assessed in 55 patients who were adherent to a GFD for more than 2 years and in 50 newly-diagnosed age- and sex-matched patients (18-71 years, 24% male) studied prospectively over 12 months on GFD. Historical precoeliac intake was also assessed in the latter group. Intake was compared with Australian Nutritional Recommendations and the Australian population data. RESULTS: Nutritional intake was similar between groups. Of macronutrients, only starch intake fell over 12 months (26% to 23%, P = 0.04). Fibre intake was inadequate for all except in diet-experienced men. More than one in 10 of both newly-diagnosed and experienced women had inadequate thiamin, folate, vitamin A, magnesium, calcium and iron intakes. More than one in 10 newly-diagnosed men had inadequate thiamin, folate, magnesium, calcium and zinc intakes. Inadequate intake did not relate to nutrient density of the GFD. Inadequacies of folate, calcium, iron and zinc occurred more frequently than in the Australian population. The frequency of inadequacies was similar pre- and post-diagnosis, except for thiamin and vitamin A, where inadequacies were more common after GFD implementation. CONCLUSIONS: Dietary intake patterns at 12 months on a GFD are similar to longer-term intake. Dietary inadequacies are common and may relate to habitual poor food choices in addition to inherent deficiencies in the GFD. Dietary education should also address the achievement of adequate micronutrient intake. Fortification of GF foods also need to be considered.},

   abstract = {BACKGROUND: Celiac disease is the most common hereditary autoimmune disease in humans. The only treatment option for non-refractory celiac disease patients is adherence to a strict life-long gluten-free diet, which often fails to normalize small bowel histology. ALV003 is a mixture of two proteases that degrades gluten and is in clinical development as an oral therapy for patients with celiac disease. AIMS: The safety, tolerability, and activity of ALV003 were assessed in two phase 1 clinical trials. METHODS: In study 1 (N = 28) the study drug was administered in the fasted state; in study 2 (N = 53) the study drug was administered together with a gluten-containing meal. Both studies were single-dose, single-blind, placebo-controlled, cross-over trials. ALV003 was dosed at escalating dose levels by cohort (100, 300, 900, and 1,800 mg) and gastric samples were aspirated using a nasogastric tube. Adverse events, serum drug levels, and anti-drug antibody titers were measured. Gastric samples were assessed for ALV003 enzymatic activity over time (gastric pharmacokinetics) and gluten degradation (gastric pharmacodynamics). RESULTS: All doses were well tolerated, and no serious adverse events or allergic reactions were observed. Gastric aspirates collected 30 min following a meal showed that 100 and 300 mg ALV003 degraded 75 +/- 10% (N = 8) and 88 +/- 5% (N = 8), respectively, of one gram of wheat bread gluten. CONCLUSIONS: ALV003 is an orally active protease that appears to be stable in the fed stomach and degrades dietary gluten in this compartment. Single doses of oral ALV003 were not associated with serious adverse reactions.},

Fasting blood glucose was maintained at 4.0-5.0 mmol/l. At 16 months after diagnosis the fasting blood glucose was 4.1 mmol/l and after 20 months he is still without daily insulin therapy.

   abstract = {INTRODUCTION: Diversifying food during the first year of life is an extremely important step for the adequate nutritional status of infants and their physical and psychological development, functioning as a means of transition from lactation to feed the family. Despite the introduction of food diversification is a necessary step for human development, some issues still exist today, not only for the initiation but also in relation to the proper sequence for the various types of food, causing different perspectives and ways of acting on part of clinicians. OBJECTIVES: To determine the best time for the start of food diversification and the best time to introduce certain foods. METHODS: Bibliographic search of the literature in English and Portuguese, from January 2004 to May 2010 through Medline / Pubmed sites and Evidence Based Medicine. Twenty-five of fifty-eight articles were selected, given the full availability of publications and relevance to the topic. RESULTS: The food diversification should never start before 17 or after 2 6 weeks. There is no current evidence that delaying the introduction of any antigen after six months reduces the risk of food allergy, asthma, allergic rhinitis and eczema, even if there is family history of allergy. It is prudent to avoid the introduction of both prior (less than four months) and late (more than seven months) of gluten and a gradual introduction will reduce the risk of celiac disease, type 1 diabetes and allergy to it. The introduction of fish at one year of age reduces the risk of allergic diseases at age four at the immunological benefits of its early introduction outweigh the risks of sensitization to its antigens. CONCLUSIONS: It is important that the onset of food diversification and the introduction of antigens is performed within a specified time interval. It is crucial to implement a healthy diet for the whole family, to the extent that children learn by example.},

   abstract = {OBJECTIVE: To determine the benefits of screening for celiac autoimmunity via immunoglobulin A transglutaminase autoantibodies (TG) in children with type 1 diabetes (T1D). STUDY DESIGN: We followed up 79 screening-identified TG+ and 56 matched TG- children with T1D for 2 years to evaluate growth, bone mineral density, nutritional status, and diabetes control. TG+ subjects self-selected to gluten-free or gluten-containing diet. RESULTS: Of the initial cohort, 80% were available for reexamination after 2 years. TG+ subjects had consistently lower weight z-scores and higher urine N-telopeptides than TG- subjects, but similar measures of bone density and diabetes outcomes. TG+ children who remained on a gluten-containing diet had lower insulin-like growth factor binding protein 3 z-scores compared with TG+ subjects who reported following a gluten-free diet. Children who continued with high TG index throughout the study had lower bone mineral density z-scores, ferritin, and vitamin D 25OH levels, compared with the TG- group. CONCLUSIONS: No significant adverse outcomes were identified in children with T1D with screening-identified TG+ who delay therapy with a gluten-free diet for 2 years. Children with persistently high levels of TG may be at greater risk. The optimal timing of screening and treatment for celiac disease in children with T1D requires further investigation.},

   abstract = {BACKGROUND: Adults with type 1 diabetes (T1D) have decreased bone mineral density (BMD) and increased fracture risk, yet the etiologies remain elusive. Early detection of derangements in bone biomarkers during adolescence could lead to timely recognition. In adolescents with T1D, we evaluated the relationships between metabolic control, BMD, and bone anabolic and turnover markers. METHODS: Cross-sectional study of 57 adolescent subjects with T1D who had HbA1c consistently >/= 9% (Poor Control, PC n = 27) or < 9% (Favorable Control, FC n = 30) for two years prior to enrollment. Subjects had T1DM for at least three years and were without diabetes complications, known celiac disease, or other chronic diseases. RESULTS: There were no differences between HbA1c groups in BMD, components of the IGF system, or 25-hydroxyvitamin D status. The prevalence of 25-hydroxyvitamin D abnormalities was similar to that seen in the general adolescent population. Few patients met the recommended dietary allowance (RDA) for vitamin D or calcium. CONCLUSIONS: These data provide no evidence of association between degree of metabolic control and BMD in adolescents with T1D. Adolescents with T1D have a high prevalence of serum 25-hydroxyvitamin D abnormalities. Longitudinal studies are needed to evaluate the predictive value of vitamin D abnormalities on fracture risk.},

The cost and availability of a gluten-free diet has been cited as a cause of incomplete dietary compliance; however, this has not been extensively investigated. The aim was to investigate the availability and cost of gluten-free foods across a wide range of stores. METHODS: The availability and cost of 20 foods (both wheat-based and everyday foods) was surveyed at 30 different stores across five different store categories. For each of the 20 foods, four products were selected (branded gluten-free, cheapest gluten-free, branded standard, cheapest standard) resulting in sampling of up to 80 products in each of the 30 stores. RESULTS: In general, there was limited availability of gluten-free foods, with an average of 8.2 of the 20 (41%) foods being available in a gluten-free version per store. Regular supermarkets had a greater availability (18.0/20, 90%), whereas budget supermarkets (1.8/20, 9%) and corner shops (1.8/20, 9%) had almost no gluten-free versions (P < 0.001). All 10 gluten-free versions of wheat-based foods were more costly than their standard counterparts (76-518% more expensive; P < 0.001). Some gluten-free versions of everyday foods were also more costly than standard counterparts (2-124%). CONCLUSIONS: There is limited availability of gluten-free foods and they are generally more expensive than their standard counterparts. This may impact on compliance to a gluten-free diet, with potential nutritional and clinical consequences, together with an increased risk of complications.},

   abstract = {BACKGROUND: Patients with psoriasis who had raised IgG and/or IgA antigliadin antibodies showed clinical improvement in a trial with a gluten-free diet. The selection of patients for the diet treatment was based on the presence of specific antibodies, i.e. the result of humoral immunity. OBJECTIVES: As psoriasis is now considered to be a T cell-mediated disease we decided to challenge peripheral blood mononuclear cells (PBMCs) in vitro from randomly selected patients with well-defined wheat proteins/peptides to explore the possibility of identifying a specific antigen with T cell activating properties in a subgroup of patients. METHODS: PBMCs from 37 patients (20 female and 17 male; mean age 49years) and 37 healthy controls (12 female and 25 male; mean age 57years) were included. Not all patients participated in all experiments. The PBMCs were exposed in vitro with the following wheat proteins/peptides in various concentrations: total albumins, 0.28 alpha-amylase inhibitor and the synthetic peptides, p31-43, p57-68 and p62-75, based on coeliac-active sequences of alpha-gliadin. The proliferative response was measured as counts per minute after the cells had been pulsed with methyl-(3) H-thymidine. RESULTS: Albumin, alpha-amylase inhibitor, p31-43 and p57-68 elicited a significant response in both patients and controls but showed no differences between the groups. The response induced by the alpha-amylase inhibitor was higher than that induced by the albumin fraction and the p31-43 and p57-68 peptides. At a concentration of 25mugmL(-1) , five of 36 patients with psoriasis responded positively to the p62-75 peptide and none of the 33 controls, using a stimulation index of 2.4 as the cut-off level (P<0.05). These five patients did not show clinical features that differed from the remaining patients. Among the responding patients the relative number of CD4+ cells increased in some but not all after in vitro challenge with the albumins, 0.28 alpha-amylase inhibitor, and p62-75. These antigens could also induce in vitro the expression of the homing antigen cutaneous lymphocyte antigen (CLA) in a few patients and controls. CONCLUSIONS: The wheat protein antigens, especially the p62-75 peptide, might be of interest in a subgroup of patients with psoriasis.},

   abstract = {Adverse reactions to foods are classified according to the presence or absence of involvement of the immune system, which may or may not include the production of immunoglobulin E (IgE) antibodies. This review focuses on the epidemiology, diagnosis, and management of adverse food reactions, primarily in adults, and excluding celiac disease and lactose intolerance. Reported reactions to foods are often believed to be manifestations of a food allergy; however, IgE-mediated food allergy only affects 1% to 4% of adults, with seafood, tree nuts, peanuts, fruits, and vegetables being the most common triggers. Diagnosis is challenging and most commonly achieved through careful evaluation of clinical history followed by elimination and reintroduction or challenge with the suspected offending food. With acute-onset allergic reactions, estimation of food-specific IgE antibodies is frequently used to confirm or refute the diagnosis. Recent developments, such as single allergen assays, enhance the diagnosis of IgE-mediated food allergy, but the gold standard remains oral food challenge. Despite recent advances in the management of food allergy, including the promotion of oral tolerance, the mainstay of management is still the avoidance of food triggers. Dietary management can be compromised by nutritional inadequacy, accidental exposure, food labeling, and quality of life or adherence issues. It is essential that adults with confirmed food allergy receive optimal nutrition and dietetic support to enable them to manage their condition.},

   abstract = {UNLABELLED: Carob germ proteins have been shown to have functional properties similar to wheat gluten enabling formulation and production of yeast leavened gluten-free baked goods from a true dough rather than a stiff batter. The purpose of this research was to optimize the production of wheat-free bread containing carob germ flour, corn starch, NaCl, sucrose, hydroxypropyl methylcellulose (HPMC), and H(2)O. A key criterion was to formulate viscoelastic dough similar to wheat dough. To that end, response surface methodology (RSM) was used to determine optimal levels of carob germ flour, H(2)O, and HPMC. Components varied as follows: 4.94%-15.05% for carob germ flour, 0.05%-3.75% HPMC, and 65.25%-83.75% H(2)O (percents are on a flour basis, where carob germ flour in combination with maize starch equals 100%). Sucrose, NaCl, and yeast were held constant at 2%. Bread parameters evaluated were specific volume and crumb hardness, where the largest specific volume and the lowest value for crumb hardness were considered most desirable. The optimum formula as determined by RSM consisted of 7% carob germ flour, 93% maize starch, 2% HPMC, and 80% H(2)O with predicted crumb hardness of ~200 g of force and a specific volume of ~3.5 cm(3)/g. When proof time was optimized, a specific volume of ~5.6 ml/g and crumb hardness value of ~156 g of force was observed. Carob germ flour may be used as an alternative to wheat flour in formulating viscoelastic dough and high quality gluten-free bread. PRACTICAL APPLICATION: Celiac disease affects approximately 1% of the world's population. Sufferers of the disease must consume a gluten-free diet. Currently, gluten-free baked products are made from batters and lack the ability to be made from dough based systems which limits the overall processability and product variety. This research is aimed at the utilization of carob germ protein and its ability to form dough to produce an optimal gluten-free bread formulation. This will help to alleviate problems in processability and product variety associated with gluten-free baked goods.},

Although celiac disease can be managed by strict adherence to a gluten-free diet, dietary management can be challenging. A descriptive, correlational design was used to examine factors and perceived causes that interfere with adherence to a gluten-free diet, identify coping strategies, and examine the relationship between coping strategies and quality of life in 156 adults with a diagnosis of celiac disease. The Psychological General Well-Being Index and the Brief COPE were used to measure the major variables. Results indicated that problems outside the home interfere with dietary adherence. A moderate negative significant relationship (r [154] = -.46, p < .01) was found between quality of life and stress, with 54% of participants reporting a minimal amount of stress. Emotion-focused coping was found to have a significant negative effect on quality of life (H[18] = 56.67, p < .001). Implications for future research should include investigation of cognitive behavioral interventions to decrease the negative effects of stress on quality of life for adults with celiac disease adhering to a gluten-free diet.},

   abstract = {Gluten exclusion (protein complex present in many cereals) has been proposed as an option for the prevention of diseases other than coeliac disease. However, the effects of gluten-free diets on obesity and its mechanisms of action have not been studied. Thus, our objective was to assess whether gluten exclusion can prevent adipose tissue expansion and its consequences. C57BL/6 mice were fed a high-fat diet containing 4.5% gluten (Control) or no gluten (GF). Body weight and adiposity gains, leukocyte rolling and adhesion, macrophage infiltration and cytokine production in adipose tissue were assessed. Blood lipid profiles, glycaemia, insulin resistance and adipokines were measured. Expression of the PPAR-alpha and gamma, lipoprotein lipase (LPL), hormone sensitive lipase (HSL), carnitine palmitoyl acyltransferase-1 (CPT-1), insulin receptor, GLUT-4 and adipokines were assessed in epidydimal fat. Gluten-free animals showed a reduction in body weight gain and adiposity, without changes in food intake or lipid excretion. These results were associated with up-regulation of PPAR-alpha, LPL, HSL and CPT-1, which are related to lipolysis and fatty acid oxidation. There was an improvement in glucose homeostasis and pro-inflammatory profile-related overexpression of PPAR-gamma. Moreover, intravital microscopy showed a lower number of adhered cells in the adipose tissue microvasculature. The overexpression of PPAR-gamma is related to the increase of adiponectin and GLUT-4. Our data support the beneficial effects of gluten-free diets in reducing adiposity gain, inflammation and insulin resistance. The data suggests that diet gluten exclusion should be tested as a new dietary approach to prevent the development of obesity and metabolic disorders.},

   abstract = {Coeliac disease is a widespread, lifelong disorder for which dietary control represents the only accepted form of therapy. There is an unmet need for nondietary therapies to treat this condition. Most ongoing and emerging drug-discovery programmes are based on the understanding that coeliac disease is caused by an inappropriate T-cell-mediated immune response to dietary gluten proteins. Recent genome-wide association studies lend further support to this pathogenic model. The central role of human leucocyte antigen genes has been validated, and a number of new risk loci have been identified, most of which are related to the biology of T cells and antigen-presenting cells. Here, we review the status of potential nondietary therapies under consideration for coeliac disease. We conclude that future development of novel therapies will be aided considerably by the identification of new, preferably noninvasive, surrogate markers for coeliac disease activity.},

   abstract = {Coeliac disease (CD) remains under diagnosed with only 10-20% of patients identified. Genes encoding HLA DQ2 or DQ8 are found in the vast majority of those with CD and testing for their presence can be useful to rule out the possibility CD. CD is more common in certain ethnic groups including those of North Indian origin. The classical presentation tends to occur in younger children, while atypical presentations occur at an older age. The number of children being diagnosed with CD is increasing; this may be due to greater recognition of the more atypical presentations, improved serologic tests, and the screening of asymptomatic groups at increased risk, but may also be due to an overall increased prevalence. Although serologic testing has become more reliable, there still remain significant problems around testing, particularly in those <18 months of age. All children should undergo a duodenal biopsy on a gluten containing diet in order to diagnose CD before recommending a gluten-free diet (GFD). A GFD should be offered to all children diagnosed with CD even when perceived as asymptomatic, as there is significant morbidity associated with CD later in life.},

   abstract = {The celiac disease is an autoimmune gastrointestinal disorder caused by gluten from wheat, rye or barley. In genetically predisposed persons, gluten induces the immune-mediated inflammation of small intestinal mucosa. Histological lesions include intraepithelial lymphocytosis, crypt hypertrophy and villous atrophy, resulting in malabsorption of micro- and macronutrients. The only treatment for celiac patients is a permanent gluten-free diet (GFD). Reactive oxygen species (ROS) and oxidative stress are strongly associated with the celiac disease. Glutathione (GSH) is a main detoxifier of endogenous and exogenous ROS in the intestine. In order to explain the role of glutathione redox cycle in celiac patients, we examined the activities of GSH-related antioxidant (AO) enzymes glutathione peroxidase (GPx) and glutathione reductase (GR), as well as the concentration of GSH in small intestinal biopsies and peripheral blood of children affected by the celiac disease. The concentration of lipid hydroperoxides (LOOH) as markers of oxidative damage was measured in the same samples. The results clearly demonstrate a significant malfunction of GSH redox cycle with a concomitant decrease in the capacity to regenerate GSH and detoxify LOOH in celiac patients, even after several years of GFD. The oral administration of GSH and a diet rich in natural antioxidants, as well as appropriate dietary supplements, could be of great benefit to the patients.},

   abstract = {BACKGROUND: Despite the advent of sensitive testing to detect celiac disease (CD), screening in type 1 diabetes (T1D) remains controversial. Many diabetes clinics are apprehensive about the prospect of introducing a second illness requiring intensive lifestyle changes in patients and families already managing a chronic condition, especially in asymptomatic patients. OBJECTIVE: To determine the impact of managing CD + T1D on quality of life in families, with attention to the effect of adherence with a gluten-free diet (GFD) and metabolic control. PATIENTS AND METHODS: Cross-sectional assessment using a validated self-reported quality of life measure: 28 children with biopsy-proven CD + T1D were compared with 40 subjects with T1D aged 8-18 yr. Parental and child reports were assessed as well as symptoms at the time of CD diagnosis and adherence with a GFD at the quality of life assessment. RESULTS: No significant differences in quality of life were observed between subjects with established CD + T1D and subjects with T1D alone. Parents of children with CD + T1D reported lower social functioning scores than parents of children with T1D (p = 0.03). In the CD + T1D group no differences in quality of life were observed with regard to age at CD diagnosis, CD duration, or on the basis of adherence with a GFD. CONCLUSIONS: The additional diagnosis of CD has minimal impact on quality of life in children with T1D; however, parents of CD + T1D children did express greater concern about their child's social functioning.},

This study aims to develop hypoallergenic pasta using blends of Triticum durum semolina, 40% of other non-wheat flours and additives. Formulated pasta samples were evaluated for product quality characteristics and also subjected to biochemical analysis. Results showed that cooking loss ranged from 6.9% to 7.4%, which were within the acceptable range of 8%. Color change was low and in vitro protein digestibility of the pasta was found to be insignificant. Pasting characteristics of the hypoallergenic flour showed the increased peak viscosity and decreased gelatinization temperature. The scanning electron microscopy results demonstrated less-affected microstructure of gluten network. Texture profile analysis and descriptive sensory analysis revealed that optimized hypoallergenic pasta with xanthan gum as additive was acceptable and comparable with control. SDS-PAGE pattern showed distinct protein profile and decreased intensity, which was supported by Dot-Blot. In conclusion, the hypoallergenic pasta prepared by replacing T durum flour by 40% of other non-gluten flours could be useful for celiac patients because of its low antigenic activity.},

   abstract = {INTRODUCTION: Calcium and vitamin D malabsorption in coeliac disease (CD) predispose to skeletal demineralisation. The aim of this study was to evaluate the prevalence of bone mineral density (BMD) and calcium deficiencies in adult patients with CD and assess whether a gluten-free diet is sufficiently effective for BMD restoration. MATERIAL AND METHODS: BMD and biochemical parameters of bone and mineral metabolism were measured in 35 adult CD patients receiving (19) or not receiving (16) a gluten-free diet (GFD) and in 36 controls. Then the CD patients were treated with a GFD and calcium (1.0 g/day) plus alfacalcidol (0.25-1 mug/day) for one year. RESULTS: Reduced BMD was diagnosed in 57-77% of the patients. Mean calcaemia, calciuria, and 25(OH) vitamin D were lower, but serum PTH and bone-turnover markers (ALP, osteocalcin, ICTP) were significantly higher in the CD patients than in the controls. In the patients on the diet (GFD(+)), BMD was higher than in the GFD(-) patients, but lower than in the controls. The biochemical parameters were normal in the GFD(+) patients except for diminished calciuria. Mean BMD after one year of treatment significantly increased (p < 0.05), mostly in the lumbar spine (mean: 7.3%), but decreased in five patients who did not strictly adhere to the GFD. CONCLUSIONS: Deficiencies in calcium, vitamin D, and BMD are very common in adult CD patients. Gluten avoidance increased BMD, although the values remained markedly lower in several patients. Because of chronic calcium deficiency despite GFD, calcium and vitamin D supplementation in most adult CD patients is proposed.},

   abstract = {BACKGROUND: Refractory coeliac disease type I is a complicated form of coeliac disease characterised by primary or secondary resistance to a gluten-free diet with persisting or reoccurring intestinal villous atrophy and symptoms of malabsorption. Besides corticosteroids, azathioprine has been advocated for the treatment of refractory coeliac disease type I. However, tioguanine (TG) might be better tolerated and more efficacious owing to a simpler metabolism towards bioactivation. AIM: To evaluate tolerability and effectiveness of the nonconventional thiopurine derivative TG in refractory coeliac disease type I. METHODS: Refractory coeliac disease type I patients treated with TG between June 2001 and November 2010 with a follow-up period of at least 1 year were included. Adverse events, laboratory values, 6-thioguanine nucleotide concentrations and rates of both clinical and histological response were evaluated at baseline and during follow-up. RESULTS: Twelve adult refractory coeliac disease type I patients were included. The median TG treatment duration was 14 months. Ten patients tolerated TG treatment on the long term, whereas two patients withdrew treatment due to adverse events. No nodular regenerative hyperplasia of the liver was observed. During follow-up clinical and histological response was observed in 83% and 78%, respectively. Corticosteroid dependency decreased by 50%. CONCLUSION: Tioguanine appears to be a convenient drug for the treatment of refractory coeliac disease type I based on higher histological and similar clinical response rates as compared with historical conventional therapies.},

METHODS: We set out to investigate the potential use of novel serum parameters, including IL-6, IL-8, IL-17, IL-22, sCD25, sCD27, granzyme-B, sMICA and sCTLA-4 in patients diagnosed with active CD, CD on a GFD, Refractory coeliac disease (RCD) type I and II, and enteropathy associated T-cell lymphoma (EATL). RESULTS: In both active CD and RCDI-II elevated levels of the proinflammatory IL-8, IL-17 and sCD25 were observed. In addition, RCDII patients displayed higher serum levels of soluble granzyme-B and IL-6 in comparison to active CD patients. In contrast, no differences between RCDI and active CD or RCDII were observed. Furthermore, EATL patients displayed higher levels of IL-6 as compared to all other groups. CONCLUSIONS: A series of novel serum parameters reveal distinctive immunological characteristics of RCDII and EATL in comparison to uncomplicated CD and RCDI.},

OBJECTIVE: To determine the effect of CD on growth and glycemic control in patients with T1D, and the effects of adherence to gluten-free diet (GFD) on these parameters. PATIENTS AND METHODS: A longitudinal retrospective case-control design was used. The medical files of 68 patients with T1D and duodenal-biopsy-confirmed CD were reviewed for data on weight, height, hemoglobin A1c (HbA1c), frequency of diabetic ketoacidosis (DKA), and severe hypoglycemic events before and after diagnosis and treatment of CD. Findings were compared with 131 patients with T1D only matched for age, gender, and duration of diabetes. RESULTS: CD was diagnosed in 5.5% of all patients with T1D attending our center during the study period; 26% of the patients with CD were symptomatic. There were no significant differences in glycemic control or frequency of severe hypoglycemia or DKA events between the study and control groups. Body mass index-standard deviation score (SDS), height-SDS, and HbA1c values were marginally but not significantly higher in the control than the study group and similar in subjects with CD with good or fair/poor adherence to a GFD throughout follow-up. CONCLUSIONS: Patients with T1D and CD treated with GFD have growth and measures of metabolic control similar to those with T1D without CD. The decision whether asymptomatic celiac patients should be put on a GFD or only symptomatic patients has to be weighed against possible short- and long-term consequences of no intervention, and should be based on more evidence from larger randomized studies.},

   abstract = {OBJECTIVES: Celiac disease (CD) is common and often cited as an "iceberg" phenomenon (i.e., an assumed large number of undiagnosed cases). Recently, atypical or asymptomatic manifestations are becoming more commonly described in older children and adolescents. Moreover, CD diagnosis in children can be complicated by several factors, including its diverse clinical presentations, delay in recognizing CD signs and symptoms, and premature dietary gluten avoidance before the formal diagnosis of CD. To date, few studies have directly examined age-related differences in clinical characteristics and gluten-related issues among children with CD. The aim of this study was to determine age-related patterns in clinical characteristics and gluten-related issues among children with confirmed CD. METHODS: We performed a structured medical record review of biopsy-proven CD patients, aged 0-19 years, between 2000 and 2010 at a large Boston teaching hospital. Data collection included demographics, medical history, gluten-related issues, and diagnostic investigations (CD-specific serology, upper gastrointestinal endoscopy, and small intestinal biopsy). The first positive duodenal biopsy with Marsh III classification defined age of diagnosis. Patients were divided into three age groups for comparisons of the aforementioned characteristics: infant-preschool group (0-5 years), school-aged group (6-11 years), and adolescence group (12-19 years). RESULTS: Among 411 children with biopsy-proven CD, the mean age was 9.5 (s.d. 5.1) years. Most were female (63%) and white (96%). All children had positive CD-specific serology. Most children presented with either abdominal complaints or bowel movement changes. Overall, boys were more common among infant-preschool group compared with the other age groups. More distinct clinical manifestations (vomiting, bowel movement changes, and weight issues) were apparent in the youngest group, whereas school-aged children had more subjective abdominal complaints at the initial presentation. Conversely, the adolescents were most likely to present without any gastrointestinal (GI) symptoms, but not when this was combined with absence of weight issues. Age of diagnosis was not associated with atypical extraintestinal CD presentations. Regarding the gluten-related issues, 10% of school-aged children avoided dietary gluten before the formal CD diagnosis, and 27% of the adolescents reported dietary gluten transgression within the first 12 months of diagnosis, significantly higher than the other age groups. Age differences in histopathology were also found. Whereas the infant-preschool group had a higher proportion of total villous atrophy, the older children were more likely to have gross duodenal abnormalities and chronic duodenitis suggestive of CD at the time of diagnosis. CONCLUSIONS: Children and adolescents with CD have age-related patterns in both the clinical presentations and gluten-related issues. More pronounced clinical and histological features were determined in younger children, whereas older children more commonly presented with solely subjective abdominal complaints or even without any GI symptoms. However, silent and atypical extraintestinal CD presentations were comparable between age groups. In addition to the aforementioned presentations, the higher rates of dietary gluten avoidance and transgression in older children make CD diagnosis and management particularly challenging. These age-related patterns may further increase awareness, facilitate early diagnosis, and improve patient care of pediatric CD.},

   abstract = {OBJECTIVES: To determine independent predictors of gluten avoidance and of a physician's decision to initiate a gluten-free diet (GFD) in children and adolescents without confirmed celiac disease. STUDY DESIGN: We performed a structured medical record review of 579 patients aged 1-19 years presenting for evaluation of celiac disease between January 2000 and December 2010 at a large Boston teaching hospital. We collected data including demographic information, medical history, serology, small intestinal biopsy, history of gluten avoidance, and the postworkup recommendation of implementation of a GFD. Predictors of gluten-related issues were identified by multivariate logistic regression. RESULTS: Among 579 children without a previous diagnosis of celiac disease (mean age, 8.7 years), 43 (7.4%) had ever avoided gluten. Independent predictors of gluten avoidance were irritability or poor temper (OR, 3.2), diarrhea (OR, 2.5), weight issues (OR, 0.4), pervasive developmental disorder (OR, 5.3), and family history of celiac disease (OR, 2.2). Among 143 children without confirmed celiac disease who underwent diagnostic evaluation, several predictive factors were associated with a physician- recommended/parent-initiated GFD: irritability (OR, 6.4), diarrhea (OR, 3.4), pervasive developmental disorder (OR, 7.9), and positive serology before the referral (OR, 4.3). CONCLUSION: Gluten avoidance among children and adolescents without a previous diagnosis of celiac disease is relatively common. The identified predictors suggest that gluten avoidance is associated with nonspecific behavioral and gastrointestinal complaints and perhaps with the perceived dietary responses in another family member thought to have celiac disease.},

   abstract = {OBJECTIVES: Although gluten avoidance is thought to be common among New Zealanders, the prevalence of gluten avoidance and of actual coeliac disease (CD) in children is uncertain. Our aims were: (1) to determine the prevalence of doctor-diagnosed CD and of gluten avoidance in New Zealand children; and (2) among children without CD, to identify independent predictors of gluten avoidance. DESIGN: The New Zealand Asthma and Allergy Cohort Study has detailed information on participants' demographic, pregnancy-related and neonatal factors. The authors surveyed parents regarding their child's history of lactose intolerance and gluten-related issues (eg, gluten avoidance, history of wheat or gluten allergy in first degree relatives, testing and doctor diagnosis of CD). After excluding children with doctor-diagnosed CD, the authors identified independent predictors of gluten avoidance. RESULTS: Among 916 children, most (78%) were of European ethnicity. The authors identified nine (1.0%, 95% CI 0.5% to 1.9%) who had doctor-diagnosed CD, while 48 (5.2%, 95% CI 4.0% to 6.9%) avoided gluten. Among children without diagnosed CD, significant independent predictors for gluten avoidance were Christchurch site (OR 2.2, 95% CI 1.02 to 4.7), prior testing for CD (OR 9.0, 95% CI 4.1 to 19.5) and doctor-diagnosed lactose intolerance (OR 5.2, 95% CI 2.0 to 13.9). CONCLUSIONS: CD affected 1% of these New Zealand children, but 5% reported gluten avoidance. The predictors of gluten avoidance in children without doctor-diagnosed CD suggest important regional differences in community belief or medical practice regarding implementation of gluten avoidance and the contributory role of non-specific subjective abdominal complaints.},

   abstract = {BACKGROUND: The objective of this study was to prospectively determine the prevalence of asymptomatic celiac disease among children presenting with fibromyalgia. The secondary objective was to investigate if their symptoms resolved on a gluten free diet. FINDINGS: All children seen in the Amplified Musculoskeletal Pain clinic between the ages of 12 and 17 years of age who fulfilled the 1990 American College of Rheumatology diagnostic criteria for fibromyalgia were invited to participate. A total immunoglobulin A (IgA) level, IgA antiendomysial (EMA) and IgA anti-TTG antibodies was obtained on all study subjects. A visual analog scale for pain and a functional disability inventory were obtained on all patients. If a patient had elevated EMA or TTG a small bowel biopsy was done. Patients with celiac disease were placed on a gluten-free diet and observed to see if their symptoms resolved.50 patients, 45 females, completed the study. Only one patient was found to have celiac disease. On a gluten-free diet her tissue transglutaminase antibody level returned to normal but her visual analog scale scores increased and her functional disability inventory was 40 initially and 21 at follow up. CONCLUSIONS: In this pilot, single center study at a tertiary children's hospital patients with fibromyalgia do not seem to have occult celiac disease at an increased rate over the population as a whole.},

   abstract = {BACKGROUND: Coeliac disease (CD) is an under-diagnosed and often misunderstood disease, yet is one of the most common food intolerance disorders. The only treatment available to prevent the health impacts of CD is a lifelong, strict gluten-free diet (GFD). There are few studies that explore the experiences of diagnosis and the everyday experiences of living with this chronic condition. METHODS: Utilising a qualitative study design, and purposive sampling, the present study describes the experiences of 10 women with coeliac disease in Victoria, Australia. Individual interviews were conducted with women aged between 31 and 60 years who had been diagnosed with CD for at least 2 years. RESULTS: A thematic analysis of the interview transcripts highlighted a number of issues for those living with the disease. Reactions to diagnosis, transition to a GFD and the changes needed to live with CD are discussed. CONCLUSIONS: A range of recommendations including the need to increase CD awareness and education and further research on the impacts of living with the disease are made.},

   abstract = {Idiopathic pulmonary hemosiderosis is a severe and potentially fatal disease characterized by recurrent episodes of alveolar hemorrhage, hemoptysis, and anemia. His association with celiac disease, described as Lane- Hamilton syndrome, could be due to the fact that both entities share a common pathogenic immune pathway. We report two patients of 13 years who consulted for hemoptysis and severe anemia that had not responded to immunosuppressive treatment with pulses of methyl prednisolone, oral meprednisone and hydroxychloroquine. Although both children highlight the absence of gastrointestinal symptoms at the time of consultation, the dosage of anti-endomysial and anti-transglutaminase antibodies was positive and biopsy confirmed the presence of intestinal enteropathy. It is emphasized that in patients with diffuse alveolar hemorrhage, even in the absence of gastrointestinal symptoms, the concomitant presence of celiac disease should be evaluated. If celiac disease is present, the incorporation of a gluten-free diet helps to control the symptoms, allows reducing the immunosuppressive treatment and improves the clinical course of both entities.},

   abstract = {In refractory celiac disease (RCD), intestinal epithelial damage persists despite a gluten-free diet. Characteristic for RCD type II (RCD II) is the presence of aberrant surface TCR-CD3(-) intraepithelial lymphocytes (IELs) that can progressively replace normal IELs and eventually give rise to overt lymphoma. Therefore, RCD II is considered a malignant condition that forms an intermediate stage between celiac disease (CD) and overt lymphoma. We demonstrate in this study that surface TCR-CD3(-) IEL lines isolated from three RCD II patients preferentially lyse epithelial cell lines. FACS analysis revealed that DNAM-1 was strongly expressed on the three RCD cell lines, whereas other activating NK cell receptors were not expressed on all three RCD cell lines. Consistent with this finding, cytotoxicity of the RCD cell lines was mediated mainly by DNAM-1 with only a minor role for other activating NK cell receptors. Furthermore, enterocytes isolated from duodenal biopsies expressed DNAM-1 ligands and were lysed by the RCD cell lines ex vivo. Although DNAM-1 on CD8(+) T cells and NK cells is known to mediate lysis of tumor cells, this study provides, to our knowledge, the first evidence that (pre)malignant cells themselves can acquire the ability to lyse epithelial cells via DNAM-1. This study confirms previous work on epithelial lysis by RCD cell lines and identifies a novel mechanism that potentially contributes to the gluten-independent tissue damage in RCD II and RCD-associated lymphoma.},

   abstract = {From the time of Gee's landmark writings, the recent history of celiac disease (CD) can be divided into many ages, each driven by a diagnostic advance and a deeper knowledge of disease pathogenesis. At the same time, these advances were paralleled by the identification of new clinical patterns associated with CD and by a continuous redefinition of the prevalence of the disease in population. In the beginning, CD was considered a chronic indigestion, even if the causative food was not known; later, the disease was proven to depend on an intolerance to wheat gliadin, leading to typical mucosal changes in the gut and to a malabsorption syndrome. This knowledge led to curing the disease with a gluten-free diet. After the identification of antibodies to gluten (AGA) in the serum of patients and the identification of gluten-specific lymphocytes in the mucosa, CD was described as an immune disorder, resembling a chronic "gluten infection". The use of serological testing for AGA allowed identification of the higher prevalence of this disorder, revealing atypical patterns of presentation. More recently, the characterization of autoantibodies to endomysium and to transglutaminase shifted the attention to a complex autoimmune pathogenesis and to the increased risk of developing autoimmune disorders in untreated CD. New diagnostic assays, based on molecular technologies, will introduce new changes, with the promise of better defining the spectrum of gluten reactivity and the real burden of gluten related-disorders in the population. Herein, we describe the different periods of CD experience, and further developments for the next celiac age will be proposed.},

   abstract = {OBJECTIVES: Diagnosis of celiac disease is difficult when treatment with gluten-free diet (GFD) is started before diagnosis and/or when the results of tests are inconsistent. The objective of this study was to evaluate the in vitro gliadin challenge. METHODS: The study cohort included patients without celiac disease (negative controls, n=57), patients with celiac disease (positive controls, n=166 untreated and n=55 on GFD), and patients with difficult diagnosis (n=59). All patients underwent endoscopy for collection of duodenal samples, which served for the diagnosis of celiac disease and for the in vitro evaluation of the gliadin-induced mucosal expression of seven inflammatory markers: PY99, ICAM-1 (intercellular cell adhesion molecule), HLA-DR, CD3, CD25, CD69, and transglutaminase 2 IgA. Diagnostic work-up for celiac disease included the search of specific serum antibodies. Patients of the difficult diagnosis group were asked to stop GFD for repeated search of these antibodies under untreated conditions. The area under the receptor-operated curve (ROC) was used for statistical analyses on accuracy. RESULTS: HLA-DR had the highest accuracy for celiac disease diagnosis in analyses on negative controls and positive controls also excluding patients on GFD (area under ROC=0.99). Accuracy of test did not increase combining data of HLA-DR with data of other markers. Findings were similar in the 39 patients of the difficult diagnosis group undergoing the search celiac disease-specific antibodies under untreated conditions. CONCLUSIONS: The in vitro response of mucosal HLA-DR to gliadin is an accurate tool for the diagnosis of celiac disease also in patients with difficult diagnosis.},

   abstract = {BACKGROUND & AIMS: The presence of celiac disease-associated autoantibodies (antiendomysium and antitissue transglutaminase [anti-TG2]) with normal jejunal mucosa indicate potential celiac disease. We performed a prospective, 3-year cohort study to determine the natural history of potential celiac disease in children. METHODS: The study included 106 children with potential celiac disease, based on serology analysis and normal duodenal architecture. All but 2 carried the HLA-DQ2 and/or DQ8 haplotype. In all children, every 6 months, growth, nutritional parameters, celiac disease serology, and autoimmunity were investigated. In biopsies, gammadelta intraepithelial-, CD3-, and lamina propria CD25-positive cells were counted; duodenal deposits of anti-TG2 immunoglobulin A were detected. Biopsy analysis was repeated after 2 years on patients with persistent positive serology and/or symptoms. RESULTS: Celiac disease was detected primarily in first-degree relatives and patients with autoimmune disorders (40.6%). A gluten-free diet was prescribed to 20/106 patients because of symptoms, which were relieved in only 11. Eighty-nine of the 106 patients entered the follow-up study, with normal daily consumption of gluten. During the follow-up antibodies disappeared in 14.6% and fluctuated in 32.6%. Villous atrophy was observed in 12/39 patients (30.8%) who underwent a repeat biopsy. CONCLUSIONS: Most children with potential celiac disease remain healthy. After 3 years, approximately 33% of patients develop villous atrophy. Intestinal deposits of anti-TG2 IgA identify children at risk for villous atrophy.},

For the majority of patients, complications are temporary and self limited. Unfortunately few cases of refractory diarrhea have been reported and some of them proved fatal. The mainstay of therapy is aggressive hydration to restore body fluids and early treatment with antidiarrheal agents.

   abstract = {BACKGROUND: Historically weight loss is a classic symptom of Coeliac Disease (CD). Recent studies suggest CD sufferers are significantly more likely to be obese or underweight at the time of presentation. This study aimed to establish the frequency of obesity in newly diagnosed Coeliac Disease (CD). METHODS: Dietetic records of CD patients were reviewed and patient demographics, initial assessment date, and Body Mass Index (BMI) recorded and statistically analysed. RESULTS: out of 187 CD patients diagnosed between 1999 and 2009, 127 patients were female (68%) and 60 male (32%) (ratio 2:1). Overall median age was 54 years (range 18 to 87). Median BMI was 23.6, inter-quartile range (IQR) 21.5 - 28.1. Male median BMI was 23.9, IQR 21.8 - 27.3. Female median BMI was 23.2, IQR 21.4 - 28.6. Overall 83 patients (44%) had a BMI of 25 or above. No significant difference was found in the proportion of patients with a BMI of 25 or above when compared according to gender, age or year of referral. Twenty-five patients (13 %) had a BMI of 30 or above. Twenty were female with a median age of 56 years (range 18 - 71). The proportion of females with a BMI of 30 or more was 11% compared with only 3% males (ratio 5:1). Only 5 patients (3%) had a BMI less than 18.5. CONCLUSION: A significant proportion of CD patients (close to half of patients) were diagnosed with a BMI of 25 or over. Compared to males, females have a wider range of BMI and more likely to be obese (BMI of 30 or more).},

   abstract = {OBJECTIVES: In celiac disease, complete histological normalization of the small-intestinal mucosa occurs in only 8-20% of adult patients after commencing a gluten-free diet. Intraepithelial lymphocytosis may persist for years while villous morphology normalizes. Factors contributing to this and the clinical relevance of persistent intraepithelial lymphocytosis were here investigated. METHODS: Altogether 177 adult celiac disease patients adhering to a long-term strict gluten-free diet were enrolled. Co-morbidities, ongoing medications, and consumption of oats and wheat-starch were recorded. Small-bowel morphology and intraepithelial lymphocyte count as well as laboratory parameters of malabsorption were evaluated. Gastrointestinal symptoms and psychological well-being were measured by structured questionnaires. RESULTS: In all, 170 (96%) out of the 177 patients evinced normal villous architecture and 7 (4%) villous atrophy. Among patients with normal villous structure, 96 (56%) had persistent intraepithelial lymphocytosis and 74 (44%) completely normal small-intestinal mucosa. Consumption of oats was the only factor contributing to the persistent intraepithelial lymphocytosis. Co-morbidities, Helicobacter pylori gastritis, drugs, or wheat-starch in the diet had no effect. The clinical outcome of the patients with persistent intraepithelial lymphocytosis was good, since no signs of malabsorption, excess malignancies, increase in gastrointestinal symptoms, or impaired quality of life were associated with it when compared to subjects with completely normal mucosa. The only outcome found in this study was a significantly lower, although normal villous height-crypt depth ratio among the patients with persistent intraepithelial lymphocytosis as compared to those with completely normal mucosa. CONCLUSIONS: Despite excellent villous recovery in this study, persistent intraepithelial lymphocytosis was still common among celiac disease patients on a long-term strict gluten-free diet. Consumption of oats was associated with persistent duodenal lymphocytosis and this calls for further investigations. The prognosis of patients with persistent intraepithelial lymphocytosis seems to be good while adhering to a gluten-free diet for a mean of 11 years.},

   abstract = {BACKGROUND: An association between coeliac disease (CD) and functional gastrointestinal disorders (FGIDs) has at present only been demonstrated in adults. AIMS: To assess the prevalence of FGIDs at 1 year and the role of psychological aspects on the development of FGIDs in CD children. METHODS: One-hundred consecutive CD children (36M and 64F) were followed up for 1 year. Fifty-six children (25M and 31F) represented the control group. All children and/or their parents completed validated questionnaires for GI symptoms, depression, and anxiety. GI symptoms at diagnosis and after 1 year of gluten-free diet (GFD) were compared. RESULTS: Twenty-three/82 (28%) CD patients followed up prospectively, on GFD from at least 1 year, fulfilled the Rome III criteria for FGIDs compared with 5/56 (8.9%) controls (P = 0.008; chi(2) = 6.8; OR: 3.97; 95% CI: 1.40-11.21). Children complaining with GI symptoms alone [21/52 (40.3%)] more likely fulfilled Rome III criteria for FGIDs after 1 year of GFD than children with extra-intestinal symptoms (P = 0.045). CD children with FGDIs presented significantly higher anxiety and depression compared to CD children without FGIDs and controls (P = 0.02). CONCLUSIONS: This study demonstrates that children with CD on a GFD for a year have a much higher prevalence of functional GI symptoms than do controls. Whether the risk is due to the residua of a chronic inflammatory process, and/or due to psychological factors remains to be further tested.},

   abstract = {BACKGROUND: We recently developed a (13)C-sorbitol breath test ((13)C-SBT) as an alternative to the H(2)-sorbitol breath test (H(2)-SBT) for coeliac disease. In this study we compared the diagnostic properties of the H(2)-SBT and the (13)C-SBT in follow-up of coeliac disease. MATERIAL AND METHODS: Twenty-seven coeliac patients on a gluten-free diet (GFD) performed the breath tests. All had been tested before treatment in the initial study of the (13)C-SBT, in which 39 untreated coeliac patients, 40 patient controls, and 26 healthy volunteers participated. Five gram sorbitol and 100 mg (13)C-sorbitol were dissolved in 250 ml tap water and given orally. H(2), CH(4) and (13)CO(2) were measured in end-expiratory breath samples every 30 min for 4 h. Increased H(2) concentration >/=20 ppm from basal values was used as cut-off for the H(2)-SBT. Sixty minutes values were used as diagnostic index in the (13)C-SBT. RESULTS: (13)CO(2) levels at 60 min increased in 20/26 treated coeliac patients (77%) after GFD, but were significantly lower than in control groups. Out of 20 patients who had a positive H(2)-SBT before GFD, 12 had a negative H(2)-SBT after GFD. Peak H(2) concentrations were not correlated with (13)C-SBT results. CONCLUSION: The study confirms the sensitivity of a one-hour (13)C-SBT for small intestinal malabsorption. The (13)C-SBT has superior diagnostic properties compared with the H(2)-SBT in follow-up of coeliac disease.},

Limited evidence is available on the safety and efficacy of the DASH eating pattern in special patient populations that were excluded from the trial. Caution should be exercised before initiating the DASH diet in patients with chronic kidney disease, chronic liver disease, and those who are prescribed renin-angiotensin-aldosterone system antagonist, but these conditions are not strict contraindications to DASH. Modifications to the DASH diet may be necessary to facilitate its use in patients with chronic heart failure, uncontrolled diabetes mellitus type II, lactose intolerance, and celiac disease. In general, the DASH diet can be adopted by most patient populations and initiated simultaneously with medication therapy and other lifestyle interventions.},

   abstract = {BACKGROUND: Approximately 1% of the population suffer from coeliac disease. However, the disease is heavily underdiagnosed. Unexplained symptoms may lead to incremented medical consultations and productivity losses. The aim here was to estimate the possible concealed burden of untreated coeliac disease and the effects of a gluten-free diet. METHODS: A nationwide cohort of 700 newly detected adult coeliac patients were prospectively evaluated. Health care service use and sickness absence from work during the year before diagnosis were compared with those in the general population; the data obtained from an earlier study. Additionally, the effect of one year on dietary treatment on the aforementioned parameters and on consumption of pharmaceutical agents was assessed. RESULTS: Untreated coeliac patients used primary health care services more frequently than the general population. On a gluten-free diet, visits to primary care decreased significantly from a mean 3.6 to 2.3. The consumption of medicines for dyspepsia (from 3.7 to 2.4 pills/month) and painkillers (6.8-5.5 pills/month) and the number of antibiotic courses (0.6-0.5 prescriptions/year) was reduced. There were no changes in hospitalizations, outpatient visits to secondary and tertiary care, use of other medical services, or sickness absence, but the consumption of nutritional supplements increased on treatment. CONCLUSIONS: Coeliac disease was associated with excessive health care service use and consumption of drugs before diagnosis. Dietary treatment resulted in a diminished burden to the health care system and lower use of on-demand medicines and antibiotic treatment. The results support an augmented diagnostic approach to reduce underdiagnosis of coeliac disease. TRIAL REGISTRATION: ClinicalTrials.gov NCT01145287.},

   abstract = {BACKGROUND & AIMS: The benefits of serologic screening and early diagnosis of celiac disease in asymptomatic patients are not known. We investigated the impact of a gluten-free diet on self-perceived health and well-being in symptomatic and asymptomatic patients with celiac disease. METHODS: We performed a prospective study of 698 consecutive adults newly diagnosed with celiac disease because of classic (n = 490) or extraintestinal (n = 62) symptoms or through screening of at-risk groups (n = 146; 23 were asymptomatic and analyzed separately). The survey included questions on health and well-being; quality of life was evaluated by the psychological general well-being (PGWB) questionnaire. Patients were followed for 1 year of treatment; 110 healthy subjects served as controls. RESULTS: On a gluten-free diet, self-perceived health improved significantly among patients with classic symptoms and those detected by screening. Patients in all groups were equally concerned about their health before the diagnosis, but anxiety was alleviated by the gluten-free diet. At diagnosis, the quality of life reduced among all 3 groups but improved significantly among patients on the diet. Among the 23 asymptomatic patients, perception of health worsened and concern about health increased while they were on the diet. CONCLUSIONS: Self-perceived health and well-being were low among patients at the time they were diagnosed with celiac disease. Most patients benefited from a gluten-free diet, so it is important to identify patients with celiac disease. Perception of health decreased among asymptomatic cases, which discourages population-based screening.},

There is concern that patients might gain further weight while on a gluten-free diet (GFD). The aim of the study was to evaluate the impact of a GFD on the body mass index (BMI) in a nationwide cohort of coeliac patients and to determine variables predictive of favourable or unfavourable BMI changes. METHODS: We prospectively investigated weight and disease-related issues in 698 newly detected adults diagnosed due to classical or extraintestinal symptoms or by screening. BMI at diagnosis and after one year on a GFD were assessed and compared with that in the general population. RESULTS: At diagnosis, 4% of subjects were underweight, 57% normal, 28% overweight and 11% obese. On a GFD, 69% of underweight patients gained and 18% of overweight and 42% of obese lost weight; in the rest BMI remained stable. Changes were similar in both symptom- and screen-detected patients. The coeliac group had a more favourable BMI pattern than the general population. Favourable BMI changes were associated with subjects' self-rated expertise on GFD and young age at diagnosis, but not dietary counselling received. CONCLUSIONS: BMI improved similarly in screen- and symptom-detected coeliac disease patients on a GFD.},

   abstract = {BACKGROUND AND AIMS: Little is known regarding the impact of coeliac disease on daily living from patients' own viewpoints. The aim of the study was to investigate patients' perceptions of their disease, dietary treatment and self-rated healthcare needs. METHODS: This prospective study involved 698 newly detected adult coeliac disease patients diagnosed due to classical abdominal symptoms, extraintestinal symptoms or active screening in at-risk groups. Participants were asked about their experiences of living with coeliac disease and of adopting a gluten-free diet, as well as their disease-related needs at diagnosis and after one year on treatment. RESULTS: All patients were equally satisfied that they had been diagnosed with coeliac disease irrespective of initial clinical presentation. However, young patients and those with extraintestinal symptoms or asymptomatic and detected by screening in at-risk groups rated the impact on daily living of the disease and adherence to a gluten-free diet with significantly more disapproval than those with classical symptoms. The former groups clarify also reported dietary lapses and a negative attitude to the disease more frequently. Negative perceptions were associated with dissatisfaction with the quality of doctor-patient communication and younger age at diagnosis. CONCLUSIONS: Established doctor-patient communication is essential in minimizing the disease burden. Particularly young and screen-detected asymptomatic patients and those with extraintestinal manifestations require extensive support.},

   abstract = {BACKGROUND: Equine inflammatory small bowel disease (ISBD) is an idiopathic pathologic condition seeming to increase in prevalence. OBJECTIVE: To investigate the potential role of gluten in equine ISBD. ANIMALS & METHODS: Antibodies known to be important in the diagnosis of human coeliac disease (CD): IgA antibodies to human recombinant and guinea pig tissue-transglutaminase (TGA), native gliadin (AGA), deamidated-gliadin-peptides (DGPA), and primate and equine endomysium (EMA) were assessed in blood samples from three different groups of horses: ISBD affected (n = 12) on a gluten-rich diet and controls either on gluten-rich (n = 22) or gluten-poor (n = 25) diets. Significant differences (p < 0.05) between groups were assessed using the Wilcoxon test. RESULTS: Both ISBD-affected horses and gluten-rich controls had significantly (p < 0.0004) higher hrTGA titers than gluten-poor controls. However, ISBD horses did not show significantly increased levels of any of the CD related antibodies when compared to gluten-rich controls. Nevertheless, markedly increased antibody levels (TGA, EMA and DGPA) were found in one of the ISBD horses. The introduction of a gluten-free ration in this 14-year-old warmblood stallion resulted after 6 months in the reduction of antibody levels and clinical recovery associated with improved duodenal histopathology. CONCLUSION: To the best of our knowledge, this is the first study assessing gluten-related antibodies in horses and results suggest a potential pathogenic role of gluten in at least some cases of equine ISBD. Clinical importance and impact for human medicine: Given serology and concurrent clinical findings, this study warrants further investigations into the immunologic basis of possible gluten-sensitive enteropathy in horses and analogy with human disease.},

METHODS: A cross-sectional survey was performed in 2265 adult CD patients recruited through the Dutch Coeliac Association. Self-reported diet adherence was compared among groups based on self-reported depressive symptoms (categorized into current [1-month], remitted, and never). RESULTS: The life-time prevalence rate of self-reported depressive symptoms was 39.0% (n=883), of whom 270 (11.9%) suffered from current depressive symptoms. Adherence to gluten-free diet was strict in 50.2% of patients, sufficient in 46.3%, and insufficient in 3.6%. Insufficient adherence was not associated with current depressive symptoms (odds ratio [OR] 0.95; 95% confidence interval [CI]: 0.48-1.92). Keeping a gluten-free diet for longer than five years was associated with lower OR of current depressive symptoms compared to being on a diet for less than two years (OR 0.69; 95% CI: 0.50-0.95). CONCLUSIONS: Lifetime depressive symptoms may be present in one third of the CD patients who adhere to gluten-free diet. Long-term adherence to the gluten-free diet may reduce the risk of current depressive symptoms.},

However, some patients experience persistence or recurrence of symptoms despite a GFD. These patients require further diagnostic workup. We describe a 62-year-old female with recurring symptoms attributed to refractory coeliac disease (RCD) type I. A 66-year-old patient with a similar history had aberrant intraepithelial lymphocytes characteristic for RCD type II in her duodenum. Furthermore, in a third CD patient described here, microscopic colitis was responsible for diarrhoea that persisted despite strict dietary adherence. Microscopic colitis is strongly associated with CD and should be considered in patients with this disease. On the basis of these three illustrative case studies, we discuss the causes of non-responsive CD and their respective diagnostic workup.},

   abstract = {Although it is recognised that a gluten-free diet has many social implications for coeliac disease patients, not much is known about how such patients actually manage these implications in their everyday interactions. This article examines how dietary restrictions are treated by patients and their families. Data from recorded mealtime conversations of seven Dutch families with children suffering from coeliac disease were analysed using discursive psychology. We found two main discursive strategies by which patients and their families manage the diet during mealtime interactions. A reference to pleasure is used to manage the tension between the child's agency and parental responsibility in the face of health requirements and, by softening the denial of food, the diet is normalised and treated as a shared family practice. The analysis shows that the gluten-free diet is demedicalised and treated as a matter of choice rather than prescription. We conclude with the practical implications of these findings.},

   abstract = {Celiac disease, or gluten sensitive enteropathy is a relatively common disease of the jejunum, leading to malabsorption. It is an immune mediated disease, induced by gluten on the grounds of a specific genetic makeup. After gluten exposition immune processes are induced mainly by T-cells, causing typical intestinal and extra intestinal manifestations. The diagnosis of celiac disease is based on jejunal biopsy histology and the presence of antibodies against endomysium and tissue transglutaminase. Genetically, celiac disease is associated with HLA DQ2/DQ8. Strict gluten-free diet improves the clinical, histological and serological picture and remission may be achieved. In the etiopathogenesis of celiac disease several genetic and immunological mechanisms have been recognized in the recent years. Concerning accompanying diseases/extraintestinal manifestations, several disorders have been shown, including rheumatological diseases. In celiac disease, bone metabolic changes are more frequent compared to the prevalence of inflammatory join disorders. In this review, we aim to give an overview on various aspects of the genetic and immunological processes in the pathomechanism of gluten-sensitive enteropathy and associated metabolic bone disorders.},

   abstract = {Celiac disease (CD) is a gluten-dependent inflammatory disease of the small bowel that affects up to 1% of the worldwide population. Despite severe mucosal abnormalities including total villous atrophy and autoantibody deposition, duodenal ulcer is not a feature of CD. However, a recent study found an elevated rate of peptic ulcer disease in patients with CD. Plasminogen deficiency (PLD) is an autosomal recessive disease that causes pseudomembranous lesions in different organs, but gastrointestinal involvement is rare. Here we report the case of a 6-year-old girl who had a sudden onset of hematemesis caused by duodenal ulcer. On the basis of mucosal atrophy, elevated celiac antibody levels, decreased plasminogen serum activity, and homozygous missense mutation R216H in the plasminogen gene, CD and PLD were diagnosed. This report is, to our knowledge, the first description of the 2 entities, and results of our double-immunofluorescent studies also suggest that both diseases may have a role in the ulceration process. Excessive amounts of fibrin deposition due to PLD caused the distortion of the vessels and was responsible for the unusual celiac immunoglobulin A and tissue transglutaminase 2 in vivo binding pattern. On the basis of this result, patients with CD and unknown cause of gastrointestinal ulcer may require investigation for PLD.},

The diagnosis requires serologic testing and a duodenal biopsy that shows the characteristic findings of intraepithelial lymphocytosis, crypt hyperplasia and villous atrophy, and a positive response to a gluten-free diet. In most patients, the histological diagnosis is easily established. Pitfalls in the pathological diagnosis include a poorly orientated biopsy specimen, either an inadequate biopsy sampling in patients with patchy villous atrophy and the other causes of villous atrophy. A non-response to the gluten-free diet needs to reassess first, the initial diagnosis, second to be sure of the gluten-free diet adherence, and third, to exclude malignant complications such as refractory celiac disease or enteropathy-associated T-cell lymphoma.},

   abstract = {Cholecystokinin (CCK) is a potent regulator of visceral functions as a consequence of its actions on vago-vagal reflex circuit elements. This paper addresses three current controversies regarding the role of CCK to control gastric function via vago-vagal reflexes. Specifically: (a) whether CNS vs. peripheral (vagal afferent) receptors are dominant, (b) whether the long (58) vs. short (8) isoform is more potent and (c) whether nutritional status impacts the gain or even the direction of vago-vagal reflexes. Our in vivo recordings of physiologically identified gastric vagal motor neurones (gastric-DMN) involved in the gastric accommodation reflex (GAR) show unequivocally that: (a) receptors in the coeliac-portal circulation are more sensitive in amplifying gastric vagal reflexes; (b) in the periphery, CCK8 is more potent than CCK58; and (c) the nutritional status has a marginal effect on gastric reflex control. While the GAR reflex is more sensitive in the fasted rat, CCK amplifies this sensitivity. Thus, our results are in stark contrast to recent reports which have suggested that vago-vagal reflexes are inverted by the metabolic status of the animal and that this inversion could be mediated by CCK within the CNS.},

   abstract = {INTRODUCTION: Celiac disease (CD) is a common illness, affecting 0.5-1% of the population. Its classic presentation consists of gastrointestinal symptoms, however, many extra-intestinal symptoms and some associated diseases have been studied. Pediatricians should know the typical and atypical presentations of CD and how to diagnosis and treat its complications. The aim of this study was describe what pediatricians in Brazil know about CD. METHODS: A descriptive, cross-sectional study with pediatricians who participated in the Nestle Pediatrics Course, in the city of Natal, Brazil, in 2008. They were asked to complete a self-applicable questionnaire covering aspects concerning the prevalence, diagnosis, and treatment of CD and the conditions associated with this disease. RESULTS: A total of 632 pediatricians completed the questionnaire. The majority of respondents (82.9%) were female. All the geographical regions of Brazil were represented. More than 65% of respondents had undergone specialist training in pediatrics, and 40% of respondents had worked as pediatricians for more than 25 years. Only 22% replied that celiac disease may be asymptomatic, 57% stated that antigliadin antibody measurement represents the best screening tool for the disease, and two-thirds replied that bowel biopsy would be the most indicated method. The pathologies and conditions associated with celiac disease were identified by fewer than 50% of respondents. Exclusion of gluten from the patient's diet was mentioned as the treatment for celiac disease by 86.4% of the pediatricians. CONCLUSIONS: We conclude that pediatricians have superficial information about CD. The need for relevant information on celiac disease is fundamental and is recognized by the pediatricians themselves.},

RESULTS: Few Foxp3(+) cells were found in controls and inflammatory conditions (oesophagitis, gastritis, coeliac disease, inflammatory bowel disease); in preneoplastic and neoplastic conditions the number of Foxp3(+) cells was significatively increased. CONCLUSIONS: In normal conditions the number of mucosal lymphocytes is very low throughout the gastro-intestinal tract; in active coeliac disease patients or on a gluten-free diet, only a slight increase in Foxp3(+) cells may be found. Gastrointestinal cancers are associated with higher Foxp3(+) cell proportion, compared with microscopically normal tissue and with precancerous conditions. However, it is uncertain whether the increase in these regulatory cells is a cause or a consequence of tumour progression.},

   abstract = {BACKGROUND: Celiac disease (CD) is an autoimmune enteropathy characterized by villus atrophy and malabsorption of essential nutrients. Vitamin D deficiency has been described in autoimmune diseases, but its status in prepubertal children with CD has not been adequately studied. OBJECTIVE: To determine the vitamin D status of prepubertal children with CD. STUDY DESIGN: A retrospective study of prepubertal children aged 3-12 years with CD (n=24) who were compared to prepubertal, non-CD children of the same age (n=50). Children were included in the study if they had a diagnosis of CD by intestinal biopsy, and were not on a gluten-free diet (GFD). Patients were excluded if they had diseases of calcium or vitamin D metabolism, or were receiving calcium or vitamin D supplementation or had other autoimmune diseases. All subjects had their serum 25-hydroxyvitamin D [25(OH)D] level measured. RESULTS: There was no difference in 25(OH)D level between the CD and non-CD children (27.58 +/- 9.91 versus 26.20 +/- 10.45, p = 0.59). However, when the patients were subdivided into obese and non-obese groups, the non-obese CD patients had a significantly higher 25(OH)D level than the obese normal children (28.39 +/- 10.26 versus 21.58 +/- 5.67, p = 0.009). In contrast, there was no difference in 25(OH)D level between non-obese CD patients and non-obese normal children (28.39 +/- 10.26 versus 30.64 +/-12.08, p = 0.52). The season of 25(OH)D measurement was not a significant confounder (p =0.7). CONCLUSIONS: Our data showed no difference in 25(OH) D levels between normal children and those with CD when adjusted for body mass index.},

   abstract = {BACKGROUND: The utility of serologic screening for celiac disease is still debatable. Evidence suggests that the disorder remains undetected even in the older population. It remains obscure whether screening makes good or harm in subjects with long-standing gluten ingestion. We evaluated whether older subjects benefit from active detection and subsequent gluten free dietary treatment of celiac disease. METHODS: Thirty-five biopsy-proven patients aged over 50 years had been detected by serologic mass screening. We examined the disease history, dietary compliance, symptoms, quality of life and bone mineral density at baseline and 1-2 years after the commencement of a gluten-free diet. Symptoms were evaluated by gastrointestinal symptom rating scale and quality of life by psychological general well-being questionnaires. Small bowel biopsy, serology, laboratory parameters assessing malabsorption, and bone mineral density were investigated. RESULTS: Dietary compliance was good. The patients had initially low mean serum ferritin values indicating subclinical iron deficiency, which was restored by a gluten-free diet. Vitamin B12, vitamin D and erythrocyte folic acid levels increased significantly on diet. Celiac patients had a history of low-energy fractures more often than the background population, and the diet had a beneficial effect on bone mineral density. Alleviation in gastrointestinal symptoms was observed, even though the patients reported no or only subtle symptoms at diagnosis. Quality of life remained unchanged. Of all the cases, two thirds would have been diagnosed even without screening if the family history, fractures or concomitant autoimmune diseases had been taken carefully into account. CONCLUSIONS: Screen-detected patients benefited from a gluten-free diet. We encourage a high index of suspicion and active case-finding in celiac disease as an alternative to mass screening in older patients.},

   abstract = {OBJECTIVE: Replacement T4 dose in hypothyroid patients bearing both chronic autoimmune thyroiditis and atypical celiac disease (CD) has been analyzed. DESIGN: Replacement T4 dose has been analyzed in 35 hypothyroid patients with Hashimoto's thyroiditis (HT) and atypical CD, as defined by the American Gastroenterological Association. We have evaluated the ability of the same dose of T4 to reach target TSH in 21 patients before and during gluten-free diet (GFD). In the remaining 14 patients, noncompliant with GFD, we analyzed replacement T4 dose and compared it with that in a similar group consisting of 68 patients with hypothyroid HT but no evidence of celiac sprue or other conditions interfering with T4 absorption. RESULTS: In patients with isolated HT, the desired serum TSH (median=1.02 mU/liter) was reached in all patients after 5+/-2 months of treatment at a median T4 dose of 1.31 mug/kg.d. After a similar period and dose of T4, higher levels of TSH (median=4.20 mU/liter) were observed in patients with HT and CD. In 21 CD patients, target TSH (median TSH=1.25 mU/liter) has been attained after 11+/-3 months of GFD without increasing T4 dose (1.32 mug/kg.d). In the remaining 14 patients, who were noncompliant with GFD, target TSH has also been achieved but at a higher T4 dose (median=1.96 mug/kg.d; +49%; P=0.0002) than in hypothyroid patients without CD. CONCLUSIONS: Atypical CD increases the need for T4. The effect was reversed by GFD or by increasing T4 dose. Malabsorption of T4 may provide the opportunity to detect CD that was overlooked until the patients were put under T4 therapy.},

   abstract = {OBJECTIVE: To assess whether systemic autoimmune diseases are a risk group for coeliac disease and if there is a systemic autoimmune diseases-associated enteropathy. METHODS: 183 patients with systemic autoimmune diseases were included. Duodenal biopsy was carried out on patients with positive coeliac genetics (HLA-DQ2-DQ8) and/or serology and/or symptoms of the coeliac disease spectrum. When enteropathy was found, causes, including gluten sensitivity, were investigated and categorized according to a sequentially applied treatment. Results were analysed with Chi-square or Fisher exact tests. RESULTS: The prevalence of coeliac disease with atrophy was 0.55% (1 of 183 patients). Thirty-eight of the 109 patients (34.8%) who underwent duodenal biopsy had lymphocytic enteropathy (8 infectious, 5 due to gluten sensitive enteropathy, 5 HLA-DQ2/DQ8 who did not accept gluten-free diet and 20 of unknown aetiology). Lymphocytic enteropathy was unrelated to disease activity or immunosuppressants. HLA-DQ2 was more frequent in connective tissue disease (41.5%) compared with systemic vasculitis and autoinflammatory diseases (17.9%) (p=0.02), whereas a lower percentage of lymphocytic enteropathy was observed in the former (20.2% vs. 41.6%). Lymphocytic enteropathy was clinically irrelevant in cases with no definite aetiology. DISCUSSION: One third of systemic autoimmune diseases patients had enteropathy of uncertain clinical meaning in the majority of cases, which was rarely due to gluten sensitive enteropathy.},

   abstract = {Among gluten-related disorders, gluten sensitivity is an emerging entity that is characterized by a wide array of manifestations. In particular, patients complain of IBS-like symptoms and extraintestinal manifestations that occur shortly after the ingestion of gluten. Symptoms improve or disappear when gluten is withdrawn from the diet, and recur if gluten is reintroduced. Laboratory tests are usually unhelpful for diagnosis, although ~50% of patients are positive for IgG antigliadin antibodies. The natural history of gluten sensitivity is unknown; in particular, it is still to be clarified whether this disorder is permanent or transient and whether it is linked to autoimmunity. The pathogenesis of gluten sensitivity is unclear; data so far demonstrate a predominant activation of innate immune responses. Further research is necessary to establish the main clinicopathological features of gluten sensitivity, thus enabling physicians to improve their management of the increasing number of patients who are sensitive to dietary gluten.},

The prevalence of CD in T1DM varies from 3 to 16%, with a mean prevalence of 8%. The clinical presentation of CD in T1DM is classified as symptomless in approximately half of cases, but a more accurate analysis often discloses a wide array of symptoms suggestive of CD. Both T1DM and CD show the same genetic background and an abnormal small intestinal immune response with inflammation and a variable grade of enteropathy. Serological screening for CD should be performed in all T1DM patients by means of antibodies to tissue transglutaminase at T1DM onset. T1DM patients found to be celiacs must be treated by a gluten-free diet. Potential CD cases (especially when asymptomatic) should be kept on a gluten-containing diet with a careful clinical and antibody follow-up, since many of them will not develop villous atrophy.},

   abstract = {BACKGROUND: Celiac disease (CD) has been established as being associated with several thyroid diseases. However, occurrence of thyroid epithelial cancer in celiac patients has been rarely described. GOAL: We describe the prevalence of thyroid carcinoma detected in a cohort of Italian celiac patients, with the aim to carry out a prospective analysis of the risk of celiac patients to develop thyroid carcinoma. METHODS: The study population included all CD patients diagnosed at the Collaborating Centers of the Italian Registry of CD between January 1, 1982 and December 31, 2006. Upon diagnosis of CD and at every subsequent clinical control, the Collaborating Centers filled in a validated form for each CD patient reporting information about demographic data, possible occurrence of a thyroid disease, and adherence to a gluten-free diet. RESULTS: Of the 1757 celiac patients enrolled, 6 developed a papillary thyroid carcinoma during the follow-up period (mean: 18.1 y). The Standardized Incidence Ratio resulted 2.55 (95% confidence interval=0.93-5.55; P<0.01). The mean age of diagnosis of CD in patients who developed thyroid carcinoma was rather low (40 y) and not statistically different from that of those who did not develop thyroid carcinoma. The number of gluten-containing diet per month did not correlate with the development of a thyroid carcinoma. CONCLUSIONS: There is a 2.5-fold increased risk of papillary cancer of thyroid for celiac patients. A prompt diagnosis of CD and a strict adherence to gluten-free diet do not seem to protect from the development of this malignancy.},

   abstract = {OBJECTIVES: Addition of a non-invasive marker for intestinal damage to the currently used parameters for celiac disease activity (symptoms, serologic tests and biopsy) might further improve clinical management of celiac disease (CD). Intestinal fatty acid binding protein (I-FABP) is a cytosolic enterocyte protein and sensitive marker for enterocyte damage in the small intestine. We investigated whether serum I-FABP levels can reliably identify villous atrophy in children with a positive CD antibody screening. Moreover, the recovery of I-FABP levels after gluten free diet (GFD) was studied. METHODS: I-FABP levels were analyzed retrospectively in 49 children with biopsy proven CD and in 19 patients with a positive screening but without histological confirmation of CD. Blood was collected before biopsy and repeatedly after the onset of GFD. RESULTS: Initial I-FABP concentrations in CD (median 458 pg/ml) were significantly (p < 0.001) elevated compared to controls (median 20 pg/ml). In the control group, only two of 19 children were found to have elevated I-FABP levels, of which one was subsequently diagnosed with CD after gluten challenge. I-FABP concentrations correlated with severity of villous atrophy. In all CD patients, I-FABP levels decreased quickly after GFD and normalized in 80% of patients within 12 weeks. CONCLUSIONS: Elevated I-FABP levels accurately predict villous atrophy in children with a positive serologic test for CD (positive predictive value 98%). In addition, measurement of I-FABP enables monitoring the response to GFD.},

   abstract = {BACKGROUND: The prevalence of celiac disease among type 1 diabetes mellitus (T1DM) patients is 5-10 times higher than in the general population. Thus, evaluation of celiac serology is indicated at diagnosis of T1DM and on follow up. AIM: This study was prompted by the observation that elevated anti-TTG antibody levels in diabetic children may spontaneously normalize despite continued consumption of gluten. The objective of the study was to investigate the prevalence of this phenomenon and associated factors. MATERIALS AND METHODS: The files of all children diagnosed with type 1 diabetes mellitus from 2003-2009 at a tertiary pediatric medical center were reviewed for those with elevated serum levels of anti-TTG antibody. Clinical, medical, laboratory, and treatment data were collected. Findings were compared between patients diagnosed with celiac disease and patients with initially elevated anti-TTG antibody levels that spontaneously normalized. RESULTS: Forty-eight of the 738 patients with type 1 diabetes attending our center (6.5%) had elevated anti-TTG antibody blood levels. Celiac disease was diagnosed in 23, and anti-TTG antibody levels normalized in 17 (35.4%), all of whom consumed gluten. At one-year follow-up, there was no significant difference between the groups in HbA1c level or change in anthropometric measurements. CONCLUSION: Physicians treating children with type 1 diabetes and mildly elevated anti-TTG antibody levels might consider 12-month serologic follow-up on a gluten-containing diet rather than immediate duodenal biopsy.},

The diagnosis requires a joint clinicopathological approach; the recommended first-line test is serology with immunoglobulin A (IgA) tissue transglutaminase and IgA endomysial antibodies. These serological tests show high levels of sensitivity and specificity, but biopsy is the gold standard to confirm the diagnosis. It is important that both tests are performed before the introduction of a gluten-free diet. Although the classical histopathology changes of coeliac disease with partial or total villous atrophy are well recognized, the pathology classification of coeliac disease is changing, with recognition that coeliac disease may show minimal pathology (normal architecture and an intraepithelial lymphocyte count/100 enterocytes >/= 25). This entity is also described as lymphocytic duodenosis, and recommendation of follow-up serology testing is paramount in this condition. Follow-up of patients with coeliac disease is warranted, as normal serology does not predict mucosal recovery. Failure to heal predicts risk of progression to refractory coeliac disease and malignancies. Refractory coeliac disease occurs in 1-2% of patients and this diagnosis requires a combined clinical and histopathology approach with immunocytochemistry.},

The pathogenic role of anti-gliadin antibodies has been questioned, and pathophysiology remains controversial. CASE REPORT: I report chorea in a patient with celiac disease, which responded to a gluten-restricted diet. The response of the movement disorder to change in diet strongly suggests a functional role for anti-gliadin antibodies in the generation of chorea, probably involving basal ganglia targets. DISCUSSION: Gluten sensitivity may be a treatable cause of chorea.},

   abstract = {Techniques that can effectively separate protein-peptide complexes from free peptides have shown great value in major histocompatibility complex (MHC)-peptide binding studies. However, most of the available techniques are limited to measuring the binding of a single peptide to an MHC molecule. As antigen presentation in vivo involves both endogenous ligands and exogenous antigens, the deconvolution of multiple binding events necessitates the implementation of a more powerful technique. Here we show that capillary electrophoresis coupled to fluorescence detection (CE-FL) can resolve multiple MHC-peptide binding events owing to its superior resolution and the ability to simultaneously monitor multiple emission channels. We utilized CE-FL to investigate competition and displacement of endogenous peptides by an immunogenic gluten peptide for binding to HLA-DQ2. Remarkably, this immunogenic peptide could displace CLIP peptides from the DQ2 binding site at neutral but not acidic pH. This unusual ability of the gluten peptide supports a direct loading mechanism of antigen presentation in extracellular environment, a property that could explain the antigenicity of dietary gluten in celiac disease.},

   abstract = {Wheat supplies about 20% of the total food calories consumed worldwide and is a national staple in many countries. Besides being a key source of plant proteins, it is also a major cause of many diet-induced health issues, especially celiac disease. The only effective treatment for this disease is a total gluten-free diet. The present report describes an effort to develop a natural dietary therapy for this disorder by transcriptional suppression of wheat DEMETER (DME) homeologs using RNA interference. DME encodes a 5-methylcytosine DNA glycosylase responsible for transcriptional derepression of gliadins and low-molecular-weight glutenins (LMWgs) by active demethylation of their promoters in the wheat endosperm. Previous research has demonstrated these proteins to be the major source of immunogenic epitopes. In this research, barley and wheat DME genes were cloned and localized on the syntenous chromosomes. Nucleotide diversity among DME homeologs was studied and used for their virtual transcript profiling. Functional conservation of DME enzyme was confirmed by comparing the motif and domain structure within and across the plant kingdom. Presence and absence of CpG islands in prolamin gene sequences was studied as a hallmark of hypo- and hypermethylation, respectively. Finally the epigenetic influence of DME silencing on accumulation of LMWgs and gliadins was studied using 20 transformants expressing hairpin RNA in their endosperm. These transformants showed up to 85.6% suppression in DME transcript abundance and up to 76.4% reduction in the amount of immunogenic prolamins, demonstrating the possibility of developing wheat varieties compatible for the celiac patients.},

   abstract = {OBJECTIVES: To establish the incidence of childhood coeliac disease (CD) in Scotland between 1 September 2009 and 31 August 2010, to determine clinical features at presentation and reasons for diagnosis, and to identify any differences in incidence and practice between regions. DESIGN: Prospective data collection through the Scottish Paediatric Surveillance Unit (SPSU). Strategic contacts in each tertiary gastrointestinal region (East, West and North) were emailed monthly to report new cases of CD (<16 years). A clinical questionnaire was completed for each case. Additionally, regional laboratories were asked to report the number of diagnostic antibody tests for CD performed over the year. SETTING: This national study looked at the total cases within Scotland. Scotland has a population of 5.2 million, with the mid-year estimate in 2009 of 912 144 children under the age of 16. RESULTS: 91 new cases were reported, giving an overall adjusted incidence of 10.0/100 000/year. Incidence in the East was 16.3/100 000/year, West 8.1/100 000/year and North 7.7/100 000/year. Cases diagnosed due to active screening in the East (4.6/100 000/year) were more than twice the number observed in the West (2.0/100 000/year) and North (1.3/100 000/year), as was the incidence of classic cases. The most frequent symptoms reported were abdominal pain (50/91; 54.9%), failure to thrive (29/91; 31.9%), fatigue (29/91; 31.9%), diarrhoea (27/91; 29.7%) and bloating (19/91; 20.9%). Twenty-two children (24.2%) were diagnosed due to active screening, of which 14 had associated type 1 diabetes mellitus, one Down syndrome and seven had family history. Fifty-five per cent (12/22) of the patients diagnosed through active screening were asymptomatic. Significantly more CD diagnostic antibody tests were performed per head of population in the East compared with the West (OR 1.65, 95% CI 1.57 to 1.73) and North (OR 1.81, 95% CI 1.70 to 1.92). CONCLUSIONS: Approximately double the incidence of paediatric CD was observed in the East of Scotland. Evidence of more actively screened cases diagnosed and more antibody tests performed in the region suggests a lower threshold to test. An environmental influence cannot be dismissed since more classic cases were also captured. Further research is needed to highlight the role of any exogenous factors.},

   abstract = {Celiac disease (CD) is an inflammatory disease of the upper small intestine in genetically predisposed individuals caused by glutamine- and proline-rich peptides from cereal storage proteins (gluten) with a minimal length of nine amino acids. Such peptides are insufficiently degraded by gastrointestinal enzymes; they permeate the lymphatic tissue, are bound to celiac-specific, antigen-presenting cells, and stimulate intestinal T-cells. The typical clinical pattern is a flat small intestinal mucosa and malabsorption. Currently, the only therapy is a strict, lifelong gluten-free diet. Recent research has shown that gluten and gluten peptides can be degraded by prolyl endopeptidases from different sources. These peptidases can either be used to produce gluten-free foods from gluten-containing raw materials, or they have been suggested as an oral therapy for CD, in which dietary gluten is hydrolyzed by coingested peptidases already in the stomach, thus preventing CD-specific immune reactions in the small intestine. This would be an alternative for CD patients to the gluten-free diet. Furthermore, microbial transglutaminase could be used to detoxify gluten either by selectively modifying glutamine residues of intact gluten by transamidation with lysine methyl ester or by crosslinking gluten peptides in beverages via isopeptide bonds so that they can be removed by filtration.},

It may also be due to calcium wasting syndromes, and it can rarely be induced by adenomas of the parathyroid glands and in parathormone receptor mutations (pseudohyperparathyroidism). A 12-year old Gambian girl living in Hamburg, Germany, was developing abdominal and joint pain. Serum analysis revealed low serum-calcium, significantly elevated parathormone and decreased vitamin D. Immigrant rickets was assumed. Because of abdominal pain and iron deficiency, lambliasis was ruled out. Celiac disease was demonstrated by gliadin and endomysium antibodies as well as by intestinal mucosa biopsy. Despite of a gluten-free diet the joint pains persisted. They were declared by rheumatologists to be caused by a chronic juvenile arthritis (sister disease of celiac disease). However, there were no positive inflammation signals and no clear elevated rheuma-immunology. Follow up: Gluten-free diet and additional treatment with calcium and active vitamin D did not stop increasing parathormone levels, did not stop abdominal and joint pain, and did not stop increment of positive celiac disease antibodies. Assuming compliance problems the patient was then treated with vitamin D injections, which caused decreasing parathormone levels and vanishing joint pain. Celiac disease can cause intestinal rickets with elevated parathomone levels mimicking chronic juvenile arthritis, if gluten-free diet is not strictly performed by compliance problems.},

   abstract = {The demand for gluten-free bread is growing as the recognition of celiac disease and wheat allergy has increased worldwide. In our previous study, reduced glutathione (GSH) was found to improve the gas-retaining properties of rice batter used for gluten-free bread. In this article, oxidized glutathione (GSSG) was shown to have the same effect. Moreover, sensory tests revealed that GSSG bread had a significantly reduced sulfurous odor. Analyses by a gas chromatography-flame photometric detector demonstrated the presence of hydrogen sulfide and methyl mercaptan in the headspace of GSH bread, and also their significant reduction in GSSG bread. The viscoelastic properties and microstructures of GSSG and GSH bread did not noticeably differ. These observations suggest the usefulness of GSSG in making gluten-free rice bread and extend our knowledge of the use of glutathione in food processing. Practical Application: Glutathione, a widely-distributed peptide in cells, improves the bread-making quality of gluten-free rice batter. While both the reduced (GSH) and oxidized (GSSG) glutathione are effective, GSSG-bread has significantly reduced sulfurous odor compared to GSH-bread.},

   abstract = {Celiac disease (CD) is an immune-mediated, inflammatory disorder of the small intestines with a defined genetic etiological component associated with the expression of HLA-DQ2 and/or HLA-DQ8 haplotypes. The dietary consumption of gluten-rich cereals triggers a gluten-specific immune response in genetically susceptible individuals leading to a spectrum of clinical manifestations ranging from an inapparent subclinical disease, to overt enteropathy that can in some individuals progress to enteropathy-associated T cell lymphoma (EATL). The tissue-destructive pathologic process of CD is driven by activated NK-like intraepithelial CD8(+) lymphocytes and the proinflammatory cytokine IL-15 has emerged to be pivotal in orchestrating this perpetual tissue destruction and inflammation. Moreover, transgenic mice that over-express human IL-15 from an enterocyte-specific promoter (T3(b)-hIL-15 Tg) recapitulate many of the disease-defining T and B cell-mediated pathologic features of CD, further supporting the evolving consensus that IL-15 represents a valuable target in devising therapeutic interventions against the form of the disease that is especially refractory to gluten-free diet. In the present study, we evaluated the potential efficacy of tofacitinib, a pan-JAK inhibitor that abrogates IL-15 signaling, as a therapeutic modality against CD using T3(b)-hIL-15 Tg mice. We demonstrate that tofacitinib therapy leads to a lasting reversal of pathologic manifestations in the treated mice, thereby highlighting the potential value of tofacitininb as a therapeutic modality against refractory CD for which no effective therapy exists currently. Additionally, the visceral adiposity observed in the tofacitinib-treated mice underscores the importance of continued evaluation of the drug's impact on the lipid metabolism.},

   abstract = {Celiac disease (CD) is a chronic immune-mediated intestinal inflammatory disorder afflicting genetically susceptible individuals triggered by the consumption of dietary cereals with high gluten content. As with many other organ-specific autoimmune diseases, the dominant tissue-destructive inflammation in CD is T cell-mediated. The proinflammatory cytokine IL-15 that is overexpressed in the intestinal epithelium of CD patients has emerged as a pivotal element that orchestrates intestinal inflammation and T cell-mediated autoimmune tissue destruction. Although no animal model exists that recapitulates the full spectrum of CD pathophysiology, we have previously reported that transgenic mice that overexpress human IL-15 in enterocytes (T3(b)-hlL-15 Tg) display many of the T cell-mediated pathologic features seen in CD. Extending these observations, we now report that T3(b)-hlL-15 Tg mice in addition to recapitulating T cell-mediated effects also display autoantibodies including those against tissue transglutaminase 2 and extensive lamina propria plasmacytosis, all of which are characteristic of CD, thereby reflecting the possibility that locally expressed IL-15 drives both T and B cell pathologic effects seen in CD. More importantly, these findings support the validity and utility of T3(b)-hlL-15 Tg mice as a reasonable model to investigate not only tissue-destructive pathologic processes in CD, but also to explore novel therapeutic modalities for the treatment of this disease.},

The study was divided into five steps: preparation/selection, chemical, sensory, technological, and statistical analysis. The modified sample presented greater acceptance (84.5% for celiac individuals and 61.2% for nonceliac) than standard samples (53.6% for nonceliac individuals). There was no significant difference between the modified and the standard samples in terms of appearance, aroma, flavor, and overall quality. The modified pastas presented approximately 98% less lipids. Green bananas are considered a subproduct of low commercial value with little industrial use. The possibility of developing gluten-free products with green banana flour can expand the product supply for people with celiac disease and contribute to a more diverse diet.},

   abstract = {BACKGROUND & AIMS: Patients with celiac disease have varying degrees of damage to the small intestinal mucosa, ranging from lymphocytic duodenosis with normal villous structure to severe villous atrophy. We assessed whether the severity of mucosal lesions was associated with clinical and laboratory features of celiac disease. METHODS: We compared demographic, clinical, and laboratory characteristics among patients with celiac disease who were classified based on the severity of duodenal lesions. We analyzed data from 1408 adult patients seen consecutively at a tertiary referral center since 1990. Patients were classified as having villous atrophy (n = 1249) or as having mild enteropathy (n = 159) in the presence or absence of villous atrophy. RESULTS: Similar percentages of patients with villous atrophy, vs mild enteropathy, experienced weight loss (17% vs 17%), gastrointestinal manifestations (70% vs 70%), extraintestinal manifestations (66% vs 57%), and other associated conditions (19% vs 23%). More patients with villous atrophy than patients with mild enteropathy developed osteopenia or osteoporosis (22% vs 5%; P = .0005). Greater percentages of patients with villous atrophy than those with mild enteropathy also had anemia (42% vs 29%; P = .002), folate deficiency (75% vs 64%; P = .02), hypocholesterolemia (7% vs 2%; P = .02), hypocalcemia (26% vs 13%; P = .004), or hyperparathyroidism (45% vs 29%; P = .004). CONCLUSIONS: Although osteopenia, osteoporosis, and alterations in laboratory parameters are prevalent among patients with celiac disease with mild enteropathy, they are more prevalent and severe in those with villous atrophy. The prevalence of associated conditions is similar between these groups. These results indicate that celiac disease with mild enteropathy is not mild disease, but requires treatment with a gluten-free diet.},

   abstract = {BACKGROUND: Duodenal biopsy may be unnecessary to confirm celiac disease in patients with high tissue-transglutaminase antibody level. AIMS: To define a cut-off value of tissue-transglutaminase antibody with high positive likelihood ratio for duodenal atrophy in patients with suspected celiac disease. METHODS: We retrospectively identified 945 patients with suspected celiac disease and classified according to the method used for tissue-transglutaminase antibody assay: Group A (n=393, Eu-tTG(R) Eurospital), Group B (n=263; Eu-tTG(R) Eurospital) and Group C (n=289; Celikey(R) Phadia). Duodenal histology was graded according to Marsh. Sensitivity, specificity, and positive likelihood ratio were used to evaluate cut-off points of tissue-transglutaminase antibody as predictor of villous atrophy. RESULTS: 100% specificity and infinity positive likelihood ratio for duodenal atrophy was observed at a cut-off value of tissue-transglutaminase antibody 5 times higher than the upper limit of normal. CD diagnosis was confirmed by concordance with antiendomysial antibodies, and by reduction of t-TG titre in all patients and improvement of duodenal histology in 80% during gluten-free diet. CONCLUSIONS: Tissue-transglutaminase antibody level 5-folds the upper limit of normal is 100% specific for duodenal atrophy and using this cut-off biopsy could by avoided in 1/3 of patients. Diagnostic criteria of celiac disease in adults need revision.},

Currently, the only therapy able to normalize the clinical and histological manifestation of the disease is a strict and life-long gluten-free (GF) diet. The replacement of gluten presents a significant technological challenge, as it is an essential structure-building protein, which is necessary for formulating high-quality baked goods. The objective of this paper is to review some basics about CD, its current prevalence, and the recent advances in the preparation of high-quality GF breads using GF flours, starches, hydrocolloids, gums, and novel functional ingredients and technologies.},

   abstract = {A gluten-free (GF) diet is recognised as being the only accepted treatment for celiac disease-a permanent autoimmune enteropathy triggered by the ingestion of gluten-containing cereals. The bakery products available in today's gluten-free market are characterised by lower palatability than their conventional counterparts and may lead to nutritional deficiencies of vitamins, minerals and fibre. Thus, the production of high-quality gluten-free products has become a very important socioeconomical issue. Microbial fermentation by means of lactic acid bacteria and yeast is one of the most ecological/economical methods of producing and preserving food. In this review, the role of a fermentation process for improving the quality of GF products and for developing a new concept of GF products with nutraceutical and health-promoting characteristics will be examined.},

   abstract = {OBJECTIVES: Celiac disease (CD) is a condition in which the regulation of the mucosal immune response to dietary gliadin might be altered. The transcription factor forkhead box P3 (Foxp3) has been identified as a marker of a subset of regulatory T cells (Treg). In this study, we have investigated the presence and the suppressive function of Treg cells in the celiac small intestinal mucosa, their correlation with the disease state, and the inducibility by gliadin in an organ culture system; moreover, we tried to define whether interleukin 15 (IL-15), overexpressed in CD, could influence the regulatory activity of such cells. METHODS: The expression of Foxp3, CD3, CD4, and CD8 were analyzed by immunohistochemistry and flow cytometry in duodenal biopsies taken from patients with untreated CD, treated CD, and from non-CD controls, as well as in vitro cultured biopsy samples from treated CD patients, upon challenge with gliadin. Furthermore, we analyzed the suppressive function of CD4+CD25+ T cells, isolated from untreated CD biopsy samples, on autologous responder CD4+CD25- T cells, in the presence of a polyclonal stimulus, with or without IL-15. RESULTS: Higher density of CD4+CD25+Foxp3+ T cells was seen in duodenal biopsy samples from active CD patients in comparison with treated CD and non-CD controls. In coculture, CD4+CD25+ T cells were functionally suppressive, but their activity was impaired by IL-15. Cells from CD subjects showed increased sensitivity to the IL-15 action, likely due to enhanced expression of IL-15 receptor. Finally, we demonstrated an expansion of Foxp3 in treated CD mucosa following in vitro challenge with gliadin. CONCLUSIONS: These data suggest that CD4+CD25+Foxp3+ T cells are induced in situ by gliadin. However, their suppressor capacity might be impaired in vivo by IL-15; this phenomenon contributes to maintain and expand the local inflammatory response in CD.},

The gluten-free diet is complex, costly and impacts on all activities involving food, making it difficult to maintain for a lifetime. The purpose of this cross-sectional study was to evaluate the difficulties experienced, the strategies used and the emotional impact of following a gluten-free diet among Canadians with coeliac disease. METHODS: A questionnaire was mailed to all members (n = 10 693) of both the Canadian Celiac Association and the Fondation quebecoise de la maladie coeliaque in 2008. RESULTS: The overall response rate was 72%. Results are presented for the 5912 respondents (>/=18 years) reporting biopsy-confirmed coeliac disease and/or dermatitis herpetiformis. Two-thirds never intentionally consumed gluten. Women reported significantly greater emotional responses to a gluten-free diet but, with time, were more accepting of it than men. Difficulties and negative emotions were experienced less frequently by those on the diet for >5 years, although food labelling and eating away from home remained very problematic. Frustration and isolation because of the diet were the most common negative emotions experienced. CONCLUSIONS: The present study quantifies the difficulties experienced, the strategies used and the emotional impact of following a gluten-free diet. It highlights the need to improve the training and education of dietitians, other health providers and the food service industry workers about coeliac disease and a gluten-free diet, with the aim of better helping individuals improve their adherence to a gluten-free diet and their quality of life.},

   abstract = {BACKGROUND: Celiac disease is an enteropathy triggered by dietary gluten found in wheat, barley, and rye. The current treatment is a strict gluten-free diet. Quinoa is a highly nutritive plant from the Andes, with low concentrations of prolamins, that has been recommended as part of a gluten-free diet; however, few experimental data support this recommendation. OBJECTIVE: We aimed to determine the amount of celiac-toxic prolamin epitopes in quinoa cultivars from different regions of the Andes and the ability of these epitopes to activate immune responses in patients with celiac disease. DESIGN: The concentration of celiac-toxic epitopes was measured by using murine monoclonal antibodies against gliadin and high-molecular-weight glutenin subunits. Immune response was assessed by proliferation assays of celiac small intestinal T cells/interferon-gamma (IFN-gamma) and production of IFN-gamma/IL-15 after organ culture of celiac duodenal biopsy samples. RESULTS: Fifteen quinoa cultivars were tested: 4 cultivars had quantifiable concentrations of celiac-toxic epitopes, but they were below the maximum permitted for a gluten-free food. Cultivars Ayacuchana and Pasankalla stimulated T cell lines at levels similar to those for gliadin and caused secretion of cytokines from cultured biopsy samples at levels comparable with those for gliadin. CONCLUSIONS: Most quinoa cultivars do not possess quantifiable amounts of celiac-toxic epitopes. However, 2 cultivars had celiac-toxic epitopes that could activate the adaptive and innate immune responses in some patients with celiac disease. These findings require further investigation in the form of in vivo studies, because quinoa is an important source of nutrients for patients with celiac disease.},

Collagenous sprue is a rare disease entity, with only about 60 sporadic cases reported worldwide since it was first described in 1947. Its exact etiology is still under investigation, and its relationship with classic celiac disease and other refractory, spruelike intestinal disorders remains controversial. Two larger-scale studies, in 2009, brought new insights into this elusive, yet emerging, topic. Here, we present a review of the literature on the possible etiology of collagenous sprue, its proposed links to classic celiac disease and to refractory sprue, and its clinical, biochemical, histologic, and molecular features. To our knowledge, all case reports on collagenous sprue in the medical literature to date are summarized.},

Serologic studies demonstrate that most celiac patients present with oligosymptomatic (silent), latent, potential, and extraintestinal forms. The disease is defined as an immune-mediated systemic disorder of genetically disposed individuals (HLA-DQ2/8) induced by the alcohol-soluble fractions of cereals and characterized by gluten-dependent symptoms, celiac-specific antibodies (against tissue transglutaminase 2), and a Marsh 2-3 enteropathy. In the last 60 years, a strict and lifelong gluten-free diet has been demonstrated to be effective and safe, preventing most potential complications of the disease, including autoimmune disease, osteoporosis, infertility, prematurity, and malignancy. Among patients with celiac disease, the toxicity of oats seems to be less than wheat, barley, and rye. The introduction of oats into the diet of patients with celiac disease should increase taste, fiber content, diversity, compliance with the diet, and quality of life. The clinical studies provide limited results in favor of a general harmlessness of oats for celiac disease patients. Patients with celiac disease who consume oats (20-25 g/d for children, 50-70 g/d for adults) need proper follow-up.},

   abstract = {BACKGROUND: A recently devised tool, the celiac disease-specific quality of life scale has been proposed to assess specifically quality of life in celiac patients. AIM: To assess the validity and reliability of the Italian translation of the celiac disease-specific quality of life scale. METHODS: The celiac disease-specific quality of life scale underwent forward/backward translation. Adults patients on gluten free diet by at least one year, consecutively recruited, completed SF36 questionnaire, the Italian version of celiac disease-specific quality of life scale, the health related quality of life question and an abdominal pain scale. The study fulfilled criteria for acceptable psychometric assessment according to the International Quality of Life Assessment project. RESULTS: Two-hundred-thirty celiac patients were recruited after about nine years from diagnosis. Factor analysis indicates that there are some similarities and discrepancies between the English and the Italian questionnaires. Despite this, the Italian celiac disease-specific quality of life scale was able to identify the same four factors characterizing the patients' answers (dysphoria, limitations, health concerns, inadequate treatment). CONCLUSION: The celiac disease-specific quality of life scale is useful for assessing celiac disease-related quality of life. A wide use of the Italian celiac disease-specific quality of life scale may be of help in obtaining comparable data on QOL in different setting and countries.},

   abstract = {BACKGROUND: Celiac disease (CD) is a chronic gluten-sensitive enteropathy. Life-long gluten-free diet (GFD) is the only therapeutic option; however, it may contribute to the consumption of an unbalanced diet. The present study aimed to evaluate the dietary intake of CD affected children on a GFD and compare it with non-celiac children and with Italian nutritional intakes recommendations, as well as evaluate the contribution of commercially available gluten-free products (GFPs). METHODS: Eighteen celiac children, median age 7.6 years, median GFD duration 4.2 years, and 18 non-celiac controls, were enrolled in a cross-sectional age-matched study. Dietary intakes of both groups were collected using a food frequency questionnaire and a 24-hour dietary recall. Nutritional intakes were compared between the group and controls and with Italian dietary reference values. The contribution of GFPs to energy and macronutrient intakes was evaluated. RESULTS: Median energy intake was significantly higher in CD patients than in controls (8961.8 and 5761.0 kJ day(-1); P < 0.001). CD subjects showed higher carbohydrate intakes and lower fat intakes compared to controls. Protein-derived energy did not differ. By contrast to control subjects, energy derived from carbohydrate intakes in CD children met the Italian recommendations. Both children groups showed higher protein and fat intakes than recommended in Italy. GFPs consumption accounted for 36.3% of daily total energy intake. CONCLUSIONS: Intakes of simple sugars, fats and protein exceeded the National recommendations for health. Children with CD had significantly higher energy intakes than controls, although body mass index was comparable across the groups. Lack of nutritional information for GFPs prevented complete dietary analysis of subfractions of fat and micronutrient intakes. This aspect need to be addressed if studies in this field are to be meaningful in the future.},

   abstract = {OBJECTIVE: To assess the association between seroconversion and catch-up growth during the first year of a gluten-free diet (GFD) program in children with celiac disease (CD). METHODS: All prepubertal and biopsy-proven children diagnosed with CD between January 1999 and August 2009 were included in a retrospective study (n=55). Growth parameters and celiac antibodies were documented before and after 6 (period 1) and 12 months (period 2) of GFD, respectively. RESULTS: Mean height velocity-standard deviation score (SDS) was significantly higher in period 1 compared with that in period 2 (2.90 +/- 3.20 vs. 0.20 +/- 2.08, p<0.001) irrespective of the serology status, with marginal difference in mean weight-SDS gain (p=0.074). Mean levels of height velocity-SDS and the weight-SDS gain were similar in the seropositive and seronegative groups in both periods of the study. Mean height-SDS and weight-SDS levels after 6 months were higher than those in baseline levels, both in seropositive (-0.47 +/- 0.91 vs. -0.82 +/- 0.82, p<0.001 and -0.59 +/- 1.17 vs. -1.11 +/- 1.33, p<0.001, respectively) and seronegative patients (-1.02 +/- 1.14 vs. -1.50 +/- 1.12, p<0.001 and -1.19 +/- 1.27 vs. -1.45 +/- 1.40, p=0.048, respectively). These growth parameters were higher at the end compared with the beginning of period 2, but only in seropositive patients. CONCLUSIONS: The most remarkable catch-up growth in children with CD can be expected during the first 6 months of GFD, irrespective of the serology status.},
