   abstract = {Ulcerative colitis and Crohn disease may present before the age of 20 years in 25% to 30% of all patients with inflammatory bowel disease. Reported incidence figures vary considerably depending on the collection of data. Multicenter, multinational collaboration is needed when studying pediatric inflammatory bowel disease. The essential first step is uniformity in the work-up and criteria used for diagnosis. The Porto diagnostic criteria presented here provide the tool that is needed. These criteria are the result of consensus reached by the ESPGHAN inflammatory bowel disease working group. Diagnosis of Crohn disease, ulcerative colitis and indeterminate colitis is based on clinical signs and symptoms, endoscopy and histology and radiology. Every child suspected of inflammatory bowel disease should undergo a complete diagnostic program consisting of colonoscopy with ileal intubation, upper gastrointestinal endoscopy and (in all cases except in definite ulcerative colitis) radiologic contrast imaging of the small bowel. Multiple biopsies from all segments of the gastrointestinal tract are needed for a complete histologic evaluation. A diagnosis of indeterminate colitis cannot be made unless a full diagnostic program has been performed.},

   abstract = {Growth retardation and delay in sexual maturation are the major complications of child-onset Crohn's disease (CD). Nutritional assessment and monitoring should comprise: weight and height measurement with calculation of respective velocities (growth velocity should be > or = 4-5 cm/year during the prepubertal period); pubertal staging; dietetic evaluation; laboratory analysis for mineral, vitamin and trace element deficiencies; bone age. At diagnosis, weight loss and growth delay are present in 80-90% and 1/3 of cases, respectively. In case of an acute flare-up in a CD child with normal nutritional status, nutritional therapy is limited to oral feeding, with a caloric intake at least equal to recommended dietary allowances for age and sex. A low-fiber diet is advised in case of small bowel stenosis. No diet has been shown as efficient in the long-term maintenance of remission. Exclusive enteral nutrition (EN) is an alternative to corticosteroids for the treatment of an acute flare-up of CD, especially in case of malnutrition. Prolonged nocturnal EN is of great interest for the treatment of growth retardation and delay of sexual maturation and in case of steroid-dependent or steroid-refractory CD. In case of steroid-dependent CD with no delay of growth and/or sexual maturation, immunomodulating agents are nowadays an alternative to long-term EN. Efficacy of polymeric solutions is identical to that of semi-elemental or elemental solutions. Parenteral nutrition is limited to an acute flare-up with resistance to medical treatment and/or EN, and contraindications to surgery; occlusion or fistula; short bowel syndrome.},

Here, we present a case of a 30-year-old Filipino woman who presented with symptoms mimicking inflammatory bowel disease. A barium enema and colonoscopy demonstrated a stricture in the rectosigmoid region. A biopsy revealed granulomatous changes indicative of inflammatory bowel disease. Despite initial improvement of her symptoms on total parenteral nutrition and steroids, the patient relapsed several weeks later with recurrent left lower quadrant pain. A subsequent biopsy revealed poorly differentiated signet-ring cell carcinoma of the colon. She was treated surgically with a left hemi-colectomy and primary repair. A high degree of suspicion is necessary to correctly diagnose these, often young, patients with primary signet-ring cell carcinoma early and have a positive impact on survival.

   abstract = {Data supporting a response to treatment with exclusive enteral nutrition in pediatric colonic Crohn's disease are few. We examined clinical and biochemical responses of ileal, colonic, and ileocolonic Crohn's disease and assessed the endoscopic and histological colonic mucosal response in the colonic and ileocolonic groups. We prospectively enrolled 65 children (age: 8-17 years) with acute intestinal Crohn's disease (Pediatric Crohn's Disease Activity Index [PCDAI] >20). After ileocolonoscopy, gastroscopy, and a barium meal and follow-through, they were distributed into three groups (ileal, n = 12, ileocolonic, n = 39; and colonic, n = 14). All patients received exclusive polymeric feed as treatment, with a repeat endoscopy at completion of treatment. At enrollment the ileal group had significantly less severe disease (P = 0.05) compared to the colonic and ileocolonic groups. However, the colonic disease group showed the least fall in PCDAI scores at completion of treatment with enteral nutrition (P = 0.03), with the lowest remission rate (50%, vs 82.1% in the ileocolonic and 91.7% in the ileal group [chi2 test, P = 0.021]). Endoscopic and histologic colonic mucosal assessment showed a post-treatment improvement in the ileocolonic (P < or = 0.01) but not in the colonic disease group (P = ns). Children with disease in the colon respond better to enteral nutrition if the ileum is also involved. This may be due to different underlying inflammatory mechanisms. Detailed pretreatment assessment in studies of Crohn's disease according to disease distribution with appropriate individualized tailoring of treatment may be important in this regard.},

   abstract = {Few of the studied genes demonstrate association with inflammatory bowel disease (IBD). Three mutations in the nucleotide-binding oligomerization domain 2 gene have consistently shown to be independent risk factors for Crohn's disease, but none of the alleles exhibited high sensitivity or specificity for IBD. Linkage analysis implicated several loci on various chromosomes, and epistasis has been demonstrated. The etiopathogenesis of IBD remains unknown, and environmental contribution to their pathogenesis is evident from genetic studies that demonstrated incomplete monozygotic twins concordandance rate for both Crohn's and ulcerative colitis. Smoking has shown an opposite effect on disease phenotype, with an adverse effect on disease course for Crohn's disease, but a slight beneficial effect in ulcerative colitis. The contribution of infectious agents to susceptibility to IBD appears to be strong. However, the role of nutrition on the etiology and therapy of IBD is not clear. Inconsistencies in environmental risk factors could be due to gene-environment interactions, making it essential to study the role of genetics and environmental contribution to the etiopathology of IBD. Transgenic or knockout mice, such as interleukin-10(-/-), T-cell receptor alpha(-/-), Galphai(2) (-/-) and N-cadherin(-/-), develop colitis-like inflammation similar to humans. Therefore, animal models must be further studied to explore mechanistic interactions.},

   abstract = {Infliximab is a monoclonal antibody that targets TNF-alpha and has been shown to be effective for the management of steroid-dependent or refractory Crohn's disease. It is an effective therapy in adult patients, but experience in children is limited. We report a case of Crohn's disease which was refractory to the conventional treatment. A 14-year-old boy was admitted to the hospital with arthralgia and oral and perianal lesions. On physical examination his body weight was below the 3rd percentile, and height was between the 3rd-10th percentiles. He had elevated erythrocyte sedimentation rate and C-reactive protein and decreased hemoglobin, hematocrit and albumin levels. Barium enema and computerized abdominal tomography revealed a markedly distended small bowel with a narrowed area just above the ileocecal valve and terminal ileum. There was no mucosal pathology in his colonoscopic study. A regimen of prednisolone was begun with a diagnosis of Crohn's disease. In the first month of therapy the patient experienced progressive worsening of his symptoms, and azathioprine was added to the treatment in the second month. As he had exacerbation of his symptoms and worsening laboratory tests, infliximab infusions (5 mg/kg/d) were administered intravenously (at 0, 2 and 6 weeks) at the end of the 8th week. At the 6th week of treatment including two infusions of infliximab at 0 and 2 weeks, clinical and laboratory response occurred. The only side effect of the treatment was pneumonia, which was seen after the 6th week of the therapy. In conclusion, infliximab appears to be an effective and safe therapy for childhood refractory Crohn's disease.},

The aim of this study was to determine the effect of exclusive enteral nutrition, which is increasingly being used as primary therapy for CD, on plasma antioxidant concentrations in children with active CD. METHODS: In a double-blind randomised controlled trial, 15 children with active CD (mean age, 11.3 years, range 6.8-15.7) attending a paediatric gastroenterology referral centre, were assigned to receive either a standard polymeric diet (Group S, n=8) or a glutamine-enriched polymeric diet (Group G, n=7) as primary therapy for active CD. Plasma concentrations of selenium, urates, vitamin A, vitamin E, vitamin C, glutathione, and also malondialdehyde (MDA) were measured at baseline and after 4 weeks of exclusive enteral nutritional treatment. RESULTS: Mean (95% CI) selenium concentration of the cohort increased significantly from 0.82 micromol/l (0.72, 0.91) to 1.14 micromol/l (0.98, 1.3), P<0.001. There were, however, significant reductions in mean concentrations of vitamin C {11.8 mg/l (7.7, 15.8) to 6.5 mg/l (4.5, 8.7), P=0.01} and vitamin E {11.3 mg/l (10.3, 12.4) to 9.4 mg/l (8.7, 10.1), P=0.03}. The concentrations of vitamin A, urates, glutathione and MDA did not change significantly over the study period. Glutamine supplementation did not have any significant effect on plasma antioxidant concentrations. CONCLUSIONS: Significant changes in circulating antioxidant concentrations occurred in children with active CD receiving exclusive enteral nutritional treatment. Glutamine supplementation was not beneficial in improving plasma antioxidant status.},

   abstract = {BACKGROUND AND OBJECTIVES: Many Crohn's disease (CD) patients develop complications (fistulae and abscesses), and require surgery, often repeatedly and at variable instances. Identifying serological markers that determine their early or repeated manifestation can enable implementing more aggressive preventive strategies. Our objective was to study the ability of serological markers for predicting development of early (first) and recurrent complications or requirement for surgery. METHODS: Serum anti-Saccharomyces cervisiae (ASCA) (IgA & IgG) and perinuclear antineutrophil cytoplasmic antibodies (pANCA) were assayed close to diagnosis in a pediatric cohort of CD patients identified between 1996 and 1998. At diagnosis and follow-up, information was acquired on demographic and clinical features of disease. Relation between ASCA and clinical events was studied using adjusted Cox-proportional hazards modeling. The relative rates of recurrent clinical events according to the marker measures were compared. RESULTS: The mean age (SD) at diagnosis was 11.2 (3.4) yr. Among 139 patients, 35 (25.9%) and 31 (22.3%) acquired one or more CD related surgery or complication, respectively. Time to occurrence of the first complication was lower among patients ASCA+ (IgA or IgG) (hazards ratio (HR) = 2.33; 95% confidence interval (CI) = 0.99-5.50) and among those with higher ASCA-IgA titers (HR = 1.20; 95% CI = 1.08-1.34). The rates of recurrent complications were higher among those positive or with higher ASCA titers. ASCA did not predict time to undergoing surgery independent of complications, and was unrelated to the occurrence of recurrent surgeries. CONCLUSIONS: Our study shows that serum ASCA measured close to diagnosis can determine the occurrence of early complications in pediatric CD. Preventive treatment targeted toward these susceptible patients could potentially modify the disease course.},

Therefore, the aim of study was to assess outcome after ileo-colic resections for Crohn's disease with multimodal rehabilitation. MATERIALS AND METHODS: Thirty-two consecutive ileo-colic resections for Crohn's disease in 29 patients received epidural analgesia and enforced postoperative oral nutrition and mobilization with a scheduled stay of 2 days. RESULTS: Median time to defaecation was 2.5 days and postoperative hospital stay was 3 days. During a 30-day postoperative follow-up there was two re-admissions, one for mechanical bowel obstruction (9 days) and one because of fever and vomiting (6 days). Except for one wound abscess, one cystitis and one pneumonia, no other complications occurred. CONCLUSION: Fast-track multimodal rehabilitation in open ileo-colic resections for Crohn's disease reduces hospital stay and with low morbidity and readmission rate.},

We evaluated changes in serum selenoprotein-P levels in patients with inflammatory bowel disease. METHODS: Serum selenoprotein-P levels were measured by enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay. Twenty healthy individuals (controls), 34 patients with ulcerative colitis, and 37 patients with Crohn's disease (CD) were studied. RESULTS: A highly significant correlation was found between the serum selenium and selenoprotein-P levels. There was no significant difference in serum selenoprotein-P levels between healthy controls (average 3.4+/-0.8 microg/mL, n=20) and patients with ulcerative colitis (3.0+/-1.0 microg/mL, n=34). Serum selenoprotein-P levels were significantly lower in patients with CD (average 1.8+/-0.5 microg/mL, n=37). Serum selenoprotein-P levels were significantly lower in the elemental diet group of patients who had CD (average 1.4+/-0.4 microg/mL, n=17) than in the non-elemental diet group of patients who had CD (average 2.1+/-0.3 microg/mL, n=20). CONCLUSION: We found that the serum selenoprotein-P level is decreased in patients with CD. It may be a useful marker to monitor the systemic selenium status in various disorders.},

She had been dependent on vascular access for total parenteral nutrition for 16 years. Due to intravascular complications after numerous long-term central venous catheters, her vascular accessibility became limited. During the course of a year she was fed enterally through a gastrostomy, but required supplementary fluid therapy through peripheral venous route. Because of extremely limited venous access, we decided to implant an intraperitoneal catheter for administration of crystalloid fluid. The first intraperitoneal catheter had to be removed because of a postoperative infection, but after antibiotic treatment, a second intraperitoneal catheter was implanted without complications, through which the patient is now fully provided with crystalloid fluid (Ringer's acetate). Abdominal ultrasound examination shows good absorption of the fluid, and for the first time in 16 years the patient does not need intravascular access. We suggest that intraperitoneal administration of fluid may be an alternative for patients with limited vascular access.},

   abstract = {BACKGROUND AND AIMS: Resistance to activated protein C (APCR) caused by the Leiden mutation to factor V is the most common cause of inherited thrombosis. Patients with inflammatory bowel disease (IBD) are considered to have an increased risk of thromboembolic complications, and the role of APCR as a cause has previously been investigated. In this study, we investigated if APCR was associated with non-thrombotic morbidities in IBD. PATIENTS/METHODS: Of 951 patients asked to participate, 389 agreed by returning a signed informed consent and filled questionnaire and took the blood test for APCR. Self-reported IBD-related surgery was used as a rough indicator for increased morbidity. RESULTS: APCR was present in 6.6% of patients with Crohn's disease (CD; 10/152) and in 12.7% of ulcerative colitis (UC) patients (30/237). The difference of 6.1% is significant (p=0.039). Among patients with CD and APCR, 9 out of 10 had had surgery, significantly more than among those without APCR (81/142). In patients with UC and APCR, 10 out of 30 had had surgery, still significantly more than in those without APCR (36/207). For the whole group of IBD patients, APCR is associated with a significantly increased risk for thrombosis (p=0.0018), and for the UC group (8/28) p=0.0029, but not for the CD patients alone (2/9), p=0.2323. No other significant differences could be shown for parameters normally related to increased morbidity. CONCLUSIONS: APCR in IBD was associated with an increased frequency of IBD-related surgery, which may warrant screening for APCR in therapy-resistant IBD. In patients with APCR, it may be more difficult and/or important to control inflammation.},

   abstract = {OBJECTIVE: To assess the incidence and location at diagnosis of inflammatory bowel disease in children and adolescents in northern France between 1988 and 1999. METHODS: A 12-year prospective population-based study was conducted by gastroenterologists and pediatric gastroenterologists of northern France (1,312,141 children <17 years of age). RESULTS: From 1988 to 1999, 509 cases of childhood inflammatory bowel disease were recorded (7.2% of all inflammatory bowel disease cases in Northern France): 367 Crohn disease, 122 ulcerative colitis and 20 indeterminate colitis. The mean standardized incidence was 3.1/10(5) for inflammatory bowel disease as a whole (2.3 for Crohn disease, 0.8 for ulcerative colitis and 0.12 for indeterminate colitis). Crohn disease location at diagnosis was: small bowel and colon (71%), colon only (10%) and small bowel only (19%). Location of initial ulcerative colitis was: proctitis (11%), left colitis (57%) and pancolitis (32%). Although ulcerative colitis incidence remained stable (0.8), Crohn disease incidence increased from 2.1 in 1988 to 1990 to 2.6 in 1997 to 1999 (P = 0.2). CONCLUSIONS: The incidence of Crohn disease in the children of northern France showed an increasing trend (20%; not significant) during the 12-year period while the incidence of ulcerative colitis remained stable. In the entire population(children and adults)the incidence of Crohn disease increased significantly (+23%; P < 0.001), while the incidence of ulcerative colitis decreased (-17%; P < 0.0001).},

   abstract = {OBJECTIVES: We evaluated how our use of thiopurines was altered by determination of thiopurine methyltransferase (TPMT) level and drug dose adjustment guided by a 6-mercaptopurine metabolite assay. We further examined whether these resulted in better selection of the drug dose, improved control of disease, and decreased corticosteroid use in pediatric inflammatory bowel disease (IBD). PATIENTS AND METHODS: This is a retrospective review of 101 pediatric patients with IBD receiving a stable dose of azathioprine (AZA) for 4 months or longer. The study group (n = 64) consisted of patients who received AZA and had metabolite levels measured. The comparison group (n = 37) consisted of patients who were receiving AZA before the availability of metabolite measurement. The TPMT level was measured in study group patients before starting AZA. RESULTS: Patients with normal TPMT level received a higher starting dose of AZA than in patients who were heterozygous for TPMT deficiency (1.7 vs 0.9 mg/[kg x d], P < 0.0001). Study group patients received a higher starting dose (1.6 vs 1.2 mg/[kg x d], P = 0.001) and a higher final dose of AZA (2.4 vs 1.7 mg/[kg x d], P < 0.0001) compared with patients in the comparison group. These patients also had more dose adjustments (0.8 vs 0.4 mg/kg, P < 0.002). The number of disease exacerbations per patient per year was 55% less in the study group (95% CI, 17%-76%, P < 0.0001). The study group patients received less prednisone (P < 0.0001) and had lower disease activity scores (P < 0.05). There was no difference between groups in infliximab use or surgery rate. CONCLUSIONS: Azathioprine dose adjustment using a 6-mercaptopurine metabolite assay was associated with use of higher doses, improved control of disease and decreased corticosteroid use in pediatric patients with IBD.},

AIMS: To investigate the efficacy of nutritional therapy using three different formulas versus corticosteroids to achieve clinical remission as well as to induce intestinal mucosal healing in active Crohn's disease children. Duration of remission and effect on growth recovery were also assessed. PATIENTS AND METHODS: Clinical, laboratory, endoscopic and histological data of all new diagnosed active Crohn's disease paediatric cases were retrospectively recorded and reviewed. Thirty-seven children (median age 12.1 years) received nutritional therapy (12 polymeric; 13 semi-elemental; 12 elemental diet) and 10 subjects (median age 12.4 years) received corticosteroids. RESULTS: Similar clinical remission rate were observed after 8 weeks of treatment: 86.5% children receiving nutritional therapy versus 90% treated with corticosteroids. Improvement in mucosal inflammation occurred in 26 out of 37 (64.8%) patients on nutritional therapy and in 4 out of 10 (40%) children on steroids (p < 0.05). Finally, seven subjects on nutritional therapy and none on corticosteroids achieved complete mucosal healing (p < 0.005) at the end of the treatment. Nutritional therapy was more effective than corticosteroids in improving nutritional status and linear growth recovery. Compared to corticosteroids, the duration of clinical remission was longer in the nutritional therapy groups without differences among the three different formulas. CONCLUSIONS: In children with active Crohn's disease, nutritional therapy is more effective than corticosteroids to improve intestinal inflammation and to maintain a more sustained clinical remission.},

   abstract = {It is estimated that of the >1 million individuals in the United States with inflammatory bowel disease (IBD), approximately 100,000 are children. IBD that begins in childhood affects the individual at a critical period of growth and development. Children with Crohn's disease and ulcerative colitis may experience complications such as growth failure, school absence, and depression. In addition, because children with IBD have fewer environmental confounders such as smoking, children may be an excellent population to study microbial and immune interactions. Despite these opportunities, the discipline of pediatric IBD investigation is still in its infancy. In September of 2005, a group of investigators with expertise in pediatric IBD met in Boston (Massachusetts) to review the current status of childhood IBD research and to develop research priorities that warranted funding from the Crohn's and Colitis Foundation of America. The group included pediatricians, internists, basic scientists, clinical investigators, and members of the administrative staff and board of the Crohn's and Colitis Foundation of America. The research needs in respective areas were outlined by the heads of 10 focus groups, each with expertise in their respective fields (genetics, psychosocial issues, epidemiology, microbiology, immunology, quality improvement, pharmacogenomics, nutrition, growth and skeletal health, and clinical trials). Before the conference, heads of the research focus groups developed their proposals with experts in the field. At the end of the conference, members of the focus groups and members of the steering committee rated the proposed areas of study in terms of feasibility and importance. It was recommended that the Crohn's and Colitis Foundation of America focus its initial efforts in pediatric IBD in 5 areas: the effects of inflammation on growth and skeletal development, the genetics of early-onset IBD, the development of quality improvement interventions to standardize and improve clinical care of children with IBD, the immunology of childhood IBD, and the diagnosis and treatment of psychosocial sequelae of childhood IBD. At the conclusion of the meeting, investigators discussed the formation of a multicenter collaborative network to advance clinical and basic research in the field.},

The aim of this prospective study was to analyze the effects of an education program in patients with inflammatory bowel disease. METHODS: 145 patients with inflammatory bowel disease were prospectively included: 73 were educated in four sessions, 72 were educated after the one year evaluation period (control group). The following topics were presented: pathogenesis, diagnostic procedures, course of disease, medical and surgical treatment, nutrition, social problems and support, stress management, and coping with the disease. RESULTS: The repeated measurement two-way analysis of variances showed no effects of the patient education program on disease-related knowledge, depression and quality of life. CONCLUSION: This patient education program was not able to increase disease-related knowledge or psychosocial variables in patients with IBD. However, most of the patients were very satisfied with the education program, since as judged by their own assessment it helped them to act responsibly for themselves and their disease.},

OBJECTIVES: To determine factors predictive of surgery for perforation in Crohn's disease and define a group of patients that may benefit from non-surgical treatment. METHODS: One hundred and sixty-two patients (69 males, 93 females, mean age 39) with perforated Crohn's disease (fistula, abscess, inflammatory mass) between January 1995 and September 2003 were studied retrospectively. RESULTS: One hundred and fifty-one patients (93%) underwent surgery: 70 had planned surgery and 81 had surgery for symptomatic deterioration. At two years, the cumulative probability of intestinal resection was 0.89 +/- 0.03, and the cumulative probability of unplanned intestinal resection was 0.72 +/- 0.05. Predictive factors of unplanned surgery were elevated platelet count (adjusted hazard ratio 3.15; 95% CI 2.21-4.50) and absence of fistula (adjusted hazard ratio 3.14; 95% CI 2.48-3.99). The rate of postoperative complications, the need for a stoma, and the length of bowel resection were not significantly different whether the surgery was planned or not. CONCLUSION: A significant proportion of patients with intestinal perforation complicating Crohn's disease, particularly those with a fistula, might benefit from non-surgical treatment.},

   abstract = {Adherent and invasive Escherichia coli (AIEC) bacteria isolated from Crohn's disease patients are able to greatly replicate within macrophages without escaping from the phagosome and without inducing macrophage death. In the present study, evidence is provided that in AIEC strain LF82 the htrA gene encoding the stress protein HtrA is essential for intracellular replication within J774-A1 macrophages. Deletion of the htrA gene in strain LF82 induced increased sensitivity of the isogenic mutant to oxidative stress caused by hydrogen peroxide and a reduced rate of growth in an acid and nutrient-poor medium partly reproducing the microenvironment of the phagosome. In vitro experiments using an LF82 htrA gene promoter fusion with the lacZ gene revealed a 38-fold activation of the promoter in AIEC LF82 intramacrophagic bacteria. The CpxRA two-component signaling pathway was not involved in this activation. In addition, the activation of the LF82 htrA gene promoter was not observed in the nonpathogenic E. coli K-12 intramacrophagic bacteria, indicating that the AIEC LF82 genetic background is crucial for induction of htrA gene transcription during phagocytosis.},

   abstract = {OBJECTIVES: Indeterminate intestinal inflammation may result from a variety of inflammatory conditions in addition to ulcerative colitis and Crohn disease. The primary systemic vasculitides may present with intestinal inflammation and an indeterminate colitis. We set out to describe a series of children with primary systemic vasculitis who initially presented with clinical features suggestive of inflammatory bowel disease (IBD) to establish criteria that might help discriminate between IBD and primary systemic vasculitis. METHODS: Ten children (6 boys, median age at presentation 8.9 years, range 0.9-14.5 years) satisfied inclusion criteria. RESULTS: All had abdominal pain, weight loss, diarrhea (6 of 10 bloody) and laboratory evidence of a severe acute phase response. Extraintestinal clinical features included vasculitic rash, renal impairment, myalgia, testicular pain and polyarthritis. Endoscopy showed vascular changes or other macroscopic findings suggestive of vasculitis in 5 of 10 patients. Gut histology revealed indeterminate chronic inflammatory mucosal changes and one patient with small artery fibrinoid necrosis in the submucosal vessels. Extraintestinal biopsy was performed in 6 patients and had a higher yield for the demonstration of vasculitis than intestinal biopsy. The results of selective visceral angiography was suggestive of vasculitis in all patients, but was normal in 7 cases of treatment-unresponsive classic IBD. Treatment comprised corticosteroid and azathioprine in all patients. Cyclophosphamide was given to 7 of 10 patients. CONCLUSIONS: Extraintestinal manifestations and inflammatory responses that may be disproportionate to the degree of intestinal inflammation provide clues to the presence of an underlying primary systemic vasculitis, and these data suggest that selective visceral angiography plays a key role in the diagnosis of vasculitis in this context. It is important to identify and treat any vasculitic component because failure to do so may result in consequential morbidity or mortality.},

   abstract = {Crohn's disease (CD) is a multifactorial disorder of unknown cause. Outstanding progress regarding the pathophysiology of CD has led to the development of innovative therapeutic concepts. Numerous controlled trials have been performed in CD over the last years. However, many drugs have not been approved by regulatory authorities due to lack of efficacy or severe side effects. Therefore, well-known drugs, including 5-ASA, systemic or topical corticosteroids, and immunosuppressants such as azathioprine, are still the mainstay of CD therapy. Importantly, biologicals such as infliximab have shown to be efficacious in problematic settings such as fistulizing or steroid-dependent CD. This review is intended to give practical guidelines to clinicians for the conventional treatment of CD. We concentrated on the results of randomized, placebo-controlled trials and meta-analyses, when available, that provide the highest degree of evidence. We provide evidence-based treatment algorithms whenever possible. However, many clinical situations have not been answered by controlled clinical trials and it is important to fill these gaps through expert opinions. We hope that this review offers a useful tool for clinicians in the challenging treatment of CD.},

   abstract = {T lymphocyte-mediated pathogenesis is common to a variety of enteropathies, including giardiasis, cryptosporidiosis, bacterial enteritis, celiac's disease, food anaphylaxis, and Crohn's disease. In giardiasis as well as in these other disorders, a diffuse loss of microvillous brush border, combined or not with villus atrophy, is responsible for disaccharidase insufficiencies and malabsorption of electrolytes, nutrients, and water, which ultimately cause diarrheal symptoms. Other mucosal changes may include crypt hyperplasia and increased infiltration of intra-epithelial lymphocytes. Recent studies using models of giardiasis have shed new light on the immune regulation of these abnormalities. Indeed, experiments using an athymic mouse model of infection have found that these epithelial injuries were T cell-dependent. Findings from further research indicate that that the loss of brush border surface area, reduced disaccharidase activities, and increase crypt-villus ratios are mediated by CD8+ T cells, whereas both CD8+ and CD4+ small mesenteric lymph node T cells regulate the influx of intra-epithelial lymphocytes. Future investigations need to characterize the CD8+ T cell signaling cascades that ultimately lead to epithelial injury and malfunction in giardiasis and other malabsorptive disorders of the intestine.},

   abstract = {BACKGROUND: Crohn disease (CD) in children is associated with low body mass index (BMI), poor growth, and delayed maturation; alterations in lean and fat mass, however, are poorly characterized. OBJECTIVE: The objective was to quantify lean and fat mass in children and young adults with CD and in healthy control subjects, relative to height and pubertal maturation. DESIGN: This cross-sectional study assessed whole-body lean and fat mass by using dual-energy X-ray absorptiometry in 104 subjects with CD and in 233 healthy control subjects aged 4-25 y. Linear regression was used to determine the effect of CD on body composition and to generate sex-specific SD scores (z scores) for lean and fat mass relative to height. RESULTS: Subjects with CD had lower height-for-age and BMI-for-age z scores (P < 0.001 for both) than did control subjects. CD was associated with significant deficits in lean mass after adjustment for height, age, race, and Tanner stage (P = 0.003); deficits in fat mass were not observed. The mean (+/-SD) lean mass-for-height and fat mass-for-height z scores in the subjects with CD were -0.61 +/- 0.92 and -0.04 +/- 0.86, respectively. Within the control group, fat mass-for-height was positively correlated with lean mass-for height (r = 0.41, P < 0.0001); this association was absent in the subjects with CD. CONCLUSIONS: Children and young adults with CD had significant deficits in lean mass but preserved fat mass, which is consistent with cachexia. Further research is needed to identify physical activity, nutritional, and antiinflammatory interventions to improve body composition in persons with CD.},

   abstract = {BACKGROUND: Growth failure frequently complicates Crohn's disease in childhood. Abnormalities in the growth hormone (GH)/insulin-like growth factor-1 axis may occur. The effects of administered GH on growth have not been studied previously in a randomized trial. METHODS: Seven children (6 boys and 1 girl; age, 11.9-16 yr) with Crohn's disease and growth failure were enrolled. In phase 1, patients were randomized to either GH (0.05 mg/kg per day) or placebo; in phase 2, patients who received placebo during the first year received GH for various time periods. Follow-up was every 3 months for up to 2 years. RESULTS: During placebo treatment (4 patients), mean height-for-age z score (haz) increased 0.23 in the first half year and 0.55 in the second half year. The mean improvement in haz during the first half year of GH treatment (7 patients) was 0.13; during the second half year (5 patients), haz decreased 0.01. Effects of GH varied among patients; 2 patients grew only when nutritional supplementation was added. Observed changes were not statistically significant; however, the number of patients studied was small, and statistical analyses could have been affected by sample size. Serum insulin-like growth factor-1 levels correlated with height velocity. Only 2 patients later reached expected adult height. CONCLUSIONS: In this pilot study, GH treatment at the dose given did not stimulate growth in children with Crohn's disease and short stature. Whether or not GH plus nutritional therapy would be effective in promoting sustained catch-up growth remains to be determined.},

METHODS: All children referred for initial assessment of possible IBD were eligible. Patients with symptoms or signs (right-lower quadrant mass, perianal disease, or hematochezia) mandating a complete work-up for IBD were excluded. All enrolled patients underwent a clinical, laboratory, radiographic, and endoscopic evaluation including biopsy examinations. The immunoglobulin (Ig)G and IgA ASCA, IgG pANCA, FC, IP, and BWUS were tested in all patients at the initial assessment. RESULTS: A final diagnosis of IBD was made in 27 patients: 17 Crohn disease and 10 ulcerative colitis. Eighteen children had other gastrointestinal diagnoses (8 functional bowel disorders, 5 food allergy-mediated diseases, 4 infectious enterocolitis, 1 familial Mediterranean fever). In patients with simultaneous abnormal values of FC, BWUS, and ASCA/pANCA, the estimated probability of having IBD was 99.47%. Patients with negative results on all tests had a 0.69% of probability of IBD. CONCLUSIONS: The incorporation of noninvasive diagnostic tests into the initial diagnostic approach may avoid unnecessary invasive procedures and facilitate clinical decision-making when the diagnosis of IBD in children is initially uncertain.},

   abstract = {BACKGROUND: Indeterminate colitis (IC) is a subgroup of inflammatory bowel disease (IBD) that cannot be characterized as either ulcerative colitis (UC) or Crohn's disease (CD). Our aims are to determine the prevalence of IC in our pediatric patient population and to describe its clinical presentation, natural history,and disease distribution. METHODS: We performed a retrospective database analysis of all children diagnosed with IBD at the Johns Hopkins Children's IBD Center between 1996 and 2001. Patient demographics, including age, sex, and age at disease onset, were tallied. Disease distribution was identified on the basis of a review of all endoscopic, colonoscopic, histopathological, and radiological records. All of the patients were followed up clinically to determine the extent of disease progression on the basis of the initial diagnosis of IC. RESULTS: Among 250 children registered in the database, 127 (50.8%) had a diagnosis of CD, 49 (19.6%) had UC, and 74(29.6%) had IC. Patients with IC had a significantly younger mean +/- SEM age (9.53 +/- 4.8 years) at diagnosis compared with patients with CD (12.4 +/- 3.8 years; P < 0.001) but not compared with patients with UC (7.41 +/- 3.5 years). Among the patients with IC, 59 (79.7%) had a pancolitis at diagnosis, and the remaining 15 had left-sided disease that progressed to a pancolitis within a mean of 6 years. Twenty-five patients (33.7%) with an initial diagnosis of IC were reclassified to either CD or UC after a median follow-up of 1.9 years (range 0.6-4.5 years). Forty-nine patients (66.2%) maintained their diagnosis of IC after a mean follow-up of 7 years (SEM 2.5 years). CONCLUSIONS: IC is a distinct pediatric subgroup of IBD with a prevalence that is higher than that observed in adults. Children with IC have an early age of disease onset and a disease that rapidly progresses to pancolitis. Longitudinal studies are needed to determine the clinical implications of this pediatric IBD subgroup.},

   abstract = {INTRODUCTION: Infliximab is a promising advance in the treatment of pediatric inflammatory bowel disease. Infliximab is an effective therapy for selected children with Crohn disease but is both costly and time consuming. OBJECTIVES: To analyze our center's experience with a program of home-based infliximab infusion. METHODS: Between September, 2001, and October, 2003 we reviewed the charts of all children receiving home infliximab infusions focusing on cost, safety, and patient satisfaction. Children were enrolled in the home infusion program if they were compliant with hospital-based infliximab infusions and other medications, had no adverse events during hospital-based infliximab infusions, were in remission and had access to experienced pediatric homecare nursing. RESULTS: Ten children received 59 home infusions with a dose range of 7.5 to 10 mg/kg/dose. The calculated average savings per patient was 1335 US dollar/100 mg infliximab. Home infusions ranged from 2 to 5 hours. Since infusions could be performed any day of the week, school absenteeism was decreased. The average patient satisfaction rating for home infusions was 9 on a scale from 1 to 10 (10 = most satisfied). Three patients experienced difficulty with IV access requiring multiple attempts, but all were able to receive their infusions. One infusion was stopped because of arm pain above the IV site. This patient had his next infusion in the hospital before returning to the home infusion program. No severe adverse events (palpitations, blood pressure instability, hyperemia, respiratory symptoms) occurred during home infusions. CONCLUSIONS: In our carefully selected patients, infliximab infusions administered at home were safe and are cost-effective. Patients and families preferred home infusions, since time missed from school and work was reduced.},

   abstract = {OBJECTIVE: To determine the frequency of anti-Saccharomyces cerevisiae antibodies (ASCA) seropositivity in pediatric patients with cystic fibrosis (CF) and correlate ASCA with clinical features. METHODS: Prospective study of children with CF aged 2 to 21 years enrolled from The Children's Hospital Cystic Fibrosis Center. Exclusion criteria included Crohn disease, immunodeficiency or immunoglobulin A deficiency. The frequency of ASCA (ASCA immunoglobulin A and immunoglobulin G) was measured by an enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay kit provided by Inova, Inc. (San Diego, CA). The CF Foundation database was queried for clinical data on ASCA seropositive patients. RESULTS: Seventeen (20.7%) of 82 patients were seropositive for ASCA. Of these, eight had immunoglobulin A antibodies, six had immunoglobulin G antibodies and three had both. ASCA seropositivity in CF patients was significantly greater than the general population (20.7% versus 4%, P < 0.0001), using an exact binomial test on a single proportion. The 95% confidence limits around our observed proportion were 12.6% to 31.1%. Of 17 ASCA positive patients, 1 (5.8%) had a history of meconium ileus, 14 (82.4%) had DeltaF508 gene mutation, 9 (52.9%) had positive sputum cultures for fungal organisms, and 17 (100%) had an ideal body weight % >or=85%. CONCLUSION: Patients with CF have a higher frequency of ASCA seropositivity than the general population. When evaluating CF patients for Crohn disease, ASCA should be used with caution. The reasons for higher ASCA seropositivity in CF patients are unknown, but may include exposure to fungal organisms via intestinal or pulmonary sources.},

Energy requirements of parenterally fed hospitalized pediatric patients with active CD were measured using indirect calorimetry, to assess whether Food Agriculture Organization (FAO)/World Health Organization (WHO)/United Nations University (UNU) equations provide appropriate estimations of energy requirements in this patient population. METHODS: Twenty hospitalized patients with active CD fed exclusively via parenteral nutrition (PN) were investigated. A chart review and patient interviews were conducted to assess disease duration, location, laboratory parameters, and symptomology associated with CD. Disease severity was quantified using the Pediatric Crohn's Disease Activity Index. Each subject underwent indirect calorimetry, bioelectrical impedance analysis, and anthropometric assessment once the ordered PN met estimated macronutrient requirements of each patient (predicted resting energy expenditure x1.3). Predicted resting energy expenditure (REE) was determined using the FAO/WHO/UNU equations. RESULTS: REE showed a strong correlation with predicted REE (r(2) = .73, p < .01). CONCLUSIONS: Measured REE did not significantly differ from predicted resting energy requirements. This indicates that REE for the parenterally fed pediatric patients with CD can be accurately predicted using the FAO/WHO/UNU equations.},

The aim of this study was to assess the evolution of the need for surgery in Crohn's disease during the last 25 years. PATIENTS AND METHODS: The medical charts of 2573 patients were reviewed retrospectively. The use of immunosuppressants (azathioprine or methotrexate), the need for intestinal resection, and the occurrence of intestinal complications were assessed using Kaplan-Meier analysis in five consecutive cohorts of patients defined by the date of diagnosis of Crohn's disease (1978-82; 1983-87; 1988-92; 1993-97; 1998-2002). RESULTS: In 565 patients seen in the authors' unit within the first three months after diagnosis, characteristics of Crohn's disease at diagnosis did not differ from one cohort to another. The five year cumulative probability to receive immunosuppressants increased from 0 in the 1978-82 cohort to 0.13, 0.25, 0.25, and 0.56 in the 1983-87, 1988-92, 1993-97, and 1998-2002 cohorts, respectively (p<0.001). Concomitantly, the cumulative risk of intestinal resection remained unchanged (from 0.35 to 0.34 at five years; p=0.81). The cumulative risk of developing a stricturing or a penetrating intestinal complication remained also unchanged. Similar results were obtained in the 2008 patients seen during the same period who were referred to us more than three months after diagnosis. CONCLUSION: Although immunosuppressants have been used more frequently over the last 25 years, there was no significant decrease of the need for surgery, or of intestinal complications of Crohn's disease.},

   abstract = {AIM: To determine whether prior appendectomy modifies the phenotype and severity of Crohn's disease. METHODS: Appendectomy status and smoking habits were specified by direct interview in 2838 patients consecutively seen between 1995 and 2004. Occurrence of complications and therapeutic needs were reviewed retrospectively. Additionally, annual disease activity was assessed prospectively between 1995 and 2004 in patients who had not had ileocecal resection and of a matched control group. RESULTS: Compared to 1770 non-appendectomized patients, appendectomized patients more than 5 years before Crohn's disease diagnosis (n=716) were more often females, smokers, with ileal disease. Cox regression showed that prior appendectomy was positively related to the risk of intestinal stricture (adjusted hazard ratio, 1.24; 95% confidence interval, 1.13 to 1.36; P=0.02) and inversely related to the risk of perianal fistulization (adjusted hazard ratio, 0.75; 95% confidence interval, 0.68 to 0.83; P=0.002). No difference was observed between the two groups regarding the therapeutic needs, except for an increased risk of surgery in appendectomized patients, attributable to the increased prevalence of ileal disease. Between 1995 and 2004, Crohn's disease was active during 50% of years in appendectomized patients (1318 out of 2637 patient-years) and 51% in non-appendectomized patients (1454 out of 2841 patient-years; NS). CONCLUSION: Prior appendectomy is associated with a more proximal disease and has an increased risk of stricture and a lesser risk of anal fistulization. However, the severity of the disease is unaffected.},

   abstract = {PURPOSE OF REVIEW: This review will highlight the knowledge gained from studies published in the year 2005 on maintenance treatment after surgery for inflammatory bowel diseases. RECENT FINDINGS: In Crohn's disease the role of smoking in increasing the risk of relapse and recurrence after surgery is confirmed. Ornidazole seems effective in reducing endoscopic recurrence and clinical relapse after surgery. Probiotics do not appear to be effective in preventing endoscopic recurrence and clinical relapse: a controlled placebo trial showed that Lactobacillus johnsonii is not effective in preventing endoscopic recurrence. A retrospective study suggested that enteral nutrition after surgery may reduce the clinical relapse. Pathophysiological studies underlined the value of probiotics in pouchitis. SUMMARY: In Crohn's disease postoperative maintenance treatment is disappointing. Giving up smoking is still the only effective measure. Mesalamine remains the drug that has been widely studied with large trials and meta-analysis. Encouraging results come from small trials on antibiotics. Azathioprine and 6-mercaptopurine must be evaluated in better designed controlled trials. There is no evidence in favour of probiotics as an effective therapy to prevent recurrence. Enteral nutrition after surgery is a candidate new therapy, but further controlled trials are needed. Pathophysiological studies confirm the beneficial role of probiotics in pouchitis.},

An abscess can involve any of the major viscera, including the liver and spleen. CASE REPORT: A 27-year-old male patient with a 6-month history of NOD2/CARD15-positive Crohn's disease with stenosis of the terminal ileum, previously treated with corticosteroids, was admitted with fever, chills, diarrhea, fatigue and cachexia. Diagnostic work-up revealed sepsis, an abscess in the right hepatic lobe, multiple abdominal collections and right-sided pleural effusion. It was felt that his poor general condition prevented surgical intervention and complex conservative treatment was initiated. It consisted of total parenteral nutrition, antibiotics, percutaneous drainage of the liver abscess, and thoracocentesis. Pus and blood cultures showed Lactobacillus acidophilus. There was a gradual improvement in the patient's condition and the liver abscess decreased in diameter from 14 to 2 cm. Aminosalicylates and enteral nutrition were gradually introduced. The patient was discharged after 9 weeks in good general condition. CONCLUSION: Although extremely rarely, L. acidophilus can cause hepatic abscess and sepsis. This can be explained by immunologic incompetence due to corticosteroid treatment of Crohn's disease.},

   abstract = {OBJECTIVES: Inflammatory bowel diseases (IBD) represent an aberrant immune response by the mucosal immune system to luminal bacteria. Because the oral mucosa harbors the first epithelial cells that interact with microorganisms, we assessed the immunologic activity of buccal epithelium in children with IBD and adults with Crohn disease. METHODS: Buccal epithelial cells were obtained from 17 children and 14 adults with Crohn disease, 18 children with ulcerative colitis, and 40 controls. Cells were cultured with and without microbial stimulation. Chemokine levels were determined in culture supernatants by cytometric bead array and enzyme-linked immunoabsorbent assay. CXCL-8 production was studied by immunohistochemical analysis of these cells. CXCL-8 production by lipopolysaccharide stimulated monocyte-derived dendritic cells from these patients was determined. RESULTS: Compared with controls, pediatric ulcerative colitis patients, and adult Crohn disease patients, only in children with Crohn disease did buccal epithelial cells exhibit enhanced production of CXCL-8, CXCL-9, and CXCL-10. In vitro stimulation with lipopolysaccharide or zymosan resulted in a further increase of chemokine levels only in cells from pediatric Crohn disease patients. CXCL-8 production by stimulated monocyte-derived dendritic cells from children with Crohn disease was equal to that of children with ulcerative colitis. CONCLUSIONS: Buccal epithelium of children with Crohn disease is immunologically active, even in the absence of oral lesions. The enhanced chemokine production is associated with pediatric Crohn disease and appears restricted to cells derived from the epithelial barrier. Assessment of chemokine production by buccal epithelial cells may become a new, rapid, noninvasive test for screening and classification of IBD in children.},

OBJECTIVE: The aim of this study was to determine the feasibility of push enteroscopy in children with suspected proximal small bowel disease, and to compare its diagnostic yield and safety with standard endoscopy. DESIGN/SETTING: Database review. PATIENTS: A database analysis was performed on all children who underwent push enteroscopy at The Johns Hopkins Children's Center from 2001 to 2005. Patient demographics, clinical history, and indication for push enteroscopy were all recorded. Clinical utility was qualified based on the influence of PE on therapy. MAIN OUTCOME MEASUREMENTS: Diagnostic yield and safety of push enteroscopy in children. RESULTS: Push enteroscopy was performed on 44 children (27 M; 17 F) with a median age (range) of 10 (2-18) years. The most common indications for push enteroscopy were suspected proximal small bowel disease based on radiological criteria (21), and bleeding (9). Push enteroscopy confirmed the diagnosis of proximal small bowel Crohn's disease (CD) in 23, polyps in 5, eosinophilic gastroenteritis in 4, celiac disease in 1, microvillous inclusion disease in 1, and lymphoproliferative disease in 1 patient. An isolated non-Crohn's related gastric (1) and jejunal ulcer (1) was also identified. Just 9 of these identifiable lesions were within reach by esophagogastroduodenoscopy (EGD). Seven patients had a normal push enteroscopy. The clinical management was modified in 34 patients. Push enteroscopy was not shown to significantly alter the time of procedure when compared to EGD. CONCLUSIONS: Push enteroscopy is a safe diagnostic tool with proven clinical utility in children with suspected proximal small bowel disease. Larger studies are needed to establish the widespread application of push enteroscopy in pediatrics.},

   abstract = {BACKGROUND: Exclusive enteral feeding has been shown to be as efficacious as corticosteroids in inducing remission in children with Crohn's disease (CD), with additional nutritional benefits. The use of polymeric formulae provides superior palatability and acceptance over elemental feeds, but polymeric formulae have not been universally adopted. The present retrospective analysis of enteral feeding in children with Crohn's disease aims to demonstrate the short-term benefits of enteral feeding in children upon disease activity and nutrition parameters. METHODS: The case records of children with CD managed with exclusive enteral nutrition (EEN) by a multidisciplinary team over a 2-year period were reviewed. Data relating to therapy, background disease details, and outcome were collated. Primary outcome measures established were weight change and disease activity (Pediatric Crohn's Disease Activity Index: PCDAI). RESULTS: Twenty-seven children received EEN with polymeric formulae. Fifteen children had newly diagnosed CD and 12 had known long-standing CD. Twenty-four children completed the prescribed period of EEN. Twelve of 15 (80%) newly diagnosed CD and seven of 12 (58%) with long-standing disease entered remission. Children with newly diagnosed CD responding to EEN took all feeds orally and gained an average of 4.7+/-3.5 kg with mean PCDAI decreasing from 37.1+/-10.8 to 6.7+/-5.1 after 8 weeks. In addition, four children continued supplementary polymeric formula (without other medical therapies) and all have maintained remission during an average follow-up period of 15.2 months. CONCLUSION: Exclusive enteral feeds induced remission in 80% of children with newly diagnosed CD (on intention-to-treat basis) when used as sole initial therapy while also improving nutritional status. All newly diagnosed children treated with EEN, who were able to establish feeds, achieved remission. In addition, remission may be prolonged with oral supplementary formula as sole ongoing treatment. Further study of the role(s) of enteral feeds and of longer-term benefits of enteral feeding in children with CD is now required.},

Crohn's disease and coplicated colonic diverticulosis rank second as causal factors. The risk factors for the development of an entero-cutaneous fistula and for the poor prognosis at the same time are the next: (1) Most of the patients suffer of severe main and co-exhisting diseases; (2) The presence of previous laparotomies, radion and chemotherapy, significant disturbances in the base-acid and water-electrolyte balance; (3) The fistula itself worsens these disturbances and may doom to fail the substitutional and nutritional therapy. The diagnostics of a fistula, including its location is comparatively easy. The surgical treatment plays an important role in the therapeutic scheme, especially in cases of high-output fistulas of the small intestin. At the same time the adequate total parenteral nutrition and correction of the base-acid and water-electrolyte disbalance is also very important. Recently there are some new diagnostic methods and alternatives of the basic surgical procedures, some of them quite contraversial.},

Artificial nutrition is effective to both treat malnutrition when present and induce remission. However, striking advances in anti-inflammatory and immunomodulating therapies (including infliximab) and low compliance to treatment in the first trials have limited its place in the management of adults to drug-resistant patients. Randomized controlled trials show that artificial nutrition is effective in >50% of the cases in this selected population. Significant progress has recently been made to improve the palatability (and thus acceptability) of some enteral solutions, which can be consumed by the oral route and as pharmaconutrition. We reviewed the literature on enteral nutrition in adults with Crohn's disease. We present herein the results of the studies performed with antioxidants, glutamine, short-chain fatty acids, prebiotics, probiotics, low microparticle diets, and a TGFbeta2 enriched formulation.},

   abstract = {OBJECTIVES: Patients with Crohn's disease who have terminal ileal resections are at risk for vitamin B12 malabsorption. Our aim was to determine whether the length of terminal ileum resected correlated with an abnormal Schilling test result. METHODS: Patients with a history of ileal resection had the length of small bowel removed determined by review of their pathology report. Patients who had a Schilling test within 3 mo of surgery or who had a documented normal terminal ileum at the time of the Schilling test were included in the study. RESULTS: Fifty-six patients were included in the study. Patients who had <20 cm of terminal ileum resected (n = 14) did not develop abnormal Schilling test results; 52% of the remainder (n = 42) had abnormal Schilling test results and there was no clear correlation between resection length and abnormal Schilling test result. CONCLUSIONS: Patients with Crohn's disease and terminal ileal resections <20 cm are not at risk of developing vitamin B12 deficiency. For patients with resections of 20-60 cm, options include doing a Schilling test and treating those with abnormal results, empirically treating patients on the presumption that they are at high risk of developing deficiency, or monitoring for biochemical evidence of deficiency. Further studies are needed to determine whether oral supplementation is effective in these patients.},

   abstract = {The inflammatory bowel diseases Crohn's disease and ulcerative colitis are common, chronic disorders that cause abdominal pain, diarrhea, and gastrointestinal bleeding. To identify genetic factors that might contribute to these disorders, we performed a genome-wide association study. We found a highly significant association between Crohn's disease and the IL23R gene on chromosome 1p31, which encodes a subunit of the receptor for the proinflammatory cytokine interleukin-23. An uncommon coding variant (rs11209026, c.1142G>A, p.Arg381Gln) confers strong protection against Crohn's disease, and additional noncoding IL23R variants are independently associated. Replication studies confirmed IL23R associations in independent cohorts of patients with Crohn's disease or ulcerative colitis. These results and previous studies on the proinflammatory role of IL-23 prioritize this signaling pathway as a therapeutic target in inflammatory bowel disease.},

METHODS: Trinitrobenzene sulfonic acid colitis was used to induce colitis in mice lacking each of the TNF receptors (TNFRs) and in wild-type mice. TNFR1-/- mice lost more weight, became hypothermic, and had increased mortality compared with wild-type C57Bl/6 mice. TNFR2-/- mice, however, lost less weight, had normal temperatures, and had improved survival. RESULTS: Despite the improved clinical outcomes in TNFR2-/- mice, TNFalpha levels were increased in these mice. CONCLUSIONS: TNFalpha signaling through TNFR1 is protective in the trinitrobenzene sulfonic acid mouse model of inflammatory bowel disease.},

This study evaluates short- and long-term efficacy of infliximab in children with ulcerative colitis. METHODS: All pediatric patients with ulcerative colitis who received infliximab between July 2001 and November 2003 at the Johns Hopkins Children's Center were identified. Short- and long-term outcomes and adverse reactions were evaluated. RESULTS: Twelve pediatric patients with ulcerative colitis received infliximab for treatment of fulminant colitis (3 patients), acute exacerbation of colitis (3), steroid-dependent colitis (5), and steroid-refractory colitis (1). Nine patients had a complete short-term response, and 3 had partial improvement. The mean per patient dose of corticosteroid after the first infliximab infusion decreased from 45 mg/day at the first infusion to 22.2 mg/day at 4 weeks (P = 0.02) and 7.8 mg/day at 8 weeks (P = 0.008). Eight patients were classified as long-term responders with a median follow-up time of 10.4 months. Of the 4 long-term nonresponders, 3 underwent colectomy, and the fourth has ongoing chronic symptoms. Three of 4 long-term nonresponders were steroid-refractory compared with 1 of 8 long-term responders. Patients receiving 6-mercaptopurine had a better response to infliximab. CONCLUSION: Infliximab should be considered in the treatment of children with symptoms of acute moderate to severe ulcerative colitis.},

   abstract = {OBJECTIVE: Catabolism and growth impairment are well-known complications of inflammatory bowel disease (IBD). This may be caused by the disease activity itself and/or the medical treatment, and both may lead to changes in the growth hormone (GH)/insulin-like growth factor I (IGF-I) axis. The aim of the present study was to examine the effects of enteral nutrition, Impact Powder, as adjuvant therapy to corticosteroid treatment on changes in the GH/IGF-I axis in patients with Crohn's disease (CD). MATERIAL AND METHODS: The patients were randomized to 3-IP (omega-3-fatty acid (FA), 3 g/day) or 6-IP (omega-6-FA, 9 g/day). Changes in total IGF-I (tIGF-I) and total IGF-II (tIGF-II), free IGF-I (fIGF-I), IGF binding proteins (IGFBP-1 and IGFBP-3), IGFBP-3 protease activity and insulin levels were examined in 31 patients with active CD (CDAI: 186-603) during treatment with prednisolone (40 mg for 1 week) and tapering the dose by 5 mg/week. Clinical and biochemical markers of inflammation were studied at day 0, and after 5 and 9 weeks. RESULTS: There were no differences at baseline between the two groups. During the treatment period, tIGF-I, fIGF-I and IGFBP-3 increased significantly in both groups compared to baseline (p<0.05) without differences between the groups. Insulin and IGFBP-1 showed no significant changes throughout the treatment period. CONCLUSIONS: There was no difference between 3-IP and 6-IP as adjuvant enteral nutrition on the GH/IGF-I axis. The changes observed in the GH/IGF-I axis are in line with previously published studies and may be explained by corticosteroid treatment; however, we cannot exclude an additional effect of omega3-/omega6 FA as adjuvant enteral nutrition.},

   abstract = {OBJECTIVE: The aim of this study was to elucidate the predictive value of intra-operative enteroscopy (IOE) and the effect of enteral nutrition (EN) with regard to the postoperative recurrence of Crohn disease (CD). MATERIAL AND METHODS: Forty patients requiring surgery for severe intestinal complications of CD were examined by IOE, and the severity of the remnant small intestine was determined. Patients were subclassified into either an EN group (>1,200 kcal/day) or a non-EN group (<1,200 kcal/day) according to the amount of daily EN intake after surgery. Contributions of IOE findings and EN to postoperative recurrence were analysed retrospectively. RESULTS: IOE identified intestinal lesions in 39 patients and active intestinal lesions in 24 patients. The cumulative rate of postoperative recurrence was significantly higher in patients with cobblestone appearance confirmed by IOE (p=0.006). However, other active intestinal lesions were not related to postoperative recurrence. EN reduced the cumulative rate of postoperative recurrence (p=0.017), especially in patients with penetrating type (p=0.005), in patients who did not have colitis (p=0.051) and in patients who did not have active intestinal lesions confirmed by IOE (p=0.02). CONCLUSIONS: EN is a prophylactic that prevents the postoperative recurrence of small intestinal CD. Patients with the penetrating type of CD, and those who do not have active lesions in the small intestine according to IOE, are candidates for EN after surgery.},

   abstract = {PURPOSE: This retrospective study was designed to determine risk factors for recurrence of Crohn's disease under enteral nutrition. METHODS: The clinical course of 145 patients with Crohn's disease, who were primarily induced into remission by total parenteral nutrition, was reviewed. The patients were classified into two groups: enteral nutrition group (n = 98; >/=1,200 kcal/day of enteral nutrition), or nonenteral nutrition group (n = 47;<1,200 kcal/day of enteral nutrition) according to the amount of their daily elemental or polymeric diet. Contributions of enteral nutrition and other clinical variables to the recurrence were analyzed retrospectively. A Crohn's disease activity index of >150 plus an increase in Crohn's disease activity index of >70 from the baseline value was defined as recurrence. RESULTS: Forty-two patients in the enteral nutrition group and 29 patients in the nonenteral nutrition group recurred during periods ranging from 3 to 159 months. The cumulative rate of recurrence was significantly higher in the nonenteral nutrition group than in the enteral nutrition group (P = 0.047). Among the Crohn's disease patients in the enteral nutrition group, penetrating type (relative risk, 3.89; 95 percent confidence interval, 1.58-9.62), colonic involvement (relative risk, 3.10; 95 percent confidence interval, 1.39-6.9), and previous history of surgery (relative risk, 2.48; 95 percent confidence interval, 1.16-5.33) were factors that significantly affected recurrence. In contrast, penetrating type was the only possible factor associated with recurrence in the nonenteral nutrition group (relative risk, 2.75; 95 percent confidence interval, 0.96-7.81). CONCLUSIONS: Among patients with Crohn's disease under maintenance enteral nutrition, the risk of recurrence differs according to the disease type and the site of involvement. The maintenance treatment by enteral nutrition alone seems insufficient for patients with penetrating type or with colonic involvement.},

   abstract = {BACKGROUND: Strictureplasty is an effective means of alleviating obstructive Crohn's disease while conserving bowel length. The aim of this study was to establish long-term outcomes of strictureplasty. METHODS: Between 1978 and 2003, 479 strictureplasties were performed in 100 patients during 159 operations. Information on Crohn's disease, medical therapy, laboratory indices, surgical details, complication rates and outcomes was recorded. The primary endpoint was abdominal reoperation. RESULTS: Mean follow-up was 85.1 (range 0.2-240.9) months. The overall morbidity rate was 22.6 per cent, with septic complications in 11.3 per cent, obstruction in 4.4 per cent and gastrointestinal haemorrhage in 3.8 per cent. The 30-day mortality rate was 0.6 per cent and the procedure-related series mortality rate 3.0 per cent. Perioperative parenteral nutrition was the only marker for morbidity (P < 0.001). Reoperation rates were 52 per cent at a mean of 40.2 (range 0.2-205.8) months after a first, 56 per cent at 26.1 (range 3.5-63.5) months after a second, 86 per cent at 27.4 (range 1.4-74.5) months after a third, and 62.5 per cent at 25.9 (range 7.3-70.5) months following a fourth strictureplasty procedure. The major risk factor for reoperation was young age (P < 0.001). CONCLUSION: Long-term follow-up has confirmed the safety of strictureplasty in Crohn's disease. Morbidity is appreciable, although the surgical mortality rate is low. Reoperation rates are comparable following first and repeat strictureplasty procedures.},

The mechanism of action of this therapy, however, is still poorly understood. As part of our assessment of the action of 3 related polymeric enteral therapies, we have used a variety of techniques to document the histological and cytokine responses, in the mucosa and, systemically, to these treatments. The feeds studied (AL110, Modulen IBD and ACD004 [Nestle, Vevey, Switzerland]) all have casein as the protein source, are lactose free and are rich in transforming growth factor beta (TGF-beta). They have all been shown to induce clinical remission associated with mucosal healing. In the case of Modulen IBD, as well as mucosal macroscopic and histological healing there was a fall in mucosal proinflammatory cytokines: interleukin-1 mRNA in colonic and ileal, interleukin-8 mRNA in the colon and interferon gamma mRNA in the ileum, but a rise in the regulatory cytokine TGF-beta mRNA in the ileum. These results indicate that these formulas are influencing the disease process itself, and thus suggest that the clinical remission achieved is a result of a reduction in inflammation, rather than a consequence of some other nutrition effect.},

   abstract = {Protein-losing enteropathy (PLE) is a rare but severe complication of Crohn's disease (CD) and hypoalbuminemia can be one of the presenting symptoms of this illness. The diagnosis of PLE can only be made after exclusion of malnutrition and liver or kidney failure. Significant intestinal leakage can be caused by mucosal injury, increased lymphatic pressure or dilated lymphatics and has been reported in a large number of diseases. The protein-losing can be diagnosed by assessing the excretion of different radiolabeled macromolecules in the faeces or by the clearance of alpha-1-antitrypsine in stools. The primary approach should be the optimization of the nutritional status. Medical treatment of the underlying disease is primordial. In other cases surgical resection of the most affected areas is inevitable. We report a case of a 21-year-old male with a 4 year history of CD, who developed significant hypoproteinemia with pitting oedema, initially in the absence of any other sign of severe disease activity. A "Cr-chloride albumin excretion confirmed our hypothesis of protein-losing enteropathy. Because of sub-obstruction signs some months later, a laparotomy was performed which revealed a severely affected loop with dilatation of the proximal jejunum. Interestingly, multiple large lymph nodes and dilated lymphatics were seen. A partial jejunal resection was performed for stricturing Crohn's disease. Histology showed severe mesenteric granulomatosis, dilated lymph vessels and granulomatous vasculitis. After the resection our patient improved without further albumin infusions and the oedema resolved.},

The consequences are also related to the site of the resection itself, to the causative disease and thus to the patient's morphological and functional adaptation capacity. Over the past 20 years we have operated on 32 patients for vascular disorders, Crohn's disease, intestinal volvulus, actinic enteritis, and ileo-caecal carcinoma. In all patients total parenteral nutrition was started and followed by enteral nutrition and oral feeding after variable periods of time. The postoperative course, in terms of adaptation and stabilisation, was regular on most cases: only in the patients operated on for Crohn's disease was symptom and nutritional remission belated or incomplete. The perioperative mortality was 34% (11 patients). The extent of the resection was often conditioned by the topography of irreversible anatomico-pathological lesions and only in one case did a colic resection prove necessary. In more extensive resections, involving a longer adaptation time, enteral nutrition was supplemented with total parenteral nutrition for lengthier periods.},

The aim of our study was to assess food intake and the status for vitamins and trace elements in nonselected CD patients in clinical remission. METHODS: A total of 54 consecutive CD patients (28 females, 26 males, 39 +/- 2 years of age [mean +/- SD]) in clinical remission for >3 months underwent body composition, resting energy expenditure, nutrient intake, and plasma concentration assessment, and were compared with 25 healthy controls (16 females, 9 males, 38 +/- 3 years old). RESULTS: According to the nutritional risk index, 37 patients (70%) were not malnourished, 12 were at moderate risk, and 4 were at severe risk for malnutrition. Fat mass was lower in patients in remission compared with controls (P = 0.04). The mean daily energy intake was comparable between patients (2218 +/- 92 kcal/day) and controls (2066 +/- 101 kcal/day), covering their needs. No significant difference was observed for macronutrient intake in comparison with controls; compared to controls, female CD patients had lower intakes of beta-carotene (P < 0.005), vitamins B1 (P < 0.05), B6 (P < 0.01), and C (P < 0.005), and magnesium (P < 0.01). They had significantly higher intakes of zinc (P < 0.01). Male CD patients had lower intakes of beta-carotene and vitamin C (P < 0.05). More than 50% of patients had low plasma concentrations of vitamin C (84%), copper (84%), niacin (77%), and zinc (65%). CONCLUSIONS: In CD patients in remission, macronutrient needs are usually covered by food intake. However, micronutrient deficiencies are frequent and call for specific screening and treatment.},

   abstract = {The newborn infant leaves a germ-free intrauterine environment to enter a contaminated extrauterine world and must have adequate intestinal defences to prevent the expression of clinical gastrointestinal disease states. Although the intestinal mucosal immune system is fully developed after a full-term birth, the actual protective function of the gut requires the microbial stimulation of initial bacterial colonization. Breast milk contains prebiotic oligosaccharides, like inulin-type fructans, which are not digested in the small intestine but enter the colon as intact large carbohydrates that are then fermented by the resident bacteria to produce SCFA. The nature of this fermentation and the consequent pH of the intestinal contents dictate proliferation of specific resident bacteria. For example, breast milk-fed infants with prebiotics present in breast milk produce an increased proliferation of bifidobacteria and lactobacilli (probiotics), whereas formula-fed infants produce more enterococci and enterobacteria. Probiotics, stimulated by prebiotic fermentation, are important to the development and sustainment of intestinal defences. For example, probiotics can stimulate the synthesis and secretion of polymeric IgA, the antibody that coats and protects mucosal surfaces against harmful bacterial invasion. In addition, appropriate colonization with probiotics helps to produce a balanced T helper cell response (Th1=Th2=Th3/Tr1) and prevent an imbalance (Th1>Th2 or Th2>Th1) contributing in part to clinical disease (Th2 imbalance contributes to atopic disease and Th1 imbalance contributes to Crohn's disease and Helicobacter pylori-induced gastritis). Furthermore, a series of pattern recognition receptors, toll-like receptors on gut lymphoid and epithelial cells that interact with bacterial molecular patterns (e.g. endotoxin (lipopolysaccharide), flagellin, etc.), help modulate intestinal innate immunity and an appropriate adaptive immune response. Animal and clinical studies have shown that inulin-type fructans will stimulate an increase in probiotics (commensal bacteria) and these bacteria have been shown to modulate the development and persistence of appropriate mucosal immune responses. However, additional studies are needed to show that prebiotics can directly or indirectly stimulate intestinal host defences. If this can be demonstrated, then prebiotics can be used as a dietary supplement to stimulate a balanced and an appropriately effective mucosal immune system in newborns and infants.},

In 39 patients, including 21 males and 18 females, followed for a mean duration of over 16 years between 1979 and 2004, the extent of disease was defined and disease behaviour characterized. Over 80% of patients had concomitant colonic and/or gastroduodenal involvement with Crohn's disease, suggesting that this entity may represent a specific clinical phenotype of extensive disease localization. Classification of Crohn's disease behaviour using the Vienna classification schema revealed that virtually all patients in this study suffered from intestinal stricture formation or penetrating disease complications. Moreover, pharmacological therapies with corticosteroids and immunosuppressant drugs were rarely successful, with virtually all patients requiring at least one, and usually multiple, intestinal resections. Finally, most patients required long-term nutritional support, often with home parenteral nutrition. New treatments are required, possibly defined on the basis of their effectiveness in reducing the severity and extent of intestinal disease, rather than more conventional statistically driven reductions in disease activity indexes.},

   abstract = {The chronic idiopathic inflammatory bowel diseases (IBDs), namely Crohn's disease and ulcerative colitis, appear to be derived from an inappropriate reaction towards a luminal agent, most probably driven by the intestinal microflora, which upregulates the synthesis and release of different pro-inflammatory mediators, thus contributing to tissue damage that characterizes these intestinal conditions. Several studies have reported that IBD is associated with impairment in short-chain fatty acid (SCFA) production, mainly acetate, propionate, and butyrate. They are produced in the large bowel by anaerobic bacterial fermentation of undigested dietary carbohydrates and fiber polysaccharides, with butyrate being considered as the major fuel source for colonocytes. These SCFAs have been proposed to play a key role in the maintenance of colonic homeostasis. Therefore, it is reasonable to consider therapeutic approaches that increase colonic SCFA production, as it can be achieved by administration of dietary fiber to IBD patients. Unfortunately, there is quite limited documentation of efficacy of dietary fiber in properly designed trials. This review discusses the rationale, available evidence for the use of dietary fiber and its mechanisms of action in the treatment and prevention of IBDs.},

   abstract = {Undigested carbohydrates reaching the colon can act as competitors for epithelial bacterial receptors, making it difficult for noncommensal bacteria to adhere to them. On the contrary, fermentation of these carbohydrates by anaerobic flora produces - among other substrates - butyrate that is involved in numerous important metabolic processes. These include the provision of energy to the colonocytes, the enhancement of sodium and water absorption and the synthesis of mucus and cell membranes. In addition, butyrate inhibits the nuclear translocation of the transcription factor NFkappaB, which exerts a potent anti-inflammatory activity. Clinical experience with probiotics in inflammatory bowel disease (IBD) is controversial. Whereas some probiotic preparations appear to be useful in ulcerative colitis (UC) and pouchitis, most attempts to use probiotics for treating or preventing recurrence in Crohn's disease have failed. It should be pointed out that - unlike in the small bowel - the colon and ileal pouches are well-established microbiological ecosystems with increasing amounts of a wide variety of bacterial strains. These bacterial strains have a high degree of metabolic interaction with luminal nutrients and a greater probability of developing dysbiosis. With this in mind, the rationale for using pre- and probiotics appears to be stronger for colonic IBD (UC or Crohn's colitis) and pouchitis than for IBD mostly involving the small bowel.},

   abstract = {BACKGROUND: Enteral nutrition (EN) is widely used and is effective in the treatment of children with Crohn's disease given as an exclusive feed for 6-8 weeks. Current dietetic practice during EN is to recommend an energy intake based on estimated average requirement (EAR) for energy for age. AIMS: To examine factors affecting energy intake and weight gain during EN in relation to disease site and nutritional status. METHODS: A retrospective cohort study examining energy intake and weight gain during the exclusive EN feeding period in 40 patients newly diagnosed with Crohn's in relation to EAR, nutritional status, disease site. RESULTS: All patients improved clinically and gained weight during EN with improvement in the CRP as a marker of the systemic inflammatory response. Energy intake was higher than EAR in 82% (33/40 patients), with the median 117.5% of EAR. Weight gain correlated with body mass index standard deviation score (P = 0.001) at start of treatment, but not energy intake or CRP. CONCLUSION: Estimated average requirement underestimates energy intakes in most children with newly diagnosed Crohn's disease. During EN, an energy intake in the range of 100-149% (median 117.5%) EAR for energy for age may be required. Energy balance studies in children with active disease are required.},

   abstract = {BACKGROUND: Inflammatory bowel disease (IBD) is increasing in frequency in Australia. General practitioners play an important role in early diagnosis and in a multidisciplinary approach to managing such patients. Keeping abreast of evolving concepts, particularly in treatment, is challenging. OBJECTIVE: This article aims to address key issues in diagnosis and management to better equip general practitioners for their role in multidisciplinary management of patients with IBD. DISCUSSION: Making the diagnosis can be difficult, but is facilitated by appropriate clinical suspicion and sensible judgment as to who undergoes diagnostic tests such as colonoscopy. Treatment of ulcerative colitis has changed little in recent years, except for our improved ability to deliver mesalazine to the large bowel via the recent availability of several oral and rectal preparations. Prevention of relapse using these is an important strategy in the majority of patients. Treatment of Crohn disease is changing due to more realistic concepts of the natural history of the disease and the development of new, powerful anti-inflammatory therapies. Attention to issues other than intestinal inflammation such as nutrition, education and counselling, remain important in achieving optimal management.},

AIM: To compare bone biomarkers in inflammatory bowel disease patients (Crohn's disease: n = 68, and ulcerative colitis: n = 32, separately) with age- and sex-matched healthy controls. SUBJECTS: Patients and controls were recruited from Cork University Hospital and Cork City area, respectively. RESULTS: Relative to that in their respective controls, Crohn's disease (n = 47) and ulcerative colitis (n = 26) patients (i.e. excluding supplement users) had significantly (P < 0.05-0.001) higher serum undercarboxylated osteocalcin (by 27% and 63%, respectively) and bone-specific alkaline phosphatase (by 15% and 21%, respectively) and urinary Type I collagen cross-linked N-telopeptides concentrations (by 87% and 112%, respectively). Relative to that in their respective controls, Crohn's disease and ulcerative colitis patients had significantly (P < 0.01) lower serum total osteocalcin (by 20% and 42%, respectively) and 25-hydroxyvitamin D (by 37% and 42%, respectively), while serum parathyroid hormone levels were similar. In the combined patient group (n = 100), undercarboxylated osteocalcin was positively associated with bone markers. CONCLUSIONS: Both Crohn's disease and ulcerative colitis patients have altered bone turnover relative to that in healthy controls.},

   abstract = {OBJECTIVE: To investigate determinants (pathophysiologic and physiologic, behavioural and lifestyle) of vitamin D status in Irish Crohn's disease (CD) patients. DESIGN: A cross-sectional observational study. SETTING: Cork City, Ireland (52 degrees N). SUBJECTS: Crohn's Disease patients (n=58; mean age 38.1 years) were recruited from Cork University Hospital. RESULTS: Fifty and nineteen percent of Irish CD patients were vitamin D deficient (defined by serum 25 hydroxyvitamin (OH) D levels <50 nmol/l) during winter and summer, respectively. Multiple regression analysis showed that summer-time serum 25 (OH) D levels were positively associated with use of vitamin D supplements (P=0.033) and negatively associated with smoking (P=0.006) and being male (P=0.063). During winter-time, use of vitamin D supplements (P=0.041) and sun habits (P=0.066) were positively associated, whereas small intestinal involvement (P=0.005) and body mass index (BMI) (P=0.083) were negatively associated with serum 25 (OH) D levels. There was no significant association between other non-pathophysiologic (age, dietary calcium or vitamin D) or pathophysiologic factors (steroid use, resection), and serum 25 (OH) D levels, at either season. Approximately 41 and 60% of the total variation in summer- and winter-time serum 25 (OH) D, respectively, was explained by this model. CONCLUSION: A high proportion of Irish CD patents had some level of vitamin D deficiency (<50 nmol/l) during late-wintertime. Use of regular low-dose supplemental vitamin D, particularly by patients with small intestinal involvement, cessation of smoking and adequate, but responsible, exposure to summer sunlight as well as maintaining BMI in the normal range could help maintain adequate vitamin D levels during wintertime.},

   abstract = {PURPOSE OF REVIEW: Treatment algorithms for inflammatory bowel disease are changing rapidly. Increased and earlier use of immunomodulatory drugs and availability of biologic agents have reduced dependence on corticosteroids and made mucosal healing a realistic goal. It is timely to debate the role of enteral nutrition in this evolving therapeutic armamentarium for Crohn's disease, and to examine the mechanisms of its anti-inflammatory effects in light of current understanding of disease pathogenesis. RECENT FINDINGS: Clinical studies have suggested that response to enteral nutrition is associated with decreased mucosal inflammation in Crohn's disease, that isolated Crohn's colitis is less responsive and that exclusive enteral nutrition is required. Basic research has demonstrated that lipids in the intestinal lumen can alter signalling of the mucosal immune system by intestinal epithelial cells. Exclusive enteral nutrition is associated with alteration of enteric microflora. SUMMARY: Enteral nutrition is an efficacious treatment of active inflammation involving the ileum; recent-onset disease may be particularly responsive. The significance of effects on enteric flora deserves further exploration in view of the importance of microbes to disease pathogenesis.},

   abstract = {PURPOSE OF REVIEW: To outline recent findings on the efficacy of immunonutrients in patients undergoing inflammatory stress due to surgery, infection and cancer. RECENT FINDINGS: Enteral nutrition is more efficacious and poses lower risks than parenteral nutrition. It reduces infection rates and shortens ICU and hospital length of stay of critically ill patients. Beneficial effects of immunonutrition are most apparent in malnourished patients. Perioperative enteral nutrition is more effective than postoperative nutrition. In Crohn disease similar remission rates are achieved with enteral nutrition as with steroids. Glutamine, omega-3 fatty acids and antioxidants exert beneficial influences in diverse patient populations. L-arginine is an important immunonutrient having both beneficial and adverse effects. The former effect occurs in necrotizing enterocolitis; the latter influence is seen in septic patients. The gut plays a major role in whole body amino acid metabolism, particularly arginine homeostasis. Arginase and nitric oxide synthetase compete for arginine within immune cells and play a pivotal role in clinical outcome during infection. In cancer a range of antioxidants are able to ameliorate immunosuppression. Intravenous lipids may be deleterious due to the pro-inflammatory effects of omega-6 fatty acids. Omega-3 fatty acids are anti-inflammatory and combined with medium chain triglyceride (MCT) and olive oil may provide a more efficacious form of intravenous lipid. SUMMARY: Immunonutrition is effective in improving outcome in a wide range of patients when applied enterally, particularly in malnourished individuals. Parenteral immunonutrition carries a higher risk but can be efficacious in selected patient groups for whom enteral nutrition is problematic.},

Probiotics, mostly lactic acid bacteria such as Lactobacilli and Bifidobacteria, but also the yeast Saccharomyces boulardii, have been tried in many double-blinded, randomized, placebo-controlled studies, and several well-conducted meta-analyses are now available. There is some evidence of efficacy in the prevention of community-acquired and nosocomial diarrhea. More solid evidence of efficacy is found in the treatment of sporadic, infectious diarrhea, where several probiotics, and especially Lactobacillus GG, have been found capable of reducing by approximately 1 day the duration of diarrhea, shorten the initial phase of watery stools, and reducing hospital stay in developed countries. The effect is best documented in viral diarrheas. Although there are valid conceptual premises for probiotics to be helpful in inflammatory bowel diseases, only 1 trial has been published in children, showing Lactobacillus GG not to be superior to placebo in maintaining remission of Crohn disease. All considered, more research is needed for a better understanding of the role of probiotics in gastrointestinal diseases of children, addressing issues such as pharmacokinetics, mechanism of action, and role of specific probiotics, alone or in combination, in different disorders.},

   abstract = {A large and diverse variety of bacteria have evolved and adapted to live in the human intestinal habitat in a symbiotic arrangement that influences both physiology and pathology in the host. Symbiosis between host and flora can be optimised by prebiotics. Inulin-type fructans have been shown to improve the metabolic functions of the commensal flora. Clinical and experimental data suggest that they also improve the gut mucosal barrier. Furthermore, modulation of the trophic functions of the flora by these prebiotics could help in the prevention of inflammatory bowel diseases. The anti-inflammatory effects of inulin or oligofructose have been assessed in the rat model of distal colitis induced by dextran sodium sulphate, which histologically resembles human ulcerative colitis, and in the trinitrobenzene sulphonic acid model that resembles human Crohn's disease. Both inulin and oligofructose stimulate colonic production of SCFA and favour the growth of indigenous lactobacilli and/or bifidobacteria. These effects are associated with reduced mucosal inflammation and decreased mucosal lesion scores. Inulin has also been tested in a placebo-controlled clinical trial in patients with relapsing pouchitis. Treatment reduced endoscopic and histological parameters of inflammation of the pouch mucosa. Inulin and oligofructose may offer an opportunity to prevent chronic inflammatory intestinal disorders, and this potential should be tested in further clinical studies.},

We evaluated the diagnostic usefulness and safety of capsule endoscopy for obscure small-bowel disorders in children and adolescents. METHODS: Comparative, prospective, self-controlled trials in patients (age, 10-18 y) suspected to have either small-bowel Crohn's disease, polyps, or obscure gastrointestinal (GI) bleeding. Capsule results were compared with the diagnostic imaging studies normally used in this age group. RESULTS: Among 20 patients suspected of Crohn's disease, multiple lesions consistent with this diagnosis were observed by capsule endoscopy in 50%. Small-bowel Crohn's disease was ruled out in 8 patients. Eosinophilic enteropathy was found in 2 others. For polyp detection (n = 6), capsule endoscopy yielded 100% concordance with the control studies when analyzed per patient. However, capsule endoscopy revealed a greater number (50%) of polyps. Among patients with obscure bleeding (n = 4), the capsule examination confirmed a diagnosis of vascular malformations in 3. Capsule endoscopy more accurately identified the precise source of bleeding compared with angiography. All 30 capsule studies were well tolerated, although 1 capsule was retained owing to an inflammatory stenosis. The capsule eventually was expelled after corticosteroid therapy. CONCLUSIONS: Capsule endoscopy correctly diagnosed or excluded a bleeding source, small-bowel polyps, or Crohn's disease of the small bowel in 29 of 30 patients. Capsule endoscopy permits an accurate, noninvasive approach for diagnosing obscure small bowel lesions in children over the age of 10.},

It is often considered to be the major component of unhealthy lifestyle that contributes significantly to the pathogenesis of not only psychiatric but also many other systemic disorders. Among the approaches to reduce the level of anxiety has been the search for healthy lifestyles. The aim of the study was to study the short-term impact of a comprehensive but brief lifestyle intervention, based on yoga, on anxiety levels in normal and diseased subjects. The study was the result of operational research carried out in the Integral Health Clinic (IHC) at the Department of Physiology of All India Institute of Medical Sciences. The subjects had history of hypertension, coronary artery disease, diabetes mellitus, obesity, psychiatric disorders (depression, anxiety, 'stress'), gastrointestinal problems (non ulcer dyspepsia, duodenal ulcers, irritable bowel disease, Crohn's disease, chronic constipation) and thyroid disorders (hyperthyroidism and hypothyroidism). The intervention consisted of asanas, pranayama, relaxation techniques, group support, individualized advice, and lectures and films on philosophy of yoga, the place of yoga in daily life, meditation, stress management, nutrition, and knowledge about the illness. The outcome measures were anxiety scores, taken on the first and last day of the course. Anxiety scores, both state and trait anxiety were significantly reduced. Among the diseased subjects significant improvement was seen in the anxiety levels of patients of hypertension, coronary artery disease, obesity, cervical spondylitis and those with psychiatric disorders. The observations suggest that a short educational programme for lifestyle modification and stress management leads to remarkable reduction in the anxiety scores within a period of 10 days.},

   abstract = {OBJECTIVES: Recent studies have indicated that bone mineral density is reduced in children with inflammatory bowel disease. The exact cause of this reduction is unclear, but it is often attributed to corticosteroid use. This study examined the prevalence of reduced bone mass in otherwise healthy children newly diagnosed with Crohn disease without previous corticosteroid exposure. METHODS: Eighteen steroid-naive children newly diagnosed with Crohn disease underwent dual energy x-ray absorptiometry. Disease activity, growth and pubertal development, nutritional assessment and bone mass measurements were recorded. z scores were adjusted for bone age. RESULTS: Five of the 18 patients (28%) had a total bone mineral density z score less than -1 (one had a z score less than -2). Ten (56%) subjects had lumbar spine bone mineral density z scores less than -1 (two had z score less than -2). The subjects had significantly reduced mean lumbar spine bone mineral density z scores (P = 0.002). Delayed pubertal development correlated with whole body bone mineral density z scores (r = 0.64; P = 0.004). Most subjects were not meeting United States recommended dietary allowances for daily intake of calcium, vitamin D and total calories. The majority of subjects were not participating in weight-bearing physical activity. CONCLUSION: Decreased bone mass is common in steroid naive children newly diagnosed with Crohn disease. Crohn disease appears to contribute to impaired bone mass independent of corticosteroid therapy.},

   abstract = {BACKGROUND: Recurrence of Crohn's disease in small intestinal allografts, although rarely described, can cause serious morbidity and jeopardize graft survival among transplant recipients with Crohn's disease. However, systematic studies to determine the frequency, predictors, and clinical implications of recurrent Crohn's disease have not been reported METHODS: We analyzed our transplant program's experience with small intestinal allografts in patients with Crohn's disease based on retrospective review of clinical and pathological records and corresponding pathology slides. RESULTS: Of 67 patients undergoing 70 transplantations between 1998 and 2004, six adults (three males, three females; mean age 48.1 years) had Crohn's disease complicated by short gut syndrome and total parenteral nutrition failure. Four survivors surveyed endoscopically for a mean 29 (range, 20-40) months and underwent a mean 37 endoscopic examinations with biopsies (range, 31-44) while on maintenance immunosuppression. Despite absence of any endoscopic or clinical manifestations of Crohn's disease throughout this period, two patients had granulomatous enteritis characteristic of Crohn's disease in multiple biopsies, one patient in 8/44 examinations (18%) ranging from 34 days to 20 months postoperatively and the other in 6/32 examinations (19%) ranging from 20 days to 22 months postoperatively. No comparable changes occurred in 57 other patients without Crohn's disease followed endoscopically under the same protocol CONCLUSIONS: Histological recurrence of Crohn's disease may occur in small intestinal allografts despite the absence of endoscopic and clinical disease manifestations. Such recurrences are probably not rare, may occur as early as 3 weeks after transplantation, and do not necessarily portend early clinical recurrence or mandate aggressive therapy to prevent allograft loss.},

   abstract = {OBJECTIVE: Gastrointestinal (GI) damage caused by methotrexate (MTX) results in mucosal injury, bacterial invasion, and activation of an immune system that is reduced in function. Diets enriched with glutamine, short chain fatty acids (SCFAs), and transforming growth factor (TGF)-beta have demonstrated decreased infection, weight loss, and GI damage in Crohn disease. We, therefore, sought to study the cytoprotective effects of a diet enriched in glutamine, TGF-beta, and SFCAs (Modulen) in Fischer 344 rats exposed to MTX. METHODS: Rats were divided into five groups: two receiving normal saline and three receiving MTX and fed either normal chow, Modulen supplemented chow starting with the first MTX dose, or Modulen supplemented chow beginning 3 days before MTX injection. Rats were weighed daily. On day 5, albumin and bicarbonate levels were drawn, and rats were killed for examination of their intestinal mucosa by a pathologist unaware of groupings. RESULTS: Rats pretreated with Modulen supplemented chow maintained weight (2.6 vs, 12.3 g weight loss), albumin levels (3.13 vs, 2.43 mg/dL), and bicarbonate levels (23.8 vs. 18.1 mg/dL) as compared with rats fed normal chow throughout MTX treatment (P < 0.05). Pretreatment with Modulen also protected against crypt cell loss, villus atrophy, crypt abscesses, crypt/villus ratio, and overall histologic damage (P < 0.05). CONCLUSION: When administered before and during MTX treatment, Modulen supplementation provided statistically significant protection against weight loss, hypoalbuminemia, acidosis, and GI damage in a rat model. Future animal research of Modulen's protective effects with other chemotherapeutic agents is needed before human trials.},

   abstract = {INTRODUCTION: The aim of the study was to assess if the estimated average requirements for energy for normal children (EAR) and the Schofield equation could reliably predict energy requirements in children with inactive Crohn's disease (CD). METHODS: Twenty-three children with inactive CD were studied, median age 14.3 years (range 7.8-16.9). Resting energy expenditure (REE) was measured by indirect calorimetry and compared with that predicted using the Schofield equation (BMR). Total energy expenditure (TEE) was measured using REE and a 3-day activity diary and compared with EAR. RESULTS: REE ranged from 79% to 136% of BMR. Mean REE was not significantly greater than mean BMR (P=0.25 2-tailed t-test). TEE ranged from 72% to 163% of estimated average requirements for energy for children of that weight (EARw). EARw tended to underestimate TEE in large children and overestimate TEE in small children (Bland-Altman plot R=0.5, P=0.002). EARw was a poor predictor of TEE (R=0.35, P=0.1). EAR underestimated energy requirements by >500 kcal/day in 40% of the children. CONCLUSIONS: The Schofield equation and EAR are unreliable methods of predicting total energy requirements in children with inactive CD with a significant potential to underestimate energy needs. When energy requirements were greater than EAR it was due to physical activity and body habitus rather than raised REE.},

Achieving a clinical remission is possible in >70% of children with Crohn's disease at diagnosis, while a mucosal or even immunological remission may occur in <50%. The importance of what ;degree of remission' should be achieved during maintenance therapy is discussed. Does early aggressive management with immunomodulators or biological agents indeed alter the natural history of the disease, and is it possible to give a prognosis based on either a snap-shot of endoscopic appearance, or a mucosal cytokine profile? The potential benefits of using a 6-8 week course of exclusive enteral nutrition as an induction therapy in combination with azathioprine/6-mercaptopurine are discussed. Whole protein formulae are safe and effective at achieving a clinical remission, however they are not a long-term maintenance strategy. Given the relative safety of these immunosuppressants and their efficacy in children treated at diagnosis, it is now more important than ever to predict which individuals will benefit from use of immunomodulators very early in the disease process. There is brief mention of enteral nutrition as maintenance therapy. Given the very limited data available, it is still not possible to recommend long-term nutrition supplementation as a maintenance therapy in all children. However, some children may respond to repeated shorter cycles of exclusive enteral nutrition in the absence of other therapeutic options.},

   abstract = {The natural history of Crohn's disease is characterized by recurrent exacerbations. A small, but significant, number of pediatric patients with Crohn's disease are resistant to standard medical therapies. The goal of therapy in pediatric patients is not only to achieve and maintain clinical remission, but also to promote growth, development and improve quality of life. All of this needs to be achieved within a relatively short window of opportunity, before growth and development deficiencies become permanent. The standard therapy for pediatric patients with Crohn's disease consists of 5-aminosalicylic-acid compounds, antibiotics and enteral nutrition. Enteral nutrition has an excellent adverse-effect profile and, in addition to its therapeutic effect, positively impacts growth and nutritional status. Immunomodulating medications, such as azathioprine, 6-mercaptopurine and methotrexate, are frequently used to maintain remission, and to treat corticosteroid-dependent and perianal disease. Recently, biologic treatment with the anti-tumor-necrosis-factor-alpha antibody infliximab has dramatically changed the therapeutic approach. The long-term safety of this therapy still needs to be established. Limited data are available on other biologic therapies, which, at this point in time, are considered experimental and are only available through clinical trials.},

   abstract = {BACKGROUND AND OBJECTIVES: Longitudinal assessment of disease activity is necessary for studies of therapeutic intervention in children with Crohn disease. The Pediatric Crohn Disease Activity Index (PCDAI) was developed a decade ago for such a purpose, but it function has only been examined in a small number of studies with a limited number of patients. The primary objectives of the present study were to develop cut scores reflecting disease activity as determined by physician global assessment (PGA) and to evaluate the responsiveness of the PCDAI to changes in patient condition after therapeutic interventions. METHODS: Data were derived from a prospective database of newly diagnosed children with inflammatory bowel disease established in 2002 at 18 pediatric gastroenterology centers in the United States and Canada. At diagnosis, at 30 days and 3 months after diagnosis, and quarterly thereafter, children (<16 years of age) with Crohn disease had disease assessment performed by PGA and PCDAI. Disease management was provided according to the dictates of the attending gastroenterologist and not by predetermined protocol. RESULTS: 181 patients had concomitant PGA and PCDAI performed at diagnosis, and 95 of these had similar assessment at short-term follow up. Mean +/- SD PCDAI scores for mild, moderate, and severe disease by PGA at diagnosis were 19.5 +/- 10.4, 32.2 +/- 12.7, and 47.8 +/- 14.9, respectively (P < 0.001 for all comparisons). Mean +/- SD PCDAI for inactive disease after treatment was 5.2 +/- 5.4. Receiver operating characteristic (ROC) curve analysis suggested that: 1) activity of moderate/severe disease was best reflected by a PCDAI of > or = 30 points, 2) clinical response (moderate/severe disease improving to mild/inactive) was best reflected by a decrease in PCDAI of > or = 12.5 points, and 3) a PCDAI < 10 best reflected inactive disease. CONCLUSIONS: PCDAI scores accurately reflect disease activity as assessed by physician global assessment. A PCDAI score of > or = 30 has acceptable sensitivity and specificity to indicate disease of moderate/severe activity. A PCDAI decrease of 12.5 points or greater following therapeutic intervention accurately reflects a clinically significant response. The PCDAI is an appropriate tool for intervention trials in Crohn disease in children.},

   abstract = {The natural history of Crohn disease is characterized by recurrent bouts of active disease, the consequences of which can severely impair sufferers' physical and social functioning. Not only does the illness cause day-to-day morbidity for children but the consequence of the chronic inflammatory process also commonly results in the need for major intestinal surgery. The present challenge facing physicians treating children with Crohn disease is to alleviate symptoms and prolong periods of remission via the use of specifically targeted therapies while minimizing toxicity and promoting normal growth and development. Although systemic corticosteroids are effective in inducing clinical remission, they are of little or no benefit in maintaining remission and can contribute to linear growth retardation. Immunomodulating drugs such as azathioprine, 6-mercaptopurine and methotrexate have proved effective for inducing and maintaining remission of active Crohn disease. These agents are now commonly prescribed in children at diagnosis, after a severe attack or after surgery or in those who become corticosteroid-dependent or corticosteroid-resistant. Their use is not without potential adverse effects and not all patients respond well to these agents. With the introduction of biologic agents, notably the tumor necrosis factor-alpha monoclonal antibody infliximab, progress has been made in targeting specific pathogenetic mechanisms of Crohn disease and potentially altering the underlying disease process. Published experience in children is currently limited, but infliximab has been shown to improve symptoms and achieve corticosteroid independence in this age group. Unresolved issues with infliximab and other emerging biologic agents, including long-term safety, necessitate a degree of caution in selecting appropriate patients for treatment and with careful monitoring of their effects. The collection of contemporary natural history data is crucial to facilitate the better integration of current and emerging therapies in an attempt to alter the natural history of Crohn disease in children.},

   abstract = {PURPOSE: The purpose of this study was to assess the safety of subtotal colectomy and outcomes after this procedure in the modern era of immunosuppressive agents and primary pelvic pouch surgery. METHODS: All patients undergoing subtotal colectomy with ileostomy for ulcerative colitis or Crohn's colitis from July 1, 1990 to June 30, 2003 were identified from a prospective database. Only patients who were operated on while hospitalized for disease exacerbation were included in the analysis. Age at colectomy, preoperative days in the hospital, postoperative length of stay, and complications were recorded. The medical records were then reviewed for duration of disease, preoperative diagnosis, use of steroids and immunomodulators, parenteral nutrition, endoscopy findings, albumin level, postoperative diagnosis, and ultimate disposition. RESULTS: One hundred one patients underwent subtotal colectomy for inflammatory bowel disease during the study period. Seventy-four patients met all the inclusion criteria. The mean age was 35.9 (range, 18-86) years. Median duration of disease was 36 (0-240) months, but 28 patients had colitis for less than 1 year, whereas 10 patients had disease of greater than 10 years duration at the time of colectomy. Median preoperative hospital stay was 7 (range, 0-43) days and median postoperative length of stay was 6.5 (range, 4-37) days. Sixty-six patients underwent surgery for refractory exacerbation, 5 for free perforation, 2 for abscess, and 1 patient for hemorrhage. Twenty-seven patients (36.5 percent) had a change in diagnosis after surgery. Complications occurred in 17 patients (23 percent), including 8 cases of central venous catheter-associated thrombosis; 7 of these occurred in patients who had been hospitalized for more than a week before surgery. In the ulcerative colitis patients, 31 of 52 ultimately underwent ileal pouch-anal anastomosis, but 20 (39 percent) chose either completion proctectomy or no further surgery. CONCLUSIONS: Subtotal colectomy with ileostomy remains a safe and effective treatment for patients requiring urgent surgery for severe inflammatory bowel disease. Because of the substantial incidence of change in diagnosis and satisfaction in many patients with an ileostomy, subtotal colectomy with ileostomy may be preferable to primary ileal pouch-anal anastomosis, even when a pouch is considered safe.},

The aim of this study was to investigate the presence of CARD15 mutations in Swedish children with CD and analyze genotype-phenotype correlations. PATIENTS AND METHODS: Fifty-eight children (62% boys) with CD diagnosed between 2.8 and 16.9 years (median 10.9 years), were reviewed. Histopathology, retrospective data collection and mutational analyses for the three main mutations R702W, G908R and 1007fs were independently performed. First-degree relatives were also genotyped. RESULTS: A CARD15 mutation was found in 8.6% (95% confidence interval, 2.9% to 19.0%), all of whom were heterozygotes, giving an overall allele frequency of 4.3% (95% confidence interval, 1.4-9.8). In 12%, all patients without mutations, a first-degree relative had CD. In four of five children, mutations were transferred from their healthy mothers. Granulomas at onset were found in 80% of patients with mutations and in 43% of those without (P = 0.17). No statistical association was found between mutation and phenotype regarding age at onset, anatomic location at onset or follow-up, severity of inflammation at onset, development of stenosis, perianal disease or extra intestinal manifestations. CONCLUSIONS: The frequency of CARD15 mutation in this Swedish pediatric CD population is lower than reported in a mixed adult and pediatric population. The genotype-phenotype correlations were non-significant although a trend was found between the presence of mutations and granuloma formation. Healthy heterozygote mothers conveyed the mutation to their children with CD.},

   abstract = {GOALS: The goals of this study were to identify markers in a patient's presentation and disease progression that predict the need for the use of immunomodulators in a pediatric population. BACKGROUND: Although immunomodulator safety and efficacy have been documented in Crohn's disease, models for predicting outcome and the need for immunomodulators (azathioprine, 6-mercaptopurine, or methotrexate) early in the disease course have not been investigated in children or adults. METHODS: Data on newly diagnosed Crohn's disease patients were prospectively collected within 3 weeks of diagnosis, 6 months after diagnosis, and 1 year after diagnosis. Information collected at each visit included medication use and disease activity assessment. RESULTS: A total of 57 patients who were followed for > or = 6 months were evaluated. Overall, 34 of 57 (59.6%) were started on immunomodulators within 1 year of diagnosis. Mean serum albumin (3.35 g/dL vs. 3.7 g/dL, P = 0.013) and hematocrit (33.3% vs. 35.9%, P = 0.023) at diagnosis were lower, and erythrocyte sedimentation rate (32 vs. 12, P = 0.011) at diagnosis was higher in patients who required immunomodulators. The total Pediatric Crohn's Disease Activity Index score as well as the physical examination score and patient recall score within the PCDAI at diagnosis were not different among those who received immunomodulators and those that did not. CONCLUSIONS: Immunomodulators are frequently used within 1 year of diagnosis in pediatric Crohn's disease. Lower serum albumin levels and hematocrit, and elevated erythrocyte sedimentation rate at diagnosis may predict the need for immunomodulators earlier in the disease course.},

Two strongly associated cofactors have been identified: the presence of HLA-DQ2 or HLA-DQ8 in the host and specific antigenic peptides in the diet that are present in wheat, rye, and barley. Most patients have complete remission after dietary elimination of these foods. Crohn's disease is characterized by chronic, relapsing, recurrent, focal, transmural inflammation of the gastrointestinal tract that can lead to multiple serious problems requiring chronic medical and surgical therapy. Crohn's disease is associated with multiple genetic mutations, at least one of which has been clearly implicated in innate immunity. Multiple lines of evidence suggest that the disease involves abnormal immune responses to gut microbial flora.},

   abstract = {BACKGROUND AND AIMS: Total enteral nutrition (TEN) with a liquid formula can suppress gut inflammation and induce remission in active Crohn's disease. The mechanism is obscure. Studies have suggested that long term nutritional supplementation with a liquid formula (partial enteral nutrition (PEN)) may also suppress inflammation and prevent relapse. The aim of this study was to compare PEN with conventional TEN in active Crohn's disease. PATIENTS AND METHODS: Fifty children with a paediatric Crohn's disease activity index (PCDAI)>20 were randomly assigned to receive 50% (PEN) or 100% (TEN) of their energy requirement as elemental formula for six weeks. The PEN group was encouraged to eat an unrestricted diet while those receiving TEN were not allowed to eat. The primary outcome was achievement of remission (PCDAI<10). Secondary analyses of changes in erythrocyte sedimentation rate (ESR), C reactive protein, albumin, and platelets were performed to look for evidence of anti-inflammatory effects. RESULTS: Remission rate with PEN was lower than with TEN (15% v 42%; p=0.035). Although PCDAI fell in both groups (p=0.001 for both), the reduction was greater with TEN (p=0.005). Moreover, the fall in PCDAI with PEN was due to symptomatic and nutritional benefits. With both treatments there were significant improvements in relation to abdominal pain, "sense of wellbeing", and nutritional status. However, only TEN led to a reduction in diarrhoea (p=0.02), an increase in haemoglobin and albumin, and a fall in platelets and ESR. CONCLUSIONS: TEN suppresses inflammation in active Crohn's disease but PEN does not. This suggests that long term nutritional supplementation, although beneficial to some patients, is unlikely to suppress inflammation and so prevent disease relapse.},

   abstract = {BACKGROUND: There is an increased prevalence of gastrointestinal symptoms, peptic ulcer disease, and colon cancer in night-shiftworkers, whose sleep is commonly disrupted. Sleep complaints are an extrapyramidal symptom of irritable bowel syndrome (IBS). Sleep disruption may contribute to increased medical morbidity by weakening the ability of the immune system to protect against endotoxins-this pathway could be of potential importance to the pathogenesis and/or clinical course of inflammatory bowel disease (IBD), a chronic immunoinflammatory gastrointestinal disorder associated with marked reductions in quality of life. This is the first study to comprehensively examine sleep concerns in patients with IBD. METHODS: Sixteen patients with biopsy-proven inactive IBD (8 with Crohn disease and 8 with ulcerative colitis), 9 patients with IBS, and 7 healthy controls completed the Pittsburgh Sleep Quality Index, Epworth Sleepiness Scale, Inflammatory Bowel Disease Questionnaire, SF-12, and a single overnight polysomnogram. Polysomnography and arousals were scored according to standard criteria. Multivariate analyses were used to compare subjective and objective sleep parameters between groups and to identify associations between sleep complaints and quality of life. RESULTS: Patients with IBD did not seem to significantly differ from patients with IBS, who have established sleep complaints. On polysomnography, total sleep time differentiated the 3 groups well, with the IBS and IBD groups appearing numerically similar. Whereas IBS and IBD groups were similar with respect to observed sleep parameters, IBS patients did report the most concerns, consistent with earlier research suggesting that hyperarousal and perceptual differences may contribute to symptom reporting. CONCLUSION: Sleep parameters greatly influenced quality of life in both groups and highlight the need to address sleep concerns as part of IBD management.},

The aim of this study is to examine the short and long-term impact of enteral nutrition as primary therapy for children with newly diagnosed Crohn's disease. METHODS: Since 1994, a data base was set up in Bristol for all children with inflammatory bowel diseases. The data of newly diagnosed patients with Crohn's disease in whom enteral nutrition was used as the primary therapy (44 children) was analysed, with particular reference to time to remission, to first and subsequent relapse, and to first steroid usage. RESULTS: Forty out of 44 patients (90%) responded to enteral nutrition, with a median time to remission of 6 weeks. 25 of these 40 (62%) relapsed, with a median duration of remission of 54.5 weeks (range 4-312). 15 (38%) have not relapsed. 21 of the 44 (47%) have not received steroids. In those who eventually required steroids, their use was postponed for a median 68 weeks (range 6-190). Site of disease activity had no impact on response to enteral nutrition, but there was a trend towards earlier relapse in those with isolated colonic involvement. CONCLUSIONS: This data suggests that there are long-term benefits to the use of enteral nutrition to induce remission in children with Crohn's disease Steroids may be avoided in nearly half the cases and, in others, their use postponed by 68 weeks.},

The points in which these guidelines differ from those for adult patients are as follows. (i) Total enteral nutrition in the form of an elemental formula is indicated as primary therapy for children with Crohn's disease at onset as well as the active stage. Oral mesalazine is used together. (ii) Total parenteral nutrition (TPN) with oral mesalazine is required for children with serious illness. The use of a corticosteroid should be withheld for at least 1 week after TPN has been started. (iii) When TPN is not considered to be effective, additional corticosteroid is used. Full doses of corticosteroid should be used for at least 2 weeks after clinical improvement has been achieved, and then the dose of the corticosteroid should be tapered carefully. (iv) When surgery is indicated in pediatric patients with stricture or fistula formation and complicated by persistent growth failure despite medical therapy, the optimum time for surgery is thought to be before epiphyseal plates have been closed.},

   abstract = {Intestinal failure is a specific disease entity resulting from intestinal resection or disease-associated malabsorption and characterized by the inability to maintain protein-energy, fluid, electrolyte or micronutrient balance. We performed a MEDLINE search (1966-2006) to identify relevant articles, using keywords intestinal failure, parenteral or enteral nutrition, intestinal fistula and short bowel syndrome. Causes of intestinal failure are varied, with self-limiting or 'Type 1' intestinal failure occurring relatively commonly following abdominal surgery, necessitating short-term fluid or nutritional support. The rarer, 'Type 2' intestinal failure, is associated with septic, metabolic and complex nutritional complications, usually following surgical resection in patients with Crohn's or mesenteric vascular disease. A multidisciplinary approach to the management of patients with Type 2 intestinal failure is crucial: resolution of sepsis is required before adequate nutritional repletion can be achieved, and it is important to optimize nutritional status, not only through enteral or parenteral supplementation, but also by addressing complications of short bowel syndrome, before considering definitive surgical reconstruction. A structured approach to the management of Type 2 intestinal failure should reduce the likelihood of these complex patients developing 'Type 3' intestinal failure, which is characterized by the need for long-term parenteral nutrition.},

For ulcerative colitis (UC), oral or rectal aminosalycilates are widely used, and in more severe flares, corticoids and occasionally ciclosporine. In active Crohn's disease, corticosteroids represent the main treatment; budesonide must be preferred, as this steroid is better tolerated than prednisone. In patients refractory or intolerant to steroids, infliximab or artificial nutrition can be considered. Maintenance treatment is indicated in most of IBD patients. 5-ASA derivates are preferred in UC; in case of failure, azathioprine can be used. In Crohn's disease, azathioprine or methotrexate are more widely used; maintenance with infliximab is an option in case of failure.

   abstract = {OBJECTIVES: Delayed growth is common in pediatric Crohn's disease (CD). Multiple factors have been shown to affect growth in this situation, the most prominent being the presence and severity of inflammation and inadequate nutritional intake. Inflammation, anorexia, and weight loss are all manifestations of circulating TNF-alpha, which is elevated in CD. The ability to secrete TNF-alpha may be affected by polymorphisms in the TNF-alpha promoter. The aim of our study was to determine whether growth retardation and disease severity in pediatric onset CD are affected by TNF promoter genotype. METHODS: Genotyping for TNF-alpha and NOD2/CARD15 single nucleotide polymorphisms was performed in 87 patients with detailed growth records. Parameters including disease location and disease severity were recorded, and the effect of these polymorphisms on Z-scores for height and weight at disease onset and during follow-up were analyzed. RESULTS: Lower age of onset was linked to more height retardation, while the presence of colonic disease and the absence of ileal disease were more likely to predict the absence of growth retardation. The presence of two polymorphisms thought to decrease circulating TNF-alpha was associated with higher mean Z-scores for height and a trend toward less growth retardation. Two other polymorphisms were modestly associated with disease severity. CONCLUSION: Polymorphisms in the TNF-alpha promoter may independently modulate growth and disease severity in pediatric onset CD. The effect of these polymorphisms does not appear to be mediated via weight loss, and is relatively modest.},

   abstract = {BACKGROUND: Exclusive enteral nutrition (EN) is an established primary therapy for pediatric Crohn's disease (CD). The mechanism of action of such treatment is still conjectural. The aim of the present study was to investigate if EN-induced remission is associated with modification of the fecal microflora in CD. METHODS: Stool samples were collected from 5 healthy children and adolescents over a period of 3 months, and from 9 children and adolescents with active CD. To induce disease remission, children with CD received a course of exclusive EN for 8 weeks with a polymeric formula (Modulen IBD, Nestle). At the end of the course of exclusive EN, children returned to a free diet but continued to take 40% of the daily caloric intake as polymeric formula. Fecal microflora was analyzed by 16S ribosomal DNA polymerase chain reaction and temperature gradient gel electrophoresis (TGGE) with direct visual comparison of band profiles of PCR products. RESULTS: In 8 of 9 children, the exclusive EN alone induced disease remission. In 1 child, it was necessary to add steroids to the exclusive EN course to achieve remission. In all children with CD, analysis of gel band distribution revealed profound modification of the fecal microflora after exclusive EN. Variations of band distribution corresponding to different bacterial species were observed also in children on partial EN and required time to achieve stability of the band profile. In contrast, control healthy children showed a host-specific and stable TGGE profile over time. CONCLUSION: These data suggest that a possible mechanism of action of EN in inducing disease remission in CD is the capacity of modification of gut microflora. Possible explanations of such capacity are both low residue and prebiotic properties of the polymeric liquid formula.},

The present guideline gives evidence-based recommendations for the indication, application and type of formula of enteral nutrition (EN) (oral nutritional supplements (ONS) or tube feeding (TF)) in these patients. It was developed in an interdisciplinary consensus-based process in accordance with officially accepted standards and is based on all relevant publications since 1985. ONS and/or TF in addition to normal food is indicated in undernourished patients with CD or CU to improve nutritional status. In active CD EN is the first line therapy in children and should be used as sole therapy in adults mainly when treatment with corticosteroids is not feasible. No significant differences have been shown in the effects of free amino acid, peptide-based and whole protein formulae for TF. In remission ONS is recommended only in steroid dependent patients in CD. In patients with SBS TF should be introduced in the adaptation phase and should be changed with progressing adaptation to ONS in addition to normal food.},

   abstract = {Crohns disease is an inflammatory bowel disease that can have a significant impact on the health of those afflicted. The etiology of the disease is unknown, but genetic, environmental, dietary, and immunological factors are thought to be involved. Multiple nutrients can become depleted during active disease due to inadequate intake or malabsorption. Preventing these deficiencies is paramount in the care of those suffering from Crohns disease. Often the traditional treatments (medications) have limited effectiveness and negative side effects that inhibit their use. Enteral nutrition has promising therapeutic benefits, but its use is often limited to the pediatric population due to poor patient acceptability. Omega-3 fatty acids have been investigated for their anti-inflammatory properties as an alternative to traditional care. This article reviews the etiology of Crohns disease, nutritional deficiencies, traditional treatments, and the use of omega-3 fatty acids in the prevention of Crohns recurrence. The results from clinical trials have been conflicting, but a new fish oil preparation that limits the side effects of traditional fish oil therapy shows promise as an adjunctive treatment for Crohns disease. Continued research is needed to validate these findings.},

   abstract = {This review highlights the huge advances made in the understanding of Crohn's disease in the last 15 years. The pathogenic immune response in the gut wall is a highly polarised T helper cell type 1 response, probably directed against antigens of the commensal flora. There is marked over-expression of pro-inflammatory cytokines such as tumor necrosis factor (TNF)-alpha and increased production of matrix degrading enzymes by fibroblasts and macrophages, which are probably responsible for ulceration and fistula formation. Crohn's disease runs in families and the susceptibility genes identified so far are associated with innate recognition of microbial products (Nod2) or epithelial barrier function (OCTN cation transporter genes and DLG5). Endogenous healing pathways mediated by transforming growth factor (TGF)-beta1 are inhibited because mucosal inflammatory cells express Smad7, the endogenous intracellular inhibitor of TGF-beta signalling. This makes it unlikely that enteral feeds containing TFG-beta are therapeutic by means of direct anti-inflammatory effects, however TGF-beta may still be involved because it is a well known epithelial motogen and may promote mucosal healing, in synergy with changes in mucosal bacterial populations as a result of the change in the diet.},

OBJECTIVE: We aimed to synthesize published and unpublished evidence to determine estimates of the effect of n-3 fatty acids on clinical outcomes in IBD and whether n-3 fatty acids modify the effects of or need for treatment with other agents. DESIGN: Computerized databases were searched for studies of n-3 fatty acids in immune-mediated diseases from 1966 to 2003. We also contacted experts in the nutraceutical industry to identify unpublished studies; however, none were identified. RESULTS: Reviewers identified 13 controlled trials that assessed the effects of n-3 fatty acids on clinical, sigmoidoscopic, or histologic scores; rates of induced remission or relapse; or requirements for steroids and other immunosuppressive agents in Crohn disease or ulcerative colitis. Most clinical trials were of good quality. Fewer than 6 were identified that assessed the effects of n-3 fatty acids on any single outcome of clinical, endoscopic, or histologic scores or remission or relapse rates. Consistent across 3 studies was the finding that n-3 fatty acids reduce corticosteroid requirements, although statistical significance was shown in only 1 of these studies. CONCLUSION: The available data are insufficient to draw conclusions about the effects of n-3 fatty acids on clinical, endoscopic, or histologic scores or remission or relapse rates.},

The sensitivity of anti-Saccharomyces cerevisiae antibody (ASCA) IgG and ASCA IgA in CD is 60%-80%, whereas the specificity is almost 90%. There are no reports of study of ASCA in patients with IT, nor has it ever been used to differentiate CD from IT. Patients with ulcerative colitis (UC; n=25), CD (n=59), and IT (n=30) and 21 healthy controls were included in this study. The location and behavior of CD were classified according to the Modified Montreal classification. Five milliliters of blood was taken from them and serum was stored at -70 degrees C. ASCA antibodies (both IgG and IgA) were estimated using commercially available ELISA kits (AESKU Diagnostics, Germany). Anti-neutrophilic cytoplasmic antibody was measured by indirect immunofluorescence test. ASCA IgA was positive in 4.7%, 28%, 33.9%, and 43.3% and ASCA IgG was positive in 4.7%, 24%, 50.8%, and 46.6% of healthy controls and patients with UC, CD, and IT, respectively. Either ASCA IgG or ASCA IgA was positive in 9.5%, 40%, 61% and 66.6% of healthy controls, UC, CD, and IT, respectively. ANCA was positive in 0%, 32%, 10.1%, and 6.6% of healthy controls, UC, CD, and IT, respectively. ASCA IgG was positive in a significantly higher number of patients with CD (P<0.0001) and IT (P<0.0001) in comparison to healthy controls. ASCA IgA was positive in a significantly higher number of patients with UC (P<0.04), CD (P<0.013), and IT (P<0.006) in comparison to healthy controls. In comparisons between diseases, ASCA IgG was positive in significantly more patients with CD (P<0.001) and IT (P<0.001) in comparison to UC. There was no significant difference in ASCA IgA (33.9% vs. 43.3%), ASCA IgG (50.86% vs. 46.6%), or ANCA (10.7%, 7.4%) in patients with CD and IT, respectively. There was no correlation between ASCA and duration, location and behavior of CD, and IT. We conclude that ASCA IgG and ASCA IgA do not help to differentiate between IT and CD.},

   abstract = {BACKGROUND: The paediatric colonoscopy completion rates have rarely been reported. AIMS: We sought to evaluate colonoscopy completion rate and compare the rates using colonoscope versus enteroscope. METHODS: We prospectively investigated 60 patients who underwent colonoscopy between July 1999 and June 2001. The following data were collected: demographics, type of endoscope used, extent of colonoscopy, indication for procedure, histology, adverse events and time to reach the caecum and the terminal ileum. RESULTS: Sixty colonoscopies were performed during the study period, 30 with an enteroscope and 30 with a colonoscope. The caecum was reached in 56/60 (93%) and the terminal ileum in 50/60 (83%). An average time of 12.61 min (S.D. 7.3) was necessary to advance the instrument from the anus to the caecum, and additional 3.67 min (S.D. 3.62) to terminal ileum. There was no difference in the success rate between enteroscope and colonoscope. Six patients (10%) had definitive diagnosis established because a full colonoscopy was performed. No serious adverse events occurred. CONCLUSION: Paediatric colonoscopy to the caecum can be completed safely and expeditiously in more than 90% of procedures. Various types of instruments do not appear to influence completion rate. Full colonoscopy contributes to the establishment of a definitive diagnosis.},

The aim of this study was to assess the association between NOD2 polymorphisms and GDCD, and to assess the specific association between each of the 3 major allelic variants G908R, L1007P, and R702W and the clinical features of Crohn's disease. We retrospectively reviewed the records of 202 patients with confirmed Crohn's disease and complete data was performed. Seventy-one patients (35%) had at least 1 allelic variant: 55 had 1 variant, 4 were homozygous for L1007fs, 2 homozygous for R702W, and 10 were compound heterozygous. Eighteen patients with confirmed GDCD were identified; 10 (56%) had wild type, 4 (22%) had 1 variant, and 4 (22%) had 2 allelic variants (2 were L1007P homozygous and 2 compound heterozygous). Compared to patients without gastroduodenal involvement, those with GDCD were more likely to have 2 allelic variants (22% vs. 6%; odds ratio [OR] 2.7; 95% confidence interval [CI] 1.6-7.3) and to be homozygous for L1007P (11% vs. 1%; OR 5.2; 95% CI 2.5-9.4). G908R heterozygosity was associated with ileal involvement (OR 1.4; 95% CI 1.1-2.9) and smoking habits (OR 2.4; 95% CI 1.2-3.8), whereas L1007P homozygosity was associated with GDCD (OR 5.8; 95% CI 2.6-10.8). L1007P variation was associated with younger age at diagnosis as well. There was no specific association between R702W homo- or heterozygosity and any of the characteristics examined. In conclusion, GDCD is associated with double dose of the NOD2/CARD15 gene variants, particularly L1007P homozygosity. There is evidence of specific variant-phenotype associations. G908R heterozygosity is associated with ileal involvement and smoking, whereas L1007P homozygosity is strongly associated with GDCD and younger age at diagnosis.},

   abstract = {Short bowel syndrome (SBS) refers to the malabsorption of nutrients, water, and essential vitamins as a result of disease or surgical removal of parts of the small intestine. The most common reasons for removing part of the small intestine are due to surgical intervention for the treatment of either Crohn's disease or necrotizing enterocolitis. Intestinal adaptation following resection may take weeks to months to be achieved, thus nutritional support requires a variety of therapeutic measures, which include parenteral nutrition. Improper nutrition management can leave the SBS patient malnourished and/or dehydrated, which can be life threatening. The development of therapeutic strategies that reduce both the complications and medical costs associated with SBS/long-term parenteral nutrition while enhancing the intestinal adaptive response would be valuable. Currently, therapeutic options available for the treatment of SBS are limited. There are many potential stimulators of intestinal adaptation including peptide hormones, growth factors, and neuronally-derived components. Glucagon-like peptide-2 (GLP-2) is one potential treatment for gastrointestinal disorders associated with insufficient mucosal function. A significant body of evidence demonstrates that GLP-2 is a trophic hormone that plays an important role in controlling intestinal adaptation. Recent data from clinical trials demonstrate that GLP-2 is safe, well-tolerated, and promotes intestinal growth in SBS patients. However, the mechanism of action and the localization of the glucagon-like peptide-2 receptor (GLP-2R) remains an enigma. This review summarizes the role of a number of mucosal-derived factors that might be involved with intestinal adaptation processes; however, this discussion primarily examines the physiology, mechanism of action, and utility of GLP-2 in the regulation of intestinal mucosal growth.},

Many patients become dependent on IV fluids and nutrition. An adaptation process manifested clinically by decreased diarrhea and improved nutrient absorption according to decreased parenteral nutrition and fluid requirements has been noted to occur over time. In some patients, adaptation is inadequate and may require special techniques to enhance and augment this process. This is a case of a 52-year-old woman who experienced increased stoma output 1 week after major intestinal resection, resulting in dehydration. She required IV fluids in order to maintain hydration. After the initiation of an intestinal rehabilitation program, which included modified diet, soluble fiber, oral rehydration solution (ORS), and medications, IV fluids were successfully weaned off in 3 months. She continues not to receive IV fluids and continues to follow the intestinal rehabilitation plan.},

   abstract = {In Japan, nutritional therapy as both a primary and as a secondary treatment is widely used for Crohn's disease (CD). The rationale for its use is based on a variety of reasons. The first is its ability to induce remission and to ameliorate the activity of intestinal lesions in the short term by enteral (EN) or by parenteral nutritional therapy in which overexpressions of chemokine receptors in an active stage are decreased significantly in the remission stage. Second is its ability to maintain remission over the long term through home-based enteral nutrition in which tube feeding during the nighttime is encouraged. Third is its ability to reduce the steroid dosage over the period of a long-term treatment course. However, several disadvantages of this therapy such as unpalatability and sluggish effect have been pointed out. Several studies have attempted to resolve this issue and determine the best components of EN, especially in fat composition. Some data have been suggestive of too much long-chained fatty acid having a hazardous effect on EN's clinical efficacy because it works as a precursor of inflammatory prostaglandins. Our recent data show that medium-chained triglyceride did not have such a hazardous effect on clinical efficacy. Several studies suggested that the patient factors that were resistant to inducing remission in the short term were a long period of suffering CD, a high activity (on Crohn's Disease Activity Index, CDAI), hemorrhagic colitis, and colitis with marked cobblestoning. Japanese guidelines for the treatment of CD recommended nutritional therapy as a first-line therapy and as a maintenance therapy after inducing remission. This treatment policy has led to Japanese CD patients having lower mortality rates than that of patients who do not receive EN. If this therapy could be combined with other drug therapies, including strong immunosuppressants, treatment strategies would be improved over those we have at present.},

   abstract = {OBJECTIVE: The aim of this investigation was to elucidate retrospectively the therapeutic effect of infliximab in patients with active Crohn's disease (CD) under nutritional therapy. MATERIAL AND METHODS: Using a review of the clinical records in 24 nationwide institutions specializing in inflammatory bowel disease, the short-term effect of infliximab in 97 patients with active CD was retrospectively investigated. The Crohn's disease activity index (CDAI) at baseline and after 2 weeks of a single infliximab administration (5 mg/kg) was compared among patients under total parenteral nutrition (TPN group, n=36), those following an elemental or polymeric diet (EN group, n=49) and those without TPN and EN (NN group, n=12). A decrease in CDAI >or= 70 or a CDAI value <150 at 2 weeks was regarded as effective. RESULTS: There was no difference in CDAI at baseline among the three groups. In each group, CDAI decreased significantly (from 250 (195-290) [median (interquartiles)] to 152 (123-233) in the TPN group, p<0.0001; from 259 (200-325) to 180 (130-238) in the EN group, p<0.0001; from 278 (222-291) to 164 (132-196) in the NN group, p=0.003). Infliximab was effective in 63.9% of patients in the TPN group, in 55.1% of those in the EN group and in 75% of the NN group. There was no statistical difference in efficacy among the three groups (p=0.4). Multivariate logistic regression analysis revealed younger age to be a significant factor related to the efficacy of infliximab. CONCLUSIONS: Infliximab is effective in patients with CD under TPN or EN. Age at infliximab administration may be predictive of response to infliximab.},

AIMS: To compare vitamin D status and bone turnover markers in Crohn's disease patients with age- and sex-matched controls during late-summer and late-winter. SUBJECTS: Crohn's disease patients (n = 44; mean age 36.9 years, currently in remission) and matched controls (n = 44) were recruited from Cork University Hospital and Cork City area, respectively. METHODS: Bloods were analysed for 25-hydroxyvitamin D, parathyroid hormone, bone-specific alkaline phosphatase, osteocalcin and urine analysed for N-telopeptides of type 1 collagen. RESULTS: Serum 25-hydroxyvitamin D concentrations were significantly (P < 0.003) lower in Crohn's disease patients than in control subjects during both seasons. In Crohn's disease patients, serum 25-hydroxyvitamin D concentrations were lower (P < 0.0001) whereas serum parathyroid hormone, osteocalcin and bone-specific alkaline phosphatase and urinary N-telopeptides of type 1 collagen levels were higher (P < 0.001) during late-winter than late-summer. CONCLUSION: There were notable seasonal variations in vitamin D status and bone turnover markers in Crohn's disease patients. The impact of winter decline in vitamin D status and increase in bone turnover on long-term risk of osteopenia/osteoporosis in Crohn's disease patients is unclear.},

   abstract = {PURPOSE OF REVIEW: This review reports on the recent progress understanding mechanisms of action and clinical applications of probiotics. RECENT FINDINGS: New insights on regulating mechanisms of intestinal commensal bacteria to prevent and treat different gastrointestinal diseases have been reported. Some probiotics, though not all, exert beneficial effects by modulating the mucosal barrier function and immune activity. It seems that a combination of different probiotics is more effective than a single strain. It was demonstrated that not only viable bacteria administered to the intestinal tract but also isolated probiotic DNA is active, even if injected subcutaneously. There is reasonable evidence to recommend probiotics in infectious diarrhoea for prevention and treatment (mainly in children) and to prevent antibiotic-induced gastrointestinal side effects. Furthermore, probiotics are effective in maintaining remission in ulcerative colitis and preventing and treating pouchitis. Promising positive effects were published in major surgery patients (gastric resection, pancreatic resection, liver transplantation) and in severe necrotising acute pancreatitis. SUMMARY: Increasing knowledge on probiotics is exciting, but in the near future it must be defined which probiotics (single strains or a combination) are most effective in specific diseases. Well-designed, randomized clinical trials are still required to further define the role of probiotics as preventive and therapeutic agents.},

MATERIAL AND METHODS: Gathering of registry data introduced by all units responsible of HBPN patient care. This an on-line registry available for authorized users of the working group web page (www.nadya-senpe.com). Epidemiological data, diagnosis, access route, complications, hospital admissions, disability degree, and course at December 31st, 2003 RESULTS: Data from 86 patients (62% female and 38% male) from 17 hospitals were gathered. Mean age of adult patients was 50.7 +/- 15.0 years, whereas for patients younger than 14 years was 2.4 +/- 1.5 years (n = 5 patients). Diseases that prone HBPN were neoplasm (21%), followed by mesenteric ischemia (20%), radiation enteritis (16.3%), motility impairments (10.5%), and Crohn's disease (4.6%). Tunneled catheters were used in 66.3% of the cases versus 29.1% of subcutaneous reservoirs. Mean treatment duration has been 8.5 +/- 4.6 months; 67.4% of patients had been on HBPN for a period of time longer than 6 months. Patient follow-up was mostly done from the reference area hospital (88.4%). In no case patient follow-up was done by the primary care team or by specialists other than those prescribing nutritional support. Nutritional support-related complications were seen in 98 occasions. The most frequent complications were infectious ones. They represented 1.60 hospital admissions per patient. The mean number of visits was 7.9 per patient (6.4 for scheduled visits and 1.5 for emergency visits). By the end of the year, we observed that 73.3% of the patients were still on the program, whereas in 23.3% HBPN had been withdrawn. The main reasons for withdrawal were decease (11 patients), and advancing to oral diet (9 patients). As for the disability degree, 13% were confined to a wheelchair or bed, and only 28% had no disability degree or only mild social disability. CONCLUSIONS: We observed a mild increase in HBPN prevalence rate in Spain (2.15 patients pmp). The main indication was cancer followed by short-bowel syndrome secondary to vascular pathology. Nutritional support-related complications were common, especially those of an infectious origin.},

Epidemiological, diagnostic, access route, complications, hospital admissions, degree of disability, and course until December 31st of 2002. RESULTS: Data from 74 patients were gathered (56.8% women and 43.2% men), from 18 hospital centers. Mean age of adult patients was 49.4 +/- 15.5 years and 2.3-1.1 years for patients younger than 14 years (n=3 patients). Diseases that prompted the use of HPN were mesenteric ischemia (29.7%), followed by neoplasms (16.2%), radiation enteritis (12.2%), motility impairments (8.1%), and Crohn's disease (5.4%). Tunneled catheters were used in 52.7% of cases, as compared to 36.5% of subcutaneous reservoirs.

The present study was conducted to assess risk factors and outcomes in children with C difficile-associated diarrhea. METHODS: Laboratory records at a university-affiliated pediatric hospital were reviewed for all C difficile toxin-positive stools (cell culture cytotoxin assay) between 2000 and 2003. Charts on identified patients were reviewed. RESULTS: Two hundred patients with a diagnosis of C difficile-associated diarrhea were identified between February 2000 and November 2003. There were 107 males and 93 females (mean age 5.4 years; median age 2.6 years). Underlying factors were identified in 19% (12 patients underwent chemotherapy; seven patients had Crohn's disease; six were transplantation recipients; seven an immunodeficiency; four with Hirschsprung disease; two diagnoses of 'other'). Of the 200 identified patients, 149 (74.5%) had documentation of antibiotics in the previous two months (32 penicillins; 38 cephalosporins; three clindamycin, nine other single-agent, 59 multiple; eight not specified), and 111 (55.5%) had been hospitalized in the previous month. The symptoms of C difficile-associated diarrhea included bloody stools in 12.5% and frequent watery stools in 79%. Hospitalization was required in 27 of 116 outpatients; stay was prolonged in seven of the 84 patients already hospitalized. Fifty-five per cent received metronidazole, 34% were not treated, and treatment data were not available for the remainder. Recurrence occurred in 31% of those treated and retreatment consisted of vancomycin (15%), probiotics (15%) and cholestyramine (6%). No colectomies were required but two deaths occurred. CONCLUSIONS: The majority of pediatric patients developing symptomatic C difficile-associated diarrhea had antibiotic exposure or hospitalization within the previous one to two months. This is higher than previously reported. One-third had spontaneous symptom resolution. For those treated, recurrence rates were high. Mortality was significantly lower than described in adults, in agreement with prior literature.},

The second one of monozygotic twins does not develop the disease in 100% but only in 20-50%. To unravel these mysteries, literature was searched to determine the disease background and find suggestions for research and prevention. The causal antigen of coeliac disease is gluten of wheat that is neutralised in the intestine by secretory immune globulin A (sIgA). SIgA is secreted by the secondary (lymphoid) immune system that develops in a newborn infant after the primary (central) immune organs thymus and bone marrow have been primed with antigens of the intestine. Predisposed infants are sensitive for development of coeliac disease during the time without sIgA secretion into the intestine. The risk of the disease diminishes when sIgA cycles of gluten neutralisation develop. Peyer's patches (PP) of the secondary immune system play a central role in the cycles and possibly do not function well in the case of coeliac disease. Coeliac disease in predisposed infants may be prevented by delay of bread consumption till the time of normal sIgA secretion and by application of a challenge period with gluten (see Discussion). It is concluded that sIgA secretion into body cavities and malfunction of immune cells in PP should be included in the future research of coeliac disease as well as in more allergic diseases (type 1 diabetes, Crohn disease, asthma, hay fever).},

   abstract = {Intestinal failure can result from surgical resection, obstruction, dysmotility, congenital deficiencies or disease-associated loss of absorption. Before the development of intravenous feeding in the late 1960s, the condition was fatal, but by the 1990s approximately 40,000 patients were being successfully managed on long-term home parenteral nutrition (HPN) annually in the US. Survival on HPN depends on the nature of the underlying medical condition: over 80% of Crohn's disease patients survive for 5 years, but only 20% of cancer patients survive for 1 year. Although a patient's nutritional status is easy to maintain, there are serious long-term complications that arise from bypassing the gut and infusing nutrients directly into the systemic circulation. Catheter sepsis occurs about once per year (range 0-12 times). Abnormalities in liver function tests are common, but end-stage liver disease is rare. Central venous thrombosis develops in nearly all patients after 5 years. Although approximately 80% of patients on HPN are completely rehabilitated at home, their quality of life is impaired by the perpetual dependence on nocturnal intravenous infusions (every 8-12 h). In conclusion, HPN has allowed patients with previously fatal intestinal failure to survive and lead relatively normal lives at home, but their quality of life remains impaired by the dependence on intravenous infusions and complications that progress with time.},

   abstract = {BACKGROUND: Crohn's disease in childhood is a chronic relapsing condition. Fifteen to forty per cent of children with Crohn's disease have growth retardation (Griffiths 1993a). Some treatment modalities including corticosteroids have been implicated in growth failure but it is thought mainly to be secondary to uncontrolled disease activity (Motil 1993; Markowitz 1993). Growth is fundamental to the practice of pediatrics, so by taking growth as the primary outcome measure we address issues important to both patients, their families and pediatricians. OBJECTIVES: To evaluate the effectiveness of the different modalities available for the treatment of childhood Crohn's disease with regard to the reversal of growth failure and the promotion of normal growth. SEARCH STRATEGY: Searches were made of the following databases using the Collaborative Review Group Search Strategy: EMBASE (1984-2004), MEDLINE (1966-2004), The Cochrane Central Register of Controlled Trials, The Cochrane Inflammatory Bowel Disease and Functional Bowel Disorders Group Specialized Trials Register and the Science Citation Index. Abstracts from the major gastrointestinal research meetings and references from published articles were also reviewed. SELECTION CRITERIA: Randomized controlled trials pertaining to children less than 18 years of age with Crohn's disease were selected. Those with growth as an outcome measure were included in the review. DATA COLLECTION AND ANALYSIS: Data extraction and assessment of the methodological quality of each trial was independently reviewed by two reviewers. Only one good quality randomized controlled trial was included in the review and therefore no statistical analysis was possible. MAIN RESULTS: Three randomized controlled trials were identified. One was of good methodological quality (Markowitz 2000). This study looked at the use of 6-mercaptopurine (6-MP) as a steroid sparing agent. No difference in linear growth was observed between the intervention and placebo groups, although the total steroid dose received over the 18 month follow up period was reduced in the group receiving 6-MP. The two remaining randomized controlled trials (Sanderson 1987; Thomas 1993a) consider the use of enteral feeding versus corticosteroids for induction of remission, with height velocity standard deviation score at 6 months as an outcome measure. Although of less rigorous methodological quality, the results of these studies are discussed in detail in the review. In both studies height velocity standard deviation scores were significantly increased in the enteral feeding group compared with the corticosteroid group. AUTHORS' CONCLUSIONS: In addition to these randomized controlled trials, a body of lower quality evidence does exist relevant to two other important interventions; the use of supplemental enteral nutrition (Morin 1980; Belli 1988; Israel 1995) and the judicious use of surgical interventions in pre-pubertal children with refractory disease (Alperstein 1985; Lipson 1990; McLain 1990). Newer treatments, such as infliximab, are now becoming more widely used and may offer advantages in promoting growth. These effects are as yet unstudied. This review highlights the need for large, multi centre studies of the different treatment options in paediatric Crohn's disease and the importance of standardised measurements of growth, such as height velocity standard deviation scores and height standard deviation scores as outcome measures.},

Although moderate physical activity seems to reduce the risk of developing Crohn's disease, some high-performance athletes live with the disease. Uncontrolled Crohn's disease predisposes patients to numerous nutrient deficiencies and associated health issues such as anemia and osteoporosis. Low-intensity exercise has been shown to decrease flare-ups in sedentary patients; however, high-intensity exercise may lead to increased symptoms. Physicians play a crucial role in coordinating a team approach among the athlete, parents, coach, and athletic trainers to provide the best possible management of diet, training schedule, and treatment.},

   abstract = {AIM: To investigate the association between malnutrition and quality of life in patients with benign gastrointestinal disease. METHODS: Two hundred patients (104 wellnourished and 96 malnourished) were assessed according to the Subjective Global Assessment, anthropometric measurements and bioelectrical impedance analysis. Quality of life was determined with the validated Medical Outcomes Study 36-item Short-Form General Health Survey (SF 36). Muscle function was assessed by hand grip strength and peak flow. RESULTS: Body mass index, body cell mass, arm muscle area and hand grip strength were significantly lower in the malnourished patients. Quality of life was generally lower when compared to norm values. Seven out of eight quality of life scales (excluding bodily pain) were significantly reduced in the malnourished patients. Comparing patients with liver cirrhosis and inflammatory bowel disease (IBD), patients with IBD experienced significantly lower values in the perception of bodily pain,social functioning and mental health. Malnourished liver cirrhotics suffered reductions in more scales (six out of eight) than malnourished IBD patients did (four out of eight). CONCLUSION: Quality of life is generally low in benign gastrointestinal disease and is further reduced in patients who are classified as malnourished. It appears that liver cirrhosis patients experience a higher quality of life than IBD patients do, but the impact of malnutrition seems to be greater in liver cirrhosis than in IBD.},

   abstract = {BACKGROUND: Studies in animal models of inflammatory bowel disease (IBD) suggest that supplementation of total parenteral nutrition with glutamine (gln), a conditionally essential amino acid in catabolic conditions, increases gln plasma concentrations, reduces intestinal damage, improves nitrogen balance and may improve the course of the disease. However, human data supporting this assumption are missing. METHODS: A total of 24 consecutive patients with an acute exacerbation of IBD (19 Crohn's disease; five ulcerative colitis) and scheduled for total parenteral nutrition (TPN) (>7 days) were randomised. Parallel to a standardised anti-inflammatory therapy, the patients received either a TPN with 1.5 g/kg body weight of a standard amino acid or an isonitrogenic, isocaloric TPN with 1.2 g/kg body weight of a standard amino acid and 0.3 g/kg L-alanine-L-glutamine. Primary end points were gln plasma concentrations and intestinal permeability assessed by urinary lactulose and D-xylose ratio. RESULTS: Gln plasma levels did not differ significantly in either group throughout the study. Intestinal permeability did not change within 7 days either with or without gln supplementation (Delta-lactulose/xylose ratio: 0.01+/-0.05 (gln+) vs 0.02+/-0.1 (gln-)). The observed changes in inflammatory and nutritional parameters, and also disease activity, length of TPN and hospital stay, were independent of glutamine substitution. Five (41%) patients in the gln+ group and three (25%) patients in the gln- group needed surgical intervention. CONCLUSION: Although limited by the sample size, these results do not support the hypothesis that glutamine substitution has an obvious biochemical or clinical benefit in patients with active IBD scheduled for total parenteral nutrition.},

   abstract = {Nutrition has an important role in the management of inflammatory bowel disease. This role includes the prevention and correction of malnutrition, the prevention of osteoporosis and in children the promotion of optimal growth and development. In active Crohn's disease nutritional therapy (in the form of enteral feeding) is an effective primary therapy for many patients. Corticosteroids, however, are more effective than enteral diet therapy in adults. Enteral diets should be considered as primary therapy in pediatric Crohn's disease, especially in children with poor nutritional status or growth impairment. Enteral nutrition does not have a proven primary therapeutic role in ulcerative colitis. There are many theories that suggest that diet may be implicated in the aetiology of inflammatory bowel disease, however, there are, as yet, no dietary approaches proven to reduce the risk of developing IBD.},

   abstract = {BACKGROUND AND AIMS: Assessment of health-related quality of life (HRQOL) is of increasing importance in the evaluation of new therapies for inflammatory bowel disease (IBD). Available data concerning HRQOL in pediatric patients are sparse and uniformly cross-sectional. The aim of this study was to describe HRQOL and influential factors in newly diagnosed pediatric patients with Crohn's disease and ulcerative colitis during the first 12 months after diagnosis. MATERIALS AND METHODS: Participants were drawn from a large, prospectively derived observational IBD registry of pediatric patients studied through 18 U.S. and Canadian centers. Patients who had completed a baseline IMPACT questionnaire and for whom there were 12 months of follow-up data available were included. In addition to description of cohort, factors that were believed to influence HLQOL were assessed during the course of the year from diagnosis. RESULTS: Two hundred eighteen children met inclusion criteria (77% Crohn's disease, 23 % ulcerative colitis, mean age 12.7 +/- 1.9 years). Mean total IMPACT score at baseline was 154, 181 at 6 months, and 191 at 1 year (possible range 0-238, with increasing scores representing better quality of life). Repeated measures analysis showed that age and disease severity significantly negatively affected the IMPACT scores during the course of the year. CONCLUSIONS: In this large prospective pediatric IBD cohort, significant improvement in HRQOL is noted during the year from diagnosis. Mean IMPACT scores varied significantly depending on the disease severity and also decreased with increasing age.},

CONCLUSION: The height-for-age and the BMI-for-age, as evaluated by z-scores, of children with ulcerative colitis (UC) did not differ from those of normal Danish children, but Crohn's disease (CD) children had significantly lower height and BMI values, both when compared to normal children and children with UC. In contrast to UC, CD is frequently complicated by malnutrition and growth retardation at the time of diagnosis.},

   abstract = {OBJECTIVES: Previous studies of vitamin D status in pediatric patients with inflammatory bowel disease have revealed conflicting results. We sought to report (1) the prevalence of vitamin D deficiency (serum 25-hydroxy-vitamin D concentration < or = 15 ng/mL) in a large population with inflammatory bowel disease, (2) factors predisposing to this problem, and (3) its relationship to bone health and serum parathyroid hormone concentration. PATIENTS AND METHODS: A total of 130 patients (8-22 years of age) with inflammatory bowel disease, 94 with Crohn disease and 36 with ulcerative colitis, had serum 25-hydroxy-vitamin D, intact parathyroid hormone, and lumbar spine bone mineral density (using dual-energy x-ray absorptiometry) measured at Children's Hospital Boston. RESULTS: The prevalence of vitamin D deficiency was 34.6%. Mean serum 25-hydroxy-vitamin D concentration was similar in patients with Crohn disease and ulcerative colitis, 52.6% lower among patients with dark skin complexion, 33.4% lower during the winter months (December 22 to March 21), and 31.5% higher among patients who were taking vitamin D supplements. Serum 25-hydroxy-vitamin D concentration was positively correlated with weight and BMI z score, disease duration, and serum albumin concentration and negatively correlated with erythrocyte sedimentation rate. Patients with Crohn disease and upper gastrointestinal tract involvement were more likely to be vitamin D deficient than those without it. Serum 25-hydroxy-vitamin concentration was not associated with lumbar spine bone mineral density z score or serum parathyroid hormone concentration. CONCLUSIONS: Vitamin D deficiency is highly prevalent among pediatric patients with inflammatory bowel disease. Factors predisposing to the problem include having a dark-skin complexion, winter season, lack of vitamin D supplementation, early stage of disease, more severe disease, and upper gastrointestinal tract involvement in patients with Crohn disease. The long-term significance of hypovitaminosis D for this population is unknown at present and merits additional study.},

   abstract = {GOALS: Our goals were to answer 2 questions: (1) Is the presentation of early-onset inflammatory bowel disease (IBD) similar to typical adolescent-onset IBD? (2) Is there variability in familial aggregation in childhood IBD? BACKGROUND: The phenotype of IBD in children under 5 years of age (early-onset) is poorly defined. Clinical and genetic studies of IBD, however, generally assume the phenotype to be homogenous throughout childhood. STUDY: We analyzed data from 413 consecutive pediatric IBD outpatients attending our center between 1995 and 2000. Disease type, anatomic distribution, and family history were compared between children presenting before (early-onset) and after the age of five (5 to 15 y). RESULTS: Disease presentation was predominantly colonic in early-onset IBD, most patients presenting with ulcerative colitis (UC). Isolated colonic disease was most frequent in early-onset Crohn disease (colonic 76.5%, ileocolic 24%) compared with ileocolic disease (ileocolic 45.5%, colonic 26%, ileal 19.4%, proximal 6.3%) in the older age group. First-degree family history was highest in early-onset UC 26% versus 11% in the older UC group. CONCLUSIONS: We describe a distinct phenotype of early childhood onset IBD, with a strikingly high familial aggregation in UC and greater tendency to present with colonic disease. As more genetic heterogeneity is identified in IBD, careful definition of phenotype is required to identify further susceptibility genes. The early-onset form of UC presents an ideal group for further genetic analysis. These phenotype differences also suggest that treatment and outcome may vary in early-onset childhood IBD; prospective studies are required to confirm this.},

   abstract = {Capsule endoscopy has revolutionised the management of digestive tract diseases by providing a new non-invasive way to view the entire small bowel mucosa directly. Obscure gastrointestinal bleeding is the primary and best validated indication to capsule endoscopy, which when used as first-line exploration is the most efficient strategy as regards diagnosis. In these patients, the technique is also helpful for effective decision-making concerning subsequent treatments. There is significant uncertainty regarding the role of capsule endoscopy in patients with Crohn's disease. Although it is clearly more sensitive than conventional imaging modalities, the implications of the lesions identified with this technique are not fully understood. Further prospective studies are required to identify the clinical settings where capsule endoscopy is most effective in these patients. Capsule endoscopy may potentially lead to diagnosis of small bowel tumours earlier in their course; it should be used as first-line surveillance procedure in patients with Peutz-Jeghers syndrome, and it may be of clinical value in selected patients with familial adenomatous polyposis. Although preliminary results are promising, additional research is necessary to determine its role in the diagnosis and management of coeliac disease, as well as for the diagnosis of oesophageal and large bowel disorders. Well-designed studies are also needed to better define the impact of capsule endoscopy on health care use and clinical outcome of patients with intestinal diseases.},

   abstract = {INTRODUCTION: The association of inflammatory bowel disease (IBD) with decreased bone mineral density is well recognized. In the adult population, up to 50% of IBD patients are reported to have osteopenia, correlating with an increase in the incidence of fractures as compared with controls. The aim of this study was to determine the prevalence of fractures in a pediatric population with IBD as compared with healthy sibling controls (SC). PATIENTS AND METHODS: The families of 209 patients with IBD were sent a questionnaire asking them to compare their children with IBD to a healthy sibling (non-IBD). RESULTS: Surveys were returned by 132 of the 209 families (63%). The sample characteristics of this sample closely resembled the overall clinic population for age (mean 14.3 vs 14.7 years), gender (53% vs 59% male) and diagnosis (58.1 vs 57.8 Crohn disease). Completed surveys described 263 children. Of the 132 with IBD 73 (55%) had Crohn disease, 52 (39%) had ulcerative colitis and 7 (6%) had indeterminate colitis. There were 76/132 males (age range, 4-18 years) with IBD and 64/131 males (age range, 1-26 years) in the sibling controls. Mean ages of the IBD sample 14.3 +/-.3 was compared with 13.9 +/- in SC. Of the total group, 73/263 (28%) reported ever having a fracture, 44 (60%) were siblings (SC), and 29 (40%) had IBD. Of the 29 children with IBD, 17 (59%) reported having a fracture after diagnosis including 2 who had fractures both before and after diagnosis. The total number of fractures reported was 96 (55 SC:41 IBD). CONCLUSION: In this survey, we found no statistically significant difference in the prevalence of fracture in IBD patients compared with their normal siblings.},

   abstract = {Defensins and cathelicidins are prevalent and essential gastrointestinal cationic antimicrobial peptides (CAPs). However, these defensive peptides are not infallible because certain enteropathogens can overcome their protective function. Furthermore, impaired defensin synthesis has been linked to the occurrence of Crohn's disease (CD), a chronic inflammatory bowel disease. Recently, defective bacterial sensing through NOD1 and NOD2 has been related to reduced defensin production, CD predisposition and susceptibility to enteric infection. Hence, we propose that microbial sensors at the gut interface monitor the levels of these effector peptides, which might function as "danger" signals to confer tolerance and alert immunocytes. Further work is required to clarify how gastrointestinal CAPs are regulated and to assess their role in maintaining epithelial homeostasis and triggering adaptive immunity.},

In adults, the use of artificial nutrition is indicated in the event of malnutrition, short bowel syndrome, or IBD refractory to all other treatments. In children, enteral nutrition has a place as first-line treatment to avoid side effects of corticosteroids on growth. The use, as a therapeutic tool, of specific nutrients (n-3 fatty acids, glutamine, antioxydant vitamins and minerals, TGF-beta, probiotics...) seems interesting at the pathophysiological level. Nevertheless, these nutrients are still under evaluation and there are not enough available studies to recommend them in clinical routine. A very promising solution is the use of probiotics for the treatment of refractory pouchitis.},

   abstract = {BACKGROUND: The aim of this study was to assess the pediatric population that suffered from inflammatory bowel disease (IBD) in the Czech Republic and to determine the incidence of Crohn disease (CD) in children up to 15 years age between 1990 and 2001. METHODS: Diagnostic criteria for CD, ulcerative colitis (UC), and indeterminate colitis (IC) were defined. Medical records provided a source of basic information about the children. A standardized protocol was filled out and sent to the coordinator of the study. All protocols were checked to see whether the data corresponded to the defined criteria and then were processed further. The study was retrospective in character for the years 1990 to 1999 and prospective for the years 2000 and 2001. RESULTS: Diagnostic criteria were met in 470 patients with IBD; 201 of them turned 18 years old during the study period. CD was diagnosed in 223 patients. The incidence of CD in children up to 15 years of age increased from 0.25/100,000 in 1990 to 1.25/100,000 in 2001. Eighty-two percent of children with CD were treated with aminosalicylates in combination with corticosteroids; 29% of patients received azathioprine. Severe growth retardation was recorded in 6.4% of adolescents with CD at the age of 18. UC was diagnosed in 202 patients. Therapy with aminosalicylates only was sufficient for control of the disease in 23% patients; 68% children were treated with corticosteroids, 15 of them (23% of the whole group) received additional azathioprine. Criteria for IC were met in 9.8% of all patients with IBD. CONCLUSION: This study confirmed an increase in incidence of CD in children younger than 15 years in the Czech Republic.},

   abstract = {OBJECTIVES: To investigate the subjective treatment goals of insulin-treated diabetic patients. METHODS: 297 type 1 and 205 type 2 diabetic patients, representative of the North-western Swiss population, filled out a self report questionnaire focusing on their own treatment goals using standardized measures wherever available. Factor analysis of the 16 items reflecting their treatment goals revealed four subscales (Crohnbach's alpha): High actual quality of life (0.73), weight reduction/maintenance and daily hassles (0.68), good medical care and knowledge (0.64) and good long term glucose control (0.71). RESULTS: Good long term glucose control was the single most important main treatment goal for most patients (type 1: 60.2%, type 2: 49.7%, p = 0.025). However, both type 1 and type 2 diabetic patients believed that this goal - especially the value of HbA1c - was overestimated (both p <0.0001), while high actual quality of life was underestimated (p = 0.003 and p = 0.05, respectively) by their physicians compared to their own assessment. Good long term glucose control (OR 1.63, p = 0.003) and high actual quality of life (OR 2.17, p <0.0001) were more important and weight reduction/maintenance and coping with daily hassles (OR 0.75, p = 0.07) were slightly less important treatment goals for type 1 than for type 2 diabetic patients. These differences in goals were best associated with the mode of insulin therapy, self-monitoring, and with the extent of diabetes education. CONCLUSIONS: Patients believe that physicians overestimate the importance of long term glucose control and underestimate the importance of actual quality of life. Diabetes education and self management have the largest impact on patients' own treatment goals.},

   abstract = {Inflammatory Bowel Disease (IBD) is common in most industrialised countries and childhood IBD accounts for nearly 30% of total cases. Various studies, mostly from Europe and USA have reported epidemiological characteristics of childhood IBD. The incidence figures vary greatly from region to region and within a region over time. Almost all reported studies have documented an increase in the incidence, mainly of Crohn's disease over the last few decades. The reasons for the increase are not clear but epidemiological observations have led to many postulates. Incidence in developing countries is perceived to be low, but limited data suggest that it may not be as uncommon as previously thought. IBD can occur at any age but is rare in infancy. Among childhood IBD, early onset IBD appears to be different epidemiologically and is characterised by predominance of colonic involvement and high positive family history. It has become apparent that only about 25% of childhood Crohn's disease presents with classical triad of abdominal pain, diarrhoea and weight loss. Pediatricians should be aware of atypical manifestations and should maintain high index of suspicion. Though epidemiological studies of childhood IBD done so far have contributed towards understanding of IBD, they have differed in study design, population, time period, age group and case definitions. Unfortunately there are no uniform, clear diagnostic criteria which are evidence based. To address this problem, recently the IBD working group of European Society of Pediatric Gastroenterology, Hepatology and Nutrition (ESPGHAN) has published "The Porto Criteria" which details a consensus based diagnostic criteria for the diagnosis of childhood IBD. This should bring uniformity in ascertainment of newly diagnosed IBD cases. An European multicentre prospective database has also been established to facilitate future epidemiological studies.},

   abstract = {OBJECTIVES: The incidence and age of onset of inflammatory bowel disease (IBD) appear to be changing. The aim of this study was to determine whether the prevalence of cigarette smoking differs among patients with Crohn's disease (CD) or ulcerative colitis (UC) at the time of diagnosis compared with the general population and whether smoking history is related to the type and age of IBD onset. METHODS: Prevalence rates of smoking at the time of IBD diagnosis were compared between patients with CD and UC from the IBD Center at the University of Pittsburgh Medical Center versus age-, gender-, and time period-adjusted rates in the Pennsylvania general population. Analyses also were stratified by gender and diagnoses before and after 40 years of age, i.e., early and late onset. RESULTS: There were 263 IBD patients (144 UC patients and 119 CD patients) seen in the IBD center between August 2000 and December 2002. The prevalence of active smoking was significantly higher at diagnosis in CD patients compared with the Pennsylvania general population (33% versus 24%, P = 0.04), particularly in those with CD onset at 40 years of age or later (47% versus 27%, P = 0.005). In contrast, smoking prevalence was significantly lower in UC patients than the general population (9% versus 28%, P < 0.0001), particularly among those with UC onset before the age of 40 years (6% versus 27%, P < 0.0001). Smoking cessation was associated with an approximate, but nonsignificant, 3-fold higher likelihood of late-onset UC compared with CD. CONCLUSIONS: Cigarette smoking is associated with the development of late-onset CD and is protective against developing UC at any age, particularly early onset. Former smoking is associated with a high likelihood of developing late-onset UC, but not CD.},

AIMS: To examine the interactions between immune activation and nutritional parameters in adult Crohn's disease patients. PATIENTS AND METHODS: We analysed anthropometric and biochemical nutritional parameters in 40 Crohn's disease patients and 26 healthy controls, and related them to inflammatory and immune markers. RESULTS: Weight, body mass index, mid-arm circumference, triceps skinfold thickness, as well as albumin, transthyretin, retinol binding protein, insulin growth factor-I and Vitamin A were significantly decreased in Crohn's disease patients and negatively correlated to disease activity. By contrast, erythrocyte sedimentation rate, fibrinogen, C-reactive protein, alpha1-acylglycoprotein, soluble receptor of interleukin-2, blood neopterin, tumour necrosis factor-alpha and interleukin-1beta concentrations were significantly higher in patients and positively correlated to disease activity. Nutritional parameters and acute phase reactants were linked to tumour necrosis factor-alpha and interleukin-1beta concentrations, and markers of nutritional status were negatively correlated to positive acute phase reactants. CONCLUSIONS: In Crohn's disease, inflammatory cytokines appear partly responsible for decreased nutritional status. Thus, nutritional intervention to correct nutritional (in particular protein) depletion, and/or therapeutic intervention reducing inflammation and therefore restoring adequate nutritional proteins synthesis, appears a major therapeutic goal in active Crohn's disease.},

   abstract = {OBJECTIVES: Certain genetic variants in the CARD15 gene are accompanied by an enhanced risk to develop Crohn disease with the main activity in the terminal ileum and ensuing stricturing early in life. The objective of this study was to evaluate the relation between CARD15 mutations and overall disease activity and response to therapy in pediatric patients. METHODS: 65 genomic DNA samples from such patients were tested for the presence of three main Crohn associated mutations in CARD15 by direct genomic sequencing. The number of mutations (none, one or two alleles affected) was correlated with body mass index and height, Pediatric Crohn Disease Activity Index, therapy and therapeutical success in terms of body mass index and Pediatric Crohn Disease Activity Index improvement. RESULTS: The authors found a nonsignificant trend of a lower body mass index and higher Pediatric Crohn Disease Activity Index in patients with CARD15 mutations. Physicians uninformed about their CARD15 status prescribed significantly more budesonide and prednisolone intermittently and more alimentary supplementation to these patients. The average improvement in terms of body mass index and Pediatric Crohn Disease Activity Index after 2 years of therapy was roughly similar in all patient groups. CONCLUSIONS: Pediatric Crohn patients with CARD15 mutations have a higher disease activity and need a more intensive therapy. With some exceptions, their medium-term response to therapy is nevertheless satisfying.},

   abstract = {BACKGROUND: An 18-year-old woman with a history of Crohn's disease presented in January 2004 with severe epigastric pain, nausea and vomiting of 4 hours' duration. The patient was diagnosed with inflammatory bowel disease, thought to be consistent with ulcerative colitis, in March 2003, but had no medical history up until this point. Initial treatment with mesalamine was unsuccessful and she subsequently presented with medically resistant fulminant colitis and required an urgent colectomy in June 2003. Her immediate postoperative course was uneventful and she was discharged on tapering doses of prednisone. In August 2003, an ileoscopy revealed inflamed, mildly ulcerated mucosa, and biopsies were consistent with Crohn's disease. Azathioprine was added to the treatment regimen and the patient tapered off prednisone. At this stage the patient continued to do well clinically up until presentation. INVESTIGATIONS: Small bowel series, abdominal CT scan, abdominal ultrasound, exploratory laparotomy. DIAGNOSIS: Acute mesenteric ischemia secondary to superior mesenteric vein thrombosis. MANAGEMENT: Resection of necrotic bowel, antibiotics and systemic anticoagulation.},

   abstract = {BACKGROUND: Inflammatory bowel disease (IBD) is recognized in young children, however, only rare data on onset and evolution are available in children younger than 1 year. In the present clinical study, we aimed to analyze characteristics and clinical course of children with very early onset IBD. We were particularly interested in the relationship between bacterial infections and the use of antibiotics before the onset of IBD. PATIENTS AND METHODS: The IBD database of Necker-Enfants-Malades-Hospital was screened for patients with IBD with disease onset during the first year of life and a follow-up of at least 2.5 years. Ten patients were identified during the period 1996-2002. RESULTS: All patients presented with rectal bleeding and had colonic involvement. Four patients had definitive diagnosis of Crohn disease; ulcerative or indeterminate colitis was seen in 2 and 4 children, respectively. Five of the patients had a positive history of neonatal or early-onset bacterial infection with use of antibiotics before onset of IBD, 4 patients were still breastfed and 3 just weaned when GI symptoms started. Seven patients had a severe onset of disease requiring bowel rest, parenteral nutrition and steroid medication, followed by azathioprine or cyclosporine medication. Surgery was necessary in 3 of 10 patients. Disease relapses were frequent and observed in 8 of 10 children. DISCUSSION: Very early onset IBD may reflect a subgroup of patients characterized by a particular sensitivity to modifications of the intestinal flora. Neonatal IBD was most often severe in presentation and evolution.},

   abstract = {Ulcerative colitis (UC) and Crohn disease (CD) are chronic intestinal inflammatory diseases that can present as bloody diarrhea, abdominal pain, and malnutrition. Collectively, these disorders are referred to as inflammatory bowel disease (IBD). All patients with IBD share a common pathophysiology. However, there are a number of developmental, psychosocial, and physiologic issues that are unique to the approximate, equals 20% of patients that present during childhood or adolescence. These include the possibility of disease-induced delays in linear growth or physical development, differences in drug dosing, and the changes in social and cognitive development that occur as children move from school-age years into adolescence and early adulthood. Gastroenterologists caring for these children must therefore develop an optimal regimen of pharmacologic therapies, nutritional management, psychologic support, and properly timed surgery (when necessary) that will maintain disease remission, minimize disease and drug-induced adverse effects, and optimize growth and development. This article reviews current approaches to the management of patients with UC and CD and highlights issues specific to the treatment of children with IBD. The principal medical therapies used to induce disease remission in patients with UC are aminosalicylates (for mild disease), corticosteroids (for moderate disease), and cyclosporine (ciclosporin) (for severe disease). If a patient responds to the induction regimen, maintenance therapies that are used to prevent disease relapse include aminosalicylates, mercaptopurine, and azathioprine. Colectomy with creation of an ileal pouch anal anastomosis (J pouch) has become the standard of care for patients with severe or refractory colitis and results in an improved quality of life in most patients. Therefore, the risks associated with using increasingly potent immunosuppressant agents must be balanced in each case against a patient's desire to retain their colon and avoid a temporary or potentially permanent ileostomy. Decisions about drug therapy in the management of patients with CD are more complex and depend on both the location (e.g. gastroduodenal vs small intestinal vs colonic), as well as the behavior of the disease (inflammatory/mucosal vs stricturing vs perforating) in a given patient. Induction therapies for CD typically include aminosalicylates and antibiotics (for mild mucosal disease), nutritional therapy (including elemental or polymeric formulas), corticosteroids (for moderate disease), and infliximab (for corticosteroid-resistant or fistulizing disease). Aminosalicylates, mercaptopurine, azathioprine, methotrexate, and infliximab can be used as maintenance therapies. Because surgical treatment of CD is not curative, it is typically reserved for those patients either with persistent symptoms and disease limited to a small section of the intestine (e.g. the terminal ileum and cecum) or for the management of complications of the disease including stricture or abdominal abscess. When surgery is necessary, maintenance medications administered postoperatively will postpone recurrence. Patients with UC and CD are at risk for the development of micronutrient deficiencies (including folate, iron, and vitamin D deficiencies) and require close nutritional monitoring. In addition, patients with UC and CD involving the colon are at increased risk of developing colon cancer, and should be enrolled into a colonoscopy surveillance program after 8-10 years of disease duration.},

   abstract = {A considerable literature has been published on the health benefits of fish, oil-rich fish and fish oils and their constituent long-chain (LC) n-3 PUFA. Evidence from epidemiological studies highlights the cardioprotective attributes of diets rich in fish, especially oil-rich fish. Data from intervention trials are consistent in suggesting that LC n-3 PUFA lower the risk of CVD, probably by the multiple mechanisms of lowering serum triacylglycerols, improving the LDL:HDL ratio, anti-arrhythmic effects on heart muscle, improved plaque stability, anti-thrombotic effects and reduced endothelial activation. Research indicates LC n-3 PUFA provision has an impact during development, and there is preliminary evidence that docosahexaenoic acid supplementation during pregnancy could optimise brain and retina development in the infant. LC n-3 PUFA are also postulated to ameliorate behavioural and mental health disturbances such as depression, schizophrenia, dementia and attention deficit hyperactivity disorder. However, despite some positive evidence in each of these areas, use of LC n-3 PUFA in these conditions remains at the experimental stage. In the case of immune function, there is little doubt that LC n-3 PUFA have a positive effect. Although intervention trials in rheumatoid arthritis show strong evidence of benefit, evidence for efficacy in other inflammatory conditions, including Crohn's disease, ulcerative colitis, psoriasis, lupus, multiple sclerosis, cystic fibrosis and asthma, is inconsistent or inadequate. More promising evidence in some conditions may come from studies which attempt to modify the fetal environment using LC n-3 PUFA supplementation during pregnancy.},

   abstract = {To evaluate the role of dietary factors in the etiology of inflammatory bowel disease (IBD), we conducted a multicenter hospital-based case-control study in a Japanese population. Cases were IBD patients aged 15 to 34 years [ulcerative colitis (UC) 111 patients; Crohn's disease (CD) 128 patients] within 3 years after diagnosis in 13 hospitals. One control subject was recruited for each case who was matched for sex, age, and hospital. A semiquantitative food frequency questionnaire was used to estimate preillness intakes of food groups and nutrients. All the available control subjects (n = 219) were pooled, and unconditional logistic models were applied to calculate odds ratios (ORs). In the food groups, a higher consumption of sweets was positively associated with UC risk [OR for the highest versus lowest quartile, 2.86; 95% confidence interval (CI), 1.24 to 6.57], whereas the consumption of sugars and sweeteners (OR, 2.12; 95% CI, 1.08 to 4.17), sweets (OR, 2.83; 95% CI, 1.38 to 5.83), fats and oils (OR, 2.64; 95% CI, 1.29 to 5.39), and fish and shellfish (OR, 2.41; 95% CI, 1.18-4.89) were positively associated with CD risk. In respect to nutrients, the intake of vitamin C (OR, 0.45; 95% CI, 0.21 to 0.99) was negatively related to UC risk, while the intake of total fat (OR, 2.86; 95% CI, 1.39 to 5.90), monounsaturated fatty acids (OR, 2.49; 95% CI, 1.23 to 5.03) and polyunsaturated fatty acids (OR, 2.31; 95% CI, 1.12 to 4.79), vitamin E (OR, 3.23; 95% CI, 1.45 to 7.17), and n-3 (OR, 3.24; 95% CI, 1.52 to 6.88) and n-6 fatty acids (OR, 2.57; 95% CI, 1.24 to 5.32) was positively associated with CD risk. Although this study suffers from the shortcoming of recall bias, which is inherent in most retrospective studies (prospective studies are warranted to confirm the associations between diet and IBD risk), the present findings suggest the importance of dietary factors for IBD prevention.},

   abstract = {Inflammatory diseases frequently impair linear growth. Crohn's disease inhibits growth in up to one third of affected children. In rats with trinitrobenzenesulphonic acid-induced colitis, 40% of growth impairment is attributable to inflammation, with the rest being due to undernutrition. In transgenic mice without inflammation, raised IL-6 retards growth, suppressing insulin-like growth factor (IGF)-I. We hypothesized that IL-6, induced by intestinal inflammation, suppresses growth and inhibits IGF-I expression. Therefore, an anti-IL-6 Ab was given to rats with trinitrobenzene-sulphonic acid colitis. The Ab did not improve nutrient intake or decrease inflammation compared with untreated disease controls, but it significantly restored linear growth (P = 0.023) and increased IGF-I (P = 0.05). In humans, the IL-6 -174 G/C promoter polymorphism affects IL-6 transcription, with the GG genotype inducing the greatest IL-6 levels. Because IL-6 is increased in Crohn's disease, we further hypothesized that growth failure would vary with the IL-6 -174 genotype. At diagnosis, among 153 children with Crohn's disease, those with the IL-6 GG genotype were more growth-retarded than those with the GC or CC genotypes (height SD score, -0.51 vs. -0.10; P = 0.031). Also, the patients with the IL-6 GG genotype had higher circulating levels of C-reactive protein, an IL-6-induced product (36 vs. 18 mg/dl, P = 0.028). However, their risk of developing Crohn's disease was similar to other genotypes when compared with 351 healthy controls (P = 0.7). Thus, the IL-6 -174 genotype mediates growth failure in children with Crohn's disease.},

   abstract = {BACKGROUND: A casein-based formula containing TGF-beta has been successfully used in adolescents during acute episodes of Crohn's disease. The role played by this molecule requires confirmation. We have examined the capacity of a TGF-beta containing diet to control the intestinal inflammation in HLA-B27 transgenic rats, and compared its effects with a similar diet devoid of TGF-beta. METHODS: Three groups of rats were studied. HLA-B27/hbeta2M transgenic rats were fed with a casein-based rat-adapted diet containing TGF-beta or a control casein-based diet without TGF-beta. Fischer control animals were fed the latter. Body weight, dietary intake, tissue weights, fecal samples, leukocyte counts, and acute phase response were analyzed. Intestinal inflammation was assessed by histology, myeloperoxidase, and mRNA expression of cytokines. MUC2 protein expression was assessed by immunohistochemistry. Breakdown of muscle protein was examined. RESULTS: The test diet improved diarrhea increasing the fecal dry matter and the colonic inflammation as shown by a lower inflammatory score (2.43 +/- 1.13 vs 4.42 +/- 0.53, p < .05), lower mucosal thickness (431.25 +/- 72.29 vs 508.57 +/- 81.32 microm, p = .08) and decreased IFNgamma mRNA expression. MUC2 protein expression was increased in HLA rats fed the TGF-beta diet compared with HLA rats fed the control diet, but restitution to normal pattern was not observed. The test diet also decreased leukocytosis and the acute phase response and improved the muscle catabolic response. CONCLUSION: The TGF-beta containing diet has a beneficial effect in an animal model of intestinal inflammation. Our observations support a potential role for dietary TGF-beta in the restoration of immune homeostasis.},

   abstract = {BACKGROUND: Anemia in patients with Crohn's disease (CD) is a common problem of multifactorial origin, including blood loss, malabsorption of iron, and anemia of inflammation. Anemia of inflammation is caused by the effects of inflammatory cytokines [predominantly interleukin-6 (IL-6)] on iron transport in enterocytes and macrophages. We sought to elucidate alterations in iron absorption in pediatric patients with active and inactive CD. METHODS: Nineteen subjects with CD (8 female, 11 male patients) were recruited between April 2003 and June 2004. After an overnight fast, serum iron and hemoglobin levels, serum markers of inflammation [IL-6, C-reactive protein (CRP), and erythrocyte sedimentation rate], and a urine sample for hepcidin assay were obtained at 8 am. Ferrous sulfate (1 mg/kg) was administered orally, followed by determination of serum iron concentrations hourly for 4 hours after the ingestion of iron. An area under the curve for iron absorption was calculated for each patient data set. RESULTS: There was a strong inverse correlation between the area under the curve and IL-6 (P = 0.002) and area under the curve and CRP levels (P = 0.04). Similarly, the difference between baseline and 2-hour serum iron level (Delta[Fe]2hr) correlated with IL-6 (P = 0.008) and CRP (P = 0.045). When cutoff values for IL-6 (>5 pg/mL) and CRP (>1.0 mg/dL) were used, urine hepcidin levels also positively correlated with IL-6 and CRP levels (P = 0.003 and 0.007, respectively). CONCLUSIONS: Subjects with active CD have impaired oral iron absorption and elevated IL-6 levels compared with subjects with inactive disease. These findings suggest that oral iron may be of limited benefit to these patients. Future study is needed to define the molecular basis for impaired iron absorption.},

   abstract = {INTRODUCTION: Lymphonodular hyperplasia (LNH) is a mass of lymphoid tissue that has been described in the terminal ileum, colon and duodenum mainly in children. Controversy exists regarding the benign nature of LNH. The combination of chronic abdominal pain and hematochezia leads many of these patients to undergo investigations for inflammatory bowel diseases. NOD2/CARD15 on chromosome 16 has been identified as a susceptibility gene for Crohn disease (CD). No study has yet examined the possible association of NOD2/CARD15 mutations with patients with LNH. The purpose of this study was to investigate the presence of NOD2/CARD15 mutations in patients with clinically proven LNH. METHODS: Children and young adults with gastrointestinal symptoms diagnosed as having terminal ileum LNH were eligible for the study. RESULTS: The study group consisted of 32 patients (15 males and 17 females), age range 3-23 years, mean 13.1 +/- 5 years. Twenty-seven (84%) had abdominal pain, 3 (9%) had rectal bleeding. The duration of symptoms ranged from 1-60 months (17.9 +/- 14.5). Only 2 patients (6.2%) were found to be heterozygote for the NOD2/CARD15 mutation (1007 fs), whereas all of the others did not carry any of the 3 common mutant alleles. This number is significantly lower (P < 0.001) than the mutation prevalence demonstrated in both pediatric and adult Israeli CD patients. CONCLUSIONS: NOD2/CARD15 mutations are not associated with LNH. This may strengthen the lack of association between CD and LNH that has been previously reported. We suggest that genotyping NOD2/CARD15 may help to distinguish LNH from inflammatory bowel diseases in selected patients.},

   abstract = {PURPOSE: To describe the reported health-related quality of life (HRQOL) in children and adolescents with inflammatory bowel disease (IBD) after attending an IBD summer camp. METHODS: A prospective analysis of quality of life was completed at an overnight camp that was exclusively for patients with IBD, which was sponsored by the Crohn's and Colitis Foundation of America. The IMPACT-II questionnaire (Canada and United States) and the State-Trait Anxiety Inventory for Children were administered to the campers at the beginning and at the end of a 1-week camp to assess HRQOL and anxiety. The IMPACT-II questionnaire consists of 35 questions measuring 6 quality-of-life domains (i.e., bowel domain, systemic symptoms, emotional functioning, social functioning, body image, and treatment/interventions). The State-Trait Anxiety Inventory for Children consists of 2 different 20-item sets of questions. One set assesses state anxiety, and the other, trait anxiety. A repeated-measures multivariate analysis of variance was performed to determine the differences between scores attained before and after camp on the IMPACT-II questionnaire and in each of its domains. Paired sample t tests were performed on state and trait anxiety before and after camp. RESULTS: A total of 125 individuals consented to participate, but 61 patients (50 girls and 11 boys; age range, 9 to 16 y) completed the IMPACT-II questionnaire in full. Of those 61 patients, 47 had Crohn's disease and 14 had ulcerative colitis. There was statistically significant improvement between the mean (+/-SD) precamp total score (172.95 +/- 36.61) and the mean postcamp total score (178.71 +/- 40.97; P = 0.035), bowel symptoms scores (P = 0.036), social functioning scores (P = 0.022), and treatment interventions scores (P = 0.012). No difference was found between anxiety scores before and after camp on either the state or trait anxiety inventories (n = 55; P > 0.05). CONCLUSIONS: Overall, HRQOL improved in children after attending IBD summer camp. This exploratory study suggests that contributing factors for these improvements may be an increase in social functioning, a better acceptance of IBD symptoms, and less distress regarding treatment interventions, suggesting that a camp that is specifically designed for children with IBD may normalize the chronic illness experience. However, future research using a multimodal measurement approach is warranted to support these conclusions.},

   abstract = {Intestinal glutamine utilization is integral to mucosal regeneration. We analyzed the systemic and intestinal glutamine status in Crohn's disease (CD) and evaluated the therapeutic effect of glutamine supplementation in an animal model of ileitis. In CD, glutamine concentrations were decreased systemically and in noninflamed and inflamed ileal/colonic mucosa. Mucosal glutaminase activities were depressed in the ileum independent of inflammation but were not different from controls in the colon. In experimental ileitis, oral glutamine feeding prevented macroscopic inflammation, enhanced ileal and colonic glutaminase activities above controls, and normalized the intestinal glutathione redox status. However, glutamine supplementation enhanced myeloperoxidase activity along the gastrointestinal tract and potentiated lipid peroxidation in the colon. In conclusion, glutamine metabolism is impaired in CD. In experimental ileitis, glutamine supplementation prevents inflammatory tissue damage. In the colon, however, which does not use glutamine as its principal energy source, immune enhancement of inflammatory cells by glutamine increases oxidative tissue injury.},

Frequent complications include stricture and fistula. Numerous extra-intestinal manifestations may also be present. The aetiology of Crohn's disease is incompletely understood, and therapy, although generally effective in alleviating the symptoms, is not curative. Due to the heterogeneity of the disease a major need for the therapeutic approach is the ability to define subgroups with distinct characteristics. However, with regard to the heterogeneity of demographic, anatomic and disease behaviour characteristics, distillation of the numerous possible phenotypes in simple categories is a formidable task. In the present review the focus will be on clinically relevant situations providing therapeutic algorithms according to international guidelines.},

   abstract = {BACKGROUND: Interleukin (IL)-15 is overexpressed in intestinal tissue with active Crohn's disease (CD). However, its role in the pathogenesis of the disease remains uncertain. We studied the effects of IL-15 on colonic mucosal proinflammatory cytokine response in vitro using organ culture of human colonic explants. METHODS: Colonic tissue was obtained from (1) resections in pediatric CD patients (inflamed and noninflamed) and (2) rectal biopsies in patients with CD undergoing colonoscopy (n = 31) and controls (n = 9). In preliminary experiments, explants from the resections were cultured in the presence or absence of a simulated T(H)1 stimulation using ionomycin (Io) and phorbol-myristate-acetate (PMA), with or without IL-15, or in medium alone. Rectal biopsies were cultured in the same conditions as above, with or without adding a monoclonal anti-IL-15 neutralizing antibody (mAb). Levels of interferon (IFN)-gamma, tumor necrosis factor (TNF)-alpha, and IL-2R alpha were measured by enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay. RESULTS: IL-15, in the absence of Io + PMA, did not induce the expression of IFN-gamma, TNF-alpha, or IL-2R alpha. Only inflamed explants from resections stimulated with Io + PMA expressed IFN-gamma, TNF-alpha, and IL-2R alpha. This T(H)1 stimulatory effect was inhibited by IL-15 in a dose-dependent fashion. In rectal biopsy explants, inflamed, noninflamed CD, and control tissue responded to stimulation with Io + PMA (P < 0.05) with increased IFN-gamma and TNF-alpha (P < 0.05). This response was again inhibited by IL-15. The inhibitory effect of IL-15 was specifically reversed by anti-IL-15 mAb (P < 0.05). The data for the CD group were also analyzed according to the severity of colonic inflammation and medication use. CONCLUSIONS: Our results suggest a possible anti-inflammatory role for IL-15 in CD. We postulate that its overexpression in CD potentially represents a protective mechanism against the exaggerated T(H)1 immune response.},

   abstract = {GOALS: To evaluate efficacy and safety of endoscopic balloon dilation with or without intralesional steroid injection, of symptomatic upper gastrointestinal (UGI) and lower gastrointestinal (LGI) Crohn's disease (CD) strictures. BACKGROUND: Patients with CD commonly develop obstructive symptoms secondary to gastrointestinal strictures. When these do not resolve with medical management, surgery is usually the only alternative. Limited data are available on the safety and efficacy of endoscopic through-the-scope (TTS) balloon dilation of CD strictures. STUDY: We performed a retrospective review of TTS balloon dilations done on CD-related UGI and LGI strictures. Postdilation intralesional steroid injections were done at the discretion of the endoscopist. Stricture was defined as luminal stenosis <10 mm in diameter, through which a scope could not be passed. Technical success was defined as the ability of the scope to traverse the stricture postdilation. Long-term success rate was claimed if a patient remained asymptomatic and did not require surgery or further endoscopic dilation. RESULTS: Over 4 years, we performed 29 stricture dilations on 17 patients (10 female, 7 male) with 20 strictures. The mean follow-up period was 18.8 months (range, 5-50 months). Stricture locations were as follows: rectal, 5; sigmoid colon, 2; colo-colonic anastomosis, 3; ileocolonic anastomosis, 4; ileum, 1; descending colon, 1; cecum, 1; and distal duodenal bulb, 3 patients. Technical success was achieved in 28 of 29 stricture dilations (96.5%). Ten strictures (34.5%) were dilated to <15 mm and 19 (65.5%) to > or = 15 mm diameter. Long-term success rate in the <15 mm group was 70%, and in > or = 15 mm group was 68.4%. Four quadrant steroid injections were done on 11 strictures. The recurrence rate in this group was 10% and that in the nonsteroid group was 31.3%. The overall long-term success rate was 76.5% by intent-to-treat analysis. Three perforations occurred (all colonic) during 29 stricture dilations, a complication rate of 10% with no mortalities. CONCLUSION: We report the first series of TTS balloon dilations with or without intralesional steroid injection, of both primary and anastomotic UGI and LGI strictures in CD patients. Long-term success was achieved in 76.5% patients with a complication rate of 10%. This mode of therapy appears safe and effective and can be considered as an alternative to surgery in selected patients with medically refractory CD-associated GI strictures. Success rates were better in patients who received four quadrant steroid injections. No difference was seen in stricture recurrence rate or complications based on diameter of TTS balloon used.},

   abstract = {OBJECTIVE: Children with inflammatory bowel disease (IBD) suffer from malabsorption and malnutrition and therefore may be at risk of developing polyunsaturated fatty acid (PUFA) deficiency. The aim of this study was to investigate PUFA status in children with IBD and the possible relationship to disease activity and nutritional status. MATERIAL AND METHODS: We assessed the fatty acid composition of plasma phospholipids (%wt/wt) of 21 children aged 5.5-18 years with IBD (ulcerative colitis, 15; Crohn's disease, 6) with mild or moderate disease activity. The clinical symptoms and biochemical indices of disease activity and nutritional status (lean and fat body mass, Hb, albumin serum conc.) were also determined. RESULTS: The patients had lower phospholipid PUFAs than 13 healthy, aged-matched controls (25.8+/-5.2 versus 34.2+/-5.7, M+/-SD, p<0.001), mainly due to lower values of linoleic acid (18:2n-6, 14.0+/-3.8 versus 18.3+/-4.3, p<0.01) and its major metabolite arachidonic acid (20:4n-6, 5.3+/-2.0 versus 9.3+/-1.9, p<0.0001). There were also higher values of a-linolenic acid (18:3n-3, 0.3+/-0.4 versus 0.2+/-0.1, p<0.01) while the long-chain n-3 PUFA-eicosapentaenoic and docosahexaenoic acids were normal. Total n-6 PUFA correlated inversely to erythrocyte sedimentation rate (p<0.01), seromucoid (p<0.05) and positively to Hb concentration (p<0.01). CONCLUSIONS: Children with inflammatory bowel disease have a high risk of n-6 PUFA depletion, which is related to disease activity.},

   abstract = {The short bowel syndrome is the result of a congenital or acquired loss of a large part of the small intestine. The most frequent causes of surgical resection of the intestine in infants are arterial or venous thrombosis, intestinal volvulus, necrotizing enterocolitis, and Crohn's disease. Symptoms include nutrient and electrolyte malabsorption, steatorrhea and diarrhea, which can result in failure to thrive. The consequences of extensive small bowel resections consist of nutritional deficiencies, gastric acid hypersecretion, nephrolithiasis, cholelithiasis and lactic acidosis. Of these, D-lactic acidosis is an infrequent but important complication because of the symptoms that it can produce. D-lactic acid in the human organism is generated by intestinal bacteria, D-lactate ingestion, or endogenous production in the methyl glycoxylase pathway. Neurological symptoms such as somnolence, ataxia or altered behavior in a patient with short bowel syndrome should make us think of D-lactic acidosis caused by bacterial overgrowth. We present the case of an 11-year-old boy with short bowel syndrome secondary to multiple resections during the postnatal period who was admitted to hospital for episodes of confusion and altered behavior. The diagnosis was lactic acidosis. Outcome was favorable due to prompt instauration of treatment.},

   abstract = {OBJECTIVES: Evaluate the nutritional status of patients with inactive or mildly active Crohn's disease (CD), and identify possible causes for potential deficiencies. METHODS: A total of 78 CD patients and 80 healthy controls were evaluated in respect of nutritional status, dietary intake, and life styles factors. RESULTS: These 73/78 CD patients were on immunomodulating therapies. Mean body mass index (BMI) was lower in patients as compared to controls (P= 0.006) but 32% of CD patients and 33.8% of controls had a BMI > 25, whereas 8% and 23.8% in each group, respectively, were obese (BMI > 30Kg/m(2)). Fat free mass was significantly decreased in both genders (P < 0.05) whereas fat mass was decreased only in males (P= 0.01). Energy intake was significantly lower in CD patients (P < 0.0001) and we observed significantly lower adjusted mean daily intakes of carbohydrates, monounsaturated fat, fiber, calcium, and vitamins C, D, E, and K (P < 0.05). 29% of patients had excluded grains from their usual diet, 28% milk, 18% vegetables, and 11% fruits. Milk exclusion resulted in a significantly lower consumption of calcium and vitamin K (P < 0.001) and the exclusion of vegetables was associated to a lower consumption of vitamins C and E (P < 0.05). Physical activity was significantly lower in CD patients (P= 0.01) and this lack of physical activity was inversely correlated with increased fat mass percentage (r=-0.315, P= 0.001). CONCLUSIONS: Results showed that the most prevalent form of malnutrition in CD patients was an excess of body weight, which was concomitant with an inadequate dietary intake, namely micronutrients, clearly related to dietary exclusion of certain foods.},

The aim of this study was to identify foods causing intolerance and to determine the nature and severity of reported symptoms. Patients from the Dutch Crohn's and Ulcerative Colitis Association were mailed a survey on food intolerance; 105 (31% men) of 137 patients took part. They all reported intolerance to one or more foods. Common symptoms (scored from 0=absent to 10=severe), included diarrhea (mean score=5.8), fatigue (mean score=5.5), and thirst (mean score=4.6). Spicy foods, cabbage, and citrus fruits (or juice) were most likely to decrease stool consistency, increase stool frequency, or cause perianal irritation. Onions, cabbage, or leeks were reported by 28% of the patients to cause flatulence. The urge to defecate was stronger after a cooked meal (45% within (1/2) hour) than after sandwiches (15% within (1/2) hour). Foods reported to increase stool consistency were potato products, bread, and bananas. This study demonstrates that food intolerance is a common, albeit mild, problem after ileal pouch-anal anastomosis. Food and nutrition professionals should encourage patients to base their food choices on individual tolerance as long as no (patho-) physiological-based evidence to the contrary is available.},

   abstract = {OBJECTIVES: Our pilot study aimed to determine the effect of tumor necrosis factor-alpha (TNF-alpha) 308 G-->A promoter single-nucleotide polymorphism in pediatric inflammatory bowel disease (IBD), its influence on inflammatory activity and the clinical manifestations. METHODS: We obtained genomic DNA from 164 subjects, 82 with long-standing IBD aged 8 to 18 years: 46 with Crohn disease (CD) and 36 with ulcerative colitis (UC). Eighty-two healthy children served as the control population. Genotyping was determined by using a restriction enzyme-based assay. TNF-alpha 308 G-->A polymorphism was assessed in terms of inflammatory (C-reactive protein [CRP]) and disease activity. The latter was assessed by the Pediatric Crohn's Disease Activity Index (PCDAI) and the Truelove index for CD and UC, respectively. RESULTS: Significant differences in TNF-alpha 308 A polymorphism were found between the IBD group and controls (P < 0.05) and the UC group and controls (P < 0.001). No differences were noted between TNF-alpha 308 A polymorphism and clinical characteristics in UC. The frequency of the -308 A allele of TNF was not different in CD compared with that in the control group. The frequency of TNF-alpha 308 A genotype was significantly higher in CD patients with predominantly stenosing/penetrating disease compared with patients without complications (P < 0.001) and healthy controls (P < 0.01). In CD patients, those carrying TNF -308 A had a significant increase in CRP (P < 0.05) and the PCDAI (P < 0.05). In CD, CRP levels strongly correlated with the PCDAI (r = 0.6150, P < 0.001). In UC, significant differences among the mean levels of CRP (P < 0.05) and disease activity (P < 0.001) related to TNF-alpha 308 A polymorphism were found. Allele distribution (odds ratio, 12.9; CI, 1.18-140.81, P < 0.001) and CRP serum levels (odds ratio, 1.020; CI, 1.00-1.04, P < 0.001) were independently associated with CD complications. CONCLUSIONS: Although not necessarily dictating IBD initiation, the TNF-alpha 308 A polymorphism may play a role in modifying the CD phenotype. The polymorphism may influence disease activity as well as more intense inflammatory activity in both forms of IBD and may modify the progression of chronic digestive tract inflammation.},

AIM: To evaluate the effectiveness of home enteral nutrition as a maintenance therapy regimen in which half of the daily calorie requirement is provided by an elemental diet and the remaining half by a free diet. We refer to this home enteral nutrition therapy as 'half elemental diet'. METHODS: Between 2002 and 2005, 51 patients in remission from two hospitals were randomly assigned to a half elemental diet group (n = 26) or a free diet group (n = 25). The primary outcome measure of this study was the occurrence of relapse over the 2-year period. RESULTS: The relapse rate in the half elemental diet group was significantly lower [34.6% vs. 64.0%; multivariate hazard ratio 0.40 (95% CI: 0.16-0.98)] than that in the free diet group after a mean follow-up of 11.9 months. Compliance was similar in the two groups. No adverse event occurred in any of the patients throughout the study. CONCLUSION: This randomized-controlled trial shows the effectiveness of an half elemental diet, which is a promising maintenance therapy for Crohn's disease patients.},

Reports of successful pregnancy and delivery, which are important determinants of quality of life for female CD patients with stoma, are limited. Thus, we investigated problems associated with pregnancy and delivery in female CD patients at our hospital. MATERIALS AND METHODS: Between 1985 and 2003, five female CD patients with enterostoma carried seven pregnancies and delivered eight babies in our hospital. For this study, we investigated CD activity, fetal growth, stoma complications, and the outcome of delivery in these seven pregnancies. RESULTS: Among the five patients, four underwent loop ileostomy and one loop sigmoidostomy for treatment of RVF or severe stricture of the rectum or sigmoid colon. Except for one case, no fertility treatment was done. During pregnancy, a flare-up was observed in one patient and was successfully treated with corticosteroids. Although home enteral or parenteral nutrition was required in two cases, fetal growth was within the normal range in all pregnancies. Preterm delivery occurred in one case with a twin pregnancy. The mean diameter of stoma increased during pregnancy (p<0.01), and a mucosal laceration of stoma by the edge of an ostomy appliance occurred in one case. All deliveries were safe, with six cesarean sections and one transvaginal delivery. After each delivery, the stoma returned to pre-pregnancy size. CONCLUSIONS: Pregnancy and delivery in CD patients with stoma is safe and should be encouraged. However, special attention to disease activity, nutritional support, and stoma-related complications is recommended.},

MATERIAL AND METHODS: Retrospective analysis of patients operated upon for Crohn's Disease between 1979 and 1997. Risk factors for operative morbidity were searched, and actuarial curves for recurrence of disease were constructed. RESULTS: There were 34 patients with a mean age of 46 years. All patients were operated upon because of complications; the most frequent ones were stenosis and obstruction. The affected patterns were ileocecal in 53%, colitis in 35% and small bowel in 12%. Segmental resections were the most frequent ones, mainly ileo-cecal. Operative morbidity was 32% and mortality 6%. The presence of colonic affection and the necessity of its resection was a higher risk for complications (P< 0.05). Actuarial recurrence was 39% at 107 months. CONCLUSIONS: Surgery for Crohn's disease was mainly indicated in complications, presented high rates of morbidity associated with colonic involvement and resections, and there were high rates of recurrence at long-term.},

Thus, one of the increasingly accepted htypotheses to explain the origin of this disease, is the oxidative stress that occurs in the intestinal mucosa. Dietary factors including self administered vitamin and mineral supplements may play a role, especially when they contain excessive amounts of iron and copper, known for their prooxidant capacities. Unfortunately, little is known about how these metals may influence the antioxidant defenses in the intestinal mucosa. This article reviews the literature on the why and how these elements may act on individuals susceptible to develop Crohn disease, including the evidence supporting the hypothesis that oxidative stress in the intestinal mucosa is an important pathogenetic factor.},

Our aim was to evaluate the outcome and predictive factors for this complication in SBS patients. Ten patients (37-61 years) underwent reversed segment (n = 9) or nipple valve creation (n = 1). All patients had remnant lengths over 90 cm and rapid intestinal transit times. All subjects had benign diseases, including Crohn's (n = 3). Six patients had a colon remnant. SBS had been present for 8 to 150 months. Nine (90%) required parental nutrition (PN) preoperatively. A procedure was performed either alone (n = 5) or concurrently with an ostomy closure (n = 3), an ostomy revision (n = 1), or a fundoplication (n = 1). There was one postoperative complication (urinary tract infection) and no deaths. Two patients developed bacterial overgrowth. One required repair of an ileocolonic stricture. One reversed segment was taken down 12 months later. Five (50%) patients improved (off PN), five remained on PN or had persistent diarrhea. Patients with a successful outcome were more likely to have had ostomy takedown (60% vs 0%). The duration of SBS; presence of Crohn's disease, a colon remnant, or type 1 anatomy; and the transit times were similar in both groups. Adjusted remnant length (small intestine +30 cm for type 2 anatomy and +60 cm for type 3) was similar (136 +/- 20 vs 154 +/- 25 cm). Procedures may benefit half of selected SBS patients with adequate remnant length and rapid transit. Successful patients are more likely to have an ostomy takedown, but the outcome is less determined by transit time or intestinal length if over 90 cm.},

The responses of circulating immune cells and extra-intestinal manifestations to increased inflammatory activity and to modulation by dietary supplementation are uncertain. The relationships between disease status, bone turnover and body mass and composition, PBMC function and fatty acid availability have been investigated in patients with Crohn's disease. The availability of n-3 and n-6 PUFA is altered in adult patients and interferon (IFN)-gamma production by PBMC is lower. Increased inflammatory activity is associated with increased bone resorption in adult patients and decreased body mass in paediatric patients. In healthy male subjects there is a proportionate relationship between supplementary intake of EPA and DHA (0.3-2.0 g as fish oil/d) in combination with antioxidants (vitamins A, C and E and Se) and incorporation into plasma phospholipids and PBMC, and a non-linear relationship with PBMC synthesis of TNF-alpha, IL-6 and prostaglandin E2 (decrease) and IFN-gamma (increase). In adults with Crohn's disease high-dose fish oil (2.7 g EPA+DHA/d) in combination with antioxidants (vitamins A, C and E and Se) increases the EPA and DHA content of PBMC and decreases the production of IFN-gamma by PBMC, but is not associated with effects on bone turnover or nutritional status.},

   abstract = {Crohn's disease is associated with altered bone turnover that may be influenced by nutritional status, the systemic inflammatory response, cytokine production by circulating (peripheral blood) mononuclear cells (PBMC) and antioxidant micronutrient intake. High-dose fish oil is associated with reductions in disease relapse and inflammatory markers, and modulates PBMC function. The effect of fish oil plus antioxidants on bone turnover and PBMC function (the production of interferon-gamma and prostaglandin E2) in Crohn's disease was investigated in a randomised-controlled trial. Patients with currently or recently raised biochemical markers of inflammation (C-reactive protein > or = 6.9 mg/l or erythrocyte sedimentation rate > or =18 mm/h) received fish oil (providing 2.7 g/d EPA and DHA) and antioxidants (vitamins A, C and E, and Se) (n 31) or placebo (n 30) for 24 weeks. Bone turnover was assessed by measuring the concentrations of urinary deoxypyridinoline (bone resorption) and serum osteocalcin (bone formation). Fish oil plus antioxidants were associated with increases in EPA, DHA Se in plasma (all P < 0.01), and with a reduction in interferon-gamma production by mitogen-stimulated PBMC, which demonstrated a negative correlation with deoxypyridinoline/creatinine:osteocalcin ratio (r - 0.33, P = 0.009). There were no differences between the groups at 24 weeks in the response of deoxypyridinoline or osteocalcin or their ratio, or in nutritional status. Dietary supplementation in Crohn's disease with high intakes of EPA and DHA, as fish oil, plus antioxidants was associated with a modulated production of interferon-gamma by PBMC but not altered indices of bone turnover.},

   abstract = {BACKGROUND: Immunosuppressors play a major role in maintaining remission in Crohn's disease (CD). In patients who do not tolerate or escape therapy with azathioprine (AZA)/6-mercaptopurine, there is a marked need for other immunosuppressive drugs. The aim of the present study was to evaluate the efficacy and safety of methotrexate (MTX) in children with active CD. METHODS: In a retrospective multicenter (n = 3) study, the efficacy of MTX to induce complete remission or a clinical improvement was analyzed in 61 children with active CD. RESULTS: CD was diagnosed at a mean age of 11.1 +/- 2.3 years, and MTX was introduced 3.1 +/- 2.2 years after diagnosis. Indications to use MTX were a nonresponse to or relapse under AZA (n = 42) or AZA intolerance/toxicity (n = 19). MTX improved or induced complete remission in 49 patients (80%), of whom 18 (29.5%) relapsed after 13 +/- 10 months of treatment. Under MTX medication, complete remission was observed in 39%, 49%, and 45% at 3, 6, and 12 months, respectively. Follow-up over at least 24 months in 11 children confirmed a sustained remission on MTX monotherapy up to 40 months. Adverse reactions were observed in 14 patients (24%), requiring discontinuation of MTX in 6 children (10%) (liver enzyme elevation, n = 2; varicella-zoster, n = 1; nausea, n = 3). MTX allowed corticosteroid discontinuation in 36 patients. CONCLUSIONS: MTX improved the clinical course in most pediatric CD patients who escaped or did not tolerate AZA. Short-time toxicity of MTX resulted in drug discontinuation in <10%. These data point to a beneficial and safe use of MTX in the treatment of pediatric CD.},

   abstract = {Inflammatory bowel disease (IBD) predominantly affects the gastrointestinal system but it is associated with a large number of extraintestinal manifestations (EIM). These extraintestinal disorders can significantly contribute to morbidity and impair the overall life quality. EIM may be diagnosed before, concurrently with, or after the diagnosis of IBD is made. The precise etiology of EIM remains unknown. It currently is believed that mucosa from the underlying bowel disease may provide associated immune responses for the inflammatory process in the extraintestinal sites. The involvement of autoimmune mechanisms has been suggested when the shared and unique epitopes in the human colon, eye, joint and biliary epithelium were detected. Recently, the presence of long-lived populations of memory lymphocytes has been discovered which arise as a consequence of bowel inflammation and express homing receptors that direct their migration not only to the gut but also to the extraintestinal sites. The most common extraintestinal disorders associated with IBD include dermatologic, ophthalmologic, musculoskeletal and hepatobiliary diseases, although virtually every organ system may be involved. If these disorders can be considered as the real extraintestinal manifestations of IBD or represent just association between different syndromes of autoimmune etiology, is still not clear. It is important to acquire knowledge on these extraintestinal manifestations of Crohn's disease and ulcerative colitis to start the respective treatment early.},

   abstract = {OBJECTIVE: Undernutrition has been reported in 65-75% of patients with Crohn's disease. The present study aimed at identifying the relative contribution of malnutrition-causing factors in patients with Crohn's disease in remission. METHODS: Sixteen patients with Crohn's disease (age 19-57 y) in remission (Crohn's Activity Disease Index < 150) were included in the study. Their weight was stable for >3 mo and they were off steroids. They all completed 3-d food records and concomitantly collected stools. Self-reported food records were analyzed and energy content in stools was determined by a direct bomb calorimeter. Resting energy expenditure (REE) was studied by indirect calorimetry and body composition by dual-energy X-ray absorptiometry. The study cohort was divided into two groups, with a body mass index (BMI) equal to 18.5 kg/m(2) serving as a cutoff point. RESULTS: Subjects with lower BMIs tended to have less lean body mass (P = 0.006), less bone mineral density (P = 0.006), and lower REE (P = 0.003). No correlation was found between BMI and energy intake but the percentage of malabsorption was negatively correlated with BMI (P = 0.07). When dividing the study based on a BMI of 18.5 kg/m(2), no difference was found in caloric intake or REE between groups but subjects with lower BMIs had significant prominent malabsorption compared with the others (21.1 +/- 9.8% versus 11.7 +/- 3.5%, P = 0.015). CONCLUSION: In the presence of similar energy intake, REE does not seem to contribute to lower BMI, although nutrient malabsorption is higher in malnourished patients with Crohn's disease in remission. We suggest that malabsorption be evaluated in patients with Crohn's disease who fail to gain weight during disease remission to establish their extra caloric requirements.},

   abstract = {One of the most common beliefs in the management of Crohn's disease is that surgery should be considered only as a last resort. Surgery is often considered by patients and gastroenterologists to represent a "failure." However, the role of surgery in the care of patients with Crohn's disease has increasingly become a collaborative effort, with surgeons involved in many aspects of the management of these patients. This is particularly true in pediatric patients, as issues of growth and development may involve surgical intervention at earlier stages than might be required in older patients. In fact, surgical interventions may be indicated at any stage of the disease process. For example, early examination under anesthesia with abscess drainage and delineation of fistula tracts has proven very useful in patients with complex perineal disease. Surgery may contribute to the medical management of the disease by way of providing chronic enteral or parenteral access for nutritional interventions such as elemental feedings and total parenteral nutrition. Finally, surgical treatment of intra-abdominal complications including fistulas, phlegmon, and bowel strictures may have a dramatic impact on patient symptoms and side effects. Although bowel resection carries the long-term risk of short bowel syndrome should future resections be required, the improvements in medical therapy continue to reduce the risk of recurrent disease, making surgical resection more palatable. Surgical treatment of complicated disease offers significant potential to limit toxic medical therapy and improve quality of life. In addition, application of minimally invasive techniques can minimize the impact of insults to body image in this vulnerable patient population as well as speed recovery. Future interventions may be facilitated by reducing adhesion formation through the use of minimally invasive techniques. The dynamic nature of growth and development in the pediatric population presents unique complications from medical therapies that are different from those seen in adults. Criteria for surgical intervention must be interpreted in light of the specific challenges facing the pediatric population as frequently pointed out in the oft-quoted maxim, "children are not small adults!"},

   abstract = {BACKGROUND: Children and adolescents suffering from inflammatory bowel disease (IBD) are at risk of developing osteoporosis as a result of treatment with corticosteroids as well as of nonsteroidal factors like inflammation and malnutrition. To study the impact of these factors on development of osteopathy, we compared the rate of osteoporosis in steroid-naive and steroid-treated pediatric IBD patients. METHODS: In 90 patients (50 girls) with IBD (34 steroid-naive, 53 steroid-treated, 3 not known) aged 8.8 to 19.2 (14.4 +/- 2.2) years and 52 controls (27 girls) aged 6.1 to 17.6 (12.9 +/- 3.0) years, bone mineral density (BMD) of the lumbar spine was assessed with dual energy x-ray absorptiometry. Areal BMD values were transformed into volumetric densities called bone mineral apparent density (BMAD) and expressed as standard deviation scores (SDS) on the basis of the BMAD values of the controls. RESULTS: The rate of osteoporotic patients (BMAD-SDS < -2) was 8% in girls and 20% in boys. There was a similar proportion of osteoporosis in steroid-naive (12%) and steroid-treated (11%) patients. SDS of body height showed a significant positive correlation with BMD-SDS but not with BMAD-SDS in almost all patient subgroups, indicating an interfering dependency of BMD from bone size. CONCLUSIONS: The prevalence of osteoporosis in pediatric patients with IBD is approximately the same as in adult patients. Osteoporosis is already present before steroid treatment. Data of dual energy x-ray absorptiometry measurements should be transformed into volumetric parameters to compensate for short stature. Otherwise, a lot of growth-stunted patients may be falsely diagnosed as osteopenic.},

   abstract = {AIM: The aim was to evaluate the pattern of responsiveness and to monitor side effects of episodic administration of infliximab in children with active Crohn's disease (CD) treated in Denmark from 1999 to 2003. MATERIAL AND METHODS: The National Danish Crohn Colitis Database of infliximab was used to identify all Danish CD patients treated at pediatric departments with infliximab. The clinical outcome was assessed by pattern recognition of the disease course 30 days after the first infliximab infusion and 90 days after intended end of treatment. RESULTS: During a 3 year period, infliximab was given to 24 CD patients (9 male/15 female) aged median 15.4 (range 9.8-18.6) years with a median disease duration of 26 (range 0.7-93) months and a median number of infusions of 6 (range 2-11). Five milligrams of infliximab per kilogram infusions were given intravenously. Immediate response was as follows: 8 (33%) patients achieved complete response (CR), 10 (42%) partial response (PR), and 6 (25%) no response (NR). Long-term response was as follows: 7 (29%) patients achieved prolonged response (PRO), defined as maintenance of CR or PR, 10 (42%) were infliximab dependent (ID), defined as relapse of symptoms requiring reinfusions of infliximab to regain CR or PR, and 6 (25%) had NR. Six (25%) patients needed surgery during or after treatment with infliximab. Side effects were seen in four (17%) patients. No serious events were noted. CONCLUSION: Seventy-one percent of the children appeared to benefit (PRO or ID) from infliximab treatment with minor side effects when given episodically. Among these patients, two response patterns were recognized: PRO after ending infliximab treatment (29%) or dependency on reinfusions of infliximab (42%).},

Although both patients followed a high-calorie diet combining solid foods and enteral nutrition by nasogastric tube, containing 16,000 kJ and 21,000 kJ, respectively, weight loss continued. Faecal fat excretion and basal metabolic rate were determined, but these could not explain the caloric deficit. Therefore, faecal bomb calorimetry, a measurement of total faecal energy content, was also performed, revealing a considerably higher faecal energy loss than had been calculated from faecal fat excretion; this indicates that faecal carbohydrate loss plays an important supplementary role. A stable weightwas achieved in both patients by prescribing extra food. Therefore, faecal fat excretion is an insufficient indicator of total faecal calorie loss in patients with high-output stomata and short-bowel syndrome. Bomb calorimetry may be considered as a tool to determine the remaining absorptive capacity in short-bowel patients.},

METHODS: Twenty-eight consecutive patients with active CD were treated with an elemental diet (Elental) for 4 weeks. The mucosal biopsies were obtained from the terminal ileum and large bowel before and after treatment. As a control group, mucosal biopsies were obtained from 20 patients without inflammation. Mucosal cytokine concentrations were measured by enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay. RESULTS: After treatment, clinical remission was achieved in 20 patients (71%). Endoscopic healing and improvement rates were 44% and 76% in the terminal ileum and 39% and 78% in the large bowel, respectively. Histologic healing and improvement rates were 19% and 54% in the terminal ileum and 20% and 55% in the large bowel, respectively. Before treatment, the mucosal concentrations of interleukin (IL)-1beta, IL-1 receptor antagonist (IL-1ra), IL-6, IL-8, and tumor necrosis factor-alpha in the ileum and large bowel were significantly higher than in controls. These cytokine concentrations decreased to the levels of control after treatment. IL-1ra/IL-1beta ratio in the ileum and large bowel was significantly lower than in controls before treatment. The ratio increased to the level of controls after treatment. The endoscopic and histologic healing of the mucosal inflammation was associated with a decline of the mucosal cytokines and an increase of the IL-1ra/IL-1beta ratio. CONCLUSIONS: The elemental diet (Elental) reduced mucosal cytokine production and corrected an imbalance between proinflammatory and anti-inflammatory cytokines in CD.},

   abstract = {AIM: To evaluate the effect of perioperative parenteral nutrition on serum immunoglobulin, weight change, and post-operative outcome in severely malnourished patients with Crohn's disease. METHODS: Thirty-two severely malnourished patients with Crohn's disease who had undergone surgery in our hospital were reviewed. Sixteen patients who received perioperative parenteral nutrition were enrolled in the study group, and the other 16 patients who did not receive parenteral nutrition were enrolled in the control group. Serum immunoglobulin, body mass index (BMI), liver function, weight change, and postoperative complications were evaluated. RESULTS: Serum IgM levels elevated 1 wk before surgery in both groups, and decreased to normal value (from 139+/-41 to 105+/-29 mg/dL, P = 0.04) 4 wk after operation in the study group, while no significant changes was noted in the control group (from 133+/-16 to 129+/-13 mg/dL, P = 0.34). There were no significant changes in concentrations of IgG and IgA. The BMI of the study group increased from 13.9+/-0.6 to 15.3+/-0.7 kg/m(2) (P = 0.02) with no significant change in the control group (14.1+/-0.7 and 14.5+/-0.5, respectively, P = 0.81). The percentage of resuming work was higher in the study group than in the control group. CONCLUSION: Perioperative parenteral nutrition possibly ameliorates the humoral immunity, reverses malnutrition, and facilitates rehabilitation.},

   abstract = {Inflammatory bowel disease (IBD), including Crohn's disease (CD) and ulcerative colitis (UC), is reported to be increasing in incidence and prevalence in provinces and cities in mainland China. This article specifically reviews clinical features, extra-intestinal manifestations, complications, diagnosis and differential diagnosis, and medical treatment of UC. Compared to patients in Western countries, more mild to moderate and left-sided colitis cases were observed in a nation-wide study in China. Complications included anal fistula, anal abscess, anal fissure, severe bleeding, intestinal perforation, intestinal obstruction and colonic carcinoma. The extra-intestinal manifestations were arthritis/arthralgia, eye and skin disorders and oral ulcers. The high specificity of antineutrophil cytoplasmic antibody may useful for distinguishing UC from infectious colitis; in addition, serum levels of anti-saccharomyces cerevisiae antibody may be helpful for distinguishing between UC and CD. Oral sulfasalazine and 5-aminosalicylic acid (ASA) remain the mainstays for the management of mild to moderate UC in China. Corticosteroids and immunosuppressive agents are also widely used in severe or refractory UC.},

   abstract = {BACKGROUND: Crohn's disease appears to be increasing in frequency in many areas of the world. However, little information with regard to disease incidence, prevalence and temporal trends has been published in China. OBJECTIVE: The aim of this review is to better understand the occurrence of Crohn's disease in mainland China, and to give an overview of the current status of the disease. METHODS: We used a computer-based literature search using 50-years of records from the Chinese Database of Biology and Medicine (CBM, 1979-2002), combined with a manual year-by-year search of the literature from 1950 to 1979. Each article was double-reviewed, and all descriptive epidemiological data were recorded, pooled and statistically analyzed. RESULTS: In total, 1526 cases of Crohn's disease since 1950 have been reported by more than 50 hospitals from 22 provinces and cities in mainland China, comprising 884 male and 642 female patients, with a 1.38:1 male predominance. More than 70% of patients were aged 20 to 50 years old, with a mean age of 37.2 +/- 2.68 (ranging from 1 to 83) years. The extrapolated disease incidence and prevalence rates are 0.28/100,000 person years and 1.38/100,000 persons, respectively. CONCLUSIONS: The incidence and prevalence rates of Crohn's disease are still lower than those in Western and other Asian countries, but these rates have been increasing rapidly, and the disease is no longer uncommon. An underestimation may occur because the patients who were misdiagnosed or did not seek medical advice could not be included in the study. A future population-based survey is warranted.},

   abstract = {BACKGROUND: Osteopontin (OPN), a secreted glycoprotein that promotes TH1 immune responses, is involved in several inflammatory conditions. Recently, OPN plasma levels have been demonstrated to be elevated in patients with Crohn's disease. From this evidence, we investigated in the present study whether OPN deficiency protects mice against dextran sodium sulfate (DSS)-induced colitis. MATERIALS AND METHODS: Colitis was induced in OPN -/- mice and matched wild-type Black Swiss control mice by adding 3.5% DSS to their drinking water. Disease progression was evaluated for 10 days by measuring body weight, stool consistency, rectal bleeding, colon lengths, histology, and immunohistochemistry. Levels of the acute-phase protein serum amyloid A, O PN, the proinflammatory cytokines interleukin (IL)-6 and IL-12, and the anti-inflammatory cytokine IL-10 were measured in the serum and, in the case of IL-10 and IL-12, in supernatants from colonic explants at the end of treatment. RESULTS: After DSS treatment, OPN -/- mice exhibited significantly decreased disease activity compared with wild-type mice, as evidenced by reduced rectal bleeding, weight loss, and histological intestinal injury (P < 0.002). Furthermore, serum levels of serum amyloid A and IL-6 increased to a lesser extent (P < 0.001), which also was the case for the release of IL-12 by colonic explants (P < 0.01). The release of IL-10 by colonic explants, however, was increased (P < 0.01). Serum levels of IL-10 and IL-12 were not affected by DSS treatment in both wild-type and OPN-/- mice. Macrophage infiltration into inflamed colonic tissue also was markedly attenuated in DSS-treated OPN -/- mice compared with wild-type mice. CONCLUSIONS: This study shows that OPN deficiency significantly protected mice from colitis by attenuating the TH1 response and macrophage chemotaxis. OPN may represent a novel attractive target for pharmacological treatment of inflammatory bowel disease.},

   abstract = {OBJECTIVE: To evaluate nutritional status and dietary habits of Lithuanian patients with ulcerative colitis and Crohn's disease and to compare with those of healthy controls. MATERIALS AND METHODS: A case-control study was conducted in the Department of Gastroenterology, Kaunas University of Medicine Hospital. A total of 101 patients with ulcerative colitis, 44 with Crohn's disease, and 178 healthy controls were examined with the help of standard self-report questionnaire about daily dietary habits. Healthy controls were evaluated in primary care centers during preventive examinations. Body mass index was calculated for all patients in a standard way. RESULTS: There was no statistically significant difference between patients and controls concerning consumption of coffee, tea, chewing gum, type of fat for meal preparation, white bread, cooked potatoes and sausages, non-carbonated water. Patients with inflammatory bowel diseases statistically significantly less frequently consumed fresh milk, cheese, fish, fried potatoes, and soda drinks. Patients with Crohn's disease statistically significantly less frequently consumed fresh fruits and patients with ulcerative colitis--fresh vegetables as compared to controls. Body mass index of patients with inflammatory bowel diseases was significantly lower compared to controls, and patients with Crohn's disease had significantly lower body mass index than ulcerative colitis patients. CONCLUSIONS: Patients with inflammatory bowel diseases have lower body mass index than healthy controls. Patients consume fresh milk, cheese, canned and fresh vegetables and fruits less frequently; therefore, primary care physicians and patients should be provided with teaching and more information about nutrition issues.},
