   abstract = {Because celiac disease is greatly under-diagnosed in the United States, a common assumption is that U.S. doctors and researchers always have considered the condition extremely rare. However, the disorder captured widespread medical attention at the beginning of the twentieth century. Luther Emmett Holt, a leading pediatrician, encouraged three other doctors to investigate the condition. Two helped to associate celiac disease with elite medical institutions. The third linked it to the marketing efforts of the United Fruit Company. Interest in celiac declined after 1965, partly as a result of the decreased concern with nutrition and nutritional disorders.},

Despite the fact that these cells are constantly confronted with antigen primarily in the form of food and bacteria, immune responses in the gut are tightly regulated to maintain homeostasis. Without this balance of active immunity and tolerance, mucosal inflammation may ensue, and manifest as Crohn's disease, ulcerative colitis, pernicious anemia, or celiac sprue. Therefore, it is not unreasonable that inflammatory diseases of the gut are commonly encountered in patients with primary immune deficiencies. The exact pathogenesis of gastrointestinal diseases in the setting of primary immunodeficiency remains unknown, however, both humoral and cell-mediated immunity appear to play a role in preventing intestinal inflammation. Patients presenting with atypical gastrointestinal disease and/or failure to respond to conventional therapy should be evaluated for an underlying primary immune disorder in order to initiate appropriate treatment, such as immunoglobulin or in more severe cases bone marrow transplantation, to prevent long term complications.},

The gluten-free products currently available in the market are considered of low quality and poor nutritional value. In the present study, the pseudocereals amaranth, quinoa and buckwheat were studied as potential healthy ingredients for improving the nutritional quality of gluten-free breads. The pseudocereal seeds and pseudocereal-containing gluten-free breads were evaluated in terms of their protein, fat, total starch, dietary fibre, ash and mineral content as well as their fatty acid composition. The pseudocereal containing gluten-free breads showed significantly higher levels of protein, fat, fibre and minerals than the control bread. The attributes of these breads conform to the expert's nutritional recommendations for the gluten-free diet and gluten-free foods. These results suggest that the pseudocereals amaranth, quinoa and buckwheat can represent a healthy alternative to frequently used ingredients in gluten-free products.},

   abstract = {The inappropriate immune response to foods, such as peanut, wheat and milk may be the basis in the pathogenesis of enteropathies like coeliac and Crohn disease, which present small intestinal malabsorption. A number of recent studies have utilized d-xylose absorption as an investigative tool to study small intestinal function in a variety of clinical settings. Thus, the aim of this experimental study was to evaluate the intestinal absorption of D-xylose in an antigen-specific gut inflammatory reaction rat model. Animals of the experimental group were inoculated with peanut protein extract before their exposure to a challenge diet containing exclusively peanut seeds to induce the gut inflammatory reaction caused by peanut allergy. Our results show that systemic inoculation with peanut protein extract renders significantly higher antibody titres (5.085 +/- 0.126 units) (P < 0.0001) than control rats (0.905 +/- 0.053 units) and that the antibody titres correlate positively to an inflammatory alteration of the gut morphology (P < 0.0001). Animals pertaining to the experimental group showed an intestinal absorption of D-xylose lower than control rats (P < 0.0001). We also observed that D-xylose absorption correlates negatively with IgG titres and positively with morphometric parameters (Pearson correlation). In conclusion, the use of serum D-xylose test was useful to identify the presence of small intestinal malabsorption in our antigen specific gut inflammatory reaction rat model.},

To further characterise intestinal immune activation in these children, we have quantitated cytotoxic lymphocytes in intestinal mucosa. METHODS: We studied 23 children with JIA suffering from gastrointestinal symptoms with gastroduodenoscopy and colonoscopy. The control children (n=20) had GI-symptoms but eventually shown not to have any significant gastrointestinal disease. Granzyme A (GrA) and Granzyme B (GrB) expressing lymphocytes in the epithelium and lamina propria were counted in immunostained sections of ileal and duodenal biopsies. RESULTS: The number of GrB expressing IELs was increased in duodenal mucosa in patients with JIA. In the ileum the number of both GrB and GrA positive IELs was similarly increased. No significant differences in the counts of the lamina propria GrA or GrB expressing cells were observed. Granzyme expression was not associated with the duration or with the severity of the disease, or with medication. CONCLUSIONS: These observations suggest that lymphocyte cytotoxicity is abnormally increased in the intestinal mucosa in JIA. Since a similar pattern of activation has been seen in food allergy and celiac disease, we speculate that some luminal, possibly a nutritional factor may be involved in JIA as well. Further studies are needed to see whether cytotoxic activation plays any role in the pathogenesis of JIA.},

   abstract = {The gastrointestinal mucosa constitutes the largest host-environment interface of the body. It uses both innate and adaptive immune mechanisms to provide protection from the diverse onslaught of foods, microbes, and other ingested products. The innate immune system is genetically encoded and evolutionarily ancient, possesses no memory, and lacks diversity. In contrast, the adaptive immune system is quite diverse, develops memory, and undergoes expansion after stimulation. The gastrointestinal mucosa is charged with the difficult task of mounting protective responses against invading microorganisms while simultaneously maintaining an overall state of nonresponsiveness or tolerance to innocuous substances, such as commensal bacteria and food antigens. Perturbation or malfunction of these complex protective mechanisms results in diseases, such as inflammatory bowel diseases, celiac disease, or eosinophilic gastrointestinal diseases.},

   abstract = {BACKGROUND: Celiac Disease (CD) is both a frequent disease (1:100) and an interesting model of a disease induced by food. It consists in an immunogenic reaction to wheat gluten and glutenins that has been found to arise in a specific genetic background; however, this reaction is still only partially understood. Activation of innate immunity by gliadin peptides is an important component of the early events of the disease. In particular the so-called "toxic" A-gliadin peptide P31-43 induces several pleiotropic effects including Epidermal Growth Factor Receptor (EGFR)-dependent actin remodelling and proliferation in cultured cell lines and in enterocytes from CD patients. These effects are mediated by delayed EGFR degradation and prolonged EGFR activation in endocytic vesicles. In the present study we investigated the effects of gliadin peptides on the trafficking and maturation of endocytic vesicles. METHODS/PRINCIPAL FINDINGS: Both P31-43 and the control P57-68 peptide labelled with fluorochromes were found to enter CaCo-2 cells and interact with the endocytic compartment in pulse and chase, time-lapse, experiments. P31-43 was localised to vesicles carrying early endocytic markers at time points when P57-68-carrying vesicles mature into late endosomes. In time-lapse experiments the trafficking of P31-43-labelled vesicles was delayed, regardless of the cargo they were carrying. Furthermore in celiac enterocytes, from cultured duodenal biopsies, P31-43 trafficking is delayed in early endocytic vesicles. A sequence similarity search revealed that P31-43 is strikingly similar to Hrs, a key molecule regulating endocytic maturation. A-gliadin peptide P31-43 interfered with Hrs correct localisation to early endosomes as revealed by western blot and immunofluorescence microscopy. CONCLUSIONS: P31-43 and P57-68 enter cells by endocytosis. Only P31-43 localises at the endocytic membranes and delays vesicle trafficking by interfering with Hrs-mediated maturation to late endosomes in cells and intestinal biopsies. Consequently, in P31-43-treated cells, Receptor Tyrosine Kinase (RTK) activation is extended. This finding may explain the role played by gliadin peptides in inducing proliferation and other effects in enterocytes from CD biopsies.},

METHODS: This cross-sectional study involved eight patients with type 1 diabetes and celiac disease known for at least 1 year. All patients were given a thorough interrogation specifying the regular monitoring of the two diseases and the quality of the observance of the diabetic dietary and gluten-free diet, as well as an assessment of impact of diabetes. RESULTS: the caloric intake in relation to the recommendations is very insufficient. Taking snack is not respected. There is also the consumption of certain foods containing gluten masked and regular consumption of sucrose by our patients despite a long-term evolution of diabetes (19 +/- 6 years) and celiac disease (11 +/- 7.8 years). Half of patients have degenerative complications of diabetes. CONCLUSION: In light of these results, a frequent evaluation of nutrition education in these patients and a psychological care seems necessary.},

In this research, gluten-free tarhana samples were prepared with buckwheat flour (BWF), rice flour and corn starch. Control tarhana was made of wheat flour. In gluten-free formulations, instead of wheat flour, 40% BWF, 30% rice flour and 30% corn starch in the first formulation and 60% BWF, 20% rice flour and 20% corn starch in the second formulation were handled. BWF substitution at a 60% level increased the ash and fat contents of tarhana samples, but affected the lightness value of the samples negatively. Potassium, magnesium and phosphorus contents of the gluten-free tarhana increased significantly (P <0.05) with increasing amount of BWF in the formulation. Sensory evaluation showed that BWF addition resulted in changes in consistency, taste, sourness and grittiness. Tarhana containing 40% BWF received the highest taste and overall acceptability scores.},

   abstract = {OBJECTIVES: Low bone mineral density (BMD) is common in children and adolescents with celiac disease. Strict gluten-free diet (GFD) improves bone mineralization, even in 1 year. The effect of occasional gluten intake is not known. The aims of this study were to compare BMD and prevalence of low BMD in children and adolescents on strict and not strict GFD. METHODS: We measured BMD in 55 children and adolescents (strict GFD) with negative endomysium antibodies (EMA) in the last 2 years and in 19 (not strict GFD) with positive EMA at the time of the study. Lumbar, left hip and total body BMD were measured by dual-energy X-ray absorptiometry. Four-day weighted dietary protocols were obtained by means of a self-completed questionnaire of total food and beverage intake. Energy and calcium intake were calculated using nutrition data software. EMA, tissue transglutaminase antibodies, serum calcium, phosphate, 25-hydroxy vitamin D, intact parathormone, albumin, urea and creatinine levels were determined in all patients. RESULTS: BMD in patients on strict GFD was significantly higher than in patients on not strict GFD (lumbar p=0.01; total body p=0.005). There were significantly more patients with total body BMD below -1.0 in not strictly compliant group (71% compared to 38%; p=0.03). Calcium intake and vitamin D levels were below recommendations in both groups. CONCLUSION: Children and adolescents on not strict GFD are at increased risk for low BMD. We therefore recommend that BMD should be evaluated in patients with positive EMA. In addition, patients on strict GFD are at risk for low BMD because of low calcium intake or vitamin D deficiency. Therefore, strict GFD with recommended calcium intake and vitamin D supplementation during winter and spring should be encouraged in all children and adolescents with celiac disease.},

   abstract = {OBJECTIVE: A gluten-free camp allows children with celiac disease (CD) to enjoy a camp experience without concern and preoccupation with foods they eat or the stigma of their underlying disease. The objective of this study was to evaluate the impact of gluten-free camp on quality-of-life indicators for children and adolescents with CD. METHODS: Children aged 7 to 17 years with CD were administered a 14-question survey at the beginning and the end of a 7-day gluten-free camp. Surveys used a Likert scale to examine general well-being, emotional outlook, and self-perception for the week before each survey. Differences between the time points were compared. Data were analyzed by paired t test. RESULTS: Of the 104 campers who attended camp, 77 (21 male) completed the survey at both time points. Most (70%) had been on a gluten-free diet (GFD) for <4 years. All seemed to benefit from camp, no longer feeling different from other kids or feeling frustrated with a restricted diet. A more beneficial impact was found for campers who were on a GFD for <4 years. Overall, campers reported an improvement in 11 of 14 questions, statistically significant (P < .05) for 8 of those 11 questions. Improvement was observed in each of the 3 categories of questions: well-being, self-perception, and emotional outlook. CONCLUSIONS: Children who had CD and attended a week-long gluten-free camp demonstrated improvement in well-being, self-perception, and emotional outlook. The positive effects of camp were more apparent among campers who had been on a GFD for <4 years compared with those who had been on a GFD for > or =4 years, suggesting an adaptation to CD with time. A gluten-free camp that provides an environment of unrestricted foods can at least temporarily alleviate stress and anxiety around food and social interactions. Durability of these observations on return to daily life requires additional study.},

A high density of T cell receptor (TCR)gammadelta(+) intraepithelial lymphocytes (IELs) and intestinal IgA anti-tissue transglutaminase 2 (anti-TG2) antibody deposits are suggestive of CD. We analysed the density of TCRgammadelta(+) IELs and the deposition of IgM anti-TG2 antibodies in the jejunal mucosa of IgAD patients with and without CD. Immunohistochemical analyses for the number of CD3+ and TCRgammadelta(+) IELs and double immunofluorescence assay for IgM anti-TG2 antibody deposits were performed in biopsies from 25 children with IgAD (nine untreated CD, seven potential CD and nine without CD). Sixteen immunologically intact children without CD represented the controls. IgAD without CD had a higher number of CD3+ and TCRgammadelta(+) IELs than controls (P < 0.05), but lower than IgAD with CD (P < 0.01). No significant differences were noted between IgAD subjects without CD and those with potential CD. Furthermore, IgAD patients without CD showed a higher TCRgammadelta(+)/CD3+ ratio than the control group (P < 0.05), while the ratio was similar to subjects with CD and potential CD. Intestinal IgM anti-TG2 antibody deposits were present in six of seven of the IgAD patients with untreated CD, one of seven with potential CD and none of those without CD. Most of the patients with IgAD show immune activation in the jejunal mucosa. IgM anti-TG2 antibody deposits are present only in CD. Intestinal IgM anti-TG2 and immunohistochemical markers do not discriminate between IgAD and potential CD with IgAD. Therefore, the serum IgG CD-associated autoantibodies remains very important for the diagnosis of CD in IgAD.},

   abstract = {Two adaptive homeostatic mechanisms normally preserve mucosal integrity: (i) immune exclusion mediated by secretory antibodies to inhibit penetration of potentially dangerous microorganisms and proteins, and (ii) immunosuppression to counteract hypersensitivity against innocuous antigens. The latter mechanism is called 'oral tolerance' when induced via the gut. Similar mechanisms are suppressive against commensal bacteria. Such two-layered anti-inflammatory defense explains why persistent allergy to dietary proteins is not more common, with the exception of gluten intolerance (celiac disease) where abrogation of mucosal homeostasis is overt. Thus, mucosally induced tolerance is generally a robust adaptive mechanism in view of the fact that a ton of food may pass annually through the gut of an adult - regularly giving rise to uptake of intact dietary antigens in the nanogram range after a meal. However, the immunoregulatory network and the epithelial barrier are poorly developed in the neonatal period, which therefore is critical with regard to priming for allergy. Notably, the postnatal development of mucosal immune homeostasis depends on appropriate microbial colonization. In this process, antigen-presenting cells are 'decision makers', linking innate and adaptive immunity. Their microbe-sensing function is influenced by both microbial products and dietary constituents, including vitamin A and lipids such as polyunsaturated n-3 fatty acids.},

   abstract = {PURPOSE OF REVIEW: To review recent findings dealing with the involvement of mucosal immunoglobulin A (IgA) in the gut barrier function and various gastrointestinal diseases. New information will be discussed in the context of previous knowledge in this field. RECENT FINDINGS: The epithelial barrier function seems to be central in many mucosal disorders because it is decisive for host-microbial interactions and penetration of soluble antigens into the lamina propria. Secretory IgA contributes to the barrier function and recent evidence strongly supports the notion that such antibodies are involved in immunological homeostasis. SUMMARY: Inflammatory bowel disease involves a break of tolerance to the commensal microbiota. Aberrations in the mucosal IgA system may, therefore, be part of the inflammatory bowel disease pathogenesis. In gluten-induced enteropathy, however, it has been suggested that a mucosal IgA response may promote the progression of celiac disease and dermatitis herpetiformis by enhancing the uptake of gluten peptides and inhibiting the enzyme activity of tissue transglutaminase. A mucosal IgA response may also promote gastritis by protecting Helicobacter pylori from complement attack. In food allergy, several facets of the epithelial barrier function may show deficiency, including secretory IgA.},

   abstract = {BACKGROUND: Effectiveness of medical therapies in chronic pancreatitis has been described in small studies of selected patients. AIM: To describe frequency and perceived effectiveness of non-analgesic medical therapies in chronic pancreatitis patients evaluated at US referral centres. METHODS: Using data on 516 chronic pancreatitis patients enrolled prospectively in the NAPS2 Study, we evaluated how often medical therapies [pancreatic enzyme replacement therapy (PERT), vitamins/antioxidants (AO), octreotide, coeliac plexus block (CPB)] were utilized and considered useful by physicians. RESULTS: Oral PERT was commonly used (70%), more frequently in the presence of exocrine insufficiency (EI) (88% vs. 61%, P < 0.001) and pain (74% vs. 59%, P < 0.002). On multivariable analyses, predictors of PERT usage were EI (OR 5.14, 95% CI 2.87-9.18), constant (OR 3.42, 95% CI 1.93-6.04) or intermittent pain (OR 1.98, 95% CI 1.14-3.45). Efficacy of PERT was predicted only by EI (OR 2.16, 95% CI 1.36-3.42). AO were tried less often (14%) and were more effective in idiopathic and obstructive vs. alcoholic chronic pancreatitis (25% vs. 4%, P = 0.03). Other therapies were infrequently used (CPB - 5%, octreotide - 7%) with efficacy generally <50%. CONCLUSIONS: Pancreatic enzyme replacement therapy is commonly utilized, but is considered useful in only subsets of chronic pancreatitis patients. Other medical therapies are used infrequently and have limited efficacy.},

Human caseins were not recognized by IgA, whereas IgA reactivity of G2 and G3 was higher to bovine milk caseins. Immunoreactivity of G1 to yogurt caseins was lower and comparable to controls, with no effects due to mTG treatment. However, mTG treatment increased reactivity of G3 to wheat and maize prolamins. IgA immunoreactivity of CD patients to caseins and mTG-treated or not prolamins was age-dependent, which could reflect a differential manifestation of the effects of such proteins on the intestinal barrier.},

   abstract = {The identification of gluten peptides eliciting intestinal T cell responses is crucial for the design of a peptide-based immunotherapy in celiac disease (CD). To date, several gluten peptides have been identified to be active in CD. In the present study, we investigated the recognition profile of gluten immunogenic peptides in adult HLA-DQ2(+) celiac patients. Polyclonal, gliadin-reactive T cell lines were generated from jejunal mucosa and assayed for both proliferation and IFN-gamma production in response to 21 peptides from wheat glutenins and alpha-, gamma-, and omega-gliadins. A magnitude analysis of the IFN-gamma responses was performed to assess the hierarchy of peptide potency. Remarkably, 12 of the 14 patients recognized a different array of peptides. All alpha-gliadin stimulatory peptides mapped the 57-89 N-terminal region, thus confirming the relevance of the known polyepitope 33-mer, although it was recognized by only 50% of the patients. By contrast, gamma-gliadin peptides were collectively recognized by the great majority (11 of 14, 78%) of CD volunteers. A 17-mer variant of 33-mer, QLQPFPQPQLPYPQPQP, containing only one copy of DQ2-alpha-I and DQ2-alpha-II epitopes, was as potent as 33-mer in stimulating intestinal T cell responses. A peptide from omega-gliadin, QPQQPFPQPQQPFPWQP, although structurally related to the alpha-gliadin 17-mer, is a distinct epitope and was active in 5 out of 14 patients. In conclusion, these results showed that there is a substantial heterogeneity in intestinal T cell responses to gluten and highlighted the relevance of gamma- and omega-gliadin peptides for CD pathogenesis. Our findings indicated that alpha-gliadin (57-73), gamma-gliadin (139-153), and omega-gliadin (102-118) are the most active gluten peptides in DQ2(+) celiac patients.},

   abstract = {Reduced bone mineral density (BMD) is frequently found in individuals with untreated celiac disease (CD), possibly due to calcium and vitamin D malabsorption, release of pro-inflammatory cytokines, and misbalanced bone remodeling. A gluten-free diet (GFD) promotes a rapid increase in BMD that leads to complete recovery of bone mineralization in children. Children may attain normal peak bone mass if the diagnosis is made and treatment is given before puberty, thereby preventing osteoporosis in later life. A GFD improves, but rarely normalizes, BMD in patients diagnosed with CD in adulthood. In some cases, nutritional supplementation may be necessary. More information on therapeutic alternatives is needed.},

   abstract = {Celiac disease is a permanent intolerance to the gliadin fraction of wheat gluten and to similar barley and rye proteins that occurs in genetically susceptible subjects. After ingestion, degraded gluten proteins reach the small intestine and trigger an inappropriate T cell-mediated immune response, which can result in intestinal mucosal inflammation and extraintestinal manifestations. To date, no pharmacological treatment is available to gluten-intolerant patients, and a strict, life-long gluten-free diet is the only safe and efficient treatment available. Inevitably, this may produce considerable psychological, emotional, and economic stress. Therefore, the scientific community is very interested in establishing alternative or adjunctive treatments. Attractive and novel forms of therapy include strategies to eliminate detrimental gluten peptides from the celiac diet so that the immunogenic effect of the gluten epitopes can be neutralized, as well as strategies to block the gluten-induced inflammatory response. In the present paper, we review recent developments in the use of enzymes as additives or as processing aids in the food biotechnology industry to detoxify gluten.},

Among adults, other associations exist, notably with pernicious anemia, which is extremely rare in children. We relate the observation of an adolescent with type 1 diabetes mellitus and hypothyroidism, admitted for severe anemia in addition to chronic anemia caused by autoimmune gastritis. Blood cell count showed severe aregenerative anemia with pancytopenia, with signs of non-autoimmune hemolysis. Vitamin B12 levels were low, bone marrow aspiration revealed erythroid hyperplasia, and anti-intrinsic factor antibodies were positive, providing the diagnosis of pernicious anemia. Treatment with intramuscular vitamin B12 produced brisk reticulosis after 6 days, with a subsequent rapid resolution of the anemia. Follow-up of type 1 diabetes mellitus in children requires screening for organ-specific autoimmune diseases; in case of unexplained anemia, autoimmune gastritis must be suggested. It can evolve into pernicious anemia.},

   abstract = {Whether diet may influence autoimmunity has been the subject of many unsolved debates. Interestingly, growing evidence indicates a large overlap between the mechanisms controlling tolerance to dietary antigens and autoimmunity. To discuss these links, we will focus on two model human diseases. The first one is IPEX syndrome due to mutations in the X-linked foxp3 gene. Studies of this disease underscore the role of regulatory FOXP3+ T cells in controlling the reactivity against self antigens and the response to dietary proteins in humans. The second is celiac disease, a complex poly-genic disease where exposure to dietary wheat proteins can trigger an autoimmune-like attack of the intestine frequently associated with the onset of extra-digestive autoimmune disorders. In the later disease, recent work shed light on the mechanisms that drive the intestinal inflammatory response to gluten and suggests impairment of immunoregulatory mechanisms that control intestinal tolerance and autoimmunity. Yet the exact role of gluten in the pathogenesis of extra-intestinal autoimmunity has not been elucidated. Interestingly, recent work indicates that dietary factors, including vitamin A and breast milk feeding, can protect against the development of harmful responses to dietary proteins. It is unclear whether this protection can apply to the prevention of autoimmunity.},

AIM: To study the expression of IgE- and IgA-reactive antigens during wheat seed maturation and in different wheat cultivars. METHODS: Summer wheat was grown in a glasshouse and seeds were harvested at defined maturation stages. Mature seeds were obtained from 13 different defined cultivars. Protein extracts were prepared from different maturation stages and cultivars with a standardized procedure based on seed weight and analysed by IgE and IgA immunoblotting using sera from clinically defined patients suffering from wheat allergy or coeliac disease. RESULTS: With a few exceptions the expression of IgE- and IgA-reactive wheat antigens increased during wheat seed maturation. Wheat cultivars could be identified in which the expression of certain IgE- and IgA-reactive components was strongly reduced or not detectable. CONCLUSIONS: The expression of IgE- and IgA-reactive antigens depends on wheat seed maturation and varies in different wheat cultivars.},

   abstract = {INTRODUCTION: Numerous studies have reported a strong relationship between plasma leptin concentration and percentage of body fat, fat mass, and body mass index (BMI) in obese and non-obese children. The objective of the present study was to assess the usefulness of serum leptin concentration in disclosing prepubertal malnutrition. MATERIAL AND METHOD: Leptin concentrations in serum were determined and anthropometric parameters were measured in 149 children (3-6 and 7-10 years old). The Cole index of nutritional status was calculated. 44 children (I) presented with long-standing malnutrition due to celiac disease or food allergy and 105 children (II) were healthy. RESULTS: Leptin concentrations in both age groups of undernourished boys (median 2.7 and 2.7 microg/L) and in younger undernourished girls (median 4.2 microg/L) did not differ from concentrations in healthy children (median 2.9, 2.9, and 3.4 microg/L, respectively). Leptin concentrations in older undernourished girls were significantly lower than in healthy girls (median 4.2 vs. 8.8 microg/L, respectively; p < 0.05) of comparable age. In healthy children, leptin levels correlated with gender, body mass, BMI, Cole ratio (r = 0.39-0.41, r = 0.33, r = 0.28, r = 0.22, respectively; p < 0.005), and height (r = 0.19; p < 0.05). Serum leptin concentrations in undernourished children correlated with gender, arm circumference, and BMI (r = 0.27-0.35, r = 0.27, r = 0.25, respectively; p < 0.05). CONCLUSIONS: Our results show that serum leptin concentration is not a useful indicator of mild and moderate malnutrition in prepubertal children.},

   abstract = {Celiac disease (CD) is an autoimmune enteropathy, characterized by an inappropriate T-cell-mediated immune response to the ingestion of certain dietary cereal proteins in genetically susceptible individuals. This disorder presents environmental, genetic, and immunological components. CD presents a prevalence of up to 1% in populations of European ancestry, yet a high percentage of cases remain underdiagnosed. The diagnosis and treatment should be made early since untreated disease causes growth retardation and atypical symptoms, like infertility or neurological disorders. The diagnostic criteria for CD, which requires endoscopy with small bowel biopsy, have been changing over the last few decades, especially due to the advent of serological tests with higher sensitivity and specificity. The use of serological markers can be very useful to rule out clinical suspicious cases and also to help monitor the patients, after adherence to a gluten-free diet. Since the current treatment consists of a life-long gluten-free diet, which leads to significant clinical and histological improvement, the standardization of an assay to assess in an unequivocal way gluten in gluten-free foodstuff is of major importance.},

The method was applied to the determination of free and bound fumonisins in several gluten-free products from the Italian market. Free fumonisins were found to occur in 90% of the samples: the overall median value was below the EU legal limit for foods for human consumption (800 microg/kg). Nonetheless, fumonisins occurred in several samples at concentrations above the legal limit, reaching also very strong contamination levels (maximum concentration level: 3310 microg/kg). Anyway, considering the limited diet of people suffering of the celiac disease or allergic to other wheat proteins, the incidence of fumonisin contamination may be envisaged as problematic. Furthermore, bound fumonisins were found to be present in all the analysed samples at similar or even higher amounts than the free forms. In many cases the sum of free and bound fumonisins exceeded the EU legal limit for total fumonisins also for those samples characterized by a low contamination of free fumonisins, thus opening a new important task to be addressed for the risk assessment in this field.},

In vitro analysis on immature bone marrow-derived dendritic cells (iBMDCs) showed that all strains up-regulated surface B7-2 (CD86), indicative of DC maturation, however, with different intensity. No strain induced appreciable levels of IL-10 or IL-12 in iBMDCs, whereas TNF-alpha expression was essentially elicited by Lactobacillus paracasei and Lactobacillus fermentum. Interestingly, these strains were found also to increase the antigen-specific TNF-alpha secretion in vivo, following co-administration of probiotic bacteria in mice mucosally immunized with the gluten component gliadin. Together these findings highlighted the ability of probiotics to exert strain-specific inductive rather than suppressive effects both on the innate and adaptive immunity in a mouse model of food antigen sensitivity.},

   abstract = {Celiac disease (CD) is an enteropathy triggered by gluten and mediated by CD4+ T cells. A complete understanding of CD immunopathogenesis has been hindered due to the lack of adequate in vivo models. Here, we explored the effect of the inhibition of COX by indomethacin in wheat gliadin-sensitized transgenic mice expressing the HLA-DQ8 heterodimer, a molecule associated with CD. Treated mice showed a gliadin-specific immune response with a significant reduction of villus height, not linked to crypt hyperplasia and to expansion of intraepithelial T cells. Notably, treated mice showed increased numbers of CD25+ and apoptotic cells in the lamina propria, whereas high basal levels of IFN-gamma secretion, along with a reduced gliadin-specific IL-2 expression were detected in MLN. Biochemical assessment of the lesion revealed increased mRNA of Lamb3 and Adamts2, encoding for ECM proteins, and enhanced activities of metalloproteinases MMP1, 2 and 7. We conclude that an intestinal sensitivity to gliadin, in connection with COX inhibition, caused a decreased villus height in DQ8 tg mice. The lesion was induced by a deregulated mucosal cell immunity to gliadin, thus triggering activation of a specific ECM protein pathway responsible for lamina propria remodeling.},

   abstract = {Celiac disease is a serious condition affecting millions of individuals. Those afflicted with this illness are resigned to a lifelong avoidance of products containing the storage prolamin proteins found in cereal grains wheat, rye, and barley. Since many food products are based on these cereals, especially wheat, celiac patients have very limited food choices, and those that are available to them are generally poor in quality, often nutritionally deficient, and expensive. Furthermore, this condition also indirectly affects their families and friends with whom they share meals. Thus, a burgeoning need exists to develop nutritious, palatable, and affordable foods, especially staples like bread and pasta, for these individuals and their families and friends who are accustomed to wheat based products. Grain sorghum and its proteins are safe for celiac patients and individuals with varying levels of gluten intolerances. However, the main sorghum proteins, kafirins, are resistant to digestion. They are also difficult to extract and modify in an industrial-scale process and with food-compatible chemicals, thus limiting their use in foods. This review describes studies on kafirin extraction and methods for modifying sorghum proteins for improved nutrition and functionality, as well as food applications. Armed with this knowledge, scientists and technologists will be in a better position to identify opportunities that will further enhance the nutritional and functional value of sorghum proteins.},

These effects were also evaluated in cocultures of PBMCs and Caco-2 cells. The Gram-negative bacteria induced higher secretion of Th1-type proinflammatory cytokines (IL-12 and/or IFN-gamma) than the Bifidobacterium strains. Shigella CBD8 and E. coli CBL2 up-regulated mainly HLA-DR and CD40 expression involved in Th1 activation, and Bifidobacterium strains up-regulated CD83 expression. Specific interactions among the studied bacteria, gliadins, and IFN-gamma, which favored the CD immune features, were also detected. Therefore, intestinal bacteria could be additional factors that regulate the ability of monocytes recruited to the mucosa to respond to gliadins and IFN-gamma in CD patients, influencing the course of the disease.},

Coeliac disease (CD) is a permanent intolerance to cereal gluten proteins and the only therapy for the patients is to adhere to a life-long gluten-free diet (GFD). In the present preliminary study, the effects of a GFD on the composition and immune function of the gut microbiota were analysed in ten healthy subjects (mean age 30.3 years) over 1 month. Faecal microbiota was analysed by fluorescence in situ hybridisation (FISH) and quantitative PCR (qPCR). The ability of faecal bacteria to stimulate cytokine production by peripheral blood mononuclear cells (PBMC) was determined by ELISA. No significant differences in dietary intake were found before and after the GFD except for reductions (P = 0.001) in polysaccharides. Bifidobacterium, Clostridium lituseburense and Faecalibacterium prausnitzii proportions decreased (P = 0.007, P = 0.031 and P = 0.009, respectively) as a result of the GFD analysed by FISH. Bifidobacterium, Lactobacillus and Bifidobacterium longum counts decreased (P = 0.020, P = 0.001 and P = 0.017, respectively), while Enterobacteriaceae and Escherichia coli counts increased (P = 0.005 and P = 0.003) after the GFD assessed by qPCR. TNF-alpha, interferon-gamma, IL-10 and IL-8 production by PBMC stimulated with faecal samples was also reduced (P = 0.021, P = 0.037, P = 0.002 and P = 0.007, respectively) after the diet. Therefore, the GFD led to reductions in beneficial gut bacteria populations and the ability of faecal samples to stimulate the host's immunity. Thus, the GFD may constitute an environmental variable to be considered in treated CD patients for its possible effects on gut health.},

   abstract = {PURPOSE: Celiac disease (CD) is a permanent intolerance to wheat prolamins and related proteins displayed by genetically susceptible individuals. Blocking or modulation of CD-specific T cell response by altered prolamin peptides are currently considered as a potential alternative to the only effective therapy of CD based on a life-long gluten-free diet. Two prolamin peptides, the 9-mer ASRVAPGQQ and the 10-mer GTVGVAPGQQ sequences, were identified by mass spectrometry in the peptic/tryptic digest of prolamins (PTP) from durum wheat (Triticum turgidum ssp. durum) cv. Adamello, and investigated for their ability to preclude the stimulation of CD-specific mucosal T cells by gluten proteins. METHODS: Gluten-specific polyclonal intestinal T cell lines from five CD children (mean age 5 years) were exposed to 50 microg/ml of a deamidated PTP from whole flour of common wheat (T. aestivum) cv. San Pastore, and tested for proliferation and production of interferon-gamma (INF-gamma) and interleukin 10 (IL-10). The same experiment was performed in the presence of 20 microg/ml of the 9-mer or the 10-mer peptide. RESULTS: T cells exposed to PTP showed a threefold increase in proliferation and INF-gamma production, and a significant (P <or= 0.05) reduction in IL-10 secretion as compared with control cells incubated with the culture medium. Addition of either the 9-mer or the 10-mer peptide to PTP downregulated T cell proliferation and INF-gamma production, and caused a significant (P <or= 0.05) increase in IL-10 secretion. CONCLUSIONS: The T cell reactivity elicited by PTP is precluded by both the 9-mer and the 10-mer sequence, suggesting that over-expression of these proteolytically stable peptides may result in a wheat flour with reduced toxicity for CD patients.},

Water activity (aw), acceptability and texture parameters (hardness, gumminess, chewiness, adhesiveness and cohesiveness) were also determined. Commercial products (C) were taken as reference and were performed the same analysis to formulated products (F). Significant differences were found in protein, fat moisture, ash and fiber content and in most of the texture parameters studied in both food groups (p<0.05). In pancakes and scones (F) was observed an increase of protein of 88 and 198% respectively, while prepizza and bread (F) showed lower contents (8 and 22%) respect to their commercial pairs, however all products (F) have Chemical Scores higher to 100. The aw of products (F) and (C), gave values similar to the data cited on bibliography for analogous products. The formulations more acceptable (values over 80%) were scones and pancakes.

   abstract = {OBJECTIVE: To investigate the effects of Radix Astragali, a traditional Chinese medicine, on endothelium-dependent and non-dependent vasodilation in food-induced obese SD rats. METHODS: Fifteen male Sprague-Dawley rats were divided into 3 groups. The control group (n=5) was fed with normal chow; The obese group (n=5) was fed with high fat chow; The Astragali group (n=5) was fed with high fat chow and Astragali in drinking water. At the end of six weeks, all rats were killed and heart blood samples were taken to assess serum triglyceride, total cholesterol, and free fat acid. The thoracic aortas rings were harvested and equilibrated in Krebs-Henseleit solution. To measure the endothelium-dependent relaxation, the aortas rings were constricted in response to norepinephrine. After a stable contraction plateau was reached, cumulative dose-response for relaxation to Acetylcholine (10(-8)-10(-4) mol/L) were obtained in each rings. Identical experiments were conducted with 10(-8)-10(-4) mol/L sodium nitroprusside as the endothelium independent vasorelaxting agent. Responses to vasodlilators were expressed as percentage relaxation in all preconstricted state. RESULTS: The ratio of celiac fat and body weight in the obese rats was higher than in the controls. The levels of serum triglyceride, total cholesterol, and free fat acid were elevated in the Obese Group compared with the Control Group. The Astragali Group had lower triglyceride and free fat acid levels than the Obese Group. Compared with the rats with high-fat diet, the rats fed with Astragali lost about 32% of celiac fat. Acetylcholine (10(-8)-10(-4) mol/L) caused a concentration-dependent relaxation in all preconstricted aortic rings. Compared to the control group, maximal endothelium dependent relaxation in the obese group was impaired (P<0.05). In the Astragali group, the relaxation to acetylcholine was intermediate between control and obese group (P<0.05). Sodium nitroprusside (10(-8)-10(-4) mol/L) induced potent relaxation (endothelium independent relaxation) in all rat aortic rings that did not differ statistically between groups. CONCLUSION: Astragalus has salutary effects on impaired endothelial dysfunction in the context of obesity.},

   abstract = {OBJECTIVES: This study was aimed at showing the safety, for young patients with celiac disease (CD), of sweet baked goods made of wheat flour, which was rendered gluten-free during sourdough fermentation. METHODS AND RESULTS: As shown by R5 antibody-based sandwich and competitive enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay (ELISA), selected lactobacilli and fungal proteases, routinely used in bakeries, degraded gluten to <10 ppm during sourdough fermentation. The resulting flour was mainly a mixture of water-/salt-soluble low-size peptides and free amino acids. Gliadin and glutenin fractions extracted from the pepsin-trypsin (PT) digest of the fermented wheat flour induced the expression of interferon (IFN)-gamma at the level comparable with the negative control. After fermentation, the wheat flour was spray dried and used for making sweet baked goods. Eight patients with CD in remission were enrolled for the clinical challenge, and they daily consumed 200 g of sweet baked goods equivalent to 10 g of native gluten. Hematology, serology (total serum IgA, IgG and IgA antigluten, endomysial and tissue transglutaminase IgA antibodies), and intestinal permeability analyses were carried out over time. One patient interrupted the trial after 15 days and another after 30 days only due to difficulties in the compliance of the daily consumption. All of the other patients showed normal values of hematology, serology, and intestinal permeability during 60 days of challenge. CONCLUSIONS: This study showed that a wheat flour-fermented product, having gluten completely degraded, is not toxic for patients with CD. Nevertheless, these foods should not be recommended for patients with celiac disease until a formal trial has been done.},

Though 60% ethanol is the most commonly used solvent for prolamins extraction, 2-mercaptoethanol (2-ME) and guanidinium chloride (GuHCl) can be added to increase protein recovery. However, ethanol and denaturing agents interfere with antigen recognition when conventional antibodies are used. In the present work, a new method for gliadins quantification is shown. The method is based on the selection of llama single domain antibody fragments able to operate under denaturing conditions. Six out of 28 VHH-phages obtained retained their binding capacity in 15% ethanol. Selected clones presented a long CDR3 region containing two additional cysteines that could be responsible for the higher stability. One of the clones (named VHH26) was fully operative in the presence of 15% ethanol, 0.5% 2-ME, and 0.5 M GuHCl. Capture ELISA using VHH26 was able to detect gliadins in samples shown as negatives by conventional ELISA. Therefore, this new strategy appears as an excellent platform for quantitative determination of proteins or any other immunogenic compound, in the presence of denaturing agents, when specific recognition units with high stability are required.},

The grating process for ahipa flour production required a pressing step (AFGP) and the recovery of the starch leached. The slicing procedure (AFS) was simpler and the resulting product showed higher contents of potassium, magnesium, calcium and protein than did AFGP, which showed lower sodium and higher acid detergent fibre contents, together with lower gelatinisation temperature.

   abstract = {The term oral (or mucosal) tolerance has been classically defined as the suppression of T- and B-cell responses to an antigen by prior administration of the antigen by the oral route. In recent years, it has become clear that both innate and acquired regulatory immune responses are essential for the development of oral tolerance. As such, mucosal microenvironmental factors such as transforming growth factor- beta, prostaglandins but also dietary vitamin A create conditioning of an adaptive regulatory T-cell response that suppresses subsequent antigen-specific responses. Particular resident subsets of antigen presenting dendritic cells are pivotal to convey conditioning signals next to the presentation of antigen. This review discusses the primary mechanisms of adaptive regulatory T-cell induction to ingested soluble protein antigen. However, we also discuss the limitations of our knowledge with respect to understanding the very common food hypersensitivity Celiac disease caused by an aberrant adaptive immune response to the food protein gluten.},

   abstract = {Active celiac disease is associated with positive endomysial (EMA) and tissue transglutaminase (TTG) antibodies, elevated zonulin levels, and increased intestinal permeability. There is little known about what happens to these immunologic and structural abnormalities in patients on a gluten-free diet and their correlation with small-bowel biopsy changes. Adult patients previously diagnosed with celiac disease and on a gluten-free diet for greater than 1 year were considered for the study. All patients underwent the following: measurement of EMA and TTG antibodies, serum zonulin levels, intestinal permeability (IP) testing with lactulose/mannitol ratios, food diary analysis for gluten ingestion and small- bowel biopsy. A total of 21 patients on a gluten-free diet for a mean of 9.7 years completed the study. There were ten patients who had normalization of intestinal biopsies, IP and TTG, and EM antibodies. Six patients had Marsh type 2 or 3 lesions and all had either abnormal IP (5/6) or TTG antibody (4/6). In patients with Marsh type 3 lesions, there was a correlation between IP and zonulin levels. A subgroup of patients with celiac disease on a gluten-free diet has complete normalization of intestinal biopsies, intestinal permeability defects, and antibody levels. Patients with Marsh type 3 lesions have abnormal TTG antibodies and intestinal permeability with zonulin levels that correlate with IP. These abnormalities may be due to continued gluten ingestion. Further study is needed to determine the clinical utility of TTG antibodies and IP testing in following patients with celiac disease.},

   abstract = {GOALS: To determine whether personality traits and psychological characteristics are related to gluten-free diet (GFD) adherence in an adult population diagnosed with celiac disease (CD). BACKGROUND: Little research has examined psychological correlates of adherence to the GFD. STUDY: One hundred fifty-seven adults with biopsy-confirmed CD on the GFD for >3 months completed measures of personality and self-reported GFD adherence, provided a blood sample, and participated in an evaluation of GFD adherence conducted by an expert dietician at a clinical care center in a major teaching hospital in Boston, MA. RESULTS: An expert evaluation of GFD adherence remained the "gold standard" for measuring GFD adherence when compared with self-report and serology. Logistic regression results indicated that the following were independently associated with GFD adherence: conscientiousness (B=-0.04, SE=0.01, P<0.00), values (B=-0.10, SE=0.05, P<0.05), other food intolerances [odds ratio=0.28, 95% confidence interval=0.10-0.78], and CD symptoms (B=0.05, SE=0.02, P<0.03). A model accounting for these associations effectively predicted whether a participant was adherent or nonadherent on the basis of psychological and demographic/disease-specific factors. Successful prediction rates of GFD adherence for the final model were 75.8% for those rated to be adherent with the GFD and 54.5% for those rated to be nonadherent with the GFD. CONCLUSIONS: The model of psychological and demographic/disease-specific characteristics developed can be used to identify patients who may be at risk for poor dietary adherence to provide additional support, education, and encouragement to individuals with CD.},

   abstract = {BACKGROUND AND AIMS: Celiac sprue is a life-long disease characterized by an intestinal inflammatory response to dietary gluten. A gluten-free diet is an effective treatment for most patients, but accidental ingestion of gluten is common, leading to incomplete recovery or relapse. Food-grade proteases capable of detoxifying moderate quantities of dietary gluten could mitigate this problem. METHODS: We evaluated the gluten detoxification properties of two food-grade enzymes, aspergillopepsin (ASP) from Aspergillus niger and dipeptidyl peptidase IV (DPPIV) from Aspergillus oryzae. The ability of each enzyme to hydrolyze gluten was tested against synthetic gluten peptides, a recombinant gluten protein, and simulated gastric digests of whole gluten and whole-wheat bread. Reaction products were analyzed by mass spectrometry, HPLC, ELISA with a monoclonal antibody that recognizes an immunodominant gluten epitope, and a T cell proliferation assay. RESULTS: ASP markedly enhanced gluten digestion relative to pepsin, and cleaved recombinant alpha2-gliadin at multiple sites in a non-specific manner. When used alone, neither ASP nor DPPIV efficiently cleaved synthetic immunotoxic gluten peptides. This lack of specificity for gluten was especially evident in the presence of casein, a competing dietary protein. However, supplementation of ASP with DPPIV enabled detoxification of moderate amounts of gluten in the presence of excess casein and in whole-wheat bread. ASP was also effective at enhancing the gluten-detoxifying efficacy of cysteine endoprotease EP-B2 under simulated gastric conditions. CONCLUSIONS: Clinical studies are warranted to evaluate whether a fixed dose ratio combination of ASP and DPPIV can provide near-term relief for celiac patients suffering from inadvertent gluten exposure. Due to its markedly greater hydrolytic activity against gluten than endogenous pepsin, food-grade ASP may also augment the activity of therapeutically relevant doses of glutenases such as EP-B2 and certain prolyl endopeptidases.},

   abstract = {Anemia is a frequent finding in most diseases which cause malabsorption. The most frequent etiology is the combination of iron and vitamin B12 deficiency. Celiac disease is frequently diagnosed in patients referred for evaluation of iron deficiency anemia (IDA), being reported in 1.8%-14.6% of patients. Therefore, duodenal biopsies should be taken during endoscopy if no obvious cause of iron deficiency (ID) can be found. Cobalamin deficiency occurs frequently among elderly patients, but it is often unrecognized because the clinical manifestations are subtle; it is caused primarily by food-cobalamin malabsorption and pernicious anemia. The classic treatment of cobalamin deficiency has been parenteral administration of the vitamin. Recent data suggest that alternative routes of cobalamin administration (oral and nasal) may be useful in some cases. Anemia is a frequent complication of gastrectomy, and has been often described after bariatric surgery. It has been shown that banding procedures which maintain digestive continuity with the antrum and duodenum are associated with low rates of ID. Helicobacter pylori (H. pylori) infection may be considered as a risk factor for IDA, mainly in groups with high demands for iron, such as some children and adolescents. Further controlled trials are needed before making solid recommendations about H. pylori eradication in these cases.},

PATIENTS AND METHODS: This study enrolled 100 subjects, including 50 children with CD on a gluten-free diet and a control group of 50 healthy children. Statistical analysis to compare groups was performed using one-way ANOVA. RESULTS: A significant increase in fat consumption was observed in children with CD as compared to healthy children. The daily fat intake was 72.5 +/- 37.2 g per 100 g of food in the CD group and 52.9 +/- 35.4 g per 100 g of food in the control group (p < 0.008). A significant difference in fat intake was found between celiac and healthy females (10.21 +/- 3.15 g/100 g in the celiac group vs 7.46 +/- 2.91 g/100 g in the control group), p = 0.004. CONCLUSIONS: This study describes a significantly higher fat consumption in patients with CD on GFD as compared to controls. This increase was more pronounced in females and during the puberal age. Based on these interesting preliminary results we estimate that further investigations are necessary, such as a randomized multicentre study on the long-term effects of GFD with particular attention to the imbalance in daily fat intake.},

Celiac disease (CD), a food gluten-sensitive enteropathy, is considered a T-cell-mediated autoimmune disease and is generally associated with an overall increased risk of cancer in CD patients. We observed a higher percentage of circulating CD4+CD25+Foxp3+ T cells and an increased Foxp3 expression in CD4+CD25+ T cells from untreated than from treated CD patients. In co-culture, CD4+CD25+ T cells from both treated and untreated CD patients significantly suppressed the proliferation of autologous CD4+CD25(-) T cells similarly to values in healthy subjects. Our study suggests that Treg proportion and Foxp3 expression in circulating CD4+CD25+ T cells could justify the increased global risk of malignancy in CD population and support the efficacy of lifelong gluten-free diet in the reduction of the cancer risk.},

   abstract = {Celiac disease (CD) is a permanent gastrointestinal disorder characterized by the intolerance to a group of proteins called gluten present in wheat, rye, barley, and possibly oats. The only therapy is a strict lifelong gluten-free diet. The standard method for gluten determination in foods produced for CD patients is the R5-enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay (ELISA) as proposed by the recent Codex Alimentarius Draft Revised Standard. This test is based on the determination of prolamins, the alcohol-soluble proteins of gluten, and is available as a sandwich ELISA for intact proteins and as a competitive ELISA for gluten-derived peptides. While the suitability of the sandwich ELISA including a wheat prolamin (gliadin) reference for calibration has been shown by various studies and a ring test, the competitive ELISA still lacks a convenient reference for the quantitation of gluten peptides in fermented cereal foods (e.g., sourdough products, starch syrup, malt extracts, beer). Therefore, the aim of the present study was to prepare a suitable reference for the quantitation of partially hydrolyzed gluten in fermented wheat, rye, and barley products. The prolamin fractions from barley (hordein) and rye (secalin) were isolated from corresponding flours by means of a modified preparative Osborne fractionation. The prolamin fraction from wheat was obtained as reference gliadin from the Prolamin Working Group. The prolamin fractions were successively digested by pepsin and trypsin or pepsin and chymotrypsin procedures, which have been used for CD-specific toxicity tests on cereal storage proteins for many years. The protein/peptide content (N x 5.7) of the prolamin fractions and digests, which was the basis for the calculation of the gluten content by means of ELISA, varied between 67.1% and 96.0%. The prolamin fractions and enzymatic digests were then tested for their response in both sandwich and competitive assays. Intact prolamins responded similarly in both ELISA showing no important differences between the cereals. In the case of digested proteins, however, the sandwich ELISA was considerably less sensitive than the competitive ELISA. The former provided approximately 40% and the latter 70% of the signal intensity obtained with the intact prolamins. Thus, the combination of the competitive ELISA and the enzymatic digests of prolamin fractions as reference was considered to be an adequate system for the analysis of partially hydrolyzed gluten. The limit of detection using a peptic-tryptic hordein digest as reference was 2.3 microg prolamin equivalent per milliliter, and the limit of quantitation was 6.7 microg prolamin equivalent per milliliter. This system was applied for the determination of gluten equivalents in five commercial beverages based on fermented cereals.},

   abstract = {BACKGROUND & AIMS: Celiac disease (CD) is characterized by an inflammatory response to wheat gluten, rye, and barley proteins. Fermentation of wheat flour with sourdough lactobacilli and fungal proteases decreases the concentration of gluten. We evaluated the safety of daily administration of baked goods made from this hydrolyzed form of wheat flour to patients with CD. METHODS: Patients were randomly assigned to consumption of 200 g per day of natural flour baked goods (NFBG) (80,127 ppm gluten; n = 6), extensively hydrolyzed flour baked goods (S1BG) (2480 ppm residual gluten; n = 2), or fully hydrolyzed baked goods (S2BG) (8 ppm residual gluten; n = 5) for 60 days. RESULTS: Two of the 6 patients who consumed NFBG discontinued the challenge because of symptoms; all had increased levels of anti-tissue transglutaminase (tTG) antibodies and small bowel deterioration. The 2 patients who ate the S1BG goods had no clinical complaints but developed subtotal atrophy. The 5 patients who ate the S2BG had no clinical complaints; their levels of anti-tTG antibodies did not increase, and their Marsh grades of small intestinal mucosa did not change. CONCLUSIONS: A 60-day diet of baked goods made from hydrolyzed wheat flour, manufactured with sourdough lactobacilli and fungal proteases, was not toxic to patients with CD. A combined analysis of serologic, morphometric, and immunohistochemical parameters is the most accurate method to assess new therapies for this disorder.},

   abstract = {The intestinal epithelium is a single-cell layer that constitutes the largest and most important barrier against the external environment. It acts as a selectively permeable barrier, permitting the absorption of nutrients, electrolytes, and water while maintaining an effective defense against intraluminal toxins, antigens, and enteric flora. The epithelium maintains its selective barrier function through the formation of complex protein-protein networks that mechanically link adjacent cells and seal the intercellular space. The protein networks connecting epithelial cells form 3 adhesive complexes: desmosomes, adherens junctions, and tight junctions. These complexes consist of transmembrane proteins that interact extracellularly with adjacent cells and intracellularly with adaptor proteins that link to the cytoskeleton. Over the past decade, there has been increasing recognition of an association between disrupted intestinal barrier function and the development of autoimmune and inflammatory diseases. In this review we summarize the evolving understanding of the molecular composition and regulation of intestinal barrier function. We discuss the interactions between innate and adaptive immunity and intestinal epithelial barrier function, as well as the effect of exogenous factors on intestinal barrier function. Finally, we summarize clinical and experimental evidence demonstrating intestinal epithelial barrier dysfunction as a major factor contributing to the predisposition to inflammatory diseases, including food allergy, inflammatory bowel diseases, and celiac disease.},

   abstract = {AIM: To investigate the effect of vitamin supplements on homocysteine levels in patients with celiac disease. METHODS: Vitamin B6, folate, vitamin B12, and fasting plasma homocysteine levels were measured in 51 consecutive adults with celiac disease [median (range) age 56 (18-63) years; 40% men, 26 (51%) had villous atrophy, and 25 (49%) used B-vitamin supplements] and 50 healthy control individuals matched for age and sex. Finally, the C677T polymorphism of 5,10-methylenetetrahydrofolate reductase (MTHFR) was evaluated in 46 patients with celiac disease and all control individuals. RESULTS: Patients with celiac disease and using vitamin supplements had higher serum vitamin B6 (P = 0.003), folate (P < 0.001), and vitamin B12 (P = 0.012) levels than patients who did not or healthy controls (P = 0.035, P < 0.001, P = 0.007, for vitamin B6, folate, and vitamin B12, respectively). Lower plasma homocysteine levels were found in patients using vitamin supplements than in patients who did not (P = 0.001) or healthy controls (P = 0.003). However, vitamin B6 and folate, not vitamin B12, were significantly and independently associated with homocysteine levels. Twenty-four (48%) of 50 controls and 23 (50%) of 46 patients with celiac disease carried the MTHFR thermolabile variant T-allele (P = 0.89). CONCLUSION: Homocysteine levels are dependent on Marsh classification and the regular use of B-vitamin supplements is effective in reduction of homocysteine levels in patients with celiac disease and should be considered in disease management.},

   abstract = {OBJECTIVES: Gluten sensitivity can engender neurologic dysfunction, one of the two commonest presentations being peripheral neuropathy. The commonest type of neuropathy seen in the context of gluten sensitivity is sensorimotor axonal. We report 17 patients with sensory ganglionopathy associated with gluten sensitivity. METHODS: This is a retrospective observational case series of 17 patients with sensory ganglionopathy and gluten sensitivity. All patients had been followed up for a number of years in dedicated gluten sensitivity/neurology and neuropathy clinics. RESULTS: Out of a total of 409 patients with different types of peripheral neuropathies, 53 (13%) had clinical and neurophysiologic evidence of sensory ganglionopathy. Out of these 53 patients, 17 (32%) had serologic evidence of gluten sensitivity. The mean age of those with gluten sensitivity was 67 years and the mean age at onset was 58 years. Seven of those with serologic evidence of gluten sensitivity had enteropathy on biopsy. Fifteen patients went on a gluten-free diet, resulting in stabilization of the neuropathy in 11. The remaining 4 had poor adherence to the diet and progressed, as did the 2 patients who did not opt for dietary treatment. Autopsy tissue from 3 patients demonstrated inflammation in the dorsal root ganglia with degeneration of the posterior columns of the spinal cord. CONCLUSIONS: Sensory ganglionopathy can be a manifestation of gluten sensitivity and may respond to a strict gluten-free diet.},

   abstract = {BACKGROUND: Coeliac disease is increasingly diagnosed in adult patients who present with atypical symptoms or who are asymptomatic and detected by case screening. Its treatment, a gluten-free diet, can have a considerable impact on daily living. Understanding the factors associated with non-adherence is important in terms of supporting patients with their condition. AIM: To investigate factors associated with adherence to a gluten-free diet in adults with coeliac disease. METHODS: A literature search of multiple electronic databases using a pre-determined search string for literature between 1980 and November 2007 identified a possible 611 hits. After checking for relevance, 38 studies were included in this review. RESULTS: Rates for strict adherence range from 42% to 91% depending on definition and method of assessment and are the lowest among ethnic minorities and those diagnosed in childhood. Adherence is most strongly associated with cognitive, emotional and socio-cultural influences, membership of an advocacy group and regular dietetic follow-up. Screen and symptom-detected coeliac patients do not differ in their adherence to a gluten-free diet. CONCLUSIONS: The existing evidence for factors associated with non-adherence to a gluten-free diet is of variable quality. Further and more rigorous research is needed to characterize those individuals most likely to be non-adherent to assist them better with their treatment.},

We investigated whether synthetic peptides with high affinity to gliadin could alter tTG activity on gliadin and whole gluten digest. The immobilized substrates were incubated with synthetic peptides identified by the phage display technique and a control peptide with no affinity to gliadin. Transglutaminase activity was measured with time resolved fluorescence. The mean tTG activity, compared to that of the control without the peptides, was reduced by 31, 33, and 36% for three selected gliadin-binding peptides, and 30% for the peptide pool (P < or = 0.001-0.004) when gliadin was the substrate. Finally, substrate specificity experiments suggested that avenin was processed in a manner similar that used for gliadin during in vitro assays with tTG. The results showed that the blocking peptides efficiently reduced tTG processing of gliadin in vitro, and this strategy will be further investigated as an alternative therapy for celiac disease.},

The aim of our study was to investigate whether the dietary (nondietary) compliance is associated with health-related quality of life (HRQoL) of coeliac patients. METHODS: Patients from our hospital, known with coeliac disease for more than 10 years, were invited to participate in a study on possible gluten tolerance. HRQoL was assessed by the Short Form-36 health survey, symptoms by the Gastrointestinal Symptom Rating Scale and dietary compliance by a food frequency questionnaire. HRQoL of coeliac patients was compared with that of the general population. RESULTS: Fifty-three biopsy-confirmed coeliac patients were divided into three groups according to gluten consumption: GFD (n = 33), gluten transgression (<10 g gluten/day; n = 8) and normal gluten-containing diet (>10 g gluten/day; n = 12). Compared with the general population, coeliac patients scored significantly worse on general health perception but significantly better on bodily pain and limitations due to physical problems. The results of the Gastrointestinal Symptom Rating Scale and the Short Form-36 health survey were similar in all three dietary groups. CONCLUSION: Although adhering to the GFD is strictly important to prevent future complications, patients who stop following GFD do exist and patients with partial or nonadherence report similar HRQoL compared with patients with strict adherence in this group of adult coeliac patients.},

A disorder in which more effective screening would be beneficial is celiac disease (CD), an under-diagnosed autoimmune disease of the small intestine characterized by nutritional malabsorption, which presents with diverse, and sometimes serious, symptoms. We aimed to determine whether breath analyses could be used to screen for the presence of CD. METHODS: Based on our hypotheses that malabsorption of dietary carbohydrates would lead to over production of alcohol fermentation products in the large intestine, we investigated levels of alcohols in the breath of 10 patients with CD compared to that in 10 healthy controls using selected ion flow tube mass spectrometry (SIFT-MS). RESULTS: No differences were found in the breath levels of methanol, propanol, butanol, heptanol or hexanol investigated using chemical ionization of breath air with H3O+ and/or NO+ precursor ions. In one patient, diagnosed within days of our study and not currently in receipt of any therapeutic intervention, a relatively high production of three product ions was detected compared to all other study patients. CONCLUSION: Our data suggest that breath alcohol levels are unlikely to be of diagnostic use in CD, although further investigation of those recently diagnosed with the disorder may be warranted.},

   abstract = {Irritable bowel syndrome (IBS) in man is not a single entity but has several causes. One of the most common forms has similarities with colic and laminitis in horses. Undigested food residues may pass from the small intestine into the colon where bacterial fermentation produces chemicals that lead to disease. In horses the consequences may be disastrous, but in healthy humans such malabsorption may not be harmful. After events such as bacterial gastroenteritis or antibiotic treatment, an imbalance of the colonic microflora with overgrowth of facultative anaerobes may arise, leading to malfermentation and IBS. It is not known whether such subtle changes may likewise be present in the microflora of horses who are susceptible to colic and laminitis.

   abstract = {UNLABELLED: Lactose stimulates proliferation and colonization of acidophilic bacteria, which due to fermentation processes lower colonic pH and simplified absorption of some microelements from the intestine. However, the common problem in children is intolerance of this carbohydrate. Treatment, quite simple, is based on partial or total elimination of lactose from diet. Some substitutional products with equivalent nutritional value should be introduced to prevent deficiencies symptoms during lactose-free diet. THE AIM OF THIS STUDY: Determination of milk and dairy products consumption and their connection with lactose malabsorption or lactose intolerance in children above 5 years of age in selected disorders of the alimentary tract: food allergy, celiac disease, secondary enteropathy, functional dyspepsia, irritable bowel syndrome and deficiency of body weight and height. MATERIAL AND METHODS: The number of 301 patients above 5 years of age (135 boys and 166 girls; mean age 11.5 years) were included into the study. Milk and dairy products consumption habits, lactose intolerance symptoms, hydrogen breath test, activity of lactase and villous atrophy were investigated. RESULTS: Decreased sweet milk consumption from, 33.33% in children with food allergy to 55.38% in children with functional indigestion was observed, in spite of gastrointestinal complaints after ingestion of milk. The biggest lactose malabsorption and lactose intolerance frequency was observed in children with decreased sweet milk consumption due to complaints after ingestion of milk and in children who didn't drink milk. There were no statistically significant difference between frequency of lactose malabsorption and lactose intolerance symptoms in children with different dairy products consumption habits. There were no statistically significant difference between frequency of hypolactasia in children with different sweet milk or dairy products consumption habits. CONCLUSIONS: Frequent (33-55%) decreased sweet milk consumption in children in spite of clinical symptoms after ingestion of milk was observed. The biggest lactose malabsorption and lactose intolerance symptoms frequency was observed in children who didn't drink milk and in children with decreased consumption of sweet milk due to complaints after ingestion of milk. There were no statistically significant difference between frequency of lactose malabsorption and lactose intolerance in children with different dairy products consumption habits.},

The clinically silent form affects the majority of patients. Hence, diarrhea, nutritional deficiencies and weight loss are symptoms which are not very often seen. Nonspecific complaints like headaches and joint pain have the potential to delay the diagnosis. The high risk groups have been identified to be those patients suffering from autoimmune insulin-dependent diabetes mellitus, osteoporosis, Sjogren's syndrome and the first degree relatives of CD patients. Those patients should be screened for CD. The association of CD with several autoimmune ailments has various explanations ranging from common genotypes to systemic immune reactions triggered by food antigens. CD is, nevertheless, an autoimmune disorder triggered by an environmental antigen (gluten) but, as opposed to other autoimmune disorders in which the pathogenic process is self-sustained, the removal of gluten from diet results in relatively fast resolution of histological and serological markers.},

   abstract = {Celiac disease (CD) is a type of intestinal malabsorption syndrome, in which the patients are intolerant to the gliadin in dietary gluten, resulting in chronic diarrhea and secondary malnutrition. The disease is common in Europe and the United States, but only sporadic reports are found in East Asia including China. Is CD really rare in China? We examined 62 patients by capsule endoscopy for chronic diarrhea from June 2003 to March 2008. Four patients with chronic diarrhea and weight loss were diagnosed to have CD. Under the capsule endoscopy, we observed that the villi of the proximal small bowel became short, and that the mucous membrane became atrophied in these four patients. Duodenal biopsies were performed during gastroscopy and the pathological changes of mucosa were confirmed to be Marsh 3 stage of CD. A gluten free diet significantly improved the conditions of the four patients. We suspect that in China, especially in the northern area where wheat is the main food, CD might not be uncommon, and its under-diagnosis could be caused by its clinical manifestations that could be easily covered by the symptoms from other clinical situations, particularly when it came to subclinical patients without obvious symptom or to patients with extraintestinal symptoms as the initial manifestations.},

Only 19 out of the 62 omega-secalin gene sequences were full-length open reading frames (ORFs), which can be expressed into functional proteins. The other 43 DNA sequences were pseudogenes, as their ORFs were interrupted by one or a few stop codons or frameshift mutations. The 19 omega-secalin genes have a typical primary structure, which is different from wheat gliadins. There was no cysteine residue in omega-secalin proteins, and the potential celiac disease (CD) toxic epitope (PQQP) was identified to appear frequently in the repetitive domains. The omega-secalin genes from various cereal species shared high homology in their gene sequences. The omega-secalin gene family has involved fewer variations after the integration of the rye R chromosome or whole genome into the wheat or triticale genome. The higher Ka/Ks ratio (i.e. non-synonymous to synonymous substitutions per site) in omega-secalin pseudogenes than in omega-secalin ORFs indicate that the pseudogenes may be subject to a reduced selection pressure. Based on the conserved sequences of omega-secalin genes, it will be possible to manipulate the expression of this gene family in rye, triticale, or wheat 1BL/1RS translocation lines, to reduce its negative effects on grain quality.},

   abstract = {Celiac disease is caused by uncontrolled CD4 T-cell responses directed to wheat-derived gluten peptides bound to the disease predisposing HLA-DQ molecules. The only available treatment is a life-long gluten-free diet which is complicated by the widespread use of wheat-derived gluten in the food industry. As the binding of gluten-derived peptides is a prerequisite for the induction of the inflammatory T-cell response, blockers that would prevent gluten peptide binding to the HLA-DQ molecules might be used as an alternative to the gluten-free diet. In the present study we have analyzed the binding properties of a set of previously identified natural ligands for HLA-DQ2, the primary disease predisposing allele. An in silico method, Epibase, ranked these peptides and the top one, a peptide with a nine amino acid core FVAEYEPVL, was measured among these peptides as the peptide with the highest binding affinity for HLA-DQ2. In a stepwise approach we subsequently tested the impact of N-terminal extensions and systematic single amino acid substitutions within the core of this peptide which revealed that an N-terminal extension with the tripeptide sequence ADA increased binding affinity 5- to 6-fold. In addition the substitution analysis indicated which amino acids were most preferred at anchor residues in the lead peptide, generally leading to an increase of binding affinity with a factor of 2. Next we tested which combinations of such preferred amino acids yielded the best results. The combined results indicate that a peptide with sequence ADAYDYESEELFAA (core in bold) had superior binding properties. This peptide was chosen as a lead peptide for further optimization with non-natural amino acids at the p1 position, since molecular modeling indicated that none of the natural amino acids is able to optimally occupy the p1 pocket. A set of 8 non-proteinogenic amino acids was designed, synthesized and incorporated in the lead peptide (and in two control peptides) and tested for binding to HLA-DQ2. The results indicate that the effect of the incorporation of these non-proteinogenic amino acids depended on the peptide in which they were incorporated and that the maximum increase in binding affinity obtained was approximately 2-fold. Altogether lead sequences were obtained that have a binding affinity for HLA-DQ2 that is 100- to 200-fold higher compared to that of the gluten-derived peptide that has the highest affinity for HLA-DQ2. Such peptides are candidate lead peptides for further optimization. Our results, however, also indicate that in order to obtain further significant increases in binding affinity alternative approaches will have to be explored.},

Pancreatic exocrine insufficiency, partial or complete loss of digestive enzyme synthesis, occurs primarily in disorders directly affecting pancreatic tissue integrity. However, other disorders of the gastrointestinal tract, such as coeliac disease, inflammatory bowel disease, Zollinger-Ellison syndrome or gastric resection can either mimic or cause pancreatic exocrine insufficiency. The overt clinical symptoms of pancreatic exocrine insufficiency are steatorrhoea and maldigestion, which frequently become apparent in advanced stages. Several direct and indirect function tests are available for assessment of pancreatic function but until today diagnosis of excretory insufficiency is difficult as in mild impairment clinically available function tests show limitations of diagnostic accuracy. This review focuses on diagnosis of pancreatic exocrine insufficiency in pancreatic and non-pancreatic disorders.},

The objective of this study was to clarify the effect of high amount of both kilned and unkilned oats on food and nutrient intakes in celiac patients in remission. Kilning as an industrial heating process is performed to preserve the main properties of oats and to lengthen its useableness. Kilning may, however, change the protein structure of oats and therefore influence on the intake of nutrients. SUBJECTS/METHODS: The study group consisted of 13 men and 18 women with celiac disease in remission. The patients who were earlier using moderate amount of oats as part of their GFD were randomized to consume kilned or unkilned oats. After 6 months, the patients changed the treatment groups. The goal of daily intake of oats was 100 g. Food records and frequency questionnaire were used to follow nutrient intakes. RESULTS: Type of oats did not affect the amount of oats used. In the group using kilned oats, the intake of vitamin B1 and magnesium and in the group of unkilned oats that of magnesium and zinc increased significantly during the first 6 months (P<or=0.05). CONCLUSIONS: :Large amounts of oats, both kilned and unkilned in GFD, can increase intakes of nutrients in celiac patients in remission. Oats improve the nutritional value of GFD.},

   abstract = {OBJECTIVES: Food allergy and celiac disease may lead to childhood constipation. Early introduction of food allergens and gluten in the first year of life has been suggested to have a function in these food intolerances, but it is unclear whether this also holds true for development of childhood constipation. The aim of this study was to assess the association between the timing of introduction of food allergens and gluten early in life and functional constipation in childhood. METHODS: This study was embedded in the Generation R study, a population-based prospective cohort study from fetal life until young adulthood. Functional constipation at 24 months of age was defined in 4,651 children according to the Rome II criteria of defecation frequency <3 times a week or the presence of mainly hard feces for at least 2 weeks. RESULTS: At the age of 24 months, 12% of the children had functional constipation. Children with functional constipation got introduced to gluten more often before or at the age of 6 months than children without functional constipation (37% and 27%, respectively). After adjustment for birth weight, gestational age, gender, ethnicity, maternal education, and family history of atopy and chronic intestinal disorders, functional constipation was significantly associated with early gluten introduction (odds ratio (OR): 1.35; 95% confidence interval (CI): 1.10-1.65). No association was found between timing of introduction of cow's milk, hen's egg, soy, peanuts, and tree nuts with functional constipation. A history of cow's milk allergy in the first year of life was significantly associated with functional constipation in childhood (OR: 1.57; 95% CI: 1.04-2.36). CONCLUSIONS: These results suggest that early gluten introduction in the first year of life provide a trigger for functional constipation in a subset of children. In case of functional constipation, there also might be a role for cow's milk allergy initiated in the first year of life.},

   abstract = {BACKGROUND: Immunity to food antigens (gliadin, cow's milk proteins) is in the centre of the attention of modern medicine focused on the prevention of diseases, prevention which is based on the use of appropriate restriction diet. Detection of the enhanced levels of the immune reactions to antigen(s) present in food is from this point of view of great importance because there are reports that some of health disturbances, like celiac disease (CD) and some premalignant conditions, like monoclonal gammopathy of undetermined significance (MGUS), were vanished after the appropriate restriction diets. It is well known that gliadin is toxic to small bowel mucosa of relatively small population of genetically predisposed individuals, who under this toxic action develop celiac disease (CD). As the quantity of immunogenic gliadin could vary between different wheat species, the first aim of this work was to determine the percentage of immunogenic gliadin in ten bread wheat cultivars and in three commercially grown durum wheat cultivars. The second part of the study was initiated by results of previous publication, reporting that sera of some of multiple myeloma (MM) patients showed the presence of elevated levels of anti-gliadin IgA, without the enhanced levels of anti-gliadin IgG antibodies, determined with commercial ELISA test. It was designed to assess is it possible to reveal is there any hidden, especially anti-gliadin IgG immunoreactivity, in serum of mentioned group of patients. For this purpose we tested MM patients sera, as well as celiac disease (CD) patients sera for the immunoreaction with the native gliadin isolated from wheat species used for bread and pasta making in corresponding geographic region. RESULTS: Gliadin was isolated from wheat flour by two step 60% ehanolic extraction. Its content was determined by commercial R5 Mendez Elisa using PWG gliadin as the standard. Results obtained showed that immunogenic gliadin content varies between 50.4 and 65.4 mg/g in bread wheat cultivars and between 20 and 25.6 mg/g in durum wheat cultivars. Anti-gliadin IgA and IgG immunoreactivity of patients' sera in (IU/ml) was firstly determined by commercial diagnostic Binding Site ELISA test, and then additionally by non-commercial ELISA tests, using standardized ethanol wheat extracts -gliadin as the antigen. In both patients groups IgA immunoreactivity to gliadin from different cultivars was almost homogenous and in correlation with results from commercial test (except for one patient with IgA(lambda) myeloma, they were more then five times higher). But, results for IgG immunoreactivity were more frequently inhomogeneous, and especially for few MM patients, they were more then five times higher and did not correlate with results obtained using Binding Site test. CONCLUSION: Results obtained showed different content of immunogenic gliadin epitopes in various species of wheat. They also point for new effort to elucidate is there a need to develop new standard antigen, the representative mixture of gliadin isolated from local wheat species used for bread production in corresponding geographic region for ELISA diagnostic tests.},

   abstract = {OBJECTIVES: A gluten-free diet omitting wheat, rye, and barley is the only effective treatment for coeliac disease. The necessity of excluding oats from the diet has remained controversial. We studied the toxicity of oats in children with coeliac disease during a 2-year follow-up by investigating jejunal transglutaminase 2 (TG2)-targeted IgA-class autoantibody deposits, a potentially more sensitive disease marker than serum antibodies or conventional histology. PATIENTS AND METHODS: Twenty-three coeliac children in remission were randomized to undergo oat or gluten challenge with wheat, rye, barley, and oats. When jejunal histological relapse was evident after gluten challenge, patients excluded wheat, rye, and barley but continued with oats. Mucosal morphology and TG2-targeted autoantibody deposits were studied in jejunal biopsies taken at baseline and after 6 and 24 months. Furthermore, serum IgA-class TG2 antibodies were measured. RESULTS: At baseline, serum TG2 antibodies were negative in all 23 patients, but 7 of them had minor mucosal deposits. In the oats group, there was no significant change in the intensity of the deposits within 2 years. In contrast, during the gluten challenge, the intensity of the deposits clearly increased and decreased again when wheat, rye, and barley were excluded but consumption of oats was continued; this was in line with serum autoantibodies. The intensity of the mucosal deposits correlated well with both villous morphology and serum autoantibody levels. CONCLUSIONS: Consumption of oats does not induce TG2 autoantibody production at mucosal level in children with coeliac disease. Measurement of small-intestinal mucosal autoantibody deposits is suitable for monitoring treatment in coeliac patients.},

   abstract = {Various mechanisms detect the presence of dietary triacylglycerols (TAG) in the digestive tract and link TAG ingestion to the regulation of energy homeostasis. We here propose a novel sensing mechanism with the potential to encode dietary TAG-derived energy by translating enterocyte fatty acid oxidation (FAO) into vagal afferent signals controlling eating. Peripheral FAO has long been implicated in the control of eating (141). The prevailing view was that mercaptoacetate (MA) and other FAO inhibitors stimulate eating by modulating vagal afferent signaling from the liver. This concept has been challenged because hepatic parenchymal vagal afferent innervation is scarce and because experimentally induced changes in hepatic FAO often fail to affect eating. Nevertheless, intraperitoneally administered MA acts in the abdomen to stimulate eating because this effect was blocked by subdiaphragmatic vagal deafferentation (21), a surgical technique that eliminates all vagal afferents from the upper gut. These and other data support a role of the small intestine rather than the liver as a FAO sensor that can influence eating. After intrajejunal infusions, MA also stimulated eating in rats through vagal afferent signaling, and after infusion into the superior mesenteric artery, MA increased the activity of celiac vagal afferent fibers originating in the proximal small intestine. Also, pharmacological interference with TAG synthesis targeting the small intestine induced a metabolic profile indicative of increased FAO and inhibited eating in rats on a high-fat diet but not on chow. Finally, cell culture studies indicate that enterocytes oxidize fatty acids, which can be modified pharmacologically. Thus enterocytes may sense dietary TAG-derived fatty acids via FAO and influence eating through changes in intestinal vagal afferent activity. Further studies are necessary to identify the link between enterocyte FAO and vagal afferents and to examine the specificity and potential physiological relevance of such a mechanism.},

   abstract = {Dietary components may have an important role in maintaining a balanced gut microbiota composition. Celiac disease is an autoimmune enteropathy caused by gliadins, and has been associated with a reduced proportion of Bifidobacterium in gut microbiota. This study evaluates the influence of glycosaminoglycans (GAGs) on bacterial adhesion and their contribution in the gliadins-induced inflammatory response. The adhesion of potential probiotic (Bifidobacterium longum CECT 7347 and Bifidobacterium bifidum CECT 7365), commensal (Escherichia coli and Bacteroides fragilis) and pathogenic (Salmonella enterica CECT 443 and Listeria monocytogenes CECT 935) bacteria to mucin and Caco-2 cell cultures was determined. Gliadins were subjected to in vitro digestion (pepsin/pancreatin-bile), with/out GAGs, and the presence or not of cell suspensions of B. longum (10(8) CFU/ml). B. longum, E. coli, and L. monocytogenes, markedly interact with the high-sulphur-containing fraction of GAGs. The GAGs reduced the gliadins-mediated production of interleukin-1beta, but not tumour necrosis factor-alpha. The results suggest that GAGs may ameliorate gliadin-induced inflammatory response, though they also slightly interfere with the action of B. longum.},

   abstract = {The physiological mechanisms that preserve pancreatic beta-cell mass (BCM) are not fully understood. Although the regulation of islet function by the autonomic nervous system (ANS) is well established, its potential roles in BCM homeostasis and compensatory growth have not been adequately explored. The parasympathetic vagal branch of the ANS serves to facilitate gastrointestinal function, metabolism, and pancreatic islet regulation of glucose homeostasis, including insulin secretion. Given the functional importance of the vagus nerve and its branches to the liver, gut, and pancreas in control of digestion, motility, feeding behavior, and glucose metabolism, it may also play a role in BCM regulation. We have begun to examine the potential roles of the parasympathetic nervous system in short-term BCM maintenance by performing a selective bilateral celiac branch-vagus nerve transection (CVX) in normal Sprague-Dawley rats. CVX resulted in no detectable effects on basic metabolic parameters or food intake through 1 wk postsurgery. Although there were no differences in BCM or apoptosis in this 1-wk time frame, beta-cell proliferation was reduced 50% in the CVX rats, correlating with a marked reduction in activated protein kinase B/Akt. Unexpectedly, acinar proliferation was increased 50% in these rats. These data suggest that the ANS, via the vagus nerve, contributes to the regulation of BCM maintenance at the level of cell proliferation and may also mediate the drive for enhanced growth under physiological conditions when insulin requirements have increased. Furthermore, the disparate effects of CVX on beta-cell and acinar cells suggest that the endocrine and exocrine pancreas respond to different neural signals in regard to mass homeostasis.},

   abstract = {BACKGROUND: The only treatment for coeliac disease is lifelong adherence to a gluten-free diet. Several studies have reported nutritional deficiencies in individuals on a gluten-free diet. The present study aimed to determine whether the nutritional profile of gluten-free diet could be improved through the use of alternative grains. METHODS: A retrospective review of diet history records by a celiac specialist dietitian were used to establish a 'standard' gluten-free dietary pattern. An 'alternative' gluten-free dietary pattern was developed that substituted naturally gluten-free grains or gluten-free products made from 'alternative' flours (oats, high fibre gluten-free bread and quinoa) in the standard pattern. A paired t-test was performed to identify statistical significance between the 'alternative' and standard gluten-free dietary pattern. RESULTS: Analysis of standard pattern indicated that 38% of meals and snacks contained no grain or starch choice. Of those meals that contained a grain or starch component, rice was the grain chosen 44% of the time. The inclusion of alternative grains or grain products provided a higher nutrient profile compared to the standard gluten-free dietary pattern (P = 0.002). Several nutrients; protein (20.6 g versus 11 g), iron (18.4 mg versus 1.4 mg), calcium (182 mg versus 0 mg) and fibre (12.7 g versus 5 g) were significantly increased by changing the grain or starch component in the dietary pattern. The B vitamin content (riboflavin, niacin and folate) was improved, although this was not statistically significant (P = 0.125). DISCUSSION: The inclusion of alternative grain-based products increased the nutrient profile of the gluten-free dietary pattern significantly.},

   abstract = {Celiac disease comprises intolerance against dietary gluten present in wheat, rye and barley, and it belongs to the most common food-related life-long disorders in Western countries. Nowadays celiac disease is conceived as an autoimmune-mediated systemic disorder commonly presenting as enteropathy in genetically susceptible individuals. The most obvious feature distinguishing celiac disease from other small-intestinal enteropathies is the presence of autoantibodies against transglutaminase 2 (TG2) during a gluten-containing diet. The gluten-derived gliadin peptides and the self, TG2, have established and well-accepted role in celiac disease pathogenesis. TG2 is known to deamidate, and crosslink gluten-derived gliadin peptides to itself, thereby favoring disease progression. The celiac disease-specific TG2-targeted autoantibodies are deposited in the small-bowel mucosa as well as in other tissues, and interestingly, extraintestinal manifestations of the disease involving these particular tissues have been reported. As the TG2-targeted autoantibodies have experimentally been shown to modulate the function of different cell types in vitro similarly to what has been reported to occur in untreated celiac disease, they could constitute an important contribution to disease progression. In this review we discuss the role of TG2, the autoantigen and the autoantibodies targeted against it in the pathogenesis of celiac disease.},

   abstract = {Inflammatory bowel diseases (IBD) are chronic diseases of the intestinal tract which principally are composed of ulcerative colitis (UC) and Crohn's disease (CD). The prevalence and incidence of both forms of IBD have historically been higher in developed countries with decreasing North-South gradient. However, more recent evidence demonstrate changing demographics as countries become more developed and immigration increases from underdeveloped countries to developed countries. Typically these changes are marked by an increase in ulcerative colitis followed by an increase in CD. Thus, most if not all human populations appear to be susceptible to IBD under certain environmental influences. Several hypothesis have been advanced to explain these changing demographics including alterations in the bowel microflora, but direct experimental evidence is lacking in most cases. Celiac disease or gluten-sensitive enteropathy is a related inflammatory condition which is induced in susceptible individuals when exposed to gluten-containing foods. Similarly, the prevalence of celiac disease is increasing as the consumption of gluten-containing foods is increasing worldwide.},

   abstract = {The assortment and quality of bakery products designed for celiac patients may be improved by designing whole grain ingredients with low residual prolamin contents. The main objective of this study was to evaluate the extent of prolamin hydrolysis and pentosan solubilization in germinated-rye sourdoughs (GRSDs). Size-exclusion chromatography analyses, the fate of fluorescent prolamin, and immunological analyses determined the extent of prolamin hydrolysis and pentosan solubilization. Hydrolysis of rye prolamins was extensive in GRSDs, and according to enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay analyses, more than 99.5% of the prolamins were hydrolyzed. Pentosan solubilization occurred in native-rye sourdoughs, whereas in GRSDs, pentosans were partially hydrolyzed to monosaccharides. Test baking showed that the use of GRSD improved the overall quality of oat bread and that an estimated daily gluten intake from 100 g of bread would be less than 10 mg. However, the clinical safety must be assured before making any recommendations for celiac patients to use such products.},

Efficient responses need mucosal adjuvants: starting from cholera toxin, new variants of cholera toxin were developed depleted of toxicity. In addition, lipid colloidal particles, bacterial DNA, and probiotics have been experimented. Tolerance is currently induced by means of the B subunit of cholera toxin, whereas new strategies encompass the use of probiotics, expansion of regulatory T cells and blocking of paracellular entry of antigens. Finally, we report different approaches developed for celiac disease, an immune-mediated disease whose triggering antigen is known.},

In the gut, with exposure to myriad food and bacterial antigens, they probably control T cell unresponsiveness to food antigens and T cell hypersensitivity in disease situations. The need for the immune system to 'know' gut luminal antigens is demonstrated by the fact that dendritic cells send processes through the epithelium and directly sample antigens in the gut lumen. We present evidence that type I INF made by plasmacytoid dendritic cells may be important in coeliac disease.},

   abstract = {The selective CB1 receptor antagonist rimonabant is a novel weight control agent. Although CB1 receptors and binding sites are present in both the rodent central and peripheral nervous systems, including the afferent vagus nerve, the role of gut afferents in mediating anorexia following CB1R blockade is still debated. In the present study we examined rimonabant-induced anorexia in male C57BL/6J mice with subdiaphragmatic vagotomy (VGX) as well as in male Sprague-Dawley rats subjected to either subdiaphragmatic vagal deafferentation (SDA) alone or in combination with a complete celiac-superior mesenteric ganglionectomy (CGX). Irrespective of the operational procedure, rimonabant (10mg/kg) effectively reduced standard chow as well as palatable diet (ensure) intake. In conclusion, the data clearly demonstrate that neither vagal gut afferents, nor gut afferents traveling via the sympathetic nervous system, are required for rimonabant to inhibit food intake leading to the hypothesis that centrally located CB1 receptors are the prime mediators of rimonabant-induced anorexia.},

   abstract = {OBJECTIVE: Anti-tissue transglutaminase (TG2) antibodies are the serological marker of celiac disease. Given the close association between celiac disease and type 1 diabetes, we investigated the production and deposition of anti-TG2 antibodies in the jejunal mucosa of type 1 diabetic children. RESEARCH DESIGN AND METHODS: Intestinal biopsies were performed in 33 type 1 diabetic patients with a normal mucosal architecture: 14 had high levels (potential celiac disease patients) and 19 had normal levels of serum anti-TG2 antibodies. All biopsy specimens were investigated for intestinal deposits of IgA anti-TG2 antibodies by double immunofluorescence. In addition, an antibody analysis using the phage display technique was performed on the intestinal biopsy specimens from seven type 1 diabetic patients, of whom four had elevated and three had normal levels of serum anti-TG2 antibodies. RESULTS: Immunofluorescence studies showed that 11 of 14 type 1 diabetic children with elevated levels and 11 of 19 with normal serum levels of anti-TG2 antibodies presented with mucosal deposits of such autoantibodies. The phage display analysis technique confirmed the intestinal production of the anti-TG2 antibodies; however, whereas the serum-positive type 1 diabetic patients showed a preferential use of the VH5 antibody gene family, in the serum-negative patients the anti-TG2 antibodies belonged to the VH1 and VH3 families, with a preferential use of the latter. CONCLUSIONS: Our findings demonstrate that there is intestinal production and deposition of anti-TG2 antibodies in the jejunal mucosa of the majority of type 1 diabetic patients. However, only those with elevated serum levels of anti-TG2 antibodies showed the VH usage that is typical of the anti-TG2 antibodies that are produced in patients with celiac disease.},

   abstract = {OBJECTIVES: In children younger than 2 years of age, a diagnosis of celiac disease (CD) is difficult to make because anti-endomysium (anti-EMA)/anti-tissue transglutaminase 2 (anti-TG2) antibodies are less sensitive than in older children. The aim of our study was to evaluate how many children younger than 2 years of age and diagnosed with CD, were negative for serum anti-TG2 antibodies and to test the hypothesis that in these patients, TG2-specific IgA deposits could instead be present at mucosal level. PATIENTS AND METHODS: A total of 104 children younger than 2 years of age and 179 children older than 2 years, all of whom had been diagnosed with CD, were investigated for serum CD-associated antibodies (anti-gliadin [AGA] IgA and IgG, EMA-IgA, anti-TG2-IgA). The presence of intestinal anti-TG2 extracellular IgA deposits was searched by using double immunofluorescence in 56 of the patients younger than 2 years of age and in 40 of those who were older than 2 years. RESULTS: In children with CD who were younger than 2 years of age, high levels of AGA-IgA were found in 93/104 (89%) and 98/104 (94%) were found of have high levels of AGA-IgG. In children older than the age of 2 years with CD, 120/179 (67%) had high levels of AGA-IgA and 151/179 (84%) had high levels of AGA-IgG. Serum EMA were present in 92/104 (88%) in the younger group and in 176/179 (98%) of the older group. Ninety-one of 104 children (87%) younger and 172/179 (96%) older than 2 years showed high serum levels of anti-TG2. Finally, 41/56 (73%) children younger than 2 years and all of the 40 children (100%) older than 2 years of age showed mucosal anti-TG2-IgA deposits. CONCLUSIONS: EMA and anti-TG2-antibody measurements show higher sensitivity for the diagnosis of CD in children older than 2 years compared with younger children. The search for mucosal deposits of anti-TG2-IgA does not improve the diagnostic performance.},

   abstract = {Coeliac disease is an inflammatory disease of the upper small intestine and results from gluten ingestion in genetically susceptible individuals, and is the only life-long nutrient-induced enteropathy. The only treatment is a strict gluten-free diet and the longer the individual fails to adhere to this diet, the greater the chance of developing malnutrition and other complications. The existence of reliable gluten free food is crucial to the well-being of the population. Here we report on a microfluorimeter device for the in situ detection of gliadin in foodstuffs, which could be used for a rapid control of raw materials in food processing, as well as for process control of gliadin contamination. The microfluorimeter is based on a reflector that is used inside a microfluidic chip, exploiting various strategically placed reflective or totally metallised mirrors for efficient collection of the fluorescent light emitted in a large solid angle. The chip is capable of executing five assays in parallel and has been demonstrated to possess detection sensitivity applicable to fluoroimmunoassays. Various immunoassay formats exploiting fluorescence detection, using enzyme/fluorophore labels were developed and compared in terms of sensitivity, ease of assay, assay time and compatibility with buffer used to extract gliadin from raw and cooked foodstuffs, with the best performance observed with an indirect competition assay using a fluorophore-labelled anti-mouse antibody. This assay was exploited within the microfluorimeter device, and a very low detection limit of 4.1 ng/mL was obtained. The system was observed to be highly reproducible, with an RSD of 5.9%, for a concentration of 50 ng/mL of gliadin applied to each of the five channels of the microfluorimeter. Biofunctionalised disposable strips incorporated into the microfluorimeter were subjected to accelerated Arrhenius thermal stability studies and it was demonstrated that strips pre-coated with gliadin could be stored for approximately 2 years at 4 degrees C, with no discernable loss in sensitivity or detectability of the assay. Finally, the microfluorimeter was applied to the analysis of commercial gluten-free food samples, and an excellent correlation with routine ELISA measurements was obtained. The developed microfluorimeter should find widespread application for on-site execution of fluoroimmunoassays.},

   abstract = {Celiac disease is diagnosed in children as well as adults. For long now, this has not been a rare diagnosis. Publications by local authors have warned, as early as 1990s, that this disease is extremely under-diagnosed, as confirmed by current clinical practice. Despite this, it is evident that the prevalence ofthis disease in Slovakia and the Czech Republic is high. Currently, it is assumed that the traditional symptomatic form of the disease represents just a fraction of the overall prevalence. As a consequence to the gradual introduction of the disease screening and the efforts of the medical community to diagnose the disease in its early stages, the disease is now thought of in a surgery of a first-contact physician as well as in a specialist surgery. Continually increasing number of diagnosed patients leads to increasing demands related to their needs. Strict gluten-free diet is the only available causal therapy. Gluten-free products are marked with a universally recognised international symbol--crossed-out grain spike--or are labelled "gluten-free". Some specialized family-run businesses focusing on their production have all foodstuffs labelled. However, this labelling is rather lacking on the products sold in high street stores. Based on the increasing incidence of celiac disease in the population, or rather improved diagnostic methods and increased awareness within the medical community of this diagnosis, the authors review the possibility of labelling all food products. This would be a universally recognised symbol, or a clear warning that the product contains gluten. It is recommended that a proposal is submitted to improve legislation related to labelling of gluten-containing products. It is recommended that the products labelled as "gluten-free" contain no gluten. It is proposed that the production of gluten-free food products is submitted to accreditation with well-defined methodology including strict control.},

   abstract = {AIMS/HYPOTHESIS: Coeliac disease is common in type 1 diabetes. It is managed with a gluten-free diet, characterised by foods low in AGEs. We hypothesised that this diet would lead to lower plasma AGEs and be associated with reduced albuminuria. METHODS: From a single paediatric clinic, we recruited 21 children with type 1 diabetes and biopsy-proven coeliac disease, and 38 individuals with diabetes alone. The groups were matched for age, sex, duration of disease and metabolic control. Participants completed a detailed clinical and dietary history. Blood samples were taken for HbA(1c), coeliac serology, thyroid function, serum IgA levels and plasma AGEs, and urine samples were obtained for estimation of the albumin/creatinine ratio (ACR). RESULTS: All the individuals with coeliac disease were asymptomatic, with negative transglutaminase antibodies. There were no significant differences between the groups in terms of age (14 years), sex (29% male), duration of diabetes (7 years), mean HbA(1c) (8.3%), lipid levels or treatment regimens. However, children with diabetes and coeliac disease had twofold lower levels of urinary ACR than with those diabetes alone (p = 0.04). This was associated with lower levels of circulating AGEs (p = 0.03). These associations were independent of metabolic control, diabetes management and other potentially confounding variables, such as household exposure to cigarette smoke. CONCLUSIONS/INTERPRETATION: Adherence to a gluten-free diet may provide additional benefits for individuals with coeliac disease, and potentially those with type 1 diabetes.},

   abstract = {Mass spectrometry has arguably become the core technology for the characterization of food proteins and peptides. The application of mass spectrometry-based techniques for the qualitative and quantitative analysis of the complex protein mixtures contained in most food preparations is playing a decisive role in the understanding of their nature, structure, functional properties and impact on human health. The application of mass spectrometry to protein analysis has been revolutionized in the recent years by the development of soft ionization techniques such as electrospray ionization and matrix assisted laser desorption/ionization, and by the introduction of multi-stage and 'hybrid' analyzers able to generate de novo amino acid sequence information. The interfacing of mass spectrometry with protein databases has resulted in entirely new possibilities of protein characterization, including the high sensitivity mapping (femtomole to attomole levels) of post-translational and other chemical modifications, protein conformations and protein-protein and protein-ligand interactions, and in general for proteomic studies, building up the core platform of modern proteomic science. MS-based strategies to food and nutrition proteomics are now capable to address a wide range of analytical questions which include issues related to food quality and safety, certification and traceability of (typical) products, and to the definition of the structure/function relationship of food proteins and peptides. These different aspects are necessarily interconnected and can be effectively understood and elucidated only by use of integrated, up-to-date analytical approaches. In this review, the main aspects of current and perspective applications of mass spectrometry and proteomic technologies to the structural characterization of food proteins are presented, with focus on issues related to their detection, identification, and quantification, relevant for their biochemical, technological and toxicological aspects.},

   abstract = {Mycotoxins are fungal metabolites able to affect the functions of numerous tissues and organs in animals and humans, including intestinal and immune systems. However, the potential link between exposure to some mycotoxins and human chronic intestinal inflammatory diseases, such as celiac and Crohn's diseases or ulcerative colitis, has not been investigated. Instead, several theories based on bacterial, immunological or neurological events have been elaborated to explain the etiology of these pathologies. Here we reviewed the literature on mycotoxin-induced intestinal dysfunctions and compared these perturbations to the impairments of intestinal functions typically observed in human chronic intestinal inflammatory diseases. Converging evidence based on various cellular and animal studies show that several mycotoxins induce intestinal alterations that are similar to those observed at the onset and during the progression of inflammatory bowel diseases. Although epidemiologic evidence is still required, existing data are sufficient to suspect a role of some food-associated mycotoxins in the induction and/or persistence of human chronic intestinal inflammatory diseases in genetically predisposed patients.},

   abstract = {Nutrition studies have provided unambiguous evidence that a number of human health maladies including chronic coronary artery, hypertension, diabetes, osteoporosis, cancer and age- and lifestyle-related diseases are associated with the diet. Several favorable and a few deleterious natural dietary ingredients have been identified that predispose human populations to various genetic and epigenetic based disorders. Media dissemination of this information has greatly raised public awareness of the beneficial effects due to increased consumption of fruit, vegetables and whole grain cereals-foods rich in phytonutrients, protein and fiber. However, the presence of intrinsically low levels of the beneficial phytonutrients in the available genotypes of crop plants is not always at par with the recommended daily allowance (RDA) for different phytonutrients (nutraceuticals). Molecular engineering of crop plants has offered a number of tools to markedly enhance intracellular concentrations of some of the beneficial nutrients, levels that, in some cases, are closer to the RDA threshold. This review brings together literature on various strategies utilized for bioengineering both major and minor crops to increase the levels of desirable phytonutrients while also decreasing the concentrations of deleterious metabolites. Some of these include increases in: protein level in potato; lysine in corn and rice; methionine in alfalfa; carotenoids (beta-carotene, phytoene, lycopene, zeaxanthin and lutein) in rice, potato, canola, tomato; choline in tomato; folates in rice, corn, tomato and lettuce; vitamin C in corn and lettuce; polyphenolics such as flavonol, isoflavone, resveratrol, chlorogenic acid and other flavonoids in tomato; anthocyanin levels in tomato and potato; alpha-tocopherol in soybean, oil seed, lettuce and potato; iron and zinc in transgenic rice. Also, molecular engineering has succeeded in considerably reducing the levels of the offending protein glutelin in rice, offering proof of concept and a new beginning for the development of super-low glutelin cereals for celiac disease patients.},

The prevalence of lactose intolerance, fructose malabsorption and celiac sprue is quite high. If the symptoms are interpreted in the right way, the diagnosis and the treatment are easy. The ingestion of lactose or fructose containing food leads only to unpleasant symptoms, but in gluten sensitive patients an inflammation and destruction of the small intestinal mucosa develops. The consequences are an impaired absorption of macro- and micronutrients with their specific symptoms. The patients with lactose intolerance and fructose malabsorption can avoid the symptoms if they stick to a low lactose or fructose containing diet. On the other hand, patients with celiac sprue need a life-long gluten-free diet to heal the mucosa, to ameliorate the symptoms and to avoid relapses.},

Here we summarize how HLA-DQ2/8 molecules, the main genetic risk factor for this disease can orchestrate a CD4(+) T-cell adaptive immune response against gluten, and discuss recent data which shed light on the innate and adaptive immune stimuli that collaborate to induce a proinflammatory TH1 response, a massive expansion of intraepithelial lymphocytes, and a cytolytic attack of the epithelium. The intestinal immune response driven in genetically predisposed patients by chronic exposure to gluten emerges as the pathological counterpart of normal acute intestinal responses to intracellular pathogens.},

The effects of the presence of hydrocolloids and the substitution of the flour basis by flour or proteins from different sources were studied. The added ingredients were (1) hydrocolloids (carboxymethylcellulose [CMC], guar gum, hydroxypropylmethylcellulose [HPMC], and xanthan gum), and (2) substitutes (buckwheat flour, whole egg powder, and whey proteins). The bread quality parameters measured were specific volume, dry matter of bread, crust color, crumb hardness, and gas cell size distribution. Specific volume was increased by guar gum and HPMC. Breads with guar gum had color characteristics similar to French bread. Hardness decreased with the addition of hydrocolloids, especially HPMC and guar. Breads with guar gum had the most heterogeneous cell size distribution, and guar gum was therefore selected for further formulations. Bread prepared with buckwheat flour had improved quality: an increased specific volume, a softer texture, color characteristics, and gas-cell size distribution similar to French bread. Bread with 1.9% guar gum (w/w, total flour basis) and 5% buckwheat flour (of all flours and substitutes) mimicked French bread quality attributes.},

   abstract = {AIMS: This work aimed at using a pool of selected enterococci and fungal proteases to hydrolyse wheat gluten during long-time fermentation. METHODS AND RESULTS: A liquid dough made with wheat flour (20% w/w) was fermented with three Enterococcus strains (dough A) or with the combination of enterococci and Rhizopus oryzae proteases (dough B). After 48 h of fermentation, dough A and B had a concentration of water-soluble peptides approximately threefold higher than the chemically acidified dough (CAD), used as the control. The same was found for the concentration of free amino acids, being higher in dough B with respect to dough A. SDS-PAGE analysis showed that albumin and glutenin fractions were partially hydrolysed, while gliadins almost disappeared in dough A and B, as confirmed by two-dimensional electrophoresis, RP-HPLC and R5-ELISA analyses. CONCLUSIONS: The combined use of enterococci and fungal proteases showed a decrease of the gluten concentration of more than 98% during long-time fermentation. SIGNIFICANCE AND IMPACT OF THE STUDY: The use of the mixture of selected enterococci and R. oryzae proteases should be considered as a potential tool to decrease gluten concentration in foods.},

   abstract = {Celiac disease is caused by an uncontrolled immune response to gluten, a heterogeneous mixture of wheat storage proteins, including the alpha-gliadins. It has been shown that alpha-gliadins harbor several major epitopes involved in the disease pathogenesis. A major step towards elimination of gluten toxicity for celiac disease patients would thus be the elimination of such epitopes from alpha-gliadins. We have analyzed over 3,000 expressed alpha-gliadin sequences from 11 bread wheat cultivars to determine whether they encode for peptides potentially involved in celiac disease. All identified epitope variants were synthesized as peptides and tested for binding to the disease-associated HLA-DQ2 and HLA-DQ8 molecules and for recognition by patient-derived alpha-gliadin specific T cell clones. Several specific naturally occurring amino acid substitutions were identified for each of the alpha-gliadin derived peptides involved in celiac disease that eliminate the antigenic properties of the epitope variants. Finally, we provide proof of principle at the peptide level that through the systematic introduction of such naturally occurring variations alpha-gliadins genes can be generated that no longer encode antigenic peptides. This forms a crucial step in the development of strategies to modify gluten genes in wheat so that it becomes safe for celiac disease patients. It also provides the information to design and introduce safe gluten genes in other cereals, which would exhibit improved quality while remaining safe for consumption by celiac disease patients.},

   abstract = {The increasing demand for high quality gluten-free (GF) bread, clean labels and natural products is raising the need for new approaches in GF bread-making. Sourdough is the foremost fermentation used for baking purposes and it has been proven to be ideal for improving the texture, palatability, aroma, shelf life and nutritional value of wheat and rye breads. These characteristic features derive from the complex metabolic activities of the sourdough-resident lactic acid bacteria and yeasts, e.g. acidification, production of exopolysaccharides, proteolytic- amylolytic- and phytase activity, and production of antimicrobial substances. These effects have been extensively studied and well described for traditional baking, whereas little is known about the role of sourdough in GF baking. Yet, the microbiological and qualitative characterisation of local GF fermented products indicate an overlap with the microbiota of wheat/rye fermentation and suggest that the positive metabolic activities of the sourdough microbiota are still retained during fermentation of GF crops. Thus, the use of sourdough in GF baking may be the new frontier for improving the quality, safety and acceptability of GF bread.},

   abstract = {OBJECTIVE: Verbal apraxia is a neurologically based motor planning speech disorder of unknown etiology common in autism spectrum disorders. Vitamin E deficiency causes symptoms that overlap those of verbal apraxia. Polyunsaturated fatty acids in the cell membrane are vulnerable to lipid peroxidation and early destruction if vitamin E is not readily available, potentially leading to neurological sequelae. Inflammation of the gastrointestinal (GI) tract and malabsorption of nutrients such as vitamin E and carnitine may contribute to neurological abnormalities. The goal of this investigation was to characterize symptoms and metabolic anomalies of a subset of children with verbal apraxia who may respond to nutritional interventions. DESIGN AND PATIENTS: A total of 187 children with verbal apraxia received vitamin E + polyunsaturated fatty acid supplementation. A celiac panel, fat-soluble vitamin test, and carnitine level were obtained in patients having blood analyzed. RESULTS: A common clinical phenotype of male predominance, autism, sensory issues, low muscle tone, coordination difficulties, food allergy, and GI symptoms emerged. In all, 181 families (97%) reported dramatic improvements in a number of areas including speech, imitation, coordination, eye contact, behavior, sensory issues, and development of pain sensation. Plasma vitamin E levels varied in children tested; however, pretreatment levels did not reflect clinical response. Low carnitine (20/26), high antigliadin antibodies (15/21), gluten-sensitivity HLA alleles (10/10), and zinc (2/2) and vitamin D deficiencies (4/7) were common abnormalities. Fat malabsorption was identified in 8 of 11 boys screened. CONCLUSION: We characterize a novel apraxia phenotype that responds to polyunsaturated fatty acids and vitamin E. The association of carnitine deficiency, gluten sensitivity/food allergy, and fat malabsorption with the apraxia phenotype suggests that a comprehensive metabolic workup is warranted. Appropriate screening may identify a subgroup of children with a previously unrecognized syndrome of allergy, apraxia, and malabsorption who are responsive to nutritional interventions in addition to traditional speech and occupational therapy. Controlled trials in apraxia and autism spectrum disorders are warranted.},

   abstract = {Coeliac disease is an autoimmune disorder of the small bowel that occurs in genetically predisposed people of all ages from middle infancy. Most common period of presentation is between six month and two years of age. Coeliac disease is caused by a reaction to gliadin, a gluten protein found in wheat. Upon exposure to gliadin, the enzyme tissue transglutaminase modifies the protein and the immune system cross reacts with the bowel tissue, causing an inflammatory reaction that leads to flattening of the lining of the small intestine, which interferes with the absorption of nutrient's. Here we describe the case of Ibrahim age 12 years was admitted in BSMMU on 9th February 2008. He had loose mucoid stool, abdominal distension, bloating and history of loss of weight for two years. He was malnourished moderately pale with clubbing. His weight and height was far below the standard for the age. Along with the routine examinations foecal fat estimation, MT, USG of whole abdomen, Barium follow through, endoscopic biopsy and tissue transglutaminage IgA autoantibody was done. Histopathological report was in favour of immunoproliferative small intestinal disease. Tissue transglutaminage IgA autoantibody was in higher level though done in a gluten free state. Wheat and food made by wheat was totally withdrawn then gradually the patient improved. Symptoms of diarrhoea, abdominal distention and bloatedness gradually decreased. For patients presenting with alteration of bowel habit, abdominal distension, bloating and history of weight loss for long time, the importance of considering coeliac diseases as a differential diagnosis cannot be overemphasized.},

   abstract = {Breast milk is the initial natural food for infants, but already during the second half year complementary feeding is essential. Epidemiological research, first on celiac disease and later on atopic diseases, has driven a paradigm shift with respect to most favorable age to introduce complementary feeding. Simplified, this implies a shift from later to earlier introduction, which is now taken into account in recommendations on infant feeding. Complementary feeding, including all foods, should not be initiated for any infant before 4 months of age, and not later than around 6 months, including infants with elevated disease risk (e.g. for celiac disease or atopic diseases). Motivating reasons could be that ongoing breastfeeding provides an 'immunological umbrella' and/ or a different age interval gives a 'window of opportunity' for developing oral tolerance towards gluten and other food antigens. This will for some infants be in conflict with recent WHO recommendations on exclusive breastfeeding for 6 months. Epidemiology has evolved over time and could, if increasingly used, contribute even more to innovations in pediatric nutrition and other phenomena related to population health.},

   abstract = {BACKGROUND: Coeliac disease (CD), or permanent gluten intolerance, is one of the most common chronic food-related diseases among children in Europe and the USA. The treatment is lifelong gluten-free diet (GFD) (i.e. the exclusion of wheat, rye and barley from the diet, which are important sources particularly of iron, dietary fibre and vitamin B). The present study aimed to evaluate dietary intakes of energy and nutrients in children and adolescents on GFD and compare these with intake of comparable age groups on a normal diet as well as current recommendations. METHODS: Thirty children, 4-17 years of age with confirmed CD and on GFD were agreed to participate in this study at the Department of Pediatrics, Umea University Hospital. Weight and height were used to calculate individual energy requirement according to Nordic Nutrition Recommendations 2004 (NNR-04). Dietary intake was assessed using 5-day food records and household measures were used for quantities. Twenty-five children completed their dietary record. RESULTS: Thirteen of the 25 children did not meet the recommended energy intake and the dietary intakes were inadequate regarding quality of macronutrients and quantity of minerals and vitamins. The mean intakes of sucrose and saturated fatty acids were above and the intakes of dietary fibre, vitamin D, magnesium and selenium below the NNR-04. High intakes of sucrose and saturated fat and a low intake of dietary fibre were also noted in a previous national survey on healthy children on a normal diet. The nutrient density of vitamin D, riboflavin, niacin, thiamine, magnesium and selenium were lower among CD children than healthy children but, for iron and calcium, it was higher in CD children. CONCLUSIONS: Children on GFD appear to follow the same trends as healthy children on a normal diet, with high intakes of saturated fat and sucrose and low intakes of dietary fibre, vitamin D and magnesium compared to recommendations.},

   abstract = {For adolescents with celiac disease (CD), a gluten-free diet (GFD) is crucial for health, but compliance is problematic and noncompliance is common even among those aware of the risks. To better understand their lives with the disease, Swedish CD adolescents were invited to take part in focus group discussions. Data were analyzed for recurrent stigma-related themes across the groups. Adolescents described an awareness of being different from others that was produced by meal appearance and the poor availability of gluten-free food. The GFD often required discussions and special requests, so eating in public had the effect of making an invisible condition visible, and thereby creating a context for felt or enacted stigma. Maintaining invisibility avoided negative consequences of stigma, and other strategies were used to reduce the costs of visibility. The results of the study show that the GFD can produce stigma experiences in adolescence, and that dietary compliance (or lack thereof) can be understood in terms of dealing with GFD concealment and disclosure.},

METHODS: Prospective nationwide Swedish incidence register of CD in children 0-15 years of age, with the present analysis covering the period from 1998 to 2003. ESPGHAN diagnostic criteria for CD were used. Regions were classified according to the Nomenclature of Territorial Units for Statistics. The incidence rate for each region, gender, age group and year of diagnosis was calculated. RESULTS: A regional variation in CD risk was demonstrated. The childhood populations in 'West Sweden' and 'Smaland and the islands', situated in the southern part of the country, had a significantly higher incidence rate compared to in 'North Middle Sweden' and 'Stockholm', situated in the central part. This regional variation was not explained by variations in risk by gender, age at diagnosis or year of diagnosis. CONCLUSION: The Swedish regional variation in CD risk supports multifactorial disease aetiology. Continued efforts are warranted to define factors, besides gluten exposure, that modulate CD risk.},

   abstract = {Buckwheat is a pseudocereal (an eudicot with seed qualities and uses similar to those of monocot cereals, family Poaceae) that is consumed in some Asian countries as a staple, and in some western countries as a health food. Allergic reactions to buckwheat are common in some countries. The objective was to develop a specific and sensitive sandwich enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay (ELISA) to detect traces of buckwheat that might inadvertently contaminate other foods in order to assure accurate labeling and consumer protection. Buckwheat-specific antibodies produced in 3 species of animals were tested for specificity and titer by direct ELISA and immunoblot. A sandwich ELISA was developed utilizing pooled rabbit antibuckwheat sera to capture buckwheat proteins and pooled goat antibuckwheat sera, followed by enzyme-labeled rabbit antigoat immunoglobulin G (IgG), to detect bound buckwheat proteins. The lower limit of quantification (LOQ) of the sandwich ELISA was 2 parts per million (ppm) of buckwheat in the presence of complex food matrices. The ELISA is highly specific with no cross-reactivity to any of 80 food ingredients and matrices tested. Validation studies conducted with buckwheat processed into noodles and muffins showed greater than 90% and 60% recovery, respectively. The percent recovery of buckwheat from noodles was similar to that achieved with a commercial buckwheat ELISA kit (ELISA Systems Pty. Ltd., Windsor, Queensland, Australia) at high buckwheat concentrations. However, the sensitivity of this ELISA was greater than the commercial ELISA. This newly developed ELISA is sufficiently specific and sensitive to detect buckwheat residues in processed foods to protect buckwheat-allergic subjects from potential harm. Practical Application: Buckwheat is becoming a common food ingredient in a number of processed foods due to potentially beneficial nutritional properties, without the celiac disease inducing glutenin proteins of wheat and related cereals. However, buckwheat causes allergy in some individuals and must be labeled and tested accurately to protect those with allergy to buckwheat. We describe the development of a new test assay to help food producers ensure that buckwheat is not present in foods that are not intended to contain buckwheat.},

   abstract = {The global prevalence of celiac disease is of one person per 250 inhabitants. The disease is induced by gluten, a peptide contained in wheat, rye and barley that during small intestinal digestion generates smaller peptides. Some of these are resistant to hydrolysis and cross through the epithelium into the mucosa, inducing a cascade of immune reactions leading to the appearance of the disease in susceptible individuals. Gluten appeared as a consequence of agricultural practices initiated 10000 years ago in the Fertile Crescent of southwest Asia. Celiac disease epidemiology is complicated since consumption of gluten differs depending on the origin of populations. Treatment of celiac disease consists of withdrawing gluten from the diet, a task that becomes difficult in the long term. The concept of gluten-free food has changed along time. This article updates the concept of celiac disease, the history of gluten consumption in the world, the characteristics of a gluten free diet and the difficulties to adhere to it.},

   abstract = {In 1958, A. M. Ugolev (1926-1991) discovered parietal (membrane) digestion (MD) that differs fundamentally from cavity and intracellular digestion in the strictly directed arrangement of active centers of enzymes and in coupling to the membrane transport systems. The three-stage sequential triad: cavity digestion--MD--absorption has given an insight into the mechanism responsible for an extremely high food assimilation rate in the gastrointestinal tract and become as the basis of the current digestion theory stated by Academician A. M. Ugolev. Membrane maldigestion results from atrophic changes in the small bowel mucosa in gluten-sensitivity celiac disease, enteric infections, excessive small intestinal microflora growth, and intestinal damages induced by nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drugs, some antibiotics, and antimetabolites. Clinically, it presents with poor tolerability of nutrients containing oligomers, whose digestion is impaired, and with malabsorption symptoms. Indirect (load) and direct (perfusion) tests, as well as biochemical and histological studies of the activity of membrane enzymes are proposed for the diagnosis of membrane maldigestion. The detection and elimination of agents that damage the intestinal mucosa (gluten, lactose, pathogenic microflora, and pharmacologicals) form the basis for the etiotropic treatment of patients with impaired MD. A. M. Ugolev's discovery has led not only to the major general biological generalization--the current theory of digestion, but also to the revision of the pathogenesis, clinical signs, and treatment of diseases accompanied by enteric food malassimilation.},

A linear discriminant model, based on the signals of 11 polymeric membranes, selected from the 36 above using a stepwise procedure, was used to semi-quantitatively classify samples of a "Gluten-free" foodstuff (baby milked flour), previously contaminated with known amounts of gliadins (<10, 20-50 or >50mg/kg), as "Gluten-free", "Low-Gluten content" or "Gluten-containing". For this food matrix, the device had sensitivity towards gliadins of 1-2mg/kg and overall sensitivity and specificity of 77% and 78%, respectively. Moreover, the device never identified an ethanolic extract containing gliadins as "Gluten-free". Finally, the system also allowed distinguishing "Gluten-free" and "Gluten-containing" foodstuffs (15 foods, including breads, flours, baby milked flours, cookies and breakfast cereals) with an overall sensitivity and specificity greater than 83%, using the signals of only 4 selected polymeric membranes (selected using a stepwise procedure). Since only one "Gluten-containing" foodstuff was misclassified as "Gluten-free", the device could be used as a preliminary tool for quality control of foods for celiac patients.},

AIM: To evaluate the accuracy of the (13)C-octanoic acid breath test using a new standardized ready-to-eat, gluten-, glucose-, and lactose-free muffin. METHODS: Healthy subjects were recruited and sorted by sex and age. Patients with diabetic gastroparesis and untreated celiac disease with known gastric motility disorders were also tested with the new labelled muffin. Expired breath (13)CO(2) was analysed and t(1/2) was calculated. RESULTS: Overall, 131 healthy subjects were enrolled. The reference range of t(1/2) was 88+/-29min with the value of 146min as the upper limit of normal range. No significant difference in t(1/2) was found among subjects sorted by sex or age. The within-subject variability of t(1/2) was 17%. Mean (+/-standard deviation) t(1/2) values were 179+/-50min in patients with diabetic gastroparesis (n=8) and 151+/-20min in those with untreated celiac disease (n=11) (p<or=0.001 vs controls). CONCLUSIONS: A new standardized test meal simplifies the execution of the (13)C-octanoic acid breath test, is not influenced by sex or age, has low intra-individual variability, is palatable, does not cause side effects, and is able to evaluate gastric emptying in both patients and healthy controls. Moreover, it can be used in subjects with lactose intolerance, diabetes, and celiac disease.},

   abstract = {On contact with the skin, nickel may cause allergic contact dermatitis, which can be diagnosed by an epicutaneous patch test. Nickel exposure via the intestinal mucosa can induce diarrhea, abdominal pain, and swelling. The aim of the present study was to investigate the relationship between these symptoms and nickel intake by means of a novel oral mucosa patch test. Eighty-six patients with intestinal symptoms related to ingestion of nickel-containing foods were submitted to epicutaneous and oral mucosa patch tests for nickel. All patients with positive oral mucosa patch test results were subject to a low-nickel diet and monitored over time. Skin lesions were observed in 33 out of 86 (38.4%) patients evaluated by the epicutaneous patch test. Mucosal lesions were seen in 53 out of 86 (61.6%) patients given the oral mucosa patch test. After 2 months of a low-nickel diet, 52 out of 53 (98.1%) patients showed an improvement of their symptoms. There is a significant correlation between response time of the oral mucosa patch test and the latency of symptoms after ingestion of nickel-containing foods. Consequently, the oral mucosa patch test can be used to recognize and study the adverse effects of dietary nickel exposure that could be defined as allergic contact mucositis. A low-nickel diet is also shown to be an effective treatment for this condition.},

   abstract = {Increasing prevalence, protean clinical manifestations, and lack of pharmacological therapy make celiac disease (CD) a complex and highly relevant illness in gastroenterology. This chronic inflammatory disorder of the small intestine is caused by the ingestion of gluten containing cereals in genetically susceptible individuals, leading to a variety of gastrointestinal (GI) and non-GI manifestations. Awareness among physicians is growing due to accessible and highly accurate diagnostic and screening methods. Recent evidence suggests a possible rising incidence of CD. Environmental factors such as early life gluten exposure, intestinal infections, short duration of breast-feeding, and changes in intestinal microbiota have been proposed to have a role in CD pathogenesis. Thus, prevention approaches to diminish the rising prevalence of CD are currently being evaluated. Still, the cornerstone treatment of CD remains a strict gluten-free diet. This nutritional regime is demanding, and non-adherence is common because of social isolation, financial issues, or restriction of food diversity. Allowing patients to occasionally consume small amounts of gluten would greatly improve their quality of life. Owing to recent advances in the understanding of the pathogenesis of CD, different targets have been identified and have motivated the development of several experimental therapeutic strategies. The main goal of this review is to discuss the mechanisms that can be exploited therapeutically to prevent or delay CD, disease associations and its complications. Current treatments for complications of CD, including refractory CD and malignancy, are beyond the scope of this review.},

   abstract = {CONTEXT: Eosinophilic cystitis (EC) is an inflammatory condition of the bladder that has been linked to food allergens, infectious agents, drugs, and other genitourinary conditions. Like interstitial cystitis, EC has a strong female predominance. It is characterized by an intense eosinophilic infiltrate in the acute phase and fibrosis in the chronic phase. OBJECTIVES: To document and focus on specific features of EC in males and highlight the relationship between clinical and histopathologic findings. DESIGN: The bladder biopsies of male patients were reviewed. Eight cases of EC were selected. RESULTS: Several known associations were noted as well as unreported features and associations such as Charcot-Leyden crystals, celiac disease, lupus anticoagulant, and additional viral and bacterial agents. CONCLUSIONS: Eosinophilic cystitis represents a response to a variety of agents and may often be overlooked. The temporally biphasic morphologic features are the hallmark of this condition. Because clinical and imaging studies are not specific, a high index of clinical suspicion is often crucial to the correct diagnosis and proper management of EC.},

   abstract = {Use of sourdough is of expanding interest for improvement of flavour, structure and stability of baked goods. Cereal fermentations also show significant potential in improvement and design of the nutritional quality and health effects of foods and ingredients. In addition to improving the sensory quality of whole grain, fibre-rich or gluten-free products, sourdough can also actively retard starch digestibility leading to low glycemic responses, modulate levels and bioaccessibility of bioactive compounds, and improve mineral bioavailability. Cereal fermentation may produce non-digestible polysaccharides, or modify accessibility of the grain fibre complex to gut microbiota. It has also been suggested that degradation of gluten may render bread better suitable for celiac persons. The changes in cereal matrix potentially leading to improved nutritional quality are numerous. They include acid production, suggested to retard starch digestibility, and to adjust pH to a range which favours the action of certain endogenous enzymes, thus changing the bioavailability pattern of minerals and phytochemicals. This is especially beneficial in products rich in bran to deliver minerals and potentially protective compounds in the blood circulation. The action of enzymes during fermentation also causes hydrolysis and solubilisation of grain macromolecules, such as proteins and cell wall polysaccharides. This changes product texture, which may affect nutrient and non-nutrient absorption. New bioactive compounds, such as prebiotic oligosaccharides or other metabolites, may also be formed in cereal fermentations.},

   abstract = {Celiac disease is an immune-mediated disease, triggered in genetically susceptible individuals by ingested gluten from wheat, rye, barley, and other closely related cereal grains. The only treatment for celiac disease is a strict gluten-free diet for life. This paper presents a systematic review of the scientific literature on the safety of pure oats for individuals with celiac disease, which historically has been subject to debate. Limitations identified within the scientific database include: limited data on long-term consumption, limited numbers of participants in challenge studies, and limited reporting about the reasons for withdrawals from study protocols. Furthermore, some evidence suggests that a small number of individuals with celiac disease may be intolerant to pure oats and some evidence from in vitro studies suggests that an immunological response to oat avenins can occur in the absence of clinical manifestations of celiac disease as well as suggesting that oat cultivars vary in toxicity. Based on the majority of the evidence provided in the scientific database, and despite the limitations, Health Canada and the Canadian Celiac Association (CCA) concluded that the majority of people with celiac disease can tolerate moderate amounts of pure oats. The incorporation of oats into a gluten-free diet provides high fiber and vitamin B content, increased palatability, and beneficial effects on cardiovascular health. However, it is recommended that individuals with celiac disease should have both initial and long-term assessments by a health professional when introducing pure oats into a gluten-free diet.},

   abstract = {The excretion of hydrogen in breath commonly persists, despite an overnight fast. Although the elevation of hydrogen concentration above the fasting value after the administration of a test sugar is evidence of malabsorption, the level of the fasting value itself in untreated celiac patients is unknown. Therefore, we studied the fasting breath hydrogen (FBH(2)) concentration in 40 healthy controls, 35 subjects with functional bowel disorders, and 30 patients of untreated celiac disease with and without bread or wheat diet one day before the test. The fasting level of hydrogen concentration in untreated celiac patients (28.7 +/- 19.5 ppm) was significantly higher than those in healthy volunteers (9.5 +/- 3.4 ppm) and subjects with functional bowel disorders (10.6 +/- 4.5 ppm). The percentage of patients with elevated H(2) fasting levels in untreated celiac disease (82.5%) was significantly higher than that in healthy controls (10%) and subjects with functional bowel disorders (17.1%). In 30 celiac patients, studied with and without wheat-free diet one day before the test, the fasting hydrogen levels decreased from 28.7 +/- 19.5 ppm to 10.6 +/- 3.5 ppm, and becoming normal in all patients of celiac disease. Our results show that the patients of untreated celiac disease should be instructed not to eat things made up of wheat one day before hydrogen breath testing so that the normal fasting hydrogen concentration can be obtained and false-negative hydrogen breath test results can be avoided.},

METHODS: A total of 134 patients underwent plasma zinc estimation at baseline and after a four week period. Zinc-deficient patients were randomly assigned to two groups. Group G (n = 48) received GFD without zinc supplementation, Group G + Z (n = 48) received GFD with zinc supplementation for 4 weeks. RESULTS: The rise in plasma Zinc levels was significant in each group regardless of zinc supplementation but similar when compared in the two groups after 4 weeks. Mean zinc levels at baseline and increase in zinc levels were statistically similar at 4 weeks in patients with diarrhea and short stature. CONCLUSIONS: Zinc levels rise with GFD irrespective of zinc supplementation.},

   abstract = {DCs are specialized APCs that orchestrate innate and adaptive immune responses. The intestinal mucosa contains numerous DCs, which induce either protective immunity to infectious agents or tolerance to innocuous antigens, including food and commensal bacteria. Several subsets of mucosal DCs have been described that display unique functions, dictated in part by the local microenvironment. In this review, we summarize the distinct subtypes of DCs and their distribution in the gut; examine how DC dysfunction contributes to intestinal disease development, including inflammatory bowel disease and celiac disease; and discuss manipulation of DCs for therapy.},

   abstract = {Considering that sorghum is a gluten free flour, it could be proposed as an ingredient to produce alternative bakery products for the subjects with Celiac Disease, since they do not have many food options available in the market. For this reason, the main goal of this study is to develop chocolate cookies with sorghum flour (Sorghum vulgare). The experimental design used was the simplex-lattice factor to compare the following variables: sorghum flour (50-100%), rice flour (0-50%) and corn starch (0-50%), totaling up to ten experiments. The formulations IX and X were selected as the ones with the highest sensorial scores The sorghum flour, regular chocolate cookies and gluten free cookies were submitted to physicochemical analysis. Physical and sensorial analysis using Quantitative Descriptive Analysis (QDA) and hedonic analysis were performed for the two cookies preparation. Sorghum flour presented characteristics compared with the described by the food regulation laws. The preparations that presented satisfactory sensorial characteristics were the ones that had 58 and 67% of sorghum flour, 8 and 17% of rice flour, 33 and 17% of corn starch, respectively. The performance for both IX and X formulations was 0,92 and the specific volume was 1,54 and 1.46 cm3/g, respectively. When compared with regular cookies, the differences on most of the sensorial attributes evaluated on sorghum cookies were not statistically significant (P < 0.05), except for the color and the odour. All the sensorial scores reached values equal or higher than 7 for both samples and most of them scored 8. The results showed the feasibility of including sorghum flour on the manufacture of gluten free cookies.},

   abstract = {BACKGROUND: Coeliac disease (CD) is common and requires a permanent strict gluten-free diet (GFD). However, data concerning how the situation is experienced by children are limited. The present study aimed to investigate the compliance with a GFD and the impact of CD and GFD on the lifestyle of patients and their families, together with proposed recommendations for improvement of quality of life. METHODS: Children with biopsy confirmed CD were recruited consecutively from the outpatient gastroenterology clinic. Participants were evaluated by a special questionnaire for compliance with the GFD, patients' knowledge about CD, and the well-being and lifestyle of children and their families. Comparisons between discrete variables were performed by a chi-square test. RESULTS: Seventy-three children of median age 9.4 (interquartile range = 5-14.5) years were evaluated. Compliance to diet was reported by 58%. Reasons for noncompliance were: poor palatability (32%), dining outside home (17%), poor availability of products (11%), and asymptomatic disease diagnosed by screening (11%). The acceptance of the GFD was reported as good in 65%, whereas avoidance of travelling and restaurants was stated by 17% and 46% of families, respectively. Most families experienced difficulties detecting gluten from the food label. Proposed factors for improvement of quality of life were: better labelling of gluten-containing ingredients (76%) and more gluten-free (GF) foods in supermarkets (58%) and restaurants (42%). CONCLUSIONS: Children with CD have low compliance with the GFD. Better education about the disease, the availability of GF products, and appropriate food labelling could improve compliance and quality of life.},

   abstract = {OBJECTIVE: To determine celiac disease (CD) serology and rotavirus (RV) by polymerase reaction (PCR) in adults with non-specific gastrointestinal complaints. METHODS: The study comprised 5176 randomly selected individuals living in Tehran, Iran between September 2006 and September 2007. Six hundred and seventy individuals with GI symptoms were identified with a questionnaire and invited for a further study including stool sampling and blood tests. Stool samples were examined for detection of RV by amplification of specific gene (VP6) and by light microscopy and formalin-ether concentration methods for parasite detection. The subjects also tested for CD including anti-transglutaminase (tTG) antibodies and total immunoglobulin A (IgA). The study was carried out in the Research Center of Gastroentrology and Liver Disease, Taleghani Hospital, Tehran, Iran. RESULTS: The VP6 gene was detected in 150 (22.3%) individuals. Anti-tissue transglutaminase (tTG-IgA) was positive in 22 individuals (95% CI 2.3-5.1) and IgG-tTG antibody in 3 individuals who were IgA deficient. Amplification of VP6 gene was positive in 8/25 (32%) with positive CD serology and in 142/645 (22%) with negative CD serology. This difference was not statistically significant (p=0.2). CONCLUSION: This study shows that RV infection is common among Iranian patients with non-specific gastrointestinal symptoms. However, in contrast to studies in children, this study shows that the prevalence of active RV infection was not statistically significantly different between individuals who were tTG antibody positive and those who were tTG antibody negative.},

   abstract = {AIM: Orofacial granulomatosis (OFG) is a rare clinical entity with orofacial swelling in association with oral lesions such as mucosal oedema, ulcerations and mucosal tags. The aim of this prospective study was to evaluate the connection between OFG in childhood and systemic disease. METHODS: During a 3-year period, eight children (9-16 years old) who had been referred to the clinic of oral medicine were diagnosed solely with OFG. Thus, none of them had any known systemic disease or gastrointestinal symptoms at the time of referral. The children were then medically examined and followed up for 6-8 years at the department of paediatrics for systemic disease with specific emphasis on inflammatory disorders elsewhere in the gastrointestinal tract. RESULTS: During follow-up, four patients were diagnosed with Crohn's disease (CD). Further, one girl was found to have a food allergy-induced OFG, with delayed-type hypersensitivity to oats. One boy developed both diabetes and celiac disease during the follow-up. Only two patients had no diagnosis of systemic disease at the end of the observation period. CONCLUSION: OFG in childhood seems to be frequently related to systemic disease, and children with OFG should be referred to a paediatrician for examination and follow-up.},

   abstract = {The enrichment of gluten-free (GF) baked products with dietary fibre (DF) seems to be necessary since it has been reported that coeliac patients have generally a low intake of DF due to their GF diet. Response surface methodology was used to optimize a fibre-enriched GF bread formulation based on corn starch, rice flour and hydroxypropylmethyl cellulose. Maize fibre and water were the predictor variables (factors), and loaf specific volume, crumb firmness and crumb L value were the dependent variables (responses) used to assess the product quality. The optimal formulation, determined from the data, contained 6.5% maize fibre and 102.5% water, starch/flour base. The developed mathematical models for the measured responses could be successfully used for their prediction during baking. Shelf-life study of the optimized formulation revealed that bread stored under modified atmosphere packaging exhibited lower crumb firmness and moisture content values, and thus remained softer through storage. Scanning electron microscopy of the crumb showed a continuum matrix between starch and maize fibre, in the optimized formulation, obtaining a more aerated structure.},

She also had angular cheilitis, glossitis, conjunctivitis and diffuse alopecia. After treatment with a high-protein gluten-free diet and supplementation with vitamins and microelements there was a rapid improvement in the skin lesions. The severity of the skin lesions in this case can be explained by the coexistence of two metabolic diseases causing complex malnutrition.},

Celiac disease (CD) is an enteropathy caused by an aberrant immune response to cereal gluten proteins and the only therapy is the adherence to a gluten-free diet (GFD). In this context, a preliminary study was conducted to establish whether the GFD in itself could modify the composition and immune properties of the gut microbiota. The trial included 10 healthy subjects (30.3 years-old), which were submitted to a GFD over one month. Analysis of fecal microbiota and dietary intake indicated that numbers of healthy gut bacteria decreased, while numbers of unhealthy bacteria increased parallel to reductions in the intake of polysaccharides after following the GFD. Fecal samples of subjects under a GFD, which represent an altered microbiota, also exerted lower immune stimulatory effects on peripheral blood mononuclear cells than those of subjects on a regular gluten-containing diet. This addendum presents further discussion on the rationale behind these findings, limitations of the study and possible consequences of dietary counselling in the care process of celiac disease patients.},

Subjects affected by CD cannot tolerate gluten protein, a mixture of storage proteins contained in several cereals (wheat, rye, barley and derivatives). Gluten free-diet remains the cornerstone treatment for celiac patients. Therefore the absence of gluten in natural and processed foods represents a key aspect of food safety of the gluten-free diet. A promising area is the use of minor or pseudo-cereals such as amaranth, buckwheat, quinoa, sorghum and teff. The paper is focused on the new definition of gluten-free products in food label, the nutritional properties of the gluten-free cereals and their use to prevent nutritional deficiencies of celiac subjects.},

   abstract = {In the intestinal tract, only a single layer of epithelial cells separates innate and adaptive immune effector cells from a vast amount of antigens. Here, the immune system faces a considerable challenge in tolerating commensal flora and dietary antigens while preventing the dissemination of potential pathogens. Failure to tightly control immune reactions may result in detrimental inflammation. In this respect, 'conventional' regulatory CD4(+) T cells, including naturally occurring and adaptive CD4(+) CD25(+) Foxp3(+) T cells, Th3 and Tr1 cells, have recently been the focus of considerable attention. However, regulatory mechanisms in the intestinal mucosa are highly complex, including adaptations of nonhaematopoietic cells and innate immune cells as well as the presence of unconventional T cells with regulatory properties such as resident TCRgammadelta or TCRalphabeta CD8(+) intraepithelial lymphocytes. This review aims to summarize the currently available knowledge on conventional and unconventional regulatory T cell subsets (Tregs), with special emphasis on clinical data and the potential role or malfunctioning of Tregs in four major human gastrointestinal diseases, i.e. inflammatory bowel diseases, coeliac disease, food allergy and colorectal cancer. We conclude that the clinical data confirms some but not all of the findings derived from experimental animal models.},

   abstract = {PURPOSE OF REVIEW: To examine current evidence for dietary supplementation with zinc and other micronutrients for primary prevention of multiple micronutrient deficiencies that are known to result from therapies used in the treatment of gastrointestinal inflammatory disorders. RECENT FINDINGS: Epidemiological observations and clinical findings have strengthened the concept that both nutritional deficiencies and nutritional excesses impair the gastrointestinal response(s) and alter susceptibility to inflammation and other diseases. The interaction of micronutrient intake, biochemical indicators of nutritional status, and four specific gastrointestinal inflammation states are reviewed. These conditions include celiac disease and concomitant micronutrient deficiencies resulting from the sustained adherence to a gluten-free diet; micronutrient nutrition as an important determinant of immunity for two major types of inflammatory bowel disease: ulcerative colitis and Crohn's disease; and HIV/AIDS-related diarrhea and concomitant micronutrient deficiencies which may be exacerbated by the initiation of highly active antiretroviral therapy. SUMMARY: For each inflammation 'state', enhancement of micronutrient status can improve immunocompetance and minimize therapeutic side-effects. The impact of single-micronutrient deficiencies on immune responses, and the possible impact of uncorrected micronutrient status are discussed.},

   abstract = {A novel, specific and sensitive non-immunological liquid chromatography-mass spectrometry (LC-MS) based assay has been developed to detect and quantify trace levels of wheat gluten in food and consumer products. Detection and quantification of dietary gluten is important, because gluten is a principle trigger of a variety of immune diseases including food allergies and intolerances. One such disease, celiac sprue, can cause intestinal inflammation and enteropathy in patients who are exposed to dietary gluten. At present, immunochemistry is the leading analytical method for gluten detection in food. Consequently, enzyme-linked immunosorbent assays (ELISAs), such as the sandwich or competitive type assays, are the only commercially available methods to ensure that food and consumer products are accurately labeled as gluten-free. The availability of a comprehensive, fast and economic alternative to the immunological ELISA may also facilitate research towards the development of new drugs, therapies and food processing technologies to aid patients with gluten intolerances and for gluten-free labeling and certification purposes. LC-MS is an effective and efficient analytical technique for the study of cereal grain proteins and to quantify trace levels of targeted dietary gluten peptides in complex matrices. Initial efforts in this area afforded the unambiguous identification and structural characterization of six unique physiologically relevant wheat gluten peptides. This paper describes the development and optimization of an LC-MS/MS method that attempts to provide the best possible accuracy and sensitivity for the quantitative detection of trace levels of these six peptides in various food and consumer products. The overall performance of this method was evaluated using native cereal grains. Experimental results demonstrated that this method is capable of detecting and quantifying select target peptides in food over a range from 10pg/mg to 100ng/mg (corresponding to approximately 0.01-100ppm). Limits of detection (LOD) and quantification (LOQ) for the six target peptides were determined to range from 1 to 30pg/mg and 10-100pg/mg respectively. Reproducibility of the assay was demonstrated by evaluation of calibration data as well as data collected from the analysis of quality control standards over a period of four consecutive days. The average coefficient of determination (R(2)) for each peptide was consistently found to be >0.995 with residuals ranging from approximately 80% to 110%. Spike recovery data for each peptide in various matrices was evaluated at a concentration level near the approximate LOQ for each, as well as at higher concentration levels (30 and 60ng/mg). The average range of accuracy of detection for all peptides at the lower concentration level was determined to be 90% (+/-11), while accuracy at the 30 and 60ng/mg levels was 98% (+/-5%) and 98% (+/-3%), respectively. The usefulness and capabilities of this method are presented in a practical application to prospectively screen a variety of common commercially available (native and processed) gluten-containing and gluten-free foods and products.},

Owing to the increasing prevalence, prevention strategies, including encouragement of breastfeeding and introduction of small amounts of gluten whereas still on breastfeeding at fourth to sixth month of age, become more important than before. For avoiding complications of celiac disease, a strict gluten-free diet is essential. A lifelong gluten-free diet may bring about difficulties as avoiding gluten completely is problematic owing to the contamination with gluten of presumably gluten free foods. New therapeutic approaches include enzyme supplementation, correction of the intestinal barrier defect against gluten entry, blocking of gliadin presentation by human leukocyte antigen blockers and tissue transglutaminase inhibitors.},

Its success depends partly on its adaptability and high yield potential but also on the gluten protein fraction which confers the viscoelastic properties that allow dough to be processed into bread, pasta, noodles, and other food products. Wheat also contributes essential amino acids, minerals, and vitamins, and beneficial phytochemicals and dietary fibre components to the human diet, and these are particularly enriched in whole-grain products. However, wheat products are also known or suggested to be responsible for a number of adverse reactions in humans, including intolerances (notably coeliac disease) and allergies (respiratory and food). Current and future concerns include sustaining wheat production and quality with reduced inputs of agrochemicals and developing lines with enhanced quality for specific end-uses, notably for biofuels and human nutrition.},

   abstract = {Celiac disease (CD) is an increasingly diagnosed, permanent autoimmune enteropathy, triggered, in susceptible individuals, by the ingestion of gluten, the alcohol - soluble protein fraction of some cereals, such as wheat, rye and barley. The main protein of wheat gluten is called gliadin, the similar proteins of rye and barley are secalin and hordein, respectively. Approximately 96% of CD patients express the HLA molecule DQ2, while the remainder mostly express the less common haplotype DQ8, reflecting the pivotal role of these molecules in the pathogenesis of CD. Because of their aminoacid sequence and tri-dimensional structure, gluten peptides selectively bind to these HLA alleles present on the surface of antigen presenting cells and then they are presented to the T lymphocytes in intestinal mucosa, thus starting the inflammatory immune response. CD is defined by the characteristic histological changes of small bowel mucosa: villous atrophy, crypts hyperplasia and T cells infiltration of the lamina propria, along with the increase of the number of intra-epithelial lymphocytes. The withdrawal of the gluten- containing food from the diet determines a complete recovery of the intestinal mucosa, whereas the reintroduction causes a relapse of the disease. This review focuses on the description of gluten peptides that elicit the mucosal immune response via the activation of innate and adaptive immunity in CD. It also describes the antagonist gluten peptides, obtained by artificial modification of gluten T epitopes or naturally occurring in the alcohol protein fraction of a cultivar of durum wheat, able to immuno-modulate the pathogenic immune response of CD.},

   abstract = {AIMS: To determine whether Glo-3A, (formerly referred to as homologue of Glb1 or Glb1) antibodies are associated with islet autoimmunity (IA) in children at increased risk for type 1 diabetes (T1D) and to investigate their relation with environmental correlates of T1D. METHODS: We selected a sample from the Diabetes Autoimmunity Study in the Young (DAISY), a prospective study of children at increased risk for T1D. Cases were positive for insulin, glutamic acid decarboxylase (GAD), or insulinoma-associated antigen-2 (IA-2) autoantibodies on two consecutive visits and either diagnosed with diabetes mellitus or still autoantibody positive when selected. Controls were from the same increased risk group, of similar age as the cases but negative for autoantibodies. Sera from 91 IA cases and 82 controls were analyzed in a blinded manner for immunoglobulin G (IgG) antibodies to Glo-3A by ELISA. RESULTS: Adjusting for family history of T1D and human leukocyte antigen (HLA)-DR4 positivity, Glo-3A antibodies were not associated with IA case status (OR: 1.01, 95% CI: 0.99-1.03). Adjusting for age, family history of T1D, and HLA-DR4 positivity, Glo-3A antibody levels were inversely associated with breast-feeding duration (beta = -0.08, p = 0.001) and directly associated with current intake of foods containing gluten (beta = 0.24, p = 0.007) in IA cases but not in controls. Zonulin, a biomarker of gut permeability, was directly associated with Glo-3A antibody levels in cases (beta = 0.73, p = 0.003) but not in controls. CONCLUSION: Differing correlates of Glo-3A antibodies in IA cases and controls suggest an underlying difference in mucosal immune response.},

   abstract = {BACKGROUND: Coeliac disease is more frequent in IgA nephropathy (IgAN) patients compared to the healthy population. Several hypotheses postulate that food antigens like gluten may be involved in the onset of IgAN. METHODS: In this study, we used a recently developed mucosal patch technique to evaluate the rectal mucosal inflammatory reaction to gluten in patients with IgAN (n = 27) compared to healthy subjects (n = 18). The rectal mucosal production of nitric oxide (NO) and release of myeloperoxidase (MPO) and eosinophil cationic protein (ECP) were measured. Serum samples were analysed for IgA and IgG antigliadin antibodies (AGA), IgA antibodies against tissue transglutaminase and IgA endomysium antibodies. RESULTS: Gluten reactivity, defined as increase in MPO and/or NO after gluten exposure, was observed in 8 of 27 IgAN patients. The prevalence of HLA-DQ2 and DQ8 was not increased among gluten-sensitive patients, and the total prevalence among IgAN patients was the same as for the normal population. An elevated serum IgA AGA response was seen in 9 of 27 IgAN patients. The increase in IgA AGA did not correlate with the gluten sensitivity as measured by NO and/or MPO. A specific serum IgG AGA response was seen in one patient only. Antibodies against tissue transglutaminase and endomysium were not observed. CONCLUSION: It is concluded that approximately one-third of our IgAN patients have a rectal mucosal sensitivity to gluten, but without signs of coeliac disease, and we hypothesize that such sub-clinical inflammation to gluten might be involved in the pathogenesis of IgAN in a subgroup of patients.},

   abstract = {We tested the hypothesis that a mental task attenuates the meal-induced vasodilation in the splanchnic vasculature. Ten subjects performed a 5-min colour-word conflict test (CWT) under fasting and postprandial conditions. Subjects in the postprandial condition had ingested solid food with an energy content of 300 kcal (1,255 kJ) before either performing the CWT (mental task trial) or resting (resting control trial). The mean blood velocities (MBV) in the coeliac artery (CA) and superior mesenteric artery (SMA), and the mean arterial pressure (MAP) were measured. The MBV in the CA and SMA were divided by the MAP to assess the vascular conductance (VC). The MBV in the CA and SMA were significantly increased by the CWT under fasting conditions. In the postprandial condition, the MBV in the CA and SMA significantly increased immediately after the meal in both the mental task and resting control trials. The VC in the SMA, but not in the CA, was significantly decreased by the CWT under fasting conditions. In the postprandial conditions, there was no significant difference in the VC in both arteries between mental task and resting control trials. These results suggest that a mental task exerts different effects on the CA and SMA under fasting but not postprandial condition. The vasoconstrictive effect of a mental task on the SMA does not counter the vasodilatory effect of meal ingestion.},

   abstract = {In this work, we describe how to realize a new sensing platform for an easy and fast detection of analytes. In particular, we utilized enhanced fluorescence emission on silver island films (SIFs) coupled to the total internal reflection fluorescence mode (TIRF) to develop a new assay format for the detection of target analytes. Here, as an example, we report on the detection of the toxic peptides present in gliadin (Gli). Our assay was performed as follows: (1) gliadin was first captured on surfaces coated with anti-Gli antibodies; (2) the surfaces were then incubated with fluorophore-labeled anti-Gli antibodies; (3) the signal from the fluorophore-labeled anti-Gli antibody bound to the antigen was detected by TIRF. The system was examined on glass surfaces and on SIFs. We observed a relevant enhancement of the signal from SIFs compared to the signal from the glass substrate not modified with a SIF. In addition, the estimated detection limit (EDL) of our methodology was 60 ng/mL (or lower). This limit is therefore lower than the clinical cut-off for Gli presence in food for celiac patients. The advantage of our method is a reduced number of testing steps, which allows for easy detection of residual toxic peptides in food labeled as gluten free. The proposed technology can be easily expanded to the determination of different target analytes.},

   abstract = {Currently the only treatment for coeliac disease is a lifelong gluten-free diet excluding food products containing wheat, rye and barley. There is, however, only scarce evidence as to harmful effects of rye in coeliac disease. To confirm the assumption that rye should be excluded from the coeliac patient's diet, we now sought to establish whether rye secalin activates toxic reactions in vitro in intestinal epithelial cell models as extensively as wheat gliadin. Further, we investigated the efficacy of germinating cereal enzymes from oat, wheat and barley to hydrolyse secalin into short fragments and whether secalin-induced harmful effects can be reduced by such pretreatment. In the current study, secalin elicited toxic reactions in intestinal Caco-2 epithelial cells similarly to gliadin: it induced epithelial cell layer permeability, tight junctional protein occludin and ZO-1 distortion and actin reorganization. In high-performance liquid chromatography and mass spectroscopy (HPLC-MS), germinating barley enzymes provided the most efficient degradation of secalin and gliadin peptides and was thus selected for further in vitro analysis. After germinating barley enzyme pretreatment, all toxic reactions induced by secalin were ameliorated. We conclude that germinating enzymes from barley are particularly efficient in the degradation of rye secalin. In future, these enzymes might be utilized as a novel medical treatment for coeliac disease or in food processing in order to develop high-quality coeliac-safe food products.},

   abstract = {Neuropeptide S receptor 1 (NPSR1) was recently found to be genetically associated with inflammatory bowel disease in addition to asthma and related traits. Epithelia of several organs express NPSR1 isoforms A and B, including the intestine and the skin, and NPSR1 appears to be upregulated in inflammation. In this study, we used cell lines and tissue samples to characterize the expression of NPSR1 and its ligand neuropeptide S (NPS) in inflammation. We used polyclonal and monoclonal antibodies to investigate the expression of NPS and NPSR1 in intestinal diseases, such as celiac disease and food allergy, and in cutaneous inflammatory disorders. We found that NPSR1-A was expressed by the enteroendocrine cells of the gut. Overall, the expression pattern of NPS was similar to its receptor suggesting an autocrine mechanism. In an NPSR1-A overexpressing cell model, stimulation with NPS resulted in a dose-dependent upregulation of glycoprotein hormone, alpha polypeptide (CGA), tachykinin 1 (TAC1), neurotensin (NTS) and galanin (GAL) encoding peptide hormones secreted by enteroendocrine cells. Because NPSR1 was also expressed in macrophages, neutrophils, and intraepithelial lymphocytes, we demonstrated that stimulation with the pro-inflammatory cytokines tumour necrosis factor alpha and interferon gamma increased NPSR1 expression in the THP-1 monocytic cells. In conclusion, similar to other neuropeptides and their receptors, NPSR1 signalling might play a dual role along the gut-brain axis. The NPS/NPSR1 pathway may participate in the regulation of the peptide hormone production in enteroendocrine cells of the small intestine.},

   abstract = {Few studies have focused on gendered consequences of coeliac disease (CD), despite the fact that women with coeliac disease report lower health-related quality of life than men do. The aim of this study was to explore consequences of dilemmas in everyday lives for women and men, as personally affected by CD or as close relatives to someone affected by the disease and to put these experiences into context regarding household activities. This QUAL-quan study included 28 men and 38 women. A mix method design was used. The critical incident technique that captures, in a structured way, the qualities of experiences was used in interviews to identify dilemmas and their consequences. To describe the social context of these dilemmas, a quantitative questionnaire was developed on food preparations and purchase, as well as on cooking and meal behaviours. The study was approved by the Research Ethics Committee of the Faculty of Health Sciences. The consequences were found in cognitive, social, emotional and physical aspects of human life. The overall pattern of these consequences was similar in women and men irrespective of being personally affected or a close relative. The main consequences identified were: daily concerns about gluten, constant preparation, being different, emotional pressure and body sensations because of CD. Descriptive data extracted from the questionnaire showed that women and men reported having a different social situation in relation to preparing food, making decisions about purchases, buying food products and preparing meals. The clinical implications of these findings are that healthcare professionals need to develop family-oriented information in relation to CD. It is necessary to inform the close relatives irrespective of sex of the possible consequences of the disease and to take in to account the different social context that women and men report in relation to food preparations.},

   abstract = {Celiac disease is a gluten-sensitive enteropathy that affects people of all ages worldwide. This disease has emerged as a major health-care problem, as advances in diagnostic and screening methods have revealed its global prevalence. Environmental factors such as gluten introduction at childhood, infectious agents and socioeconomic features, as well as the presence of HLA-DQ2 and/or HLA-DQ8 haplotypes or genetic variations in several non-HLA genes contribute to the development of celiac disease. Growing insight into the variable clinical and histopathological presentation features of this disease has opened new perspectives for future research. A strict life-long gluten-free diet is the only safe and efficient available treatment, yet it results in a social burden. Alternative treatment modalities focus on modification of dietary components, enzymatic degradation of gluten, inhibition of intestinal permeability and modulation of the immune response. A small group of patients with celiac disease (2-5%), however, fail to improve clinically and histologically upon elimination of dietary gluten. This complication is referred to as refractory celiac disease, and imposes a serious risk of developing a virtually lethal enteropathy-associated T-cell lymphoma.},

Barley is diploid with pure inbred cultivars available, and is attractive for genetic approaches to detoxification. AIM: To identify barley hordein fractions which activated the interferon-gamma (IFN-gamma) secreting peripheral blood T-cells from coeliac volunteers, and compare immunotoxicity of hordeins from experimental barley lines. METHODS: To reactivate a T-cell response to hordein, volunteers underwent a 3-day oral barley challenge. Peripheral blood mononuclear cells (PBMC) were isolated from twenty-one HLA DQ2(+) patients with confirmed coeliac disease. IFN-gamma ELISpot assays enumerated T-cells activated by purified prolamins and positive controls. RESULTS: Hordein-specific T-cells were induced by oral barley challenge. All prolamin fractions were immunotoxic, but D- and C-hordeins were most active. Barley lines lacking B- and C-hordeins had a 5-fold reduced hordein-content, and immunotoxicity of hordein extracts were reduced 20-fold compared with wild-type barley. CONCLUSIONS: In vivo oral barley challenge offers a convenient and rapid approach to test the immunotoxicity of small amounts of purified hordeins using fresh T-cells from patients in high throughput overnight assays. Barley lines that did not accumulate B- and C-hordeins were viable, yet had substantially reduced immunotoxicity. Creation of hordein-free barley may therefore be possible.},

   abstract = {Under the Food Allergen and Consumer Protection Act, the Food and Drug Administration (FDA) must issue a rule for the voluntary labeling of food as gluten-free. In the proposed rule, many single-ingredient foods, such as millet, are considered inherently free of gluten. Inherently gluten-free grains will be considered misbranded if they carry a gluten-free label and do not also state that all foods of the same type are gluten-free (eg, "all millet is gluten free"). Twenty-two inherently gluten-free grains, seeds, and flours not labeled gluten-free were purchased in June 2009 and sent unopened to a company who specializes in gluten analysis. All samples were homogenized and tested in duplicate using the Ridascreen Gliadin sandwich R5 enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay with cocktail extraction. Thirteen of 22 (59%) samples contained less than the limit of quantification of 5 parts per million (ppm) for gluten. Nine of 22 (41%) samples contained more than the limit of quantification, with mean gluten levels ranging from 8.5 to 2,925.0 ppm. Seven of 22 samples (32%) contained mean gluten levels >/=20 ppm and would not be considered gluten-free under the proposed FDA rule for gluten-free labeling. Gluten contamination of inherently gluten-free grains, seeds, and flours not labeled gluten-free is a legitimate concern. The FDA may want to modify their proposed rule for labeling of food as gluten-free, removing the requirement that gluten-free manufacturers of inherently gluten-free grains, seeds, and flours must state on product labels that all foods of that type are gluten-free.},

   abstract = {BACKGROUND & AIMS: The presence of celiac disease-associated autoantibodies (antiendomysium and antitissue transglutaminase [anti-TG2]) with normal jejunal mucosa indicate potential celiac disease. We performed a prospective, 3-year cohort study to determine the natural history of potential celiac disease in children. METHODS: The study included 106 children with potential celiac disease, based on serology analysis and normal duodenal architecture. All but 2 carried the HLA-DQ2 and/or DQ8 haplotype. In all children, every 6 months, growth, nutritional parameters, celiac disease serology, and autoimmunity were investigated. In biopsies, gammadelta intraepithelial-, CD3-, and lamina propria CD25-positive cells were counted; duodenal deposits of anti-TG2 immunoglobulin A were detected. Biopsy analysis was repeated after 2 years on patients with persistent positive serology and/or symptoms. RESULTS: Celiac disease was detected primarily in first-degree relatives and patients with autoimmune disorders (40.6%). A gluten-free diet was prescribed to 20/106 patients because of symptoms, which were relieved in only 11. Eighty-nine of the 106 patients entered the follow-up study, with normal daily consumption of gluten. During the follow-up antibodies disappeared in 14.6% and fluctuated in 32.6%. Villous atrophy was observed in 12/39 patients (30.8%) who underwent a repeat biopsy. CONCLUSIONS: Most children with potential celiac disease remain healthy. After 3 years, approximately 33% of patients develop villous atrophy. Intestinal deposits of anti-TG2 IgA identify children at risk for villous atrophy.},

The medical history revealed premature cessation of breast feeding, intolerance to the ingestion of baby foods, anorexia, and abdominal distention. Prior to her referral, endoscopic small intestinal biopsy had been carried out under general anesthesia with a possible diagnosis of Celiac Disease (CD). Her parents did not want their child to undergo general anesthesia for the second time for the excisional biopsy. We decided to follow the patient until all systemic investigations were concluded. In evaluation, the case was diagnosed with CD and the conjunctival tumor showed complete regression during gluten-free dietary treatment. The clinical fleshy appearance of the lesion with spider-like vascular extensions and subconjunctival hemorrhagic spots, possible association with an acquired immune system dysfunction due to CD, and spontaneous regression by a gluten-free diet led us to make a presumed diagnosis of conjunctival Kaposi sarcoma.},

   abstract = {Tetraploid wheat (durum wheat) is mainly used for the preparation of pasta. As a result of breeding, thousands of tetraploid wheat varieties exist, but also tetraploid landraces are still maintained and used for local food preparations. Gluten proteins present in wheat can induce celiac disease, a T-cell mediated auto-immune disorder, in genetically predisposed individuals after ingestion. Compared to hexaploid wheat, tetraploid wheat might be reduced in T-cell stimulatory epitopes that cause celiac disease because of the absence of the D-genome. We tested gluten protein extracts from 103 tetraploid wheat accessions (obtained from the Dutch CGN genebank and from the French INRA collection) including landraces, old, modern, and domesticated accessions of various tetraploid species and subspecies from many geographic origins. Those accessions were typed for their level of T-cell stimulatory epitopes by immunoblotting with monoclonal antibodies against the alpha-gliadin epitopes Glia-alpha9 and Glia-alpha20. In the first selection, we found 8 CGN and 6 INRA accessions with reduced epitope staining. Fourteen of the 57 CGN accessions turned out to be mixed with hexaploid wheat, and 5 out of the 8 selected CGN accessions were mixtures of two or more different gluten protein chemotypes. Based on single seed analysis, lines from two CGN accessions and one INRA accession were obtained with significantly reduced levels of Glia-alpha9 and Glia-alpha20 epitopes. These lines will be further tested for industrial quality and may contribute to the development of safer foods for celiac patients.},

   abstract = {BACKGROUND: Gluten proteins can induce celiac disease (CD) in genetically susceptible individuals. In CD patients gluten-derived peptides are presented to the immune system, which leads to a CD4+ T-cell mediated immune response and inflammation of the small intestine. However, not all gluten proteins contain T-cell stimulatory epitopes. Gluten proteins are encoded by multigene loci present on chromosomes 1 and 6 of the three different genomes of hexaploid bread wheat (Triticum aestivum) (AABBDD). RESULTS: The effects of deleting individual gluten loci on both the level of T-cell stimulatory epitopes in the gluten proteome and the technological properties of the flour were analyzed using a set of deletion lines of Triticum aestivum cv. Chinese Spring. The reduction of T-cell stimulatory epitopes was analyzed using monoclonal antibodies that recognize T-cell epitopes present in gluten proteins. The deletion lines were technologically tested with respect to dough mixing properties and dough rheology. The results show that removing the alpha-gliadin locus from the short arm of chromosome 6 of the D-genome (6DS) resulted in a significant decrease in the presence of T-cell stimulatory epitopes but also in a significant loss of technological properties. However, removing the omega-gliadin, gamma-gliadin, and LMW-GS loci from the short arm of chromosome 1 of the D-genome (1DS) removed T-cell stimulatory epitopes from the proteome while maintaining technological properties. CONCLUSION: The consequences of these data are discussed with regard to reducing the load of T-cell stimulatory epitopes in wheat, and to contributing to the design of CD-safe wheat varieties.},

Epidemiological studies report that breastfeeding could protect from these diseases. However, data are controversial and the mechanisms unclear. Experimental data suggest that breastfeeding-induced protection might rely on tolerance induction as long as some criteria are fulfilled. Thus, the tolerogenic potential of breast milk would depend on maternal exposure to common environmental and dietary antigens and the efficiency of antigen transfer across mammary epithelium. Induction of tolerance upon breast milk-mediated antigen transfer will also depend on the presence of immunomodulatory factors in breast milk and of its impact on neonatal gut and immune system maturation. The better understanding of maternal influence on tolerance induction through breastfeeding should allow the development of new strategies to prevent immune-mediated diseases.},

   abstract = {Oral tolerance refers to the observation that prior feeding of an antigen induces local and systemic immune tolerance to that antigen. Physiologically, this process is probably of central importance for preventing inflammatory responses to the numerous dietary and microbial antigens present in the gut. Defective oral tolerance can lead to gut inflammatory disease, food allergies, and celiac disease. In the last two cases, the diseases develop early in life, stressing the necessity of understanding how oral tolerance is set up in neonates. This article reviews the parameters that have been outlined in adult animal models as necessary for tolerance induction and assesses whether these factors operate in neonates. In addition, we highlight the factors that are specific for this period of life and discuss how they could have an impact on oral tolerance. We pay particular attention to maternal influence on early oral tolerance induction through breast-feeding and outline the major parameters that could be modified to optimize tolerance induction in early life and possibly prevent allergic diseases.},

Four independent variables DCHF, QF, ammonium bicarbonated (AB) and baking time (BT) at three levels each one were considered in orden to evaluate their effects on the sensory quality (SQ) and signal to noise ratio (S/N) of the optimized product. To determine the optimun levels and relative magnitude of the effects of each parameter L9 3(4) orthogonal array with nine design points and two replications each totalizing eighteen experimental runs was used. Results were analyzed using differences between the average values of each factor according to the working level and also analysis of variance (ANOVA). The desired characteristics were the maxima SQ and S/R responses, so Taguchi "the larger the better" performance formula was used. Optimun conditions turn out to be DCHF 24.3%; QF 7.1%; AB 0.6%; BT 22 minutes. Among the chemical characteristics highlighted components such as protein (8.9%) and fiber (12.7%). Regarding the prolamine content of 1.5 ppm its result was under the limit considered for CODEX (20 ppm) classifying this product as gluten free. On the other hand, the shelf life study expressed as conjugated dienes (CD) was 3.6% after 45 days at 30 degrees C storage conditions proving this product is stable to rancidness. Hedonic test data shown 100% approval, splitted as follow 75% (like very much) and 25% (like). Finally 100% of celiac peoples inquired in this study were well disposed to buy this product.},

The present study deals with variation in the immune response of mucosal T-cells from celiac children to prolamins extracted from nine landraces of farro wheat (Triticum turgidum ssp. dicoccum) with contrasting storage protein compositions. METHODS: The prolamin fraction from nine 'dicoccum' wheat landraces was subjected to peptic-tryptic digestion and supplied to T-cells from mucosal explants of four celiac patients. Immune reactions in terms of cell proliferation and INF-gamma secretion by intestinal T lymphocytes were then determined. RESULTS: T-cell lines exposed to digested prolamins from landraces L5563, L5558 and L5540 showed negligible proliferative responses and released INF-gamma amounts similar to that of untreated control cells. By contrast, landraces Ersa 6, Ersa 8, Leonessa 4 and Leonessa 5 proved to be very active in triggering the immune responses, whereas landraces Filosini and Prometeo exhibited an intermediate behavior. One-dimensional fractionations by A-PAGE or SDS-PAGE revealed distinctive prolamin patterns amongst the landraces analysed. CONCLUSIONS: 'Dicoccum' wheat represents a heterogeneous species showing a wide variation in both prolamin composition and T-cell immunological activation, some 'dicoccum' landraces being poor in or devoid of noxious gluten proteins.},

   abstract = {BACKGROUND: A small fraction of dietary protein survives enzymatic degradation and is absorbed in potentially antigenic form. This can trigger inflammatory responses in patients with celiac disease or food allergies, but typically induces systemic immunological tolerance (oral tolerance). At present it is not clear how dietary antigens are absorbed. Most food staples, including those with common antigens such as peanuts, eggs, and milk, contain long-chain triglycerides (LCT), which stimulate mesenteric lymph flux and postprandial transport of chylomicrons through mesenteric lymph nodes (MLN) and blood. Most dietary antigens, like ovalbumin (OVA), are emulsifiers, predicting affinity for chylomicrons. We hypothesized that chylomicron formation promotes intestinal absorption and systemic dissemination of dietary antigens. METHODOLOGY/PRINCIPAL FINDINGS: Absorption of OVA into MLN and blood was significantly enhanced when OVA was gavaged into fasted mice together with LCT compared with medium-chain triglycerides (MCT), which do not stimulate chylomicron formation. The effect of LCT was blocked by the addition of an inhibitor of chylomicron secretion, Pluronic L-81. Adoptively transferred OVA-specific DO11.10 T-cells proliferated more extensively in peripheral lymph nodes when OVA was gavaged with LCT than with MCT or LCT plus Pluronic L-81, suggesting that dietary OVA is systemically disseminated. Most dietary OVA in plasma was associated with chylomicrons, suggesting that these particles mediate systemic antigen dissemination. Intestinal-epithelial CaCo-2 cells secreted more cell-associated, exogenous OVA when stimulated with oleic-acid than with butyric acid, and the secreted OVA appeared to be associated with chylomicrons. CONCLUSIONS/SIGNIFICANCE: Postprandial chylomicron formation profoundly affects absorption and systemic dissemination of dietary antigens. The fat content of a meal may affect immune responses to dietary antigens by modulating antigen absorption and transport.},

This paper describes the development and implementation of a mass-spectrometry-based technique to determine markers for individual sources of gluten in beer products. This methodology was shown to answer the requirements of Health Canada's proposed labeling standard for individual gluten source declaration, in order to achieve its policy objectives (i.e., protection of sensitive consumers, while promoting choice). Minimal sample work-up was required and the results obtained by ELISA were further complemented using the LC-MS/MS method. This paper aims to demonstrate the feasibility of alternative techniques to ELISA-based methodologies to determine allergen and gluten markers in food.},

   abstract = {OBJECTIVES: Regulatory T (Treg) cells together with intestinal microflora play a central role in controlling allergic inflammation. We examined the markers related to Treg cells, and bacterial signaling, such as Toll-like receptors (TLR)-2 and -4, in the duodenal mucosa of patients with food allergy (FA). PATIENTS AND METHODS: Small intestinal samples were collected from patients with FA on a normal or an elimination diet, from healthy controls and patients with untreated celiac disease. Single and double immunohistochemistry were used to enumerate the densities of Foxp3-positive cells and TLR2- and TLR4-positive cells in the mucosa and evaluate the colocalization of Foxp3 expression in CD4, CD25, and CTLA-4 cells. The mRNA expression of CD25, Foxp3, TLR2, and TLR4 was measured by reverse transcriptase-polymerase chain reaction. RESULTS: The densities of Foxp3 and TLR4 cells were significantly increased in patients with untreated FA compared with healthy controls (P = 0.003, P = 0.033), and the Foxp3 cells were higher in untreated than in treated allergic patients (P < 0.001). The immense majority of Foxp3 cells were CD4 (median 100%), CTLA-4 (100%), or CD25 (81%). The ratio of Foxp3 mRNA to Foxp3 cells was decreased in patients with FA and in patients with celiac disease compared with controls (P = 0.036, P = 0.035). CONCLUSIONS: Foxp3 cells are increased in the duodenum of patients with untreated FA, but these cells are not able to suppress the harmful immune response, indicated by the low expression of Foxp3 transcripts. The increase of TLR4 cells and their correlation with TCRgammadelta intraepithelial lymphocytes suggest a role for the innate immunity and intestinal microbiota in FA.},

   abstract = {BACKGROUND: Coeliac disease affects about 1% of the population, with the majority being undetected. As a consequence, there have been calls for the introduction of screening. Before screening is given serious consideration, it is important to assess how acceptable early diagnoses and treatment would be. AIM: To assess patients' views as to the diagnosis and treatment of disease. METHODS: Coeliac disease patients who had taken a gluten-free diet for at least 12 months (mean 60 months) were mailed a questionnaire. Coeliac patients presenting with typical classical symptoms were compared with those diagnosed without such symptoms. RESULTS: Overall, 83% (147/177) of coeliac patients returned the questionnaires. Two-thirds (68%, 101/147) reported that their dietary restrictions reduced their enjoyment of food; 46% (68/147) believed their food cost them more and estimated this to be an extra 10 pounds sterling (16 euros) per week. Of those reporting greater cost, 31 (21%) said this was a problem for them. Half (54%, 80/147) reported doing things they enjoyed less often because of their diet, with the most common activity sacrificed being dining out (n = 65). In spite of these findings, 81% (119/147) reported being pleased that they were diagnosed, with 66% (59/89) of cases with classical symptoms wishing they had been diagnosed earlier compared with 45% (23/51) of those without such symptoms (chi(2) = 6.0, P < .05). In contrast, 27% (14/51) of coeliacs diagnosed without classical symptoms regretted being diagnosed with their condition compared with 10% (9/89) of those with classical symptoms (chi(2) = 7.1, P < .01). CONCLUSIONS: Even after several years of a gluten-free diet, many patients with coeliac disease regard it as a substantial burden, with a quarter of screen detected patients reporting regret at being diagnosed. Our findings question how acceptable screening for coeliac disease would be in people with minimal or no symptoms.},

   abstract = {BACKGROUND: The only therapy for coeliac disease (CD) is a long-term gluten-free diet (GFD). Little is known about the detailed composition of such a diet. AIM: To clarify the nutritional composition of a GFD and to compare it with a non-GFD diet in representative non-CD populations. METHODS: A total of 139 consecutive patients with CD were invited to fill in a prospective validated 5-day food diary, of whom data from 93 were analysed. Results were compared with data from the National Diet and Nutrition Survey of Adults and the UK Women's Cohort Study (UKWCS). RESULTS: Individuals consuming a strict GFD generally had similar intakes of energy and nutrients to those of comparison populations, but a higher proportion of carbohydrate intake was obtained from nonmilk extrinsic sugars and intakes of nonstarch polysaccharides were low. Compared with the UKWCS sample, female patients adhering to a GFD had lower intakes of magnesium, iron, zinc, manganese, selenium and folate. In male patients, intakes of magnesium and selenium were particularly low. CONCLUSIONS: This study reinforces the need for clinicians to recognize that avoidance of gluten cannot be the sole focus of a gluten-free diet. Maintenance of adequate intakes of essential nutrients and in particular complex carbohydrates must also be the goal for patients.},

   abstract = {BACKGROUND: no systematic studies on the prevalence of coeliac disease (CD) have been reported from China. In western populations CD is more common in patients with insulin dependent diabetes mellitus (IDDM) and in diarrhoea-predominant irritable bowel syndrome (D-IBS). We have screened patients with these conditions presenting to the outpatient department of a large hospital of "Traditional Chinese Medicine" (TCM) in Nanjing, Jiangsu province, P.R. China. METHODS: we tested sera of 78 unrelated Han Chinese patients (5 IDDM and 73 D-IBS), using ELISA serological tests for IgG anti-gliadin antibodies (IgG-AGA) and IgA anti-tissue transglutaminase antibodies (IgA-tTG). RESULTS: six out of 78 patients (7.7%) were positive for IgG-AGA (two men and four women) and two (2.6%) were positive for IgA-tTGs. One of the latter patients was negative for IgG-AGA. Besides, one patient had a dubious IgA-tTG antibody and a positive IgG-AGA. None of the six patients agreed to undergo duodenal biopsy. Two out of these six patients followed a gluten-free diet for one year. In one patient the diarrhoea ceased and his body weight increased. Another stopped losing weight. CONCLUSIONS: this study previously published as a letter in GUT (Wu J, Xia B, von Blomberg BME, Zhao C, Yang XW, Crusius JBA, Pena AS. Coeliac disease: emerging in China? Gut 2010; 59(3): 418-9) demonstrated that CD may exist in the Jiangsu province of P.R. China. The present article draws attention to the difficulties of following a standard protocol in China such as established in western countries and highlights important factors less well known in the west in relation to the development of CD in China. Wheat production became significant in China between 1600 and 1300 B.C. After the Han dynasty (500-200 B.C.), wheat was one of the main cereals in China. One the major wheat fields in China is located in the Jiangsu province where the research for this article was performed. A review of Chinese literature shows that the predominant HLA-DQ CD risk alleles and haplotypes are present in the Jiangsu province. Genetic background, food consumption, and the results of our study suggest that CD should actively be investigated in P.R. China.},

We hypothesize that selective sympathetic stimulation of the upper gastrointestinal tract will preserve the advantages of systemic sympathetic stimulation without its adverse events. This study evaluated the effect of splanchnic nerve stimulation on metabolic rate, food intake, and body composition. METHODS: Sixteen Sprague Dawley rats had monopolar electrodes placed on the superior common splanchnic nerve innervating the celiac ganglia. An indifferent electrode was placed subcutaneously on the back. The animals were placed on a 60% fat diet, and eight rats were stimulated for 6 weeks. The stimulation was advanced over 3 days from 0.6 mA to 3 mA. Metabolic rate and food intake were measured daily; weight change was monitored weekly, and body composition was determined by nuclear magnetic resonance (NMR) at the end of the study. Four of the eight animals had metabolic rate measured three times over 2-day periods at 0 mA, 1 mA, and 3 mA of stimulation in a metabolic chamber. RESULTS: Except for the first week of stimulation, there was no difference in body weight between the stimulated and control groups. Cumulative food intake was less in the stimulated group (p<0. 001). The lean-to-fat ratio was greater in the stimulated group (p<0. 01), and the animals that received incremental stimulation showed significantly augmented metabolic rate (p<0. 02). CONCLUSIONS: Splanchnic nerve stimulation decreased food intake, increased metabolic rate, and improved body composition.},

RSCH significantly decreased the tumor weight by 44% and 53% in the 100 and 150 mg/kg/d groups, respectively, without causing mortality or growth retardation. The thymus and spleen indices (organ weight relative to body weight) were increased significantly in the 150 mg/kg/d group. The phagocytic capability of coeliac macrophages and delayed-type hypersensitivity (DTH) were significantly increased in tumor-bearing mice treated with RSCH at 150 mg/kg/d. RSCH administration also enhanced the superoxide dismutase activity and reduced the serum level of thiobarbituric acid reactive substances. Our results show that an oral RSCH administration had an antitumor protective effect and may improve immune function by reducing free radical formation and oxidative stress in a murine model.},

Rice proteins do not possess the viscoelastic properties typically found in gluten, thus making rice flour unsuitable for the production of yeast-leavened products. In the present study, we found that the addition of glutathione to rice batter improves its gas-retaining properties. Glutathione was found to prevent the formation of the disulfide-linked macromolecular protein barrier, which is reported to confer resistance to the deformation of rice batter in the baking process. Also, glutathione appeared to gelatinize rice starch at lower temperatures. Microstructure analyses of glutathione-added rice bread revealed it to have a perforated structure like wheat bread but with a smoother-looking surface. These data collectively suggest that glutathione facilitates the deformation of rice batter, thus increasing its elasticity in the early stages of bread baking and the volume of the resulting bread.},

This study is experimental and was subdivided into five steps: selection and development of preparation, chemical analysis, sensory analysis, and statistical analysis. Modified samples of the bread dough achieved a 93.0% acceptance rate for individuals with celiac disease and up to 97.0% for individuals without celiac disease. The most affected characteristics were odor and texture. In terms of chemical composition of the bread dough, energy was reduced by 32.1% and the fat fraction was 42.3% before being cooked. Data obtained from sensory analysis of psyllium doughs indicate that the products had good acceptance by individuals with celiac disease as well as by individuals without celiac disease. This suggests that psyllium can replace gluten in preparations. Furthermore, in terms of chemical composition, products made with modified dough had less fat and fewer calories.},

   abstract = {OBJECTIVE: To observe the effect of Qiyao Xiaoke Capsule (QXC, a Chinese preparation for invigorating qi and nourishing yin) on glycolipid metabolism in the liver and skeletal muscle of rats with catch-up growth (CUG) induced by high-fat diet. METHODS: CUG model rats were made by limiting forge followed by high-fat diet, and intervened with different dosages [1.8 (g/kg x d), 0.6 g/(kg x d)] of QXC. And the experiment was controlled with pioglitazone. Levels of blood glucose, serum free fatty acid (FFA), serum insulin (Fins), plasma adiponcetin (AC) and insulin resistance index (IRI) as well as the weights of peri-epididymis and peri-renal fat and their ratio to body weight were observed 8 weeks later. The contents of total cholesterol (TC), triglyceride (TG) and glucose uptake in skeletal muscle and liver were also determined. RESULTS: Insulin resistance in CUG rats can be induced by high-fat diet. Compared with the un-treated model rats, levels of Fins and AC were higher, IRI and FFA were lower in CUG rats after intervened by QXC (P < 0.05 or P < 0.01). Moreover, QXC at large dose showed the effects of reducing TG content in liver and skeletal muscle, advancing the glucose uptake in skeletal muscle, displaying an efficacy similar to that of pioglitazone (P > 0.05). CONCLUSION: QXC could improve the glycolipid metabolism in high-fat diet-induced CUG rats through different pathways of intervention to alleviate/delay the occurrence and development of insulin resistance in the liver and skeletal muscle.},

   abstract = {Sympathetic activity and obesity have a reciprocal relationship. Firstly, hypothalamic obesity is associated with decreased sympathetic activity. Caffeine and ephedrine increase sympathetic activity and induce weight loss, of which 25% is due to increased metabolic rate and 75% is due to a reciprocally decreased food intake. Secondly, hormones and drugs that affect body weight have an inverse relationship between food intake and metabolic rate. Neuropeptide Y decreases sympathetic activity and increases food intake and body weight. Thirdly, a gastric pacemaker Transcend and vagotomy increase the ratio of sympathetic to parasympathetic activation, decrease food intake, and block gut satiety hormones. Weight loss with the pacemaker or vagotomy is variable. Significant weight reduction is seen only in a small group of those treated. This suggests that activation of the sympathetic arm of the autonomic nervous system may be most important for weight loss. Systemic sympathetic activation causes weight loss in obese patients, but side effects limited its use. We hypothesize that selective local electrical sympathetic stimulation of the upper gastrointestinal tract may induce weight loss and offer a safer, yet effective, obesity treatment. Celiac ganglia delivers sympathetic innervation to the upper gastrointestinal tract. Voltage regulated electrical simulation of the rat celiac ganglia increased metabolic rate in a dose-dependent manner. Stimulation of 6, 3, or 1.5 V increased metabolic rate 15.6%, 6.2%, and 5%, respectively in a single rat. These responses support our hypothesis that selective sympathetic stimulation of the upper GI tract may treat obesity while avoiding side effects of systemic sympathetic activation.},

   abstract = {OBJECTIVE: Coeliac disease (CD) is a multisystemic autoimmune inflammation of the intestinal tract induced by wheat gluten and related cereals in human leucocyte antigen (HLA)-DQ2/8-positive individuals. The molecular mechanisms relevant to oral tolerance induction towards toxic cereals such as gliadin remain poorly understood. Enterocytes, which express predominantly HLA-DR proteins, are capable of processing, transcytosing and presenting food antigens from the intestinal lumen to T lymphocytes of the lamina propria. METHODS: Epitope-specific monoclonal antigliadin antibodies are utilised to unravel the intraepithelial transport processes of gliadin peptides in human duodenal biopsy specimens from patients with CD and reconstitute the transepithelial and endocytic pathways of gliadin in intestinal epithelial HT29 cells. RESULTS: The gliadin peptide AA 31-49 is segregated from the peptides AA 56-68 and AA 229-246 along the endosomal pathway. Thus, AA 31-49 bypasses HLA-DR-positive late endosomes in intestinal cells and in biopsy specimens of patients with untreated CD. Further, it is localised in early endosomes and consequently escapes antigen presentation at the basolateral membrane, unlike peptides AA 56-68 and AA 229-246 that reach HLA-DR-positive late endosomes. Strikingly, forms of gliadin peptide AA 31-49 conjugated to cholera toxin B are sorted into late endosomes of HT29 cells. CONCLUSIONS: Endocytic segregation of gliadin peptide AA 31-49 seems to be a constitutive process. It explains why this peptide cannot stimulate gluten-sensitive T cells. Presentation of gliadin peptides by HLA-DR proteins via late endosomes within enterocytes might induce a tolerogenic effect and constitutes a potentially promising therapeutic approach for induction of tolerance towards gliadin.},
